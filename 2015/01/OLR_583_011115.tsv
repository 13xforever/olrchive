0	27000	This week, Nintendo started the first full week of the year off with news of a partnership allowing their flagship series characters to be used in a non-Nintendo game. There's plenty of other movement as we progress into 2015, and we'll tell you more along with your comments, calls, and emails right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
28000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	45000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this January 11th of 2015, episode number 583 of our show.
46000	61000	And we are here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle over the next three hours with you guys, all our live participants and podcast participants, and us here in studio. My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
62000	64000	And is that your final word on the matter?
65000	66000	No.
66000	67000	How are you?
67000	69000	I'm in recovery.
69000	71000	In recovery? Are you hungover?
71000	75000	No, I had a bad migraine yesterday, so my head has that weird numb feeling today.
76000	77000	Oh, those are no fun.
78000	87000	Yeah, so I have a sinus infection. I am taking antibiotics. I'm going to have great skin in about another few days.
88000	91000	You sound really good for having a sinus infection, so you must be a couple days into meds.
91000	102000	It hurts, but I've been on the antibiotics for about a week now, so I do mostly better, but it's just like, oh, come on, I had the flu, then it's a sinus infection, what's next, pneumonia?
103000	104000	Don't ask.
105000	107000	Actually, that is what happened last time I had a major sinus infection.
108000	112000	Be careful what you wish for. You better knock on wood. Well, if you need me to turn down some lights here in Studio N7, just let me know.
113000	114000	That's fine.
115000	116000	Luckily, it's not a TV show.
117000	118000	Just get me Pinkberry later.
118000	123000	Why don't you do OLR like a video? Why don't you do like a feed of stuff? To be fair, we used to do a long time ago.
124000	125000	Because, no.
126000	129000	But that would involve extra lighting, which is going to make an ace even worse.
130000	132000	Because, no. That's why. Because, no.
133000	134000	Because it's Orange Lingerino, not Orange Lingerino.
135000	136000	No.
137000	139000	Also here tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
140000	141000	Hi.
142000	143000	Hi, how are you, Loki?
144000	145000	Tired.
146000	147000	Tired? Yeah, I see you got an ample, ample supply of Red Bull here in the studio tonight.
148000	149000	It's the only thing that's keeping me awake.
150000	151000	If you ever want to start drinking coffee, let me know. We got a coffee maker.
152000	153000	I drink coffee too, but...
154000	155000	Oh, do you?
156000	157000	I don't like it.
158000	159000	Yeah?
160000	161000	Blasphemy.
162000	163000	Like the white mochas and crap.
164000	165000	Oh, Starbucks. Like the, you know.
166000	170000	Oh, I want a mochaccino, and I want soy, and I want three pumps sugar-free vanilla.
171000	172000	Oh, fuck that shit.
173000	174000	Okay, Mr. Non-Fat Latte.
175000	176000	Which is my actual order, just so you know.
176000	177000	Just kidding.
178000	185000	See, I can, I could go to any Starbucks and order, I could go anywhere and order Rob a drink as long as it has caramel and is non-fat.
186000	189000	Is that, okay, is that so bad? Non-fat milk is not, is not so bad.
190000	191000	It's like milk flavored water.
192000	193000	I know, I know, but...
194000	195000	I wholly agree.
196000	202000	But if you have the whole, like, my body doesn't like dairy things and it's a good way to save on fat, then I don't think it's so bad.
203000	205000	The drinks turn off, it has coffee in it still, it's the most important part.
206000	207000	The coffee melts some butter and pours it inside.
208000	209000	You know, I actually...
210000	211000	That's how you get fat.
212000	213000	No, that's bulletproof coffee. Fat is good for you.
214000	215000	Fat is good for you.
216000	222000	A little fat is good for you. Like, fat in, like, peanuts is good, but fat in french fries from McDonald's is not so good for you.
223000	224000	Well, they're not really food anyways.
225000	234000	Eating, eating whole foods that has not been processed is better for you than eating food that's been extra processed.
234000	237000	But frappuccinos have been processed, as delicious as they are.
238000	239000	That's okay, I'll still get my Americano.
240000	244000	Alright, uh, look, we have our chatters, the live chat room every week.
245000	246000	We only have them if they bring me coffee.
247000	255000	Over at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
256000	260000	And if you are listening live tonight, first off, thank you, you've chosen us over the Golden Globes.
261000	262000	And I hope that, I hope that it made...
262000	263000	You made the smart choice.
264000	268000	Yeah, you made the right choice, so I hope that didn't make you go, oh shit, and turn this off and go turn the Golden Globes on.
269000	271000	Anything you need to see will be on YouTube tomorrow.
272000	274000	Although if you're listening to this on Monday, it's too late.
275000	276000	It's too late, you missed it.
277000	278000	Haha, you're stuck with us for three hours.
279000	284000	Alright, anyway, let's see, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
285000	289000	Alan Alchemy says, Sky wants to get a sinus infection in the days before his Seattle trip.
290000	291000	So don't, don't breathe on me, Jamie.
292000	294000	My response is that sinus infections are not contagious.
295000	299000	It's bacteria because of the weirdness in my nose from the flu.
300000	304000	Fifth Dream in chat says, Starbucks, I'd like a coffee, what's that?
305000	307000	No, no, no, I'm sorry, that would be Dutch Brothers.
308000	311000	No, no, no, Starbucks says, I'd like coffee, do you want it triple burnt?
312000	315000	I prefer Dunkin Donuts where I get my sugar scoops with a side of coffee.
316000	319000	If I'm going to go anywhere, if I'm going to go anywhere for froufrou coffee, I will go to Dutch Brothers.
319000	321000	Do you even have any of those in Sacramento?
322000	323000	Yeah, there's like five of them.
324000	325000	Where? All over the place.
326000	327000	Any near me without giving my address away on air?
328000	329000	Um, there's one on Garfield.
330000	331000	Oh, well shit, I did not, alright.
332000	333000	There's one by my house.
334000	335000	I was checking Odie and Nirmal this whole time.
336000	340000	But, but obviously if I'm going to get like actual coffee at a chain, I'm going to go to Pete's.
341000	344000	Yeah, Pete's is pretty good. Anyway, uh, let's see, Alan Alchemy in chat says,
344000	350000	Non fat milk for when you don't want coffee black, but also don't want to be farty, bloaty, all fucking day just for some caffeine.
351000	352000	Thank you. Thank you, Alan Alchemy.
353000	357000	You have an eloquence with words that sometimes me hosting a radio show for 13 years, I fail with.
358000	359000	I'm a milk. I'm a milk latte.
360000	361000	It's okay. It's okay.
362000	364000	It's okay. Alan really likes that stuff. I'm not, I'm not big on that.
365000	368000	Act Deft and chat says he's watching the Golden Globes while listening to OLR.
369000	370000	No. No.
371000	372000	As long as they're muted.
372000	375000	Please. I'll put on the mask if I have to and chain you to the wall.
376000	384000	Make your choice. All right. Uh, anyway, uh, let's get into our show tonight and we'll talk about our gaming weeks, the types of games we've been playing this week.
385000	387000	But obviously this was a big week over the voice geeks network.
388000	395000	Uh, we had the vog game jam going on this week, uh, which was the effort to get more people to create things.
396000	401000	Uh, and we picked a theme a few weeks ago on the show, which was a buggy game through our highly scientific listless process.
402000	409000	Um, a few of you have submitted games. Uh, I saw about seven emails come in, which to be honest, I only thought there was going to be like maybe three.
410000	419000	So the fact that even like we got seven, uh, and that's just the people that remembered to actually send in an official email, which is what you were supposed to do before the deadline for the thing on the forums.
420000	425000	But I have a feeling we're going to get even more than that in the coming days, uh, because there's a lot of people that weren't able to finish their stuff.
425000	435000	Like I saw like YYR on Twitter, which is funny enough, YYR kind of inspired this whole idea and he wasn't able to finish his thing just because of IRL stuff, but I'm pretty sure he'll end up submitting something late.
436000	443000	Um, and Loki, I know your project was extremely ambitious and the deadline has come and gone and...
444000	446000	I tried and I was super stressed out and tired this entire week.
447000	448000	You tried, Goldstar, you tried.
448000	454000	I just like, you know, try working eight hours after sleeping, only a couple hours a day for two weeks.
455000	466000	Yeah. But what's interesting is that, you know, seeing what you have on YouTube and hearing about, I haven't, I haven't seen what you have built in Unity right now, but it seems like you've actually got a game.
467000	469000	It's just not to that level that you wanted it to be at right now.
470000	472000	Well, you have a car that can drive around a track.
472000	479000	Yeah. I've got, I've got that. I've got checkpoints and I just don't have it all hooked together, I guess. And I don't have levels.
480000	497000	Well, and it's not necessarily a racing game on top of that. Um, that's the funny part about it. It's more like, um, sort of like a WarioWare type of game because basically each level, as I mentioned before, is, um, it's broken in a different way.
497000	509000	And so it's, you know, one level you may have to race to the finish line, you know, in the quickest time. Another level, it may be, oh crap, you have to survive for a certain amount of time or other things that get thrown your way.
510000	520000	And just, but that sounds very ambitious because you're trying to, you have to, that you have to build each one of those, those different criteria instead of taking just one of them and getting your project.
521000	522000	I see why you didn't finish.
523000	527000	Yeah, I even tried. I was like, okay, well maybe I just scrapped something together real quick, but yeah, it just, it wasn't.
528000	536000	Yeah. Um, which, um, you know, and then YYR is in chat room saying that, you know, it was a week to come up with the idea and then a couple of hectic weeks of work.
537000	546000	You know what? I can't pick on YYR because I'm in the same boat is that, you know, I was unable to finish my project because I had my day job stuff come into play, which, you know, I don't make apologies for that.
546000	557000	The day job pays for this. So stuff with that will always come first as policy. I don't talk about, and as you can imagine with a lot of the crap that happened on Twitter in 2014, you can see why I'm not always up front.
558000	572000	Heaven forbid I say something that pisses the wrong person off on this program. So I, I don't really talk about my day job on air, but, um, you know, I had to basically say, I'm not going to get done with the project cause I have the day job in the way, but is, does that mean it was a total failure?
572000	588000	No, I don't think so at all because I feel more empowered now than I did a few weeks ago. Um, making a game really felt unattainable. It really did. Like I just like, you know, I can play them and I can comment on them and I can make silly games and games and other games.
589000	595000	But this whole unity thing, I was like, Oh, that's for people that studied computer science in college. That's for, that's for people that have more background than I do.
595000	604000	But I think something I learned through this whole process and I, I think the, you know, once again, the cooking with unity guys who were on about a month ago on the show for this, and I think Loki for this in large part.
605000	620000	I think a lot of you for this as well as that, you know, helping to show that unity is something you can do. So I did download install unity. I had an idea. I started to do some very basic motion things, but unfortunately that's only as far as I could get.
620000	630000	My idea was stupid simple though. And I do want to finish it at some point. And in a nutshell, um, my idea was taking and everybody knows the fly swatter game and Mario paint, right? Everybody knows that game. Everybody loves that game.
631000	642000	Uh, I was going to take that concept and reverse it basically that you're the fly and you're trying to dodge all the swatters. Uh, and that was, that was, you know, and I wanted to keep, I wanted to keep it like Atari 2,600 level basic.
642000	653000	Um, and I kinda was fleshing that out when, uh, in one of the very, very early cooking with unity videos, which I was using to really help me, uh, learn the thing we, they were talking about.
654000	665000	You could kind of have like a consistent motion, but you can also have that be altered with what the game pad does. So I wanted the flies movement to be very erratic and difficult to control.
665000	675000	And then that would kind of be the, the bugginess of the game as well as, you know, the fact that it was literally about a bug. So that was my idea. And it was really funny as Loki was like, I could build that in like an hour.
676000	685000	You want me to just do my, do your game for you? And I'm like, wait, no, no, that's not the point. I should have just jacked my idea. I'm like, that's not the point.
686000	696000	That would have, that would have ruined the whole thing. So unfortunately, you know, I don't have anything to present today, but I feel still like there was a success.
696000	707000	We've, we've crossed a point that we might not have otherwise. So I'm, I'm happy with that in that regard, but focusing less on the negative of, of me and focusing on the positive of you guys.
707000	717000	I'm, I'm really happy to see what was submitted out there. And the fact that so many of you participated and funny enough, I saw that the Cooking with Unity guys were participating too.
717000	726000	I don't know what it was they were doing. I didn't watch it because I wanted to be surprised, but I saw that they have several videos chronicling the whole thing from start to finish.
726000	729000	Yeah, that's pretty awesome. I was listening to it while I worked on my game.
729000	738000	Oh, that's so amazing. So what I did do, and here's what I can do because I didn't finish, but I am still, you know, the voice you hear on this show.
738000	753000	And one thing I did promise to do anyway, I'm going to go through each and every game and live stream it and do some playing and some, you know, tongue in cheek feedback, which means obviously I'm not going to be overly harsh to people that have worked very hard to create games.
753000	762000	But I will give, you know, my own sassy commentary on whatever it is you guys have created and, you know, try to at least bring a little attention to the great stuff that you guys did.
762000	768000	And maybe encourage some more people to check them out because it looks like there's some pretty intricate stuff out there.
768000	769000	I have to do it again.
769000	779000	I know. Well, here's the thing. Here's, here's my thing. I refuse to do another game jam. And I haven't even talked to Bobby about this, but this is the way it is in my mind right now.
779000	793000	I will not do another game jam until I finish this one. Period. So you all can do, I will not do another game jam until I finish this one. It's very important. I want to at least do it.
793000	796000	Finishing something is the hardest thing you can do.
796000	797000	It is.
797000	803000	Yeah. Since the last 10%, but I haven't even gotten to the last 10% yet. And so, yeah.
803000	812000	I'm hoping maybe in about a month when things calm down a little bit, because like, honestly, here's the, if I could have, and you know what's funny when Bobby and I were talking about this earlier, what should the day be?
812000	822000	What should the day be? The original time I had suggested was Martin Luther King weekend, which is this next weekend, because then Monday was off work and I could have spent that day playing all the submissions.
822000	829000	Well, now Alan and I are going to Seattle, so that wouldn't have worked either. But if I could have gotten two more weeks, somehow out of that, I could have finished.
829000	838000	So my personal goal is to try and finish it in two weeks. That's my goal, because obviously it won't happen this next weekend with Seattle and everything.
838000	847000	But now that things at work have calmed down significantly, I'm hoping in that next week I can finish it, because it's supposed to be a simple concept. So we'll see.
848000	849000	Here it is.
851000	865000	All right. Let's see. Going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com. Let's see. PushyPixels in chat says, that's not a great idea. You should do all the jams and make pong first. It helps.
865000	874000	No, I don't want to sound like I'm saying, I'm just saying for me personally, I feel awfully stupid endorsing this whole thing when I couldn't even finish myself.
874000	889000	But I do, I still feel like I accomplished something. I came out ahead, but it wasn't as much as I would have wanted to do. But I got a paycheck that keeps the show going. That's something that I accomplished.
890000	897000	Anyway. And yyr in chat says, the 80-20 rule, the last 20% of the game takes 80% of the effort. Isn't that the truth?
897000	907000	Well, god damn it. Considering the two that I've worked on, the first few percentages, that's taken a lot of effort, so I can't imagine what the last...
907000	921000	Yeah. We'll see. Maybe it depends on the way you did it. Let's see. And some folks in chat, some more comments. BlackWolf says, I learned a lot about the new UI in 4.6. So that's good.
921000	931000	And PushyPixels says, it's great you guys set this thing up. So thank you. Again, I'm loving that there's more participation than I really would have expected.
931000	942000	I honestly would have been blown away if we got three entries. I figured, okay, we'd probably have Bobby, yyr, and we'll have that fringe person I didn't know about that they'll actually end up submitting something.
942000	954000	Like that's what I figured would be the participation in the game jam. But to see all these other people too, and including, there's been more, there's been people that have said,
954000	963000	I listen to OLR, and I've never really participated with the show, but I wanted to do this. That was totally unexpected.
963000	969000	Well that didn't want to impress everybody, so I was like, well I can't just release this, I gotta do something cool.
969000	972000	See, that's the part where we get stuck.
972000	975000	It is, yeah, because I went back...
975000	986000	I wasn't afraid to put out a shitty game, because honestly if I could have finished the game that simple, and still is important, I want to finish, so that still is important to me, just to say I did it. I did this.
986000	996000	I made this in, because believe me, my first idea was to just do, oh I'll just do something in ZZT, that's my comfort zone, or I'll make something silly in Commodore 64 basic, that's my comfort zone.
996000	1002000	But then, Unity seemed more and more like something I could actually do, so there's that.
1002000	1011000	Anyway, I don't want to spend the whole show talking about coulda, woulda, shoulda, let's focus on the positive, is the fact that so many of these people participated.
1011000	1023000	I'm going to play all these games in the coming week, and I'm excited to. There's a really diverse, from what I'm seeing in the screenshots and the titles and emails, a lot of people interpreted that buggy game in various ways.
1023000	1033000	It seems like most people actually did games about bugs, but certainly it wasn't limited to that. We had, like, Bobby did a moon buggy type of game.
1033000	1044000	I saw something about a Tetris submission. Again, I haven't played it yet, but there's some type of Tetris submission that's supposed to be buggy, so I'm looking at that, so lots of neat stuff that I can't wait to play.
1045000	1053000	Alright, let's see, I would like to get into a couple other stories here. More to come on the Jam in the coming weeks.
1053000	1062000	We will not be here live next week, as I've mentioned a few times on the show, and there will actually be no show at all this next week because it's kind of our late holiday break.
1062000	1066000	We were here through the holidays, but we're going to take a break next week because I'm going to Seattle.
1066000	1073000	But in two weeks, we'll be back on the show, and I will give you all my impressions on all the games I played at that point.
1073000	1081000	So we'll revisit this Jam, at least here on OLR, in a couple weeks. I imagine Bobby will get around to playing everything. He's already played some of them, it sounds like.
1081000	1088000	He'll probably talk about his impressions on Bobby Blackwell's show next week when we're not here, so you have all that to look forward to.
1088000	1098000	They're not done talking about the VoG Jam just yet, and I know there's going to be more late entries too. It's not just me and Loki. I think YYR still wants to get involved there and so forth.
1098000	1100000	Yeah, go late Jam!
1100000	1102000	The late Jam!
1102000	1111000	Alright, let's talk about this. This is another kickoff topic I wanted to get into tonight before we get into our gaming weeks and so forth.
1111000	1116000	And this is that type of story that's been making the rounds on Facebook and Twitter and all that.
1116000	1129000	Because I've seen a similar story like this about a dude who goes into a Burger King and there's some screaming kid in there that's screaming about wanting to have a pie.
1129000	1136000	So what does he do? He buys all the pies so the little screaming, disobedient child can't have any. I know I've seen that story on Facebook before, right?
1136000	1138000	You guys all know that story I'm talking about? I know I've seen it.
1138000	1139000	Oh yes.
1139000	1149000	Yes, right? So this is something similar that happened that has to do with gaming. And there is a Nintendo fan out there that I don't believe has a name. I think his name is Harry. That's it.
1149000	1162000	Although, that's it. This bitter fan bought 100 Rosalina and Luma amiibo figures just so you couldn't.
1162000	1172000	So he bought all these Rosalina and Luma amiibos in bulk so that way they would be off shelves and that you couldn't have them.
1172000	1183000	The reason why? Quote, I do not appreciate Rosalina appearing in almost every recent Mario game to date. The fact Nintendo promotes her so much and people praise her is just disgusting.
1183000	1192000	I hate her fans too. I know for a fact her amiibo will be among one of the most popular which is why I took the time to wait and pre-order over 100 of her.
1192000	1200000	I do not want her fans to be happy. It just crushes me Nintendo from the good days went to this shit for character designs.
1200000	1214000	By the way, this person who has spent $4,000 so far is going to be buying more figures such as Lucina, Palutena, Robin, and Zero Suit Samus are also on the list.
1214000	1220000	Why do I just have a feeling that this guy has some sort of Nintendo sex dungeon that he's lined these all up on the walls for?
1220000	1225000	I mean, because I seriously, yes, I hate them so much. I put them up on my walls.
1225000	1238000	And I just happen to notice, just a casual observation, I don't know if y'all notice this too, I just happen to notice that all those characters this guy apparently has a hate boner for happen to be women.
1238000	1249000	Is that just a coincidence, right? It can't be that this guy hates women in video games. Surely that can't be it, right?
1249000	1251000	It pretty much stinks of misogyny.
1251000	1263000	Hmm. Hmm. Well, now here's another side of this, though, is that is this even real? I mean, because I'm of the mindset where I'm like, okay, it's cute and all that this is on Reddit and making the rounds, but I want to see the receipts.
1263000	1272000	I want to see I want to see your box full of 100 Rosalina and Luma dolls that's not sitting in the GameStop box, waiting to go on the shelf. I want to see
1272000	1273000	Where did he order them from?
1274000	1282000	Apparently Amazon or something like that, but I want to see in your hate dungeon. I want to see your 100 Rosalina. I want to see the receipts because I kind of don't buy this story.
1282000	1288000	Or I see you burning them because, you know, I get to see this guy, you know, buying a bunch of this stuff and flipping it.
1288000	1306000	Well, and the other thing is, what an idiot. I mean, not just for the reasons we've already talked about, but what a way to send a message to Nintendo that people just hate Rosalina by making sure she sells out.
1306000	1309000	What a way to send that message to Nintendo, you dumbass.
1309000	1326000	I'm sure those 100 features that you took off the shelves will be so hard to like manufacture in like a day or two. I mean, it's just, it's stupid. It's not affecting anybody. If you bought all of them, then that would be affecting something, but you bought 100. That's nothing.
1326000	1332000	Yeah, there's still a whole bunch of Rosalina amiibos on Amazon right now.
1332000	1333000	That's like a few cases.
1333000	1346000	And YYR says, you know, and is absolutely right, 100 units is barely a blip on the radar. So I think this thing really just kind of spread around because there's a lot of us kind of looking at this going, what a dummy, if it's even real. And again, I'm just questioning.
1346000	1355000	He's just creating an all female amiibo fight club is what he's doing. It's just getting, he's training them all. He's going to have them fight against each other.
1355000	1357000	Like actually train them in Super Smash Brothers?
1357000	1359000	Yes, they're all going to fight each other.
1359000	1374000	Which by the way, isn't now I don't profess to be a Smash Brothers expert, but my understanding is Rosalina is like top tier, right? Isn't Rosalina like a top tier Smash Brothers character right now? Like she's kind of really good in the game. I don't know. Anyway, let's see.
1375000	1386000	That's why I don't want to talk about this guy. He probably wants attention and he's getting it. Well, here's the nice thing. I haven't said his name. That name I did say was an alias that some of these websites have come up with.
1386000	1391000	So I don't know what this guy's name is, nor do I care to know and spread it around on the show.
1391000	1407000	And I think what he'll probably will do, look out for this, is that if he really did order a hundred of these, if he did, watch for the eBay posting by the Rosalina doll that the dude with the hate boner hat.
1407000	1416000	He'll try to, that's, isn't that the capitalist way to do it? He'll try to spin it and sell those things for a profit because that market is still out there.
1416000	1429000	Yeah, it's just like the people that, you know, back, you know, my son is grounded, so I'm selling his guitar hero controller and it sells for like $500 and it's like, so it's worth $10 selling for like $500.
1429000	1448000	Yeah. So anyway, I think we can all agree that this guy is a bit of a moron and, you know, unless, now if the goal out of this was to create a story, a fake story that would go viral, then congrats you won because here is the entire internet sharing it on Facebook and talking about it.
1448000	1466000	So if that was the goal, then good job. But, uh, I have a feeling there's probably like half a hint of truth to it. I think somebody out there really does have the hate boner for, um, all these female characters, which you probably need to have examined for a completely different reason related to buying all the amiibo.
1466000	1473000	But I, I don't, I don't believe that all the amiibo have been purchased. Just because they've been pre-ordered as well doesn't mean they've been purchased.
1473000	1485000	So just throwing it out there. But if you show me all the dolls lined up in your hate basement, then I guess we can have a conversation. Come on the show and let's, let's talk about it. Let's talk about your many issues if you'd like.
1485000	1496000	All right. Anyhow, uh, let's get into our gaming weeks, the types of video games we have been playing this week. Uh, let's go around the room and check in. Dark Soccer, what have you been playing this week?
1496000	1512000	Uh, Little Borderlands. Um, I've been playing, uh, Fractal. Um, I actually got back in Final Fantasy XIV and a little bit of Dragon Age. Um, I actually forced myself to play it when I had a raging headache, just because I hadn't played any in a few days.
1512000	1523000	I'm still putting off the, the heartbreaking step on my heart, rip it out, throw it across a cow field full of shit part of the game. Because-
1523000	1524000	No spoilers.
1524000	1525000	Because of my romance option.
1525000	1530000	Although I can kind of piece it together what's happening here. It's kind of, kind of obvious, but anyway.
1530000	1531000	Well, are you going to romance them?
1531000	1532000	Probably not.
1532000	1533000	Okay then.
1533000	1536000	Some of the listeners might be though.
1536000	1539000	Well, if, trust me, it's, it's-
1539000	1551000	I would think anyone that has that much care over it's probably already played through the game. That's my thought. But anyway, so there you go. Uh, Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?
1551000	1560000	Um, really all I played is, uh, just a little bit of, um, League of Marvel Superheroes. Just because my son wants me to play with him.
1560000	1567000	Although, the last few days while he's been playing I've been sleeping on the couch trying to catch up on some of my sleep.
1567000	1575000	But, uh, I did get a little bit of it in and I managed to get him to play a level so I could finally 100% that level.
1575000	1584000	But, how's he going to play it when he goes to bed so I can, you know, because I'm at 75% complete with the game so I'll just platinum it. It's super easy.
1584000	1589000	And then we'll be done with that. Well, as far as I'm concerned, I'll be done with it.
1589000	1592000	And then I was just working on my game job, so.
1592000	1593000	Yeah. Alright.
1593000	1601000	Uh, my gaming week was a little slow this week. Um, obviously, if I didn't have time to work on the project I didn't really have a lot of time to play games either.
1601000	1607000	So that really ended up being the case. I haven't played any role. There's one new game that I played this week and it's not really even a new game.
1607000	1612000	Uh, so what I will mention is that, uh, and some of you have probably seen this by now.
1612000	1617000	But, uh, Wednesday night after Horde House I finally gave in to all the people that are like,
1617000	1621000	Rob, when are you going to fucking play Five Nights at Freddy's and do the livestream?
1621000	1627000	So Shane came over and it took us like 30 minutes just to set up my other studio.
1627000	1634000	I have this studio here, N7, then I have the satellite studio that I actually do all my computer gaming in and livestreaming.
1634000	1641000	And I set that all up for the external sound which was harder to do than you'd think because I had to get it to be a decent volume.
1641000	1645000	So finally after 30 minutes of setting that up we were able to play a little bit of Five Nights at Freddy's.
1645000	1653000	So I finally played that game for the first time and it's all chronicled on YouTube, uh, over on my YouTube channel Rob Roberts Plays.
1653000	1658000	And did the game scare me? Yep. Yep. I got tricked into a couple jump scares.
1658000	1664000	Uh, that frickin' Chica or whatever her name is got me twice during the livestream.
1664000	1666000	And, uh, what a silly game.
1666000	1673000	But, you know, I gotta say, uh, an extraordinarily, I mean, this goes back to, you know, to bring it full circle with the game jam.
1673000	1676000	What an extraordinarily simple concept, really.
1676000	1684000	Um, you know, watching these security cameras and making sure that the monsters don't really get closer to your room.
1684000	1691000	Where you're, uh, where you're, um, you know, uh, gonna get eaten if they get to you and you don't shut the door or whatever in time.
1691000	1700000	The one thing I never really truly understood, the one thing I never really truly understood about the game was, what's the point of the cameras?
1701000	1704000	Because you just want to make sure they don't get in the doors.
1704000	1709000	So couldn't you just sit there the entire time and just check the lights, check the lights, check the lights.
1709000	1714000	And then finally, if you see somebody in the room, like, about to come in the room, just shut the door.
1714000	1718000	Like, I never really understood what the advantage is to cycling through the different cameras.
1718000	1721000	You don't really seem to slow them down or anything by doing that.
1721000	1723000	I don't think they can move when the camera's on them.
1723000	1728000	Yeah, but considering there's more than one, there's always at least one person that should be moving.
1728000	1730000	So why not always check the doors?
1730000	1741000	Now, I think there's something to do specifically with the Fox character, where starting on night three, he will run into your room and you may not have time to see him if you don't check the camera.
1741000	1750000	But one guy, and this is always interesting, depending on what game I stream, I sometimes get people that have no idea, you know, of the podcast I do or who I am.
1750000	1752000	Just people that like to watch streams of people playing the game.
1752000	1757000	And one guy came into the room and was like, yeah, all I ever do is I check Pirate's Cove, which is where Foxy hides out.
1757000	1760000	I go Cove, light, light, and just repeat.
1760000	1764000	That was my strategy and that's how I get all the way to like the end of night five.
1764000	1770000	And I'm like, well, that kind of makes the game a little silly at that point, doesn't it?
1770000	1772000	Like, it kind of takes all the point out of it.
1772000	1779000	So I just feel like, and I'm sure the chat room is yelling at me here, so I'm going to go to them in a minute here over at live.vognetware.com.
1779000	1786000	It just seems to me that, like, there's something wrong with the balance of the game if it's that easy.
1786000	1793000	But I don't know. But there is, I will say this, then Shane was trying to explain to me, oh, there's all this lore behind the game.
1793000	1801000	You got to go watch these game theory YouTubes about how it's all a parallel to this guy that killed all these people at a Chuck E. Cheese.
1801000	1804000	And then it leads into the second game and you find out all this stuff.
1804000	1808000	And I'm just like, wow, there is, like, people really read a lot into this game.
1808000	1812000	But it does seem like the designer has left little hints in the game.
1812000	1819000	Like, that game theory thing I watch does make an awful lot of sense, even if they backtrack on a lot of it when they talk about the second game.
1819000	1822000	But anyway, I didn't think it was very interesting.
1822000	1826000	Going to the chat room over at live.vognetware.com, VidPower says,
1826000	1830000	Foxy will run at you full speed if you don't check on the cameras on him.
1830000	1834000	Actf says, and Foxy is a must to watch for the camera.
1834000	1839000	Actf says, that's my strategy, although I do check the door cams just in case.
1839000	1842000	And the lore is actually quite fascinating.
1842000	1850000	Kaijuto says, if you use too much power, you are fucked, so you need to check the cams to make sure you use power when they're close.
1850000	1853000	Okay, but didn't the cams use power too?
1853000	1857000	I thought, or can you just unlimited use the camera? The cameras don't really use any power.
1857000	1859000	If that's the case, then that makes a little more sense.
1859000	1862000	And I thought, I thought that might have been it.
1862000	1867000	And Alan Alchemy in chat says, these are probably things they fixed in part two and three.
1867000	1871000	My understanding is that the mechanic is totally different in part two, that there is no door.
1871000	1876000	That there's just the front that they can, like, jump, but you put a mask on instead.
1876000	1881000	Like, they totally changed it in two, and I'm sure they'll change some of the basic stuff in three as well.
1881000	1883000	Well, because two's supposed to be a prequel, so.
1883000	1886000	Yeah, well, but again, that's never really explicitly stated.
1886000	1887000	Yeah, it is.
1887000	1888000	That's just the whole game theory stuff.
1888000	1891000	No, it's the date on the check. Remember, the unit said that in game theory.
1891000	1892000	Oh, alright, alright, alright.
1892000	1894000	Your paycheck's a different date.
1894000	1897000	So that's only if you beat it that you really find that out, that it's prequel.
1897000	1898000	Yeah.
1898000	1899000	There's that.
1899000	1900000	Alright.
1900000	1903000	And then Act F says, no, cams do drain the energy.
1903000	1905000	That was the, the cams don't drain the energy?
1905000	1906000	I thought, alright, anyway.
1906000	1910000	Why don't we just shut down some of the cameras and, like, put the energy.
1910000	1914000	How about we just shut down all the cameras, put all the energy into the doors, and done.
1914000	1917000	So, you know what, I will say this much.
1917000	1920000	As much as it sounds like I'm talking negative about the game, I'm really not.
1920000	1924000	I'm just biased because I don't really like the jump scare stuff because I'm such a baby.
1924000	1928000	But I will say this, you know, massive kudos to the developer because, as I understand,
1928000	1935000	it's just one guy with a pretty crazy simple concept that I'm sure is making buku bucks.
1935000	1939000	This, this thing, well, maybe not a ton of ton of it, but it's always, like, number one
1939000	1944000	on the iOS store for iPad and all that stuff.
1944000	1947000	I know he's doing well there and I see a ton of let's plays on this on Steam and stuff.
1947000	1953000	He's got to be doing well with this game with what is a pretty simple idea fleshed out.
1953000	1955000	So, good for him. Good for him.
1955000	1956000	And people...
1956000	1959000	It'll be 100% better whatever Miyamoto's coming up with with his Project Watch.
1959000	1963000	I'm telling you, it's like one dude making this game.
1963000	1968000	I can tell it's going to be way better than watching Rob the Robot storm something.
1968000	1970000	I don't know.
1970000	1974000	Rob the Robot could be really creepy in a Five Nights at Freddy's game.
1974000	1976000	You never know. You never know.
1976000	1980000	Alright, so you think that's what Miyamoto's working on as a Five Nights at Freddy's ripoff?
1980000	1983000	Because I'm sure those are all incoming.
1983000	1989000	Just like the Minecraft ripoffs, now that Five Nights at Freddy's is number one on the iOS store,
1989000	1995000	I'm sure it's just a matter of time if it's not already happening before all the poorly made knockoffs start flowing in.
1995000	1999000	You know, three nights at Thelma's.
1999000	2004000	I'm sure all these freaking knockoffs are just about to happen.
2004000	2006000	Three Thursdays at Thelma's.
2006000	2008000	Alright.
2008000	2010000	Five Tuesdays with Maureen.
2010000	2012000	That's kind of dark.
2012000	2017000	Alright, let's get into, now that we're done with our gaming week, some quick housekeeping.
2017000	2020000	Follow us on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
2020000	2023000	We're also on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
2023000	2028000	And as a reminder, there is no show at all next week, January 18th.
2028000	2031000	We are taking the week off. A late holiday break.
2031000	2038000	But a happy Martin Luther King observance day to those of you in the States, because we'll be missing that.
2038000	2041000	And maybe see some of you in Seattle.
2041000	2047000	I don't know how many listeners we have up there, but if any are up there, I will be in your neighborhood.
2047000	2050000	Yes, even when it's not PAX.
2050000	2052000	But I love Seattle.
2052000	2055000	I've been there a few times. You know, we all went to Seattle.
2055000	2059000	That was the one road trip we all took together, although it was really a fly trip.
2059000	2061000	There was a limo involved.
2061000	2063000	That's right, there was a limo involved.
2063000	2065000	That was our diva trip to PAX.
2065000	2067000	That was a really fun time, though.
2067000	2075000	That wasn't just us. That was when we were with the All Games Network and there was really kind of a convergence of all those indie podcasters there at PAX.
2075000	2079000	You know, Bobby was involved, too, and a lot of other people with the network. That was a lot of fun.
2079000	2081000	So we had some great Seattle memories of that.
2081000	2087000	And then I went five years ago, funny enough, with Grandpa from Hoard House.
2087000	2093000	And this was long before his persona on that show was established and any of that before he was a podcaster and all that.
2093000	2096000	We went to Seattle together and had a great old time.
2096000	2101000	So I'm looking forward to going back and going to all the tourist traps and all the fun stuff.
2101000	2104000	But I'm going to tell you what, that football game better not get in the damn way.
2104000	2109000	Because that's something I realized last night is, oh shit, the Seahawks are in the playoffs now.
2109000	2114000	Which I'm happy for. I've been everything, but it's going to make the town crazy on Saturday.
2114000	2116000	No thank you. No thank you.
2116000	2123000	Alright, so no show. We will be back with a show two weeks from tonight on January 25th.
2123000	2133000	Hopefully for those of you that have a little podcast void next week, I hope you will fill the time with some other hardworking indie podcasters out there.
2133000	2137000	Of which there are lots and lots and lots of hardworking folks out there that will have shows for you next week.
2137000	2138000	So check them out.
2138000	2143000	Alright, let's get into some gaming news and what has been going on in the industry this week.
2143000	2150000	Not as busy of a week as we were expecting coming off of the holiday, but still a few big stories here and there nonetheless.
2150000	2151000	Starting with Loki.
2151000	2159000	Yes, so PlayStation Now is starting up a subscription program, which is kind of cool.
2159000	2163000	I mean, since the pricing of it was really ridiculous in the first place.
2163000	2171000	Although it is a little bit on the pricey side, so don't give up your membership to Gamefly anytime soon.
2171000	2177000	But apparently you can choose from some different subscription plans, including one month for $19.99.
2177000	2182000	Or three months for $14.99, which ends up being about $15 a month.
2182000	2188000	And with that you get basically unlimited streaming for all the games that are on the service.
2188000	2191000	So I think they have about 100 right now.
2191000	2194000	So it's all of them, not just select games. That's pretty rad.
2194000	2197000	Yeah, it's all of them. All you can play.
2197000	2204000	It's cool, I guess, if you really can dedicate a lot of time to get your money's worth out of it.
2204000	2211000	But I think it sounds like a great deal, but how much are you really going to be playing each month?
2211000	2214000	For $15 a month, that's pretty expensive.
2214000	2220000	I don't know, just imagine spending that on Steam games. You'd probably get a lot further with your money.
2220000	2232000	I'm of a couple mindsets about this. I actually think this is the feature a lot of people have been asking for.
2232000	2239000	I think some people are struggling with the price, so you really have to ask, is it a fair price?
2239000	2242000	I have a hard time hating on the price, honestly.
2242000	2249000	Games are always going to be a little more expensive than movies, so that's why it's about twice the cost of Netflix.
2249000	2254000	Twice the cost of Netflix, isn't it? Not even that, though. I'm kind of okay with that.
2254000	2263000	Because, yes, there's a place for Gamefly too. Gamefly can do more things, and comparable services.
2263000	2265000	Here's my thing.
2265000	2271000	The immediacy of what this is going to be able to provide is that you will not have to wait.
2271000	2277000	If you want to play any game in this virtual library right now, you're going to be able to do that.
2277000	2282000	That's hard to hate. I do think there's a lot of value with that.
2282000	2290000	The fact that, yeah, you're paying for this, but that's going to be 150 games right now, whenever you want.
2290000	2299000	The only thing that's a little bit of a negative is it's 150 games, of which maybe 10 are good and 140 are filler.
2299000	2303000	That's a little more of the concerning part.
2303000	2307000	One positive I see is that, one, you can play that on your PlayStation 4.
2307000	2312000	A lot of these, you can't play PlayStation 3 games on your PlayStation 4, so it gives you that.
2312000	2318000	But just looking at the titles that they have on there, a lot of these I already have in my PlayStation Plus library.
2318000	2322000	So if you have a PlayStation 3, it's kind of like, why do you need this?
2322000	2331000	Because PlayStation Plus, if you've had it for a while and have gotten these games, like I know Infamous I got from the whole PlayStation Network deal.
2331000	2335000	Red Faction Collection, I've had, god, those games have been so cheap.
2335000	2342000	Darksiders I've gotten before. Saints Row 2, Bioshock Infinite.
2342000	2348000	I mean, there's a ton of these games I already have, so it wouldn't make any sense for me to do this service.
2348000	2356000	And I think if you boil it down to what you want to actually play, you can probably go buy these games cheaper.
2356000	2363000	You won't get hundreds of games, but you can probably go out there and buy these games you use for a lot cheaper than paying $15 a month.
2363000	2366000	You get a game a month or something, or a couple of games a month.
2366000	2378000	Now, Bobby's being very adamant in chat and is showing the receipts here by linking to this list here from the PlayStation forums about how it is not everything that's on the service now.
2378000	2385000	There is a distinctive list between what you can rent and what is actually included when you subscribe to all games.
2385000	2395000	Such as, for example, I notice, I'm just looking at the list real quick, Final Fantasy XIII is on both lists, but XIII-2 is not included in the subscription list.
2395000	2399000	So, there's that. I mean, there are some games that are missing.
2399000	2411000	So now, now that further refines the question, I think, to, you know, is the $15 a month or whatever worth it for these specific games?
2411000	2418000	And you really have to kind of look at that list of what's available and say, do I want to be able to play these all for a month for $15?
2418000	2422000	And here's the other thing that's about that, too, is if you notice, like, I'm...
2422000	2425000	Whatever it is. Sorry, maybe not $15. What was the amount again? $18?
2425000	2430000	It was $19.99 a month for $24.99 for three months.
2430000	2433000	Okay, then is this worth $20 for a month?
2433000	2437000	I just think it's not, just because of the amount of...
2437000	2442000	First off, the amount of stuff that they've already given away for free on PlayStation Plus.
2442000	2445000	So, if you're like me and you just grab everything regardless of...
2445000	2450000	Because I had a Vita at one time, I still grab stuff for the Vita, because someday I may get a Vita again.
2450000	2452000	I just want to have that stuff in my library.
2452000	2462000	So, I've got a ton of these between this and my Xbox, you know, games with gold stuff and with my Steam library, which has got most of these games already.
2462000	2468000	There's not much for me to play on this, and on top of that, I just...
2468000	2473000	I don't know, I just don't see it being worthwhile to pay that kind of fee.
2473000	2481000	I'll notice, or I did notice that there are no EA games on that list, because those are part of that, you know, EA package thing that you pay $30 a year.
2481000	2487000	And, hey, $30 a year doesn't sound so bad now when you compare it to $19.99 a month.
2487000	2491000	Well, but again, it's what games, because I'm sure the EA list is much more...
2491000	2495000	And if you're not a sports game fan, that's even less.
2495000	2500000	Yeah, true. I would just look at what games you want to play and what games they're offering.
2500000	2507000	And honestly, you might be better off just saying, okay, hey, if there's only like a handful of games you want to play, go buy them.
2507000	2509000	I mean, because you might end up, or rent them.
2509000	2518000	Here's the thing, though, is that, you know, as well, and I'm trying to kind of remain a little bit hopeful about this, is that, okay, maybe that's the way this looks now.
2518000	2527000	But surely Sony plans to add to this, you know, and we know that PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 1, these are things that Sony wants to be able to offer on PlayStation Now.
2527000	2531000	It's things they've talked about being available on PlayStation Now that we haven't seen yet.
2531000	2532000	I want to see...
2532000	2537000	So I imagine in the next year, this will be further enhanced with PS1 and PS2 games, which would be great.
2537000	2538000	Well, that's cool.
2538000	2539000	Especially if there's trophy support.
2539000	2547000	That's cool and all, but what I would like to see is just my fucking games that I have in my library being able to be streamed over PlayStation Now.
2547000	2552000	Because I see Saints Row 4 on there, I see Saints Row 2, I see, you know, Darksiders.
2552000	2553000	And these are games you bought digitally.
2553000	2558000	These are games that I have, well, I didn't buy them, but they're games that they gave to me, you know, digitally, so...
2558000	2559000	Oh, oh, alright.
2559000	2564000	You know, Saints Row III are just all these different games on here.
2564000	2570000	I would love to be able to play those on my PlayStation 4 instead of having to, you know, break out the PlayStation 3 to play these games.
2571000	2577000	Since you obviously can stream that, and it's obviously tied to the PlayStation Network, so don't tell me you can't tell that,
2577000	2581000	oh, I'm sorry, our systems don't talk to each other, you know, we can't figure out what you purchased.
2581000	2583000	I would like to see some of that, that would be great.
2583000	2591000	But I would, I do also think that, you know, if you look at something like Netflix, where all the license and rights semantics aside,
2591000	2596000	because I know Netflix used to have more on it that they don't have because, you know, it's like an EA thing, right?
2596000	2598000	Where they wanted to go off and make their own thing.
2598000	2604000	But, you know, Netflix has now been enhanced with things like Orange is the New Black and, you know, kind of their own programming.
2604000	2608000	So I'm curious to see what Sony's going to enhance this with in the future.
2608000	2615000	Maybe right now this doesn't look like the most attractive deal, although again, I suppose it depends on what sort of PS3 games you're into.
2615000	2627000	I don't know, I have to admit, for 20 bucks, being able to play it on demand, eh, there is a lot in this list I think I could probably get 20 bucks worth out of at least for one month.
2628000	2640000	Would I do a continuing thing? Not right now, but I'd be very curious to see what Sony might do month to month to make people that jump on early on want to stay subscribed.
2640000	2643000	And that could even be things like exclusives.
2643000	2652000	I wouldn't shut the door on the fact that Sony might offer something exclusive to folks on PlayStation Now that maybe you can't get anywhere else.
2652000	2661000	That could be the PlayStation 1 and 2 games, because right now they're not selling 1 and 2 games on the PlayStation 4 save VIB, no, not even Vibram is on 4 yet.
2661000	2666000	You had to buy that on 3. So, it'd be interesting.
2666000	2679000	I don't know, I'm not jumping into this yet, because like I said, I've got my Steam library, and I've got libraries that are starting to get to the size of Steam on the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Marketplace.
2679000	2683000	So, I just don't need extra games.
2683000	2690000	yyrinchat says, I think it's most worth it to people that never owned a PS3 or an Xbox 360.
2690000	2694000	It's worth noting that many of the subscription games are not PlayStation 3 exclusives.
2694000	2703000	He brings up a good point. There are a lot of people that kind of skipped the last generation or owned a Nintendo Wii in their household who might be PS4 owners now.
2703000	2707000	So, that's an interesting point. Could be a catch-up type of thing.
2707000	2718000	Brad from Pod Culture says, make it $15 a month, include Plus as a part of it, and I would be sold. More like an Amazon Prime model.
2718000	2729000	I don't think Sony would put it that low. I suppose anything's possible, but I like that idea of one package for both, and surely Sony's got to be thinking it too.
2729000	2738000	Like, what about a PlayStation Plus Plus? What would you call that? PlayStation Plus Gold, or PlayStation Plus Platinum, something like that.
2738000	2744000	Where maybe you have a Plus account that's further enhanced with this, that's a package deal. I'm sure that's something they've got to be thinking.
2744000	2751000	I just don't think it's ever going to get that low. I mean, it'd be great if it could. I'm just being realistic.
2751000	2757000	You know, no one would get me to maybe get in on that. They do their own version of, like, Game Room.
2758000	2765000	Oh, don't get me started. Don't get me started. Bad memories. Bad memories. I'm so upset. Alright, anyhow.
2765000	2769000	So, there you go. What if Nintendo did that, with all their virtual console games?
2769000	2776000	Oh my god, they should. Oh my god, they're sitting on a gold mine. They could totally do that, but then again, Nintendo's making pretty good money just selling piecemeal right now.
2776000	2779000	Well, yeah, they're selling ROMs for $5 a piece.
2779000	2785000	People aren't demanding it from Nintendo the same way they have been of Sony.
2786000	2793000	They do a little bit. I'm not saying people don't demand that from Nintendo, but Nintendo also doesn't have the streaming thing. That's the big difference.
2793000	2797000	PlayStation's now doing the streaming thing and is selling these individual stream games.
2797000	2807000	And so people, you know, because we all know Netflix and Amazon Prime and Hulu and all that stuff, people think, well, I'm used to paying one fee to access all that.
2807000	2812000	Why is PlayStation using a different model? So I think that's how Nintendo's been able to avoid it a little bit.
2812000	2816000	Even if Nintendo can stream a virtual console game, there's like a few megs.
2816000	2822000	Like on any internet, even crappy DSLers, it's like, okay, let's buffer that. Oh, done. Games downloaded.
2822000	2830000	I'm actually not disagreeing with you, but I also feel like there's more that Nintendo could do to virtual console that they're not doing, such as internet play.
2831000	2842000	I still do that because those are such low, you know, little itty bitty ROMs. I still, I don't know why this is not a thing.
2842000	2851000	And I've said this on the show before. Why don't you have games that are two player games that you can play against each other?
2851000	2858000	Like, I don't know, what are some big NES classics that were like head to head? Like the original Mario Brothers even, right? It was kind of a head to head game, right?
2858000	2867000	Why can't you have that where you're playing it on the TV and on the gamepad, you can see video of the person you're playing against?
2869000	2871000	How hard? Privacy.
2871000	2880000	Okay, but make it friends. You only get, make it, if you're playing with strangers, it's an avatar. And if you're playing with friends, it's video. Done.
2880000	2882000	No.
2882000	2883000	Why not?
2883000	2884000	I wouldn't want to be on video.
2884000	2885000	Who cares? It's fine.
2886000	2890000	Then shut it off. Make it optional. You don't have to stream video, but you can.
2890000	2896000	It's probably because they don't have a way to like, they don't have a very good system as far as being able to play with friends on things.
2896000	2907000	I mean, Mario Kart, I mean, they have it, it seemed like for me, at least on the Wii, because I don't have a Wii U, that it was very much like each game kind of handled that differently as far as being able to play with your friends.
2907000	2912000	So, maybe they just don't have a good system, or they don't have a system in place for that.
2912000	2917000	I mean, I don't think you can start up like a party like you can on PlayStation or Xbox.
2917000	2922000	Start up a party with people and they're okay, we're gonna launch, you know, this game.
2922000	2930000	We're gonna launch, you know, Mario Kart or something and it boots into that with everybody joining the game and, you know, all playing together.
2930000	2940000	YYR in chat says, don't worry, Nintendo will catch up to Xbox 360 PS3 as far as network features by the time the next generation of consoles is released.
2940000	2942000	I look forward to it.
2942000	2947000	YYR also says, hey kid, send me a friend code if you want to see my dick. I guess there's that.
2947000	2953000	But, I mean, at some point you have to put the onus for that not on the company, but on the predator.
2953000	2957000	And I understand that Nintendo had some issues with that and that's why they shut off PictoChat.
2957000	2963000	But at the same time, how hard is it, you know, hey kid, let me get your cell phone number and I'll text you pictures of my dick.
2963000	2968000	Or, hey kid, how about your Skype name? And, you know, we can look at dicks.
2968000	2972000	Yeah, in PictoChat, they have to draw pictures of their dick, so it was a little bit more difficult.
2972000	2977000	Well, you could actually send pictures in PictoChat, remember? Because I always used to send pictures of the cat.
2977000	2981000	No, that wasn't PictoChat. That was the other one, Swap Note.
2981000	2986000	Oh, sorry. Swap Note was the thing they disabled. That was the thing I missed.
2986000	2990000	Swap Note was awesome, and I sent 3D pictures of the cat all the time to my friend list.
2990000	2997000	But see, that's the thing though, it's like PictoChat. That was a brilliant, brilliant idea for, like, the DS.
2997000	2999000	Everybody at Expos, I went to her.
2999000	3002000	It's like this moment of brilliance, and then it's like they don't ever do anything with it.
3002000	3007000	It's just like, hey, this is a really great idea. Cool, keep having those.
3007000	3008000	I know, I know.
3008000	3011000	It's like, well, just don't stop now.
3011000	3012000	I know.
3012000	3020000	My point is, is that Nintendo, I understand Nintendo's really, really, really overcautious about, you know, their image in the media,
3020000	3027000	and they don't want the media reporting on these things about, like, you know, all these dicks we're seeing on a child's 3DS in the Swap Note application,
3027000	3032000	but it's like, well, check the kid's phone. It's probably there too. Check the kid's email.
3032000	3041000	I mean, unfortunately, we need to focus on getting this act of predators doing this to children to stop.
3041000	3042000	You know what I mean?
3042000	3048000	They're going to find a way to do it no matter what, you know, it's going to be cell phones or Nintendo.
3048000	3053000	That's not the core issue.
3053000	3057000	Maybe if people would stop supporting sensationalized news reporting.
3057000	3060000	There is that too. There is that too. Anyhow.
3062000	3068000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase IDEA.
3068000	3074000	Alright, let's move on. We've got to talk about some other things, and this is actually some pretty big news from Nintendo this week.
3074000	3084000	By the way, speaking of things Nintendo swore up and down they would never do, and now we're seeing them dip their toe in the water with this, kinda.
3084000	3091000	This was some very surprising, very big news that came out this week, and you might have missed it because it has to do with cell phone gaming.
3091000	3097000	You might have just glossed it over and not paid it any attention, but I'm telling you, this is huge.
3097000	3102000	There's a game series out there you may or may not have played. It's available on iPhones and Androids and all that.
3102000	3107000	It's called Puzzle and Dragons. I think this game's awful. I've tried playing it. I think it's stupid.
3107000	3114000	I think there's far better games out there on the mobile phones. I would rather play Trivia Crack, honestly, which is also kind of stupid.
3115000	3121000	That is a game I've also been playing this week, by the way. A lot of Trivia Crack. But it's a good micro game.
3121000	3128000	It's a good game you can play for five seconds, then move on, right? I'm not a big fan of Puzzle and Dragons, but I can't deny this game is huge.
3128000	3135000	It's kind of like Bejeweled meets Pokemon. I'm really oversimplifying it, but that's kind of what it is.
3136000	3150000	This game series is really big in Japan. Apparently, in some of the Asian regions, it's even bigger than it is here. It's a huge deal.
3150000	3163000	And GungHo is the company that actually creates this game. Well, GungHo has actually announced that there is going to be a Super Mario edition of Puzzle and Dragons.
3164000	3179000	It's going to be on the 3DS in Japan this April. But I still think there's something very interesting here, where you've got Nintendo partnering up with a company that is most well-known for cell phone gaming.
3179000	3183000	Granted, it's being made for the 3DS, but like I said, it's the big toe.
3183000	3199000	But they did something similar, though. It wasn't that. It was the Square Enix, almost like a Mario Party-type game. But they teamed up with them to do a version of that with Mario.
3200000	3215000	Now, as far as an American release, even though in the original announcement, GungHo America said it would be happening through Nintendo, a Nintendo spokesperson told another outlet that Puzzle and Dragons Super Mario Bros. Edition is a Japanese-only announcement.
3215000	3218000	So right now, the America release of this is still in flux.
3218000	3220000	Yeah, until they announce it at E3.
3220000	3232000	Right. The Match 3 game has local multiplayer and StreetPass functionality. By the way, the original Mobile Puzzle and Dragons has 6 million downloads in North America.
3232000	3233000	Wow, that's a lot.
3233000	3235000	Is it because it's free?
3235000	3236000	Yes, I'm sure.
3236000	3241000	Oh my god! There's 6 million downloads of a free game! That's unheard of! Oh, wait.
3241000	3244000	I'm one of those downloads and I deleted it a long time ago.
3244000	3254000	Yeah, of course. There's no way to lose in that scenario. You try it, you hate it, then you delete it. It's not that impressive.
3254000	3267000	Now, there has been a Puzzle and Dragons already released for 3DS. This Puzzle and Dragons Z that had 1.5 million units sold in Japan. That's still pretty good. This is the first time that they're involving the Mario stuff.
3267000	3272000	Just to say, Act F to say Fortune Street is the game you're trying to think of?
3272000	3273000	Yes, that was the game I was thinking of. Fortune Street.
3273000	3286000	And Rama says Puzzle and Dragons is pretty fun. They actually have a DC Comics version of that game. I guess that makes sense because Marvel has the Puzzle Quest thing, so it's DC lined up with somebody else. Very interesting.
3286000	3304000	So, we will see. Also, of note, apparently Nintendo's stock really liked, the investors really liked this news. The stock went way, way, way up at the end of the week this week after that announcement came up.
3304000	3312000	But, they're not making a mobile game. They're putting a mobile game onto the 3DS. That's dumb. That's like putting Angry Birds on the 3DS.
3312000	3320000	I think because people are looking at this going, Nintendo's partnering with a mobile phone company. If this game's successful, could the reverse happen?
3320000	3333000	They're not and they won't because there's been several mobile games that have been popular that have come to the 3DS and that's it. People will buy it because there's Mario in it. That's it.
3333000	3347000	I mean, you know, just like Angry Birds, still okay. Doodle Jump kind of. But, it's not news. If they were going to put out that version on mobile, that would be a big story. This is just kind of like, eh, whatever.
3347000	3356000	Well, it'll be interesting to see if that happens later on. I don't think it's outside the realm of all possibility and I think that's why investors are really taking to this news.
3356000	3364000	Is that if GungHo is going to be spending the time making this game, that perhaps it will be something on mobile devices. And that could be huge. Huge!
3365000	3373000	Because all we have Nintendo-wise on mobile devices right now is what? A Pokédex? Which, the Pokémon company is a second party, so it's a little different.
3373000	3381000	Yeah, they won't because it's going to cheapen their brand if they put it out as a free-to-play game. That's the way they see it.
3381000	3387000	Alright, well we will see what develops. I still think this is a pretty big news, all things considered.
3387000	3389000	DarkStalker, what do you have for us?
3389000	3396000	Well, I've been a little bit lax in some of my UK news as of late, so I do have something for our folks overseas.
3396000	3406000	The BBC is actually looking for developer studios to do video games based on some of its more popular series.
3406000	3415000	They are visiting a London Mobile Games event later on in this month to look for developers.
3415000	3425000	They want to do things for Doctor Who and Sherlock. They also are wanting to look into some of the past and future IPs as well.
3425000	3435000	They're going to be doing two breakfast sessions on Tuesday, January 20th and Wednesday, January 21st, both between 9 to 10 AM.
3435000	3443000	And they're informal, they just want to meet people, and it's going to be held at BBC Worldwide at 33 Foley Street, London.
3443000	3452000	So if any of our developer friends happen to be over there, let us know how that goes. We want to know.
3452000	3457000	I have something else for our British fans too.
3457000	3458000	What?
3458000	3461000	I need you all to vote for Michelle Visage to win Celebrity Big Brother.
3461000	3463000	Oh my god, Rob.
3463000	3471000	No, this is very important. I need you all to vote for Michelle Visage, and I know you all don't like Katie Hopkins, and I completely understand why,
3471000	3478000	but if she's the only one that's going to put that little celebrity blogger, I won't even say his name because it offends me,
3478000	3486000	if she's the only one that will put that guy in his place, then I think you should keep her around too, as disgusting as a lot of the stuff is that she says outside the house.
3486000	3488000	But at the end of the day, Michelle Visage should win.
3488000	3495000	Just a very important note, this is a life or death scenario that I need our British listeners to get involved with.
3495000	3496000	Rob. Rob.
3496000	3497000	What?
3497000	3498000	Rob. Rob. Rob.
3498000	3510000	What? What? Oh, oh, oh. You can all wank about Doctor Who and Sherlock and the potential games, but heaven forbid I bring up the British show I like and.
3510000	3525000	No, I was like, I was like, I want them to do a Top Gear racing game, but with like all of the commentary done by Jeremy What's His Face, because he's so dry and funny.
3525000	3532000	He'd like make comments like, you know, just how badly people drift and stuff. I just want nothing but a game of him shitting on the player.
3532000	3536000	Top Gear was a racing game. I used to love that game. It was on the Super Nintendo.
3536000	3542000	Then, of course, we talk about British narrators and I my mind, it goes instantly to Stephen Fry, who is also in the news this last week.
3542000	3549000	I'm sure you saw a little bit about that. That was that was interesting, although I don't think it's as big of a deal as people were making it out to be.
3549000	3558000	But whatever. Anyway, sorry, Jamie, I took a very legitimate game develop story and turn it into gossip, but, you know, it happens.
3561000	3564000	Let's move on with some more news, Loki.
3564000	3571000	So apparently the avatars on Xbox are going to be getting a makeover.
3571000	3576000	They're possibly going to be coming back, I guess, to the Xbox One.
3576000	3583000	And I don't know exactly. I guess they're going to show it off as part of like Windows 10 maybe.
3583000	3589000	And cool, I guess I saw my I have my 3D printed avatar.
3589000	3591000	So now that's not going to be accurate anymore.
3591000	3593000	I don't know. I don't know what I think about that.
3593000	3601000	And also, you know what, I'm kind of curious to see how that's going to look, because remember, I think they kind of showed something similar with was it Mass Effect three?
3601000	3603000	You know, like all the Mass Effect games got better and better.
3603000	3608000	But sometimes your character looked weirder and weirder as it like enhanced it.
3608000	3613000	If you know what I mean, because she's she's the one to ask about those mods and things like that.
3613000	3619000	That's pretty accurate. Like, you know, just like some of them I've seen, like, you know, hey, wait, I used to be a different skin color.
3619000	3622000	Oh, like how it would import look how big her eyes are.
3622000	3627000	Oh, yeah. The imports of your character from one into two were always awful.
3627000	3633000	And it's like Mike, like my character looked great in one. And then when I imported him into two, it was like, why is he so surprised?
3633000	3641000	And then why is like completely different for a lot of the subjects? They changed the they added more vertices in the facial structure.
3641000	3644000	I follow you now. Yeah. The import from game to game was horrible.
3644000	3650000	You were better off just recreating Shepard the way you wanted him or her to look in each game.
3650000	3653000	And I got to be honest, I got to be honest. You know what?
3653000	3657000	They're trying to make avatars a thing, but it's important and relevant. I'm so sorry.
3657000	3661000	I'm so sorry to interrupt. Important and relevant. The same thing is happening in World of Warcraft.
3661000	3668000	OK, because they took all the old characters. Right. And they they took like dwarves and humans and gave them new models. Right.
3668000	3675000	OK, I can tell you my character when they did that looks awful. Awful. Like, I hate the way she looks now.
3675000	3677000	I have to see if my character is any different.
3677000	3684000	Oh, so that's the one downside to these upgrades is that they're usually downgrades in high definition.
3684000	3696000	Yeah. Basically, they're saying that they're going to ensure that avatars are not only gorgeous, but also highly performant across a wide scale of devices and work with designers, animators and artists and blah, blah, blah.
3696000	3706000	You know, to be honest, any of the avatar kind of features I've seen didn't do a whole ton of the avatar stuff with the actual mainstream games.
3706000	3710000	I saw a lot of the stuff that supported avatars coming out of like the Xbox indie games.
3710000	3712000	Yeah, that's true.
3712000	3717000	And a lot of that seemed to be a little bit more interesting than, say, you know, the official stuff.
3717000	3725000	Yes, like the baby launching game that was on it. Wasn't it your avatar that was giving birth or something like that? Or were you the baby? I don't know.
3725000	3730000	I seem to remember avatars were in that baby launching game that was on the 360.
3730000	3731000	That's awesome, though.
3731000	3736000	Which next to Bungie ferret tossing is an all time great on the Xbox Live indie games.
3736000	3740000	There's lots of great indie games, but that's what I'm saying. I don't know.
3741000	3751000	I guess it's cool that they're coming back, but it's just it didn't really take off like the Miis did. And even the Miis are kind of stupid. Like, they shouldn't really upgrade those.
3751000	3757000	But the Miis are still around and they're very much used in a lot of the Nintendo games.
3757000	3759000	They're fighters in Smash Bros. Wii.
3759000	3760000	I understand that.
3760000	3762000	Or Smash Bros. for Wii U.
3762000	3769000	I understand that. And I would love to see an enhanced version, especially the ones where people make designs out of the parts to make different things on their faces and things.
3769000	3775000	Drawing penises and that kind of stuff. And then just having to try to translate that into something more realistic would be hilarious.
3775000	3781000	All right. Well, speaking of Nintendo and games that will probably incorporate the Miis one way or another.
3781000	3790000	Star Fox for Wii U is a thing, and they are saying it will be playable at E3 2015, which I extract from that means it won't be out any sooner in Japan or the US.
3790000	3795000	So those hoping for a spring release for Star Fox, haha, looks like it's going to be more like holiday.
3795000	3803000	Now, Miyamoto didn't talk a lot about what, you know, Star Fox outside anything that was already said at the last E3 and in between there.
3803000	3808000	But it will utilize both the Wii U gamepad and the TV.
3808000	3815000	I would think that Wii U gamepad would be like a radar. Would make sense? I don't know. I mean, I don't know. Again, we'll see.
3815000	3817000	They're going to fly with tilt controls.
3817000	3818000	We'll see. We'll see.
3819000	3824000	Now, Miyamoto was also asked, when will we get a new F-Zero game?
3824000	3828000	First off, thank you somebody for confronting him and asking him. I appreciate that.
3828000	3831000	So he punched him in the face and flipped him off.
3831000	3840000	No, that's not what happened. What happened, Miyamoto said, they need to find the right controller interface for the game.
3840000	3846000	Why? Does your controller have buttons? Yes. Does your controller have a joystick? Yes.
3846000	3848000	You have the right interface for F-Zero.
3848000	3861000	Yeah, considering Mario Kart 8 was not just, if you've been listening to OLR, Mario Kart 8 was not only my favorite Wii U game last year, it was my favorite game period last year.
3861000	3869000	So I have a hard time understanding why a driving game like F-Zero could not be done on the Wii U.
3869000	3874000	Wow, that's a whole ton of, that's like a big, you know, heaping snow shovel full of bullshit right there.
3874000	3879000	I agree. Look, I love Miyamoto, but that's a bullshit answer.
3879000	3883000	This is why I need to interview these people. Remember how I interviewed, remember when I was talking to James?
3883000	3886000	So what do you think about it in the groove? You know, that kind of stuff.
3886000	3889000	So are you going to make a new F-Zero? We need to find the right controller.
3889000	3892000	I'd be like, I'm sorry, that doesn't make any fucking sense.
3892000	3895000	When you spend all this money on your controller, it has a fucking screen.
3895000	3898000	And you wonder why you don't get asked to do interviews with Miyamoto.
3898000	3903000	What about, you know, your controller has buttons. What else do you want in there?
3903000	3906000	Do you need a pedal so I can cycle my car around?
3906000	3910000	I have two mindsets of this. I have two mindsets of this.
3910000	3918000	One, that answer I don't accept because aren't they selling F-Zero on Virtual Console, like the original?
3918000	3921000	So there is an F-Zero game on Wii U.
3921000	3926000	Now I understand, you probably want to argue with me, well it's different in the controls because it's just emulated.
3926000	3932000	Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, I get that. But an F-Zero game exists on the Wii U, so you can't say it can't be done.
3932000	3937000	But here's the other thing I have with that, and that I think is the real answer.
3937000	3943000	I think, because obviously there is a successor to the Wii U being worked on right now,
3943000	3947000	and I'm not even talking about some of those other articles that have been around the internet this week and all that stuff.
3947000	3954000	It's just not only is Sony and Microsoft planning what's next, obviously Nintendo's planning what's next as well.
3954000	3964000	We all know that. So maybe something to do with controls, which certainly the same thing could be said about the Wii and the Wii U,
3964000	3970000	but maybe there's something else that Nintendo has in store for their next console,
3970000	3975000	that they're going to come out and have F-Zero as a launch title or as close to it,
3975000	3982000	that, oh, this was the better controls suited for F-Zero that Miyamoto was talking about a couple years ago.
3982000	3985000	Unless it's VR, I don't give a fuck what the hell he's talking about.
3985000	3992000	There's literally, unless part of the console is going to be that fucking cabinet that swivels around, I just don't care.
3992000	3997000	It doesn't make any sense that, oh, well, I'm sorry, we just don't have the right control scheme for that.
3997000	4003000	That makes no sense. That's, no. I'm sorry. I just don't buy that for a second.
4003000	4012000	YYR in chat with all caps says, the Wii U game pad literally has every control method ever conceived for use in a video game.
4012000	4020000	That is why I think what I just said there, the second half of that, I think that's what it is.
4020000	4027000	I think that there's not going to be an F-Zero on the Wii U because they're already planning it for the successor console,
4027000	4040000	which, to be fair, if the next Nintendo console is going to be equivalent of the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and perhaps even a small step above in power,
4040000	4051000	I think a, you know, blow your panties off, F-Zero, HD, neon, flashy, high-speed game could be awesome.
4051000	4055000	I think Akdeft has the right idea here. Powerglow 2.0.
4056000	4059000	And maybe that's just it. Maybe that's it. Powerglow 2.0. That's what it is.
4059000	4063000	You're just going to, you're going to grab that fake steering wheel and it's so bad.
4063000	4068000	All right, well, we'll see. All right, moving on. Dark Sakura.
4068000	4070000	Well.
4070000	4075000	How would you control your eraser and F-Zero? Dark Sakura?
4075000	4076000	Telepathy.
4076000	4082000	Ah. Maybe that's the new Nintendo console. You're going to control it with your mind.
4082000	4084000	I think things and they happen.
4084000	4085000	I would, you know.
4085000	4086000	I am a biotic god.
4086000	4095000	Honestly, I mean, I guess it was sort of like, I forget the game because I never actually played that one when I'd go to, was it the Virtual World?
4095000	4101000	But they had the Mars Racing game or whatever that was kind of like that. But I always played the Battletech ones.
4101000	4102000	I kind of fear.
4102000	4103000	But one of those would be cool.
4103000	4110000	I kind of fear Dark Sakura's Telepathy F-Zero game, though, because I just worry that, you know, people are going to walk in and it's going to be like,
4110000	4117000	Rob, why, why whenever you play F-Zero is it just it's not even racing. The camera's just panning around Captain Falcon's butt the whole time.
4117000	4118000	What is?
4118000	4123000	That wouldn't be me. No, no, no, no, no. That wouldn't. I'm not the Captain Falcon fangirl.
4123000	4129000	You'd be, you would walk in the house and be, I was thinking that, too.
4129000	4138000	For me playing that game, it would actually be telling other people how awful they drive and get off my road.
4139000	4142000	Coming to the Nintendo Wii U 2.
4142000	4144000	Dark Sakura's aggressive driver.
4144000	4147000	You need to play Grand Theft Auto 5. You can flip people off in the game.
4147000	4148000	When you're driving by.
4148000	4151000	But I don't like the Grand Theft Auto games.
4151000	4152000	You just haven't played the right one yet.
4152000	4153000	All right. Anyway.
4153000	4154000	You mean any of them?
4154000	4157000	Dark Sakura, sorry to derail you. Not sorry.
4157000	4159000	Pfft. Bitch. Okay.
4159000	4161000	Rob. Rob. Rob. Rob. Rob. Rob. Rob. Rob.
4161000	4162000	What?
4162000	4164000	Hearts.
4164000	4170000	So 3D Afterburner 2 is going to be coming out on Nintendo 3DS.
4170000	4171000	Yay.
4171000	4174000	On January 15th. Yay.
4174000	4176000	Thanks Sega for giving us a release date.
4176000	4180000	It's in the second batch of 3D classics.
4180000	4188000	Among others, we have 3D Fantasy Zone, 3D Outrun, 3D Fantasy Zone 2, and 3D Thunder Blade.
4188000	4190000	Which means I will have these.
4190000	4192000	Because. Fantasy Zone.
4192000	4198000	Fantasy Zone is the best Sega game ever.
4198000	4201000	I thought Space Harrier was the best Sega game ever.
4201000	4206000	What is my favorite 3 order of games?
4206000	4208000	Uh. The Guardian Legend.
4208000	4210000	Space Harrier.
4210000	4213000	Uh. Mass Effect.
4213000	4214000	Garrett.
4214000	4215000	Fantasy Zone.
4215000	4217000	And then Space Harrier.
4217000	4219000	I was going to say Final Fantasy 7.
4219000	4220000	No.
4220000	4223000	But only the scene where Aerith gets stabbed. Over and over again.
4223000	4225000	Did you see what got put on my Facebook?
4225000	4226000	Yes.
4226000	4228000	It was the Aerith sword sharpener.
4228000	4229000	Yes I did.
4229000	4230000	I need one of those for real.
4230000	4231000	I did.
4231000	4232000	They just need to make those.
4232000	4237000	I want someone to get like the little guy who is like the knife holder and have it be turned into Aerith.
4237000	4242000	So Dark Sakura talking about Afterburner. I have it.
4242000	4245000	And this is how F-Zero can fit in the picture too. You ready?
4245000	4247000	World exclusive here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4247000	4251000	I have deduced based on Miyamoto's comments and Dark Sakura's mouth.
4251000	4254000	I have deduced. Because she has telepathy powers. Remember?
4254000	4255000	I have deduced.
4255000	4257000	It's because I'm psycho and have ESPN.
4257000	4262000	I have deduced what it will be on the Wii U too. You ready? You ready?
4262000	4264000	It's going to be a chair.
4264000	4268000	And the chair can go 360 degrees.
4268000	4272000	Just like the Afterburner cabinets. Right?
4272000	4273000	Where you can flip upside down.
4273000	4277000	And the F-Zero cabinets. Which were badass.
4277000	4282000	It's going to be a chair that will flip upside down and drop you on your ass.
4282000	4287000	Can we get like a long winded Peter Molyneux video where they're talking about,
4287000	4296000	you know, up until now we've never considered about the crucial aspect of playing video games.
4296000	4298000	Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Where is he?
4298000	4300000	Where is Peter Molyneux right now?
4300000	4303000	Because somebody needs to check and make sure he's not in Nintendo headquarters.
4303000	4306000	And if he's there, he needs to be removed from the building.
4306000	4308000	He needs to be against a white backdrop.
4308000	4311000	Because, you know, it's just like him talking with his name in the bottom there.
4311000	4314000	Just talking about how essential the chair is.
4314000	4316000	I don't know. It's just...
4316000	4318000	It's going to be something stupid.
4318000	4321000	It's going to be like, we came up with this brand new controller.
4321000	4327000	You take this little, you know, it's a ball on a string and you swing it around to go faster and you move it.
4327000	4328000	It's going to be crap.
4328000	4329000	It's going to be crap.
4329000	4333000	If Peter Molyneux is in a partnership with Nintendo, I will shut off the press conference.
4333000	4336000	Because, you know, I ain't getting invited. So I will shut off the press conference.
4336000	4338000	When he walks up, I'll just shut it off.
4338000	4341000	I hope that they would do a new, like, Virtual Boy.
4341000	4344000	But, I don't know, VR...
4344000	4346000	But, see, that's the one thing.
4346000	4350000	It's like, if you wait too long, people are just going to do it better.
4350000	4351000	Alright, we'll see.
4351000	4354000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
4354000	4356000	Although, I think, again, we're in a slow period of the year.
4356000	4358000	There's probably not a lot to talk about.
4358000	4362000	Let's check in anyway and see what will be released in a store near you soon.
4365000	4366000	Nothing.
4366000	4368000	Nothing in the US this week.
4368000	4371000	Yeah, unfortunately not until, I think, the end of this month.
4371000	4376000	Unless, you know, I haven't seen any new announcements of things.
4376000	4381000	But, yeah, I don't think anything is coming out of here physically until, like, the 27th.
4382000	4386000	Well, believe it or not, it's a pretty similar story over in Japan.
4386000	4390000	There are some releases coming up on the 20th of January.
4390000	4391000	But that's not this week.
4391000	4392000	Oh, wait, no, I lied.
4392000	4394000	There is one release I found for this week.
4394000	4395000	You ready?
4395000	4400000	It's Bioshock Infinite, the complete edition for the PlayStation 3 in Japan.
4400000	4402000	That is out on the 15th of January.
4402000	4405000	So, there's one game to look forward to this week.
4405000	4409000	Which is really just a repackaging of a game that's been out for a while.
4409000	4412000	Actually, it's not the 27th, it's the 20th.
4412000	4414000	And that would be that Saints' Rogue, Gad out of Hell.
4414000	4416000	Which I am totally interested in playing.
4416000	4419000	Despite the fact that the last two Saints' Rogue games pissed me off.
4419000	4422000	Because they weren't as good as they could have been.
4422000	4426000	But I still will play everything and support the franchise because I'm stupid.
4426000	4428000	Oh, one other game.
4428000	4429000	There is one other game in Japan this week.
4429000	4430000	Hooray, on the 15th.
4430000	4436000	On the 3DS this week, Kenka Banchao 6, Soul and Blood.
4436000	4442000	And this seems like one of those... I don't know what the hell kind of game this is.
4442000	4445000	It's like a fighting, manga, sim...
4445000	4447000	I like how that guy had laser eyes.
4447000	4449000	I think it's based on a series over there though.
4449000	4451000	Because obviously it's the sixth game.
4451000	4454000	But there's a scene where they're playing volleyball.
4454000	4456000	And I'm like, is this Top Gun? What is this?
4456000	4459000	What is it? Tennis? And then they fight each other.
4459000	4461000	That's interesting.
4461000	4462000	Well, that's how...
4462000	4464000	War's gotten a whole lot more dramatic.
4464000	4467000	That's right. Dark Soccer, how about the UK?
4467000	4470000	Nothing this week. I'll go ahead and do next week.
4470000	4474000	On 19th of January we have Black Guards 2 for PC.
4474000	4476000	And on the 23rd, Saints Row, get out of hell.
4476000	4478000	On a bunch of shit.
4478000	4481000	Alright. First big, big release of the year.
4481000	4484000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys.
4484000	4488000	So Captain Toad Treasure Tracker is not a big release then, huh?
4488000	4491000	That was bumped up and actually came out a little sooner.
4491000	4493000	Yeah, it came out on the 8th.
4493000	4495000	But no, I think it was bumped up sooner.
4495000	4497000	I think they ended up getting it at the end of December.
4497000	4499000	I don't think it actually... I think it came out actually sooner than January.
4499000	4501000	I think. I could be wrong.
4501000	4502000	It could be.
4502000	4504000	But we had it in the States a long time ago.
4504000	4506000	So we always do. So whatever.
4508000	4511000	You know what? Everybody in the UK, I will trade places with you.
4511000	4513000	You can come over here and get your games early.
4513000	4515000	And I can live somewhere with free healthcare.
4516000	4518000	Why don't you just go to Canada?
4518000	4519000	It's a lot closer.
4519000	4521000	Poutine.
4521000	4523000	Alright, now you're weighing the options.
4523000	4526000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.
4526000	4527000	But first, Loki.
4527000	4534000	So apparently, originally it was thought that there was a leak to when Kingdom Hearts 3 would be coming out.
4534000	4539000	According to Bill Farmer, who does the voice acting for Goofy in the game.
4539000	4542000	He said that the game was due out in 2015.
4542000	4547000	However, Square Enix went to correct saying there was a goof.
4547000	4549000	The release date for Kingdom Hearts 3 remains unannounced.
4549000	4551000	It's coming out next year. Come on.
4551000	4554000	I mean, it's probably coming out next year.
4554000	4556000	But they just haven't announced it yet.
4556000	4559000	And see, they didn't say it wasn't coming out.
4559000	4561000	They just said it remains unannounced.
4561000	4562000	I don't think it is coming out next year.
4562000	4564000	I think Final Fantasy XV is their tentpole for next year.
4564000	4565000	That's cool. I'm down with that.
4565000	4567000	I'd rather play Final Fantasy XV.
4567000	4570000	I think XV is going to make it next year, finally.
4570000	4573000	And then I think Kingdom Hearts 3 is 2016.
4573000	4576000	Why would they dump both the same year?
4576000	4580000	That's a lot of Square power for a year.
4580000	4584000	I mean, hey, if they do it, I will be very happy.
4584000	4588000	But it just seems like XV, especially with XV having a demo coming out in April,
4588000	4592000	seems to be a lot more ready for prime time than Kingdom Hearts 3,
4592000	4594000	which we've seen very little out of.
4594000	4597000	I mean, yes, I understand there's voice acting and all this other stuff.
4597000	4599000	But this guy, who knew?
4599000	4603000	It might have been like a side story thing that's going to end up coming out.
4603000	4607000	Like a prequel movie to the game or something that might come out.
4607000	4609000	And just because he thinks it's due out in 2015,
4609000	4612000	just because he doesn't know too much about the development
4612000	4616000	aside from that he's done his voice acting and that's it.
4616000	4621000	I mean, there's a lot of stuff that could be delayed for various reasons.
4621000	4624000	So I would say that it's definitive.
4624000	4629000	And blanketing 2015, that's still very plausible
4629000	4631000	because it could come out at the end of the year.
4631000	4634000	You could have Final Fantasy come out in the summer
4634000	4638000	and then have Kingdom Hearts for fourth quarter or something.
4638000	4640000	We'll see, we'll see.
4640000	4644000	All right, well, one more story for you guys here for this first half of the show.
4644000	4647000	And this is about Loki's favorite character, Tingle.
4647000	4650000	And we almost had a Tingle resurgence this past year, apparently,
4650000	4654000	because Hyrule Warriors, the team that made that game,
4654000	4656000	they wanted to put Tingle in the game.
4656000	4659000	Tecmo Koei actually wanted to put Tingle in the game.
4659000	4663000	But Eiji Aonuma said no.
4663000	4666000	Include a different character besides Tingle.
4666000	4667000	And the quote,
4667000	4671000	Actually, Tingle was a character we kind of considered and sort of went back and forth on.
4671000	4678000	We really wanted to include him, but Mr. Aonuma suggested that it might be good to include some other character.
4678000	4679000	Well, that's sad.
4679000	4681000	Why not both?
4681000	4684000	Porque no los dos? Why not both?
4684000	4686000	I just don't understand why they...
4687000	4689000	...resources, blah, blah, blah.
4689000	4692000	It would have been funny to do him, like, all realistic.
4692000	4696000	Just have, like, some guy in, like, you know, tights or whatever, just fighting.
4696000	4698000	But he kind of has, like, the Tingle...
4698000	4700000	And Loki volunteers to do the mocap.
4700000	4703000	Yeah, that's not gonna happen.
4703000	4709000	I wonder if this means, uh, what this could mean for Tingle's presence or lack thereof in the Wii U version of the game.
4709000	4712000	Oh, you'll get a new Tingle game before you'll get a new F-Zero game.
4712000	4715000	Oh, fuck you. All right.
4715000	4717000	That was cold.
4717000	4720000	Hey, I don't like it any more than you, okay?
4720000	4725000	All right. You know what? Let's travel back to a time when this was all a little bit simpler.
4726000	4730000	There was no arguing for characters to be in or not in certain games.
4730000	4734000	You just took what you got and that was it. There was no internet forum to complain about it on.
4734000	4736000	It's the classic game of the week.
4736000	4739000	Every week Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game where she thinks,
4739000	4744000	Hey, you should be playing this. And if you're not, well...
4744000	4746000	Then get a PC Engine.
4746000	4749000	That's right. Get a PC Engine so you can play it. There's a big hit. Dark Sakura.
4749000	4753000	What is this week's classic game of the week?
4753000	4758000	It is a semi-little known game called Psychic Storm.
4758000	4765000	It came out, um, in 1992. It was put out by Telnet Japan and Alpha System.
4765000	4771000	It was a super CD-ROM too, so you can play it on an American Turbo Duo.
4771000	4778000	First of all, Psychic Storm is really just a basic virtual, not virtual, vertical shooter.
4778000	4786000	It starts in a place called New Hong Kong City where there are these insect-like aliens trying to take over.
4786000	4792000	And so the people who they have to get to pilot these...
4792000	4796000	They're kind of like ships, but they're kind of buggy too.
4796000	4799000	This would have been perfect for the bug theme, I guess.
4799000	4803000	But they're psychically bonded to their ships.
4803000	4808000	They have Alex who has the Vulcan Gun Laser, Char with the Psycho Shell,
4808000	4816000	Joe has a short-ranged Hell Flame, and Natasha has the Ion Laser, which she was always my favorite to play.
4816000	4823000	They also can transform. So Alex can turn into a huge butterfly or something.
4823000	4828000	They get a bunch of, you know, enemies will drop power-ups. It's the usual type of thing.
4828000	4834000	Some orbs can actually bring back your... fill up your life bar, that type of thing.
4834000	4839000	You also have, of course, bombs that you have to use very, very sparingly.
4839000	4845000	And of course it has two-player simultaneous mode where you can actually combine your transformations.
4845000	4848000	And transformations are what I'm getting into now.
4848000	4855000	With your transformations, they actually can take up to 15 seconds to do your transform.
4855000	4862000	And the game actually gives you time to do them, but in some cases, as I found out the first time I played the game,
4862000	4870000	if you pull off a transformation on a boss battle at just the right time, you can actually completely avoid the boss battle and just kill it by transforming.
4870000	4875000	So basically, you do a Sailor Moon dance and the boss is impressed to death.
4875000	4879000	Sorry, I popped my neck.
4879000	4890000	It also, you know, they've got the different weapons and then they have their different psychic attacks that, you know, take over the whole screen.
4890000	4897000	Although one of them... back when we first played this game, my husband thought they said, I get pissed off.
4897000	4901000	It actually said Psychic Storm, but my husband thought they said, I get pissed off.
4901000	4903000	So from then forward, this game be called...
4903000	4905000	Because they sound so similar.
4905000	4907000	Well, it was the accent.
4907000	4908000	I know.
4908000	4915000	But since then, my husband has referred to this game as, I get pissed off.
4915000	4925000	It really is, I mean, as far as shooters go, I'd have to say it's pretty generic except that the level and character designs are actually really neat.
4925000	4927000	And it has a pretty decent soundtrack.
4927000	4930000	I mean, it actually follows along some different genre.
4930000	4939000	And I sadly do not have too much more actual information about this game or its release because I couldn't find anything.
4939000	4941000	I found very little.
4942000	4947000	But... so a lot of actually what I am giving you is just from having played the game.
4949000	4958000	It does have some little elements of very bad voice acting in it, as in badly recorded voice acting.
4960000	4967000	But I'd have to say that it's probably a solid... I'd give it a solid 8 out of 10 if I were going to rate it.
4967000	4972000	It's a fun game. It's good to sit down and put an hour into it and beat the game.
4972000	4974000	It's not super, super difficult.
4974000	4977000	But it's got enough challenge in it to keep it interesting.
4977000	4982000	So, I mean, it's no spriggin' but, I mean, if you're looking at PC Engine games.
4982000	4985000	But Psychic Storm is a really good solid game.
4985000	4987000	And they get pissed off.
4987000	4989000	Alright.
4989000	4991000	There it is. Your classic game of the week.
4991000	4995000	Psychic Storm, or I get pissed off on the PC Engine.
4996000	4998000	PC Engine Duo.
4998000	5002000	Considering there was a lot of people last week who absolutely recognized the classic game of the week.
5002000	5005000	In fact, I think you saw a few tweets on it, like, I love that game and so forth.
5005000	5010000	You kind of went from something very well known to something probably very few people have even played.
5010000	5014000	You know, if I don't do something obscure every so often, I cease to be a mess of myself.
5014000	5017000	That is part of the charm of the classic game of the week segment.
5017000	5022000	Well, I've done games that, like, you only know them if you're a collector.
5022000	5023000	Sure.
5023000	5027000	And some games I've done, I think, are games that are on my wish list.
5027000	5030000	I do have this game, though. I do legit have this game.
5030000	5036000	Alright. Well, maybe for a future game stream at some point we'll check this out, like this guy's doing.
5036000	5040000	I have to hook up the streaming stuff and then get the PC Engine out of storage.
5040000	5042000	And then find the game again.
5042000	5044000	Dig it all up.
5044000	5046000	Alright, there it is. Your classic game of the week.
5046000	5049000	Psychic Storm on the PC Engine.
5049000	5051000	Very good pick from Dark Soccer.
5051000	5057000	I could actually re-crap now. I forgot the name of that emulator that I used to play.
5057000	5059000	That I could play my turbo games on.
5059000	5061000	Alright, don't go crazy now.
5061000	5064000	Alright, we're going to take a break, guys, though.
5064000	5068000	When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, we've got more news for you guys.
5068000	5073000	The Fugu Question of the Week. Some news about Nintendo quitting the market.
5073000	5077000	Alright, at least in one part of the world we'll talk about what that's all about.
5077000	5080000	When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.
5087000	5090000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
5090000	5093000	Live on this Sunday night, January the 11th of 2015.
5093000	5097000	Episode number 583 of our show in progress.
5097000	5100000	A reminder, no show next week.
5100000	5103000	584 will be here in two weeks.
5103000	5107000	During the break, Loki's showing me what he had put together so far for his Game Jam project.
5107000	5110000	Kind of his concept for the start of the game.
5110000	5113000	It looks fine. I see where some of that stuff is bugging you.
5113000	5117000	Like when you... I don't want to spoil things.
5117000	5121000	But you can definitely see that stitching in the world map that was bugging you crazy.
5121000	5123000	I don't care about it anymore yet. It's not so bad.
5123000	5128000	It's buggy. It's part of the atmosphere.
5129000	5131000	Now that maybe some of these other people have freed up,
5131000	5133000	not working on their games as much now because they're done,
5133000	5136000	you should see if you get any help.
5136000	5139000	I'm okay. I can do it. It's a sick start.
5139000	5142000	You're such a boy. You won't stop and ask for directions.
5142000	5145000	If I need help, I will. Otherwise, I'm just going to look up the answer.
5145000	5147000	That's the only way we'll learn how to do it.
5147000	5150000	If I look up the answer or figure it out myself.
5150000	5151000	Yeah, fair enough.
5151000	5154000	Alright, let's get into some rapid fire news.
5154000	5157000	Also in this segment, of course, the FUGO Question of the Week,
5157000	5159000	our mailbag coming up, the FUs of the Week,
5159000	5162000	and your phone calls at 1-877-GAMO-LR
5162000	5165000	or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
5165000	5168000	But not yet. We've got a few segments to get to before we get to calls.
5168000	5171000	Let's do some rapid fire news, starting off with Loki.
5171000	5178000	Alright, so there's a small rumor that the GTA 5 PC retail copies won't be Steam compatible,
5178000	5180000	although I think that's a bunch of bullshit.
5180000	5184000	Apparently, this is coming from a NeoGaf user.
5184000	5186000	Or they said that they...
5186000	5188000	Well, that's credible.
5188000	5190000	No, I'm sorry. I thought it was from the user.
5190000	5192000	It's actually they were talking about...
5192000	5197000	It's like, how many references deep is this?
5197000	5201000	Anyways, somebody says that a listing on Green Man Gaming
5201000	5205000	says that it has the other DRM logo on the GTA 5 page.
5206000	5210000	What the thought is, though, is that it's not actually other DRM.
5210000	5213000	It's just that it's tied in with Rockstar Social Club,
5213000	5216000	so you kind of need a Social Club account.
5216000	5221000	But they're saying that they have to log into their Rockstar Social Club account,
5221000	5224000	and it won't be able to integrate with Steam,
5224000	5227000	which doesn't make any sense to me,
5227000	5229000	because I know that, granted, out of four,
5229000	5231000	you have to log in with your Social Club account,
5231000	5233000	and that works just fine.
5234000	5237000	And also, Max Payne 3, hello,
5237000	5239000	that also had Rockstar Social Club,
5239000	5243000	so that whole argument gets thrown out the window.
5243000	5245000	I think, honestly, it's going to have Steam support,
5245000	5247000	and it'll be just fine.
5247000	5250000	It wouldn't make any sense that they'd be selling versions of it on Steam
5250000	5252000	and not sell it at retail,
5252000	5254000	which is basically going to be a Steam key anyway,
5254000	5256000	so it doesn't make any sense.
5256000	5259000	But whatever, that's what they're reporting,
5259000	5262000	so we'll see in a couple weeks here when it comes out on the 27th.
5263000	5267000	Now, of course, with any release of Saints Row,
5267000	5273000	they always do some lavish pre-order incentive or special editions,
5273000	5281000	so they have a version of the game that's going to be coming with a Ouija board.
5281000	5286000	They're calling it Ouija, but it's a Ouija board.
5286000	5291000	I think the actual name Ouija, like O-U-I, is trademark.
5291000	5293000	Yeah, it's Hasbro.
5293000	5298000	But, yeah, so you can get that with a special edition that's available at Game, I guess.
5298000	5301000	So you can talk to your friends in hell, or make some new ones.
5301000	5302000	Exactly.
5302000	5304000	Through the power of...
5304000	5308000	How is a Ouija board powered by the spirits, I guess,
5308000	5312000	through the spirits that live in your bedroom and watch you touch yourself at night?
5314000	5317000	They want to make contact with you.
5317000	5320000	Please stop touching yourself at night.
5320000	5323000	I don't want to see that anymore.
5323000	5326000	But, yeah, you can get that.
5326000	5328000	There's basically...
5328000	5333000	It doesn't say what the price is of it, but it looks cool.
5333000	5336000	I guess, apparently, if you...
5336000	5338000	There's a contest that goes along with it.
5338000	5341000	If you take a picture of yourself using the Ouija board,
5341000	5345000	then you would be able to win a night on a haunted...
5345000	5348000	Or was it a tour on a haunted town or something like that
5348000	5350000	with some UK spirit medium guy?
5350000	5353000	Maybe they'll make one out of rubber called the squeegee board.
5353000	5355000	The squeegee board? Yeah.
5357000	5361000	Great for washing windows and contacting the dead.
5361000	5364000	And that should be coming out next week on the 20th in North America
5364000	5367000	and the 23rd internationally.
5369000	5372000	I, on the other hand, am not playing on buying a special edition.
5372000	5374000	I will pick up the version that's on PlayStation 4
5374000	5378000	because I've only beaten the game three or four times already.
5378000	5382000	And, and, seriously, what the fuck?
5382000	5385000	I've played the game over 40 hours
5385000	5388000	and yet I don't have the achievement for playing it over 40 hours.
5388000	5389000	That's a long time.
5389000	5391000	That's not a long time.
5391000	5395000	And it's just not giving it to me, whatever.
5395000	5399000	And anyways, there's another big game right around the corner
5399000	5401000	and that's Witcher 3 Wild Hunt.
5401000	5405000	And they've released the PC specs for the game.
5405000	5408000	So if you're looking to see what, you know,
5408000	5411000	if your computer can run it, and I was trying to figure out if mine can,
5411000	5415000	I don't, eh, might be able to, I don't know.
5415000	5420000	Then you can check it out and see if it'll run on your system.
5420000	5425000	But looks like rather modest specs.
5425000	5427000	So, cool.
5427000	5429000	That's it.
5429000	5431000	Alright.
5431000	5435000	I guess, I upgraded my computer just last year,
5435000	5437000	so I'm thinking Witcher 3 won't be a problem for me.
5437000	5438000	No, no, they're basically...
5438000	5439000	Other people may have some issues.
5439000	5444000	The minimum they're saying that you need a Core i5 2500K
5444000	5446000	and then, what is it?
5446000	5450000	They're saying AMDY is a Phenom 2 X4940,
5450000	5452000	which I have no fucking clue how long I sold.
5452000	5454000	Some people are going to be left out in the cold with those specs.
5454000	5457000	I know my graphics card can run that
5457000	5461000	because it's higher spec than what the minimum is.
5461000	5464000	As far as the high end, though, not so much.
5464000	5468000	Well, let's talk about the awesome games done quick marathon.
5468000	5470000	I don't know how many of you guys watched any part of that.
5470000	5472000	I unfortunately didn't watch any of it.
5472000	5473000	Oh my gosh.
5473000	5474000	I know, I wanted to.
5474000	5475000	A lot of it's on YouTube.
5475000	5476000	I just haven't got a chance to yet.
5476000	5477000	I will watch it.
5477000	5481000	The Ocarina bit last night was a great finale.
5481000	5484000	They were still streaming some this morning too, but just like random stuff.
5484000	5486000	Yeah, they do like a little extended finale, I think.
5486000	5489000	Yeah, some of the Hoard House guys like Extrofer gets really into that.
5489000	5490000	Shane was getting into it this year.
5490000	5492000	A lot of my friends on Twitter get into that.
5492000	5493000	Flaco.
5493000	5494000	Yeah, definitely Flaco.
5494000	5496000	It's all for a good cause.
5496000	5499000	It was all for the Prevent Cancer Foundation.
5499000	5503000	They ended up raising, just to conclude this year,
5503000	5509000	since it is over now, they have actually raised over $1.1 million.
5509000	5514000	My understanding is last check, it was actually up to $1.3 million.
5514000	5517000	I wonder if it even got higher because, you know, there's still,
5517000	5520000	thanks to the YouTube and the Humble Bundle, there's still some figures,
5520000	5522000	I think, coming in.
5522000	5523000	So I'm not sure what they're at now.
5523000	5524000	Did I buy the Humble Bundle?
5524000	5526000	I don't even remember now, but I probably should buy it.
5526000	5528000	Oh my gosh, I just looked just now.
5528000	5531000	They're up to $1.5 million as of right this moment.
5531000	5533000	No, it's over.
5533000	5535000	I've missed out on a bunch of games I already have.
5535000	5536000	Whoops.
5536000	5537000	Whoops at you.
5537000	5538000	That's all right.
5538000	5539000	I had pretty much everything in the bundle.
5539000	5541000	That's why I didn't buy it right away.
5541000	5542000	But it was for charity.
5542000	5545000	Yeah, but I don't, how many copies of games do I need, really?
5545000	5546000	All right.
5546000	5550000	Well, congrats to the great, what a great way to kick off the year.
5550000	5552000	A bunch of people that really, really love those games.
5552000	5554000	Doing a good thing for charity.
5554000	5557000	Let's carry that tone throughout 2015, please,
5557000	5560000	and none of the fuckery that brought down last year, please.
5560000	5563000	So congrats to the awesome games done quick, guys.
5563000	5568000	Let's talk about Far Cry 4, which is not being handled as quick.
5569000	5572000	There's some issues, apparently, with Far Cry 4 and the Xbox One.
5572000	5576000	Apparently, there was some rumors out there that DRM issues
5576000	5580000	were causing legitimate digital copies of Far Cry 4 to stop functioning.
5580000	5584000	Apparently, the game at one point was delisted,
5584000	5587000	although Microsoft says the delisting was an accident.
5587000	5589000	Microsoft quickly fixed it.
5589000	5591000	But some players were complaining of issues,
5591000	5594000	even after they had deleted and redownloaded the game,
5594000	5597000	that the game basically wasn't working.
5597000	5599000	So some folks were thinking,
5599000	5602000	oh, the delisting was to fix whatever the issue was,
5602000	5606000	although Microsoft, in a statement, says that the problems
5606000	5609000	had nothing to do with any sort of hidden DRM,
5609000	5612000	but there is no explanation as to what really happened.
5612000	5615000	They say, as far as the DRM goes,
5615000	5618000	quote, if customers own the rights to a game,
5618000	5621000	they can visit their download history and initiate a redownload
5621000	5624000	whenever they please, even if the game has been delisted from the Xbox Store
5624000	5626000	and is no longer available for purchase,
5626000	5630000	which is pretty much a canned answer that has nothing to do with a specific scenario.
5630000	5636000	Lastly, since we've been talking about game jams and dev stuff,
5636000	5641000	Steam Dev Days was happening about a year ago at this time,
5641000	5643000	but there was no second year.
5643000	5646000	It did not happen this year. It's not happening.
5646000	5649000	Basically, a representative from Steam saying,
5649000	5655000	quote, Steam Dev Days was a great way to brief a large number of Steam developers.
5655000	5657000	This year, our focus will be a bit different,
5657000	5661000	so we're planning a larger than usual presence at GDC.
5661000	5663000	So there will not be a Steam Dev Days this year,
5663000	5666000	but we will certainly consider doing it again in the future.
5666000	5670000	So, you know, last year, Steam also had the Steam Box thing,
5670000	5673000	which never did end up coming out. I guess they'll be coming out this year.
5673000	5675000	But they had the whole Steam Dev Days to go with that.
5675000	5681000	This year, it sounds like they're going to be kind of rolling that over into GDC this year,
5681000	5687000	which, by the way, there is rumor that Steam will unveil the finalized Steam controller design.
5687000	5688000	It's been early stuff.
5688000	5692000	But the finalized design will show up in March at the Game Developers Conference.
5692000	5694000	March is going to be a very interesting month,
5694000	5698000	because you have literally GDC and PAX East at the same time.
5698000	5701000	They do overlap a little bit this year,
5701000	5704000	as opposed to being really close to each other as they were in years past.
5705000	5708000	So, there you go.
5708000	5712000	We'll see what comes out of GDC in just a couple months.
5712000	5718000	Even though we don't usually get the big game announcements like you get at E3,
5718000	5721000	there's usually a little something here and there as far as,
5721000	5725000	here's a new something that developers will have to work with.
5725000	5726000	So we'll see.
5726000	5728000	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
5728000	5730000	A few things.
5730000	5734000	There is actually a notice for Steam.
5734000	5737000	Double Dragon Trilogy is going to be on Steam,
5737000	5739000	and good old games.
5739000	5745000	So those should be up on January 15th.
5745000	5748000	But ask yourself, do you really want to play Double Dragon 3?
5748000	5750000	Do you really?
5750000	5751000	Because I bet you don't.
5751000	5753000	I've already got it.
5753000	5756000	I don't know, ask Dan. He's the one who plays it.
5756000	5762000	Also now, Thetrthym Final Fantasy Curtain Call is getting Xenogears DLC.
5762000	5767000	So you can get all of your Xenogears music stuff on that you would ever, ever want to.
5767000	5778000	And then, last but not least, Elder Scrolls Arena is going to be free on PC.
5778000	5781000	You just go to elderscrolls.com slash arena,
5781000	5783000	and you can download it for free.
5783000	5785000	For free.
5785000	5791000	You can check out where all the lore upon lore upon lore in Skyrim and Oblivion and all that came from.
5791000	5792000	Yup.
5792000	5794000	Know your roots.
5794000	5795000	There it is.
5795000	5798000	Hitstun, what do you know about the Double Dragon Trilogy, arcade or NES versions?
5798000	5801000	My thought is it's arcade.
5801000	5802000	I think so.
5802000	5804000	Because a different company developed the NES versions.
5804000	5806000	So it's the arcade versions.
5806000	5811000	And the iOS versions, and I think it's on Android too, are based on arcade.
5811000	5815000	It's just a port of the mobile phone stuff for PC.
5815000	5816000	I think.
5816000	5819000	That's what I was getting from what I was reading anyway.
5819000	5824000	Alright, well let's see what I get in reading your responses to the FUGL Question of the Week.
5832000	5835000	Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and Google communities.
5835000	5838000	You put those words together, you get FUGL.
5838000	5843000	And we ask our communities a question each week and read some of our favorite answers here on the air.
5843000	5848000	Although this week's question being pretty short, I think we'll get a lot of answers in tonight.
5848000	5853000	And since the news is a little bit light this week, I thought we'd do some more talk about the year,
5853000	5855000	kind of looking forward to what's going on.
5855000	5857000	So we asked the listeners this week,
5857000	5862000	although some of the biggest releases of 2015 will surely be revealed at upcoming expos and conferences,
5862000	5865000	like the E3, the GDC, the PAXes and so forth,
5865000	5870000	we want to know what game at the moment are you most looking forward to in 2015?
5870000	5873000	Starting on Google Plus tonight, Rettertainment says,
5873000	5877000	I'm most looking forward to hearing anything about The Last Guardian.
5877000	5879000	Failing that mirrors edge.
5879000	5883000	Act Deft responded, Kirby and the Rainbow Curse.
5883000	5887000	But if I have to pick something not Kirby, Splatoon.
5887000	5891000	This game looks really interesting and I really want to see how Nintendo makes this work.
5891000	5894000	Also, Overwatch is another game I really want to try out.
5895000	5902000	Prince Peach Fuzz over on Google Plus says,
5902000	5906000	Metal Gear Solid 5, with a little exclamation point,
5906000	5909000	meaning we caught his attention apparently with that question.
5909000	5912000	Let's see, looking at some of the answers over on Facebook.
5912000	5914000	There's a lot of answers on Facebook.
5914000	5915000	Monty Boggs says,
5915000	5919000	After playing the Halo 5 beta, it's become my most anticipated game at the moment.
5919000	5921000	Let's see, Andy R. said,
5921000	5925000	IAVT Colorful, it's a rhythm game coming to the Vita,
5925000	5928000	featuring one of the newer Vocaloids, IA,
5928000	5931000	which is like Hatsune Miku is a Vocaloid.
5931000	5933000	Ursa Being Slurpy said,
5933000	5936000	It's a tie between Witcher 3 and The Division.
5936000	5937000	AZHP says,
5937000	5942000	Metal Gear Solid 5, I replayed Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3 on the HD collection.
5942000	5945000	I was reminded how crazy and dumb that game series is,
5945000	5947000	with regards to story and weird easter eggs.
5947000	5949000	I can't wait to see what Kojima has done this time.
5949000	5950000	Fifth Dream says,
5950000	5953000	Final Fantasy Type 0 HD is what I'm waiting for most.
5953000	5954000	Cial says,
5954000	5956000	Bravely Second.
5956000	5958000	Renji221 says,
5958000	5962000	Right now I'd have to say Batman Arkham Knight from the gameplay they've shown so far.
5962000	5964000	Guillermo R. says,
5964000	5968000	If the new Zelda decides to show up in 2015, then that's it for me.
5968000	5971000	Oh, and Final Fantasy XV, with the demo coming out March,
5971000	5973000	it should come out before the year is over, right?
5973000	5975000	Am I stupid to hope it'll actually get finished?
5975000	5978000	If you are, Guillermo, then call me stupid right there with you.
5978000	5979000	Tigerclaw says,
5979000	5981000	There are many games coming out this year,
5981000	5985000	but I think two of my most anticipated games have to be the new Star Fox on Wii U
5985000	5987000	and Batman Arkham Knight.
5987000	5988000	Last but not least,
5988000	5989000	Red the Haze says,
5989000	5990000	Yakuza 5.
5990000	5992000	I know it's an older PS3 game,
5992000	5994000	but I love how you have a gritty gangster crime drama,
5994000	5998000	with a teen girl idol who has random dance battles with people as combat.
5998000	6002000	Dance battles are made by the people who make the Hatsune Miku Project D.Va games.
6002000	6004000	That does sound awesome, actually.
6004000	6007000	I think Yakuza is a series I'd like to see.
6007000	6011000	Yakuza is a series I really need to get into that I haven't been playing enough of.
6011000	6013000	Clearly, if that's what the series is all about.
6013000	6016000	That's not what the series is all about.
6016000	6018000	They just do some silly things from time to time.
6018000	6020000	I'm okay with silly things from time to time.
6020000	6021000	How about you guys?
6021000	6024000	Most anticipated games of 2015?
6027000	6030000	I would like to see, basically, a Crackdown.
6030000	6032000	That looks awesome.
6032000	6035000	I would like to see No Man's Sky.
6036000	6041000	As far as beyond that, it's whatever else we haven't heard of yet.
6041000	6045000	I'd love to try out a virtual reality thing,
6045000	6047000	whether it be the Oculus Rift,
6047000	6049000	or if it's the Morpheus,
6049000	6051000	or something else.
6051000	6053000	That would be kind of fun.
6053000	6056000	That's what I'm more interested in is the VR stuff,
6056000	6058000	what they're going to do with that.
6058000	6060000	But yeah, Crackdown.
6060000	6062000	I've got to have some Crackdown.
6063000	6065000	That might be a thing, because that's something that
6065000	6067000	Microsoft really pimped out last year,
6067000	6070000	so I would assume this E3, they're going to show the gameplay.
6070000	6073000	Well, even Quantum Break looked pretty awesome.
6073000	6075000	That's true, that's still a thing.
6075000	6076000	Check that out.
6076000	6079000	I don't remember what Sony had, aside from Uncharted,
6079000	6081000	but I just don't care about that series.
6081000	6083000	So I don't remember what else they had.
6083000	6086000	Street Fighter V, which obviously is more Capcom,
6086000	6088000	but there was a bunch of stuff there.
6088000	6091000	I know they had tons of E3, I just don't remember.
6091000	6093000	The show was huge, too.
6093000	6095000	I still don't remember what...
6095000	6097000	Honestly, I'm more interested...
6097000	6099000	The order is right around the corner.
6099000	6101000	That doesn't look that great.
6101000	6103000	I'm more interested in the stuff that they haven't talked about yet.
6103000	6106000	Like, hey, Saints Row 5.
6106000	6109000	And let's have a good Saints Row 5,
6109000	6111000	because I don't know what the fuck they could possibly do now
6111000	6114000	with Saints Row, aside from time travel.
6114000	6117000	I think it's hit the peak of ridiculousness
6117000	6119000	that it could possibly hit.
6119000	6121000	DarkSakura, what about you?
6121000	6123000	What's your most anticipated game of 2015?
6123000	6125000	I honestly don't know.
6125000	6127000	Probably more Dragon Age DLC.
6127000	6129000	Well, I was gonna say...
6129000	6131000	Silent Hills.
6131000	6133000	Oh, Silent Hills. That's a good one.
6133000	6135000	Oh, I can't believe none of our listeners said that.
6135000	6138000	But then again, there's no guarantee it'll be this year, right?
6138000	6139000	I don't care.
6139000	6141000	PT Part 2.
6141000	6143000	I actually...
6143000	6145000	Well, I was gonna say, DarkSakura, I may be helping you with an answer.
6145000	6149000	I'm hopeful that Mass Effect Don't Call It 4 is this year.
6149000	6153000	Yeah, but I'm really trying not to get my hopes up, so...
6153000	6155000	I would think no later than Spring 2016.
6155000	6159000	I don't want my hopes to get up and then have my heart broken.
6159000	6161000	I understand, I understand.
6161000	6165000	Save that if we can't have more info on Mass Effect Don't Call It 4.
6165000	6168000	Final Fantasy XV for me, which some of the other listeners already said.
6168000	6170000	I definitely...
6170000	6172000	And I'm of the mindset that that'll be this year.
6172000	6174000	I don't wanna play Pretty Boy Road Trip the game.
6174000	6177000	Pretty Boy Road Trip is one very small part of a much larger game.
6177000	6179000	I know, I know.
6179000	6181000	I think we're focusing too much on that.
6181000	6183000	Huh. You alright?
6183000	6185000	Yeah, I just...
6185000	6191000	There was something I did have on a list, but for the life of me, I cannot remember what it is right now.
6191000	6195000	What about going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com
6195000	6198000	Tigerclaw says, what about Battlefront 3?
6198000	6200000	Do you think that'll come out this year?
6200000	6202000	You know when I first looked at that, I thought it said Battle Toads.
6202000	6204000	That's a huge rumor.
6204000	6206000	Battlefront 3 will come out when Star Wars comes out.
6206000	6208000	They're gonna time it with that release, I'm guessing.
6208000	6210000	Zelda also would be another one.
6210000	6212000	Or Zelda Wii U. Did anybody say Zelda Wii?
6212000	6214000	Oh no, I think we did have at least one or two listeners that said that.
6214000	6216000	That might be one.
6216000	6218000	Absolutely, Zelda Wii U. I can't wait to see more on that.
6218000	6220000	Especially if they're going the Skyrim route with it.
6220000	6222000	Isn't that the second thing, a DLC coming for Mario Kart 8 sometime soon?
6222000	6224000	Oh yeah, the Animal Crossing.
6224000	6226000	March, I think, is when that's due.
6226000	6228000	Why is it so long? I mean...
6228000	6230000	I think they just wanna stretch it out as long as they can.
6230000	6232000	That's ridiculous.
6232000	6234000	I know, a little silly.
6234000	6236000	Maybe that's around the time they're going to announce an Animal Crossing Wii U game.
6236000	6238000	Maybe.
6238000	6240000	Or...
6240000	6242000	That's the time that they're gonna release more Amiibos
6242000	6244000	that are gonna coincide with the DLC.
6244000	6246000	Ah, maybe.
6246000	6248000	So right around the time they'll have Animal Crossing Amiibos
6248000	6250000	they go along with, you know,
6250000	6252000	Animal Crossing and Mario Kart.
6252000	6254000	We'll see.
6254000	6256000	Alright.
6256000	6258000	Let's get back into some news.
6258000	6260000	And your calls in a little while here at 1877 Game OLR.
6260000	6262000	But first, we've got a little bit of news to get through.
6262000	6264000	Loki.
6264000	6266000	Yes, Nintendo has decided to end distribution of its hardware and software in Brazil.
6266000	6268000	They're saying due to the high import tariffs.
6268000	6270000	And starting January 2015,
6270000	6272000	Gaming do Brazil,
6272000	6274000	a wholly owned subsidiary of...
6274000	6276000	I'm not even gonna pronounce that.
6276000	6278000	It's not.
6278000	6280000	It's not.
6280000	6282000	It's not.
6282000	6284000	It's not.
6284000	6286000	It's not.
6286000	6288000	Yeah, and I'm just gonna save a video.
6288000	6290000	I'm not even gonna pronounce that, too hard for me.
6290000	6292000	stands at home
6292000	6294000	We'll no longer distribute products in Brazil.
6294000	6296000	And despite the changes in Brazil,
6296000	6298000	There'll be a distributor for
6298000	6300000	There'll be a distributor for Latin America
6300000	6303000	And will be remaining, committed to the brand
6303000	6305000	and the region.
6305000	6307000	So, kind of sucks.
6307000	6309000	But, I guess, you know,
6309000	6311000	They're saying it's just so ridiculous
6312000	6314000	you know, At the price of systems
6314000	6315000	it's like several thousand...
6315000	6317000	over a hundred dollars more than what it is in other places.
6317000	6319000	Yeah, apparently the fees are really high.
6319000	6321000	I'm hearing they have a lot of problems
6321000	6323000	with the digital distribution network there, too.
6323000	6325000	Like, it doesn't work with any of the banks
6325000	6327000	in Brazil.
6327000	6329000	So, I guess, like, there's no eShop content
6329000	6331000	like at all in Brazil.
6331000	6333000	Which, you know, is a huge source of money
6333000	6335000	for Nintendo, probably even more so
6335000	6337000	in other territories.
6337000	6339000	Where it might be harder to just walk into a GameStop
6339000	6341000	and get a game.
6341000	6343000	So, that's probably another strike
6343000	6345000	against why Nintendo is ceasing
6345000	6347000	operations in Brazil.
6347000	6349000	I would love to hear, you know, I know we have listeners throughout the world
6349000	6351000	so, you know, it's hard for us to sit here
6351000	6353000	and comment what's going on in another country
6353000	6355000	but if you happen to be in Brazil
6355000	6357000	and have any insight on this, let us know.
6357000	6359000	Because I know we used to have a guy in Argentina
6359000	6361000	and in Chile that listened.
6361000	6363000	I think he's kind of moved on
6363000	6365000	to other things now, but I'm hoping maybe
6365000	6367000	we've got some other people in South America
6367000	6369000	who might give some insight as to what's going on.
6369000	6371000	So...
6371000	6373000	Let's see, looking in our chatroom
6373000	6375000	over at live.vognetwork.com
6375000	6377000	Act F saying eShop isn't available in Brazil
6377000	6379000	as far as I know. Dungeon Buster says
6379000	6381000	Brazil's tariffs are nuts.
6381000	6383000	Apparently on launch, a Playstation 4 was
6383000	6385000	$1800 because of taxes.
6385000	6387000	Yeah, it's a little nuts.
6387000	6393000	It's not going to lead to good business in the country, that's for sure.
6393000	6395000	Alright, well let's move on to this.
6395000	6397000	You know, this is kind of big news
6397000	6399000	and I'm not seeing a lot of people talk about this
6399000	6401000	but I think this is kind of big because you know
6401000	6403000	last year we had a lot of
6403000	6405000	run-ins with Let's Plays
6405000	6407000	and the legality of that
6407000	6409000	and what is acceptable on
6409000	6411000	YouTube and so forth. You might remember
6411000	6413000	Nintendo got into a lot of these issues and so on.
6413000	6415000	Well Microsoft this week
6415000	6417000	coming out with kind of a clarification
6417000	6419000	on their policy on
6419000	6421000	how they view the Let's Plays
6421000	6423000	and the streams and all this other stuff.
6423000	6425000	So with Microsoft's new policy
6425000	6427000	you will now have, if you're
6427000	6429000	a content creator such as me
6429000	6431000	or what have you, any of you other folks
6431000	6433000	that do Twitches or YouTubes, you have a
6433000	6435000	quote, personal, non-exclusive, non-
6435000	6437000	sub-licensable, non-transferable,
6437000	6439000	revocable, limited license to use
6439000	6441000	things like gameplay footage, screenshots
6441000	6443000	and music. But as long
6443000	6445000	as you don't
6445000	6447000	do any, you know, you can't
6447000	6449000	promote bad things
6449000	6451000	in your stream like piracy and all that stuff
6451000	6453000	and do offensive content.
6453000	6455000	Also what else is interesting
6455000	6457000	is that you are not able to
6457000	6459000	profit off the content created
6459000	6461000	except for
6461000	6463000	YouTube and Twitch ads
6463000	6465000	which is the most common
6465000	6467000	way that folks are making money off of it.
6467000	6469000	So I'm assuming what they don't
6469000	6471000	want you to make money off of is more like the
6471000	6473000	you know, whatever the product placement or other
6473000	6475000	other things outside of the ads
6475000	6477000	that you may come across.
6477000	6479000	You can't sell or otherwise
6479000	6481000	earn any compensation from your item
6481000	6483000	including through advertisements in the item.
6483000	6485000	You can't charge money in exchange
6485000	6487000	for your item posted on a site that requires
6487000	6489000	a subscription or other fees to view
6489000	6491000	the item or posted on a page
6491000	6493000	you use to sell other items or services
6493000	6495000	even if they have nothing to do with the
6495000	6497000	game content or Microsoft. You also
6497000	6499000	can't use game content in an
6499000	6501000	app that you sell in an app store which
6501000	6503000	makes it so like if you're a let's play
6503000	6505000	you can't make an app that
6505000	6507000	is all your content on iOS and make
6507000	6509000	money off that if it's Microsoft stuff.
6509000	6511000	But you are able to do YouTube
6511000	6513000	and Twitch which is kind of the most common thing
6513000	6515000	that most people are into as well.
6515000	6517000	Now even though this is for
6517000	6519000	Microsoft Studios and the things that
6519000	6521000	are Microsoft, it does
6521000	6523000	exclude Minecraft because
6523000	6525000	Mojang does their own thing
6525000	6527000	even though there was the purchase
6527000	6529000	with Microsoft buying them
6529000	6531000	Minecraft has their own set of rules
6531000	6533000	from 2013 that are still in effect.
6533000	6535000	And if you are curious
6535000	6537000	Red vs. Blue which is created by
6537000	6539000	Rooster Teeth, they have a separate agreement
6539000	6541000	with Microsoft that is
6541000	6543000	between them.
6543000	6545000	There you go. If you're
6545000	6547000	curious for more information about how that
6547000	6549000	all works, xbox.com
6549000	6551000	slash en dash us
6551000	6553000	slash developers slash rules
6553000	6555000	or I'm sure if you Google
6555000	6557000	Xbox game content usage rules
6557000	6559000	I'm sure you can find much more
6559000	6561000	about this. So there you go.
6563000	6565000	What do you think about that? What do you think about Microsoft's
6565000	6567000	rules? It's
6567000	6569000	nice that they put it out there so that
6569000	6571000	at least there's something that
6571000	6573000	say there ever was a copyright
6573000	6575000	strike you'd be like
6575000	6577000	refer to this type of thing.
6577000	6579000	Kind of
6579000	6581000	like how they have with Minecraft.
6581000	6583000	But
6583000	6585000	I don't know. I think it's fair.
6585000	6587000	I don't see that. I don't think that's
6587000	6589000	a really bad thing and I think Nintendo
6589000	6591000	they had something where it was kind of
6591000	6593000	hey, do what you want now.
6593000	6595000	I mean, at least
6595000	6597000	it's tricky. Like where is
6597000	6599000	the balance? Where is the balance with this stuff?
6599000	6601000	And I think they're trying to find a decent balance
6601000	6603000	between like okay, you can make a little
6603000	6605000	bit of money off of it but you can't be like
6605000	6607000	keeping things behind locked doors and
6607000	6609000	selling subscriptions of stuff that's based off
6609000	6611000	things we made. But a little light
6611000	6613000	ad revenue like the YouTube and Twitch stuff
6613000	6615000	is okay and I think
6615000	6617000	I think that's as close of a
6617000	6619000	compromise that's fair as we're probably going to
6619000	6621000	see for a long time. And
6621000	6623000	as a content creator I'm kind of okay with
6623000	6625000	that because I've been having to do a lot of thinking about this.
6625000	6627000	You know, yeah, game makers
6627000	6629000	they make
6629000	6631000	these videos
6631000	6633000	without it you wouldn't have the videos
6633000	6635000	so they kind of, you know, they do deserve
6635000	6637000	a little bit of it.
6637000	6639000	And I have seen other
6639000	6641000	let's plays that are nothing
6641000	6643000	but captures from the game.
6643000	6645000	And I'm kind of always like
6645000	6647000	well, when you're making money off that
6647000	6649000	but the people
6649000	6651000	that do the commentary and the jokes
6651000	6653000	and have a little more, you know, with it
6653000	6655000	okay, then you're at least adding something
6655000	6657000	to it, you're making it a little more Mystery Science
6657000	6659000	Theater or whatever. There should
6659000	6661000	be, you know, a little room for you to
6661000	6663000	make some money off that.
6663000	6665000	Just to pay to keep it going
6665000	6667000	if nothing else. Pay for your time.
6667000	6669000	Which I can
6669000	6671000	assure you, creating content as I have on YouTube
6671000	6673000	I'm not even getting that much. I think I've made
6673000	6675000	be made in all, off all the
6675000	6677000	videos I've done in the past year, I think I've made
6677000	6679000	a dollar. I think I've made a dollar.
6680000	6682000	I've gotten one check from Google.
6682000	6684000	Have you really? How much?
6684000	6686000	Well, the minimum is a hundred bucks.
6686000	6688000	What? How'd you get a hundred bucks?
6688000	6690000	What are you doing that I'm not doing?
6690000	6692000	I'm not doing anything. Well, aside from
6692000	6694000	I just did a few
6694000	6696000	videos, mainly
6696000	6698000	the one that had the most revenue
6698000	6700000	was I did a thing on how to
6700000	6702000	side load stuff for the Ouya
6702000	6704000	and so that video keeps getting watched.
6704000	6706000	And then there was one that was like
6706000	6708000	I had one that got Disney Infinity
6708000	6710000	early and I kind of did like a
6710000	6712000	real quick unboxing
6712000	6714000	type thing. But that's it. I mean that's
6714000	6716000	really all I've done. But it's just that
6716000	6718000	those videos are out there. None of my stuff really has gone viral.
6718000	6720000	I think the video I have with the most views is like
6720000	6722000	I have a Diablo 3
6722000	6724000	barbarian video
6724000	6726000	that I just randomly did and for some
6726000	6728000	reason that has more views than anything else I've done.
6728000	6730000	Some wacky reason. I don't
6730000	6732000	like really keep track
6732000	6734000	of that very much but like
6734000	6736000	I'm gonna see
6736000	6738000	I'm trying to see what my AdSense is back
6738000	6740000	up to again cause
6740000	6742000	it takes a long time for it to get paid out
6742000	6744000	especially since I don't
6744000	6746000	put any of my videos.
6746000	6748000	Someday I will but it's just I don't have time.
6748000	6750000	What do we got here?
6750000	6752000	Oh, hey!
6752000	6754000	That's not bad.
6754000	6756000	Yeah, so the last time it was like
6756000	6758000	$111 and I got $61
6758000	6760000	sitting there.
6760000	6762000	They're not gonna send me a paycheck.
6762000	6764000	Woo!
6764000	6766000	Yeah, you know when they paid me out the $111?
6766000	6768000	That was back in 2013.
6768000	6770000	Okay, so I'm
6770000	6772000	it's not like I'm
6772000	6774000	making a ton of money off of this like
6774000	6776000	over the course of a few years.
6776000	6778000	Hey, extra money is money.
6778000	6780000	So, can not do it.
6780000	6782000	Even the official
6782000	6784000	Playstation account actually tweeted out
6784000	6786000	cause I got on that SharePlay thing
6786000	6788000	right when it first came out and I had a Final Fantasy 14
6788000	6790000	video and Playstation saw it and tweeted it
6790000	6792000	and even my Diablo 3 video
6792000	6794000	had more views than that.
6794000	6796000	Which kind of surprised me.
6796000	6798000	I thought the Final Fantasy one would be the most popular.
6798000	6800000	I'm not sure I have that one monetized.
6800000	6802000	I don't monetize all my stuff by default.
6802000	6804000	Just the stuff that I'm pretty sure
6804000	6806000	there's studio clearance on.
6806000	6808000	I usually use that Let's Play.
6808000	6810000	There's like a wiki out there that shows which creators
6810000	6812000	are okay with it and which aren't.
6812000	6814000	I haven't really put anything up that's worth
6814000	6816000	something like that would actually be good to
6816000	6818000	repost like in a comment section.
6818000	6820000	Yeah.
6820000	6822000	It's okay per here.
6822000	6824000	Not that that always
6824000	6826000	helps on YouTube cause they
6826000	6828000	pulled my
6828000	6830000	video on Super Hexagon
6830000	6832000	even though it's pretty clear
6832000	6834000	they're fine with the
6834000	6836000	Let's Play monetization.
6836000	6838000	Alright, let's move on.
6838000	6840000	DarkSakura, I think we're over to you.
6840000	6842000	Yes, I believe so.
6842000	6844000	Well, I have to
6844000	6846000	say that I was right.
6846000	6848000	The real Shepard was
6848000	6850000	always a lady.
6850000	6852000	Actually, as it was
6852000	6854000	stated from the developer
6854000	6856000	Jonathan Cooper who
6856000	6858000	was the
6858000	6860000	I believe the one that did the first
6860000	6862000	animation test for what would become
6862000	6864000	Commander Shepard used a female
6864000	6866000	model. Very clearly a female
6866000	6868000	model. Actually something
6868000	6870000	pulled from
6870000	6872000	a previous game but it
6872000	6874000	was what began and in fact
6874000	6876000	I watched the little running animation very
6876000	6878000	clearly female. But it
6878000	6880000	was a motion capture
6880000	6882000	taken from the game Jade Empire
6882000	6884000	of a female character and that's what became
6884000	6886000	Commander Shepard.
6886000	6888000	I mean, they always had
6888000	6890000	the intention of letting you choose
6890000	6892000	but she started
6892000	6894000	life that way.
6894000	6896000	I realized
6896000	6898000	that for some people FemShep
6898000	6900000	is the only Shep in Headcanon
6900000	6902000	although I certainly appreciate
6902000	6904000	the fact that I can have man on man
6904000	6906000	Shep. That's my
6906000	6908000	personal thing. But it's
6908000	6910000	interesting though that sometimes characters may
6910000	6912000	start one way and they completely change
6912000	6914000	when they're in development which I don't think it's
6914000	6916000	fair to say in this scenario anything necessarily
6916000	6918000	changed. But I do know
6918000	6920000	one that I had come across not that long ago
6920000	6922000	since I was getting really back into Final Fantasy 13
6922000	6924000	because of the PC release
6924000	6926000	Fang, who's my favorite character in the game
6926000	6928000	started as a male
6928000	6930000	and was
6930000	6932000	originally a male character
6932000	6934000	that was going to be
6934000	6936000	the character of Fang.
6936000	6938000	And somewhere along the line
6938000	6940000	Fang changed to a female
6940000	6942000	and I really can't picture it any other way.
6942000	6944000	Fang is just a badass chick
6944000	6946000	my favorite character by far
6946000	6948000	in that game. I don't know
6948000	6950000	I have a hard time picturing it as male although I go
6950000	6952000	that would make an awesome gender swap
6952000	6954000	cosplay.
6954000	6956000	Why can't we have German Shepherd Shepard?
6956000	6958000	I want German Shepherd Shepard
6958000	6960000	because I think that would be awesome.
6960000	6962000	Only out of Silent Hill, the dog ending
6962000	6964000	except it's not the dog ending
6964000	6966000	it's the whole game.
6966000	6968000	Well my femshep was Sherry Shepherd
6968000	6970000	so
6970000	6972000	as seen on the view
6972000	6974000	maybe Sybil Shepherd
6974000	6976000	Shepard's pie
6976000	6978000	Dark Soccer isn't speaking
6978000	6980000	but she has a look on her face that basically says
6980000	6982000	please stop
6982000	6984000	which means we have to keep going
6984000	6986000	I will stuff you in an anatomic body.
6986000	6988000	Yeah by the way what she's not
6988000	6990000	saying but I'm not gonna promise that
6990000	6992000	I won't murder everybody after that.
6992000	6994000	She's been spending the last hour of the
6994000	6996000	show on the Five Nights at Freddy's
6996000	6998000	Wiki ever since I brought it up in part A
6998000	7000000	she's been reading. I didn't make it that
7000000	7002000	far into just because I got
7002000	7004000	motion sick every time Foxy would
7004000	7006000	run because
7006000	7008000	I didn't pay enough attention to the diva.
7008000	7010000	If you don't pay enough attention
7010000	7012000	to Foxy, Foxy
7012000	7014000	will run at you and if you don't slam the door like
7014000	7016000	immediately you will die.
7016000	7018000	With that
7018000	7020000	mouth.
7020000	7022000	The little noise they make.
7022000	7024000	Foxy got me with one
7024000	7026000	percent of my battery left by the way.
7026000	7028000	Well because he also drains your battery if he
7028000	7030000	touches your door. He goes to your door
7030000	7032000	he'll drain one percent then six percent then
7032000	7034000	eleven. Oh geez. Yeah if
7034000	7036000	you let it happen so he'll actually drain your battery.
7036000	7038000	But what was I gonna
7038000	7040000	say? Did you ever get the
7040000	7042000	Golden Freddy? No I didn't survive
7042000	7044000	that far. I did get the Golden Freddy on my second
7044000	7046000	playthrough. Oh wow. And
7046000	7048000	you hear this giggling if you look at the
7048000	7050000	poster. And that's actually
7050000	7052000	slowed down for their regular laugh.
7052000	7054000	So ugh creepy. Anyway sorry.
7054000	7056000	Mass Effect.
7056000	7058000	Unless we get a Five Nights at Shepherds
7058000	7060000	crossover maybe. Who knows.
7060000	7062000	I can't
7062000	7064000	just imagine that. But it's
7064000	7066000	the Volus that slowly
7066000	7068000	runs. Waddling
7068000	7070000	toward you.
7070000	7072000	Going.
7072000	7074000	That breathing noise.
7074000	7076000	This one needs to die.
7076000	7078000	That's a Hanar. Oh my god
7078000	7080000	the Hanar would be Chica.
7080000	7082000	Alright anyway.
7082000	7084000	Let's see we got some
7084000	7086000	more stories here Loki.
7086000	7088000	Alright. Sorry I was being distracted
7088000	7090000	by German Shepherd again.
7090000	7092000	So Nintendo
7092000	7094000	talk about
7094000	7096000	the change of heart. You remember
7096000	7098000	Nintendo at one time was kind of
7098000	7100000	barring the use of Smash
7100000	7102000	Brothers in fighting game tournaments and stuff.
7102000	7104000	And now they're supporting
7104000	7106000	and sponsoring Apex 2015.
7106000	7108000	That's going to include
7108000	7110000	different games including
7110000	7112000	Ultra Street Fighter 4
7112000	7114000	Smash Brothers
7114000	7116000	Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and
7116000	7118000	Pokemon. And
7118000	7120000	it's pretty awesome. The tournament is going to run from
7120000	7122000	January 30th through February
7122000	7124000	1st 2015.
7124000	7126000	In New Jersey.
7126000	7128000	And they're also going to stream it on Twitch.
7128000	7130000	So.
7130000	7132000	Cool.
7132000	7134000	That's probably a pretty awesome sponsor.
7134000	7136000	That's quite the turn around for Nintendo.
7136000	7138000	I guess they listen to feedback.
7138000	7140000	A lot of feedback.
7140000	7142000	Yeah these type of things help
7142000	7144000	promote your game.
7144000	7146000	You should let people do that.
7146000	7148000	Alright.
7148000	7150000	Let's see moving on.
7150000	7152000	Speaking of Nintendo. Those GameCube
7152000	7154000	adapters highly sought after
7154000	7156000	devices and I'm surprised it took this
7156000	7158000	long for us to be talking about a
7158000	7160000	third party GameCube adapter.
7160000	7162000	And now even though
7162000	7164000	the official GameCube adapter
7164000	7166000	has not been discontinued
7166000	7168000	good luck freaking finding it anywhere.
7168000	7170000	It's not really showing up anywhere.
7170000	7172000	So third parties have
7172000	7174000	come in to fill in the gap
7174000	7176000	about the
7176000	7178000	GameCube adapters and
7178000	7180000	Mayflash is the company that's putting one of these together.
7180000	7182000	A GameCube controller adapter.
7182000	7184000	You can get it for $20.
7184000	7186000	It's available on PlayAsia but
7186000	7188000	I'm sure there's some other websites as well.
7188000	7190000	What happens, this is
7190000	7192000	very similar to the Nintendo GameCube
7192000	7194000	adapter but shaped a
7194000	7196000	little differently and there's a switch on the side
7196000	7198000	to let you swap between Wii U
7198000	7200000	and PC. That's kind of
7200000	7202000	cool. So you can actually use
7202000	7204000	your GameCube controller on the PC
7204000	7206000	with that which
7206000	7208000	could be pretty cool for playing some of your Steam Library
7208000	7210000	games. So.
7210000	7212000	Now granted nobody's gotten their hands on this
7212000	7214000	yet so we don't know if it's
7214000	7216000	as responsive and so forth but
7216000	7218000	I mean this is a pretty hard thing to
7218000	7220000	screw up, right?
7220000	7222000	You would say that. It shouldn't be that
7222000	7224000	hard to just turn wires
7224000	7226000	into other wires.
7226000	7228000	Right? Well it's not as simple
7228000	7230000	as that but yeah.
7230000	7232000	Let's see, Rama says at least
7232000	7234000	these third party ones are PC compatible.
7234000	7236000	Hitstun says that Mayflash
7236000	7238000	adapter is not bad. But
7238000	7240000	Kaijuto says, I don't do third party
7240000	7242000	electronics. Fuck that. And I can
7242000	7244000	understand where some people want to keep it
7244000	7246000	you know, with the official stuff
7246000	7248000	because Nintendo ain't going to support one of these
7248000	7250000	if your system gets all screwed up because
7250000	7252000	of it. As
7252000	7254000	little complicated as I believe these
7254000	7256000	devices to be but it makes sense.
7256000	7258000	So. Well hopefully
7258000	7260000	Nintendo will, I mean, I
7260000	7262000	I don't understand the way they work sometimes
7262000	7264000	is that they really thrive on this hard to
7264000	7266000	get shit and it's getting old.
7266000	7268000	It's getting old, it's getting frustrating.
7268000	7270000	Sometimes it's hard to love you Nintendo. Sometimes
7270000	7272000	it's really hard. Really hard.
7272000	7274000	I already told you I'm over this amiibo
7274000	7276000	shit. I was at this point
7276000	7278000	where I was like, oh I gotta get Mega Man. I really
7278000	7280000	want to get Pit. No, I'm done.
7280000	7282000	I'm over the amiibo shit. I'm over it.
7282000	7284000	It's too much of a game.
7284000	7286000	It's like if I give my
7286000	7288000	money I should be able to get, it's just
7288000	7290000	what a mess.
7290000	7292000	Anyway, let's get into
7292000	7294000	the mailbag and the game of
7294000	7296000	reading your emails because you send them to us
7296000	7298000	every week.
7298000	7300000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to
7300000	7302000	participate by sending us an email.
7302000	7304000	Dark Soccer is going to dive into the mailbag
7304000	7306000	over at ParticipateAtOrangeLoungeRadio.com
7306000	7308000	and read whatever
7308000	7310000	emails may be awaiting us tonight.
7310000	7312000	All one of them. All one of them.
7312000	7314000	Save
7314000	7316000	this for a show with a light
7316000	7318000	mailbag as the scenario
7318000	7320000	is a little lengthy and particularly
7320000	7322000	weird while you have good timing.
7322000	7324000	Yes you do. Maybe I'm obsessed with survival
7324000	7326000	type games but here's an obviously
7326000	7328000	hypothetical situation for you.
7328000	7330000	None of you know each other yet and do not have
7330000	7332000	the families you currently have
7332000	7334000	and you happen to be
7334000	7336000	most comfortable sleeping unclothed.
7336000	7338000	What?
7338000	7340000	You just get home at night, play some games
7340000	7342000	watch some TV, have dinner, then throw
7342000	7344000	all your clothes in the hamper or washing machine
7344000	7346000	take off any watches and jewelry and drift off
7346000	7348000	to sleep only in your bedsheets.
7348000	7350000	What?
7350000	7352000	One comfortably warm spring night you
7352000	7354000	turn in and in the morning
7354000	7356000	or what you judge to be morning
7356000	7358000	you wake up in an unfamiliar place still naked
7358000	7360000	apparently nowhere near any known civilization.
7360000	7362000	Neither alcohol nor medication
7362000	7364000	are involved. Nonetheless you have no idea
7364000	7366000	where you are or how you got there.
7366000	7368000	You wake up to one of three
7368000	7370000	scenarios. One you are in the middle
7370000	7372000	of the massive grassy field. There's nothing
7372000	7374000	as far as you can see except for gently rolling
7374000	7376000	hills of dirt and grass
7376000	7378000	spotted by dandelions and maybe some loose
7378000	7380000	stones. There don't seem to be any type of
7380000	7382000	wildlife around but there might be burrows
7382000	7384000	or shallow dens in the soil.
7384000	7386000	What?
7386000	7388000	Two. You have a very active imagination
7388000	7390000	my friend.
7390000	7392000	Two. You are in a surprisingly dense
7392000	7394000	forest with tall trees partially
7394000	7396000	obscuring the sunlight. You can hear birds
7396000	7398000	in the trees and little else. Nobody's
7398000	7400000	expecting
7400000	7402000	you to be able to tear trees down with your
7402000	7404000	hands but branches, leaves and possibly
7404000	7406000	fruits are accessible just
7406000	7408000	pretty high out of your immediate reach
7408000	7410000	save of course what's fallen on the forest floor.
7410000	7412000	What?
7412000	7414000	Guys you know when chat says is this an email
7414000	7416000	or is this a perv sex
7416000	7418000	thing? Three.
7418000	7420000	You wake up on the
7420000	7422000	main floor of a long abandoned mid-sized
7422000	7424000	suburban house with the windows and doors
7424000	7426000	boarded from the outside. There's no
7426000	7428000	electricity, water or gas and what furniture
7428000	7430000	is left is deteriorated but somewhat usable.
7430000	7432000	The stairs to the basement
7432000	7434000	have collapsed and you cannot see what is down there
7434000	7436000	but you know you are there alone.
7436000	7438000	All you can see between the boards over
7438000	7440000	the windows is a grassy field to the east
7440000	7442000	and a dense forest to the west.
7442000	7444000	Given what you know from gaming
7444000	7446000	TV and most importantly reality
7446000	7448000	which scenario would each of
7448000	7450000	you prefer to be in and why?
7450000	7452000	What?
7452000	7454000	And only
7454000	7456000	slightly disturbed Robert
7456000	7458000	M. This okay this is no no
7458000	7460000	I'm not even this is what you need to do Robert
7460000	7462000	M. like seriously you need to go download
7462000	7464000	Twine and start your text adventure
7464000	7466000	game because you've got a script
7466000	7468000	going here you clearly have an
7468000	7470000	active imagination for this stuff
7470000	7472000	just go make your game why didn't you
7472000	7474000	did you send in something for the game jam I don't think you did
7474000	7476000	so now's the time to start. Now
7476000	7478000	that Rob's tirade is over I have an answer. What was number two
7478000	7480000	again? I wasn't. That was being in the
7480000	7482000	dense forest. That's not my tirade
7482000	7484000	I'm not saying like I'm not like
7484000	7486000	anti this but I'm just saying you
7486000	7488000	go go I would vote for number two
7488000	7490000	if it were me. Okay. Because
7490000	7492000	in a forest where
7492000	7494000	you can hear wildlife you have the
7494000	7496000	potential if you need to make something to protect
7496000	7498000	yourself you can
7498000	7500000	find leaves
7500000	7502000	or you know
7502000	7504000	you can make shelter
7504000	7506000	in the woods you can find food
7506000	7508000	but it is much easier to find. In scenario
7508000	7510000	three you are in a shelter already it's
7510000	7512000	like fuck I don't have to make a shelter done
7512000	7514000	but you don't have food
7514000	7516000	yeah but you can go outside and
7516000	7518000	I gotta say I'm for scenario
7518000	7520000	one because it sounds like TLC
7520000	7522000	is naked and afraid which by the way
7522000	7524000	which by the way
7524000	7526000	the Golden Globes
7526000	7528000	were at the competition tonight
7528000	7530000	tonight was the gay Mormon show on
7530000	7532000	TLC that was tonight
7532000	7534000	oh my god
7534000	7536000	that just pisses me off. No it looks
7536000	7538000	you know what there comes a point where you go this just looks like
7538000	7540000	a fucking train wreck I have to see it. That is naked and afraid
7540000	7542000	what you've never heard of naked and afraid
7542000	7544000	oh my god
7544000	7546000	well thank you emailer now I can explain
7546000	7548000	to Loki what naked and afraid is all about
7548000	7550000	I'm going back to the wiki
7550000	7552000	there's a show on TV
7552000	7554000	and this show should be mixed with Five Nights at Freddy's
7554000	7556000	quite honestly no there's a show
7556000	7558000	where they take two people
7558000	7560000	and they're naked in the middle
7560000	7562000	of nowhere and yes they film it
7562000	7564000	they use the blur boxes right so you don't see nothing
7564000	7566000	you can't see on basic cable and
7566000	7568000	they just they have to survive for like I think it's
7568000	7570000	like three days or something like that out in the wilderness
7570000	7572000	and you know you watch
7572000	7574000	them go crazy and they're afraid of all
7574000	7576000	the sounds they hear out in the wilderness which is probably
7576000	7578000	just the camera man and all that
7578000	7580000	that's the show that is seriously a dumb ass
7580000	7582000	show that might be on
7582000	7584000	Discovery Channel not TLC maybe somebody
7584000	7586000	will correct me in chat well I'm glad that this is the new discovery
7586000	7588000	where they don't make up shit anymore
7588000	7590000	ha ha ha ha
7590000	7592000	discovered our lies
7592000	7594000	oh no
7594000	7596000	now the chat room is just
7596000	7598000	going off on this email take it as a compliment
7598000	7600000	though Robert M let's see
7600000	7602000	actdeft says Five Nights
7602000	7604000	Five Nights at Robert M's
7604000	7606000	let's see
7606000	7608000	says this guy is like a porn version of saw
7608000	7610000	SSG 100 Matt says
7610000	7612000	this feels like an SAT question
7612000	7614000	and fifth dream says PT
7614000	7616000	the email
7618000	7620000	you are standing in front of a house there is a
7620000	7622000	mailbox here
7622000	7624000	PS you're naked
7628000	7630000	I'm sorry it would be even freakier
7630000	7632000	though is it if you like went to bed like
7632000	7634000	you normally do like in pajamas
7634000	7636000	or whatever you wear to bed
7636000	7638000	and then just we're naked anyway
7638000	7640000	that would be freakier
7640000	7642000	hello is this a sex dream
7642000	7644000	hello
7644000	7646000	where's my hot person to bang
7646000	7648000	where are they
7648000	7650000	um
7650000	7652000	you know what Robert M it sounds
7652000	7654000	like you're really going to have to go with your gut
7654000	7656000	because literally each one of us voted for a different answer
7656000	7658000	so you're really going to have to just kind of go with your gut
7658000	7660000	and maybe make all three of your
7660000	7662000	interesting scenarios
7662000	7664000	but the way that he described them
7664000	7666000	they technically should be in the same universe
7666000	7668000	so you get a random scenario with each awakening
7668000	7670000	because the house seems like
7670000	7672000	it's stuck between the edge of the forest
7672000	7674000	and the field
7674000	7676000	so I think it's the same location
7676000	7678000	just different parts of it
7678000	7680000	but I'm still naked right
7680000	7682000	sexy times
7682000	7684000	la la la
7684000	7686000	la la

7850000	7852000	I can't really complain
7852000	7854000	my super busy week
7854000	7856000	but I am thankful
7856000	7858000	for this upcoming weekend I'm going to have the best
7858000	7860000	weekend ever this weekend so I'm excited
7860000	7862000	I'm so excited I can't hide it
7862000	7864000	there it is FU of the week
7864000	7866000	just a couple more stories
7866000	7868000	for you guys and then the phone call
7868000	7870000	time 1877 game OLR
7870000	7872000	or our username on skype
7872000	7874000	orange lounge radio but first lowkey
7874000	7876000	alright so layoffs
7876000	7878000	have hit Codemasters they're saying it's part of
7878000	7880000	their strategic realignment
7880000	7882000	with I don't know what exactly that means
7882000	7884000	making more
7884000	7886000	racing games is that part of the alignment
7886000	7888000	because that's what they're great at
7888000	7890000	but yeah small number
7890000	7892000	of roles have been proposed as being
7892000	7894000	a risk of redundancy so they
7894000	7896000	are removing that redundancy
7896000	7898000	they've cut 30 jobs
7898000	7900000	well
7900000	7902000	that's a shitty way to start off the new year
7902000	7904000	talking about layoffs already
7904000	7906000	unfortunately
7906000	7908000	this is also a common time for that to happen
7908000	7910000	yeah and at the same time while it is
7910000	7912000	unfortunate that they're cutting
7912000	7914000	jobs if you have jobs that are redundant
7914000	7916000	at your company maybe sometimes
7916000	7918000	it's
7918000	7920000	you're paying people to work
7920000	7922000	and if they're not
7922000	7924000	working as hard as they could be
7924000	7926000	maybe
7926000	7928000	slim your company down
7928000	7930000	make it more profitable
7930000	7932000	fifth dream in chat says that means
7932000	7934000	we fired people because we needed money
7934000	7936000	that's a
7936000	7938000	well I mean I don't know
7938000	7940000	they put out some
7940000	7942000	decent racing games I just don't know if they're like
7942000	7944000	top top top tier
7944000	7946000	alright well I got news
7946000	7948000	well not really news more like rumors
7948000	7950000	on another popular game
7950000	7952000	series raise your hand if you like
7952000	7954000	C-man
7954000	7956000	raise your hand everybody do you like C-man
7956000	7958000	really Rob you do
7958000	7960000	I do I love C-man
7960000	7962000	it's a great game and of course
7962000	7964000	I'm talking about the Sega
7964000	7966000	created game from the
7966000	7968000	Dreamcast system which
7968000	7970000	we talked about many times on this show before
7970000	7972000	of course that's what I'm talking about
7972000	7974000	and let's say there's a lot of fans
7974000	7976000	of C-man out there on the internet
7976000	7978000	web including Devolver Digital
7978000	7980000	you know the indie publisher
7980000	7982000	Devolver Digital right
7982000	7984000	the CEO Fork Parker on
7984000	7986000	Twitter just basically told
7986000	7988000	Sega we want to make a new game
7988000	7990000	in the series and then went directly
7990000	7992000	to the creator of C-man
7992000	7994000	saying we want to
7994000	7996000	do this and
7996000	7998000	apparently the creator replied
7998000	8000000	asking about formats
8000000	8002000	so this shows that
8002000	8004000	maybe there's a chance
8004000	8006000	I would love to see them have it
8006000	8008000	honestly because
8008000	8010000	Devolver is awesome so
8010000	8012000	I'm all down for that
8012000	8014000	I love this because Fork actually went to
8014000	8016000	Utsido and said hi if you still
8016000	8018000	own the rights to C-man then let's make a new one
8018000	8020000	and Utsido replied and said
8020000	8022000	hi for smartphone and
8022000	8024000	Fork Parker replied saying maybe PC and
8024000	8026000	smartphone so I thought it was interesting
8026000	8028000	for smartphone like maybe they're
8028000	8030000	already making one for smartphone who knows
8030000	8032000	so hmm
8032000	8034000	anyway
8034000	8036000	by the way if you didn't know and Dark
8036000	8038000	Sakura has surely covered this in a previous classic
8038000	8040000	game of the week because we love this game but
8040000	8042000	in C-man you
8042000	8044000	had a microphone and you actually would
8044000	8046000	interact with the fish
8046000	8048000	with the dude's face on the screen that was
8048000	8050000	Leonard Nimoy so I mean that
8050000	8052000	that alone was awesome right there that you
8052000	8054000	could talk to Leonard Nimoy and he would
8054000	8056000	say things that didn't make sense basically
8056000	8058000	so and they could friend his
8058000	8060000	butt and you could friend his butt like that one very
8060000	8062000	popular YouTube we played oh I don't even remember
8062000	8064000	the name of the guy who did that that was
8064000	8066000	one of my favorite YouTubes by the way
8066000	8068000	an official sequel was released for the
8068000	8070000	PlayStation 2 in 2007
8070000	8072000	in 2002 Nintendo was
8072000	8074000	apparently interested in resurrecting the series for
8074000	8076000	3DS but nothing ever came of that so
8076000	8078000	good luck Devolver Digital we hope you can do it
8078000	8080000	and spread C-man
8080000	8082000	all over the world that is
8082000	8084000	what we hope you guys are able to do
8084000	8086000	from all of us here at OLR
8086000	8088000	so
8088000	8090000	SSU100Matt is interested in this
8090000	8092000	only if Leonard Nimoy voices it apparently
8092000	8094000	over at live.vognetwork.com
8094000	8096000	let's see
8096000	8098000	and Kaijuto saying hopefully they can get
8098000	8100000	Leonard Nimoy that would be awesome
8100000	8102000	so
8102000	8104000	there you go let's open the phones
8104000	8106000	it's that time 1877 game

8144000	8146000	just
8146000	8148000	yeah just figured I'd call in
8148000	8150000	and see how this whole thing works
8150000	8152000	that was really fast I guess you guys have
8152000	8154000	probably been waiting longer than I could hear on the
8154000	8156000	on the stream there is a little bit of
8156000	8158000	a buffer but there's also a little trick too
8158000	8160000	where sometimes I open it up a little bit before
8160000	8162000	we're actually ready for the calls for just that reason
8162000	8164000	excellent excellent well what's on your mind
8164000	8166000	buddy not much
8166000	8168000	man it's been it's been a good show I
8168000	8170000	we we finished a
8170000	8172000	project for the for the bog jam
8172000	8174000	and that was a lot of fun and I
8174000	8176000	I've just been having a blast playing the entries
8176000	8178000	that have been rolling in so
8178000	8180000	so you've actually checked out some of the
8180000	8182000	entries that people were posting in the chat and so forth
8182000	8184000	see I've played none of them yet I'm gonna
8184000	8186000	wait and live stream it all but
8186000	8188000	is there any particular standouts
8188000	8190000	so far that you've noticed
8190000	8192000	I pretty much like everything that I've played so far
8192000	8194000	my my personal favorite right now
8194000	8196000	is a hitstunz game
8196000	8198000	skeleton hunter yeah
8198000	8200000	it just it just feels it felt so
8200000	8202000	much like when you it was
8202000	8204000	it it's like the perfect buggy
8204000	8206000	game it just felt so much like
8206000	8208000	you had just gone to a rental store in the
8208000	8210000	eighties and picked up the
8210000	8212000	NES cart that's not the right shape
8212000	8214000	you're like why is this the wrong shape and then you
8214000	8216000	you take it home and you you play through it anyway
8216000	8218000	even though it's terrible yeah what what what did
8218000	8220000	what did color dreams put out on the NES
8220000	8222000	this time it's
8222000	8224000	just it's just a it's just a platformer but like
8224000	8226000	like it it works like all the stuff
8226000	8228000	in the game works except for it also
8228000	8230000	there's a lot of things that that
8230000	8232000	you don't expect like you can stand on pretty much
8232000	8234000	anything including projectiles and they'll still hurt you
8234000	8236000	but you can just stand on them and and
8236000	8238000	like and there's
8238000	8240000	there's times when you can get to the edge of the
8240000	8242000	screen when you're not supposed to and it'll wrap
8242000	8244000	to the left hand side of the screen and you'll suddenly
8244000	8246000	be somewhere else and and and you
8246000	8248000	have to kind of like work through that stuff and there's
8248000	8250000	it's just it's just really great I really liked
8250000	8252000	it well I know he he was really gung-ho
8252000	8254000	about the idea right from he was there the night we
8254000	8256000	picked the thing in listless he was very excited
8256000	8258000	about it now we were we were
8258000	8260000	honored to have you guys from cooking with
8260000	8262000	unity participate not only that you
8262000	8264000	guys like taped the whole darn thing
8264000	8266000	so not only can we play your game we
8266000	8268000	can just watch you make it on
8268000	8270000	youtube yeah yeah we we we recorded
8270000	8272000	just shy of 12 hours
8272000	8274000	for the for the game and it was we showed
8274000	8276000	everything on the show except for one thing that we
8276000	8278000	kept as a surprise which was just which I'm
8278000	8280000	not going to say because I want you guys to play so
8280000	8282000	so a little little surprising can you give
8282000	8284000	us a brief overview of what your game's about
8284000	8286000	yeah yeah yeah what
8286000	8288000	we did is we made a
8288000	8290000	first person shooter just a really basic one
8290000	8292000	kind of doom style with like sprite characters
8292000	8294000	and stuff and then what we did
8294000	8296000	is we made it so that's not actually the game
8296000	8298000	the game is you have to find
8298000	8300000	bugs in the game and mark them
8300000	8302000	and so like the walls all
8302000	8304000	can randomly not work and so
8304000	8306000	if you find a wall that you can walk through you can
8306000	8308000	right click it and you'll mark it as a bug
8308000	8310000	and then like enemies can have the wrong
8310000	8312000	AIs and power ups can like
8312000	8314000	not power you up they can do the opposite
8314000	8316000	and so you have to find all the things that don't
8316000	8318000	work mark them and then complete the level and it
8318000	8320000	gives you a score out of what
8320000	8322000	bugs you found and what things you marked
8322000	8324000	erroneously so you basically made like
8324000	8326000	QA tester the game type of thing exactly
8326000	8328000	exactly wow that is so
8328000	8330000	clever I'm just I am really
8330000	8332000	blown away like that these
8332000	8334000	things we're talking about what you did
8334000	8336000	and what Hitstun did and what all our listeners
8336000	8338000	that are participating in this did I am just so
8338000	8340000	blown away by the mere fact that
8340000	8342000	this wouldn't exist if we
8342000	8344000	hadn't you know had the idea
8344000	8346000	so cool I'm glad you said the words
8346000	8348000	man just throw it out there
8348000	8350000	do more of these it's great so cool
8350000	8352000	well and there's still more to come too
8352000	8354000	I'm still very gung ho on completing
8354000	8356000	my own idea and I know there's others out there
8356000	8358000	that feel very similar I'm still gonna work on mine
8358000	8360000	I just I need to sleep cause I haven't
8360000	8362000	done that you know almost
8362000	8364000	in a few days and like I had to go to work
8364000	8366000	like early in the morning and work like a
8366000	8368000	nine hour day it's just it's about balance
8368000	8370000	I just have to like maybe I think
8370000	8372000	tomorrow I will just go to bed
8372000	8374000	early and then just kind of
8374000	8376000	sleep for a little bit well Max
8376000	8378000	we gotta say a big thank you to all you guys at Cookie
8378000	8380000	with Unity because that episode that
8380000	8382000	where we had you guys on we were talking about all that
8382000	8384000	that was really a huge motivator
8384000	8386000	and so I would argue that none of these games
8386000	8388000	would exist without that either so you
8388000	8390000	guys get a huge huge credit in
8390000	8392000	making this all happen well
8392000	8394000	thank you I think that's probably undeserved but thank you
8394000	8396000	I do think that just
8396000	8398000	you guys organizing this was awesome
8398000	8400000	and thank you for inviting me on the show like that came out of
8400000	8402000	nowhere and it was truly a pleasure
8402000	8404000	as far as the other two
8404000	8406000	games I just wanted to mention real quick
8406000	8408000	Umbria 4 I haven't played it much at all
8408000	8410000	but it's a text based adventure game and

8526000	8528000	yeah that the
8528000	8530000	game awards and the Sony

8536000	8538000	in Vegas oh it's
8538000	8540000	starting to become the same and then they always there's
8540000	8542000	always those rumors that E3 is gonna
8542000	8544000	move to Vegas although LA
8544000	8546000	LA is not gonna let that
8546000	8548000	happen without a huge fight so but
8548000	8550000	anyway but I digress
8550000	8552000	what's on your mind tonight buddy yeah
8552000	8554000	I just wanna talk a little bit more about
8554000	8556000	CES you know it's always you know
8556000	8558000	oh yeah CES of course
8558000	8560000	happening just this past week even though
8560000	8562000	usually not a lot of game content
8562000	8564000	out of CES but sometimes I mean
8564000	8566000	y'all know I still talk
8566000	8568000	about game room and that was something
8568000	8570000	that had come out of CES so sometimes you get a few things
8570000	8572000	here and there did you go and check it out
8572000	8574000	indeed indeed yeah I totally
8574000	8576000	checked it out and yeah
8576000	8578000	like it was interesting
8578000	8580000	cause the main theme I guess the main
8580000	8582000	trend this year was actually
8582000	8584000	VR gaming there was
8584000	8586000	quite a bit of demos
8586000	8588000	from a lot of the
8588000	8590000	companies kind of showing off their headsets
8590000	8592000	and they're
8592000	8594000	mobile they're like
8594000	8596000	forward walking things that you can
8596000	8598000	you know walk on while you
8598000	8600000	wear the headsets
8600000	8602000	what did you think did you actually get hands on
8602000	8604000	with like some of the big ones like the Oculus
8604000	8606000	or some of these other ones or what happened
8606000	8608000	no I didn't actually
8608000	8610000	get a chance to go hands on
8610000	8612000	there was a
8612000	8614000	there was only like one demo
8614000	8616000	for each of those
8616000	8618000	and there was a pretty huge line but
8618000	8620000	I watched a lot of people
8620000	8622000	play and you know
8622000	8624000	it was really
8624000	8626000	interesting though it was
8626000	8628000	so like the guy was
8628000	8630000	standing on this it was almost like
8630000	8632000	it looked like a treadmill
8632000	8634000	but it was like a stationary
8634000	8636000	platform
8636000	8638000	and the guy was wearing like really
8638000	8640000	like special shoes
8640000	8642000	that kind of like slide on it
8642000	8644000	this guy was at E3 too
8644000	8646000	they had like it looked like they were
8646000	8648000	actually at Kickstarter they were actually
8648000	8650000	in like the run and gun game like
8650000	8652000	they couldn't do demos
8652000	8654000	for us like with us in them because
8654000	8656000	of insurance purposes or whatever but I totally
8656000	8658000	know what you're talking about they were at E3 as well
8658000	8660000	oh okay okay yeah it was like the
8660000	8662000	the Virtuix Omni
8662000	8664000	or something something like that
8664000	8666000	I thought that was
8666000	8668000	kind of interesting I never saw the guy
8668000	8670000	like strafe left and right so I thought that was
8670000	8672000	interesting but yeah he was just kind of
8672000	8674000	doing his thing
8674000	8676000	it looked intense it looked like the
8676000	8678000	it looked like the gym of the future
8678000	8680000	it was an intense workout or as we always say
8680000	8682000	on OLR it's one step closer to the
8682000	8684000	holodeck
8684000	8686000	right right right
8686000	8688000	it was crazy
8688000	8690000	well you know Sony was there too
8690000	8692000	there wasn't you know it's not really
8692000	8694000	not too many games there
8694000	8696000	most of the time it's always like there are
8696000	8698000	other electronics but they were demoing
8698000	8700000	things like the order
8700000	8702000	1888 was like the main
8702000	8704000	thing they were they were demoing and
8704000	8706000	they had a few stations set up for
8706000	8708000	playstation now I guess
8708000	8710000	since they just announced their
8710000	8712000	their monthly
8712000	8714000	the subscription stuff right right right
8714000	8716000	right but yeah
8716000	8718000	it was other than that
8718000	8720000	the only
8720000	8722000	other gaming stuff
8722000	8724000	I thought was amusing
8724000	8726000	so you know
8726000	8728000	that shoe company
8728000	8730000	Skechers you probably
8730000	8732000	saw or you may have not seen that
8732000	8734000	news so they have these
8734000	8736000	shoes that like it's almost
8736000	8738000	like it's you know that
8738000	8740000	old like toy from
8740000	8742000	like the 80s Simon
8742000	8744000	yeah it's so
8744000	8746000	they put this like
8746000	8748000	contraption on their shoes and it's
8748000	8750000	called like the Skechers game
8750000	8752000	kicks and it's basically a giant
8752000	8754000	Simon like
8754000	8756000	toy like on your
8756000	8758000	sneakers and so
8758000	8760000	it lights up and like you could
8760000	8762000	like sit down and like play Simon
8762000	8764000	I saw a picture
8764000	8766000	of that somewhere out there and I thought
8766000	8768000	that was crazy I didn't realize that was Skechers I wear
8768000	8770000	I actually enjoy like not to endorse a
8770000	8772000	product I'm not being paid to endorse but I will say
8772000	8774000	I do usually wear Skechers
8774000	8776000	shoes one of my favorite ones I'm wearing them right now
8776000	8778000	and Loki's wearing them right now so
8778000	8780000	the fact that they're putting out a pair that has
8780000	8782000	Simon on it's kind of dumb
8782000	8784000	it is kind of dumb
8784000	8786000	but you know what it's no dumber than
8786000	8788000	Pumps remember
8788000	8790000	that was really dumb
8790000	8792000	but you know what I totally want though
8792000	8794000	Nike Back to the Future shoes that are gonna
8794000	8796000	self lace yeah you know Pumps really
8796000	8798000	are stupid because they do awful things to your feet
8798000	8800000	and your posture just saying
8800000	8802000	don't wear the high heels I love those things
8802000	8804000	as a kid I love those Pumps
8804000	8806000	you missed the joke
8806000	8808000	put your hand over your head you might catch it
8808000	8810000	well I wore those Pumps
8810000	8812000	as a kid too but anyway
8812000	8814000	and I've seen you
8814000	8816000	trace across the stage in them too
8816000	8818000	that's right I wasn't the rock you
8818000	8820000	wore a picture show for how long? I think I've worn
8820000	8822000	a pair of Pumps in my life anyway
8822000	8824000	oh Vidpower

8872000	8874000	get to while we wait for the oh
8874000	8876000	since we talked about it earlier Puzzles and Dragons
8876000	8878000	they have a
8878000	8880000	statistic that they've exceeded
8880000	8882000	42 million downloads worldwide
8882000	8884000	worldwide wow so that was 6 million
8884000	8886000	in the US but 42 million worldwide
8886000	8888000	wow alright let's go to the phones hi you're on
8888000	8890000	OrangeLoungeRadio who's this hey this is
8890000	8892000	actdeaf actdeaf oh my god is that a fat
8892000	8894000	chocobo plushie you have right now yeah
8894000	8896000	it is that
8896000	8898000	is so cute where did you get that
8898000	8900000	I got it from Amazon
8900000	8902000	actually it's uh
8902000	8904000	it's kinda expensive it's like
8904000	8906000	$75 what
8906000	8908000	that's too much money is that
8908000	8910000	an official Square product or is that like a knock
8910000	8912000	off something no yeah it's official
8912000	8914000	huh well Rob
8914000	8916000	but it's only sold in Japan
8916000	8918000	so that's why it's so expensive because
8918000	8920000	it's also really big I want one
8920000	8922000	it's so cute yeah that's like as big
8922000	8924000	as like his face is as big as your face
8924000	8926000	that is yeah huge chocobo
8926000	8928000	alright that's adorable though I want to hug
8928000	8930000	it I'm hugging it you can't
8930000	8932000	see me but I'm hugging my computer screen right
8932000	8934000	now that fat chocobo is so adorable
8934000	8936000	alright well anyways
8936000	8938000	uh something related to
8938000	8940000	importing and especially because
8940000	8942000	of the of Nintendo
8942000	8944000	retiring the Wii U and its market
8944000	8946000	of Brazil
8946000	8948000	it's like already has been
8948000	8950000	said it's because of taxes and
8950000	8952000	import fees that's something
8952000	8954000	that I have talked about before
8954000	8956000	in OLR but still
8956000	8958000	it's something worth bringing up
8958000	8960000	again because
8960000	8962000	it's something really that
8962000	8964000	affects every single
8964000	8966000	gamer in Latin America
8966000	8968000	from Mexico to Argentina
8968000	8970000	so it's something that
8970000	8972000	that everyone in Latin America can
8972000	8974000	relate to Brazil so it's not
8974000	8976000	something that surprises
8976000	8978000	us even
8978000	8980000	for a company just
8980000	8982000	to say no we're not selling
8982000	8984000	our product there because it's
8984000	8986000	way too expensive especially with
8986000	8988000	Nintendo and their finances
8988000	8990000	right now so it's pretty obvious
8990000	8992000	right
8992000	8994000	we have heard the stories
8994000	8996000	of the PS4 selling for
8996000	8998000	way over like four times
8998000	9000000	the time
9000000	9002000	sorry the cost in the US
9002000	9004000	like here even
9004000	9006000	it basically costs not
9006000	9008000	double but
9008000	9010000	it costs at least half more
9010000	9012000	what it should cost in the
9012000	9014000	US well and you've talked about this before
9014000	9016000	on the show about like living in Mexico
9016000	9018000	you you know will
9018000	9020000	pay more just like in many
9020000	9022000	ways funny enough like your fat chocobo
9022000	9024000	that you have there is like even in the US
9024000	9026000	I'm gonna pay more money for that because
9026000	9028000	I have to get it from Japan so I gotta
9028000	9030000	pay those import fees and everybody
9030000	9032000	along the way from Square Enix
9032000	9034000	in Japan to me here in the States
9034000	9036000	everybody along the way that little fat chocobo
9036000	9038000	passes through is gonna want their cut
9038000	9040000	yeah exactly that's
9040000	9042000	the point I have the
9042000	9044000	the fortune
9044000	9046000	or the luck
9046000	9048000	sorry of living
9048000	9050000	next to the US
9050000	9052000	so I get my stuff delivered
9052000	9054000	in a PO box over there
9054000	9056000	in the border city next to us
9056000	9058000	but
9058000	9060000	so yeah I have the luck of that
9060000	9062000	but I have other friends
9062000	9064000	who live
9064000	9066000	live very
9066000	9068000	deep in the country or even
9068000	9070000	South American friends that
9070000	9072000	that have to pay import fees
9072000	9074000	so even if I had ordered
9074000	9076000	this like from eBay because
9076000	9078000	it's also there and have
9078000	9080000	send it directly
9080000	9082000	to Mexico I have to pay more
9082000	9084000	fees I have to pay a more
9084000	9086000	expensive shipping fee and even
9086000	9088000	import fees because of
9088000	9090000	how much it costs and the size
9090000	9092000	and the
9092000	9094000	sorry and the weight and all that
9094000	9096000	and it would have been way
9096000	9098000	more expensive to get it
9098000	9100000	now 5th Dream in chat is yelling
9100000	9102000	smuggler with little face there
9102000	9104000	but you know and I'm sure he's just teasing
9104000	9106000	but I mean don't aren't you
9106000	9108000	kinda left with no other choice
9108000	9110000	yeah it's basically that
9110000	9112000	or just pay way
9112000	9114000	more for it because it's really
9114000	9116000	it's really crazy how
9116000	9118000	how taxes work here
9118000	9120000	because for every single
9120000	9122000	thing you have to pay something more
9122000	9124000	almost so
9124000	9126000	for me to get something like this
9126000	9128000	I seriously have to
9128000	9130000	to do some loopholes
9130000	9132000	to the law to get it
9132000	9134000	so yeah well we have to pay taxes
9134000	9136000	too on everything we buy with the
9136000	9138000	sales tax usually unless I live
9138000	9140000	in Oregon or something but even then
9140000	9142000	something's being taxed be it income property
9142000	9144000	etc etc
9144000	9146000	but wow I mean yeah I mean
9146000	9148000	I know it's sometimes with the
9148000	9150000	trade and stuff it's very interesting
9150000	9152000	how that all works and complicated
9152000	9154000	you know and like you said
9154000	9156000	Mexico may have it a little
9156000	9158000	bit easier because of its closer proximity
9158000	9160000	to the US than a place like
9160000	9162000	Brazil but at the end of the day
9162000	9164000	it's still
9164000	9166000	the same is that there's all these taxes
9166000	9168000	and yeah crazy crazy
9168000	9170000	it is and
9170000	9172000	there are many people here that
9172000	9174000	that do a lot of stuff to get
9174000	9176000	like
9176000	9178000	video game things, anime
9178000	9180000	things just to
9180000	9182000	to
9182000	9184000	to maintain a hobby
9184000	9186000	it's really something you have to
9186000	9188000	be careful of
9188000	9190000	in terms of
9190000	9192000	expenses because
9192000	9194000	yeah you can pay probably
9194000	9196000	a lot cheaper price
9196000	9198000	than what you would pay in a regular
9198000	9200000	store here and I can
9200000	9202000	make many many examples
9202000	9204000	of it
9204000	9206000	but like I said especially with
9206000	9208000	this Chicago plush
9208000	9210000	I paid $75
9210000	9212000	which converted to
9212000	9214000	pesos it's something
9214000	9216000	around the 1000 pesos mark
9216000	9218000	but like I said
9218000	9220000	I would have paid probably
9220000	9222000	like 1500 pesos
9222000	9224000	1500 pesos
9224000	9226000	just to have it brought over
9226000	9228000	here directly
9228000	9230000	and especially because it would have
9230000	9232000	taken way longer and it's
9232000	9234000	like way
9234000	9236000	way more
9236000	9238000	of a hassle
9238000	9240000	I have the experience of a
9240000	9242000	beta memory card 64 gigabytes
9242000	9244000	that they don't sell in the
9244000	9246000	US
9246000	9248000	it took around two
9248000	9250000	months to get here
9250000	9252000	directly
9252000	9254000	yeah
9254000	9256000	well you know what
9256000	9258000	thank you I think this all serves
9258000	9260000	as a humble reminder is that gamers
9260000	9262000	are everywhere but access to
9262000	9264000	games a lot of times depends on
9264000	9266000	where you're fortunate enough to be
9266000	9268000	so a humble reminder
9268000	9270000	there that some people have to pay
9270000	9272000	a little more to play the games that some of us take
9272000	9274000	for granted thank gosh though for PC
9274000	9276000	and all that that PC and digital distribution
9276000	9278000	really cuts a lot out of it doesn't it
9278000	9280000	yeah and I have called
9280000	9282000	also about this on Steam
9282000	9284000	the Steam sells here the games
9284000	9286000	way cheaper than in the US
9286000	9288000	so well not all the
9288000	9290000	games but most games on Steam
9290000	9292000	so that helps a lot
9292000	9294000	but still building
9294000	9296000	a PC or buying PC parts here
9296000	9298000	it's expensive but in the long term
9298000	9300000	yeah it's way better you can't play Nintendo
9300000	9302000	games on PC well not legally
9302000	9304000	alright well you take
9304000	9306000	care Akdev thank you for the call appreciate the
9306000	9308000	new perspective
9308000	9310000	hey thanks for having me you're welcome
9310000	9312000	and that fat chocobo is so freaking cute
9312000	9314000	alright bye
9314000	9316000	if I didn't have a trip to Seattle
9316000	9318000	coming up this weekend I'd be checking my wallet right now
9318000	9320000	do I have $75 in the car
9320000	9322000	could I do it?
9322000	9324000	cause I kinda want it dark soccer I want that fat chocobo
9324000	9326000	if I buy one it's for me
9326000	9328000	can you buy two?
9328000	9330000	well you remember
9330000	9332000	you remember Julie had that
9332000	9334000	rappy oh yes I remember the rappy
9334000	9336000	she paid like $105
9336000	9338000	but rappies are really cute too
9338000	9340000	that's basically fantasy
9340000	9342000	star online's version of a fat chocobo in a way
9342000	9344000	in a way
9344000	9346000	anyway one more call for calls
9346000	9348000	1877 game OLR
9348000	9350000	username on skype orange lounge radio
9350000	9352000	we don't usually do more than three calls but
9352000	9354000	we have a little extra time on tonight's show just because the news
9354000	9356000	ran a little faster tonight isn't that weird
9356000	9358000	we had like literally no news the past couple weeks
9358000	9360000	we ran longer of course we had some list lists
9360000	9362000	and some other segments to fill time
9362000	9364000	but we will try to take a couple more calls
9364000	9366000	1877 game OLR username on skype orange lounge radio
9366000	9368000	Loki let me check in with you again
9368000	9370000	to see if you have any other last minute stories
9370000	9372000	no I don't have any last minute stories
9372000	9374000	I'm working on my game now
9374000	9376000	I guess we covered it all any progress on your game?
9376000	9378000	what are you working on right this minute what are you trying to do?
9378000	9380000	right this minute I'm trying to
9380000	9382000	set up something that
9382000	9384000	when I get on the starting line
9384000	9386000	in this one spot that it stops for a second so that I can do
9386000	9388000	a countdown and then it lets me go
9388000	9390000	so I'm trying to figure out how to turn off
9390000	9394000	the acceleration on my car script
9394000	9396000	I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to cheat
9396000	9398000	by having it hold down the handbrake
9398000	9400000	so it can't move
9400000	9402000	because hey it works
9402000	9404000	but it's just
9404000	9406000	it's not exactly the way you should do it
9406000	9408000	alright well we have some stories sent to us
9408000	9410000	from folks on Twitter
9410000	9412000	I always love to hear from folks on Twitter
9412000	9414000	over at Twitter.com slash OLR
9414000	9416000	and Jason or username
9416000	9418000	I am Jason C. sent us a tweet
9418000	9420000	and the headline on this is
9420000	9422000	EB Games is removing all copies
9422000	9424000	of Elder Scrolls Online from stores
9424000	9426000	uh oh
9426000	9428000	Spaghetti-O although I believe this is Australia
9428000	9430000	but let me look
9430000	9432000	I'm looking at this story here
9432000	9434000	that says all copies of
9434000	9436000	Elder Scrolls Online including the prepaid cards
9436000	9438000	are to be sent back to the publisher
9438000	9440000	everything relating to the game
9440000	9442000	would be removed by January 13th
9442000	9444000	now they did issue an update to this
9444000	9446000	and EB Games said on their Facebook page
9446000	9448000	that this removal is part of a normal stock recall
9448000	9450000	which would
9450000	9452000	include numerous video games
9452000	9454000	so
9454000	9456000	the source apparently
9456000	9458000	had said that other titles mentioned in the list
9458000	9460000	are excess stock however
9460000	9462000	whereas Elder Scrolls Online was
9462000	9464000	all stock including the prepaid
9464000	9466000	cards you know what that normally means
9466000	9468000	because the last time I saw
9468000	9470000	something like that where they recalled the stock
9470000	9472000	it's because it's going free to play
9472000	9474000	it was DC Universe and you know
9474000	9476000	what else is very interesting
9476000	9478000	is on Hoard House this week
9478000	9480000	plug plug for my other show on Wednesdays
9480000	9482000	on Hoard House this week we talked about that they were
9482000	9484000	getting rid of the six month subscription plan
9484000	9486000	that was already
9486000	9488000	going away you could no longer get the six month
9488000	9490000	subscription plan and some folks were
9490000	9492000	taking that as a sign that the game was getting
9492000	9494000	ready for free to play
9494000	9496000	that's two
9496000	9498000	that's two signs now
9498000	9500000	just because that's what happened
9500000	9502000	last well with DC Universe
9502000	9504000	they recalled the stock they gave us
9504000	9506000	basically like a window of like
9506000	9508000	you have to return it by this date
9508000	9510000	but it was shortly
9510000	9512000	it was right after they announced it was going free to play
9512000	9514000	but if they're anticipating that it's going
9514000	9516000	free to play they may do the same thing
9516000	9518000	or just maybe it's just not
9518000	9520000	selling and they have an opportunity
9520000	9522000	to send it back and get
9522000	9524000	reimbursed for it because they're just not
9524000	9526000	selling copies
9526000	9528000	very interesting well thank you for the tip there
9528000	9530000	Jason it looks like those of you that have
9530000	9532000	wanted to play Elder Scrolls Online but didn't want to pay
9532000	9534000	to do it well you might get
9534000	9536000	your chance here coming soon we'll see
9536000	9538000	anyway since the Skype line isn't ringing again I think
9538000	9540000	everybody who wanted to get through did get through thank you
9540000	9542000	to those that called in if you think of something
9542000	9544000	after the fact you want to get in touch with us later
9544000	9546000	you can always tweet us twitter.com slash
9546000	9548000	olr or you can send us an email
9548000	9550000	of course participate at orange
9550000	9552000	launch radio.com tell us about your dreams
9552000	9554000	just uh you know
9554000	9556000	tell us how tell us how the
9556000	9558000	the game Mormon show went tonight or the golden
9558000	9560000	globes why not let us know
9560000	9562000	we'd prefer though if you keep
9562000	9564000	it about video games but I suppose anything
9564000	9566000	is going to turn into a tangent here on
9566000	9568000	olr but I think that's what you guys appreciate
9568000	9570000	don't play all the vogjam entries that's right
9570000	9572000	check out the vogjam entries if nothing
9572000	9574000	else there's uh now they're kind of a
9574000	9576000	little bit all over the place
9576000	9578000	so what we're going to do in the coming days at
9578000	9580000	vognetwork we're going to do an article
9580000	9582000	for the site that will summarize where you
9582000	9584000	can check them all out now some of them
9584000	9586000	are very easily accessible at vognetwork.com
9586000	9588000	they've been added to the arcade a couple
9588000	9590000	I know at least hitstun's game that
9590000	9592000	Max was talking about and Bobby
9592000	9594000	Blackwolf's game he participated too
9594000	9596000	uh I know at least those two are right
9596000	9598000	there on the vog website so very easy to
9598000	9600000	find uh the rest are there's a lot
9600000	9602000	of them plugged in the forums but we
9602000	9604000	will um have an article in this
9604000	9606000	coming week that will kind of compile everything
9606000	9608000	for you uh with one place to go
9608000	9610000	and then of course as I said I'm going to go through and play
9610000	9612000	them all at least the ones that I can stream
9612000	9614000	because I just realized I think one of the I think
9614000	9616000	one of the entries we got was a card game
9616000	9618000	so that might be a little harder to do
9618000	9620000	uh but well you never
9620000	9622000	I might be able to YouTube it
9622000	9624000	try to get dark soccer over
9624000	9626000	here we'll play a card game it'll be fun
9626000	9628000	we'll put it on YouTube
9628000	9630000	like the vogjam entry that's a card game
9630000	9632000	that we got not a piece of meat
9632000	9634000	I mean like what? I'm kidding
9634000	9636000	anyway
9636000	9638000	um I want to thank you

9660000	9662000	kind one on iTunes this week
9662000	9664000	that was so awesome and I wish I had it
9664000	9666000	in front of me but of course now that I'm thinking
9666000	9668000	about it I don't have the review up in front of me
9668000	9670000	I'll see if I can get it while we're doing our
9670000	9672000	final thoughts here but yeah
9672000	9674000	I really appreciate that stuff and we all do
9674000	9676000	here at Orange Lawns Radio so even if
9676000	9678000	you know even if you've told
9678000	9680000	a friend or two about the show and you're still wondering
9680000	9682000	what you can do to help us out those
9682000	9684000	reviews and things go a long
9684000	9686000	long long way so we really appreciate it
9686000	9688000	whether it be on iTunes or Stitcher Radio
9688000	9690000	or wherever it is you heard
9690000	9692000	about Orange Lawns Radio that stuff really
9692000	9694000	helps out
9694000	9696000	we will not be here next
9696000	9698000	week reminder we're taking a little
9698000	9700000	holiday break a late holiday but we will
