This week, Nintendo started the first full week of the year off with news of a partnership allowing their flagship series characters to be used in a non-Nintendo game. There's plenty of other movement as we progress into 2015, and we'll tell you more along with your comments, calls, and emails right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:45.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this January 11th of 2015, episode number 583 of our show.

00:46.000 --> 01:01.000
And we are here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle over the next three hours with you guys, all our live participants and podcast participants, and us here in studio. My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
And is that your final word on the matter?

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
No.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
How are you?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
I'm in recovery.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
In recovery? Are you hungover?

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
No, I had a bad migraine yesterday, so my head has that weird numb feeling today.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Oh, those are no fun.

01:18.000 --> 01:27.000
Yeah, so I have a sinus infection. I am taking antibiotics. I'm going to have great skin in about another few days.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
You sound really good for having a sinus infection, so you must be a couple days into meds.

01:31.000 --> 01:42.000
It hurts, but I've been on the antibiotics for about a week now, so I do mostly better, but it's just like, oh, come on, I had the flu, then it's a sinus infection, what's next, pneumonia?

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Don't ask.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Actually, that is what happened last time I had a major sinus infection.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
Be careful what you wish for. You better knock on wood. Well, if you need me to turn down some lights here in Studio N7, just let me know.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
That's fine.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Luckily, it's not a TV show.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Just get me Pinkberry later.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
Why don't you do OLR like a video? Why don't you do like a feed of stuff? To be fair, we used to do a long time ago.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Because, no.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
But that would involve extra lighting, which is going to make an ace even worse.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Because, no. That's why. Because, no.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Because it's Orange Lingerino, not Orange Lingerino.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
No.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Also here tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Hi.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Hi, how are you, Loki?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Tired.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Tired? Yeah, I see you got an ample, ample supply of Red Bull here in the studio tonight.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
It's the only thing that's keeping me awake.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
If you ever want to start drinking coffee, let me know. We got a coffee maker.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
I drink coffee too, but...

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Oh, do you?

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
I don't like it.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Yeah?

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Blasphemy.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Like the white mochas and crap.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Oh, Starbucks. Like the, you know.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
Oh, I want a mochaccino, and I want soy, and I want three pumps sugar-free vanilla.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Oh, fuck that shit.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Okay, Mr. Non-Fat Latte.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Which is my actual order, just so you know.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Just kidding.

02:58.000 --> 03:05.000
See, I can, I could go to any Starbucks and order, I could go anywhere and order Rob a drink as long as it has caramel and is non-fat.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Is that, okay, is that so bad? Non-fat milk is not, is not so bad.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
It's like milk flavored water.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
I know, I know, but...

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
I wholly agree.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
But if you have the whole, like, my body doesn't like dairy things and it's a good way to save on fat, then I don't think it's so bad.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
The drinks turn off, it has coffee in it still, it's the most important part.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
The coffee melts some butter and pours it inside.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
You know, I actually...

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
That's how you get fat.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
No, that's bulletproof coffee. Fat is good for you.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Fat is good for you.

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
A little fat is good for you. Like, fat in, like, peanuts is good, but fat in french fries from McDonald's is not so good for you.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Well, they're not really food anyways.

03:45.000 --> 03:54.000
Eating, eating whole foods that has not been processed is better for you than eating food that's been extra processed.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
But frappuccinos have been processed, as delicious as they are.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
That's okay, I'll still get my Americano.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
Alright, uh, look, we have our chatters, the live chat room every week.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
We only have them if they bring me coffee.

04:07.000 --> 04:15.000
Over at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
And if you are listening live tonight, first off, thank you, you've chosen us over the Golden Globes.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
And I hope that, I hope that it made...

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
You made the smart choice.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
Yeah, you made the right choice, so I hope that didn't make you go, oh shit, and turn this off and go turn the Golden Globes on.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Anything you need to see will be on YouTube tomorrow.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Although if you're listening to this on Monday, it's too late.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
It's too late, you missed it.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Haha, you're stuck with us for three hours.

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
Alright, anyway, let's see, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
Alan Alchemy says, Sky wants to get a sinus infection in the days before his Seattle trip.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
So don't, don't breathe on me, Jamie.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
My response is that sinus infections are not contagious.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
It's bacteria because of the weirdness in my nose from the flu.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
Fifth Dream in chat says, Starbucks, I'd like a coffee, what's that?

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
No, no, no, I'm sorry, that would be Dutch Brothers.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
No, no, no, Starbucks says, I'd like coffee, do you want it triple burnt?

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
I prefer Dunkin Donuts where I get my sugar scoops with a side of coffee.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
If I'm going to go anywhere, if I'm going to go anywhere for froufrou coffee, I will go to Dutch Brothers.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Do you even have any of those in Sacramento?

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Yeah, there's like five of them.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Where? All over the place.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Any near me without giving my address away on air?

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Um, there's one on Garfield.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Oh, well shit, I did not, alright.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
There's one by my house.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
I was checking Odie and Nirmal this whole time.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
But, but obviously if I'm going to get like actual coffee at a chain, I'm going to go to Pete's.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Yeah, Pete's is pretty good. Anyway, uh, let's see, Alan Alchemy in chat says,

05:44.000 --> 05:50.000
Non fat milk for when you don't want coffee black, but also don't want to be farty, bloaty, all fucking day just for some caffeine.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Thank you. Thank you, Alan Alchemy.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
You have an eloquence with words that sometimes me hosting a radio show for 13 years, I fail with.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
I'm a milk. I'm a milk latte.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
It's okay. It's okay.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
It's okay. Alan really likes that stuff. I'm not, I'm not big on that.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
Act Deft and chat says he's watching the Golden Globes while listening to OLR.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
No. No.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
As long as they're muted.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Please. I'll put on the mask if I have to and chain you to the wall.

06:16.000 --> 06:24.000
Make your choice. All right. Uh, anyway, uh, let's get into our show tonight and we'll talk about our gaming weeks, the types of games we've been playing this week.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
But obviously this was a big week over the voice geeks network.

06:28.000 --> 06:35.000
Uh, we had the vog game jam going on this week, uh, which was the effort to get more people to create things.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
Uh, and we picked a theme a few weeks ago on the show, which was a buggy game through our highly scientific listless process.

06:42.000 --> 06:49.000
Um, a few of you have submitted games. Uh, I saw about seven emails come in, which to be honest, I only thought there was going to be like maybe three.

06:50.000 --> 06:59.000
So the fact that even like we got seven, uh, and that's just the people that remembered to actually send in an official email, which is what you were supposed to do before the deadline for the thing on the forums.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
But I have a feeling we're going to get even more than that in the coming days, uh, because there's a lot of people that weren't able to finish their stuff.

07:05.000 --> 07:15.000
Like I saw like YYR on Twitter, which is funny enough, YYR kind of inspired this whole idea and he wasn't able to finish his thing just because of IRL stuff, but I'm pretty sure he'll end up submitting something late.

07:16.000 --> 07:23.000
Um, and Loki, I know your project was extremely ambitious and the deadline has come and gone and...

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
I tried and I was super stressed out and tired this entire week.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
You tried, Goldstar, you tried.

07:28.000 --> 07:34.000
I just like, you know, try working eight hours after sleeping, only a couple hours a day for two weeks.

07:35.000 --> 07:46.000
Yeah. But what's interesting is that, you know, seeing what you have on YouTube and hearing about, I haven't, I haven't seen what you have built in Unity right now, but it seems like you've actually got a game.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
It's just not to that level that you wanted it to be at right now.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Well, you have a car that can drive around a track.

07:52.000 --> 07:59.000
Yeah. I've got, I've got that. I've got checkpoints and I just don't have it all hooked together, I guess. And I don't have levels.

08:00.000 --> 08:17.000
Well, and it's not necessarily a racing game on top of that. Um, that's the funny part about it. It's more like, um, sort of like a WarioWare type of game because basically each level, as I mentioned before, is, um, it's broken in a different way.

08:17.000 --> 08:29.000
And so it's, you know, one level you may have to race to the finish line, you know, in the quickest time. Another level, it may be, oh crap, you have to survive for a certain amount of time or other things that get thrown your way.

08:30.000 --> 08:40.000
And just, but that sounds very ambitious because you're trying to, you have to, that you have to build each one of those, those different criteria instead of taking just one of them and getting your project.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
I see why you didn't finish.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
Yeah, I even tried. I was like, okay, well maybe I just scrapped something together real quick, but yeah, it just, it wasn't.

08:48.000 --> 08:56.000
Yeah. Um, which, um, you know, and then YYR is in chat room saying that, you know, it was a week to come up with the idea and then a couple of hectic weeks of work.

08:57.000 --> 09:06.000
You know what? I can't pick on YYR because I'm in the same boat is that, you know, I was unable to finish my project because I had my day job stuff come into play, which, you know, I don't make apologies for that.

09:06.000 --> 09:17.000
The day job pays for this. So stuff with that will always come first as policy. I don't talk about, and as you can imagine with a lot of the crap that happened on Twitter in 2014, you can see why I'm not always up front.

09:18.000 --> 09:32.000
Heaven forbid I say something that pisses the wrong person off on this program. So I, I don't really talk about my day job on air, but, um, you know, I had to basically say, I'm not going to get done with the project cause I have the day job in the way, but is, does that mean it was a total failure?

09:32.000 --> 09:48.000
No, I don't think so at all because I feel more empowered now than I did a few weeks ago. Um, making a game really felt unattainable. It really did. Like I just like, you know, I can play them and I can comment on them and I can make silly games and games and other games.

09:49.000 --> 09:55.000
But this whole unity thing, I was like, Oh, that's for people that studied computer science in college. That's for, that's for people that have more background than I do.

09:55.000 --> 10:04.000
But I think something I learned through this whole process and I, I think the, you know, once again, the cooking with unity guys who were on about a month ago on the show for this, and I think Loki for this in large part.

10:05.000 --> 10:20.000
I think a lot of you for this as well as that, you know, helping to show that unity is something you can do. So I did download install unity. I had an idea. I started to do some very basic motion things, but unfortunately that's only as far as I could get.

10:20.000 --> 10:30.000
My idea was stupid simple though. And I do want to finish it at some point. And in a nutshell, um, my idea was taking and everybody knows the fly swatter game and Mario paint, right? Everybody knows that game. Everybody loves that game.

10:31.000 --> 10:42.000
Uh, I was going to take that concept and reverse it basically that you're the fly and you're trying to dodge all the swatters. Uh, and that was, that was, you know, and I wanted to keep, I wanted to keep it like Atari 2,600 level basic.

10:42.000 --> 10:53.000
Um, and I kinda was fleshing that out when, uh, in one of the very, very early cooking with unity videos, which I was using to really help me, uh, learn the thing we, they were talking about.

10:54.000 --> 11:05.000
You could kind of have like a consistent motion, but you can also have that be altered with what the game pad does. So I wanted the flies movement to be very erratic and difficult to control.

11:05.000 --> 11:15.000
And then that would kind of be the, the bugginess of the game as well as, you know, the fact that it was literally about a bug. So that was my idea. And it was really funny as Loki was like, I could build that in like an hour.

11:16.000 --> 11:25.000
You want me to just do my, do your game for you? And I'm like, wait, no, no, that's not the point. I should have just jacked my idea. I'm like, that's not the point.

11:26.000 --> 11:36.000
That would have, that would have ruined the whole thing. So unfortunately, you know, I don't have anything to present today, but I feel still like there was a success.

11:36.000 --> 11:47.000
We've, we've crossed a point that we might not have otherwise. So I'm, I'm happy with that in that regard, but focusing less on the negative of, of me and focusing on the positive of you guys.

11:47.000 --> 11:57.000
I'm, I'm really happy to see what was submitted out there. And the fact that so many of you participated and funny enough, I saw that the Cooking with Unity guys were participating too.

11:57.000 --> 12:06.000
I don't know what it was they were doing. I didn't watch it because I wanted to be surprised, but I saw that they have several videos chronicling the whole thing from start to finish.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
Yeah, that's pretty awesome. I was listening to it while I worked on my game.

12:09.000 --> 12:18.000
Oh, that's so amazing. So what I did do, and here's what I can do because I didn't finish, but I am still, you know, the voice you hear on this show.

12:18.000 --> 12:33.000
And one thing I did promise to do anyway, I'm going to go through each and every game and live stream it and do some playing and some, you know, tongue in cheek feedback, which means obviously I'm not going to be overly harsh to people that have worked very hard to create games.

12:33.000 --> 12:42.000
But I will give, you know, my own sassy commentary on whatever it is you guys have created and, you know, try to at least bring a little attention to the great stuff that you guys did.

12:42.000 --> 12:48.000
And maybe encourage some more people to check them out because it looks like there's some pretty intricate stuff out there.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
I have to do it again.

12:49.000 --> 12:59.000
I know. Well, here's the thing. Here's, here's my thing. I refuse to do another game jam. And I haven't even talked to Bobby about this, but this is the way it is in my mind right now.

12:59.000 --> 13:13.000
I will not do another game jam until I finish this one. Period. So you all can do, I will not do another game jam until I finish this one. It's very important. I want to at least do it.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
Finishing something is the hardest thing you can do.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
It is.

13:17.000 --> 13:23.000
Yeah. Since the last 10%, but I haven't even gotten to the last 10% yet. And so, yeah.

13:23.000 --> 13:32.000
I'm hoping maybe in about a month when things calm down a little bit, because like, honestly, here's the, if I could have, and you know what's funny when Bobby and I were talking about this earlier, what should the day be?

13:32.000 --> 13:42.000
What should the day be? The original time I had suggested was Martin Luther King weekend, which is this next weekend, because then Monday was off work and I could have spent that day playing all the submissions.

13:42.000 --> 13:49.000
Well, now Alan and I are going to Seattle, so that wouldn't have worked either. But if I could have gotten two more weeks, somehow out of that, I could have finished.

13:49.000 --> 13:58.000
So my personal goal is to try and finish it in two weeks. That's my goal, because obviously it won't happen this next weekend with Seattle and everything.

13:58.000 --> 14:07.000
But now that things at work have calmed down significantly, I'm hoping in that next week I can finish it, because it's supposed to be a simple concept. So we'll see.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Here it is.

14:11.000 --> 14:25.000
All right. Let's see. Going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com. Let's see. PushyPixels in chat says, that's not a great idea. You should do all the jams and make pong first. It helps.

14:25.000 --> 14:34.000
No, I don't want to sound like I'm saying, I'm just saying for me personally, I feel awfully stupid endorsing this whole thing when I couldn't even finish myself.

14:34.000 --> 14:49.000
But I do, I still feel like I accomplished something. I came out ahead, but it wasn't as much as I would have wanted to do. But I got a paycheck that keeps the show going. That's something that I accomplished.

14:50.000 --> 14:57.000
Anyway. And yyr in chat says, the 80-20 rule, the last 20% of the game takes 80% of the effort. Isn't that the truth?

14:57.000 --> 15:07.000
Well, god damn it. Considering the two that I've worked on, the first few percentages, that's taken a lot of effort, so I can't imagine what the last...

15:07.000 --> 15:21.000
Yeah. We'll see. Maybe it depends on the way you did it. Let's see. And some folks in chat, some more comments. BlackWolf says, I learned a lot about the new UI in 4.6. So that's good.

15:21.000 --> 15:31.000
And PushyPixels says, it's great you guys set this thing up. So thank you. Again, I'm loving that there's more participation than I really would have expected.

15:31.000 --> 15:42.000
I honestly would have been blown away if we got three entries. I figured, okay, we'd probably have Bobby, yyr, and we'll have that fringe person I didn't know about that they'll actually end up submitting something.

15:42.000 --> 15:54.000
Like that's what I figured would be the participation in the game jam. But to see all these other people too, and including, there's been more, there's been people that have said,

15:54.000 --> 16:03.000
I listen to OLR, and I've never really participated with the show, but I wanted to do this. That was totally unexpected.

16:03.000 --> 16:09.000
Well that didn't want to impress everybody, so I was like, well I can't just release this, I gotta do something cool.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
See, that's the part where we get stuck.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
It is, yeah, because I went back...

16:15.000 --> 16:26.000
I wasn't afraid to put out a shitty game, because honestly if I could have finished the game that simple, and still is important, I want to finish, so that still is important to me, just to say I did it. I did this.

16:26.000 --> 16:36.000
I made this in, because believe me, my first idea was to just do, oh I'll just do something in ZZT, that's my comfort zone, or I'll make something silly in Commodore 64 basic, that's my comfort zone.

16:36.000 --> 16:42.000
But then, Unity seemed more and more like something I could actually do, so there's that.

16:42.000 --> 16:51.000
Anyway, I don't want to spend the whole show talking about coulda, woulda, shoulda, let's focus on the positive, is the fact that so many of these people participated.

16:51.000 --> 17:03.000
I'm going to play all these games in the coming week, and I'm excited to. There's a really diverse, from what I'm seeing in the screenshots and the titles and emails, a lot of people interpreted that buggy game in various ways.

17:03.000 --> 17:13.000
It seems like most people actually did games about bugs, but certainly it wasn't limited to that. We had, like, Bobby did a moon buggy type of game.

17:13.000 --> 17:24.000
I saw something about a Tetris submission. Again, I haven't played it yet, but there's some type of Tetris submission that's supposed to be buggy, so I'm looking at that, so lots of neat stuff that I can't wait to play.

17:25.000 --> 17:33.000
Alright, let's see, I would like to get into a couple other stories here. More to come on the Jam in the coming weeks.

17:33.000 --> 17:42.000
We will not be here live next week, as I've mentioned a few times on the show, and there will actually be no show at all this next week because it's kind of our late holiday break.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
We were here through the holidays, but we're going to take a break next week because I'm going to Seattle.

17:46.000 --> 17:53.000
But in two weeks, we'll be back on the show, and I will give you all my impressions on all the games I played at that point.

17:53.000 --> 18:01.000
So we'll revisit this Jam, at least here on OLR, in a couple weeks. I imagine Bobby will get around to playing everything. He's already played some of them, it sounds like.

18:01.000 --> 18:08.000
He'll probably talk about his impressions on Bobby Blackwell's show next week when we're not here, so you have all that to look forward to.

18:08.000 --> 18:18.000
They're not done talking about the VoG Jam just yet, and I know there's going to be more late entries too. It's not just me and Loki. I think YYR still wants to get involved there and so forth.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Yeah, go late Jam!

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
The late Jam!

18:22.000 --> 18:31.000
Alright, let's talk about this. This is another kickoff topic I wanted to get into tonight before we get into our gaming weeks and so forth.

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
And this is that type of story that's been making the rounds on Facebook and Twitter and all that.

18:36.000 --> 18:49.000
Because I've seen a similar story like this about a dude who goes into a Burger King and there's some screaming kid in there that's screaming about wanting to have a pie.

18:49.000 --> 18:56.000
So what does he do? He buys all the pies so the little screaming, disobedient child can't have any. I know I've seen that story on Facebook before, right?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
You guys all know that story I'm talking about? I know I've seen it.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Oh yes.

18:59.000 --> 19:09.000
Yes, right? So this is something similar that happened that has to do with gaming. And there is a Nintendo fan out there that I don't believe has a name. I think his name is Harry. That's it.

19:09.000 --> 19:22.000
Although, that's it. This bitter fan bought 100 Rosalina and Luma amiibo figures just so you couldn't.

19:22.000 --> 19:32.000
So he bought all these Rosalina and Luma amiibos in bulk so that way they would be off shelves and that you couldn't have them.

19:32.000 --> 19:43.000
The reason why? Quote, I do not appreciate Rosalina appearing in almost every recent Mario game to date. The fact Nintendo promotes her so much and people praise her is just disgusting.

19:43.000 --> 19:52.000
I hate her fans too. I know for a fact her amiibo will be among one of the most popular which is why I took the time to wait and pre-order over 100 of her.

19:52.000 --> 20:00.000
I do not want her fans to be happy. It just crushes me Nintendo from the good days went to this shit for character designs.

20:00.000 --> 20:14.000
By the way, this person who has spent $4,000 so far is going to be buying more figures such as Lucina, Palutena, Robin, and Zero Suit Samus are also on the list.

20:14.000 --> 20:20.000
Why do I just have a feeling that this guy has some sort of Nintendo sex dungeon that he's lined these all up on the walls for?

20:20.000 --> 20:25.000
I mean, because I seriously, yes, I hate them so much. I put them up on my walls.

20:25.000 --> 20:38.000
And I just happen to notice, just a casual observation, I don't know if y'all notice this too, I just happen to notice that all those characters this guy apparently has a hate boner for happen to be women.

20:38.000 --> 20:49.000
Is that just a coincidence, right? It can't be that this guy hates women in video games. Surely that can't be it, right?

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
It pretty much stinks of misogyny.

20:51.000 --> 21:03.000
Hmm. Hmm. Well, now here's another side of this, though, is that is this even real? I mean, because I'm of the mindset where I'm like, okay, it's cute and all that this is on Reddit and making the rounds, but I want to see the receipts.

21:03.000 --> 21:12.000
I want to see I want to see your box full of 100 Rosalina and Luma dolls that's not sitting in the GameStop box, waiting to go on the shelf. I want to see

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Where did he order them from?

21:14.000 --> 21:22.000
Apparently Amazon or something like that, but I want to see in your hate dungeon. I want to see your 100 Rosalina. I want to see the receipts because I kind of don't buy this story.

21:22.000 --> 21:28.000
Or I see you burning them because, you know, I get to see this guy, you know, buying a bunch of this stuff and flipping it.

21:28.000 --> 21:46.000
Well, and the other thing is, what an idiot. I mean, not just for the reasons we've already talked about, but what a way to send a message to Nintendo that people just hate Rosalina by making sure she sells out.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
What a way to send that message to Nintendo, you dumbass.

21:49.000 --> 22:06.000
I'm sure those 100 features that you took off the shelves will be so hard to like manufacture in like a day or two. I mean, it's just, it's stupid. It's not affecting anybody. If you bought all of them, then that would be affecting something, but you bought 100. That's nothing.

22:06.000 --> 22:12.000
Yeah, there's still a whole bunch of Rosalina amiibos on Amazon right now.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
That's like a few cases.

22:13.000 --> 22:26.000
And YYR says, you know, and is absolutely right, 100 units is barely a blip on the radar. So I think this thing really just kind of spread around because there's a lot of us kind of looking at this going, what a dummy, if it's even real. And again, I'm just questioning.

22:26.000 --> 22:35.000
He's just creating an all female amiibo fight club is what he's doing. It's just getting, he's training them all. He's going to have them fight against each other.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Like actually train them in Super Smash Brothers?

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Yes, they're all going to fight each other.

22:39.000 --> 22:54.000
Which by the way, isn't now I don't profess to be a Smash Brothers expert, but my understanding is Rosalina is like top tier, right? Isn't Rosalina like a top tier Smash Brothers character right now? Like she's kind of really good in the game. I don't know. Anyway, let's see.

22:55.000 --> 23:06.000
That's why I don't want to talk about this guy. He probably wants attention and he's getting it. Well, here's the nice thing. I haven't said his name. That name I did say was an alias that some of these websites have come up with.

23:06.000 --> 23:11.000
So I don't know what this guy's name is, nor do I care to know and spread it around on the show.

23:11.000 --> 23:27.000
And I think what he'll probably will do, look out for this, is that if he really did order a hundred of these, if he did, watch for the eBay posting by the Rosalina doll that the dude with the hate boner hat.

23:27.000 --> 23:36.000
He'll try to, that's, isn't that the capitalist way to do it? He'll try to spin it and sell those things for a profit because that market is still out there.

23:36.000 --> 23:49.000
Yeah, it's just like the people that, you know, back, you know, my son is grounded, so I'm selling his guitar hero controller and it sells for like $500 and it's like, so it's worth $10 selling for like $500.

23:49.000 --> 24:08.000
Yeah. So anyway, I think we can all agree that this guy is a bit of a moron and, you know, unless, now if the goal out of this was to create a story, a fake story that would go viral, then congrats you won because here is the entire internet sharing it on Facebook and talking about it.

24:08.000 --> 24:26.000
So if that was the goal, then good job. But, uh, I have a feeling there's probably like half a hint of truth to it. I think somebody out there really does have the hate boner for, um, all these female characters, which you probably need to have examined for a completely different reason related to buying all the amiibo.

24:26.000 --> 24:33.000
But I, I don't, I don't believe that all the amiibo have been purchased. Just because they've been pre-ordered as well doesn't mean they've been purchased.

24:33.000 --> 24:45.000
So just throwing it out there. But if you show me all the dolls lined up in your hate basement, then I guess we can have a conversation. Come on the show and let's, let's talk about it. Let's talk about your many issues if you'd like.

24:45.000 --> 24:56.000
All right. Anyhow, uh, let's get into our gaming weeks, the types of video games we have been playing this week. Uh, let's go around the room and check in. Dark Soccer, what have you been playing this week?

24:56.000 --> 25:12.000
Uh, Little Borderlands. Um, I've been playing, uh, Fractal. Um, I actually got back in Final Fantasy XIV and a little bit of Dragon Age. Um, I actually forced myself to play it when I had a raging headache, just because I hadn't played any in a few days.

25:12.000 --> 25:23.000
I'm still putting off the, the heartbreaking step on my heart, rip it out, throw it across a cow field full of shit part of the game. Because-

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
No spoilers.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Because of my romance option.

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
Although I can kind of piece it together what's happening here. It's kind of, kind of obvious, but anyway.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Well, are you going to romance them?

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Probably not.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Okay then.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
Some of the listeners might be though.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
Well, if, trust me, it's, it's-

25:39.000 --> 25:51.000
I would think anyone that has that much care over it's probably already played through the game. That's my thought. But anyway, so there you go. Uh, Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?

25:51.000 --> 26:00.000
Um, really all I played is, uh, just a little bit of, um, League of Marvel Superheroes. Just because my son wants me to play with him.

26:00.000 --> 26:07.000
Although, the last few days while he's been playing I've been sleeping on the couch trying to catch up on some of my sleep.

26:07.000 --> 26:15.000
But, uh, I did get a little bit of it in and I managed to get him to play a level so I could finally 100% that level.

26:15.000 --> 26:24.000
But, how's he going to play it when he goes to bed so I can, you know, because I'm at 75% complete with the game so I'll just platinum it. It's super easy.

26:24.000 --> 26:29.000
And then we'll be done with that. Well, as far as I'm concerned, I'll be done with it.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
And then I was just working on my game job, so.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
Yeah. Alright.

26:33.000 --> 26:41.000
Uh, my gaming week was a little slow this week. Um, obviously, if I didn't have time to work on the project I didn't really have a lot of time to play games either.

26:41.000 --> 26:47.000
So that really ended up being the case. I haven't played any role. There's one new game that I played this week and it's not really even a new game.

26:47.000 --> 26:52.000
Uh, so what I will mention is that, uh, and some of you have probably seen this by now.

26:52.000 --> 26:57.000
But, uh, Wednesday night after Horde House I finally gave in to all the people that are like,

26:57.000 --> 27:01.000
Rob, when are you going to fucking play Five Nights at Freddy's and do the livestream?

27:01.000 --> 27:07.000
So Shane came over and it took us like 30 minutes just to set up my other studio.

27:07.000 --> 27:14.000
I have this studio here, N7, then I have the satellite studio that I actually do all my computer gaming in and livestreaming.

27:14.000 --> 27:21.000
And I set that all up for the external sound which was harder to do than you'd think because I had to get it to be a decent volume.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
So finally after 30 minutes of setting that up we were able to play a little bit of Five Nights at Freddy's.

27:25.000 --> 27:33.000
So I finally played that game for the first time and it's all chronicled on YouTube, uh, over on my YouTube channel Rob Roberts Plays.

27:33.000 --> 27:38.000
And did the game scare me? Yep. Yep. I got tricked into a couple jump scares.

27:38.000 --> 27:44.000
Uh, that frickin' Chica or whatever her name is got me twice during the livestream.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
And, uh, what a silly game.

27:46.000 --> 27:53.000
But, you know, I gotta say, uh, an extraordinarily, I mean, this goes back to, you know, to bring it full circle with the game jam.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
What an extraordinarily simple concept, really.

27:56.000 --> 28:04.000
Um, you know, watching these security cameras and making sure that the monsters don't really get closer to your room.

28:04.000 --> 28:11.000
Where you're, uh, where you're, um, you know, uh, gonna get eaten if they get to you and you don't shut the door or whatever in time.

28:11.000 --> 28:20.000
The one thing I never really truly understood, the one thing I never really truly understood about the game was, what's the point of the cameras?

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
Because you just want to make sure they don't get in the doors.

28:24.000 --> 28:29.000
So couldn't you just sit there the entire time and just check the lights, check the lights, check the lights.

28:29.000 --> 28:34.000
And then finally, if you see somebody in the room, like, about to come in the room, just shut the door.

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
Like, I never really understood what the advantage is to cycling through the different cameras.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
You don't really seem to slow them down or anything by doing that.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
I don't think they can move when the camera's on them.

28:43.000 --> 28:48.000
Yeah, but considering there's more than one, there's always at least one person that should be moving.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
So why not always check the doors?

28:50.000 --> 29:01.000
Now, I think there's something to do specifically with the Fox character, where starting on night three, he will run into your room and you may not have time to see him if you don't check the camera.

29:01.000 --> 29:10.000
But one guy, and this is always interesting, depending on what game I stream, I sometimes get people that have no idea, you know, of the podcast I do or who I am.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Just people that like to watch streams of people playing the game.

29:12.000 --> 29:17.000
And one guy came into the room and was like, yeah, all I ever do is I check Pirate's Cove, which is where Foxy hides out.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
I go Cove, light, light, and just repeat.

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
That was my strategy and that's how I get all the way to like the end of night five.

29:24.000 --> 29:30.000
And I'm like, well, that kind of makes the game a little silly at that point, doesn't it?

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Like, it kind of takes all the point out of it.

29:32.000 --> 29:39.000
So I just feel like, and I'm sure the chat room is yelling at me here, so I'm going to go to them in a minute here over at live.vognetware.com.

29:39.000 --> 29:46.000
It just seems to me that, like, there's something wrong with the balance of the game if it's that easy.

29:46.000 --> 29:53.000
But I don't know. But there is, I will say this, then Shane was trying to explain to me, oh, there's all this lore behind the game.

29:53.000 --> 30:01.000
You got to go watch these game theory YouTubes about how it's all a parallel to this guy that killed all these people at a Chuck E. Cheese.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
And then it leads into the second game and you find out all this stuff.

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
And I'm just like, wow, there is, like, people really read a lot into this game.

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
But it does seem like the designer has left little hints in the game.

30:12.000 --> 30:19.000
Like, that game theory thing I watch does make an awful lot of sense, even if they backtrack on a lot of it when they talk about the second game.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
But anyway, I didn't think it was very interesting.

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
Going to the chat room over at live.vognetware.com, VidPower says,

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
Foxy will run at you full speed if you don't check on the cameras on him.

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
Actf says, and Foxy is a must to watch for the camera.

30:34.000 --> 30:39.000
Actf says, that's my strategy, although I do check the door cams just in case.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
And the lore is actually quite fascinating.

30:42.000 --> 30:50.000
Kaijuto says, if you use too much power, you are fucked, so you need to check the cams to make sure you use power when they're close.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
Okay, but didn't the cams use power too?

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
I thought, or can you just unlimited use the camera? The cameras don't really use any power.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
If that's the case, then that makes a little more sense.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
And I thought, I thought that might have been it.

31:02.000 --> 31:07.000
And Alan Alchemy in chat says, these are probably things they fixed in part two and three.

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
My understanding is that the mechanic is totally different in part two, that there is no door.

31:11.000 --> 31:16.000
That there's just the front that they can, like, jump, but you put a mask on instead.

31:16.000 --> 31:21.000
Like, they totally changed it in two, and I'm sure they'll change some of the basic stuff in three as well.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Well, because two's supposed to be a prequel, so.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
Yeah, well, but again, that's never really explicitly stated.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
Yeah, it is.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
That's just the whole game theory stuff.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
No, it's the date on the check. Remember, the unit said that in game theory.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
Oh, alright, alright, alright.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Your paycheck's a different date.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
So that's only if you beat it that you really find that out, that it's prequel.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
Yeah.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
There's that.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
Alright.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
And then Act F says, no, cams do drain the energy.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
That was the, the cams don't drain the energy?

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
I thought, alright, anyway.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
Why don't we just shut down some of the cameras and, like, put the energy.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
How about we just shut down all the cameras, put all the energy into the doors, and done.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
So, you know what, I will say this much.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
As much as it sounds like I'm talking negative about the game, I'm really not.

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
I'm just biased because I don't really like the jump scare stuff because I'm such a baby.

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
But I will say this, you know, massive kudos to the developer because, as I understand,

32:08.000 --> 32:15.000
it's just one guy with a pretty crazy simple concept that I'm sure is making buku bucks.

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
This, this thing, well, maybe not a ton of ton of it, but it's always, like, number one

32:19.000 --> 32:24.000
on the iOS store for iPad and all that stuff.

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
I know he's doing well there and I see a ton of let's plays on this on Steam and stuff.

32:27.000 --> 32:33.000
He's got to be doing well with this game with what is a pretty simple idea fleshed out.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
So, good for him. Good for him.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
And people...

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
It'll be 100% better whatever Miyamoto's coming up with with his Project Watch.

32:39.000 --> 32:43.000
I'm telling you, it's like one dude making this game.

32:43.000 --> 32:48.000
I can tell it's going to be way better than watching Rob the Robot storm something.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
I don't know.

32:50.000 --> 32:54.000
Rob the Robot could be really creepy in a Five Nights at Freddy's game.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
You never know. You never know.

32:56.000 --> 33:00.000
Alright, so you think that's what Miyamoto's working on as a Five Nights at Freddy's ripoff?

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
Because I'm sure those are all incoming.

33:03.000 --> 33:09.000
Just like the Minecraft ripoffs, now that Five Nights at Freddy's is number one on the iOS store,

33:09.000 --> 33:15.000
I'm sure it's just a matter of time if it's not already happening before all the poorly made knockoffs start flowing in.

33:15.000 --> 33:19.000
You know, three nights at Thelma's.

33:19.000 --> 33:24.000
I'm sure all these freaking knockoffs are just about to happen.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Three Thursdays at Thelma's.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Alright.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Five Tuesdays with Maureen.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
That's kind of dark.

33:32.000 --> 33:37.000
Alright, let's get into, now that we're done with our gaming week, some quick housekeeping.

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
Follow us on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
We're also on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

33:43.000 --> 33:48.000
And as a reminder, there is no show at all next week, January 18th.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
We are taking the week off. A late holiday break.

33:51.000 --> 33:58.000
But a happy Martin Luther King observance day to those of you in the States, because we'll be missing that.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
And maybe see some of you in Seattle.

34:01.000 --> 34:07.000
I don't know how many listeners we have up there, but if any are up there, I will be in your neighborhood.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
Yes, even when it's not PAX.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
But I love Seattle.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
I've been there a few times. You know, we all went to Seattle.

34:15.000 --> 34:19.000
That was the one road trip we all took together, although it was really a fly trip.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
There was a limo involved.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
That's right, there was a limo involved.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
That was our diva trip to PAX.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
That was a really fun time, though.

34:27.000 --> 34:35.000
That wasn't just us. That was when we were with the All Games Network and there was really kind of a convergence of all those indie podcasters there at PAX.

34:35.000 --> 34:39.000
You know, Bobby was involved, too, and a lot of other people with the network. That was a lot of fun.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
So we had some great Seattle memories of that.

34:41.000 --> 34:47.000
And then I went five years ago, funny enough, with Grandpa from Hoard House.

34:47.000 --> 34:53.000
And this was long before his persona on that show was established and any of that before he was a podcaster and all that.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
We went to Seattle together and had a great old time.

34:56.000 --> 35:01.000
So I'm looking forward to going back and going to all the tourist traps and all the fun stuff.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
But I'm going to tell you what, that football game better not get in the damn way.

35:04.000 --> 35:09.000
Because that's something I realized last night is, oh shit, the Seahawks are in the playoffs now.

35:09.000 --> 35:14.000
Which I'm happy for. I've been everything, but it's going to make the town crazy on Saturday.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
No thank you. No thank you.

35:16.000 --> 35:23.000
Alright, so no show. We will be back with a show two weeks from tonight on January 25th.

35:23.000 --> 35:33.000
Hopefully for those of you that have a little podcast void next week, I hope you will fill the time with some other hardworking indie podcasters out there.

35:33.000 --> 35:37.000
Of which there are lots and lots and lots of hardworking folks out there that will have shows for you next week.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
So check them out.

35:38.000 --> 35:43.000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news and what has been going on in the industry this week.

35:43.000 --> 35:50.000
Not as busy of a week as we were expecting coming off of the holiday, but still a few big stories here and there nonetheless.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Starting with Loki.

35:51.000 --> 35:59.000
Yes, so PlayStation Now is starting up a subscription program, which is kind of cool.

35:59.000 --> 36:03.000
I mean, since the pricing of it was really ridiculous in the first place.

36:03.000 --> 36:11.000
Although it is a little bit on the pricey side, so don't give up your membership to Gamefly anytime soon.

36:11.000 --> 36:17.000
But apparently you can choose from some different subscription plans, including one month for $19.99.

36:17.000 --> 36:22.000
Or three months for $14.99, which ends up being about $15 a month.

36:22.000 --> 36:28.000
And with that you get basically unlimited streaming for all the games that are on the service.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
So I think they have about 100 right now.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
So it's all of them, not just select games. That's pretty rad.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
Yeah, it's all of them. All you can play.

36:37.000 --> 36:44.000
It's cool, I guess, if you really can dedicate a lot of time to get your money's worth out of it.

36:44.000 --> 36:51.000
But I think it sounds like a great deal, but how much are you really going to be playing each month?

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
For $15 a month, that's pretty expensive.

36:54.000 --> 37:00.000
I don't know, just imagine spending that on Steam games. You'd probably get a lot further with your money.

37:00.000 --> 37:12.000
I'm of a couple mindsets about this. I actually think this is the feature a lot of people have been asking for.

37:12.000 --> 37:19.000
I think some people are struggling with the price, so you really have to ask, is it a fair price?

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
I have a hard time hating on the price, honestly.

37:22.000 --> 37:29.000
Games are always going to be a little more expensive than movies, so that's why it's about twice the cost of Netflix.

37:29.000 --> 37:34.000
Twice the cost of Netflix, isn't it? Not even that, though. I'm kind of okay with that.

37:34.000 --> 37:43.000
Because, yes, there's a place for Gamefly too. Gamefly can do more things, and comparable services.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Here's my thing.

37:45.000 --> 37:51.000
The immediacy of what this is going to be able to provide is that you will not have to wait.

37:51.000 --> 37:57.000
If you want to play any game in this virtual library right now, you're going to be able to do that.

37:57.000 --> 38:02.000
That's hard to hate. I do think there's a lot of value with that.

38:02.000 --> 38:10.000
The fact that, yeah, you're paying for this, but that's going to be 150 games right now, whenever you want.

38:10.000 --> 38:19.000
The only thing that's a little bit of a negative is it's 150 games, of which maybe 10 are good and 140 are filler.

38:19.000 --> 38:23.000
That's a little more of the concerning part.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
One positive I see is that, one, you can play that on your PlayStation 4.

38:27.000 --> 38:32.000
A lot of these, you can't play PlayStation 3 games on your PlayStation 4, so it gives you that.

38:32.000 --> 38:38.000
But just looking at the titles that they have on there, a lot of these I already have in my PlayStation Plus library.

38:38.000 --> 38:42.000
So if you have a PlayStation 3, it's kind of like, why do you need this?

38:42.000 --> 38:51.000
Because PlayStation Plus, if you've had it for a while and have gotten these games, like I know Infamous I got from the whole PlayStation Network deal.

38:51.000 --> 38:55.000
Red Faction Collection, I've had, god, those games have been so cheap.

38:55.000 --> 39:02.000
Darksiders I've gotten before. Saints Row 2, Bioshock Infinite.

39:02.000 --> 39:08.000
I mean, there's a ton of these games I already have, so it wouldn't make any sense for me to do this service.

39:08.000 --> 39:16.000
And I think if you boil it down to what you want to actually play, you can probably go buy these games cheaper.

39:16.000 --> 39:23.000
You won't get hundreds of games, but you can probably go out there and buy these games you use for a lot cheaper than paying $15 a month.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
You get a game a month or something, or a couple of games a month.

39:26.000 --> 39:38.000
Now, Bobby's being very adamant in chat and is showing the receipts here by linking to this list here from the PlayStation forums about how it is not everything that's on the service now.

39:38.000 --> 39:45.000
There is a distinctive list between what you can rent and what is actually included when you subscribe to all games.

39:45.000 --> 39:55.000
Such as, for example, I notice, I'm just looking at the list real quick, Final Fantasy XIII is on both lists, but XIII-2 is not included in the subscription list.

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
So, there's that. I mean, there are some games that are missing.

39:59.000 --> 40:11.000
So now, now that further refines the question, I think, to, you know, is the $15 a month or whatever worth it for these specific games?

40:11.000 --> 40:18.000
And you really have to kind of look at that list of what's available and say, do I want to be able to play these all for a month for $15?

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
And here's the other thing that's about that, too, is if you notice, like, I'm...

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
Whatever it is. Sorry, maybe not $15. What was the amount again? $18?

40:25.000 --> 40:30.000
It was $19.99 a month for $24.99 for three months.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
Okay, then is this worth $20 for a month?

40:33.000 --> 40:37.000
I just think it's not, just because of the amount of...

40:37.000 --> 40:42.000
First off, the amount of stuff that they've already given away for free on PlayStation Plus.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
So, if you're like me and you just grab everything regardless of...

40:45.000 --> 40:50.000
Because I had a Vita at one time, I still grab stuff for the Vita, because someday I may get a Vita again.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
I just want to have that stuff in my library.

40:52.000 --> 41:02.000
So, I've got a ton of these between this and my Xbox, you know, games with gold stuff and with my Steam library, which has got most of these games already.

41:02.000 --> 41:08.000
There's not much for me to play on this, and on top of that, I just...

41:08.000 --> 41:13.000
I don't know, I just don't see it being worthwhile to pay that kind of fee.

41:13.000 --> 41:21.000
I'll notice, or I did notice that there are no EA games on that list, because those are part of that, you know, EA package thing that you pay $30 a year.

41:21.000 --> 41:27.000
And, hey, $30 a year doesn't sound so bad now when you compare it to $19.99 a month.

41:27.000 --> 41:31.000
Well, but again, it's what games, because I'm sure the EA list is much more...

41:31.000 --> 41:35.000
And if you're not a sports game fan, that's even less.

41:35.000 --> 41:40.000
Yeah, true. I would just look at what games you want to play and what games they're offering.

41:40.000 --> 41:47.000
And honestly, you might be better off just saying, okay, hey, if there's only like a handful of games you want to play, go buy them.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
I mean, because you might end up, or rent them.

41:49.000 --> 41:58.000
Here's the thing, though, is that, you know, as well, and I'm trying to kind of remain a little bit hopeful about this, is that, okay, maybe that's the way this looks now.

41:58.000 --> 42:07.000
But surely Sony plans to add to this, you know, and we know that PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 1, these are things that Sony wants to be able to offer on PlayStation Now.

42:07.000 --> 42:11.000
It's things they've talked about being available on PlayStation Now that we haven't seen yet.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
I want to see...

42:12.000 --> 42:17.000
So I imagine in the next year, this will be further enhanced with PS1 and PS2 games, which would be great.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
Well, that's cool.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
Especially if there's trophy support.

42:19.000 --> 42:27.000
That's cool and all, but what I would like to see is just my fucking games that I have in my library being able to be streamed over PlayStation Now.

42:27.000 --> 42:32.000
Because I see Saints Row 4 on there, I see Saints Row 2, I see, you know, Darksiders.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
And these are games you bought digitally.

42:33.000 --> 42:38.000
These are games that I have, well, I didn't buy them, but they're games that they gave to me, you know, digitally, so...

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
Oh, oh, alright.

42:39.000 --> 42:44.000
You know, Saints Row III are just all these different games on here.

42:44.000 --> 42:50.000
I would love to be able to play those on my PlayStation 4 instead of having to, you know, break out the PlayStation 3 to play these games.

42:51.000 --> 42:57.000
Since you obviously can stream that, and it's obviously tied to the PlayStation Network, so don't tell me you can't tell that,

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
oh, I'm sorry, our systems don't talk to each other, you know, we can't figure out what you purchased.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
I would like to see some of that, that would be great.

43:03.000 --> 43:11.000
But I would, I do also think that, you know, if you look at something like Netflix, where all the license and rights semantics aside,

43:11.000 --> 43:16.000
because I know Netflix used to have more on it that they don't have because, you know, it's like an EA thing, right?

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Where they wanted to go off and make their own thing.

43:18.000 --> 43:24.000
But, you know, Netflix has now been enhanced with things like Orange is the New Black and, you know, kind of their own programming.

43:24.000 --> 43:28.000
So I'm curious to see what Sony's going to enhance this with in the future.

43:28.000 --> 43:35.000
Maybe right now this doesn't look like the most attractive deal, although again, I suppose it depends on what sort of PS3 games you're into.

43:35.000 --> 43:47.000
I don't know, I have to admit, for 20 bucks, being able to play it on demand, eh, there is a lot in this list I think I could probably get 20 bucks worth out of at least for one month.

43:48.000 --> 44:00.000
Would I do a continuing thing? Not right now, but I'd be very curious to see what Sony might do month to month to make people that jump on early on want to stay subscribed.

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
And that could even be things like exclusives.

44:03.000 --> 44:12.000
I wouldn't shut the door on the fact that Sony might offer something exclusive to folks on PlayStation Now that maybe you can't get anywhere else.

44:12.000 --> 44:21.000
That could be the PlayStation 1 and 2 games, because right now they're not selling 1 and 2 games on the PlayStation 4 save VIB, no, not even Vibram is on 4 yet.

44:21.000 --> 44:26.000
You had to buy that on 3. So, it'd be interesting.

44:26.000 --> 44:39.000
I don't know, I'm not jumping into this yet, because like I said, I've got my Steam library, and I've got libraries that are starting to get to the size of Steam on the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Marketplace.

44:39.000 --> 44:43.000
So, I just don't need extra games.

44:43.000 --> 44:50.000
yyrinchat says, I think it's most worth it to people that never owned a PS3 or an Xbox 360.

44:50.000 --> 44:54.000
It's worth noting that many of the subscription games are not PlayStation 3 exclusives.

44:54.000 --> 45:03.000
He brings up a good point. There are a lot of people that kind of skipped the last generation or owned a Nintendo Wii in their household who might be PS4 owners now.

45:03.000 --> 45:07.000
So, that's an interesting point. Could be a catch-up type of thing.

45:07.000 --> 45:18.000
Brad from Pod Culture says, make it $15 a month, include Plus as a part of it, and I would be sold. More like an Amazon Prime model.

45:18.000 --> 45:29.000
I don't think Sony would put it that low. I suppose anything's possible, but I like that idea of one package for both, and surely Sony's got to be thinking it too.

45:29.000 --> 45:38.000
Like, what about a PlayStation Plus Plus? What would you call that? PlayStation Plus Gold, or PlayStation Plus Platinum, something like that.

45:38.000 --> 45:44.000
Where maybe you have a Plus account that's further enhanced with this, that's a package deal. I'm sure that's something they've got to be thinking.

45:44.000 --> 45:51.000
I just don't think it's ever going to get that low. I mean, it'd be great if it could. I'm just being realistic.

45:51.000 --> 45:57.000
You know, no one would get me to maybe get in on that. They do their own version of, like, Game Room.

45:58.000 --> 46:05.000
Oh, don't get me started. Don't get me started. Bad memories. Bad memories. I'm so upset. Alright, anyhow.

46:05.000 --> 46:09.000
So, there you go. What if Nintendo did that, with all their virtual console games?

46:09.000 --> 46:16.000
Oh my god, they should. Oh my god, they're sitting on a gold mine. They could totally do that, but then again, Nintendo's making pretty good money just selling piecemeal right now.

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
Well, yeah, they're selling ROMs for $5 a piece.

46:19.000 --> 46:25.000
People aren't demanding it from Nintendo the same way they have been of Sony.

46:26.000 --> 46:33.000
They do a little bit. I'm not saying people don't demand that from Nintendo, but Nintendo also doesn't have the streaming thing. That's the big difference.

46:33.000 --> 46:37.000
PlayStation's now doing the streaming thing and is selling these individual stream games.

46:37.000 --> 46:47.000
And so people, you know, because we all know Netflix and Amazon Prime and Hulu and all that stuff, people think, well, I'm used to paying one fee to access all that.

46:47.000 --> 46:52.000
Why is PlayStation using a different model? So I think that's how Nintendo's been able to avoid it a little bit.

46:52.000 --> 46:56.000
Even if Nintendo can stream a virtual console game, there's like a few megs.

46:56.000 --> 47:02.000
Like on any internet, even crappy DSLers, it's like, okay, let's buffer that. Oh, done. Games downloaded.

47:02.000 --> 47:10.000
I'm actually not disagreeing with you, but I also feel like there's more that Nintendo could do to virtual console that they're not doing, such as internet play.

47:11.000 --> 47:22.000
I still do that because those are such low, you know, little itty bitty ROMs. I still, I don't know why this is not a thing.

47:22.000 --> 47:31.000
And I've said this on the show before. Why don't you have games that are two player games that you can play against each other?

47:31.000 --> 47:38.000
Like, I don't know, what are some big NES classics that were like head to head? Like the original Mario Brothers even, right? It was kind of a head to head game, right?

47:38.000 --> 47:47.000
Why can't you have that where you're playing it on the TV and on the gamepad, you can see video of the person you're playing against?

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
How hard? Privacy.

47:51.000 --> 48:00.000
Okay, but make it friends. You only get, make it, if you're playing with strangers, it's an avatar. And if you're playing with friends, it's video. Done.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
No.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
Why not?

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
I wouldn't want to be on video.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
Who cares? It's fine.

48:06.000 --> 48:10.000
Then shut it off. Make it optional. You don't have to stream video, but you can.

48:10.000 --> 48:16.000
It's probably because they don't have a way to like, they don't have a very good system as far as being able to play with friends on things.

48:16.000 --> 48:27.000
I mean, Mario Kart, I mean, they have it, it seemed like for me, at least on the Wii, because I don't have a Wii U, that it was very much like each game kind of handled that differently as far as being able to play with your friends.

48:27.000 --> 48:32.000
So, maybe they just don't have a good system, or they don't have a system in place for that.

48:32.000 --> 48:37.000
I mean, I don't think you can start up like a party like you can on PlayStation or Xbox.

48:37.000 --> 48:42.000
Start up a party with people and they're okay, we're gonna launch, you know, this game.

48:42.000 --> 48:50.000
We're gonna launch, you know, Mario Kart or something and it boots into that with everybody joining the game and, you know, all playing together.

48:50.000 --> 49:00.000
YYR in chat says, don't worry, Nintendo will catch up to Xbox 360 PS3 as far as network features by the time the next generation of consoles is released.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
I look forward to it.

49:02.000 --> 49:07.000
YYR also says, hey kid, send me a friend code if you want to see my dick. I guess there's that.

49:07.000 --> 49:13.000
But, I mean, at some point you have to put the onus for that not on the company, but on the predator.

49:13.000 --> 49:17.000
And I understand that Nintendo had some issues with that and that's why they shut off PictoChat.

49:17.000 --> 49:23.000
But at the same time, how hard is it, you know, hey kid, let me get your cell phone number and I'll text you pictures of my dick.

49:23.000 --> 49:28.000
Or, hey kid, how about your Skype name? And, you know, we can look at dicks.

49:28.000 --> 49:32.000
Yeah, in PictoChat, they have to draw pictures of their dick, so it was a little bit more difficult.

49:32.000 --> 49:37.000
Well, you could actually send pictures in PictoChat, remember? Because I always used to send pictures of the cat.

49:37.000 --> 49:41.000
No, that wasn't PictoChat. That was the other one, Swap Note.

49:41.000 --> 49:46.000
Oh, sorry. Swap Note was the thing they disabled. That was the thing I missed.

49:46.000 --> 49:50.000
Swap Note was awesome, and I sent 3D pictures of the cat all the time to my friend list.

49:50.000 --> 49:57.000
But see, that's the thing though, it's like PictoChat. That was a brilliant, brilliant idea for, like, the DS.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Everybody at Expos, I went to her.

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
It's like this moment of brilliance, and then it's like they don't ever do anything with it.

50:02.000 --> 50:07.000
It's just like, hey, this is a really great idea. Cool, keep having those.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
I know, I know.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
It's like, well, just don't stop now.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
I know.

50:12.000 --> 50:20.000
My point is, is that Nintendo, I understand Nintendo's really, really, really overcautious about, you know, their image in the media,

50:20.000 --> 50:27.000
and they don't want the media reporting on these things about, like, you know, all these dicks we're seeing on a child's 3DS in the Swap Note application,

50:27.000 --> 50:32.000
but it's like, well, check the kid's phone. It's probably there too. Check the kid's email.

50:32.000 --> 50:41.000
I mean, unfortunately, we need to focus on getting this act of predators doing this to children to stop.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
You know what I mean?

50:42.000 --> 50:48.000
They're going to find a way to do it no matter what, you know, it's going to be cell phones or Nintendo.

50:48.000 --> 50:53.000
That's not the core issue.

50:53.000 --> 50:57.000
Maybe if people would stop supporting sensationalized news reporting.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
There is that too. There is that too. Anyhow.

51:02.000 --> 51:08.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase IDEA.

51:08.000 --> 51:14.000
Alright, let's move on. We've got to talk about some other things, and this is actually some pretty big news from Nintendo this week.

51:14.000 --> 51:24.000
By the way, speaking of things Nintendo swore up and down they would never do, and now we're seeing them dip their toe in the water with this, kinda.

51:24.000 --> 51:31.000
This was some very surprising, very big news that came out this week, and you might have missed it because it has to do with cell phone gaming.

51:31.000 --> 51:37.000
You might have just glossed it over and not paid it any attention, but I'm telling you, this is huge.

51:37.000 --> 51:42.000
There's a game series out there you may or may not have played. It's available on iPhones and Androids and all that.

51:42.000 --> 51:47.000
It's called Puzzle and Dragons. I think this game's awful. I've tried playing it. I think it's stupid.

51:47.000 --> 51:54.000
I think there's far better games out there on the mobile phones. I would rather play Trivia Crack, honestly, which is also kind of stupid.

51:55.000 --> 52:01.000
That is a game I've also been playing this week, by the way. A lot of Trivia Crack. But it's a good micro game.

52:01.000 --> 52:08.000
It's a good game you can play for five seconds, then move on, right? I'm not a big fan of Puzzle and Dragons, but I can't deny this game is huge.

52:08.000 --> 52:15.000
It's kind of like Bejeweled meets Pokemon. I'm really oversimplifying it, but that's kind of what it is.

52:16.000 --> 52:30.000
This game series is really big in Japan. Apparently, in some of the Asian regions, it's even bigger than it is here. It's a huge deal.

52:30.000 --> 52:43.000
And GungHo is the company that actually creates this game. Well, GungHo has actually announced that there is going to be a Super Mario edition of Puzzle and Dragons.

52:44.000 --> 52:59.000
It's going to be on the 3DS in Japan this April. But I still think there's something very interesting here, where you've got Nintendo partnering up with a company that is most well-known for cell phone gaming.

52:59.000 --> 53:03.000
Granted, it's being made for the 3DS, but like I said, it's the big toe.

53:03.000 --> 53:19.000
But they did something similar, though. It wasn't that. It was the Square Enix, almost like a Mario Party-type game. But they teamed up with them to do a version of that with Mario.

53:20.000 --> 53:35.000
Now, as far as an American release, even though in the original announcement, GungHo America said it would be happening through Nintendo, a Nintendo spokesperson told another outlet that Puzzle and Dragons Super Mario Bros. Edition is a Japanese-only announcement.

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
So right now, the America release of this is still in flux.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
Yeah, until they announce it at E3.

53:40.000 --> 53:52.000
Right. The Match 3 game has local multiplayer and StreetPass functionality. By the way, the original Mobile Puzzle and Dragons has 6 million downloads in North America.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
Wow, that's a lot.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Is it because it's free?

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
Yes, I'm sure.

53:56.000 --> 54:01.000
Oh my god! There's 6 million downloads of a free game! That's unheard of! Oh, wait.

54:01.000 --> 54:04.000
I'm one of those downloads and I deleted it a long time ago.

54:04.000 --> 54:14.000
Yeah, of course. There's no way to lose in that scenario. You try it, you hate it, then you delete it. It's not that impressive.

54:14.000 --> 54:27.000
Now, there has been a Puzzle and Dragons already released for 3DS. This Puzzle and Dragons Z that had 1.5 million units sold in Japan. That's still pretty good. This is the first time that they're involving the Mario stuff.

54:27.000 --> 54:32.000
Just to say, Act F to say Fortune Street is the game you're trying to think of?

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
Yes, that was the game I was thinking of. Fortune Street.

54:33.000 --> 54:46.000
And Rama says Puzzle and Dragons is pretty fun. They actually have a DC Comics version of that game. I guess that makes sense because Marvel has the Puzzle Quest thing, so it's DC lined up with somebody else. Very interesting.

54:46.000 --> 55:04.000
So, we will see. Also, of note, apparently Nintendo's stock really liked, the investors really liked this news. The stock went way, way, way up at the end of the week this week after that announcement came up.

55:04.000 --> 55:12.000
But, they're not making a mobile game. They're putting a mobile game onto the 3DS. That's dumb. That's like putting Angry Birds on the 3DS.

55:12.000 --> 55:20.000
I think because people are looking at this going, Nintendo's partnering with a mobile phone company. If this game's successful, could the reverse happen?

55:20.000 --> 55:33.000
They're not and they won't because there's been several mobile games that have been popular that have come to the 3DS and that's it. People will buy it because there's Mario in it. That's it.

55:33.000 --> 55:47.000
I mean, you know, just like Angry Birds, still okay. Doodle Jump kind of. But, it's not news. If they were going to put out that version on mobile, that would be a big story. This is just kind of like, eh, whatever.

55:47.000 --> 55:56.000
Well, it'll be interesting to see if that happens later on. I don't think it's outside the realm of all possibility and I think that's why investors are really taking to this news.

55:56.000 --> 56:04.000
Is that if GungHo is going to be spending the time making this game, that perhaps it will be something on mobile devices. And that could be huge. Huge!

56:05.000 --> 56:13.000
Because all we have Nintendo-wise on mobile devices right now is what? A Pokédex? Which, the Pokémon company is a second party, so it's a little different.

56:13.000 --> 56:21.000
Yeah, they won't because it's going to cheapen their brand if they put it out as a free-to-play game. That's the way they see it.

56:21.000 --> 56:27.000
Alright, well we will see what develops. I still think this is a pretty big news, all things considered.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
DarkStalker, what do you have for us?

56:29.000 --> 56:36.000
Well, I've been a little bit lax in some of my UK news as of late, so I do have something for our folks overseas.

56:36.000 --> 56:46.000
The BBC is actually looking for developer studios to do video games based on some of its more popular series.

56:46.000 --> 56:55.000
They are visiting a London Mobile Games event later on in this month to look for developers.

56:55.000 --> 57:05.000
They want to do things for Doctor Who and Sherlock. They also are wanting to look into some of the past and future IPs as well.

57:05.000 --> 57:15.000
They're going to be doing two breakfast sessions on Tuesday, January 20th and Wednesday, January 21st, both between 9 to 10 AM.

57:15.000 --> 57:23.000
And they're informal, they just want to meet people, and it's going to be held at BBC Worldwide at 33 Foley Street, London.

57:23.000 --> 57:32.000
So if any of our developer friends happen to be over there, let us know how that goes. We want to know.

57:32.000 --> 57:37.000
I have something else for our British fans too.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
What?

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
I need you all to vote for Michelle Visage to win Celebrity Big Brother.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
Oh my god, Rob.

57:43.000 --> 57:51.000
No, this is very important. I need you all to vote for Michelle Visage, and I know you all don't like Katie Hopkins, and I completely understand why,

57:51.000 --> 57:58.000
but if she's the only one that's going to put that little celebrity blogger, I won't even say his name because it offends me,

57:58.000 --> 58:06.000
if she's the only one that will put that guy in his place, then I think you should keep her around too, as disgusting as a lot of the stuff is that she says outside the house.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
But at the end of the day, Michelle Visage should win.

58:08.000 --> 58:15.000
Just a very important note, this is a life or death scenario that I need our British listeners to get involved with.

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
Rob. Rob.

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
What?

58:17.000 --> 58:18.000
Rob. Rob. Rob.

58:18.000 --> 58:30.000
What? What? Oh, oh, oh. You can all wank about Doctor Who and Sherlock and the potential games, but heaven forbid I bring up the British show I like and.

58:30.000 --> 58:45.000
No, I was like, I was like, I want them to do a Top Gear racing game, but with like all of the commentary done by Jeremy What's His Face, because he's so dry and funny.

58:45.000 --> 58:52.000
He'd like make comments like, you know, just how badly people drift and stuff. I just want nothing but a game of him shitting on the player.

58:52.000 --> 58:56.000
Top Gear was a racing game. I used to love that game. It was on the Super Nintendo.

58:56.000 --> 59:02.000
Then, of course, we talk about British narrators and I my mind, it goes instantly to Stephen Fry, who is also in the news this last week.

59:02.000 --> 59:09.000
I'm sure you saw a little bit about that. That was that was interesting, although I don't think it's as big of a deal as people were making it out to be.

59:09.000 --> 59:18.000
But whatever. Anyway, sorry, Jamie, I took a very legitimate game develop story and turn it into gossip, but, you know, it happens.

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
Let's move on with some more news, Loki.

59:24.000 --> 59:31.000
So apparently the avatars on Xbox are going to be getting a makeover.

59:31.000 --> 59:36.000
They're possibly going to be coming back, I guess, to the Xbox One.

59:36.000 --> 59:43.000
And I don't know exactly. I guess they're going to show it off as part of like Windows 10 maybe.

59:43.000 --> 59:49.000
And cool, I guess I saw my I have my 3D printed avatar.

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
So now that's not going to be accurate anymore.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
I don't know. I don't know what I think about that.

59:53.000 --> 01:00:01.000
And also, you know what, I'm kind of curious to see how that's going to look, because remember, I think they kind of showed something similar with was it Mass Effect three?

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
You know, like all the Mass Effect games got better and better.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:08.000
But sometimes your character looked weirder and weirder as it like enhanced it.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.000
If you know what I mean, because she's she's the one to ask about those mods and things like that.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:19.000
That's pretty accurate. Like, you know, just like some of them I've seen, like, you know, hey, wait, I used to be a different skin color.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Oh, like how it would import look how big her eyes are.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Oh, yeah. The imports of your character from one into two were always awful.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:33.000
And it's like Mike, like my character looked great in one. And then when I imported him into two, it was like, why is he so surprised?

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:41.000
And then why is like completely different for a lot of the subjects? They changed the they added more vertices in the facial structure.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000
I follow you now. Yeah. The import from game to game was horrible.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:50.000
You were better off just recreating Shepard the way you wanted him or her to look in each game.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
And I got to be honest, I got to be honest. You know what?

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000
They're trying to make avatars a thing, but it's important and relevant. I'm so sorry.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000
I'm so sorry to interrupt. Important and relevant. The same thing is happening in World of Warcraft.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:08.000
OK, because they took all the old characters. Right. And they they took like dwarves and humans and gave them new models. Right.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:15.000
OK, I can tell you my character when they did that looks awful. Awful. Like, I hate the way she looks now.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
I have to see if my character is any different.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Oh, so that's the one downside to these upgrades is that they're usually downgrades in high definition.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Yeah. Basically, they're saying that they're going to ensure that avatars are not only gorgeous, but also highly performant across a wide scale of devices and work with designers, animators and artists and blah, blah, blah.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:46.000
You know, to be honest, any of the avatar kind of features I've seen didn't do a whole ton of the avatar stuff with the actual mainstream games.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000
I saw a lot of the stuff that supported avatars coming out of like the Xbox indie games.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Yeah, that's true.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000
And a lot of that seemed to be a little bit more interesting than, say, you know, the official stuff.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Yes, like the baby launching game that was on it. Wasn't it your avatar that was giving birth or something like that? Or were you the baby? I don't know.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.000
I seem to remember avatars were in that baby launching game that was on the 360.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000
That's awesome, though.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Which next to Bungie ferret tossing is an all time great on the Xbox Live indie games.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000
There's lots of great indie games, but that's what I'm saying. I don't know.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I guess it's cool that they're coming back, but it's just it didn't really take off like the Miis did. And even the Miis are kind of stupid. Like, they shouldn't really upgrade those.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:37.000
But the Miis are still around and they're very much used in a lot of the Nintendo games.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
They're fighters in Smash Bros. Wii.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
I understand that.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Or Smash Bros. for Wii U.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:49.000
I understand that. And I would love to see an enhanced version, especially the ones where people make designs out of the parts to make different things on their faces and things.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Drawing penises and that kind of stuff. And then just having to try to translate that into something more realistic would be hilarious.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:01.000
All right. Well, speaking of Nintendo and games that will probably incorporate the Miis one way or another.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Star Fox for Wii U is a thing, and they are saying it will be playable at E3 2015, which I extract from that means it won't be out any sooner in Japan or the US.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000
So those hoping for a spring release for Star Fox, haha, looks like it's going to be more like holiday.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Now, Miyamoto didn't talk a lot about what, you know, Star Fox outside anything that was already said at the last E3 and in between there.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.000
But it will utilize both the Wii U gamepad and the TV.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:35.000
I would think that Wii U gamepad would be like a radar. Would make sense? I don't know. I mean, I don't know. Again, we'll see.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
They're going to fly with tilt controls.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
We'll see. We'll see.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Now, Miyamoto was also asked, when will we get a new F-Zero game?

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000
First off, thank you somebody for confronting him and asking him. I appreciate that.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
So he punched him in the face and flipped him off.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:04:00.000
No, that's not what happened. What happened, Miyamoto said, they need to find the right controller interface for the game.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Why? Does your controller have buttons? Yes. Does your controller have a joystick? Yes.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
You have the right interface for F-Zero.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Yeah, considering Mario Kart 8 was not just, if you've been listening to OLR, Mario Kart 8 was not only my favorite Wii U game last year, it was my favorite game period last year.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:29.000
So I have a hard time understanding why a driving game like F-Zero could not be done on the Wii U.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Wow, that's a whole ton of, that's like a big, you know, heaping snow shovel full of bullshit right there.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.000
I agree. Look, I love Miyamoto, but that's a bullshit answer.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000
This is why I need to interview these people. Remember how I interviewed, remember when I was talking to James?

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
So what do you think about it in the groove? You know, that kind of stuff.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
So are you going to make a new F-Zero? We need to find the right controller.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
I'd be like, I'm sorry, that doesn't make any fucking sense.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
When you spend all this money on your controller, it has a fucking screen.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
And you wonder why you don't get asked to do interviews with Miyamoto.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000
What about, you know, your controller has buttons. What else do you want in there?

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Do you need a pedal so I can cycle my car around?

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.000
I have two mindsets of this. I have two mindsets of this.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:18.000
One, that answer I don't accept because aren't they selling F-Zero on Virtual Console, like the original?

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
So there is an F-Zero game on Wii U.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Now I understand, you probably want to argue with me, well it's different in the controls because it's just emulated.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, I get that. But an F-Zero game exists on the Wii U, so you can't say it can't be done.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000
But here's the other thing I have with that, and that I think is the real answer.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:43.000
I think, because obviously there is a successor to the Wii U being worked on right now,

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.000
and I'm not even talking about some of those other articles that have been around the internet this week and all that stuff.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:54.000
It's just not only is Sony and Microsoft planning what's next, obviously Nintendo's planning what's next as well.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:04.000
We all know that. So maybe something to do with controls, which certainly the same thing could be said about the Wii and the Wii U,

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:10.000
but maybe there's something else that Nintendo has in store for their next console,

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:15.000
that they're going to come out and have F-Zero as a launch title or as close to it,

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:22.000
that, oh, this was the better controls suited for F-Zero that Miyamoto was talking about a couple years ago.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Unless it's VR, I don't give a fuck what the hell he's talking about.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:32.000
There's literally, unless part of the console is going to be that fucking cabinet that swivels around, I just don't care.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:37.000
It doesn't make any sense that, oh, well, I'm sorry, we just don't have the right control scheme for that.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:43.000
That makes no sense. That's, no. I'm sorry. I just don't buy that for a second.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:52.000
YYR in chat with all caps says, the Wii U game pad literally has every control method ever conceived for use in a video game.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:07:00.000
That is why I think what I just said there, the second half of that, I think that's what it is.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:07.000
I think that there's not going to be an F-Zero on the Wii U because they're already planning it for the successor console,

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:20.000
which, to be fair, if the next Nintendo console is going to be equivalent of the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and perhaps even a small step above in power,

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:31.000
I think a, you know, blow your panties off, F-Zero, HD, neon, flashy, high-speed game could be awesome.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000
I think Akdeft has the right idea here. Powerglow 2.0.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000
And maybe that's just it. Maybe that's it. Powerglow 2.0. That's what it is.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.000
You're just going to, you're going to grab that fake steering wheel and it's so bad.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.000
All right, well, we'll see. All right, moving on. Dark Sakura.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Well.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:55.000
How would you control your eraser and F-Zero? Dark Sakura?

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Telepathy.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Ah. Maybe that's the new Nintendo console. You're going to control it with your mind.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
I think things and they happen.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
I would, you know.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
I am a biotic god.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Honestly, I mean, I guess it was sort of like, I forget the game because I never actually played that one when I'd go to, was it the Virtual World?

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:21.000
But they had the Mars Racing game or whatever that was kind of like that. But I always played the Battletech ones.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
I kind of fear.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000
But one of those would be cool.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:30.000
I kind of fear Dark Sakura's Telepathy F-Zero game, though, because I just worry that, you know, people are going to walk in and it's going to be like,

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Rob, why, why whenever you play F-Zero is it just it's not even racing. The camera's just panning around Captain Falcon's butt the whole time.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000
What is?

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.000
That wouldn't be me. No, no, no, no, no. That wouldn't. I'm not the Captain Falcon fangirl.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:49.000
You'd be, you would walk in the house and be, I was thinking that, too.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:58.000
For me playing that game, it would actually be telling other people how awful they drive and get off my road.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Coming to the Nintendo Wii U 2.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Dark Sakura's aggressive driver.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000
You need to play Grand Theft Auto 5. You can flip people off in the game.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000
When you're driving by.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000
But I don't like the Grand Theft Auto games.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
You just haven't played the right one yet.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000
All right. Anyway.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
You mean any of them?

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Dark Sakura, sorry to derail you. Not sorry.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Pfft. Bitch. Okay.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Rob. Rob. Rob. Rob. Rob. Rob. Rob. Rob.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
What?

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Hearts.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:30.000
So 3D Afterburner 2 is going to be coming out on Nintendo 3DS.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Yay.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000
On January 15th. Yay.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Thanks Sega for giving us a release date.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000
It's in the second batch of 3D classics.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Among others, we have 3D Fantasy Zone, 3D Outrun, 3D Fantasy Zone 2, and 3D Thunder Blade.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Which means I will have these.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Because. Fantasy Zone.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Fantasy Zone is the best Sega game ever.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000
I thought Space Harrier was the best Sega game ever.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:06.000
What is my favorite 3 order of games?

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Uh. The Guardian Legend.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Space Harrier.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Uh. Mass Effect.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Garrett.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Fantasy Zone.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
And then Space Harrier.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
I was going to say Final Fantasy 7.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000
No.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000
But only the scene where Aerith gets stabbed. Over and over again.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Did you see what got put on my Facebook?

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Yes.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
It was the Aerith sword sharpener.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Yes I did.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I need one of those for real.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.000
I did.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000
They just need to make those.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.000
I want someone to get like the little guy who is like the knife holder and have it be turned into Aerith.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:42.000
So Dark Sakura talking about Afterburner. I have it.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
And this is how F-Zero can fit in the picture too. You ready?

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
World exclusive here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.000
I have deduced based on Miyamoto's comments and Dark Sakura's mouth.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
I have deduced. Because she has telepathy powers. Remember?

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I have deduced.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
It's because I'm psycho and have ESPN.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:02.000
I have deduced what it will be on the Wii U too. You ready? You ready?

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
It's going to be a chair.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000
And the chair can go 360 degrees.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Just like the Afterburner cabinets. Right?

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Where you can flip upside down.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.000
And the F-Zero cabinets. Which were badass.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.000
It's going to be a chair that will flip upside down and drop you on your ass.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Can we get like a long winded Peter Molyneux video where they're talking about,

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:36.000
you know, up until now we've never considered about the crucial aspect of playing video games.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Where is he?

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Where is Peter Molyneux right now?

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Because somebody needs to check and make sure he's not in Nintendo headquarters.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000
And if he's there, he needs to be removed from the building.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
He needs to be against a white backdrop.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Because, you know, it's just like him talking with his name in the bottom there.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Just talking about how essential the chair is.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
I don't know. It's just...

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
It's going to be something stupid.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.000
It's going to be like, we came up with this brand new controller.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:07.000
You take this little, you know, it's a ball on a string and you swing it around to go faster and you move it.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000
It's going to be crap.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000
It's going to be crap.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000
If Peter Molyneux is in a partnership with Nintendo, I will shut off the press conference.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Because, you know, I ain't getting invited. So I will shut off the press conference.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
When he walks up, I'll just shut it off.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
I hope that they would do a new, like, Virtual Boy.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000
But, I don't know, VR...

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
But, see, that's the one thing.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000
It's like, if you wait too long, people are just going to do it better.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Alright, we'll see.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Although, I think, again, we're in a slow period of the year.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
There's probably not a lot to talk about.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Let's check in anyway and see what will be released in a store near you soon.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Nothing.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Nothing in the US this week.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Yeah, unfortunately not until, I think, the end of this month.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Unless, you know, I haven't seen any new announcements of things.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:01.000
But, yeah, I don't think anything is coming out of here physically until, like, the 27th.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Well, believe it or not, it's a pretty similar story over in Japan.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.000
There are some releases coming up on the 20th of January.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000
But that's not this week.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Oh, wait, no, I lied.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
There is one release I found for this week.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000
You ready?

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:20.000
It's Bioshock Infinite, the complete edition for the PlayStation 3 in Japan.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
That is out on the 15th of January.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.000
So, there's one game to look forward to this week.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Which is really just a repackaging of a game that's been out for a while.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Actually, it's not the 27th, it's the 20th.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
And that would be that Saints' Rogue, Gad out of Hell.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Which I am totally interested in playing.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Despite the fact that the last two Saints' Rogue games pissed me off.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Because they weren't as good as they could have been.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.000
But I still will play everything and support the franchise because I'm stupid.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Oh, one other game.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000
There is one other game in Japan this week.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Hooray, on the 15th.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:56.000
On the 3DS this week, Kenka Banchao 6, Soul and Blood.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:02.000
And this seems like one of those... I don't know what the hell kind of game this is.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
It's like a fighting, manga, sim...

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
I like how that guy had laser eyes.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
I think it's based on a series over there though.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Because obviously it's the sixth game.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
But there's a scene where they're playing volleyball.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
And I'm like, is this Top Gun? What is this?

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000
What is it? Tennis? And then they fight each other.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
That's interesting.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Well, that's how...

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
War's gotten a whole lot more dramatic.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000
That's right. Dark Soccer, how about the UK?

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Nothing this week. I'll go ahead and do next week.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.000
On 19th of January we have Black Guards 2 for PC.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
And on the 23rd, Saints Row, get out of hell.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
On a bunch of shit.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Alright. First big, big release of the year.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.000
So Captain Toad Treasure Tracker is not a big release then, huh?

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.000
That was bumped up and actually came out a little sooner.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Yeah, it came out on the 8th.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
But no, I think it was bumped up sooner.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
I think they ended up getting it at the end of December.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
I don't think it actually... I think it came out actually sooner than January.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
I think. I could be wrong.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000
It could be.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
But we had it in the States a long time ago.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
So we always do. So whatever.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
You know what? Everybody in the UK, I will trade places with you.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
You can come over here and get your games early.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
And I can live somewhere with free healthcare.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Why don't you just go to Canada?

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000
It's a lot closer.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Poutine.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Alright, now you're weighing the options.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.000
But first, Loki.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:34.000
So apparently, originally it was thought that there was a leak to when Kingdom Hearts 3 would be coming out.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:39.000
According to Bill Farmer, who does the voice acting for Goofy in the game.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.000
He said that the game was due out in 2015.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:47.000
However, Square Enix went to correct saying there was a goof.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
The release date for Kingdom Hearts 3 remains unannounced.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
It's coming out next year. Come on.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
I mean, it's probably coming out next year.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
But they just haven't announced it yet.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000
And see, they didn't say it wasn't coming out.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
They just said it remains unannounced.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000
I don't think it is coming out next year.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
I think Final Fantasy XV is their tentpole for next year.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.000
That's cool. I'm down with that.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
I'd rather play Final Fantasy XV.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.000
I think XV is going to make it next year, finally.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.000
And then I think Kingdom Hearts 3 is 2016.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Why would they dump both the same year?

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000
That's a lot of Square power for a year.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000
I mean, hey, if they do it, I will be very happy.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.000
But it just seems like XV, especially with XV having a demo coming out in April,

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000
seems to be a lot more ready for prime time than Kingdom Hearts 3,

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
which we've seen very little out of.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000
I mean, yes, I understand there's voice acting and all this other stuff.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
But this guy, who knew?

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.000
It might have been like a side story thing that's going to end up coming out.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Like a prequel movie to the game or something that might come out.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
And just because he thinks it's due out in 2015,

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000
just because he doesn't know too much about the development

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000
aside from that he's done his voice acting and that's it.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:01.000
I mean, there's a lot of stuff that could be delayed for various reasons.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000
So I would say that it's definitive.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:09.000
And blanketing 2015, that's still very plausible

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
because it could come out at the end of the year.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000
You could have Final Fantasy come out in the summer

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000
and then have Kingdom Hearts for fourth quarter or something.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
We'll see, we'll see.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000
All right, well, one more story for you guys here for this first half of the show.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000
And this is about Loki's favorite character, Tingle.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
And we almost had a Tingle resurgence this past year, apparently,

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.000
because Hyrule Warriors, the team that made that game,

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
they wanted to put Tingle in the game.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Tecmo Koei actually wanted to put Tingle in the game.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.000
But Eiji Aonuma said no.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Include a different character besides Tingle.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.000
And the quote,

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Actually, Tingle was a character we kind of considered and sort of went back and forth on.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:58.000
We really wanted to include him, but Mr. Aonuma suggested that it might be good to include some other character.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Well, that's sad.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Why not both?

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Porque no los dos? Why not both?

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
I just don't understand why they...

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
...resources, blah, blah, blah.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000
It would have been funny to do him, like, all realistic.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Just have, like, some guy in, like, you know, tights or whatever, just fighting.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
But he kind of has, like, the Tingle...

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
And Loki volunteers to do the mocap.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:29.000
I wonder if this means, uh, what this could mean for Tingle's presence or lack thereof in the Wii U version of the game.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Oh, you'll get a new Tingle game before you'll get a new F-Zero game.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Oh, fuck you. All right.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
That was cold.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Hey, I don't like it any more than you, okay?

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.000
All right. You know what? Let's travel back to a time when this was all a little bit simpler.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000
There was no arguing for characters to be in or not in certain games.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.000
You just took what you got and that was it. There was no internet forum to complain about it on.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
It's the classic game of the week.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Every week Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game where she thinks,

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Hey, you should be playing this. And if you're not, well...

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Then get a PC Engine.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.000
That's right. Get a PC Engine so you can play it. There's a big hit. Dark Sakura.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:13.000
What is this week's classic game of the week?

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:18.000
It is a semi-little known game called Psychic Storm.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:25.000
It came out, um, in 1992. It was put out by Telnet Japan and Alpha System.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:31.000
It was a super CD-ROM too, so you can play it on an American Turbo Duo.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:38.000
First of all, Psychic Storm is really just a basic virtual, not virtual, vertical shooter.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:46.000
It starts in a place called New Hong Kong City where there are these insect-like aliens trying to take over.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:52.000
And so the people who they have to get to pilot these...

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000
They're kind of like ships, but they're kind of buggy too.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000
This would have been perfect for the bug theme, I guess.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.000
But they're psychically bonded to their ships.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:08.000
They have Alex who has the Vulcan Gun Laser, Char with the Psycho Shell,

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Joe has a short-ranged Hell Flame, and Natasha has the Ion Laser, which she was always my favorite to play.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:23.000
They also can transform. So Alex can turn into a huge butterfly or something.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:28.000
They get a bunch of, you know, enemies will drop power-ups. It's the usual type of thing.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Some orbs can actually bring back your... fill up your life bar, that type of thing.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:39.000
You also have, of course, bombs that you have to use very, very sparingly.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:45.000
And of course it has two-player simultaneous mode where you can actually combine your transformations.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000
And transformations are what I'm getting into now.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:55.000
With your transformations, they actually can take up to 15 seconds to do your transform.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:02.000
And the game actually gives you time to do them, but in some cases, as I found out the first time I played the game,

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:10.000
if you pull off a transformation on a boss battle at just the right time, you can actually completely avoid the boss battle and just kill it by transforming.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:15.000
So basically, you do a Sailor Moon dance and the boss is impressed to death.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Sorry, I popped my neck.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:30.000
It also, you know, they've got the different weapons and then they have their different psychic attacks that, you know, take over the whole screen.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Although one of them... back when we first played this game, my husband thought they said, I get pissed off.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.000
It actually said Psychic Storm, but my husband thought they said, I get pissed off.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
So from then forward, this game be called...

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Because they sound so similar.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Well, it was the accent.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000
I know.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:55.000
But since then, my husband has referred to this game as, I get pissed off.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:05.000
It really is, I mean, as far as shooters go, I'd have to say it's pretty generic except that the level and character designs are actually really neat.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
And it has a pretty decent soundtrack.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.000
I mean, it actually follows along some different genre.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:19.000
And I sadly do not have too much more actual information about this game or its release because I couldn't find anything.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
I found very little.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:27.000
But... so a lot of actually what I am giving you is just from having played the game.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:38.000
It does have some little elements of very bad voice acting in it, as in badly recorded voice acting.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:47.000
But I'd have to say that it's probably a solid... I'd give it a solid 8 out of 10 if I were going to rate it.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:52.000
It's a fun game. It's good to sit down and put an hour into it and beat the game.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
It's not super, super difficult.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000
But it's got enough challenge in it to keep it interesting.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:02.000
So, I mean, it's no spriggin' but, I mean, if you're looking at PC Engine games.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.000
But Psychic Storm is a really good solid game.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
And they get pissed off.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Alright.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
There it is. Your classic game of the week.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Psychic Storm, or I get pissed off on the PC Engine.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
PC Engine Duo.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Considering there was a lot of people last week who absolutely recognized the classic game of the week.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000
In fact, I think you saw a few tweets on it, like, I love that game and so forth.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:30.000
You kind of went from something very well known to something probably very few people have even played.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.000
You know, if I don't do something obscure every so often, I cease to be a mess of myself.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000
That is part of the charm of the classic game of the week segment.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Well, I've done games that, like, you only know them if you're a collector.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Sure.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:47.000
And some games I've done, I think, are games that are on my wish list.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.000
I do have this game, though. I do legit have this game.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Alright. Well, maybe for a future game stream at some point we'll check this out, like this guy's doing.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.000
I have to hook up the streaming stuff and then get the PC Engine out of storage.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
And then find the game again.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Dig it all up.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Alright, there it is. Your classic game of the week.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Psychic Storm on the PC Engine.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Very good pick from Dark Soccer.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:17.000
I could actually re-crap now. I forgot the name of that emulator that I used to play.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
That I could play my turbo games on.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Alright, don't go crazy now.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Alright, we're going to take a break, guys, though.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.000
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, we've got more news for you guys.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:33.000
The Fugu Question of the Week. Some news about Nintendo quitting the market.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Alright, at least in one part of the world we'll talk about what that's all about.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Live on this Sunday night, January the 11th of 2015.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Episode number 583 of our show in progress.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.000
A reminder, no show next week.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.000
584 will be here in two weeks.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.000
During the break, Loki's showing me what he had put together so far for his Game Jam project.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Kind of his concept for the start of the game.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000
It looks fine. I see where some of that stuff is bugging you.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Like when you... I don't want to spoil things.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.000
But you can definitely see that stitching in the world map that was bugging you crazy.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
I don't care about it anymore yet. It's not so bad.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:28.000
It's buggy. It's part of the atmosphere.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Now that maybe some of these other people have freed up,

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
not working on their games as much now because they're done,

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.000
you should see if you get any help.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000
I'm okay. I can do it. It's a sick start.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.000
You're such a boy. You won't stop and ask for directions.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
If I need help, I will. Otherwise, I'm just going to look up the answer.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
That's the only way we'll learn how to do it.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.000
If I look up the answer or figure it out myself.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Yeah, fair enough.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Alright, let's get into some rapid fire news.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Also in this segment, of course, the FUGO Question of the Week,

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
our mailbag coming up, the FUs of the Week,

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.000
and your phone calls at 1-877-GAMO-LR

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000
or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.000
But not yet. We've got a few segments to get to before we get to calls.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Let's do some rapid fire news, starting off with Loki.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Alright, so there's a small rumor that the GTA 5 PC retail copies won't be Steam compatible,

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
although I think that's a bunch of bullshit.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Apparently, this is coming from a NeoGaf user.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Or they said that they...

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Well, that's credible.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
No, I'm sorry. I thought it was from the user.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
It's actually they were talking about...

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:37.000
It's like, how many references deep is this?

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Anyways, somebody says that a listing on Green Man Gaming

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.000
says that it has the other DRM logo on the GTA 5 page.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.000
What the thought is, though, is that it's not actually other DRM.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.000
It's just that it's tied in with Rockstar Social Club,

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.000
so you kind of need a Social Club account.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:01.000
But they're saying that they have to log into their Rockstar Social Club account,

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.000
and it won't be able to integrate with Steam,

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:07.000
which doesn't make any sense to me,

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
because I know that, granted, out of four,

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
you have to log in with your Social Club account,

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
and that works just fine.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.000
And also, Max Payne 3, hello,

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
that also had Rockstar Social Club,

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:23.000
so that whole argument gets thrown out the window.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
I think, honestly, it's going to have Steam support,

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
and it'll be just fine.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.000
It wouldn't make any sense that they'd be selling versions of it on Steam

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
and not sell it at retail,

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
which is basically going to be a Steam key anyway,

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
so it doesn't make any sense.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.000
But whatever, that's what they're reporting,

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.000
so we'll see in a couple weeks here when it comes out on the 27th.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Now, of course, with any release of Saints Row,

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:53.000
they always do some lavish pre-order incentive or special editions,

01:27:53.000 --> 01:28:01.000
so they have a version of the game that's going to be coming with a Ouija board.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:06.000
They're calling it Ouija, but it's a Ouija board.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:11.000
I think the actual name Ouija, like O-U-I, is trademark.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Yeah, it's Hasbro.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:18.000
But, yeah, so you can get that with a special edition that's available at Game, I guess.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000
So you can talk to your friends in hell, or make some new ones.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Exactly.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Through the power of...

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:28.000
How is a Ouija board powered by the spirits, I guess,

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.000
through the spirits that live in your bedroom and watch you touch yourself at night?

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000
They want to make contact with you.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Please stop touching yourself at night.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.000
I don't want to see that anymore.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.000
But, yeah, you can get that.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
There's basically...

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:53.000
It doesn't say what the price is of it, but it looks cool.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:56.000
I guess, apparently, if you...

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
There's a contest that goes along with it.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.000
If you take a picture of yourself using the Ouija board,

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.000
then you would be able to win a night on a haunted...

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Or was it a tour on a haunted town or something like that

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
with some UK spirit medium guy?

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Maybe they'll make one out of rubber called the squeegee board.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
The squeegee board? Yeah.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Great for washing windows and contacting the dead.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.000
And that should be coming out next week on the 20th in North America

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.000
and the 23rd internationally.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.000
I, on the other hand, am not playing on buying a special edition.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
I will pick up the version that's on PlayStation 4

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.000
because I've only beaten the game three or four times already.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:42.000
And, and, seriously, what the fuck?

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.000
I've played the game over 40 hours

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.000
and yet I don't have the achievement for playing it over 40 hours.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000
That's a long time.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
That's not a long time.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.000
And it's just not giving it to me, whatever.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:59.000
And anyways, there's another big game right around the corner

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
and that's Witcher 3 Wild Hunt.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:05.000
And they've released the PC specs for the game.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:08.000
So if you're looking to see what, you know,

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.000
if your computer can run it, and I was trying to figure out if mine can,

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.000
I don't, eh, might be able to, I don't know.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Then you can check it out and see if it'll run on your system.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:25.000
But looks like rather modest specs.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
So, cool.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
That's it.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Alright.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.000
I guess, I upgraded my computer just last year,

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
so I'm thinking Witcher 3 won't be a problem for me.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.000
No, no, they're basically...

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Other people may have some issues.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:44.000
The minimum they're saying that you need a Core i5 2500K

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
and then, what is it?

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:50.000
They're saying AMDY is a Phenom 2 X4940,

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
which I have no fucking clue how long I sold.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Some people are going to be left out in the cold with those specs.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.000
I know my graphics card can run that

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:01.000
because it's higher spec than what the minimum is.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.000
As far as the high end, though, not so much.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Well, let's talk about the awesome games done quick marathon.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
I don't know how many of you guys watched any part of that.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
I unfortunately didn't watch any of it.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Oh my gosh.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000
I know, I wanted to.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000
A lot of it's on YouTube.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000
I just haven't got a chance to yet.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.000
I will watch it.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:21.000
The Ocarina bit last night was a great finale.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.000
They were still streaming some this morning too, but just like random stuff.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Yeah, they do like a little extended finale, I think.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Yeah, some of the Hoard House guys like Extrofer gets really into that.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Shane was getting into it this year.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
A lot of my friends on Twitter get into that.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Flaco.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Yeah, definitely Flaco.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
It's all for a good cause.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.000
It was all for the Prevent Cancer Foundation.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:43.000
They ended up raising, just to conclude this year,

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:49.000
since it is over now, they have actually raised over $1.1 million.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:54.000
My understanding is last check, it was actually up to $1.3 million.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:57.000
I wonder if it even got higher because, you know, there's still,

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000
thanks to the YouTube and the Humble Bundle, there's still some figures,

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
I think, coming in.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000
So I'm not sure what they're at now.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Did I buy the Humble Bundle?

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
I don't even remember now, but I probably should buy it.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Oh my gosh, I just looked just now.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.000
They're up to $1.5 million as of right this moment.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
No, it's over.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
I've missed out on a bunch of games I already have.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Whoops.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Whoops at you.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.000
That's all right.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.000
I had pretty much everything in the bundle.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
That's why I didn't buy it right away.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.000
But it was for charity.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Yeah, but I don't, how many copies of games do I need, really?

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.000
All right.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Well, congrats to the great, what a great way to kick off the year.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
A bunch of people that really, really love those games.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Doing a good thing for charity.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Let's carry that tone throughout 2015, please,

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.000
and none of the fuckery that brought down last year, please.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.000
So congrats to the awesome games done quick, guys.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Let's talk about Far Cry 4, which is not being handled as quick.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:52.000
There's some issues, apparently, with Far Cry 4 and the Xbox One.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Apparently, there was some rumors out there that DRM issues

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.000
were causing legitimate digital copies of Far Cry 4 to stop functioning.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Apparently, the game at one point was delisted,

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.000
although Microsoft says the delisting was an accident.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Microsoft quickly fixed it.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
But some players were complaining of issues,

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:14.000
even after they had deleted and redownloaded the game,

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.000
that the game basically wasn't working.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
So some folks were thinking,

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.000
oh, the delisting was to fix whatever the issue was,

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:26.000
although Microsoft, in a statement, says that the problems

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.000
had nothing to do with any sort of hidden DRM,

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.000
but there is no explanation as to what really happened.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.000
They say, as far as the DRM goes,

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.000
quote, if customers own the rights to a game,

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000
they can visit their download history and initiate a redownload

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.000
whenever they please, even if the game has been delisted from the Xbox Store

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
and is no longer available for purchase,

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.000
which is pretty much a canned answer that has nothing to do with a specific scenario.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Lastly, since we've been talking about game jams and dev stuff,

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Steam Dev Days was happening about a year ago at this time,

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
but there was no second year.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:06.000
It did not happen this year. It's not happening.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Basically, a representative from Steam saying,

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:15.000
quote, Steam Dev Days was a great way to brief a large number of Steam developers.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
This year, our focus will be a bit different,

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:21.000
so we're planning a larger than usual presence at GDC.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
So there will not be a Steam Dev Days this year,

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:26.000
but we will certainly consider doing it again in the future.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:30.000
So, you know, last year, Steam also had the Steam Box thing,

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.000
which never did end up coming out. I guess they'll be coming out this year.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
But they had the whole Steam Dev Days to go with that.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:41.000
This year, it sounds like they're going to be kind of rolling that over into GDC this year,

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:47.000
which, by the way, there is rumor that Steam will unveil the finalized Steam controller design.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.000
It's been early stuff.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:52.000
But the finalized design will show up in March at the Game Developers Conference.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
March is going to be a very interesting month,

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:58.000
because you have literally GDC and PAX East at the same time.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.000
They do overlap a little bit this year,

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:04.000
as opposed to being really close to each other as they were in years past.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.000
So, there you go.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.000
We'll see what comes out of GDC in just a couple months.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Even though we don't usually get the big game announcements like you get at E3,

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:21.000
there's usually a little something here and there as far as,

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.000
here's a new something that developers will have to work with.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.000
So we'll see.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
A few things.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:34.000
There is actually a notice for Steam.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Double Dragon Trilogy is going to be on Steam,

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
and good old games.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:45.000
So those should be up on January 15th.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000
But ask yourself, do you really want to play Double Dragon 3?

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Do you really?

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Because I bet you don't.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
I've already got it.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.000
I don't know, ask Dan. He's the one who plays it.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Also now, Thetrthym Final Fantasy Curtain Call is getting Xenogears DLC.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:07.000
So you can get all of your Xenogears music stuff on that you would ever, ever want to.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:18.000
And then, last but not least, Elder Scrolls Arena is going to be free on PC.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:21.000
You just go to elderscrolls.com slash arena,

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
and you can download it for free.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
For free.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:31.000
You can check out where all the lore upon lore upon lore in Skyrim and Oblivion and all that came from.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Yup.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Know your roots.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.000
There it is.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Hitstun, what do you know about the Double Dragon Trilogy, arcade or NES versions?

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000
My thought is it's arcade.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.000
I think so.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Because a different company developed the NES versions.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
So it's the arcade versions.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:51.000
And the iOS versions, and I think it's on Android too, are based on arcade.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:55.000
It's just a port of the mobile phone stuff for PC.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.000
I think.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.000
That's what I was getting from what I was reading anyway.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Alright, well let's see what I get in reading your responses to the FUGL Question of the Week.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and Google communities.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.000
You put those words together, you get FUGL.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:23.000
And we ask our communities a question each week and read some of our favorite answers here on the air.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Although this week's question being pretty short, I think we'll get a lot of answers in tonight.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:33.000
And since the news is a little bit light this week, I thought we'd do some more talk about the year,

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
kind of looking forward to what's going on.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
So we asked the listeners this week,

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:42.000
although some of the biggest releases of 2015 will surely be revealed at upcoming expos and conferences,

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:45.000
like the E3, the GDC, the PAXes and so forth,

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:50.000
we want to know what game at the moment are you most looking forward to in 2015?

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Starting on Google Plus tonight, Rettertainment says,

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:57.000
I'm most looking forward to hearing anything about The Last Guardian.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Failing that mirrors edge.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Act Deft responded, Kirby and the Rainbow Curse.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:07.000
But if I have to pick something not Kirby, Splatoon.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:11.000
This game looks really interesting and I really want to see how Nintendo makes this work.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Also, Overwatch is another game I really want to try out.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Prince Peach Fuzz over on Google Plus says,

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Metal Gear Solid 5, with a little exclamation point,

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.000
meaning we caught his attention apparently with that question.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Let's see, looking at some of the answers over on Facebook.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
There's a lot of answers on Facebook.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Monty Boggs says,

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:39.000
After playing the Halo 5 beta, it's become my most anticipated game at the moment.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Let's see, Andy R. said,

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:45.000
IAVT Colorful, it's a rhythm game coming to the Vita,

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.000
featuring one of the newer Vocaloids, IA,

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.000
which is like Hatsune Miku is a Vocaloid.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Ursa Being Slurpy said,

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.000
It's a tie between Witcher 3 and The Division.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000
AZHP says,

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Metal Gear Solid 5, I replayed Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3 on the HD collection.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.000
I was reminded how crazy and dumb that game series is,

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
with regards to story and weird easter eggs.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
I can't wait to see what Kojima has done this time.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Fifth Dream says,

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Final Fantasy Type 0 HD is what I'm waiting for most.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Cial says,

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Bravely Second.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Renji221 says,

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Right now I'd have to say Batman Arkham Knight from the gameplay they've shown so far.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Guillermo R. says,

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.000
If the new Zelda decides to show up in 2015, then that's it for me.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Oh, and Final Fantasy XV, with the demo coming out March,

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
it should come out before the year is over, right?

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Am I stupid to hope it'll actually get finished?

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000
If you are, Guillermo, then call me stupid right there with you.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Tigerclaw says,

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
There are many games coming out this year,

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.000
but I think two of my most anticipated games have to be the new Star Fox on Wii U

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
and Batman Arkham Knight.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Last but not least,

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Red the Haze says,

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Yakuza 5.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
I know it's an older PS3 game,

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
but I love how you have a gritty gangster crime drama,

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:58.000
with a teen girl idol who has random dance battles with people as combat.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Dance battles are made by the people who make the Hatsune Miku Project D.Va games.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
That does sound awesome, actually.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.000
I think Yakuza is a series I'd like to see.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Yakuza is a series I really need to get into that I haven't been playing enough of.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Clearly, if that's what the series is all about.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.000
That's not what the series is all about.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
They just do some silly things from time to time.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
I'm okay with silly things from time to time.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000
How about you guys?

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Most anticipated games of 2015?

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.000
I would like to see, basically, a Crackdown.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
That looks awesome.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.000
I would like to see No Man's Sky.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:41.000
As far as beyond that, it's whatever else we haven't heard of yet.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:45.000
I'd love to try out a virtual reality thing,

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
whether it be the Oculus Rift,

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
or if it's the Morpheus,

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
or something else.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
That would be kind of fun.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:56.000
That's what I'm more interested in is the VR stuff,

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
what they're going to do with that.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
But yeah, Crackdown.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
I've got to have some Crackdown.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
That might be a thing, because that's something that

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Microsoft really pimped out last year,

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:10.000
so I would assume this E3, they're going to show the gameplay.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Well, even Quantum Break looked pretty awesome.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
That's true, that's still a thing.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Check that out.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.000
I don't remember what Sony had, aside from Uncharted,

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
but I just don't care about that series.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
So I don't remember what else they had.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Street Fighter V, which obviously is more Capcom,

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
but there was a bunch of stuff there.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:31.000
I know they had tons of E3, I just don't remember.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
The show was huge, too.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
I still don't remember what...

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Honestly, I'm more interested...

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
The order is right around the corner.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
That doesn't look that great.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
I'm more interested in the stuff that they haven't talked about yet.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Like, hey, Saints Row 5.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.000
And let's have a good Saints Row 5,

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
because I don't know what the fuck they could possibly do now

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.000
with Saints Row, aside from time travel.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.000
I think it's hit the peak of ridiculousness

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
that it could possibly hit.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
DarkSakura, what about you?

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
What's your most anticipated game of 2015?

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
I honestly don't know.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Probably more Dragon Age DLC.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Well, I was gonna say...

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Silent Hills.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Oh, Silent Hills. That's a good one.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Oh, I can't believe none of our listeners said that.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:18.000
But then again, there's no guarantee it'll be this year, right?

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000
I don't care.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
PT Part 2.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
I actually...

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Well, I was gonna say, DarkSakura, I may be helping you with an answer.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:29.000
I'm hopeful that Mass Effect Don't Call It 4 is this year.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Yeah, but I'm really trying not to get my hopes up, so...

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
I would think no later than Spring 2016.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.000
I don't want my hopes to get up and then have my heart broken.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
I understand, I understand.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Save that if we can't have more info on Mass Effect Don't Call It 4.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Final Fantasy XV for me, which some of the other listeners already said.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
I definitely...

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
And I'm of the mindset that that'll be this year.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
I don't wanna play Pretty Boy Road Trip the game.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Pretty Boy Road Trip is one very small part of a much larger game.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
I know, I know.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
I think we're focusing too much on that.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Huh. You alright?

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Yeah, I just...

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:11.000
There was something I did have on a list, but for the life of me, I cannot remember what it is right now.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.000
What about going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Tigerclaw says, what about Battlefront 3?

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Do you think that'll come out this year?

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
You know when I first looked at that, I thought it said Battle Toads.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
That's a huge rumor.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
Battlefront 3 will come out when Star Wars comes out.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
They're gonna time it with that release, I'm guessing.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Zelda also would be another one.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Or Zelda Wii U. Did anybody say Zelda Wii?

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Oh no, I think we did have at least one or two listeners that said that.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
That might be one.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Absolutely, Zelda Wii U. I can't wait to see more on that.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Especially if they're going the Skyrim route with it.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Isn't that the second thing, a DLC coming for Mario Kart 8 sometime soon?

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Oh yeah, the Animal Crossing.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
March, I think, is when that's due.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Why is it so long? I mean...

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
I think they just wanna stretch it out as long as they can.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
That's ridiculous.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
I know, a little silly.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Maybe that's around the time they're going to announce an Animal Crossing Wii U game.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Maybe.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Or...

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
That's the time that they're gonna release more Amiibos

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
that are gonna coincide with the DLC.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Ah, maybe.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
So right around the time they'll have Animal Crossing Amiibos

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
they go along with, you know,

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Animal Crossing and Mario Kart.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
We'll see.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Alright.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Let's get back into some news.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
And your calls in a little while here at 1877 Game OLR.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
But first, we've got a little bit of news to get through.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Loki.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Yes, Nintendo has decided to end distribution of its hardware and software in Brazil.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
They're saying due to the high import tariffs.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
And starting January 2015,

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Gaming do Brazil,

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
a wholly owned subsidiary of...

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
I'm not even gonna pronounce that.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
It's not.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
It's not.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
It's not.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
It's not.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
It's not.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Yeah, and I'm just gonna save a video.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
I'm not even gonna pronounce that, too hard for me.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
stands at home

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
We'll no longer distribute products in Brazil.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
And despite the changes in Brazil,

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
There'll be a distributor for

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
There'll be a distributor for Latin America

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:03.000
And will be remaining, committed to the brand

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
and the region.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
So, kind of sucks.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
But, I guess, you know,

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
They're saying it's just so ridiculous

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
you know, At the price of systems

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000
it's like several thousand...

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
over a hundred dollars more than what it is in other places.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Yeah, apparently the fees are really high.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
I'm hearing they have a lot of problems

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
with the digital distribution network there, too.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Like, it doesn't work with any of the banks

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
in Brazil.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
So, I guess, like, there's no eShop content

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
like at all in Brazil.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Which, you know, is a huge source of money

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
for Nintendo, probably even more so

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
in other territories.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Where it might be harder to just walk into a GameStop

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
and get a game.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
So, that's probably another strike

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
against why Nintendo is ceasing

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
operations in Brazil.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
I would love to hear, you know, I know we have listeners throughout the world

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
so, you know, it's hard for us to sit here

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
and comment what's going on in another country

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
but if you happen to be in Brazil

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
and have any insight on this, let us know.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Because I know we used to have a guy in Argentina

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
and in Chile that listened.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
I think he's kind of moved on

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
to other things now, but I'm hoping maybe

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
we've got some other people in South America

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
who might give some insight as to what's going on.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
So...

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Let's see, looking in our chatroom

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
over at live.vognetwork.com

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Act F saying eShop isn't available in Brazil

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
as far as I know. Dungeon Buster says

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Brazil's tariffs are nuts.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Apparently on launch, a Playstation 4 was

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
$1800 because of taxes.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Yeah, it's a little nuts.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:33.000
It's not going to lead to good business in the country, that's for sure.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Alright, well let's move on to this.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
You know, this is kind of big news

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
and I'm not seeing a lot of people talk about this

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
but I think this is kind of big because you know

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
last year we had a lot of

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
run-ins with Let's Plays

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
and the legality of that

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
and what is acceptable on

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
YouTube and so forth. You might remember

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Nintendo got into a lot of these issues and so on.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Well Microsoft this week

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
coming out with kind of a clarification

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
on their policy on

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
how they view the Let's Plays

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
and the streams and all this other stuff.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
So with Microsoft's new policy

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
you will now have, if you're

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
a content creator such as me

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
or what have you, any of you other folks

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
that do Twitches or YouTubes, you have a

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
quote, personal, non-exclusive, non-

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
sub-licensable, non-transferable,

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
revocable, limited license to use

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
things like gameplay footage, screenshots

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
and music. But as long

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
as you don't

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
do any, you know, you can't

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
promote bad things

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
in your stream like piracy and all that stuff

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
and do offensive content.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Also what else is interesting

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
is that you are not able to

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
profit off the content created

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
except for

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
YouTube and Twitch ads

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
which is the most common

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
way that folks are making money off of it.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
So I'm assuming what they don't

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
want you to make money off of is more like the

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
you know, whatever the product placement or other

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
other things outside of the ads

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
that you may come across.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
You can't sell or otherwise

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
earn any compensation from your item

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
including through advertisements in the item.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
You can't charge money in exchange

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
for your item posted on a site that requires

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
a subscription or other fees to view

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
the item or posted on a page

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
you use to sell other items or services

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
even if they have nothing to do with the

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
game content or Microsoft. You also

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
can't use game content in an

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
app that you sell in an app store which

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
makes it so like if you're a let's play

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
you can't make an app that

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
is all your content on iOS and make

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
money off that if it's Microsoft stuff.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
But you are able to do YouTube

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
and Twitch which is kind of the most common thing

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
that most people are into as well.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Now even though this is for

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Microsoft Studios and the things that

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
are Microsoft, it does

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
exclude Minecraft because

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Mojang does their own thing

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
even though there was the purchase

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
with Microsoft buying them

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Minecraft has their own set of rules

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
from 2013 that are still in effect.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
And if you are curious

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Red vs. Blue which is created by

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Rooster Teeth, they have a separate agreement

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
with Microsoft that is

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
between them.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
There you go. If you're

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
curious for more information about how that

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
all works, xbox.com

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
slash en dash us

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
slash developers slash rules

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
or I'm sure if you Google

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Xbox game content usage rules

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
I'm sure you can find much more

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
about this. So there you go.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
What do you think about that? What do you think about Microsoft's

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
rules? It's

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
nice that they put it out there so that

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
at least there's something that

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
say there ever was a copyright

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
strike you'd be like

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
refer to this type of thing.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Kind of

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
like how they have with Minecraft.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
But

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
I don't know. I think it's fair.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
I don't see that. I don't think that's

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
a really bad thing and I think Nintendo

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
they had something where it was kind of

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
hey, do what you want now.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
I mean, at least

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
it's tricky. Like where is

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
the balance? Where is the balance with this stuff?

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
And I think they're trying to find a decent balance

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
between like okay, you can make a little

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
bit of money off of it but you can't be like

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
keeping things behind locked doors and

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
selling subscriptions of stuff that's based off

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
things we made. But a little light

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
ad revenue like the YouTube and Twitch stuff

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
is okay and I think

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
I think that's as close of a

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
compromise that's fair as we're probably going to

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
see for a long time. And

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
as a content creator I'm kind of okay with

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
that because I've been having to do a lot of thinking about this.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
You know, yeah, game makers

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
they make

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
these videos

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
without it you wouldn't have the videos

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
so they kind of, you know, they do deserve

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
a little bit of it.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
And I have seen other

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
let's plays that are nothing

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
but captures from the game.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
And I'm kind of always like

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
well, when you're making money off that

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
but the people

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
that do the commentary and the jokes

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
and have a little more, you know, with it

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
okay, then you're at least adding something

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
to it, you're making it a little more Mystery Science

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Theater or whatever. There should

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
be, you know, a little room for you to

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
make some money off that.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Just to pay to keep it going

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
if nothing else. Pay for your time.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Which I can

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
assure you, creating content as I have on YouTube

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
I'm not even getting that much. I think I've made

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
be made in all, off all the

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
videos I've done in the past year, I think I've made

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
a dollar. I think I've made a dollar.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
I've gotten one check from Google.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Have you really? How much?

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
Well, the minimum is a hundred bucks.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
What? How'd you get a hundred bucks?

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
What are you doing that I'm not doing?

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
I'm not doing anything. Well, aside from

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
I just did a few

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
videos, mainly

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
the one that had the most revenue

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
was I did a thing on how to

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
side load stuff for the Ouya

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
and so that video keeps getting watched.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
And then there was one that was like

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
I had one that got Disney Infinity

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
early and I kind of did like a

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
real quick unboxing

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
type thing. But that's it. I mean that's

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
really all I've done. But it's just that

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
those videos are out there. None of my stuff really has gone viral.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
I think the video I have with the most views is like

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
I have a Diablo 3

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
barbarian video

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
that I just randomly did and for some

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
reason that has more views than anything else I've done.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Some wacky reason. I don't

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
like really keep track

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
of that very much but like

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
I'm gonna see

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
I'm trying to see what my AdSense is back

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
up to again cause

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
it takes a long time for it to get paid out

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
especially since I don't

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
put any of my videos.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Someday I will but it's just I don't have time.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
What do we got here?

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Oh, hey!

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
That's not bad.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Yeah, so the last time it was like

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
$111 and I got $61

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
sitting there.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
They're not gonna send me a paycheck.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Woo!

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Yeah, you know when they paid me out the $111?

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
That was back in 2013.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Okay, so I'm

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
it's not like I'm

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
making a ton of money off of this like

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
over the course of a few years.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Hey, extra money is money.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
So, can not do it.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
Even the official

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Playstation account actually tweeted out

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
cause I got on that SharePlay thing

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
right when it first came out and I had a Final Fantasy 14

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
video and Playstation saw it and tweeted it

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
and even my Diablo 3 video

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
had more views than that.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Which kind of surprised me.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
I thought the Final Fantasy one would be the most popular.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
I'm not sure I have that one monetized.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
I don't monetize all my stuff by default.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Just the stuff that I'm pretty sure

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
there's studio clearance on.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
I usually use that Let's Play.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
There's like a wiki out there that shows which creators

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
are okay with it and which aren't.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
I haven't really put anything up that's worth

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
something like that would actually be good to

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
repost like in a comment section.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Yeah.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
It's okay per here.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Not that that always

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
helps on YouTube cause they

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
pulled my

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
video on Super Hexagon

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
even though it's pretty clear

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
they're fine with the

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Let's Play monetization.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Alright, let's move on.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
DarkSakura, I think we're over to you.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Yes, I believe so.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Well, I have to

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
say that I was right.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
The real Shepard was

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
always a lady.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Actually, as it was

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
stated from the developer

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
Jonathan Cooper who

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
was the

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
I believe the one that did the first

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
animation test for what would become

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Commander Shepard used a female

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
model. Very clearly a female

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
model. Actually something

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
pulled from

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
a previous game but it

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
was what began and in fact

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
I watched the little running animation very

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
clearly female. But it

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
was a motion capture

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
taken from the game Jade Empire

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
of a female character and that's what became

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
Commander Shepard.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
I mean, they always had

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
the intention of letting you choose

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
but she started

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
life that way.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
I realized

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
that for some people FemShep

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
is the only Shep in Headcanon

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
although I certainly appreciate

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
the fact that I can have man on man

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
Shep. That's my

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
personal thing. But it's

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
interesting though that sometimes characters may

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
start one way and they completely change

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
when they're in development which I don't think it's

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
fair to say in this scenario anything necessarily

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
changed. But I do know

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
one that I had come across not that long ago

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
since I was getting really back into Final Fantasy 13

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
because of the PC release

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
Fang, who's my favorite character in the game

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
started as a male

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
and was

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
originally a male character

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
that was going to be

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
the character of Fang.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
And somewhere along the line

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Fang changed to a female

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
and I really can't picture it any other way.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Fang is just a badass chick

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
my favorite character by far

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
in that game. I don't know

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
I have a hard time picturing it as male although I go

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
that would make an awesome gender swap

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
cosplay.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
Why can't we have German Shepherd Shepard?

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
I want German Shepherd Shepard

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
because I think that would be awesome.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Only out of Silent Hill, the dog ending

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
except it's not the dog ending

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
it's the whole game.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Well my femshep was Sherry Shepherd

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
so

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
as seen on the view

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
maybe Sybil Shepherd

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Shepard's pie

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
Dark Soccer isn't speaking

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
but she has a look on her face that basically says

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
please stop

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
which means we have to keep going

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
I will stuff you in an anatomic body.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Yeah by the way what she's not

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
saying but I'm not gonna promise that

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
I won't murder everybody after that.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
She's been spending the last hour of the

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
show on the Five Nights at Freddy's

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Wiki ever since I brought it up in part A

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
she's been reading. I didn't make it that

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
far into just because I got

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
motion sick every time Foxy would

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
run because

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
I didn't pay enough attention to the diva.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
If you don't pay enough attention

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
to Foxy, Foxy

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
will run at you and if you don't slam the door like

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
immediately you will die.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
With that

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
mouth.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
The little noise they make.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
Foxy got me with one

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
percent of my battery left by the way.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
Well because he also drains your battery if he

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
touches your door. He goes to your door

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
he'll drain one percent then six percent then

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
eleven. Oh geez. Yeah if

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
you let it happen so he'll actually drain your battery.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
But what was I gonna

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
say? Did you ever get the

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Golden Freddy? No I didn't survive

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
that far. I did get the Golden Freddy on my second

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
playthrough. Oh wow. And

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
you hear this giggling if you look at the

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
poster. And that's actually

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
slowed down for their regular laugh.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
So ugh creepy. Anyway sorry.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Mass Effect.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Unless we get a Five Nights at Shepherds

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
crossover maybe. Who knows.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
I can't

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
just imagine that. But it's

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
the Volus that slowly

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
runs. Waddling

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
toward you.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Going.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
That breathing noise.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
This one needs to die.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
That's a Hanar. Oh my god

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
the Hanar would be Chica.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Alright anyway.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Let's see we got some

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
more stories here Loki.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Alright. Sorry I was being distracted

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
by German Shepherd again.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
So Nintendo

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
talk about

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
the change of heart. You remember

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Nintendo at one time was kind of

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
barring the use of Smash

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Brothers in fighting game tournaments and stuff.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
And now they're supporting

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
and sponsoring Apex 2015.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
That's going to include

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
different games including

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Ultra Street Fighter 4

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Smash Brothers

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
Pokemon. And

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
it's pretty awesome. The tournament is going to run from

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
January 30th through February

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
1st 2015.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
In New Jersey.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
And they're also going to stream it on Twitch.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
So.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Cool.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
That's probably a pretty awesome sponsor.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
That's quite the turn around for Nintendo.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
I guess they listen to feedback.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
A lot of feedback.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Yeah these type of things help

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
promote your game.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
You should let people do that.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Alright.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Let's see moving on.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Speaking of Nintendo. Those GameCube

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
adapters highly sought after

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
devices and I'm surprised it took this

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
long for us to be talking about a

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
third party GameCube adapter.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
And now even though

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
the official GameCube adapter

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
has not been discontinued

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
good luck freaking finding it anywhere.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
It's not really showing up anywhere.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
So third parties have

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
come in to fill in the gap

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
about the

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
GameCube adapters and

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Mayflash is the company that's putting one of these together.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
A GameCube controller adapter.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
You can get it for $20.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
It's available on PlayAsia but

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
I'm sure there's some other websites as well.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
What happens, this is

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
very similar to the Nintendo GameCube

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
adapter but shaped a

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
little differently and there's a switch on the side

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
to let you swap between Wii U

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
and PC. That's kind of

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
cool. So you can actually use

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
your GameCube controller on the PC

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
with that which

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
could be pretty cool for playing some of your Steam Library

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
games. So.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
Now granted nobody's gotten their hands on this

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
yet so we don't know if it's

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
as responsive and so forth but

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
I mean this is a pretty hard thing to

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
screw up, right?

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
You would say that. It shouldn't be that

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
hard to just turn wires

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
into other wires.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
Right? Well it's not as simple

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
as that but yeah.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
Let's see, Rama says at least

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
these third party ones are PC compatible.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
Hitstun says that Mayflash

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
adapter is not bad. But

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
Kaijuto says, I don't do third party

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
electronics. Fuck that. And I can

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
understand where some people want to keep it

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
you know, with the official stuff

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
because Nintendo ain't going to support one of these

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
if your system gets all screwed up because

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
of it. As

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
little complicated as I believe these

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
devices to be but it makes sense.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
So. Well hopefully

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Nintendo will, I mean, I

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
I don't understand the way they work sometimes

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
is that they really thrive on this hard to

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
get shit and it's getting old.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
It's getting old, it's getting frustrating.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Sometimes it's hard to love you Nintendo. Sometimes

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
it's really hard. Really hard.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
I already told you I'm over this amiibo

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
shit. I was at this point

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
where I was like, oh I gotta get Mega Man. I really

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
want to get Pit. No, I'm done.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
I'm over the amiibo shit. I'm over it.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
It's too much of a game.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
It's like if I give my

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
money I should be able to get, it's just

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
what a mess.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
Anyway, let's get into

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
the mailbag and the game of

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
reading your emails because you send them to us

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
every week.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
participate by sending us an email.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
Dark Soccer is going to dive into the mailbag

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
over at ParticipateAtOrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
and read whatever

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
emails may be awaiting us tonight.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
All one of them. All one of them.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
Save

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
this for a show with a light

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
mailbag as the scenario

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
is a little lengthy and particularly

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
weird while you have good timing.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Yes you do. Maybe I'm obsessed with survival

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
type games but here's an obviously

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
hypothetical situation for you.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
None of you know each other yet and do not have

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
the families you currently have

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
and you happen to be

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
most comfortable sleeping unclothed.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
What?

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
You just get home at night, play some games

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
watch some TV, have dinner, then throw

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
all your clothes in the hamper or washing machine

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
take off any watches and jewelry and drift off

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
to sleep only in your bedsheets.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
What?

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
One comfortably warm spring night you

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
turn in and in the morning

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
or what you judge to be morning

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
you wake up in an unfamiliar place still naked

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
apparently nowhere near any known civilization.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
Neither alcohol nor medication

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
are involved. Nonetheless you have no idea

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
where you are or how you got there.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
You wake up to one of three

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
scenarios. One you are in the middle

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
of the massive grassy field. There's nothing

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
as far as you can see except for gently rolling

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
hills of dirt and grass

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
spotted by dandelions and maybe some loose

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
stones. There don't seem to be any type of

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
wildlife around but there might be burrows

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
or shallow dens in the soil.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
What?

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
Two. You have a very active imagination

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
my friend.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Two. You are in a surprisingly dense

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
forest with tall trees partially

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
obscuring the sunlight. You can hear birds

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
in the trees and little else. Nobody's

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
expecting

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
you to be able to tear trees down with your

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
hands but branches, leaves and possibly

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
fruits are accessible just

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
pretty high out of your immediate reach

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
save of course what's fallen on the forest floor.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
What?

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
Guys you know when chat says is this an email

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
or is this a perv sex

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
thing? Three.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
You wake up on the

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
main floor of a long abandoned mid-sized

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
suburban house with the windows and doors

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
boarded from the outside. There's no

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
electricity, water or gas and what furniture

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
is left is deteriorated but somewhat usable.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
The stairs to the basement

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
have collapsed and you cannot see what is down there

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
but you know you are there alone.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
All you can see between the boards over

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
the windows is a grassy field to the east

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
and a dense forest to the west.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Given what you know from gaming

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
TV and most importantly reality

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
which scenario would each of

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
you prefer to be in and why?

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
What?

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
And only

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
slightly disturbed Robert

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
M. This okay this is no no

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
I'm not even this is what you need to do Robert

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
M. like seriously you need to go download

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
Twine and start your text adventure

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
game because you've got a script

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
going here you clearly have an

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
active imagination for this stuff

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
just go make your game why didn't you

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
did you send in something for the game jam I don't think you did

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
so now's the time to start. Now

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
that Rob's tirade is over I have an answer. What was number two

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
again? I wasn't. That was being in the

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
dense forest. That's not my tirade

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
I'm not saying like I'm not like

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
anti this but I'm just saying you

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
go go I would vote for number two

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
if it were me. Okay. Because

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
in a forest where

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
you can hear wildlife you have the

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
potential if you need to make something to protect

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
yourself you can

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
find leaves

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
or you know

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
you can make shelter

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
in the woods you can find food

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
but it is much easier to find. In scenario

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
three you are in a shelter already it's

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
like fuck I don't have to make a shelter done

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
but you don't have food

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
yeah but you can go outside and

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
I gotta say I'm for scenario

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
one because it sounds like TLC

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
is naked and afraid which by the way

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
which by the way

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
the Golden Globes

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
were at the competition tonight

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
tonight was the gay Mormon show on

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
TLC that was tonight

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
oh my god

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
that just pisses me off. No it looks

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
you know what there comes a point where you go this just looks like

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
a fucking train wreck I have to see it. That is naked and afraid

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
what you've never heard of naked and afraid

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
oh my god

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
well thank you emailer now I can explain

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
to Loki what naked and afraid is all about

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
I'm going back to the wiki

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
there's a show on TV

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
and this show should be mixed with Five Nights at Freddy's

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
quite honestly no there's a show

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
where they take two people

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
and they're naked in the middle

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
of nowhere and yes they film it

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
they use the blur boxes right so you don't see nothing

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
you can't see on basic cable and

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
they just they have to survive for like I think it's

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
like three days or something like that out in the wilderness

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
and you know you watch

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
them go crazy and they're afraid of all

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
the sounds they hear out in the wilderness which is probably

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
just the camera man and all that

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
that's the show that is seriously a dumb ass

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
show that might be on

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
Discovery Channel not TLC maybe somebody

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
will correct me in chat well I'm glad that this is the new discovery

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
where they don't make up shit anymore

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
ha ha ha ha

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
discovered our lies

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
oh no

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
now the chat room is just

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
going off on this email take it as a compliment

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
though Robert M let's see

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
actdeft says Five Nights

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
Five Nights at Robert M's

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
let's see

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
says this guy is like a porn version of saw

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
SSG 100 Matt says

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
this feels like an SAT question

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
and fifth dream says PT

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
the email

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
you are standing in front of a house there is a

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
mailbox here

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
PS you're naked

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
I'm sorry it would be even freakier

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
though is it if you like went to bed like

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
you normally do like in pajamas

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
or whatever you wear to bed

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
and then just we're naked anyway

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
that would be freakier

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
hello is this a sex dream

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
hello

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
where's my hot person to bang

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
where are they

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
um

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
you know what Robert M it sounds

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
like you're really going to have to go with your gut

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
because literally each one of us voted for a different answer

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
so you're really going to have to just kind of go with your gut

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
and maybe make all three of your

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
interesting scenarios

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
but the way that he described them

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
they technically should be in the same universe

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
so you get a random scenario with each awakening

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
because the house seems like

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
it's stuck between the edge of the forest

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
and the field

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
so I think it's the same location

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
just different parts of it

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
but I'm still naked right

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
sexy times

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
la la la

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
la la

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
la la la

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
is Zachary Quinto there is he naked

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
did you know that toy chica

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
is really weird looking

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
alright

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
act deaf

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
act deaf in chat says

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
press x to call for sex

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
uh fifth dream says

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
this is me three nights a month go to bed clothed

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
wake up at least half naked

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
well that sounds like another scenario for a game

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
where did my pants go

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
that sounds

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
like an oh well our dream game in the making

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
where did my pants go

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000

naked and afraid of the game but there's spaceships

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
science

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000

you wake up next to a donkey with no pants

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
well I would be

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
disturbed if I woke up to a donkey

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
wearing pants so I guess that's

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
I can't really complain

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
my super busy week

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
but I am thankful

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
for this upcoming weekend I'm going to have the best

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
there it is FU of the week

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
just a couple more stories

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
for you guys and then the phone call

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
time 1877 game OLR

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
or our username on skype

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
orange lounge radio but first lowkey

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
alright so layoffs

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
have hit Codemasters they're saying it's part of

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
their strategic realignment

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
with I don't know what exactly that means

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
making more

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
racing games is that part of the alignment

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
because that's what they're great at

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
but yeah small number

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
of roles have been proposed as being

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
a risk of redundancy so they

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
are removing that redundancy

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
they've cut 30 jobs

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
well

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
that's a shitty way to start off the new year

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
talking about layoffs already

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
unfortunately

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
this is also a common time for that to happen

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
yeah and at the same time while it is

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
unfortunate that they're cutting

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
jobs if you have jobs that are redundant

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
at your company maybe sometimes

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
it's

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
you're paying people to work

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
and if they're not

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
working as hard as they could be

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
maybe

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
slim your company down

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
make it more profitable

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
fifth dream in chat says that means

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
we fired people because we needed money

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
that's a

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
well I mean I don't know

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
they put out some

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
decent racing games I just don't know if they're like

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
top top top tier

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
alright well I got news

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
well not really news more like rumors

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
on another popular game

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
series raise your hand if you like

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
C-man

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
raise your hand everybody do you like C-man

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
really Rob you do

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
I do I love C-man

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
it's a great game and of course

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
I'm talking about the Sega

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
created game from the

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
Dreamcast system which

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
we talked about many times on this show before

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
of course that's what I'm talking about

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
and let's say there's a lot of fans

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
of C-man out there on the internet

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
web including Devolver Digital

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
you know the indie publisher

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
Devolver Digital right

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
the CEO Fork Parker on

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
Twitter just basically told

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
Sega we want to make a new game

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
in the series and then went directly

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
to the creator of C-man

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
saying we want to

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
do this and

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
apparently the creator replied

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
asking about formats

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
so this shows that

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
maybe there's a chance

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
I would love to see them have it

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
honestly because

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
Devolver is awesome so

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
I'm all down for that

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
I love this because Fork actually went to

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
Utsido and said hi if you still

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
own the rights to C-man then let's make a new one

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
and Utsido replied and said

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
hi for smartphone and

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
Fork Parker replied saying maybe PC and

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
smartphone so I thought it was interesting

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
for smartphone like maybe they're

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
already making one for smartphone who knows

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
so hmm

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
anyway

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
by the way if you didn't know and Dark

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
Sakura has surely covered this in a previous classic

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
game of the week because we love this game but

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
in C-man you

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
had a microphone and you actually would

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
interact with the fish

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
with the dude's face on the screen that was

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Leonard Nimoy so I mean that

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
that alone was awesome right there that you

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
could talk to Leonard Nimoy and he would

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
say things that didn't make sense basically

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
so and they could friend his

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
butt and you could friend his butt like that one very

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
popular YouTube we played oh I don't even remember

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
the name of the guy who did that that was

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
one of my favorite YouTubes by the way

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
an official sequel was released for the

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
PlayStation 2 in 2007

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
in 2002 Nintendo was

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
apparently interested in resurrecting the series for

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
3DS but nothing ever came of that so

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
good luck Devolver Digital we hope you can do it

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
and spread C-man

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
all over the world that is

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
what we hope you guys are able to do

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
from all of us here at OLR

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
so

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
SSU100Matt is interested in this

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
only if Leonard Nimoy voices it apparently

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
over at live.vognetwork.com

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
let's see

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
and Kaijuto saying hopefully they can get

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
Leonard Nimoy that would be awesome

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
so

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
there you go let's open the phones

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
it's that time 1877 game

Orange Lounge Radio all one word

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
which you know they make Skype on like every

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
single device out there like your smartphone like if you don't

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
want to actually dial it up you could probably use

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
Skype to do it it is so easy to call our

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
damn show so if you want to

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
talk about anything we've talked about you want to talk about your love

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
of C-man or anything else that we've talked

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
about in the show tonight

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
you can certainly do so

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
let's do that oh we got some

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
calls coming in let's get to it

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
hello you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
this is Max hey Max how you doing

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
yeah I'm doing good

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
just

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
yeah just figured I'd call in

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
and see how this whole thing works

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
that was really fast I guess you guys have

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
probably been waiting longer than I could hear on the

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
on the stream there is a little bit of

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
a buffer but there's also a little trick too

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
where sometimes I open it up a little bit before

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
we're actually ready for the calls for just that reason

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
excellent excellent well what's on your mind

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
buddy not much

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
man it's been it's been a good show I

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
we we finished a

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
project for the for the bog jam

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
and that was a lot of fun and I

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
I've just been having a blast playing the entries

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
that have been rolling in so

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
so you've actually checked out some of the

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
entries that people were posting in the chat and so forth

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
see I've played none of them yet I'm gonna

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
wait and live stream it all but

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
is there any particular standouts

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
so far that you've noticed

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
I pretty much like everything that I've played so far

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
my my personal favorite right now

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
is a hitstunz game

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
skeleton hunter yeah

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
it just it just feels it felt so

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
much like when you it was

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
it it's like the perfect buggy

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
game it just felt so much like

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
you had just gone to a rental store in the

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
eighties and picked up the

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
NES cart that's not the right shape

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
you're like why is this the wrong shape and then you

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
you take it home and you you play through it anyway

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
even though it's terrible yeah what what what did

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
what did color dreams put out on the NES

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
this time it's

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
just it's just a it's just a platformer but like

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
like it it works like all the stuff

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
in the game works except for it also

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
there's a lot of things that that

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
you don't expect like you can stand on pretty much

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
anything including projectiles and they'll still hurt you

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
but you can just stand on them and and

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
like and there's

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
there's times when you can get to the edge of the

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
screen when you're not supposed to and it'll wrap

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
to the left hand side of the screen and you'll suddenly

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
be somewhere else and and and you

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
have to kind of like work through that stuff and there's

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
it's just it's just really great I really liked

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
it well I know he he was really gung-ho

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
about the idea right from he was there the night we

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
picked the thing in listless he was very excited

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
about it now we were we were

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
honored to have you guys from cooking with

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
unity participate not only that you

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
guys like taped the whole darn thing

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
so not only can we play your game we

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
can just watch you make it on

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
youtube yeah yeah we we we recorded

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
just shy of 12 hours

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
for the for the game and it was we showed

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
everything on the show except for one thing that we

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
kept as a surprise which was just which I'm

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
not going to say because I want you guys to play so

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
so a little little surprising can you give

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
us a brief overview of what your game's about

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
yeah yeah yeah what

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
we did is we made a

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
first person shooter just a really basic one

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
kind of doom style with like sprite characters

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
and stuff and then what we did

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
is we made it so that's not actually the game

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
the game is you have to find

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
bugs in the game and mark them

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
and so like the walls all

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
can randomly not work and so

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
if you find a wall that you can walk through you can

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
right click it and you'll mark it as a bug

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
and then like enemies can have the wrong

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
AIs and power ups can like

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
not power you up they can do the opposite

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
and so you have to find all the things that don't

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
work mark them and then complete the level and it

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
gives you a score out of what

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
bugs you found and what things you marked

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
erroneously so you basically made like

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
QA tester the game type of thing exactly

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
exactly wow that is so

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
clever I'm just I am really

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
blown away like that these

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
things we're talking about what you did

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
and what Hitstun did and what all our listeners

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
that are participating in this did I am just so

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
blown away by the mere fact that

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
this wouldn't exist if we

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
hadn't you know had the idea

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
so cool I'm glad you said the words

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
man just throw it out there

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
do more of these it's great so cool

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
well and there's still more to come too

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
I'm still very gung ho on completing

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
my own idea and I know there's others out there

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
that feel very similar I'm still gonna work on mine

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
I just I need to sleep cause I haven't

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
done that you know almost

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
in a few days and like I had to go to work

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
like early in the morning and work like a

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
nine hour day it's just it's about balance

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
I just have to like maybe I think

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
tomorrow I will just go to bed

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
early and then just kind of

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
sleep for a little bit well Max

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
we gotta say a big thank you to all you guys at Cookie

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
with Unity because that episode that

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
where we had you guys on we were talking about all that

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
that was really a huge motivator

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
and so I would argue that none of these games

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
would exist without that either so you

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
guys get a huge huge credit in

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
making this all happen well

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
thank you I think that's probably undeserved but thank you

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
I do think that just

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
you guys organizing this was awesome

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
and thank you for inviting me on the show like that came out of

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
nowhere and it was truly a pleasure

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
as far as the other two

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
games I just wanted to mention real quick

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
Umbria 4 I haven't played it much at all

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
but it's a text based adventure game and

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
I think I ate the first person I saw

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
and so I have to play more of that game

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
I just have to have enough time to dig into it

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
and I also want to try out VG War

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
just because it's a card game and I love card games

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
like it's literally a card game you print out it's awesome

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
that is so cool

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
that is so cool so

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
a bit of the inspiration

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
behind a lot of this is actually playing

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
the games you guys made I love how

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
full circle this is all coming this is so cool

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
so cool I'm loving it

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
alright well who

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
knows this may not be the last game jam we

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
do so we'll see

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
we'll see what happens in the coming months

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
I'm excited

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
yeah me too me too

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
anyway I'll let you get back to your

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
regular programming on the show

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
and yeah keep on keeping on

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
and yeah great show

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
well I look forward to continued episodes

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
of Cooking with Unity which of course our listeners

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
can check out at cookingwithunity.com

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
and was a huge part of me

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
learning Unity and even though I don't have

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
anything yet I will and it will be thanks to these

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
guys so gotta finish that game man

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
I'm gonna bug you about that alright you do

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
do that you should alright take care

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
you too bye

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
and also that's why it's a buggy game

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
it's a buggy game cause everyone's bugging me to

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
finish it and also since we're on the topic of

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
things that you know Max

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000

I do I do

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
no excuse on that

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
I really do I also need to play Grand Theft

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Auto 5 it's been a while so I said

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
I would get it when it comes out on Playstation 4 there's

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
been so much other stuff to catch up on but

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
you know the gaming time of year it's it's it's

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
now it's now it's a good time

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
now's a good time yeah I think I

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
but I also still need to play

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
Dragon Age Inquisition all the way

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000

hey our buddy out there in Vegas

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
Las Vegas where a lot of

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
stuff was happening at the end of last year

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
yeah yeah there was

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
yeah that the

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
game awards and the Sony

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
Playstation experience and now

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
well the CS just happened

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
so yeah huge events here

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
in Vegas oh it's

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
starting to become the same and then they always there's

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
always those rumors that E3 is gonna

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
move to Vegas although LA

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
LA is not gonna let that

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
happen without a huge fight so but

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
anyway but I digress

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
what's on your mind tonight buddy yeah

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
I just wanna talk a little bit more about

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
CES you know it's always you know

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
oh yeah CES of course

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
happening just this past week even though

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
usually not a lot of game content

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
out of CES but sometimes I mean

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
y'all know I still talk

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
about game room and that was something

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
that had come out of CES so sometimes you get a few things

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
here and there did you go and check it out

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
indeed indeed yeah I totally

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
checked it out and yeah

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
like it was interesting

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
cause the main theme I guess the main

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
trend this year was actually

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
VR gaming there was

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
quite a bit of demos

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
from a lot of the

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
companies kind of showing off their headsets

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
and they're

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
mobile they're like

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
forward walking things that you can

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
you know walk on while you

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
wear the headsets

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
what did you think did you actually get hands on

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
with like some of the big ones like the Oculus

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
or some of these other ones or what happened

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
no I didn't actually

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
get a chance to go hands on

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
there was a

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
there was only like one demo

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
for each of those

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
and there was a pretty huge line but

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
I watched a lot of people

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
play and you know

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
it was really

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
interesting though it was

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
so like the guy was

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
standing on this it was almost like

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
it looked like a treadmill

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
but it was like a stationary

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
platform

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
and the guy was wearing like really

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
like special shoes

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
that kind of like slide on it

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
this guy was at E3 too

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
they had like it looked like they were

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
actually at Kickstarter they were actually

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
in like the run and gun game like

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
they couldn't do demos

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
for us like with us in them because

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
of insurance purposes or whatever but I totally

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
know what you're talking about they were at E3 as well

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
oh okay okay yeah it was like the

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
the Virtuix Omni

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
or something something like that

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
I thought that was

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
kind of interesting I never saw the guy

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
like strafe left and right so I thought that was

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
interesting but yeah he was just kind of

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
doing his thing

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
it looked intense it looked like the

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
it looked like the gym of the future

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
it was an intense workout or as we always say

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
on OLR it's one step closer to the

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
holodeck

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
right right right

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
it was crazy

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
well you know Sony was there too

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
there wasn't you know it's not really

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
not too many games there

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
most of the time it's always like there are

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
other electronics but they were demoing

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
things like the order

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
1888 was like the main

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
thing they were they were demoing and

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
they had a few stations set up for

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
playstation now I guess

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
since they just announced their

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
their monthly

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
the subscription stuff right right right

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
right but yeah

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
it was other than that

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
the only

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
other gaming stuff

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
I thought was amusing

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
so you know

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
that shoe company

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
Skechers you probably

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
saw or you may have not seen that

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
news so they have these

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
shoes that like it's almost

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
like it's you know that

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
old like toy from

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
like the 80s Simon

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
yeah it's so

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
they put this like

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
contraption on their shoes and it's

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
called like the Skechers game

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
kicks and it's basically a giant

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Simon like

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
toy like on your

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
sneakers and so

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
it lights up and like you could

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
like sit down and like play Simon

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
I saw a picture

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
of that somewhere out there and I thought

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
that was crazy I didn't realize that was Skechers I wear

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
I actually enjoy like not to endorse a

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
product I'm not being paid to endorse but I will say

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
I do usually wear Skechers

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
shoes one of my favorite ones I'm wearing them right now

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
and Loki's wearing them right now so

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
the fact that they're putting out a pair that has

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
Simon on it's kind of dumb

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
it is kind of dumb

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
but you know what it's no dumber than

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
Pumps remember

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
that was really dumb

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
but you know what I totally want though

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
Nike Back to the Future shoes that are gonna

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
self lace yeah you know Pumps really

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
are stupid because they do awful things to your feet

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
and your posture just saying

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
don't wear the high heels I love those things

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
as a kid I love those Pumps

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
you missed the joke

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
put your hand over your head you might catch it

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
well I wore those Pumps

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
as a kid too but anyway

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
and I've seen you

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
trace across the stage in them too

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
that's right I wasn't the rock you

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
wore a picture show for how long? I think I've worn

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
a pair of Pumps in my life anyway

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000

happens when you call an OLR

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
I

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
expect nothing less

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000

because I'll have to go to Sony's event

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000

1877 Game OLR username on Skype is

lighting up a little or sorry the

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Skype was lighting up a little bit so we do have some time

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
for some more calls I will ask

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
Loki though if there's any other last minute stories he wants to

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
get to while we wait for the oh

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
since we talked about it earlier Puzzles and Dragons

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
they have a

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
statistic that they've exceeded

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
42 million downloads worldwide

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
worldwide wow so that was 6 million

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
in the US but 42 million worldwide

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
wow alright let's go to the phones hi you're on

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
OrangeLoungeRadio who's this hey this is

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
actdeaf actdeaf oh my god is that a fat

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
chocobo plushie you have right now yeah

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
it is that

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
is so cute where did you get that

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
I got it from Amazon

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
actually it's uh

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
it's kinda expensive it's like

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
$75 what

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
that's too much money is that

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
an official Square product or is that like a knock

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
off something no yeah it's official

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
huh well Rob

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
but it's only sold in Japan

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
so that's why it's so expensive because

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
it's also really big I want one

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
it's so cute yeah that's like as big

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
as like his face is as big as your face

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
that is yeah huge chocobo

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
alright that's adorable though I want to hug

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
it I'm hugging it you can't

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
see me but I'm hugging my computer screen right

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
now that fat chocobo is so adorable

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
alright well anyways

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
uh something related to

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
importing and especially because

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
of the of Nintendo

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
retiring the Wii U and its market

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
of Brazil

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
it's like already has been

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
said it's because of taxes and

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
import fees that's something

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
that I have talked about before

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
in OLR but still

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
it's something worth bringing up

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
again because

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
it's something really that

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
affects every single

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
gamer in Latin America

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
from Mexico to Argentina

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
so it's something that

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
that everyone in Latin America can

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
relate to Brazil so it's not

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
something that surprises

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
us even

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
for a company just

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
to say no we're not selling

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
our product there because it's

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
way too expensive especially with

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
Nintendo and their finances

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
right now so it's pretty obvious

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
right

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
we have heard the stories

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
of the PS4 selling for

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
way over like four times

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
the time

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
sorry the cost in the US

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
like here even

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
it basically costs not

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
double but

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
it costs at least half more

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
what it should cost in the

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
US well and you've talked about this before

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
on the show about like living in Mexico

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
you you know will

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
pay more just like in many

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
ways funny enough like your fat chocobo

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
that you have there is like even in the US

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
I'm gonna pay more money for that because

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
I have to get it from Japan so I gotta

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
pay those import fees and everybody

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
along the way from Square Enix

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
in Japan to me here in the States

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
everybody along the way that little fat chocobo

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
passes through is gonna want their cut

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
yeah exactly that's

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
the point I have the

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
the fortune

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
or the luck

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
sorry of living

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
next to the US

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
so I get my stuff delivered

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
in a PO box over there

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
in the border city next to us

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
but

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
so yeah I have the luck of that

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
but I have other friends

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
who live

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
live very

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
deep in the country or even

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
South American friends that

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
that have to pay import fees

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
so even if I had ordered

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
this like from eBay because

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
it's also there and have

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
send it directly

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
to Mexico I have to pay more

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
fees I have to pay a more

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
expensive shipping fee and even

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
import fees because of

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
how much it costs and the size

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
and the

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
sorry and the weight and all that

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
and it would have been way

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
more expensive to get it

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
now 5th Dream in chat is yelling

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
smuggler with little face there

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
but you know and I'm sure he's just teasing

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
but I mean don't aren't you

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
kinda left with no other choice

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
yeah it's basically that

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
or just pay way

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
more for it because it's really

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
it's really crazy how

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
how taxes work here

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
because for every single

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
thing you have to pay something more

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
almost so

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
for me to get something like this

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
I seriously have to

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
to do some loopholes

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
to the law to get it

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
so yeah well we have to pay taxes

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
too on everything we buy with the

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
sales tax usually unless I live

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
in Oregon or something but even then

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
something's being taxed be it income property

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
etc etc

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
but wow I mean yeah I mean

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
I know it's sometimes with the

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
trade and stuff it's very interesting

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
how that all works and complicated

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
you know and like you said

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
Mexico may have it a little

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
bit easier because of its closer proximity

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
to the US than a place like

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
Brazil but at the end of the day

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
it's still

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
the same is that there's all these taxes

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
and yeah crazy crazy

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
it is and

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
there are many people here that

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
that do a lot of stuff to get

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
like

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
video game things, anime

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
things just to

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
to

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
to maintain a hobby

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
it's really something you have to

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
be careful of

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
in terms of

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
expenses because

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
yeah you can pay probably

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
a lot cheaper price

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
than what you would pay in a regular

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
store here and I can

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
make many many examples

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
of it

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
but like I said especially with

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
this Chicago plush

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
I paid $75

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
which converted to

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
pesos it's something

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
around the 1000 pesos mark

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
but like I said

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
I would have paid probably

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
like 1500 pesos

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
1500 pesos

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
just to have it brought over

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
here directly

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
and especially because it would have

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
taken way longer and it's

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
like way

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
way more

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
of a hassle

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
I have the experience of a

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
beta memory card 64 gigabytes

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
that they don't sell in the

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
US

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
it took around two

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
months to get here

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
directly

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
yeah

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
well you know what

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
thank you I think this all serves

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
as a humble reminder is that gamers

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
are everywhere but access to

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
games a lot of times depends on

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
where you're fortunate enough to be

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
so a humble reminder

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
there that some people have to pay

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
a little more to play the games that some of us take

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
for granted thank gosh though for PC

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
and all that that PC and digital distribution

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
really cuts a lot out of it doesn't it

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
yeah and I have called

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
also about this on Steam

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
the Steam sells here the games

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
way cheaper than in the US

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
so well not all the

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
games but most games on Steam

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
so that helps a lot

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
but still building

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
a PC or buying PC parts here

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
it's expensive but in the long term

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
yeah it's way better you can't play Nintendo

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
games on PC well not legally

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
alright well you take

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
care Akdev thank you for the call appreciate the

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
new perspective

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
hey thanks for having me you're welcome

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
and that fat chocobo is so freaking cute

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
alright bye

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
if I didn't have a trip to Seattle

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
coming up this weekend I'd be checking my wallet right now

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
do I have $75 in the car

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
could I do it?

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
cause I kinda want it dark soccer I want that fat chocobo

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
if I buy one it's for me

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
can you buy two?

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
well you remember

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
you remember Julie had that

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
rappy oh yes I remember the rappy

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
she paid like $105

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
but rappies are really cute too

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
that's basically fantasy

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
star online's version of a fat chocobo in a way

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
in a way

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
anyway one more call for calls

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
1877 game OLR

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
username on skype orange lounge radio

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
we don't usually do more than three calls but

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
we have a little extra time on tonight's show just because the news

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
ran a little faster tonight isn't that weird

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
we had like literally no news the past couple weeks

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
we ran longer of course we had some list lists

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
and some other segments to fill time

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
but we will try to take a couple more calls

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
1877 game OLR username on skype orange lounge radio

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
Loki let me check in with you again

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
to see if you have any other last minute stories

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
no I don't have any last minute stories

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
I'm working on my game now

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
I guess we covered it all any progress on your game?

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
what are you working on right this minute what are you trying to do?

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
right this minute I'm trying to

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
set up something that

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
when I get on the starting line

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
in this one spot that it stops for a second so that I can do

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
a countdown and then it lets me go

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
so I'm trying to figure out how to turn off

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:34.000
the acceleration on my car script

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to cheat

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
by having it hold down the handbrake

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
so it can't move

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
because hey it works

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
but it's just

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
it's not exactly the way you should do it

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
alright well we have some stories sent to us

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
from folks on Twitter

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
I always love to hear from folks on Twitter

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
over at Twitter.com slash OLR

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
and Jason or username

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
I am Jason C. sent us a tweet

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
and the headline on this is

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
EB Games is removing all copies

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
of Elder Scrolls Online from stores

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
uh oh

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
Spaghetti-O although I believe this is Australia

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
but let me look

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
I'm looking at this story here

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
that says all copies of

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
Elder Scrolls Online including the prepaid cards

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
are to be sent back to the publisher

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
everything relating to the game

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
would be removed by January 13th

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
now they did issue an update to this

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
and EB Games said on their Facebook page

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
that this removal is part of a normal stock recall

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
which would

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
include numerous video games

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
so

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
the source apparently

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
had said that other titles mentioned in the list

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
are excess stock however

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
whereas Elder Scrolls Online was

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
all stock including the prepaid

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
cards you know what that normally means

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
because the last time I saw

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
something like that where they recalled the stock

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
it's because it's going free to play

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
it was DC Universe and you know

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
what else is very interesting

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
is on Hoard House this week

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
plug plug for my other show on Wednesdays

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
on Hoard House this week we talked about that they were

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
getting rid of the six month subscription plan

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
that was already

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
going away you could no longer get the six month

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
subscription plan and some folks were

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
taking that as a sign that the game was getting

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
ready for free to play

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
that's two

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
that's two signs now

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
just because that's what happened

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
last well with DC Universe

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
they recalled the stock they gave us

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
basically like a window of like

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
you have to return it by this date

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
but it was shortly

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
it was right after they announced it was going free to play

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
but if they're anticipating that it's going

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
free to play they may do the same thing

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
or just maybe it's just not

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
selling and they have an opportunity

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
to send it back and get

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
reimbursed for it because they're just not

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
selling copies

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
very interesting well thank you for the tip there

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
Jason it looks like those of you that have

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
wanted to play Elder Scrolls Online but didn't want to pay

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
to do it well you might get

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
your chance here coming soon we'll see

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
anyway since the Skype line isn't ringing again I think

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
everybody who wanted to get through did get through thank you

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
to those that called in if you think of something

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
after the fact you want to get in touch with us later

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
you can always tweet us twitter.com slash

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000

tell us how tell us how the

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
the game Mormon show went tonight or the golden

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
globes why not let us know

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
we'd prefer though if you keep

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
it about video games but I suppose anything

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
is going to turn into a tangent here on

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
olr but I think that's what you guys appreciate

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
don't play all the vogjam entries that's right

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
check out the vogjam entries if nothing

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
else there's uh now they're kind of a

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
little bit all over the place

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
so what we're going to do in the coming days at

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
vognetwork we're going to do an article

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
for the site that will summarize where you

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
can check them all out now some of them

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
are very easily accessible at vognetwork.com

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
they've been added to the arcade a couple

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
I know at least hitstun's game that

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
Max was talking about and Bobby

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
Blackwolf's game he participated too

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
uh I know at least those two are right

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
there on the vog website so very easy to

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
find uh the rest are there's a lot

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
of them plugged in the forums but we

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
will um have an article in this

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
coming week that will kind of compile everything

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
for you uh with one place to go

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
and then of course as I said I'm going to go through and play

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
them all at least the ones that I can stream

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
because I just realized I think one of the I think

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
one of the entries we got was a card game

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
so that might be a little harder to do

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
uh but well you never

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
I might be able to YouTube it

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
try to get dark soccer over

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
here we'll play a card game it'll be fun

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
we'll put it on YouTube

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
like the vogjam entry that's a card game

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000
that we got not a piece of meat

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
I mean like what? I'm kidding

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
anyway

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
um I want to thank you

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
and I gotta say there was a really really

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
kind one on iTunes this week

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
that was so awesome and I wish I had it

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
in front of me but of course now that I'm thinking

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
about it I don't have the review up in front of me

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
I'll see if I can get it while we're doing our

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
final thoughts here but yeah

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
I really appreciate that stuff and we all do

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
here at Orange Lawns Radio so even if

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
you know even if you've told

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
a friend or two about the show and you're still wondering

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
what you can do to help us out those

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
reviews and things go a long

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
long long way so we really appreciate it

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
whether it be on iTunes or Stitcher Radio

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
or wherever it is you heard

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
about Orange Lawns Radio that stuff really

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
helps out

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
we will not be here next

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
week reminder we're taking a little

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
holiday break a late holiday but we will

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
be back in two weeks live

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
when games are actually coming out again

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
and hopefully all of us here

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
in studio and all of you out there will get to play

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
some more games catch up on that

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
backlog and we'll really start to kick

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
off 2015 and hopefully you've all played

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
the VoG Jam games at that point we can talk about those

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
too in the meantime

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
since we're getting close to the end of the

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
show here it's time to go around and get everybody's

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
final thought for the night

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
Loki I know you're working hard over there on your game

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
but what is your final thought tonight?

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
I want an Oculus Rift

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
I'm looking at them on eBay

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
that still surprises me you haven't played one yet

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
yeah I understand

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
DK2 would be nice

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
S-E-R-E

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
