This week we catch up with the gaming news, including the announcement of the new Nintendo 3DS and cancellation of Majora's Mask bundles.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 584, January the 25th of 2015.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:52,000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts right over there, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I am trying to write fanfiction over here, Rob.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Are you writing fanfic during OLR?

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, I've been writing it actually during Bobby's show, and I was finishing up a thought.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, I'm sure he's thrilled to hear that his show is inspiring.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Fanfic, but it's not Bobby Blackwell fanfic, is it?

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
No, it's Dragon Age.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That would be a little weird if it was Bobby Blackwell fanfic.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Is it Bobby Blackwell playing Dragon Age fanfic?

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
No.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh, okay.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
No!

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Stop making it weird!

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No creepy closing pages now.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Now this isn't like, you know, some people, let's be real, DarkSakura.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Some people, when they hear fanfic, their mind instantly goes to slashfic or porn.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But are you writing porn?

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
No.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Okay, so you're writing things that are classy.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You have a little bit of a look on your face.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm actually very weirded out right now.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Oh, okay.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's tastefully done.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Oh, hi, TechMasterLoki, how are you?

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I have a mouthful of breadsticks.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Loki's writing his pizza fanfic over there.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
He's shoving stuff from a box into his face.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Okay, in all seriousness, obviously we poke fun a little bit because that's what we do

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
here at OLR, but what inspires you to write fanfic?

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Why do you do fanfic?

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I mean, because there are people that look at it and go, that's weird.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So what would you say to them?

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I more or less like to do it as a way to explore the characters.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's more of an expansion.

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Sometimes it's a way to get your headcanon out.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
In this case, it's more or less just a nagging thought that I wanted to get out of my head.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So it's kind of like one of those things where it's like, you know, the BioWare games, the

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
BioWare universe is very good at, you can do so many different things with your characters,

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
but at the end of the day, and any of you that have played a BioWare game are familiar

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
with this, you have your little circle and you can pick from what, three to six different

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
options.

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Well, what if the option you want isn't one of those things?

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You know, maybe you want to do something else.

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So this is kind of your way of getting that out of your system.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Kind of, kind of sort of.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's basically, and I was telling you this earlier, but basically my premise for this

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
is, you know, when you start Dragon Age Inquisition, you can get one of eight characters pretty

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
much.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Right.

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You know, four races, two genders.

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
In this case, I'm, you know, I did sort of a what if, you know, if one had, if all of

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
those characters had been there and only one of them made it to Inquisitor and the other

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
people still were there, you know, so it's sort of a what if.

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I was just sort of thinking, you know, I have, I love alternate universe stories and

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I love, you know, like time travel things.

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What if we changed this in the past?

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What if this happened?

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And so it's sort of like my back to the future meets Dragon Age, except no DeLorean.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Where do people come together to share all this stuff?

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I mean, obviously the internet, but what, what corner of the internet is this a forum?

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Is this, I mean, I'm not saying you have to like give your exact location, but it's fine.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Um, I post on, um, archive of our own or as people see at AO three.

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Um, some people use fanfiction.net.

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I used to, I wrote Digimon fanfiction years ago, by the way.

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Now that's creepy.

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
No, I'm kidding.

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm kidding.

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
No.

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Um, anyway, um, I, I dated a guy years and years and years ago.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm going to just, I'm going to keep it real.

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So like, I don't think what you do is strange at all because I used to date a guy years

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and years ago who wrote fanfiction or slash based on the television show popular, which

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I don't know if you ever saw this was on the WB.

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It was the guy who made Glee did this years ago.

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
He wrote like porny stories about the characters on that.

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So you know what?

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That kind of takes the cake in my opinion.

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
They exist.

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I mean, there's people who do, I mean, I've just never been comfortable writing it.

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I have written it before, never, never enjoyed it, you know, because I'm just not interested

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
in that kind of thing.

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But it hasn't stopped me from reading other people's work.

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Um, but no, um, there's people who, uh, post their stuff on Tumblr.

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
People posted on Facebook have whole communities over it.

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And for me, I'm writing more or less just for myself, but I am posting it.

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So, I mean, if anyone wants to read it, I, I'll link it to you.

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I don't care.

96
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Okay.

97
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Um, I'm going to check in with tech master Loki here in a minute, but I want to check

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
in with our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live at the voice of geeks

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
network, vognetwork.com every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern,

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
right after the Bobby black Wolf show and Bobby black will starting us off saying dark

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
soccer thinks I'm creepy frown.

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Uh, SSU 100.

103
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Matt says in my Bobby black will fanfiction.

104
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
He knows and likes watching hockey.

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
There you go.

106
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You can change things from what, uh, what they do there.

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Uh, let's see.

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
A fifth dream says I want to romance Varick.

109
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So I am assuming Varick is not to accept.

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I do like Bianca.

111
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So Varick is not a romanceable option in the game, right?

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So this is a way for people to kind of get that out of their head.

113
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
He's, he's got his sights set on the one who got away.

114
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I see.

115
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Gotcha.

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
All right.

117
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Well going over to tech master Loki.

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
How are you doing?

119
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Loki.

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Now I'm full.

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Now you're full.

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'll give you enough time to eat some pizza there and get caught up for the show.

123
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Right?

124
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes.

125
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Awesome.

126
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
How was, uh, how was your week off?

127
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You got, y'all know I went to Seattle, but what'd you guys do with your a night off?

128
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I had to go with the kids to my mother-in-law's house.

129
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You sound so thrilled about this.

130
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah, it was, it was thrilling.

131
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
All right.

132
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Did you get a chance to play any games or work on your own game or anything with the extra time?

133
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
No, I did that this week.

134
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I wasted a lot of time working on my game this week.

135
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Um, and I say wasted because I ended up working on trying to convert some scripts from JavaScript to C sharp.

136
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And then I realized once I got about eight hours in, I was like, wow, there's a really easy way to do what I wanted to do without having to convert all this stuff.

137
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So I just like threw it all away and I'm like, yep, that works.

138
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's like, dammit, if I had only realized this eight hours ago.

139
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So yeah, that's, that was my weekend.

140
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Bummer.

141
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So, um, I know you're, you're not the type that writes fan fiction online, but you know, Dara Sagar was talking about big forums.

142
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You've participated in some big forums as well, but things that have to do more with, I would imagine, uh, uh, like Grand Theft Auto hacking was one, right?

143
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Didn't you used to?

144
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
A long time ago I used to do stuff with, was it Seven Sins and stuff, but now I just, it's, I can't keep up with it.

145
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And you know, I don't really want to mess with it on, you know, Xbox now, like Grand Theft Auto five people like hack online and stuff.

146
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And it's not as fun.

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's the problem is because five and even like some of the expansions for four weren't exactly the same, like five, there's not really structured game, like multiplayer modes, I guess.

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's kind of just, eh, we'll wander around and do stuff.

149
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And you know, you may join up a mode or something like that with someone else, but it's not like, okay, I'm going to go into death match.

150
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm only going to play death match, that type of stuff.

151
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Or I'm only going to do races.

152
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I kind of like that.

153
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Or I wish there was, you know, both, you can do structured stuff and have not structured stuff, but that's kind of what I used to play.

154
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And so now I don't really play a lot of that.

155
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I think forums in general are a little bit of like a dying thing online a little bit because like, you know, we have forums over at vognetwork.com, but they're, they're a little tumbleweedy.

156
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I mean, some of the shows kind of post their weekly updates, which is really good to read, but you don't have like the abundance of conversation like you might see on some other things.

157
00:07:48,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And, you know, to be fair with, in the age of Facebook groups and Twitter and so forth, you know, a lot of, I think things have shifted to that where those sites have become the things that you check, you know, five times an hour.

158
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I think a lot of people have, have moved a lot of their things into that, unless it's something like really, really focused, like maybe what, you know, Jamie's talking about.

159
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm sure with these fanfic things as well, uh, you probably don't have room on Facebook for pages and pages.

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yeah, usually like if I read anything, I don't really participate in forums that much anymore.

161
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's more of like, you know, I'll read, I'll read everything.

162
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'll read even sites that, you know, I know are garbage, except for Polygon, I don't read that anymore, but I'll read like, I'll still browse Kotaku every now and then.

163
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Just for the hell of it. And sometimes I'll browse, you know, NeoGaf.

164
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
NeoGaf's a forum, sure, but NeoGaf's, NeoGaf's kind of its own little monster. I don't really consider that like a forum like others.

165
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Well, there's some things, some things are, it's not necessarily, yeah, I mean, sometimes it's like garbage, but sometimes it's just, you know, like they have, um, you know, kind of an indie game, you know, people that are working on indie games, posts that kind of sometimes, you know, regurgitates back to the top again.

166
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's all, see, like people are working on that kind of thing or, you know, I'll just like, sometimes I'll have like early shots of different games or like impressions and stuff.

167
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So usually that's what that's for. But, you know, um, occasionally I'll go back to Seven Sins.

168
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Um, usually for, not so much Grand Theft Auto hacking, but like I was going there, um, well actually Grand Theft Auto 5 related, I was trying to find a way to hack the money in single player because I don't want to, like I'm trying to wait for my money

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
that's supposed to come when it, because I preordered the game digitally and it still hasn't deposited into my game. I think it happens at a certain point in the game.

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Um, and I haven't gotten to that point yet. And so I was like, well, is there a way like kind of cheat just to get more money?

171
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Because I'm already 100% of this thing on Xbox 360 and I don't really want to grind at it to get more money and stuff on the PlayStation 4.

172
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I just want to kind of wipe through it really fast so I can get to, you know, the end game stuff or, you know, the Chiliad Mystery stuff, which I don't even know if there's actually anything to that.

173
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Um, I don't know.

174
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Well, let me read some comments from our chat room. We were talking about forums because since I mentioned the VoG forums and that not a lot of people are using that stuff, I'm noticing in chat here, uh, let's see, we got Tiger Claw saying, we need to post more in the VoG forum.

175
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And, uh, I usually post stuff in the VoG forum and SSG100Matt says, I posted a game completion challenge in the VoG forum.

176
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Hey, by all means, if you guys want to make the VoG forums a thing, I will join you. I'm happy to participate in some longer discussions on there. I think that'd be great.

177
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Don't let me discourage, please don't let me discourage you.

178
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:33,000
This is pretty tumble weenie that, uh, you know, out of my sheer laziness, I still haven't disabled yet. The Minecraft server.

179
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Oh, there you go. You can Renaissance all these things in 2015.

180
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:50,000
All right. I don't even know. Well, um, I'm going to move on here from the intros. Uh, we'll get to our gaming weeks a little later, but in just under 15 minutes, we're going to be talking to Eric, who is the head of Rockage San Jose.

181
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:00,000
We're going to be talking to him about this event, which is now what many are calling, cause this is an official magfest event. Now it's the, which happened this weekend on the East coast. This is now magfest West coast, essentially.

182
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So this is really cool. Um, I've heard, I, I, we, I know we have listeners to the show who are like just getting back from magfest tonight. Music and games fest, you know, they do a lot of like indie music bands, like, you know, things like mini bosses, you know, the mini bosses, they're going to be at this Rockage, you know, Mega Rand, you know, Mega Rand, he was on the show. He's going to be there too at Rockage. So this is going to be awesome.

183
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Uh, I'm hoping to check out the event myself. It's in two weeks. It's the weekend of the eighth. Um, so I'm hoping to get out there at least for a day myself because San Jose isn't too, too far away, but we'll be talking to Eric about that event.

184
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And I'm sure we'll get some calls later from some listeners who are at magfest on the East coast this week. So we're going to be talking a lot about music and games tonight, but that is just fine by me because you know what? I love both things, music and games. I'm pretty sure you guys love both things as well.

185
00:11:45,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So we'll be talking to him in about 15 minutes, but we were gone last week. Uh, we took the week off. I took a vacation with Alan. We went up to Seattle. I had a great time. I don't have a lot of like gaming things to report, except I did go to Gameworks, which if you've been to PAX prime, you know, Gameworks, cause it's right across the street from the convention center. And coincidentally I was staying in a hotel that was right near the convention center as well.

186
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Uh, so we headed over to Gameworks and I did get my fill of playing some pop and music and DDRX and X2 and see, there was even still a Derby owner's club machine up in the corner. And I, I thought of dark Sakura and some of the obscene things she used to name her horses.

187
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And you had Polteri.

188
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I did.

189
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You beat Polteri and made her sad.

190
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Which kind of isn't funny in retrospect, but it's, it was, it was kind of one of those inside jokes that you had to be there.

191
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I actually still have all my horses. I found magical sound.

192
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Oh, that's good.

193
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Who I finally retired. Remember?

194
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yes. So I should have picked it. I should have brought you back that one of those as a souvenir. I should have got a Derby owner's club horse and named it something offensive and said, Hey, this made me think of you, but Oh well, I didn't think of it.

195
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
All right. Anyway, uh, since we were gone last week, it's time to recap the news from last week.

196
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And how do we recap news on this show? By playing a very important song like Holic in the background.

197
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So it's time for last week's news set to Holic.

198
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Last week, Nintendo did a big direct on January 14th that really dominated the week in the news where they announced that yes, the new 3DS will be coming to America.

199
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I didn't know that would happen.

200
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's going to be coming on February 13th. The new 3DS will controversially not be coming with a charger.

201
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Uh, but the new 3DS will only be released in the XL version in the States, which is also ruffling a lot of feathers for those people who really wanted those exchangeable face plates.

202
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And the plates by their own rules.

203
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Also announced Puzzle and Dragons Super Mario edition is coming to the West as a double pack with the original Puzzle and Dragons Z.

204
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Uh, Nintendo also going to be making a new game in the Fire Emblem series.

205
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Uh, Xenoblade Chronicles coming out in the US in April.

206
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Uh, Mario Party 10 going to be coming out as well and it will have its own set of amiibo that come with that.

207
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But if you already have a Mario amiibo that you're using with Super Smash Brothers, you're going to have to get another one if you want to have also save data with Mario Party 10.

208
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Because guess what? Amiibos only hold save data for one game.

209
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Good thing you can get all these characters in different poses.

210
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Also, Rock Band DLC. There was new Rock Band DLC that released last week featuring Arctic Monkeys and Foo Fighters.

211
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The first release since American Pie was quote unquote the last piece of Rock Band DLC.

212
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
But hopefully this means a resurgence for the series very soon.

213
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So there it is, last week's news set to holla.

214
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Seriously, one game that's like, that's so forward thinking of you Nintendo. Like, god damn.

215
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Uh, yeah. I mean, I already told you, I'm over amiibo. I'm over it.

216
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Like, I see people on Twitter that are chasing down all the different ones and, you know, good for them.

217
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I am not one to knock how other people spend their money and if that is the thing you collect and you're happy about it.

218
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Hey, I got a collection of PES dispensers that people think is a waste of money. You have your amiibo and you rock on.

219
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
But I think, I'm just, I'm kind of over it. Like, I just, the more and more, they're harder to find.

220
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,000
The ones that you really want and they only will do the data for one game and now they're really milking it with more.

221
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's just, I'm over it. I'm done with the amiibo thing. I have my three, that's enough.

222
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So, so much for that theory that you'd be able to like, you know, train something on Smash Brothers and then go play like another game and have that amiibo be good at that game or something.

223
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Mhm.

224
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So, what's the point?

225
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Let's see, VX JasonXV in our chat room saying, people are surprised that amiibo only holds one game worth of data.

226
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Have you ever played an arcade game with a card system? Literally every NFC system uses one set of identifiers because there's no other way to do it.

227
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I get that, but I sort of feel like amiibos were maybe misrepresented a little bit.

228
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Like, and that may be true, I just, you know, or maybe I'm just an idiot, which is certainly possible.

229
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
But I really feel like I got the impression that your one amiibo was going to work in all these different games.

230
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And they work in Mario Part 8 and Hyrule Warriors because all it's doing is it's unlocking something and that's it.

231
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:17,000
There's no data going back and forth. So I kind of get why it's different, but I feel like because Nintendo set it up that way when they first announced it where they're like,

232
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
this one amiibo will work in all these games, that that was the expectation we were given.

233
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And I don't know, is it completely unrealistic to think that maybe you would have the option to have data on your GameCube or even be able to maybe transfer the data to the Wii U?

234
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's alright, it's essentially the same thing.

235
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Nah, it's just four of them duct taped together, right? No, but I'm thinking, everybody forgets this.

236
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The Wii controller has data storage in it because you can put your Wii in your Wii controller and take it from place to place.

237
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
That's right. What would be stopping you from putting amiibo data in those things?

238
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Oh, because they wouldn't be able to sell figures.

239
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yeah, exactly. I feel like there's a better way they can do it. I don't know. Anyway.

240
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Or like, here's another thing you could do. Say for example you have your amiibo figures that stick on a base, which I really think that any of these figures that come out should be fully poseable and stuff.

241
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But let's just say that you have this base that goes on there. Maybe sell a separate base for like two bucks or something that you could pop it on there.

242
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Okay, this one's for Mario Kart, this one's for Smash Brothers, and then that way you use the same amiibo and you don't have to buy another one.

243
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
But of course then they'll be selling two dollars worth of something instead of twelve dollars.

244
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
AkumaJP in chat says, I buy amiibo only as figures. It's so well done.

245
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You know what? That is as much as I do get. And I actually agree. They are very well made figures. I really like them.

246
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I just hate the whole beanie baby, crazy, if you want a Wii Fit trainer, good luck. You're going to have to pull some weaves in a Walmart parking lot in order to be able to get them.

247
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It's just, I can't with all that types of fighting. And the eBay scalpers and people jacking up the price, I just can't handle all that.

248
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Like I get that I can get a good chunk of them by walking into Target. I just walked into Target yesterday, I saw Kirby, I saw Luigi, I saw a bunch of cool ones.

249
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,000
But, you know, I kind of want a Wii Fit trainer and I kind of want Mega Man and Pac Man and I know all these ones are going to be crazy hard to find.

250
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,000
So, eh, I don't know. But anyway, I'm not hating on those of you that enjoy it and collect them. I'm just saying I'm over it and these are some of the reasons why.

251
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Let's see, looking at some other comments in chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

252
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Which, by the way, when we get Eric on the show here in a little bit, if you want to ask questions about Rockage San Jose, we will be taking live questions from our chat room.

253
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Again, that's over at live.vognetwork.com.

254
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Physics major in our chat, I hope I said that right, says, I'm only getting one more amiibo and that's the last one I'm getting.

255
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yeah, but that's how they get you. Just one more, just one more hit.

256
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And then they'll be like, oh, but we're releasing this figure that collectors everywhere are going to want to have.

257
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Alright, well I wanted to talk about this. What do you guys think about the new 3DS?

258
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Because I was lucky enough this week I got to actually play one from Japan.

259
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You know, our buddy Shane here at Orange Lawns Radio actually imported one from Japan and I kind of gave him shit for it because I'm like, why did you spend all that money?

260
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
But he made a good case. Shane can understand enough Japanese to be able to play some of the games.

261
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And he's like, I want to play Final Fantasy Explorers right now and I want to play Rhythm Heaven when it comes out.

262
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And I'm like, alright, you know what, you make a good case. If that's how you want to spend the money, you can get the new 3DS.

263
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I got this message from him at work, come over to my desk and see my new toy. Okay?

264
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
So you got to see one of these too. What did you think? What did you think of the new 3DS?

265
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It was the other day. It was alright, I actually didn't play with it but I held it for a little bit.

266
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It felt like a 3DS, just a little bit weird. The screen was a little weird.

267
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It doesn't feel that different from an XL to me at all.

268
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And I don't like the XLs that much.

269
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I love the XL and so the screen size and everything is good with me and I will say my favorite thing about the new 3DS is that head tracking 3D, it does work pretty well.

270
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And Shane even kept saying to me, why are you trying to break it? Because I kept tilting the 3DS.

271
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But I was like, I just want to check it out, like how this head tracking thing works.

272
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And it actually does work pretty well. So for those that don't know, it will actually kind of measure, like as you look to the left, it will kind of see that your head is moving to the left and it will shift the 3D appropriately and so forth.

273
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
This is the little fucker I've been playing.

274
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
That's a little Game Boy micro. Those things came and went real quick.

275
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Yeah, they did.

276
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Alright, anyway. But on the new 3DS, he let me play Final Fantasy Explorers.

277
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
So that was really cool to get a chance to finally play that, except it was all in Japanese so I had no idea what I was doing.

278
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So Shane kept telling me like, okay, use the L and then you can press a button to do an attack.

279
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So he's having to explain everything over my shoulder. I'm like, okay.

280
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
But I was using a little bit of that nub and that's what they added on the new 3DS.

281
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:05,000
There's a nub right above the buttons. It's a little nipple that you basically can go eeee and move the camera using the nub.

282
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The best comparison is if you ever used an old school laptop. In fact, I think a lot of laptops still have these.

283
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
They all have the nubs in the middle to use the mouse.

284
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Why?

285
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
That's what it is. That's what the new 3DS has for that second stick.

286
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And when I was hearing about this and stuff, I was like, oh, it's going to be like a full, just a tiny little thing like the guy on the left.

287
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
No, it's like a nub like an old mouse on a laptop. So it was kind of, I did not like the feel of it at all.

288
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
But Shane really loves it, which is good because it was his money and he bought it. So he has to really love it.

289
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
He likes to fondle the nub?

290
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
He did me a favor by coming over and bringing me that. So I'm not going to make fun of him live on air.

291
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
So, uh, yeah, that's, uh, that was, um, that was kind of weird to me.

292
00:21:49,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So the other thing with the new 3DS, and I'm trying to wrap this up because I want to move on to our call here in a minute, but with the new 3DS, I'm not totally convinced I need one.

293
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Because from a hardware perspective, although the head tracking is very cool, um, it's not enough to convince me to give up my Zelda 3DS that I have right now and plop $200 on the new 3DS.

294
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And my problem right now is that the games they've announced coming out for the new 3DS that you have to have a new 3DS for aren't really compelling right now.

295
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Uh, Final Fantasy Explorers, you can play that on a regular 3DS. You just won't have that second controller for a camera. You have to use the D-pad or something, which, you know, I'll get used to it.

296
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I didn't like using the nub anyway.

297
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You can even use the touch screen.

298
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Oh, can you? Oh.

299
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Yeah, because that was the thing is I heard someone complain about that. They're like, well, a third of the touch screen can be used as that, so.

300
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Well, that won't be so bad. That'll be cool.

301
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
So, uh, yeah, there's that.

302
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And, uh, Xenoblade, of course, is coming out on the new 3DS, but I kind of already played that on the Wii. Do I really need that on the new 3DS? I don't think so.

303
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:06,000
So, eh, I'm kind of, I'm kind of, I'm not feeling it right now, but here's the thing, here's the thing.

304
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Before you guys, because I know you Nintendo fanboys are passionate. I know you're going to write your hate mail to me right now. Hold on though, hold on.

305
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Here's the thing, because I know this is what will happen.

306
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
E3 this year, they're going to announce that game that I have to have that's going to be on the new 3DS.

307
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Be it a new 2D Metroid, or 2.5D Metroid, or a new F-Zero, or even hell, like a new Mario game that's really going on handheld.

308
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
There'll be something they're going to announce at E3, and I'm fully expecting that.

309
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
But what I'm hoping is that not only will they announce that game, but then there'll be, like, new colors and new, you know,

310
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:47,000
skews for the new 3DS that are even more interesting to me as well, because you know people went crazy about that Majora's Mask 3DS.

311
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And we'll have a new story on that a little bit later about just how crazy things are getting with that.

312
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Talking about the scarcity and the beady babies and all that.

313
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So, final thought from either of you guys before we move on here?

314
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I wouldn't buy it.

315
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
You wouldn't buy it? Why is that?

316
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Because if I'm going to buy a 3DS, you know, I don't like the fact that they keep updating the hardware on it.

317
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And it's going to get it to the point where you can't actually play certain games on it because it's only going to be so reported by the new hardware.

318
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
They did that with, like, the DSi and stuff. It's just, I don't want to mess with that.

319
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I want it just to come out, be around for a while, and then that's it.

320
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Then it just works instead of, you know, just, I don't know, having it where I have to constantly update my system.

321
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
And the fact that they're just so, you know, cocky enough about it.

322
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
They're like, well, that's why we didn't include a power, you know, supply there.

323
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It's because you guys are just going to upgrade your old ones because it's new and you'll buy whatever we put out.

324
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I mean, that's kind of an asshole move.

325
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
To be fair, though, you're not a really big handheld person right now, are you?

326
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Didn't you get rid of your Vita, and do you even really play your 3DS right now?

327
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I don't have a 3DS.

328
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Oh, you had a Japanese one, you sold that too, right?

329
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Yeah, I had a Japanese one, I sold that. I had an American one, I sold that.

330
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
So you don't even handheld game right now?

331
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Uh, no, yeah.

332
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
So in the interest of putting your opinion in context, you don't really play handheld games right now?

333
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Well, I like handheld games, it's just there's nothing I really want to play.

334
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And there's nothing that's justifying on, you know, why I need to have that system.

335
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Fair enough.

336
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
You put Minecraft on it.

337
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
That's all you need? You need Minecraft on it?

338
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
You don't know why. I almost bought Minecraft again on PlayStation 4, but I'm like, you know, what the hell am I doing?

339
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Why would I buy it on PlayStation 4? I don't fucking play it on PC.

340
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Alright. We're going to shift gears here quite a bit, because we're going to move on.

341
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It is about 6.30, and this is the time that we say we're going to get Erik on the line here.

342
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Erik is with the event Rockage 4.0.

343
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Rockage is being presented by MAGFest, or Music and Games Fest, and it's going to take place from February 6th through the 8th.

344
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,000
That's just in two weeks in San Jose at the San Jose State University Student Union Ballroom.

345
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And if you want to get more information on this event, you can check out rockagesj.com or magfest.org.

346
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
We're going to try to get Erik on the line right now. We're putting in his number and calling it up.

347
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Now, I believe Erik is at MAGFest that's going on this weekend, so I'm hoping he's in a good cell area and we'll be able to talk to him okay.

348
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
So, we're getting him on the line right now. The joys of live radio.

349
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Hey there, is this Erik?

350
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Live radio. How you doing?

351
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Hey, how you doing, Erik?

352
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I'm your Wii Fit trainer for ya.

353
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Oh, you must be listening to this show. You found an extra Wii Fit trainer for me?

354
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Yeah, I found it backstage here at MAGFest where I guess I'm talking to from here in National Harbor, Maryland.

355
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Oh my gosh. Well, I'm going to have to come to Rockage and pick up this Wii Fit trainer in person.

356
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I'm going to be really disappointed if it's not there. I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.

357
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
How are you doing? You're at MAGFest East right now. How's that going?

358
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:01,000
MAGFest East. I think it's just called MAGFest. I don't know if they're going to go with MAGFest East or MAGFest Prime.

359
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
It's great and I'm exhausted. It's amazing. You guys should all come here at some point in your life.

360
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
We actually had a few listeners that headed out to that event this weekend. Some of them are just now getting home.

361
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:19,000
And Rama in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com is saying people are starting to run out because of the snowstorm. Is that true?

362
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Apparently there's a blizzard coming and we're still going here. MAGFest goes until Monday night.

363
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
So we're going to have a party and some people are leaving now.

364
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
The party ain't over until y'all say it's over. That's how it was. Snow be damned, right?

365
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Right. No BlizzRaga 3 coming. It doesn't matter yet.

366
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Well stay safe out there my friend. We need you to get back here in a timely manner so that we know Rockage is going to go off without a hitch in February.

367
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Okay, so for those that don't know or haven't heard of this event, what is Rockage?

368
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:07,000
It's a three day celebration of indie music and retro gaming. So it's basically a music and gaming festival in San Jose at San Jose State University.

369
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Awesome. And it's taking place of course in two weeks, February 6th through the 8th. And people can get their tickets online right now, right?

370
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Yep, you can get them online. We have three day passes for sale. You can also get one day passes at the door.

371
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And we still have plenty of tickets left and we have 42 bands playing. 42!

372
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Oh my gosh! How do you go about finding 42 bands to play at your festival? That's got to be a crazy amount of organization. I mean, it takes a lot of work for me to get one guest on OLR. How do you have 42 people?

373
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I don't know. People figure it out. We've done this for four years. This is our fourth Rockage. And now that MagFest is involved, many other people and bands are finding out about it.

374
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:05,000
MagFest, they run Rockage now. When it used to just be me doing it, taking 11 months to plan, now it's a little bit easier with MagFest and their awesome help.

375
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Now this is kind of a new thing. Even though this is the fourth year of your event, Rockage 4.0, this MagFest relationship I believe is newer for you guys, right? How did that all come to be?

376
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Well, it's a long story, but the short story is that we've been buddies for a while and they want to expand to the West Coast.

377
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And they came to Rockage last year and helped me out. They all volunteered. And they loved it and they think it's got the same spirit that MagFest does.

378
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
MagFest is a music and gaming festival, if you guys don't know about that. I'm pretty sure that's pretty well known now, though.

379
00:29:46,000 --> 00:30:00,000
But yeah, they just like the idea of it and they see Rockage as an opportunity just to get their feet wet on the West Coast and eventually they're looking to start MagWest, which will be kind of a MagFest on the West Coast.

380
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Ah ha, so maybe me calling that MagFest East wasn't such a bad thing if that's where this is going. Let's see, the plot thickens.

381
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:20,000
So okay, so MagFest relationship aside, this is your fourth year of doing this event. So what are some ways that things have changed from year to year with your event?

382
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:31,000
So many things. We started off at a place called the San Jose Women's Club, so now we've got a bigger venue now.

383
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And we're at San Jose State University, so we're working with the college now. And again, MagFest's involvement means we can have bigger bands and bigger stage and all that stuff.

384
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And we have three stages, which is new to the whole event. We usually just have one. So we've expanded on that. We have a bunch of panels now, too.

385
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:59,000
And we actually have some composers coming from video game music as well, like Dale North, who's going to be hanging out and doing a panel.

386
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Yeah, so we've just expanded in every nerdy direction. We have a tabletop area now this year, too, and a karaoke lounge and things like that.

387
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Karaoke? Uh oh.

388
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Uh oh, karaoke. I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble if that's a thing. That sounds awesome. I'm looking forward to coming down there.

389
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I'm going to try to get down there at least for the day on Saturday and check that out, so I'm definitely looking forward to that to myself.

390
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
What are some of the bands I'm going to be seeing if I come down there for a day?

391
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Well, some of the bands that are playing at MagFest that I just saw the last couple days that are also playing Rockage.

392
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:45,000
One of the ones I should mention is a band called Bit Brigade. Are you familiar with that band and their whole thing? Their speedrunning game?

393
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
No, I have to admit I haven't heard of this.

394
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Alright, well, there's this band Bit Brigade. They're from Athens, Georgia, and they're a lead gamer.

395
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Instead of having a lead singer, they have a lead gamer. And Noah McCarthy is an amazing speedrunner, and he speedruns classic Nintendo games.

396
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And the rest of the band plays the exact soundtrack while he's speedrunning the game.

397
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:17,000
So every time he goes into a new stage or a new area and the music changes, they change the music right there and then.

398
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It can beat games like Zelda and Metroid and Castlevania and Contra really fast.

399
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
That sounds awesome.

400
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:34,000
They used to do something like that at the Video Games Live concert. I'm sure you've seen this at some point. They would do something like that.

401
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
But this sounds like that kind of turned up to 11. Something like that?

402
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I watched him do Metroid last night. Yeah, it's great. Really, it's amazing. It's almost like performance art.

403
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I watched them play Metroid last night. It'd be 10 minutes, and anything could happen.

404
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
And so he couldn't even have enough missiles to fight Mother Brain. We had to keep killing Metroid at the end.

405
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:02,000
And everyone was like getting squirmy and stuff, but finally he got his missiles replenished, and he took out Mother Brain.

406
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
But anything that he could have died, he could have fallen in the lava and got stuck or glitched out.

407
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
So it's kind of exciting to see him fighting with that.

408
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
You never know what's going to happen. That's why I like that.

409
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Bit Brigade will be doing Metroid on Saturday night at Rockage, and they'll be doing Zelda on Friday night.

410
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Oh my gosh, that's going to be a trip to see. I can't wait.

411
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
That sounds awesome. And actually, Bit Brigade's getting a lot of love in our chat room right now.

412
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
BlackWolf pointing out the Bit Brigade's from his area, and TigerClaw's saying,

413
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I've seen Bit Brigade performing at PAX last year on the livestream. They played Legend of Zelda music.

414
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
So it sounds like we're going to get a version of that at Rockage. That'll be awesome. But live and in person.

415
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:54,000
And some folks in chat kind of joking that at Rockage, there's not going to be a chance that we'll get snowed out in San Jose.

416
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
So if you're worried about that, that will not happen at Rockage. No snowing out there. That's good.

417
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Correct, yes. But we will be livestreaming Rockage as well. We'll tweet out the link or something.

418
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:18,000
So if those of you that can't make it all the way to San Jose, you'll be able to see that Zelda and Metroid speedrun each night by Bit Brigade, as well as the other 41 bands performing.

419
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
That is awesome. So you are going to stream this all live. Where should folks be following you on Twitter and online?

420
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Especially since we do have a worldwide audience, and I'm sure there's a lot of people that aren't going to be able to get to San Jose on two weeks notice. How can they follow you online?

421
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:45,000
On Twitter, it's just RockageSJ for San Jose. So RockageSJ. It's Rock with an A-G-E and an S-J. That's our Twitter. Or Facebook, it's just RockageSJ as well. Those are two good spots.

422
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Awesome. Well, speaking of our chat room, we want to invite some of our live listeners and participants to submit some questions.

423
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:58,000
If you guys have anything you want to know about Rockage or any questions in general for Eric, ask them in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

424
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:06,000
And we have a listener, Cecilla. I hope I'm saying this correct. I'm so sorry. Sometimes some of these names I don't see very often. I tend to butcher, so I'm sorry.

425
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Says, hey Eric, this is Cecilla from Pasadena. What should I expect as a newcomer to Rockage? That's a good question.

426
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Lots of music. Potentially lots of amazing burritos in San Jose if you haven't been to San Jose before. There's some amazing food around the area.

427
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:34,000
And yeah, a lot of retro games as well. For newcomers of Rockage, that's what you should expect.

428
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Awesome. Come for the games and the music. Stay for the burritos. I love it.

429
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I think we go hand in hand, yes.

430
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Going to our chat room, we have another live listener here. LockedOnGamer asked this question. I'm not sure if this is something you can really answer. Maybe a little taste here.

431
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Any chance MagFest could come to Canada? I don't know if you can speak on MagFest's behalf.

432
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Yeah, I don't know if I have the authority to approve that hearing right there now, but I'd love to try it, but I will bring it up to the gang. How about that?

433
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Thanks for asking that question though, because that is another thought that we have. What do you guys have going on in Canada? Do you guys have any stuff? There's no PAX in Canada yet, correct?

434
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Not yet. Not that I'm aware of.

435
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
There's got to be some stuff, some conventions and festivals.

436
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I know a lot of folks from Vancouver dipped down for PAX Prime, because that's not that far for them, but that's about the only thing I can think of. I can't think of a big, big gaming event.

437
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I know of a show, Video Game Realness, out in Toronto, and they cover a few things, but I can't think of any huge, huge expos I know of that I've heard in Toronto.

438
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:57,000
At least not yet. I'm sure there's some Toronto listener that's screaming their head off at me right now. I can barely keep tabs on things happening in my neighborhood. I'm so sorry.

439
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Let's see. Going to some other questions here in chat. C. Cilla with another good question here. C. Cilla from Pasadena says, what kind of panels should I expect at Rockage?

440
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:24,000
That's a good question. We have a couple of cool panels that are unique to Rockage. The Earthbound USA panel I recommend. Jeff Benson's making an Earthbound documentary.

441
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:35,000
He's going to be showing a trailer and doing a Q&A. That movie's going to come out next year, I believe. If you only see one panel, that's the one to see.

442
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:52,000
We also have a megathread panel. Shouts out to everyone listening from the megathread. That is the band Narboots, their own personal panel, which I don't even know. Last time they ended up feeding everyone narchos, which is an interesting concoction of itself.

443
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:00,000
So yeah, lots of music and gaming panels at Rockage. Earthbound USA would be the one to see, I think, if you only see one.

444
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Awesome. Well, Eric, I am looking forward to the event and I'm definitely going to dip down there and check it out for a day. Sadly, I can't stay the whole time because I've got to get back here and do another episode of OLR.

445
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
That's right, Sunday.

446
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:20,000
You've got me very, very interested in a lot of the stuff going on. I'll try to check out at least the livestream on Sunday, if nothing else, as I'm sure a lot of our listeners will be doing.

447
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
So one more time, how can folks get tickets to Rockage if they want to check it out?

448
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Okay, well, our website is rockagesj.com and we are also on Twitter at rockagesj.

449
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
And we're also on Facebook at rockagesj.

450
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Also through the magfest.org website. We're in the upper right hand corner, I believe.

451
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,000
And again, it's just 42 bands and this is something that I put together just because I love music and video games.

452
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And I think that it's something that people that even have just an interest in one or the other, they'll find that they collide on the dance floor.

453
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,000
So music and video games coexisting in a rock setting. Perfect.

454
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I love it.

455
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Thanks for having me on the show and I hope everyone does end up coming to Rockage because we have plenty of burritos for everyone.

456
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Well, if you're promising burritos, I have to accept.

457
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Hey, real quick, I got a couple other just quick, quick questions before I let you go because one more came in here in chat.

458
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I really like this question from Continuum Kingdom wants to know in our chat, how many people are you expecting at this event?

459
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
How many people are attending?

460
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Well, last year Rockage had around 1,000, but with the Magfest involvement, we're looking to definitely bring more folks.

461
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Just to compare, Magfest right now just hit 18,000 people in Maryland, where I am right now.

462
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Rockage is still a relatively newer event.

463
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And so we're looking at anywhere between 1,500 and 2,000 people.

464
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
That is nothing to blink at. That's a lot, a lot of people. That's amazing.

465
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Especially just for the fourth year of the event, that's a great pull.

466
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
And one more question for you because we always ask our guests on the show this question.

467
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I know you're busy being at Magfest right now, but I also know you're a gamer at heart.

468
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I mean, you do this because you love music and you love video games.

469
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
What video games are you playing right now?

470
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I'm terribly addicted to Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn. The new version of it is 2.0.

471
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I play on the Malboro server and the beginning of Rockage started as a link shell on Final Fantasy XI.

472
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
That was just a link shell and it became an idea that eventually we could have it in real life.

473
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
And then we started the festival known as Rockage now.

474
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
So there you go. There's your roots of Rockage and I'm playing Final Fantasy XIV now.

475
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
And I'm severely addicted.

476
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Eric, you have a lot in common with the hosts of OLR.

477
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Loki and I spent a lot of late nights, and Jamie, a lot of late nights on Final Fantasy XI.

478
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:53,000
And right now enjoying the Before the Fall patch on Midgarcimer, unfortunately, is the server I'm on.

479
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
But this patch is all about our server apparently.

480
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Yep, I went to FanFest a couple months back. I don't know if you guys got to go to that.

481
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Yes, I was there. I was there.

482
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
It was so much fun. I hope they do it every year.

483
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:17,000
And those of you that haven't given the 2.0 version of Final Fantasy XIV a try, it's a lot better than 1.0.

484
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
That's all I'll say.

485
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
So any chance we can see the primals at Rockage 5.0?

486
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Oh, I wish. I'll have Soken.

487
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
All right. Sounds good.

488
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
All right, Eric. I'm going to let you get back to MagFest. Thanks for taking some time out to talk to us.

489
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Get back to the fun going on out there in Maryland.

490
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Thanks so much for having me. See you guys around.

491
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
All right, take care. See you in a couple weeks. Bye.

492
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Bye.

493
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
All right, that was so awesome. Thank you, Eric, for joining.

494
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Who knew that Eric was a fellow Final Fantasy XIV addict?

495
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I feel redeemed in some ways from my own addiction to Final Fantasy XIV by hearing that I'm not alone.

496
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:00,000
That, you know, you can put together a ravingly successful, attended by possibly up to 2,000 people this year,

497
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
a festival about music and games, and still be addicted to Final Fantasy XIV.

498
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Again, if you want to check that out, RockageSJ is their name most places.

499
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
You want to check them out on Twitter, RockageSJ.com, which I think links to their Tumblr, which is RockageSJ.

500
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And yes, I'm going to try and get out there to the event myself next week, or sorry, two weeks, and check that out.

501
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,000
So, awesome. Thank you again, Eric, for your time, and best of luck with the event this week.

502
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
All right, we're going to move on for now into trying to cover some of the gaming news that happened this past week with you guys.

503
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Of course, don't go anywhere. If you want to continue to chat with us about the week's news,

504
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
and we will be taking your calls later on in the show over at 1-877-GAME-OLR,

505
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:47,000
or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word if you want to get us added before we get to the Skype calls later on in the show in about an hour and a half.

506
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:54,000
But we're going to get through our gaming weeks and what is happening around the world in gaming news.

507
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,000
To register participation for this week's episode of OrangeLoungeRadio at VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase CAKE.

508
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Let's start off with our gaming weeks, though, real quick and talk about the games that we have been playing this week. DarkSakura.

509
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:18,000
As I was leaving, I was downloading the demo for Monster Hunter 4 on DS. I've been playing a little Final Fantasy XIV.

510
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I am also on my second playthrough of Dragon Age Inquisition, and now there are mods I have been happily modding my game.

511
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I've also been playing The Legend of Zelda on the Game Boy Micro. I actually fished out the Micro because I was showing it to people at work, because they had never seen one.

512
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Well, the Micros kind of came and went. If you didn't buy one in the six months they were out, it was gone.

513
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And you remember how many E3s I took that thing with me, too.

514
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
So Nintendo has released a console with an interchangeable faceplate in the US before.

515
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Yes, it has.

516
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Yes, they have.

517
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I forgot about that.

518
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:09,000
But I've been playing a little bit of The Legend of Zelda on that one, and really just writing fan fiction since I got the writing bug. So that's it.

519
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Alrighty.

520
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And bejeweled.

521
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Of course. Can't do anything without a little bit of bejeweled here and there. Loki.

522
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I actually, I played games this week, so I finally Platinum Lego Marvel Super Heroes on PlayStation 4, so I don't play that anymore.

523
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Congrats!

524
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Thank God, because that game is so fucking buggy.

525
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Again, I have the most respect for, you know, Traveler Tales, but holy crap is that game really, like that is broken buggy in a lot of spots.

526
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
But you were determined to Platinum it, too.

527
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Oh yeah, I got it. But like that, like it was just, it's bad. Like I've been noticing, because Josh plays that game a lot, and I'll sit there and watch, I'm like holy crap, they just like didn't give a shit on a lot of this stuff.

528
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
And just said, ah fuck it, we're just throwing it together and getting it out the door.

529
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,000
It's pretty bad in some spots, but I finally finished it, so that's great.

530
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Then the other thing I wanted to check out was, you know, because as much as I hate the most recent Saints Row games, and I say hate in the most loving way, because I actually do like the series Saints Row, I just think it's gone in a direction that's, I don't know how they're going to recover from it.

531
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I mean, they do okay, but it's certainly not what the game used to be, you know, about like an ultra-violent, you know, gang that just like enacts revenge on people in the most violent ways.

532
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Now it's like some superhero crazy alien bullshit, I don't know what kind of game. It's still fun.

533
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:51,000
So I played God out of Hell, and kind of disappointed once again, it's kind of like how Saints Row 4 was, where Saints Row 4 seemed to be kind of rushed.

534
00:45:51,000 --> 00:46:04,000
It's just very haphazard, it's very like kind of, just like we didn't put a lot of effort into it, like Saints Row 4, they kept the same map pretty much as Saints Row 3, except they added some crap to it.

535
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:12,000
And at least God out of Hell has a brand new map, so props to them for that, and it runs great on the Playstation 4, but it's fucking short.

536
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Like I finished the game already, and I think in less than like four hours, and there's no rules, I mean there's a story to it, but there's no like, I can't just do missions, like usually you can do the story missions and kind of progress through that.

537
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:36,000
It's just, oh you do the activity stuff, and oh hey look, we're going to do a story mission now because you've completed X number of activities or whatever, and now we're doing the story mission.

538
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:44,000
And then all of a sudden it was like the end, and I'm like, that was it? Wow, okay, then you choose your ending, and it all kind of sucks, so whatever.

539
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:56,000
However, it did bring up an interesting idea, because they have like several different endings in there, one of which is like, oh here's possibly how we're going to reboot the series.

540
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:11,000
You know, basically at the end Johnny gets to make a deal with God, and he gets one of like a few different outcomes, and one of which is to retcon the whole series, and go back to the roots.

541
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:22,000
So that could still be canon if they ended up rebooting the series, but I don't know, at least his character's interesting, I think they've just gotten a little too silly.

542
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:31,000
And it just kind of, I don't know, it's entertaining but it's certainly not what the game series was, and I'm kind of interested to see where it's going to go from there.

543
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:41,000
That aside, since I've, I'm going to probably try to 100% the game since I'm already halfway there anyways after four hours, and that is a little disappointing even though the game was $20.

544
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:56,000
It's still, I don't know, I bought it with the, was it the Sings Row 4 remake that they did, and if it runs as well as it does on, you know, Gata Hell, I'm kind of interested in that because it runs way better than on my laptop, so that should be cool.

545
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:09,000
But they've had these like flash sales on PlayStation Network, and I have to say I'm starting this freedom like I do with Steam where there's shit on there like, ooh, it's only a few dollars, I'm going to buy that.

546
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:18,000
You know, like they had Shadow Warrior, the remake done by Devolver Digital, and that's like a $40 game back in October and it was four bucks.

547
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:28,000
And I was like, fuck, I can't, I can't pass that up, but I have it in Steam already, and it's starting to do like, ooh, Olly Olly, I'm going to pick that up for $3, or hey, ooh, there's this other game.

548
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,000
What was it, it was Strike Suit Zero, I think Strike Suit Zero is something like that, I don't know.

549
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:44,000
But it's like, ooh, I got to pick all these up, like I'm never going to play them, I have like a list of like games on my, you know, PlayStation Network that it's starting to look like my Steam library.

550
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,000
And I've been buying everything digitally, which is weird because I like hated the idea of like buying stuff digitally, but I'm just so lazy.

551
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
That convenience is awfully tempting, isn't it?

552
00:48:52,000 --> 00:49:01,000
It is, and especially now that they're marking shit down that low, it's very tempting because I check the sales every week and there's stuff on there that like, fuck, for $4.

553
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Hey, Sony and Microsoft are competing with Steam now, it's pretty win-win for the rest of us, you know?

554
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Exactly, so I'm digging it.

555
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Right, anything else for your gaming week?

556
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
So far, I worked on my game, but that's about it.

557
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:29,000
My gaming week, you know, I was out of town for a week, so outside of my one trip to the arcade where I got to play stuff like Technica 3 and Papa Music, I didn't play a lot a lot, except on the plane I also would play a bit of Bejeweled and those typical like iPad iPhone games, in airplane mode of course.

558
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:41,000
But I did get hands-on with a few other things here at home, not too extensively, but I picked up a game that some of the listeners, at least one listener, called in and said, you need to play this game.

559
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:51,000
And so I actually got to watch a friend of mine play this as well the other day, and I was convinced that I needed to pick up Fantasy Life on the 3DS.

560
00:49:51,000 --> 00:50:04,000
And Fantasy Life is a game by Level 5, which made, you know, of course Ni No Kuni, White Knight Chronicles, I believe Yokai Watch is their game as well, which isn't here in the States yet, but it's huge in Japan.

561
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:18,000
So I picked up Fantasy Life. I'm not really far enough into the game where I feel comfortable quote-unquote reviewing it per se, but if you're not aware of the game, it's kind of like, I don't know if I want to say Animal Crossing meets JRPG.

562
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:38,000
However, it definitely feels like, you know, you're put into this game, you can choose between 12 different jobs, some of them being crafting and some other things, which feels maybe a little bit, funny enough, as Eric said earlier, Final Fantasy XIV might feel a little bit of that to me, where you can switch from one job to the other and kind of help your other jobs out by doing that.

563
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:54,000
And you're in this town and, you know, you're like a kid growing up and you can go out into the world and you do all these little quests. You can do quests for people, you can do little achievements, like mini achievements that will give you perks like a bigger bag and all these other things.

564
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:08,000
So yeah, there's a lot of, I guess there's a lot of different grinds to it, which may turn some people off, but I also see where those kind of grinds, you know, that's kind of what an MMO essentially is totally made out of.

565
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:18,000
And that can also be very therapeutic, I think, in some ways. So I will say I'm enjoying very much what I'm playing of Fantasy Life so far, but admittedly it isn't much. I'm only like an hour into the game.

566
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I've barely, I think I finally got it where I finished my little wizard quest, I got my wizard robes and hat, I got all the hat.

567
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:34,000
It sounds like, see now I haven't played it yet, but it sounds to me a lot like Room Factory. It's like an RPG spinoff of Harvest Moon.

568
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Probably. And you can, well the reason why I called it Animal Crossing is that you can do a lot of quests for the villagers, but instead of like, oh, go take, you know, go take superb owl on my couch, you know, and this whole thing, it's more like, can you go out and fetch me five cow milk things from the wilderness, you know, things like that.

569
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:09,000
So they, you actually are doing more like JRPG style fetch quests. But then like, you can spend the money that you get on furniture for your room, so, and you can even, one of the perks that you get is you can adopt a dog or a cat type of thing so you can get a pet.

570
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:23,000
So you know, there's those types of grinds built into it too. So I'm enjoying it so far though. I'm glad it was recommended to me and then finally basically placed in front of me saying you need to see this game and I finally looked at it and I'm like, oh yeah, I probably would like this.

571
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Shane pushed it on you.

572
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Actually it wasn't Shane. It was my friend Christine, who I don't think listens to OLR, but she was actually the one that showed it to me. She was over here yesterday and we were on a quick road trip and she was like, oh yeah, you got to check out this game.

573
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:46,000
And she showed it to me and I was like, oh yeah, this does seem like my type of game. And I even remembered that we had a call where somebody had said it was one of their top games of the year last year.

574
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:57,000
And I was like, oh yeah, and I have Nintendo fans on Twitter who all rave about it. So I was like, okay, yeah, I've definitely heard of this. And I was like, oh, it's by the Nino Cooney guys. No wonder we all are liking this game.

575
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:05,000
And I liked White Knight Chronicles more than most people did. So I find this game to be a little bit like that up my alley.

576
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:15,000
BobbyBlackWolf in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says a lot of people compare it to Rune Factory. Yes, more Rune Factory than Animal Crossing.

577
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Pow in chat says fantasy life is awesome. I love how bossy and bitter the fairy is. Yeah, I got to say, even in the short hour I've played, there's some very sassy tongue in cheek localization humor going on in there.

578
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:36,000
It's kind of like geared towards kids, but there's definitely that adult level too. So I have to say, I like the script in the game as well.

579
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:43,000
So far, I'm feeling very good about fantasy life. I will check in with you guys next week when I have to put a little more hours in the game under my belt.

580
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Alright, let's move on. Some quick housekeeping. We don't have any shows off in the near future, so we'll be coming to you every week in February.

581
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:03,000
The next show I would see that we could be gone or taping in advance would be during PAX East, which is coming up in March. We may be delayed or something that week, we'll see.

582
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:12,000
But I'll let you guys know as the weeks go on. Otherwise, follow us on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio. You can also follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

583
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Let's get into tonight's news. There was a bit of news this week, wasn't there? Microsoft had a lot to say, didn't they?

584
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:25,000
It was definitely a big news week. I remember seeing the schedule saying, hey, there's going to be that Windows 10 announcement and everything.

585
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:33,000
But the big thing out of Microsoft's thinking, it shouldn't really be a shock to you if you've been following Microsoft's movements.

586
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Especially if you remember back, this is almost, god, I don't even remember how many years now it's been, but that leak that they had about their step-by-step game plan for the next generation of game systems starting with Kinect.

587
00:54:53,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Where they had the Kinect, the Xbox One, and all that stuff that leaked out. And then one of the things that they were showing with the Kinect was this kind of holographic, VR-type gameplay.

588
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:16,000
And everyone's like, well, what the hell is that going to be? Well, this is what it is. HoloLens, this thing that they announced. It's basically augmented reality glasses that you wear.

589
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:25,000
And it hooks up to a computer, or it may actually be a computer, and basically augments your world that you live in with whatever the fuck you want.

590
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:35,000
They've showed different examples. Obviously no real gameplay yet, but they have Minecraft in your living room that everything kind of adapts to your environment and everything.

591
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:44,000
So it knows where the walls are. And they had in the little teaser videos, someone blows up their wall and sees the Minecraft world outside. Kind of gimmicky shit like that.

592
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:53,000
But other things like Windows-related stuff like 3D modeling, they had a demonstration using that, and that was pretty cool.

593
00:55:53,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Basically, it's going to be used for gaming and for other things. I don't know, kind of a neat idea. I think it's a little bit different than, say, VR stuff.

594
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:19,000
And I think, I don't know, maybe a little bit easier to adopt for people for VR. But I'm very cautious about it, considering how they had a cool teaser video before for Kinect when that first came out.

595
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:27,000
It was like, wow, that's going to be so amazing. And it was so amazingly not that. So I kind of want to see what this is.

596
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:40,000
But to go along with that, other announcements they had, Windows 10 stuff integration for Xbox One where you're going to be able to stream your gameplay to your system and that kind of fun stuff.

597
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:50,000
And plus, for Windows 8 and Windows 7 users, Windows 10 is free. I like free, because I'm not going to buy Windows 10. It better not be fucking broken either.

598
00:56:50,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Well, when you consider Apple has a huge mobile operating system that they do give away for free. It's starting to make paying $100 for Windows look less and less appealing.

599
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Though, granted, I believe Apple charges a small amount for the desktop OSs. I can't remember. I haven't had a working Apple laptop in forever.

600
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I can answer this question. Anything that is 10.8 and earlier has a charge on it, but you cannot buy anything older than 10.6.

601
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Gotcha.

602
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:38,000
So there is still charges for some things on Apple, but we have seen Apple give away upgrades for free, especially on the mobile front.

603
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I do want to get this. I mean, it looks pretty cool. But once again, I'm very cautious, because with Kinect, remember, they were showing all this cool shit that you could do with it and it's still not even close to what they're doing.

604
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
You could scan the skateboard and give it to Milo.

605
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Yeah, scan the skateboard, and they even had, like, was it, you know, oh, I'm trying on outfits. That stuff I see now is something you could probably do with maybe HoloLens or something, where it's like, okay, you know, I'm seeing the clothes augmented onto my body or whatever, that type of thing.

606
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:17,000
But I just don't see, especially after two iterations of Kinect, and it's still not what they were promising. I just, I'm very cautious.

607
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:31,000
This is interesting to me. You know, this competition is kind of fun, and I think a lot of us have been waiting to see what's Microsoft's response going to be to the Oculus, to the Morpheus, you know, what's Microsoft's response going to be to that.

608
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:41,000
So it is interesting to see this direction that they're going in, which is different. I mean, yes, it's let's put a helmet on my head and see what, you know, the world around me looks like through this, you know, these glasses.

609
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:53,000
But, you know, with the holograph, that's going to be very different than the VR experience. So I kind of like that where it's like, okay, they're both, you know, put your helmet on the head experiences, but they're still very different.

610
00:58:53,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Yeah, one is more, it seems like, you know, at least you're able to see your surrounding environment and everything and kind of do your own stuff along with it.

611
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,000
And it's just kind of like, oh, hey, I want this Windows Media Player screen to be on this part of the wall or something like that.

612
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:17,000
My worry is I've tried a lot of different AR stuff, you know, with the 3DS, with, you know, even the Kinect and even, you know, the Vita, my phone, and it's just very derpy.

613
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Well, you know, here's the thing. Here's where I stand with HoloLens myself is that, you know, I wasn't really a believer in Oculus Rift until I got to try it.

614
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:35,000
You know, at Dragon Con a couple of years ago, Bobby bought his whole little, you know, dev kit one or whatever it was and actually showed me like the roller coaster thing and the walking around the house and all this stuff.

615
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:43,000
You know, he actually showed off some of the demos and I was like, all right, I kind of get this and this does work a lot better than you think it would.

616
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:54,000
And so I was on board with Oculus and certainly getting to play the Morpheus at E3 this year, I really like that Sony has thought about how is this going to work for the other people in the room.

617
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Because if you're sitting there with the glasses on your head, nobody else can see that experience but for you.

618
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:04,000
So that's why they have that whole separate little box so it seems like they're going to be able to project the image on the TV as well as the glasses.

619
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:10,000
So I like that Sony's kind of going that direction with it where it's going to be more of, I guess, maybe a party, you know, type of thing.

620
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:18,000
So that's really neat to see and certainly getting to play the little like bobsledding in traffic little demo that they had on the Morpheus, that was really cool.

621
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:28,000
So that was neat. So I think I kind of need that same experience for HoloLens because like you, I'm left a little skeptical with all these promises with what Kinect is supposed to do.

622
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:33,000
And then it ends up, eh, it's a bunch of dancing games and aerobics type stuff.

623
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I may be selling it a little short. I understand that in some of the professional fields and in medicine, you know, Kinect has been to thank for some advances in that regard.

624
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:50,000
But keep in mind, first and foremost, this is a gaming show. I'm worried about gaming techniques.

625
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:56,000
And so, you know, this HoloLens, granted, was shown at a Windows show so they're thinking more things necessarily than just Minecraft.

626
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:02,000
But I'm curious to see, you know, I need to see what that's really going to look like for gaming before I know, oh, do I need to put down all this money?

627
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Well, that's the other thing, too, is they're talking about like this basically combining all their different platforms and that's just going to be Windows 10 like the Xbox One.

628
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:17,000
It's just, oh, it's got Windows 10 on it now. I don't know how I feel about that, but we'll see.

629
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:22,000
And Bobby's in our chat room saying using AR on a handheld device is a little bit different than using it as a headset.

630
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:28,000
That is very true, Loki. You do have to try it for yourself before I think you can really say this is Oculus Rift or this.

631
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Because you just can't unless you've seen it. You just can't.

632
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I get it. I get it. But my take on it, and I'm not doubting that it could be really good, but my take on it is this is what in the past with the last big thing with Kinect, this is what they promised me and the end result was crap.

633
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
You know, it wasn't anything near that.

634
01:01:48,000 --> 01:02:00,000
And that is my same concern is that I feel like the Kinect on 360 that we were supposed to be getting wasn't really until the Kinect on Xbox One that we saw that.

635
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,000
And even on Xbox One, I'm not sure if it's still quite where we need it to be.

636
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Microsoft failed at convincing people they needed one. That's why they kind of got their butt kicked in the beginning.

637
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:17,000
I mean, I realize they're doing better now. They did very well in their November, December sales, especially with the price cut and disconnecting Kinect and everything.

638
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:23,000
But I don't think it's out of place to say that Microsoft failed in making people understand why they needed a Kinect.

639
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
They were not able to Kinect with the audience.

640
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Anyway, let's move on. Moving on to another story that sort of has to do with this whole event as well.

641
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:50,000
And this does tie it to gaming is that there seemed to be an awful lot of teasing at the various displays and so forth with Windows 10 for Battletoads.

642
01:02:51,000 --> 01:03:01,000
During the Windows 10 livestream, I know, Phil Spencer showed up to talk about games and he was wearing a Battletoads shirt.

643
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:10,000
This is the latest in several little hints and drops that Battletoads may be a thing on Xbox One.

644
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,000
And I kind of feel like we're getting to that point where E3, Microsoft is going to announce,

645
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Battletoads is coming to the Xbox One. You all have missed it. Here comes Battletoads.

646
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:25,000
And we're going to see Twitter light up everywhere. I called it. I called it. You heard it from my mouth.

647
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Battletoads coming to Windows Mobile 10.

648
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Jamie, you're groaning over there, though. You're not a fan?

649
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
The game's evil. I like it, but it's evil.

650
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
It's just the difficulty.

651
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
It is evil and I love it.

652
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I could see if they were to do a new Battletoads game, it'll probably be like, they're going to make it more accessible.

653
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Oh, fuck that. No, it's not Battletoads. I'm sorry.

654
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I'm telling you, they'll want to make it more appealing to kids, because they don't really have Viva Pinata anymore,

655
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,000
so that they need a kiddie franchise, so they're going to probably try to make Battletoads like that.

656
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
They're going to fucking Sonic Boom this shit is what they're going to do, right?

657
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:07,000
But I could also see that very easily they would have a moat, because they can't just kid-ify it.

658
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I think people would react exactly the way you do.

659
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I think there will be some type of difficulty switch, where it's like a new and retro difficulty or something.

660
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:20,000
If you're not feeling ragey enough to throw your controller, it's not Battletoads, I'm afraid.

661
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:29,000
It's like, that's the point. The point of the game is that you get so frustrated with it, but then once you finally do it, you're like, yes.

662
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:34,000
And then you get to an even harder level, and then you're like, fuck. I have to play that level again.

663
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I think Phil Spencer is very tuned into his audience, and you have to admit, whether you're a lover or a hater or somewhere in the middle of Xbox One,

664
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:51,000
it's been doing better under his leadership. And I think a lot of that is because of the fact that he's really tuned into the gaming audience,

665
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
and he's a little more connected to what the gamers really want.

666
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:05,000
So I have to admit, when he makes the conscious choice at a big event to wear a Battletoads shirt, he's sending a message that he knows he's sending.

667
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:13,000
And it's getting people talking, if nothing else. Maybe he's just trying to prove that there's interest out there for Battletoads. Who knows?

668
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,000
But I think there's a damn good possibility that is what we're going to see at E3 this year.

669
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Although I would expect that Microsoft's focus this year will be on Crackdown, because that was the big thing they unveiled last year that we need to see.

670
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
That should be releasing this year.

671
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
More of that, please.

672
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:35,000
And I'm hoping Quantum Break as well. But this might be the year to tease Battletoads for 2016.

673
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
God, I want Crackdown so bad.

674
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Yes, I know. I know.

675
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Would Jamie be willing to at least give Battletoads a chance in 2016?

676
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Nope.

677
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Nope.

678
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Nope.

679
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Nope.

680
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Seriously, what's up with Saints Row 4 ripping off on Battletoads on Crackdown? You know, with the glowing orbs and shit? That is totally ripping off on Crackdown.

681
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Alright. Let's see. And going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Pow in chat says, Battletoads connect. Fingers crossed.

682
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
You know what?

683
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
What's that?

684
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I will tell you this. I already play Mass Effect in Dragon Age and I don't need something else to make me cry.

685
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Dungeonbuster in chat says, the arcade version was actually a little bit easier, if I recall correctly.

686
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I had to play through the arcade version on my MAME cabinet. It was fun.

687
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Rageinator says, Battletoads t-shirt, Half Life 3 confirmed. Oh, wouldn't that be nice? Wouldn't that be nice?

688
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Well, there are three toads in it, so yes.

689
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Let's travel around the world and check out...

690
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Wait, wait, wait.

691
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
What?

692
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
They should have a level called Toad in the Hole since it's like food.

693
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out the release dates of games coming a little sooner than a new Battletoads.

694
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Oh, I'm sorry, Jamie. Did I skip your story?

695
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Yeah, you did.

696
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Whoops, my bad.

697
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I'm just not going to do it now.

698
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Oh, stop throwing a fit. My bad.

699
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Well, there is actually something a bit more about the Windows 10 technical preview is that they're going to throw in a preview of the Xbox One app in the January build.

700
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:13,000
So there will be a way, I guess, to have more integration with your live account and all this other stuff.

701
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Basically, they said that they're focusing on the basics, including making sure that the app is going to be on spot and have everything that people are going to need for their live accounts.

702
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Are you interested in Windows 10 after all the stuff you're hearing about it?

703
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
No.

704
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Well, the other thing, they said they're also going to work on including streaming from Xbox One to PC.

705
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:44,000
And I'll tell you this, all of this is actually making me glad that I'm moving to OS 10.

706
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Why, though?

707
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Just because I can't talk about it.

708
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Well, I can't hate on, though.

709
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Well, let's focus on the dislike of the streaming between Xbox One and PC.

710
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Because it's an additional feature to me. I'm like, okay, it doesn't seem like such a bad thing. I'm not sure how it's a negative.

711
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Yeah, but I want a computer that does computer things.

712
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:22,000
You know, I don't want to have a crossover with a console when I am playing specifically on a computer for the sake of playing on a computer.

713
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:28,000
It does make me think, though, and this is probably a little bit of a pie in the sky idea and people are going to tell me how wrong I am.

714
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:42,000
However, let me dream for a minute here that I would love this if I could take Halo 5, let's say, on my Xbox One and stream it to my computer so I could use keyboard and mouse on my computer when I play Halo 5.

715
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
That would be awesome.

716
01:08:45,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I can see that, but the whole thing is that if you look at it this way, though, it's almost as if they're trying to force more people that, hey, we've already got a PC.

717
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:06,000
The only console that's going to work with this is going to be this Xbox.

718
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:18,000
We need you to get our items so that you can get full integration with your system rather than apps out there that are, oh, well, if you have this here, you get something for your PlayStation.

719
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
We're going to see an end of that.

720
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:28,000
You know, it's all going to be down to I honestly think it's going to be a lot more of a pushing agenda.

721
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,000
That and honestly, we may be looking at too little too late.

722
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,000
There have been others that have been innovating on stuff like this well before they have.

723
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:46,000
I guess there was the whole fact that you can stream to the Vita from the PlayStation 4, but again, I see it as more of like, okay, this is just something extra.

724
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,000
I may never use it, but I guess it's kind of cool that I can do that.

725
01:09:50,000 --> 01:10:00,000
And we have seen this already talked about going the other way, and Steam has been talking about certainly doing the streaming to the televisions based off what's on your PC through the whole Steam box.

726
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
So, I mean, this just kind of seems like another step in that direction.

727
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:11,000
But I think I would only really use it if I could do something like what I just mentioned with sudden keyboard and mouse controls for certain games.

728
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:19,000
It honestly just seems like they're going, oh, us too, when other people have been doing all these things already.

729
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:26,000
And then bringing out the whole HoloLens thing to kind of distract from, oh, other people have already been doing this.

730
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
This HoloLens is kind of different though.

731
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I'm totally down for streaming to my laptop for my game system and stuff, because my wife tends to use the TV when I want to play games, and that'd be awesome.

732
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:45,000
I wish all the systems would stream to my PC. I mean, I don't know why they can't.

733
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:52,000
If a Vita can run a PlayStation 4 game, surely a laptop can run a PlayStation 4 game stream.

734
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Depending on your laptop. Okay, if your laptop can run Windows 10, then it can do it, right?

735
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:05,000
I mean, that's what I'm saying. I would love to have that feature, if anything, so I wouldn't have to set up an elaborate setup to be able to play my game.

736
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Interesting. Okay. Well, we'll see more about what this is going to entail in the future as Windows 10 preview builds come out and people actually get their hands on this stuff when it's unlocked.

737
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:26,000
All right, now I've got the airship out front ready to go and travel around the world and check out what will be coming out a little sooner than Windows 10 or Battletoads or any of that stuff.

738
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Next week around the world in gaming releases, starting in the U.S., Loki.

739
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Hey, you got some parkour in my zombie game, so Dying Light will be coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC this week.

740
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:47,000
And if you're not into Dying Light and may have a Vita, then Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth Sisters Generation will be coming to the Vita. That would be it.

741
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Well, going to Japan, we're finally starting to see some releases. I know things were a little slower in the beginning of the month, but in Japan this week on the PlayStation 4,

742
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:02,000
we get Blade Storm, The Hundred Years War and Nightmare, as well as Far Cry 4, getting its Japanese release this week on the 29th.

743
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:10,000
On the Xbox One, Blade Storm is coming out there as well, although I noticed Far Cry is absent, so I don't know if it's just not releasing over there or what the deal is.

744
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Over on the Wii U, we get nothing until Mario Party 10 in March, so the Wii U releases over in Japan are a little bit slow right now.

745
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:38,000
But on the 3DS, you have a few more things going on, including Ace Combat 3D, Cross Rumble Plus, Devil Survivor 2, Break Record, and Yamamushi Pedal, Ashita Inoue High Cadence comes out from Bandai Namco this week in Japan on the 3DS.

746
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:47,000
And last but not least, looking at the Vita. The Vita this week has...wow, there's a lot of crap on the Vita this week, actually.

747
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Diabolic Lovers, More Blood limited edition V, that's of course a limited edition game. Hitosutabashi Rinai V in regular and limited edition.

748
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Kokujou no Psychedelica in regular and limited edition. You know they love their limited editions over there. More than we do here.

749
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:14,000
And Kurogane Kaikatan Senai Ichiya comes out in regular and limited edition in Japan this week, all on the Vita.

750
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Busy week on the Vita in Japan. How about the UK, DarkSakura?

751
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:31,000
We have a few things. On January 27th, we have Hyperdimension Aptunia Rebirth 2. On the 29th, we have Heroes of Might and Magic 3 HD edition for iPad, PC, and Android.

752
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:43,000
On the 30th, we have Life is Strange on several systems, and Saints Row IV Re-elected, and Unmechanical Extended on Xbox One.

753
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Alright, just a few more stories for you guys, then we'll get to the classic game of the week. But first, Loki.

754
01:13:49,000 --> 01:14:00,000
So, can't say we didn't call this, or have been seeing this for a long time now, but finally it has happened. To a certain extent.

755
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:08,000
But the Elder Scrolls Online no longer will have the subscription fee. That's right, it's going, well, not free to play, but buy to play.

756
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,000
So basically, you purchase the game, and then you get to play for free month to month, which is kind of cool.

757
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:29,000
And it will be coming out on consoles June 9th, and according to ZeniMax, they're going to be dropping the subscription to the service on PC March 17th.

758
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:42,000
And that will be rebranded as the Elder Scrolls Online Tamriel Unlimited, and they still have the option to pay a monthly fee if you want extra content and that kind of stuff.

759
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:51,000
So, I really went off on this on Hoard House this week, because everybody's reporting it as free to play, but it's not free to play when you're still charging for the base game.

760
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
And, what's another big one out there?

761
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Guild Wars?

762
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:04,000
No, Guild Wars actually isn't free to play either. Guild Wars has a huge sale right now. Guild Wars 2 specifically has a huge sale right now.

763
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I may or may not have spent $15 on the deluxe edition.

764
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Taking the plunge on that, yeah. But, yeah, you have to pay that one-time fee, and then you are playing the game without a monthly subscription. It's basically subscription-free.

765
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:28,000
So, I mean, they're still going to be charging $60 for this game. But, you know, what's the difference between that and something like Destiny?

766
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Destiny you pay $60, and then you can play online as much as you want. And then how do they get even more money out of you? Through expansions.

767
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:45,000
And that's exactly what Elder Scrolls Online is going to do. It's going to be through expansions, and they'll be like, oh, but if you have a sub-fee, then you can get these crowns for the cosmetic items, and then we'll give you all these expansions we're going to do for free.

768
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I think it's a better model for the game, and I think especially now that since you're entering the console market, I think that's what a lot of console gamers expect.

769
01:15:54,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Subscription games on consoles doing well are very, very, very rare, and they're pretty much always preceded by Final Fantasy, if they still carry a subscription fee on a console.

770
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Can you even think of any console games that carry subscription fees right now that are not named Final Fantasy? I can't think of one.

771
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:24,000
I know there's free-to-play MMOs, but I'm talking you've got to buy the game and pay a subscription fee on top of that on consoles. I can't think of one.

772
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,000
So, not anymore, because they used to have some where they were like DC Universe.

773
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:35,000
There was the game that Trion did that went free-to-play that was on 360. They did the sci-fi TV show.

774
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Oh, well that wasn't a monthly fee, though.

775
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Oh, I thought it was.

776
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
No, it was just like this, where you buy it and you play it.

777
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Oh, gotcha.

778
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Yeah, Defiance.

779
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Defiance.

780
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
But now that's free-to-play, so...

781
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Yeah, there you go.

782
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Yeah.

783
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:54,000
So, let's see, looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, bonds006 says,

784
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:59,000
There is no true free-to-play game. In-app DLC or base buys still exist.

785
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:04,000
You know, but some do the free-to-play thing better than others. They really do.

786
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Like, EA mobile games have been notorious for being very naggy and buying the currency,

787
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
like that Ultima game that they did that was awful, some of this other stuff.

788
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
You know, they have a bit of a reputation for that.

789
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Dungeon Keeper or whatever that was.

790
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Yeah, yeah. But then, I look at a game like Path of Exile, which is also free-to-play,

791
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:27,000
and, okay, yeah, they have a lot of stuff that you can pay for that are cosmetic or some other things,

792
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:33,000
but I still feel like there's a very rich game experience that you can play start to finish over in Path of Exile

793
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
that is totally free. And so that's pretty cool.

794
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:41,000
So, anyway, maybe that was the free-to-play game, the other one I was trying to think of a minute ago,

795
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:45,000
but, yeah, you can download Path of Exile and just, you know, play that, whatever.

796
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:49,000
But, yeah, I have to admit, I'm much more interested in Elder Scrolls Online now.

797
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
I might have to check it out.

798
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Skarstacra?

799
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
By the way, I would like to rebut.

800
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,000
In-app purchases are not a requirement.

801
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
True.

802
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:07,000
You can play a game completely free without choosing to participate in an in-app purchase.

803
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Therefore, it remains free.

804
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:18,000
But, well, Apple actually changed from free to get because of some of the, it's just, it depends on the game.

805
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Like, Bejeweled Blitz does a really good job about being, like, free-to-play where you don't,

806
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
like, they don't really shove it down your throat.

807
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:29,000
The other thing is that, like, the EA games I mentioned, some of them are very much more in your face

808
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:34,000
and make it very, very difficult to do any sort of progression without buying into it.

809
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Do you still have a choice?

810
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
You do. You do. But...

811
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:41,000
It's just a matter of how much more willpower you have than their persuasion.

812
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Ah. I think I know the way to put it.

813
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Some people would consider what those games are doing more of a demo than they are a game.

814
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:54,000
And that is a trend I do see in some apps is that they're free, but it's really just a demo for the first level.

815
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,000
And if you want to buy the entire game, well, then you make the purchase inside the app.

816
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:03,000
And I think that's kind of the difference is that some games really do offer a rich game experience.

817
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
They have these options on either side. Some are just flat out demos.

818
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
I do believe they are required to put that in their, the body of their description.

819
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,000
That it's either a first level, a demo, or it has to say light edition.

820
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Hmm. I'll have to look up the one that I downloaded not that long ago and see if it did that.

821
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
So, interesting.

822
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Alright. Let's see. Looking at chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

823
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Dungeon Buster says, never winner is free to play, though depending on who you talk to, it's either pay to win because of PVP or pay for convenience if you don't care about PVP.

824
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Bonds006 says, angry birds, plants versus zombies, those are called pay to win.

825
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Maybe that Garden Warfare game is a big hill to climb without doing any in-app purchases, that's for sure.

826
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Anyway, let's move on. I got one more story for you guys and we're going to get to the classic game of the week.

827
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:59,000
And speaking of big purchases, people went crazy for that new Nintendo 3DS Majora's Mask edition.

828
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Which I have to admit, again, I'm going to get the Nintendo hate train rolling over me here.

829
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Because I'm going to say something slightly negative.

830
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:18,000
But I was not really a big fan of Majora's Mask, although I'll probably give the 3D reboot a try because they really enhance Ocarina of Time and stuff for the 3DS.

831
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Nintendo does a very good job at enriching their games when they do the remakes as opposed to just port type of thing.

832
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:32,000
But I have no interest in the Majora's Mask 3DS because I kind of think it's ugly.

833
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
I'm going to get so much slack for that.

834
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:40,000
But that's how I feel. I'm allowed to my opinion. I'm allowed to say this art is ugly and I think those new 3DSes are ugly.

835
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:50,000
On top of that, I have a problem with once again Nintendo trying to make themselves seem more value friendly by not including the game with the freaking system.

836
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Well, I just think this Triforce XL I have is way better. That's a way better Zelda design in my opinion.

837
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
But that's my opinion and I'm entitled to it and some may disagree.

838
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:03,000
I do wish the gold on that was as shiny as the original NES game.

839
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:11,000
So anyway, a few folks preordered their Nintendo's 3DS Majora's Mask on Best Buy.

840
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Well, Best Buy cancelled a lot of these preorders.

841
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:20,000
And apparently, wow, it's affecting people that only preordered one system.

842
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:25,000
And the retailer started to give out $50 gift cards as a way of saying, oops, sorry about that.

843
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,000
The email saying, quote, we're sorry but there's an issue with your preorder.

844
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:36,000
The popularity of Nintendo 3DS XL Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask, limited edition gold and black, exceeded the quantities made available to Best Buy.

845
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
As a result, we're unable to fulfill all the preorders received.

846
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Your preorder has been cancelled and we know this is disappointing.

847
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:48,000
So we're making it up to you by offering a $50 discount that may be used towards the purchase of one of these alternate options.

848
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:58,000
I never understood how something that's literally a paint job on a system is, you know, they're not able to meet the demand on that.

849
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,000
It's like, paint more of them.

850
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
I mean, that doesn't seem like it.

851
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Or make it capable to sub out the faceplates and then you can have the new faceplates on them.

852
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Yeah, there's not as much money to be made on that.

853
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Then they wouldn't get the publicity like this.

854
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:19,000
If things were able to meet their demands, they're not going to get the publicity, so of course.

855
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Let's see, Bonds006 says Best Buy already made that money.

856
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:28,000
PhysicsMajor in chat says Majora's Mask is my favorite Zelda title, very difficult.

857
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
And you know, I've heard that from other people too.

858
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,000
I gotta be honest, they're probably losing a ton of money on that because there's no markup on game hardware.

859
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:38,000
They're making maybe a couple bucks off that and if that.

860
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Probably losing it in shipping anyway, so they're not making any money off of that.

861
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:50,000
ActDeft in chat says the Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate New 3DS looks way more awesome, but sadly it's a GameStop exclusive.

862
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,000
There's a whole nother Oprah about those types of exclusives that go to...

863
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Like, why does Nintendo, I mean, I guess this is kind of a stupid question, but why does Nintendo keep being up GameStop's ass like this?

864
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:07,000
And maybe it's so GameStop won't kick the Wii U out of the store, maybe that's what it has to do with,

865
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:11,000
but I just, it's disappointing as a fan.

866
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
These sorts of exclusive deals and stuff are just really disappointing.

867
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
That's really the only word I can think of for it. Sucks.

868
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Well, anyway.

869
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Alright, let's go back to a time when it was a lot simpler.

870
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,000
There was an abundance of games wherever you wanted to go.

871
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:32,000
You could go in and find them in a big bin at KB Toys if that's where you wanted to shop for your video games.

872
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,000
It's the classic game of the week.

873
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,000
And every week Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

874
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
hey, you guys should be checking out this game this week.

875
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Yes, I know the music isn't playing, I can't find it.

876
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
What happened to my music for this segment?

877
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,000
I want to know where my list of the thing went, so, huh.

878
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
What list of the thing?

879
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
I accidentally closed Safari.

880
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Oh.

881
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Oops. Well, that's awkward.

882
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:02,000
I usually have the cutesy music to play here for Dark Sakura, but it disappeared from my playlist.

883
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
There it is, I got it back.

884
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Live radio and the joys of it.

885
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Alright, so Dark Sakura's going to step in that gaming vault and find the game that she thinks,

886
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
hey, you should check out this game this week.

887
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
I think it's Dustin's Cat Throw Up.

888
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,000
And you will have no problem finding this game.

889
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,000
You were there when I purchased this version.

890
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
One of the versions I have of this.

891
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Oh, yes I was. I know what you're talking about.

892
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Yes.

893
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,000
The game of the week is Pac-Land.

894
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Now, Pac-Land is not really a great game.

895
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,000
But, it is iconic.

896
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Now listen to the music for a moment.

897
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:42,000
And tell me if any of you who were kids when I was a kid recognize this music.

898
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Oh, he got a helmet or something.

899
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Yeah.

900
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
It's been forever since I played this.

901
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,000
It was like Pac-Man Mario, it was so weird.

902
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
It's very weird.

903
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Anyway, the music that's playing in the background in both the Japanese and American versions

904
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:12,000
was the music from the American Pac-Man cartoon that was on in the 80s.

905
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Which wasn't a great cartoon, but it was plenty hilarious.

906
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:24,000
So yeah, in Japan it was done by Namco, or as I call it, Namco-T.

907
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,000
With a T at the end because it was Namcopped.

908
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:32,000
And in the US it was done by Bally Midway, which is now just Midway Games.

909
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:37,000
It came out in 1984 in the arcades.

910
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:45,000
It also was using a new arcade system that was actually called Namco Pac-Land.

911
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:49,000
It used parallax scrolling for some of the different background elements

912
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:55,000
well before it became a regular fixture in 16-bit gaming.

913
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:03,000
There were different variances I was differentiating between the American and Japanese ones.

914
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:09,000
In the Japanese version it actually is one of the first appearances in a game of Pac-Man

915
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:18,000
with his now iconic Namco artwork with the big eyes and the longer nose.

916
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:23,000
And he also in the game had what was called a Tearolian Hat.

917
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Which I actually had to go look up even though I've seen the term before.

918
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Which is basically a big kind of flat brimmed hat with a feather in it.

919
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:38,000
It's based off of a Bavarian style.

920
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Anyway, the American version started...

921
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:49,000
It's differences is that the characters were more based on how the Pac-Man animated series that Hannah Barbera did.

922
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Including the differences in the ghosts and the way Pac-Man looked.

923
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:59,000
It was a lot more in tune with what we had in America.

924
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Better branded I'd say.

925
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:06,000
And the Midway version, the US one, actually plays faster than the Japanese one.

926
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
This I can attest to.

927
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,000
So the game itself is split into trips.

928
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:17,000
On each of these trips your goal is to get this fairy that's hiding under Pac-Man's hat to Fairyland.

929
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
And then get Pac-Man back home.

930
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
So you scroll left and right.

931
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
You have to stop ghosts.

932
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,000
You can get power pills and you can eat the ghosts.

933
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
They turn purple.

934
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,000
You have water spurts and quicksands.

935
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Each trip has different rounds.

936
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:39,000
So at the end you get bonus points depending on how much time you have left.

937
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:43,000
And your position in jumping at the end of the round.

938
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:51,000
If you run out of time before the round is over then Sue, the purple ghost, the lady ghost, remember her?

939
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,000
She will actually get really really fast.

940
01:27:54,000 --> 01:28:02,000
So the very, the second to last one, Pac-Man ends up in Fairyland and returning the fairy to the queen.

941
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
And then Pac-Man is given magical boots.

942
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:09,000
And so the last one he has to basically travel from right to left to get back home.

943
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,000
And he uses the magical boots to let him double jump and do what not.

944
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,000
And at the end of the game he's greeted by Ms. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man.

945
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:20,000
In the US one, Sourpuss and Chomp Chomp are there.

946
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,000
His cat and his dog from the animated series.

947
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:28,000
And then he gets to do the next trip and it gets harder.

948
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:32,000
You also get fruit appearing during the game like in the original Pac-Man.

949
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
It gives you points.

950
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,000
You get hidden items which is actually the flagship from Galaxian.

951
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:41,000
And it gives you 7650 points when you collected.

952
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Which is the Goro Awase number 765.

953
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:54,000
The flagship also appears in plenty of other Pac-Man games.

954
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
There's no actual hidden bonuses.

955
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,000
You eat the ghosts in a certain order will give you time.

956
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:04,000
And getting certain obstacles can give you extra lives, invincibility, or balloons.

957
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,000
So you get points you can even warp in some places.

958
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Basically you had two buttons that move them left or right and a third one that made them jump.

959
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:20,000
On the TurboGrafx-16 they tried to do two different control versions.

960
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:26,000
They let you either use the D-pad or type B that use the buttons rather than the D-pad.

961
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,000
I'm watching this guy run it on the little YouTube that you gave us here.

962
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,000
That will be available if you watch this on the OLR YouTube account.

963
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:39,000
He's doing all these things that I don't remember in the game.

964
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Like pushing cactuses to make special bonus things appear.

965
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
And all this other stuff. I'm kind of shocked.

966
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,000
I'm like, wow, all this shit was in the game? I didn't realize that.

967
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
I thought it was just a side scroller.

968
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
There were Famicom versions by the way.

969
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,000
And you use A and B to run and the D-pad to jump.

970
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Now there were of course other versions, Rob.

971
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
There was a Commodore 64 version.

972
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
I know that, yeah, yeah.

973
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:09,000
There was one for the Commodore Amiga, Atari Lynx, the Atari ST, TurboGrafx-16, the ZX Spectrum, and the Amstrad CPC, the MSX, and the NES.

974
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,000
And you can also get this on the Wii U Virtual Console.

975
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,000
They actually re-released this as part of the Namco Museum Volume 4 for Playstation.

976
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
There's an LCD version of Pac-Land.

977
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:28,000
In 2012 Namco re-released Pac-Land on the Namco Arcade app for iPhone and iPad.

978
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:41,000
It was included in Pac-Man Museum and all of the ports that were released in and out of Japan were based off of the Namco version.

979
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:52,000
However, the Namco Arcade version actually has the Midway version and also the Midway version appears in the Japanese version of the same app.

980
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:58,000
So you actually have ways that you can play both versions in both countries without having to import.

981
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Interesting.

982
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
So that's it, it's Pac-Land.

983
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
There it is, your classic game of the week, Pac-Land.

984
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Which again, the other thing I wanted to say about this game, especially because unsurprisingly you chose the TurboGrafx-16 or PC Engine version to show here to demonstrate this game.

985
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
I actually like the music better than the arcade one.

986
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Fair enough.

987
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:23,000
But it kind of reminds me that the gameplay is an awful lot like, in some ways, Hudson Adventure Island.

988
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Which was what, Wonder Boy? Wasn't that turned into Hudson?

989
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
I think it was one of the Wonder Boy games.

990
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Yeah, it was kind of turned into Hudson Adventure Island.

991
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:39,000
It kind of has that very similar gameplay with the whole mechanic where you have a timer and you make the fruit appear when you are situated a certain way.

992
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
It just really reminds me of that.

993
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
So kind of another version of that.

994
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Anyway.

995
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
It's not really a bad game.

996
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
It's just a little frustrating.

997
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
It's a little dated too.

998
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
I would say it's this other kind of thing.

999
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
You know, some classic game of the weeks are forever.

1000
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
This is a little dated if you go back and play it.

1001
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,000
It is, but you know, we still have to appreciate the classics.

1002
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Of course, of course.

1003
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Alright, especially with Super Smash Brothers and everything.

1004
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Yes, that was the other thing.

1005
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
That is actually the reason why I picked this game.

1006
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Is because in Super Smash Brothers there is a Pac-Land fighting level.

1007
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,000
So it was like one of the mini games.

1008
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,000
So I just thought I'd throw that one out there.

1009
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:21,000
So it does come from an actual game in gaming's past if you didn't already know.

1010
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Indeed.

1011
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Alright, there it is. Your classic game of the week.

1012
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Pac-Land.

1013
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Available everywhere.

1014
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:30,000
It was on every system in the late 80's, early 90's.

1015
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,000
There it is. Pac-Land.

1016
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Unless you had something by Sega.

1017
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Alright, when we come back there is plenty more show to come.

1018
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Including the FUGL question of the week and your calls at 1877 Game OLR.

1019
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

1020
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Our mail bags accumulated two weeks worth of mail.

1021
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:49,000
And we have some more news including Club Nintendo.

1022
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Going to be sunsetting.

1023
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
We'll talk about that and why that's happening.

1024
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,000
And a brand new game from Sid Meier.

1025
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
You know the creator of Civilization.

1026
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Rob needs to go change his pants.

1027
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
That's right, so I need to go change my pants.

1028
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,000
We're going to go take a break.

1029
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,000
We'll be back with more of OrangeLoungeRadio right after this.

1030
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Welcome back everybody to OrangeLoungeRadio.

1031
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Live tonight, episode 584 for January the 25th of 2015.

1032
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Thanks so much for coming back and joining us after we were gone last week.

1033
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
We finally took a break there.

1034
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
We were live every Sunday through the holidays.

1035
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,000
But finally I was like, you know what, I'm going to Seattle.

1036
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
And you know, Jamie and Matt, they deserve a week off as well.

1037
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
So we all took the week off last week.

1038
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:36,000
So hopefully you guys had some other great indie podcasts to help fill the time.

1039
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,000
For your commutes or for your work day or what have you during the week last week.

1040
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
But thanks so much for coming right back over to OrangeLoungeRadio.

1041
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
We do appreciate the support.

1042
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
And I got to tell you guys, I had a really good time in Seattle.

1043
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,000
I don't know how many listeners we have up there.

1044
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
I don't usually see faces and chat from the area.

1045
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
But if I'm neglecting you, I'm so sorry.

1046
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:56,000
I don't always remember every single person and where they live.

1047
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
But I will give my compliments.

1048
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
I had a great time while I was up there.

1049
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
I got to do all the tourist trap stuff.

1050
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Went over to the Space Needle and the Experience Music Project.

1051
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Which, by the way, has over at the EMP, or Experience Music Project,

1052
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:14,000
they actually have an indie games exhibit going on right now inside the music museum.

1053
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:19,000
I mean, you know, with all these, you know, Jimi Hendrix exhibit and Nirvana exhibit.

1054
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:23,000
And an awesome music video exhibit, might I say.

1055
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:30,000
I know those of you guys that have me on Facebook probably saw my picture with the Aha! The Take On Me video cut out.

1056
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
That whole thing, the other thing set up where you take pictures.

1057
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I was like, yes! So that was pretty cool.

1058
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:40,000
But anyway, they had a little room actually dedicated just for, like, indie games and independently developed games.

1059
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:44,000
And that was really cool because there was stuff that was set up that you could play.

1060
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:48,000
And some things that, you know, a lot of you guys have probably heard of or seen before.

1061
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Like, Gone Home was set up in there.

1062
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
But there was some other stuff that even I hadn't heard of before in there too.

1063
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,000
So it was pretty cool just to walk through and see what all is getting a lot of love.

1064
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Because Cindy, uh, Cindy, Seattle, when you get Seattle and Indie and you combine them together, you get Cindy.

1065
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Seattle has a really big Indie scene as does Vancouver.

1066
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,000
It's that whole Pacific Northwest.

1067
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:13,000
And, you know, obviously some big gaming companies up there between Valve and Nintendo and Microsoft.

1068
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
And the fact that they have PAX Prime up there.

1069
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
There's a big, big gaming scene there.

1070
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
So it's pretty cool to see everything represented there.

1071
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:22,000
And I got to see that at the museum.

1072
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
And that was on Sunday even.

1073
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,000
So I think I made a tweet on my personal account where I was just kind of joking.

1074
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,000
And I was saying, even on a night off, I can't help but play some video games.

1075
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,000
And that's what we did.

1076
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Now there was one big game that was being played in Seattle that day.

1077
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Let me tell you.

1078
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Because that Sunday was the same day that big football game was going on up there.

1079
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,000
And people would be crazy about their football up in Seattle.

1080
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Especially with that particular game and how close it was.

1081
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,000
And the fact that Seattle did end up winning it in overtime.

1082
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:58,000
I will tell you, I was, when they won the game, we were on the elevator going up to the top of the Space Needle.

1083
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:02,000
And the elevator operator was like, I have to hear what's going on when we get to the top.

1084
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
I have to know what's going on with the game.

1085
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Because, you know, the locals get really excited that their team is going to the Super Bowl.

1086
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:11,000
So, you know, however you feel about that team or the other teams.

1087
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:16,000
I was laughing at people because Dan was watching a video of people who were leaving the game early.

1088
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Yes. Yes, I heard about that.

1089
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,000
I was like...

1090
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,000
That's what you get.

1091
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,000
It's funny.

1092
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Hey, at least they got out of the parking lot before anybody else.

1093
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Isn't that what's important?

1094
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Alright, anyway, I'll stop talking about my trip and we'll get back into talking about games.

1095
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Let's do some rapid fire news.

1096
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Wait, I got to see what this is.

1097
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Rama in chat says, Sky, you're a wonderful person.

1098
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
I work my co-hosts.

1099
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:46,000
And, you know, there's no reason why Darksire and Loki couldn't have done a show without me.

1100
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,000
But sometimes it's just, you know what, let's just have a wee...

1101
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
I mean, Dark Soccer did have the key to my house.

1102
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,000
She could have come in here and...

1103
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
I was busy petting Sanrio.

1104
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
You guys did a show without me once.

1105
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
It was a while ago. It was when we did the show at your house.

1106
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:02,000
It's a little bit easier when, like, the computer was in my house and I had already been using it for other podcasts.

1107
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Yeah. Yeah.

1108
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:08,000
But I'm taking steps to get things figured out for doing it on my MacBook.

1109
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Yep.

1110
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:15,000
My wife keeps pushing me to have my son on the show because all he does is talk about the video game that he plays.

1111
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
We would love to have your son on the show.

1112
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Julian has been on the show.

1113
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Yeah, but he'd be here for a while.

1114
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:25,000
It would be just, like, and he whines a lot.

1115
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,000
That's what kids do.

1116
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
We'd have to clean up our mouths a little bit, too.

1117
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,000
I'd be the family-friendly OLR edition. Yay!

1118
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
So, we'll do that.

1119
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Maybe for April Fools this year we'll get Bobby Black Wolf to do a show where he swears all night.

1120
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,000
And then we'll do a family-friendly show.

1121
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Now I'm invoking other people into my big plan here.

1122
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Alright, anyway, let's get into some rapid-fire news in all seriousness.

1123
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
No foolin', there is a lot of other news that happened this week, right, Loki?

1124
01:37:53,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Yeah, so no surprise that they're going to be re-releasing Borderlands 2 and Borderlands the Pre-Sequel on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1125
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:09,000
And the collection will be coming out on March 24th in North America and everywhere else on the 27th.

1126
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
And it's the Handsome Collection.

1127
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:15,000
And it includes, like I said, Borderlands 2 and the Pre-Sequel with all DLC.

1128
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
And they'll be for $60.

1129
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:25,000
I hope that's actually all DLC and not just, like, oh yeah, it's some of the DLC but, you know, some of the other DLC in there.

1130
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:29,000
You're going to have to purchase separately, like they do sometimes.

1131
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Also, if you happen to be really a rabid fan of the series, they had 5,000 Claptrap, or just the Handsome Collection, Claptrap in a Box edition that was retailing at $399.

1132
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,000
That would come with everything that was in the regular bundle.

1133
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Plus, a remote-controlled Claptrap Steward Robot, a collectible steel case, and 12 exclusive lithographs.

1134
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,000
However, as far as I'm aware, those are all sold out already.

1135
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:05,000
So, people love them. They're Claptraps.

1136
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:09,000
And, yeah, no surprise that those come out.

1137
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Kind of wish that they had thrown the original Borderlands in there as well, but I don't know, I guess, for whatever reason they decided not to.

1138
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:30,000
And then to go along with that, they've got some more DLC coming for Borderlands the Pre-Sequel, including another playable character with Lady Hammerlock, who is the sister of Sir Hammerlock in the game.

1139
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:35,000
And you'll be able to download that on January 27th.

1140
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:44,000
And she apparently is also included as part of the season pass, so if you do have that, you don't need to purchase her, but otherwise, she is $999.

1141
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
I don't know, interesting.

1142
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:57,000
And then there's this cool website that you can check out that calculates how much time it would take you to finish your Steam library.

1143
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:06,000
It's a website called Steam Left, so steamleft.com, and you put in your Steam information, and it will look at your library and tell you how much time.

1144
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:11,000
If I remember correctly, I think I had like 1200 hours or something like that.

1145
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:17,000
It says I could watch, they give you little statistics on the bottom there, it's like, you could.

1146
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
I'm really afraid, what's the website?

1147
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Steamleft.com, and it's all like, for mine, they're all, you could watch the entire series of Friends 29 times.

1148
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:33,000
I'm like, no, I would not want to watch this series of Friends 29 times.

1149
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Oh god, nevermind.

1150
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
You beat me.

1151
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:50,000
So it would take me 2599 continuous hours, that's 108 days, 7 hours and 49 minutes to complete my Steam library.

1152
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:55,000
I could watch the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy 228 times.

1153
01:40:55,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Oh, I could listen to Weird Al's Albuquerque 12999 times.

1154
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Wait, was this URL again?

1155
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Oh, actually, nevermind. Mine is a little higher than I thought it was, I was remembering days.

1156
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
You actually have been beat by 9 hours, though.

1157
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
I'm 2590.

1158
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Steamleft.com, DarkSira.

1159
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Alright, hold on.

1160
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Here it is.

1161
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
107 days, 22 hours and 40 minutes.

1162
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:23,000
And Bobby says if you hover over the words continuous hours, you get a little Easter egg.

1163
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Love that, I'm not going to give it away, that's great.

1164
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:34,000
1770 continuous hours, or 73 days, 18 hours and 46 minutes.

1165
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,000
In this time, you could have made this web app 129 times.

1166
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:41,000
I could have watched the whole series of Breaking Bad 42 times.

1167
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Performed to open heart surgery 647 times.

1168
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Alright, we're all having a cry, next story.

1169
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Oh, this is actually awesome.

1170
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:53,000
I could have listened to Rush's 2112 album 2724 times.

1171
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
You gonna go see their 40th anniversary tour in San Jose?

1172
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,000
I wish.

1173
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
I'd go. You wanna go?

1174
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
I'm broke.

1175
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
I could have also lived out one lifespan as an ant.

1176
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Alright, now let's move on.

1177
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Okay, Rob, let's go see Rush.

1178
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Okay, yay.

1179
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,000
If it's not expensive.

1180
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Alright, so this is pretty sweet.

1181
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,000
It's not sold out already.

1182
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:12,000
This is actually something I tried back when they had a beta for it, but I never really got into it.

1183
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,000
And then, which is probably good because then it got shortly shut down afterwards.

1184
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,000
And then it came back, but I never went back to it.

1185
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:24,000
But this is the PC MMO All Points Bulletin Reloaded is now coming to consoles.

1186
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:29,000
And they're going to be launching on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in the second quarter of this year.

1187
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
And it will be free to play still.

1188
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
And you can check it out.

1189
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:38,000
And it's kind of along the lines of the first or second Saints Row games.

1190
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:41,000
And they say World of Warcraft mixed together.

1191
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:45,000
I don't know if I'd really call it that, but it's kind of cool.

1192
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:49,000
You either get to take the side of the gang members or the police.

1193
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:56,000
And then you can do missions where the early missions, any of the enemies that are in there are other players.

1194
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:03,000
So as you're pulling bigger heists, you get more heat on you and then more of the police or whatever come after you.

1195
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
So it's kind of cool.

1196
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
But that will be coming out later on this year.

1197
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:10,000
And I will definitely have to check that out since it's free to play.

1198
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Alright.

1199
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Not free, but still pretty cool nonetheless.

1200
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
New DLC for Theatrhythm.

1201
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:21,000
This is awesome because people were thinking Theatrhythm was kind of done with DLC.

1202
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:24,000
I believe Square even came out and said we're done with DLC.

1203
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:28,000
And then they started releasing a little more and people are eating it up.

1204
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:34,000
And it's because they're doing music from other Square Enix games, which is doing very, very well.

1205
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Music from The World Ends With You came to Theatrhythm in this last DLC bundle.

1206
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Twister and Calling were two of the new tracks released for the 3DS game.

1207
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Let's see. Also, Liberi Fatali from Final Fantasy VIII.

1208
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Final Confrontation from Romancing Saga 3.

1209
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:59,000
And World Revolution from Chrono Trigger as well as Wind Scene from Chrono Trigger all made its way into Theatrhythm.

1210
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:03,000
So it's still giving Square money to release these songs.

1211
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
So I wonder if we're going to see more and more and more.

1212
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Because who knows if that Dragon Quest Theatrhythm game is ever coming out here.

1213
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
I don't know.

1214
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
So yeah, that's pretty cool.

1215
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:16,000
I have reason to be checking Theatrhythm every week.

1216
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:24,000
I have reason to check Steam on February 5th because this cool little game, Castle in the Darkness, which is by Nasalis.

1217
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,000
I hope I said that right.

1218
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:28,000
It's the folks that made 1001 Spikes, which I know I've played that before.

1219
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:32,000
But Castle in the Darkness will be coming out on February 5th.

1220
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:37,000
It will be $6 and it's an action adventure game with damning difficulty.

1221
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Which doesn't surprise me whatsoever.

1222
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:43,000
And I know some of y'all love your retro games with their damning difficulty.

1223
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Right, Dark Tetsuya? You listening? I know you're a fan.

1224
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Alright, many of you love your very hard retro games.

1225
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Many of you love your fighting games as well.

1226
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:54,000
And I know many, many, many of you love to watch EVO.

1227
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:58,000
So EVO 2015 is coming.

1228
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:02,000
It's going to be happening with several fighting games.

1229
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Two of them being Smash Brothers related.

1230
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Smash Brothers Melee and Smash Brothers for Wii U.

1231
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Both a part of this July 17th through 19th at Bally's Las Vegas Casino.

1232
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Where this is going to happen.

1233
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:23,000
That's pretty cool because you might remember last year, Nintendo was very much not really going to be a part of this.

1234
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Was it two years ago that they didn't do this?

1235
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Yeah, two years ago Nintendo wanted Melee out of the competition and then they got it back in this last year.

1236
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:35,000
And now I think Nintendo, I want to say Nintendo is like a sponsor of this now.

1237
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
That's why there's two of them in the games. That's pretty cool.

1238
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Some of the other fighting games involved, of course Ultra Street Fighter IV, of course Ultimate MVC3.

1239
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Mortal Kombat X will be in it, Tekken 7 will be in it, Guilty Gear XRD, Killer Instinct, and Persona 4 Arena Ultima X.

1240
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,000
All going to be a part of this.

1241
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:58,000
So a lot of fighting game fans are very excited for this coming up this July.

1242
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

1243
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Well, I've got some pretty, not really surprising stuff.

1244
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Amplitude actually is not going to be out in March like they said.

1245
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:15,000
It has been delayed until summer for quality reasons.

1246
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:22,000
So I would rather it be delayed and be awesome than come out in March and be crap and have all of us go, heh heh.

1247
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:25,000
But we can wait.

1248
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
The world can wait.

1249
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Also, Geoff Keighley says that the Game Awards will be back later this year.

1250
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
No shit.

1251
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Well, they weren't so bad for a first year show.

1252
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:44,000
I know we talked about it to death the week it happened, but you know, it did a lot of things right.

1253
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:51,000
It wasn't perfect, but if they can bring back Roberta Williams one more time, and again, I would love that, but that probably won't happen.

1254
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
They'll be on their yacht somewhere.

1255
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Also, now I know they pronounce it GLAAD, but because it has two A's, I always wanted to call it GLAAD.

1256
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Basically, they're giving a special recognition to BioWare for Dragon Age Inquisition for its representation of LGBT.

1257
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:16,000
And I'm going to say Q, A, etc. characters in Dragon Age Inquisition.

1258
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Especially, I mean, if no one's played this game, there is probably one of the few positive depictions of a transgender character in a game.

1259
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:42,000
And then, they also gave kudos to The Last of Us DLC Left Behind because of how it explored Ellie and Riley.

1260
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
So, there you go.

1261
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:53,000
And of course, the Dragon Age Twitter is like, hell yeah, thank you. Well, actually, they said, we are proud to be nominated for an at GLAAD Media Award.

1262
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:57,000
But that's just PR speak for hell yeah.

1263
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Yeah, PR speak for damn right.

1264
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,000
I can't say damn straight, I'm saying damn skippy.

1265
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Alright, let's go to our FUGL question of the week.

1266
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Every week, we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google communities over at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio and google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.

1267
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:30,000
We ask a question and usually, when we have guests on the show, I like to theme the question around whoever our guest is.

1268
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:41,000
So, tonight, of course, we had Eric from Rockedge S.J. and we were talking about, you know, what's coming up in a couple weeks here and why people should go to this music and retro gaming celebration.

1269
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Well, we asked our listeners this week, what has been your favorite convention or gamer gathering that you have ever attended and why?

1270
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:55,000
And I want to make clear, it doesn't matter if it was a huge national thing like PAX or whatever or if it was like small local con.

1271
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
So, I just want to know what was your favorite experience.

1272
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:05,000
So, we have a few answers here and we have Fabrice A. who, as you know, is one of our listeners over in Belgium.

1273
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:12,000
So, he responds and says, only been to PAX in Belgium. It's a sci-fi convention with some games on the side.

1274
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,000
They did have six pinball machines this year, which was nice.

1275
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Also, some arcade cabinets and some retro game stuff.

1276
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Sadly, it's also the only convention that is anywhere near where I live.

1277
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Well, I'll tell you what, Fabrice, if we had the budget, I would bring the first O.L.R. Con to Belgium. I would.

1278
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Dark Soccer, you'd be down, right? O.L.R. Con in Belgium?

1279
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Will there be waffles?

1280
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Absolutely.

1281
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,000
And Belgian ale?

1282
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Absolutely.

1283
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:39,000
I want to actually go to a trappista brewery and get it right.

1284
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:44,000
I want to go to the Chamay, I want to go talk to the monks at the Chamay place and have them give me beer.

1285
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Someday, right after I win the lottery. Someday.

1286
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Andy R. says, my first time at Fanime in 2006.

1287
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:55,000
It helps that it was also, that was probably the last time we did a panel there was 2006.

1288
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
No, it was later than that, but anyway.

1289
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:01,000
My first time at Fanime, it helps that it was also my first anime convention overall.

1290
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:06,000
I've been at Fanime every year since and I don't think it's ever quite captured the magic of my first time.

1291
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Doesn't help that the con has ballooned out of control and now has huge lines for everything now.

1292
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Flacco Jones replies and says, my first BlizzCon.

1293
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
It was only the second BlizzCon ever.

1294
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Got to meet guildies in person and the closing concert was Video Games Live, who I'd never seen before.

1295
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:26,000
It also wasn't as crowded since they only had about half the space they use now and the goodie bag was amazing.

1296
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Does sound like BlizzCon was really awesome back in its heyday, now it's too damn expensive.

1297
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
That's my opinion.

1298
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Bryce H. replies and says, I have never attended a convention of any sort,

1299
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:41,000
but I am trying to attend the Too Many Games convention in Philadelphia this June.

1300
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Well good luck, hope you make it.

1301
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Dartitsuya says, although I wouldn't consider it a gaming convention per se,

1302
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:53,000
WonderCon 2010-2011 did have playable previews of games from the likes of Capcom and Nintendo.

1303
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Playing Final Fight Double Impact and Kid Icarus Uprising before their respective release dates was pretty awesome.

1304
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:05,000
I think some people would consider things like Comic Con maybe one of the best things they've been to and that's not necessarily gaming.

1305
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:08,000
One of my favorites was my first Dragon Con.

1306
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:14,000
So that wasn't specifically gaming, but I had a great time on my first trip to Atlanta and last year too.

1307
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Let's see, going over to our Google Plus page and checking out some of the answers there.

1308
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:23,000
I don't know if we had any responses over on Google Plus.

1309
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Did I not post to Google Plus? I thought I did.

1310
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Ooh, got dissed.

1311
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:35,000
I dissed Google Plus this week inadvertently.

1312
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,000
I'm sorry guys.

1313
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Forgetting my stories and then forgetting Google Plus.

1314
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:42,000
I'm falling apart a week off and I can't do anything.

1315
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:46,000
You know what I did? I bet I posted it on my personal.

1316
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,000
I bet you did.

1317
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
I bet anything that's what I did.

1318
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:54,000
I probably posted it on my personal Google Plus page, not the OLR Google Plus page.

1319
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Womp womp. Oh well.

1320
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Oh Rob.

1321
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,000
I know, I'm a failure.

1322
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Or you just didn't post it.

1323
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Or I just didn't post it.

1324
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:04,000
I wrote the post all up and everything. What the hell?

1325
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,000
I blame Google.

1326
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Dammit.

1327
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:10,000
First, Ingress problems and now this.

1328
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
I'm having some serious Google problems this week.

1329
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Sorry Google. I apologize.

1330
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, nobody uses Google Plus, not even Rob.

1331
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:23,000
I swear I went and wrote the post there. I just didn't click submit or something.

1332
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
What a fail on my part.

1333
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Well I apologize to all you guys that are loyal to Google Plus for forgetting you this week.

1334
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
All two of you.

1335
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Next time, hey, next time if you notice I don't post the question by a certain time on Sunday, send me a tweet or something.

1336
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Or use Facebook.

1337
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Yeah, Darkticity in chat says, geez Rob, you take a week off and everything falls apart. Ain't that the truth?

1338
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:50,000
DarkSoccer, you've probably been more cons than anyone else in the room. What was your favorite?

1339
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Good lord.

1340
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:57,000
I would probably say the one that, I mean, I really loved Faname when Ranma came out. That was great.

1341
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:02,000
I had a great, great time. Especially when he got to experience first hand my initial D driving.

1342
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:08,000
But my favorite con all together was Anime Expo 2000.

1343
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
That was at the Disneyland Hotel.

1344
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Where a bunch of cosplayers got kicked out of Disneyland for cosplaying at Disneyland.

1345
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:19,000
And it was also my first experience with the DDR machine.

1346
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:23,000
It was also the con of the chair.

1347
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Where basically it turned into a big joke the entire convention but there was a chair left up on the stage.

1348
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:34,000
And everyone just started chanting for the chair. So they put a chair on the DDR machine.

1349
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,000
And we had video of chair playing DDR.

1350
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:42,000
We had, it was just a great con. The whole con was great.

1351
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,000
I cosplayed as Jill Valentine.

1352
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:51,000
And Mad Hatter from, no that wasn't the year I did Mad Hatter.

1353
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
No, that was the year I did Jill.

1354
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
And Leona from King of Fighters.

1355
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
And walked around in combat boots.

1356
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:03,000
And then I couldn't walk for the next three days because I was wearing somebody else's combat boots.

1357
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
It was a great con.

1358
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Logie, what about you?

1359
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Probably the one year I went to PAX. That was fun.

1360
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:14,000
I don't know, you're the first fan of me.

1361
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Because that was when I first saw DDR fourth mix.

1362
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:21,000
You know, PAX probably would have been my answer too.

1363
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Because that was when we were still with All Games Network.

1364
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:27,000
And we were doing the broadcasting with some of the other shows there.

1365
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:30,000
All in part of actual PAX itself.

1366
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:35,000
And it was really cool to kind of be spending the con kind of quote unquote working.

1367
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:38,000
But it was really fun and kind of a new way to expose ourselves to a different audience.

1368
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
So that was really fun. Just that whole experience.

1369
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,000
And the fact that Logie, Dark Soccer and I all took that trip together.

1370
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
And kind of all experienced that.

1371
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
I don't know if we'll ever get to do something like that again.

1372
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:50,000
So that was really cool that we got to do something like Penny Arcade Expo together.

1373
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,000
That was 2008.

1374
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:54,000
And that year was a real shit year for me personally.

1375
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Because that was the year I got really sick, remember?

1376
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:00,000
PAX was in between when I went to the hospital and when I had the surgery.

1377
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
So that was kind of a crap year for me personally.

1378
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,000
But PAX was definitely a highlight of 08.

1379
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
So I'll use my runner up answer.

1380
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Which would be, again a very similar experience, would be E3.

1381
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Which isn't really a con, I know.

1382
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:15,000
But it's still what I'm going to say. Deal with it.

1383
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:19,000
E3, the last big crazy year, which was 2006.

1384
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Even though there were way too many people at E3 itself.

1385
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
I got to cut the Wii line, which was awesome.

1386
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:28,000
And I'm thankful to my connection to this day for helping me do that.

1387
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:34,000
And that was also, again, coming together with other shows.

1388
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:38,000
When All Games had that arena lounge, well it wasn't theirs.

1389
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:41,000
But they worked very closely with the guy at Arena Lounge.

1390
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:45,000
It was like a giant frat house for video game stuff.

1391
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:48,000
And that was a fun year. It was a lot of fun that year.

1392
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,000
And again, you know, I think we all went.

1393
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
I think we all went. Didn't you go that year too?

1394
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,000
I went.

1395
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Yeah, we all went to that together. That was a lot of fun.

1396
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:00,000
So you know, those days sadly are probably behind us.

1397
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Where all three of us get to go to these events and have a lot of fun.

1398
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Because we all have our own lives and stuff.

1399
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:07,000
But those are some great memories. So that would be my answer.

1400
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
That's why they have the update E3 on PSP.

1401
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Oh yes, was that that year too?

1402
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
That was that year.

1403
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,000
That was awesome. That was a great thing you did that year.

1404
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Alright, let's move on. We got some more gaming news to get to before we get to the mailbag and the FUs of the week.

1405
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
PodCulture says, why not DragonCon? Shame on you.

1406
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:29,000
I said that a minute ago during some of the other responses where somebody had said WonderCon.

1407
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:32,000
I said, well DragonCon was one of my favorites.

1408
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:35,000
And that really was one of my favorites too.

1409
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Alright, let's move on with some more news. Loki.

1410
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Alright, so I guess this is kind of sad for fans of Nintendo.

1411
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
But they're getting rid of Club Nintendo.

1412
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:49,000
Sorry, you're not cool enough to be in the club anymore.

1413
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:54,000
But it really hasn't been what it used to be for a long time now.

1414
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:58,000
They started skimping on with the rewards and everything.

1415
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:01,000
I don't know, so now they're getting rid of that.

1416
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:12,000
And apparently to go along with that they're also adding new rewards for downloadable games to help members clear out their coin balances.

1417
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,000
That kind of thing.

1418
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:20,000
And I guess you'll have until September 30th to use up those coins.

1419
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,000
So that kind of sucks.

1420
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:26,000
But they are going to be doing something else.

1421
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Some other loyalty program.

1422
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
So I guess we'll have to see what that is.

1423
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:37,000
It's interesting that this is coming on the heels of the Digital Deluxe promotion also ending.

1424
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:42,000
So it really seems like a good time for Nintendo to hit the reset button on their loyalty program.

1425
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
It'll be interesting to see what comes of it.

1426
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:49,000
But you're right. A lot of people were giving the Club Nintendo thing shit when it was all the digital rewards.

1427
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:52,000
And people were like, what happened to the cool limited stuff?

1428
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:55,000
So obviously Nintendo probably has to change things a little bit.

1429
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:56,000
So we'll see.

1430
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,000
I wonder if Virtual Console games are going to play into the reward.

1431
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Like maybe the new reward system will just straight up be like Virtual Console Redemption.

1432
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Who knows?

1433
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Anything's possible, I suppose.

1434
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Gosh. Am I still able to cash in all the stuff I still have sitting around?

1435
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Until September.

1436
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Oh good. Then I'll have to do that.

1437
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Earlier in the show we were talking about Guild Wars.

1438
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Guild Wars 2 specifically.

1439
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Guild Wars 2 of course on a big sale this weekend.

1440
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:26,000
And I keep meaning to go back and check out this game.

1441
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Because again it is nice that it's one of those games where once you bought it you can go back and play it whenever you want.

1442
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:34,000
So I've been meaning to go back and check out some Guild Wars 2.

1443
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:37,000
And it sounds like Dark Soccer might be meeting me there very soon.

1444
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:44,000
But Guild Wars 2 is going to get a lot more interested people with the announcement of their first expansion.

1445
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Heart of Thorns was announced at PAX South.

1446
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Guild Wars 2 Heart of Thorns is going to be the first expansion for Guild Wars 2.

1447
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:57,000
And it will be continuing of course the Guild Wars 2 storyline.

1448
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:01,000
And it will be bringing out the mastery system.

1449
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:04,000
New training opportunities for your character beyond level 80.

1450
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Master abilities like hang gliding in the jungle and building new collections that work towards a legendary weapon.

1451
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Something called the Heart of the Maguuma Jungle.

1452
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Specializations coming as well.

1453
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Revenant which is a new profession.

1454
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
And Guild Halls will be coming to the game as well.

1455
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
It's a new mode for PvP.

1456
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:30,000
World vs. World place called the Borderland which is epic battlefield combat.

1457
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:33,000
The Borderlands map is coming to the game as well.

1458
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Lots and lots coming to Guild Wars 2.

1459
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:40,000
I haven't played that game since it first first came out and I imagine so much changed.

1460
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:44,000
I know they do little additions to it here and there so I gotta check that out.

1461
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Pow in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says,

1462
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:52,000
I've been playing Guild Wars 2 all day and watching Golden Girls in the background.

1463
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Hashtag not sorry.

1464
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:57,000
You sound like you've honestly had the perfect day, Pow.

1465
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
That might be a perfect day right there.

1466
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
That's awesome.

1467
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

1468
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Well, I have creepy shit.

1469
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
And by creepy shit I mean fucking creepy.

1470
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
And awesome.

1471
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Basically, there's a team of German scientists called the Cognitive Modeling Group at the University of Tübingen in Germany.

1472
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:25,000
And they have used an artificial intelligence to make Mario self aware.

1473
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Basically, he can think for himself.

1474
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:31,000
It's called Mario Lives with an exclamation point.

1475
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:35,000
And they've put a video up of them telling Mario,

1476
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:38,000
If you jump on a Goomba, it will die.

1477
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
What happens if you jump on a Goomba?

1478
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
It will surely die.

1479
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:45,000
Or he can figure it out for himself and he says,

1480
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
The Goomba may die maybe.

1481
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:58,000
So as it goes on, as he experiences things, he actually builds awareness of the world around him through how he experiences it or speaks to people.

1482
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:05,000
And he also has emotive states that let him be happy or afraid or even hungry.

1483
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
When he's hungry, he goes after coins.

1484
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:12,000
It's just really kind of scary.

1485
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Did anyone try asking him when Mario Galaxy 3 would come out already?

1486
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Well, he'd know, right?

1487
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
He's aware.

1488
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
He's aware, isn't he?

1489
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:28,000
In his environment of Super Mario World.

1490
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:32,000
I think it's Super Mario World.

1491
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:36,000
But the voice that they gave him is really creepy.

1492
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:40,000
I would play some of it, but I'm not the one hooked up to the recorder.

1493
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
Oh, I'm sorry. Was that a hint?

1494
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Am I supposed to play a little bit of this?

1495
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Well, there's a lot of narration through this video, too, so I don't know where the parts are where they actually have Mario talking.

1496
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
It's not too far in, I don't think.

1497
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Let's see.

1498
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
I'm trying to find you a timestamp.

1499
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:57,000
This is a fantastic library.

1500
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
Right around 22.

1501
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Alright, let's take a look here.

1502
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Hello, Mario.

1503
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Hello.

1504
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
As most of you know, this is Mario.

1505
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:14,000
But what you do not know is that this Mario has become aware of himself and his environment, at least to a certain extent.

1506
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:17,000
I wonder how Mario feels about that.

1507
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Let's just ask.

1508
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Mario, how do you feel?

1509
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
I feel very good.

1510
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
Mario develops schema-based...

1511
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Okay!

1512
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Yeah.

1513
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Creepy! Creepy!

1514
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Mario is the new Cyberdyne.

1515
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:39,000
We're going to all be stomped on by Italian plumbers.

1516
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:43,000
ActDeftInChat says they should have hired Charles Martinet.

1517
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:47,000
PowInChat says it sounds like Hal, so creepy.

1518
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
I like that. That's great.

1519
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:55,000
FifthDream says I'll be back. My princess is in another castle.

1520
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Oh, that would have been a good question to ask Mario.

1521
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Which castle is the princess in?

1522
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
The answer?

1523
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Another one.

1524
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Is it this one?

1525
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
DungeonBust...

1526
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Excuse me, I'm choking.

1527
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:13,000
DungeonBusterInChat says I don't think you should be talking to the princess, Dave.

1528
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Alright, let's move on.

1529
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Lowkey.

1530
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Steam broadcasting.

1531
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:25,000
That hasn't been around for a very long time, but now it's exited its beta.

1532
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Hooray!

1533
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:35,000
The service will only broadcast gameplay video by default through players.

1534
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:43,000
Though players can opt to stream a video of other apps on their computer, allowing them to broadcast other things like instructional videos and whatnot.

1535
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
So that's kind of cool.

1536
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:53,000
And it also records the audio that plays through the speakers on the broadcaster's computer.

1537
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
I don't know. Exciting stuff.

1538
02:03:55,000 --> 02:04:03,000
So they're saying that basically you can use this kind of like Twitch now and not just stream games, but you can also kind of stream yourself, which is neat.

1539
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Oh, they finally put the camera stuff in there?

1540
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Well, not the camera stuff, but it says that you can stream other apps other than just games.

1541
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
Wasn't that how people were streaming porn and stuff?

1542
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:21,000
It was. They were playing Windows Media Player and streaming things like anime and porn and stuff.

1543
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
I don't know if maybe they blocked that or what they did.

1544
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Well, you know, it's inevitable there's going to be porn.

1545
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
There's always going to be porn.

1546
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Alright, are you going to experiment by broadcasting anything on Steam broadcasting?

1547
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
That means I play my Steam butt.

1548
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Maybe eventually someday.

1549
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:43,000
I have mine on whenever I play Steam games. I have it so that only friends can look at it.

1550
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:49,000
I did turn it off when I was doing Five Nights at Freddy's because sometimes I want it to stream through Twitch.

1551
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:53,000
But if you see me on Steam playing games, you can always watch.

1552
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:57,000
It doesn't mean I'm going to commentate and entertain. You can just peek at the game.

1553
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
I'll buy you the second one if you stream it while I'm watching.

1554
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:05,000
I actually, Loki got it for me for, oh wait, 13, oh sorry, Five Nights at Freddy's.

1555
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:08,000
The last game I streamed on Steam was Final Fantasy 13.

1556
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
So Loki got me Final Fantasy 13 too.

1557
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
But I do not have Five Nights at Freddy's 2.

1558
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:18,000
But if you'd like to donate that to the Watch Rob Play Scary Games Fund, then I guess I'll take it.

1559
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Oh no, Dark Soccer is wiggling your eyebrows at me. Uh oh. Uh oh. Alright.

1560
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:26,000
I want you to play it while eating.

1561
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Yeah.

1562
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:28,000
That's going to be hilarious.

1563
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Only if I can eat cheap pizza.

1564
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:33,000
Cheap pizza. You have to do it while eating Little Caesars.

1565
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Yeah.

1566
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
That itself is scary.

1567
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:41,000
No, no, no, no. What you should do is you should have to actually go down to Chuck E. Cheese and order pizza.

1568
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Who gets pizza from Chuck E. Cheese to go?

1569
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:47,000
That's it. I'll put Five Nights at Freddy's 2 on my laptop.

1570
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:48,000
There are people.

1571
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
You will play it on my computer at Chuck E. Cheese's.

1572
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:51,000
Alright, fine.

1573
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:52,000
And we'll stream it.

1574
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,000
Fine.

1575
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:57,000
Marissa Congusto is in our chat saying, uh, back in my day-

1576
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:58,000
I love you Marissa!

1577
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Me too. Back in my day we only had porn animated gifs and we liked it.

1578
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,000
That's right.

1579
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:11,000
That's where, that'd be a great location, well if they probably haven't bulldozed the place, which I'm sure they have, but like, you know, um, Bullwinkles.

1580
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:12,000
You know.

1581
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Cause that place is still all retro-y and have the old animatronics.

1582
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:28,000
Alright, well, anyway, um, I'm trying to move on to another story here, but unfortunately, uh, my, uh, Firefox crashed on me while I was trying to pull up this next story.

1583
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:29,000
Damn you Firefox.

1584
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:30,000
What?

1585
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:31,000
The damn you Firefox.

1586
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:32,000
That's what you get for not using Chrome.

1587
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Pro- pretty much. I think I might need to put Chrome on this computer actually. I'm a little worried about it.

1588
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:42,000
Anyway, uh, okay, good. I was able to reopen all the tabs right where I left off.

1589
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:45,000
So, uh, anyway, uh, here's the thing.

1590
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Is that I try to be as impartial as possible on this show.

1591
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:53,000
You know, I try to keep an open mind to all the video games.

1592
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:59,000
And I try not to fanboy out too much about any one particular franchise or game or so forth.

1593
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:04,000
But once in a while there's gonna be that developer who announces a new game.

1594
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:11,000
And sure enough that happened this week where Sid Meier has announced a new game called Starships.

1595
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
And I couldn't help myself.

1596
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Yep. Not gonna lie. I'll probably buy it just because it has Sid Meier's names on it.

1597
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:33,000
But look, the guy did, the guy did Railroad Tycoon. He did Civilization.

1598
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
I even will defend Covert Action.

1599
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Sid Meier does a lot, a lot of great stuff.

1600
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:44,000
So of course I'm gonna check out the new game Starships, which I'd love to tell you more about.

1601
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:49,000
But it's crashing my computer consistently here, the page here.

1602
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:52,000
So I do know it's a turn-based strategy game.

1603
02:07:52,000 --> 02:08:00,000
I have heard that it's supposed to tie in somehow to the Beyond Earth, Civilization Beyond Earth.

1604
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:04,000
It's supposed to tie into that somehow, although they haven't said a lot about how that's gonna work.

1605
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:10,000
It will be coming out for PC, Mac, and iPad, and it's actually coming out this year.

1606
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:16,000
So I'm excited to learn more about this game. I'm sure they're gonna show plenty more at E3 about this game.

1607
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Anybody else interested in Sid Meier's games like I am? Anybody?

1608
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:22,000
Chirp.

1609
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:23,000
No?

1610
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:24,000
Chirp.

1611
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Anybody in chat? Somebody's gotta be.

1612
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Chirp, chirp.

1613
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Rob, I'm sure you will find other people who enjoy these games as much as you do.

1614
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:38,000
I know, I know. Well, Starships anyway was based on Sid Meier wanting to extend the Beyond Earth setting,

1615
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:44,000
where he says this is gonna be a further narrative of the game, where you'll be able to explore the universe,

1616
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:48,000
and you'll encounter other human colonies and whatever those colonies may hold.

1617
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:53,000
This game will focus on starship creation, meaning that your ships are gonna be very configurable,

1618
02:08:53,000 --> 02:09:00,000
and there'll be space combat, of course, and so there'll be a universe filled with interstellar adventure, diplomacy, and exploration.

1619
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:06,000
So this sounds like it's gonna be awesome. So it sounds a little bit like maybe like if Civ was in space,

1620
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:10,000
as opposed to just on the planet's surface, like you see happen in Beyond Earth.

1621
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:16,000
And yes, they are saying there will be cross-connectivity features with Beyond Earth if you own both titles.

1622
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:21,000
So that's very, very cool. So I'm excited to check in that out, Sid Meier's Starships.

1623
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Nothing to do with the Nicki Minaj song, just so we're clear. Just so we're clear.

1624
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Alright, let's move on. What do we have next? Is Mailbag coming up next, I think?

1625
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:32,000
I guess.

1626
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Alright, so every week...

1627
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:35,000
It's crunchy this time.

1628
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:38,000
I don't know, because my show roll closed when Firefox crashed.

1629
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
So anyway...

1630
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Oh, what, you want the music?

1631
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
No, I don't care.

1632
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Every week, you guys send us email to participate at orangeloungeradio.com,

1633
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:59,000
and DarkSakura will dive into the mailbag and find an email or four that she thinks,

1634
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:04,000
hey, I'm going to read these, and we're going to respond to them right after I judge them.

1635
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Damn it, why are you sending long ones?

1636
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Alright.

1637
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Thanks for the warning.

1638
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,000
You can always edit the long ones.

1639
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Yeah, whatever.

1640
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Alright, here it is.

1641
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:16,000
DarkSakura, what is in the mailbag? It's had two weeks to build up, so I imagine there's a little bit in there tonight.

1642
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:17,000
All four of them?

1643
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
That's twice what we usually get.

1644
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:20,000
Welcome back.

1645
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:24,000
I apologize that my last scenario came across as more perverse than intended.

1646
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Oh, yes.

1647
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Especially as posed to relative strangers.

1648
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:35,000
The hypothetical nudity was gratuitous, but meant less as sexy and more as starting out with absolutely nothing,

1649
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
which we figured out.

1650
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Perhaps I could have specified basic clothes that offered no significant protection from the elements or pockets,

1651
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
but never mind that now.

1652
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:55,000
My family uses 120GB PlayStation 3, which I believe I purchased about the year of the collector's edition of the original LittleBigPlanet 2009,

1653
02:10:55,000 --> 02:11:02,000
as their Netflix console and will sometimes leave it powered on or accidentally turn it back on for extended periods of time.

1654
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:10,000
Whether this is causing any harm, I'm not sure, but more and more frequently my system is starting up with a warning of improper shutdown

1655
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:17,000
and performing a check for possible corrupted files, or I am prompted to reset the system clock and the theme.

1656
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:24,000
I have had a flashing yellow power light in one case, requiring me to power down or power back up by unplugging the console.

1657
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:33,000
I'm worried that the system will stop working altogether sooner rather than later, and I know I'm not ready to upgrade to a PS4 with a library of PS3 games I have.

1658
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:49,000
I have a few purchased episodes of Mythbusters on it, and remember Reginator's Trouble with video licenses, but I haven't purchased enough episodes for it to be a major concern if I lose access to those.

1659
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:58,000
I am seriously considering getting a Vita as a current gen portable console, and do have several cross-buy titles that I could port over.

1660
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:09,000
I will be going on a major vacation in June, and that would help somewhat. Would my money be better used, though, upgrading and moving content over to a 500GB PS3, especially considering Vita memory card prices?

1661
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:21,000
Would replacing the hard drive give the system new life? Should I try to find somewhere to service the console I have, ideally someone who wouldn't try to create a cooling baffle by taping pizza coupons inside?

1662
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Or are the issues I've described somehow less serious than I fear? This is well out of warranty, so sending it to Sony probably wouldn't help. Thank you for any advice you're able to offer, except for my iPod Robert M.

1663
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:39,000
I wouldn't repair it. I'd get a new PS3.

1664
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:46,000
I would suggest either the new PlayStation 3. They are coming way down in price, so you might be able to find one for a pretty good deal.

1665
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:55,000
One option that you left out was the PlayStation TV. Those are only $80 right now. I saw one at Target the other day.

1666
02:12:55,000 --> 02:13:04,000
You wouldn't be able to take that on your trip, but if you're considering going the Vita route and you want to still have some of your video licenses and so forth, that may be one option for you.

1667
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:10,000
I just noticed you left that out, and it's a pretty cheap alternative, so that's just an idea. It would be a PlayStation TV.

1668
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:19,000
Although, of course, I am hearing mixed things on that, but again, your video licenses. I thought all you would have to do is log in and you could just re-download those things.

1669
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Yeah, it is. That's all you have to do. You literally have to just...

1670
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:25,000
But remember, Raginator had gigs and gigs and gigs of stuff.

1671
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:29,000
Raginator is also a special snowflake. Heart, heart, heart.

1672
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Yeah, he's going to Sony Entertainment Store, and you can...

1673
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:52,000
Well, what you probably want to do first... Well, actually, what I had to do of mine is you basically revoke all the licenses on your system, so it basically detaches your account from all the systems, and then you just go back on there and reconnect it to the new system that you get, and then you can just download all your content.

1674
02:13:52,000 --> 02:14:04,000
I think, too, something you need to consider is how much are you playing those PS3 games, and are there more that you plan on playing, because the amount of new PlayStation 3 games is going to slow down significantly, because they are really shifting focus.

1675
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:05,000
It already has, yeah.

1676
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Yeah, they're already shifting focus to PlayStation 4. I mean, that Kingdom Hearts 2.5, that was like the last big thing coming out for PlayStation 3 that I know of. Is there anything in the near future that's coming out?

1677
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Well, there's still plenty of games that are coming out that are going to have PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game, but less and less of them are, and it's becoming less and less like, you know, Dying Light was originally supposed to have a PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 version, and then they cancelled it.

1678
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:41,000
I think, well, currently, I think that Mad Max is supposed to have that. I don't know.

1679
02:14:41,000 --> 02:15:07,000
You might want to consider, too, I know you say you're not quite ready for PlayStation 4, but you might want to consider, see what happens at E3, especially if the system may get that price cut, because I think what would really be unfortunate is that, let's say in a couple months you get a PlayStation 3, and then all of a sudden at E3, they announce that game that you have to have on PlayStation 4 and all that, but I do certainly see the point about you're worried about your PlayStation 3 library, you can't play it on the 4, which, you know, is very frustrating, believe me.

1680
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:23,000
So I get that end of it, where you want to be able to still play those games, so I think you really have to kind of ask, like, you know, how important are those games for you to continue to keep playing, and if you really want to get them and still play them, I think you should consider just investing in the new PS3.

1681
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:29,000
They're getting cheaper and cheaper. How much are they these days? Cheaper than $1.99 at this point, aren't they, or are they still $1.99?

1682
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
Yeah, they're definitely cheaper than that.

1683
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
They didn't buy it back for very much, that's for sure.

1684
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
Yeah, so there you go.

1685
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:45,000
All right. Sorry, I just, I have to get out this tangential thing about issues happening with PlayStations, because my PlayStation 4 has started doing something very strange that's a little bit concerning.

1686
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Loki, have you heard anything about this? So I will put my PlayStation 4 into rest mode, and the little yellow light comes up and it's in rest mode, right? Does its thing. Sometime overnight, it will shut off completely.

1687
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:12,000
Like, rest mode will kick out and it shuts off completely, and when I boot it up again the next day, which I can't do for my controller, I have to go to the console and push the power button on Switch, it will yell at me for not shutting it down properly the last time.

1688
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
So you should shut it down each time.

1689
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Well, I leave mine in rest mode, and here's the thing though, that's not even a necessary problem for me. What I have as a problem is my digital games will sometimes crash in the middle of them.

1690
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:32,000
I have that happen a lot. Like, you know, even Lego Marvel Super Heroes will do it. I've had it with Gad out of Hell just randomly, oop, stop. No reason.

1691
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
This is concerning to me. What?

1692
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:38,000
I would like to say that I have never, ever had problems with any of my Sony products.

1693
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Hahaha, be careful what you wish for.

1694
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Except for when our very, very first model PlayStation, after being used for about three years, we had to start using it upside down, and then we did the sideways way, and then we got a new one. Those happened.

1695
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:10,000
But we have a first edition Japanese PS2 that still works perfectly. We have a first edition US PS2 that still runs perfectly, and a first edition PS3 that still runs perfectly.

1696
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:20,000
So, all I can say is just, then again, you guys know how careful Dan is with everything. We shut the system off when we're done with it.

1697
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:27,000
Fifth Dream in chat says mine does that too, and it's frustrating when I'm trying to charge my headphones or controller. I really think there's an issue there.

1698
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Because remember, after the last patch, there was a big issue with rest mode that they supposedly fixed. My concern is they didn't really fix it.

1699
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:43,000
And let's see, Tiger Claw suggests it could be a power outage like a flicker. But if that was the case, everything else on that strip, like the Wii U and the TV, they would all be giving me issues.

1700
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:49,000
The TV would reset everything internally, so I don't think that's it. I mean, that's a thought, but I don't think that's it.

1701
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:55,000
And let's see, Locked on Gamer in chat mentioning some other PlayStation 3 games coming out this year.

1702
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:59,000
Tales of Zestiria, Persona 5, and Yakuza 5, still to look forward to.

1703
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Persona 5 is going to be on PlayStation 4 as well, though, right? So there's at least both. I don't know about those other two games, but I know about Persona.

1704
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:11,000
Anyhow, a lot of chat on that email. Sorry, Jamie. We're ready for the next one.

1705
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:18,000
Hello, everyone. I've been listening to the podcast for about a year now, and you guys have made my commutes on Monday much better.

1706
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Just thought I'd email a few questions for you all.

1707
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:25,000
What new worlds from Disney would you like to see included in Kingdom Hearts 3?

1708
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:29,000
I'd love to see Treasure Planet, Big Hero 6, and The Incredibles in the next one.

1709
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:36,000
I feel like having an Avengers or Star Wars world would be cool, but I'm not too sure they'd translate well, and I agree with you, by the way.

1710
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:45,000
Also, now that you've been airing Orange Launch Radio for almost 13 years, I'd like to know what is the most shocking piece of gaming news you have ever discussed on the show.

1711
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
Keep up the great work, Chris.

1712
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Okay, the first question. Areas in Kingdom Hearts I'd want to see. Tron, Tron, and more Tron.

1713
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:57,000
Amen.

1714
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
Even though I know we got that in Kingdom Hearts 2.

1715
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
I don't care. It's not enough.

1716
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:02,000
It's not enough. More Tron.

1717
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:06,000
I want Tron Hearts. King Tron Hearts.

1718
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:16,000
That's right. If for whatever reason I was denied my Tron, maybe Wall-E. I want to see more of Pixar. I love Wall-E, so I think I'd want to see a Wall-E world.

1719
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:22,000
I have no idea how the hell that would work in Kingdom Hearts lore. I'm not going to write the script. I'm just going to tell you what I want.

1720
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:23,000
I know what I want, and it would never happen.

1721
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:24,000
What?

1722
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:25,000
But I'd want the Black Cauldron.

1723
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:28,000
I think that would be really rad, actually. I think there are people that would want that.

1724
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Or a full Fantasia level. Like, where you have the dancing hippos and everything.

1725
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:35,000
Ooh, Disney owns the Muppets now. I want a fucking Muppets level.

1726
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:40,000
And then I want other Jim Henson shit, like Labyrinth. I want a fucking Labyrinth level.

1727
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:47,000
I'm going to stop for a second. And I want them to keep Kingdom Hearts to just the Disney actual licenses.

1728
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:59,000
I don't want the Pixar licenses. I don't want the Marvel. I don't want the Muppets. I don't want Star Wars. I want my Kingdom Hearts to be Disney in square.

1729
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:05,000
Fine. Then Dark Tetsuya in chat, I like this, says, how about a Wreck-It Ralph world? Fine. I'm great with that.

1730
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:08,000
I would totally be down for that.

1731
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:13,000
I actually really love that idea and think it would work very well. So, fingers crossed.

1732
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:17,000
But isn't Wreck-It Ralph kind of already like Kingdom Hearts?

1733
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Well, in a way.

1734
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Would they go to different game universes?

1735
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:26,000
They could set it in Vanellope's go-karting world, where a lot of the movie took place anyway.

1736
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:29,000
So it's more like they just visit Candy Rush.

1737
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Yeah, Sugar Rush.

1738
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
Sugar Rush, whatever.

1739
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:33,000
Alright, anyway.

1740
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:34,000
What were you going to say?

1741
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Loki? How about you?

1742
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Like the, what, world I'd want? I don't know. Like, gargoyles?

1743
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Ooh! Gummy Bears! We have a gummy bear level for the gummy ship.

1744
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:57,000
What about like DuckTales or like fucking Darkwing Duck or something?

1745
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
Alright, I like the way you're thinking. It's awesome.

1746
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
I could deal with the Darkwing Duck level.

1747
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Alright, AkumaJP says, no fucking Muppets, please. How dare you. How very dare you.

1748
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:07,000
Alright.

1749
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
Next email?

1750
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
No, because we have that other question that's very important.

1751
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
Shocking stuff.

1752
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:17,000
What is the most shocking piece of gaming news you've ever discussed on a show?

1753
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:21,000
Wow, I have to really think about this. I mean, I'm sure there's something.

1754
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:25,000
You know what comes to mind? In all honestly, you know what comes to mind?

1755
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:29,000
Remember when the, and this was like kind of local news that went national.

1756
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
And there was that gal.

1757
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:32,000
Oh yeah, the water.

1758
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
See, that's all I had to say.

1759
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:37,000
That drank, it was the hold your wee for a wee contest.

1760
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:40,000
And she drank all that water.

1761
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:43,000
And you know, the radio station was kind of being irresponsible.

1762
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:44,000
And that was like a-

1763
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:45,000
Kind of.

1764
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
Well, you know, okay, sorry.

1765
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Being very irresponsible because a doctor called in and fucking told him.

1766
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:53,000
Like, this is really not healthy, right? And shouldn't be doing this.

1767
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:58,000
And so unfortunately this gal passed away and she was trying to win a wee for her kids.

1768
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:04,000
And I think just the brazen stupidity of the morning show crew and what they did.

1769
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:09,000
Well, I have to say she did have a degree of responsibility because you should know better.

1770
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:15,000
Yes, but I kind of refuse to blame her for that situation either. Especially when she was doing it for her kids.

1771
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:22,000
I, no, no, no. She did something stupid. They did something stupid by enabling her.

1772
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:23,000
Yeah.

1773
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:27,000
I put them more at responsibility. However, she did decide to participate.

1774
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:31,000
Right, but I like the way you used the word enabled. They enabled it.

1775
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Yeah, but people have to realize that the blame also goes to the person making the decision.

1776
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Right.

1777
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:38,000
There is a degree.

1778
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:41,000
Right. But anyway, but yeah, all this debate and everything.

1779
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:46,000
I mean, and the fact that that lady lived less than a mile from where we did OLR at the time.

1780
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
I mean, that's how local this thing was.

1781
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:53,000
So that was that was kind of shocking, I think, in a way.

1782
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:56,000
By the way, Akuma JP says no Muppet porn, please. I mean, LOL.

1783
02:22:56,000 --> 02:23:15,000
Oh, that's fine. And I think that all kind of goes with how like crazy people went for the Wii and the shortages and just everything that went with that when Nintendo was kind of runner up for a while, you know, and may have slipped back in that position a little bit, even though, you know, a lot of us still cheer him on.

1784
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:24,000
So we have to blame the tenant for that, because they hadn't produced enough quantities, and they wouldn't have everybody, you know, yeah, doing contests to try to win one.

1785
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:30,000
So anyway, I don't know that that's what comes to mind. I don't know if you guys I mean, 13 years, we've talked about a lot of stuff on this show.

1786
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:33,000
But just like shocking. I don't know. That's the one that comes to mind for me.

1787
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:34,000
I can think of one.

1788
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:35,000
What's that easy?

1789
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:38,000
E3 last year, or was it?

1790
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:46,000
Yes, E3 last year with one that did the whole PlayStation four thing. They were kind of rebuttal to the whole Xbox One stance.

1791
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Oh, that was two years ago.

1792
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:49,000
Oh, that was a mic drop moment.

1793
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Oh, yeah, that was two years ago. Yeah. Okay.

1794
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:58,000
That was a huge Yeah, when they just basically punched Microsoft in the face live on stage.

1795
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
That was just like, whoa,

1796
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:10,000
that that was, I think what a lot of us kind of live for any three moments. I mean, Sony versus Microsoft and those sorts of biases that people inevitably think we have a side.

1797
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:18,000
I just think that was a really truly like shocking like this. This is why I watch press conferences kind of moment, you know,

1798
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:28,000
I will honestly say that there's not too much I found shocking. And maybe it's just being jaded. Maybe it's not having a very high opinion of most other people in the world.

1799
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:32,000
But after a while, you know, especially I'm going to put it this way,

1800
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:43,000
especially if you've been in the design business and you start seeing what goes into branding and what goes into production and what goes into the presentation that these companies try to make,

1801
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:47,000
it really stops being shocking or well, I guess it wasn't that big.

1802
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:52,000
But like, remember when was it when they announced 14? I remember there's one.

1803
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Oh, no, it was 14, I think.

1804
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:57,000
It was surprising, but it wasn't a shock.

1805
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:02,000
Well, we all thought he meant to say 13, too, was what he was going to be talking about or whatever.

1806
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:08,000
What 13, the one that became 15 was the one he was supposed to be talking about. 13 versus. That's it.

1807
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:11,000
No, Agito is what became a zero.

1808
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:15,000
Yeah. Yeah. So SSG100Matt has a very good answer for this.

1809
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:21,000
And I'll leave it at this because I like this answer is very interesting about how the real world sometimes comes into play.

1810
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:31,000
SSG100Matt says, truthfully, I think one of the biggest moments in OLR history was when you guys announced the early reports of the death of Bin Laden.

1811
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:38,000
How you guys were able to keep it together during all of that and still do a show was really something that happened live on show.

1812
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:43,000
That's right. That whole, you know, sometimes world news goes on like things that are bigger than.

1813
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:47,000
I think I had like my BBC feed.

1814
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:53,000
That was at your house. I want to say it was when the studio was at your house and the news came in live on air that that had happened.

1815
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:56,000
And Obama was about to give the speech, like while we were doing the show.

1816
02:25:56,000 --> 02:26:02,000
So, yes, sometimes things happen in the real world that are more important than games.

1817
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:07,000
And we can't help but kind of get on to it is live. It is live.

1818
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:14,000
And even though we try to keep the focus on games, there's just things that are going to be that are bigger than that are going to distract us once in a while.

1819
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:20,000
There's actually something that Dan used to say when we were still in our online phase. Real life must intrude.

1820
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:23,000
Yeah. Ain't that the truth? Ain't that the truth?

1821
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:30,000
And certainly I think we've all had big personal moments on this show, too, that have, you know, kind of crossed into that as well.

1822
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:33,000
So we've we've grown up with you over the past 13 years.

1823
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:39,000
I just more reserve shock for something that isn't.

1824
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:44,000
I guess. Yeah, no one's like walked into studio and flash their tits or anything that I can think of.

1825
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:47,000
That's not even shocking. That's that's a welcome event.

1826
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:51,000
Or drop their pants, to be fair.

1827
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:55,000
Because when you say shock in radio, it makes me think shock jock like Howard Stern.

1828
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
And I'm going to ask you about your sex life.

1829
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
He's very shocked. That's not even shocking anymore.

1830
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:00,000
It's not anymore.

1831
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:04,000
It's like I hate tits in my studio.

1832
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:13,000
In the Internet age, it's not shocking anymore because there's there's complete podcasts out there that will talk about like a friend of mine online used to do a show all about gay sex.

1833
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:18,000
And it was very, very explicit, like way more than what you would hear on any of these other shows.

1834
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:22,000
So it's like I kind of feel like because any old idiot can pick up a mic and do a show now.

1835
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Hey, how you doing? It's kind of softened the blow of some of these other big shows.

1836
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:30,000
But like Howard Stern in the 90s, dude, nobody was doing things that shocking.

1837
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:35,000
And as we keep going, you know, we do I guess it goes back to the jaded thing.

1838
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:39,000
You know, we things we get a little bit more hardened to certain things.

1839
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:50,000
But I will say, like, if I got news today right now that said that Miyamoto was in a car accident, I would call that a shock.

1840
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
Bite your tongue. Bite your tongue.

1841
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:57,000
Well, I'm just saying, you know, when the earthquake happened in Japan.

1842
02:27:57,000 --> 02:28:05,000
Yeah, I had I had friends there. You know, we all have friends, you know, listeners to, you know, who were experiencing that.

1843
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:13,000
And during Hurricane Katrina, I had people that I knew, you know, in person who were listeners to the show and my good friends.

1844
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:19,000
So it's more of the real world stuff, I think, that I find more of an impact.

1845
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:22,000
I'll say impact because it may not be a shock, but it's an impact.

1846
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:25,000
So we're dragging this out way too long. But I've got one more answer.

1847
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:28,000
This is really good. I got one more answer because you guys you guys will all find this shocking.

1848
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:32,000
OK. And I can't believe nobody in chat said this yet.

1849
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:42,000
The night that we were doing OLR at the garage studio and the video card on the machine went out and the whole show dropped or something that I don't remember what happened.

1850
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:46,000
And somebody in chat and I don't even remember what it was exactly.

1851
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:51,000
It was said it was some fucking comment that got really under my skin and we worked it out after the fact it was misunderstanding.

1852
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:54,000
But he said some comment that really got under my skin and I just fucking lost it.

1853
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:55,000
Rob had his DevaFit.

1854
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:58,000
I had a DevaFit and I went off the air. And here's the thing. It's not on the pot.

1855
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Like you're probably like, oh, I want to hear that.

1856
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:04,000
You can't because we lost the show because the computer failed partway through the show.

1857
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:07,000
So we lost it. So I had this big DevaFit.

1858
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:13,000
But with SSG100 Matt talking about picking up the show and just carrying on, Loki bless his heart.

1859
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:17,000
I storm out of the studio. I'm just like, you know, fuck it. I'm out.

1860
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:21,000
And Loki goes, alrighty then. Well, next in the news we got.

1861
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:29,000
And I think I came in like 20 minutes later while Loki's tried to do this.

1862
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:33,000
I just pick up the mic and I cut off whatever he's talking about. I got something to say.

1863
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
That was a shocking moment.

1864
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:42,000
And Travis Donovan to this day says that was my best moment ever on this program.

1865
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:44,000
Anyhow.

1866
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:47,000
I think I might have just zoned out during that whole thing.

1867
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:50,000
Because I was like, what? What?

1868
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
Yeah, you were definitely here that week.

1869
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
I was there, but I think I was like, what?

1870
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:57,000
Yeah, what's happening? Rob doesn't do this. What is happening?

1871
02:29:57,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Brain malfunction. Processing error.

1872
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
0010 something.

1873
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
So next email. Hello, OLR.

1874
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:09,000
How important do you think exclusive games are to consoles?

1875
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:13,000
Did the Halo collection on Xbox One really have that big an impact?

1876
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
Or was it the lower price of the console?

1877
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:20,000
Maybe I have a wrong view on such things, but I believe exclusive games just don't have that much of an impact anymore.

1878
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:23,000
As always, thanks a lot for doing a show nearly every week.

1879
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
Fabrice from Belgium.

1880
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:30,000
I really don't think they have too big of an impact because people are going to make their decisions anyway.

1881
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:33,000
And honestly, I don't think Halo is a very good comparison.

1882
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:39,000
Because honestly, people, if they're going to play the Halo series, are pretty much already the Microsoft fanboy.

1883
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:41,000
Mostly.

1884
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:46,000
I think exclusives are still somewhat important.

1885
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
I think they're important for the company, certainly.

1886
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
Because that's what's going to sway your decision.

1887
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
Because I have to admit, I really want an Xbox One.

1888
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:55,000
Because there are a lot of games over there right now that I can't play on PlayStation 4.

1889
02:30:55,000 --> 02:31:01,000
But I also want a PlayStation 4 because there's some games there that I want to play that I have a PlayStation 4.

1890
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
I already made my decision.

1891
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:07,000
And to be fair, mostly I bought it because it was the cheaper option.

1892
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:10,000
And I knew that Final Fantasy XIV was going to be on it.

1893
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:13,000
And even though I played it on PC, I thought, oh, the console experience will be good too.

1894
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
And I don't regret that decision whatsoever.

1895
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:18,000
I think Sony's done a good job with the PlayStation 4.

1896
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:22,000
Even if it was a little light on exclusives this past holiday.

1897
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:29,000
But I still want an Xbox One because I think those exclusives, not so much the Halo collection because of the very tepid feedback that got.

1898
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:34,000
But things like Forza Horizon, Quantum Break, Killer Instinct, and some of the other exclusives.

1899
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:37,000
I mean, they've got quite a handful at this point.

1900
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:41,000
And I think it does make you look twice at the Xbox.

1901
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:47,000
But maybe, and I think this is important to look at, not so much Xbox One versus Sony.

1902
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:52,000
But exclusives are what is keeping the Wii U with a heartbeat right now.

1903
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:58,000
And yes, it is because probably, and I'm not sure, is anybody going to argue with me on this?

1904
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:05,000
The greatest studio that makes games, Nintendo, has the best track record, it makes the best games.

1905
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:10,000
They're not all perfect, but I swear to God, they do probably the best games most consistently.

1906
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:15,000
Nintendo's probably the greatest game development studio, but they only make games for their own console.

1907
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
And that's what keeps it afloat.

1908
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:25,000
No, I think that's just because they make good games, but at the same time, really that's all you're buying on that console because there's no one else supporting it.

1909
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
I mean, third party anymore.

1910
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:35,000
You'll get the really cheap-ass licensed games and stuff like that for kids, but you're not going to get any serious stuff.

1911
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:39,000
Maybe some indie games, but indie games are across all platforms nowadays.

1912
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:42,000
So that's, I think, really it.

1913
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:50,000
I mean, yeah, Nintendo games are great, but they're also kind of all you have to play on that system.

1914
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:55,000
So, anyway, that's all our thoughts on exclusives there.

1915
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:58,000
So, there you go.

1916
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:01,000
And thank you for listening just about every week to the show.

1917
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
You guys help us keep going.

1918
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:06,000
Darsakha, I don't know if you have anything to add or if we're ready for the next email.

1919
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:07,000
There's one more email.

1920
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:08,000
All right.

1921
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:09,000
Hello, LR.

1922
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:19,000
I found something on my Japanese 3DS this weekend that seems one part interesting, one part ingenious, and at least three parts horrifying, so I figured I'd share it with everyone.

1923
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:25,000
This is Nintendo's latest experiment in finding new ways to extract money from their legions of loyal fans.

1924
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:29,000
It just looked like an innocent free app on the eShop that came out about a month ago.

1925
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:35,000
I watched the intro video, which I will link to now, which I can't play reading email.

1926
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:41,000
It begins by showing that 3DS users have the ability to customize their home menus by using stamps.

1927
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:42,000
I know exactly.

1928
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:47,000
Funny enough, when Shane brought his new 3DS over this week, he was telling me about this.

1929
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
So I'm aware of where this email is going.

1930
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:50,000
But go ahead, please.

1931
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:51,000
Pretty cool, right?

1932
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:59,000
The stamps can be stuck wherever a game or app isn't, and most are Mario themed, Animal Crossing themed, or similarly Nintendo themed.

1933
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:07,000
Along with stamps, there are also icon replacements for some of the more commonly used apps, like System Settings, Street Pass, Mii Plaza, and Activity Log.

1934
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
Excuse me.

1935
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
Just how these stamps and icons obtained?

1936
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:18,000
By winning them out of UFO catchers, AKA crane machines that work identically to those in arcades all across Japan.

1937
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
Hold the A button to send the crane to the left.

1938
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:21,000
Let GoToWatchIt drop.

1939
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:25,000
Hope that one or more prizes wind up falling into the prize area.

1940
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:28,000
This all sounds well and good until you realize the horrifying part.

1941
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:31,000
These crane machines are not free.

1942
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:35,000
After a few complimentary plays, the game allows you to purchase five tries for 90 yen.

1943
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:39,000
You are not buying these items outright, you are merely buying chances to win them.

1944
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:49,000
During my free plays, I was able to win most of the items on two separate screens, of which there are many, but not the hardest to grab ones.

1945
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:52,000
I had the option of paying 90 yen to continue, but declined.

1946
02:34:52,000 --> 02:35:03,000
If you go back to these screens later to try to win the items you didn't win before, you will find the machine reset to its initial state, making it just as difficult to win those items as it was the first time.

1947
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:11,000
This rewards the sort of binging that could cost players to drop lots of money all at once.

1948
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:21,000
It is easy to think of this as cheaper than actually trying similar games at an arcade, but by the same token, those games allow you the chance to win physical, tangible prizes.

1949
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:32,000
The game will allow you to post pictures of your new improved home menu to Miiverse, but other than that, these are merely cosmetic items that you keep to yourself.

1950
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:39,000
I'm really not sure how I feel about this, it looks like the sort of thing that many will accuse of being a shameless cash grab.

1951
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:48,000
Nintendo's last pricing experiment, Darumeshi Sports Shop, did wind up in North America, so there's a good chance this could wind up here too.

1952
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:56,000
I just wonder after years of little things, like intentionally releasing small GameCube memory cards to maximize profit,

1953
02:35:56,000 --> 02:36:05,000
to limiting supplies of consoles and accessories, to making questionable release decisions, to asking us to buy the same game on Virtual Console over and over again,

1954
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:13,000
to keeping all the cool club Nintendo rewards in Japan, to releasing new limited edition 3DS systems that the new 3DS is about to come out,

1955
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:19,000
sorry, when the new 3DS is about to come out, how much will it take before even the most devoted fans yell,

1956
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:22,000
enough is enough? It's me, Aaron YYR.

1957
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:28,000
You know what's interesting is that when Shane was explaining this to me, I didn't even realize that there was this whole...

1958
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:32,000
Excuse me. I got a cough. Radio guy's worse than me.

1959
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
Rob's gonna die. Don't die, Rob.

1960
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:38,000
Sorry, getting some water. When Shane was explaining this to me, I didn't realize there was this whole crane game element.

1961
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:44,000
I thought it was just, oh, you had these mini transactions within the game that you had to buy all these stamps and these...

1962
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:48,000
I didn't even realize you had to win them, which is just like a random chance thing.

1963
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:56,000
That sounds like a big old pile of heaping bullshit to me. Color me not interested, but there are people out there that are going to spend the money on it.

1964
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:57,000
I mean, look...

1965
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
These are the same people that also buy all the Amiibos.

1966
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:04,000
Well, and look how crazy people went over that Majora's Mask 3DS.

1967
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:09,000
What is the difference between that 3DS and the regular 3DS?

1968
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:17,000
Some cosmetic face plate on the outside is really it, but there are people that have to have it.

1969
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:25,000
And I understand that drive to a certain degree. I'm not making fun of you or taunting you, because I understand that to a degree, because I bought the Zelda 3DS.

1970
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:30,000
But there's also... I kind of agree with YYR. You're gonna get to this point where it's like, enough is enough.

1971
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:36,000
And I think a lot of Nintendo fans are starting to see this all add up, and some of us are getting really frustrated at this.

1972
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:40,000
And I think it's very important, very important.

1973
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:47,000
If you do not like something, don't buy it. Nobody is forcing you to spend your money on this stuff.

1974
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:56,000
And so I think with this whole crane game thing, or little stamps that go on the home screen, that how often are you really looking at your home screen on your 3DS?

1975
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:59,000
Aren't you supposed to be playing games on your 3DS, or exchanging puzzle pieces?

1976
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:03,000
You're gonna open up your home screen and show your friend, hey look, look at me.

1977
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:08,000
You know, it's... I just don't see that. I don't get it.

1978
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:13,000
I guess for other people that maybe are into collecting, I guess it's good for you, whatever.

1979
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:18,000
But me? No way am I kicking even one dollar towards that, because that would just be another...

1980
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:24,000
Then Nintendo can go back to their sales board and say, oh that's one more person that bought into this, and look at all these users we have.

1981
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:31,000
Dropping 99 cents on this game. Let's do more! Let's use more lovable Nintendo characters the next time we do it.

1982
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
And so on, and so on.

1983
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:37,000
So, yeah, no thank you to this for me.

1984
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:38,000
Hmm.

1985
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:42,000
Pow points out, though, that this may not just be Nintendo.

1986
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:45,000
Pow says, same thing happens with Sony.

1987
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:50,000
How many times do people buy Final Fantasy, Metal Gear, or God of War?

1988
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:55,000
Well, boy Square Enix, and maybe a little bit Sony, but I'd say more Square Enix.

1989
02:38:55,000 --> 02:39:01,000
Square Enix sure looked like a laughing stock, getting up there and saying Final Fantasy VII is coming to PlayStation 4.

1990
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:07,000
Oh, by the way, it's the PC version. I mean, they kind of, they kind of ate a little shit over that.

1991
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:12,000
At least in the court of public opinion. However, you know, that doesn't mean they're not going to release it.

1992
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:18,000
And I'm very curious to see now what that's going to look like when it's released, because I bet there's a ton of people that will still buy it.

1993
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:23,000
Even, even though they gave them shit, one of the first people on Twitter to say,

1994
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:28,000
LOL, PC port on PlayStation 4, they'll be the first person to buy it.

1995
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:35,000
Why? Because, because way down in my squishy heart, I have a soft spot for Final Fantasy VII.

1996
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:42,000
But if you really, really don't like it, and you don't want them to keep doing this, it is imperative you don't buy it.

1997
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:46,000
ActDeftInChat says, if you give money to that, you're supporting it.

1998
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:49,000
Alright. Anyway, thank you for letting us know about that, because you're right.

1999
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:53,000
That's on the Japanese 3DS, not here, and people may not know that this is a thing that's going on.

2000
02:39:53,000 --> 02:40:00,000
But yeah, that's actually, ironically enough, I also heard about that this week, so it's funny I'm hearing that from two different sides this week.

2001
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:03,000
Jamie, any thoughts on that before we close up the mailbag?

2002
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
Nope.

2003
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:10,000
Alright. Loki, I know you love Nintendo. Any thoughts from you on that?

2004
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:18,000
It's a sad, I mean, for a company that doesn't seem to want to get into the mobile market because it would devalue their products,

2005
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:22,000
they're certainly imploring a lot of mobile tactics.

2006
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:26,000
I am very impressed with that shade you just threw. That was great!

2007
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:31,000
That was a very well-thought-out response to all that. Alright.

2008
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:35,000
Well, if you have some thoughts on that, participate at orangelountrader.com.

2009
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:39,000
It's the place to send your emails. Or we will be opening up the mailbag shortly.

2010
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
I'm sorry, not the mailbag. Well, that's always open.

2011
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:48,000
We'll be opening up the phone lines shortly over at 1877-gameOLR or our username on Skype, orangelountrader.

2012
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:54,000
But we have just a couple quick stories right after a well-timed FU of the Week segment.

2013
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
Why do we do FUs of the Week? Because. FU.

2014
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
DarkSakura?

2015
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:27,000
Um. A minor FU to issues. And the recovery thereof. That's it.

2016
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:32,000
Very specific and targeted FU. I know how it is. Low-key, you're FU of the Week.

2017
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
Ah, FU of the Week.

2018
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:40,000
I'm with you. I was starting to feel under the weather when I got back from Seattle and thought I got something on the plane.

2019
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:49,000
I caught it from my kids and it's taking the form of sinus stuff and along with the sinus stuff my eye is.

2020
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
Don't give it to me.

2021
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:58,000
It's not pink eye, it's just freaking allergies. I get it every single year. My wife says, it's pink eye, get it away from me.

2022
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:05,000
Like, it's fucking allergies. That's why it goes away towards the end of the day and comes back when I sleep on that side during the night.

2023
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
I'm like, it's fucking allergies.

2024
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
I hope you feel better soon.

2025
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
If you want any emergency, let me know.

2026
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
That stuff does not work.

2027
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:22,000
I am convinced it will suppress symptoms, but it's not like you're never going to get sick if you take it. But it's like taking your vitamins.

2028
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:25,000
Does taking vitamin C help? Yes.

2029
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:28,000
Actually, no. That's been disproven.

2030
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:37,000
What happened is there was a guy who got on this big kick because one time he took vitamin C and felt better so he tried to spread this word.

2031
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:40,000
I swear I will pull up all the proof on this if I need to.

2032
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:51,000
But they actually did test it and in some cases taking extreme amounts of vitamin C will actually suppress parts of your immune system and could potentially lead to development of cancer.

2033
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:55,000
It's vitamin C for cancer.

2034
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:59,000
My doctor tells me to drink a lot of orange juice and that stuff when I'm sick.

2035
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:07,000
My FU of the Week goes to people that cheat in multiplayer games.

2036
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:11,000
I don't care if you cheat in your single player game and do all the hacking and all that crap you want.

2037
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
Like Loki and his Grand Theft Auto.

2038
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:17,000
Technically that was multiplayer, but it was closed multiplayer.

2039
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:21,000
That's okay too. If everybody agrees on the terms, then that's fine.

2040
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:26,000
But FU to people that cheat in multiplayer games that just ruin it for everybody.

2041
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
Fuck you.

2042
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:34,000
Alright, that's it. Just a couple more stories for you guys and then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR.

2043
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:37,000
Or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Loki.

2044
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:42,000
So hey, I bet everyone's really excited to play Codename Steam.

2045
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:45,000
You know, I'm sure there's going to be a demo right around the corner.

2046
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:48,000
Oh, but I'm sorry, you can only get a demo at GameStop.

2047
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
Oh, and you have to be an employee there.

2048
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:54,000
So yes, there will be a demo coming out for the employees.

2049
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:59,000
And I guess they're getting five per store and you'll be able to play it next week.

2050
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:04,000
Congrats to you. You're part of the cool kids club with Nintendo.

2051
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
That's a little...

2052
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:13,000
So is it only GameStop employees or are they going to be affording this to Best Buy?

2053
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
No, it's to get you excited as we are.

2054
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:20,000
We want GameStop Associates to be the first among the experienced Codename Steam.

2055
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:24,000
Now, this doesn't necessarily mean that they're not going to put out a demo.

2056
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
It's just it's not going to be out first.

2057
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:29,000
You're not going to get to play it if you're a GameStop employee.

2058
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:34,000
I honestly, I don't know. I just don't think anyone would give two shits about, you know.

2059
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:37,000
Well, there's a part of me that's like, all right, it's just Project Steam, whatever.

2060
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:40,000
It's, you know, not a game like we're all dying.

2061
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
I mean, I think some people are really dying to play this,

2062
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
but it's not like a game we're all foaming at the mouth over.

2063
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
But I just hate the precedent this is setting.

2064
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
You know what I mean? I don't like that.

2065
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
It's fine with them having, it's fine, whatever.

2066
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:54,000
They can have their demos and stuff, but it's just like,

2067
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:59,000
I think it would be better if everybody got to play it earlier, I would think,

2068
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:02,000
because then you get the hype up more, because honestly, I don't think that...

2069
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
Or all retailers have the same shot.

2070
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:10,000
I just don't think that, like, you know, people at GameStop aren't getting me hyped up on new products.

2071
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:13,000
Okay, when I walk in there, it's more like, hey, what do you want to pre-order?

2072
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:17,000
You know, they're not saying, hey, have you ever, Codename Steam, it's fucking amazing. Here's why.

2073
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:21,000
It's like, that's, it's just not happening that way.

2074
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:26,000
They're just not, they can't hype everybody up about everything.

2075
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:31,000
DungeonBuster in chat says, exclusive demo equals GameStop associate product training.

2076
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
And I certainly get that at the end of it.

2077
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:37,000
But then ActDef says, I can see GameStop employees reselling these demos on eBay.

2078
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
And I'm sure that they will.

2079
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:43,000
I would not doubt for one second that this is when I end up on eBay,

2080
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
because they are making a lot of money.

2081
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:49,000
And, yeah, that should be up on eBay.

2082
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:53,000
Alright, well, one more little piece for you guys here.

2083
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:58,000
Since we were talking a lot about game-making this month, especially with the VoG jam and all that good stuff,

2084
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:01,000
which, yes, I still am going to be doing my playthroughs there.

2085
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
Obviously I was a little busy with my trip and so forth.

2086
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:04,000
And...

2087
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:05,000
Hoping this week I get to that.

2088
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
And you're making...

2089
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:08,000
Yes.

2090
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:09,000
As well.

2091
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:13,000
On my agenda as well. I got a lot to do before we are even going to think about having a second jam.

2092
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:17,000
But, this is really cool, is that it's another series of tutorials.

2093
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
You know, obviously we love the guys from Cooking with Unity.

2094
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
They do great stuff.

2095
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
And, you know, we had them on the show.

2096
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:26,000
But, you know what? Maybe Unity is not the thing for you.

2097
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
So there's other tutorials out there.

2098
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:33,000
And I thought this was pretty cool, is that Tom Francis, who made the game Gunpoint,

2099
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:36,000
put together a Game Maker tutorial.

2100
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:39,000
It's a series of videos that's available on YouTube.

2101
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:42,000
And all you have to do, if you download Game Maker,

2102
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:48,000
which was used in games like Spelunky, Risk of Rain, Nidhogg, and some of these other games,

2103
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:51,000
you can check out, there's a free version of Game Maker Studio.

2104
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:54,000
I'm pretty sure there is a pay version as well.

2105
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:59,000
But anyway, if you download this Game Maker, you can watch this series of videos

2106
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:05,000
and basically show you in an hour how to make some games within this Game Maker Studio.

2107
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
So I thought that's pretty cool.

2108
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:10,000
You don't have to have any programming or game creation experience.

2109
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:15,000
If you follow the tutorials, you'll have a character that moves around with the WASD keys

2110
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:18,000
and shoots the direction of the mouse pointer.

2111
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:24,000
And as noted in the series itself, if you can shoot, it's officially a video game.

2112
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:28,000
So there it is. That's pretty cool that you can do that.

2113
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:31,000
So another, you know, if you tried the Unity thing and it's not working for you,

2114
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
you want to learn something, there you go.

2115
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:38,000
So you can check out Game Maker, which has been used by people who made Spelunky

2116
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
and Hotline Miami is another big one.

2117
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:44,000
There is one other one I had too that I follow that is Game Maker,

2118
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:47,000
but I can't remember who it was and I've got to look.

2119
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
Unfortunately, these aren't very helpful.

2120
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:52,000
Thank you, YouTube, for browsing these channels.

2121
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:55,000
So I'll have to get back to you on that.

2122
02:47:55,000 --> 02:48:02,000
But there is one, though, that they have a ton of really cool tutorials and stuff for Game Maker.

2123
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
All right.

2124
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:08,000
We're going to go to the Skype line over at 1877 Game OLR.

2125
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:11,000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2126
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:16,000
The Skype line is open now for you to call in and participate with the show tonight.

2127
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:21,000
I think it's actually this guy, Sean Spaulding, I think is who it is, if I remember correctly.

2128
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
Because this looks correct.

2129
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:28,000
Loki, do you have any last-minute stories, too, while we wait for Skype to turn up?

2130
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
No.

2131
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:34,000
Well, there's one that we didn't mention, another one of those games that they're going to be bringing back

2132
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:40,000
as a remake or HD-er version on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2133
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:43,000
But Devil May Cry, they're doing that as well.

2134
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:46,000
So look for that in the near future.

2135
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
All right, let's get to it.

2136
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2137
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
Hey, this is ActDef.

2138
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
What's on your mind, buddy?

2139
02:48:54,000 --> 02:49:01,000
Well, speaking of retail exclusives, Nintendo screen up some things and all that stuff,

2140
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:06,000
I have a rant to say about the New 3DS especially.

2141
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
Go for it.

2142
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:14,000
Well, not necessarily the Majora's Mask New 3DS.

2143
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:31,000
And I said on the chat earlier that I think that the Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate New 3DS looks way more prettier, way more awesome.

2144
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:34,000
And I really wanted one.

2145
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:41,000
But since it was a GameStop exclusive, and I say was, I couldn't get one.

2146
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:48,000
Even though it didn't sell out immediately like the Majora's Mask one, I couldn't get one.

2147
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:54,000
And this is something that I kind of talked about the last time I called.

2148
02:49:54,000 --> 02:50:03,000
Where since I don't live in the United States, I don't get to have some things immediately.

2149
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
And this is one of them.

2150
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:15,000
Since GameStop doesn't want my money, nor from my own debit or credit cards, nor even PayPal, I couldn't get one.

2151
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:21,000
I was so pissed. Like really, really angry at it.

2152
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:29,000
Like, you don't have an idea, even though I pretty much ranted on Twitter already about this, but oh my god.

2153
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:33,000
I was so fucking angry.

2154
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:41,000
And this was GameStop, because GameStop's exclusive to this, they would not take whatever particular credit card you were trying to use?

2155
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:49,000
Yeah, GameStop doesn't allow for some credit cards in some countries, if it doesn't register.

2156
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:59,000
And this is pretty much something that angers me also, because they have countries in Europe that they do accept.

2157
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:08,000
Even I think New Zealand and Australia, they accept, but no, Mexico and any other Latin American countries, no, they won't take my money.

2158
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
Interesting.

2159
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:17,000
Yeah, it's really stupid. I don't know how to express it correctly, but it's stupid.

2160
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:27,000
I totally get why that's frustrating, and this goes to the whole fact that because Nintendo only uses one retailer for some of these exclusives, then it's like you have no other options.

2161
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:37,000
You can't just go to Amazon, or you can't go to somewhere else and another option that may actually be willing to take your money from another country.

2162
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:44,000
Yeah, like you said, I cannot go to Amazon, I cannot go to maybe even Walmart. I'm not saying about that.

2163
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:52,000
Well, if the Majora's Max one appears on Walmart on their site, I can buy it, and I can order it from them.

2164
02:51:52,000 --> 02:52:03,000
But not GameStop, and not even other stores, but no, it's a GameStop exclusive, and I cannot get it anywhere else.

2165
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:15,000
Unless I import one from Japan, and that would be a Japanese one, and I would have to deal with rigging and logging and all that stuff, and I don't really want to deal with that.

2166
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:24,000
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Rama in chat says, fuck this, I may end up going to Nintendo World for mine.

2167
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:30,000
Well, luckily you can do that. Most people don't have that option just based on where they live.

2168
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:38,000
And that, I know, is what's incredibly frustrating for you, Akdeft, because it's not like Nintendo is so quick to support Mexico either.

2169
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:44,000
You're not going to see them releasing some limited edition 3DS in Mexico. That's not going to happen.

2170
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:54,000
Yeah, definitely. Even Nintendo doesn't have, well, it has an official participation here in Mexico, or representation, but not directly.

2171
02:52:54,000 --> 02:53:07,000
It's, all the stuff they bring over here, it's from a distributor hired by them, and they distribute all the things, all the Amiibos or the consoles, games and all that stuff.

2172
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:14,000
So it's not a direct representative, like even Sony and Microsoft, they do have direct representatives here.

2173
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:19,000
But Nintendo, no. It's always been like that. And I mean always.

2174
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:29,000
Well, I don't know what to say, Akdeft, other than I can sympathize with you. It is very frustrating, and let's just add that to the list on why a retailer exclusive is a bad idea.

2175
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:38,000
And I think an old saying I kind of use that I think applies here is, Nintendo, you make it very hard for me to love you sometimes. You make it very hard for me to love you.

2176
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:45,000
Yeah, yeah, and that's pretty much my sentiment. I will still support Nintendo, and I will eventually get a new 3DS.

2177
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:55,000
But still, it's something really frustrating, and I also said on Twitter that that's the last time I would support GameStop or something, too.

2178
02:53:56,000 --> 02:54:08,000
Yeah, I'm officially dropping GameStop as probably a place I would go or I would consider buying stuff online or under stores or whatever.

2179
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:17,000
Well, welcome to the club. I hate to say. Alright, Akdeft, I'm gonna let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you for sharing your story. I appreciate it.

2180
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:19,000
Thanks for having me.

2181
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:23,000
It offers a very good perspective I think a lot of people don't think about. So, take care, buddy.

2182
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:24,000
Yeah, you too.

2183
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:25,000
Alright, bye.

2184
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:33,000
Alright, 1877 GameOLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, but the phone's already lighting up, so let's get to another call. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2185
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:36,000
Hi, this is RagingNator.

2186
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:37,000
Hey, RagingNator, buddy. What's on your mind?

2187
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:47,000
Not a whole lot. I just want to put my two cents in to Guardian Robert M's email from earlier.

2188
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:57,000
Seeing as he's been having problems with his PlayStation 3 and I hate to admit this, but I'm kind of an expert on this issue.

2189
02:54:57,000 --> 02:55:01,000
Fair enough. Well, what were your thoughts hearing that email?

2190
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:14,000
Alright, basically, to make a long conversation short, I'm 1000% sure that his PlayStation 3 is dying, most likely because it's overheating.

2191
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:28,000
Now, the soldering or the motherboard on there is going to go to shit and sooner or later, he's going to get that dreaded yellow light of death.

2192
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:41,000
It's not something he can fix himself and I would not recommend going to like a mom or pop store or what have you to have it repaired.

2193
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:52,000
Regardless of whether or not his system is under warranty, I would suggest sending it to Sony to have it repaired.

2194
02:55:52,000 --> 02:56:01,000
In the worst case scenario, if it's not under warranty, you may have to pay a little bit to have it fixed.

2195
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:09,000
But even if that is going to be a little bit cheaper than going out and buying a new system.

2196
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:27,000
And plus, on top of that, if it goes that route, assuming that he gets all of his proverbial ducks in a row beforehand, there's a reasonably good chance that he'll get his video content back.

2197
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:40,000
Like you said, he doesn't have a whole lot of video content, but the fact is, he has it and if I were in his position, if I bought it, I might keep access to it.

2198
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:49,000
You know, that's a really good point that you bring up that we didn't really discuss when we were talking to him about his options is that, you know, he kind of just quickly said,

2199
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:56,000
I don't think sending it Sony is really an option because I'm out of warranty, but you're right that sending it to Sony is still probably going to run you cheaper than getting a new machine.

2200
02:56:56,000 --> 02:57:02,000
And even though it won't be under warranty now, and you may have to pay a little bit out of pocket, I could be wrong.

2201
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:11,000
But won't it now be under some type of like post repair warranty where if something goes wrong for the next year, you know, then Sony will have to fix it again because they repaired it the first time.

2202
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:14,000
I could be wrong with that, but it would seem like you would at least get that perk too.

2203
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:23,000
Honestly, I can't remember whether or not that would apply or not. It's been a while since I had my PlayStation 3 repeated.

2204
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:26,000
And the rules may have changed.

2205
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:37,000
But nonetheless, you know, at least, you know, you send it in to Sony themselves as opposed to Joe Schmoe or whatever.

2206
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:48,000
You know, they'll be repaired correctly if you give it to Joe Schmoe and they try to fix it and they fork in your system.

2207
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:50,000
Guess what? You should have luck.

2208
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:52,000
Yeah, that's true.

2209
02:57:53,000 --> 02:58:08,000
But, you know, you were also you were, you know, you were, you know, when you were talking amongst yourselves earlier, you know, you seem like there was sounded like there was a little bit of confusion as to how video downloads work.

2210
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:29,000
All right. Now, I'm going to, you know, label on what I'm about to say as, you know, for like a lol asterisk or for though I'm saying that being that, you know, let's not let's say change things since I had my system in 2012.

2211
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:34,000
Well, what I'm saying applies, but I doubt, you know, they change anything.

2212
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:41,000
But last time I checked, videos work a little bit differently than games and DLC.

2213
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:48,000
Now, whereas like games and DLC, you can you have your master list of downloads.

2214
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:51,000
You can basically redownload stuff constantly.

2215
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:54,000
If you delete something, you can redown it. No problem.

2216
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:57,000
Now, videos work a little bit differently.

2217
02:58:57,000 --> 02:59:07,000
Once you buy something, let's say, for example, you bought the pilot 2 Dax files.

2218
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:11,000
If you bought that, you can download that video once.

2219
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:16,000
Now, let's say you download it to your PS3.

2220
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:26,000
Once that's downloaded onto your PS3, you know, you can no longer redownload it unless you buy it again.

2221
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:30,000
So it is unlike games because games you can download to more than one console.

2222
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:33,000
It used to be like five, but now I think a couple years ago they narrowed it down.

2223
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:34,000
You can only do it to two.

2224
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:37,000
So you're saying the video, once you download it, that's it.

2225
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:39,000
You don't get to go back on the store and download it again.

2226
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:49,000
Correct. Now, the only time that they make an exception to this is, you know, in certain circumstances,

2227
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:56,000
like if you're sending in your machine to be repaired to Sony, you know, let them know in advance,

2228
02:59:56,000 --> 03:00:02,000
hey, you know, since I'm sending my system in to be repaired for this whatever issue,

2229
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:09,000
I have, you know, IMA, IMB, IMC on my video queue that paid for.

2230
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:14,000
Now, once I send my machine in and get it repaired and it's sent back to me,

2231
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:17,000
could you, you know, set things up so I can redownload it?

2232
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:18,000
Gotcha.

2233
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:26,000
No, like, you're more than likely going to get your videos back, but there's not a 100% guarantee, though.

2234
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:28,000
You may have to make several calls.

2235
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:30,000
Well, Spazinator, I appreciate the tips.

2236
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:33,000
I think Robert M. will be able to use that in weighing his decision on what he's going to do.

2237
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:36,000
Now I'm curious to see what Robert M. is going to do.

2238
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:38,000
All right, well, I appreciate the tips.

2239
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:40,000
I'm going to let you go to try to fit in a couple more calls, okay?

2240
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:41,000
Sure, no problem.

2241
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:42,000
All right, take care, my friend.

2242
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:44,000
Yeah, have a good one.

2243
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:45,000
All right, bye.

2244
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:48,000
1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype.

2245
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:51,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

2246
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:53,000
Loki, do you have anything else you want to share with us?

2247
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:55,000
I don't know if you finish up your last-minute stories.

2248
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:57,000
No, I don't, unfortunately.

2249
03:00:57,000 --> 03:01:00,000
Well, I can always go to Twitter over at Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

2250
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:07,000
Sometimes we get some tweets throughout the week that I'll take this opportunity to respond to while we're waiting for some calls.

2251
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:08,000
Excuse me.

2252
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:09,000
And even I have the cough.

2253
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:12,000
It's a very sickly night here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2254
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:15,000
Mine's just all left over from my old sinus infection.

2255
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:21,000
Alex P. Carson tweets us saying, can't join in tonight, but much love to the OL Army and the hosts. Heart.

2256
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:22,000
Aww.

2257
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:23,000
Yay.

2258
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:25,000
A little big heart right back at you. I appreciate that, appreciate that.

2259
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:32,000
Lots of retweets and shout-outs for the rockage interview we had earlier, so awesome for that.

2260
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:37,000
Let's see, Obi-Wan Jabroni tweets saying, won't be able to catch Bobby Blackwell for an OLR this AM.

2261
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:40,000
Because remember, he's overseas, so it's the AM for him.

2262
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:43,000
We'll be watching the WWE Royal Rumble.

2263
03:01:43,000 --> 03:01:45,000
Well, at least you have your priorities straight.

2264
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:48,000
Hope there's no chance to get extra VOG points.

2265
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:49,000
Well, I think you lucked out.

2266
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:54,000
I don't think Bobby or I had any games or anything tonight for extra points, so you might have lucked out.

2267
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:58,000
Keep in mind, though, Bobby is not having a show next week.

2268
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:01,000
He is off for the Superb Owl.

2269
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:03,000
He does a big party thing with some friends.

2270
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:07,000
He's done that every year, so that would be important.

2271
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:11,000
His show, you'll have to check in for that at some point over the next two weeks.

2272
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:13,000
You'd check in once there.

2273
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:17,000
All right, gosh, I think that might be it.

2274
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:21,000
We're not really getting a lot of calls, and it's 9.15, so I think it probably is time for us to wrap up.

2275
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:26,000
If you didn't get through and you were just being shy and you think of something to say later on, don't forget to email us.

2276
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:29,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2277
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:32,000
You can always email us, and that gives you time to think about what you want to say.

2278
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:34,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2279
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:37,000
But for now, we're going to go ahead and start to wrap things up for the night.

2280
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:43,000
As always, I want to thank you guys very much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio and supporting independent broadcasting.

2281
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:47,000
If you like what you heard here at the show, please tell a friend or two about the show.

2282
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:50,000
Help spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

2283
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:54,000
but we can't give those voices any airtime if they're not here listening to us.

2284
03:02:54,000 --> 03:03:01,000
So please, if you have some friends you think would enjoy the show, please send them our way, either live or in podcast form.

2285
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:06,000
If you honestly can't think of anyone to tell, we'll always accept reviews of the show.

2286
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:11,000
We really appreciate any five-star reviews over on Stitcher Radio, where you can hear this program.

2287
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:18,000
Also on iTunes, of course huge for podcasting, or wherever it is that you found this show, we would appreciate a nice review.

2288
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:21,000
Those go a long way towards visibility as well.

2289
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:25,000
It's about time to go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

2290
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:27,000
I will start with my final thought for the night.

2291
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:33,000
My final thought for the night is, Alan was able to come home from work on light rail, so I don't have to pick him up tonight.

2292
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:41,000
So that means 30 more minutes of either Diablo 3, Final Fantasy XIV, or Fantasy Life. We'll see.

2293
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:43,000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

2294
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:45,000
Fuck that, I'm having cheesecake.

2295
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:50,000
Oh my god, do you know what I learned this weekend, though, when we went to Cheesecake Factory?

2296
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:52,000
Don't tell me, la la la.

2297
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:59,000
I'm just gonna say, don't open the menu of how many calories a slice of cheesecake has. Don't do it.

2298
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:01,000
Are you getting your cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory?

2299
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:02,000
Hell yeah.

2300
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:04,000
Oh, well then I'm definitely not gonna tell you.

2301
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:08,000
No, I already know, by the way, but there's a reason behind this.

2302
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:18,000
Tomorrow I am 100% back on keto, so I figured I may as well blow out all the sugar for an entire year, and then I'll be fine.

2303
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:20,000
Nothing wrong with a little indulgence once in a while.

2304
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:24,000
A little indulgence is fine, but I indulged a lot in Seattle. A lot.

2305
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:25,000
You gonna come with?

2306
03:04:25,000 --> 03:04:30,000
I'm gonna respectfully pass, just because I have indulged a lot the past couple weeks.

2307
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:31,000
Ah, fuck it, you only live once.

2308
03:04:31,000 --> 03:04:34,000
I know, I know. Loki, your final thought?

2309
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:43,000
That channel I was talking about earlier, it was user 999GrayFox, G-R-E-Y, Fox, on YouTube.

2310
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:46,000
That was Sean Spaulding does some tutorials for Game Maker.

2311
03:04:47,000 --> 03:04:50,000
And hopefully I'll be working, well I will be working more on my game this week.

2312
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:53,000
I'm almost to the point where I can actually start building levels.

2313
03:04:53,000 --> 03:05:04,000
So I'm just doing the starting line sequence, you know, when you're starting off a level where it does the countdown and stuff and go and starts the timer type thing.

2314
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:06,000
Because I have the timer running, and I have everything.

2315
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:12,000
Now I've got it where in the very first level, because the first part's like a menu and you have to drive through the first level.

2316
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:21,000
And once you get on the starting line, it's gotta stop you, and then move you to where it needs, like the middle of it, and then let you go after the countdown thing.

2317
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:22,000
So that's what I'm working on right now.

2318
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:25,000
Nice. I'm hoping to make some progress on my game as well.

2319
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:27,000
The weekend will be a good chance for me to do that.

2320
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:34,000
I honestly, up until tonight, in setting up for the interview, for some reason in my mind, I thought Rockage was this coming weekend.

2321
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:41,000
So I was thinking, oh okay, I gotta plan a trip to San Jose this weekend, and then I forgot, no stupid, there's still the Super Bowl, and then Rockage.

2322
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:48,000
So knowing that I don't really care about the Super Bowl, that'll give me a lot of time this coming weekend to work on that, so that'll be exciting.

2323
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:51,000
Fingers crossed I can have something to show you guys soon.

2324
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:57,000
Once I get past, once I get to the point where I can start building levels, then I can implement all the goofy shit that I've had.

2325
03:05:57,000 --> 03:05:58,000
That's the stuff you really wanted to do.

2326
03:05:58,000 --> 03:06:06,000
Exactly, because I've gotten all the framework stuff done, and then it's just like creative, creative, creative, and that's where I want to get to.

2327
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:09,000
Alright, that's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Laundry News.

2328
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:16,000
Thanks again for your support, and coming back after a week off, we really appreciate it, and we will be back to do it all again in seven days.

2329
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:20,000
Yes, we will be here, despite that football game that a lot of people seem to care about.

2330
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:24,000
I know, Puppy Bowl, but we've gone up against them in the past, and you know.

2331
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:33,000
Thankfully Puppy Bowl airs really early for us on the West Coast, so we can get that out of our system before we do OLR that night.

2332
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:41,000
But, Dark Sakura, and maybe Loki too, you know, we've been talking about doing our Super Taco Bowl next Sunday.

2333
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:43,000
No, no, no, it's called a Burrito Bowl.

2334
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:47,000
Burrito Bowl, oh excuse me, Super Burrito Bowl, so maybe we'll do that for OLR next week.

2335
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:49,000
Well, you know what I still call it.

2336
03:06:49,000 --> 03:06:50,000
What?

2337
03:06:50,000 --> 03:06:55,000
The Super Bowl, which is what we're gonna be in after the Super Burrito Bowl.

2338
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:59,000
It gets us an excuse to play, was it the sports song or whatever from Weird Al next week?

2339
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:01,000
That's true.

2340
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:02,000
Sports, do the thing!

2341
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:06,000
Get the thing to the other side of the thing. Sports harder than the other team.

2342
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:11,000
Careful what you order in your Super Burrito Bowl at Chipotle or you'll end up on the Super Toilet Bowl.

2343
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:18,000
And on that thought, that does it for another Orange Lounge Radio. Thanks again for listening, we'll see you in seven days. Good night.

2344
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:35,000
6pm Pacific, 9pm Eastern.

2345
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:43,000

2346
03:07:43,000 --> 03:07:46,000
But you know they were all still true.

2347
03:07:49,000 --> 03:07:50,000
See you next week.

2348
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:22,000
Thanks for watching!
