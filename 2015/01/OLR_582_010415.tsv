0	18680	Tonight, January 4th, 2015, we begin our 13th year of broadcasting making 2015 gaming
18680	23000	predictions with our listeners, and Sony apologizes for the holiday attacks with free PS Plus
23000	24000	time.
24000	32000	Here's more on the show where every gamer has a voice.
32000	36080	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to an all new year of the
36080	38560	show where every gamer has a voice.
38560	46120	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 582 for this January the 4th
46120	47840	of 2015.
47840	53320	Here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with myself, Rob Roberts,
53320	59200	and with me as always, my co-hosts, beginning our 13th year of broadcasting, say hello to
59200	61360	DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
61360	62360	Hi.
62360	63360	Hi.
63360	64360	Lucky 13, can you believe it?
64360	65360	Yerp.
65360	69840	Started in 2002, which to be fair, we haven't turned 13 yet, that'll be in June, but still
69840	71360	it's the 13th year of broadcasting.
71360	72360	It's crazy.
72360	73360	Yerp.
73360	74360	I was just thinking about that earlier today.
74360	75360	The show's a teenager.
75360	76360	Yerp.
76360	77360	It's a brat.
77360	78360	It's a brat.
78360	79360	You're the brat.
79360	80360	So?
80360	83080	But you are a brat who brought cookies to the show tonight, so I can't be a hater.
83840	86640	I'm happy, happy you and Alanversary.
86640	87640	Thank you.
87640	88640	I appreciate that.
88640	89640	Yeah.
89640	92400	Today is Alan and I's 5th anniversary, so thank you for acknowledging that.
92400	95080	It would be Alan and Mai.
95080	99680	Anyway, say hello as well to Tech Matt.
99680	100960	Clearly I'm not the grammar master.
100960	103200	Maybe I'll introduce her as that in the future.
103200	104480	But say hello to Tech Master Loki.
104480	105480	Hi.
105480	106480	Hi, Loki.
106480	107480	How are you?
107480	108480	Eating Chinese.
108480	109480	Yeah, you're eating Chinese, which is funny.
109480	113040	Were you jealous of last week when DarkSakura and I were eating Chinese food?
113040	114640	Because let me tell you, don't be.
114640	116480	It made me sick for like four days.
116480	118160	No, I wasn't jealous of that.
118160	121200	I just wanted something different other than the burgers.
121200	126360	Because I had McDonald's yesterday, and I don't know what it is lately, but McDonald's
126360	127360	has just gone downhill.
127360	135840	They used to be sometimes pretty good, but now it's maybe 10% good, 90% garbage, so I've
135840	137520	just stopped going there.
137520	142800	But my son wanted a happy meal or some garbage, so I had to go buy that.
142800	145840	Oh, I thought DarkSakura was reacting to a happy meal over there, she said.
145840	150640	No, I'm getting sick of autocorrect on my computer, and I'm about to turn the shit off.
150640	151640	On your computer?
151640	152640	That's too much.
152640	153640	I'm on a Mac.
153640	154920	I know, but I didn't realize the computers did autocorrect.
154920	156840	I haven't had a Mac laptop in forever.
156840	157840	But anyway.
157840	158840	Sorry, Loki.
158840	160840	So you got your son garbage food at McDonald's.
160840	168120	Yeah, so he had garbage food at McDonald's, and so I got some as well, and it's garbage.
168120	171220	Like the fries are just terrible, it's like eating cardboard.
171220	175660	So I decided I didn't want to have a burger today, so I just stopped and got Chinese,
175660	179060	and the slowest Asian person ever served us.
179060	183220	It took him 20 minutes to serve me and the person in front of me, who only ordered two
183220	184220	things.
184220	186340	I was like, why are these people employed?
186340	188460	Slow and steady wins the race.
188460	189460	There is no race.
189460	190460	He's not racing.
190460	191460	He's just slow.
191460	195340	All right, going to our chat room, which isn't slow tonight.
195340	197140	There's actually a few of you guys over in chat.
197140	203140	We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, www.vognetwork.com.
203140	208180	It's six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
208180	214860	And of course, if you are listening live, you can participate with our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.
214860	218460	And you know when we talk about the whole 13 years of OLR, somebody always inevitably
218460	219620	makes a comment like this.
219620	220620	You ready?
220620	224560	SSG100Matt says, I was 19 when I started listening to OLR.
224560	226560	I'm 31 now.
226960	227960	Yeah, thanks.
227960	228960	Thanks.
228960	229960	Thanks for that.
229960	231600	Thank you for that reminder.
231600	236840	Ragenator in chat says, I'm looking forward to OLR episode 666.
236840	241840	You know what's funny is in the old days of OLR, probably around like episode 69, you
241840	246040	know, we got to episode 69, which for its own reasons was a landmark show.
246040	250120	I think we started making jokes about, well, what's the next big number that this show
250120	251120	will hit?
251120	253360	And that's, oh, episode 666.
253360	255320	And we would say, oh, we'll never make that number.
255320	259760	And I think I even plotted it out and I said, you know, if we were to get to episode 666,
259760	262240	we would have to get to like 2016.
262240	264080	And I was always like, oh, we'll never last that long.
264080	269160	And now I'm looking at it going, actually, we probably will get to episode 666.
269160	271040	So we better plan something really special.
271040	273040	And then 669.
277040	282680	Anyway, let's see other comments in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
282680	287280	Locopoco commenting on the food saying, I only go to McDonald's for fries, always order
287280	288440	them without salt.
288440	289440	So they are fresh.
289440	291920	But then they don't have salt on them.
291920	292920	And yes, I understand.
292920	295040	We'll just put your own salt on it.
295040	298000	However, they have like other seasonings that they throw on there.
298000	299000	So it's not just salt.
299000	303160	I have it on good authority from friends that used to work at McDonald's and even managed
303160	306240	that if you just ask for fresh fries, they'll give them to you.
306240	307520	Just ask, could I get fresh fries?
307520	308520	And they will.
308520	311600	Usually, usually good customer service trumps, you know, whatever else.
311600	313640	Yeah, but I usually think they don't give a shit.
313640	318400	And so I'm not going to ask that because they're just not going to give a shit.
318400	321920	Or like if you go to In-N-Out, which yes, I am going to rub it in everybody's face as
321920	325240	I live in California and therefore have easy access to In-N-Out.
325240	326240	Sorry not.
326240	327240	Sorry.
327240	329040	Uh, the best way to get the fries there are well done.
329040	330040	Always.
330040	331040	Oh, God.
331040	332040	So good.
332040	333040	So good.
333040	334040	Where?
334040	335040	In-N-Out.
335040	336040	Uh-uh.
336040	337040	What?
337040	338040	Nuh-uh.
338040	339040	Animal style.
339040	340040	Oh, no, no, no.
340040	341040	Because Animal Style has the mayonnaise based thing on it.
341480	342480	It's 1000 island and it has mayonnaise.
342480	343480	Which is amazing.
343480	345920	That's, that's mayonnaise and ketchup basically.
345920	348040	Because the only other way to get it is no salt.
348040	349040	Plain.
349040	350040	No.
350040	351040	Which salt is nasty.
351040	352040	No, no, no, no, no.
352040	353040	You can get light salt.
353040	354040	Anyway.
354040	359360	Uh, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, OLR retiring after 666 episodes confirmed.
359360	362920	You know, it all has to end someday.
362920	364960	Someday there's going to be a final episode of OLR.
364960	368160	And I'm not saying, you know, we know when that is yet or anything, but.
368160	371000	Well, that's the episode that we're going to have Gabe Newell on, right?
371960	374720	I always kind of have thought in the back of my head.
374720	379840	If we are going to end it on a predetermined date, it should be episode 666.
379840	380840	That ought to be it.
380840	384340	But again, I don't, I don't really think, but then I'm like, well, but then we could
384340	388800	also get to 700 and you know, anyway, so it's always like, there'll always be another goal
388800	390120	right after you cross one goal.
390120	391120	There'll always be another goal.
391120	394000	I think that happens to a lot of podcasters like, whoa, we made a year.
394000	396760	Well, now can we make a thousand will be awesome, right?
396760	398720	Then it'll be like, let's get to a thousand.
398720	400700	How many shows did a thousand episodes?
400700	401700	Maybe a few daily shows.
401700	405760	I'm sure some shows that are taped daily probably made a thousand, but I don't think any weekly
405760	408100	shows have gone that far.
408100	409100	Anyway.
409100	412740	Havoc978 in chat says, OLR will be forever.
412740	414340	Well, we like to think so.
414340	415340	You know what?
415340	418960	It's a great way for me to hang out with Dark Soccer and Loki every Sunday.
418960	421860	And that's probably a big part of the reason why it's gone on so long.
421860	423600	It's just, it's, it's our thing.
423600	424600	It's our hangout time.
424600	430020	Just like some people have church, some people have their weekly D and D games, their weekly
430020	434720	meetup to play Nintendo or PlayStation, their weekly meetup to do whatever.
434720	435720	This is our weekly meetup.
435720	440380	And thank you guys for sharing it with us every week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
440380	446220	Anyhow, I want to get into our kickoff topic for tonight and a happy new year to everybody.
446220	450980	I hope you guys had a great new year's Eve and celebrated well.
450980	452740	I don't know what you did, Dark Soccer.
452740	454700	My new year's Eve sucked, just so you know.
454700	458160	My new year's Eve was awful because I had food poisoning.
458160	462160	And so I had two different things I could have done on new year's Eve and I got to do
462160	463160	neither.
463160	465420	Instead I sat home on the couch by myself.
465420	468960	You had two things that you were able to do on new year's Eve.
468960	469960	Fuck off.
469960	475680	I meant I had two parties I was invited to and I couldn't do either one of them.
475680	478880	Instead I had to sit on the couch and I watched the Anderson Cooper and Kathy Griffin, which
478880	480960	you know, at least that was, that was all right.
480960	483520	But Dark Soccer, I hope your new year's Eve was a little brighter.
483520	485040	What'd you end up doing?
485040	486040	Everyone was sick.
486040	487400	Yeah, including me.
487440	488440	Yep.
488440	491080	You missed a child throwing up neon green.
491080	492080	Ew.
492080	495200	But did he do it at midnight?
495200	496200	She.
496200	497200	Cousin Sophia.
497200	498640	Did she do it at midnight?
498640	500560	Well, a little bit before that.
500560	506520	What happened is Sophia had a coughing fit and she had been sucking on one of those blue
506520	507560	Luden's things.
507560	509440	So when she threw up, it was neon green.
509440	510440	That's disgusting.
510440	513320	Someone might have said, I don't know.
513320	515520	And then Midna started sniffing at it.
515520	519520	Now see people that were 19 when they started listening to the show, aren't going to understand
519520	520520	that joke.
520520	521520	That's why you have the internet.
521520	522520	You can look it up.
522520	523520	All right.
523520	524520	Sorry.
524520	525520	Sorry.
525520	530120	So the cousins had to leave with Sophia and then all that was left was, uh, me and Dan
530120	537480	and his little sister and Becky and Julian and Julian stayed up till midnight and then
537480	540840	they left and then Becky took Dan's iPad instead of her Kindle.
540840	545640	So she had to bring it back because Dan's work gave him the iPad.
545640	548120	So that was really the most exciting thing that happened all night.
548120	551200	Dan was playing out runners on the Sega Genesis when the new year rolled in.
551200	554960	I saw the picture on Facebook, so you guys had like a retro gaming new years, right?
554960	557080	Well, Dan had a retro gaming new years.
557080	559880	I was basically drunk fun.
559880	565360	I found out that, okay, I can drink frivolous all night and be a little tipsy.
565360	569120	I can have maybe a shot of hypnotic and be a little tipsy.
569360	571720	Mixing Frivolo and hypnotic, not a good idea.
571720	573720	Wild delicious.
573720	574720	Oh my God.
574720	578440	I was like, Oh, are you supposed to mix wine with other liquor?
578440	580600	Well, I guess that's what sangria is, isn't it?
580600	586400	But still kinda, yeah, but, um, but, uh, I, I just wanted to see what they tasted like
586400	590680	together cause the two flavors are very complimentary and it was really delicious, but I can't have
590680	595760	like more than one glass of that cause my stomach will be like, no, you're not 19 anymore.
595760	599760	You can't drink like, wait, 19, you're not 21 anymore.
599760	602760	You can't drink like that.
602760	603760	Well, come on.
603760	605440	You did grow up in Alabama.
605440	608240	Like, you know, you, you're, you're taking shots by the time you get your driver's license.
608240	610240	I did have that absence when I was 16.
610240	611240	There you go.
611240	612240	Now the real thing.
612240	614600	Now I'm plotting for dragon con 2015.
614600	615600	Some of these drinks.
615600	616600	Anyway.
616600	617840	Uh, Loki, how was your new year's Eve?
617840	622040	I imagine with the kids, you probably didn't get to do any big noisy parties, but did you
622040	623360	celebrate with them?
623360	630000	Um, well we went to, um, my wife's, um, mother's house and we had food there as we do every
630000	631000	year.
631000	636480	And so she made all sorts of things, matzo ball soup and chicken and that was really
636480	637480	good.
637480	638480	Homemade matzo ball soup is amazing.
638480	640800	Homemade matzo ball soup is amazing.
640800	642800	And um, the chicken that she made was great.
642800	646200	It was with, uh, Jack Daniels that she like cooked it in.
646200	648080	So good.
648080	649840	And so, um, yeah, that.
649840	656280	And then everybody kind of went to bed, you know, pretty early cause who cares?
656280	659140	Kids don't, you know, go sleep anyways.
659140	664200	And then, um, then everyone woke up at midnight when all the booming went off.
664200	666800	Sound like someone like exploding stuff.
666800	672000	What are the people even, they don't even sell fireworks, like mortars or something.
672000	675520	It was like super loud and then like it woke up everybody.
675520	678440	I'm like, how is that supposed to celebrate the new year?
678760	679760	Now the kids are awake.
679760	680760	Thank you.
680760	681760	Oh my God.
681760	683760	It's like, why do I even bother?
683760	684760	Wow.
684760	689680	All right, well this is the time of year with the new years that a lot of people start making
689680	694160	their new year's resolutions and look, I know some of you can kind of give or take a lot
694160	697720	of these new year's resolutions, but it is a part of culture that this is something people
697720	698720	do.
698720	702760	And even if you hate new year's resolutions with a passion, I still think as a gamer,
702760	708240	a lot of us tend to make their goals for 2015 like, Oh, there's this XYZ game.
708240	710760	I've never played that I really want to play.
710760	715960	Or, um, there's this other, you know, I want to beat more games in the year or 300 games
715960	719960	that are in my steam library that I have to install and play at some rate, right?
719960	722680	So I actually asked the listeners earlier this week, I was like, what were some of the
722680	724040	resolutions you guys have?
724040	726440	What are some of the new year's gaming resolutions you guys have?
726440	730520	Uh, and some of the answers that came in, uh, ACHP said by resolution the last few years
730520	732440	was to beat two games a month.
732440	737560	It's surprisingly difficult to do, but I succeeded the last two years going to try again this
737560	741080	year, finished geometry wars three today, one down for January.
741080	742080	That's great.
742080	743080	I'm still working on geo wars three.
743080	747320	Uh, and ER said my resolution should be to not buy so many games.
747320	750040	My poor backlog, but I know I'll never keep it.
750040	755760	And do chalk said my resolution is to pour much less time into MMOs.
755760	758920	Time investment likely served better elsewhere.
758920	762880	I w I wish I could say something similar just because you guys all know I'm an MMO addict.
762880	764920	I have another show dedicated to MMOs.
764920	767520	I did cancel my wow account.
767520	771880	I'm sorry to say to my wow playing friends, but now I'm just playing final fantasy 14
771880	773640	twice as much.
773640	775320	So that's not really helping either.
775320	777480	Uh, what about you guys?
777480	780080	What are some of your gaming resolutions?
780080	783600	I don't know if you guys have any dark star or goals if you want to stay away from the
783600	787320	word resolutions, but, uh, Loki, dark soccer, anything for you guys?
787320	792680	I'm going to finish borderlands two on my Mac.
792680	795640	This is a follow up to the discussion that's going on in chat right now.
795640	796640	Isn't it?
796640	797640	Yes.
797640	802360	Which I've been playing on my Mac.
802360	803360	Fair enough.
803360	805680	Uh, so you're gonna, but you're going to be borderlands too.
805680	806680	What about, what about the pre-sequel?
806680	809360	Why don't you just play the whole trilogy sequel yet?
809360	814280	What I promised Dan, I would play through the first two with him before I get the pre-sequel
814280	816280	and by the time I'm ready for the pre-sequel, it'll be cheap.
816280	817280	It'll be on sale.
817280	818280	Yeah.
818280	819280	Really?
819280	820400	And you just need to finish borderlands two before the pre-sequel even makes sense.
820400	822040	Cause it's like, who are these characters?
822040	823040	Yeah.
823040	824040	What are they doing?
824040	827080	Well, I mean, I already have watched Dan play through most of, uh, borderlands two anyway,
827080	828520	so I know all the characters and everything.
828520	833140	Um, it's just that he was usually busy playing multiplayer with his buddies and I never had
833140	834140	a chance to.
834140	835140	Mm hmm.
835140	837440	So, um, Loki, what about you?
837440	840120	Any, any re gaming goals for the year?
840120	842360	Um, how about finish your damn game?
842360	843360	That's one of them.
843360	845360	I was going to say that.
845360	846360	Both of them.
846360	847360	Um, yeah.
847360	851720	Uh, so there, there's that, I do want to finish my games.
851720	856240	Um, I kind of want to finish, um, platinum in Lego Marvel superheroes.
856240	862120	I would have had it done by now, but my damn son wouldn't play any of the levels.
862120	863400	I'm like, you don't have to do anything.
863400	867240	He's like, but yeah, but you need me to do specific things at certain times.
867240	870400	I'm like, not since I've already played through them all already.
870400	873600	I just need you to sit there and hit things and that's it.
873600	875400	And he's like, no, I don't want to do that.
875400	876400	I'm afraid of the levels.
876400	877640	I'm like, fine.
877640	881300	So I can't finish any of them and I don't have time to play it right now while I'm working
881880	882880	on my vlog jam games.
882880	891460	So, um, I don't know, I just want to finish that and then I don't really know what else
891460	892460	I'll play.
892460	895740	I guess get through the other games I bought for my PlayStation 4 that I haven't even played
895740	896740	yet.
896740	900580	Like I have Infamous I've started and then I have Destiny that I haven't touched yet
900580	905300	and I have Watch Dogs that's collecting dust, so there's that.
905300	909960	Even just getting through the backlog of stuff that I have on PC and my Steam library, on
910080	917920	Xbox Live in all the Games for Gold stuff and even with PlayStation on the PlayStation
917920	918920	Plus stuff.
918920	923720	I have tons of things I haven't played yet and I'm still a fucking idiot and keep buying
923720	924960	more things.
924960	925960	I don't know why.
925960	928800	Oh, I know why because I want those things and I need them bad.
928800	929800	They're shiny.
929800	930800	You need them.
930800	934140	It's just like I bought the DLC for, all the DLC for Lego Marvel Super Heroes.
934140	935140	There's no reason to it.
935140	939400	The characters are fucking stupid and it was overpriced, but I did it anyway so that it
939400	943080	would have something different to play as in the game because I'm getting so bored of
943080	944080	it right now.
944080	947520	So my son seriously plays that for hours at a time and just runs around.
947520	952520	Now I showed him one of the levels he can go into and break things.
952520	953520	So my gaming goals.
953520	954960	I need to get some platinum trophies.
954960	957520	I think I have maybe one on all of PlayStation games.
957520	959240	If that, I actually may not have any.
959240	962360	So it's high time I get some platinum trophies and I already know what games I want them
962360	963360	in.
963360	965440	I want them in Diablo 3, Reaper of Souls, because I know it's achievable.
965440	966840	It's not a super hard platinum.
966840	969920	It just takes a little bit of grinding because you have to get one of every class to level
969920	971400	70, but it's doable.
971400	972800	It's like way more than doable.
972800	974120	It's just going to take a little patience.
974120	980360	So I want to get one there and I really think I can get one in Final Fantasy 14, which there's
980360	982960	some, you know, I have to do like a thousand fates and a thousand.
982960	986880	Are they as ridiculous as the ones in Final Fantasy 11?
986880	991680	Well, they're not as bad in 11 now after they implemented the whole fact that you can XP
991680	994560	with a party of people like.
994560	996560	Yeah, at the time it was like, Oh, get me 75.
997280	1000880	It's a little easier now, but yeah, I want to get a platinum in Final Fantasy 14, which
1000880	1002360	I think is definitely achievable.
1002360	1006240	The hardest one's going to be clearing turn five on PlayStation four, but I know I can
1006240	1007240	do it.
1007240	1008240	I know I can do it because I've cleared it on PC.
1008240	1010280	There's no reason I can't do it on PS4.
1010280	1013320	So those are some of my immediate goals.
1013320	1020600	I want to do more with broadcasting like YouTube and live streams because I end up right now
1020600	1025420	doing a live stream like maybe every two weeks and I want to bump that up to more like maybe
1025420	1029140	two a week now that I have a little more time because I'm not doing the performance
1029140	1031900	stuff anymore and I want to do more YouTubes.
1031900	1034220	I really miss that Let's Remember series I was doing.
1034220	1039900	I think it's fun to visit really, really old games that define my childhood and kind of
1039900	1042820	introduce them to people who might've missed them or only seen them for like 30 seconds
1042820	1043900	or only read about them.
1043900	1045060	So I really want to bring that back.
1045060	1047700	So those are some of my goals for 2015.
1047700	1049100	So I'm really excited about that.
1049100	1051220	So hopefully I stay on track.
1051220	1052540	Just a few more from the listenership.
1052540	1057020	Some answers over here on Google+, Tom W saying, I'm going to play at least 80% of
1057020	1058020	my Steam library.
1058020	1060140	I'm currently sitting at 51%.
1060140	1063780	But does that mean like actually play or just load?
1063780	1067540	I hope you actually play, you got to beat at least the first level in all of them.
1067540	1072920	And Martin C replies and says, trying to steer clear from games that are too much of a time
1072920	1075460	sink since my free time is limited.
1075460	1080780	I'm going to try to play more story driven games that feel more fulfilling to complete.
1080780	1081780	Interesting.
1082020	1084940	Yeah, see, that's kind of like, I'm kind of with you there.
1084940	1090540	I love games that are big in scope, like Elder Scrolls, you know, you know, five Skyrim or
1090540	1091540	something like that.
1091540	1092540	That was awesome.
1092540	1093540	That game is awesome.
1093540	1095760	But I think it's like you could spend hundreds of hours in it.
1095760	1100300	And I kind of like, that's why I like playing some of the Call of Duty games because the
1100300	1102100	campaign is so short.
1102100	1103100	It's done.
1103100	1104100	Cool.
1104100	1105100	I'm done.
1105100	1106100	All right.
1106100	1107100	If I want to play multiplayer, I can do that.
1107100	1108100	But I don't feel like I haven't completed anything in this.
1108100	1109100	And it's easy.
1109100	1112860	If you want me to get all the trophies or whatever, because it's all single player stuff,
1112860	1113860	sweet.
1113860	1114860	And that's it.
1114860	1120060	You know, whereas, you know, if I want to like 100% Skyrim, that's quite a lot of time.
1120060	1125140	Now, granted, that's enjoyable, but sometimes you just want to play other things.
1125140	1129020	And I think it's probably way more fulfilling to beat a game that's going to take you, you
1129020	1133220	know, 60 hours to beat like, I don't know, Dragon Age Inquisition or Skyrim or something
1133220	1138340	like that, as opposed to, I don't know, something like Flower, which I don't want to diminish
1138340	1139340	that game.
1139340	1142320	It's an amazing game in its own right, but it's only a two hour game.
1142320	1145620	It's an amazing two hour experience and I recommend it for everybody.
1145620	1150060	But, you know, I think beating a game that takes that like 60 hour investment probably
1150060	1153980	is worth, you know, especially if you're the guy, like that comment I read earlier, that's
1153980	1159260	doing two games a month, maybe give yourself more credit if you beat a BioWare game or
1159260	1164900	something versus, you know, oh, I beat, you know, a game that took me two hours to beat
1164900	1165900	type of thing.
1165900	1166900	Like quality over quality.
1166900	1170100	Well, I don't even want to say quality though, because like, you know, again, a game like
1170100	1172820	Gone Home was short.
1172820	1175900	And you know, I know some people even argue if that's a game period, but I think it is
1175900	1180960	an interactive experience that is absolutely worth experiencing, but it is short.
1180960	1181960	You know what I mean?
1181960	1187540	So in terms of, you know, your goals, I don't know if I would use the word quality, but
1187540	1191700	maybe just, you know, give the number of hours that it took you to beat something a little
1191700	1192700	more credit, I suppose.
1192700	1193700	Right?
1193700	1194700	Yeah.
1194700	1201620	I remember seeing that, and the whole thing that, you know, Todd McFarland designed characters
1201620	1203460	and that was pretty sweet.
1203460	1207380	I thought that was one of the games with gold titles or something.
1207380	1213940	I thought it's in my library somewhere maybe, but yeah, maybe, I don't know.
1213940	1219500	I keep staring at, you know, Dragon Age, you know, Inquisition and Far Cry 4, I'm like,
1219500	1221100	eh, don't want to buy these.
1221100	1224260	You know, if you want, Loki, if you promise to bring it back next week, you can borrow
1224300	1226580	my copy of Inquisition just to give it a try and save it your every hour.
1226580	1227580	I'm not going to time.
1227580	1228580	It's not good, unfortunately.
1228580	1229580	Alright, fair enough.
1229580	1235420	Alright, well, we are going to get into our gaming weeks here shortly, however, I have
1235420	1240320	one more kickoff topic to get into tonight, and tonight, you know, being that it was a
1240320	1244180	slower news week, admittedly, we don't have a lot of huge stories tonight, you know, it's
1244180	1249420	just the way it is, we're going to get into our 2015 predictions tonight, which here at
1249420	1251300	OLR can sometimes be a little silly.
1251300	1253300	We're not necessarily that they're always going to be accurate.
1254300	1258540	But we're going to do that through a highly scientific process known as listless, and
1258540	1260740	we'll get to that a little later in the show.
1260740	1268500	But I thought it would be fun to go back and look at our 2014 list and see what came true
1268500	1272740	and what didn't come true from that list, the 2014 list.
1272740	1278160	Now the number one answer from the process as voted on by our listeners last year was
1278160	1280020	from Dark Sakura's original list.
1280020	1282580	I'm looking at the entire list of 15 answers.
1282860	1286340	We had five hosts participate last year because we had Jason in studio, and that was during
1286340	1290700	the period of time that Loki was calling in because of the new baby.
1290700	1293340	We had Alan in here as well.
1293340	1299180	So one of Jamie's answers ultimately end up winning the listless, and her answer was gaming
1299180	1301980	created advances in accessibility.
1301980	1306820	In other words, there would be some type of gaming advancement that would lead towards
1306820	1312120	more accessibility for handicapped or, you know, accessible gamers.
1312160	1314720	So looking at that, what's that?
1314720	1317080	Which I think has happened in a few different ways.
1317080	1318080	I wasn't really sure.
1318080	1320200	I mean, this is kind of a gray area answer.
1320200	1321760	How do you think it's happened, Dark Sakura?
1321760	1326760	Because I didn't see anything really clear cut, but I do feel like companies are more
1326760	1327760	aware.
1327760	1328760	Definitely.
1328760	1334180	Improvement in motion control, improvement in voice action activated, and looking in
1334180	1343940	terms of PC gaming, you've got improved, they're actually, I've run across, I mean, the devices
1343940	1346060	have been out for a while, but they're really getting a lot more advanced.
1346060	1350780	You have braille keyboards, you know, all kinds of ways that people are able to actually
1350780	1354280	interact with their games by getting their dialogue on a braille feedback pad.
1354280	1358360	You know, I would love to see something like that come out on a console, but I mean, we're
1358360	1359540	seeing it more and more.
1359540	1361760	It's slow, but it's still happening.
1361760	1362760	That's true.
1363280	1366940	At the end of the day, there's definitely been more of an awareness, even if we haven't
1366940	1373080	seen like, here is the physical piece of technology that actually made accessibility happen more.
1373080	1376660	I think we've definitely seen an awareness, and I think a large part of that is thanks
1376660	1381960	to organizations like AbleGamers and a lot of activism you see out there on the internet,
1381960	1384380	like trying to make companies more aware.
1384380	1388840	There are reasons you should have keys be mappable in games and things like this, and
1388840	1390880	buttons mappable on controllers.
1390880	1394840	I kind of give that answer half credit.
1394840	1398520	Even though there was like nothing black and white, we still are in a better spot now,
1398520	1400080	I think, than we were in 2014.
1400080	1401080	So there's that.
1401080	1404920	So, yay us, question mark.
1404920	1408620	Here's the rest of the answers on Dark Soccer's list from 2014.
1408620	1413160	This answer was eliminated in the elimination round, but shipping war on the new Mass Effect,
1413160	1417640	which I think we joked when it was eliminated, that's always going to happen no matter what.
1417640	1419320	That answer is too safe.
1419320	1424160	Has there been shipping wars broken out over what little tidbits we've seen to the next
1424160	1425960	Mass Effect, which is actually nothing.
1425960	1428300	We've seen nothing of the new Mass Effect.
1428300	1434400	But there are plenty of shipping wars in Dragon Age, wasn't there?
1434400	1437080	So I got that half right.
1437080	1438080	Wrong Bioware franchise.
1438080	1444560	All right, and Dark Soccer's third answer from the 2014 list was World of Warcraft loses
1444560	1446760	1 million subscribers.
1446760	1451120	And we have an answer that panned out to be half true.
1451120	1453840	Warcraft took a huge dive in subscriptions.
1453840	1455800	It lost them, but they found them again.
1455800	1456800	Exactly.
1456800	1459960	As Pandaria wore on, Warcraft lost a huge amount of subscribers.
1459960	1461080	I was well over a million.
1461080	1464640	I want to say they lost more like 2 million across the year.
1464640	1468600	But when the new expansion came out, they were quick to brag that they got them all
1468600	1470520	back and they were back over 10 million.
1470520	1475680	So once again, Dark Soccer's answer gets half credit.
1476680	1477680	So there you go.
1477680	1478680	Loki's list.
1478680	1481400	Loki's list got decimated last year.
1481400	1482960	He had an answer, get immunity.
1482960	1484480	But let's take a look back.
1484480	1488720	He had 3 DS games on the Wii U, which ended up getting eliminated because it was too close
1488720	1490120	to one of Alan's answers.
1490120	1492440	So he said 3 DS games on the Wii U.
1492440	1493440	Didn't happen.
1493440	1494680	I can't even get half credit for that.
1494680	1495680	Didn't happen.
1495680	1497160	Didn't they announce DS games on the Wii U?
1497160	1499480	I don't think they ever did.
1499480	1504600	Game Boy games came to the Wii U, but that had started in 2013.
1504600	1508640	And I think we all saw that that was opening the door to DS games, but we have yet to see
1508640	1510000	one on Virtual Console.
1510000	1512360	So unfortunately that didn't end up being true.
1512360	1519280	Now your answer that ended up getting immunity, Left 4 Dead 3 or Source 2 released.
1519280	1520280	Also didn't happen.
1520280	1525440	Yeah, why should I even count Valve on releasing something in a timely fashion?
1525440	1526920	That was just dumb.
1526920	1532360	And then also on your list, it said Wii U price cut and I believe you said Mario Kart
1532360	1536000	8 will flop, leading to a Wii U price cut was what you said.
1536000	1538120	I don't think I said it would flop, but I don't think...
1538120	1539120	You did.
1539120	1540120	I'll go back to the audio.
1540120	1541120	I don't think I said it was...
1541120	1542120	No.
1542120	1543120	I don't think it would have flopped.
1543120	1544600	I said I don't think it would do enough to...
1544600	1547220	I don't think it would be enough to sell systems.
1547220	1548480	And that wasn't necessarily true.
1548480	1550640	It did sell systems because it's a great game.
1550640	1551640	Yeah.
1551640	1554120	And, uh, but no Wii U price cut, surprisingly.
1554120	1559600	Yeah, that's because they're doing pretty good off of Smash and Super Mario, or Mario
1559600	1561600	Kart 8.
1561640	1566360	They've enhanced the value, they've put more in, I mean, like everybody gets a deluxe now
1566360	1569240	for what you were paying the basic before.
1569240	1574440	So they've kind of, you know, again, maybe I'd give you a quarter credit on this.
1574440	1575440	Nah, I wouldn't.
1575440	1576440	I wouldn't.
1576440	1578360	They didn't actually cut the price because of, you know, doing bad.
1578360	1583120	But still, I think what they've kind of done now is that they're, I mean, I don't know,
1583120	1588560	they're kind of in like a balance right now.
1588560	1592640	They're not getting any more third party support, but they're not necessarily losing more third
1592640	1593640	party support.
1593640	1597640	And the first party's kind of keeping everything afloat right now, but, I mean, as soon as
1597640	1600360	those first party games aren't coming out, or it's not like...
1600360	1603280	Because we had a pretty decent release schedule.
1603280	1608080	We had, you know, Mario Kart 8 and then Smash Brothers, and that was pretty big, and the
1608080	1610660	Zelda game was alright.
1610660	1615960	But I'm worried that, you know, if Zelda doesn't come out next year or something like that,
1615960	1618720	there's not going to be a whole ton to kind of keep it afloat.
1618720	1623560	I think right now it's just, that's, what's going to happen is once those first party
1623560	1627200	titles start drying up, or maybe it's not necessarily the releases that people might
1627200	1631400	want, you know, if it's a Pikmin 4 or something like that, then you might start seeing it
1631400	1632480	start to waver a bit.
1632480	1637280	I think it's non-negotiable that a new Zelda will come out next year, and I think that
1637280	1642280	is, that is orders from the top that Zelda will happen in 2015, it has to.
1642280	1644400	I think there's intense pressure at Nintendo.
1644400	1648400	I think other stuff will get delayed to pull those people to work on Zelda if they have
1648400	1649400	to.
1649400	1653160	I think Zelda is a must happen for Nintendo in 2015.
1653160	1654960	And I think it'll be great.
1654960	1658080	There's no reason to think it won't be amazing.
1658080	1659840	Nintendo puts out quality shit, so.
1659840	1660840	It looks fantastic.
1660840	1661840	Good for them.
1661840	1667000	Okay, going to Jason's list, now this is interesting because Jason had one of his answers eliminated,
1667000	1671840	but funny enough, Jason probably was more accurate than any of the rest of us.
1671840	1673020	Which means he needs to come back.
1673020	1675840	He's on the road tonight, by the way, if you guys are wondering why he didn't do the intro,
1675840	1677540	he's on the road tonight.
1677540	1683820	Jason said, Indy hit get signed or AAA port.
1683820	1685920	That's kind of, you know.
1685920	1691700	But Minecraft getting bought by Microsoft, I mean, that's the epitome of that answer
1691700	1692700	right there.
1692700	1693700	I think.
1693700	1694700	I would give Jason credit for that.
1694700	1699500	I mean, yeah, it was a safe answer, but Microsoft buying Minecraft was huge last year.
1699500	1701620	That was a big thing.
1701620	1705620	His next answer was Oculus Rift will run at 4K.
1705620	1708460	I don't know if this, I would have to ask, I would have to defer to the expert, Bobby
1708460	1709460	Blackwolf.
1709460	1711660	I'm not, Loki, are you in tune if this ended up happening?
1711660	1712660	I don't think it did.
1712660	1717140	Well, they don't have a final dev kit yet, and we don't know what this final specs are.
1717140	1721680	I don't think it did, but certainly we've seen progress on the Rift.
1721680	1726780	And then lastly, and this answer got eliminated by a very angry Alan, who is a fan boy, when
1726780	1729780	Jason said there will be no release of Half-Life 3.
1729780	1732340	You want to talk about a safe answer.
1732340	1734180	That was definitely a safe answer that was on the board.
1734180	1735180	All right.
1735180	1739780	And Bobby Blackwolf confirming in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, no 4K, Gear
1739780	1741740	VR is 1440p.
1741740	1742900	Okay.
1742900	1747820	So here was my list, and boy did I, oh my God, I didn't get a single one.
1747820	1749340	But then again, I was being a little silly.
1749340	1750780	So here was my list.
1750780	1755100	F-Zero Boner Party was my number one answer.
1755100	1756460	And I knew that wouldn't come true.
1756460	1759660	That was more wishful thinking that there'll be the year of Captain Falcon.
1759660	1764660	To be fair, I mean, you may have had a mini F-Zero Boner Party when you saw the DLC announcement
1764660	1765660	for...
1765660	1766660	Thank you.
1766660	1767660	You know what?
1767660	1768660	That's a good...
1768660	1769660	Thank you.
1769660	1770660	Thank you for that.
1770660	1771660	That is a good point.
1771660	1772660	Thank you.
1772660	1773660	I think...
1773660	1774660	And then you probably played it and you realized how crappy it was.
1774660	1778420	And we got the Captain Falcon amiibo, which I'm seeing more pictures of that one on Twitter
1778420	1779420	than any other.
1779420	1780540	And it's all pictures of his ass.
1780540	1786120	I can't possibly imagine what it is about Captain Falcon's ass that has everybody...
1786120	1789500	Because he has one now.
1789500	1791100	That ass.
1791100	1792100	You're anaconda.
1792100	1793100	Don't.
1793100	1794100	You're anaconda.
1794100	1795100	Okay.
1795100	1796100	Anyway.
1796100	1800460	And my next answer was Microsoft jacks the Oculus Rift.
1800460	1804060	I think I kind of knew in the back of my mind that probably wasn't gonna happen.
1804060	1806720	But Facebook ended up jacking the Oculus Rift.
1806720	1809220	So oops on that.
1809220	1810620	Who would have thought?
1810620	1814160	And then my number three answer was so morbid.
1814160	1815800	Not as morbid as Alan's list.
1815800	1822200	But my number three answer was Ouya goes under, which I think I was in a fair position to
1822200	1823200	say last year.
1823200	1824200	They're made out of styrofoam, man.
1824200	1826800	You can't sink that thing.
1826800	1827800	You know what?
1827800	1832960	There are still a lot of indies that really swear by Ouya, and Ouya's definitely out there
1832960	1833960	to support indies.
1833960	1837920	So I can't hate on what Ouya's doing at all, and I don't.
1837920	1842400	But certainly I'm still kind of looking at it going, where's...
1842400	1845200	How are they gonna turn that thing into profits next year?
1845200	1846480	I don't know.
1846480	1849320	But anyway, Ouya is still around.
1849320	1850480	They did not go under.
1850480	1853320	All right, Alan's list.
1853320	1856040	Bethesda confirms Fallout 4.
1856040	1857400	I was hoping that'd be true, but no.
1857400	1858400	Yeah, me too.
1858400	1859400	Me too.
1859400	1860400	Maybe next year.
1860400	1861400	Didn't end up happening.
1861400	1862400	Didn't end up happening.
1862400	1865480	Nintendo DS titles on the eShop, and they are poorly done.
1865480	1867440	Also, no DS titles showed up.
1867440	1871260	We had Game Boy Advance, but we did not get Nintendo DS titles.
1871260	1873800	So Alan did not end up being correct on that.
1873800	1877960	And then this answer got eliminated right off the bat, because it was a little morbid.
1877960	1883920	You might remember last year, he said, a Nintendo godfather of gaming would pass away.
1883920	1884920	So that didn't happen.
1884920	1885920	We did have...
1885920	1892760	Now we had Ralph Baer, who would be the godfather of all gaming, passed away.
1892760	1897500	So Alan can maybe get half credit for that, because one could argue without Ralph Baer,
1897500	1899040	you would not have Nintendo at all.
1899040	1903560	So there you go, even though I guess Nintendo's business was playing cards.
1904320	1906320	And Awada was kind of sick.
1906320	1907600	I mean, thank god he made a recovery.
1907600	1908600	Thank god he made a recovery.
1908600	1913560	I don't want to be dark or morbid, but he did disappear for a little bit.
1913560	1914560	Just saying.
1914560	1915560	Just saying.
1915560	1916560	Anyway.
1916560	1917560	So there you go.
1917560	1921480	So looking at our list of predictions on what came true, not a lot.
1921480	1925520	So don't give me ideas for games, because that could happen.
1925520	1927000	I could make that.
1927000	1928000	What?
1928000	1929640	I'm not done with my game yet.
1929640	1930640	I have a racetrack and everything.
1930640	1931640	Oh no, there's a chat in here.
1932200	1935440	Raginator said, I wonder if any would make an F-Zero type game where you race boners
1935440	1937320	for the vlog jam.
1937320	1938840	And I said, boner racing?
1938840	1944400	It'd be people with their flying dongs pulling the bodies along.
1944400	1945400	How old are you guys?
1945400	1946400	How old are you guys?
1946400	1949280	We should call it Cosmic Thrust.
1949280	1950280	You guys have issues.
1950280	1951280	All right.
1951280	1952280	I don't have issues.
1952280	1953280	Subscriptions.
1953280	1956720	We will get to our 2015 list a little later on in the show.
1956720	1960400	We have to get to what little gaming news there is this week, though.
1960400	1965200	But first, our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this
1965200	1966200	week.
1966200	1967440	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1967440	1968840	Dragon Age.
1968840	1969840	Lots more Dragon Age?
1969840	1970840	More, more Dragon Age.
1970840	1973000	Why haven't you beat it yet?
1973000	1974840	Because I don't want my heart to be broken yet.
1974840	1975840	I see.
1975840	1977160	I'm Romancing Solas.
1977160	1980000	So that should be enough for all the people who've seen all the spoilers.
1980000	1981000	I see.
1981000	1984960	I'm also doing, well, because I like sleep in the morning.
1984960	1987800	So I play Dragon Age after work.
1987800	1991480	And I've really just been running around exploring stuff.
1991480	1995280	Just actually taking scene porn in and killing dragons.
1995280	1997400	My thing now is killing dragons.
1997400	1999440	But I'm in a game called Dragon Age.
1999440	2000440	There are dragons?
2000440	2001440	Yes.
2001440	2002440	I'll be damned.
2002440	2003440	You can kill them.
2003440	2004440	They give you shit.
2004440	2009640	But right now I'm only level 21 and the dragon I'm trying to kill is like a level 22 dragon.
2009640	2010640	Is it that one in the Hinterlands?
2010640	2011640	He's very annoying.
2011640	2012640	There's three in the Hinterlands.
2012640	2013640	Oh, shit.
2013640	2014640	Not in the Hinterlands.
2015320	2016320	That was easy.
2016320	2020600	The three in Empress du Leon is where it is.
2020600	2021840	There's three of them there.
2021840	2022840	One of them I could kill.
2022840	2024080	It was a hard fight, but I could kill.
2024080	2027400	The other two I'm nowhere near yet.
2027400	2029240	But I've killed almost all the other easy dragons.
2029240	2031600	I'm going to go after a couple more.
2031600	2037480	And I'm just basically kind of doing a really slow, enjoying myself completionist kind of
2037480	2038480	run.
2038480	2040600	So I like that I can take my time with it.
2040600	2042400	I've just been enjoying myself.
2042400	2043400	Alan's been doing something similar.
2043480	2048040	I noticed he's been playing Dragon Age with all the hubble around Dragon Age Inquisition.
2048040	2050640	He decided, you know what, I'm going to start from the very beginning.
2050640	2053280	So he played all the way through Dragon Age again.
2053280	2056560	The original Dragon Age Origins and the DLC.
2056560	2058360	Now he's making his way through Dragon Age 2.
2058360	2062180	And I think he's at the end of Act 2 right now, he said was the last point I checked
2062180	2063180	with him.
2063180	2064180	He was there.
2064180	2065180	And then he will start Inquisition.
2065180	2066520	So he's like having a whole month of it.
2066520	2071720	I found one mission that I wish I had done differently because I like the best ending
2071720	2074840	of it better than the one I got.
2074840	2079120	So I'm going to definitely be doing a second playthrough, but I figured my next playthrough
2079120	2083440	I'm not going to go after Solas because, I mean, I'm going to cry a lot.
2083440	2085100	I know it's going to happen.
2085100	2091520	So I'm probably going to romance Cullen next because he's fluffy.
2091520	2096840	But I also played some Final Fantasy 14, because I'm trying to remember I'm paying for this.
2096840	2102120	So I played a little bit, I'm just, I really, really, really, really, really, really, really
2102120	2104120	hate What Does Fuck.
2104120	2108440	Great, now I can't remember the douchebag's name.
2108440	2109440	In 14?
2109440	2110440	In 14.
2110440	2111440	Um.
2111440	2112440	Who's the guy who annoys me so much?
2112440	2113440	Oh, Hildebrand.
2113440	2114440	Yeah.
2114440	2115440	Him.
2115440	2116440	He's like comic relief though.
2116440	2117440	He's not funny.
2117440	2119580	He is the antithesis of funny.
2119580	2123220	I don't find stupid funny.
2123220	2126740	So you must not watch a lot of Adam Sandler films.
2126740	2128500	Not really, actually.
2128500	2131760	And I hated, well, you know, I also hated Seinfeld, so.
2131760	2135440	But I mean, there's a few things that made me laugh, but I've actually been kind of giggling
2135440	2138700	over Ultros.
2138700	2139700	And then.
2139700	2142780	They do a really good job incorporating like the Final Fantasy 6.
2142780	2146660	There's like some direct quotes lifted out of 6 that Ultros reuses in 14.
2146660	2147660	It's great.
2147660	2150420	It's a great love letter to 6.
2150420	2154240	But I also, I've got all of my new gifted games downloading.
2154240	2156960	They were downloading while I was leaving.
2156960	2163040	And I actually, I did some Borderlands 2 on my pretty shiny MacBook Pro.
2163040	2164680	And more Fractal.
2164680	2165800	Because I love Fractal.
2165800	2168760	It's probably my favorite puzzle game to come out this decade.
2168760	2169760	Alright.
2169760	2172840	Loki, how was your gaming week?
2172840	2178680	Really all I did was I played just like a Marvel Super Heroes.
2178680	2183440	And I didn't really get anywhere other than buying some DLC that really was overpriced.
2183440	2187280	But now I have a bunch of characters I don't really give a shit about.
2187280	2189440	Like all the tertiary characters from Thor.
2189440	2190440	Whatever.
2190440	2193260	I don't even know who these guys are.
2193260	2197840	Some of them I swear were from The Hobbit, but okay.
2197840	2198840	What else?
2198840	2200280	That was pretty much it.
2200280	2202800	Just working on my VoG Jam title.
2202800	2207160	We do want to use this opportunity to remind people the VoG Jam is going on right now.
2207160	2208160	Create a game.
2208160	2209160	Make something, dammit.
2209160	2210880	The theme is a buggy game.
2210880	2213680	And the entries are due the next show.
2213680	2216480	Five o'clock Pacific, eight o'clock Eastern on Sunday the 11th.
2216480	2221800	So Loki's starting to realize he may have picked too big of a scope for a game to finish
2221800	2222800	in three weeks.
2222800	2224960	It's just taking a lot of time.
2224960	2227600	It's not that I had enough time.
2227600	2232760	It's just with the kids and everything it's hard to get time to work on stuff.
2232760	2237300	And I've stayed up late every night trying to do it.
2237300	2241500	And now that I have this bug in Unity that's making things look really ugly, it's kind
2241500	2244380	of pissing me off because it puts me even more behind.
2244380	2245380	You'll get there.
2245380	2246380	Ask for help.
2246380	2247380	Maybe somebody can help you.
2247380	2248380	Crack the code.
2248380	2249380	It's awesome.
2249380	2252420	Those guys we had on from Cooking with Unity a couple weeks ago, one of them is participating.
2252420	2253540	How amazing is that?
2253540	2256900	So I've seen some of the work you guys are doing on the VoG forums.
2256900	2257900	It's awesome.
2257900	2259300	I'm really hoping I can get something done.
2259300	2262460	I had a little setback because something with my day job came up.
2262460	2268540	So I have to work on that instead of a game when I have some free time.
2268540	2272500	So I really encourage people to make things for that and we will be talking about what
2272500	2274660	got submitted next week on the show.
2274660	2280300	Remember, your submissions should come to Jam at VoGnetwork.com.
2280300	2283620	More information is available at VoGnetwork.com in our forums.
2283620	2287860	Bobby's compiled a special forum for the Jam and there's a whole post there detailing all
2287860	2288860	the information.
2288860	2289860	So check that out.
2289860	2292100	Meanwhile, my gaming week.
2292100	2297420	So yes, I did play other games because I was sick over New Year's.
2297420	2300620	So I was going to buy something to make myself feel better.
2300620	2304340	And I decided to buy something on the Wii U that I've seen a lot of people talking really
2304340	2306020	fondly about on Twitter and stuff.
2306020	2307020	So I said, you know what?
2307020	2308020	I'm going to buy Captain Toad.
2308020	2310100	There's a lot of people who have been talking very highly of this game so I'm going to check
2310100	2312100	out this game and see what it's all about.
2312100	2318740	So I played a little bit of Captain Toad and it's those little levels from Mario 3D World.
2318780	2325220	You had these special puzzle levels that starred Toad or Captain Toad but he couldn't jump
2325220	2327180	and he was restricted a little bit.
2327180	2332820	And some of it was more about spatialness because you would be able to rotate the screen
2332820	2338900	around and have to figure out what corridor leads to that gem or how do I get to the star
2338900	2341460	from there to do that without jumping.
2341460	2350940	And so Captain Toad is kind of a game made up of that whole spatialness and puzzleness.
2350940	2357620	I got to admit, I'm not loving it like a lot of people seem to that I know on Twitter and
2357620	2358980	so forth.
2358980	2360900	But it's cute.
2360900	2365780	And I think if you realize what type of game you're going to get, I think it's worth looking
2365780	2366780	at.
2366780	2370420	Now I will say the game did earn a lot of points with me when I got to this one level
2370420	2373140	that it was starting to do something really different.
2373140	2376460	And granted, I haven't beat the game yet, I haven't had enough time.
2376460	2379620	But if the game is going to do more of that with some of the stages later on, then I can
2379620	2385380	see where, okay, this is the mine car level is the first time you get in a level that
2385380	2387220	does something different.
2387220	2393140	And it's really cool because on the game pad, you see a Pokemon Snap style thing where you're
2393140	2397940	looking around and you can throw the vegetables at different obstacles that are in the way
2397940	2398940	and so forth.
2398940	2404180	But then on the game screen, you just see the static, you know, what you would expect
2404180	2410060	of Toad in the cart going around, you know, more like a static picture, like if the level
2410060	2411060	was not interactive.
2411060	2416540	So I like that kind of, you know, how it worked between the game pad and the television because,
2416540	2420100	you know, despite the fact that this whole game pad thing is really Nintendo's baby and
2420100	2424080	their idea, a lot of games aren't using it extensively.
2424080	2428260	So it was nice to see that kind of taken advantage of in that Captain Toad level.
2428260	2435540	And I also really liked that because it detected data from Mario 3D Land, you're able to play
2435540	2441180	some stages from Mario 3D Land as Captain Toad, which is trickier than it sounds because
2441180	2445660	remember Captain Toad can't jump and he moves very slow.
2445660	2449780	But it's kind of neat to have to re-approach the levels from that perspective.
2449780	2454440	So I kind of thought it was a neat little twist to kind of combine the two things there.
2454440	2462000	But I still think $40 might be a little high for this, which I think was a lot of people's
2462000	2464940	reservation about this game.
2464940	2471440	But for what it is, it's still a Nintendo product and you know it has a lot of polish
2471440	2473960	and a lot of the levels are very vibrant.
2473960	2475740	The levels are very diverse.
2475740	2478500	That's a nice thing about it too, is that it's not like you're just playing the same
2478500	2481080	like planes level over and over.
2481080	2485560	Like even within the first four stages, you're in these completely different landscapes.
2485560	2489400	So in that regard, it's kind of neat and there are some different stuff that happens with
2489400	2491600	the challenges and the double cherries and things like that.
2491600	2497480	But I don't know, I guess I didn't fall in love with it the way I have other Wii U titles
2497480	2498480	this year.
2498480	2499960	Maybe I'm just not far enough into it.
2499960	2501240	I don't know.
2501240	2505520	But one thing, and this will be the last thing I'll say about Captain Toad, one thing I did
2505520	2509600	kind of feel like the game lacks compared to other very strong Nintendo titles for the
2509600	2511860	year is co-op.
2511860	2515320	There's really not a lot of reason to sit here and play this game with somebody else
2515320	2516320	in the same room.
2516320	2520700	There's nothing around that, unless it's something you unlock later, but you know, if it's behind
2520700	2524300	a lock and key, then I still consider it kind of not there, is that there's really not a
2524300	2527200	lot for more than one person to get involved with.
2527200	2531120	And when that's really Nintendo's strong point is creating these really strong multiplayer
2531120	2535840	fun games, like look at Mario Kart 8, look at the original Mario 3D World, look at, you
2535840	2540640	know, Super Smash Brothers Wii U, heck even Bayonetta 2 has an online mode.
2540640	2546080	You know, when you look at that being really Nintendo's strength, it is kind of a drawback
2546080	2551600	that Captain Toad is missing what is kind of Nintendo's forte in that regard.
2551600	2557760	So it's not bad, it's just not, I'm not really getting that same intense love for it I was
2557760	2560600	seeing a lot of on Twitter and so forth.
2560600	2566920	Going to the chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, DarkTetsuya says, the minecart level was great,
2566920	2570960	my brother was playing it and I was helping point out stuff to hit lol, it reminded me
2570960	2574160	of one of Miyamoto's tech demos back at E3 last year.
2574160	2578040	And maybe that's, you know, how it got incorporated.
2578040	2583440	Let's see, those are some of the comments from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
2583440	2591040	Also, and you'll get a kick out of this, because this was released on Virtual Console, Pokemon
2591040	2595840	Pinball came out on Virtual Console and I loved that game on Game Boy Advance, the Ruby
2595840	2600960	Sapphire Pokemon Pinball games, so I had to buy that and I was playing that on Virtual
2600960	2605380	Console and that's the first, excuse me, that's the first Game Boy Advance game I've played
2605380	2608520	on Virtual Console and it translates very well.
2608520	2612520	It's a surprising amount of fun to play on Wii U, it's like playing like a Super Nintendo
2612600	2614360	game on the TV or something.
2614360	2619920	So yeah, I like Pokemon Pinball, so that made me happy that that's out.
2619920	2624400	Otherwise a lot of the same old stuff that I've been playing, more Final Fantasy XIV,
2624400	2630600	more Diablo III seasonal before the season ends on February 2nd, I think they're saying,
2630600	2631600	and so on.
2631600	2635260	All right, let's get into some housekeeping real quick.
2635260	2640860	We will not be here the week after next, that is Martin Luther King weekend, which would
2640860	2648500	be January the 18th, we will not be here that weekend, because I will be in Seattle
2648500	2651820	with Alan, we're doing a late celebration for our anniversary and the holidays and all
2651820	2652820	that.
2652820	2655860	Because I'm going to be gone for such a big chunk of the weekend, we're actually not really
2655860	2659340	going to be able to tape in advance either, so we are just not going to be here that week.
2659340	2663260	Sorry guys, taking a little break, but you can use the opportunity to catch up on the
2663260	2669860	backlog of OLR episodes or donate your time to another fantastic independent podcast,
2669860	2673740	there's so many great ones out there, I'd encourage you to look up.
2673740	2679000	Of course I'm going to point to those on our family at vognetwork.com, but no matter where
2679000	2683940	you pull your podcast from, do support other independent broadcasters, there's a lot of
2683940	2685260	hardworking people out there.
2685260	2688540	So that's in two weeks, there will be no live show and there will actually not be a podcast
2688540	2692420	that week either, we will finally be taking our holiday break a little late.
2692420	2696820	All right, let's go around and get into some news tonight.
2696820	2701980	What little there is this week, with it being the new year and a lot of companies still
2701980	2706420	off and people are working and there's not a lot of inertia coming off the Christmas
2706420	2709820	week, it's slow out there this week, but we have a little bit.
2709820	2712340	It's not coming out either, I mean it's just slow.
2712340	2713980	It's just how it is this time of year.
2713980	2714980	It's time to catch up.
2714980	2719060	That's right, this is the catch up time of year, absolutely.
2719060	2724180	And unfortunately one of the things you weren't able to catch up on was being able to be online
2724180	2729860	on PlayStation Network during this holiday season, because it was being DDOS and that
2729860	2731140	fun stuff.
2731140	2736860	Well, there is at least a little bit of an upside there, going to be compensating you
2736860	2738420	for the time that it was down.
2738420	2744940	So Sony is offering five extra days of PlayStation Plus, as well as a one time use 10% code for
2744940	2746980	the PlayStation Store.
2746980	2751300	And basically saying they wanted to show their appreciation for the user's patience after
2751300	2754220	the outage last month.
2754220	2761620	And I guess the 10% off is one time discount off of a total cart purchase in the PlayStation
2761620	2762620	Store.
2762620	2767940	So, God I hope that wasn't used when I bought that $1.99 DLC the other day.
2767940	2770060	No, I think it's coming soon.
2770060	2774060	I think you have to physically put that in your cart in order, I think you'll know when
2774060	2775060	you're spending it.
2775060	2776060	Okay, I guess.
2776060	2777060	That would have sucked.
2777060	2779060	Saved 19 cents.
2779060	2780060	Thanks.
2780060	2782060	What do you think about that?
2782060	2786660	Do you think that's a fair compromise for PlayStation being inaccessible over the Christmas
2786660	2787660	holiday?
2787660	2789260	I think that's fine.
2789260	2792260	I mean, they didn't even really have to do this kind of thing, just give us the extra
2792260	2793260	days.
2793260	2796300	Okay, you weren't able to get on, so we're going to send it out this many days.
2796300	2799580	I don't see that as being that difficult.
2799580	2803500	I know I was kind of the one last week that gave this a little bit of a hard time, and
2803500	2807420	I didn't want to sound like one of those whiners or gimme gimme, but the fact of the matter
2807420	2812500	was PlayStation was down for four days, and whether that was because of an outside attack
2812500	2818540	or not, we still are paying for that time, so I said, all I want is for Sony to come
2818540	2822100	out and say, hey, something happened, we're going to give you those days back.
2822100	2824540	And that's what they did, so I'm happy.
2824540	2827340	They came back and gave even an extra day, they gave five days.
2827340	2833500	Aren't you glad that the console of your console gaming choice doesn't disable you from playing
2833500	2838860	games when you can't connect online like one console might have?
2838860	2846100	Well, actually, if you are building up a library through PlayStation Plus, if you happen to
2846100	2850300	be past your expiration day, which Christmas probably was expiration day on PlayStation
2850300	2854420	Plus for a lot of people, if you're past that and it can't re-authenticate your PlayStation
2854420	2857160	Plus license, you can't play those games.
2857160	2861020	And Bobby was telling a story on his show tonight, he was trying to play Pinball Arcade,
2861020	2865620	and the way that Farsight Studios set it up to authenticate the table licenses, because
2865620	2867720	PlayStation Network was down, he couldn't play that.
2867720	2872940	So even though Sony came out and made this big deal about, oh, you don't have to be online
2872940	2878500	to authenticate, because of the way some games are developed, you do.
2878500	2883900	And some of the biggest, I mean, one might argue that the biggest title on PlayStation
2883900	2888180	4 this holiday season was Destiny, and that's online only.
2888180	2893540	So I mean, I don't know, yes and no with that.
2893540	2898740	But anyway, I don't want to sound like too much, I hate to be that cynical negative gamer.
2898740	2905300	I mean, things aren't perfect sometimes, but at the end of the day, last week, this is
2905300	2909420	all I said I wanted, and I think the compensation they're doing is fine.
2909420	2914700	Maybe, I mean, if I really wanted to nickel and dime things, which I'm not, but I just
2914700	2921580	want to say, maybe seven days, so that way everybody guaranteed gets a weekend, which
2921580	2926680	makes up for, oh, this is a time of year when we're away on a holiday break or whatever,
2926680	2931380	if everybody had that weekend, but five days is enough where you're going to probably get
2931380	2934100	at least one day out of the weekend.
2934100	2937340	So I'm not going to sit here and be like, oh, it's not good enough.
2937340	2938340	It's fine.
2938340	2942780	I'm happy, I'm not going to cancel PS Plus, I'm still very supportive of Sony and everything
2942780	2943780	they're doing.
2943860	2950580	I think this is fine, and the 10% off coupon is nice, but at the same time, it's kind of
2950580	2955060	like, well, it's not like Sony doesn't stand a profit off of that.
2955060	2959620	I mean, because if somebody is going to spend money on the PlayStation Store just to utilize
2959620	2964260	this 10% off coupon that they've got, then they've still spent money on the PlayStation
2964260	2966500	Store they might not have otherwise.
2966500	2970840	So I sort of see that as a non-issue.
2970840	2972880	That's a nice thing.
2972880	2978840	And for those that buy stuff online anyway and might have a $50 game they were planning
2978840	2983440	to buy digitally anyway, this is a really nice little reward for that.
2983440	2987080	But I also see it just like any other coupon you might get in the mail.
2987080	2992120	It's incentive for you to go and utilize the store and get something you might not have
2992120	2996840	otherwise because, ooh, I got to get a bargain type of thing.
2996840	3000960	But I mean, I realize there's a lot of people out there who buy a lot of games digitally.
3000960	3006680	And so if you're going to stock up on stuff, if you bought two games online digitally in
3006680	3011400	January and used this 10% off coupon, you could save like 10 bucks, which is nothing
3011400	3012400	to scoff at.
3012400	3014720	So this is going to be nice for some people.
3014720	3017800	So there you go.
3017800	3021800	Darsakra, I don't know if you have a comment on if you think this is sufficient enough
3021800	3024520	compensation for the downtime.
3024520	3026920	What do you think hearing this, what PlayStation is doing with this?
3026920	3030040	Well, someone in corporate had to think it was sufficient.
3030040	3032760	So there's always going to be people who are going to bitch.
3032760	3033760	Yeah.
3033760	3038320	Oh, we're not going to get this free thing or we don't think we have enough.
3038320	3039320	Yeah.
3039320	3040320	Too bad.
3040320	3041320	Yeah.
3041320	3046940	And I don't buy the whole, we should get free games out of it because I kind of think PlayStation
3046940	3052400	Plus is really the leader in giving the free games as it is.
3052400	3054000	They're way ahead of the competition.
3054000	3058600	I realize Microsoft's giving away free games too, but let's be real, the bar of the stuff
3058600	3062240	they've been giving away hasn't quite caught up to PlayStation yet.
3062240	3067000	It's getting closer, but they were giving away years old games.
3067000	3069960	And I think a lot of it had to do with that authentication stuff we were talking about
3069960	3070960	when it first started.
3070960	3076040	On 360, they couldn't, once you got it, you would have it forever, unlike PlayStation
3076040	3079520	Plus, where if you lose PlayStation Plus, you lose the game.
3079520	3083200	And Microsoft didn't have that for a long time, which was affecting the quality of the
3083200	3085160	games they were giving away, I think.
3085160	3086800	But now they fixed that, right?
3086800	3092080	So now that's why the quality on Microsoft's gone up a little bit.
3092080	3094440	And Rama says, free games, my ass.
3094440	3095440	That's true.
3095440	3100840	They're not really free because you are paying that fee for them, but I mean, it was a lot
3100840	3101840	of games.
3101840	3108080	I mean, at the end of the day, consumer is free to make their own choice, but as a gamer,
3108080	3112660	one who uses consoles quite a bit, I found quite a bit of value in the PlayStation Plus
3112660	3113660	games that came out.
3113660	3118420	So it's just a bummer when the network's down and can't authenticate those games.
3118420	3125500	So, all right, moving on to the next story, which has to do with people that get free
3125500	3131060	games through their own dark methods, which is the Talos Principle.
3131060	3134940	The Talos Principle, it was revealed this week that if you are one of the people that
3134940	3139540	illegally downloaded this game, which Bobby last week on the show said was his favorite
3139540	3145120	game of the year, 2014, if you illegally downloaded or pirated the Talos Principle,
3145120	3149460	there's going to be an elevator in the game that will trap you in it, and there will be
3149460	3153180	no way to progress past the elevator.
3153180	3158320	And of course, this was discovered when somebody went to the forum to complain, help, I'm trapped
3158320	3159320	in the elevator.
3159320	3163080	I think they posted a screen cap and said, elevator doesn't work.
3163080	3167460	And the first response in the thread said, congratulations, you must be the first one
3167460	3172160	to show to the internet world what Croteam did this time to punish pirates.
3172160	3173420	You should be proud of yourself.
3173420	3177140	It'll be all over the internet in about 30 minutes, I'd say.
3177140	3180860	And sure enough, I think this guy's response ended up being something like, at least I'll
3180860	3183980	be famous for something, or something a little silly like that.
3183980	3188600	But yeah, so if you pirated the Talos Principle, you're not going to be able to get past this
3188600	3193380	particular elevator level that is until the pirates figure out their way around it.
3193380	3200020	But this is just another entry, and kind of a long-running list of how games are getting
3200020	3203420	back at pirates, or taking little jabs at them.
3203420	3209040	Like there was that game dev tycoon game a year or two ago, where it was about making
3209040	3215140	a game, and in a huge bit of irony, if you pirated that game, then piracy would ultimately
3215140	3219340	destroy the game that you made, and you would not be able to beat the game, period.
3219340	3222480	And then of course a lot of people know those stories about like Earthbound on the Super
3222520	3227140	Nintendo, yes even cartridges had anti-piracy measures in them, the enemies would be super
3227140	3229920	hard, and then what was it, you'd get to the very last boss in the game and it would delete
3229920	3233760	your save, something like that was what Earthbound would do.
3233760	3238320	And then there's other examples of this as well, you see this happening in a lot of games.
3238320	3242800	But I think a lot of us kinda, I don't know about you guys, but I get a kick out of seeing
3242800	3247840	the game companies take a little jab at piracy like this, because you know, they gotta sell
3247840	3251680	the games to be able to afford to pay the people to make them.
3251680	3256800	So, you know, however you want to justify piracy in your own mind, if you're the type
3256800	3260200	of person that copies games and doesn't pay for them or whatever.
3260200	3264440	I bet you're the same person that steals candy from babies!
3264440	3266440	Pirates.
3266440	3269800	But the reality is, if they can't pay their employees to make the game, then there's not
3269800	3270800	going to be a game.
3270800	3273320	That's, you know, just what it is.
3273320	3277920	So I always find these little tongue-in-cheek ways of getting back at the pirates kind of
3277920	3278920	funny.
3278920	3283760	And then at least it ends up being a demo for the game, and if people decide they like
3283760	3287040	the game enough, maybe they'll put down the money to buy it.
3287040	3289040	Nope, they'll just patch it.
3289040	3292640	Yeah, unfortunately that probably is what'll happen.
3292640	3293640	Alright.
3293640	3294640	Nope.
3294640	3296980	Well, I thought it was a clever little thing anyway.
3296980	3298400	That is clever.
3298400	3302720	That's a game in my backlog that I definitely want to get to as the Talos Principle, for
3302720	3303720	sure.
3303720	3305900	So, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
3305900	3307880	We never get to our backlog, what are you talking about?
3307880	3308880	I know, right?
3308880	3313240	Well, there is a little bit of news out of Steamland, and it actually has to do with
3313240	3316160	two Sega games that are in the same franchise.
3316160	3323160	Aliens, Colonial Marines, and Aliens vs. Predator are gone through Steam.
3323160	3324160	Gone!
3324160	3328600	The chances are that this probably has to do with the licenses expiring, so they need
3328600	3332520	to renew the licenses before they'll be back for purchase.
3332520	3335080	But yeah, they are right now gone.
3335080	3338680	I mean, didn't we have the same thing with Crysis before?
3338680	3345400	Well, actually, licensed games, a lot of them have disappeared in digital distribution channels
3345400	3346920	the end of this year.
3346920	3350000	Scott Pilgrim, the game on console is no longer there.
3350000	3351000	Uno on Xbox.
3351000	3355260	Well, you can still get the digital versions on some online sites, like I think Green Man
3355260	3360320	Gaming still offers them, and you can activate them on Steam, or you can buy the physical
3360320	3361320	versions.
3361320	3362320	Yeah.
3362320	3365640	I mean, Alien Isolation was supposed to be pretty darn good.
3365640	3368560	Yeah, I'm hearing good things about that, but who's gonna really buy Alien and Colonial
3368560	3369560	Marines?
3369560	3370560	Who's gonna be buying that?
3370560	3374560	I wanted to like that game just because it has Hendrickson in it.
3374560	3382440	And I'll just listen to him and go, Bishop, or, you know, what was his face in Mass Effect?
3382440	3383440	I'm here.
3383440	3384440	Hackett.
3384440	3385440	Yeah, Hackett.
3385440	3386440	Commander Hackett.
3386440	3387440	Admiral.
3387440	3388440	Admiral, sorry.
3388560	3392720	I will say, hands down, that Alien Isolation was the scariest game of the year last year
3392720	3394240	and it's worth checking out.
3394240	3397040	Scarier than Five Nights at Freddy's?
3397040	3398480	Scarier than Five Nights at Freddy's?
3398480	3399880	Scarier than P.T.?
3399880	3401940	Scarier than Slender Man?
3401940	3402940	Like scarier than all of that?
3402940	3407960	Well, you know the first Alien, for the movies that is, was supposed to be a space horror
3407960	3408960	movie.
3408960	3409960	Right.
3409960	3415780	And then, Aliens was more done as an action sci-fi, you know, which honestly, Aliens is
3415780	3420500	probably one of the best movies of our generation.
3420500	3421500	Right.
3421500	3426160	Which is why they still make video games out of it, even though maybe the third and fourth
3426160	3430580	movie weren't as, you know, legendary as that second movie.
3430580	3435460	The fact that that movie is so fucking good is why they keep making games out of it.
3435460	3437380	I will sit and just watch the extended cut.
3437380	3441900	And I really wanted to watch Resurrection, just to hear the Joss dialogue, but apparently
3441900	3445740	they just ruined the whole story that he had written.
3445740	3450940	But I like that there are games that are going back to the feel of the first movie,
3450940	3454080	having it be kind of a survival horror sort of thing.
3454080	3457980	And that's why I wanted to play Isolation, but I had too many games and never bought
3457980	3458980	it.
3458980	3463660	You know, it's funny, I saw that Alien Resurrection in theaters years and years ago, and you know
3463660	3466320	I don't get out to movies an awful lot, but that was, I think that movie came out when
3466320	3469500	I was in college when I went to the movies a little more, and I went and saw that one.
3469500	3472580	I don't remember hating it, like I thought it was kind of like, okay, it's just a big
3472580	3478480	silly action movie, which Aliens is not exactly a big silly movie, like it's just a really
3478480	3479480	good...
3479480	3480700	It's a hardcore awesome action film.
3480700	3484420	So it's kind of hard to see a series like that devolve into silly action movies.
3484420	3486020	It has some of the best ad lib stuff in it too.
3486020	3487980	Yeah, but I don't remember hating Alien Resurrection.
3487980	3492180	Well, the thing is that from everyone that's told me that you can see the good movie it
3492180	3496920	tried to be, except for people going in and changing shit.
3496920	3498820	And I had two reasons for wanting to see it.
3498820	3500340	Well, three reasons.
3500340	3501340	Sigourney Weaver.
3501340	3502340	Yep.
3503100	3504340	I love Winona Ryder.
3504340	3505340	I love her so much.
3505340	3506340	I really love her.
3506340	3510060	I mean, she's kind of, ever since that shoplifting incident, really kind of ruined her, didn't
3510060	3511060	it?
3511060	3512240	Well, she played Spock's mom and that was awesome.
3512240	3513240	That was awesome.
3513240	3514240	I lived for that.
3514240	3517060	And, well, you should watch the deleted scenes she was in in that too.
3517060	3518060	Oh, I haven't seen that.
3518060	3519060	I need to.
3519060	3522460	But the other thing was script by Joss.
3522460	3524240	And I like Whedon dialogue.
3524240	3525240	I'm sorry.
3525240	3529580	And just, I think it would be heartbreaking to go see it, knowing what it could have been.
3529820	3532020	Well, it was also a very famous director that did that.
3532020	3535500	And I, of course I say that and now I can't remember the guy's name, but he had made City
3535500	3540700	of Lost Children, Delicatessen, and all these very visual movies.
3540700	3542580	I love City of Lost Children.
3542580	3543580	Yeah.
3543580	3545260	It was that, that was the director based on that movie.
3545260	3548300	They asked him to do Alien Resurrection, a French guy, and I can't remember the guy's
3548300	3549300	name.
3549300	3550300	Somebody in chat will yell it out.
3550300	3552300	That's why I love doing this live.
3552300	3553300	Who needs Google?
3553300	3556300	I got a chat room.
3556300	3558980	So anyway, uh, let's see it.
3558980	3561460	Look in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
3561460	3564620	Rageinator says, yeah, I saw Alien Resurrection in theaters too.
3564620	3567860	Sadly enough, not too long after that, my grandmother was rushed to the hospital and
3567860	3568860	ultimately died.
3568860	3569860	Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that.
3569860	3574940	That kind of sucks when you have to associate something that might've been pretty good with
3574940	3575940	a really bad memory.
3575940	3578700	But anyway, I don't want to take this too much to a dark place.
3578700	3583320	Tiger Claw says you heard about Neil Blomkamp wanting to do an Alien 5.
3583320	3584320	That looked pretty awesome.
3584320	3586060	I'm sure there's a lot of people.
3586060	3587060	That looked pretty awesome.
3587060	3588060	That want to do an Alien 5.
3588060	3592140	Well, he was supposed to, I guess, originally, yeah, he was going to do that as his debut.
3592140	3593140	Jean-Pierre Jeunet.
3593140	3594140	Thank you.
3594140	3595140	Thank you.
3595140	3596140	STR 100 Matt.
3596140	3597140	Jean-Pierre Jeunet.
3597140	3598140	Yeah.
3598140	3600100	The, the, uh, was it artwork for that looked pretty sweet.
3600100	3601100	And that's it.
3601100	3602200	I knew he did Amelie.
3602200	3607100	So he came after Alien Resurrection, he did Amelie, which is like one of.
3607100	3608700	I need to finish that movie.
3608700	3613340	It's one of, it's honestly like one of the best movies of the last decade.
3613340	3615380	I can actually follow most of the dialogue in it too.
3615380	3616380	I see.
3616380	3617380	Oh, really?
3617380	3620260	And I don't know if you remember, remember when I got a really, really short haircut?
3620260	3621700	I got her haircut.
3621700	3625620	And then Amelie Resurrection just gets really strange when they start trying to blend the
3625620	3626620	two genres together.
3626620	3629620	It's just, I didn't understand that, but okay.
3629620	3630980	Oh, Ron Perlman.
3630980	3634460	But watching Winona Ryder in that was a lot of fun too.
3634460	3636860	Making that safe expression.
3636860	3640920	I have a lot of love though for, for Aliens in the first movie.
3640920	3643340	Actually even liked the third one, so maybe I should see Resurrection.
3643340	3646380	I was trying to see what else John, that director's done.
3646380	3649420	He did a movie called A Very Long Engagement, which I don't remember that movie.
3649420	3650420	I've heard of it.
3650420	3652020	But he did that movie.
3652020	3655060	And then he was kind of on a break for a little while.
3655060	3658860	He did a movie in 2013 called The Young and Prodigious T.S.
3658860	3660120	Spivet.
3660120	3661740	Never heard of that.
3661740	3662860	Never heard of that.
3662860	3665620	But Helena Bonham- We just need to get guns back for another
3665620	3666620	second though.
3666620	3669420	Oh my God, Helena Bonham Carter's in that though, and she, she is a queen.
3669420	3671140	She is a queen in acting.
3671140	3675500	I mean, come on, Helena Bonham Carter, like in every Tim Burton movie, just fucking steals
3675500	3676500	it.
3676500	3677500	She left him.
3677500	3678500	Yeah, I heard about that.
3678500	3680220	I think she's going to go for Johnny Depp.
3680220	3682220	I don't know.
3682220	3684260	It's the OLR Hollywood gossip hour.
3684260	3686380	This is what happens when there's no gaming news.
3686380	3690700	But it started from a second of how awesome the Alien franchise could be.
3690700	3693100	You want to talk about like, I don't know, that-
3693100	3694700	No, I want to talk about Winona Ryder.
3694700	3698060	I want to talk more about Winona Ryder.
3698060	3699060	Winona Ryder?
3699060	3700060	Let's talk about that.
3700060	3701060	Alright, yes.
3701060	3702060	No, Beetlejuice 2.
3702060	3704820	I'm so fucking psyched to see that whenever the hell that comes out.
3704820	3705820	That's going to be fantastic.
3705820	3707100	Okay, okay, wait.
3707100	3709180	Michael Keaton will be in a wheelchair by the time he-
3709180	3710180	I don't care.
3710180	3711180	It'll still be good.
3711180	3712420	That's what CG is for.
3712420	3714020	Ranma wins the internet today.
3714020	3715020	What?
3715020	3719440	No, they're fighting for custody over Johnny Depp.
3719440	3724620	I'm sorry, but yeah, Tim Burton- Johnny Depp is a maniac pixie girl.
3724620	3728020	The definitive Burton- Look, I know you want us to talk games, but there's no fucking news
3728020	3729320	this week, so deal with it.
3729320	3734480	The definitive Burton film for me, which is also a Winona Ryder classic and a Johnny
3734480	3739000	Depp classic, and probably one of my favorite movies ever, is Edward Scissorhands.
3739000	3740000	I love that movie.
3740000	3741000	The movie is so fucking good.
3741000	3742000	I cry every time.
3742000	3743000	Every time.
3743000	3744000	Like a little baby.
3744000	3745000	Every time she's dancing in the-
3745000	3746000	If I cry-
3746000	3747000	Every time she's dancing in the snow, I cry.
3747000	3748000	Every time.
3748000	3749000	If I watch it right now, I'd be crying green tears.
3749000	3750000	I would-
3750000	3751000	I have green mascara too.
3751000	3752800	We need to do like a Let's React video to watching Edward Scissorhands.
3752800	3753800	Let's do it.
3753800	3755400	Isn't that the thing people do on YouTube?
3755400	3756400	Let's react.
3756400	3757400	Let's do it.
3757600	3760760	That's what thousands and millions of people have seen, but you want to see our reaction
3760760	3761760	to it.
3761760	3762760	Do the thing.
3762760	3763760	Do the thing.
3763760	3766760	Loki, you want to join us for a Let's React to Edward Scissorhands?
3766760	3769760	I don't get affected that much by Edward Scissorhands.
3769760	3771960	You wouldn't cry manly tears just a little bit?
3771960	3772960	I like the movie.
3772960	3776200	I think it's awesome, but I'm not going to cry over it.
3776200	3779660	But we need your man tears.
3779660	3782400	As a proper feminist, I thrive on the tears of men.
3782400	3783400	I'm kidding.
3783400	3784400	I'm kidding.
3784400	3785400	That's bad.
3787400	3788400	All right.
3788400	3794600	Raginator says in chat, the only Burton movie that I cared for was the 1989 Batman.
3794600	3795600	I prefer-
3795600	3797960	Speaking of which, the NES game is fucking amazing.
3797960	3801200	I preferred Batman Returns, not the game because the game was kind of crap.
3801200	3805600	The movie Batman Returns, as much as I understand why people hated the penguin, Catwoman was
3805600	3806760	just perfection.
3806760	3808500	Nobody will ever match Michelle Pfeiffer.
3808500	3810800	She got the whip scene in one take.
3810800	3811800	Amazing.
3811800	3812800	I love her.
3812800	3814380	And she was in Grease 2.
3814380	3816040	I don't mind Danny DeVito as a penguin.
3816040	3817200	I thought it was okay.
3817200	3821100	And Dungeon Buster says in chat, Vincent Price almost gave him real hands.
3821100	3822100	That's right.
3822100	3826360	One of Vincent Price's last roles was in that movie.
3826360	3827360	I know.
3827360	3828360	Let's just think about Vincent Price for a minute.
3828360	3831700	We're going to let Loki do the next story because it's his anyway.
3831700	3835180	And Rob and I are just going to sit in a corner and eat these chocolate chip cookies and cry.
3835180	3836180	That's fine.
3836180	3840520	Rob, I hope you have tissues because this is expensive mascara.
3840520	3842160	It's Pantone Emerald Green today.
3842160	3843160	Hello.
3843160	3844960	But there's actually Kleenex on the table for the show.
3844960	3845960	It's like-
3845960	3846960	I'm sorry.
3847720	3848720	Next story.
3848720	3849720	Loki, take us back to games.
3849720	3853720	Since I didn't read the fine print on this story originally, today I was like, ooh, January,
3853720	3856200	I'm going to see what new PlayStation Plus games are on there.
3856200	3857880	Nope, they're not there yet.
3857880	3860360	But yes, they will be as of Tuesday.
3860360	3862960	And what can you expect on PlayStation Plus for the month of January?
3862960	3864640	Well, actually some pretty cool stuff.
3864640	3868840	For example, on PlayStation 4, as we already knew, we're getting Infamous First Light,
3868840	3872920	which is the standalone expansion for Infamous Second Son.
3872920	3877680	And then also the indie game is Swapper, will be as part of the PlayStation 4 section.
3877680	3882400	And then for PlayStation 3, you get Prototype 2 and DuckTales Remastered.
3882400	3889520	And then finally on the Vita, Woah Dave and Duke Nukem 3D Megaton Edition, which that's
3889520	3893580	awesome that you can play Duke Nukem 3D on your Vita.
3893580	3895260	There's a reason to have a Vita right there.
3895260	3897120	Or a PlayStation TV, I guess.
3897120	3900960	Did you know that Duke Nukem 3D is actually now in the current Humble Bundle?
3900960	3902440	I did actually hear about that.
3902440	3905000	I think we're going to talk more about the Humble Bundle that's up right now later in
3905000	3906000	the show.
3906000	3907000	But yeah, I noticed that.
3907000	3908000	That's the problem with the Humble Bundles.
3908000	3910720	I'm starting to own all the games that are on every single one now.
3910720	3912880	Yeah, but you can actually gift your codes now.
3912880	3918360	I understand that, but I have my gift code library or whatever is getting about be as
3918360	3919360	big as my Steam library.
3919360	3920360	I'm being pointed at.
3920360	3922880	You were talking before the show and you probably don't want me to bring this up on air, but
3922880	3923880	I don't care.
3923880	3926320	You were talking before the show about your idea about the multiplayer streams that you
3926320	3930440	and I and maybe Loki can do on Twitch or whatever.
3930440	3931920	We fucking need to do Duke Nukem.
3931920	3934800	Oh, no, no, no, not even Duke Nukem Forever.
3934800	3935800	It can't be that shit.
3935800	3937800	It has to be Duke Nukem 3D Deathmatch.
3937800	3938800	In the bundle, Duke Nukem 3D.
3938800	3939800	Deathmatch.
3939800	3940800	Deathmatch Duke Nukem 3D.
3940800	3941800	Where you can put in the voice macros.
3941800	3942960	We can get Loki to do that one.
3942960	3943960	You can put in the voice macros.
3943960	3944960	I don't remember my PC.
3944960	3947400	Rob, no, no, no, no, no, no.
3947400	3949740	There are special things about Duke Nukem 3D.
3949740	3952240	It was my first land game.
3952240	3954240	Mobicon 1995.
3954240	3958440	Oh, I've told the story about the college dorms and the dial-up and playing Duke Nukem
3958440	3963640	3D where us little nerds, me and my best friend in the dorms in college.
3963640	3964640	We were neighbors.
3964640	3967980	We lived right next to each other and adjoining rooms that were next to each other.
3967980	3973880	And all the bros, sports player, football guys would love to watch us play.
3973880	3978960	And they were the biggest drama queens out of anybody I've ever met in my life because
3978960	3981080	they would be gossiping like, where you at?
3981080	3982080	Where you at?
3982080	3984520	And then they'd look and then they would run to the other room and tell my friend where
3984520	3986600	I'm hiding and where I'm camping so that he could kill me.
3986600	3987600	Those bitches.
3987600	3989520	I'm like you little gossipy bitches.
3989520	3990520	Those catty bitches.
3990520	3991520	Go out and throw your ball.
3991520	3995600	I wish I had some of my old maps they made during high school.
3995600	3996920	There are some pretty awesome maps.
3996920	4001800	You're probably the type that made a map where somebody would fall an entire mile down the
4001800	4005000	map for no good reason than you wanted them to do that.
4005000	4006000	I did.
4006000	4007000	Of course you did.
4007000	4008000	But no, it wasn't.
4008000	4010360	It was a great reason because you could do midair battles.
4010360	4015280	But yes, I literally, because you hit page down to lower the floor of the map.
4015280	4020240	So I put a paperweight on page down and went and had lunch and came back and that was part
4020240	4021460	of my map.
4021460	4024720	The fall was a good five to six minutes long.
4024720	4028960	But Duke Nukem 3D gave me one of my favorite, favorite insults ever.
4028960	4031980	Your face, your ass, what's the difference?
4031980	4037240	And I still have a WAV file from that back from AOL 2.5 days when you can play WAV files
4037240	4041500	in chat rooms and it's in my damn WAV file collection.
4041500	4043280	You could do that on instant messenger too.
4043280	4044280	Yes, you could.
4045280	4047280	That's what we did before emoticons.
4047280	4048280	Yeah.
4048280	4049280	We played WAVs.
4049280	4050280	Yeah.
4050280	4051400	You would send the WAV on AOL instant messenger.
4051400	4053120	Your face, your ass, what's the difference?
4053120	4055720	And today we have the smiling pile of poop emoticon.
4055720	4058480	Oh the smiling pile of poop.
4058480	4059480	You know what?
4059480	4060480	What?
4060480	4065920	I used to have a theme song that would play every time I'd go into a chat room back in
4065920	4067760	the Sailor Moon chat room on AOL.
4067760	4069160	I'm sure that wasn't annoying whatsoever.
4069160	4072320	Who remembers Town Square Sailor Moon?
4072320	4073320	I do.
4074320	4079240	Oh look at this, you gotta love the Google-Fu of the live chatters.
4079240	4080240	You gotta love this.
4080240	4083320	Tigerclaw dug this up in like 30 seconds.
4083320	4086240	Your face, your ass, what's the difference?
4086240	4088400	Oh yeah.
4088400	4091520	We also had a really horrible one that we would use, and I know it's not politically
4091520	4098320	correct but I'm gonna say it anyway, is like, who are you, the poster child for abortion?
4098320	4099320	Who was it?
4099320	4100320	I don't remember that one, didn't I?
4100320	4102560	It was a voice macro that one of my friends made.
4102560	4108160	Who was it that used to do that during, who was it, it was one of the games we'd play
4108160	4112760	like a VOG game night or something like that that someone would play those macros through.
4112760	4119120	That was when we were playing Perfect Dark, and I want to say it was like me and Breslull,
4119120	4123640	maybe Travis Donovan was in on that too, but I think it was SSGA 100 Matt had one of those
4123640	4127440	little like adapter things for the Xbox 360 controller so he could drop in those little
4127440	4131200	clips while we're trying to play on Xbox, I think it was like a Perfect Dark match we
4131200	4135780	were all playing, and SSGA 100 Matt was being a little smart ass, so I think he called into
4135780	4140480	the show and talked about it around that time, just go look up the show from whenever Perfect
4140480	4141520	Dark was released.
4141520	4146560	For the record, I would never say something like that to somebody.
4146560	4147560	To their face.
4147560	4150920	No, ever, because I don't think that's something they make fun of.
4150920	4151920	Alright.
4151920	4154240	I'm a good girl, dammit!
4154240	4155240	Mmhmm.
4155240	4156240	Alright.
4157240	4162320	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,
4162320	4164880	use the passphrase, hammer.
4164880	4165880	Let's move on.
4165880	4169040	Well, if you're a good girl that wants to be bad, very very very bad, you could play
4169040	4175200	a very naughty, very graphic, very gory game, such as Mortal Kombat X.
4175200	4177920	Darsaka, are you looking forward to Mortal Kombat X?
4177920	4178920	Fuck no.
4178920	4181680	I thought this would be the type of game that's up your alley.
4181680	4185960	I don't know, these, I like me some Mortal Kombat, don't get me wrong, it's always been
4185960	4192760	my favorite fighting franchise because it's a little bit over the top and silly and cartoon
4192760	4199460	violent, but when I'm seeing the new one and the movies and stuff and the fatality images
4199460	4203360	that are coming from the new Mortal Kombat, I'm like, this is starting to get a little
4203360	4204360	too real for me.
4204360	4208920	I mean, I realize it's over the top, but now we're crossing that line into Saw movie territory
4208920	4210480	and I don't know how that makes me feel.
4210480	4211480	That's awesome.
4211480	4212480	Yeah.
4213000	4218520	I don't know, some of the stuff is, it's gross, but regardless, I'll probably make my mom
4218520	4222920	play this one too and record it and put it on the internet because it's funny.
4222920	4227720	But Mortal Kombat X, some more information came out about this one, and this is thanks
4227720	4233640	to a Finnish gaming magazine who I guess got to see some more information by taking a trip
4233640	4240000	to the studios, and one of the new fighters that they unveiled is an older Kung Lao because
4240000	4244000	this game does take place a little later on in the Mortal Kombat history.
4244000	4247920	So now you have a Kung Lao who still has the hat with a bunch of spikes on it, but now
4247920	4254920	a little bit of the gray mustache and beard thing going on there, and they talk about
4254920	4259200	that some of the differences with the Tempest and Buzzsaw and Hat Trick variations are some
4259200	4261160	of the biggest ones yet.
4261160	4264940	He uses more spinning attacks and has the ability to set his hat to spin around him
4264940	4266560	as a shield of sorts.
4266560	4270800	And the Buzzsaw variation, his hat is sharpened with razor blade edges and allows the player
4270800	4272880	to control the hat that throws more.
4272880	4276720	And then Hat Trick is an experimental one because you can throw and call back your hat
4276720	4278560	at any point you want.
4278560	4282420	This keeps the opponent on their toes because the hat can extend combos.
4282420	4285960	Don't forget the fighters in Mortal Kombat X, they're going to have these different variations.
4285960	4287680	That's part of the game.
4287680	4291000	They'll be different flavors of the same character.
4291000	4294800	It's kind of their experimental place that they're going.
4294800	4296180	So yeah, that's pretty neat.
4296180	4301200	Some other little tidbits on Mortal Kombat X. Ed Boon talking about that the online features
4301200	4303660	are more complex this time around.
4303660	4308000	When you start the game, you get to choose your own alliance from five different options.
4308000	4311820	The Lin Kuei, the White Lotus, the Brotherhood of Shadows, the Special Force, and the Black
4311820	4312820	Dragon.
4312820	4316740	And so your team will be gathering battle points for the team, which will decide how
4316740	4319900	the game menus look in single and multiplayer.
4319900	4324980	So every player contributes to the entirety, whether or not you prefer the social aspects
4324980	4325980	or playing by yourself.
4325980	4331800	That sounds kind of neat, that everybody will be championing a different faction, and whatever
4331800	4334820	faction is in the lead kind of controls what everybody sees.
4334820	4342060	And you're Slytherin, and you're Hufflepuff, and you're Gryffindor.
4342060	4348320	Harry has decapitated his opponent, ten points to Gryffindor.
4348320	4351100	It's extreme quidditch is what this all is.
4351100	4355740	Kung Lao's just going to hop on a broom and fly around, and him and Cassie Cage and all
4355740	4360740	these other new people that are showing up in the game.
4360740	4363820	Have you seen some of the fatalities out of Mortal Kombat X?
4363820	4368740	I gotta say, Joystiq ran an article this week talking about, I don't know, it was talking
4368740	4371500	about why do we like gory games so damn much or whatever.
4371500	4375540	And there was some picture that went with the article that's like this new bug queen
4375540	4378980	or whatever she is that's one of the new playable characters in the game.
4378980	4384940	It was a gif of, and yes I said gif, deal with it, it was a gif of her fatality where
4384940	4389900	these bugs fly out and eat Scorpion's head.
4389900	4394500	It's not just enough, like in the old games it would have been LOL, his face melted and
4394500	4395500	that's it.
4395500	4397620	But it wasn't enough because now it has to go over the top.
4397620	4402020	Not only do the bugs eat away his face, but then they eat so much of his face that his
4402020	4408260	jaw snaps off, then his head falls off and rolls on the ground, and if that wasn't enough,
4408260	4411540	she takes her heel and stomps out his head.
4411540	4414600	She just did a hacky sack with it.
4414600	4421720	So it's like, and all of this on the Playstation 4 and Xbox One and this generation of gaming's
4421720	4424640	ultra photorealistic technology.
4424640	4427600	That's why even I'm starting to take after my mother.
4427600	4428600	That's gross.
4428600	4429600	That is so gross.
4429600	4432360	In this day and age of like indie games and being able to make whatever you want, why
4432360	4437120	don't we get like a really, really, really over the top thrill kill type game?
4437120	4441360	Like just so beyond tasteful.
4441360	4445200	Well there's that very controversial.
4445200	4446200	What is it?
4446200	4447200	Hatred is the name of that game?
4447200	4450920	Surely you've heard about this because there's a whole, there's a whole back and forth about
4450920	4451920	the Steam Greenlight.
4451920	4459800	Well, it's back now because that's kind of where, that kind of, it's too much for me.
4459800	4460800	Too much.
4460800	4462000	Too much.
4462000	4468120	But I also think the Saw movies and those type of ultra gore movies don't exactly contribute
4468120	4469880	a lot either and I don't watch them.
4469880	4473520	So I at least apply that logic consistently.
4473520	4480480	Anyway, all right, let's move on and we're going to travel around the world and check
4480480	4481880	out some release dates here in a minute.
4481880	4486480	But first, Dark Sakura has something a little different, but you know, there wasn't a lot
4486480	4487480	of news.
4487480	4488480	So we have different things.
4488480	4491400	Well, you know, I talk about science.
4491400	4492400	There's nothing wrong with science.
4492400	4493400	Yeah.
4493400	4499840	So basically it's not necessarily video game, but it's video game-ish because it's a simulation.
4499840	4505160	They're actually using data from airport x-ray simulations to help with security and
4505160	4507760	cancer screening.
4507760	4513200	Basically for people who use security x-rays over and over again, the machines, they become
4513200	4517600	adept at recognizing certain patterns, what certain contraband looks like.
4517600	4519280	And so it builds up their reaction time.
4519280	4523520	They could spot it in an instant and they're using the same type of simulation to help
4523520	4529080	people recognize certain things a lot faster.
4529080	4535000	Basically they are using the simulations to help them find things that they couldn't
4535000	4538800	otherwise in a lab environment.
4538800	4544960	So now they have it to where they can do all of these different simulations to mimic what
4544960	4547880	would have taken that many trials.
4547880	4553160	So they're actually using the same data to help radiologists read cancer scans, to help
4553160	4555000	with all kinds of other things.
4555000	4559760	But they are working with funding coming from the Homeland Security Solutions and the
4559760	4561480	Army Research Center.
4561480	4566820	So and he's trying to get work with some of the groups that work with TSA.
4566820	4570660	So we could get some benefit out of this, but it's the same reaction time that comes
4570660	4575040	from gaming, you know, simulations.
4575040	4576960	They're basically just focused games.
4576960	4579240	I guess that is true.
4579240	4580240	Yeah.
4580240	4581240	All right.
4581240	4584240	Well, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates, L.O.L.
4584480	4587120	No, I'm going to stay home and eat these cookies.
4587120	4589080	I kind of think this is going to be.
4589080	4590680	But you know, we do the segment every week.
4590680	4591680	So let's see.
4591680	4592680	You never know.
4592680	4593680	There might be some really weird, obscure thing.
4593680	4598000	Didn't we get like Bioshock 2 like the first week of January one year?
4598000	4602280	Like didn't we get Bioshock 2 or one of the Bioshock, yeah, Bioshock 2 I think was like
4602280	4603680	one of the first weeks in January.
4603680	4604680	Yeah.
4604680	4607700	And Final Fantasy 13.2 I think a few years ago was like early January, wasn't it?
4607700	4610960	So sometimes, sometimes you have something here or there, but I don't know.
4610960	4611960	Let's see.
4611960	4613400	Let's check out release dates this week.
4613800	4617040	Um, sadly, there is not, that's not the case this year.
4617040	4621960	There's actually nothing coming out until the end of January as of right now.
4621960	4628200	And the last, the next thing that's coming out actually would be Saints Row, Gat Out
4628200	4632840	of Hell for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and PC.
4632840	4637200	Then they're doing the kind of remastered Saints Row 4 with Gat Out of Hell.
4637200	4639560	That's not coming out though until the end of the month.
4640200	4644960	In the meantime, nothing.
4644960	4647840	Traveling over to Japan, it's really the same story.
4647840	4650200	There's really nothing to report over in Japan.
4650200	4655200	No real releases until we get to at least January 15th and things don't really pick
4655200	4657000	up until January the 22nd.
4657000	4661200	So now's the time to start catching up on your gaming or maybe you're preordering big
4661200	4666880	releases that are coming out in the year in Japan such as Final Fantasy Type 0 HD, which
4666880	4671160	is March 19th, 2015 coming out in Japan.
4671160	4675760	But as far as January goes in this first week, nothing being released in Japan.
4675760	4677160	Dark Sakura, how about the UK?
4677160	4680800	Three whole games, at least that they're telling me of.
4680800	4683320	Warhammer Quest for Mac and for PC.
4683320	4685520	So I guess that's technically one game.
4685520	4689480	And then Captain Toad Treasure Tracker will be out on the 8th.
4689480	4690640	The other one's going to be on the 7th.
4690640	4691640	Oh, that's right.
4691640	4694120	Europe had to wait till this year, but they got a bumped up release.
4694120	4695120	Sorry Europe.
4695120	4696120	Yeah.
4696360	4699080	They had to wait, but at least there's some games that you got well before we did.
4699080	4700080	Yeah.
4700080	4701520	And at least you're getting a game this week.
4701520	4703560	And we bitched about it until we got it.
4703560	4704560	That's right.
4704560	4705560	All right.
4705560	4706560	That's how it works in America.
4706560	4708480	We bitch until we get our way.
4708480	4712620	Just a couple more stories for you guys then our classic game of the week.
4712620	4713960	But first, Loki.
4713960	4714960	Yes.
4714960	4720120	So I don't know if I'm not too sad about this, but I guess if you're looking for a cheaper
4720120	4725680	option for Kinect for Windows, you're going to be out of luck pretty soon.
4725680	4734360	The original Kinect adapter, which came out back in 2013, is going to be phased out.
4734360	4740400	They're going to be actually only having the version 2, the one that would be coming with
4740400	4741400	the Xbox One.
4741400	4746160	Also, the one that's more expensive, that is going to be the one that you're going to
4746160	4747160	be able to buy.
4747160	4751400	Now, however, I don't know how many people actually use Kinect for Windows, aside from
4751400	4754240	maybe people developing stuff for Kinect.
4754240	4757680	But you probably want the new sensor anyways, because the old one wasn't as good.
4757680	4762600	It's just so much more expensive.
4762600	4763600	So yeah.
4763600	4764600	That's that.
4764600	4765600	All right.
4765600	4769840	Well, I don't know how many of you guys are playing the Halo 5 beta.
4769840	4771320	That's another one of my gaming resolutions.
4771320	4774280	By the way, finally get a freaking Xbox One, because I really should have bought one over
4774280	4775360	this holiday season.
4775360	4778400	But for personal reasons, I was unable to.
4778400	4780500	Nothing against Microsoft or the Xbox One.
4780500	4783480	Just had to put my money in other places.
4783480	4787600	But I do want to get an Xbox One over the next year, and one of the games I would likely
4787600	4789560	check out on it is Halo 5.
4789560	4794120	I surprisingly have not been hearing a lot about the beta on Twitter.
4794120	4796000	Maybe I just follow the wrong crowd.
4796000	4799600	I guess I have a lot more Nintendo fans that I know.
4799600	4805200	But I know the Halo 5 Guardians multiplayer beta is going on right now on Xbox One.
4805200	4807240	And they are mixing it up a little bit this week.
4807240	4809600	It started on December 29th.
4809600	4813940	This week, they're going to be adding Breakout, which is round-based, and your Spartan has
4813940	4815840	one life each round.
4815840	4818640	The first team to take five rounds wins the match.
4818640	4824580	And there are two maps that you can play Breakout on called Crossfire and a variant named Trench.
4824580	4828600	There are some new maps coming to the Slayer playlist, Regret and Eden.
4828600	4830400	Regret is a remix of the Truth map.
4830400	4832980	Eden is a remix of the Empire map.
4832980	4835840	Those were both playable in week one.
4835840	4842480	And thanks to a user vote, you can now wield the Hydra MLS, which is a brand new weapon
4842480	4844480	in the Halo universe.
4844480	4845480	So there you go.
4845480	4850040	That is all the updates on what's going on with the Halo 5 Guardians beta, which looks
4850040	4851040	pretty.
4851040	4854040	I need to go look up some YouTubes and live streams and try to see this a little more
4854040	4855040	in action.
4855040	4860360	I just, you know, again, I skipped out on Xbox One, unfortunately, this time around,
4860360	4862480	and just didn't get a chance to check this out.
4862480	4864240	So I don't know.
4864240	4866720	Have you been hearing anything on the Halo 5 beta, Loki?
4866720	4872200	Nope, because I'm a marginal Halo fan and I don't have an Xbox One.
4872200	4877000	Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, ActDeaf says, Sky, you follow me and I'm the
4877000	4878000	right crowd.
4878000	4879000	Where are you playing?
4879000	4883200	Please chatters, you guys can help when we, you know, we don't have time to play everything
4883200	4884620	or money to play everything.
4884620	4888720	So if you guys have played something we haven't, we're dying to know your opinion is the show
4888720	4890060	where every gamer has a voice.
4890060	4898100	So over at live.vognetwork.com, let us know what I might be missing by not checking this
4898100	4899100	out.
4899100	4901420	All right, let's get to the classic game of the week.
4901420	4902420	You know what?
4902420	4903420	Who needs Halo 5?
4903420	4904900	In fact, who needs Halo 1?
4904900	4907420	When you've got classics to play.
4907420	4913220	That's right, it's time for Dark Soccer to step into the gaming vault and find a classic
4913220	4917020	game that she thinks, hey, you should be playing this game this week.
4917020	4919860	Forget all this newfangled technology.
4920540	4922500	This is the time of year where we catch up on games.
4922500	4925540	It's time for you to catch up on games that are 10 years old.
4925540	4929780	I had to check five times to see if I've done this game before.
4929780	4932020	I was shocked that you have never done this game before.
4932020	4934300	I've been shocking myself lately.
4934300	4935460	Shocked.
4935460	4937700	This is really a duh this week, people.
4937700	4938700	But I'm all right.
4938700	4940620	We have to start with the music, though, for the first one.
4940620	4944740	Well, it is a game that people need to frickin' check out if they haven't already.
4944740	4949700	It's one of the best music games ever and really, a little bit more.
4949700	4956340	Do you guys hear this Eurobeat?
4956340	4959140	This very specialized Eurobeat.
4959140	4961220	The game is Guitar Man.
4961220	4968500	Guitar Man is a music game that was done by, I'm going to mispronounce this, but it's Enis,
4968500	4973100	I-N-I-S, and it was published by Koei for the PS2.
4973100	4974100	Enis!
4974100	4975100	Enis!
4975100	4981180	Excuse me, I had to burp off the mic.
4981180	4982860	All the Enis talk made you burp.
4982860	4989380	Oh, Enis, it makes my gastrointestinal tract just inflamed for the Enis.
4989380	4994660	Anyway, the game has actually, the artwork is done actually by one of my favorite commercial
4994660	5001620	artists, Mitsuru Nakamura, and the music was done by a band called Coil, of course, Japanese
5001620	5002620	band.
5002620	5008140	It came out on June 21st, 2001 in North America, I'm sorry, in Japan, and in North America
5008140	5013500	on February 18th, 2002 in Europe it came out June 21st, 2002.
5013500	5018980	It's had a port that came out on PSP called Guitar Man Lives, and in Japan it was Guitar
5018980	5023460	Man Live, which I think is a better name, but that came out in 2006.
5023460	5025740	So what the hell kind of game is this, huh?
5025740	5030980	Well you play as a character named Yuwan, which actually his name made so much more
5030980	5036300	sense in the Japanese version, it was Yuichi, which that actually, it's the same thing,
5036300	5038100	it just sounds like it makes more sense.
5038100	5046060	Anyway, he's kind of bullied on, and the girl he likes doesn't like him, so basically his
5046060	5048060	dog teaches him how to play guitar.
5048060	5050820	His dog's name is Puma.
5050820	5053900	And he eventually becomes the Guitar Man.
5053900	5060780	He inherits the last Gitaroo, and so he has to fight these huge creatures that also control
5060780	5062900	Gitaroos.
5062900	5069300	You have different kind of bars that move around for a center location, and so you move
5069300	5074140	the analog controller in conjunction with these bars you have to go, and you tap certain
5074140	5075860	buttons at certain times.
5075860	5081700	You've got five different phases, and you've got a life bar.
5081700	5085620	So the better you do, the more you take off of the other person.
5085620	5088580	The worse that you do, the more life you lose.
5088580	5095900	So you've technically got, the three main phases are charge, attack, and guard, where
5095900	5101300	you have to follow a trace line with the analog stick, and then you have red phase bars so
5101300	5105860	that you can press buttons at the end of the phases, so that you time it when it hits the
5105860	5106860	screen.
5106860	5107860	Basically it's all rhythm.
5107860	5113100	In charge you get notes that restore your health, and in attack that's when you actually
5113100	5115340	start attacking the other guys.
5115340	5122540	You also have the harmony and the end phase, and really, it's hard to really describe the
5122540	5124140	game as something that you'll just have to see.
5124140	5125580	Can I play the other song though?
5125580	5126580	Yes please.
5126580	5128300	Oh, I put up the Sandbone Trio I think.
5128300	5130300	Yes, that is the other song that we're going to hear.
5130300	5131780	The Sandbone Trio is like my second favorite song.
5131780	5132780	The Born To Be Bone song.
5132780	5133780	Turn it up a touch.
5133780	5134780	Such a good song.
5134780	5143500	The soundtrack for this game is a maze, anyway.
5143500	5146220	And by the way, AkumaJP in chat says it's pronounced Ani-Sue.
5146220	5147220	Ani-Sue?
5147220	5148220	Mm-hmm.
5148220	5149220	Okay.
5149220	5150220	Thank you.
5150220	5151220	I still like anus!
5151220	5152220	You would.
5152220	5155260	Shut up, what do you try to say?
5155260	5156260	Anyway...
5156260	5157260	Is that a gay joke?
5157260	5159180	No, maybe you just have...
5159180	5161180	You could be a proctologist, Rob.
5161180	5163460	One day, Rob, you could be a proctologist.
5163460	5164460	Classic game.
5164460	5165460	Talk about it.
5165460	5169140	And there's also Master's Mode once you've beaten the game once, where it's a lot harder,
5169140	5173180	you have a lot more complex notes, the trace line becomes more difficult, and you take
5173180	5176820	more damage from mistakes, then you get Versus Mode that you can play up to four player,
5176820	5182260	where you play each other in two teams doing the guitaros parts and the opponents parts.
5182260	5190020	The PSP version has Duet Mode, where you can play cooperatively via the ad hoc in two new
5190020	5194500	levels where you get Metal Header and Tota Passion.
5194500	5199700	So the characters in the game, like I said, you have Yuwan or Yuichi, who is the guitar
5199700	5200700	man.
5200700	5208180	You have Puma, who turns into something called Puma AC30, and he's like a big kind of weird
5208180	5209660	patchwork robot dog.
5209660	5218380	You have Pico, who's the girl that Yuwan wants, and Kazuo, who's the guy who likes to take
5218380	5219380	Pico away.
5219380	5228220	Then you've got all the bad guys, so the main bad guy is Zoe, who is trying to take over
5228220	5231420	the universe through capturing all the guitaros.
5231420	5236100	You've got your bad guys, like the one that the music we played last was The Flying O,
5236100	5240860	which is a giant UFO that makes everyone para-para into death.
5240860	5246500	This one is the sand bone trio, so there are three skeletons named Carrot, Pine, and Soda
5246500	5251620	that play their own ribs for the musical instruments, you know, all kinds of different ones.
5251620	5252700	That ain't weird or anything.
5252700	5255700	And you have your backup band, who show up randomly in different levels.
5256260	5260700	So you get Norin, who wears a rabbit suit, Yung, who wears a monkey suit, and Yasuda
5260700	5264420	Sun, who wears a panda suit.
5264420	5270380	The soundtrack, the CD came out in 2001, has the majority of the songs in it, and it's
5270380	5272900	missing most of the background music, though.
5272900	5279060	But it does have some of the Master Mode versions, it has also the remixes of some of the songs.
5279060	5284300	As far as other versions, there was one called Guitar Man 1, that was a trial release of
5284300	5291020	the game, but it also had a demo of the para-para stage, and cinematic scenes that were only
5291020	5295260	exclusive to that version, and a game where you could play Puma trying to eat donuts falling
5295260	5297780	from the sky.
5297780	5301500	Then of course there was Guitar Man Live, or in Japan it was Guitar Man Live, that was
5301500	5302500	the PSP version.
5302500	5308900	It had extra goodies, and that came out in Japan on June 8th, 2006, Europe September
5308900	5312980	26th, 2006, and in North America November 14th, 2006.
5312980	5314980	So that's the one we actually got after Europe.
5314980	5319100	See Europe, you get some before us, but we bitch until we get it.
5319100	5320100	And that's it.
5320100	5325180	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, a true classic for music game fans,
5325180	5327060	which we all are here at OLR.
5327060	5328060	I suck at it.
5328060	5331420	Guitar Man, there you go.
5331420	5336580	Then you would probably not like Hatsune Miku, which to me plays very similar.
5336580	5339620	Like obviously they have their differences, but I do feel like it's probably the most
5339620	5342540	similar thing to Guitar Man that's out there, is Hatsune Miku.
5342540	5344020	I don't know if you'd care for that.
5344020	5347500	I love Hatsune Miku though, that game's a lot of fun, I need to get the new one that
5347500	5348900	just came out.
5348900	5350820	But anyway, we're gonna take a break.
5350820	5356340	We got more OLR coming up, including our 2015 predictions, that's right, listless returns
5356340	5360280	tonight, and you guys will help us come up with a definitive list in our chatroom over
5360280	5368000	at live.vognetwork.com, but we will do all that and some more news, scraping what little
5368000	5372840	pieces of news there are together, and your calls, most importantly, in the mailbag, when
5372840	5382640	we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.
5382640	5387160	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening, January the 4th
5387160	5394640	of 2015, with episode number 582 of our show, In Progress, and we've been talking a little
5394640	5397360	bit about what little gaming news there is this week.
5397360	5402880	We talked about the Sony PlayStation hack apology thing earlier, and the piracy being
5402880	5406980	combated in Talos Principle, we talked a little bit about that earlier, talked a little bit
5406980	5410000	about an update on the VoG jam, they were talking about that in the chatroom during
5410000	5414240	the break, and Loki actually working on his game during the show, and you said you fixed
5414240	5415240	the bug.
5415240	5418760	Yeah I fixed it, I had to copy paste everything from the project that I was working on into
5418760	5420080	a new project, then it fixed it.
5420080	5421360	That's so weird that that would do it.
5421360	5422360	And what was the problem you were having?
5422360	5423360	You were having some textures?
5423360	5429800	It seems in between, my maps are a bunch of 3D objects right now, and I may just fuse
5429800	5434640	them all together later, but right now it's a bunch of 3D objects, and so in between the
5434640	5439840	seams were showing, and it wasn't doing that before as my screenshot, and they're still
5439840	5448120	kind of showing, but it's way less noticeable now, it's very, I can deal with that much
5448120	5455320	showing, that's fine, but before it was just like really horrible from far away.
5455320	5458160	Good on you though, troubleshooting while we're trying to do a show, that's great, love
5458160	5459160	it.
5459160	5460160	Thanks for the break.
5460160	5465880	We also derailed into movie chat, which by the way, we derailed into talking about Winona
5465880	5475120	Ryder and how underrated she is, I know right, but this reminded me of a Twitter thing that
5475120	5479560	had come up earlier, and I was talking on Twitter, and it was Tiger Claw or somebody
5479560	5484760	had brought it up talking about, it is the year 2015, and a lot of people are talking
5484760	5489760	about, oh it's the year of Back to the Future 2, and you talk about Slow News Week, you
5489760	5493840	have a lot of these websites like Buzzfeed and so forth are having to live on the, here's
5493840	5498560	20 things that Back to the Future 2 got wrong about the year 2015 and all this stuff.
5498560	5500680	It just started, there's still time.
5500680	5504880	There's still time for hoverboards and auto-tying shoelaces right, but here's the funny thing
5504880	5507180	about that, I was like, oh I have a really funny story about that, you know what that
5507180	5508180	story is?
5508180	5511920	I've never seen Back to the Future Part 2, yep, that's my funny story, I've never seen
5511920	5512920	Back to the Future Part 2.
5512920	5514720	You're not missing anything, it was really awful.
5514720	5520300	Now here's the weird thing, here's what makes that story weird, I've seen Part 1, and I've
5520300	5524240	seen Part 3, I've never seen Part 2.
5524240	5528600	I was like that well into adulthood, I didn't see the second one until I moved out here.
5528600	5529600	Oh interesting.
5529600	5530600	Yep.
5530600	5531880	Yeah no, I never got around to seeing the second one.
5531880	5536740	I remember we saw the third one, like one of those like rainy day or substitute teacher
5536740	5537740	type of things.
5537740	5541560	Like you remember when they would just show you a movie in class, even though you're supposed
5541560	5544600	to be learning, they show you a movie because clearly something's going on behind the scenes
5544600	5545600	you're not supposed to know about.
5545600	5546600	Oh no.
5546600	5547600	So it's like, just shut them up, we're just gonna show a movie.
5547600	5551040	We wouldn't get a movie, we would get The Reel to Reel by Seba Gygi.
5551040	5552840	What is that?
5552840	5558120	It was, it's a research facility, they used to put out educational films, and so we had
5558120	5562600	the, they'd bring out the projector and make us watch science stuff.
5562600	5566960	That, okay, we had something like that in our physics class.
5566960	5570920	We had that all the way through elementary school and then in middle school.
5570920	5574880	My physics teacher in high school was a crazy bastard, but I mean that in the best possible
5574880	5575880	way.
5575880	5576880	He was, he was so awesome.
5576880	5579560	He wore a Star Trek uniform to work every single day.
5579560	5580760	That's what kind of a badass he was.
5580760	5581760	Okay that's cool.
5581760	5585560	And during recess he always played music that he would blast on these loudspeakers, it was
5585560	5592440	like this big orchestral type epic thing, and it was always timed precisely to end right
5592440	5593760	when the bell would ring.
5593760	5599560	Like the music would go, doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo, and then the bell, brrrr.
5599560	5602200	Like he, like you, he made a science out of this.
5602200	5605560	And the greatest thing about him, like this guy, you know, I'm a, I'm a teacher of sorts
5605560	5608800	now and I gotta say this guy is an inspiration in certain ways.
5608800	5612640	I mean even though I just called him a crazy bastard, again I say that with the utmost
5612640	5616920	respect of this that I take after that a little bit.
5616920	5623440	But um, oh my god, this guy, he used to deliver jokes in the most deadpan way ever.
5623440	5625680	Like he was a teacher on Strangers with Candy.
5625680	5628460	He was like Mr. Noblitt or something like that, I swear to god.
5628460	5629460	So that guy was amazing.
5629460	5635240	Going to the chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, Tigerclaw saying, Sky, you must see Back to
5635240	5636560	the Future Part II.
5636560	5638780	PushyPixels saying, Rob, seriously?
5638780	5639780	You need to see it.
5639780	5642480	Fifth Dream saying, I saw it in the theater.
5642520	5647520	Alright, look, I'll try, you know, why don't we do a Dark Soccer and Rob Let's React to
5647520	5651000	Back to the Future Part II YouTube.
5651000	5652000	I'll tell you what.
5652000	5653840	But hey, Michael J. Fox in drag.
5653840	5655800	I've got the whole trilogy on Blu-ray.
5655800	5657280	I'll bring it next week, yes.
5657280	5658280	Nice.
5658280	5659280	Alright.
5659280	5660280	I've got it too.
5660280	5661280	I mean, you know who I married.
5661280	5662280	Hey, I don't have it.
5662280	5664280	So some of you need to just bring it over.
5664280	5667600	That reminds me, I just need to watch Tron again.
5667600	5672060	But I have all the Star Trek Next Generation movies on Blu-ray thanks to my high school
5672060	5673060	physics teacher.
5673060	5674060	Alright.
5674060	5675060	Not really.
5675060	5677060	But I did watch a lot of Next Generation in high school.
5677060	5682060	Anyway, we had a lot, we had to watch a lot of rapid fire news go by before we get to
5682060	5685020	our 2015 predictions list list tonight.
5685020	5686780	Let's get into some rapid fire news.
5686780	5688380	Loki, the Dark Sakura.
5688380	5692140	I would like to derail this real quick since you just mentioned Star Trek The Next Generation.
5692140	5693140	Oh sure.
5693140	5698660	I just thought I would pitch a game idea real quick because I think it's hilarious.
5698660	5701340	And since I'm not going to be able to work on something like that.
5701340	5705900	But you know, I know they've had like, you know, red shirts type of game where, you know,
5705900	5709220	you're basically playing kind of as the crew members that are expendable.
5709220	5715180	But imagine if you will, kind of combining the Star Trek Next Generation with say, it
5715180	5716180	wasn't Six Feet Under.
5716180	5720020	What was that one where she was the Grim Reaper?
5720020	5721020	Yep.
5721020	5722060	Whatever that one is.
5722060	5726780	But basically where the object of the game is you have to kill those people on their
5726780	5730140	away missions using like the environment or something like that.
5730140	5734900	Like you are, you know, the Grim Reaper that has to kill the red shirts on their way.
5734900	5738540	I think it would be an interesting game where you play, well, maybe, and maybe you're saying
5738540	5741980	this is what's already been done, where you play as the red shirt, but you're having to
5741980	5746340	deal with like, you don't want to go into these situations, but you have to, and you
5746340	5750500	have a completely incompetent boss who keeps sending you into these death missions and
5750500	5751820	death traps.
5751820	5755140	And maybe at the end of the game, you find like out like some like weird twists.
5755140	5757940	Like the boss has been out to like purposely kill you the whole time.
5757940	5759900	Cause there's something, I don't know, involving your family.
5759900	5765900	Like a game called, I wear a red shirt, Zach Brannigan, anyway, I like those ideas.
5765900	5766900	Those are good ideas.
5766900	5767900	Those are good.
5767900	5768900	All right.
5768900	5769900	How about some rapid fire news though?
5769900	5771140	Back to games that actually exist.
5771140	5772140	Okay.
5772140	5778380	So there's a rumor that apparently the data for a duck hunt amiibo is on the Smash Brothers
5778380	5779380	disc.
5779380	5784020	And I guess there is some video that came out kind of showing, um, that they hacked,
5784020	5787660	I don't know if they hacked, you know, the near field communication or did something
5787660	5794580	to where it tricked it, allegedly to believe that there was a amiibo that, you know, doesn't
5794580	5795980	exist yet.
5795980	5802360	And apparently a menu came up, um, showing like the duck hunt figures.
5802360	5807620	I don't know if that's true or not, but, um, I could see them putting out an amiibo and
5807620	5811980	I could definitely see that the game would support, um, characters that aren't out yet.
5811980	5815940	I mean, I know they did the same thing with like, was it Disney infinity and stuff supporting
5815940	5817420	characters that weren't out yet.
5817420	5818940	Um, but they were planned.
5818940	5824660	So I can see that I'm pretty sure Nintendo has an amiibo plan for every single character
5824660	5825740	in Smash Brothers.
5825740	5828340	I'm pretty sure that's the thing that's going to happen.
5828340	5832700	So but, um, except maybe Pac-Man because of the licensing issues.
5832700	5835980	But then again, if they got mega man and Sonic, I don't see why they won't have a Pac-Man
5835980	5836980	amiibo.
5836980	5837980	I'm sure they would.
5837980	5838980	Yeah, they could.
5838980	5842260	Um, so I don't know, I guess we'll have to wait and see.
5842260	5845360	I'm sure that, you know, that'll be another one of those intended directs where they announced
5845360	5846360	more amiibo figures.
5846600	5847600	Hooray!
5847600	5848600	Hooray!
5848600	5850080	Um, this is kind of cool.
5850080	5855720	There's going to be some idea factory RPGs now coming to PC.
5855720	5861580	And with this, they're going to have Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth 1 and Hyperdimension Neptunia
5861580	5867760	Rebirth 2, which were both originally out at least over here on the Vita.
5867760	5872820	And then, um, Fairy Fencer F, which was a PlayStation 3 title that's coming out over
5872820	5875320	here as well on Steam.
5875320	5881360	So, um, no exact date when those are going to be available, but they should be coming
5881360	5882360	soon.
5882360	5885260	So, um, I'll have to wait and see for those.
5885260	5890320	And then last but not least, there is a code that's been released for Pokemon Omega Ruby
5890320	5896200	and Alpha Sapphire, uh, for, uh, Super- was it Superior?
5896200	5904200	Um, it's, I guess, an unlocked code that was on the last Pokemon Get TV.
5904240	5910960	And the code, I guess, is redeemable after January 29th and available for use up through
5910960	5914160	November 30th, 2015.
5914160	5919920	And I guess the code is just Pokemon 497 and it'll unlock, I guess, a character?
5919920	5921320	I don't know.
5921320	5925720	I think Superior or whatever, Superior is the Pokemon.
5925720	5926720	I think is the deal.
5926720	5928000	So they're saying-
5928000	5929000	I don't know.
5929000	5933180	When even Shane is on this show saying it was, uh, really not a good Pokemon game, that
5933180	5937060	really makes me go, well, I have concerns, but then again, we had a caller call in and
5937060	5938060	say, no, he's wrong.
5938060	5939180	It's the best game of the year.
5939180	5943140	So I suppose there's, uh, two sides to all that.
5943140	5944140	So I don't know.
5944140	5945140	Cool.
5945140	5946140	I guess.
5946140	5947140	I'm not a Pokemon fan.
5947140	5949180	So yeah, that means little to me.
5949180	5950180	All right.
5950180	5951180	Uh, DarkStalker.
5951180	5952180	How about you?
5952180	5954180	I'm busy cooking.
5954180	5956100	Those cookies you brought are so good.
5956100	5957100	Curse you.
5957100	5958500	No, bless me.
5958500	5959500	Delicious cookies.
5960060	5965220	Um, so there is a, um, an extension to my Nintendo.
5965220	5970380	Now this isn't an extension for the Digital Deluxe promotion, but you can redeem your
5970380	5974220	vouchers for it through April.
5974220	5976820	Basically the program's being extended through April 1st.
5976820	5982620	Um, but the actual ability to purchase it ended at the end of the year.
5982620	5984820	So that's a correction on that one.
5984820	5987700	In other news, Mighty Eat Number 9 is almost finished.
5987700	5992260	And we had a message that came out from, uh, Inohune that said, happy new year, we're
5992260	5994320	almost done.
5994320	5997420	So get ready.
5997420	6002380	And last but not least, um, there's another character in Tekken 7 who is not as controversial
6002380	6004060	as Lucky Chloe.
6004060	6008580	Um, his name is, uh, Shaheen.
6008580	6016460	He is a Saudi Arabian soldier and, um, he actually was created based on feedback, um,
6016460	6022300	from, uh, the game designer asking, what do you most want to see in the next Tekken game?
6022300	6025860	And a lot of people said they wanted a Middle Eastern character.
6025860	6030580	And I have to say, you know, he's got some of the stereotypical stuff on him, but he's,
6030580	6034300	uh, actually pretty handsome, has a sword, looking pretty hardcore.
6034300	6038380	I would, you know, honestly, it's not a fighting game unless you have a bunch of people that
6038380	6040780	fill the tropes of different characters.
6040780	6042380	I mean, who cares?
6042380	6043380	It's a fighting game.
6043380	6044380	Who stereotypes the game?
6044700	6049340	You know, you're not, we can't talk realism about, you know, a game that has a fighting
6049340	6055020	bear in it or a game that has, you know, a wooden robot thing that you fight.
6055020	6056020	I mean, it's just, come on.
6056020	6062860	If Street Fighter can have a Turkish oil wrestler, then I think having a rather subdued and well-dressed
6062860	6066900	stylish Saudi man is perfectly fine for Tekken 7.
6066900	6067900	Absolutely.
6067900	6072900	I think if you can have a Turkish oil wrestler, then you can have Lucky Chloe.
6072900	6073900	Why not?
6074620	6076180	I didn't have a problem with Lucky Chloe.
6076180	6080540	I don't, I don't know why people, people, people just want to get mad to get mad.
6080540	6082660	Like sometimes I think that's the purpose of Twitter.
6082660	6083660	And don't get me wrong.
6083660	6085540	Like I've had a lot of very positive interactions on Twitter.
6085540	6089420	I met a lot of great people on Twitter, but sometimes I think like people just have Twitters.
6089420	6091020	They can complain about something.
6091020	6094300	And it's like, if there was nothing else going on in the world, it's just, I need to complain
6094300	6096180	about something on fricking Twitter.
6096180	6097180	And it's so easy.
6097180	6098180	I'm on the internet.
6098180	6099180	Yeah.
6099180	6100180	I have to say something about this.
6100180	6101180	I'm on the internet.
6101180	6102180	Fuck you all.
6102180	6103180	Oh my God.
6103180	6104180	Listen to me be wrong.
6104180	6105180	I don't care.
6105180	6106180	Just listen.
6106180	6108340	And it's so easy to tag people.
6108340	6112940	Like it is so easy to tag like, you know, at Lady Gaga, you're fat.
6112940	6113940	I hate you.
6113940	6115940	And it's like, but she can like actually, I don't know.
6115940	6118860	Why do you think I hardly spend any time on Twitter anymore?
6118860	6122420	I'd rather be on Tumblr and just repost whole blogs and make fun of them.
6122420	6124100	So you have my whole issue with Tumblr too.
6124100	6128540	Lately Tumblr has just been Dragon Age romance, the blog.
6128540	6129540	Yeah.
6129540	6130940	All right.
6130940	6133580	Let's get to the foogle question of the week.
6133580	6144940	You take Facebook, you take Google Plus, you slam them together, you get foogle.
6144940	6150140	Every week we ask our listeners that support us on social networks a question every week,
6150140	6154860	which by the way, you may start to see us using social networking more outside of just
6154860	6155860	Sunday.
6155860	6159180	Um, you may have noticed a little experiment where I actually snuck a question in earlier
6159180	6161220	in the week that I used in the intro of the show.
6161220	6165300	Um, that might be a direction we start kind of going in more and more throughout the year.
6165300	6166940	It's just something I'm experimenting with a little bit.
6166940	6169260	So, uh, don't just follow us on Sunday.
6169260	6172340	Keep an eye out because you might see more questions throughout the week as there's more
6172340	6173340	gaming news.
6173340	6175900	Like I would like to do something every day, but there's really just not been the news
6175900	6176900	to necessitate it.
6176900	6180620	But we'll be asking you guys about the big stories more frequently so we can get your
6180620	6184660	comments on the show more frequently than just the section.
6184660	6188540	But all that aside, we did ask in our official foogle question of the week this week, tonight
6188540	6191140	we are making our 2015 predictions.
6191140	6194140	So what are your 2015 gaming predictions?
6194140	6195700	Maybe we'll use some of these on this list.
6195700	6196700	Let's see.
6196700	6200300	I read the Hayes says 2015 will be a great year with all the upcoming games.
6200300	6204820	I predict more remakes and revivals, which is great because I missed out on stuff last
6204820	6205820	gen.
6205820	6210460	I also want old franchises with great ideas to come back, such as the spiritual revival
6210460	6211940	of clock tower.
6211940	6215780	Well, the good news for you is that, uh, that's a pretty safe bet.
6215780	6220140	There's definitely going to be some more, uh, uh, remakes and revivals.
6220140	6222540	I just hope final fantasy 12 is one of them.
6222540	6223540	All right.
6223540	6227300	Uh, rageinator says, this is a bit of a cop out answer, but I predict that I'll buy a
6227300	6229460	shit ton of steam games.
6229460	6232620	Also one of the safest predictions I've ever heard, but that's all right.
6232620	6237800	I also like how often people use the word shit ton.
6237800	6241060	As in a shit ton of smiling piles of poopy mote icons.
6241060	6243820	Uh, Andy R says half life three will release.
6243820	6244820	Haha.
6244860	6250140	By the way, uh, Guillermo R says valve will quietly cancel steam machines.
6250140	6251140	Ooh.
6251140	6255660	Nintendo will announce a 2d Metroid co-developed by chair entertainment, as well as a Wemo
6255660	6258220	enabled port of the infinity blade trilogy.
6258220	6262780	Oh God, I think that's a real wild stab of the dark, but I hope you're fucking right.
6262780	6263780	I really do.
6263780	6264780	That would be amazing.
6264780	6267460	Uh, Sony will stay quiet about the last guardian.
6267460	6268460	That's a little more safe.
6268460	6274700	Oculus rift will finally come out and no man's sky will be awesome in it.
6274700	6278140	And fifth dream on Facebook says virtual reality will finally begin making its way into the
6278140	6281380	mainstream near the end of the year and beginning of the next soon.
6281380	6286740	It won't be a joke or thought of as a fad anymore and just become the way a lot of people
6286740	6287740	game.
6287740	6291540	As a by-product, there will be a reboot of the lawnmower movies, lawnmower man movie
6291540	6293180	series in 2017.
6293180	6294180	Okay.
6294180	6295180	Maybe not.
6295180	6296180	I hope so.
6296180	6297340	No, I'm both of those.
6297340	6298340	Yeah.
6299220	6303660	I'm totally fine with the first part of the lawnmower man sequel was God damn terrible
6303660	6304660	though.
6304660	6305660	I mean, don't get me wrong.
6305660	6311300	The lawnmower man, you know, his adventures through the mind's eye videos, um, was fantastic,
6311300	6316860	but yeah, I could totally see a reboot of that make crazy and creepy.
6316860	6322260	Uh, I'm, I am so curious to see what happens when things like Oculus rift and uh, you know,
6322260	6325780	project Morpheus, whatever it ends up actually being called, you know, all these things come
6325780	6326780	out.
6326780	6327780	I'm, I'm very curious to see what happens.
6328220	6329220	All right.
6329220	6334020	Uh, act deft, uh, over on Google plus says, Loki's game gets finished.
6334020	6335020	Seriously speaking though.
6335020	6338340	I expect a major gaming company to go under this year.
6338340	6340500	Sad, but maybe true.
6340500	6345780	I'm sure there's at least two, like I, I imagine the sun will come out tomorrow.
6345780	6350140	I think there's two big Japanese ones we're all looking at, but maybe we'll get into that
6350140	6352500	in our official predictions here in a minute.
6352540	6358140	Uh, redertainment says, and the answer is the Witcher three gets delayed again, pushing
6358140	6359540	back the release to holiday.
6359540	6364020	Ooh, that would be, uh, that would be pretty, uh, interesting if that happened, uh, price
6364020	6370020	cut on the Wii U in time for holiday, no price cut on PS4 or Xbox one.
6370020	6377620	I, I, did they really make good on the threat to up the price of Xbox one $50 again?
6377620	6381620	Like did the price of Xbox one go back up by 50 bucks?
6381620	6385140	I think that was, I don't, I don't think that was a smart decision on Microsoft's part,
6385140	6387380	but anyway, maybe it, maybe it'll just be, I think it did.
6387380	6389980	I can confirm.
6389980	6394740	I think if, if they did make that $50 price drop permanent, which I can't believe they
6394740	6398460	didn't, then Sony would be under a lot of pressure to match it.
6398460	6399740	Um, but we'll see.
6399740	6400740	I don't know.
6400740	6401740	We'll see.
6401740	6403220	Uh, it's, it's a, it's a fair prediction.
6403220	6406940	And then, uh, redertainment says the last guardian is teased at E3, no release date
6406940	6410980	or full trailer, just a short video with ominous music behind it.
6411020	6415020	Mirrors Edge 2 gets a release date sometime in 2016.
6415020	6417020	All right.
6417020	6420340	Um, let's see, uh, there you go.
6420340	6424140	Those are some of the answers from our Facebook and Google plus communities.
6424140	6428780	We are really close to our list lists for tonight, but first we have a couple more stories
6428780	6429780	for you guys.
6429780	6430780	Loki.
6430780	6431780	Yeah.
6431780	6437960	It's still saying that $399.99 are, um, so I don't remember which bundle that was, but
6437960	6440720	it doesn't look like that they've dropped it down.
6440720	6441720	Eh, whatever.
6441720	6442720	Okay.
6442720	6444720	Uh, so let's see.
6444720	6450240	So let's talk a little bit about, um, well, the Xbox one actually, ironically enough,
6450240	6454220	that, um, and this is something that they've been working on for a while, especially after
6454220	6459480	they decided, hey, you know what, we're not going to make the Kinect as, um, something
6459480	6461440	that you need to have in the system.
6461440	6468720	And because of that, um, they were freeing up the extra, um, CPU power that was, I guess,
6468720	6469720	for that.
6469720	6475840	So I can't remember how much they were saying, um, they're saying right now they've allowed
6475840	6481520	developers access to 50 to 80% of the seventh processing core.
6481520	6488600	And I'm seeing that this should increase the performance of, uh, titles compared to their
6488640	6489640	PlayStation four counterparts.
6489640	6493960	Because you may remember there's been quite a disparaging, uh, difference between some
6493960	6498460	of these, you know, titles on Xbox one, not running as high of a resolution as the ones
6498460	6502520	on PlayStation four or lower frame rate or something to that effect.
6502520	6506960	I mean, if that's a big deal for you, then I don't know.
6506960	6509240	I guess this is cool that they're going to have the extra stuff.
6509240	6514720	And then also, um, I know at some point they're supposed to be adopting, was it a DirectX
6514720	6521680	12, was that, I think, I don't know, that's supposed to be pushing, uh, visuals up as
6521680	6522680	well.
6522680	6527520	And, um, so let's allow them to do a little bit more with the system and also on PC.
6527520	6528520	All right.
6528520	6532380	Well, uh, you know, we were talking a minute ago about the Wii U and the types of things
6532380	6537180	we might see this year, but, uh, it looks like Mario, a 3d Mario title will not be among
6537180	6539240	the offerings on the Wii U this year.
6539240	6544480	Uh, this was confirmed by Nintendo of America's Bill Trennan, who said in an interview and
6544480	6547640	the interview was, whoa, the interview, sorry, my keyboard tray just broke.
6547640	6548640	That was scary.
6548640	6552680	Uh, uh, he said in this interview that the, uh, company does not have a sequel to super
6552680	6555000	Mario 3d world plan for release this year.
6555000	6559880	So that's not going to be on the 3ds or the Wii U, uh, but of course there is Mario maker
6559880	6565560	coming on the Wii, uh, Wii U, excuse me, and Mario party 10, uh, the exact quote, Mario
6565560	6568440	games release more frequently, but we don't have a new Mario game this year.
6568440	6569920	So it's not an annual event.
6569920	6573680	The teams focus on how they can recreate the gameplay experience or introduce new ideas
6573680	6577240	to those games, which is what they did with NES remix, for example.
6577240	6578240	So there you go.
6578240	6581760	And you know, with the Zelda game coming out this year, I think that's where the focus
6581760	6582760	is.
6582760	6586120	So I'm not too shocked to hear there's not a mainline Mario game coming out.
6586120	6591200	However, what I want to know is, does this also rule out Mario galaxy?
6591200	6595880	Because I would think that that is the series that really needs another game.
6595880	6601000	And I think that a lot of people want to see on Wii U or is that the 2016 plan?
6601000	6603360	I don't know, but I would think a Mario galaxy game would be a good one.
6603360	6606960	I don't think they're going to have another Mario game next year, just because they've
6606960	6609120	got a Zelda game coming out of the beach.
6609120	6610600	I think that they would be kind of...
6610600	6612240	But that would also be a power Christmas.
6612240	6615040	Yeah, it would be, but then what do you bring for next year?
6615040	6616040	That's the problem.
6616040	6620080	It's like, so they got to space it out so that they have one, you know, core franchise
6620080	6624720	title that, you know, it's a Mario or Zelda title that's really going to bring in, you
6624720	6628640	know, people interests in the console that may not have the console already.
6628640	6633680	So I don't think, I mean, cause honestly, like, you know, when they were pitching Pikmin
6633680	6636520	three or whatever, it's just not a system seller.
6636520	6640240	Some people like that game, but it's not something like, Oh my God, I got to get a Wii U for
6640240	6641240	that.
6641240	6642240	You know, I don't know.
6642240	6646520	I just think that we'll have to see what else that they have beyond Zelda.
6646520	6648240	Star Fox is definitely a positive.
6648240	6649240	So I mean, that'll help.
6649240	6650240	Yeah.
6650240	6651240	We're not hearing a lot about that.
6651240	6655880	I think I would be willing to, I could see Star Fox being delayed to next year, but I
6655880	6656880	don't know.
6656880	6657880	We'll see.
6658120	6659720	I think they're going to have to have some spring titles.
6659720	6662400	I mean, there's Mario maker and I would hope Star Fox is in there too.
6662400	6665360	Maybe there'll be a direct or something that gives more information.
6665360	6669360	Maybe Star Fox is like that summer title, like the June type of release.
6669360	6670360	At least I hope so.
6670360	6671360	I hope so.
6671360	6675040	I think there's a lot of us that are really, uh, you know, we're, we're hoping for Nintendo
6675040	6679120	and you know, they had a really good year this year and, um, you know, if they can keep
6679120	6683980	that inertia going in the face of increasing competition from the Sony and Microsoft exclusives
6683980	6687600	that start dropping next year, cause there's going to be some big ones between, you know,
6687600	6691440	Halo five is obviously going to be Microsoft's big thing next year.
6691440	6695000	Uh, Sony's got uncharted four and you know, these other things that they were pitching
6695000	6696440	at their own conference.
6696440	6702640	Um, I, I, uh, I, I, I really cheering for Nintendo and I hope they can, uh, hope they
6702640	6703640	can pull through.
6703640	6704640	All right.
6704640	6709800	Well, we're making a lot of bold predictions right now, so let's make some more in a segment
6709800	6711600	we call listless.
6711600	6718440	I hope y'all know this game by now cause we just played it two weeks ago to do the
6718440	6722080	VOG jam theme, but here's the way listless works.
6722080	6727720	We are going to create a list with our hosts here in studio and joining us tonight for
6727720	6729040	the 2015 predictions.
6729040	6734000	You guys really got a kick out of his predictions last year, so he is back joining us a special
6734000	6735000	tonight.
6735000	6736000	Say hello to Alan.
6736000	6737000	Hello.
6737000	6738000	Hi Alan.
6738000	6739000	How are you?
6739000	6740000	I'm good.
6740000	6741000	How's dragon age going?
6741400	6742400	Good.
6742400	6743400	Can you chat?
6743400	6744400	Hear me okay?
6744400	6745400	All right.
6745400	6751560	Um, I'm, I just started the legacy DLC for dragon age two, which for inquisition is very
6751560	6752560	important.
6752560	6753560	Oh, okay.
6753560	6754560	No spoilers.
6754560	6755560	OMG spoilers.
6755560	6756560	Okay.
6756560	6757560	OMG.
6757560	6759920	Uh, what, anything else of gaming that you want to point out that you've been up to lately?
6759920	6762480	Diablo three forever.
6762480	6764680	You broke paragon 120 now, right?
6764680	6770240	130 and I'm doing torment five, but not very well.
6770240	6771240	It's a struggle.
6771240	6772240	It's a struggle.
6772240	6773240	It's a struggle.
6773240	6774240	The struggle is real.
6774240	6775240	Uh, what else?
6775240	6777960	Any, any used to cohost a podcast and all that fun, so you're not doing anything like
6777960	6778960	that right now.
6778960	6779960	No projects for people to follow.
6779960	6780960	No.
6780960	6781960	Just your sassy tweets.
6781960	6782960	Yes.
6782960	6783960	All right.
6783960	6784960	That works.
6784960	6785960	That works.
6785960	6786960	All right.
6786960	6787960	Well, Alan's going to be joining us with his predictions tonight.
6787960	6789720	Um, sadly, Jason was with us last year, but he's on the road driving back today.
6789720	6794320	Uh, so I'll be curious to see what, uh, cause he, he was the most accurate last year.
6794320	6797200	So it'll be a hoot and a holler and let the list turns out this year.
6797200	6798200	So, um, okay.
6798200	6802120	Anyway, let's get back to the music here while I explain the way listless works.
6802120	6803120	All right.
6803120	6807080	So we are going to build a list and the way that we are going to build the list is each
6807080	6811380	host, uh, and Alan, our, our special cohost tonight, we'll go around and give their top
6811380	6812600	three answers.
6812600	6816800	Then the difficult round comes where we each eliminate one answer from the list that will
6816800	6821920	leave a list of eight that you, the listeners, the live chatters, the live folks can vote
6821920	6827940	on in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
6827940	6830660	You must be logged into the site to see it.
6830660	6834500	If you're not logged in, you will not see a pop up right under the chat, but we're going
6834500	6836340	to put up the board right now.
6836340	6841740	What is the official OLR quote 2015 in video gaming prediction?
6841740	6843340	So we did it last year and it was a lot of fun.
6843340	6845620	So we're going to do it again right now.
6845620	6849380	Um, okay, so here we go.
6849380	6850660	We're going to go around and build this list.
6850660	6852100	I do want to warn you guys in advance.
6852100	6857940	If you're expecting some very hardcore, serious, very, very Michael patcher analyst, serious
6857940	6862800	predictions, you're listening to the wrong show.
6862800	6866740	Our predictions tend to be a little bit tongue in cheek.
6866740	6868780	So take with that.
6868780	6869780	What do you know?
6869780	6873380	If you firmly put your tongue into your cheek, it looks like you're sucking on something
6873380	6874380	like what?
6874380	6875380	A lollipop.
6875380	6876380	Cookie.
6876380	6877380	Okay.
6877380	6878380	Jawbreaker.
6878380	6879380	Okay.
6879380	6880380	We're going to start tonight with Loki.
6880660	6884540	If please, if you have predictions, you think are worthy of the list, put them in the chat
6884540	6885540	room.
6885540	6888980	Uh, we also have the predictions that came in VR frugal question of the week earlier.
6888980	6893220	Uh, usually if a host gets an answer stolen, which happens sometimes two people think the
6893220	6894220	same thing.
6894220	6899340	We'll turn to our chat room and so forth to help us fill in, uh, those extra spots.
6899340	6901020	So, uh, here we go.
6901020	6904180	And SSJ 100, Matt telling people, if you don't have a vog account, you can register in like
6904180	6906100	five seconds, then you can vote on the list list.
6906100	6907100	That's absolutely right.
6907100	6908100	All right.
6908100	6909100	We're gonna start with Loki tonight.
6909100	6914500	What is your number three answer for the official OLR 2015 and video gaming prediction?
6914500	6919420	Oh, it's unfortunate, but my game won't be out next year or this year.
6919420	6923460	I mean, yeah, it's 2015.
6923460	6930180	Rob just wheezed, I just wheezed because I love the, this is basically his, his way of
6930180	6932220	announcing he's already delayed his game.
6932220	6933220	No, I haven't.
6933220	6935820	I'm just like, I'm, I'm being realistic here.
6935820	6940020	You know, I hope that I'm wrong and I hope I can prove myself wrong, but I just don't
6940020	6941660	think it's going on his wall.
6941660	6945500	He has a big banner that says the mentor and it's Gabe Newell and he kisses his fingers
6945500	6948420	and presses it to his lips and says, no game this year.
6948420	6952700	I'm doing it for you.
6952700	6964580	Loki's game gets delayed kissing his Gavin, uh, scroll going, I learned from you pop up.
6964740	6966940	Don't listen to the, what the rest of them say.
6966940	6967940	It's our time.
6967940	6968940	Okay.
6968940	6970680	We weren't, we were working on this in our time.
6970680	6972420	Just bring me another say me time.
6972420	6973420	Bring me another sale.
6973420	6975460	Big pop me time valve time.
6975460	6977460	All right.
6977460	6980000	I will go next with my number three answer.
6980000	6984660	My number three answer on the list will be, okay, look, this is the thing that nobody
6984660	6990640	wants to hear, but we had an answer similar to this earlier that some company is going
6990640	6993020	to go under this next year.
6993020	6998060	And as much as you guys don't want to hear it, my answer is Konami gets bought.
6998060	6999060	That's right.
6999060	7002100	Konami, who we have to thank probably for this show's existence.
7002100	7005340	I'm going out on the line and saying, Konami gets bought.
7005340	7009660	Look, I know they have a big casino business and all this other stuff that they're making
7009660	7014220	money from now, but let's be real, Konami ain't quite in the same shape that it was
7014220	7015220	before.
7015220	7018980	So, uh, I'm, I'm going to be so bold as to say, Konami gets bought.
7018980	7022700	They get bought by Capcom and then they can be mediocre together.
7022700	7027860	Just I'm just, I'm just, I'm just being a salt snake and street fighter.
7027860	7028860	I'm down with that.
7028860	7029860	That's right.
7029860	7030860	That's right.
7030860	7031940	Street fighter versus metal gear.
7031940	7032940	Let's hear it.
7032940	7033940	Let's hear.
7033940	7034940	All right.
7034940	7035940	Konami gets bought.
7035940	7036940	I'm putting that up on the board.
7036940	7037940	All right.
7037940	7038940	Dark Sakura, you're up next.
7038940	7039940	What is your number three?
7039940	7048020	The black Wolf in chat says like Capcom can afford.
7048020	7052540	I would love to see yacht club games by Capcom or, or what's the company making mighty number
7052540	7053540	nine.
7053540	7054540	All right.
7054540	7055540	Anyway, I'm all laughing aside.
7055540	7058200	Dark Sakura, what is your number three answer?
7058200	7062780	Mind controlled game as in, well, they've got the technology now to where they can use
7062780	7069500	nerve, uh, your nerves to control like, you know, external lens and prosthetics and everything.
7069500	7074020	And they're working on, um, you know, wiring the brain where, you know, they're, they can
7074020	7076500	give vision to people who are blind.
7076500	7081300	It just seems to me that it's probably not going to happen, but I think sometime in the
7081300	7085440	future, we're going to have that technology to where someone can use their nerve impulses
7085440	7087740	or something to control a figure in a game.
7087740	7093260	So maybe we'll say, um, could we go so far as to say consumer mind control game?
7093260	7094260	Possibly.
7094260	7095260	Okay.
7095260	7097180	I'm going to just put that on there because I think some might argue that that game already
7097180	7100260	exists in these very, like kind of what you were saying there.
7100260	7104340	So I think if we say consumer mind control game, then we can definitely say this doesn't
7104340	7106300	exist yet, but may later.
7106300	7107300	May later.
7107300	7108300	All right.
7108300	7109540	Uh, let's see.
7109540	7111460	Going to our list here.
7111460	7113420	So far, we got Loki's game gets delayed.
7113420	7116020	Konami gets bought and consumer mind controlled game.
7116020	7117020	Thank you.
7117020	7118020	Chat rooms.
7118020	7119020	Comcept.
7119020	7120020	That's what I was thinking of.
7120020	7121020	Comcept.
7121020	7122020	Comcept will buy them both.
7122020	7123020	They'll overtake the earth.
7123020	7124020	Alan alchemy.
7124020	7125020	We are to you now.
7125020	7126700	Last year, your number three answer was a bit of a shocker.
7126700	7129100	So I'm, I'm very curious what you have in store for us this year.
7129100	7131740	I have one grim, serious one.
7131740	7132740	Okay.
7133220	7135660	I have backups now that it's going to come later.
7135660	7136940	I do have backups.
7136940	7140860	Most of them are too safe.
7140860	7142140	So that's kind of the mood I'm in.
7142140	7143140	All right.
7143140	7147500	Um, let's see.
7147500	7154900	Yet another three D S Q and enhancement of the two DS and enhancement or a smaller version
7154900	7158480	of the one that came out that has the removable face plates.
7158480	7161940	They're going to redo that before the year is up and may not be out, but it'll be announced.
7161940	7164420	I think they should make a transformer three DS.
7164420	7166340	That's both a three DS and a two DS.
7166340	7167580	There you go.
7167580	7168820	And the new three DS doesn't count.
7168820	7171020	I was going to say, isn't the new three DS already?
7171020	7172020	No, it doesn't count.
7172020	7173100	It's out in Japan.
7173100	7177340	So I'm including that one with the second thumb stick and the, and the customized little.
7177340	7180420	So if they release that in the U S it doesn't count because it's all right, but they need
7180420	7183000	to announce in Japan.
7183000	7184420	Another one, yet another something else.
7184420	7188580	Yet another three DS skew, no four DS predictions.
7188580	7191140	It will bend time.
7191140	7194700	All right.
7194700	7196040	It has three screens.
7196040	7197040	You guys has three.
7197040	7198040	All right.
7198040	7199580	So our list so far, Loki's game gets delayed.
7199580	7203940	Konami gets bought consumer mind controlled game and yet another three DS skew.
7203940	7205940	All right.
7205940	7207300	Let's go to the number two answers.
7207300	7210440	Loki, what are you gonna put on the list?
7210440	7213820	This is so not going to happen next year, but I'm just going to throw it out there anyways
7213820	7218460	because I would, you know, was ill prepared and didn't prepare beforehand.
7218460	7222940	But I'm just going to make a bold announcement that, uh, Microsoft is going to announce,
7222940	7224480	Hey, you know what?
7224480	7230540	Now is the time for Minecraft two electric boogaloo.
7230540	7233460	I almost put that on my list.
7233460	7236940	Uh, Microsoft says they go all in and they say Minecraft two.
7236940	7237940	Yeah.
7237940	7238940	E three.
7238940	7243620	I think, I think it's even so bold as to announce it at E3 Minecraft two and they bring out
7243620	7248660	some hoity-toity developer who's working on it, who took over for the guy who just bought
7248660	7253500	Beyonce's mission.
7253500	7262700	They have Lars Von Trier is the artistic director for Minecraft two.
7262700	7268300	It's really badly lit and nobody's wearing makeup and the blocks of despair won't stop
7268300	7269300	crying
7269300	7275700	Wow.
7275700	7278900	Lars Von Trier is Minecraft two.
7278900	7279900	I love it.
7279900	7280900	All right.
7280900	7281900	Uh, there it is.
7281900	7282900	It's on the list.
7282900	7284220	Let's go to the next answer.
7284220	7288140	See, the sad thing is half our chatters probably don't even understand how funny that really
7288140	7289140	is when he just did.
7289140	7290140	All right.
7290140	7292460	Anyway, but for the half to do that to do all right.
7292460	7298580	My number two answer, you know what this we've seen in the past year that third party support
7298580	7300660	has really been hurting the Wii U.
7300660	7306660	And so what I'm going to say is going to happen in 2015 EA is going to buckle under the pressure
7306660	7311860	of the society and the tweets and all that stuff EA is going to release a Wii U game
7311860	7324000	and it tanks EA releases a Wii U game finally and it tanks, but not counting all the stuff
7324000	7325000	they've already released.
7325000	7328380	I realized they had like four in the window, but let's be real.
7328380	7334500	So by definition, they would be releasing a third party game on the Wii U, so that would
7334500	7336140	tank anyways by default.
7336140	7337140	Oh, stop.
7337140	7341340	I know that their Wii U version of mass effect three is the definitive one.
7341340	7344060	It's the best one out there.
7344060	7345260	I own it.
7345260	7346260	I own it.
7346260	7347260	All right.
7347260	7348260	Uh, it's just the comic.
7348260	7351020	The pro they should have just put out the goddamn trilogy and the no DLC and then a
7351020	7352020	multiplayer.
7352020	7354060	They had just put out the goddamn trilogy on Wii U.
7354060	7356620	It would have been fine because then it would have been the same price.
7356620	7361620	It wasn't anyway, nerd rage, dark soccer.
7361620	7363300	What's your number two answer.
7363300	7369800	We have an entire year full of, uh, dragon age inquisition DLC that includes something
7369800	7374100	that was much like Citadel for mass effect.
7374100	7378820	I personally am looking forward to the egg hunt DLC and I'm not going to spoil anything
7378820	7379820	from that.
7379820	7380820	All right.
7380820	7384980	A year full of dragon age inquisition DLC.
7384980	7388500	Talk about a safe answer.
7388500	7390060	BioWare DLC.
7390060	7391060	Get out, get out.
7391060	7392060	All right.
7392060	7395460	The thing is that they had said that they weren't going to be able to do DLC for frostbite
7395460	7396460	or something.
7396460	7398420	I think they're going to figure it out.
7398420	7399420	Oh, it's a miracle.
7399420	7401340	They already said, oh, it can't be modded.
7401340	7402820	Yeah, I can.
7402820	7403820	People are already doing it.
7403820	7404820	It's a miracle.
7404820	7405820	Okay.
7405820	7407920	I see where your answer comes from because they've gone on record saying they're not
7407920	7408920	going to do it.
7408920	7409920	Then they're going to come back and say JK.
7409920	7411740	And what's the first character mod that came out?
7411740	7419020	A softer Cassandra with makeup and without her scar because dude, bros are gross.
7419020	7420500	Do we have nudie mods yet?
7420500	7421500	No.
7421500	7425420	Someone's trying to do one for solace to make him look like his original concept where he
7425420	7426420	had the black dreads.
7426420	7433300	Actually, there is, um, if, if a NPC that you can romance has a tasteful sex scene where
7433300	7437020	it shows them like you get to see Dorian's butt, sorry for spoilers.
7437020	7440980	People have found a way to take that skin and force it over his clothes in the real
7440980	7441980	game.
7441980	7444940	And there's also the fly cam is available now.
7444940	7448260	I mean, the, which basically you can see the dudes have no junk.
7448260	7449260	That's it.
7449260	7450260	All right.
7450260	7453020	Well, uh, Alan, it's time for your number two choice.
7453020	7456140	What is your number two 2015 gaming prediction?
7456140	7463560	Punishing abject silence from valve on anything except financials.
7463560	7467940	No controller, no DLC for Dota two, nothing.
7467940	7469660	No steam machines.
7469660	7472500	You're going to go with the guy who says the steam machines don't happen, but they could
7472500	7475580	have updates on a team fortress too.
7475580	7481980	Well, yeah, I mean, but as far as like a, like an, uh, an announcement as to like no
7481980	7487180	fucking three that's or, or, well, yeah, but also no left for dead three, no source to
7487180	7492860	no can no new controller yet another year of Jack and shit from, from valve aside from
7492860	7495300	our steam store made a lot of money.
7495300	7496300	That's it.
7496300	7497300	That's all we're getting.
7497300	7498700	All right.
7498740	7499740	Fair enough.
7499740	7500740	Fair enough.
7500740	7501740	All right.
7501740	7506660	Let's get now to the number one answers, hopefully going to be a little more, a little more out
7506660	7507660	of the safe zone.
7507660	7508660	We'll see.
7508660	7509660	We'll see.
7509660	7510660	All right.
7510660	7511660	Loki, one more item for the board.
7511660	7512660	What is it going to be for you?
7512660	7513660	Since we've already heard the rumors.
7513660	7516380	I'm just going to go with it anyways, that there will be a new console that will enter
7516380	7519540	the market to compete with the other consoles.
7519540	7520540	From a new company?
7520540	7521540	From another company.
7521540	7522540	Yes.
7522540	7526260	So, but you're not talking something like Ouya, you're talking something like big from
7526260	7531700	like Samsung or somebody enters in a big way with a console on the level of PlayStation
7531700	7532700	four, Xbox one.
7532700	7533700	All right.
7533700	7534700	Fair enough.
7534700	7535700	That's a bold prediction.
7535700	7536700	Sure is.
7536700	7539260	I mean, that, that may be their intention.
7539260	7543480	Will it go the way you do you ever maybe, but there will be someone that will at least
7543480	7544480	make the attempt.
7544480	7546180	All right.
7546180	7551260	My number one answer is going to be, uh, you know, and some of you may say that's never
7551260	7553140	going to happen and that might be true.
7553140	7557060	So maybe this one is just wishful thinking a little bit, but not my number one answer
7557060	7562500	is one of those DDOS brats gets the death penalty.
7562500	7563500	That's my number one answer.
7563500	7564500	That's a little much.
7564500	7569600	I'm not saying, I didn't say it was because of the DDOS thing.
7569600	7571620	I just said, they're going to get the death penalty.
7571620	7573840	We're setting an example of this guy.
7573840	7577420	So there it is set an example.
7577420	7578420	So there it is.
7578420	7580380	One of the DDOS brats gets the death penalty.
7580380	7581380	That's my number one.
7581380	7586580	We already have a precedent of a hacker getting, um, more punishment than the crimes that they
7586580	7587580	exposed in the hack.
7587580	7592180	And to, and to, and to elaborate also, and when I said, yes, it will not be just another
7592180	7593180	Android console.
7593180	7596620	It will be a console console, not an Android console.
7596620	7597620	All right.
7597620	7598620	Fair enough.
7598620	7601560	And again, I'm not saying they got the death penalty because of the DDOS.
7601560	7606460	It's just, you know, how long until someone dies over the shit is all I'm saying.
7606460	7609220	How long, how long?
7609220	7612260	Bonds 006 says, wow, Rob, a bit harsh there.
7612260	7613260	Nope.
7613260	7614260	Nope.
7614260	7622260	How dare you take away my PlayStation during Christmas.
7622260	7624660	But maybe, maybe they just happened to murder somebody too.
7624660	7626640	I mean, they already have a record of crime.
7626640	7631380	Now I just picture you as a Mrs. White.
7631380	7633980	I hated them so much.
7633980	7637100	Flames on the side of my face.
7637100	7644460	Yes, because you know, it's, it's such a slippery slope, you know, uh, executing code to, you
7644460	7652140	know, use a system, you know, a, a bunch of, um, you know, computers to flood a site and
7652140	7653140	murder.
7653140	7654140	Yeah.
7654140	7658420	It's pretty similar, pushy pixels and chat saying, remind me not to pirate anything around
7658420	7659420	to Rob.
7659420	7663780	And fifth dream says we get to punch you once for every request you sent the server.
7663780	7665340	I love that idea.
7665340	7668900	Punch them in the Dick one time for every request that they sent to the server.
7668900	7669900	You know what?
7669900	7675060	They could be, they could be genetically female, uh, then punched them in the hoo-ha once every
7675060	7676060	time.
7676060	7679060	Ha, we didn't send a request to the server.
7679060	7680060	Other computers did.
7680060	7685660	So ha, no Dick punches for me, genital punching, genital punching for everybody.
7685660	7689780	That was the name of my band in high school.
7689780	7695620	I don't really like this new punch out game from Nintendo.
7695620	7698220	We you presents little Mac gentle to punch.
7698220	7699220	All right.
7699220	7702740	Uh, dark Sakura, your number one answer.
7702740	7708780	Mass Effect four will be surprisingly good and still piss people off because it won't
7708780	7709780	be out next year.
7709780	7710780	Hold on.
7710780	7712140	I'm writing that down.
7712140	7713140	Mass Effect four is good.
7713140	7715220	It will still piss people off.
7715220	7716220	Yes.
7716220	7722100	What a Jamie list we have here with dragon age and Mass Effect mind control and mind
7722100	7723100	control.
7723100	7724100	At least bizarre tech.
7724100	7725100	All right.
7725100	7726100	There it is.
7726100	7727380	It's added there to the list.
7727380	7730220	Alan alchemy, your number one answer.
7730220	7732100	The very last entry on the list.
7732100	7736460	I want an opportunity once the chat has voted at the end of the show to read off quickly
7736460	7737980	mice throw away ones.
7737980	7738980	Sure.
7738980	7739980	Got some good stuff here.
7739980	7740980	Sure.
7740980	7741980	Should I do the grim serious one?
7741980	7742980	Absolutely.
7742980	7743980	All right.
7743980	7752220	This year there will be, uh, within the industry lit litigation from a woman or women about
7752220	7753220	a social issue.
7753220	7754220	Oh no.
7754220	7755220	What?
7755220	7758380	Like an IGN reporter was like, Oh yeah, these dudes at such and such company said that if
7758380	7763100	I gave them their phone number, they'd let me preview a game like actual, like it's going
7763100	7767820	to come out and there will be damages over rewarded.
7767820	7769300	Sorry.
7769300	7770420	It's depressing how likely that is.
7770420	7773220	If you don't want to, if you don't want to put it, I'll, I'll put it on the line.
7773460	7774460	I'm fine with it.
7774460	7780020	It's yeah, it's, uh, it's, it's as, as sick as the answer you put up last year.
7780020	7785060	So actual journalism scandal over, uh, yeah.
7785060	7786620	Over sex for secrets.
7786620	7791460	Or it could be, um, like a racial thing or like gay thing, but just something.
7791460	7794740	Or could I just say an actual ethics and journalism debate?
7794740	7801800	Well, yeah, but my, my thing that makes it, my point is that it's at actual goes to litigation.
7801800	7806400	Like there's an act where it's civic court, like someone is sued by a person or groups
7806400	7807840	of people over an issue like this.
7807840	7808840	Okay.
7808840	7813000	So I'm going to say on the board, actual journey journalism scandal to litigation over sex
7813000	7814000	for secrets.
7814000	7815000	Yes.
7815000	7816000	All right.
7816000	7817000	There it is.
7817000	7818000	It's up on the board.
7818000	7823080	We can always rely on Alan to give us something depressing and humbling, uh, to ruin our new
7823080	7824080	year.
7824080	7825080	There it is.
7825080	7826080	Thank you, Alan.
7826080	7827280	Uh, here it is the list.
7827280	7829840	Let's go through the answers that are on the list.
7829840	7832560	And then we get to the eliminations.
7832560	7834200	Loki's game gets delayed.
7834200	7837200	Konami gets bought consumer mind controlled game.
7837200	7838840	Yet another 3DS skew.
7838840	7844480	Microsoft announces Minecraft to EA releases a Wii U game and a tanks a year full of dragon
7844480	7849440	age inquisition DLC, punishing silence from valve on anything but financials new console
7849440	7850740	that enters the market.
7850740	7853200	One of these DDoS brats gets the death penalty.
7853200	7854200	Mass Effect four is good.
7854200	7859040	It will still piss people off and actual journalism scandal to litigation over sex
7859040	7860040	for secrets.
7860040	7865120	All right, here's the round that nobody likes, but it must be done as part of scientifically
7865120	7866120	the process.
7866120	7870640	Loki, since you were first, I'm starting with you tonight, which of these is not worthy
7870640	7871640	of the list?
7871640	7872640	I cannot be getting bought.
7872640	7873640	They're not going to get bought.
7873640	7877960	And because they have Metal Gear Solid five coming out and then they've also got silent
7877960	7881520	Hills that probably will be out later this year.
7881520	7883560	I'm pretty confident that they'll be fine.
7883560	7885040	You and your fucking realism.
7885040	7886040	All right.
7886040	7887040	It is stricken from the list.
7887040	7892120	Konami gets bought is stricken from the list of Capcom getting a lot of, a lot of chat
7892120	7895000	room people, not a fan of that answer.
7895000	7898680	So I think a lot of people very happy you eliminated that from the list.
7898680	7899680	All right.
7899680	7900680	Uh, I'm up next.
7900680	7902760	Uh, which of these is not worthy of the list?
7902760	7907760	I am going to say, um, I, uh, sorry.
7907760	7912800	Uh, no, no, I'm so close to taking one of yours off Jamie, but I'm actually going to
7912840	7915120	go ahead and eliminate one of Loki's a revenge vote.
7915120	7918840	I'm going to eliminate Loki's game gets delayed because he's not allowed to delay it.
7918840	7919840	There it is.
7919840	7920840	Now it's gone.
7920840	7921840	It is stricken from the list.
7921840	7927200	Well, now you can't, it's gone stricken from the list.
7927200	7931760	Dark soccer gets by unscathed that I almost went for one of her answers, but I decided
7931760	7932760	on that one.
7932760	7933760	All right.
7933760	7934760	My answers are great.
7934760	7935760	All right.
7935760	7936760	Dark soccer.
7936760	7937760	Which of these is not worthy of the list?
7937760	7941840	Um, don't, don't hurt yourself.
7941880	7944960	I make a career out of hurting myself over here.
7944960	7947920	Um, get a workman's comp issue away.
7947920	7953160	I'm going to say the EU releasing the game that tanks because people buy EU shit anyway.
7953160	7955400	EA releasing a Wii U game that tanks.
7955400	7956960	You are eliminating that from the list.
7956960	7957960	Yeah.
7957960	7958960	And sorry.
7958960	7961560	I mean, that was the only one that really just, and there goes my list.
7961560	7963280	They've done good.
7963280	7964800	They've done games that haven't tanked.
7964800	7965800	All right.
7965800	7966800	All right.
7966800	7968600	Well, I still think that was accurate, but whatever.
7968600	7973440	This just means y'all just gave immunity to one of these DDoS brats gets the death penalty
7973440	7974440	is now immune.
7974440	7975440	I had a plan.
7975440	7976440	I had a plan.
7976440	7981040	So Alan may not remove that answer because no host may have their list completely eliminated.
7981040	7985120	So Alan, that one aside, which of these is not worthy of the list?
7985120	7991400	Hmm, I'm sorry.
7991400	7993320	I'm reading, I'm reading out off the screen.
7993320	7995920	I'm trying to pick between two.
7995920	8002920	Uh, I am going to eliminate the mass effect for one just cause I don't think we're getting
8002920	8004420	it this year.
8004420	8008680	And of course people will have a problem with the content Bioware can't win for losing.
8008680	8010020	So all right.
8010020	8013120	So yeah, I got to admit that was 2016.
8013120	8016160	I would say so because I think that's when we're really going to have assets to look
8016160	8018160	at for Mass Effect.
8018160	8019160	All right.
8019160	8020160	Well, sorry, Jamie.
8020160	8021160	Sorry, Jamie.
8021160	8022160	But it's okay.
8022160	8023580	Hey, at least you still have two answers on the board.
8023580	8024580	I get one.
8024580	8028620	But yours is, but your answer is honestly beautiful.
8028620	8029620	It's a precious angel.
8029620	8030620	It's a sweet snowflake.
8030620	8032460	Well now don't influence the vote, Jamie.
8032460	8033460	Don't influence the vote.
8033460	8034460	All right.
8034460	8035460	Here it is.
8035460	8036460	Your list that is left to vote on.
8036460	8037860	I was just petting your ego.
8037860	8038860	And well, thank you.
8038860	8039860	I appreciate that.
8039860	8040860	That's always nice to have.
8040860	8041860	Uh, here it is.
8041860	8046160	The list of the answers you may vote on Microsoft announces Minecraft two new console enters
8046160	8047160	the market.
8047160	8049860	One of these DDoS brats gets the death penalty.
8049860	8054180	Remember mind controlled game a year full of dragon age inquisition DLC yet another
8054180	8059900	three DS skew punishing silence from valve on anything but financials and actual journalism
8059900	8062620	scandal to litigation over sex for secrets.
8062620	8063620	How did that one get by?
8063620	8064620	Look at that.
8064620	8066440	Alan's list because we expect it.
8066440	8072860	The controversial always Alan alchemy is list escapes completely unscathed to look at that.
8072860	8073860	So there it is.
8073860	8074860	It is your turn to answer.
8074860	8078680	You're going to click on your number one and then click on your number two.
8078680	8079880	Those votes are weighted.
8079880	8083720	So think carefully before clicking, you click on your number one and you click on your number
8083720	8087320	two answer and then you're going to click answer at the bottom of the screen and that
8087320	8092520	will submit the votes for the official tabulation and we will tabulate those votes and get the
8092520	8099320	answer for the official OLR 2015 video gaming prediction after a little bit here on OLR.
8099320	8102760	Um, Alan, I'm sure you're probably stepping out at this point to go play more games.
8102760	8106000	Oh, you wanted to read some of your rejects.
8106000	8108440	Should I do that now or should I do it after the voting?
8108440	8109440	Why not?
8109440	8110440	Hold on one sec.
8110440	8111440	It's too late.
8111440	8113880	The list, the top three is coming from these eight, so it's too late now.
8113880	8114880	Okay.
8114880	8120000	The only bummer is if one of these, uh, ends up, uh, uh, being better, but we'll see elder
8120000	8124680	scrolls online and wild star together become free to play a little bit too.
8124680	8126000	That was on my list.
8126000	8127000	Okay.
8127000	8131520	That was my extra answer is that elder scrolls online doesn't make its console release.
8131520	8135340	It just similar gets just evaporated.
8135340	8137080	Elder scrolls online just evaporates.
8137080	8138080	Yeah.
8138120	8144760	And then Loki covered this one, but I was going to say Microsoft, Microsoft announces
8144760	8148720	officially what they're doing with Minecraft and once everyone sees it, no one will care
8148720	8149720	that they bought it.
8149720	8150720	They'll love it.
8150720	8151720	They'll immediately fickle game.
8151720	8152920	We'd be like, yes, I want it.
8152920	8153920	It's so good.
8153920	8155760	They won't care where it comes from because that's what happens.
8155760	8156760	Okay.
8156760	8159600	But yeah, that's a very positive answer compared to your negativity.
8159600	8161920	And then you'll like this one is just for you.
8161920	8168840	Some shade, um, polygon at some point over the year posts an editorial masked as news
8168840	8173040	that is as dire and catastrophic as it is pretentious.
8173040	8174040	But see, that's too safe.
8174040	8175040	Yeah.
8175040	8176040	Obviously will happen.
8176040	8177040	That's that.
8177040	8178040	That's going to happen every week.
8178040	8179600	That's, that's, that's a given.
8179600	8180600	So there you go.
8180600	8183240	That's a little, little, little more, uh, rainbows and unicorns.
8183240	8184240	Those are my spares.
8184240	8185240	AKA throwaways.
8185240	8186240	That's good.
8186240	8187240	That's a good list.
8187240	8188240	Thank you.
8188240	8189240	You're always a good time.
8189240	8190240	You're Lars Von Trier Minecraft though.
8190240	8191240	That was better than anything.
8191240	8192240	That's my favorite.
8192240	8196800	The creepers are a metaphor for incest.
8196800	8197800	Soundtrack by Bjork.
8197800	8198800	And she's just crying.
8198800	8199800	Bjork crying.
8199800	8204320	Isn't that already a Bjork album?
8204320	8209960	No, it's like Bjork's beatboxing album is Minecraft.
8209960	8220040	You know, it is morning and everything is precious.
8220040	8221040	Minecraft two.
8221840	8222840	Bye.
8222840	8223840	Bye.
8223840	8226240	Thank you for blessing the show with your presence.
8226240	8227240	I appreciate it.
8227240	8228240	All right.
8228240	8230080	And not just because it's our five year anniversary.
8230080	8231080	All right.
8231080	8232080	Now you too.
8232080	8233080	All right.
8233080	8236320	Let's get to the mailbag every week.
8236320	8237400	You guys send us emails.
8237400	8241280	Now it's your chance to take over the show for a little bit.
8241280	8243000	Participate at orangelaungeradio.com.
8243000	8247840	If you want to participate with our mailbag segment, again, that's participate at orangelaungeradio.com
8247840	8250960	where you can send your emails and dark soccer will dive into the mailbag head.
8250960	8258200	First and find the email finds the emails that she believes are worthy of reading on
8258200	8259600	the show tonight.
8259600	8260600	Dark soccer.
8260600	8262640	What is in the mailbag?
8262640	8268440	First one comes from Robert M. I can't really give a proper top three since most of my leisure
8268440	8271800	time lately seems to be watching let's play videos and trying to sleep.
8271800	8274800	But here's what comes to my, this sounds like my husband.
8274800	8278800	Best 2003 13 steam purchase rogue legacy 2013.
8278800	8279800	Okay.
8279800	8280800	Yeah.
8280800	8285120	I'm glad I finally tricked this one out even though I still haven't made it much further
8285120	8286120	than the first boss.
8286120	8290760	It runs great for me except some more visually demanding traits like nearsighted or nostalgic
8290760	8293040	on my 2009 Mac book.
8293040	8295400	Gaming on a Mac.
8295400	8297800	Y'all shut up.
8297800	8302560	Smartest early access zombie survival strategy unturned.
8302560	8308360	In a store crammed with such titles, the Canadian roadblocks originated unturned with its simplistic
8308360	8313560	look, making it stand out and run on more systems than the more realistic looking games
8313560	8319160	only asked an entirely optional $5 for bonus content as opposed to the usual 20 to 40.
8319160	8323040	Its current build still doesn't always run great on my laptop though.
8323040	8325080	And then what am I doing with my life?
8325080	8327020	Smash champs for mobile.
8327020	8333760	This game is explicitly a rip off or a take on of, um, a competitive fruit ninja where
8333760	8338240	you go training, uh, where you, what, Oh, nevermind.
8338240	8343640	I was misreading it with you training, fighting animal characters, but I can't seem to stop
8343640	8346120	clicking in to take my turns.
8346120	8349720	It has this charm, but it's, uh, but it's not certainly one I would put on a proper
8349720	8351460	game of the year list.
8351460	8357960	Certainly not next to threes and uh, monument valley and that's from Robert M. All right.
8357960	8361000	Those are, that was a kind of a creative way of doing a top three.
8361000	8362000	Appreciate that.
8362000	8363000	Yep.
8363240	8363760	All right.
8363760	8365320	Um, next up.
8365320	8366320	Yep.
8367560	8372920	Hello, well, our it's cool that balloon fight came up as a classic game of the week, but
8372920	8376680	other than tons of virtual console and related releases, it seems you guys believe nothing
8376680	8379040	else has been done with the franchise.
8379040	8383540	I guess none of you played a wonderful Nintendo land on Wii U because if you had, you'd certainly
8383540	8385040	have remembered balloon trip breeze.
8385040	8386600	I did not play.
8386600	8388600	I forgot.
8388600	8390560	Like a lot of Nintendo land side.
8390560	8391560	I, I forgot.
8391560	8392560	Sorry.
8393120	8394120	I don't have a Wii U.
8394120	8396880	It wasn't as strong of a launch title as Wii sports, just saying.
8396880	8397880	That's right.
8397880	8398880	Now that he's saying that.
8398880	8399880	Oh yeah, duh.
8399880	8401260	That was a, that was a thing in Nintendo land.
8401260	8402800	It's a high good observation.
8402800	8406440	It's a high definition re-imagining of the classic one player endurance test featuring
8406440	8410600	23 stages of challenging game play and charming visuals.
8410600	8414800	There are items to collect and it means to battle and of course balloons to pop.
8414800	8415920	It's really great.
8415920	8420000	And one of the many reasons that anyone with Wii U should track down a cheap used copy
8420000	8425720	of Nintendo land, but not worth it finding a new un-purchased copy, right?
8425720	8426720	No.
8426720	8431280	Um, also because I didn't get in the top games of the year thing, I wanted to mention two
8431280	8435680	indie games that are my top three of 2014 but slipped under the radar for most people.
8435680	8442160	Bike Rider DX2 Galaxy on Nintendo 3DS is a sequel to 2013's most popular Japanese e-shop
8442160	8443160	download.
8443160	8446560	It's a very simple game where you move forward automatically, press A to jump and try to
8446560	8448020	reach the goal.
8448020	8451780	There are also pickups that allow you to float, fly, glide, drill through rocks, and more.
8451780	8456540	So it's Rainbow Unicorn Attack, or Robot Unicorn Attack.
8456540	8460620	Any game developer should take note that it's basically a clinic on both level design and
8460620	8465060	how to introduce new gameplay features throughout a game's levels, of which it has many.
8465060	8469620	It costs a whopping $2.99 and if anyone listening to this downloads it and winds up hating it,
8469620	8471660	I will pay them back.
8471660	8473040	Really?
8473040	8476940	It's the best value on the e-shop and one of the 3DS's best games.
8476940	8480480	And then TXK is Jeff Minter's latest game.
8480480	8484780	If you don't know what it is, I will say that it's a perfectly tuned version of Tempest
8484780	8488060	2000 from the creator of Space Giraffe.
8488060	8491980	If you don't know what either of those are, I'll just say that if you like arcade style
8491980	8496580	shooting, hard and fast electronic music, and pretty visuals, then grab a Vita, drop
8496580	8500540	ten bucks on this game and turn off the lights, plug in some good headphones, and feed your
8500540	8503420	head to a hundred levels of bliss.
8503420	8509100	I hadn't realized that it came out until it was released as a PS Plus download in October,
8509100	8511380	and then quickly bought it before it became free.
8511380	8514820	It was worth every cent, plus way more, and now is the best gaming experience I've had
8514820	8516140	in 2014.
8516140	8520500	If you don't own a Vita, but do own or will own a PS4, it's coming next year.
8520500	8526540	A VoG Jam Jam Reggae YYR.
8526540	8527540	I like that.
8527540	8528540	VoG Jam Jam Reggae.
8528540	8529540	Yay!
8529540	8530540	Good, some good picks!
8530540	8531860	I like that.
8531860	8533260	Okay.
8533300	8540140	And this one here is from Andy R. Let me move a bit.
8540140	8543660	Just chiming in with my picks for favorite games last year.
8543660	8547900	Three, Altilier, Escha, and Loggy.
8547900	8551420	I'm a huge fan of the series in general, but this entry especially grabbed me.
8551420	8554940	The combat has always been refined from the previous entries.
8554940	8558820	And the alchemy system, one of the big draws of the series, is especially engaging thanks
8558820	8562900	to a focus on using skills and abilities during the alchemy rather than the ingredient focus
8562940	8565620	system of some of the past games.
8565620	8571660	Two, Tales of Hearts R. Just a wonderful game, the combat is fast and fun, with a system
8571660	8575660	that lets you ping pong enemies all over the battlefield if you're good.
8575660	8577980	I also really enjoyed the characters.
8577980	8581900	I was happy that the game actually went full bore on the romance, something a lot of JRPGs
8581900	8584260	seem to leave in the implied area.
8584260	8589100	One, Guilty Gear XRD.
8589100	8592820	Only just came out in December, but I love it already.
8592860	8597740	And I've been a fan of this series for a while, but Absence really made the heart grow fonder.
8597740	8603420	It's been forever since we had a proper sequel, pretty much since the PS2, as the only PS3
8603420	8606060	release, was a port with a few balance changes.
8606060	8610100	And this game kicks the franchise back into gear, haha, in a major way.
8610100	8613740	For the last few games, if I'm not playing this game, I'm probably thinking about this
8613740	8614740	game.
8614740	8616140	For the last few weeks, sorry.
8616140	8619860	Also one disappointment, Super Smash Brothers on the 3DS.
8619860	8621540	Not the Wii U, that version is fine.
8621580	8626660	I really don't feel the 3DS version, it feels incredibly subpar compared to the Wii U version,
8626660	8629580	to the point where I almost sold it back to buy it on the Wii U.
8629580	8633460	It just feels like there's much less single player content, the main mode Smash Run is
8633460	8635980	just crap in my opinion.
8635980	8641180	And I've yet to play the 3DS version online with 4 people, and have the match not lag
8641180	8642460	a ton.
8642460	8644780	Like everyone is moving at half speed lag.
8644780	8649100	As I've said, Wii U version is good, although obviously not one of my top 3, just the 3DS
8649100	8651100	version feels like a waste of 40 bucks.
8651140	8653300	Thanks and have a happy new year, Andy R.
8653300	8656940	I get the sense that Andy R kinda likes JRPGs a little bit.
8656940	8657940	No.
8657940	8658940	No.
8658940	8659940	You don't say.
8659940	8660940	No, thanks for the email though.
8660940	8661940	Appreciate it.
8661940	8662940	Heyyyyy.
8662940	8664940	Sorry, no one saw the hand move, open.
8664940	8666940	Um, hola.
8666940	8668940	This is your friendly neighborhood Mexican act-deafed.
8668940	8669940	Hola.
8669940	8670940	Hi.
8670940	8676020	I wanted to participate in last week's show, but it has some stuff to do, but I wanted
8676020	8678780	to weigh in with my picks for best games of 2014.
8678860	8682820	I will try to make this short, but sorry if gush for some of them.
8682820	8687660	I will, however, not rank them in top 3, but rather best games based in my experience with
8687660	8688660	them.
8688660	8690900	Sleeper Hit of the Year, Lethal League.
8690900	8695700	This game combines a simple game like Pong at Smash Brothers Mechanics and Jet Set Radio's
8695700	8698380	style and gives us a really fun game.
8698380	8702260	I think it's only on Steam right now, got it during the sale, but hopefully it does
8702260	8705940	get a console release since this game deserves everyone's attention.
8705980	8711140	The Does of the Year, or my obvious picks, Smash Brothers 3DS slash Wii U, Mario Kart
8711140	8715420	8, Bayonetta 1 and 2, all Wii U I know, but in consideration of what the other consoles
8715420	8719220	had to offer, Nintendo offered all I wanted.
8719220	8720220	Surprises of the Year.
8720220	8722020	First, Captain Toad Treasure Tracker.
8722020	8725840	I love the Captain Toad levels in Super Mario 3D World, but I was worried that the Treasure
8725840	8728300	Tracker wasn't going to be that great.
8728300	8733260	I was surprised that they gave lots of life of a somewhat simple concept.
8733260	8734260	It's really awesome.
8734660	8735660	Second, Hearthstone.
8735660	8739700	Granted, I don't play a lot, but that game is really well done and quite entertaining.
8739700	8742100	I seriously cannot wait for the Android version.
8742100	8746060	And finally, my game of 2014 is Shovel Knight.
8746060	8747060	That game is freaking amazing!
8747060	8748060	Those are all in caps.
8748060	8749060	Those are all in caps.
8749060	8751380	It is a great game.
8751380	8752380	It's near perfection.
8752380	8757700	Many complain about not being fresh and the game being short, but that's what makes it
8757700	8758700	good for me.
8758700	8762020	It's everything great from the NES era and put into a single game.
8762020	8766300	That game offers replayability by giving us achievements, new games plus, and tons
8766300	8767300	of cheats.
8767300	8770700	I own the game on Wii U, 3DS, and Steam, and I'll purchase the Playstation version when
8770700	8771840	it comes out.
8771840	8777060	This is my Mass Effect slash Grand Theft Auto, but it's definitely worth the money I'm throwing
8777060	8781060	to Yacht Club games, and the hype is definitely there.
8781060	8782060	And the music.
8782060	8783060	By God, the music.
8783060	8784060	It was really good.
8784060	8785700	Well, that's it for me.
8785700	8787420	There were a lot of good games in 2014.
8787420	8791980	Hopefully 2015 can live up to the hype with Amplitude Mighty No. 9, Overwatch, Splatoon,
8791980	8798180	and Zelda, and all the other games that may come and may even not know about.
8798180	8802020	Until next time, Deft is Ka-Brown.
8802020	8803020	Great email.
8803020	8804020	Good list.
8804020	8805020	Yes.
8805020	8806020	And the last.
8806020	8807020	The last.
8807020	8808020	The last.
8808020	8809020	The final.
8809020	8811680	Hey, OLR crew, and Happy New Year to all.
8811680	8814660	By the way, this comes from AZHP, by the way.
8814660	8820300	AZHP here, done with, sorry, with a yearly reminder for all the OLR me to check out Awesome
8820300	8826300	Games Done Quick, which we mentioned during last segment, the last part.
8826300	8828860	It started this morning and runs until Saturday.
8828860	8832380	Speed gamers from all over the globe have gathered in Washington, D.C. to raise money
8832380	8837580	for the Prevent Cancer Foundation, which you should always, always look for anything other
8837580	8842700	than the Susan G. Komen Foundation for your cancer donations, because Komen is evil.
8842700	8844060	Okay, right.
8844060	8845780	Moving on.
8845780	8848900	Last year, they raised over $1 million throughout the week.
8848900	8854180	They already topped $100,000 today, and not counting donations, but that counts from going
8854180	8858820	through the different store things, so not the individual contributions.
8858820	8863500	It's been less than 12 hours and they've already raised $125,000.
8863500	8866700	It's pretty crazy, but let's try and break last year's record and make this the most
8866700	8870660	successful charity marathon yet and prove that gamers can do good sometimes.
8870660	8872300	Yours truly, AZHP.
8872300	8873300	P.S.
8873300	8878380	The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time run record was broken earlier this week by Joden Stone,
8878380	8885340	who beat Cosmo's record of 18.10 by 3 seconds to bring it to an exceptionally low 18.07.
8885340	8892100	People are estimating that an absolutely perfect run could reach 17.59, so it's ridiculously
8892100	8893900	optimized.
8893900	8899060	And this guy got into speed running only two years after watching AGQD 2013, so it's never
8899060	8900300	too late to get into the game.
8900300	8901300	Who knows?
8901300	8902300	You could be a world record holder someday, too.
8902300	8903300	That's right.
8903300	8908140	The record, the Banjo one that they did today, only missed the record by four seconds.
8908140	8909140	Oh, wow.
8909140	8910140	Yeah.
8910140	8911900	It was a really, really solid run.
8911900	8912900	That's awesome.
8912900	8916220	And it's funny, AZHP took my last story, because I was going to tell you guys about this.
8916220	8919140	It was on my list of things to tell you about tonight anyway.
8919140	8923700	They pick a really good time of year to do it because they can get a lot of coverage
8923700	8927140	because there's not a lot of other gaming news going on this year, so this is a great
8927140	8928580	thing to be reporting on.
8928580	8931620	So I guess the only other thing I would add to this that AZHP didn't already say in his
8931620	8936300	email is that there is a Humble Bundle to go along with this, and it had come up a little
8936300	8937660	earlier in the show.
8937660	8942340	So another way, and they're sending all their money that they make on this Humble Bundle,
8942340	8944780	you know, with the tips and all that.
8944780	8948780	You can just choose to have all your money go to that same Prevent Cancer Foundation,
8948780	8950340	which is really cool.
8950340	8952540	You can choose how the money is split.
8952540	8958420	Just to throw out there, the stuff that you get for free, Duke Nukem 3D Megaton Edition,
8958420	8965060	Shadow Warrior Classic Redo, Oddworld Abe's Odyssey, Volgar the Viking, and then for $6,
8965060	8970020	there's a Twitch Turbo subscription, Shantae Risky Revenge Director's Cut, Speedrunner's
8970020	8974900	Early Access, how appropriate for this, and Speedrunner's YouTuber packs.
8974900	8980780	And then lastly, $10 or more will get you a scapegoat 2 and an XSplit premium 3-month
8980780	8981780	subscription.
8981780	8986020	You can also, if you're willing to toss in $30, there's like t-shirts, buttons, stickers,
8986020	8990380	a lot of extra stuff with that as well, so lots and lots and lots of good stuff there
8990380	8993860	that you can also help contribute to the same charity.
8993860	8997500	Even though I don't think this money counts towards what they're tabulating on their Twitch
8997500	9002580	channel, I'm not sure if it's all together, but certainly still counts.
9002580	9006500	They're doing great stuff with that charity, so props to them.
9006500	9010020	And fuck cancer, I think very important to say.
9010020	9011020	Fuck cancer.
9011020	9012020	All right.
9012020	9015040	This is your last call to vote in tonight's List List.
9015080	9018000	Get your points by voting in tonight's List List now.
9018000	9023400	This is your last chance, last call for List List votes, live.vognetwork.com.
9023400	9027800	You only have about a minute and a half left because it, well, maybe five minutes, depending
9027800	9029120	on how this segment goes tonight.
9029120	9032560	It is time for the FUs of the Week.
9045040	9048400	This is fucked up.
9048400	9053400	I had something I was really angry about earlier today, but I don't remember what it is.
9053400	9062520	So FU two days off not having an extra four hours each day, and my days on being short
9062520	9063520	four hours.
9063520	9066560	They should just move those around.
9066560	9070000	Come on, doctor, change time and space for me.
9070000	9071000	That's a fair request.
9071000	9072920	Loki, your FU of the Week.
9072920	9074760	I guess FV did.
9074760	9079720	Children that don't sleep because our son was up for like three hours last night.
9079720	9080720	So that's fun.
9080720	9083040	And also my new schedule is kind of weird.
9083040	9088160	I have to go in an hour and 45 minutes or hour and 15 minutes later in the morning.
9088160	9090160	So I don't know how that's going to work.
9090160	9094280	I just know there's going to be more traffic both to and from work.
9094280	9095280	So that's kind of lame.
9095280	9096280	Yeah.
9096280	9097280	Tomorrow's going to be a crappy.
9097280	9098480	And my lunch is 15 minutes shorter.
9098480	9102720	So it's like, yeah, everybody goes back to work tomorrow.
9102720	9104280	So it's going to be a really crappy commute.
9104800	9105800	So good luck, everybody.
9105800	9106800	That's why I'm going to leave early.
9106800	9107800	There you go.
9107800	9109320	That's why I'm glad Monday's my day off.
9109320	9110320	Lucky you.
9110320	9112320	And I live eight minutes from work.
9112320	9113320	Right.
9113320	9118720	Well, the FU for me is that FU to having to go back to work tomorrow and it's just been
9118720	9122440	very exhausting lately, but at least have Seattle look forward to in a couple of weeks.
9122440	9125040	I've got to make the money somehow.
9125040	9130680	So FU to deadlines that sneak up on you out of nowhere.
9130680	9131680	That's my other.
9131680	9132680	I do have another one.
9132680	9133680	All right, fine.
9134080	9136960	Is everyone having the plague for my new year's party, Rob?
9136960	9141520	Hey, look, blame the Chinese food I ate on not only Sunday, but Tuesday.
9141520	9143520	It didn't make me sick and Dan finished mine off.
9143520	9148000	I think it was it was just that my stomach was already kind of because I ate a lot of
9148000	9149000	that.
9149000	9154800	But then I made eight Panda Express on Tuesday and that I see you've had overload.
9154800	9155800	The end.
9155800	9156800	Yeah.
9156800	9157800	Over by the way.
9157800	9158800	Fifth dream.
9158800	9159800	I got your fun link and I'm going to watch it when I get home.
9159800	9160800	It's fake Bjork.
9160800	9161800	Oh God.
9161800	9163040	All right.
9163400	9172120	So it is time, everybody, to get the definitive list that you guys have all voted on tonight.
9172120	9173120	That's right.
9173120	9174120	We have tabulated the votes.
9174120	9176920	And yes, I actually have the votes tonight.
9176920	9182480	We have tabulated your votes and we have your answers for the definitive list.
9182480	9183480	Here it is.
9183480	9186480	The official O.L.R. 2015 predictions.
9186480	9191520	Number three, Microsoft announces Minecraft two.
9191520	9194720	Microsoft announces Minecraft two is the number three winner.
9194720	9199560	And for number two tonight, we have a tie O.M.G.
9199560	9201400	It's a tie for the number two answer.
9201400	9209600	Number two answer is yet another 3DS skew and punishing silence from Valve on anything
9209600	9212480	but financials is the number two.
9212480	9213480	Yay.
9213480	9214480	Alan for tying twice.
9214480	9215480	There you go, Alan.
9215480	9216480	Alan tied with himself.
9216480	9217780	Tied himself.
9217780	9218960	There it is.
9218960	9225160	And the number one answer, and might I say a bit by a landslide, the number one answer
9225160	9230360	tonight for your top 2015 prediction.
9230360	9236000	One of those DDoS brats gets the death penalty is the official O.L.R.
9236000	9237000	Wishful thinking.
9237000	9241360	See, aren't you glad I left that one alone?
9241360	9247040	I think it's a little bit of wishful thinking on everybody's part there.
9247120	9252560	It's just taking that off because no one would have voted for Konami being sold, so damn.
9252560	9255320	You need to strategize a little better next time.
9255320	9256800	So there it is.
9256800	9261400	The death penalty coming to one of those DDoS brats in 2014.
9261400	9264200	Ah, love it, love it, love it.
9264200	9265200	All right.
9265200	9267240	Thank you guys for participating with that.
9267240	9268380	That was a lot of fun.
9268380	9273020	And just like we did this year, assuming this show is still going next year, I don't see
9273020	9274060	why it wouldn't be.
9274100	9278580	We will revisit these predictions and see how far we've come.
9278580	9280220	All right.
9280220	9281220	There it is.
9281220	9282660	Nobody going for the dark answer.
9282660	9286660	Like Alan Alkley brought up kind of a darker answer and interesting.
9286660	9287660	And people not doing...
9287660	9291260	I would have thought the Dragon Age Inquisition is a very safe bet, but nobody opting...
9291260	9293940	Well, it was on the board, but it was a little low.
9293940	9294940	So yeah.
9294940	9295940	There you go.
9295940	9296940	All right.
9296940	9298180	I just think no one cares anymore.
9298180	9302580	At least no one cares to follow the whole, you know, gate problems.
9302580	9303580	The ethics stuff.
9304100	9306100	Let's just leave all that fuckery in 2014.
9306100	9312900	Occasionally I'll go into, was it the subreddit that was a Kotaku in action that follows that
9312900	9313900	kind of stuff.
9313900	9314900	Fuck, I'm sorry.
9314900	9315900	Well, no, no.
9315900	9316900	That's what they just call it.
9316900	9317900	It's, you know...
9317900	9318900	No, no.
9318900	9319900	I know, but I'm still saying I'm sorry.
9319900	9322580	And it's just, it's just ridiculous stuff.
9322580	9327700	And it's, you know, like with Polygon and everything, I just, I don't read that site
9327700	9333180	anymore and they've just kind of gone in a different direction that I don't care to follow.
9333180	9336460	It's too much drama in, in game reporting, I guess.
9336460	9341380	In general, across the board, can we just leave being mean to each other in 2014?
9341380	9343100	Can we just leave that in 2014?
9343100	9345420	Like, I don't care.
9345420	9349260	Can we just leave the being mean to each other in 2014, please?
9349260	9350260	Please?
9350260	9351260	Thank you.
9351260	9353360	That should have been one of my answers.
9353360	9355980	People stop being fucking mean, but, oh yeah, it's the internet.
9355980	9357540	Oh, Rob, you're such a hippie.
9357540	9359340	Nobody's ever going to get along on the internet.
9359340	9360340	Can we...
9360860	9366100	I know, I'm saying, Black Wolf says 2015, I'm saying, can we leave the meanness in 2014?
9366100	9371060	Can we leave it behind and have 2015 be a year where people are like, oh, I don't know
9371060	9376580	civil and can have like actual debate without making it so fucking personal?
9376580	9377580	God.
9377580	9378580	All right.
9378580	9382300	Anyway, there it is.
9382300	9384340	Moving on.
9384340	9388420	Black Wolf says, no, leave it in 2015 and civility can be in 2016.
9388420	9389860	You are part of the problem, sir.
9389860	9390860	All right.
9390860	9391860	Just kidding.
9391860	9394460	Awesome Games Done Quick was going to be my last story, but seeing as we had an emailer
9394460	9397940	already report on that, I will just plug it again.
9397940	9401020	Check that out, you know, after this show is done, because you can always watch their
9401020	9403260	entire archive at any point.
9403260	9410020	Let's get into your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9410020	9411260	Please give us a call.
9411260	9414940	You can talk about your predictions if you want, maybe something in the news that we
9414940	9416500	missed tonight.
9416500	9419420	Anything you want to talk about, the time is now to give us a call.
9419420	9424540	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
9424540	9425980	Let me check in anyway.
9425980	9429460	Loki, any last minute stories tonight or even Dark Sakura?
9429460	9430460	No.
9430460	9432100	I like pie.
9432100	9434820	I had a feeling pie is tonight's last minute story.
9434820	9436420	There it is.
9436420	9440500	While we wait and see if our Skype line lights up here, let me go to our Twitter at twitter.com
9440500	9441500	slash OLR.
9441500	9446420	I don't think we got a lot of like questions or discussion topics tonight, but we did get
9446420	9450620	like act deaf tweeted us, listening to at OLR and heard this was the classic game of
9450620	9455900	the week, taking a picture of his guitar room man there, which I retweeted and some people
9455900	9457700	fans of that as well.
9457700	9460780	Kamui, I'm totally going to mispronounce this name.
9460780	9461780	I'm so sorry.
9461780	9464900	Kamui Arikado says, awesome game.
9464900	9465900	Yes, I agree.
9465900	9466900	Awesome game.
9466900	9469860	Soutor says, I love this game on my PSP.
9469860	9472180	Awesome soundtrack for metal heads.
9472700	9476420	Soutor also saying, I totes agree.
9476420	9477420	I love that word.
9477420	9478420	Totes agree.
9478420	9481180	Good way to abbreviate totally on Twitter too.
9481180	9484420	Totes agree on Manly Tears and Edward Scissorhands.
9484420	9485420	Thank you.
9485420	9486420	Thank you.
9486420	9488340	It's a movie with sad parts.
9488340	9489860	It's a fairy tale for everybody.
9489860	9490860	All right.
9490860	9495220	I just realized that CES is coming up really soon.
9495220	9496220	It is.
9496220	9498420	It's like, I already have people that have left for Vegas to go.
9498420	9499900	I think it is like this coming week.
9499900	9500900	Is it next week?
9500900	9501900	I think it's next week.
9502620	9504460	Yeah, it's coming up real soon.
9504460	9505780	It's always right in the beginning of the year.
9505780	9507460	I would love to go.
9507460	9510900	It's just, I have a lot of trips coming up this year.
9510900	9515780	I guess I could have taken Alan to CES for an anniversary trip.
9515780	9518700	I'm like, oh, by the way, we're going to go to this convention that I'm going to write
9518700	9522420	about for VOC, but I guess vacation means vacation.
9522420	9526420	We're going to relax for a few days in Seattle and go to all the tourist traps.
9526420	9527420	Yay.
9527420	9528620	But we do have a call coming in, so let's get to it.
9528620	9529620	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9529620	9530620	Who's this?
9532620	9533620	Hi, Aaron.
9533620	9535020	Hey, this is Regineer.
9535020	9536020	There you are.
9536020	9537020	Hey, buddy.
9537020	9538020	What's up?
9538020	9539020	Not much.
9539020	9541020	I'll have to make this call short and sweet.
9541020	9542020	That's fine.
9542020	9543780	I'm a little bit under the weather.
9543780	9546140	I've stopped packing my air for a minute.
9546140	9547140	Feel better.
9547140	9548860	Well, isn't it like below 30 out there?
9548860	9552820	It's like some ungodly degrees out there in the Northeast right now, isn't it?
9552820	9553820	I don't know.
9553820	9556500	I haven't been outside all day.
9556500	9560860	I've been mostly sleeping all day.
9560860	9570700	But anyway, both you and Bobby were mentioning both in chat and on the show that Capcom and
9570700	9575260	Konami really haven't been doing all that well financially speaking.
9575260	9581700	That being said, do you think it would behoove them to release some of the classic games?
9581700	9582700	No.
9582700	9590100	Not so much on consoles because they've been doing that all along, especially on Xbox Live
9590100	9597180	and PC, but at least on the PC space.
9597180	9604060	In all seriousness, we pick on Konami and Capcom a little bit because they're easy targets.
9604060	9609060	We all miss Mega Man and are a little irritated that Mega Man seemed to just kind of disappear
9609060	9613340	over on the Capcom side and that a lot of games in general seem to be disappearing over
9613340	9614340	there.
9614340	9618260	And then on the Konami side, a lot can be said similarly about, I don't know, the music
9618260	9619380	games, for one.
9619380	9622620	Castlevania, for another, has really seemed to fall on the wayside.
9622620	9628820	But in all seriousness, Konami still does have a very strong business in the casino
9628820	9632020	realm and a lot of the other things they do outside of gaming.
9632020	9634860	Pachinko, don't forget, is still a huge thing.
9634860	9638100	We don't see it here, but it's still a huge industry in other parts of the world.
9638100	9642540	Konami still does very well there.
9642540	9646060	As much as we joke about it here on the show, I don't necessarily really think that either
9646060	9653660	of those companies are going to just go under or fall belly up, but I still think acquisition
9653660	9655740	is not completely out of the picture.
9655740	9660380	I mean, sometimes these acquisitions happen and they kind of surprise us, so I never leave
9660380	9661880	that stone unturned.
9661880	9668180	That all being said, what you bring up about retro releases, especially on PC, well, you
9668180	9672140	know another Japanese company is having a lot of luck with it, it seems, and that's
9672140	9673420	Square Enix.
9673420	9677460	And it really seems that Square Enix has really made a push this year.
9677460	9682340	I never thought we would see Final Fantasy 13, nevertheless the whole trilogy, show up
9682340	9683580	on Steam.
9683580	9690540	And now it's not just PC, it's iOS and it's Android as well.
9690540	9696920	It's all of these mobile platforms where you're seeing Final Fantasy 3, 4, 5, 6, I mean you're
9696920	9701020	just seeing lots and lots of games in their archive that people really remember that they're
9701020	9702740	really pushing out there.
9702740	9707660	And as far as I know, doing pretty well with, I can't imagine those games are very expensive
9707660	9711040	to make because they've all been ports of other stuff.
9711040	9714860	So it can't be like that expensive for them to do.
9714860	9717620	So I would think they're doing pretty well with that.
9717620	9722640	So could Konami and Capcom be successful with a similar deal?
9722640	9729400	I would think so, especially, you know, just straight up ports of some of the NES classics.
9729400	9734860	Like I don't know, Gradius, Contra, I think a lot of people would end up buying iOS ports
9734860	9739460	of those, even if they're not even that good, because I still think, like how can you fucking
9739460	9741400	play Contra without a controller?
9741400	9747080	I don't know, but if somebody would spend the 99 cents to try and find out, it still
9747080	9751560	makes Konami a lot of money at the end of the day.
9751560	9756960	I don't see what there is to lose in those avenues, but that doesn't necessarily mean
9756960	9758800	they're going to explore it.
9758800	9763700	But I would think with Square Enix going down that path, maybe they'll follow.
9763700	9769700	But as far as all the Mega Man games on PC, I don't know about that one.
9769700	9770700	That might be a bit of a stretch.
9770700	9774620	There was a Mega Man game on PC years ago, though.
9774620	9776740	It had nothing to do with the rest of the Mega Man games.
9776740	9781180	It was like, it was like three bosses and a couple Wileys Castle.
9781180	9782180	I remember it.
9782180	9783500	It was like an old PC game.
9783500	9784860	You could play it in like CGA mode.
9784860	9785860	Oh, God.
9785860	9786860	Yeah.
9786860	9787860	Yeah.
9787920	9788920	It just kind of disappeared.
9788920	9789920	I bought that.
9789920	9790920	I did, too.
9790920	9791920	It was pretty awesome.
9791920	9792920	It ran like shit on my old computer.
9792920	9793920	That is true.
9793920	9794920	I can confirm it.
9794920	9796760	Maybe with a built-in DOS box.
9796760	9799100	That is a perfect candidate for GOG.
9799100	9801080	But would Capcom ever get involved in a site like that?
9801080	9802080	I don't know.
9802080	9803080	I don't know.
9803080	9805600	Yeah, I agree with you wholeheartedly.
9805600	9810680	I'm no programmer by any means, no.
9810680	9819220	Between me and everyone else on the bug community, probably Black Wolf knows probably the most
9819220	9821340	from what I can tell.
9821340	9828380	But even with that being said, I don't see re-releasing stuff on PC would be all that
9828380	9829380	hard.
9829380	9840500	And now that Council Lists can't play my previously purchased downloadable content, if the real
9841320	9847960	releases were available on Steam, I would buy that stuff up in Heartbeat.
9847960	9849200	You know me.
9849200	9852120	I buy games left and right.
9852120	9853120	Right.
9853120	9856120	Well, I think a lot of us do when it comes to Steam.
9856120	9862660	But anyway, again, as much as I don't think the entire Capcom, Mega Man, all eight games
9862660	9865840	are going to come out for PC any time soon, or really ten, I guess, ten games are going
9865840	9868520	to come out for PC any time soon.
9868520	9873580	Remember, DuckTales HD was a thing, and a lot of people really liked it.
9873580	9876140	And it did pretty good.
9876140	9882020	Maybe that is the ray of hope that we need as far as some of these retro titles go.
9882020	9884380	Just remember to buy this stuff if you like it.
9884380	9887860	Don't frickin' pirate it and all that stuff, and that's going to send a message that we
9887860	9888860	want more of it.
9888860	9889860	So, all right.
9889860	9891860	Well, RageNator, thanks for the call.
9891860	9892860	And my fingers are crossed.
9892860	9895180	I know you're a Steam fan and would like to see some of these classics on Steam.
9895180	9896180	I hope it happens.
9896180	9897180	Oh, definitely.
9897840	9898840	Well, have a good one.
9898840	9899840	All right?
9899840	9900840	You, too.
9900840	9901840	Feel better.
9901840	9902840	All right.
9902840	9903840	Thanks.
9903840	9904840	All right.
9904840	9905840	Bye.
9905840	9906840	TigerClanChat, Mega Man PC came out in 1990.
9906840	9907840	Let's see.
9907840	9911080	BlackWolf in chat says, I'm not a programmer, but I don't think making this old code not
9911080	9915240	made for current hardware, work on current hardware shouldn't be hard.
9915240	9916640	Newsflash, it's not easy.
9916640	9922560	Well, isn't it interesting that somebody put out an NES emulator on the iOS marketplace?
9922560	9926600	That was one of the stories we read last week, and it got taken down swiftly.
9927020	9932620	So, you know, it kind of depends on what level of a port they want to do.
9932620	9933620	Okay.
9933620	9934620	An emulator?
9934620	9935620	Sure, it's going to take a little more.
9935620	9936620	No, no, no.
9936620	9941060	I'll go with Mega Man PC not being able to run on, you know, on current PCs.
9941060	9942060	How about...
9942060	9944860	1-877-GAMO-LR, username on Skype, orange launch radio.
9944860	9946860	What about Mega Man 9 and Mega Man 10?
9946860	9948500	No, why not?
9948500	9949500	Those are more modern.
9949500	9950500	Yeah.
9950500	9952860	It should be a little bit easier, the port over, I would think.
9952860	9953860	I would think.
9953860	9959440	And then, you know, something like DuckTales HD especially takes a lot, a lot of work,
9959440	9964000	and any time they're going to go back and actually change textures, you know, you're
9964000	9969200	talking about basically redoing the game in a new language, and so yeah, that's going
9969200	9970440	to take work.
9970440	9976480	So a lot more work than just the turning around of the other titles.
9976480	9982460	I think another example is that Final Fantasy VI iOS port, I think a lot of the flak that
9982460	9987340	game's getting and that port's getting is that it was obviously outsourced.
9987340	9991840	And so sometimes that's how companies make these things happen is that they do them on
9991840	9997040	the super cheap, that they don't have their usual teams working on them, they send them
9997040	10001240	to other companies, and in some cases, like Final Fantasy VI, kind of think you get what
10001240	10003320	you pay for a little bit, so.
10003320	10009020	But Final Fantasy VI also didn't have any prior, you know, I don't think it was ever
10009020	10014640	out on PSP, I don't think they redid it at all for DS or anything else that's modern,
10014640	10020240	they probably had to go back and basically take that engine they had built for iOS for
10020240	10023640	that Final Fantasy...
10023640	10028820	There was another, there was a Final Fantasy game that was only on iOS that is like in
10028820	10033780	five episodes or something and the first one's free, but that engine is clearly what five
10033780	10037520	and six are running in, so they just took those games and like remade them in that engine.
10037540	10039540	So, but anyway.
10039540	10047020	1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.
10047020	10048260	Call our show, dammit.
10048260	10051820	You know, I think this is an interesting, worthy comment here from chat.
10051820	10055540	Kaijuto says, I'm burned out on retro crap.
10055540	10057540	Let's get new and innovative.
10057540	10059540	Duh, Dragon Age.
10059540	10062700	I think there's a time and a place for retro crap.
10062700	10067420	And to this day, and you know I always harp on this whenever I get the opportunity to,
10067420	10074140	I think Game Room on Microsoft's Xbox 360 and PC died way before it should have.
10074140	10075140	Way before it should have.
10075140	10079640	And it's so irritating to then turn around and see them make a documentary on 2600, which
10079640	10082200	to be fair I haven't watched and I need to.
10082200	10083200	Maybe I'll do that tonight.
10083200	10084540	I still really need to watch that.
10084540	10089440	But it's like they had a chance to bring back Atari 2600 stuff and it was kind of cool and
10089440	10095080	then they let it go for like three months and they pulled the plug and it was very sad.
10095080	10096080	Anyway.
10096740	10098460	And yeah, Black Wolf says the documentary is good.
10098460	10099780	It's only a little over an hour.
10099780	10100900	Yeah, I know it's pretty short.
10100900	10103480	That's why I really need to make the time to watch it.
10103480	10105060	So I'll have to do that at some point.
10105060	10109020	I still have an Xbox Gold subscription so I should be able to get it on my 360.
10109020	10113020	I just have to hook up my 360 because I disconnected it when I moved some things around here in
10113020	10114020	the studio.
10114020	10115020	So.
10115020	10116020	Alright.
10118020	10122620	Last call for calls, 1877 game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
10122620	10123620	Oh, there it is.
10123620	10124620	We've got one more call coming in.
10124620	10125620	Let's get to it.
10126160	10127160	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
10127160	10128160	Who's this?
10128160	10129160	It's me.
10129160	10130160	We're only DJ Rama.
10130160	10131160	Hey, Rama.
10131160	10132160	I like that shirt.
10132160	10134160	Is that like a Ninja Turtle shirt you're wearing?
10134160	10135160	Even better.
10135160	10136720	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Android.
10136720	10138160	Oh, my God.
10138160	10139160	That's cute.
10139160	10140160	I like that.
10140160	10141160	What's up, buddy?
10141160	10142160	Yes.
10142160	10143160	I'm kind of pissed right now.
10143160	10144160	Why?
10144160	10150080	Nobody's calling in and it seems like if nobody calls in, then I call in and everyone loses
10150080	10151080	their mind.
10151080	10152080	So you know what?
10152080	10154960	I'm here to fill in the gap, keep things going till there's no dead air.
10155500	10156500	So I'm here to help you all out.
10156500	10157500	I'm a player five.
10157500	10158500	Well, gee, thank you.
10158500	10159500	I mean, we couldn't have talked.
10159500	10160500	No.
10160500	10164780	We can always talk amongst ourselves, but I appreciate you calling, Rama.
10164780	10167580	It's always more fun with friends.
10167580	10168580	And you know what?
10168580	10173460	I know some people listen to this show and I know some people say, it's the same damn
10173460	10175220	people who call in every week.
10175220	10178980	And my response to that is, I would love to have you on the show too.
10178980	10180300	Just give us a call.
10180300	10181660	It's open for everybody.
10181660	10182660	Or email us.
10182960	10183960	And here's the thing.
10183960	10186520	There have been times I do not call in at all.
10186520	10190600	I let everybody else call in and see what's on their mind.
10190600	10194480	And it's like, how long does it take to pick up the phone?
10194480	10195480	This is what's bothering me.
10195480	10196480	This is what's up.
10196480	10197480	You know, that's all it is.
10197480	10198480	I know.
10198480	10199480	It's all right though.
10199480	10200480	It's probably a slower.
10200480	10203800	I haven't looked at the listener numbers for tonight, but I imagine with everybody going
10203800	10206160	back to work tomorrow, it's probably a little lower than usual anyway.
10206160	10207160	So no biggie.
10207160	10208160	Pretty much.
10208160	10209160	So what's on your mind though?
10210160	10212300	I picked up another video game over the weekend.
10212300	10218100	I picked up a couple of them to help with some awesome friends I have around this country.
10218100	10219100	What's that?
10219100	10221100	Let me go grab them real quick.
10221100	10225260	Because you probably won't believe one of the games that I got.
10225260	10230100	And the other one, you probably wouldn't be too surprised that I got in the first place.
10230100	10236220	As you all know, a particular remake just happened to come out a few weeks ago.
10236220	10237220	There it is.
10237280	10240280	That's 2.5 HD Remix on PS3.
10240280	10241280	Yeah, I got mine too.
10241280	10244600	I didn't pick that up, and I really need to, but the reason why I didn't pick it up is
10244600	10249040	because I didn't finish the frickin' first one, and I'm not going to play the second
10249040	10250480	one until I finish the first one.
10250480	10251480	Because by then it'll be on sale.
10251480	10253960	Do you know anything special about this copy though?
10253960	10254960	Is that a Japanese one?
10254960	10255960	No, it's a pin, Rob.
10255960	10257960	This is the limited edition with the Disney pin.
10257960	10258960	Oh!
10258960	10259960	Oh, holy shit.
10259960	10260960	Nice.
10260960	10264760	And I just lucked out on that because a friend of mine ordered two copies by accident because
10264760	10269940	when I went to go to Target to get mine, they said they had it in store, I go to pick
10269940	10274060	it up, I'm dealing with six people trying to ask them for the game, and they had no
10274060	10275060	more.
10275060	10277260	And when I went home, they still had it in stock, and I'm like, you know what, I'm not
10277260	10278260	dealing with it today.
10278260	10279260	Yep.
10279260	10280260	You know what happened to us?
10280260	10281260	What?
10281260	10282260	They lost our order.
10282260	10285740	No, they sent it to the old house even after we changed our address.
10285740	10286740	Oh no.
10286740	10287740	And so...
10287740	10291660	That actually happened to my copy of, remember when Activision was giving out free copies
10291660	10294100	of Guitar Hero Van Halen?
10294440	10295440	Yeah.
10295440	10296440	That happened to me!
10296440	10301560	Well, we ended up talking to the seller and everything, and we got our copy shipped to
10301560	10302560	us.
10302560	10303560	Nice.
10303560	10306080	And it arrived in time for opening presents.
10306080	10307080	That is awesome.
10307080	10314080	Now, the second game that I picked up, I like to call it Grand Theft Hacking, but from that
10314080	10318440	title, though, I think you know which game I'm talking about.
10318440	10321240	Grand Theft Hacking, I keep thinking Grand Theft Hacking.
10321240	10322240	Watch Dogs.
10322240	10323240	Oh, Watch Dogs.
10323380	10324380	Yeah, so the PlayStation 3.
10324380	10325380	Nice.
10325380	10326380	Of course, of course.
10326380	10329380	Hey, guess how much I paid for this?
10329380	10330380	$9.99.
10330380	10331380	Higher.
10331380	10332380	Uh, $19.99.
10332380	10335020	Crossed 25 with shipping.
10335020	10336020	That's not bad.
10336020	10337020	Not bad.
10337020	10340820	It seems that select targets were getting rid of it, and a friend of mine posted a picture
10340820	10345860	of the game, and I'm like, I will pay you money to send this to me, because I know for
10345860	10348720	a fact if I check my target, it'll be retail price.
10348720	10352020	And I checked, sure enough, this game was $59.
10352800	10358040	And after playing two hours of this game, I tell you what, I feel sorry for anyone who
10358040	10359800	paid retail price for this.
10359800	10360800	I do.
10360800	10367160	I'm gonna tell you, this is not the best time of year to get video games, because with everybody
10367160	10372280	that gets gift cards over the holiday season, they want to go to the stores and spend all
10372280	10377200	that money, so there's usually not a lot of sales early on this time of year.
10377200	10380640	You're gonna have to wait for probably like President's Day, things like that, where you're
10380660	10383700	gonna start to see some sales again to get people back in the stores.
10383700	10388420	But yeah, these first few weeks of January, really crappy time to get games, because they
10388420	10390820	know people want to burn those gift cards they got.
10390820	10398560	Well, see, if I'm buying anything, it won't be video games, it'll be technology to keep
10398560	10403420	the podcast and my crew going to conventions and doing other cool stuff.
10403420	10408020	That's right, which is a necessity for a convention-focused show like your guys's.
10408080	10411240	You know, we had a big convention here in Sacramento this weekend, and just none of
10411240	10413880	us got around to getting out, but SacAnime was this weekend.
10413880	10415880	Why did y'all not go to SacAnime?
10415880	10418480	I know people, I would have gotten y'all a hookup.
10418480	10419480	You know what's funny?
10419480	10423520	And I know people through the stuff I used to do with Rocky, I know people involved with
10423520	10426560	that stuff too, and it's just, I don't know why we don't go, well, I know why we don't
10426560	10430240	go to the summer one, because the summer one is always the same weekend as Dragon Con and
10430240	10433800	PAX, so it's like, sorry, SacAnime, there's just so much going on.
10433800	10435160	I don't know why we don't go to the winter one.
10435160	10436160	I don't have an excuse.
10436220	10438220	I really should have fucking gone, and I didn't.
10438220	10439220	I just, I don't know.
10439220	10444540	I honestly, honest to God, I just forgot until one of my Facebook friends, actually, several
10444540	10449220	of my Facebook friends were like, LOL, I was at SacAnime today, and I was like, aw, fuck.
10449220	10453140	Yeah, because one of my friends who's also a voice actor, he went, he posted a picture
10453140	10459700	of him and Peter Cullen, and I'm just like, oh, you bastard.
10459700	10460700	Yeah.
10460700	10464180	They're getting a lot of big names there right now, because again, this isn't a big time
10464200	10468320	of year for cons, but celebs still want to get paid, so they can get some really good
10468320	10469320	talent.
10469320	10473760	And what's interesting is there's also another convention going on this weekend, too, I have
10473760	10477920	friends that are staffing and working right now, Otacon Vegas.
10477920	10481680	Oh, I didn't know that was this weekend, interesting.
10481680	10482680	Wow.
10482680	10483680	All right.
10483680	10487760	Well, Rama, does Anime Jam Session come back from hiatus this week, or are you off on the
10487760	10488760	week?
10488760	10489760	No, we're still hibernating.
10489760	10497540	We're going to be back next week, live episode, January 13th, and we're doing what you missed
10497540	10502140	in the last two weeks in the fuckery that is anime and cosplay and other pop culture
10502140	10503140	stuff.
10503140	10504140	Well, good.
10504140	10506140	I look forward to hearing about SacAnime on that, since I didn't go.
10506140	10510020	Well, I think I'd be able to recruit someone to talk to us about SacAnime, but some of
10510020	10514860	the other news we've been picking up, oh, yeah, it'll be quite fun.
10514860	10519060	But Rama, Yaya Han went to SacAnime, come on.
10519060	10521160	I'm glad I didn't go.
10521160	10524520	You can't wait, so that means it's called Silicon.
10524520	10527880	Oh, you people, you people, all right.
10527880	10529960	Anime Jam Session, Tuesday nights here on VOG.
10529960	10530960	All right.
10530960	10531960	Take care, buddy.
10531960	10532960	Yeah, you stay fabulous, Rob.
10532960	10533960	Thank you.
10533960	10534960	I will.
10534960	10535960	Stay black.
10535960	10536960	I will.
10536960	10537960	I'll try.
10537960	10538960	All right.
10538960	10539960	Bye.
10539960	10540960	Bye.
10540960	10541960	There it is.
10541960	10542960	I'm going to go ahead and close up the Skype line.
10542960	10543960	Thank you guys so much for calling.
10543960	10546320	If you didn't get through and you wanted to, well, you should have called a little faster,
10546320	10547320	too.
10547320	10552860	You can always email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, but it is after midnight on the East Coast,
10552860	10555380	about time for us to wrap up here on the West Coast.
10555380	10559940	Thank you guys so much for tuning into the show and listening to our show.
10559940	10562700	We hope you enjoyed it, despite the fact it was a little more of a slow news week, but
10562700	10566540	you know, I think some of you like the tangents, so there was plenty of those for you this
10566540	10567540	week.
10567540	10571260	If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please help us spread the word,
10571260	10576300	because we don't have a big magazine or website or big radio network or something.
10576300	10578480	We don't have any backing from any of that.
10578480	10583520	We are a homegrown show in our 13th year, if you can believe it.
10583520	10585960	So word of mouth is all we got, word of mouth.
10585960	10592120	Tell a friend or five about the show, a five-star rating on a network like iTunes or Stitcher,
10592120	10595600	on which, by the way, we haven't gotten a five-star rating in a very long time on either
10595600	10599140	of those networks, so we would really appreciate it if you take a few seconds to, wherever
10599140	10602040	you learned about this show, go leave us a nice review.
10602040	10606120	It goes a long way in helping for visibility, and we really deeply appreciate each one we
10606120	10607120	get.
10607120	10611340	It is time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10611340	10612500	Dark Soccer, I'll start with you tonight.
10612500	10614340	Your final thought?
10614340	10616460	I want ice cream.
10616460	10617820	Yummy.
10617820	10624100	My final thought tonight is support indie broadcasting, and also, I've got a lot of
10624100	10628680	work to do, speaking of indie stuff, for VOG with loading the shows and all that stuff,
10628680	10633040	before I go to bed early, so I can get up for work early and go to work early, yay early
10633040	10635040	work, blah.
10635040	10636820	Loki, your final thought tonight?
10636820	10640300	I'll be damn lucky if I finish my VOG gym project by Sunday, but...
10640300	10641300	You can do it.
10641300	10642300	I will try.
10642300	10643540	At least get one stage playable.
10643540	10644540	At least get something.
10644540	10645540	At least get a little something.
10645540	10646540	I'll try.
10646540	10647540	All right, there it is, guys.
10647540	10651500	That is gonna do it, and as one of our emailers said tonight, we've got a lot of great stuff
10651500	10656060	in gaming to look forward to this year, lots of great games on the way, things we might
10656060	10659500	not even know about yet that we're gonna hear about at E3 and so forth, but it's gonna be
10659500	10662700	an exciting year, and thanks for choosing to start it off with us.
10662700	10663820	We really appreciate it.
10663820	10664820	Have a great week, everybody.
10664820	10665820	Happy gaming.
10665820	10669080	We'll be back to do it again next week when everybody's back at work, and hopefully we
10669080	10670300	have a little more news.
10670300	10672960	If not, Winona Ryder chat for three hours.
10672960	10674320	Good night, everybody.
