19000	22000	Tonight we're interviewing Eric, head of the MAGFest West Coast event Rockage.

27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	43000	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 584, January the 25th of 2015.
43000	52000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts right over there, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
52000	54000	I am trying to write fanfiction over here, Rob.
54000	57000	Are you writing fanfic during OLR?
57000	62000	Well, I've been writing it actually during Bobby's show, and I was finishing up a thought.
62000	66000	Well, I'm sure he's thrilled to hear that his show is inspiring.
66000	69000	Fanfic, but it's not Bobby Blackwell fanfic, is it?
69000	70000	No, it's Dragon Age.
70000	72000	That would be a little weird if it was Bobby Blackwell fanfic.
72000	74000	Is it Bobby Blackwell playing Dragon Age fanfic?
74000	75000	No.
75000	76000	Oh, okay.
76000	78000	No!
78000	80000	Stop making it weird!
81000	84000	No creepy closing pages now.
84000	88000	Now this isn't like, you know, some people, let's be real, DarkSakura.
88000	93000	Some people, when they hear fanfic, their mind instantly goes to slashfic or porn.
93000	95000	But are you writing porn?
95000	96000	No.
96000	98000	Okay, so you're writing things that are classy.
98000	100000	You have a little bit of a look on your face.
100000	102000	I'm actually very weirded out right now.
102000	103000	Oh, okay.
103000	104000	It's tastefully done.
104000	105000	Oh, hi, TechMasterLoki, how are you?
105000	108000	I have a mouthful of breadsticks.
108000	110000	Loki's writing his pizza fanfic over there.
110000	112000	He's shoving stuff from a box into his face.
112000	116000	Okay, in all seriousness, obviously we poke fun a little bit because that's what we do
116000	119000	here at OLR, but what inspires you to write fanfic?
119000	121000	Why do you do fanfic?
121000	124000	I mean, because there are people that look at it and go, that's weird.
124000	125000	So what would you say to them?
125000	130000	I more or less like to do it as a way to explore the characters.
130000	131000	It's more of an expansion.
131000	133000	Sometimes it's a way to get your headcanon out.
133000	138000	In this case, it's more or less just a nagging thought that I wanted to get out of my head.
138000	142000	So it's kind of like one of those things where it's like, you know, the BioWare games, the
142000	146000	BioWare universe is very good at, you can do so many different things with your characters,
146000	149000	but at the end of the day, and any of you that have played a BioWare game are familiar
149000	152000	with this, you have your little circle and you can pick from what, three to six different
152000	153000	options.
153000	156000	Well, what if the option you want isn't one of those things?
156000	158000	You know, maybe you want to do something else.
158000	160000	So this is kind of your way of getting that out of your system.
160000	162000	Kind of, kind of sort of.
162000	167000	It's basically, and I was telling you this earlier, but basically my premise for this
167000	171000	is, you know, when you start Dragon Age Inquisition, you can get one of eight characters pretty
171000	172000	much.
172000	173000	Right.
173000	176000	You know, four races, two genders.
176000	181000	In this case, I'm, you know, I did sort of a what if, you know, if one had, if all of
181000	186000	those characters had been there and only one of them made it to Inquisitor and the other
186000	189000	people still were there, you know, so it's sort of a what if.
189000	194000	I was just sort of thinking, you know, I have, I love alternate universe stories and
194000	198000	I love, you know, like time travel things.
198000	199000	What if we changed this in the past?
199000	200000	What if this happened?
200000	206000	And so it's sort of like my back to the future meets Dragon Age, except no DeLorean.
206000	208000	Where do people come together to share all this stuff?
208000	211000	I mean, obviously the internet, but what, what corner of the internet is this a forum?
211000	215000	Is this, I mean, I'm not saying you have to like give your exact location, but it's fine.
215000	220000	Um, I post on, um, archive of our own or as people see at AO three.
220000	222000	Um, some people use fanfiction.net.
222000	227000	I used to, I wrote Digimon fanfiction years ago, by the way.
227000	228000	Now that's creepy.
228000	229000	No, I'm kidding.
229000	230000	I'm kidding.
230000	231000	No.
231000	234000	Um, anyway, um, I, I dated a guy years and years and years ago.
234000	235000	I'm going to just, I'm going to keep it real.
235000	239000	So like, I don't think what you do is strange at all because I used to date a guy years
239000	246000	and years ago who wrote fanfiction or slash based on the television show popular, which
246000	247000	I don't know if you ever saw this was on the WB.
247000	249000	It was the guy who made Glee did this years ago.
249000	253000	He wrote like porny stories about the characters on that.
253000	254000	So you know what?
254000	256000	That kind of takes the cake in my opinion.
256000	257000	They exist.
257000	261000	I mean, there's people who do, I mean, I've just never been comfortable writing it.
261000	266000	I have written it before, never, never enjoyed it, you know, because I'm just not interested
266000	267000	in that kind of thing.
267000	270000	But it hasn't stopped me from reading other people's work.
270000	275000	Um, but no, um, there's people who, uh, post their stuff on Tumblr.
275000	278000	People posted on Facebook have whole communities over it.
278000	282000	And for me, I'm writing more or less just for myself, but I am posting it.
282000	285000	So, I mean, if anyone wants to read it, I, I'll link it to you.
285000	286000	I don't care.
286000	287000	Okay.
287000	289000	Um, I'm going to check in with tech master Loki here in a minute, but I want to check
289000	294000	in with our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live at the voice of geeks
294000	298000	network, vognetwork.com every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern,
298000	302000	right after the Bobby black Wolf show and Bobby black will starting us off saying dark
302000	304000	soccer thinks I'm creepy frown.
304000	306000	Uh, SSU 100.
306000	308000	Matt says in my Bobby black will fanfiction.
308000	310000	He knows and likes watching hockey.
310000	311000	There you go.
311000	313000	You can change things from what, uh, what they do there.
313000	314000	Uh, let's see.
314000	317000	A fifth dream says I want to romance Varick.
317000	320000	So I am assuming Varick is not to accept.
320000	321000	I do like Bianca.
322000	324000	So Varick is not a romanceable option in the game, right?
324000	327000	So this is a way for people to kind of get that out of their head.
327000	330000	He's, he's got his sights set on the one who got away.
330000	331000	I see.
331000	332000	Gotcha.
332000	333000	All right.
333000	334000	Well going over to tech master Loki.
334000	335000	How are you doing?
335000	336000	Loki.
336000	337000	Now I'm full.
337000	338000	Now you're full.
338000	339000	I'll give you enough time to eat some pizza there and get caught up for the show.
339000	340000	Right?
340000	341000	Yes.
341000	342000	Awesome.
342000	343000	How was, uh, how was your week off?
343000	345000	You got, y'all know I went to Seattle, but what'd you guys do with your a night off?
345000	349000	I had to go with the kids to my mother-in-law's house.
350000	352000	You sound so thrilled about this.
352000	354000	Yeah, it was, it was thrilling.
354000	355000	All right.
355000	359000	Did you get a chance to play any games or work on your own game or anything with the extra time?
359000	360000	No, I did that this week.
360000	362000	I wasted a lot of time working on my game this week.
362000	368000	Um, and I say wasted because I ended up working on trying to convert some scripts from JavaScript to C sharp.
368000	375000	And then I realized once I got about eight hours in, I was like, wow, there's a really easy way to do what I wanted to do without having to convert all this stuff.
375000	378000	So I just like threw it all away and I'm like, yep, that works.
378000	381000	It's like, dammit, if I had only realized this eight hours ago.
381000	385000	So yeah, that's, that was my weekend.
385000	386000	Bummer.
386000	391000	So, um, I know you're, you're not the type that writes fan fiction online, but you know, Dara Sagar was talking about big forums.
391000	400000	You've participated in some big forums as well, but things that have to do more with, I would imagine, uh, uh, like Grand Theft Auto hacking was one, right?
400000	401000	Didn't you used to?
401000	407000	A long time ago I used to do stuff with, was it Seven Sins and stuff, but now I just, it's, I can't keep up with it.
407000	415000	And you know, I don't really want to mess with it on, you know, Xbox now, like Grand Theft Auto five people like hack online and stuff.
415000	417000	And it's not as fun.
417000	428000	It's the problem is because five and even like some of the expansions for four weren't exactly the same, like five, there's not really structured game, like multiplayer modes, I guess.
428000	431000	It's kind of just, eh, we'll wander around and do stuff.
431000	438000	And you know, you may join up a mode or something like that with someone else, but it's not like, okay, I'm going to go into death match.
438000	440000	I'm only going to play death match, that type of stuff.
440000	441000	Or I'm only going to do races.
441000	443000	I kind of like that.
443000	450000	Or I wish there was, you know, both, you can do structured stuff and have not structured stuff, but that's kind of what I used to play.
450000	452000	And so now I don't really play a lot of that.
452000	461000	I think forums in general are a little bit of like a dying thing online a little bit because like, you know, we have forums over at vognetwork.com, but they're, they're a little tumbleweedy.
461000	468000	I mean, some of the shows kind of post their weekly updates, which is really good to read, but you don't have like the abundance of conversation like you might see on some other things.
468000	480000	And, you know, to be fair with, in the age of Facebook groups and Twitter and so forth, you know, a lot of, I think things have shifted to that where those sites have become the things that you check, you know, five times an hour.
480000	488000	I think a lot of people have, have moved a lot of their things into that, unless it's something like really, really focused, like maybe what, you know, Jamie's talking about.
488000	493000	I'm sure with these fanfic things as well, uh, you probably don't have room on Facebook for pages and pages.
493000	497000	Yeah, usually like if I read anything, I don't really participate in forums that much anymore.
497000	500000	It's more of like, you know, I'll read, I'll read everything.
500000	509000	I'll read even sites that, you know, I know are garbage, except for Polygon, I don't read that anymore, but I'll read like, I'll still browse Kotaku every now and then.
509000	513000	Just for the hell of it. And sometimes I'll browse, you know, NeoGaf.
513000	519000	NeoGaf's a forum, sure, but NeoGaf's, NeoGaf's kind of its own little monster. I don't really consider that like a forum like others.
519000	534000	Well, there's some things, some things are, it's not necessarily, yeah, I mean, sometimes it's like garbage, but sometimes it's just, you know, like they have, um, you know, kind of an indie game, you know, people that are working on indie games, posts that kind of sometimes, you know, regurgitates back to the top again.
534000	543000	It's all, see, like people are working on that kind of thing or, you know, I'll just like, sometimes I'll have like early shots of different games or like impressions and stuff.
543000	547000	So usually that's what that's for. But, you know, um, occasionally I'll go back to Seven Sins.
547000	563000	Um, usually for, not so much Grand Theft Auto hacking, but like I was going there, um, well actually Grand Theft Auto 5 related, I was trying to find a way to hack the money in single player because I don't want to, like I'm trying to wait for my money
563000	570000	that's supposed to come when it, because I preordered the game digitally and it still hasn't deposited into my game. I think it happens at a certain point in the game.
570000	577000	Um, and I haven't gotten to that point yet. And so I was like, well, is there a way like kind of cheat just to get more money?
577000	584000	Because I'm already 100% of this thing on Xbox 360 and I don't really want to grind at it to get more money and stuff on the PlayStation 4.
584000	595000	I just want to kind of wipe through it really fast so I can get to, you know, the end game stuff or, you know, the Chiliad Mystery stuff, which I don't even know if there's actually anything to that.
595000	598000	Um, I don't know.
598000	610000	Well, let me read some comments from our chat room. We were talking about forums because since I mentioned the VoG forums and that not a lot of people are using that stuff, I'm noticing in chat here, uh, let's see, we got Tiger Claw saying, we need to post more in the VoG forum.
610000	616000	And, uh, I usually post stuff in the VoG forum and SSG100Matt says, I posted a game completion challenge in the VoG forum.
616000	623000	Hey, by all means, if you guys want to make the VoG forums a thing, I will join you. I'm happy to participate in some longer discussions on there. I think that'd be great.
623000	625000	Don't let me discourage, please don't let me discourage you.
625000	633000	This is pretty tumble weenie that, uh, you know, out of my sheer laziness, I still haven't disabled yet. The Minecraft server.
633000	638000	Oh, there you go. You can Renaissance all these things in 2015.
638000	650000	All right. I don't even know. Well, um, I'm going to move on here from the intros. Uh, we'll get to our gaming weeks a little later, but in just under 15 minutes, we're going to be talking to Eric, who is the head of Rockage San Jose.
650000	660000	We're going to be talking to him about this event, which is now what many are calling, cause this is an official magfest event. Now it's the, which happened this weekend on the East coast. This is now magfest West coast, essentially.
660000	678000	So this is really cool. Um, I've heard, I, I, we, I know we have listeners to the show who are like just getting back from magfest tonight. Music and games fest, you know, they do a lot of like indie music bands, like, you know, things like mini bosses, you know, the mini bosses, they're going to be at this Rockage, you know, Mega Rand, you know, Mega Rand, he was on the show. He's going to be there too at Rockage. So this is going to be awesome.
678000	690000	Uh, I'm hoping to check out the event myself. It's in two weeks. It's the weekend of the eighth. Um, so I'm hoping to get out there at least for a day myself because San Jose isn't too, too far away, but we'll be talking to Eric about that event.
690000	705000	And I'm sure we'll get some calls later from some listeners who are at magfest on the East coast this week. So we're going to be talking a lot about music and games tonight, but that is just fine by me because you know what? I love both things, music and games. I'm pretty sure you guys love both things as well.
705000	727000	So we'll be talking to him in about 15 minutes, but we were gone last week. Uh, we took the week off. I took a vacation with Alan. We went up to Seattle. I had a great time. I don't have a lot of like gaming things to report, except I did go to Gameworks, which if you've been to PAX prime, you know, Gameworks, cause it's right across the street from the convention center. And coincidentally I was staying in a hotel that was right near the convention center as well.
728000	742000	Uh, so we headed over to Gameworks and I did get my fill of playing some pop and music and DDRX and X2 and see, there was even still a Derby owner's club machine up in the corner. And I, I thought of dark Sakura and some of the obscene things she used to name her horses.
742000	744000	And you had Polteri.
744000	745000	I did.
745000	747000	You beat Polteri and made her sad.
747000	753000	Which kind of isn't funny in retrospect, but it's, it was, it was kind of one of those inside jokes that you had to be there.
753000	757000	I actually still have all my horses. I found magical sound.
757000	758000	Oh, that's good.
758000	759000	Who I finally retired. Remember?
759000	770000	Yes. So I should have picked it. I should have brought you back that one of those as a souvenir. I should have got a Derby owner's club horse and named it something offensive and said, Hey, this made me think of you, but Oh well, I didn't think of it.
771000	776000	All right. Anyway, uh, since we were gone last week, it's time to recap the news from last week.
776000	781000	And how do we recap news on this show? By playing a very important song like Holic in the background.
781000	784000	So it's time for last week's news set to Holic.
786000	796000	Last week, Nintendo did a big direct on January 14th that really dominated the week in the news where they announced that yes, the new 3DS will be coming to America.
796000	798000	I didn't know that would happen.
798000	804000	It's going to be coming on February 13th. The new 3DS will controversially not be coming with a charger.
804000	814000	Uh, but the new 3DS will only be released in the XL version in the States, which is also ruffling a lot of feathers for those people who really wanted those exchangeable face plates.
814000	816000	And the plates by their own rules.
816000	823000	Also announced Puzzle and Dragons Super Mario edition is coming to the West as a double pack with the original Puzzle and Dragons Z.
823000	827000	Uh, Nintendo also going to be making a new game in the Fire Emblem series.
827000	831000	Uh, Xenoblade Chronicles coming out in the US in April.
831000	837000	Uh, Mario Party 10 going to be coming out as well and it will have its own set of amiibo that come with that.
837000	845000	But if you already have a Mario amiibo that you're using with Super Smash Brothers, you're going to have to get another one if you want to have also save data with Mario Party 10.
845000	849000	Because guess what? Amiibos only hold save data for one game.
849000	852000	Good thing you can get all these characters in different poses.
853000	862000	Also, Rock Band DLC. There was new Rock Band DLC that released last week featuring Arctic Monkeys and Foo Fighters.
862000	868000	The first release since American Pie was quote unquote the last piece of Rock Band DLC.
868000	872000	But hopefully this means a resurgence for the series very soon.
872000	874000	So there it is, last week's news set to holla.
874000	880000	Seriously, one game that's like, that's so forward thinking of you Nintendo. Like, god damn.
880000	885000	Uh, yeah. I mean, I already told you, I'm over amiibo. I'm over it.
885000	890000	Like, I see people on Twitter that are chasing down all the different ones and, you know, good for them.
890000	896000	I am not one to knock how other people spend their money and if that is the thing you collect and you're happy about it.
896000	902000	Hey, I got a collection of PES dispensers that people think is a waste of money. You have your amiibo and you rock on.
902000	907000	But I think, I'm just, I'm kind of over it. Like, I just, the more and more, they're harder to find.
907000	914000	The ones that you really want and they only will do the data for one game and now they're really milking it with more.
914000	918000	It's just, I'm over it. I'm done with the amiibo thing. I have my three, that's enough.
918000	927000	So, so much for that theory that you'd be able to like, you know, train something on Smash Brothers and then go play like another game and have that amiibo be good at that game or something.
927000	928000	Mhm.
928000	930000	So, what's the point?
930000	936000	Let's see, VX JasonXV in our chat room saying, people are surprised that amiibo only holds one game worth of data.
936000	944000	Have you ever played an arcade game with a card system? Literally every NFC system uses one set of identifiers because there's no other way to do it.
944000	951000	I get that, but I sort of feel like amiibos were maybe misrepresented a little bit.
951000	956000	Like, and that may be true, I just, you know, or maybe I'm just an idiot, which is certainly possible.
956000	962000	But I really feel like I got the impression that your one amiibo was going to work in all these different games.
962000	969000	And they work in Mario Part 8 and Hyrule Warriors because all it's doing is it's unlocking something and that's it.
969000	977000	There's no data going back and forth. So I kind of get why it's different, but I feel like because Nintendo set it up that way when they first announced it where they're like,
977000	981000	this one amiibo will work in all these games, that that was the expectation we were given.
982000	996000	And I don't know, is it completely unrealistic to think that maybe you would have the option to have data on your GameCube or even be able to maybe transfer the data to the Wii U?
996000	998000	It's alright, it's essentially the same thing.
998000	1002000	Nah, it's just four of them duct taped together, right? No, but I'm thinking, everybody forgets this.
1002000	1010000	The Wii controller has data storage in it because you can put your Wii in your Wii controller and take it from place to place.
1011000	1014000	That's right. What would be stopping you from putting amiibo data in those things?
1014000	1016000	Oh, because they wouldn't be able to sell figures.
1016000	1022000	Yeah, exactly. I feel like there's a better way they can do it. I don't know. Anyway.
1022000	1032000	Or like, here's another thing you could do. Say for example you have your amiibo figures that stick on a base, which I really think that any of these figures that come out should be fully poseable and stuff.
1032000	1040000	But let's just say that you have this base that goes on there. Maybe sell a separate base for like two bucks or something that you could pop it on there.
1040000	1046000	Okay, this one's for Mario Kart, this one's for Smash Brothers, and then that way you use the same amiibo and you don't have to buy another one.
1046000	1051000	But of course then they'll be selling two dollars worth of something instead of twelve dollars.
1051000	1056000	AkumaJP in chat says, I buy amiibo only as figures. It's so well done.
1056000	1064000	You know what? That is as much as I do get. And I actually agree. They are very well made figures. I really like them.
1064000	1073000	I just hate the whole beanie baby, crazy, if you want a Wii Fit trainer, good luck. You're going to have to pull some weaves in a Walmart parking lot in order to be able to get them.
1073000	1084000	It's just, I can't with all that types of fighting. And the eBay scalpers and people jacking up the price, I just can't handle all that.
1084000	1092000	Like I get that I can get a good chunk of them by walking into Target. I just walked into Target yesterday, I saw Kirby, I saw Luigi, I saw a bunch of cool ones.
1092000	1099000	But, you know, I kind of want a Wii Fit trainer and I kind of want Mega Man and Pac Man and I know all these ones are going to be crazy hard to find.
1099000	1106000	So, eh, I don't know. But anyway, I'm not hating on those of you that enjoy it and collect them. I'm just saying I'm over it and these are some of the reasons why.
1107000	1112000	Let's see, looking at some other comments in chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
1112000	1119000	Which, by the way, when we get Eric on the show here in a little bit, if you want to ask questions about Rockage San Jose, we will be taking live questions from our chat room.
1119000	1122000	Again, that's over at live.vognetwork.com.
1122000	1129000	Physics major in our chat, I hope I said that right, says, I'm only getting one more amiibo and that's the last one I'm getting.
1130000	1133000	Yeah, but that's how they get you. Just one more, just one more hit.
1133000	1138000	And then they'll be like, oh, but we're releasing this figure that collectors everywhere are going to want to have.
1138000	1141000	Alright, well I wanted to talk about this. What do you guys think about the new 3DS?
1141000	1147000	Because I was lucky enough this week I got to actually play one from Japan.
1147000	1155000	You know, our buddy Shane here at Orange Lawns Radio actually imported one from Japan and I kind of gave him shit for it because I'm like, why did you spend all that money?
1155000	1160000	But he made a good case. Shane can understand enough Japanese to be able to play some of the games.
1160000	1165000	And he's like, I want to play Final Fantasy Explorers right now and I want to play Rhythm Heaven when it comes out.
1165000	1170000	And I'm like, alright, you know what, you make a good case. If that's how you want to spend the money, you can get the new 3DS.
1170000	1176000	I got this message from him at work, come over to my desk and see my new toy. Okay?
1176000	1179000	So you got to see one of these too. What did you think? What did you think of the new 3DS?
1179000	1184000	It was the other day. It was alright, I actually didn't play with it but I held it for a little bit.
1184000	1190000	It felt like a 3DS, just a little bit weird. The screen was a little weird.
1190000	1193000	It doesn't feel that different from an XL to me at all.
1193000	1195000	And I don't like the XLs that much.
1195000	1204000	I love the XL and so the screen size and everything is good with me and I will say my favorite thing about the new 3DS is that head tracking 3D, it does work pretty well.
1204000	1209000	And Shane even kept saying to me, why are you trying to break it? Because I kept tilting the 3DS.
1209000	1212000	But I was like, I just want to check it out, like how this head tracking thing works.
1212000	1224000	And it actually does work pretty well. So for those that don't know, it will actually kind of measure, like as you look to the left, it will kind of see that your head is moving to the left and it will shift the 3D appropriately and so forth.
1224000	1226000	This is the little fucker I've been playing.
1226000	1231000	That's a little Game Boy micro. Those things came and went real quick.
1231000	1232000	Yeah, they did.
1232000	1237000	Alright, anyway. But on the new 3DS, he let me play Final Fantasy Explorers.
1237000	1242000	So that was really cool to get a chance to finally play that, except it was all in Japanese so I had no idea what I was doing.
1242000	1247000	So Shane kept telling me like, okay, use the L and then you can press a button to do an attack.
1247000	1250000	So he's having to explain everything over my shoulder. I'm like, okay.
1250000	1256000	But I was using a little bit of that nub and that's what they added on the new 3DS.
1256000	1265000	There's a nub right above the buttons. It's a little nipple that you basically can go eeee and move the camera using the nub.
1265000	1270000	The best comparison is if you ever used an old school laptop. In fact, I think a lot of laptops still have these.
1270000	1272000	They all have the nubs in the middle to use the mouse.
1272000	1273000	Why?
1273000	1277000	That's what it is. That's what the new 3DS has for that second stick.
1277000	1284000	And when I was hearing about this and stuff, I was like, oh, it's going to be like a full, just a tiny little thing like the guy on the left.
1284000	1290000	No, it's like a nub like an old mouse on a laptop. So it was kind of, I did not like the feel of it at all.
1290000	1295000	But Shane really loves it, which is good because it was his money and he bought it. So he has to really love it.
1295000	1297000	He likes to fondle the nub?
1297000	1303000	He did me a favor by coming over and bringing me that. So I'm not going to make fun of him live on air.
1303000	1309000	So, uh, yeah, that's, uh, that was, um, that was kind of weird to me.
1309000	1320000	So the other thing with the new 3DS, and I'm trying to wrap this up because I want to move on to our call here in a minute, but with the new 3DS, I'm not totally convinced I need one.
1320000	1332000	Because from a hardware perspective, although the head tracking is very cool, um, it's not enough to convince me to give up my Zelda 3DS that I have right now and plop $200 on the new 3DS.
1333000	1342000	And my problem right now is that the games they've announced coming out for the new 3DS that you have to have a new 3DS for aren't really compelling right now.
1342000	1351000	Uh, Final Fantasy Explorers, you can play that on a regular 3DS. You just won't have that second controller for a camera. You have to use the D-pad or something, which, you know, I'll get used to it.
1351000	1353000	I didn't like using the nub anyway.
1353000	1354000	You can even use the touch screen.
1354000	1356000	Oh, can you? Oh.
1356000	1362000	Yeah, because that was the thing is I heard someone complain about that. They're like, well, a third of the touch screen can be used as that, so.
1362000	1365000	Well, that won't be so bad. That'll be cool.
1365000	1369000	So, uh, yeah, there's that.
1369000	1379000	And, uh, Xenoblade, of course, is coming out on the new 3DS, but I kind of already played that on the Wii. Do I really need that on the new 3DS? I don't think so.
1379000	1386000	So, eh, I'm kind of, I'm kind of, I'm not feeling it right now, but here's the thing, here's the thing.
1386000	1393000	Before you guys, because I know you Nintendo fanboys are passionate. I know you're going to write your hate mail to me right now. Hold on though, hold on.
1393000	1396000	Here's the thing, because I know this is what will happen.
1396000	1401000	E3 this year, they're going to announce that game that I have to have that's going to be on the new 3DS.
1401000	1409000	Be it a new 2D Metroid, or 2.5D Metroid, or a new F-Zero, or even hell, like a new Mario game that's really going on handheld.
1409000	1413000	There'll be something they're going to announce at E3, and I'm fully expecting that.
1413000	1419000	But what I'm hoping is that not only will they announce that game, but then there'll be, like, new colors and new, you know,
1419000	1427000	skews for the new 3DS that are even more interesting to me as well, because you know people went crazy about that Majora's Mask 3DS.
1427000	1431000	And we'll have a new story on that a little bit later about just how crazy things are getting with that.
1431000	1434000	Talking about the scarcity and the beady babies and all that.
1434000	1438000	So, final thought from either of you guys before we move on here?
1438000	1439000	I wouldn't buy it.
1439000	1441000	You wouldn't buy it? Why is that?
1441000	1447000	Because if I'm going to buy a 3DS, you know, I don't like the fact that they keep updating the hardware on it.
1447000	1454000	And it's going to get it to the point where you can't actually play certain games on it because it's only going to be so reported by the new hardware.
1454000	1458000	They did that with, like, the DSi and stuff. It's just, I don't want to mess with that.
1458000	1462000	I want it just to come out, be around for a while, and then that's it.
1462000	1469000	Then it just works instead of, you know, just, I don't know, having it where I have to constantly update my system.
1469000	1473000	And the fact that they're just so, you know, cocky enough about it.
1473000	1477000	They're like, well, that's why we didn't include a power, you know, supply there.
1477000	1482000	It's because you guys are just going to upgrade your old ones because it's new and you'll buy whatever we put out.
1482000	1484000	I mean, that's kind of an asshole move.
1484000	1488000	To be fair, though, you're not a really big handheld person right now, are you?
1488000	1491000	Didn't you get rid of your Vita, and do you even really play your 3DS right now?
1491000	1492000	I don't have a 3DS.
1492000	1495000	Oh, you had a Japanese one, you sold that too, right?
1495000	1498000	Yeah, I had a Japanese one, I sold that. I had an American one, I sold that.
1498000	1500000	So you don't even handheld game right now?
1500000	1502000	Uh, no, yeah.
1502000	1507000	So in the interest of putting your opinion in context, you don't really play handheld games right now?
1507000	1510000	Well, I like handheld games, it's just there's nothing I really want to play.
1510000	1516000	And there's nothing that's justifying on, you know, why I need to have that system.
1516000	1517000	Fair enough.
1517000	1519000	You put Minecraft on it.
1519000	1521000	That's all you need? You need Minecraft on it?
1521000	1526000	You don't know why. I almost bought Minecraft again on PlayStation 4, but I'm like, you know, what the hell am I doing?
1526000	1529000	Why would I buy it on PlayStation 4? I don't fucking play it on PC.
1529000	1533000	Alright. We're going to shift gears here quite a bit, because we're going to move on.
1533000	1538000	It is about 6.30, and this is the time that we say we're going to get Erik on the line here.
1538000	1542000	Erik is with the event Rockage 4.0.
1542000	1550000	Rockage is being presented by MAGFest, or Music and Games Fest, and it's going to take place from February 6th through the 8th.
1550000	1556000	That's just in two weeks in San Jose at the San Jose State University Student Union Ballroom.
1556000	1562000	And if you want to get more information on this event, you can check out rockagesj.com or magfest.org.
1562000	1567000	We're going to try to get Erik on the line right now. We're putting in his number and calling it up.
1567000	1575000	Now, I believe Erik is at MAGFest that's going on this weekend, so I'm hoping he's in a good cell area and we'll be able to talk to him okay.
1575000	1579000	So, we're getting him on the line right now. The joys of live radio.
1579000	1581000	Hey there, is this Erik?
1581000	1582000	Live radio. How you doing?
1582000	1583000	Hey, how you doing, Erik?
1583000	1586000	I'm your Wii Fit trainer for ya.
1586000	1590000	Oh, you must be listening to this show. You found an extra Wii Fit trainer for me?
1590000	1600000	Yeah, I found it backstage here at MAGFest where I guess I'm talking to from here in National Harbor, Maryland.
1600000	1604000	Oh my gosh. Well, I'm going to have to come to Rockage and pick up this Wii Fit trainer in person.
1604000	1607000	I'm going to be really disappointed if it's not there. I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.
1607000	1613000	How are you doing? You're at MAGFest East right now. How's that going?
1613000	1621000	MAGFest East. I think it's just called MAGFest. I don't know if they're going to go with MAGFest East or MAGFest Prime.
1621000	1627000	It's great and I'm exhausted. It's amazing. You guys should all come here at some point in your life.
1627000	1632000	We actually had a few listeners that headed out to that event this weekend. Some of them are just now getting home.
1632000	1639000	And Rama in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com is saying people are starting to run out because of the snowstorm. Is that true?
1640000	1647000	Apparently there's a blizzard coming and we're still going here. MAGFest goes until Monday night.
1647000	1652000	So we're going to have a party and some people are leaving now.
1652000	1657000	The party ain't over until y'all say it's over. That's how it was. Snow be damned, right?
1657000	1661000	Right. No BlizzRaga 3 coming. It doesn't matter yet.
1662000	1670000	Well stay safe out there my friend. We need you to get back here in a timely manner so that we know Rockage is going to go off without a hitch in February.
1670000	1675000	Okay, so for those that don't know or haven't heard of this event, what is Rockage?
1675000	1687000	It's a three day celebration of indie music and retro gaming. So it's basically a music and gaming festival in San Jose at San Jose State University.
1687000	1695000	Awesome. And it's taking place of course in two weeks, February 6th through the 8th. And people can get their tickets online right now, right?
1695000	1701000	Yep, you can get them online. We have three day passes for sale. You can also get one day passes at the door.
1701000	1706000	And we still have plenty of tickets left and we have 42 bands playing. 42!
1706000	1721000	Oh my gosh! How do you go about finding 42 bands to play at your festival? That's got to be a crazy amount of organization. I mean, it takes a lot of work for me to get one guest on OLR. How do you have 42 people?
1722000	1732000	I don't know. People figure it out. We've done this for four years. This is our fourth Rockage. And now that MagFest is involved, many other people and bands are finding out about it.
1732000	1745000	MagFest, they run Rockage now. When it used to just be me doing it, taking 11 months to plan, now it's a little bit easier with MagFest and their awesome help.
1745000	1756000	Now this is kind of a new thing. Even though this is the fourth year of your event, Rockage 4.0, this MagFest relationship I believe is newer for you guys, right? How did that all come to be?
1757000	1769000	Well, it's a long story, but the short story is that we've been buddies for a while and they want to expand to the West Coast.
1769000	1780000	And they came to Rockage last year and helped me out. They all volunteered. And they loved it and they think it's got the same spirit that MagFest does.
1780000	1786000	MagFest is a music and gaming festival, if you guys don't know about that. I'm pretty sure that's pretty well known now, though.
1786000	1800000	But yeah, they just like the idea of it and they see Rockage as an opportunity just to get their feet wet on the West Coast and eventually they're looking to start MagWest, which will be kind of a MagFest on the West Coast.
1801000	1810000	Ah ha, so maybe me calling that MagFest East wasn't such a bad thing if that's where this is going. Let's see, the plot thickens.
1810000	1820000	So okay, so MagFest relationship aside, this is your fourth year of doing this event. So what are some ways that things have changed from year to year with your event?
1820000	1831000	So many things. We started off at a place called the San Jose Women's Club, so now we've got a bigger venue now.
1831000	1843000	And we're at San Jose State University, so we're working with the college now. And again, MagFest's involvement means we can have bigger bands and bigger stage and all that stuff.
1843000	1852000	And we have three stages, which is new to the whole event. We usually just have one. So we've expanded on that. We have a bunch of panels now, too.
1852000	1859000	And we actually have some composers coming from video game music as well, like Dale North, who's going to be hanging out and doing a panel.
1859000	1869000	Yeah, so we've just expanded in every nerdy direction. We have a tabletop area now this year, too, and a karaoke lounge and things like that.
1869000	1871000	Karaoke? Uh oh.
1872000	1879000	Uh oh, karaoke. I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble if that's a thing. That sounds awesome. I'm looking forward to coming down there.
1879000	1884000	I'm going to try to get down there at least for the day on Saturday and check that out, so I'm definitely looking forward to that to myself.
1884000	1889000	What are some of the bands I'm going to be seeing if I come down there for a day?
1889000	1896000	Well, some of the bands that are playing at MagFest that I just saw the last couple days that are also playing Rockage.
1896000	1905000	One of the ones I should mention is a band called Bit Brigade. Are you familiar with that band and their whole thing? Their speedrunning game?
1905000	1908000	No, I have to admit I haven't heard of this.
1908000	1915000	Alright, well, there's this band Bit Brigade. They're from Athens, Georgia, and they're a lead gamer.
1915000	1924000	Instead of having a lead singer, they have a lead gamer. And Noah McCarthy is an amazing speedrunner, and he speedruns classic Nintendo games.
1924000	1929000	And the rest of the band plays the exact soundtrack while he's speedrunning the game.
1929000	1937000	So every time he goes into a new stage or a new area and the music changes, they change the music right there and then.
1937000	1943000	It can beat games like Zelda and Metroid and Castlevania and Contra really fast.
1943000	1945000	That sounds awesome.
1946000	1954000	They used to do something like that at the Video Games Live concert. I'm sure you've seen this at some point. They would do something like that.
1954000	1960000	But this sounds like that kind of turned up to 11. Something like that?
1960000	1965000	I watched him do Metroid last night. Yeah, it's great. Really, it's amazing. It's almost like performance art.
1965000	1970000	I watched them play Metroid last night. It'd be 10 minutes, and anything could happen.
1970000	1975000	And so he couldn't even have enough missiles to fight Mother Brain. We had to keep killing Metroid at the end.
1975000	1982000	And everyone was like getting squirmy and stuff, but finally he got his missiles replenished, and he took out Mother Brain.
1982000	1987000	But anything that he could have died, he could have fallen in the lava and got stuck or glitched out.
1987000	1991000	So it's kind of exciting to see him fighting with that.
1992000	1995000	You never know what's going to happen. That's why I like that.
1998000	2003000	Bit Brigade will be doing Metroid on Saturday night at Rockage, and they'll be doing Zelda on Friday night.
2003000	2006000	Oh my gosh, that's going to be a trip to see. I can't wait.
2006000	2011000	That sounds awesome. And actually, Bit Brigade's getting a lot of love in our chat room right now.
2011000	2015000	BlackWolf pointing out the Bit Brigade's from his area, and TigerClaw's saying,
2015000	2020000	I've seen Bit Brigade performing at PAX last year on the livestream. They played Legend of Zelda music.
2020000	2025000	So it sounds like we're going to get a version of that at Rockage. That'll be awesome. But live and in person.
2025000	2034000	And some folks in chat kind of joking that at Rockage, there's not going to be a chance that we'll get snowed out in San Jose.
2034000	2039000	So if you're worried about that, that will not happen at Rockage. No snowing out there. That's good.
2039000	2047000	Correct, yes. But we will be livestreaming Rockage as well. We'll tweet out the link or something.
2047000	2058000	So if those of you that can't make it all the way to San Jose, you'll be able to see that Zelda and Metroid speedrun each night by Bit Brigade, as well as the other 41 bands performing.
2058000	2063000	That is awesome. So you are going to stream this all live. Where should folks be following you on Twitter and online?
2063000	2070000	Especially since we do have a worldwide audience, and I'm sure there's a lot of people that aren't going to be able to get to San Jose on two weeks notice. How can they follow you online?
2070000	2085000	On Twitter, it's just RockageSJ for San Jose. So RockageSJ. It's Rock with an A-G-E and an S-J. That's our Twitter. Or Facebook, it's just RockageSJ as well. Those are two good spots.
2086000	2091000	Awesome. Well, speaking of our chat room, we want to invite some of our live listeners and participants to submit some questions.
2091000	2098000	If you guys have anything you want to know about Rockage or any questions in general for Eric, ask them in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
2098000	2106000	And we have a listener, Cecilla. I hope I'm saying this correct. I'm so sorry. Sometimes some of these names I don't see very often. I tend to butcher, so I'm sorry.
2106000	2114000	Says, hey Eric, this is Cecilla from Pasadena. What should I expect as a newcomer to Rockage? That's a good question.
2116000	2126000	Lots of music. Potentially lots of amazing burritos in San Jose if you haven't been to San Jose before. There's some amazing food around the area.
2126000	2134000	And yeah, a lot of retro games as well. For newcomers of Rockage, that's what you should expect.
2134000	2140000	Awesome. Come for the games and the music. Stay for the burritos. I love it.
2140000	2143000	I think we go hand in hand, yes.
2143000	2152000	Going to our chat room, we have another live listener here. LockedOnGamer asked this question. I'm not sure if this is something you can really answer. Maybe a little taste here.
2152000	2158000	Any chance MagFest could come to Canada? I don't know if you can speak on MagFest's behalf.
2159000	2170000	Yeah, I don't know if I have the authority to approve that hearing right there now, but I'd love to try it, but I will bring it up to the gang. How about that?
2170000	2181000	Thanks for asking that question though, because that is another thought that we have. What do you guys have going on in Canada? Do you guys have any stuff? There's no PAX in Canada yet, correct?
2181000	2183000	Not yet. Not that I'm aware of.
2184000	2188000	There's got to be some stuff, some conventions and festivals.
2188000	2198000	I know a lot of folks from Vancouver dipped down for PAX Prime, because that's not that far for them, but that's about the only thing I can think of. I can't think of a big, big gaming event.
2198000	2208000	I know of a show, Video Game Realness, out in Toronto, and they cover a few things, but I can't think of any huge, huge expos I know of that I've heard in Toronto.
2208000	2217000	At least not yet. I'm sure there's some Toronto listener that's screaming their head off at me right now. I can barely keep tabs on things happening in my neighborhood. I'm so sorry.
2217000	2230000	Let's see. Going to some other questions here in chat. C. Cilla with another good question here. C. Cilla from Pasadena says, what kind of panels should I expect at Rockage?
2231000	2244000	That's a good question. We have a couple of cool panels that are unique to Rockage. The Earthbound USA panel I recommend. Jeff Benson's making an Earthbound documentary.
2244000	2255000	He's going to be showing a trailer and doing a Q&A. That movie's going to come out next year, I believe. If you only see one panel, that's the one to see.
2255000	2272000	We also have a megathread panel. Shouts out to everyone listening from the megathread. That is the band Narboots, their own personal panel, which I don't even know. Last time they ended up feeding everyone narchos, which is an interesting concoction of itself.
2272000	2280000	So yeah, lots of music and gaming panels at Rockage. Earthbound USA would be the one to see, I think, if you only see one.
2280000	2290000	Awesome. Well, Eric, I am looking forward to the event and I'm definitely going to dip down there and check it out for a day. Sadly, I can't stay the whole time because I've got to get back here and do another episode of OLR.
2290000	2292000	That's right, Sunday.
2292000	2300000	You've got me very, very interested in a lot of the stuff going on. I'll try to check out at least the livestream on Sunday, if nothing else, as I'm sure a lot of our listeners will be doing.
2300000	2304000	So one more time, how can folks get tickets to Rockage if they want to check it out?
2305000	2311000	Okay, well, our website is rockagesj.com and we are also on Twitter at rockagesj.
2311000	2314000	And we're also on Facebook at rockagesj.
2314000	2320000	Also through the magfest.org website. We're in the upper right hand corner, I believe.
2320000	2326000	And again, it's just 42 bands and this is something that I put together just because I love music and video games.
2327000	2335000	And I think that it's something that people that even have just an interest in one or the other, they'll find that they collide on the dance floor.
2335000	2341000	So music and video games coexisting in a rock setting. Perfect.
2341000	2342000	I love it.
2342000	2348000	Thanks for having me on the show and I hope everyone does end up coming to Rockage because we have plenty of burritos for everyone.
2348000	2352000	Well, if you're promising burritos, I have to accept.
2352000	2356000	Hey, real quick, I got a couple other just quick, quick questions before I let you go because one more came in here in chat.
2356000	2361000	I really like this question from Continuum Kingdom wants to know in our chat, how many people are you expecting at this event?
2361000	2363000	How many people are attending?
2363000	2370000	Well, last year Rockage had around 1,000, but with the Magfest involvement, we're looking to definitely bring more folks.
2370000	2376000	Just to compare, Magfest right now just hit 18,000 people in Maryland, where I am right now.
2376000	2379000	Rockage is still a relatively newer event.
2379000	2382000	And so we're looking at anywhere between 1,500 and 2,000 people.
2382000	2386000	That is nothing to blink at. That's a lot, a lot of people. That's amazing.
2386000	2390000	Especially just for the fourth year of the event, that's a great pull.
2390000	2394000	And one more question for you because we always ask our guests on the show this question.
2394000	2398000	I know you're busy being at Magfest right now, but I also know you're a gamer at heart.
2398000	2401000	I mean, you do this because you love music and you love video games.
2401000	2404000	What video games are you playing right now?
2404000	2411000	I'm terribly addicted to Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn. The new version of it is 2.0.
2411000	2419000	I play on the Malboro server and the beginning of Rockage started as a link shell on Final Fantasy XI.
2419000	2424000	That was just a link shell and it became an idea that eventually we could have it in real life.
2424000	2427000	And then we started the festival known as Rockage now.
2427000	2432000	So there you go. There's your roots of Rockage and I'm playing Final Fantasy XIV now.
2432000	2435000	And I'm severely addicted.
2435000	2439000	Eric, you have a lot in common with the hosts of OLR.
2439000	2444000	Loki and I spent a lot of late nights, and Jamie, a lot of late nights on Final Fantasy XI.
2444000	2453000	And right now enjoying the Before the Fall patch on Midgarcimer, unfortunately, is the server I'm on.
2453000	2456000	But this patch is all about our server apparently.
2457000	2462000	Yep, I went to FanFest a couple months back. I don't know if you guys got to go to that.
2462000	2465000	Yes, I was there. I was there.
2465000	2469000	It was so much fun. I hope they do it every year.
2469000	2477000	And those of you that haven't given the 2.0 version of Final Fantasy XIV a try, it's a lot better than 1.0.
2477000	2480000	That's all I'll say.
2480000	2485000	So any chance we can see the primals at Rockage 5.0?
2485000	2487000	Oh, I wish. I'll have Soken.
2487000	2489000	All right. Sounds good.
2489000	2493000	All right, Eric. I'm going to let you get back to MagFest. Thanks for taking some time out to talk to us.
2493000	2495000	Get back to the fun going on out there in Maryland.
2495000	2498000	Thanks so much for having me. See you guys around.
2498000	2500000	All right, take care. See you in a couple weeks. Bye.
2500000	2501000	Bye.
2501000	2503000	All right, that was so awesome. Thank you, Eric, for joining.
2503000	2506000	Who knew that Eric was a fellow Final Fantasy XIV addict?
2506000	2513000	I feel redeemed in some ways from my own addiction to Final Fantasy XIV by hearing that I'm not alone.
2513000	2520000	That, you know, you can put together a ravingly successful, attended by possibly up to 2,000 people this year,
2520000	2523000	a festival about music and games, and still be addicted to Final Fantasy XIV.
2523000	2528000	Again, if you want to check that out, RockageSJ is their name most places.
2528000	2533000	You want to check them out on Twitter, RockageSJ.com, which I think links to their Tumblr, which is RockageSJ.
2533000	2539000	And yes, I'm going to try and get out there to the event myself next week, or sorry, two weeks, and check that out.
2539000	2545000	So, awesome. Thank you again, Eric, for your time, and best of luck with the event this week.
2545000	2550000	All right, we're going to move on for now into trying to cover some of the gaming news that happened this past week with you guys.
2550000	2554000	Of course, don't go anywhere. If you want to continue to chat with us about the week's news,
2554000	2559000	and we will be taking your calls later on in the show over at 1-877-GAME-OLR,
2559000	2567000	or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word if you want to get us added before we get to the Skype calls later on in the show in about an hour and a half.
2567000	2574000	But we're going to get through our gaming weeks and what is happening around the world in gaming news.
2576000	2582000	To register participation for this week's episode of OrangeLoungeRadio at VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase CAKE.
2582000	2587000	Let's start off with our gaming weeks, though, real quick and talk about the games that we have been playing this week. DarkSakura.
2588000	2598000	As I was leaving, I was downloading the demo for Monster Hunter 4 on DS. I've been playing a little Final Fantasy XIV.
2598000	2606000	I am also on my second playthrough of Dragon Age Inquisition, and now there are mods I have been happily modding my game.
2606000	2619000	I've also been playing The Legend of Zelda on the Game Boy Micro. I actually fished out the Micro because I was showing it to people at work, because they had never seen one.
2619000	2625000	Well, the Micros kind of came and went. If you didn't buy one in the six months they were out, it was gone.
2625000	2628000	And you remember how many E3s I took that thing with me, too.
2628000	2633000	So Nintendo has released a console with an interchangeable faceplate in the US before.
2633000	2634000	Yes, it has.
2634000	2635000	Yes, they have.
2635000	2636000	I forgot about that.
2636000	2649000	But I've been playing a little bit of The Legend of Zelda on that one, and really just writing fan fiction since I got the writing bug. So that's it.
2649000	2651000	Alrighty.
2651000	2653000	And bejeweled.
2653000	2658000	Of course. Can't do anything without a little bit of bejeweled here and there. Loki.
2659000	2668000	I actually, I played games this week, so I finally Platinum Lego Marvel Super Heroes on PlayStation 4, so I don't play that anymore.
2668000	2669000	Congrats!
2669000	2671000	Thank God, because that game is so fucking buggy.
2671000	2681000	Again, I have the most respect for, you know, Traveler Tales, but holy crap is that game really, like that is broken buggy in a lot of spots.
2681000	2683000	But you were determined to Platinum it, too.
2683000	2695000	Oh yeah, I got it. But like that, like it was just, it's bad. Like I've been noticing, because Josh plays that game a lot, and I'll sit there and watch, I'm like holy crap, they just like didn't give a shit on a lot of this stuff.
2695000	2699000	And just said, ah fuck it, we're just throwing it together and getting it out the door.
2699000	2704000	It's pretty bad in some spots, but I finally finished it, so that's great.
2704000	2720000	Then the other thing I wanted to check out was, you know, because as much as I hate the most recent Saints Row games, and I say hate in the most loving way, because I actually do like the series Saints Row, I just think it's gone in a direction that's, I don't know how they're going to recover from it.
2720000	2734000	I mean, they do okay, but it's certainly not what the game used to be, you know, about like an ultra-violent, you know, gang that just like enacts revenge on people in the most violent ways.
2734000	2741000	Now it's like some superhero crazy alien bullshit, I don't know what kind of game. It's still fun.
2741000	2751000	So I played God out of Hell, and kind of disappointed once again, it's kind of like how Saints Row 4 was, where Saints Row 4 seemed to be kind of rushed.
2751000	2764000	It's just very haphazard, it's very like kind of, just like we didn't put a lot of effort into it, like Saints Row 4, they kept the same map pretty much as Saints Row 3, except they added some crap to it.
2764000	2772000	And at least God out of Hell has a brand new map, so props to them for that, and it runs great on the Playstation 4, but it's fucking short.
2772000	2785000	Like I finished the game already, and I think in less than like four hours, and there's no rules, I mean there's a story to it, but there's no like, I can't just do missions, like usually you can do the story missions and kind of progress through that.
2786000	2796000	It's just, oh you do the activity stuff, and oh hey look, we're going to do a story mission now because you've completed X number of activities or whatever, and now we're doing the story mission.
2796000	2804000	And then all of a sudden it was like the end, and I'm like, that was it? Wow, okay, then you choose your ending, and it all kind of sucks, so whatever.
2805000	2816000	However, it did bring up an interesting idea, because they have like several different endings in there, one of which is like, oh here's possibly how we're going to reboot the series.
2816000	2831000	You know, basically at the end Johnny gets to make a deal with God, and he gets one of like a few different outcomes, and one of which is to retcon the whole series, and go back to the roots.
2831000	2842000	So that could still be canon if they ended up rebooting the series, but I don't know, at least his character's interesting, I think they've just gotten a little too silly.
2842000	2851000	And it just kind of, I don't know, it's entertaining but it's certainly not what the game series was, and I'm kind of interested to see where it's going to go from there.
2851000	2861000	That aside, since I've, I'm going to probably try to 100% the game since I'm already halfway there anyways after four hours, and that is a little disappointing even though the game was $20.
2861000	2876000	It's still, I don't know, I bought it with the, was it the Sings Row 4 remake that they did, and if it runs as well as it does on, you know, Gata Hell, I'm kind of interested in that because it runs way better than on my laptop, so that should be cool.
2877000	2889000	But they've had these like flash sales on PlayStation Network, and I have to say I'm starting this freedom like I do with Steam where there's shit on there like, ooh, it's only a few dollars, I'm going to buy that.
2889000	2898000	You know, like they had Shadow Warrior, the remake done by Devolver Digital, and that's like a $40 game back in October and it was four bucks.
2898000	2908000	And I was like, fuck, I can't, I can't pass that up, but I have it in Steam already, and it's starting to do like, ooh, Olly Olly, I'm going to pick that up for $3, or hey, ooh, there's this other game.
2908000	2914000	What was it, it was Strike Suit Zero, I think Strike Suit Zero is something like that, I don't know.
2914000	2924000	But it's like, ooh, I got to pick all these up, like I'm never going to play them, I have like a list of like games on my, you know, PlayStation Network that it's starting to look like my Steam library.
2924000	2930000	And I've been buying everything digitally, which is weird because I like hated the idea of like buying stuff digitally, but I'm just so lazy.
2930000	2932000	That convenience is awfully tempting, isn't it?
2932000	2941000	It is, and especially now that they're marking shit down that low, it's very tempting because I check the sales every week and there's stuff on there that like, fuck, for $4.
2941000	2948000	Hey, Sony and Microsoft are competing with Steam now, it's pretty win-win for the rest of us, you know?
2948000	2950000	Exactly, so I'm digging it.
2950000	2952000	Right, anything else for your gaming week?
2952000	2954000	So far, I worked on my game, but that's about it.
2954000	2969000	My gaming week, you know, I was out of town for a week, so outside of my one trip to the arcade where I got to play stuff like Technica 3 and Papa Music, I didn't play a lot a lot, except on the plane I also would play a bit of Bejeweled and those typical like iPad iPhone games, in airplane mode of course.
2969000	2981000	But I did get hands-on with a few other things here at home, not too extensively, but I picked up a game that some of the listeners, at least one listener, called in and said, you need to play this game.
2981000	2991000	And so I actually got to watch a friend of mine play this as well the other day, and I was convinced that I needed to pick up Fantasy Life on the 3DS.
2991000	3004000	And Fantasy Life is a game by Level 5, which made, you know, of course Ni No Kuni, White Knight Chronicles, I believe Yokai Watch is their game as well, which isn't here in the States yet, but it's huge in Japan.
3004000	3018000	So I picked up Fantasy Life. I'm not really far enough into the game where I feel comfortable quote-unquote reviewing it per se, but if you're not aware of the game, it's kind of like, I don't know if I want to say Animal Crossing meets JRPG.
3018000	3038000	However, it definitely feels like, you know, you're put into this game, you can choose between 12 different jobs, some of them being crafting and some other things, which feels maybe a little bit, funny enough, as Eric said earlier, Final Fantasy XIV might feel a little bit of that to me, where you can switch from one job to the other and kind of help your other jobs out by doing that.
3038000	3054000	And you're in this town and, you know, you're like a kid growing up and you can go out into the world and you do all these little quests. You can do quests for people, you can do little achievements, like mini achievements that will give you perks like a bigger bag and all these other things.
3054000	3068000	So yeah, there's a lot of, I guess there's a lot of different grinds to it, which may turn some people off, but I also see where those kind of grinds, you know, that's kind of what an MMO essentially is totally made out of.
3068000	3078000	And that can also be very therapeutic, I think, in some ways. So I will say I'm enjoying very much what I'm playing of Fantasy Life so far, but admittedly it isn't much. I'm only like an hour into the game.
3078000	3086000	I've barely, I think I finally got it where I finished my little wizard quest, I got my wizard robes and hat, I got all the hat.
3086000	3094000	It sounds like, see now I haven't played it yet, but it sounds to me a lot like Room Factory. It's like an RPG spinoff of Harvest Moon.
3095000	3114000	Probably. And you can, well the reason why I called it Animal Crossing is that you can do a lot of quests for the villagers, but instead of like, oh, go take, you know, go take superb owl on my couch, you know, and this whole thing, it's more like, can you go out and fetch me five cow milk things from the wilderness, you know, things like that.
3114000	3129000	So they, you actually are doing more like JRPG style fetch quests. But then like, you can spend the money that you get on furniture for your room, so, and you can even, one of the perks that you get is you can adopt a dog or a cat type of thing so you can get a pet.
3129000	3143000	So you know, there's those types of grinds built into it too. So I'm enjoying it so far though. I'm glad it was recommended to me and then finally basically placed in front of me saying you need to see this game and I finally looked at it and I'm like, oh yeah, I probably would like this.
3143000	3144000	Shane pushed it on you.
3144000	3158000	Actually it wasn't Shane. It was my friend Christine, who I don't think listens to OLR, but she was actually the one that showed it to me. She was over here yesterday and we were on a quick road trip and she was like, oh yeah, you got to check out this game.
3158000	3166000	And she showed it to me and I was like, oh yeah, this does seem like my type of game. And I even remembered that we had a call where somebody had said it was one of their top games of the year last year.
3166000	3177000	And I was like, oh yeah, and I have Nintendo fans on Twitter who all rave about it. So I was like, okay, yeah, I've definitely heard of this. And I was like, oh, it's by the Nino Cooney guys. No wonder we all are liking this game.
3177000	3185000	And I liked White Knight Chronicles more than most people did. So I find this game to be a little bit like that up my alley.
3186000	3195000	BobbyBlackWolf in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says a lot of people compare it to Rune Factory. Yes, more Rune Factory than Animal Crossing.
3195000	3207000	Pow in chat says fantasy life is awesome. I love how bossy and bitter the fairy is. Yeah, I got to say, even in the short hour I've played, there's some very sassy tongue in cheek localization humor going on in there.
3207000	3216000	It's kind of like geared towards kids, but there's definitely that adult level too. So I have to say, I like the script in the game as well.
3216000	3223000	So far, I'm feeling very good about fantasy life. I will check in with you guys next week when I have to put a little more hours in the game under my belt.
3223000	3233000	Alright, let's move on. Some quick housekeeping. We don't have any shows off in the near future, so we'll be coming to you every week in February.
3233000	3243000	The next show I would see that we could be gone or taping in advance would be during PAX East, which is coming up in March. We may be delayed or something that week, we'll see.
3243000	3252000	But I'll let you guys know as the weeks go on. Otherwise, follow us on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio. You can also follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
3252000	3258000	Let's get into tonight's news. There was a bit of news this week, wasn't there? Microsoft had a lot to say, didn't they?
3258000	3265000	It was definitely a big news week. I remember seeing the schedule saying, hey, there's going to be that Windows 10 announcement and everything.
3265000	3273000	But the big thing out of Microsoft's thinking, it shouldn't really be a shock to you if you've been following Microsoft's movements.
3273000	3293000	Especially if you remember back, this is almost, god, I don't even remember how many years now it's been, but that leak that they had about their step-by-step game plan for the next generation of game systems starting with Kinect.
3293000	3306000	Where they had the Kinect, the Xbox One, and all that stuff that leaked out. And then one of the things that they were showing with the Kinect was this kind of holographic, VR-type gameplay.
3306000	3316000	And everyone's like, well, what the hell is that going to be? Well, this is what it is. HoloLens, this thing that they announced. It's basically augmented reality glasses that you wear.
3316000	3325000	And it hooks up to a computer, or it may actually be a computer, and basically augments your world that you live in with whatever the fuck you want.
3325000	3335000	They've showed different examples. Obviously no real gameplay yet, but they have Minecraft in your living room that everything kind of adapts to your environment and everything.
3335000	3344000	So it knows where the walls are. And they had in the little teaser videos, someone blows up their wall and sees the Minecraft world outside. Kind of gimmicky shit like that.
3344000	3353000	But other things like Windows-related stuff like 3D modeling, they had a demonstration using that, and that was pretty cool.
3353000	3368000	Basically, it's going to be used for gaming and for other things. I don't know, kind of a neat idea. I think it's a little bit different than, say, VR stuff.
3368000	3379000	And I think, I don't know, maybe a little bit easier to adopt for people for VR. But I'm very cautious about it, considering how they had a cool teaser video before for Kinect when that first came out.
3379000	3387000	It was like, wow, that's going to be so amazing. And it was so amazingly not that. So I kind of want to see what this is.
3387000	3400000	But to go along with that, other announcements they had, Windows 10 stuff integration for Xbox One where you're going to be able to stream your gameplay to your system and that kind of fun stuff.
3400000	3410000	And plus, for Windows 8 and Windows 7 users, Windows 10 is free. I like free, because I'm not going to buy Windows 10. It better not be fucking broken either.
3410000	3423000	Well, when you consider Apple has a huge mobile operating system that they do give away for free. It's starting to make paying $100 for Windows look less and less appealing.
3423000	3432000	Though, granted, I believe Apple charges a small amount for the desktop OSs. I can't remember. I haven't had a working Apple laptop in forever.
3433000	3448000	I can answer this question. Anything that is 10.8 and earlier has a charge on it, but you cannot buy anything older than 10.6.
3448000	3450000	Gotcha.
3451000	3458000	So there is still charges for some things on Apple, but we have seen Apple give away upgrades for free, especially on the mobile front.
3458000	3473000	I do want to get this. I mean, it looks pretty cool. But once again, I'm very cautious, because with Kinect, remember, they were showing all this cool shit that you could do with it and it's still not even close to what they're doing.
3473000	3475000	You could scan the skateboard and give it to Milo.
3475000	3490000	Yeah, scan the skateboard, and they even had, like, was it, you know, oh, I'm trying on outfits. That stuff I see now is something you could probably do with maybe HoloLens or something, where it's like, okay, you know, I'm seeing the clothes augmented onto my body or whatever, that type of thing.
3490000	3497000	But I just don't see, especially after two iterations of Kinect, and it's still not what they were promising. I just, I'm very cautious.
3497000	3511000	This is interesting to me. You know, this competition is kind of fun, and I think a lot of us have been waiting to see what's Microsoft's response going to be to the Oculus, to the Morpheus, you know, what's Microsoft's response going to be to that.
3511000	3521000	So it is interesting to see this direction that they're going in, which is different. I mean, yes, it's let's put a helmet on my head and see what, you know, the world around me looks like through this, you know, these glasses.
3521000	3533000	But, you know, with the holograph, that's going to be very different than the VR experience. So I kind of like that where it's like, okay, they're both, you know, put your helmet on the head experiences, but they're still very different.
3533000	3541000	Yeah, one is more, it seems like, you know, at least you're able to see your surrounding environment and everything and kind of do your own stuff along with it.
3541000	3546000	And it's just kind of like, oh, hey, I want this Windows Media Player screen to be on this part of the wall or something like that.
3546000	3557000	My worry is I've tried a lot of different AR stuff, you know, with the 3DS, with, you know, even the Kinect and even, you know, the Vita, my phone, and it's just very derpy.
3557000	3565000	Well, you know, here's the thing. Here's where I stand with HoloLens myself is that, you know, I wasn't really a believer in Oculus Rift until I got to try it.
3565000	3575000	You know, at Dragon Con a couple of years ago, Bobby bought his whole little, you know, dev kit one or whatever it was and actually showed me like the roller coaster thing and the walking around the house and all this stuff.
3575000	3583000	You know, he actually showed off some of the demos and I was like, all right, I kind of get this and this does work a lot better than you think it would.
3583000	3594000	And so I was on board with Oculus and certainly getting to play the Morpheus at E3 this year, I really like that Sony has thought about how is this going to work for the other people in the room.
3594000	3598000	Because if you're sitting there with the glasses on your head, nobody else can see that experience but for you.
3598000	3604000	So that's why they have that whole separate little box so it seems like they're going to be able to project the image on the TV as well as the glasses.
3604000	3610000	So I like that Sony's kind of going that direction with it where it's going to be more of, I guess, maybe a party, you know, type of thing.
3610000	3618000	So that's really neat to see and certainly getting to play the little like bobsledding in traffic little demo that they had on the Morpheus, that was really cool.
3618000	3628000	So that was neat. So I think I kind of need that same experience for HoloLens because like you, I'm left a little skeptical with all these promises with what Kinect is supposed to do.
3628000	3633000	And then it ends up, eh, it's a bunch of dancing games and aerobics type stuff.
3633000	3643000	I may be selling it a little short. I understand that in some of the professional fields and in medicine, you know, Kinect has been to thank for some advances in that regard.
3644000	3650000	But keep in mind, first and foremost, this is a gaming show. I'm worried about gaming techniques.
3650000	3656000	And so, you know, this HoloLens, granted, was shown at a Windows show so they're thinking more things necessarily than just Minecraft.
3656000	3662000	But I'm curious to see, you know, I need to see what that's really going to look like for gaming before I know, oh, do I need to put down all this money?
3662000	3670000	Well, that's the other thing, too, is they're talking about like this basically combining all their different platforms and that's just going to be Windows 10 like the Xbox One.
3670000	3677000	It's just, oh, it's got Windows 10 on it now. I don't know how I feel about that, but we'll see.
3677000	3682000	And Bobby's in our chat room saying using AR on a handheld device is a little bit different than using it as a headset.
3682000	3688000	That is very true, Loki. You do have to try it for yourself before I think you can really say this is Oculus Rift or this.
3688000	3691000	Because you just can't unless you've seen it. You just can't.
3691000	3706000	I get it. I get it. But my take on it, and I'm not doubting that it could be really good, but my take on it is this is what in the past with the last big thing with Kinect, this is what they promised me and the end result was crap.
3706000	3708000	You know, it wasn't anything near that.
3708000	3720000	And that is my same concern is that I feel like the Kinect on 360 that we were supposed to be getting wasn't really until the Kinect on Xbox One that we saw that.
3720000	3724000	And even on Xbox One, I'm not sure if it's still quite where we need it to be.
3724000	3730000	Microsoft failed at convincing people they needed one. That's why they kind of got their butt kicked in the beginning.
3730000	3737000	I mean, I realize they're doing better now. They did very well in their November, December sales, especially with the price cut and disconnecting Kinect and everything.
3737000	3743000	But I don't think it's out of place to say that Microsoft failed in making people understand why they needed a Kinect.
3743000	3747000	They were not able to Kinect with the audience.
3747000	3758000	Anyway, let's move on. Moving on to another story that sort of has to do with this whole event as well.
3758000	3770000	And this does tie it to gaming is that there seemed to be an awful lot of teasing at the various displays and so forth with Windows 10 for Battletoads.
3771000	3781000	During the Windows 10 livestream, I know, Phil Spencer showed up to talk about games and he was wearing a Battletoads shirt.
3781000	3790000	This is the latest in several little hints and drops that Battletoads may be a thing on Xbox One.
3790000	3795000	And I kind of feel like we're getting to that point where E3, Microsoft is going to announce,
3795000	3799000	Battletoads is coming to the Xbox One. You all have missed it. Here comes Battletoads.
3799000	3805000	And we're going to see Twitter light up everywhere. I called it. I called it. You heard it from my mouth.
3805000	3808000	Battletoads coming to Windows Mobile 10.
3811000	3814000	Jamie, you're groaning over there, though. You're not a fan?
3814000	3817000	The game's evil. I like it, but it's evil.
3817000	3818000	It's just the difficulty.
3818000	3819000	It is evil and I love it.
3820000	3827000	I could see if they were to do a new Battletoads game, it'll probably be like, they're going to make it more accessible.
3827000	3830000	Oh, fuck that. No, it's not Battletoads. I'm sorry.
3830000	3835000	I'm telling you, they'll want to make it more appealing to kids, because they don't really have Viva Pinata anymore,
3835000	3839000	so that they need a kiddie franchise, so they're going to probably try to make Battletoads like that.
3839000	3842000	They're going to fucking Sonic Boom this shit is what they're going to do, right?
3842000	3847000	But I could also see that very easily they would have a moat, because they can't just kid-ify it.
3847000	3849000	I think people would react exactly the way you do.
3849000	3855000	I think there will be some type of difficulty switch, where it's like a new and retro difficulty or something.
3855000	3860000	If you're not feeling ragey enough to throw your controller, it's not Battletoads, I'm afraid.
3863000	3869000	It's like, that's the point. The point of the game is that you get so frustrated with it, but then once you finally do it, you're like, yes.
3869000	3874000	And then you get to an even harder level, and then you're like, fuck. I have to play that level again.
3874000	3883000	I think Phil Spencer is very tuned into his audience, and you have to admit, whether you're a lover or a hater or somewhere in the middle of Xbox One,
3883000	3891000	it's been doing better under his leadership. And I think a lot of that is because of the fact that he's really tuned into the gaming audience,
3891000	3894000	and he's a little more connected to what the gamers really want.
3894000	3905000	So I have to admit, when he makes the conscious choice at a big event to wear a Battletoads shirt, he's sending a message that he knows he's sending.
3905000	3913000	And it's getting people talking, if nothing else. Maybe he's just trying to prove that there's interest out there for Battletoads. Who knows?
3913000	3917000	But I think there's a damn good possibility that is what we're going to see at E3 this year.
3918000	3926000	Although I would expect that Microsoft's focus this year will be on Crackdown, because that was the big thing they unveiled last year that we need to see.
3926000	3928000	That should be releasing this year.
3928000	3929000	More of that, please.
3929000	3935000	And I'm hoping Quantum Break as well. But this might be the year to tease Battletoads for 2016.
3935000	3937000	God, I want Crackdown so bad.
3937000	3939000	Yes, I know. I know.
3939000	3944000	Would Jamie be willing to at least give Battletoads a chance in 2016?
3944000	3945000	Nope.
3945000	3946000	Nope.
3946000	3947000	Nope.
3947000	3948000	Nope.
3948000	3957000	Seriously, what's up with Saints Row 4 ripping off on Battletoads on Crackdown? You know, with the glowing orbs and shit? That is totally ripping off on Crackdown.
3957000	3966000	Alright. Let's see. And going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Pow in chat says, Battletoads connect. Fingers crossed.
3966000	3968000	You know what?
3968000	3969000	What's that?
3969000	3973000	I will tell you this. I already play Mass Effect in Dragon Age and I don't need something else to make me cry.
3976000	3981000	Dungeonbuster in chat says, the arcade version was actually a little bit easier, if I recall correctly.
3981000	3984000	I had to play through the arcade version on my MAME cabinet. It was fun.
3984000	3990000	Rageinator says, Battletoads t-shirt, Half Life 3 confirmed. Oh, wouldn't that be nice? Wouldn't that be nice?
3990000	3993000	Well, there are three toads in it, so yes.
3993000	3996000	Let's travel around the world and check out...
3996000	3997000	Wait, wait, wait.
3997000	3998000	What?
3998000	4000000	They should have a level called Toad in the Hole since it's like food.
4000000	4006000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out the release dates of games coming a little sooner than a new Battletoads.
4006000	4008000	Oh, I'm sorry, Jamie. Did I skip your story?
4008000	4009000	Yeah, you did.
4009000	4010000	Whoops, my bad.
4010000	4012000	I'm just not going to do it now.
4012000	4015000	Oh, stop throwing a fit. My bad.
4015000	4025000	Well, there is actually something a bit more about the Windows 10 technical preview is that they're going to throw in a preview of the Xbox One app in the January build.
4025000	4033000	So there will be a way, I guess, to have more integration with your live account and all this other stuff.
4033000	4047000	Basically, they said that they're focusing on the basics, including making sure that the app is going to be on spot and have everything that people are going to need for their live accounts.
4049000	4052000	Are you interested in Windows 10 after all the stuff you're hearing about it?
4052000	4053000	No.
4053000	4058000	Well, the other thing, they said they're also going to work on including streaming from Xbox One to PC.
4058000	4064000	And I'll tell you this, all of this is actually making me glad that I'm moving to OS 10.
4064000	4065000	Why, though?
4065000	4069000	Just because I can't talk about it.
4069000	4072000	Well, I can't hate on, though.
4072000	4078000	Well, let's focus on the dislike of the streaming between Xbox One and PC.
4078000	4086000	Because it's an additional feature to me. I'm like, okay, it doesn't seem like such a bad thing. I'm not sure how it's a negative.
4086000	4089000	Yeah, but I want a computer that does computer things.
4089000	4102000	You know, I don't want to have a crossover with a console when I am playing specifically on a computer for the sake of playing on a computer.
4102000	4108000	It does make me think, though, and this is probably a little bit of a pie in the sky idea and people are going to tell me how wrong I am.
4108000	4122000	However, let me dream for a minute here that I would love this if I could take Halo 5, let's say, on my Xbox One and stream it to my computer so I could use keyboard and mouse on my computer when I play Halo 5.
4122000	4124000	That would be awesome.
4125000	4140000	I can see that, but the whole thing is that if you look at it this way, though, it's almost as if they're trying to force more people that, hey, we've already got a PC.
4140000	4146000	The only console that's going to work with this is going to be this Xbox.
4146000	4158000	We need you to get our items so that you can get full integration with your system rather than apps out there that are, oh, well, if you have this here, you get something for your PlayStation.
4158000	4160000	We're going to see an end of that.
4160000	4168000	You know, it's all going to be down to I honestly think it's going to be a lot more of a pushing agenda.
4168000	4172000	That and honestly, we may be looking at too little too late.
4172000	4176000	There have been others that have been innovating on stuff like this well before they have.
4176000	4186000	I guess there was the whole fact that you can stream to the Vita from the PlayStation 4, but again, I see it as more of like, okay, this is just something extra.
4186000	4190000	I may never use it, but I guess it's kind of cool that I can do that.
4190000	4200000	And we have seen this already talked about going the other way, and Steam has been talking about certainly doing the streaming to the televisions based off what's on your PC through the whole Steam box.
4200000	4204000	So, I mean, this just kind of seems like another step in that direction.
4204000	4211000	But I think I would only really use it if I could do something like what I just mentioned with sudden keyboard and mouse controls for certain games.
4211000	4219000	It honestly just seems like they're going, oh, us too, when other people have been doing all these things already.
4219000	4226000	And then bringing out the whole HoloLens thing to kind of distract from, oh, other people have already been doing this.
4226000	4228000	This HoloLens is kind of different though.
4228000	4239000	I'm totally down for streaming to my laptop for my game system and stuff, because my wife tends to use the TV when I want to play games, and that'd be awesome.
4239000	4245000	I wish all the systems would stream to my PC. I mean, I don't know why they can't.
4245000	4252000	If a Vita can run a PlayStation 4 game, surely a laptop can run a PlayStation 4 game stream.
4252000	4257000	Depending on your laptop. Okay, if your laptop can run Windows 10, then it can do it, right?
4257000	4265000	I mean, that's what I'm saying. I would love to have that feature, if anything, so I wouldn't have to set up an elaborate setup to be able to play my game.
4265000	4276000	Interesting. Okay. Well, we'll see more about what this is going to entail in the future as Windows 10 preview builds come out and people actually get their hands on this stuff when it's unlocked.
4276000	4286000	All right, now I've got the airship out front ready to go and travel around the world and check out what will be coming out a little sooner than Windows 10 or Battletoads or any of that stuff.
4286000	4290000	Next week around the world in gaming releases, starting in the U.S., Loki.
4290000	4298000	Hey, you got some parkour in my zombie game, so Dying Light will be coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC this week.
4298000	4307000	And if you're not into Dying Light and may have a Vita, then Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth Sisters Generation will be coming to the Vita. That would be it.
4307000	4314000	Well, going to Japan, we're finally starting to see some releases. I know things were a little slower in the beginning of the month, but in Japan this week on the PlayStation 4,
4314000	4322000	we get Blade Storm, The Hundred Years War and Nightmare, as well as Far Cry 4, getting its Japanese release this week on the 29th.
4322000	4330000	On the Xbox One, Blade Storm is coming out there as well, although I noticed Far Cry is absent, so I don't know if it's just not releasing over there or what the deal is.
4330000	4342000	Over on the Wii U, we get nothing until Mario Party 10 in March, so the Wii U releases over in Japan are a little bit slow right now.
4342000	4358000	But on the 3DS, you have a few more things going on, including Ace Combat 3D, Cross Rumble Plus, Devil Survivor 2, Break Record, and Yamamushi Pedal, Ashita Inoue High Cadence comes out from Bandai Namco this week in Japan on the 3DS.
4358000	4367000	And last but not least, looking at the Vita. The Vita this week has...wow, there's a lot of crap on the Vita this week, actually.
4367000	4378000	Diabolic Lovers, More Blood limited edition V, that's of course a limited edition game. Hitosutabashi Rinai V in regular and limited edition.
4378000	4385000	Kokujou no Psychedelica in regular and limited edition. You know they love their limited editions over there. More than we do here.
4385000	4394000	And Kurogane Kaikatan Senai Ichiya comes out in regular and limited edition in Japan this week, all on the Vita.
4394000	4398000	Busy week on the Vita in Japan. How about the UK, DarkSakura?
4398000	4411000	We have a few things. On January 27th, we have Hyperdimension Aptunia Rebirth 2. On the 29th, we have Heroes of Might and Magic 3 HD edition for iPad, PC, and Android.
4411000	4423000	On the 30th, we have Life is Strange on several systems, and Saints Row IV Re-elected, and Unmechanical Extended on Xbox One.
4423000	4429000	Alright, just a few more stories for you guys, then we'll get to the classic game of the week. But first, Loki.
4429000	4440000	So, can't say we didn't call this, or have been seeing this for a long time now, but finally it has happened. To a certain extent.
4440000	4448000	But the Elder Scrolls Online no longer will have the subscription fee. That's right, it's going, well, not free to play, but buy to play.
4448000	4453000	So basically, you purchase the game, and then you get to play for free month to month, which is kind of cool.
4453000	4469000	And it will be coming out on consoles June 9th, and according to ZeniMax, they're going to be dropping the subscription to the service on PC March 17th.
4470000	4482000	And that will be rebranded as the Elder Scrolls Online Tamriel Unlimited, and they still have the option to pay a monthly fee if you want extra content and that kind of stuff.
4482000	4491000	So, I really went off on this on Hoard House this week, because everybody's reporting it as free to play, but it's not free to play when you're still charging for the base game.
4492000	4496000	And, what's another big one out there?
4496000	4497000	Guild Wars?
4497000	4504000	No, Guild Wars actually isn't free to play either. Guild Wars has a huge sale right now. Guild Wars 2 specifically has a huge sale right now.
4504000	4508000	I may or may not have spent $15 on the deluxe edition.
4508000	4521000	Taking the plunge on that, yeah. But, yeah, you have to pay that one-time fee, and then you are playing the game without a monthly subscription. It's basically subscription-free.
4521000	4528000	So, I mean, they're still going to be charging $60 for this game. But, you know, what's the difference between that and something like Destiny?
4528000	4535000	Destiny you pay $60, and then you can play online as much as you want. And then how do they get even more money out of you? Through expansions.
4535000	4545000	And that's exactly what Elder Scrolls Online is going to do. It's going to be through expansions, and they'll be like, oh, but if you have a sub-fee, then you can get these crowns for the cosmetic items, and then we'll give you all these expansions we're going to do for free.
4545000	4553000	I think it's a better model for the game, and I think especially now that since you're entering the console market, I think that's what a lot of console gamers expect.
4554000	4565000	Subscription games on consoles doing well are very, very, very rare, and they're pretty much always preceded by Final Fantasy, if they still carry a subscription fee on a console.
4565000	4573000	Can you even think of any console games that carry subscription fees right now that are not named Final Fantasy? I can't think of one.
4574000	4584000	I know there's free-to-play MMOs, but I'm talking you've got to buy the game and pay a subscription fee on top of that on consoles. I can't think of one.
4584000	4588000	So, not anymore, because they used to have some where they were like DC Universe.
4588000	4595000	There was the game that Trion did that went free-to-play that was on 360. They did the sci-fi TV show.
4595000	4598000	Oh, well that wasn't a monthly fee, though.
4598000	4599000	Oh, I thought it was.
4599000	4602000	No, it was just like this, where you buy it and you play it.
4602000	4603000	Oh, gotcha.
4603000	4604000	Yeah, Defiance.
4604000	4605000	Defiance.
4605000	4606000	But now that's free-to-play, so...
4606000	4607000	Yeah, there you go.
4607000	4608000	Yeah.
4608000	4614000	So, let's see, looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, bonds006 says,
4614000	4619000	There is no true free-to-play game. In-app DLC or base buys still exist.
4619000	4624000	You know, but some do the free-to-play thing better than others. They really do.
4625000	4630000	Like, EA mobile games have been notorious for being very naggy and buying the currency,
4630000	4633000	like that Ultima game that they did that was awful, some of this other stuff.
4633000	4635000	You know, they have a bit of a reputation for that.
4635000	4636000	Dungeon Keeper or whatever that was.
4636000	4642000	Yeah, yeah. But then, I look at a game like Path of Exile, which is also free-to-play,
4642000	4647000	and, okay, yeah, they have a lot of stuff that you can pay for that are cosmetic or some other things,
4647000	4653000	but I still feel like there's a very rich game experience that you can play start to finish over in Path of Exile
4653000	4656000	that is totally free. And so that's pretty cool.
4656000	4661000	So, anyway, maybe that was the free-to-play game, the other one I was trying to think of a minute ago,
4661000	4665000	but, yeah, you can download Path of Exile and just, you know, play that, whatever.
4665000	4669000	But, yeah, I have to admit, I'm much more interested in Elder Scrolls Online now.
4669000	4670000	I might have to check it out.
4670000	4671000	Skarstacra?
4671000	4673000	By the way, I would like to rebut.
4673000	4677000	In-app purchases are not a requirement.
4677000	4678000	True.
4678000	4687000	You can play a game completely free without choosing to participate in an in-app purchase.
4687000	4689000	Therefore, it remains free.
4689000	4698000	But, well, Apple actually changed from free to get because of some of the, it's just, it depends on the game.
4698000	4703000	Like, Bejeweled Blitz does a really good job about being, like, free-to-play where you don't,
4703000	4705000	like, they don't really shove it down your throat.
4705000	4709000	The other thing is that, like, the EA games I mentioned, some of them are very much more in your face
4709000	4714000	and make it very, very difficult to do any sort of progression without buying into it.
4714000	4715000	Do you still have a choice?
4715000	4717000	You do. You do. But...
4717000	4721000	It's just a matter of how much more willpower you have than their persuasion.
4721000	4724000	Ah. I think I know the way to put it.
4724000	4729000	Some people would consider what those games are doing more of a demo than they are a game.
4729000	4734000	And that is a trend I do see in some apps is that they're free, but it's really just a demo for the first level.
4734000	4738000	And if you want to buy the entire game, well, then you make the purchase inside the app.
4738000	4743000	And I think that's kind of the difference is that some games really do offer a rich game experience.
4743000	4746000	They have these options on either side. Some are just flat out demos.
4746000	4750000	I do believe they are required to put that in their, the body of their description.
4750000	4754000	That it's either a first level, a demo, or it has to say light edition.
4754000	4759000	Hmm. I'll have to look up the one that I downloaded not that long ago and see if it did that.
4759000	4760000	So, interesting.
4760000	4765000	Alright. Let's see. Looking at chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
4765000	4773000	Dungeon Buster says, never winner is free to play, though depending on who you talk to, it's either pay to win because of PVP or pay for convenience if you don't care about PVP.
4773000	4779000	Bonds006 says, angry birds, plants versus zombies, those are called pay to win.
4779000	4786000	Maybe that Garden Warfare game is a big hill to climb without doing any in-app purchases, that's for sure.
4786000	4793000	Anyway, let's move on. I got one more story for you guys and we're going to get to the classic game of the week.
4793000	4799000	And speaking of big purchases, people went crazy for that new Nintendo 3DS Majora's Mask edition.
4799000	4805000	Which I have to admit, again, I'm going to get the Nintendo hate train rolling over me here.
4805000	4808000	Because I'm going to say something slightly negative.
4808000	4818000	But I was not really a big fan of Majora's Mask, although I'll probably give the 3D reboot a try because they really enhance Ocarina of Time and stuff for the 3DS.
4818000	4826000	Nintendo does a very good job at enriching their games when they do the remakes as opposed to just port type of thing.
4826000	4832000	But I have no interest in the Majora's Mask 3DS because I kind of think it's ugly.
4832000	4834000	I'm going to get so much slack for that.
4834000	4840000	But that's how I feel. I'm allowed to my opinion. I'm allowed to say this art is ugly and I think those new 3DSes are ugly.
4840000	4850000	On top of that, I have a problem with once again Nintendo trying to make themselves seem more value friendly by not including the game with the freaking system.
4850000	4856000	Well, I just think this Triforce XL I have is way better. That's a way better Zelda design in my opinion.
4856000	4859000	But that's my opinion and I'm entitled to it and some may disagree.
4859000	4863000	I do wish the gold on that was as shiny as the original NES game.
4864000	4871000	So anyway, a few folks preordered their Nintendo's 3DS Majora's Mask on Best Buy.
4871000	4874000	Well, Best Buy cancelled a lot of these preorders.
4874000	4880000	And apparently, wow, it's affecting people that only preordered one system.
4880000	4885000	And the retailer started to give out $50 gift cards as a way of saying, oops, sorry about that.
4885000	4888000	The email saying, quote, we're sorry but there's an issue with your preorder.
4888000	4896000	The popularity of Nintendo 3DS XL Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask, limited edition gold and black, exceeded the quantities made available to Best Buy.
4896000	4899000	As a result, we're unable to fulfill all the preorders received.
4899000	4902000	Your preorder has been cancelled and we know this is disappointing.
4902000	4908000	So we're making it up to you by offering a $50 discount that may be used towards the purchase of one of these alternate options.
4908000	4918000	I never understood how something that's literally a paint job on a system is, you know, they're not able to meet the demand on that.
4918000	4921000	It's like, paint more of them.
4922000	4924000	I mean, that doesn't seem like it.
4924000	4929000	Or make it capable to sub out the faceplates and then you can have the new faceplates on them.
4929000	4931000	Yeah, there's not as much money to be made on that.
4931000	4933000	Then they wouldn't get the publicity like this.
4933000	4939000	If things were able to meet their demands, they're not going to get the publicity, so of course.
4940000	4943000	Let's see, Bonds006 says Best Buy already made that money.
4943000	4948000	PhysicsMajor in chat says Majora's Mask is my favorite Zelda title, very difficult.
4948000	4950000	And you know, I've heard that from other people too.
4950000	4954000	I gotta be honest, they're probably losing a ton of money on that because there's no markup on game hardware.
4954000	4958000	They're making maybe a couple bucks off that and if that.
4959000	4964000	Probably losing it in shipping anyway, so they're not making any money off of that.
4964000	4970000	ActDeft in chat says the Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate New 3DS looks way more awesome, but sadly it's a GameStop exclusive.
4970000	4974000	There's a whole nother Oprah about those types of exclusives that go to...
4974000	4982000	Like, why does Nintendo, I mean, I guess this is kind of a stupid question, but why does Nintendo keep being up GameStop's ass like this?
4982000	4987000	And maybe it's so GameStop won't kick the Wii U out of the store, maybe that's what it has to do with,
4987000	4991000	but I just, it's disappointing as a fan.
4991000	4994000	These sorts of exclusive deals and stuff are just really disappointing.
4994000	4997000	That's really the only word I can think of for it. Sucks.
4997000	4998000	Well, anyway.
4998000	5003000	Alright, let's go back to a time when it was a lot simpler.
5003000	5007000	There was an abundance of games wherever you wanted to go.
5007000	5012000	You could go in and find them in a big bin at KB Toys if that's where you wanted to shop for your video games.
5012000	5015000	It's the classic game of the week.
5015000	5019000	And every week Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,
5019000	5022000	hey, you guys should be checking out this game this week.
5022000	5024000	Yes, I know the music isn't playing, I can't find it.
5024000	5026000	What happened to my music for this segment?
5026000	5029000	I want to know where my list of the thing went, so, huh.
5029000	5031000	What list of the thing?
5031000	5033000	I accidentally closed Safari.
5033000	5035000	Oh.
5035000	5037000	Oops. Well, that's awkward.
5037000	5042000	I usually have the cutesy music to play here for Dark Sakura, but it disappeared from my playlist.
5042000	5044000	There it is, I got it back.
5046000	5048000	Live radio and the joys of it.
5048000	5051000	Alright, so Dark Sakura's going to step in that gaming vault and find the game that she thinks,
5051000	5053000	hey, you should check out this game this week.
5053000	5054000	I think it's Dustin's Cat Throw Up.
5054000	5057000	And you will have no problem finding this game.
5057000	5060000	You were there when I purchased this version.
5060000	5062000	One of the versions I have of this.
5062000	5064000	Oh, yes I was. I know what you're talking about.
5064000	5065000	Yes.
5065000	5068000	The game of the week is Pac-Land.
5068000	5072000	Now, Pac-Land is not really a great game.
5072000	5075000	But, it is iconic.
5075000	5077000	Now listen to the music for a moment.
5077000	5082000	And tell me if any of you who were kids when I was a kid recognize this music.
5091000	5092000	Oh, he got a helmet or something.
5092000	5093000	Yeah.
5093000	5095000	It's been forever since I played this.
5095000	5098000	It was like Pac-Man Mario, it was so weird.
5098000	5100000	It's very weird.
5100000	5105000	Anyway, the music that's playing in the background in both the Japanese and American versions
5105000	5112000	was the music from the American Pac-Man cartoon that was on in the 80s.
5112000	5117000	Which wasn't a great cartoon, but it was plenty hilarious.
5117000	5124000	So yeah, in Japan it was done by Namco, or as I call it, Namco-T.
5124000	5127000	With a T at the end because it was Namcopped.
5127000	5132000	And in the US it was done by Bally Midway, which is now just Midway Games.
5132000	5137000	It came out in 1984 in the arcades.
5137000	5145000	It also was using a new arcade system that was actually called Namco Pac-Land.
5145000	5149000	It used parallax scrolling for some of the different background elements
5149000	5155000	well before it became a regular fixture in 16-bit gaming.
5155000	5163000	There were different variances I was differentiating between the American and Japanese ones.
5163000	5169000	In the Japanese version it actually is one of the first appearances in a game of Pac-Man
5169000	5178000	with his now iconic Namco artwork with the big eyes and the longer nose.
5178000	5183000	And he also in the game had what was called a Tearolian Hat.
5183000	5187000	Which I actually had to go look up even though I've seen the term before.
5187000	5193000	Which is basically a big kind of flat brimmed hat with a feather in it.
5193000	5198000	It's based off of a Bavarian style.
5198000	5202000	Anyway, the American version started...
5202000	5209000	It's differences is that the characters were more based on how the Pac-Man animated series that Hannah Barbera did.
5209000	5213000	Including the differences in the ghosts and the way Pac-Man looked.
5213000	5219000	It was a lot more in tune with what we had in America.
5219000	5221000	Better branded I'd say.
5221000	5226000	And the Midway version, the US one, actually plays faster than the Japanese one.
5226000	5228000	This I can attest to.
5228000	5231000	So the game itself is split into trips.
5231000	5237000	On each of these trips your goal is to get this fairy that's hiding under Pac-Man's hat to Fairyland.
5237000	5239000	And then get Pac-Man back home.
5239000	5242000	So you scroll left and right.
5242000	5244000	You have to stop ghosts.
5244000	5248000	You can get power pills and you can eat the ghosts.
5248000	5250000	They turn purple.
5250000	5253000	You have water spurts and quicksands.
5253000	5255000	Each trip has different rounds.
5255000	5259000	So at the end you get bonus points depending on how much time you have left.
5259000	5263000	And your position in jumping at the end of the round.
5263000	5271000	If you run out of time before the round is over then Sue, the purple ghost, the lady ghost, remember her?
5271000	5274000	She will actually get really really fast.
5274000	5282000	So the very, the second to last one, Pac-Man ends up in Fairyland and returning the fairy to the queen.
5282000	5284000	And then Pac-Man is given magical boots.
5284000	5289000	And so the last one he has to basically travel from right to left to get back home.
5289000	5293000	And he uses the magical boots to let him double jump and do what not.
5293000	5296000	And at the end of the game he's greeted by Ms. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man.
5296000	5300000	In the US one, Sourpuss and Chomp Chomp are there.
5300000	5303000	His cat and his dog from the animated series.
5303000	5308000	And then he gets to do the next trip and it gets harder.
5308000	5312000	You also get fruit appearing during the game like in the original Pac-Man.
5312000	5314000	It gives you points.
5314000	5317000	You get hidden items which is actually the flagship from Galaxian.
5317000	5321000	And it gives you 7650 points when you collected.
5321000	5328000	Which is the Goro Awase number 765.
5328000	5334000	The flagship also appears in plenty of other Pac-Man games.
5334000	5336000	There's no actual hidden bonuses.
5336000	5339000	You eat the ghosts in a certain order will give you time.
5339000	5344000	And getting certain obstacles can give you extra lives, invincibility, or balloons.
5344000	5347000	So you get points you can even warp in some places.
5347000	5354000	Basically you had two buttons that move them left or right and a third one that made them jump.
5354000	5360000	On the TurboGrafx-16 they tried to do two different control versions.
5360000	5366000	They let you either use the D-pad or type B that use the buttons rather than the D-pad.
5366000	5370000	I'm watching this guy run it on the little YouTube that you gave us here.
5370000	5373000	That will be available if you watch this on the OLR YouTube account.
5374000	5379000	He's doing all these things that I don't remember in the game.
5379000	5382000	Like pushing cactuses to make special bonus things appear.
5382000	5384000	And all this other stuff. I'm kind of shocked.
5384000	5387000	I'm like, wow, all this shit was in the game? I didn't realize that.
5387000	5389000	I thought it was just a side scroller.
5389000	5390000	There were Famicom versions by the way.
5390000	5393000	And you use A and B to run and the D-pad to jump.
5393000	5396000	Now there were of course other versions, Rob.
5396000	5398000	There was a Commodore 64 version.
5398000	5399000	I know that, yeah, yeah.
5399000	5409000	There was one for the Commodore Amiga, Atari Lynx, the Atari ST, TurboGrafx-16, the ZX Spectrum, and the Amstrad CPC, the MSX, and the NES.
5409000	5412000	And you can also get this on the Wii U Virtual Console.
5414000	5418000	They actually re-released this as part of the Namco Museum Volume 4 for Playstation.
5418000	5421000	There's an LCD version of Pac-Land.
5421000	5428000	In 2012 Namco re-released Pac-Land on the Namco Arcade app for iPhone and iPad.
5428000	5441000	It was included in Pac-Man Museum and all of the ports that were released in and out of Japan were based off of the Namco version.
5441000	5452000	However, the Namco Arcade version actually has the Midway version and also the Midway version appears in the Japanese version of the same app.
5452000	5458000	So you actually have ways that you can play both versions in both countries without having to import.
5458000	5459000	Interesting.
5459000	5461000	So that's it, it's Pac-Land.
5461000	5463000	There it is, your classic game of the week, Pac-Land.
5463000	5473000	Which again, the other thing I wanted to say about this game, especially because unsurprisingly you chose the TurboGrafx-16 or PC Engine version to show here to demonstrate this game.
5473000	5475000	I actually like the music better than the arcade one.
5475000	5476000	Fair enough.
5476000	5483000	But it kind of reminds me that the gameplay is an awful lot like, in some ways, Hudson Adventure Island.
5483000	5488000	Which was what, Wonder Boy? Wasn't that turned into Hudson?
5488000	5489000	I think it was one of the Wonder Boy games.
5489000	5491000	Yeah, it was kind of turned into Hudson Adventure Island.
5491000	5499000	It kind of has that very similar gameplay with the whole mechanic where you have a timer and you make the fruit appear when you are situated a certain way.
5499000	5501000	It just really reminds me of that.
5501000	5502000	So kind of another version of that.
5502000	5503000	Anyway.
5503000	5505000	It's not really a bad game.
5505000	5507000	It's just a little frustrating.
5507000	5508000	It's a little dated too.
5508000	5510000	I would say it's this other kind of thing.
5510000	5512000	You know, some classic game of the weeks are forever.
5512000	5514000	This is a little dated if you go back and play it.
5514000	5517000	It is, but you know, we still have to appreciate the classics.
5517000	5518000	Of course, of course.
5518000	5521000	Alright, especially with Super Smash Brothers and everything.
5521000	5523000	Yes, that was the other thing.
5523000	5525000	That is actually the reason why I picked this game.
5525000	5530000	Is because in Super Smash Brothers there is a Pac-Land fighting level.
5530000	5533000	So it was like one of the mini games.
5534000	5537000	So I just thought I'd throw that one out there.
5537000	5541000	So it does come from an actual game in gaming's past if you didn't already know.
5541000	5542000	Indeed.
5542000	5543000	Alright, there it is. Your classic game of the week.
5543000	5544000	Pac-Land.
5544000	5546000	Available everywhere.
5546000	5550000	It was on every system in the late 80's, early 90's.
5550000	5551000	There it is. Pac-Land.
5551000	5554000	Unless you had something by Sega.
5554000	5557000	Alright, when we come back there is plenty more show to come.
5557000	5561000	Including the FUGL question of the week and your calls at 1877 Game OLR.
5561000	5563000	Or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
5563000	5565000	Our mail bags accumulated two weeks worth of mail.
5565000	5569000	And we have some more news including Club Nintendo.
5569000	5570000	Going to be sunsetting.
5570000	5572000	We'll talk about that and why that's happening.
5572000	5575000	And a brand new game from Sid Meier.
5575000	5577000	You know the creator of Civilization.
5577000	5578000	Rob needs to go change his pants.
5578000	5580000	That's right, so I need to go change my pants.
5580000	5581000	We're going to go take a break.
5581000	5584000	We'll be back with more of OrangeLoungeRadio right after this.
5587000	5593000	Welcome back everybody to OrangeLoungeRadio.
5593000	5598000	Live tonight, episode 584 for January the 25th of 2015.
5598000	5601000	Thanks so much for coming back and joining us after we were gone last week.
5601000	5603000	We finally took a break there.
5603000	5605000	We were live every Sunday through the holidays.
5605000	5608000	But finally I was like, you know what, I'm going to Seattle.
5608000	5610000	And you know, Jamie and Matt, they deserve a week off as well.
5610000	5612000	So we all took the week off last week.
5612000	5616000	So hopefully you guys had some other great indie podcasts to help fill the time.
5616000	5620000	For your commutes or for your work day or what have you during the week last week.
5620000	5622000	But thanks so much for coming right back over to OrangeLoungeRadio.
5622000	5624000	We do appreciate the support.
5624000	5626000	And I got to tell you guys, I had a really good time in Seattle.
5626000	5629000	I don't know how many listeners we have up there.
5629000	5631000	I don't usually see faces and chat from the area.
5631000	5633000	But if I'm neglecting you, I'm so sorry.
5633000	5636000	I don't always remember every single person and where they live.
5636000	5637000	But I will give my compliments.
5637000	5639000	I had a great time while I was up there.
5639000	5641000	I got to do all the tourist trap stuff.
5641000	5644000	Went over to the Space Needle and the Experience Music Project.
5644000	5648000	Which, by the way, has over at the EMP, or Experience Music Project,
5648000	5654000	they actually have an indie games exhibit going on right now inside the music museum.
5654000	5659000	I mean, you know, with all these, you know, Jimi Hendrix exhibit and Nirvana exhibit.
5659000	5663000	And an awesome music video exhibit, might I say.
5663000	5670000	I know those of you guys that have me on Facebook probably saw my picture with the Aha! The Take On Me video cut out.
5670000	5672000	That whole thing, the other thing set up where you take pictures.
5672000	5674000	I was like, yes! So that was pretty cool.
5674000	5680000	But anyway, they had a little room actually dedicated just for, like, indie games and independently developed games.
5680000	5684000	And that was really cool because there was stuff that was set up that you could play.
5684000	5688000	And some things that, you know, a lot of you guys have probably heard of or seen before.
5688000	5689000	Like, Gone Home was set up in there.
5689000	5692000	But there was some other stuff that even I hadn't heard of before in there too.
5692000	5696000	So it was pretty cool just to walk through and see what all is getting a lot of love.
5696000	5703000	Because Cindy, uh, Cindy, Seattle, when you get Seattle and Indie and you combine them together, you get Cindy.
5703000	5707000	Seattle has a really big Indie scene as does Vancouver.
5707000	5708000	It's that whole Pacific Northwest.
5708000	5713000	And, you know, obviously some big gaming companies up there between Valve and Nintendo and Microsoft.
5713000	5715000	And the fact that they have PAX Prime up there.
5715000	5717000	There's a big, big gaming scene there.
5717000	5719000	So it's pretty cool to see everything represented there.
5719000	5722000	And I got to see that at the museum.
5722000	5724000	And that was on Sunday even.
5724000	5727000	So I think I made a tweet on my personal account where I was just kind of joking.
5727000	5731000	And I was saying, even on a night off, I can't help but play some video games.
5731000	5732000	And that's what we did.
5732000	5736000	Now there was one big game that was being played in Seattle that day.
5736000	5737000	Let me tell you.
5737000	5741000	Because that Sunday was the same day that big football game was going on up there.
5741000	5744000	And people would be crazy about their football up in Seattle.
5744000	5748000	Especially with that particular game and how close it was.
5748000	5751000	And the fact that Seattle did end up winning it in overtime.
5751000	5758000	I will tell you, I was, when they won the game, we were on the elevator going up to the top of the Space Needle.
5758000	5762000	And the elevator operator was like, I have to hear what's going on when we get to the top.
5762000	5764000	I have to know what's going on with the game.
5764000	5767000	Because, you know, the locals get really excited that their team is going to the Super Bowl.
5767000	5771000	So, you know, however you feel about that team or the other teams.
5771000	5776000	I was laughing at people because Dan was watching a video of people who were leaving the game early.
5776000	5778000	Yes. Yes, I heard about that.
5778000	5779000	I was like...
5781000	5782000	That's what you get.
5783000	5784000	It's funny.
5784000	5787000	Hey, at least they got out of the parking lot before anybody else.
5787000	5788000	Isn't that what's important?
5788000	5791000	Alright, anyway, I'll stop talking about my trip and we'll get back into talking about games.
5791000	5794000	Let's do some rapid fire news.
5794000	5796000	Wait, I got to see what this is.
5796000	5799000	Rama in chat says, Sky, you're a wonderful person.
5799000	5801000	I work my co-hosts.
5801000	5806000	And, you know, there's no reason why Darksire and Loki couldn't have done a show without me.
5806000	5809000	But sometimes it's just, you know what, let's just have a wee...
5809000	5811000	I mean, Dark Soccer did have the key to my house.
5811000	5812000	She could have come in here and...
5812000	5813000	I was busy petting Sanrio.
5813000	5815000	You guys did a show without me once.
5815000	5817000	It was a while ago. It was when we did the show at your house.
5817000	5822000	It's a little bit easier when, like, the computer was in my house and I had already been using it for other podcasts.
5822000	5823000	Yeah. Yeah.
5823000	5828000	But I'm taking steps to get things figured out for doing it on my MacBook.
5828000	5829000	Yep.
5829000	5835000	My wife keeps pushing me to have my son on the show because all he does is talk about the video game that he plays.
5835000	5837000	We would love to have your son on the show.
5837000	5839000	Julian has been on the show.
5839000	5841000	Yeah, but he'd be here for a while.
5841000	5845000	It would be just, like, and he whines a lot.
5845000	5846000	That's what kids do.
5846000	5848000	We'd have to clean up our mouths a little bit, too.
5848000	5851000	I'd be the family-friendly OLR edition. Yay!
5851000	5853000	So, we'll do that.
5853000	5859000	Maybe for April Fools this year we'll get Bobby Black Wolf to do a show where he swears all night.
5859000	5862000	And then we'll do a family-friendly show.
5862000	5866000	Now I'm invoking other people into my big plan here.
5866000	5870000	Alright, anyway, let's get into some rapid-fire news in all seriousness.
5870000	5873000	No foolin', there is a lot of other news that happened this week, right, Loki?
5873000	5882000	Yeah, so no surprise that they're going to be re-releasing Borderlands 2 and Borderlands the Pre-Sequel on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5882000	5889000	And the collection will be coming out on March 24th in North America and everywhere else on the 27th.
5889000	5891000	And it's the Handsome Collection.
5891000	5895000	And it includes, like I said, Borderlands 2 and the Pre-Sequel with all DLC.
5895000	5897000	And they'll be for $60.
5897000	5905000	I hope that's actually all DLC and not just, like, oh yeah, it's some of the DLC but, you know, some of the other DLC in there.
5905000	5909000	You're going to have to purchase separately, like they do sometimes.
5910000	5925000	Also, if you happen to be really a rabid fan of the series, they had 5,000 Claptrap, or just the Handsome Collection, Claptrap in a Box edition that was retailing at $399.
5925000	5928000	That would come with everything that was in the regular bundle.
5928000	5938000	Plus, a remote-controlled Claptrap Steward Robot, a collectible steel case, and 12 exclusive lithographs.
5938000	5941000	However, as far as I'm aware, those are all sold out already.
5941000	5945000	So, people love them. They're Claptraps.
5945000	5949000	And, yeah, no surprise that those come out.
5949000	5957000	Kind of wish that they had thrown the original Borderlands in there as well, but I don't know, I guess, for whatever reason they decided not to.
5958000	5970000	And then to go along with that, they've got some more DLC coming for Borderlands the Pre-Sequel, including another playable character with Lady Hammerlock, who is the sister of Sir Hammerlock in the game.
5970000	5975000	And you'll be able to download that on January 27th.
5975000	5984000	And she apparently is also included as part of the season pass, so if you do have that, you don't need to purchase her, but otherwise, she is $999.
5987000	5989000	I don't know, interesting.
5989000	5997000	And then there's this cool website that you can check out that calculates how much time it would take you to finish your Steam library.
5997000	6006000	It's a website called Steam Left, so steamleft.com, and you put in your Steam information, and it will look at your library and tell you how much time.
6006000	6011000	If I remember correctly, I think I had like 1200 hours or something like that.
6012000	6017000	It says I could watch, they give you little statistics on the bottom there, it's like, you could.
6017000	6019000	I'm really afraid, what's the website?
6019000	6027000	Steamleft.com, and it's all like, for mine, they're all, you could watch the entire series of Friends 29 times.
6027000	6033000	I'm like, no, I would not want to watch this series of Friends 29 times.
6035000	6037000	Oh god, nevermind.
6037000	6039000	You beat me.
6040000	6050000	So it would take me 2599 continuous hours, that's 108 days, 7 hours and 49 minutes to complete my Steam library.
6050000	6055000	I could watch the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy 228 times.
6055000	6060000	Oh, I could listen to Weird Al's Albuquerque 12999 times.
6060000	6062000	Wait, was this URL again?
6062000	6066000	Oh, actually, nevermind. Mine is a little higher than I thought it was, I was remembering days.
6066000	6068000	You actually have been beat by 9 hours, though.
6068000	6070000	I'm 2590.
6070000	6072000	Steamleft.com, DarkSira.
6072000	6074000	Alright, hold on.
6074000	6075000	Here it is.
6075000	6077000	107 days, 22 hours and 40 minutes.
6079000	6083000	And Bobby says if you hover over the words continuous hours, you get a little Easter egg.
6086000	6088000	Love that, I'm not going to give it away, that's great.
6089000	6094000	1770 continuous hours, or 73 days, 18 hours and 46 minutes.
6094000	6097000	In this time, you could have made this web app 129 times.
6098000	6101000	I could have watched the whole series of Breaking Bad 42 times.
6101000	6104000	Performed to open heart surgery 647 times.
6104000	6106000	Alright, we're all having a cry, next story.
6106000	6108000	Oh, this is actually awesome.
6108000	6113000	I could have listened to Rush's 2112 album 2724 times.
6113000	6115000	You gonna go see their 40th anniversary tour in San Jose?
6115000	6116000	I wish.
6116000	6117000	I'd go. You wanna go?
6117000	6119000	I'm broke.
6119000	6121000	I could have also lived out one lifespan as an ant.
6121000	6123000	Alright, now let's move on.
6123000	6125000	Okay, Rob, let's go see Rush.
6125000	6126000	Okay, yay.
6126000	6127000	If it's not expensive.
6127000	6128000	Alright, so this is pretty sweet.
6128000	6129000	It's not sold out already.
6129000	6132000	This is actually something I tried back when they had a beta for it, but I never really got into it.
6132000	6135000	And then, which is probably good because then it got shortly shut down afterwards.
6135000	6138000	And then it came back, but I never went back to it.
6138000	6144000	But this is the PC MMO All Points Bulletin Reloaded is now coming to consoles.
6144000	6149000	And they're going to be launching on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in the second quarter of this year.
6149000	6151000	And it will be free to play still.
6151000	6153000	And you can check it out.
6153000	6158000	And it's kind of along the lines of the first or second Saints Row games.
6158000	6161000	And they say World of Warcraft mixed together.
6161000	6165000	I don't know if I'd really call it that, but it's kind of cool.
6165000	6169000	You either get to take the side of the gang members or the police.
6169000	6176000	And then you can do missions where the early missions, any of the enemies that are in there are other players.
6176000	6183000	So as you're pulling bigger heists, you get more heat on you and then more of the police or whatever come after you.
6183000	6185000	So it's kind of cool.
6185000	6187000	But that will be coming out later on this year.
6187000	6190000	And I will definitely have to check that out since it's free to play.
6190000	6192000	Alright.
6192000	6195000	Not free, but still pretty cool nonetheless.
6195000	6197000	New DLC for Theatrhythm.
6197000	6201000	This is awesome because people were thinking Theatrhythm was kind of done with DLC.
6201000	6204000	I believe Square even came out and said we're done with DLC.
6204000	6208000	And then they started releasing a little more and people are eating it up.
6208000	6214000	And it's because they're doing music from other Square Enix games, which is doing very, very well.
6214000	6220000	Music from The World Ends With You came to Theatrhythm in this last DLC bundle.
6220000	6224000	Twister and Calling were two of the new tracks released for the 3DS game.
6225000	6228000	Let's see. Also, Liberi Fatali from Final Fantasy VIII.
6228000	6231000	Final Confrontation from Romancing Saga 3.
6231000	6239000	And World Revolution from Chrono Trigger as well as Wind Scene from Chrono Trigger all made its way into Theatrhythm.
6239000	6243000	So it's still giving Square money to release these songs.
6243000	6245000	So I wonder if we're going to see more and more and more.
6245000	6248000	Because who knows if that Dragon Quest Theatrhythm game is ever coming out here.
6248000	6250000	I don't know.
6250000	6252000	So yeah, that's pretty cool.
6252000	6256000	I have reason to be checking Theatrhythm every week.
6256000	6264000	I have reason to check Steam on February 5th because this cool little game, Castle in the Darkness, which is by Nasalis.
6264000	6265000	I hope I said that right.
6265000	6268000	It's the folks that made 1001 Spikes, which I know I've played that before.
6268000	6272000	But Castle in the Darkness will be coming out on February 5th.
6272000	6277000	It will be $6 and it's an action adventure game with damning difficulty.
6277000	6279000	Which doesn't surprise me whatsoever.
6279000	6283000	And I know some of y'all love your retro games with their damning difficulty.
6283000	6286000	Right, Dark Tetsuya? You listening? I know you're a fan.
6286000	6289000	Alright, many of you love your very hard retro games.
6289000	6291000	Many of you love your fighting games as well.
6291000	6294000	And I know many, many, many of you love to watch EVO.
6294000	6298000	So EVO 2015 is coming.
6298000	6302000	It's going to be happening with several fighting games.
6302000	6305000	Two of them being Smash Brothers related.
6305000	6308000	Smash Brothers Melee and Smash Brothers for Wii U.
6308000	6314000	Both a part of this July 17th through 19th at Bally's Las Vegas Casino.
6314000	6315000	Where this is going to happen.
6315000	6323000	That's pretty cool because you might remember last year, Nintendo was very much not really going to be a part of this.
6323000	6325000	Was it two years ago that they didn't do this?
6325000	6331000	Yeah, two years ago Nintendo wanted Melee out of the competition and then they got it back in this last year.
6331000	6335000	And now I think Nintendo, I want to say Nintendo is like a sponsor of this now.
6335000	6337000	That's why there's two of them in the games. That's pretty cool.
6337000	6342000	Some of the other fighting games involved, of course Ultra Street Fighter IV, of course Ultimate MVC3.
6342000	6352000	Mortal Kombat X will be in it, Tekken 7 will be in it, Guilty Gear XRD, Killer Instinct, and Persona 4 Arena Ultima X.
6352000	6353000	All going to be a part of this.
6353000	6358000	So a lot of fighting game fans are very excited for this coming up this July.
6359000	6361000	Alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?
6361000	6366000	Well, I've got some pretty, not really surprising stuff.
6366000	6371000	Amplitude actually is not going to be out in March like they said.
6371000	6375000	It has been delayed until summer for quality reasons.
6375000	6382000	So I would rather it be delayed and be awesome than come out in March and be crap and have all of us go, heh heh.
6382000	6385000	But we can wait.
6385000	6387000	The world can wait.
6387000	6392000	Also, Geoff Keighley says that the Game Awards will be back later this year.
6392000	6394000	No shit.
6397000	6399000	Well, they weren't so bad for a first year show.
6399000	6404000	I know we talked about it to death the week it happened, but you know, it did a lot of things right.
6404000	6411000	It wasn't perfect, but if they can bring back Roberta Williams one more time, and again, I would love that, but that probably won't happen.
6411000	6413000	They'll be on their yacht somewhere.
6414000	6419000	Also, now I know they pronounce it GLAAD, but because it has two A's, I always wanted to call it GLAAD.
6421000	6431000	Basically, they're giving a special recognition to BioWare for Dragon Age Inquisition for its representation of LGBT.
6431000	6436000	And I'm going to say Q, A, etc. characters in Dragon Age Inquisition.
6436000	6450000	Especially, I mean, if no one's played this game, there is probably one of the few positive depictions of a transgender character in a game.
6450000	6462000	And then, they also gave kudos to The Last of Us DLC Left Behind because of how it explored Ellie and Riley.
6462000	6464000	So, there you go.
6464000	6473000	And of course, the Dragon Age Twitter is like, hell yeah, thank you. Well, actually, they said, we are proud to be nominated for an at GLAAD Media Award.
6473000	6477000	But that's just PR speak for hell yeah.
6477000	6480000	Yeah, PR speak for damn right.
6480000	6484000	I can't say damn straight, I'm saying damn skippy.
6484000	6489000	Alright, let's go to our FUGL question of the week.
6495000	6505000	Every week, we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google communities over at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio and google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.
6505000	6510000	We ask a question and usually, when we have guests on the show, I like to theme the question around whoever our guest is.
6510000	6521000	So, tonight, of course, we had Eric from Rockedge S.J. and we were talking about, you know, what's coming up in a couple weeks here and why people should go to this music and retro gaming celebration.
6521000	6529000	Well, we asked our listeners this week, what has been your favorite convention or gamer gathering that you have ever attended and why?
6529000	6535000	And I want to make clear, it doesn't matter if it was a huge national thing like PAX or whatever or if it was like small local con.
6535000	6537000	So, I just want to know what was your favorite experience.
6537000	6545000	So, we have a few answers here and we have Fabrice A. who, as you know, is one of our listeners over in Belgium.
6545000	6552000	So, he responds and says, only been to PAX in Belgium. It's a sci-fi convention with some games on the side.
6552000	6555000	They did have six pinball machines this year, which was nice.
6555000	6558000	Also, some arcade cabinets and some retro game stuff.
6558000	6562000	Sadly, it's also the only convention that is anywhere near where I live.
6562000	6568000	Well, I'll tell you what, Fabrice, if we had the budget, I would bring the first O.L.R. Con to Belgium. I would.
6568000	6571000	Dark Soccer, you'd be down, right? O.L.R. Con in Belgium?
6571000	6573000	Will there be waffles?
6573000	6574000	Absolutely.
6574000	6575000	And Belgian ale?
6575000	6576000	Absolutely.
6576000	6579000	I want to actually go to a trappista brewery and get it right.
6579000	6584000	I want to go to the Chamay, I want to go talk to the monks at the Chamay place and have them give me beer.
6584000	6587000	Someday, right after I win the lottery. Someday.
6587000	6591000	Andy R. says, my first time at Fanime in 2006.
6591000	6595000	It helps that it was also, that was probably the last time we did a panel there was 2006.
6595000	6597000	No, it was later than that, but anyway.
6597000	6601000	My first time at Fanime, it helps that it was also my first anime convention overall.
6601000	6606000	I've been at Fanime every year since and I don't think it's ever quite captured the magic of my first time.
6606000	6610000	Doesn't help that the con has ballooned out of control and now has huge lines for everything now.
6610000	6614000	Flacco Jones replies and says, my first BlizzCon.
6614000	6616000	It was only the second BlizzCon ever.
6616000	6621000	Got to meet guildies in person and the closing concert was Video Games Live, who I'd never seen before.
6621000	6626000	It also wasn't as crowded since they only had about half the space they use now and the goodie bag was amazing.
6626000	6630000	Does sound like BlizzCon was really awesome back in its heyday, now it's too damn expensive.
6630000	6632000	That's my opinion.
6632000	6636000	Bryce H. replies and says, I have never attended a convention of any sort,
6636000	6641000	but I am trying to attend the Too Many Games convention in Philadelphia this June.
6641000	6642000	Well good luck, hope you make it.
6642000	6646000	Dartitsuya says, although I wouldn't consider it a gaming convention per se,
6646000	6653000	WonderCon 2010-2011 did have playable previews of games from the likes of Capcom and Nintendo.
6653000	6659000	Playing Final Fight Double Impact and Kid Icarus Uprising before their respective release dates was pretty awesome.
6659000	6665000	I think some people would consider things like Comic Con maybe one of the best things they've been to and that's not necessarily gaming.
6665000	6668000	One of my favorites was my first Dragon Con.
6668000	6674000	So that wasn't specifically gaming, but I had a great time on my first trip to Atlanta and last year too.
6674000	6680000	Let's see, going over to our Google Plus page and checking out some of the answers there.
6680000	6683000	I don't know if we had any responses over on Google Plus.
6686000	6690000	Did I not post to Google Plus? I thought I did.
6690000	6692000	Ooh, got dissed.
6692000	6695000	I dissed Google Plus this week inadvertently.
6695000	6696000	I'm sorry guys.
6696000	6699000	Forgetting my stories and then forgetting Google Plus.
6699000	6702000	I'm falling apart a week off and I can't do anything.
6702000	6706000	You know what I did? I bet I posted it on my personal.
6706000	6707000	I bet you did.
6708000	6710000	I bet anything that's what I did.
6710000	6714000	I probably posted it on my personal Google Plus page, not the OLR Google Plus page.
6714000	6717000	Womp womp. Oh well.
6717000	6718000	Oh Rob.
6718000	6719000	I know, I'm a failure.
6719000	6720000	Or you just didn't post it.
6720000	6721000	Or I just didn't post it.
6721000	6724000	I wrote the post all up and everything. What the hell?
6724000	6725000	I blame Google.
6725000	6727000	Dammit.
6727000	6730000	First, Ingress problems and now this.
6730000	6732000	I'm having some serious Google problems this week.
6732000	6734000	Sorry Google. I apologize.
6734000	6738000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, nobody uses Google Plus, not even Rob.
6738000	6743000	I swear I went and wrote the post there. I just didn't click submit or something.
6743000	6745000	What a fail on my part.
6745000	6749000	Well I apologize to all you guys that are loyal to Google Plus for forgetting you this week.
6749000	6751000	All two of you.
6751000	6757000	Next time, hey, next time if you notice I don't post the question by a certain time on Sunday, send me a tweet or something.
6757000	6759000	Or use Facebook.
6760000	6765000	Yeah, Darkticity in chat says, geez Rob, you take a week off and everything falls apart. Ain't that the truth?
6765000	6770000	DarkSoccer, you've probably been more cons than anyone else in the room. What was your favorite?
6770000	6772000	Good lord.
6772000	6777000	I would probably say the one that, I mean, I really loved Faname when Ranma came out. That was great.
6777000	6782000	I had a great, great time. Especially when he got to experience first hand my initial D driving.
6782000	6788000	But my favorite con all together was Anime Expo 2000.
6788000	6790000	That was at the Disneyland Hotel.
6790000	6794000	Where a bunch of cosplayers got kicked out of Disneyland for cosplaying at Disneyland.
6794000	6799000	And it was also my first experience with the DDR machine.
6799000	6803000	It was also the con of the chair.
6803000	6809000	Where basically it turned into a big joke the entire convention but there was a chair left up on the stage.
6809000	6814000	And everyone just started chanting for the chair. So they put a chair on the DDR machine.
6814000	6817000	And we had video of chair playing DDR.
6817000	6822000	We had, it was just a great con. The whole con was great.
6822000	6825000	I cosplayed as Jill Valentine.
6825000	6831000	And Mad Hatter from, no that wasn't the year I did Mad Hatter.
6831000	6833000	No, that was the year I did Jill.
6833000	6835000	And Leona from King of Fighters.
6835000	6837000	And walked around in combat boots.
6837000	6843000	And then I couldn't walk for the next three days because I was wearing somebody else's combat boots.
6843000	6845000	It was a great con.
6845000	6847000	Logie, what about you?
6847000	6851000	Probably the one year I went to PAX. That was fun.
6851000	6854000	I don't know, you're the first fan of me.
6854000	6858000	Because that was when I first saw DDR fourth mix.
6858000	6861000	You know, PAX probably would have been my answer too.
6861000	6864000	Because that was when we were still with All Games Network.
6864000	6867000	And we were doing the broadcasting with some of the other shows there.
6867000	6870000	All in part of actual PAX itself.
6870000	6875000	And it was really cool to kind of be spending the con kind of quote unquote working.
6875000	6878000	But it was really fun and kind of a new way to expose ourselves to a different audience.
6878000	6880000	So that was really fun. Just that whole experience.
6880000	6883000	And the fact that Logie, Dark Soccer and I all took that trip together.
6883000	6885000	And kind of all experienced that.
6885000	6887000	I don't know if we'll ever get to do something like that again.
6887000	6890000	So that was really cool that we got to do something like Penny Arcade Expo together.
6890000	6891000	That was 2008.
6891000	6894000	And that year was a real shit year for me personally.
6894000	6896000	Because that was the year I got really sick, remember?
6896000	6900000	PAX was in between when I went to the hospital and when I had the surgery.
6900000	6902000	So that was kind of a crap year for me personally.
6902000	6905000	But PAX was definitely a highlight of 08.
6905000	6907000	So I'll use my runner up answer.
6907000	6910000	Which would be, again a very similar experience, would be E3.
6910000	6912000	Which isn't really a con, I know.
6912000	6915000	But it's still what I'm going to say. Deal with it.
6915000	6919000	E3, the last big crazy year, which was 2006.
6919000	6922000	Even though there were way too many people at E3 itself.
6922000	6924000	I got to cut the Wii line, which was awesome.
6924000	6928000	And I'm thankful to my connection to this day for helping me do that.
6928000	6934000	And that was also, again, coming together with other shows.
6934000	6938000	When All Games had that arena lounge, well it wasn't theirs.
6938000	6941000	But they worked very closely with the guy at Arena Lounge.
6941000	6945000	It was like a giant frat house for video game stuff.
6945000	6948000	And that was a fun year. It was a lot of fun that year.
6948000	6951000	And again, you know, I think we all went.
6951000	6953000	I think we all went. Didn't you go that year too?
6953000	6954000	I went.
6954000	6956000	Yeah, we all went to that together. That was a lot of fun.
6956000	6960000	So you know, those days sadly are probably behind us.
6960000	6962000	Where all three of us get to go to these events and have a lot of fun.
6962000	6964000	Because we all have our own lives and stuff.
6964000	6967000	But those are some great memories. So that would be my answer.
6967000	6969000	That's why they have the update E3 on PSP.
6969000	6971000	Oh yes, was that that year too?
6971000	6972000	That was that year.
6972000	6975000	That was awesome. That was a great thing you did that year.
6975000	6981000	Alright, let's move on. We got some more gaming news to get to before we get to the mailbag and the FUs of the week.
6981000	6983000	PodCulture says, why not DragonCon? Shame on you.
6983000	6989000	I said that a minute ago during some of the other responses where somebody had said WonderCon.
6989000	6992000	I said, well DragonCon was one of my favorites.
6992000	6995000	And that really was one of my favorites too.
6995000	6999000	Alright, let's move on with some more news. Loki.
6999000	7004000	Alright, so I guess this is kind of sad for fans of Nintendo.
7004000	7006000	But they're getting rid of Club Nintendo.
7006000	7009000	Sorry, you're not cool enough to be in the club anymore.
7009000	7014000	But it really hasn't been what it used to be for a long time now.
7014000	7018000	They started skimping on with the rewards and everything.
7018000	7021000	I don't know, so now they're getting rid of that.
7021000	7032000	And apparently to go along with that they're also adding new rewards for downloadable games to help members clear out their coin balances.
7032000	7033000	That kind of thing.
7033000	7040000	And I guess you'll have until September 30th to use up those coins.
7040000	7043000	So that kind of sucks.
7043000	7046000	But they are going to be doing something else.
7046000	7049000	Some other loyalty program.
7049000	7051000	So I guess we'll have to see what that is.
7051000	7057000	It's interesting that this is coming on the heels of the Digital Deluxe promotion also ending.
7057000	7062000	So it really seems like a good time for Nintendo to hit the reset button on their loyalty program.
7062000	7064000	It'll be interesting to see what comes of it.
7064000	7069000	But you're right. A lot of people were giving the Club Nintendo thing shit when it was all the digital rewards.
7069000	7072000	And people were like, what happened to the cool limited stuff?
7072000	7075000	So obviously Nintendo probably has to change things a little bit.
7075000	7076000	So we'll see.
7076000	7079000	I wonder if Virtual Console games are going to play into the reward.
7079000	7083000	Like maybe the new reward system will just straight up be like Virtual Console Redemption.
7083000	7084000	Who knows?
7084000	7087000	Anything's possible, I suppose.
7088000	7092000	Gosh. Am I still able to cash in all the stuff I still have sitting around?
7092000	7094000	Until September.
7094000	7096000	Oh good. Then I'll have to do that.
7096000	7099000	Earlier in the show we were talking about Guild Wars.
7099000	7101000	Guild Wars 2 specifically.
7101000	7103000	Guild Wars 2 of course on a big sale this weekend.
7103000	7106000	And I keep meaning to go back and check out this game.
7106000	7111000	Because again it is nice that it's one of those games where once you bought it you can go back and play it whenever you want.
7111000	7114000	So I've been meaning to go back and check out some Guild Wars 2.
7114000	7117000	And it sounds like Dark Soccer might be meeting me there very soon.
7117000	7124000	But Guild Wars 2 is going to get a lot more interested people with the announcement of their first expansion.
7124000	7127000	Heart of Thorns was announced at PAX South.
7127000	7132000	Guild Wars 2 Heart of Thorns is going to be the first expansion for Guild Wars 2.
7132000	7137000	And it will be continuing of course the Guild Wars 2 storyline.
7137000	7141000	And it will be bringing out the mastery system.
7141000	7144000	New training opportunities for your character beyond level 80.
7144000	7150000	Master abilities like hang gliding in the jungle and building new collections that work towards a legendary weapon.
7150000	7153000	Something called the Heart of the Maguuma Jungle.
7153000	7156000	Specializations coming as well.
7156000	7158000	Revenant which is a new profession.
7158000	7160000	And Guild Halls will be coming to the game as well.
7161000	7163000	It's a new mode for PvP.
7163000	7170000	World vs. World place called the Borderland which is epic battlefield combat.
7170000	7173000	The Borderlands map is coming to the game as well.
7173000	7175000	Lots and lots coming to Guild Wars 2.
7175000	7180000	I haven't played that game since it first first came out and I imagine so much changed.
7180000	7184000	I know they do little additions to it here and there so I gotta check that out.
7185000	7187000	Pow in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says,
7187000	7192000	I've been playing Guild Wars 2 all day and watching Golden Girls in the background.
7192000	7194000	Hashtag not sorry.
7194000	7197000	You sound like you've honestly had the perfect day, Pow.
7197000	7199000	That might be a perfect day right there.
7199000	7201000	That's awesome.
7201000	7204000	Alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?
7204000	7206000	Well, I have creepy shit.
7206000	7208000	And by creepy shit I mean fucking creepy.
7208000	7210000	And awesome.
7210000	7220000	Basically, there's a team of German scientists called the Cognitive Modeling Group at the University of Tübingen in Germany.
7220000	7225000	And they have used an artificial intelligence to make Mario self aware.
7225000	7227000	Basically, he can think for himself.
7227000	7231000	It's called Mario Lives with an exclamation point.
7231000	7235000	And they've put a video up of them telling Mario,
7235000	7238000	If you jump on a Goomba, it will die.
7238000	7240000	What happens if you jump on a Goomba?
7240000	7242000	It will surely die.
7242000	7245000	Or he can figure it out for himself and he says,
7245000	7247000	The Goomba may die maybe.
7247000	7258000	So as it goes on, as he experiences things, he actually builds awareness of the world around him through how he experiences it or speaks to people.
7258000	7265000	And he also has emotive states that let him be happy or afraid or even hungry.
7265000	7267000	When he's hungry, he goes after coins.
7267000	7272000	It's just really kind of scary.
7272000	7276000	Did anyone try asking him when Mario Galaxy 3 would come out already?
7276000	7280000	Well, he'd know, right?
7280000	7282000	He's aware.
7282000	7284000	He's aware, isn't he?
7284000	7288000	In his environment of Super Mario World.
7288000	7292000	I think it's Super Mario World.
7292000	7296000	But the voice that they gave him is really creepy.
7296000	7300000	I would play some of it, but I'm not the one hooked up to the recorder.
7300000	7302000	Oh, I'm sorry. Was that a hint?
7302000	7304000	Am I supposed to play a little bit of this?
7304000	7308000	Well, there's a lot of narration through this video, too, so I don't know where the parts are where they actually have Mario talking.
7308000	7310000	It's not too far in, I don't think.
7310000	7312000	Let's see.
7312000	7314000	I'm trying to find you a timestamp.
7314000	7317000	This is a fantastic library.
7317000	7319000	Right around 22.
7319000	7321000	Alright, let's take a look here.
7321000	7323000	Hello, Mario.
7323000	7325000	Hello.
7325000	7327000	As most of you know, this is Mario.
7327000	7334000	But what you do not know is that this Mario has become aware of himself and his environment, at least to a certain extent.
7334000	7337000	I wonder how Mario feels about that.
7337000	7339000	Let's just ask.
7339000	7341000	Mario, how do you feel?
7341000	7343000	I feel very good.
7343000	7345000	Mario develops schema-based...
7345000	7347000	Okay!
7347000	7349000	Yeah.
7349000	7351000	Creepy! Creepy!
7353000	7355000	Mario is the new Cyberdyne.
7355000	7359000	We're going to all be stomped on by Italian plumbers.
7359000	7363000	ActDeftInChat says they should have hired Charles Martinet.
7363000	7367000	PowInChat says it sounds like Hal, so creepy.
7367000	7369000	I like that. That's great.
7369000	7375000	FifthDream says I'll be back. My princess is in another castle.
7375000	7377000	Oh, that would have been a good question to ask Mario.
7377000	7379000	Which castle is the princess in?
7379000	7381000	The answer?
7381000	7383000	Another one.
7383000	7385000	Is it this one?
7385000	7387000	DungeonBust...
7387000	7389000	Excuse me, I'm choking.
7389000	7393000	DungeonBusterInChat says I don't think you should be talking to the princess, Dave.
7395000	7397000	Alright, let's move on.
7397000	7399000	Lowkey.
7399000	7401000	Steam broadcasting.
7401000	7405000	That hasn't been around for a very long time, but now it's exited its beta.
7405000	7407000	Hooray!
7409000	7415000	The service will only broadcast gameplay video by default through players.
7415000	7423000	Though players can opt to stream a video of other apps on their computer, allowing them to broadcast other things like instructional videos and whatnot.
7425000	7427000	So that's kind of cool.
7427000	7433000	And it also records the audio that plays through the speakers on the broadcaster's computer.
7433000	7435000	I don't know. Exciting stuff.
7435000	7443000	So they're saying that basically you can use this kind of like Twitch now and not just stream games, but you can also kind of stream yourself, which is neat.
7443000	7445000	Oh, they finally put the camera stuff in there?
7445000	7451000	Well, not the camera stuff, but it says that you can stream other apps other than just games.
7451000	7453000	Wasn't that how people were streaming porn and stuff?
7453000	7461000	It was. They were playing Windows Media Player and streaming things like anime and porn and stuff.
7461000	7463000	I don't know if maybe they blocked that or what they did.
7463000	7469000	Well, you know, it's inevitable there's going to be porn.
7469000	7471000	There's always going to be porn.
7471000	7475000	Alright, are you going to experiment by broadcasting anything on Steam broadcasting?
7475000	7477000	That means I play my Steam butt.
7477000	7479000	Maybe eventually someday.
7479000	7483000	I have mine on whenever I play Steam games. I have it so that only friends can look at it.
7483000	7489000	I did turn it off when I was doing Five Nights at Freddy's because sometimes I want it to stream through Twitch.
7489000	7493000	But if you see me on Steam playing games, you can always watch.
7493000	7497000	It doesn't mean I'm going to commentate and entertain. You can just peek at the game.
7497000	7499000	I'll buy you the second one if you stream it while I'm watching.
7500000	7505000	I actually, Loki got it for me for, oh wait, 13, oh sorry, Five Nights at Freddy's.
7505000	7508000	The last game I streamed on Steam was Final Fantasy 13.
7508000	7510000	So Loki got me Final Fantasy 13 too.
7510000	7512000	But I do not have Five Nights at Freddy's 2.
7512000	7518000	But if you'd like to donate that to the Watch Rob Play Scary Games Fund, then I guess I'll take it.
7518000	7523000	Oh no, Dark Soccer is wiggling your eyebrows at me. Uh oh. Uh oh. Alright.
7523000	7526000	I want you to play it while eating.
7526000	7527000	Yeah.
7527000	7528000	That's going to be hilarious.
7528000	7530000	Only if I can eat cheap pizza.
7530000	7533000	Cheap pizza. You have to do it while eating Little Caesars.
7533000	7534000	Yeah.
7534000	7536000	That itself is scary.
7536000	7541000	No, no, no, no. What you should do is you should have to actually go down to Chuck E. Cheese and order pizza.
7541000	7544000	Who gets pizza from Chuck E. Cheese to go?
7544000	7547000	That's it. I'll put Five Nights at Freddy's 2 on my laptop.
7547000	7548000	There are people.
7548000	7550000	You will play it on my computer at Chuck E. Cheese's.
7550000	7551000	Alright, fine.
7551000	7552000	And we'll stream it.
7552000	7553000	Fine.
7554000	7557000	Marissa Congusto is in our chat saying, uh, back in my day-
7557000	7558000	I love you Marissa!
7558000	7562000	Me too. Back in my day we only had porn animated gifs and we liked it.
7562000	7563000	That's right.
7563000	7571000	That's where, that'd be a great location, well if they probably haven't bulldozed the place, which I'm sure they have, but like, you know, um, Bullwinkles.
7571000	7572000	You know.
7572000	7576000	Cause that place is still all retro-y and have the old animatronics.
7577000	7588000	Alright, well, anyway, um, I'm trying to move on to another story here, but unfortunately, uh, my, uh, Firefox crashed on me while I was trying to pull up this next story.
7588000	7589000	Damn you Firefox.
7589000	7590000	What?
7590000	7591000	The damn you Firefox.
7591000	7592000	That's what you get for not using Chrome.
7592000	7598000	Pro- pretty much. I think I might need to put Chrome on this computer actually. I'm a little worried about it.
7598000	7602000	Anyway, uh, okay, good. I was able to reopen all the tabs right where I left off.
7602000	7605000	So, uh, anyway, uh, here's the thing.
7605000	7610000	Is that I try to be as impartial as possible on this show.
7610000	7613000	You know, I try to keep an open mind to all the video games.
7613000	7619000	And I try not to fanboy out too much about any one particular franchise or game or so forth.
7619000	7624000	But once in a while there's gonna be that developer who announces a new game.
7624000	7631000	And sure enough that happened this week where Sid Meier has announced a new game called Starships.
7631000	7633000	And I couldn't help myself.
7643000	7647000	Yep. Not gonna lie. I'll probably buy it just because it has Sid Meier's names on it.
7647000	7653000	But look, the guy did, the guy did Railroad Tycoon. He did Civilization.
7653000	7655000	I even will defend Covert Action.
7656000	7659000	Sid Meier does a lot, a lot of great stuff.
7659000	7664000	So of course I'm gonna check out the new game Starships, which I'd love to tell you more about.
7664000	7669000	But it's crashing my computer consistently here, the page here.
7669000	7672000	So I do know it's a turn-based strategy game.
7672000	7680000	I have heard that it's supposed to tie in somehow to the Beyond Earth, Civilization Beyond Earth.
7680000	7684000	It's supposed to tie into that somehow, although they haven't said a lot about how that's gonna work.
7684000	7690000	It will be coming out for PC, Mac, and iPad, and it's actually coming out this year.
7690000	7696000	So I'm excited to learn more about this game. I'm sure they're gonna show plenty more at E3 about this game.
7696000	7701000	Anybody else interested in Sid Meier's games like I am? Anybody?
7701000	7702000	Chirp.
7702000	7703000	No?
7703000	7704000	Chirp.
7704000	7707000	Anybody in chat? Somebody's gotta be.
7707000	7708000	Chirp, chirp.
7708000	7712000	Rob, I'm sure you will find other people who enjoy these games as much as you do.
7712000	7718000	I know, I know. Well, Starships anyway was based on Sid Meier wanting to extend the Beyond Earth setting,
7718000	7724000	where he says this is gonna be a further narrative of the game, where you'll be able to explore the universe,
7724000	7728000	and you'll encounter other human colonies and whatever those colonies may hold.
7728000	7733000	This game will focus on starship creation, meaning that your ships are gonna be very configurable,
7733000	7740000	and there'll be space combat, of course, and so there'll be a universe filled with interstellar adventure, diplomacy, and exploration.
7740000	7746000	So this sounds like it's gonna be awesome. So it sounds a little bit like maybe like if Civ was in space,
7746000	7750000	as opposed to just on the planet's surface, like you see happen in Beyond Earth.
7750000	7756000	And yes, they are saying there will be cross-connectivity features with Beyond Earth if you own both titles.
7756000	7761000	So that's very, very cool. So I'm excited to check in that out, Sid Meier's Starships.
7761000	7766000	Nothing to do with the Nicki Minaj song, just so we're clear. Just so we're clear.
7766000	7771000	Alright, let's move on. What do we have next? Is Mailbag coming up next, I think?
7771000	7772000	I guess.
7772000	7774000	Alright, so every week...
7774000	7775000	It's crunchy this time.
7775000	7778000	I don't know, because my show roll closed when Firefox crashed.
7778000	7780000	So anyway...
7780000	7782000	Oh, what, you want the music?
7782000	7784000	No, I don't care.
7789000	7794000	Every week, you guys send us email to participate at orangeloungeradio.com,
7794000	7799000	and DarkSakura will dive into the mailbag and find an email or four that she thinks,
7799000	7804000	hey, I'm going to read these, and we're going to respond to them right after I judge them.
7804000	7806000	Damn it, why are you sending long ones?
7806000	7807000	Alright.
7807000	7808000	Thanks for the warning.
7808000	7809000	You can always edit the long ones.
7809000	7810000	Yeah, whatever.
7810000	7812000	Alright, here it is.
7812000	7816000	DarkSakura, what is in the mailbag? It's had two weeks to build up, so I imagine there's a little bit in there tonight.
7816000	7817000	All four of them?
7817000	7819000	That's twice what we usually get.
7819000	7820000	Welcome back.
7820000	7824000	I apologize that my last scenario came across as more perverse than intended.
7824000	7825000	Oh, yes.
7825000	7827000	Especially as posed to relative strangers.
7827000	7835000	The hypothetical nudity was gratuitous, but meant less as sexy and more as starting out with absolutely nothing,
7835000	7837000	which we figured out.
7837000	7843000	Perhaps I could have specified basic clothes that offered no significant protection from the elements or pockets,
7843000	7845000	but never mind that now.
7845000	7855000	My family uses 120GB PlayStation 3, which I believe I purchased about the year of the collector's edition of the original LittleBigPlanet 2009,
7855000	7862000	as their Netflix console and will sometimes leave it powered on or accidentally turn it back on for extended periods of time.
7862000	7870000	Whether this is causing any harm, I'm not sure, but more and more frequently my system is starting up with a warning of improper shutdown
7870000	7877000	and performing a check for possible corrupted files, or I am prompted to reset the system clock and the theme.
7877000	7884000	I have had a flashing yellow power light in one case, requiring me to power down or power back up by unplugging the console.
7884000	7893000	I'm worried that the system will stop working altogether sooner rather than later, and I know I'm not ready to upgrade to a PS4 with a library of PS3 games I have.
7893000	7909000	I have a few purchased episodes of Mythbusters on it, and remember Reginator's Trouble with video licenses, but I haven't purchased enough episodes for it to be a major concern if I lose access to those.
7909000	7918000	I am seriously considering getting a Vita as a current gen portable console, and do have several cross-buy titles that I could port over.
7918000	7929000	I will be going on a major vacation in June, and that would help somewhat. Would my money be better used, though, upgrading and moving content over to a 500GB PS3, especially considering Vita memory card prices?
7929000	7941000	Would replacing the hard drive give the system new life? Should I try to find somewhere to service the console I have, ideally someone who wouldn't try to create a cooling baffle by taping pizza coupons inside?
7941000	7952000	Or are the issues I've described somehow less serious than I fear? This is well out of warranty, so sending it to Sony probably wouldn't help. Thank you for any advice you're able to offer, except for my iPod Robert M.
7952000	7959000	I wouldn't repair it. I'd get a new PS3.
7959000	7966000	I would suggest either the new PlayStation 3. They are coming way down in price, so you might be able to find one for a pretty good deal.
7967000	7975000	One option that you left out was the PlayStation TV. Those are only $80 right now. I saw one at Target the other day.
7975000	7984000	You wouldn't be able to take that on your trip, but if you're considering going the Vita route and you want to still have some of your video licenses and so forth, that may be one option for you.
7984000	7990000	I just noticed you left that out, and it's a pretty cheap alternative, so that's just an idea. It would be a PlayStation TV.
7990000	7999000	Although, of course, I am hearing mixed things on that, but again, your video licenses. I thought all you would have to do is log in and you could just re-download those things.
7999000	8002000	Yeah, it is. That's all you have to do. You literally have to just...
8002000	8005000	But remember, Raginator had gigs and gigs and gigs of stuff.
8005000	8009000	Raginator is also a special snowflake. Heart, heart, heart.
8009000	8012000	Yeah, he's going to Sony Entertainment Store, and you can...
8012000	8032000	Well, what you probably want to do first... Well, actually, what I had to do of mine is you basically revoke all the licenses on your system, so it basically detaches your account from all the systems, and then you just go back on there and reconnect it to the new system that you get, and then you can just download all your content.
8032000	8044000	I think, too, something you need to consider is how much are you playing those PS3 games, and are there more that you plan on playing, because the amount of new PlayStation 3 games is going to slow down significantly, because they are really shifting focus.
8044000	8045000	It already has, yeah.
8045000	8056000	Yeah, they're already shifting focus to PlayStation 4. I mean, that Kingdom Hearts 2.5, that was like the last big thing coming out for PlayStation 3 that I know of. Is there anything in the near future that's coming out?
8056000	8070000	Well, there's still plenty of games that are coming out that are going to have PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game, but less and less of them are, and it's becoming less and less like, you know, Dying Light was originally supposed to have a PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 version, and then they cancelled it.
8070000	8081000	I think, well, currently, I think that Mad Max is supposed to have that. I don't know.
8081000	8107000	You might want to consider, too, I know you say you're not quite ready for PlayStation 4, but you might want to consider, see what happens at E3, especially if the system may get that price cut, because I think what would really be unfortunate is that, let's say in a couple months you get a PlayStation 3, and then all of a sudden at E3, they announce that game that you have to have on PlayStation 4 and all that, but I do certainly see the point about you're worried about your PlayStation 3 library, you can't play it on the 4, which, you know, is very frustrating, believe me.
8108000	8123000	So I get that end of it, where you want to be able to still play those games, so I think you really have to kind of ask, like, you know, how important are those games for you to continue to keep playing, and if you really want to get them and still play them, I think you should consider just investing in the new PS3.
8123000	8129000	They're getting cheaper and cheaper. How much are they these days? Cheaper than $1.99 at this point, aren't they, or are they still $1.99?
8129000	8131000	Yeah, they're definitely cheaper than that.
8131000	8133000	They didn't buy it back for very much, that's for sure.
8133000	8135000	Yeah, so there you go.
8135000	8145000	All right. Sorry, I just, I have to get out this tangential thing about issues happening with PlayStations, because my PlayStation 4 has started doing something very strange that's a little bit concerning.
8145000	8159000	Loki, have you heard anything about this? So I will put my PlayStation 4 into rest mode, and the little yellow light comes up and it's in rest mode, right? Does its thing. Sometime overnight, it will shut off completely.
8159000	8172000	Like, rest mode will kick out and it shuts off completely, and when I boot it up again the next day, which I can't do for my controller, I have to go to the console and push the power button on Switch, it will yell at me for not shutting it down properly the last time.
8172000	8174000	So you should shut it down each time.
8174000	8184000	Well, I leave mine in rest mode, and here's the thing though, that's not even a necessary problem for me. What I have as a problem is my digital games will sometimes crash in the middle of them.
8184000	8192000	I have that happen a lot. Like, you know, even Lego Marvel Super Heroes will do it. I've had it with Gad out of Hell just randomly, oop, stop. No reason.
8192000	8194000	This is concerning to me. What?
8194000	8198000	I would like to say that I have never, ever had problems with any of my Sony products.
8198000	8201000	Hahaha, be careful what you wish for.
8201000	8216000	Except for when our very, very first model PlayStation, after being used for about three years, we had to start using it upside down, and then we did the sideways way, and then we got a new one. Those happened.
8216000	8230000	But we have a first edition Japanese PS2 that still works perfectly. We have a first edition US PS2 that still runs perfectly, and a first edition PS3 that still runs perfectly.
8230000	8240000	So, all I can say is just, then again, you guys know how careful Dan is with everything. We shut the system off when we're done with it.
8240000	8247000	Fifth Dream in chat says mine does that too, and it's frustrating when I'm trying to charge my headphones or controller. I really think there's an issue there.
8247000	8253000	Because remember, after the last patch, there was a big issue with rest mode that they supposedly fixed. My concern is they didn't really fix it.
8254000	8263000	And let's see, Tiger Claw suggests it could be a power outage like a flicker. But if that was the case, everything else on that strip, like the Wii U and the TV, they would all be giving me issues.
8263000	8269000	The TV would reset everything internally, so I don't think that's it. I mean, that's a thought, but I don't think that's it.
8269000	8275000	And let's see, Locked on Gamer in chat mentioning some other PlayStation 3 games coming out this year.
8275000	8279000	Tales of Zestiria, Persona 5, and Yakuza 5, still to look forward to.
8279000	8286000	Persona 5 is going to be on PlayStation 4 as well, though, right? So there's at least both. I don't know about those other two games, but I know about Persona.
8286000	8291000	Anyhow, a lot of chat on that email. Sorry, Jamie. We're ready for the next one.
8291000	8298000	Hello, everyone. I've been listening to the podcast for about a year now, and you guys have made my commutes on Monday much better.
8298000	8301000	Just thought I'd email a few questions for you all.
8301000	8305000	What new worlds from Disney would you like to see included in Kingdom Hearts 3?
8305000	8309000	I'd love to see Treasure Planet, Big Hero 6, and The Incredibles in the next one.
8309000	8316000	I feel like having an Avengers or Star Wars world would be cool, but I'm not too sure they'd translate well, and I agree with you, by the way.
8316000	8325000	Also, now that you've been airing Orange Launch Radio for almost 13 years, I'd like to know what is the most shocking piece of gaming news you have ever discussed on the show.
8325000	8327000	Keep up the great work, Chris.
8327000	8336000	Okay, the first question. Areas in Kingdom Hearts I'd want to see. Tron, Tron, and more Tron.
8336000	8337000	Amen.
8337000	8339000	Even though I know we got that in Kingdom Hearts 2.
8339000	8341000	I don't care. It's not enough.
8341000	8342000	It's not enough. More Tron.
8342000	8346000	I want Tron Hearts. King Tron Hearts.
8346000	8356000	That's right. If for whatever reason I was denied my Tron, maybe Wall-E. I want to see more of Pixar. I love Wall-E, so I think I'd want to see a Wall-E world.
8356000	8362000	I have no idea how the hell that would work in Kingdom Hearts lore. I'm not going to write the script. I'm just going to tell you what I want.
8362000	8363000	I know what I want, and it would never happen.
8363000	8364000	What?
8364000	8365000	But I'd want the Black Cauldron.
8365000	8368000	I think that would be really rad, actually. I think there are people that would want that.
8368000	8372000	Or a full Fantasia level. Like, where you have the dancing hippos and everything.
8372000	8375000	Ooh, Disney owns the Muppets now. I want a fucking Muppets level.
8375000	8380000	And then I want other Jim Henson shit, like Labyrinth. I want a fucking Labyrinth level.
8380000	8387000	I'm going to stop for a second. And I want them to keep Kingdom Hearts to just the Disney actual licenses.
8387000	8399000	I don't want the Pixar licenses. I don't want the Marvel. I don't want the Muppets. I don't want Star Wars. I want my Kingdom Hearts to be Disney in square.
8399000	8405000	Fine. Then Dark Tetsuya in chat, I like this, says, how about a Wreck-It Ralph world? Fine. I'm great with that.
8405000	8408000	I would totally be down for that.
8408000	8413000	I actually really love that idea and think it would work very well. So, fingers crossed.
8413000	8417000	But isn't Wreck-It Ralph kind of already like Kingdom Hearts?
8417000	8418000	Well, in a way.
8418000	8420000	Would they go to different game universes?
8420000	8426000	They could set it in Vanellope's go-karting world, where a lot of the movie took place anyway.
8426000	8429000	So it's more like they just visit Candy Rush.
8429000	8430000	Yeah, Sugar Rush.
8430000	8432000	Sugar Rush, whatever.
8432000	8433000	Alright, anyway.
8433000	8434000	What were you going to say?
8434000	8436000	Loki? How about you?
8436000	8446000	Like the, what, world I'd want? I don't know. Like, gargoyles?
8446000	8452000	Ooh! Gummy Bears! We have a gummy bear level for the gummy ship.
8452000	8457000	What about like DuckTales or like fucking Darkwing Duck or something?
8457000	8459000	Alright, I like the way you're thinking. It's awesome.
8459000	8461000	I could deal with the Darkwing Duck level.
8461000	8466000	Alright, AkumaJP says, no fucking Muppets, please. How dare you. How very dare you.
8466000	8467000	Alright.
8467000	8469000	Next email?
8469000	8471000	No, because we have that other question that's very important.
8471000	8473000	Shocking stuff.
8473000	8477000	What is the most shocking piece of gaming news you've ever discussed on a show?
8477000	8481000	Wow, I have to really think about this. I mean, I'm sure there's something.
8481000	8485000	You know what comes to mind? In all honestly, you know what comes to mind?
8485000	8489000	Remember when the, and this was like kind of local news that went national.
8489000	8491000	And there was that gal.
8491000	8492000	Oh yeah, the water.
8492000	8494000	See, that's all I had to say.
8494000	8497000	That drank, it was the hold your wee for a wee contest.
8497000	8500000	And she drank all that water.
8500000	8503000	And you know, the radio station was kind of being irresponsible.
8503000	8504000	And that was like a-
8504000	8505000	Kind of.
8505000	8507000	Well, you know, okay, sorry.
8507000	8510000	Being very irresponsible because a doctor called in and fucking told him.
8510000	8513000	Like, this is really not healthy, right? And shouldn't be doing this.
8513000	8518000	And so unfortunately this gal passed away and she was trying to win a wee for her kids.
8518000	8524000	And I think just the brazen stupidity of the morning show crew and what they did.
8524000	8529000	Well, I have to say she did have a degree of responsibility because you should know better.
8529000	8535000	Yes, but I kind of refuse to blame her for that situation either. Especially when she was doing it for her kids.
8535000	8542000	I, no, no, no. She did something stupid. They did something stupid by enabling her.
8542000	8543000	Yeah.
8543000	8547000	I put them more at responsibility. However, she did decide to participate.
8547000	8551000	Right, but I like the way you used the word enabled. They enabled it.
8551000	8556000	Yeah, but people have to realize that the blame also goes to the person making the decision.
8556000	8557000	Right.
8557000	8558000	There is a degree.
8558000	8561000	Right. But anyway, but yeah, all this debate and everything.
8561000	8566000	I mean, and the fact that that lady lived less than a mile from where we did OLR at the time.
8566000	8568000	I mean, that's how local this thing was.
8569000	8573000	So that was that was kind of shocking, I think, in a way.
8573000	8576000	By the way, Akuma JP says no Muppet porn, please. I mean, LOL.
8576000	8595000	Oh, that's fine. And I think that all kind of goes with how like crazy people went for the Wii and the shortages and just everything that went with that when Nintendo was kind of runner up for a while, you know, and may have slipped back in that position a little bit, even though, you know, a lot of us still cheer him on.
8595000	8604000	So we have to blame the tenant for that, because they hadn't produced enough quantities, and they wouldn't have everybody, you know, yeah, doing contests to try to win one.
8604000	8610000	So anyway, I don't know that that's what comes to mind. I don't know if you guys I mean, 13 years, we've talked about a lot of stuff on this show.
8610000	8613000	But just like shocking. I don't know. That's the one that comes to mind for me.
8613000	8614000	I can think of one.
8614000	8615000	What's that easy?
8615000	8618000	E3 last year, or was it?
8619000	8626000	Yes, E3 last year with one that did the whole PlayStation four thing. They were kind of rebuttal to the whole Xbox One stance.
8626000	8628000	Oh, that was two years ago.
8628000	8629000	Oh, that was a mic drop moment.
8629000	8632000	Oh, yeah, that was two years ago. Yeah. Okay.
8632000	8638000	That was a huge Yeah, when they just basically punched Microsoft in the face live on stage.
8638000	8640000	That was just like, whoa,
8640000	8650000	that that was, I think what a lot of us kind of live for any three moments. I mean, Sony versus Microsoft and those sorts of biases that people inevitably think we have a side.
8650000	8658000	I just think that was a really truly like shocking like this. This is why I watch press conferences kind of moment, you know,
8658000	8668000	I will honestly say that there's not too much I found shocking. And maybe it's just being jaded. Maybe it's not having a very high opinion of most other people in the world.
8668000	8672000	But after a while, you know, especially I'm going to put it this way,
8672000	8683000	especially if you've been in the design business and you start seeing what goes into branding and what goes into production and what goes into the presentation that these companies try to make,
8683000	8687000	it really stops being shocking or well, I guess it wasn't that big.
8687000	8692000	But like, remember when was it when they announced 14? I remember there's one.
8692000	8694000	Oh, no, it was 14, I think.
8694000	8697000	It was surprising, but it wasn't a shock.
8697000	8702000	Well, we all thought he meant to say 13, too, was what he was going to be talking about or whatever.
8702000	8708000	What 13, the one that became 15 was the one he was supposed to be talking about. 13 versus. That's it.
8708000	8711000	No, Agito is what became a zero.
8711000	8715000	Yeah. Yeah. So SSG100Matt has a very good answer for this.
8715000	8721000	And I'll leave it at this because I like this answer is very interesting about how the real world sometimes comes into play.
8721000	8731000	SSG100Matt says, truthfully, I think one of the biggest moments in OLR history was when you guys announced the early reports of the death of Bin Laden.
8731000	8738000	How you guys were able to keep it together during all of that and still do a show was really something that happened live on show.
8738000	8743000	That's right. That whole, you know, sometimes world news goes on like things that are bigger than.
8743000	8747000	I think I had like my BBC feed.
8747000	8753000	That was at your house. I want to say it was when the studio was at your house and the news came in live on air that that had happened.
8753000	8756000	And Obama was about to give the speech, like while we were doing the show.
8756000	8762000	So, yes, sometimes things happen in the real world that are more important than games.
8762000	8767000	And we can't help but kind of get on to it is live. It is live.
8767000	8774000	And even though we try to keep the focus on games, there's just things that are going to be that are bigger than that are going to distract us once in a while.
8774000	8780000	There's actually something that Dan used to say when we were still in our online phase. Real life must intrude.
8780000	8783000	Yeah. Ain't that the truth? Ain't that the truth?
8783000	8790000	And certainly I think we've all had big personal moments on this show, too, that have, you know, kind of crossed into that as well.
8790000	8793000	So we've we've grown up with you over the past 13 years.
8793000	8799000	I just more reserve shock for something that isn't.
8799000	8804000	I guess. Yeah, no one's like walked into studio and flash their tits or anything that I can think of.
8804000	8807000	That's not even shocking. That's that's a welcome event.
8807000	8811000	Or drop their pants, to be fair.
8811000	8815000	Because when you say shock in radio, it makes me think shock jock like Howard Stern.
8815000	8817000	And I'm going to ask you about your sex life.
8817000	8819000	He's very shocked. That's not even shocking anymore.
8819000	8820000	It's not anymore.
8820000	8824000	It's like I hate tits in my studio.
8824000	8833000	In the Internet age, it's not shocking anymore because there's there's complete podcasts out there that will talk about like a friend of mine online used to do a show all about gay sex.
8833000	8838000	And it was very, very explicit, like way more than what you would hear on any of these other shows.
8838000	8842000	So it's like I kind of feel like because any old idiot can pick up a mic and do a show now.
8842000	8846000	Hey, how you doing? It's kind of softened the blow of some of these other big shows.
8846000	8850000	But like Howard Stern in the 90s, dude, nobody was doing things that shocking.
8850000	8855000	And as we keep going, you know, we do I guess it goes back to the jaded thing.
8855000	8859000	You know, we things we get a little bit more hardened to certain things.
8859000	8870000	But I will say, like, if I got news today right now that said that Miyamoto was in a car accident, I would call that a shock.
8870000	8872000	Bite your tongue. Bite your tongue.
8872000	8877000	Well, I'm just saying, you know, when the earthquake happened in Japan.
8877000	8885000	Yeah, I had I had friends there. You know, we all have friends, you know, listeners to, you know, who were experiencing that.
8885000	8893000	And during Hurricane Katrina, I had people that I knew, you know, in person who were listeners to the show and my good friends.
8893000	8899000	So it's more of the real world stuff, I think, that I find more of an impact.
8899000	8902000	I'll say impact because it may not be a shock, but it's an impact.
8902000	8905000	So we're dragging this out way too long. But I've got one more answer.
8905000	8908000	This is really good. I got one more answer because you guys you guys will all find this shocking.
8908000	8912000	OK. And I can't believe nobody in chat said this yet.
8912000	8922000	The night that we were doing OLR at the garage studio and the video card on the machine went out and the whole show dropped or something that I don't remember what happened.
8922000	8926000	And somebody in chat and I don't even remember what it was exactly.
8926000	8931000	It was said it was some fucking comment that got really under my skin and we worked it out after the fact it was misunderstanding.
8931000	8934000	But he said some comment that really got under my skin and I just fucking lost it.
8934000	8935000	Rob had his DevaFit.
8935000	8938000	I had a DevaFit and I went off the air. And here's the thing. It's not on the pot.
8938000	8940000	Like you're probably like, oh, I want to hear that.
8940000	8944000	You can't because we lost the show because the computer failed partway through the show.
8944000	8947000	So we lost it. So I had this big DevaFit.
8947000	8953000	But with SSG100 Matt talking about picking up the show and just carrying on, Loki bless his heart.
8953000	8957000	I storm out of the studio. I'm just like, you know, fuck it. I'm out.
8957000	8961000	And Loki goes, alrighty then. Well, next in the news we got.
8964000	8969000	And I think I came in like 20 minutes later while Loki's tried to do this.
8969000	8973000	I just pick up the mic and I cut off whatever he's talking about. I got something to say.
8975000	8977000	That was a shocking moment.
8977000	8982000	And Travis Donovan to this day says that was my best moment ever on this program.
8983000	8984000	Anyhow.
8984000	8987000	I think I might have just zoned out during that whole thing.
8987000	8990000	Because I was like, what? What?
8990000	8992000	Yeah, you were definitely here that week.
8992000	8994000	I was there, but I think I was like, what?
8994000	8997000	Yeah, what's happening? Rob doesn't do this. What is happening?
8997000	9000000	Brain malfunction. Processing error.
9000000	9002000	0010 something.
9003000	9005000	So next email. Hello, OLR.
9006000	9009000	How important do you think exclusive games are to consoles?
9009000	9013000	Did the Halo collection on Xbox One really have that big an impact?
9013000	9015000	Or was it the lower price of the console?
9015000	9020000	Maybe I have a wrong view on such things, but I believe exclusive games just don't have that much of an impact anymore.
9020000	9023000	As always, thanks a lot for doing a show nearly every week.
9023000	9025000	Fabrice from Belgium.
9026000	9030000	I really don't think they have too big of an impact because people are going to make their decisions anyway.
9030000	9033000	And honestly, I don't think Halo is a very good comparison.
9033000	9039000	Because honestly, people, if they're going to play the Halo series, are pretty much already the Microsoft fanboy.
9040000	9041000	Mostly.
9041000	9046000	I think exclusives are still somewhat important.
9046000	9048000	I think they're important for the company, certainly.
9048000	9050000	Because that's what's going to sway your decision.
9050000	9052000	Because I have to admit, I really want an Xbox One.
9052000	9055000	Because there are a lot of games over there right now that I can't play on PlayStation 4.
9055000	9061000	But I also want a PlayStation 4 because there's some games there that I want to play that I have a PlayStation 4.
9061000	9063000	I already made my decision.
9063000	9067000	And to be fair, mostly I bought it because it was the cheaper option.
9067000	9070000	And I knew that Final Fantasy XIV was going to be on it.
9070000	9073000	And even though I played it on PC, I thought, oh, the console experience will be good too.
9073000	9075000	And I don't regret that decision whatsoever.
9075000	9078000	I think Sony's done a good job with the PlayStation 4.
9078000	9082000	Even if it was a little light on exclusives this past holiday.
9082000	9089000	But I still want an Xbox One because I think those exclusives, not so much the Halo collection because of the very tepid feedback that got.
9089000	9094000	But things like Forza Horizon, Quantum Break, Killer Instinct, and some of the other exclusives.
9094000	9097000	I mean, they've got quite a handful at this point.
9097000	9101000	And I think it does make you look twice at the Xbox.
9101000	9107000	But maybe, and I think this is important to look at, not so much Xbox One versus Sony.
9107000	9112000	But exclusives are what is keeping the Wii U with a heartbeat right now.
9112000	9118000	And yes, it is because probably, and I'm not sure, is anybody going to argue with me on this?
9118000	9125000	The greatest studio that makes games, Nintendo, has the best track record, it makes the best games.
9125000	9130000	They're not all perfect, but I swear to God, they do probably the best games most consistently.
9130000	9135000	Nintendo's probably the greatest game development studio, but they only make games for their own console.
9135000	9137000	And that's what keeps it afloat.
9137000	9145000	No, I think that's just because they make good games, but at the same time, really that's all you're buying on that console because there's no one else supporting it.
9145000	9147000	I mean, third party anymore.
9148000	9155000	You'll get the really cheap-ass licensed games and stuff like that for kids, but you're not going to get any serious stuff.
9155000	9159000	Maybe some indie games, but indie games are across all platforms nowadays.
9159000	9162000	So that's, I think, really it.
9162000	9170000	I mean, yeah, Nintendo games are great, but they're also kind of all you have to play on that system.
9171000	9175000	So, anyway, that's all our thoughts on exclusives there.
9175000	9178000	So, there you go.
9178000	9181000	And thank you for listening just about every week to the show.
9181000	9183000	You guys help us keep going.
9183000	9186000	Darsakha, I don't know if you have anything to add or if we're ready for the next email.
9186000	9187000	There's one more email.
9187000	9188000	All right.
9188000	9189000	Hello, LR.
9189000	9199000	I found something on my Japanese 3DS this weekend that seems one part interesting, one part ingenious, and at least three parts horrifying, so I figured I'd share it with everyone.
9199000	9205000	This is Nintendo's latest experiment in finding new ways to extract money from their legions of loyal fans.
9205000	9209000	It just looked like an innocent free app on the eShop that came out about a month ago.
9209000	9215000	I watched the intro video, which I will link to now, which I can't play reading email.
9215000	9221000	It begins by showing that 3DS users have the ability to customize their home menus by using stamps.
9221000	9222000	I know exactly.
9222000	9227000	Funny enough, when Shane brought his new 3DS over this week, he was telling me about this.
9227000	9229000	So I'm aware of where this email is going.
9229000	9230000	But go ahead, please.
9230000	9231000	Pretty cool, right?
9231000	9239000	The stamps can be stuck wherever a game or app isn't, and most are Mario themed, Animal Crossing themed, or similarly Nintendo themed.
9239000	9247000	Along with stamps, there are also icon replacements for some of the more commonly used apps, like System Settings, Street Pass, Mii Plaza, and Activity Log.
9247000	9249000	Excuse me.
9250000	9252000	Just how these stamps and icons obtained?
9252000	9258000	By winning them out of UFO catchers, AKA crane machines that work identically to those in arcades all across Japan.
9258000	9260000	Hold the A button to send the crane to the left.
9260000	9261000	Let GoToWatchIt drop.
9261000	9265000	Hope that one or more prizes wind up falling into the prize area.
9265000	9268000	This all sounds well and good until you realize the horrifying part.
9268000	9271000	These crane machines are not free.
9271000	9275000	After a few complimentary plays, the game allows you to purchase five tries for 90 yen.
9275000	9279000	You are not buying these items outright, you are merely buying chances to win them.
9279000	9289000	During my free plays, I was able to win most of the items on two separate screens, of which there are many, but not the hardest to grab ones.
9289000	9292000	I had the option of paying 90 yen to continue, but declined.
9292000	9303000	If you go back to these screens later to try to win the items you didn't win before, you will find the machine reset to its initial state, making it just as difficult to win those items as it was the first time.
9303000	9311000	This rewards the sort of binging that could cost players to drop lots of money all at once.
9311000	9321000	It is easy to think of this as cheaper than actually trying similar games at an arcade, but by the same token, those games allow you the chance to win physical, tangible prizes.
9321000	9332000	The game will allow you to post pictures of your new improved home menu to Miiverse, but other than that, these are merely cosmetic items that you keep to yourself.
9332000	9339000	I'm really not sure how I feel about this, it looks like the sort of thing that many will accuse of being a shameless cash grab.
9339000	9348000	Nintendo's last pricing experiment, Darumeshi Sports Shop, did wind up in North America, so there's a good chance this could wind up here too.
9348000	9356000	I just wonder after years of little things, like intentionally releasing small GameCube memory cards to maximize profit,
9356000	9365000	to limiting supplies of consoles and accessories, to making questionable release decisions, to asking us to buy the same game on Virtual Console over and over again,
9365000	9373000	to keeping all the cool club Nintendo rewards in Japan, to releasing new limited edition 3DS systems that the new 3DS is about to come out,
9373000	9379000	sorry, when the new 3DS is about to come out, how much will it take before even the most devoted fans yell,
9379000	9382000	enough is enough? It's me, Aaron YYR.
9383000	9388000	You know what's interesting is that when Shane was explaining this to me, I didn't even realize that there was this whole...
9388000	9392000	Excuse me. I got a cough. Radio guy's worse than me.
9392000	9394000	Rob's gonna die. Don't die, Rob.
9394000	9398000	Sorry, getting some water. When Shane was explaining this to me, I didn't realize there was this whole crane game element.
9398000	9404000	I thought it was just, oh, you had these mini transactions within the game that you had to buy all these stamps and these...
9404000	9408000	I didn't even realize you had to win them, which is just like a random chance thing.
9408000	9416000	That sounds like a big old pile of heaping bullshit to me. Color me not interested, but there are people out there that are going to spend the money on it.
9416000	9417000	I mean, look...
9417000	9419000	These are the same people that also buy all the Amiibos.
9419000	9424000	Well, and look how crazy people went over that Majora's Mask 3DS.
9424000	9429000	What is the difference between that 3DS and the regular 3DS?
9429000	9437000	Some cosmetic face plate on the outside is really it, but there are people that have to have it.
9437000	9445000	And I understand that drive to a certain degree. I'm not making fun of you or taunting you, because I understand that to a degree, because I bought the Zelda 3DS.
9445000	9450000	But there's also... I kind of agree with YYR. You're gonna get to this point where it's like, enough is enough.
9450000	9456000	And I think a lot of Nintendo fans are starting to see this all add up, and some of us are getting really frustrated at this.
9456000	9460000	And I think it's very important, very important.
9460000	9467000	If you do not like something, don't buy it. Nobody is forcing you to spend your money on this stuff.
9467000	9476000	And so I think with this whole crane game thing, or little stamps that go on the home screen, that how often are you really looking at your home screen on your 3DS?
9476000	9479000	Aren't you supposed to be playing games on your 3DS, or exchanging puzzle pieces?
9479000	9483000	You're gonna open up your home screen and show your friend, hey look, look at me.
9483000	9488000	You know, it's... I just don't see that. I don't get it.
9488000	9493000	I guess for other people that maybe are into collecting, I guess it's good for you, whatever.
9493000	9498000	But me? No way am I kicking even one dollar towards that, because that would just be another...
9498000	9504000	Then Nintendo can go back to their sales board and say, oh that's one more person that bought into this, and look at all these users we have.
9504000	9511000	Dropping 99 cents on this game. Let's do more! Let's use more lovable Nintendo characters the next time we do it.
9511000	9513000	And so on, and so on.
9513000	9517000	So, yeah, no thank you to this for me.
9517000	9518000	Hmm.
9518000	9522000	Pow points out, though, that this may not just be Nintendo.
9522000	9525000	Pow says, same thing happens with Sony.
9525000	9530000	How many times do people buy Final Fantasy, Metal Gear, or God of War?
9530000	9535000	Well, boy Square Enix, and maybe a little bit Sony, but I'd say more Square Enix.
9535000	9541000	Square Enix sure looked like a laughing stock, getting up there and saying Final Fantasy VII is coming to PlayStation 4.
9541000	9547000	Oh, by the way, it's the PC version. I mean, they kind of, they kind of ate a little shit over that.
9547000	9552000	At least in the court of public opinion. However, you know, that doesn't mean they're not going to release it.
9552000	9558000	And I'm very curious to see now what that's going to look like when it's released, because I bet there's a ton of people that will still buy it.
9558000	9563000	Even, even though they gave them shit, one of the first people on Twitter to say,
9563000	9568000	LOL, PC port on PlayStation 4, they'll be the first person to buy it.
9568000	9575000	Why? Because, because way down in my squishy heart, I have a soft spot for Final Fantasy VII.
9575000	9582000	But if you really, really don't like it, and you don't want them to keep doing this, it is imperative you don't buy it.
9582000	9586000	ActDeftInChat says, if you give money to that, you're supporting it.
9586000	9589000	Alright. Anyway, thank you for letting us know about that, because you're right.
9589000	9593000	That's on the Japanese 3DS, not here, and people may not know that this is a thing that's going on.
9593000	9600000	But yeah, that's actually, ironically enough, I also heard about that this week, so it's funny I'm hearing that from two different sides this week.
9600000	9603000	Jamie, any thoughts on that before we close up the mailbag?
9603000	9605000	Nope.
9605000	9610000	Alright. Loki, I know you love Nintendo. Any thoughts from you on that?
9610000	9618000	It's a sad, I mean, for a company that doesn't seem to want to get into the mobile market because it would devalue their products,
9618000	9622000	they're certainly imploring a lot of mobile tactics.
9622000	9626000	I am very impressed with that shade you just threw. That was great!
9626000	9631000	That was a very well-thought-out response to all that. Alright.
9631000	9635000	Well, if you have some thoughts on that, participate at orangelountrader.com.
9635000	9639000	It's the place to send your emails. Or we will be opening up the mailbag shortly.
9639000	9641000	I'm sorry, not the mailbag. Well, that's always open.
9641000	9648000	We'll be opening up the phone lines shortly over at 1877-gameOLR or our username on Skype, orangelountrader.
9648000	9654000	But we have just a couple quick stories right after a well-timed FU of the Week segment.
9654000	9656000	Why do we do FUs of the Week? Because. FU.
9672000	9674000	DarkSakura?
9674000	9687000	Um. A minor FU to issues. And the recovery thereof. That's it.
9687000	9692000	Very specific and targeted FU. I know how it is. Low-key, you're FU of the Week.
9692000	9694000	Ah, FU of the Week.
9694000	9700000	I'm with you. I was starting to feel under the weather when I got back from Seattle and thought I got something on the plane.
9700000	9709000	I caught it from my kids and it's taking the form of sinus stuff and along with the sinus stuff my eye is.
9709000	9711000	Don't give it to me.
9711000	9718000	It's not pink eye, it's just freaking allergies. I get it every single year. My wife says, it's pink eye, get it away from me.
9718000	9725000	Like, it's fucking allergies. That's why it goes away towards the end of the day and comes back when I sleep on that side during the night.
9725000	9727000	I'm like, it's fucking allergies.
9727000	9729000	I hope you feel better soon.
9729000	9731000	If you want any emergency, let me know.
9731000	9733000	That stuff does not work.
9733000	9742000	I am convinced it will suppress symptoms, but it's not like you're never going to get sick if you take it. But it's like taking your vitamins.
9742000	9745000	Does taking vitamin C help? Yes.
9745000	9748000	Actually, no. That's been disproven.
9748000	9757000	What happened is there was a guy who got on this big kick because one time he took vitamin C and felt better so he tried to spread this word.
9757000	9760000	I swear I will pull up all the proof on this if I need to.
9760000	9771000	But they actually did test it and in some cases taking extreme amounts of vitamin C will actually suppress parts of your immune system and could potentially lead to development of cancer.
9771000	9775000	It's vitamin C for cancer.
9775000	9779000	My doctor tells me to drink a lot of orange juice and that stuff when I'm sick.
9780000	9787000	My FU of the Week goes to people that cheat in multiplayer games.
9787000	9791000	I don't care if you cheat in your single player game and do all the hacking and all that crap you want.
9791000	9793000	Like Loki and his Grand Theft Auto.
9793000	9797000	Technically that was multiplayer, but it was closed multiplayer.
9797000	9801000	That's okay too. If everybody agrees on the terms, then that's fine.
9801000	9806000	But FU to people that cheat in multiplayer games that just ruin it for everybody.
9806000	9808000	Fuck you.
9808000	9814000	Alright, that's it. Just a couple more stories for you guys and then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR.
9814000	9817000	Or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Loki.
9817000	9822000	So hey, I bet everyone's really excited to play Codename Steam.
9822000	9825000	You know, I'm sure there's going to be a demo right around the corner.
9825000	9828000	Oh, but I'm sorry, you can only get a demo at GameStop.
9828000	9830000	Oh, and you have to be an employee there.
9830000	9834000	So yes, there will be a demo coming out for the employees.
9834000	9839000	And I guess they're getting five per store and you'll be able to play it next week.
9839000	9844000	Congrats to you. You're part of the cool kids club with Nintendo.
9846000	9848000	That's a little...
9848000	9853000	So is it only GameStop employees or are they going to be affording this to Best Buy?
9853000	9855000	No, it's to get you excited as we are.
9855000	9860000	We want GameStop Associates to be the first among the experienced Codename Steam.
9860000	9864000	Now, this doesn't necessarily mean that they're not going to put out a demo.
9864000	9866000	It's just it's not going to be out first.
9866000	9869000	You're not going to get to play it if you're a GameStop employee.
9869000	9874000	I honestly, I don't know. I just don't think anyone would give two shits about, you know.
9874000	9877000	Well, there's a part of me that's like, all right, it's just Project Steam, whatever.
9877000	9880000	It's, you know, not a game like we're all dying.
9880000	9882000	I mean, I think some people are really dying to play this,
9882000	9884000	but it's not like a game we're all foaming at the mouth over.
9884000	9886000	But I just hate the precedent this is setting.
9886000	9888000	You know what I mean? I don't like that.
9888000	9890000	It's fine with them having, it's fine, whatever.
9890000	9894000	They can have their demos and stuff, but it's just like,
9894000	9899000	I think it would be better if everybody got to play it earlier, I would think,
9899000	9902000	because then you get the hype up more, because honestly, I don't think that...
9902000	9904000	Or all retailers have the same shot.
9904000	9910000	I just don't think that, like, you know, people at GameStop aren't getting me hyped up on new products.
9910000	9913000	Okay, when I walk in there, it's more like, hey, what do you want to pre-order?
9913000	9917000	You know, they're not saying, hey, have you ever, Codename Steam, it's fucking amazing. Here's why.
9917000	9921000	It's like, that's, it's just not happening that way.
9921000	9926000	They're just not, they can't hype everybody up about everything.
9926000	9931000	DungeonBuster in chat says, exclusive demo equals GameStop associate product training.
9931000	9933000	And I certainly get that at the end of it.
9933000	9937000	But then ActDef says, I can see GameStop employees reselling these demos on eBay.
9937000	9939000	And I'm sure that they will.
9939000	9943000	I would not doubt for one second that this is when I end up on eBay,
9943000	9945000	because they are making a lot of money.
9945000	9949000	And, yeah, that should be up on eBay.
9949000	9953000	Alright, well, one more little piece for you guys here.
9953000	9958000	Since we were talking a lot about game-making this month, especially with the VoG jam and all that good stuff,
9958000	9961000	which, yes, I still am going to be doing my playthroughs there.
9961000	9963000	Obviously I was a little busy with my trip and so forth.
9963000	9964000	And...
9964000	9965000	Hoping this week I get to that.
9965000	9967000	And you're making...
9967000	9968000	Yes.
9968000	9969000	As well.
9969000	9973000	On my agenda as well. I got a lot to do before we are even going to think about having a second jam.
9973000	9977000	But, this is really cool, is that it's another series of tutorials.
9977000	9979000	You know, obviously we love the guys from Cooking with Unity.
9979000	9981000	They do great stuff.
9981000	9983000	And, you know, we had them on the show.
9983000	9986000	But, you know what? Maybe Unity is not the thing for you.
9986000	9988000	So there's other tutorials out there.
9988000	9993000	And I thought this was pretty cool, is that Tom Francis, who made the game Gunpoint,
9993000	9996000	put together a Game Maker tutorial.
9996000	9999000	It's a series of videos that's available on YouTube.
9999000	10002000	And all you have to do, if you download Game Maker,
10002000	10008000	which was used in games like Spelunky, Risk of Rain, Nidhogg, and some of these other games,
10008000	10011000	you can check out, there's a free version of Game Maker Studio.
10011000	10014000	I'm pretty sure there is a pay version as well.
10014000	10019000	But anyway, if you download this Game Maker, you can watch this series of videos
10019000	10025000	and basically show you in an hour how to make some games within this Game Maker Studio.
10025000	10027000	So I thought that's pretty cool.
10027000	10030000	You don't have to have any programming or game creation experience.
10030000	10035000	If you follow the tutorials, you'll have a character that moves around with the WASD keys
10035000	10038000	and shoots the direction of the mouse pointer.
10038000	10044000	And as noted in the series itself, if you can shoot, it's officially a video game.
10044000	10048000	So there it is. That's pretty cool that you can do that.
10048000	10051000	So another, you know, if you tried the Unity thing and it's not working for you,
10051000	10053000	you want to learn something, there you go.
10053000	10058000	So you can check out Game Maker, which has been used by people who made Spelunky
10058000	10060000	and Hotline Miami is another big one.
10060000	10064000	There is one other one I had too that I follow that is Game Maker,
10064000	10067000	but I can't remember who it was and I've got to look.
10067000	10069000	Unfortunately, these aren't very helpful.
10069000	10072000	Thank you, YouTube, for browsing these channels.
10072000	10075000	So I'll have to get back to you on that.
10075000	10082000	But there is one, though, that they have a ton of really cool tutorials and stuff for Game Maker.
10082000	10084000	All right.
10084000	10088000	We're going to go to the Skype line over at 1877 Game OLR.
10088000	10091000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10091000	10096000	The Skype line is open now for you to call in and participate with the show tonight.
10096000	10101000	I think it's actually this guy, Sean Spaulding, I think is who it is, if I remember correctly.
10101000	10103000	Because this looks correct.
10103000	10108000	Loki, do you have any last-minute stories, too, while we wait for Skype to turn up?
10108000	10110000	No.
10110000	10114000	Well, there's one that we didn't mention, another one of those games that they're going to be bringing back
10114000	10120000	as a remake or HD-er version on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
10120000	10123000	But Devil May Cry, they're doing that as well.
10123000	10126000	So look for that in the near future.
10126000	10128000	All right, let's get to it.
10128000	10130000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
10130000	10132000	Hey, this is ActDef.
10132000	10134000	What's on your mind, buddy?
10134000	10141000	Well, speaking of retail exclusives, Nintendo screen up some things and all that stuff,
10141000	10146000	I have a rant to say about the New 3DS especially.
10146000	10148000	Go for it.
10148000	10154000	Well, not necessarily the Majora's Mask New 3DS.
10154000	10171000	And I said on the chat earlier that I think that the Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate New 3DS looks way more prettier, way more awesome.
10171000	10174000	And I really wanted one.
10174000	10181000	But since it was a GameStop exclusive, and I say was, I couldn't get one.
10181000	10188000	Even though it didn't sell out immediately like the Majora's Mask one, I couldn't get one.
10188000	10194000	And this is something that I kind of talked about the last time I called.
10194000	10203000	Where since I don't live in the United States, I don't get to have some things immediately.
10203000	10205000	And this is one of them.
10205000	10215000	Since GameStop doesn't want my money, nor from my own debit or credit cards, nor even PayPal, I couldn't get one.
10215000	10221000	I was so pissed. Like really, really angry at it.
10221000	10229000	Like, you don't have an idea, even though I pretty much ranted on Twitter already about this, but oh my god.
10229000	10233000	I was so fucking angry.
10233000	10241000	And this was GameStop, because GameStop's exclusive to this, they would not take whatever particular credit card you were trying to use?
10241000	10249000	Yeah, GameStop doesn't allow for some credit cards in some countries, if it doesn't register.
10249000	10259000	And this is pretty much something that angers me also, because they have countries in Europe that they do accept.
10259000	10268000	Even I think New Zealand and Australia, they accept, but no, Mexico and any other Latin American countries, no, they won't take my money.
10268000	10270000	Interesting.
10270000	10277000	Yeah, it's really stupid. I don't know how to express it correctly, but it's stupid.
10277000	10287000	I totally get why that's frustrating, and this goes to the whole fact that because Nintendo only uses one retailer for some of these exclusives, then it's like you have no other options.
10287000	10297000	You can't just go to Amazon, or you can't go to somewhere else and another option that may actually be willing to take your money from another country.
10297000	10304000	Yeah, like you said, I cannot go to Amazon, I cannot go to maybe even Walmart. I'm not saying about that.
10304000	10312000	Well, if the Majora's Max one appears on Walmart on their site, I can buy it, and I can order it from them.
10312000	10323000	But not GameStop, and not even other stores, but no, it's a GameStop exclusive, and I cannot get it anywhere else.
10323000	10335000	Unless I import one from Japan, and that would be a Japanese one, and I would have to deal with rigging and logging and all that stuff, and I don't really want to deal with that.
10336000	10344000	Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Rama in chat says, fuck this, I may end up going to Nintendo World for mine.
10344000	10350000	Well, luckily you can do that. Most people don't have that option just based on where they live.
10350000	10358000	And that, I know, is what's incredibly frustrating for you, Akdeft, because it's not like Nintendo is so quick to support Mexico either.
10358000	10364000	You're not going to see them releasing some limited edition 3DS in Mexico. That's not going to happen.
10364000	10374000	Yeah, definitely. Even Nintendo doesn't have, well, it has an official participation here in Mexico, or representation, but not directly.
10374000	10387000	It's, all the stuff they bring over here, it's from a distributor hired by them, and they distribute all the things, all the Amiibos or the consoles, games and all that stuff.
10387000	10394000	So it's not a direct representative, like even Sony and Microsoft, they do have direct representatives here.
10394000	10399000	But Nintendo, no. It's always been like that. And I mean always.
10399000	10409000	Well, I don't know what to say, Akdeft, other than I can sympathize with you. It is very frustrating, and let's just add that to the list on why a retailer exclusive is a bad idea.
10409000	10418000	And I think an old saying I kind of use that I think applies here is, Nintendo, you make it very hard for me to love you sometimes. You make it very hard for me to love you.
10418000	10425000	Yeah, yeah, and that's pretty much my sentiment. I will still support Nintendo, and I will eventually get a new 3DS.
10425000	10435000	But still, it's something really frustrating, and I also said on Twitter that that's the last time I would support GameStop or something, too.
10436000	10448000	Yeah, I'm officially dropping GameStop as probably a place I would go or I would consider buying stuff online or under stores or whatever.
10448000	10457000	Well, welcome to the club. I hate to say. Alright, Akdeft, I'm gonna let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you for sharing your story. I appreciate it.
10457000	10459000	Thanks for having me.
10459000	10463000	It offers a very good perspective I think a lot of people don't think about. So, take care, buddy.
10463000	10464000	Yeah, you too.
10464000	10465000	Alright, bye.
10465000	10473000	Alright, 1877 GameOLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, but the phone's already lighting up, so let's get to another call. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
10473000	10476000	Hi, this is RagingNator.
10476000	10477000	Hey, RagingNator, buddy. What's on your mind?
10478000	10487000	Not a whole lot. I just want to put my two cents in to Guardian Robert M's email from earlier.
10487000	10497000	Seeing as he's been having problems with his PlayStation 3 and I hate to admit this, but I'm kind of an expert on this issue.
10497000	10501000	Fair enough. Well, what were your thoughts hearing that email?
10502000	10514000	Alright, basically, to make a long conversation short, I'm 1000% sure that his PlayStation 3 is dying, most likely because it's overheating.
10514000	10528000	Now, the soldering or the motherboard on there is going to go to shit and sooner or later, he's going to get that dreaded yellow light of death.
10529000	10541000	It's not something he can fix himself and I would not recommend going to like a mom or pop store or what have you to have it repaired.
10541000	10552000	Regardless of whether or not his system is under warranty, I would suggest sending it to Sony to have it repaired.
10552000	10561000	In the worst case scenario, if it's not under warranty, you may have to pay a little bit to have it fixed.
10562000	10569000	But even if that is going to be a little bit cheaper than going out and buying a new system.
10569000	10587000	And plus, on top of that, if it goes that route, assuming that he gets all of his proverbial ducks in a row beforehand, there's a reasonably good chance that he'll get his video content back.
10587000	10600000	Like you said, he doesn't have a whole lot of video content, but the fact is, he has it and if I were in his position, if I bought it, I might keep access to it.
10600000	10609000	You know, that's a really good point that you bring up that we didn't really discuss when we were talking to him about his options is that, you know, he kind of just quickly said,
10609000	10616000	I don't think sending it Sony is really an option because I'm out of warranty, but you're right that sending it to Sony is still probably going to run you cheaper than getting a new machine.
10616000	10622000	And even though it won't be under warranty now, and you may have to pay a little bit out of pocket, I could be wrong.
10622000	10631000	But won't it now be under some type of like post repair warranty where if something goes wrong for the next year, you know, then Sony will have to fix it again because they repaired it the first time.
10631000	10634000	I could be wrong with that, but it would seem like you would at least get that perk too.
10635000	10643000	Honestly, I can't remember whether or not that would apply or not. It's been a while since I had my PlayStation 3 repeated.
10643000	10646000	And the rules may have changed.
10646000	10657000	But nonetheless, you know, at least, you know, you send it in to Sony themselves as opposed to Joe Schmoe or whatever.
10657000	10668000	You know, they'll be repaired correctly if you give it to Joe Schmoe and they try to fix it and they fork in your system.
10668000	10670000	Guess what? You should have luck.
10670000	10672000	Yeah, that's true.
10673000	10688000	But, you know, you were also you were, you know, you were, you know, when you were talking amongst yourselves earlier, you know, you seem like there was sounded like there was a little bit of confusion as to how video downloads work.
10689000	10709000	All right. Now, I'm going to, you know, label on what I'm about to say as, you know, for like a lol asterisk or for though I'm saying that being that, you know, let's not let's say change things since I had my system in 2012.
10709000	10714000	Well, what I'm saying applies, but I doubt, you know, they change anything.
10714000	10721000	But last time I checked, videos work a little bit differently than games and DLC.
10721000	10728000	Now, whereas like games and DLC, you can you have your master list of downloads.
10728000	10731000	You can basically redownload stuff constantly.
10731000	10734000	If you delete something, you can redown it. No problem.
10734000	10737000	Now, videos work a little bit differently.
10737000	10747000	Once you buy something, let's say, for example, you bought the pilot 2 Dax files.
10747000	10751000	If you bought that, you can download that video once.
10751000	10756000	Now, let's say you download it to your PS3.
10756000	10766000	Once that's downloaded onto your PS3, you know, you can no longer redownload it unless you buy it again.
10766000	10770000	So it is unlike games because games you can download to more than one console.
10770000	10773000	It used to be like five, but now I think a couple years ago they narrowed it down.
10773000	10774000	You can only do it to two.
10774000	10777000	So you're saying the video, once you download it, that's it.
10777000	10779000	You don't get to go back on the store and download it again.
10779000	10789000	Correct. Now, the only time that they make an exception to this is, you know, in certain circumstances,
10789000	10796000	like if you're sending in your machine to be repaired to Sony, you know, let them know in advance,
10796000	10802000	hey, you know, since I'm sending my system in to be repaired for this whatever issue,
10802000	10809000	I have, you know, IMA, IMB, IMC on my video queue that paid for.
10809000	10814000	Now, once I send my machine in and get it repaired and it's sent back to me,
10814000	10817000	could you, you know, set things up so I can redownload it?
10817000	10818000	Gotcha.
10818000	10826000	No, like, you're more than likely going to get your videos back, but there's not a 100% guarantee, though.
10826000	10828000	You may have to make several calls.
10828000	10830000	Well, Spazinator, I appreciate the tips.
10830000	10833000	I think Robert M. will be able to use that in weighing his decision on what he's going to do.
10833000	10836000	Now I'm curious to see what Robert M. is going to do.
10836000	10838000	All right, well, I appreciate the tips.
10838000	10840000	I'm going to let you go to try to fit in a couple more calls, okay?
10840000	10841000	Sure, no problem.
10841000	10842000	All right, take care, my friend.
10842000	10844000	Yeah, have a good one.
10844000	10845000	All right, bye.
10845000	10848000	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype.
10848000	10851000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
10851000	10853000	Loki, do you have anything else you want to share with us?
10853000	10855000	I don't know if you finish up your last-minute stories.
10855000	10857000	No, I don't, unfortunately.
10857000	10860000	Well, I can always go to Twitter over at Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
10860000	10867000	Sometimes we get some tweets throughout the week that I'll take this opportunity to respond to while we're waiting for some calls.
10867000	10868000	Excuse me.
10868000	10869000	And even I have the cough.
10869000	10872000	It's a very sickly night here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10872000	10875000	Mine's just all left over from my old sinus infection.
10875000	10881000	Alex P. Carson tweets us saying, can't join in tonight, but much love to the OL Army and the hosts. Heart.
10881000	10882000	Aww.
10882000	10883000	Yay.
10883000	10885000	A little big heart right back at you. I appreciate that, appreciate that.
10885000	10892000	Lots of retweets and shout-outs for the rockage interview we had earlier, so awesome for that.
10892000	10897000	Let's see, Obi-Wan Jabroni tweets saying, won't be able to catch Bobby Blackwell for an OLR this AM.
10897000	10900000	Because remember, he's overseas, so it's the AM for him.
10900000	10903000	We'll be watching the WWE Royal Rumble.
10903000	10905000	Well, at least you have your priorities straight.
10905000	10908000	Hope there's no chance to get extra VOG points.
10908000	10909000	Well, I think you lucked out.
10909000	10914000	I don't think Bobby or I had any games or anything tonight for extra points, so you might have lucked out.
10914000	10918000	Keep in mind, though, Bobby is not having a show next week.
10918000	10921000	He is off for the Superb Owl.
10921000	10923000	He does a big party thing with some friends.
10923000	10927000	He's done that every year, so that would be important.
10927000	10931000	His show, you'll have to check in for that at some point over the next two weeks.
10931000	10933000	You'd check in once there.
10933000	10937000	All right, gosh, I think that might be it.
10937000	10941000	We're not really getting a lot of calls, and it's 9.15, so I think it probably is time for us to wrap up.
10941000	10946000	If you didn't get through and you were just being shy and you think of something to say later on, don't forget to email us.
10946000	10949000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
10949000	10952000	You can always email us, and that gives you time to think about what you want to say.
10952000	10954000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
10954000	10957000	But for now, we're going to go ahead and start to wrap things up for the night.
10957000	10963000	As always, I want to thank you guys very much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio and supporting independent broadcasting.
10963000	10967000	If you like what you heard here at the show, please tell a friend or two about the show.
10967000	10970000	Help spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,
10970000	10974000	but we can't give those voices any airtime if they're not here listening to us.

10998000	11001000	Those go a long way towards visibility as well.
11001000	11005000	It's about time to go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.
11005000	11007000	I will start with my final thought for the night.
11007000	11013000	My final thought for the night is, Alan was able to come home from work on light rail, so I don't have to pick him up tonight.
11013000	11021000	So that means 30 more minutes of either Diablo 3, Final Fantasy XIV, or Fantasy Life. We'll see.
11021000	11023000	Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?
11023000	11025000	Fuck that, I'm having cheesecake.
11025000	11030000	Oh my god, do you know what I learned this weekend, though, when we went to Cheesecake Factory?
11030000	11032000	Don't tell me, la la la.
11033000	11039000	I'm just gonna say, don't open the menu of how many calories a slice of cheesecake has. Don't do it.
11039000	11041000	Are you getting your cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory?
11041000	11042000	Hell yeah.
11042000	11044000	Oh, well then I'm definitely not gonna tell you.
11044000	11048000	No, I already know, by the way, but there's a reason behind this.
11048000	11058000	Tomorrow I am 100% back on keto, so I figured I may as well blow out all the sugar for an entire year, and then I'll be fine.
11058000	11060000	Nothing wrong with a little indulgence once in a while.
11060000	11064000	A little indulgence is fine, but I indulged a lot in Seattle. A lot.
11064000	11065000	You gonna come with?
11065000	11070000	I'm gonna respectfully pass, just because I have indulged a lot the past couple weeks.
11070000	11071000	Ah, fuck it, you only live once.
11071000	11074000	I know, I know. Loki, your final thought?
11074000	11083000	That channel I was talking about earlier, it was user 999GrayFox, G-R-E-Y, Fox, on YouTube.
11083000	11086000	That was Sean Spaulding does some tutorials for Game Maker.
11087000	11090000	And hopefully I'll be working, well I will be working more on my game this week.
11090000	11093000	I'm almost to the point where I can actually start building levels.
11093000	11104000	So I'm just doing the starting line sequence, you know, when you're starting off a level where it does the countdown and stuff and go and starts the timer type thing.
11104000	11106000	Because I have the timer running, and I have everything.
11106000	11112000	Now I've got it where in the very first level, because the first part's like a menu and you have to drive through the first level.
11112000	11121000	And once you get on the starting line, it's gotta stop you, and then move you to where it needs, like the middle of it, and then let you go after the countdown thing.
11121000	11122000	So that's what I'm working on right now.
11122000	11125000	Nice. I'm hoping to make some progress on my game as well.
11125000	11127000	The weekend will be a good chance for me to do that.
11127000	11134000	I honestly, up until tonight, in setting up for the interview, for some reason in my mind, I thought Rockage was this coming weekend.
11134000	11141000	So I was thinking, oh okay, I gotta plan a trip to San Jose this weekend, and then I forgot, no stupid, there's still the Super Bowl, and then Rockage.
11141000	11148000	So knowing that I don't really care about the Super Bowl, that'll give me a lot of time this coming weekend to work on that, so that'll be exciting.
11148000	11151000	Fingers crossed I can have something to show you guys soon.
11151000	11157000	Once I get past, once I get to the point where I can start building levels, then I can implement all the goofy shit that I've had.
11157000	11158000	That's the stuff you really wanted to do.
11158000	11166000	Exactly, because I've gotten all the framework stuff done, and then it's just like creative, creative, creative, and that's where I want to get to.
11166000	11169000	Alright, that's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Laundry News.
11169000	11176000	Thanks again for your support, and coming back after a week off, we really appreciate it, and we will be back to do it all again in seven days.
11176000	11180000	Yes, we will be here, despite that football game that a lot of people seem to care about.
11180000	11184000	I know, Puppy Bowl, but we've gone up against them in the past, and you know.
11184000	11193000	Thankfully Puppy Bowl airs really early for us on the West Coast, so we can get that out of our system before we do OLR that night.
11193000	11201000	But, Dark Sakura, and maybe Loki too, you know, we've been talking about doing our Super Taco Bowl next Sunday.
11201000	11203000	No, no, no, it's called a Burrito Bowl.
11203000	11207000	Burrito Bowl, oh excuse me, Super Burrito Bowl, so maybe we'll do that for OLR next week.
11207000	11209000	Well, you know what I still call it.
11209000	11210000	What?
11210000	11215000	The Super Bowl, which is what we're gonna be in after the Super Burrito Bowl.
11215000	11219000	It gets us an excuse to play, was it the sports song or whatever from Weird Al next week?
11219000	11221000	That's true.
11221000	11222000	Sports, do the thing!
11222000	11226000	Get the thing to the other side of the thing. Sports harder than the other team.
11226000	11231000	Careful what you order in your Super Burrito Bowl at Chipotle or you'll end up on the Super Toilet Bowl.
11231000	11238000	And on that thought, that does it for another Orange Lounge Radio. Thanks again for listening, we'll see you in seven days. Good night.
11252000	11255000	6pm Pacific, 9pm Eastern.
11255000	11263000	The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network.
11263000	11266000	But you know they were all still true.

11282000	11302000	Thanks for watching!
