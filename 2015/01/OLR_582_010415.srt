00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,680
Tonight, January 4th, 2015, we begin our 13th year of broadcasting making 2015 gaming

2
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,000
predictions with our listeners, and Sony apologizes for the holiday attacks with free PS Plus

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
time.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Here's more on the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,080
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to an all new year of the

6
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,560
show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:46,120
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 582 for this January the 4th

8
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,840
of 2015.

9
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,320
Here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with myself, Rob Roberts,

10
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:59,200
and with me as always, my co-hosts, beginning our 13th year of broadcasting, say hello to

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,360
DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

12
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,360
Hi.

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,360
Hi.

14
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,360
Lucky 13, can you believe it?

15
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,360
Yerp.

16
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,840
Started in 2002, which to be fair, we haven't turned 13 yet, that'll be in June, but still

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,360
it's the 13th year of broadcasting.

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,360
It's crazy.

19
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,360
Yerp.

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,360
I was just thinking about that earlier today.

21
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,360
The show's a teenager.

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,360
Yerp.

23
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,360
It's a brat.

24
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,360
It's a brat.

25
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,360
You're the brat.

26
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,360
So?

27
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,080
But you are a brat who brought cookies to the show tonight, so I can't be a hater.

28
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,640
I'm happy, happy you and Alanversary.

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,640
Thank you.

30
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,640
I appreciate that.

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,640
Yeah.

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,400
Today is Alan and I's 5th anniversary, so thank you for acknowledging that.

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,080
It would be Alan and Mai.

34
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,680
Anyway, say hello as well to Tech Matt.

35
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,960
Clearly I'm not the grammar master.

36
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,200
Maybe I'll introduce her as that in the future.

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,480
But say hello to Tech Master Loki.

38
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,480
Hi.

39
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,480
Hi, Loki.

40
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
How are you?

41
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
Eating Chinese.

42
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,480
Yeah, you're eating Chinese, which is funny.

43
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,040
Were you jealous of last week when DarkSakura and I were eating Chinese food?

44
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,640
Because let me tell you, don't be.

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,480
It made me sick for like four days.

46
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,160
No, I wasn't jealous of that.

47
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,200
I just wanted something different other than the burgers.

48
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,360
Because I had McDonald's yesterday, and I don't know what it is lately, but McDonald's

49
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,360
has just gone downhill.

50
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:15,840
They used to be sometimes pretty good, but now it's maybe 10% good, 90% garbage, so I've

51
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,520
just stopped going there.

52
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,800
But my son wanted a happy meal or some garbage, so I had to go buy that.

53
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,840
Oh, I thought DarkSakura was reacting to a happy meal over there, she said.

54
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,640
No, I'm getting sick of autocorrect on my computer, and I'm about to turn the shit off.

55
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,640
On your computer?

56
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,640
That's too much.

57
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,640
I'm on a Mac.

58
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,920
I know, but I didn't realize the computers did autocorrect.

59
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,840
I haven't had a Mac laptop in forever.

60
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,840
But anyway.

61
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,840
Sorry, Loki.

62
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,840
So you got your son garbage food at McDonald's.

63
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:48,120
Yeah, so he had garbage food at McDonald's, and so I got some as well, and it's garbage.

64
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,220
Like the fries are just terrible, it's like eating cardboard.

65
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,660
So I decided I didn't want to have a burger today, so I just stopped and got Chinese,

66
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,060
and the slowest Asian person ever served us.

67
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,220
It took him 20 minutes to serve me and the person in front of me, who only ordered two

68
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,220
things.

69
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,340
I was like, why are these people employed?

70
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,460
Slow and steady wins the race.

71
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,460
There is no race.

72
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,460
He's not racing.

73
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,460
He's just slow.

74
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,340
All right, going to our chat room, which isn't slow tonight.

75
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,140
There's actually a few of you guys over in chat.

76
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:23,140
We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, www.vognetwork.com.

77
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:28,180
It's six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

78
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:34,860
And of course, if you are listening live, you can participate with our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

79
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,460
And you know when we talk about the whole 13 years of OLR, somebody always inevitably

80
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,620
makes a comment like this.

81
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,620
You ready?

82
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,560
SSG100Matt says, I was 19 when I started listening to OLR.

83
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
I'm 31 now.

84
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,960
Yeah, thanks.

85
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,960
Thanks.

86
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,960
Thanks for that.

87
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,600
Thank you for that reminder.

88
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,840
Ragenator in chat says, I'm looking forward to OLR episode 666.

89
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,840
You know what's funny is in the old days of OLR, probably around like episode 69, you

90
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,040
know, we got to episode 69, which for its own reasons was a landmark show.

91
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,120
I think we started making jokes about, well, what's the next big number that this show

92
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,120
will hit?

93
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,360
And that's, oh, episode 666.

94
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,320
And we would say, oh, we'll never make that number.

95
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,760
And I think I even plotted it out and I said, you know, if we were to get to episode 666,

96
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,240
we would have to get to like 2016.

97
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,080
And I was always like, oh, we'll never last that long.

98
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,160
And now I'm looking at it going, actually, we probably will get to episode 666.

99
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,040
So we better plan something really special.

100
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,040
And then 669.

101
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,680
Anyway, let's see other comments in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

102
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,280
Locopoco commenting on the food saying, I only go to McDonald's for fries, always order

103
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,440
them without salt.

104
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,440
So they are fresh.

105
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,920
But then they don't have salt on them.

106
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,920
And yes, I understand.

107
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,040
We'll just put your own salt on it.

108
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,000
However, they have like other seasonings that they throw on there.

109
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So it's not just salt.

110
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,160
I have it on good authority from friends that used to work at McDonald's and even managed

111
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,240
that if you just ask for fresh fries, they'll give them to you.

112
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,520
Just ask, could I get fresh fries?

113
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,520
And they will.

114
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,600
Usually, usually good customer service trumps, you know, whatever else.

115
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,640
Yeah, but I usually think they don't give a shit.

116
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:18,400
And so I'm not going to ask that because they're just not going to give a shit.

117
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,920
Or like if you go to In-N-Out, which yes, I am going to rub it in everybody's face as

118
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,240
I live in California and therefore have easy access to In-N-Out.

119
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,240
Sorry not.

120
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,240
Sorry.

121
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,040
Uh, the best way to get the fries there are well done.

122
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
Always.

123
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,040
Oh, God.

124
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,040
So good.

125
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
So good.

126
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,040
Where?

127
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,040
In-N-Out.

128
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,040
Uh-uh.

129
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,040
What?

130
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,040
Nuh-uh.

131
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
Animal style.

132
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
Oh, no, no, no.

133
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,040
Because Animal Style has the mayonnaise based thing on it.

134
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,480
It's 1000 island and it has mayonnaise.

135
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,480
Which is amazing.

136
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,920
That's, that's mayonnaise and ketchup basically.

137
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,040
Because the only other way to get it is no salt.

138
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,040
Plain.

139
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,040
No.

140
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,040
Which salt is nasty.

141
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
No, no, no, no, no.

142
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,040
You can get light salt.

143
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,040
Anyway.

144
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:59,360
Uh, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, OLR retiring after 666 episodes confirmed.

145
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,920
You know, it all has to end someday.

146
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,960
Someday there's going to be a final episode of OLR.

147
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,160
And I'm not saying, you know, we know when that is yet or anything, but.

148
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,000
Well, that's the episode that we're going to have Gabe Newell on, right?

149
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,720
I always kind of have thought in the back of my head.

150
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,840
If we are going to end it on a predetermined date, it should be episode 666.

151
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,840
That ought to be it.

152
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,340
But again, I don't, I don't really think, but then I'm like, well, but then we could

153
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:28,800
also get to 700 and you know, anyway, so it's always like, there'll always be another goal

154
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,120
right after you cross one goal.

155
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,120
There'll always be another goal.

156
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,000
I think that happens to a lot of podcasters like, whoa, we made a year.

157
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,760
Well, now can we make a thousand will be awesome, right?

158
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,720
Then it'll be like, let's get to a thousand.

159
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,700
How many shows did a thousand episodes?

160
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,700
Maybe a few daily shows.

161
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,760
I'm sure some shows that are taped daily probably made a thousand, but I don't think any weekly

162
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,100
shows have gone that far.

163
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,100
Anyway.

164
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,740
Havoc978 in chat says, OLR will be forever.

165
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,340
Well, we like to think so.

166
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,340
You know what?

167
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,960
It's a great way for me to hang out with Dark Soccer and Loki every Sunday.

168
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,860
And that's probably a big part of the reason why it's gone on so long.

169
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,600
It's just, it's, it's our thing.

170
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
It's our hangout time.

171
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:10,020
Just like some people have church, some people have their weekly D and D games, their weekly

172
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,720
meetup to play Nintendo or PlayStation, their weekly meetup to do whatever.

173
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,720
This is our weekly meetup.

174
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,380
And thank you guys for sharing it with us every week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

175
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:26,220
Anyhow, I want to get into our kickoff topic for tonight and a happy new year to everybody.

176
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,980
I hope you guys had a great new year's Eve and celebrated well.

177
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,740
I don't know what you did, Dark Soccer.

178
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,700
My new year's Eve sucked, just so you know.

179
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,160
My new year's Eve was awful because I had food poisoning.

180
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,160
And so I had two different things I could have done on new year's Eve and I got to do

181
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,160
neither.

182
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,420
Instead I sat home on the couch by myself.

183
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,960
You had two things that you were able to do on new year's Eve.

184
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,960
Fuck off.

185
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:55,680
I meant I had two parties I was invited to and I couldn't do either one of them.

186
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,880
Instead I had to sit on the couch and I watched the Anderson Cooper and Kathy Griffin, which

187
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,960
you know, at least that was, that was all right.

188
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,520
But Dark Soccer, I hope your new year's Eve was a little brighter.

189
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,040
What'd you end up doing?

190
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,040
Everyone was sick.

191
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,400
Yeah, including me.

192
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,440
Yep.

193
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,080
You missed a child throwing up neon green.

194
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
Ew.

195
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,200
But did he do it at midnight?

196
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
She.

197
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Cousin Sophia.

198
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,640
Did she do it at midnight?

199
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,560
Well, a little bit before that.

200
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,520
What happened is Sophia had a coughing fit and she had been sucking on one of those blue

201
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,560
Luden's things.

202
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,440
So when she threw up, it was neon green.

203
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,440
That's disgusting.

204
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,320
Someone might have said, I don't know.

205
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,520
And then Midna started sniffing at it.

206
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,520
Now see people that were 19 when they started listening to the show, aren't going to understand

207
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,520
that joke.

208
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,520
That's why you have the internet.

209
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,520
You can look it up.

210
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,520
All right.

211
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,520
Sorry.

212
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,520
Sorry.

213
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,120
So the cousins had to leave with Sophia and then all that was left was, uh, me and Dan

214
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:57,480
and his little sister and Becky and Julian and Julian stayed up till midnight and then

215
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,840
they left and then Becky took Dan's iPad instead of her Kindle.

216
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,640
So she had to bring it back because Dan's work gave him the iPad.

217
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,120
So that was really the most exciting thing that happened all night.

218
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,200
Dan was playing out runners on the Sega Genesis when the new year rolled in.

219
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,960
I saw the picture on Facebook, so you guys had like a retro gaming new years, right?

220
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,080
Well, Dan had a retro gaming new years.

221
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,880
I was basically drunk fun.

222
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:25,360
I found out that, okay, I can drink frivolous all night and be a little tipsy.

223
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,120
I can have maybe a shot of hypnotic and be a little tipsy.

224
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,720
Mixing Frivolo and hypnotic, not a good idea.

225
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,720
Wild delicious.

226
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,720
Oh my God.

227
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,440
I was like, Oh, are you supposed to mix wine with other liquor?

228
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,600
Well, I guess that's what sangria is, isn't it?

229
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,400
But still kinda, yeah, but, um, but, uh, I, I just wanted to see what they tasted like

230
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,680
together cause the two flavors are very complimentary and it was really delicious, but I can't have

231
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,760
like more than one glass of that cause my stomach will be like, no, you're not 19 anymore.

232
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,760
You can't drink like, wait, 19, you're not 21 anymore.

233
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,760
You can't drink like that.

234
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,760
Well, come on.

235
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,440
You did grow up in Alabama.

236
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,240
Like, you know, you, you're, you're taking shots by the time you get your driver's license.

237
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
I did have that absence when I was 16.

238
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
There you go.

239
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
Now the real thing.

240
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,600
Now I'm plotting for dragon con 2015.

241
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Some of these drinks.

242
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Anyway.

243
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,840
Uh, Loki, how was your new year's Eve?

244
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,040
I imagine with the kids, you probably didn't get to do any big noisy parties, but did you

245
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,360
celebrate with them?

246
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:30,000
Um, well we went to, um, my wife's, um, mother's house and we had food there as we do every

247
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
year.

248
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,480
And so she made all sorts of things, matzo ball soup and chicken and that was really

249
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,480
good.

250
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,480
Homemade matzo ball soup is amazing.

251
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,800
Homemade matzo ball soup is amazing.

252
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
And um, the chicken that she made was great.

253
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,200
It was with, uh, Jack Daniels that she like cooked it in.

254
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,080
So good.

255
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,840
And so, um, yeah, that.

256
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:56,280
And then everybody kind of went to bed, you know, pretty early cause who cares?

257
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,140
Kids don't, you know, go sleep anyways.

258
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:04,200
And then, um, then everyone woke up at midnight when all the booming went off.

259
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,800
Sound like someone like exploding stuff.

260
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,000
What are the people even, they don't even sell fireworks, like mortars or something.

261
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,520
It was like super loud and then like it woke up everybody.

262
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,440
I'm like, how is that supposed to celebrate the new year?

263
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,760
Now the kids are awake.

264
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,760
Thank you.

265
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
Oh my God.

266
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,760
It's like, why do I even bother?

267
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,760
Wow.

268
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,680
All right, well this is the time of year with the new years that a lot of people start making

269
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,160
their new year's resolutions and look, I know some of you can kind of give or take a lot

270
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,720
of these new year's resolutions, but it is a part of culture that this is something people

271
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,720
do.

272
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,760
And even if you hate new year's resolutions with a passion, I still think as a gamer,

273
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:48,240
a lot of us tend to make their goals for 2015 like, Oh, there's this XYZ game.

274
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,760
I've never played that I really want to play.

275
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,960
Or, um, there's this other, you know, I want to beat more games in the year or 300 games

276
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,960
that are in my steam library that I have to install and play at some rate, right?

277
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,680
So I actually asked the listeners earlier this week, I was like, what were some of the

278
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,040
resolutions you guys have?

279
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,440
What are some of the new year's gaming resolutions you guys have?

280
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,520
Uh, and some of the answers that came in, uh, ACHP said by resolution the last few years

281
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,440
was to beat two games a month.

282
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,560
It's surprisingly difficult to do, but I succeeded the last two years going to try again this

283
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,080
year, finished geometry wars three today, one down for January.

284
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,080
That's great.

285
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,080
I'm still working on geo wars three.

286
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,320
Uh, and ER said my resolution should be to not buy so many games.

287
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,040
My poor backlog, but I know I'll never keep it.

288
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:35,760
And do chalk said my resolution is to pour much less time into MMOs.

289
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,920
Time investment likely served better elsewhere.

290
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,880
I w I wish I could say something similar just because you guys all know I'm an MMO addict.

291
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,920
I have another show dedicated to MMOs.

292
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,520
I did cancel my wow account.

293
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,880
I'm sorry to say to my wow playing friends, but now I'm just playing final fantasy 14

294
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,640
twice as much.

295
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,320
So that's not really helping either.

296
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,480
Uh, what about you guys?

297
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,080
What are some of your gaming resolutions?

298
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,600
I don't know if you guys have any dark star or goals if you want to stay away from the

299
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,320
word resolutions, but, uh, Loki, dark soccer, anything for you guys?

300
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,680
I'm going to finish borderlands two on my Mac.

301
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,640
This is a follow up to the discussion that's going on in chat right now.

302
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,640
Isn't it?

303
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,640
Yes.

304
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:22,360
Which I've been playing on my Mac.

305
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,360
Fair enough.

306
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,680
Uh, so you're gonna, but you're going to be borderlands too.

307
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,680
What about, what about the pre-sequel?

308
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,360
Why don't you just play the whole trilogy sequel yet?

309
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,280
What I promised Dan, I would play through the first two with him before I get the pre-sequel

310
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,280
and by the time I'm ready for the pre-sequel, it'll be cheap.

311
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,280
It'll be on sale.

312
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,280
Yeah.

313
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,280
Really?

314
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,400
And you just need to finish borderlands two before the pre-sequel even makes sense.

315
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,040
Cause it's like, who are these characters?

316
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,040
Yeah.

317
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,040
What are they doing?

318
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,080
Well, I mean, I already have watched Dan play through most of, uh, borderlands two anyway,

319
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,520
so I know all the characters and everything.

320
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:53,140
Um, it's just that he was usually busy playing multiplayer with his buddies and I never had

321
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,140
a chance to.

322
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,140
Mm hmm.

323
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,440
So, um, Loki, what about you?

324
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,120
Any, any re gaming goals for the year?

325
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,360
Um, how about finish your damn game?

326
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,360
That's one of them.

327
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
I was going to say that.

328
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,360
Both of them.

329
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,360
Um, yeah.

330
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,720
Uh, so there, there's that, I do want to finish my games.

331
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,240
Um, I kind of want to finish, um, platinum in Lego Marvel superheroes.

332
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,120
I would have had it done by now, but my damn son wouldn't play any of the levels.

333
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,400
I'm like, you don't have to do anything.

334
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,240
He's like, but yeah, but you need me to do specific things at certain times.

335
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,400
I'm like, not since I've already played through them all already.

336
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,600
I just need you to sit there and hit things and that's it.

337
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,400
And he's like, no, I don't want to do that.

338
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,400
I'm afraid of the levels.

339
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,640
I'm like, fine.

340
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,300
So I can't finish any of them and I don't have time to play it right now while I'm working

341
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,880
on my vlog jam games.

342
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:51,460
So, um, I don't know, I just want to finish that and then I don't really know what else

343
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,460
I'll play.

344
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,740
I guess get through the other games I bought for my PlayStation 4 that I haven't even played

345
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,740
yet.

346
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,580
Like I have Infamous I've started and then I have Destiny that I haven't touched yet

347
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:05,300
and I have Watch Dogs that's collecting dust, so there's that.

348
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,960
Even just getting through the backlog of stuff that I have on PC and my Steam library, on

349
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:17,920
Xbox Live in all the Games for Gold stuff and even with PlayStation on the PlayStation

350
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,920
Plus stuff.

351
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,720
I have tons of things I haven't played yet and I'm still a fucking idiot and keep buying

352
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,960
more things.

353
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
I don't know why.

354
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,800
Oh, I know why because I want those things and I need them bad.

355
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
They're shiny.

356
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,800
You need them.

357
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,140
It's just like I bought the DLC for, all the DLC for Lego Marvel Super Heroes.

358
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,140
There's no reason to it.

359
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:39,400
The characters are fucking stupid and it was overpriced, but I did it anyway so that it

360
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,080
would have something different to play as in the game because I'm getting so bored of

361
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,080
it right now.

362
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,520
So my son seriously plays that for hours at a time and just runs around.

363
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:52,520
Now I showed him one of the levels he can go into and break things.

364
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,520
So my gaming goals.

365
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,960
I need to get some platinum trophies.

366
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,520
I think I have maybe one on all of PlayStation games.

367
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,240
If that, I actually may not have any.

368
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,360
So it's high time I get some platinum trophies and I already know what games I want them

369
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,360
in.

370
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,440
I want them in Diablo 3, Reaper of Souls, because I know it's achievable.

371
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,840
It's not a super hard platinum.

372
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,920
It just takes a little bit of grinding because you have to get one of every class to level

373
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,400
70, but it's doable.

374
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,800
It's like way more than doable.

375
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,120
It's just going to take a little patience.

376
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:20,360
So I want to get one there and I really think I can get one in Final Fantasy 14, which there's

377
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,960
some, you know, I have to do like a thousand fates and a thousand.

378
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,880
Are they as ridiculous as the ones in Final Fantasy 11?

379
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,680
Well, they're not as bad in 11 now after they implemented the whole fact that you can XP

380
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,560
with a party of people like.

381
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,560
Yeah, at the time it was like, Oh, get me 75.

382
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,880
It's a little easier now, but yeah, I want to get a platinum in Final Fantasy 14, which

383
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,360
I think is definitely achievable.

384
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,240
The hardest one's going to be clearing turn five on PlayStation four, but I know I can

385
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,240
do it.

386
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,240
I know I can do it because I've cleared it on PC.

387
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,280
There's no reason I can't do it on PS4.

388
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,320
So those are some of my immediate goals.

389
00:16:53,320 --> 00:17:00,600
I want to do more with broadcasting like YouTube and live streams because I end up right now

390
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,420
doing a live stream like maybe every two weeks and I want to bump that up to more like maybe

391
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,140
two a week now that I have a little more time because I'm not doing the performance

392
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,900
stuff anymore and I want to do more YouTubes.

393
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,220
I really miss that Let's Remember series I was doing.

394
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:19,900
I think it's fun to visit really, really old games that define my childhood and kind of

395
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,820
introduce them to people who might've missed them or only seen them for like 30 seconds

396
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,900
or only read about them.

397
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,060
So I really want to bring that back.

398
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,700
So those are some of my goals for 2015.

399
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,100
So I'm really excited about that.

400
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,220
So hopefully I stay on track.

401
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,540
Just a few more from the listenership.

402
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:37,020
Some answers over here on Google+, Tom W saying, I'm going to play at least 80% of

403
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,020
my Steam library.

404
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,140
I'm currently sitting at 51%.

405
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,780
But does that mean like actually play or just load?

406
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,540
I hope you actually play, you got to beat at least the first level in all of them.

407
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:52,920
And Martin C replies and says, trying to steer clear from games that are too much of a time

408
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,460
sink since my free time is limited.

409
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:00,780
I'm going to try to play more story driven games that feel more fulfilling to complete.

410
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,780
Interesting.

411
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,940
Yeah, see, that's kind of like, I'm kind of with you there.

412
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:10,540
I love games that are big in scope, like Elder Scrolls, you know, you know, five Skyrim or

413
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,540
something like that.

414
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,540
That was awesome.

415
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,540
That game is awesome.

416
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,760
But I think it's like you could spend hundreds of hours in it.

417
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,300
And I kind of like, that's why I like playing some of the Call of Duty games because the

418
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,100
campaign is so short.

419
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,100
It's done.

420
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,100
Cool.

421
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,100
I'm done.

422
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,100
All right.

423
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,100
If I want to play multiplayer, I can do that.

424
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,100
But I don't feel like I haven't completed anything in this.

425
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,100
And it's easy.

426
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,860
If you want me to get all the trophies or whatever, because it's all single player stuff,

427
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,860
sweet.

428
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,860
And that's it.

429
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:40,060
You know, whereas, you know, if I want to like 100% Skyrim, that's quite a lot of time.

430
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:45,140
Now, granted, that's enjoyable, but sometimes you just want to play other things.

431
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:49,020
And I think it's probably way more fulfilling to beat a game that's going to take you, you

432
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,220
know, 60 hours to beat like, I don't know, Dragon Age Inquisition or Skyrim or something

433
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:58,340
like that, as opposed to, I don't know, something like Flower, which I don't want to diminish

434
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,340
that game.

435
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,320
It's an amazing game in its own right, but it's only a two hour game.

436
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,620
It's an amazing two hour experience and I recommend it for everybody.

437
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:10,060
But, you know, I think beating a game that takes that like 60 hour investment probably

438
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,980
is worth, you know, especially if you're the guy, like that comment I read earlier, that's

439
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:19,260
doing two games a month, maybe give yourself more credit if you beat a BioWare game or

440
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:24,900
something versus, you know, oh, I beat, you know, a game that took me two hours to beat

441
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,900
type of thing.

442
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,900
Like quality over quality.

443
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,100
Well, I don't even want to say quality though, because like, you know, again, a game like

444
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,820
Gone Home was short.

445
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,900
And you know, I know some people even argue if that's a game period, but I think it is

446
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,960
an interactive experience that is absolutely worth experiencing, but it is short.

447
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,960
You know what I mean?

448
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:47,540
So in terms of, you know, your goals, I don't know if I would use the word quality, but

449
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:51,700
maybe just, you know, give the number of hours that it took you to beat something a little

450
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,700
more credit, I suppose.

451
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,700
Right?

452
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,700
Yeah.

453
00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:01,620
I remember seeing that, and the whole thing that, you know, Todd McFarland designed characters

454
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,460
and that was pretty sweet.

455
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:07,380
I thought that was one of the games with gold titles or something.

456
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:13,940
I thought it's in my library somewhere maybe, but yeah, maybe, I don't know.

457
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:19,500
I keep staring at, you know, Dragon Age, you know, Inquisition and Far Cry 4, I'm like,

458
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,100
eh, don't want to buy these.

459
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,260
You know, if you want, Loki, if you promise to bring it back next week, you can borrow

460
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,580
my copy of Inquisition just to give it a try and save it your every hour.

461
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,580
I'm not going to time.

462
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,580
It's not good, unfortunately.

463
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,580
Alright, fair enough.

464
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:35,420
Alright, well, we are going to get into our gaming weeks here shortly, however, I have

465
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:40,320
one more kickoff topic to get into tonight, and tonight, you know, being that it was a

466
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,180
slower news week, admittedly, we don't have a lot of huge stories tonight, you know, it's

467
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:49,420
just the way it is, we're going to get into our 2015 predictions tonight, which here at

468
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,300
OLR can sometimes be a little silly.

469
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,300
We're not necessarily that they're always going to be accurate.

470
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:58,540
But we're going to do that through a highly scientific process known as listless, and

471
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,740
we'll get to that a little later in the show.

472
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:08,500
But I thought it would be fun to go back and look at our 2014 list and see what came true

473
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,740
and what didn't come true from that list, the 2014 list.

474
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:18,160
Now the number one answer from the process as voted on by our listeners last year was

475
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,020
from Dark Sakura's original list.

476
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,580
I'm looking at the entire list of 15 answers.

477
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,340
We had five hosts participate last year because we had Jason in studio, and that was during

478
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,700
the period of time that Loki was calling in because of the new baby.

479
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,340
We had Alan in here as well.

480
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:39,180
So one of Jamie's answers ultimately end up winning the listless, and her answer was gaming

481
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,980
created advances in accessibility.

482
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:46,820
In other words, there would be some type of gaming advancement that would lead towards

483
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:52,120
more accessibility for handicapped or, you know, accessible gamers.

484
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,720
So looking at that, what's that?

485
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,080
Which I think has happened in a few different ways.

486
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,080
I wasn't really sure.

487
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,200
I mean, this is kind of a gray area answer.

488
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,760
How do you think it's happened, Dark Sakura?

489
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,760
Because I didn't see anything really clear cut, but I do feel like companies are more

490
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,760
aware.

491
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,760
Definitely.

492
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:14,180
Improvement in motion control, improvement in voice action activated, and looking in

493
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:23,940
terms of PC gaming, you've got improved, they're actually, I've run across, I mean, the devices

494
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,060
have been out for a while, but they're really getting a lot more advanced.

495
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:30,780
You have braille keyboards, you know, all kinds of ways that people are able to actually

496
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:34,280
interact with their games by getting their dialogue on a braille feedback pad.

497
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,360
You know, I would love to see something like that come out on a console, but I mean, we're

498
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,540
seeing it more and more.

499
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,760
It's slow, but it's still happening.

500
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,760
That's true.

501
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,940
At the end of the day, there's definitely been more of an awareness, even if we haven't

502
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:53,080
seen like, here is the physical piece of technology that actually made accessibility happen more.

503
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,660
I think we've definitely seen an awareness, and I think a large part of that is thanks

504
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:01,960
to organizations like AbleGamers and a lot of activism you see out there on the internet,

505
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,380
like trying to make companies more aware.

506
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,840
There are reasons you should have keys be mappable in games and things like this, and

507
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,880
buttons mappable on controllers.

508
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,840
I kind of give that answer half credit.

509
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,520
Even though there was like nothing black and white, we still are in a better spot now,

510
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,080
I think, than we were in 2014.

511
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,080
So there's that.

512
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,920
So, yay us, question mark.

513
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,620
Here's the rest of the answers on Dark Soccer's list from 2014.

514
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:33,160
This answer was eliminated in the elimination round, but shipping war on the new Mass Effect,

515
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,640
which I think we joked when it was eliminated, that's always going to happen no matter what.

516
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,320
That answer is too safe.

517
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:44,160
Has there been shipping wars broken out over what little tidbits we've seen to the next

518
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,960
Mass Effect, which is actually nothing.

519
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,300
We've seen nothing of the new Mass Effect.

520
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:54,400
But there are plenty of shipping wars in Dragon Age, wasn't there?

521
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,080
So I got that half right.

522
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,080
Wrong Bioware franchise.

523
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:04,560
All right, and Dark Soccer's third answer from the 2014 list was World of Warcraft loses

524
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,760
1 million subscribers.

525
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,120
And we have an answer that panned out to be half true.

526
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,840
Warcraft took a huge dive in subscriptions.

527
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,800
It lost them, but they found them again.

528
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,800
Exactly.

529
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,960
As Pandaria wore on, Warcraft lost a huge amount of subscribers.

530
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,080
I was well over a million.

531
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,640
I want to say they lost more like 2 million across the year.

532
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,600
But when the new expansion came out, they were quick to brag that they got them all

533
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,520
back and they were back over 10 million.

534
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:35,680
So once again, Dark Soccer's answer gets half credit.

535
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,680
So there you go.

536
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,680
Loki's list.

537
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,400
Loki's list got decimated last year.

538
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,960
He had an answer, get immunity.

539
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,480
But let's take a look back.

540
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,720
He had 3 DS games on the Wii U, which ended up getting eliminated because it was too close

541
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,120
to one of Alan's answers.

542
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,440
So he said 3 DS games on the Wii U.

543
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,440
Didn't happen.

544
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,680
I can't even get half credit for that.

545
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,680
Didn't happen.

546
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,160
Didn't they announce DS games on the Wii U?

547
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,480
I don't think they ever did.

548
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,600
Game Boy games came to the Wii U, but that had started in 2013.

549
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,640
And I think we all saw that that was opening the door to DS games, but we have yet to see

550
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,000
one on Virtual Console.

551
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,360
So unfortunately that didn't end up being true.

552
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:19,280
Now your answer that ended up getting immunity, Left 4 Dead 3 or Source 2 released.

553
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,280
Also didn't happen.

554
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:25,440
Yeah, why should I even count Valve on releasing something in a timely fashion?

555
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,920
That was just dumb.

556
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:32,360
And then also on your list, it said Wii U price cut and I believe you said Mario Kart

557
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,000
8 will flop, leading to a Wii U price cut was what you said.

558
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,120
I don't think I said it would flop, but I don't think...

559
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,120
You did.

560
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,120
I'll go back to the audio.

561
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,120
I don't think I said it was...

562
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,120
No.

563
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,120
I don't think it would have flopped.

564
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,600
I said I don't think it would do enough to...

565
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,220
I don't think it would be enough to sell systems.

566
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,480
And that wasn't necessarily true.

567
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,640
It did sell systems because it's a great game.

568
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,640
Yeah.

569
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,120
And, uh, but no Wii U price cut, surprisingly.

570
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:59,600
Yeah, that's because they're doing pretty good off of Smash and Super Mario, or Mario

571
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
Kart 8.

572
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:06,360
They've enhanced the value, they've put more in, I mean, like everybody gets a deluxe now

573
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,240
for what you were paying the basic before.

574
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,440
So they've kind of, you know, again, maybe I'd give you a quarter credit on this.

575
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,440
Nah, I wouldn't.

576
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,440
I wouldn't.

577
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,360
They didn't actually cut the price because of, you know, doing bad.

578
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:23,120
But still, I think what they've kind of done now is that they're, I mean, I don't know,

579
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:28,560
they're kind of in like a balance right now.

580
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,640
They're not getting any more third party support, but they're not necessarily losing more third

581
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,640
party support.

582
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,640
And the first party's kind of keeping everything afloat right now, but, I mean, as soon as

583
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,360
those first party games aren't coming out, or it's not like...

584
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,280
Because we had a pretty decent release schedule.

585
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,080
We had, you know, Mario Kart 8 and then Smash Brothers, and that was pretty big, and the

586
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,660
Zelda game was alright.

587
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:55,960
But I'm worried that, you know, if Zelda doesn't come out next year or something like that,

588
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,720
there's not going to be a whole ton to kind of keep it afloat.

589
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,560
I think right now it's just, that's, what's going to happen is once those first party

590
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,200
titles start drying up, or maybe it's not necessarily the releases that people might

591
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,400
want, you know, if it's a Pikmin 4 or something like that, then you might start seeing it

592
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,480
start to waver a bit.

593
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,280
I think it's non-negotiable that a new Zelda will come out next year, and I think that

594
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:22,280
is, that is orders from the top that Zelda will happen in 2015, it has to.

595
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,400
I think there's intense pressure at Nintendo.

596
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,400
I think other stuff will get delayed to pull those people to work on Zelda if they have

597
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,400
to.

598
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,160
I think Zelda is a must happen for Nintendo in 2015.

599
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,960
And I think it'll be great.

600
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,080
There's no reason to think it won't be amazing.

601
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,840
Nintendo puts out quality shit, so.

602
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,840
It looks fantastic.

603
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,840
Good for them.

604
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:47,000
Okay, going to Jason's list, now this is interesting because Jason had one of his answers eliminated,

605
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,840
but funny enough, Jason probably was more accurate than any of the rest of us.

606
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,020
Which means he needs to come back.

607
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,840
He's on the road tonight, by the way, if you guys are wondering why he didn't do the intro,

608
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,540
he's on the road tonight.

609
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:03,820
Jason said, Indy hit get signed or AAA port.

610
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,920
That's kind of, you know.

611
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:11,700
But Minecraft getting bought by Microsoft, I mean, that's the epitome of that answer

612
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,700
right there.

613
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,700
I think.

614
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,700
I would give Jason credit for that.

615
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:19,500
I mean, yeah, it was a safe answer, but Microsoft buying Minecraft was huge last year.

616
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,620
That was a big thing.

617
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:25,620
His next answer was Oculus Rift will run at 4K.

618
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,460
I don't know if this, I would have to ask, I would have to defer to the expert, Bobby

619
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,460
Blackwolf.

620
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,660
I'm not, Loki, are you in tune if this ended up happening?

621
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,660
I don't think it did.

622
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:37,140
Well, they don't have a final dev kit yet, and we don't know what this final specs are.

623
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,680
I don't think it did, but certainly we've seen progress on the Rift.

624
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:46,780
And then lastly, and this answer got eliminated by a very angry Alan, who is a fan boy, when

625
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:49,780
Jason said there will be no release of Half-Life 3.

626
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,340
You want to talk about a safe answer.

627
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,180
That was definitely a safe answer that was on the board.

628
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,180
All right.

629
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:59,780
And Bobby Blackwolf confirming in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, no 4K, Gear

630
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,740
VR is 1440p.

631
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,900
Okay.

632
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:07,820
So here was my list, and boy did I, oh my God, I didn't get a single one.

633
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,340
But then again, I was being a little silly.

634
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,780
So here was my list.

635
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:15,100
F-Zero Boner Party was my number one answer.

636
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,460
And I knew that wouldn't come true.

637
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,660
That was more wishful thinking that there'll be the year of Captain Falcon.

638
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:24,660
To be fair, I mean, you may have had a mini F-Zero Boner Party when you saw the DLC announcement

639
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,660
for...

640
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,660
Thank you.

641
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,660
You know what?

642
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,660
That's a good...

643
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,660
Thank you.

644
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,660
Thank you for that.

645
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,660
That is a good point.

646
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,660
Thank you.

647
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,660
I think...

648
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,660
And then you probably played it and you realized how crappy it was.

649
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:38,420
And we got the Captain Falcon amiibo, which I'm seeing more pictures of that one on Twitter

650
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,420
than any other.

651
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,540
And it's all pictures of his ass.

652
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:46,120
I can't possibly imagine what it is about Captain Falcon's ass that has everybody...

653
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,500
Because he has one now.

654
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,100
That ass.

655
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,100
You're anaconda.

656
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,100
Don't.

657
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,100
You're anaconda.

658
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,100
Okay.

659
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,100
Anyway.

660
00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:00,460
And my next answer was Microsoft jacks the Oculus Rift.

661
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:04,060
I think I kind of knew in the back of my mind that probably wasn't gonna happen.

662
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,720
But Facebook ended up jacking the Oculus Rift.

663
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,220
So oops on that.

664
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,620
Who would have thought?

665
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:14,160
And then my number three answer was so morbid.

666
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,800
Not as morbid as Alan's list.

667
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:22,200
But my number three answer was Ouya goes under, which I think I was in a fair position to

668
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,200
say last year.

669
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,200
They're made out of styrofoam, man.

670
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,800
You can't sink that thing.

671
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,800
You know what?

672
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:32,960
There are still a lot of indies that really swear by Ouya, and Ouya's definitely out there

673
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,960
to support indies.

674
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,920
So I can't hate on what Ouya's doing at all, and I don't.

675
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:42,400
But certainly I'm still kind of looking at it going, where's...

676
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,200
How are they gonna turn that thing into profits next year?

677
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,480
I don't know.

678
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,320
But anyway, Ouya is still around.

679
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,480
They did not go under.

680
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,320
All right, Alan's list.

681
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,040
Bethesda confirms Fallout 4.

682
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,400
I was hoping that'd be true, but no.

683
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,400
Yeah, me too.

684
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,400
Me too.

685
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
Maybe next year.

686
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
Didn't end up happening.

687
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,400
Didn't end up happening.

688
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,480
Nintendo DS titles on the eShop, and they are poorly done.

689
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,440
Also, no DS titles showed up.

690
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,260
We had Game Boy Advance, but we did not get Nintendo DS titles.

691
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,800
So Alan did not end up being correct on that.

692
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,960
And then this answer got eliminated right off the bat, because it was a little morbid.

693
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:23,920
You might remember last year, he said, a Nintendo godfather of gaming would pass away.

694
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,920
So that didn't happen.

695
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,920
We did have...

696
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:32,760
Now we had Ralph Baer, who would be the godfather of all gaming, passed away.

697
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:37,500
So Alan can maybe get half credit for that, because one could argue without Ralph Baer,

698
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,040
you would not have Nintendo at all.

699
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,560
So there you go, even though I guess Nintendo's business was playing cards.

700
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,320
And Awada was kind of sick.

701
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,600
I mean, thank god he made a recovery.

702
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,600
Thank god he made a recovery.

703
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:53,560
I don't want to be dark or morbid, but he did disappear for a little bit.

704
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Just saying.

705
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,560
Just saying.

706
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,560
Anyway.

707
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,560
So there you go.

708
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,480
So looking at our list of predictions on what came true, not a lot.

709
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:05,520
So don't give me ideas for games, because that could happen.

710
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,000
I could make that.

711
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
What?

712
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,640
I'm not done with my game yet.

713
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,640
I have a racetrack and everything.

714
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,640
Oh no, there's a chat in here.

715
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,440
Raginator said, I wonder if any would make an F-Zero type game where you race boners

716
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,320
for the vlog jam.

717
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,840
And I said, boner racing?

718
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:24,400
It'd be people with their flying dongs pulling the bodies along.

719
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,400
How old are you guys?

720
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,400
How old are you guys?

721
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,280
We should call it Cosmic Thrust.

722
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,280
You guys have issues.

723
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,280
All right.

724
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,280
I don't have issues.

725
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,280
Subscriptions.

726
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,720
We will get to our 2015 list a little later on in the show.

727
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,400
We have to get to what little gaming news there is this week, though.

728
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:45,200
But first, our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this

729
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,200
week.

730
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,440
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

731
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,840
Dragon Age.

732
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,840
Lots more Dragon Age?

733
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,840
More, more Dragon Age.

734
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,000
Why haven't you beat it yet?

735
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,840
Because I don't want my heart to be broken yet.

736
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,840
I see.

737
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,160
I'm Romancing Solas.

738
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,000
So that should be enough for all the people who've seen all the spoilers.

739
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I see.

740
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,960
I'm also doing, well, because I like sleep in the morning.

741
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,800
So I play Dragon Age after work.

742
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,480
And I've really just been running around exploring stuff.

743
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,280
Just actually taking scene porn in and killing dragons.

744
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,400
My thing now is killing dragons.

745
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,440
But I'm in a game called Dragon Age.

746
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,440
There are dragons?

747
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,440
Yes.

748
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,440
I'll be damned.

749
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,440
You can kill them.

750
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,440
They give you shit.

751
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:29,640
But right now I'm only level 21 and the dragon I'm trying to kill is like a level 22 dragon.

752
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,640
Is it that one in the Hinterlands?

753
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,640
He's very annoying.

754
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,640
There's three in the Hinterlands.

755
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,640
Oh, shit.

756
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,640
Not in the Hinterlands.

757
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,320
That was easy.

758
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,600
The three in Empress du Leon is where it is.

759
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,840
There's three of them there.

760
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,840
One of them I could kill.

761
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,080
It was a hard fight, but I could kill.

762
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,400
The other two I'm nowhere near yet.

763
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,240
But I've killed almost all the other easy dragons.

764
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,600
I'm going to go after a couple more.

765
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:57,480
And I'm just basically kind of doing a really slow, enjoying myself completionist kind of

766
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,480
run.

767
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,600
So I like that I can take my time with it.

768
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,400
I've just been enjoying myself.

769
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,400
Alan's been doing something similar.

770
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,040
I noticed he's been playing Dragon Age with all the hubble around Dragon Age Inquisition.

771
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,640
He decided, you know what, I'm going to start from the very beginning.

772
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,280
So he played all the way through Dragon Age again.

773
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,560
The original Dragon Age Origins and the DLC.

774
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,360
Now he's making his way through Dragon Age 2.

775
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:22,180
And I think he's at the end of Act 2 right now, he said was the last point I checked

776
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,180
with him.

777
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,180
He was there.

778
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,180
And then he will start Inquisition.

779
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,520
So he's like having a whole month of it.

780
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:31,720
I found one mission that I wish I had done differently because I like the best ending

781
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,840
of it better than the one I got.

782
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:39,120
So I'm going to definitely be doing a second playthrough, but I figured my next playthrough

783
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:43,440
I'm not going to go after Solas because, I mean, I'm going to cry a lot.

784
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,100
I know it's going to happen.

785
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:51,520
So I'm probably going to romance Cullen next because he's fluffy.

786
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,840
But I also played some Final Fantasy 14, because I'm trying to remember I'm paying for this.

787
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:02,120
So I played a little bit, I'm just, I really, really, really, really, really, really, really

788
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,120
hate What Does Fuck.

789
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:08,440
Great, now I can't remember the douchebag's name.

790
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,440
In 14?

791
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,440
In 14.

792
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,440
Um.

793
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,440
Who's the guy who annoys me so much?

794
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,440
Oh, Hildebrand.

795
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,440
Yeah.

796
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,440
Him.

797
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,440
He's like comic relief though.

798
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,440
He's not funny.

799
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,580
He is the antithesis of funny.

800
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:23,220
I don't find stupid funny.

801
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,740
So you must not watch a lot of Adam Sandler films.

802
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,500
Not really, actually.

803
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,760
And I hated, well, you know, I also hated Seinfeld, so.

804
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,440
But I mean, there's a few things that made me laugh, but I've actually been kind of giggling

805
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,700
over Ultros.

806
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,700
And then.

807
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,780
They do a really good job incorporating like the Final Fantasy 6.

808
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,660
There's like some direct quotes lifted out of 6 that Ultros reuses in 14.

809
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,660
It's great.

810
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:50,420
It's a great love letter to 6.

811
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:54,240
But I also, I've got all of my new gifted games downloading.

812
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,960
They were downloading while I was leaving.

813
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:03,040
And I actually, I did some Borderlands 2 on my pretty shiny MacBook Pro.

814
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,680
And more Fractal.

815
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,800
Because I love Fractal.

816
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,760
It's probably my favorite puzzle game to come out this decade.

817
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,760
Alright.

818
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,840
Loki, how was your gaming week?

819
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:18,680
Really all I did was I played just like a Marvel Super Heroes.

820
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:23,440
And I didn't really get anywhere other than buying some DLC that really was overpriced.

821
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,280
But now I have a bunch of characters I don't really give a shit about.

822
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,440
Like all the tertiary characters from Thor.

823
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,440
Whatever.

824
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,260
I don't even know who these guys are.

825
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:37,840
Some of them I swear were from The Hobbit, but okay.

826
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,840
What else?

827
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,280
That was pretty much it.

828
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,800
Just working on my VoG Jam title.

829
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,160
We do want to use this opportunity to remind people the VoG Jam is going on right now.

830
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,160
Create a game.

831
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,160
Make something, dammit.

832
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,880
The theme is a buggy game.

833
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,680
And the entries are due the next show.

834
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,480
Five o'clock Pacific, eight o'clock Eastern on Sunday the 11th.

835
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,800
So Loki's starting to realize he may have picked too big of a scope for a game to finish

836
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,800
in three weeks.

837
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,960
It's just taking a lot of time.

838
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,600
It's not that I had enough time.

839
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:12,760
It's just with the kids and everything it's hard to get time to work on stuff.

840
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:17,300
And I've stayed up late every night trying to do it.

841
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:21,500
And now that I have this bug in Unity that's making things look really ugly, it's kind

842
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,380
of pissing me off because it puts me even more behind.

843
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,380
You'll get there.

844
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,380
Ask for help.

845
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,380
Maybe somebody can help you.

846
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,380
Crack the code.

847
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,380
It's awesome.

848
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,420
Those guys we had on from Cooking with Unity a couple weeks ago, one of them is participating.

849
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,540
How amazing is that?

850
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,900
So I've seen some of the work you guys are doing on the VoG forums.

851
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,900
It's awesome.

852
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,300
I'm really hoping I can get something done.

853
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,460
I had a little setback because something with my day job came up.

854
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:48,540
So I have to work on that instead of a game when I have some free time.

855
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:52,500
So I really encourage people to make things for that and we will be talking about what

856
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,660
got submitted next week on the show.

857
00:37:54,660 --> 00:38:00,300
Remember, your submissions should come to Jam at VoGnetwork.com.

858
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,620
More information is available at VoGnetwork.com in our forums.

859
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:07,860
Bobby's compiled a special forum for the Jam and there's a whole post there detailing all

860
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:08,860
the information.

861
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,860
So check that out.

862
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,100
Meanwhile, my gaming week.

863
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:17,420
So yes, I did play other games because I was sick over New Year's.

864
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,620
So I was going to buy something to make myself feel better.

865
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:24,340
And I decided to buy something on the Wii U that I've seen a lot of people talking really

866
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,020
fondly about on Twitter and stuff.

867
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,020
So I said, you know what?

868
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,020
I'm going to buy Captain Toad.

869
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,100
There's a lot of people who have been talking very highly of this game so I'm going to check

870
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,100
out this game and see what it's all about.

871
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:38,740
So I played a little bit of Captain Toad and it's those little levels from Mario 3D World.

872
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:45,220
You had these special puzzle levels that starred Toad or Captain Toad but he couldn't jump

873
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,180
and he was restricted a little bit.

874
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:52,820
And some of it was more about spatialness because you would be able to rotate the screen

875
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:58,900
around and have to figure out what corridor leads to that gem or how do I get to the star

876
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,460
from there to do that without jumping.

877
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:10,940
And so Captain Toad is kind of a game made up of that whole spatialness and puzzleness.

878
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:17,620
I got to admit, I'm not loving it like a lot of people seem to that I know on Twitter and

879
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,980
so forth.

880
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,900
But it's cute.

881
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:25,780
And I think if you realize what type of game you're going to get, I think it's worth looking

882
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,780
at.

883
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:30,420
Now I will say the game did earn a lot of points with me when I got to this one level

884
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,140
that it was starting to do something really different.

885
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,460
And granted, I haven't beat the game yet, I haven't had enough time.

886
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,620
But if the game is going to do more of that with some of the stages later on, then I can

887
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:45,380
see where, okay, this is the mine car level is the first time you get in a level that

888
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,220
does something different.

889
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:53,140
And it's really cool because on the game pad, you see a Pokemon Snap style thing where you're

890
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:57,940
looking around and you can throw the vegetables at different obstacles that are in the way

891
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,940
and so forth.

892
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:04,180
But then on the game screen, you just see the static, you know, what you would expect

893
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:10,060
of Toad in the cart going around, you know, more like a static picture, like if the level

894
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,060
was not interactive.

895
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:16,540
So I like that kind of, you know, how it worked between the game pad and the television because,

896
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:20,100
you know, despite the fact that this whole game pad thing is really Nintendo's baby and

897
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:24,080
their idea, a lot of games aren't using it extensively.

898
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:28,260
So it was nice to see that kind of taken advantage of in that Captain Toad level.

899
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:35,540
And I also really liked that because it detected data from Mario 3D Land, you're able to play

900
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:41,180
some stages from Mario 3D Land as Captain Toad, which is trickier than it sounds because

901
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:45,660
remember Captain Toad can't jump and he moves very slow.

902
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:49,780
But it's kind of neat to have to re-approach the levels from that perspective.

903
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:54,440
So I kind of thought it was a neat little twist to kind of combine the two things there.

904
00:40:54,440 --> 00:41:02,000
But I still think $40 might be a little high for this, which I think was a lot of people's

905
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,940
reservation about this game.

906
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:11,440
But for what it is, it's still a Nintendo product and you know it has a lot of polish

907
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,960
and a lot of the levels are very vibrant.

908
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,740
The levels are very diverse.

909
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,500
That's a nice thing about it too, is that it's not like you're just playing the same

910
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,080
like planes level over and over.

911
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:25,560
Like even within the first four stages, you're in these completely different landscapes.

912
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,400
So in that regard, it's kind of neat and there are some different stuff that happens with

913
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,600
the challenges and the double cherries and things like that.

914
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:37,480
But I don't know, I guess I didn't fall in love with it the way I have other Wii U titles

915
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,480
this year.

916
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,960
Maybe I'm just not far enough into it.

917
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,240
I don't know.

918
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,520
But one thing, and this will be the last thing I'll say about Captain Toad, one thing I did

919
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,600
kind of feel like the game lacks compared to other very strong Nintendo titles for the

920
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,860
year is co-op.

921
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:55,320
There's really not a lot of reason to sit here and play this game with somebody else

922
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,320
in the same room.

923
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:00,700
There's nothing around that, unless it's something you unlock later, but you know, if it's behind

924
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:04,300
a lock and key, then I still consider it kind of not there, is that there's really not a

925
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,200
lot for more than one person to get involved with.

926
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,120
And when that's really Nintendo's strong point is creating these really strong multiplayer

927
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:15,840
fun games, like look at Mario Kart 8, look at the original Mario 3D World, look at, you

928
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:20,640
know, Super Smash Brothers Wii U, heck even Bayonetta 2 has an online mode.

929
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:26,080
You know, when you look at that being really Nintendo's strength, it is kind of a drawback

930
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:31,600
that Captain Toad is missing what is kind of Nintendo's forte in that regard.

931
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:37,760
So it's not bad, it's just not, I'm not really getting that same intense love for it I was

932
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,600
seeing a lot of on Twitter and so forth.

933
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:46,920
Going to the chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, DarkTetsuya says, the minecart level was great,

934
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,960
my brother was playing it and I was helping point out stuff to hit lol, it reminded me

935
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,160
of one of Miyamoto's tech demos back at E3 last year.

936
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,040
And maybe that's, you know, how it got incorporated.

937
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:03,440
Let's see, those are some of the comments from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

938
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:11,040
Also, and you'll get a kick out of this, because this was released on Virtual Console, Pokemon

939
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,840
Pinball came out on Virtual Console and I loved that game on Game Boy Advance, the Ruby

940
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,960
Sapphire Pokemon Pinball games, so I had to buy that and I was playing that on Virtual

941
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,380
Console and that's the first, excuse me, that's the first Game Boy Advance game I've played

942
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:28,520
on Virtual Console and it translates very well.

943
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:32,520
It's a surprising amount of fun to play on Wii U, it's like playing like a Super Nintendo

944
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,360
game on the TV or something.

945
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:39,920
So yeah, I like Pokemon Pinball, so that made me happy that that's out.

946
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,400
Otherwise a lot of the same old stuff that I've been playing, more Final Fantasy XIV,

947
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:50,600
more Diablo III seasonal before the season ends on February 2nd, I think they're saying,

948
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,600
and so on.

949
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,260
All right, let's get into some housekeeping real quick.

950
00:43:55,260 --> 00:44:00,860
We will not be here the week after next, that is Martin Luther King weekend, which would

951
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:08,500
be January the 18th, we will not be here that weekend, because I will be in Seattle

952
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,820
with Alan, we're doing a late celebration for our anniversary and the holidays and all

953
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:12,820
that.

954
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:15,860
Because I'm going to be gone for such a big chunk of the weekend, we're actually not really

955
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,340
going to be able to tape in advance either, so we are just not going to be here that week.

956
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:23,260
Sorry guys, taking a little break, but you can use the opportunity to catch up on the

957
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:29,860
backlog of OLR episodes or donate your time to another fantastic independent podcast,

958
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:33,740
there's so many great ones out there, I'd encourage you to look up.

959
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:39,000
Of course I'm going to point to those on our family at vognetwork.com, but no matter where

960
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,940
you pull your podcast from, do support other independent broadcasters, there's a lot of

961
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,260
hardworking people out there.

962
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:48,540
So that's in two weeks, there will be no live show and there will actually not be a podcast

963
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:52,420
that week either, we will finally be taking our holiday break a little late.

964
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:56,820
All right, let's go around and get into some news tonight.

965
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:01,980
What little there is this week, with it being the new year and a lot of companies still

966
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:06,420
off and people are working and there's not a lot of inertia coming off the Christmas

967
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:09,820
week, it's slow out there this week, but we have a little bit.

968
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:12,340
It's not coming out either, I mean it's just slow.

969
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:13,980
It's just how it is this time of year.

970
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:14,980
It's time to catch up.

971
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:19,060
That's right, this is the catch up time of year, absolutely.

972
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:24,180
And unfortunately one of the things you weren't able to catch up on was being able to be online

973
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:29,860
on PlayStation Network during this holiday season, because it was being DDOS and that

974
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,140
fun stuff.

975
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:36,860
Well, there is at least a little bit of an upside there, going to be compensating you

976
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:38,420
for the time that it was down.

977
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:44,940
So Sony is offering five extra days of PlayStation Plus, as well as a one time use 10% code for

978
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,980
the PlayStation Store.

979
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:51,300
And basically saying they wanted to show their appreciation for the user's patience after

980
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:54,220
the outage last month.

981
00:45:54,220 --> 00:46:01,620
And I guess the 10% off is one time discount off of a total cart purchase in the PlayStation

982
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:02,620
Store.

983
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:07,940
So, God I hope that wasn't used when I bought that $1.99 DLC the other day.

984
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:10,060
No, I think it's coming soon.

985
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:14,060
I think you have to physically put that in your cart in order, I think you'll know when

986
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,060
you're spending it.

987
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,060
Okay, I guess.

988
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:17,060
That would have sucked.

989
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:19,060
Saved 19 cents.

990
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:20,060
Thanks.

991
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,060
What do you think about that?

992
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:26,660
Do you think that's a fair compromise for PlayStation being inaccessible over the Christmas

993
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:27,660
holiday?

994
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,260
I think that's fine.

995
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:32,260
I mean, they didn't even really have to do this kind of thing, just give us the extra

996
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,260
days.

997
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:36,300
Okay, you weren't able to get on, so we're going to send it out this many days.

998
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:39,580
I don't see that as being that difficult.

999
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:43,500
I know I was kind of the one last week that gave this a little bit of a hard time, and

1000
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:47,420
I didn't want to sound like one of those whiners or gimme gimme, but the fact of the matter

1001
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:52,500
was PlayStation was down for four days, and whether that was because of an outside attack

1002
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:58,540
or not, we still are paying for that time, so I said, all I want is for Sony to come

1003
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:02,100
out and say, hey, something happened, we're going to give you those days back.

1004
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,540
And that's what they did, so I'm happy.

1005
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:07,340
They came back and gave even an extra day, they gave five days.

1006
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:13,500
Aren't you glad that the console of your console gaming choice doesn't disable you from playing

1007
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:18,860
games when you can't connect online like one console might have?

1008
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:26,100
Well, actually, if you are building up a library through PlayStation Plus, if you happen to

1009
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:30,300
be past your expiration day, which Christmas probably was expiration day on PlayStation

1010
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:34,420
Plus for a lot of people, if you're past that and it can't re-authenticate your PlayStation

1011
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:37,160
Plus license, you can't play those games.

1012
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:41,020
And Bobby was telling a story on his show tonight, he was trying to play Pinball Arcade,

1013
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:45,620
and the way that Farsight Studios set it up to authenticate the table licenses, because

1014
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:47,720
PlayStation Network was down, he couldn't play that.

1015
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:52,940
So even though Sony came out and made this big deal about, oh, you don't have to be online

1016
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:58,500
to authenticate, because of the way some games are developed, you do.

1017
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:03,900
And some of the biggest, I mean, one might argue that the biggest title on PlayStation

1018
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:08,180
4 this holiday season was Destiny, and that's online only.

1019
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:13,540
So I mean, I don't know, yes and no with that.

1020
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:18,740
But anyway, I don't want to sound like too much, I hate to be that cynical negative gamer.

1021
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:25,300
I mean, things aren't perfect sometimes, but at the end of the day, last week, this is

1022
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:29,420
all I said I wanted, and I think the compensation they're doing is fine.

1023
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:34,700
Maybe, I mean, if I really wanted to nickel and dime things, which I'm not, but I just

1024
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:41,580
want to say, maybe seven days, so that way everybody guaranteed gets a weekend, which

1025
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:46,680
makes up for, oh, this is a time of year when we're away on a holiday break or whatever,

1026
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:51,380
if everybody had that weekend, but five days is enough where you're going to probably get

1027
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,100
at least one day out of the weekend.

1028
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:57,340
So I'm not going to sit here and be like, oh, it's not good enough.

1029
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:58,340
It's fine.

1030
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:02,780
I'm happy, I'm not going to cancel PS Plus, I'm still very supportive of Sony and everything

1031
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:03,780
they're doing.

1032
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:10,580
I think this is fine, and the 10% off coupon is nice, but at the same time, it's kind of

1033
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:15,060
like, well, it's not like Sony doesn't stand a profit off of that.

1034
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:19,620
I mean, because if somebody is going to spend money on the PlayStation Store just to utilize

1035
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:24,260
this 10% off coupon that they've got, then they've still spent money on the PlayStation

1036
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,500
Store they might not have otherwise.

1037
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:30,840
So I sort of see that as a non-issue.

1038
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,880
That's a nice thing.

1039
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:38,840
And for those that buy stuff online anyway and might have a $50 game they were planning

1040
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:43,440
to buy digitally anyway, this is a really nice little reward for that.

1041
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,080
But I also see it just like any other coupon you might get in the mail.

1042
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:52,120
It's incentive for you to go and utilize the store and get something you might not have

1043
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:56,840
otherwise because, ooh, I got to get a bargain type of thing.

1044
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:00,960
But I mean, I realize there's a lot of people out there who buy a lot of games digitally.

1045
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:06,680
And so if you're going to stock up on stuff, if you bought two games online digitally in

1046
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:11,400
January and used this 10% off coupon, you could save like 10 bucks, which is nothing

1047
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,400
to scoff at.

1048
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,720
So this is going to be nice for some people.

1049
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,800
So there you go.

1050
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:21,800
Darsakra, I don't know if you have a comment on if you think this is sufficient enough

1051
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,520
compensation for the downtime.

1052
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,920
What do you think hearing this, what PlayStation is doing with this?

1053
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:30,040
Well, someone in corporate had to think it was sufficient.

1054
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,760
So there's always going to be people who are going to bitch.

1055
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:33,760
Yeah.

1056
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,320
Oh, we're not going to get this free thing or we don't think we have enough.

1057
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,320
Yeah.

1058
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,320
Too bad.

1059
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,320
Yeah.

1060
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:46,940
And I don't buy the whole, we should get free games out of it because I kind of think PlayStation

1061
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:52,400
Plus is really the leader in giving the free games as it is.

1062
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,000
They're way ahead of the competition.

1063
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,600
I realize Microsoft's giving away free games too, but let's be real, the bar of the stuff

1064
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:02,240
they've been giving away hasn't quite caught up to PlayStation yet.

1065
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:07,000
It's getting closer, but they were giving away years old games.

1066
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,960
And I think a lot of it had to do with that authentication stuff we were talking about

1067
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:10,960
when it first started.

1068
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:16,040
On 360, they couldn't, once you got it, you would have it forever, unlike PlayStation

1069
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,520
Plus, where if you lose PlayStation Plus, you lose the game.

1070
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,200
And Microsoft didn't have that for a long time, which was affecting the quality of the

1071
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,160
games they were giving away, I think.

1072
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,800
But now they fixed that, right?

1073
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:32,080
So now that's why the quality on Microsoft's gone up a little bit.

1074
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,440
And Rama says, free games, my ass.

1075
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,440
That's true.

1076
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,840
They're not really free because you are paying that fee for them, but I mean, it was a lot

1077
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:41,840
of games.

1078
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:48,080
I mean, at the end of the day, consumer is free to make their own choice, but as a gamer,

1079
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:52,660
one who uses consoles quite a bit, I found quite a bit of value in the PlayStation Plus

1080
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:53,660
games that came out.

1081
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:58,420
So it's just a bummer when the network's down and can't authenticate those games.

1082
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:05,500
So, all right, moving on to the next story, which has to do with people that get free

1083
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:11,060
games through their own dark methods, which is the Talos Principle.

1084
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:14,940
The Talos Principle, it was revealed this week that if you are one of the people that

1085
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:19,540
illegally downloaded this game, which Bobby last week on the show said was his favorite

1086
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:25,120
game of the year, 2014, if you illegally downloaded or pirated the Talos Principle,

1087
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:29,460
there's going to be an elevator in the game that will trap you in it, and there will be

1088
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:33,180
no way to progress past the elevator.

1089
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:38,320
And of course, this was discovered when somebody went to the forum to complain, help, I'm trapped

1090
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,320
in the elevator.

1091
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:43,080
I think they posted a screen cap and said, elevator doesn't work.

1092
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:47,460
And the first response in the thread said, congratulations, you must be the first one

1093
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:52,160
to show to the internet world what Croteam did this time to punish pirates.

1094
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,420
You should be proud of yourself.

1095
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:57,140
It'll be all over the internet in about 30 minutes, I'd say.

1096
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:00,860
And sure enough, I think this guy's response ended up being something like, at least I'll

1097
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:03,980
be famous for something, or something a little silly like that.

1098
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:08,600
But yeah, so if you pirated the Talos Principle, you're not going to be able to get past this

1099
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:13,380
particular elevator level that is until the pirates figure out their way around it.

1100
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:20,020
But this is just another entry, and kind of a long-running list of how games are getting

1101
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:23,420
back at pirates, or taking little jabs at them.

1102
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:29,040
Like there was that game dev tycoon game a year or two ago, where it was about making

1103
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:35,140
a game, and in a huge bit of irony, if you pirated that game, then piracy would ultimately

1104
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:39,340
destroy the game that you made, and you would not be able to beat the game, period.

1105
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:42,480
And then of course a lot of people know those stories about like Earthbound on the Super

1106
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:47,140
Nintendo, yes even cartridges had anti-piracy measures in them, the enemies would be super

1107
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,920
hard, and then what was it, you'd get to the very last boss in the game and it would delete

1108
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,760
your save, something like that was what Earthbound would do.

1109
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,320
And then there's other examples of this as well, you see this happening in a lot of games.

1110
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:02,800
But I think a lot of us kinda, I don't know about you guys, but I get a kick out of seeing

1111
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:07,840
the game companies take a little jab at piracy like this, because you know, they gotta sell

1112
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:11,680
the games to be able to afford to pay the people to make them.

1113
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:16,800
So, you know, however you want to justify piracy in your own mind, if you're the type

1114
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,200
of person that copies games and doesn't pay for them or whatever.

1115
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:24,440
I bet you're the same person that steals candy from babies!

1116
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,440
Pirates.

1117
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,800
But the reality is, if they can't pay their employees to make the game, then there's not

1118
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,800
going to be a game.

1119
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,320
That's, you know, just what it is.

1120
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:37,920
So I always find these little tongue-in-cheek ways of getting back at the pirates kind of

1121
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:38,920
funny.

1122
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:43,760
And then at least it ends up being a demo for the game, and if people decide they like

1123
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,040
the game enough, maybe they'll put down the money to buy it.

1124
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,040
Nope, they'll just patch it.

1125
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,640
Yeah, unfortunately that probably is what'll happen.

1126
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,640
Alright.

1127
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:54,640
Nope.

1128
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,980
Well, I thought it was a clever little thing anyway.

1129
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:58,400
That is clever.

1130
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,720
That's a game in my backlog that I definitely want to get to as the Talos Principle, for

1131
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:03,720
sure.

1132
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,900
So, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1133
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,880
We never get to our backlog, what are you talking about?

1134
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:08,880
I know, right?

1135
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,240
Well, there is a little bit of news out of Steamland, and it actually has to do with

1136
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:16,160
two Sega games that are in the same franchise.

1137
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:23,160
Aliens, Colonial Marines, and Aliens vs. Predator are gone through Steam.

1138
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,160
Gone!

1139
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:28,600
The chances are that this probably has to do with the licenses expiring, so they need

1140
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:32,520
to renew the licenses before they'll be back for purchase.

1141
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,080
But yeah, they are right now gone.

1142
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:38,680
I mean, didn't we have the same thing with Crysis before?

1143
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:45,400
Well, actually, licensed games, a lot of them have disappeared in digital distribution channels

1144
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,920
the end of this year.

1145
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:50,000
Scott Pilgrim, the game on console is no longer there.

1146
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Uno on Xbox.

1147
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,260
Well, you can still get the digital versions on some online sites, like I think Green Man

1148
00:55:55,260 --> 00:56:00,320
Gaming still offers them, and you can activate them on Steam, or you can buy the physical

1149
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,320
versions.

1150
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,320
Yeah.

1151
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:05,640
I mean, Alien Isolation was supposed to be pretty darn good.

1152
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:08,560
Yeah, I'm hearing good things about that, but who's gonna really buy Alien and Colonial

1153
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,560
Marines?

1154
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,560
Who's gonna be buying that?

1155
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:14,560
I wanted to like that game just because it has Hendrickson in it.

1156
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:22,440
And I'll just listen to him and go, Bishop, or, you know, what was his face in Mass Effect?

1157
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,440
I'm here.

1158
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,440
Hackett.

1159
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,440
Yeah, Hackett.

1160
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,440
Commander Hackett.

1161
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,440
Admiral.

1162
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,440
Admiral, sorry.

1163
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:32,720
I will say, hands down, that Alien Isolation was the scariest game of the year last year

1164
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,240
and it's worth checking out.

1165
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,040
Scarier than Five Nights at Freddy's?

1166
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,480
Scarier than Five Nights at Freddy's?

1167
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,880
Scarier than P.T.?

1168
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,940
Scarier than Slender Man?

1169
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:42,940
Like scarier than all of that?

1170
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:47,960
Well, you know the first Alien, for the movies that is, was supposed to be a space horror

1171
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,960
movie.

1172
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:49,960
Right.

1173
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:55,780
And then, Aliens was more done as an action sci-fi, you know, which honestly, Aliens is

1174
00:56:55,780 --> 00:57:00,500
probably one of the best movies of our generation.

1175
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,500
Right.

1176
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:06,160
Which is why they still make video games out of it, even though maybe the third and fourth

1177
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:10,580
movie weren't as, you know, legendary as that second movie.

1178
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:15,460
The fact that that movie is so fucking good is why they keep making games out of it.

1179
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:17,380
I will sit and just watch the extended cut.

1180
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:21,900
And I really wanted to watch Resurrection, just to hear the Joss dialogue, but apparently

1181
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:25,740
they just ruined the whole story that he had written.

1182
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:30,940
But I like that there are games that are going back to the feel of the first movie,

1183
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:34,080
having it be kind of a survival horror sort of thing.

1184
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:37,980
And that's why I wanted to play Isolation, but I had too many games and never bought

1185
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:38,980
it.

1186
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:43,660
You know, it's funny, I saw that Alien Resurrection in theaters years and years ago, and you know

1187
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:46,320
I don't get out to movies an awful lot, but that was, I think that movie came out when

1188
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:49,500
I was in college when I went to the movies a little more, and I went and saw that one.

1189
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:52,580
I don't remember hating it, like I thought it was kind of like, okay, it's just a big

1190
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:58,480
silly action movie, which Aliens is not exactly a big silly movie, like it's just a really

1191
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,480
good...

1192
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,700
It's a hardcore awesome action film.

1193
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:04,420
So it's kind of hard to see a series like that devolve into silly action movies.

1194
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,020
It has some of the best ad lib stuff in it too.

1195
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:07,980
Yeah, but I don't remember hating Alien Resurrection.

1196
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:12,180
Well, the thing is that from everyone that's told me that you can see the good movie it

1197
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:16,920
tried to be, except for people going in and changing shit.

1198
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,820
And I had two reasons for wanting to see it.

1199
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:20,340
Well, three reasons.

1200
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:21,340
Sigourney Weaver.

1201
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:22,340
Yep.

1202
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,340
I love Winona Ryder.

1203
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:25,340
I love her so much.

1204
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:26,340
I really love her.

1205
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:30,060
I mean, she's kind of, ever since that shoplifting incident, really kind of ruined her, didn't

1206
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:31,060
it?

1207
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:32,240
Well, she played Spock's mom and that was awesome.

1208
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,240
That was awesome.

1209
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,240
I lived for that.

1210
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,060
And, well, you should watch the deleted scenes she was in in that too.

1211
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:38,060
Oh, I haven't seen that.

1212
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:39,060
I need to.

1213
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:42,460
But the other thing was script by Joss.

1214
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:44,240
And I like Whedon dialogue.

1215
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,240
I'm sorry.

1216
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:49,580
And just, I think it would be heartbreaking to go see it, knowing what it could have been.

1217
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:52,020
Well, it was also a very famous director that did that.

1218
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:55,500
And I, of course I say that and now I can't remember the guy's name, but he had made City

1219
00:58:55,500 --> 00:59:00,700
of Lost Children, Delicatessen, and all these very visual movies.

1220
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:02,580
I love City of Lost Children.

1221
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,580
Yeah.

1222
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:05,260
It was that, that was the director based on that movie.

1223
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:08,300
They asked him to do Alien Resurrection, a French guy, and I can't remember the guy's

1224
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:09,300
name.

1225
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:10,300
Somebody in chat will yell it out.

1226
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:12,300
That's why I love doing this live.

1227
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:13,300
Who needs Google?

1228
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:16,300
I got a chat room.

1229
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:18,980
So anyway, uh, let's see it.

1230
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:21,460
Look in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

1231
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:24,620
Rageinator says, yeah, I saw Alien Resurrection in theaters too.

1232
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:27,860
Sadly enough, not too long after that, my grandmother was rushed to the hospital and

1233
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:28,860
ultimately died.

1234
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:29,860
Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that.

1235
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:34,940
That kind of sucks when you have to associate something that might've been pretty good with

1236
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:35,940
a really bad memory.

1237
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:38,700
But anyway, I don't want to take this too much to a dark place.

1238
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:43,320
Tiger Claw says you heard about Neil Blomkamp wanting to do an Alien 5.

1239
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,320
That looked pretty awesome.

1240
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,060
I'm sure there's a lot of people.

1241
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:47,060
That looked pretty awesome.

1242
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:48,060
That want to do an Alien 5.

1243
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:52,140
Well, he was supposed to, I guess, originally, yeah, he was going to do that as his debut.

1244
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:53,140
Jean-Pierre Jeunet.

1245
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:54,140
Thank you.

1246
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:55,140
Thank you.

1247
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:56,140
STR 100 Matt.

1248
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:57,140
Jean-Pierre Jeunet.

1249
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:58,140
Yeah.

1250
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:00,100
The, the, uh, was it artwork for that looked pretty sweet.

1251
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:01,100
And that's it.

1252
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,200
I knew he did Amelie.

1253
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:07,100
So he came after Alien Resurrection, he did Amelie, which is like one of.

1254
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:08,700
I need to finish that movie.

1255
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:13,340
It's one of, it's honestly like one of the best movies of the last decade.

1256
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:15,380
I can actually follow most of the dialogue in it too.

1257
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:16,380
I see.

1258
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:17,380
Oh, really?

1259
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:20,260
And I don't know if you remember, remember when I got a really, really short haircut?

1260
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:21,700
I got her haircut.

1261
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:25,620
And then Amelie Resurrection just gets really strange when they start trying to blend the

1262
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:26,620
two genres together.

1263
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:29,620
It's just, I didn't understand that, but okay.

1264
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:30,980
Oh, Ron Perlman.

1265
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:34,460
But watching Winona Ryder in that was a lot of fun too.

1266
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:36,860
Making that safe expression.

1267
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:40,920
I have a lot of love though for, for Aliens in the first movie.

1268
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,340
Actually even liked the third one, so maybe I should see Resurrection.

1269
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:46,380
I was trying to see what else John, that director's done.

1270
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:49,420
He did a movie called A Very Long Engagement, which I don't remember that movie.

1271
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:50,420
I've heard of it.

1272
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,020
But he did that movie.

1273
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:55,060
And then he was kind of on a break for a little while.

1274
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:58,860
He did a movie in 2013 called The Young and Prodigious T.S.

1275
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:00,120
Spivet.

1276
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,740
Never heard of that.

1277
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:02,860
Never heard of that.

1278
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:05,620
But Helena Bonham- We just need to get guns back for another

1279
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:06,620
second though.

1280
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:09,420
Oh my God, Helena Bonham Carter's in that though, and she, she is a queen.

1281
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:11,140
She is a queen in acting.

1282
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:15,500
I mean, come on, Helena Bonham Carter, like in every Tim Burton movie, just fucking steals

1283
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:16,500
it.

1284
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:17,500
She left him.

1285
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:18,500
Yeah, I heard about that.

1286
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,220
I think she's going to go for Johnny Depp.

1287
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:22,220
I don't know.

1288
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,260
It's the OLR Hollywood gossip hour.

1289
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:26,380
This is what happens when there's no gaming news.

1290
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:30,700
But it started from a second of how awesome the Alien franchise could be.

1291
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,100
You want to talk about like, I don't know, that-

1292
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:34,700
No, I want to talk about Winona Ryder.

1293
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:38,060
I want to talk more about Winona Ryder.

1294
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:39,060
Winona Ryder?

1295
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:40,060
Let's talk about that.

1296
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:41,060
Alright, yes.

1297
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:42,060
No, Beetlejuice 2.

1298
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:44,820
I'm so fucking psyched to see that whenever the hell that comes out.

1299
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:45,820
That's going to be fantastic.

1300
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:47,100
Okay, okay, wait.

1301
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:49,180
Michael Keaton will be in a wheelchair by the time he-

1302
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:50,180
I don't care.

1303
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:51,180
It'll still be good.

1304
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:52,420
That's what CG is for.

1305
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:54,020
Ranma wins the internet today.

1306
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:55,020
What?

1307
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:59,440
No, they're fighting for custody over Johnny Depp.

1308
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:04,620
I'm sorry, but yeah, Tim Burton- Johnny Depp is a maniac pixie girl.

1309
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:08,020
The definitive Burton- Look, I know you want us to talk games, but there's no fucking news

1310
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:09,320
this week, so deal with it.

1311
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:14,480
The definitive Burton film for me, which is also a Winona Ryder classic and a Johnny

1312
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:19,000
Depp classic, and probably one of my favorite movies ever, is Edward Scissorhands.

1313
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I love that movie.

1314
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
The movie is so fucking good.

1315
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I cry every time.

1316
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Every time.

1317
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Like a little baby.

1318
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Every time she's dancing in the-

1319
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
If I cry-

1320
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Every time she's dancing in the snow, I cry.

1321
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Every time.

1322
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
If I watch it right now, I'd be crying green tears.

1323
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I would-

1324
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I have green mascara too.

1325
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,800
We need to do like a Let's React video to watching Edward Scissorhands.

1326
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:33,800
Let's do it.

1327
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,400
Isn't that the thing people do on YouTube?

1328
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:36,400
Let's react.

1329
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,400
Let's do it.

1330
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,760
That's what thousands and millions of people have seen, but you want to see our reaction

1331
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:41,760
to it.

1332
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,760
Do the thing.

1333
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:43,760
Do the thing.

1334
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,760
Loki, you want to join us for a Let's React to Edward Scissorhands?

1335
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,760
I don't get affected that much by Edward Scissorhands.

1336
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,960
You wouldn't cry manly tears just a little bit?

1337
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:52,960
I like the movie.

1338
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,200
I think it's awesome, but I'm not going to cry over it.

1339
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:59,660
But we need your man tears.

1340
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:02,400
As a proper feminist, I thrive on the tears of men.

1341
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,400
I'm kidding.

1342
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,400
I'm kidding.

1343
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,400
That's bad.

1344
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,400
All right.

1345
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:14,600
Raginator says in chat, the only Burton movie that I cared for was the 1989 Batman.

1346
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:15,600
I prefer-

1347
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,960
Speaking of which, the NES game is fucking amazing.

1348
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:21,200
I preferred Batman Returns, not the game because the game was kind of crap.

1349
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:25,600
The movie Batman Returns, as much as I understand why people hated the penguin, Catwoman was

1350
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:26,760
just perfection.

1351
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,500
Nobody will ever match Michelle Pfeiffer.

1352
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,800
She got the whip scene in one take.

1353
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:31,800
Amazing.

1354
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:32,800
I love her.

1355
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,380
And she was in Grease 2.

1356
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:36,040
I don't mind Danny DeVito as a penguin.

1357
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,200
I thought it was okay.

1358
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:41,100
And Dungeon Buster says in chat, Vincent Price almost gave him real hands.

1359
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:42,100
That's right.

1360
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:46,360
One of Vincent Price's last roles was in that movie.

1361
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,360
I know.

1362
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,360
Let's just think about Vincent Price for a minute.

1363
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,700
We're going to let Loki do the next story because it's his anyway.

1364
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:55,180
And Rob and I are just going to sit in a corner and eat these chocolate chip cookies and cry.

1365
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:56,180
That's fine.

1366
01:03:56,180 --> 01:04:00,520
Rob, I hope you have tissues because this is expensive mascara.

1367
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,160
It's Pantone Emerald Green today.

1368
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,160
Hello.

1369
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,960
But there's actually Kleenex on the table for the show.

1370
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:05,960
It's like-

1371
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:06,960
I'm sorry.

1372
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:08,720
Next story.

1373
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:09,720
Loki, take us back to games.

1374
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:13,720
Since I didn't read the fine print on this story originally, today I was like, ooh, January,

1375
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:16,200
I'm going to see what new PlayStation Plus games are on there.

1376
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,880
Nope, they're not there yet.

1377
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:20,360
But yes, they will be as of Tuesday.

1378
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,960
And what can you expect on PlayStation Plus for the month of January?

1379
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,640
Well, actually some pretty cool stuff.

1380
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:28,840
For example, on PlayStation 4, as we already knew, we're getting Infamous First Light,

1381
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:32,920
which is the standalone expansion for Infamous Second Son.

1382
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:37,680
And then also the indie game is Swapper, will be as part of the PlayStation 4 section.

1383
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:42,400
And then for PlayStation 3, you get Prototype 2 and DuckTales Remastered.

1384
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:49,520
And then finally on the Vita, Woah Dave and Duke Nukem 3D Megaton Edition, which that's

1385
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:53,580
awesome that you can play Duke Nukem 3D on your Vita.

1386
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:55,260
There's a reason to have a Vita right there.

1387
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:57,120
Or a PlayStation TV, I guess.

1388
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:00,960
Did you know that Duke Nukem 3D is actually now in the current Humble Bundle?

1389
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,440
I did actually hear about that.

1390
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,000
I think we're going to talk more about the Humble Bundle that's up right now later in

1391
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
the show.

1392
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
But yeah, I noticed that.

1393
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
That's the problem with the Humble Bundles.

1394
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,720
I'm starting to own all the games that are on every single one now.

1395
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,880
Yeah, but you can actually gift your codes now.

1396
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:18,360
I understand that, but I have my gift code library or whatever is getting about be as

1397
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,360
big as my Steam library.

1398
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:20,360
I'm being pointed at.

1399
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:22,880
You were talking before the show and you probably don't want me to bring this up on air, but

1400
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:23,880
I don't care.

1401
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:26,320
You were talking before the show about your idea about the multiplayer streams that you

1402
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:30,440
and I and maybe Loki can do on Twitch or whatever.

1403
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,920
We fucking need to do Duke Nukem.

1404
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,800
Oh, no, no, no, not even Duke Nukem Forever.

1405
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:35,800
It can't be that shit.

1406
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,800
It has to be Duke Nukem 3D Deathmatch.

1407
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:38,800
In the bundle, Duke Nukem 3D.

1408
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:39,800
Deathmatch.

1409
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:40,800
Deathmatch Duke Nukem 3D.

1410
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:41,800
Where you can put in the voice macros.

1411
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:42,960
We can get Loki to do that one.

1412
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:43,960
You can put in the voice macros.

1413
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:44,960
I don't remember my PC.

1414
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,400
Rob, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1415
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,740
There are special things about Duke Nukem 3D.

1416
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:52,240
It was my first land game.

1417
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,240
Mobicon 1995.

1418
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:58,440
Oh, I've told the story about the college dorms and the dial-up and playing Duke Nukem

1419
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:03,640
3D where us little nerds, me and my best friend in the dorms in college.

1420
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:04,640
We were neighbors.

1421
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:07,980
We lived right next to each other and adjoining rooms that were next to each other.

1422
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:13,880
And all the bros, sports player, football guys would love to watch us play.

1423
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:18,960
And they were the biggest drama queens out of anybody I've ever met in my life because

1424
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,080
they would be gossiping like, where you at?

1425
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,080
Where you at?

1426
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:24,520
And then they'd look and then they would run to the other room and tell my friend where

1427
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:26,600
I'm hiding and where I'm camping so that he could kill me.

1428
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:27,600
Those bitches.

1429
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,520
I'm like you little gossipy bitches.

1430
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,520
Those catty bitches.

1431
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:31,520
Go out and throw your ball.

1432
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:35,600
I wish I had some of my old maps they made during high school.

1433
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,920
There are some pretty awesome maps.

1434
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:41,800
You're probably the type that made a map where somebody would fall an entire mile down the

1435
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:45,000
map for no good reason than you wanted them to do that.

1436
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I did.

1437
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Of course you did.

1438
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
But no, it wasn't.

1439
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,360
It was a great reason because you could do midair battles.

1440
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:55,280
But yes, I literally, because you hit page down to lower the floor of the map.

1441
01:06:55,280 --> 01:07:00,240
So I put a paperweight on page down and went and had lunch and came back and that was part

1442
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,460
of my map.

1443
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:04,720
The fall was a good five to six minutes long.

1444
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:08,960
But Duke Nukem 3D gave me one of my favorite, favorite insults ever.

1445
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:11,980
Your face, your ass, what's the difference?

1446
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:17,240
And I still have a WAV file from that back from AOL 2.5 days when you can play WAV files

1447
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:21,500
in chat rooms and it's in my damn WAV file collection.

1448
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,280
You could do that on instant messenger too.

1449
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,280
Yes, you could.

1450
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,280
That's what we did before emoticons.

1451
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,280
Yeah.

1452
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:29,280
We played WAVs.

1453
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,280
Yeah.

1454
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:31,400
You would send the WAV on AOL instant messenger.

1455
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,120
Your face, your ass, what's the difference?

1456
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,720
And today we have the smiling pile of poop emoticon.

1457
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:38,480
Oh the smiling pile of poop.

1458
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:39,480
You know what?

1459
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:40,480
What?

1460
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:45,920
I used to have a theme song that would play every time I'd go into a chat room back in

1461
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,760
the Sailor Moon chat room on AOL.

1462
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,160
I'm sure that wasn't annoying whatsoever.

1463
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:52,320
Who remembers Town Square Sailor Moon?

1464
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:53,320
I do.

1465
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:59,240
Oh look at this, you gotta love the Google-Fu of the live chatters.

1466
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,240
You gotta love this.

1467
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:03,320
Tigerclaw dug this up in like 30 seconds.

1468
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:06,240
Your face, your ass, what's the difference?

1469
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,400
Oh yeah.

1470
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:11,520
We also had a really horrible one that we would use, and I know it's not politically

1471
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:18,320
correct but I'm gonna say it anyway, is like, who are you, the poster child for abortion?

1472
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:19,320
Who was it?

1473
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:20,320
I don't remember that one, didn't I?

1474
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:22,560
It was a voice macro that one of my friends made.

1475
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:28,160
Who was it that used to do that during, who was it, it was one of the games we'd play

1476
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:32,760
like a VOG game night or something like that that someone would play those macros through.

1477
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:39,120
That was when we were playing Perfect Dark, and I want to say it was like me and Breslull,

1478
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:43,640
maybe Travis Donovan was in on that too, but I think it was SSGA 100 Matt had one of those

1479
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:47,440
little like adapter things for the Xbox 360 controller so he could drop in those little

1480
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:51,200
clips while we're trying to play on Xbox, I think it was like a Perfect Dark match we

1481
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:55,780
were all playing, and SSGA 100 Matt was being a little smart ass, so I think he called into

1482
01:08:55,780 --> 01:09:00,480
the show and talked about it around that time, just go look up the show from whenever Perfect

1483
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:01,520
Dark was released.

1484
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:06,560
For the record, I would never say something like that to somebody.

1485
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:07,560
To their face.

1486
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,920
No, ever, because I don't think that's something they make fun of.

1487
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:11,920
Alright.

1488
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,240
I'm a good girl, dammit!

1489
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,240
Mmhmm.

1490
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,240
Alright.

1491
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:22,320
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

1492
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,880
use the passphrase, hammer.

1493
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:25,880
Let's move on.

1494
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:29,040
Well, if you're a good girl that wants to be bad, very very very bad, you could play

1495
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:35,200
a very naughty, very graphic, very gory game, such as Mortal Kombat X.

1496
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,920
Darsaka, are you looking forward to Mortal Kombat X?

1497
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:38,920
Fuck no.

1498
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,680
I thought this would be the type of game that's up your alley.

1499
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:45,960
I don't know, these, I like me some Mortal Kombat, don't get me wrong, it's always been

1500
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:52,760
my favorite fighting franchise because it's a little bit over the top and silly and cartoon

1501
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:59,460
violent, but when I'm seeing the new one and the movies and stuff and the fatality images

1502
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:03,360
that are coming from the new Mortal Kombat, I'm like, this is starting to get a little

1503
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:04,360
too real for me.

1504
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:08,920
I mean, I realize it's over the top, but now we're crossing that line into Saw movie territory

1505
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,480
and I don't know how that makes me feel.

1506
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:11,480
That's awesome.

1507
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:12,480
Yeah.

1508
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:18,520
I don't know, some of the stuff is, it's gross, but regardless, I'll probably make my mom

1509
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:22,920
play this one too and record it and put it on the internet because it's funny.

1510
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:27,720
But Mortal Kombat X, some more information came out about this one, and this is thanks

1511
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:33,640
to a Finnish gaming magazine who I guess got to see some more information by taking a trip

1512
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:40,000
to the studios, and one of the new fighters that they unveiled is an older Kung Lao because

1513
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
this game does take place a little later on in the Mortal Kombat history.

1514
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,920
So now you have a Kung Lao who still has the hat with a bunch of spikes on it, but now

1515
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:54,920
a little bit of the gray mustache and beard thing going on there, and they talk about

1516
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:59,200
that some of the differences with the Tempest and Buzzsaw and Hat Trick variations are some

1517
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,160
of the biggest ones yet.

1518
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:04,940
He uses more spinning attacks and has the ability to set his hat to spin around him

1519
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:06,560
as a shield of sorts.

1520
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:10,800
And the Buzzsaw variation, his hat is sharpened with razor blade edges and allows the player

1521
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,880
to control the hat that throws more.

1522
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:16,720
And then Hat Trick is an experimental one because you can throw and call back your hat

1523
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:18,560
at any point you want.

1524
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:22,420
This keeps the opponent on their toes because the hat can extend combos.

1525
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:25,960
Don't forget the fighters in Mortal Kombat X, they're going to have these different variations.

1526
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,680
That's part of the game.

1527
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:31,000
They'll be different flavors of the same character.

1528
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,800
It's kind of their experimental place that they're going.

1529
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,180
So yeah, that's pretty neat.

1530
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:41,200
Some other little tidbits on Mortal Kombat X. Ed Boon talking about that the online features

1531
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,660
are more complex this time around.

1532
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:48,000
When you start the game, you get to choose your own alliance from five different options.

1533
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,820
The Lin Kuei, the White Lotus, the Brotherhood of Shadows, the Special Force, and the Black

1534
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:52,820
Dragon.

1535
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:56,740
And so your team will be gathering battle points for the team, which will decide how

1536
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:59,900
the game menus look in single and multiplayer.

1537
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:04,980
So every player contributes to the entirety, whether or not you prefer the social aspects

1538
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:05,980
or playing by yourself.

1539
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:11,800
That sounds kind of neat, that everybody will be championing a different faction, and whatever

1540
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,820
faction is in the lead kind of controls what everybody sees.

1541
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:22,060
And you're Slytherin, and you're Hufflepuff, and you're Gryffindor.

1542
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:28,320
Harry has decapitated his opponent, ten points to Gryffindor.

1543
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,100
It's extreme quidditch is what this all is.

1544
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:35,740
Kung Lao's just going to hop on a broom and fly around, and him and Cassie Cage and all

1545
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:40,740
these other new people that are showing up in the game.

1546
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:43,820
Have you seen some of the fatalities out of Mortal Kombat X?

1547
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:48,740
I gotta say, Joystiq ran an article this week talking about, I don't know, it was talking

1548
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:51,500
about why do we like gory games so damn much or whatever.

1549
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:55,540
And there was some picture that went with the article that's like this new bug queen

1550
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:58,980
or whatever she is that's one of the new playable characters in the game.

1551
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:04,940
It was a gif of, and yes I said gif, deal with it, it was a gif of her fatality where

1552
01:13:04,940 --> 01:13:09,900
these bugs fly out and eat Scorpion's head.

1553
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:14,500
It's not just enough, like in the old games it would have been LOL, his face melted and

1554
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:15,500
that's it.

1555
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,620
But it wasn't enough because now it has to go over the top.

1556
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:22,020
Not only do the bugs eat away his face, but then they eat so much of his face that his

1557
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:28,260
jaw snaps off, then his head falls off and rolls on the ground, and if that wasn't enough,

1558
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:31,540
she takes her heel and stomps out his head.

1559
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:34,600
She just did a hacky sack with it.

1560
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:41,720
So it's like, and all of this on the Playstation 4 and Xbox One and this generation of gaming's

1561
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:44,640
ultra photorealistic technology.

1562
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,600
That's why even I'm starting to take after my mother.

1563
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:48,600
That's gross.

1564
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:49,600
That is so gross.

1565
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,360
In this day and age of like indie games and being able to make whatever you want, why

1566
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:57,120
don't we get like a really, really, really over the top thrill kill type game?

1567
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:01,360
Like just so beyond tasteful.

1568
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:05,200
Well there's that very controversial.

1569
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,200
What is it?

1570
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:07,200
Hatred is the name of that game?

1571
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:10,920
Surely you've heard about this because there's a whole, there's a whole back and forth about

1572
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:11,920
the Steam Greenlight.

1573
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:19,800
Well, it's back now because that's kind of where, that kind of, it's too much for me.

1574
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:20,800
Too much.

1575
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,000
Too much.

1576
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:28,120
But I also think the Saw movies and those type of ultra gore movies don't exactly contribute

1577
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:29,880
a lot either and I don't watch them.

1578
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:33,520
So I at least apply that logic consistently.

1579
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:40,480
Anyway, all right, let's move on and we're going to travel around the world and check

1580
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:41,880
out some release dates here in a minute.

1581
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:46,480
But first, Dark Sakura has something a little different, but you know, there wasn't a lot

1582
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:47,480
of news.

1583
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:48,480
So we have different things.

1584
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:51,400
Well, you know, I talk about science.

1585
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,400
There's nothing wrong with science.

1586
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,400
Yeah.

1587
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:59,840
So basically it's not necessarily video game, but it's video game-ish because it's a simulation.

1588
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:05,160
They're actually using data from airport x-ray simulations to help with security and

1589
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:07,760
cancer screening.

1590
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:13,200
Basically for people who use security x-rays over and over again, the machines, they become

1591
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:17,600
adept at recognizing certain patterns, what certain contraband looks like.

1592
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,280
And so it builds up their reaction time.

1593
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:23,520
They could spot it in an instant and they're using the same type of simulation to help

1594
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:29,080
people recognize certain things a lot faster.

1595
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:35,000
Basically they are using the simulations to help them find things that they couldn't

1596
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,800
otherwise in a lab environment.

1597
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:44,960
So now they have it to where they can do all of these different simulations to mimic what

1598
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:47,880
would have taken that many trials.

1599
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:53,160
So they're actually using the same data to help radiologists read cancer scans, to help

1600
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:55,000
with all kinds of other things.

1601
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,760
But they are working with funding coming from the Homeland Security Solutions and the

1602
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,480
Army Research Center.

1603
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:06,820
So and he's trying to get work with some of the groups that work with TSA.

1604
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:10,660
So we could get some benefit out of this, but it's the same reaction time that comes

1605
01:16:10,660 --> 01:16:15,040
from gaming, you know, simulations.

1606
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,960
They're basically just focused games.

1607
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,240
I guess that is true.

1608
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:20,240
Yeah.

1609
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,240
All right.

1610
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:24,240
Well, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates, L.O.L.

1611
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:27,120
No, I'm going to stay home and eat these cookies.

1612
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:29,080
I kind of think this is going to be.

1613
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:30,680
But you know, we do the segment every week.

1614
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:31,680
So let's see.

1615
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:32,680
You never know.

1616
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:33,680
There might be some really weird, obscure thing.

1617
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:38,000
Didn't we get like Bioshock 2 like the first week of January one year?

1618
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,280
Like didn't we get Bioshock 2 or one of the Bioshock, yeah, Bioshock 2 I think was like

1619
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:43,680
one of the first weeks in January.

1620
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:44,680
Yeah.

1621
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:47,700
And Final Fantasy 13.2 I think a few years ago was like early January, wasn't it?

1622
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:50,960
So sometimes, sometimes you have something here or there, but I don't know.

1623
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:51,960
Let's see.

1624
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:53,400
Let's check out release dates this week.

1625
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:57,040
Um, sadly, there is not, that's not the case this year.

1626
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:01,960
There's actually nothing coming out until the end of January as of right now.

1627
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:08,200
And the last, the next thing that's coming out actually would be Saints Row, Gat Out

1628
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:12,840
of Hell for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and PC.

1629
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:17,200
Then they're doing the kind of remastered Saints Row 4 with Gat Out of Hell.

1630
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,560
That's not coming out though until the end of the month.

1631
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:24,960
In the meantime, nothing.

1632
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:27,840
Traveling over to Japan, it's really the same story.

1633
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:30,200
There's really nothing to report over in Japan.

1634
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:35,200
No real releases until we get to at least January 15th and things don't really pick

1635
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,000
up until January the 22nd.

1636
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:41,200
So now's the time to start catching up on your gaming or maybe you're preordering big

1637
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:46,880
releases that are coming out in the year in Japan such as Final Fantasy Type 0 HD, which

1638
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:51,160
is March 19th, 2015 coming out in Japan.

1639
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:55,760
But as far as January goes in this first week, nothing being released in Japan.

1640
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,160
Dark Sakura, how about the UK?

1641
01:17:57,160 --> 01:18:00,800
Three whole games, at least that they're telling me of.

1642
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,320
Warhammer Quest for Mac and for PC.

1643
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:05,520
So I guess that's technically one game.

1644
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:09,480
And then Captain Toad Treasure Tracker will be out on the 8th.

1645
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:10,640
The other one's going to be on the 7th.

1646
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:11,640
Oh, that's right.

1647
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:14,120
Europe had to wait till this year, but they got a bumped up release.

1648
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,120
Sorry Europe.

1649
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,120
Yeah.

1650
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:19,080
They had to wait, but at least there's some games that you got well before we did.

1651
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:20,080
Yeah.

1652
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,520
And at least you're getting a game this week.

1653
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:23,560
And we bitched about it until we got it.

1654
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:24,560
That's right.

1655
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:25,560
All right.

1656
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:26,560
That's how it works in America.

1657
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,480
We bitch until we get our way.

1658
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:32,620
Just a couple more stories for you guys then our classic game of the week.

1659
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:33,960
But first, Loki.

1660
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:34,960
Yes.

1661
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:40,120
So I don't know if I'm not too sad about this, but I guess if you're looking for a cheaper

1662
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:45,680
option for Kinect for Windows, you're going to be out of luck pretty soon.

1663
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:54,360
The original Kinect adapter, which came out back in 2013, is going to be phased out.

1664
01:18:54,360 --> 01:19:00,400
They're going to be actually only having the version 2, the one that would be coming with

1665
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,400
the Xbox One.

1666
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:06,160
Also, the one that's more expensive, that is going to be the one that you're going to

1667
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:07,160
be able to buy.

1668
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:11,400
Now, however, I don't know how many people actually use Kinect for Windows, aside from

1669
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:14,240
maybe people developing stuff for Kinect.

1670
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:17,680
But you probably want the new sensor anyways, because the old one wasn't as good.

1671
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:22,600
It's just so much more expensive.

1672
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:23,600
So yeah.

1673
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:24,600
That's that.

1674
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,600
All right.

1675
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:29,840
Well, I don't know how many of you guys are playing the Halo 5 beta.

1676
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,320
That's another one of my gaming resolutions.

1677
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:34,280
By the way, finally get a freaking Xbox One, because I really should have bought one over

1678
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:35,360
this holiday season.

1679
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:38,400
But for personal reasons, I was unable to.

1680
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,500
Nothing against Microsoft or the Xbox One.

1681
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:43,480
Just had to put my money in other places.

1682
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:47,600
But I do want to get an Xbox One over the next year, and one of the games I would likely

1683
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,560
check out on it is Halo 5.

1684
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:54,120
I surprisingly have not been hearing a lot about the beta on Twitter.

1685
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:56,000
Maybe I just follow the wrong crowd.

1686
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,600
I guess I have a lot more Nintendo fans that I know.

1687
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:05,200
But I know the Halo 5 Guardians multiplayer beta is going on right now on Xbox One.

1688
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,240
And they are mixing it up a little bit this week.

1689
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:09,600
It started on December 29th.

1690
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:13,940
This week, they're going to be adding Breakout, which is round-based, and your Spartan has

1691
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:15,840
one life each round.

1692
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,640
The first team to take five rounds wins the match.

1693
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:24,580
And there are two maps that you can play Breakout on called Crossfire and a variant named Trench.

1694
01:20:24,580 --> 01:20:28,600
There are some new maps coming to the Slayer playlist, Regret and Eden.

1695
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,400
Regret is a remix of the Truth map.

1696
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,980
Eden is a remix of the Empire map.

1697
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:35,840
Those were both playable in week one.

1698
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:42,480
And thanks to a user vote, you can now wield the Hydra MLS, which is a brand new weapon

1699
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,480
in the Halo universe.

1700
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:45,480
So there you go.

1701
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:50,040
That is all the updates on what's going on with the Halo 5 Guardians beta, which looks

1702
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:51,040
pretty.

1703
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:54,040
I need to go look up some YouTubes and live streams and try to see this a little more

1704
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:55,040
in action.

1705
01:20:55,040 --> 01:21:00,360
I just, you know, again, I skipped out on Xbox One, unfortunately, this time around,

1706
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:02,480
and just didn't get a chance to check this out.

1707
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,240
So I don't know.

1708
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:06,720
Have you been hearing anything on the Halo 5 beta, Loki?

1709
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:12,200
Nope, because I'm a marginal Halo fan and I don't have an Xbox One.

1710
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:17,000
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, ActDeaf says, Sky, you follow me and I'm the

1711
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,000
right crowd.

1712
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Where are you playing?

1713
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,200
Please chatters, you guys can help when we, you know, we don't have time to play everything

1714
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,620
or money to play everything.

1715
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:28,720
So if you guys have played something we haven't, we're dying to know your opinion is the show

1716
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:30,060
where every gamer has a voice.

1717
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:38,100
So over at live.vognetwork.com, let us know what I might be missing by not checking this

1718
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:39,100
out.

1719
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:41,420
All right, let's get to the classic game of the week.

1720
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:42,420
You know what?

1721
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:43,420
Who needs Halo 5?

1722
01:21:43,420 --> 01:21:44,900
In fact, who needs Halo 1?

1723
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:47,420
When you've got classics to play.

1724
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:53,220
That's right, it's time for Dark Soccer to step into the gaming vault and find a classic

1725
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:57,020
game that she thinks, hey, you should be playing this game this week.

1726
01:21:57,020 --> 01:21:59,860
Forget all this newfangled technology.

1727
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:02,500
This is the time of year where we catch up on games.

1728
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:05,540
It's time for you to catch up on games that are 10 years old.

1729
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:09,780
I had to check five times to see if I've done this game before.

1730
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:12,020
I was shocked that you have never done this game before.

1731
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:14,300
I've been shocking myself lately.

1732
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:15,460
Shocked.

1733
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:17,700
This is really a duh this week, people.

1734
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:18,700
But I'm all right.

1735
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:20,620
We have to start with the music, though, for the first one.

1736
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:24,740
Well, it is a game that people need to frickin' check out if they haven't already.

1737
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:29,700
It's one of the best music games ever and really, a little bit more.

1738
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:36,340
Do you guys hear this Eurobeat?

1739
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:39,140
This very specialized Eurobeat.

1740
01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:41,220
The game is Guitar Man.

1741
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:48,500
Guitar Man is a music game that was done by, I'm going to mispronounce this, but it's Enis,

1742
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:53,100
I-N-I-S, and it was published by Koei for the PS2.

1743
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:54,100
Enis!

1744
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:55,100
Enis!

1745
01:22:55,100 --> 01:23:01,180
Excuse me, I had to burp off the mic.

1746
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:02,860
All the Enis talk made you burp.

1747
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:09,380
Oh, Enis, it makes my gastrointestinal tract just inflamed for the Enis.

1748
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:14,660
Anyway, the game has actually, the artwork is done actually by one of my favorite commercial

1749
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:21,620
artists, Mitsuru Nakamura, and the music was done by a band called Coil, of course, Japanese

1750
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:22,620
band.

1751
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:28,140
It came out on June 21st, 2001 in North America, I'm sorry, in Japan, and in North America

1752
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:33,500
on February 18th, 2002 in Europe it came out June 21st, 2002.

1753
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:38,980
It's had a port that came out on PSP called Guitar Man Lives, and in Japan it was Guitar

1754
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:43,460
Man Live, which I think is a better name, but that came out in 2006.

1755
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:45,740
So what the hell kind of game is this, huh?

1756
01:23:45,740 --> 01:23:50,980
Well you play as a character named Yuwan, which actually his name made so much more

1757
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:56,300
sense in the Japanese version, it was Yuichi, which that actually, it's the same thing,

1758
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:58,100
it just sounds like it makes more sense.

1759
01:23:58,100 --> 01:24:06,060
Anyway, he's kind of bullied on, and the girl he likes doesn't like him, so basically his

1760
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:08,060
dog teaches him how to play guitar.

1761
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:10,820
His dog's name is Puma.

1762
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:13,900
And he eventually becomes the Guitar Man.

1763
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:20,780
He inherits the last Gitaroo, and so he has to fight these huge creatures that also control

1764
01:24:20,780 --> 01:24:22,900
Gitaroos.

1765
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:29,300
You have different kind of bars that move around for a center location, and so you move

1766
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:34,140
the analog controller in conjunction with these bars you have to go, and you tap certain

1767
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:35,860
buttons at certain times.

1768
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:41,700
You've got five different phases, and you've got a life bar.

1769
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:45,620
So the better you do, the more you take off of the other person.

1770
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:48,580
The worse that you do, the more life you lose.

1771
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:55,900
So you've technically got, the three main phases are charge, attack, and guard, where

1772
01:24:55,900 --> 01:25:01,300
you have to follow a trace line with the analog stick, and then you have red phase bars so

1773
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:05,860
that you can press buttons at the end of the phases, so that you time it when it hits the

1774
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:06,860
screen.

1775
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:07,860
Basically it's all rhythm.

1776
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:13,100
In charge you get notes that restore your health, and in attack that's when you actually

1777
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:15,340
start attacking the other guys.

1778
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:22,540
You also have the harmony and the end phase, and really, it's hard to really describe the

1779
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:24,140
game as something that you'll just have to see.

1780
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:25,580
Can I play the other song though?

1781
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:26,580
Yes please.

1782
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:28,300
Oh, I put up the Sandbone Trio I think.

1783
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:30,300
Yes, that is the other song that we're going to hear.

1784
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:31,780
The Sandbone Trio is like my second favorite song.

1785
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:32,780
The Born To Be Bone song.

1786
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:33,780
Turn it up a touch.

1787
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:34,780
Such a good song.

1788
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:43,500
The soundtrack for this game is a maze, anyway.

1789
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:46,220
And by the way, AkumaJP in chat says it's pronounced Ani-Sue.

1790
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:47,220
Ani-Sue?

1791
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:48,220
Mm-hmm.

1792
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:49,220
Okay.

1793
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:50,220
Thank you.

1794
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:51,220
I still like anus!

1795
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:52,220
You would.

1796
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:55,260
Shut up, what do you try to say?

1797
01:25:55,260 --> 01:25:56,260
Anyway...

1798
01:25:56,260 --> 01:25:57,260
Is that a gay joke?

1799
01:25:57,260 --> 01:25:59,180
No, maybe you just have...

1800
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:01,180
You could be a proctologist, Rob.

1801
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:03,460
One day, Rob, you could be a proctologist.

1802
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:04,460
Classic game.

1803
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:05,460
Talk about it.

1804
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:09,140
And there's also Master's Mode once you've beaten the game once, where it's a lot harder,

1805
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:13,180
you have a lot more complex notes, the trace line becomes more difficult, and you take

1806
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:16,820
more damage from mistakes, then you get Versus Mode that you can play up to four player,

1807
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:22,260
where you play each other in two teams doing the guitaros parts and the opponents parts.

1808
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:30,020
The PSP version has Duet Mode, where you can play cooperatively via the ad hoc in two new

1809
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:34,500
levels where you get Metal Header and Tota Passion.

1810
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:39,700
So the characters in the game, like I said, you have Yuwan or Yuichi, who is the guitar

1811
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:40,700
man.

1812
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:48,180
You have Puma, who turns into something called Puma AC30, and he's like a big kind of weird

1813
01:26:48,180 --> 01:26:49,660
patchwork robot dog.

1814
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:58,380
You have Pico, who's the girl that Yuwan wants, and Kazuo, who's the guy who likes to take

1815
01:26:58,380 --> 01:26:59,380
Pico away.

1816
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:08,220
Then you've got all the bad guys, so the main bad guy is Zoe, who is trying to take over

1817
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:11,420
the universe through capturing all the guitaros.

1818
01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:16,100
You've got your bad guys, like the one that the music we played last was The Flying O,

1819
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:20,860
which is a giant UFO that makes everyone para-para into death.

1820
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:26,500
This one is the sand bone trio, so there are three skeletons named Carrot, Pine, and Soda

1821
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:31,620
that play their own ribs for the musical instruments, you know, all kinds of different ones.

1822
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:32,700
That ain't weird or anything.

1823
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:35,700
And you have your backup band, who show up randomly in different levels.

1824
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:40,700
So you get Norin, who wears a rabbit suit, Yung, who wears a monkey suit, and Yasuda

1825
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:44,420
Sun, who wears a panda suit.

1826
01:27:44,420 --> 01:27:50,380
The soundtrack, the CD came out in 2001, has the majority of the songs in it, and it's

1827
01:27:50,380 --> 01:27:52,900
missing most of the background music, though.

1828
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:59,060
But it does have some of the Master Mode versions, it has also the remixes of some of the songs.

1829
01:27:59,060 --> 01:28:04,300
As far as other versions, there was one called Guitar Man 1, that was a trial release of

1830
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:11,020
the game, but it also had a demo of the para-para stage, and cinematic scenes that were only

1831
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:15,260
exclusive to that version, and a game where you could play Puma trying to eat donuts falling

1832
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:17,780
from the sky.

1833
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:21,500
Then of course there was Guitar Man Live, or in Japan it was Guitar Man Live, that was

1834
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:22,500
the PSP version.

1835
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:28,900
It had extra goodies, and that came out in Japan on June 8th, 2006, Europe September

1836
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:32,980
26th, 2006, and in North America November 14th, 2006.

1837
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:34,980
So that's the one we actually got after Europe.

1838
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:39,100
See Europe, you get some before us, but we bitch until we get it.

1839
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:40,100
And that's it.

1840
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:45,180
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, a true classic for music game fans,

1841
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:47,060
which we all are here at OLR.

1842
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:48,060
I suck at it.

1843
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:51,420
Guitar Man, there you go.

1844
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:56,580
Then you would probably not like Hatsune Miku, which to me plays very similar.

1845
01:28:56,580 --> 01:28:59,620
Like obviously they have their differences, but I do feel like it's probably the most

1846
01:28:59,620 --> 01:29:02,540
similar thing to Guitar Man that's out there, is Hatsune Miku.

1847
01:29:02,540 --> 01:29:04,020
I don't know if you'd care for that.

1848
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:07,500
I love Hatsune Miku though, that game's a lot of fun, I need to get the new one that

1849
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:08,900
just came out.

1850
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:10,820
But anyway, we're gonna take a break.

1851
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:16,340
We got more OLR coming up, including our 2015 predictions, that's right, listless returns

1852
01:29:16,340 --> 01:29:20,280
tonight, and you guys will help us come up with a definitive list in our chatroom over

1853
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:28,000
at live.vognetwork.com, but we will do all that and some more news, scraping what little

1854
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,840
pieces of news there are together, and your calls, most importantly, in the mailbag, when

1855
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:42,640
we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.

1856
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:47,160
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening, January the 4th

1857
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:54,640
of 2015, with episode number 582 of our show, In Progress, and we've been talking a little

1858
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:57,360
bit about what little gaming news there is this week.

1859
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:02,880
We talked about the Sony PlayStation hack apology thing earlier, and the piracy being

1860
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:06,980
combated in Talos Principle, we talked a little bit about that earlier, talked a little bit

1861
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:10,000
about an update on the VoG jam, they were talking about that in the chatroom during

1862
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,240
the break, and Loki actually working on his game during the show, and you said you fixed

1863
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:15,240
the bug.

1864
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:18,760
Yeah I fixed it, I had to copy paste everything from the project that I was working on into

1865
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:20,080
a new project, then it fixed it.

1866
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:21,360
That's so weird that that would do it.

1867
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:22,360
And what was the problem you were having?

1868
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:23,360
You were having some textures?

1869
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:29,800
It seems in between, my maps are a bunch of 3D objects right now, and I may just fuse

1870
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:34,640
them all together later, but right now it's a bunch of 3D objects, and so in between the

1871
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:39,840
seams were showing, and it wasn't doing that before as my screenshot, and they're still

1872
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:48,120
kind of showing, but it's way less noticeable now, it's very, I can deal with that much

1873
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:55,320
showing, that's fine, but before it was just like really horrible from far away.

1874
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:58,160
Good on you though, troubleshooting while we're trying to do a show, that's great, love

1875
01:30:58,160 --> 01:30:59,160
it.

1876
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:00,160
Thanks for the break.

1877
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:05,880
We also derailed into movie chat, which by the way, we derailed into talking about Winona

1878
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:15,120
Ryder and how underrated she is, I know right, but this reminded me of a Twitter thing that

1879
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:19,560
had come up earlier, and I was talking on Twitter, and it was Tiger Claw or somebody

1880
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:24,760
had brought it up talking about, it is the year 2015, and a lot of people are talking

1881
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:29,760
about, oh it's the year of Back to the Future 2, and you talk about Slow News Week, you

1882
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:33,840
have a lot of these websites like Buzzfeed and so forth are having to live on the, here's

1883
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:38,560
20 things that Back to the Future 2 got wrong about the year 2015 and all this stuff.

1884
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:40,680
It just started, there's still time.

1885
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:44,880
There's still time for hoverboards and auto-tying shoelaces right, but here's the funny thing

1886
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:47,180
about that, I was like, oh I have a really funny story about that, you know what that

1887
01:31:47,180 --> 01:31:48,180
story is?

1888
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:51,920
I've never seen Back to the Future Part 2, yep, that's my funny story, I've never seen

1889
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:52,920
Back to the Future Part 2.

1890
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:54,720
You're not missing anything, it was really awful.

1891
01:31:54,720 --> 01:32:00,300
Now here's the weird thing, here's what makes that story weird, I've seen Part 1, and I've

1892
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:04,240
seen Part 3, I've never seen Part 2.

1893
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:08,600
I was like that well into adulthood, I didn't see the second one until I moved out here.

1894
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:09,600
Oh interesting.

1895
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,600
Yep.

1896
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:11,880
Yeah no, I never got around to seeing the second one.

1897
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:16,740
I remember we saw the third one, like one of those like rainy day or substitute teacher

1898
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:17,740
type of things.

1899
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:21,560
Like you remember when they would just show you a movie in class, even though you're supposed

1900
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:24,600
to be learning, they show you a movie because clearly something's going on behind the scenes

1901
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:25,600
you're not supposed to know about.

1902
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:26,600
Oh no.

1903
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:27,600
So it's like, just shut them up, we're just gonna show a movie.

1904
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:31,040
We wouldn't get a movie, we would get The Reel to Reel by Seba Gygi.

1905
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:32,840
What is that?

1906
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:38,120
It was, it's a research facility, they used to put out educational films, and so we had

1907
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:42,600
the, they'd bring out the projector and make us watch science stuff.

1908
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:46,960
That, okay, we had something like that in our physics class.

1909
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:50,920
We had that all the way through elementary school and then in middle school.

1910
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:54,880
My physics teacher in high school was a crazy bastard, but I mean that in the best possible

1911
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:55,880
way.

1912
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:56,880
He was, he was so awesome.

1913
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:59,560
He wore a Star Trek uniform to work every single day.

1914
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:00,760
That's what kind of a badass he was.

1915
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:01,760
Okay that's cool.

1916
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:05,560
And during recess he always played music that he would blast on these loudspeakers, it was

1917
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:12,440
like this big orchestral type epic thing, and it was always timed precisely to end right

1918
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:13,760
when the bell would ring.

1919
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:19,560
Like the music would go, doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo, and then the bell, brrrr.

1920
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:22,200
Like he, like you, he made a science out of this.

1921
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:25,560
And the greatest thing about him, like this guy, you know, I'm a, I'm a teacher of sorts

1922
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:28,800
now and I gotta say this guy is an inspiration in certain ways.

1923
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:32,640
I mean even though I just called him a crazy bastard, again I say that with the utmost

1924
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:36,920
respect of this that I take after that a little bit.

1925
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:43,440
But um, oh my god, this guy, he used to deliver jokes in the most deadpan way ever.

1926
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:45,680
Like he was a teacher on Strangers with Candy.

1927
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:48,460
He was like Mr. Noblitt or something like that, I swear to god.

1928
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:49,460
So that guy was amazing.

1929
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:55,240
Going to the chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, Tigerclaw saying, Sky, you must see Back to

1930
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:56,560
the Future Part II.

1931
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,780
PushyPixels saying, Rob, seriously?

1932
01:33:58,780 --> 01:33:59,780
You need to see it.

1933
01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:02,480
Fifth Dream saying, I saw it in the theater.

1934
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:07,520
Alright, look, I'll try, you know, why don't we do a Dark Soccer and Rob Let's React to

1935
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:11,000
Back to the Future Part II YouTube.

1936
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
I'll tell you what.

1937
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,840
But hey, Michael J. Fox in drag.

1938
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:15,800
I've got the whole trilogy on Blu-ray.

1939
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:17,280
I'll bring it next week, yes.

1940
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:18,280
Nice.

1941
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:19,280
Alright.

1942
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:20,280
I've got it too.

1943
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:21,280
I mean, you know who I married.

1944
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:22,280
Hey, I don't have it.

1945
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:24,280
So some of you need to just bring it over.

1946
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:27,600
That reminds me, I just need to watch Tron again.

1947
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:32,060
But I have all the Star Trek Next Generation movies on Blu-ray thanks to my high school

1948
01:34:32,060 --> 01:34:33,060
physics teacher.

1949
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:34,060
Alright.

1950
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:35,060
Not really.

1951
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:37,060
But I did watch a lot of Next Generation in high school.

1952
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:42,060
Anyway, we had a lot, we had to watch a lot of rapid fire news go by before we get to

1953
01:34:42,060 --> 01:34:45,020
our 2015 predictions list list tonight.

1954
01:34:45,020 --> 01:34:46,780
Let's get into some rapid fire news.

1955
01:34:46,780 --> 01:34:48,380
Loki, the Dark Sakura.

1956
01:34:48,380 --> 01:34:52,140
I would like to derail this real quick since you just mentioned Star Trek The Next Generation.

1957
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:53,140
Oh sure.

1958
01:34:53,140 --> 01:34:58,660
I just thought I would pitch a game idea real quick because I think it's hilarious.

1959
01:34:58,660 --> 01:35:01,340
And since I'm not going to be able to work on something like that.

1960
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:05,900
But you know, I know they've had like, you know, red shirts type of game where, you know,

1961
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:09,220
you're basically playing kind of as the crew members that are expendable.

1962
01:35:09,220 --> 01:35:15,180
But imagine if you will, kind of combining the Star Trek Next Generation with say, it

1963
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:16,180
wasn't Six Feet Under.

1964
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:20,020
What was that one where she was the Grim Reaper?

1965
01:35:20,020 --> 01:35:21,020
Yep.

1966
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:22,060
Whatever that one is.

1967
01:35:22,060 --> 01:35:26,780
But basically where the object of the game is you have to kill those people on their

1968
01:35:26,780 --> 01:35:30,140
away missions using like the environment or something like that.

1969
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:34,900
Like you are, you know, the Grim Reaper that has to kill the red shirts on their way.

1970
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:38,540
I think it would be an interesting game where you play, well, maybe, and maybe you're saying

1971
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:41,980
this is what's already been done, where you play as the red shirt, but you're having to

1972
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:46,340
deal with like, you don't want to go into these situations, but you have to, and you

1973
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:50,500
have a completely incompetent boss who keeps sending you into these death missions and

1974
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:51,820
death traps.

1975
01:35:51,820 --> 01:35:55,140
And maybe at the end of the game, you find like out like some like weird twists.

1976
01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:57,940
Like the boss has been out to like purposely kill you the whole time.

1977
01:35:57,940 --> 01:35:59,900
Cause there's something, I don't know, involving your family.

1978
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:05,900
Like a game called, I wear a red shirt, Zach Brannigan, anyway, I like those ideas.

1979
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:06,900
Those are good ideas.

1980
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:07,900
Those are good.

1981
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:08,900
All right.

1982
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:09,900
How about some rapid fire news though?

1983
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:11,140
Back to games that actually exist.

1984
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:12,140
Okay.

1985
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:18,380
So there's a rumor that apparently the data for a duck hunt amiibo is on the Smash Brothers

1986
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:19,380
disc.

1987
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:24,020
And I guess there is some video that came out kind of showing, um, that they hacked,

1988
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:27,660
I don't know if they hacked, you know, the near field communication or did something

1989
01:36:27,660 --> 01:36:34,580
to where it tricked it, allegedly to believe that there was a amiibo that, you know, doesn't

1990
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:35,980
exist yet.

1991
01:36:35,980 --> 01:36:42,360
And apparently a menu came up, um, showing like the duck hunt figures.

1992
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:47,620
I don't know if that's true or not, but, um, I could see them putting out an amiibo and

1993
01:36:47,620 --> 01:36:51,980
I could definitely see that the game would support, um, characters that aren't out yet.

1994
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:55,940
I mean, I know they did the same thing with like, was it Disney infinity and stuff supporting

1995
01:36:55,940 --> 01:36:57,420
characters that weren't out yet.

1996
01:36:57,420 --> 01:36:58,940
Um, but they were planned.

1997
01:36:58,940 --> 01:37:04,660
So I can see that I'm pretty sure Nintendo has an amiibo plan for every single character

1998
01:37:04,660 --> 01:37:05,740
in Smash Brothers.

1999
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:08,340
I'm pretty sure that's the thing that's going to happen.

2000
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:12,700
So but, um, except maybe Pac-Man because of the licensing issues.

2001
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:15,980
But then again, if they got mega man and Sonic, I don't see why they won't have a Pac-Man

2002
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:16,980
amiibo.

2003
01:37:16,980 --> 01:37:17,980
I'm sure they would.

2004
01:37:17,980 --> 01:37:18,980
Yeah, they could.

2005
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:22,260
Um, so I don't know, I guess we'll have to wait and see.

2006
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:25,360
I'm sure that, you know, that'll be another one of those intended directs where they announced

2007
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:26,360
more amiibo figures.

2008
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:27,600
Hooray!

2009
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:28,600
Hooray!

2010
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:30,080
Um, this is kind of cool.

2011
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:35,720
There's going to be some idea factory RPGs now coming to PC.

2012
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:41,580
And with this, they're going to have Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth 1 and Hyperdimension Neptunia

2013
01:37:41,580 --> 01:37:47,760
Rebirth 2, which were both originally out at least over here on the Vita.

2014
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:52,820
And then, um, Fairy Fencer F, which was a PlayStation 3 title that's coming out over

2015
01:37:52,820 --> 01:37:55,320
here as well on Steam.

2016
01:37:55,320 --> 01:38:01,360
So, um, no exact date when those are going to be available, but they should be coming

2017
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:02,360
soon.

2018
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:05,260
So, um, I'll have to wait and see for those.

2019
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:10,320
And then last but not least, there is a code that's been released for Pokemon Omega Ruby

2020
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:16,200
and Alpha Sapphire, uh, for, uh, Super- was it Superior?

2021
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:24,200
Um, it's, I guess, an unlocked code that was on the last Pokemon Get TV.

2022
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:30,960
And the code, I guess, is redeemable after January 29th and available for use up through

2023
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:34,160
November 30th, 2015.

2024
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:39,920
And I guess the code is just Pokemon 497 and it'll unlock, I guess, a character?

2025
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:41,320
I don't know.

2026
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:45,720
I think Superior or whatever, Superior is the Pokemon.

2027
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:46,720
I think is the deal.

2028
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:48,000
So they're saying-

2029
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,000
I don't know.

2030
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:53,180
When even Shane is on this show saying it was, uh, really not a good Pokemon game, that

2031
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:57,060
really makes me go, well, I have concerns, but then again, we had a caller call in and

2032
01:38:57,060 --> 01:38:58,060
say, no, he's wrong.

2033
01:38:58,060 --> 01:38:59,180
It's the best game of the year.

2034
01:38:59,180 --> 01:39:03,140
So I suppose there's, uh, two sides to all that.

2035
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:04,140
So I don't know.

2036
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:05,140
Cool.

2037
01:39:05,140 --> 01:39:06,140
I guess.

2038
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:07,140
I'm not a Pokemon fan.

2039
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:09,180
So yeah, that means little to me.

2040
01:39:09,180 --> 01:39:10,180
All right.

2041
01:39:10,180 --> 01:39:11,180
Uh, DarkStalker.

2042
01:39:11,180 --> 01:39:12,180
How about you?

2043
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:14,180
I'm busy cooking.

2044
01:39:14,180 --> 01:39:16,100
Those cookies you brought are so good.

2045
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:17,100
Curse you.

2046
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:18,500
No, bless me.

2047
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:19,500
Delicious cookies.

2048
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:25,220
Um, so there is a, um, an extension to my Nintendo.

2049
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:30,380
Now this isn't an extension for the Digital Deluxe promotion, but you can redeem your

2050
01:39:30,380 --> 01:39:34,220
vouchers for it through April.

2051
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:36,820
Basically the program's being extended through April 1st.

2052
01:39:36,820 --> 01:39:42,620
Um, but the actual ability to purchase it ended at the end of the year.

2053
01:39:42,620 --> 01:39:44,820
So that's a correction on that one.

2054
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:47,700
In other news, Mighty Eat Number 9 is almost finished.

2055
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:52,260
And we had a message that came out from, uh, Inohune that said, happy new year, we're

2056
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:54,320
almost done.

2057
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:57,420
So get ready.

2058
01:39:57,420 --> 01:40:02,380
And last but not least, um, there's another character in Tekken 7 who is not as controversial

2059
01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:04,060
as Lucky Chloe.

2060
01:40:04,060 --> 01:40:08,580
Um, his name is, uh, Shaheen.

2061
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:16,460
He is a Saudi Arabian soldier and, um, he actually was created based on feedback, um,

2062
01:40:16,460 --> 01:40:22,300
from, uh, the game designer asking, what do you most want to see in the next Tekken game?

2063
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:25,860
And a lot of people said they wanted a Middle Eastern character.

2064
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:30,580
And I have to say, you know, he's got some of the stereotypical stuff on him, but he's,

2065
01:40:30,580 --> 01:40:34,300
uh, actually pretty handsome, has a sword, looking pretty hardcore.

2066
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:38,380
I would, you know, honestly, it's not a fighting game unless you have a bunch of people that

2067
01:40:38,380 --> 01:40:40,780
fill the tropes of different characters.

2068
01:40:40,780 --> 01:40:42,380
I mean, who cares?

2069
01:40:42,380 --> 01:40:43,380
It's a fighting game.

2070
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:44,380
Who stereotypes the game?

2071
01:40:44,700 --> 01:40:49,340
You know, you're not, we can't talk realism about, you know, a game that has a fighting

2072
01:40:49,340 --> 01:40:55,020
bear in it or a game that has, you know, a wooden robot thing that you fight.

2073
01:40:55,020 --> 01:40:56,020
I mean, it's just, come on.

2074
01:40:56,020 --> 01:41:02,860
If Street Fighter can have a Turkish oil wrestler, then I think having a rather subdued and well-dressed

2075
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:06,900
stylish Saudi man is perfectly fine for Tekken 7.

2076
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:07,900
Absolutely.

2077
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:12,900
I think if you can have a Turkish oil wrestler, then you can have Lucky Chloe.

2078
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:13,900
Why not?

2079
01:41:14,620 --> 01:41:16,180
I didn't have a problem with Lucky Chloe.

2080
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:20,540
I don't, I don't know why people, people, people just want to get mad to get mad.

2081
01:41:20,540 --> 01:41:22,660
Like sometimes I think that's the purpose of Twitter.

2082
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:23,660
And don't get me wrong.

2083
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:25,540
Like I've had a lot of very positive interactions on Twitter.

2084
01:41:25,540 --> 01:41:29,420
I met a lot of great people on Twitter, but sometimes I think like people just have Twitters.

2085
01:41:29,420 --> 01:41:31,020
They can complain about something.

2086
01:41:31,020 --> 01:41:34,300
And it's like, if there was nothing else going on in the world, it's just, I need to complain

2087
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:36,180
about something on fricking Twitter.

2088
01:41:36,180 --> 01:41:37,180
And it's so easy.

2089
01:41:37,180 --> 01:41:38,180
I'm on the internet.

2090
01:41:38,180 --> 01:41:39,180
Yeah.

2091
01:41:39,180 --> 01:41:40,180
I have to say something about this.

2092
01:41:40,180 --> 01:41:41,180
I'm on the internet.

2093
01:41:41,180 --> 01:41:42,180
Fuck you all.

2094
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:43,180
Oh my God.

2095
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:44,180
Listen to me be wrong.

2096
01:41:44,180 --> 01:41:45,180
I don't care.

2097
01:41:45,180 --> 01:41:46,180
Just listen.

2098
01:41:46,180 --> 01:41:48,340
And it's so easy to tag people.

2099
01:41:48,340 --> 01:41:52,940
Like it is so easy to tag like, you know, at Lady Gaga, you're fat.

2100
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:53,940
I hate you.

2101
01:41:53,940 --> 01:41:55,940
And it's like, but she can like actually, I don't know.

2102
01:41:55,940 --> 01:41:58,860
Why do you think I hardly spend any time on Twitter anymore?

2103
01:41:58,860 --> 01:42:02,420
I'd rather be on Tumblr and just repost whole blogs and make fun of them.

2104
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:04,100
So you have my whole issue with Tumblr too.

2105
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:08,540
Lately Tumblr has just been Dragon Age romance, the blog.

2106
01:42:08,540 --> 01:42:09,540
Yeah.

2107
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:10,940
All right.

2108
01:42:10,940 --> 01:42:13,580
Let's get to the foogle question of the week.

2109
01:42:13,580 --> 01:42:24,940
You take Facebook, you take Google Plus, you slam them together, you get foogle.

2110
01:42:24,940 --> 01:42:30,140
Every week we ask our listeners that support us on social networks a question every week,

2111
01:42:30,140 --> 01:42:34,860
which by the way, you may start to see us using social networking more outside of just

2112
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:35,860
Sunday.

2113
01:42:35,860 --> 01:42:39,180
Um, you may have noticed a little experiment where I actually snuck a question in earlier

2114
01:42:39,180 --> 01:42:41,220
in the week that I used in the intro of the show.

2115
01:42:41,220 --> 01:42:45,300
Um, that might be a direction we start kind of going in more and more throughout the year.

2116
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:46,940
It's just something I'm experimenting with a little bit.

2117
01:42:46,940 --> 01:42:49,260
So, uh, don't just follow us on Sunday.

2118
01:42:49,260 --> 01:42:52,340
Keep an eye out because you might see more questions throughout the week as there's more

2119
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:53,340
gaming news.

2120
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:55,900
Like I would like to do something every day, but there's really just not been the news

2121
01:42:55,900 --> 01:42:56,900
to necessitate it.

2122
01:42:56,900 --> 01:43:00,620
But we'll be asking you guys about the big stories more frequently so we can get your

2123
01:43:00,620 --> 01:43:04,660
comments on the show more frequently than just the section.

2124
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:08,540
But all that aside, we did ask in our official foogle question of the week this week, tonight

2125
01:43:08,540 --> 01:43:11,140
we are making our 2015 predictions.

2126
01:43:11,140 --> 01:43:14,140
So what are your 2015 gaming predictions?

2127
01:43:14,140 --> 01:43:15,700
Maybe we'll use some of these on this list.

2128
01:43:15,700 --> 01:43:16,700
Let's see.

2129
01:43:16,700 --> 01:43:20,300
I read the Hayes says 2015 will be a great year with all the upcoming games.

2130
01:43:20,300 --> 01:43:24,820
I predict more remakes and revivals, which is great because I missed out on stuff last

2131
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:25,820
gen.

2132
01:43:25,820 --> 01:43:30,460
I also want old franchises with great ideas to come back, such as the spiritual revival

2133
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:31,940
of clock tower.

2134
01:43:31,940 --> 01:43:35,780
Well, the good news for you is that, uh, that's a pretty safe bet.

2135
01:43:35,780 --> 01:43:40,140
There's definitely going to be some more, uh, uh, remakes and revivals.

2136
01:43:40,140 --> 01:43:42,540
I just hope final fantasy 12 is one of them.

2137
01:43:42,540 --> 01:43:43,540
All right.

2138
01:43:43,540 --> 01:43:47,300
Uh, rageinator says, this is a bit of a cop out answer, but I predict that I'll buy a

2139
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:49,460
shit ton of steam games.

2140
01:43:49,460 --> 01:43:52,620
Also one of the safest predictions I've ever heard, but that's all right.

2141
01:43:52,620 --> 01:43:57,800
I also like how often people use the word shit ton.

2142
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:01,060
As in a shit ton of smiling piles of poopy mote icons.

2143
01:44:01,060 --> 01:44:03,820
Uh, Andy R says half life three will release.

2144
01:44:03,820 --> 01:44:04,820
Haha.

2145
01:44:04,860 --> 01:44:10,140
By the way, uh, Guillermo R says valve will quietly cancel steam machines.

2146
01:44:10,140 --> 01:44:11,140
Ooh.

2147
01:44:11,140 --> 01:44:15,660
Nintendo will announce a 2d Metroid co-developed by chair entertainment, as well as a Wemo

2148
01:44:15,660 --> 01:44:18,220
enabled port of the infinity blade trilogy.

2149
01:44:18,220 --> 01:44:22,780
Oh God, I think that's a real wild stab of the dark, but I hope you're fucking right.

2150
01:44:22,780 --> 01:44:23,780
I really do.

2151
01:44:23,780 --> 01:44:24,780
That would be amazing.

2152
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:27,460
Uh, Sony will stay quiet about the last guardian.

2153
01:44:27,460 --> 01:44:28,460
That's a little more safe.

2154
01:44:28,460 --> 01:44:34,700
Oculus rift will finally come out and no man's sky will be awesome in it.

2155
01:44:34,700 --> 01:44:38,140
And fifth dream on Facebook says virtual reality will finally begin making its way into the

2156
01:44:38,140 --> 01:44:41,380
mainstream near the end of the year and beginning of the next soon.

2157
01:44:41,380 --> 01:44:46,740
It won't be a joke or thought of as a fad anymore and just become the way a lot of people

2158
01:44:46,740 --> 01:44:47,740
game.

2159
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:51,540
As a by-product, there will be a reboot of the lawnmower movies, lawnmower man movie

2160
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:53,180
series in 2017.

2161
01:44:53,180 --> 01:44:54,180
Okay.

2162
01:44:54,180 --> 01:44:55,180
Maybe not.

2163
01:44:55,180 --> 01:44:56,180
I hope so.

2164
01:44:56,180 --> 01:44:57,340
No, I'm both of those.

2165
01:44:57,340 --> 01:44:58,340
Yeah.

2166
01:44:59,220 --> 01:45:03,660
I'm totally fine with the first part of the lawnmower man sequel was God damn terrible

2167
01:45:03,660 --> 01:45:04,660
though.

2168
01:45:04,660 --> 01:45:05,660
I mean, don't get me wrong.

2169
01:45:05,660 --> 01:45:11,300
The lawnmower man, you know, his adventures through the mind's eye videos, um, was fantastic,

2170
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:16,860
but yeah, I could totally see a reboot of that make crazy and creepy.

2171
01:45:16,860 --> 01:45:22,260
Uh, I'm, I am so curious to see what happens when things like Oculus rift and uh, you know,

2172
01:45:22,260 --> 01:45:25,780
project Morpheus, whatever it ends up actually being called, you know, all these things come

2173
01:45:25,780 --> 01:45:26,780
out.

2174
01:45:26,780 --> 01:45:27,780
I'm, I'm very curious to see what happens.

2175
01:45:28,220 --> 01:45:29,220
All right.

2176
01:45:29,220 --> 01:45:34,020
Uh, act deft, uh, over on Google plus says, Loki's game gets finished.

2177
01:45:34,020 --> 01:45:35,020
Seriously speaking though.

2178
01:45:35,020 --> 01:45:38,340
I expect a major gaming company to go under this year.

2179
01:45:38,340 --> 01:45:40,500
Sad, but maybe true.

2180
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:45,780
I'm sure there's at least two, like I, I imagine the sun will come out tomorrow.

2181
01:45:45,780 --> 01:45:50,140
I think there's two big Japanese ones we're all looking at, but maybe we'll get into that

2182
01:45:50,140 --> 01:45:52,500
in our official predictions here in a minute.

2183
01:45:52,540 --> 01:45:58,140
Uh, redertainment says, and the answer is the Witcher three gets delayed again, pushing

2184
01:45:58,140 --> 01:45:59,540
back the release to holiday.

2185
01:45:59,540 --> 01:46:04,020
Ooh, that would be, uh, that would be pretty, uh, interesting if that happened, uh, price

2186
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:10,020
cut on the Wii U in time for holiday, no price cut on PS4 or Xbox one.

2187
01:46:10,020 --> 01:46:17,620
I, I, did they really make good on the threat to up the price of Xbox one $50 again?

2188
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:21,620
Like did the price of Xbox one go back up by 50 bucks?

2189
01:46:21,620 --> 01:46:25,140
I think that was, I don't, I don't think that was a smart decision on Microsoft's part,

2190
01:46:25,140 --> 01:46:27,380
but anyway, maybe it, maybe it'll just be, I think it did.

2191
01:46:27,380 --> 01:46:29,980
I can confirm.

2192
01:46:29,980 --> 01:46:34,740
I think if, if they did make that $50 price drop permanent, which I can't believe they

2193
01:46:34,740 --> 01:46:38,460
didn't, then Sony would be under a lot of pressure to match it.

2194
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:39,740
Um, but we'll see.

2195
01:46:39,740 --> 01:46:40,740
I don't know.

2196
01:46:40,740 --> 01:46:41,740
We'll see.

2197
01:46:41,740 --> 01:46:43,220
Uh, it's, it's a, it's a fair prediction.

2198
01:46:43,220 --> 01:46:46,940
And then, uh, redertainment says the last guardian is teased at E3, no release date

2199
01:46:46,940 --> 01:46:50,980
or full trailer, just a short video with ominous music behind it.

2200
01:46:51,020 --> 01:46:55,020
Mirrors Edge 2 gets a release date sometime in 2016.

2201
01:46:55,020 --> 01:46:57,020
All right.

2202
01:46:57,020 --> 01:47:00,340
Um, let's see, uh, there you go.

2203
01:47:00,340 --> 01:47:04,140
Those are some of the answers from our Facebook and Google plus communities.

2204
01:47:04,140 --> 01:47:08,780
We are really close to our list lists for tonight, but first we have a couple more stories

2205
01:47:08,780 --> 01:47:09,780
for you guys.

2206
01:47:09,780 --> 01:47:10,780
Loki.

2207
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:11,780
Yeah.

2208
01:47:11,780 --> 01:47:17,960
It's still saying that $399.99 are, um, so I don't remember which bundle that was, but

2209
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:20,720
it doesn't look like that they've dropped it down.

2210
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:21,720
Eh, whatever.

2211
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:22,720
Okay.

2212
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:24,720
Uh, so let's see.

2213
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:30,240
So let's talk a little bit about, um, well, the Xbox one actually, ironically enough,

2214
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:34,220
that, um, and this is something that they've been working on for a while, especially after

2215
01:47:34,220 --> 01:47:39,480
they decided, hey, you know what, we're not going to make the Kinect as, um, something

2216
01:47:39,480 --> 01:47:41,440
that you need to have in the system.

2217
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:48,720
And because of that, um, they were freeing up the extra, um, CPU power that was, I guess,

2218
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:49,720
for that.

2219
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:55,840
So I can't remember how much they were saying, um, they're saying right now they've allowed

2220
01:47:55,840 --> 01:48:01,520
developers access to 50 to 80% of the seventh processing core.

2221
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:08,600
And I'm seeing that this should increase the performance of, uh, titles compared to their

2222
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:09,640
PlayStation four counterparts.

2223
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:13,960
Because you may remember there's been quite a disparaging, uh, difference between some

2224
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:18,460
of these, you know, titles on Xbox one, not running as high of a resolution as the ones

2225
01:48:18,460 --> 01:48:22,520
on PlayStation four or lower frame rate or something to that effect.

2226
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:26,960
I mean, if that's a big deal for you, then I don't know.

2227
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:29,240
I guess this is cool that they're going to have the extra stuff.

2228
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:34,720
And then also, um, I know at some point they're supposed to be adopting, was it a DirectX

2229
01:48:34,720 --> 01:48:41,680
12, was that, I think, I don't know, that's supposed to be pushing, uh, visuals up as

2230
01:48:41,680 --> 01:48:42,680
well.

2231
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:47,520
And, um, so let's allow them to do a little bit more with the system and also on PC.

2232
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:48,520
All right.

2233
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:52,380
Well, uh, you know, we were talking a minute ago about the Wii U and the types of things

2234
01:48:52,380 --> 01:48:57,180
we might see this year, but, uh, it looks like Mario, a 3d Mario title will not be among

2235
01:48:57,180 --> 01:48:59,240
the offerings on the Wii U this year.

2236
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:04,480
Uh, this was confirmed by Nintendo of America's Bill Trennan, who said in an interview and

2237
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:07,640
the interview was, whoa, the interview, sorry, my keyboard tray just broke.

2238
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:08,640
That was scary.

2239
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:12,680
Uh, uh, he said in this interview that the, uh, company does not have a sequel to super

2240
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:15,000
Mario 3d world plan for release this year.

2241
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:19,880
So that's not going to be on the 3ds or the Wii U, uh, but of course there is Mario maker

2242
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:25,560
coming on the Wii, uh, Wii U, excuse me, and Mario party 10, uh, the exact quote, Mario

2243
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:28,440
games release more frequently, but we don't have a new Mario game this year.

2244
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:29,920
So it's not an annual event.

2245
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:33,680
The teams focus on how they can recreate the gameplay experience or introduce new ideas

2246
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:37,240
to those games, which is what they did with NES remix, for example.

2247
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:38,240
So there you go.

2248
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:41,760
And you know, with the Zelda game coming out this year, I think that's where the focus

2249
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:42,760
is.

2250
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:46,120
So I'm not too shocked to hear there's not a mainline Mario game coming out.

2251
01:49:46,120 --> 01:49:51,200
However, what I want to know is, does this also rule out Mario galaxy?

2252
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:55,880
Because I would think that that is the series that really needs another game.

2253
01:49:55,880 --> 01:50:01,000
And I think that a lot of people want to see on Wii U or is that the 2016 plan?

2254
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,360
I don't know, but I would think a Mario galaxy game would be a good one.

2255
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:06,960
I don't think they're going to have another Mario game next year, just because they've

2256
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:09,120
got a Zelda game coming out of the beach.

2257
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:10,600
I think that they would be kind of...

2258
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:12,240
But that would also be a power Christmas.

2259
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:15,040
Yeah, it would be, but then what do you bring for next year?

2260
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:16,040
That's the problem.

2261
01:50:16,040 --> 01:50:20,080
It's like, so they got to space it out so that they have one, you know, core franchise

2262
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:24,720
title that, you know, it's a Mario or Zelda title that's really going to bring in, you

2263
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:28,640
know, people interests in the console that may not have the console already.

2264
01:50:28,640 --> 01:50:33,680
So I don't think, I mean, cause honestly, like, you know, when they were pitching Pikmin

2265
01:50:33,680 --> 01:50:36,520
three or whatever, it's just not a system seller.

2266
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:40,240
Some people like that game, but it's not something like, Oh my God, I got to get a Wii U for

2267
01:50:40,240 --> 01:50:41,240
that.

2268
01:50:41,240 --> 01:50:42,240
You know, I don't know.

2269
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:46,520
I just think that we'll have to see what else that they have beyond Zelda.

2270
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:48,240
Star Fox is definitely a positive.

2271
01:50:48,240 --> 01:50:49,240
So I mean, that'll help.

2272
01:50:49,240 --> 01:50:50,240
Yeah.

2273
01:50:50,240 --> 01:50:51,240
We're not hearing a lot about that.

2274
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:55,880
I think I would be willing to, I could see Star Fox being delayed to next year, but I

2275
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:56,880
don't know.

2276
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:57,880
We'll see.

2277
01:50:58,120 --> 01:50:59,720
I think they're going to have to have some spring titles.

2278
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:02,400
I mean, there's Mario maker and I would hope Star Fox is in there too.

2279
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:05,360
Maybe there'll be a direct or something that gives more information.

2280
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:09,360
Maybe Star Fox is like that summer title, like the June type of release.

2281
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:10,360
At least I hope so.

2282
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:11,360
I hope so.

2283
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:15,040
I think there's a lot of us that are really, uh, you know, we're, we're hoping for Nintendo

2284
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:19,120
and you know, they had a really good year this year and, um, you know, if they can keep

2285
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:23,980
that inertia going in the face of increasing competition from the Sony and Microsoft exclusives

2286
01:51:23,980 --> 01:51:27,600
that start dropping next year, cause there's going to be some big ones between, you know,

2287
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:31,440
Halo five is obviously going to be Microsoft's big thing next year.

2288
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:35,000
Uh, Sony's got uncharted four and you know, these other things that they were pitching

2289
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,440
at their own conference.

2290
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:42,640
Um, I, I, uh, I, I, I really cheering for Nintendo and I hope they can, uh, hope they

2291
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:43,640
can pull through.

2292
01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:44,640
All right.

2293
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:49,800
Well, we're making a lot of bold predictions right now, so let's make some more in a segment

2294
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:51,600
we call listless.

2295
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:58,440
I hope y'all know this game by now cause we just played it two weeks ago to do the

2296
01:51:58,440 --> 01:52:02,080
VOG jam theme, but here's the way listless works.

2297
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:07,720
We are going to create a list with our hosts here in studio and joining us tonight for

2298
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:09,040
the 2015 predictions.

2299
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:14,000
You guys really got a kick out of his predictions last year, so he is back joining us a special

2300
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,000
tonight.

2301
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Say hello to Alan.

2302
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Hello.

2303
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Hi Alan.

2304
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,000
How are you?

2305
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:20,000
I'm good.

2306
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,000
How's dragon age going?

2307
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:22,400
Good.

2308
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:23,400
Can you chat?

2309
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:24,400
Hear me okay?

2310
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:25,400
All right.

2311
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:31,560
Um, I'm, I just started the legacy DLC for dragon age two, which for inquisition is very

2312
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:32,560
important.

2313
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:33,560
Oh, okay.

2314
01:52:33,560 --> 01:52:34,560
No spoilers.

2315
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:35,560
OMG spoilers.

2316
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:36,560
Okay.

2317
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:37,560
OMG.

2318
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:39,920
Uh, what, anything else of gaming that you want to point out that you've been up to lately?

2319
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:42,480
Diablo three forever.

2320
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:44,680
You broke paragon 120 now, right?

2321
01:52:44,680 --> 01:52:50,240
130 and I'm doing torment five, but not very well.

2322
01:52:50,240 --> 01:52:51,240
It's a struggle.

2323
01:52:51,240 --> 01:52:52,240
It's a struggle.

2324
01:52:52,240 --> 01:52:53,240
It's a struggle.

2325
01:52:53,240 --> 01:52:54,240
The struggle is real.

2326
01:52:54,240 --> 01:52:55,240
Uh, what else?

2327
01:52:55,240 --> 01:52:57,960
Any, any used to cohost a podcast and all that fun, so you're not doing anything like

2328
01:52:57,960 --> 01:52:58,960
that right now.

2329
01:52:58,960 --> 01:52:59,960
No projects for people to follow.

2330
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:00,960
No.

2331
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:01,960
Just your sassy tweets.

2332
01:53:01,960 --> 01:53:02,960
Yes.

2333
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:03,960
All right.

2334
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:04,960
That works.

2335
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:05,960
That works.

2336
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:06,960
All right.

2337
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:07,960
Well, Alan's going to be joining us with his predictions tonight.

2338
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:09,720
Um, sadly, Jason was with us last year, but he's on the road driving back today.

2339
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:14,320
Uh, so I'll be curious to see what, uh, cause he, he was the most accurate last year.

2340
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:17,200
So it'll be a hoot and a holler and let the list turns out this year.

2341
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:18,200
So, um, okay.

2342
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:22,120
Anyway, let's get back to the music here while I explain the way listless works.

2343
01:53:22,120 --> 01:53:23,120
All right.

2344
01:53:23,120 --> 01:53:27,080
So we are going to build a list and the way that we are going to build the list is each

2345
01:53:27,080 --> 01:53:31,380
host, uh, and Alan, our, our special cohost tonight, we'll go around and give their top

2346
01:53:31,380 --> 01:53:32,600
three answers.

2347
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:36,800
Then the difficult round comes where we each eliminate one answer from the list that will

2348
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:41,920
leave a list of eight that you, the listeners, the live chatters, the live folks can vote

2349
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:47,940
on in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

2350
01:53:47,940 --> 01:53:50,660
You must be logged into the site to see it.

2351
01:53:50,660 --> 01:53:54,500
If you're not logged in, you will not see a pop up right under the chat, but we're going

2352
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:56,340
to put up the board right now.

2353
01:53:56,340 --> 01:54:01,740
What is the official OLR quote 2015 in video gaming prediction?

2354
01:54:01,740 --> 01:54:03,340
So we did it last year and it was a lot of fun.

2355
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:05,620
So we're going to do it again right now.

2356
01:54:05,620 --> 01:54:09,380
Um, okay, so here we go.

2357
01:54:09,380 --> 01:54:10,660
We're going to go around and build this list.

2358
01:54:10,660 --> 01:54:12,100
I do want to warn you guys in advance.

2359
01:54:12,100 --> 01:54:17,940
If you're expecting some very hardcore, serious, very, very Michael patcher analyst, serious

2360
01:54:17,940 --> 01:54:22,800
predictions, you're listening to the wrong show.

2361
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:26,740
Our predictions tend to be a little bit tongue in cheek.

2362
01:54:26,740 --> 01:54:28,780
So take with that.

2363
01:54:28,780 --> 01:54:29,780
What do you know?

2364
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:33,380
If you firmly put your tongue into your cheek, it looks like you're sucking on something

2365
01:54:33,380 --> 01:54:34,380
like what?

2366
01:54:34,380 --> 01:54:35,380
A lollipop.

2367
01:54:35,380 --> 01:54:36,380
Cookie.

2368
01:54:36,380 --> 01:54:37,380
Okay.

2369
01:54:37,380 --> 01:54:38,380
Jawbreaker.

2370
01:54:38,380 --> 01:54:39,380
Okay.

2371
01:54:39,380 --> 01:54:40,380
We're going to start tonight with Loki.

2372
01:54:40,660 --> 01:54:44,540
If please, if you have predictions, you think are worthy of the list, put them in the chat

2373
01:54:44,540 --> 01:54:45,540
room.

2374
01:54:45,540 --> 01:54:48,980
Uh, we also have the predictions that came in VR frugal question of the week earlier.

2375
01:54:48,980 --> 01:54:53,220
Uh, usually if a host gets an answer stolen, which happens sometimes two people think the

2376
01:54:53,220 --> 01:54:54,220
same thing.

2377
01:54:54,220 --> 01:54:59,340
We'll turn to our chat room and so forth to help us fill in, uh, those extra spots.

2378
01:54:59,340 --> 01:55:01,020
So, uh, here we go.

2379
01:55:01,020 --> 01:55:04,180
And SSJ 100, Matt telling people, if you don't have a vog account, you can register in like

2380
01:55:04,180 --> 01:55:06,100
five seconds, then you can vote on the list list.

2381
01:55:06,100 --> 01:55:07,100
That's absolutely right.

2382
01:55:07,100 --> 01:55:08,100
All right.

2383
01:55:08,100 --> 01:55:09,100
We're gonna start with Loki tonight.

2384
01:55:09,100 --> 01:55:14,500
What is your number three answer for the official OLR 2015 and video gaming prediction?

2385
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:19,420
Oh, it's unfortunate, but my game won't be out next year or this year.

2386
01:55:19,420 --> 01:55:23,460
I mean, yeah, it's 2015.

2387
01:55:23,460 --> 01:55:30,180
Rob just wheezed, I just wheezed because I love the, this is basically his, his way of

2388
01:55:30,180 --> 01:55:32,220
announcing he's already delayed his game.

2389
01:55:32,220 --> 01:55:33,220
No, I haven't.

2390
01:55:33,220 --> 01:55:35,820
I'm just like, I'm, I'm being realistic here.

2391
01:55:35,820 --> 01:55:40,020
You know, I hope that I'm wrong and I hope I can prove myself wrong, but I just don't

2392
01:55:40,020 --> 01:55:41,660
think it's going on his wall.

2393
01:55:41,660 --> 01:55:45,500
He has a big banner that says the mentor and it's Gabe Newell and he kisses his fingers

2394
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:48,420
and presses it to his lips and says, no game this year.

2395
01:55:48,420 --> 01:55:52,700
I'm doing it for you.

2396
01:55:52,700 --> 01:56:04,580
Loki's game gets delayed kissing his Gavin, uh, scroll going, I learned from you pop up.

2397
01:56:04,740 --> 01:56:06,940
Don't listen to the, what the rest of them say.

2398
01:56:06,940 --> 01:56:07,940
It's our time.

2399
01:56:07,940 --> 01:56:08,940
Okay.

2400
01:56:08,940 --> 01:56:10,680
We weren't, we were working on this in our time.

2401
01:56:10,680 --> 01:56:12,420
Just bring me another say me time.

2402
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:13,420
Bring me another sale.

2403
01:56:13,420 --> 01:56:15,460
Big pop me time valve time.

2404
01:56:15,460 --> 01:56:17,460
All right.

2405
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:20,000
I will go next with my number three answer.

2406
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:24,660
My number three answer on the list will be, okay, look, this is the thing that nobody

2407
01:56:24,660 --> 01:56:30,640
wants to hear, but we had an answer similar to this earlier that some company is going

2408
01:56:30,640 --> 01:56:33,020
to go under this next year.

2409
01:56:33,020 --> 01:56:38,060
And as much as you guys don't want to hear it, my answer is Konami gets bought.

2410
01:56:38,060 --> 01:56:39,060
That's right.

2411
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:42,100
Konami, who we have to thank probably for this show's existence.

2412
01:56:42,100 --> 01:56:45,340
I'm going out on the line and saying, Konami gets bought.

2413
01:56:45,340 --> 01:56:49,660
Look, I know they have a big casino business and all this other stuff that they're making

2414
01:56:49,660 --> 01:56:54,220
money from now, but let's be real, Konami ain't quite in the same shape that it was

2415
01:56:54,220 --> 01:56:55,220
before.

2416
01:56:55,220 --> 01:56:58,980
So, uh, I'm, I'm going to be so bold as to say, Konami gets bought.

2417
01:56:58,980 --> 01:57:02,700
They get bought by Capcom and then they can be mediocre together.

2418
01:57:02,700 --> 01:57:07,860
Just I'm just, I'm just, I'm just being a salt snake and street fighter.

2419
01:57:07,860 --> 01:57:08,860
I'm down with that.

2420
01:57:08,860 --> 01:57:09,860
That's right.

2421
01:57:09,860 --> 01:57:10,860
That's right.

2422
01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:11,940
Street fighter versus metal gear.

2423
01:57:11,940 --> 01:57:12,940
Let's hear it.

2424
01:57:12,940 --> 01:57:13,940
Let's hear.

2425
01:57:13,940 --> 01:57:14,940
All right.

2426
01:57:14,940 --> 01:57:15,940
Konami gets bought.

2427
01:57:15,940 --> 01:57:16,940
I'm putting that up on the board.

2428
01:57:16,940 --> 01:57:17,940
All right.

2429
01:57:17,940 --> 01:57:18,940
Dark Sakura, you're up next.

2430
01:57:18,940 --> 01:57:19,940
What is your number three?

2431
01:57:19,940 --> 01:57:28,020
The black Wolf in chat says like Capcom can afford.

2432
01:57:28,020 --> 01:57:32,540
I would love to see yacht club games by Capcom or, or what's the company making mighty number

2433
01:57:32,540 --> 01:57:33,540
nine.

2434
01:57:33,540 --> 01:57:34,540
All right.

2435
01:57:34,540 --> 01:57:35,540
Anyway, I'm all laughing aside.

2436
01:57:35,540 --> 01:57:38,200
Dark Sakura, what is your number three answer?

2437
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:42,780
Mind controlled game as in, well, they've got the technology now to where they can use

2438
01:57:42,780 --> 01:57:49,500
nerve, uh, your nerves to control like, you know, external lens and prosthetics and everything.

2439
01:57:49,500 --> 01:57:54,020
And they're working on, um, you know, wiring the brain where, you know, they're, they can

2440
01:57:54,020 --> 01:57:56,500
give vision to people who are blind.

2441
01:57:56,500 --> 01:58:01,300
It just seems to me that it's probably not going to happen, but I think sometime in the

2442
01:58:01,300 --> 01:58:05,440
future, we're going to have that technology to where someone can use their nerve impulses

2443
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:07,740
or something to control a figure in a game.

2444
01:58:07,740 --> 01:58:13,260
So maybe we'll say, um, could we go so far as to say consumer mind control game?

2445
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:14,260
Possibly.

2446
01:58:14,260 --> 01:58:15,260
Okay.

2447
01:58:15,260 --> 01:58:17,180
I'm going to just put that on there because I think some might argue that that game already

2448
01:58:17,180 --> 01:58:20,260
exists in these very, like kind of what you were saying there.

2449
01:58:20,260 --> 01:58:24,340
So I think if we say consumer mind control game, then we can definitely say this doesn't

2450
01:58:24,340 --> 01:58:26,300
exist yet, but may later.

2451
01:58:26,300 --> 01:58:27,300
May later.

2452
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:28,300
All right.

2453
01:58:28,300 --> 01:58:29,540
Uh, let's see.

2454
01:58:29,540 --> 01:58:31,460
Going to our list here.

2455
01:58:31,460 --> 01:58:33,420
So far, we got Loki's game gets delayed.

2456
01:58:33,420 --> 01:58:36,020
Konami gets bought and consumer mind controlled game.

2457
01:58:36,020 --> 01:58:37,020
Thank you.

2458
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:38,020
Chat rooms.

2459
01:58:38,020 --> 01:58:39,020
Comcept.

2460
01:58:39,020 --> 01:58:40,020
That's what I was thinking of.

2461
01:58:40,020 --> 01:58:41,020
Comcept.

2462
01:58:41,020 --> 01:58:42,020
Comcept will buy them both.

2463
01:58:42,020 --> 01:58:43,020
They'll overtake the earth.

2464
01:58:43,020 --> 01:58:44,020
Alan alchemy.

2465
01:58:44,020 --> 01:58:45,020
We are to you now.

2466
01:58:45,020 --> 01:58:46,700
Last year, your number three answer was a bit of a shocker.

2467
01:58:46,700 --> 01:58:49,100
So I'm, I'm very curious what you have in store for us this year.

2468
01:58:49,100 --> 01:58:51,740
I have one grim, serious one.

2469
01:58:51,740 --> 01:58:52,740
Okay.

2470
01:58:53,220 --> 01:58:55,660
I have backups now that it's going to come later.

2471
01:58:55,660 --> 01:58:56,940
I do have backups.

2472
01:58:56,940 --> 01:59:00,860
Most of them are too safe.

2473
01:59:00,860 --> 01:59:02,140
So that's kind of the mood I'm in.

2474
01:59:02,140 --> 01:59:03,140
All right.

2475
01:59:03,140 --> 01:59:07,500
Um, let's see.

2476
01:59:07,500 --> 01:59:14,900
Yet another three D S Q and enhancement of the two DS and enhancement or a smaller version

2477
01:59:14,900 --> 01:59:18,480
of the one that came out that has the removable face plates.

2478
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:21,940
They're going to redo that before the year is up and may not be out, but it'll be announced.

2479
01:59:21,940 --> 01:59:24,420
I think they should make a transformer three DS.

2480
01:59:24,420 --> 01:59:26,340
That's both a three DS and a two DS.

2481
01:59:26,340 --> 01:59:27,580
There you go.

2482
01:59:27,580 --> 01:59:28,820
And the new three DS doesn't count.

2483
01:59:28,820 --> 01:59:31,020
I was going to say, isn't the new three DS already?

2484
01:59:31,020 --> 01:59:32,020
No, it doesn't count.

2485
01:59:32,020 --> 01:59:33,100
It's out in Japan.

2486
01:59:33,100 --> 01:59:37,340
So I'm including that one with the second thumb stick and the, and the customized little.

2487
01:59:37,340 --> 01:59:40,420
So if they release that in the U S it doesn't count because it's all right, but they need

2488
01:59:40,420 --> 01:59:43,000
to announce in Japan.

2489
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,420
Another one, yet another something else.

2490
01:59:44,420 --> 01:59:48,580
Yet another three DS skew, no four DS predictions.

2491
01:59:48,580 --> 01:59:51,140
It will bend time.

2492
01:59:51,140 --> 01:59:54,700
All right.

2493
01:59:54,700 --> 01:59:56,040
It has three screens.

2494
01:59:56,040 --> 01:59:57,040
You guys has three.

2495
01:59:57,040 --> 01:59:58,040
All right.

2496
01:59:58,040 --> 01:59:59,580
So our list so far, Loki's game gets delayed.

2497
01:59:59,580 --> 02:00:03,940
Konami gets bought consumer mind controlled game and yet another three DS skew.

2498
02:00:03,940 --> 02:00:05,940
All right.

2499
02:00:05,940 --> 02:00:07,300
Let's go to the number two answers.

2500
02:00:07,300 --> 02:00:10,440
Loki, what are you gonna put on the list?

2501
02:00:10,440 --> 02:00:13,820
This is so not going to happen next year, but I'm just going to throw it out there anyways

2502
02:00:13,820 --> 02:00:18,460
because I would, you know, was ill prepared and didn't prepare beforehand.

2503
02:00:18,460 --> 02:00:22,940
But I'm just going to make a bold announcement that, uh, Microsoft is going to announce,

2504
02:00:22,940 --> 02:00:24,480
Hey, you know what?

2505
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:30,540
Now is the time for Minecraft two electric boogaloo.

2506
02:00:30,540 --> 02:00:33,460
I almost put that on my list.

2507
02:00:33,460 --> 02:00:36,940
Uh, Microsoft says they go all in and they say Minecraft two.

2508
02:00:36,940 --> 02:00:37,940
Yeah.

2509
02:00:37,940 --> 02:00:38,940
E three.

2510
02:00:38,940 --> 02:00:43,620
I think, I think it's even so bold as to announce it at E3 Minecraft two and they bring out

2511
02:00:43,620 --> 02:00:48,660
some hoity-toity developer who's working on it, who took over for the guy who just bought

2512
02:00:48,660 --> 02:00:53,500
Beyonce's mission.

2513
02:00:53,500 --> 02:01:02,700
They have Lars Von Trier is the artistic director for Minecraft two.

2514
02:01:02,700 --> 02:01:08,300
It's really badly lit and nobody's wearing makeup and the blocks of despair won't stop

2515
02:01:08,300 --> 02:01:09,300
crying

2516
02:01:09,300 --> 02:01:15,700
Wow.

2517
02:01:15,700 --> 02:01:18,900
Lars Von Trier is Minecraft two.

2518
02:01:18,900 --> 02:01:19,900
I love it.

2519
02:01:19,900 --> 02:01:20,900
All right.

2520
02:01:20,900 --> 02:01:21,900
Uh, there it is.

2521
02:01:21,900 --> 02:01:22,900
It's on the list.

2522
02:01:22,900 --> 02:01:24,220
Let's go to the next answer.

2523
02:01:24,220 --> 02:01:28,140
See, the sad thing is half our chatters probably don't even understand how funny that really

2524
02:01:28,140 --> 02:01:29,140
is when he just did.

2525
02:01:29,140 --> 02:01:30,140
All right.

2526
02:01:30,140 --> 02:01:32,460
Anyway, but for the half to do that to do all right.

2527
02:01:32,460 --> 02:01:38,580
My number two answer, you know what this we've seen in the past year that third party support

2528
02:01:38,580 --> 02:01:40,660
has really been hurting the Wii U.

2529
02:01:40,660 --> 02:01:46,660
And so what I'm going to say is going to happen in 2015 EA is going to buckle under the pressure

2530
02:01:46,660 --> 02:01:51,860
of the society and the tweets and all that stuff EA is going to release a Wii U game

2531
02:01:51,860 --> 02:02:04,000
and it tanks EA releases a Wii U game finally and it tanks, but not counting all the stuff

2532
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,000
they've already released.

2533
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:08,380
I realized they had like four in the window, but let's be real.

2534
02:02:08,380 --> 02:02:14,500
So by definition, they would be releasing a third party game on the Wii U, so that would

2535
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:16,140
tank anyways by default.

2536
02:02:16,140 --> 02:02:17,140
Oh, stop.

2537
02:02:17,140 --> 02:02:21,340
I know that their Wii U version of mass effect three is the definitive one.

2538
02:02:21,340 --> 02:02:24,060
It's the best one out there.

2539
02:02:24,060 --> 02:02:25,260
I own it.

2540
02:02:25,260 --> 02:02:26,260
I own it.

2541
02:02:26,260 --> 02:02:27,260
All right.

2542
02:02:27,260 --> 02:02:28,260
Uh, it's just the comic.

2543
02:02:28,260 --> 02:02:31,020
The pro they should have just put out the goddamn trilogy and the no DLC and then a

2544
02:02:31,020 --> 02:02:32,020
multiplayer.

2545
02:02:32,020 --> 02:02:34,060
They had just put out the goddamn trilogy on Wii U.

2546
02:02:34,060 --> 02:02:36,620
It would have been fine because then it would have been the same price.

2547
02:02:36,620 --> 02:02:41,620
It wasn't anyway, nerd rage, dark soccer.

2548
02:02:41,620 --> 02:02:43,300
What's your number two answer.

2549
02:02:43,300 --> 02:02:49,800
We have an entire year full of, uh, dragon age inquisition DLC that includes something

2550
02:02:49,800 --> 02:02:54,100
that was much like Citadel for mass effect.

2551
02:02:54,100 --> 02:02:58,820
I personally am looking forward to the egg hunt DLC and I'm not going to spoil anything

2552
02:02:58,820 --> 02:02:59,820
from that.

2553
02:02:59,820 --> 02:03:00,820
All right.

2554
02:03:00,820 --> 02:03:04,980
A year full of dragon age inquisition DLC.

2555
02:03:04,980 --> 02:03:08,500
Talk about a safe answer.

2556
02:03:08,500 --> 02:03:10,060
BioWare DLC.

2557
02:03:10,060 --> 02:03:11,060
Get out, get out.

2558
02:03:11,060 --> 02:03:12,060
All right.

2559
02:03:12,060 --> 02:03:15,460
The thing is that they had said that they weren't going to be able to do DLC for frostbite

2560
02:03:15,460 --> 02:03:16,460
or something.

2561
02:03:16,460 --> 02:03:18,420
I think they're going to figure it out.

2562
02:03:18,420 --> 02:03:19,420
Oh, it's a miracle.

2563
02:03:19,420 --> 02:03:21,340
They already said, oh, it can't be modded.

2564
02:03:21,340 --> 02:03:22,820
Yeah, I can.

2565
02:03:22,820 --> 02:03:23,820
People are already doing it.

2566
02:03:23,820 --> 02:03:24,820
It's a miracle.

2567
02:03:24,820 --> 02:03:25,820
Okay.

2568
02:03:25,820 --> 02:03:27,920
I see where your answer comes from because they've gone on record saying they're not

2569
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:28,920
going to do it.

2570
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:29,920
Then they're going to come back and say JK.

2571
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:31,740
And what's the first character mod that came out?

2572
02:03:31,740 --> 02:03:39,020
A softer Cassandra with makeup and without her scar because dude, bros are gross.

2573
02:03:39,020 --> 02:03:40,500
Do we have nudie mods yet?

2574
02:03:40,500 --> 02:03:41,500
No.

2575
02:03:41,500 --> 02:03:45,420
Someone's trying to do one for solace to make him look like his original concept where he

2576
02:03:45,420 --> 02:03:46,420
had the black dreads.

2577
02:03:46,420 --> 02:03:53,300
Actually, there is, um, if, if a NPC that you can romance has a tasteful sex scene where

2578
02:03:53,300 --> 02:03:57,020
it shows them like you get to see Dorian's butt, sorry for spoilers.

2579
02:03:57,020 --> 02:04:00,980
People have found a way to take that skin and force it over his clothes in the real

2580
02:04:00,980 --> 02:04:01,980
game.

2581
02:04:01,980 --> 02:04:04,940
And there's also the fly cam is available now.

2582
02:04:04,940 --> 02:04:08,260
I mean, the, which basically you can see the dudes have no junk.

2583
02:04:08,260 --> 02:04:09,260
That's it.

2584
02:04:09,260 --> 02:04:10,260
All right.

2585
02:04:10,260 --> 02:04:13,020
Well, uh, Alan, it's time for your number two choice.

2586
02:04:13,020 --> 02:04:16,140
What is your number two 2015 gaming prediction?

2587
02:04:16,140 --> 02:04:23,560
Punishing abject silence from valve on anything except financials.

2588
02:04:23,560 --> 02:04:27,940
No controller, no DLC for Dota two, nothing.

2589
02:04:27,940 --> 02:04:29,660
No steam machines.

2590
02:04:29,660 --> 02:04:32,500
You're going to go with the guy who says the steam machines don't happen, but they could

2591
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:35,580
have updates on a team fortress too.

2592
02:04:35,580 --> 02:04:41,980
Well, yeah, I mean, but as far as like a, like an, uh, an announcement as to like no

2593
02:04:41,980 --> 02:04:47,180
fucking three that's or, or, well, yeah, but also no left for dead three, no source to

2594
02:04:47,180 --> 02:04:52,860
no can no new controller yet another year of Jack and shit from, from valve aside from

2595
02:04:52,860 --> 02:04:55,300
our steam store made a lot of money.

2596
02:04:55,300 --> 02:04:56,300
That's it.

2597
02:04:56,300 --> 02:04:57,300
That's all we're getting.

2598
02:04:57,300 --> 02:04:58,700
All right.

2599
02:04:58,740 --> 02:04:59,740
Fair enough.

2600
02:04:59,740 --> 02:05:00,740
Fair enough.

2601
02:05:00,740 --> 02:05:01,740
All right.

2602
02:05:01,740 --> 02:05:06,660
Let's get now to the number one answers, hopefully going to be a little more, a little more out

2603
02:05:06,660 --> 02:05:07,660
of the safe zone.

2604
02:05:07,660 --> 02:05:08,660
We'll see.

2605
02:05:08,660 --> 02:05:09,660
We'll see.

2606
02:05:09,660 --> 02:05:10,660
All right.

2607
02:05:10,660 --> 02:05:11,660
Loki, one more item for the board.

2608
02:05:11,660 --> 02:05:12,660
What is it going to be for you?

2609
02:05:12,660 --> 02:05:13,660
Since we've already heard the rumors.

2610
02:05:13,660 --> 02:05:16,380
I'm just going to go with it anyways, that there will be a new console that will enter

2611
02:05:16,380 --> 02:05:19,540
the market to compete with the other consoles.

2612
02:05:19,540 --> 02:05:20,540
From a new company?

2613
02:05:20,540 --> 02:05:21,540
From another company.

2614
02:05:21,540 --> 02:05:22,540
Yes.

2615
02:05:22,540 --> 02:05:26,260
So, but you're not talking something like Ouya, you're talking something like big from

2616
02:05:26,260 --> 02:05:31,700
like Samsung or somebody enters in a big way with a console on the level of PlayStation

2617
02:05:31,700 --> 02:05:32,700
four, Xbox one.

2618
02:05:32,700 --> 02:05:33,700
All right.

2619
02:05:33,700 --> 02:05:34,700
Fair enough.

2620
02:05:34,700 --> 02:05:35,700
That's a bold prediction.

2621
02:05:35,700 --> 02:05:36,700
Sure is.

2622
02:05:36,700 --> 02:05:39,260
I mean, that, that may be their intention.

2623
02:05:39,260 --> 02:05:43,480
Will it go the way you do you ever maybe, but there will be someone that will at least

2624
02:05:43,480 --> 02:05:44,480
make the attempt.

2625
02:05:44,480 --> 02:05:46,180
All right.

2626
02:05:46,180 --> 02:05:51,260
My number one answer is going to be, uh, you know, and some of you may say that's never

2627
02:05:51,260 --> 02:05:53,140
going to happen and that might be true.

2628
02:05:53,140 --> 02:05:57,060
So maybe this one is just wishful thinking a little bit, but not my number one answer

2629
02:05:57,060 --> 02:06:02,500
is one of those DDOS brats gets the death penalty.

2630
02:06:02,500 --> 02:06:03,500
That's my number one answer.

2631
02:06:03,500 --> 02:06:04,500
That's a little much.

2632
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:09,600
I'm not saying, I didn't say it was because of the DDOS thing.

2633
02:06:09,600 --> 02:06:11,620
I just said, they're going to get the death penalty.

2634
02:06:11,620 --> 02:06:13,840
We're setting an example of this guy.

2635
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:17,420
So there it is set an example.

2636
02:06:17,420 --> 02:06:18,420
So there it is.

2637
02:06:18,420 --> 02:06:20,380
One of the DDOS brats gets the death penalty.

2638
02:06:20,380 --> 02:06:21,380
That's my number one.

2639
02:06:21,380 --> 02:06:26,580
We already have a precedent of a hacker getting, um, more punishment than the crimes that they

2640
02:06:26,580 --> 02:06:27,580
exposed in the hack.

2641
02:06:27,580 --> 02:06:32,180
And to, and to, and to elaborate also, and when I said, yes, it will not be just another

2642
02:06:32,180 --> 02:06:33,180
Android console.

2643
02:06:33,180 --> 02:06:36,620
It will be a console console, not an Android console.

2644
02:06:36,620 --> 02:06:37,620
All right.

2645
02:06:37,620 --> 02:06:38,620
Fair enough.

2646
02:06:38,620 --> 02:06:41,560
And again, I'm not saying they got the death penalty because of the DDOS.

2647
02:06:41,560 --> 02:06:46,460
It's just, you know, how long until someone dies over the shit is all I'm saying.

2648
02:06:46,460 --> 02:06:49,220
How long, how long?

2649
02:06:49,220 --> 02:06:52,260
Bonds 006 says, wow, Rob, a bit harsh there.

2650
02:06:52,260 --> 02:06:53,260
Nope.

2651
02:06:53,260 --> 02:06:54,260
Nope.

2652
02:06:54,260 --> 02:07:02,260
How dare you take away my PlayStation during Christmas.

2653
02:07:02,260 --> 02:07:04,660
But maybe, maybe they just happened to murder somebody too.

2654
02:07:04,660 --> 02:07:06,640
I mean, they already have a record of crime.

2655
02:07:06,640 --> 02:07:11,380
Now I just picture you as a Mrs. White.

2656
02:07:11,380 --> 02:07:13,980
I hated them so much.

2657
02:07:13,980 --> 02:07:17,100
Flames on the side of my face.

2658
02:07:17,100 --> 02:07:24,460
Yes, because you know, it's, it's such a slippery slope, you know, uh, executing code to, you

2659
02:07:24,460 --> 02:07:32,140
know, use a system, you know, a, a bunch of, um, you know, computers to flood a site and

2660
02:07:32,140 --> 02:07:33,140
murder.

2661
02:07:33,140 --> 02:07:34,140
Yeah.

2662
02:07:34,140 --> 02:07:38,420
It's pretty similar, pushy pixels and chat saying, remind me not to pirate anything around

2663
02:07:38,420 --> 02:07:39,420
to Rob.

2664
02:07:39,420 --> 02:07:43,780
And fifth dream says we get to punch you once for every request you sent the server.

2665
02:07:43,780 --> 02:07:45,340
I love that idea.

2666
02:07:45,340 --> 02:07:48,900
Punch them in the Dick one time for every request that they sent to the server.

2667
02:07:48,900 --> 02:07:49,900
You know what?

2668
02:07:49,900 --> 02:07:55,060
They could be, they could be genetically female, uh, then punched them in the hoo-ha once every

2669
02:07:55,060 --> 02:07:56,060
time.

2670
02:07:56,060 --> 02:07:59,060
Ha, we didn't send a request to the server.

2671
02:07:59,060 --> 02:08:00,060
Other computers did.

2672
02:08:00,060 --> 02:08:05,660
So ha, no Dick punches for me, genital punching, genital punching for everybody.

2673
02:08:05,660 --> 02:08:09,780
That was the name of my band in high school.

2674
02:08:09,780 --> 02:08:15,620
I don't really like this new punch out game from Nintendo.

2675
02:08:15,620 --> 02:08:18,220
We you presents little Mac gentle to punch.

2676
02:08:18,220 --> 02:08:19,220
All right.

2677
02:08:19,220 --> 02:08:22,740
Uh, dark Sakura, your number one answer.

2678
02:08:22,740 --> 02:08:28,780
Mass Effect four will be surprisingly good and still piss people off because it won't

2679
02:08:28,780 --> 02:08:29,780
be out next year.

2680
02:08:29,780 --> 02:08:30,780
Hold on.

2681
02:08:30,780 --> 02:08:32,140
I'm writing that down.

2682
02:08:32,140 --> 02:08:33,140
Mass Effect four is good.

2683
02:08:33,140 --> 02:08:35,220
It will still piss people off.

2684
02:08:35,220 --> 02:08:36,220
Yes.

2685
02:08:36,220 --> 02:08:42,100
What a Jamie list we have here with dragon age and Mass Effect mind control and mind

2686
02:08:42,100 --> 02:08:43,100
control.

2687
02:08:43,100 --> 02:08:44,100
At least bizarre tech.

2688
02:08:44,100 --> 02:08:45,100
All right.

2689
02:08:45,100 --> 02:08:46,100
There it is.

2690
02:08:46,100 --> 02:08:47,380
It's added there to the list.

2691
02:08:47,380 --> 02:08:50,220
Alan alchemy, your number one answer.

2692
02:08:50,220 --> 02:08:52,100
The very last entry on the list.

2693
02:08:52,100 --> 02:08:56,460
I want an opportunity once the chat has voted at the end of the show to read off quickly

2694
02:08:56,460 --> 02:08:57,980
mice throw away ones.

2695
02:08:57,980 --> 02:08:58,980
Sure.

2696
02:08:58,980 --> 02:08:59,980
Got some good stuff here.

2697
02:08:59,980 --> 02:09:00,980
Sure.

2698
02:09:00,980 --> 02:09:01,980
Should I do the grim serious one?

2699
02:09:01,980 --> 02:09:02,980
Absolutely.

2700
02:09:02,980 --> 02:09:03,980
All right.

2701
02:09:03,980 --> 02:09:12,220
This year there will be, uh, within the industry lit litigation from a woman or women about

2702
02:09:12,220 --> 02:09:13,220
a social issue.

2703
02:09:13,220 --> 02:09:14,220
Oh no.

2704
02:09:14,220 --> 02:09:15,220
What?

2705
02:09:15,220 --> 02:09:18,380
Like an IGN reporter was like, Oh yeah, these dudes at such and such company said that if

2706
02:09:18,380 --> 02:09:23,100
I gave them their phone number, they'd let me preview a game like actual, like it's going

2707
02:09:23,100 --> 02:09:27,820
to come out and there will be damages over rewarded.

2708
02:09:27,820 --> 02:09:29,300
Sorry.

2709
02:09:29,300 --> 02:09:30,420
It's depressing how likely that is.

2710
02:09:30,420 --> 02:09:33,220
If you don't want to, if you don't want to put it, I'll, I'll put it on the line.

2711
02:09:33,460 --> 02:09:34,460
I'm fine with it.

2712
02:09:34,460 --> 02:09:40,020
It's yeah, it's, uh, it's, it's as, as sick as the answer you put up last year.

2713
02:09:40,020 --> 02:09:45,060
So actual journalism scandal over, uh, yeah.

2714
02:09:45,060 --> 02:09:46,620
Over sex for secrets.

2715
02:09:46,620 --> 02:09:51,460
Or it could be, um, like a racial thing or like gay thing, but just something.

2716
02:09:51,460 --> 02:09:54,740
Or could I just say an actual ethics and journalism debate?

2717
02:09:54,740 --> 02:10:01,800
Well, yeah, but my, my thing that makes it, my point is that it's at actual goes to litigation.

2718
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:06,400
Like there's an act where it's civic court, like someone is sued by a person or groups

2719
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:07,840
of people over an issue like this.

2720
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:08,840
Okay.

2721
02:10:08,840 --> 02:10:13,000
So I'm going to say on the board, actual journey journalism scandal to litigation over sex

2722
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:14,000
for secrets.

2723
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:15,000
Yes.

2724
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:16,000
All right.

2725
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:17,000
There it is.

2726
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:18,000
It's up on the board.

2727
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:23,080
We can always rely on Alan to give us something depressing and humbling, uh, to ruin our new

2728
02:10:23,080 --> 02:10:24,080
year.

2729
02:10:24,080 --> 02:10:25,080
There it is.

2730
02:10:25,080 --> 02:10:26,080
Thank you, Alan.

2731
02:10:26,080 --> 02:10:27,280
Uh, here it is the list.

2732
02:10:27,280 --> 02:10:29,840
Let's go through the answers that are on the list.

2733
02:10:29,840 --> 02:10:32,560
And then we get to the eliminations.

2734
02:10:32,560 --> 02:10:34,200
Loki's game gets delayed.

2735
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:37,200
Konami gets bought consumer mind controlled game.

2736
02:10:37,200 --> 02:10:38,840
Yet another 3DS skew.

2737
02:10:38,840 --> 02:10:44,480
Microsoft announces Minecraft to EA releases a Wii U game and a tanks a year full of dragon

2738
02:10:44,480 --> 02:10:49,440
age inquisition DLC, punishing silence from valve on anything but financials new console

2739
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:50,740
that enters the market.

2740
02:10:50,740 --> 02:10:53,200
One of these DDoS brats gets the death penalty.

2741
02:10:53,200 --> 02:10:54,200
Mass Effect four is good.

2742
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:59,040
It will still piss people off and actual journalism scandal to litigation over sex

2743
02:10:59,040 --> 02:11:00,040
for secrets.

2744
02:11:00,040 --> 02:11:05,120
All right, here's the round that nobody likes, but it must be done as part of scientifically

2745
02:11:05,120 --> 02:11:06,120
the process.

2746
02:11:06,120 --> 02:11:10,640
Loki, since you were first, I'm starting with you tonight, which of these is not worthy

2747
02:11:10,640 --> 02:11:11,640
of the list?

2748
02:11:11,640 --> 02:11:12,640
I cannot be getting bought.

2749
02:11:12,640 --> 02:11:13,640
They're not going to get bought.

2750
02:11:13,640 --> 02:11:17,960
And because they have Metal Gear Solid five coming out and then they've also got silent

2751
02:11:17,960 --> 02:11:21,520
Hills that probably will be out later this year.

2752
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:23,560
I'm pretty confident that they'll be fine.

2753
02:11:23,560 --> 02:11:25,040
You and your fucking realism.

2754
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:26,040
All right.

2755
02:11:26,040 --> 02:11:27,040
It is stricken from the list.

2756
02:11:27,040 --> 02:11:32,120
Konami gets bought is stricken from the list of Capcom getting a lot of, a lot of chat

2757
02:11:32,120 --> 02:11:35,000
room people, not a fan of that answer.

2758
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:38,680
So I think a lot of people very happy you eliminated that from the list.

2759
02:11:38,680 --> 02:11:39,680
All right.

2760
02:11:39,680 --> 02:11:40,680
Uh, I'm up next.

2761
02:11:40,680 --> 02:11:42,760
Uh, which of these is not worthy of the list?

2762
02:11:42,760 --> 02:11:47,760
I am going to say, um, I, uh, sorry.

2763
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:52,800
Uh, no, no, I'm so close to taking one of yours off Jamie, but I'm actually going to

2764
02:11:52,840 --> 02:11:55,120
go ahead and eliminate one of Loki's a revenge vote.

2765
02:11:55,120 --> 02:11:58,840
I'm going to eliminate Loki's game gets delayed because he's not allowed to delay it.

2766
02:11:58,840 --> 02:11:59,840
There it is.

2767
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:00,840
Now it's gone.

2768
02:12:00,840 --> 02:12:01,840
It is stricken from the list.

2769
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:07,200
Well, now you can't, it's gone stricken from the list.

2770
02:12:07,200 --> 02:12:11,760
Dark soccer gets by unscathed that I almost went for one of her answers, but I decided

2771
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:12,760
on that one.

2772
02:12:12,760 --> 02:12:13,760
All right.

2773
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:14,760
My answers are great.

2774
02:12:14,760 --> 02:12:15,760
All right.

2775
02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:16,760
Dark soccer.

2776
02:12:16,760 --> 02:12:17,760
Which of these is not worthy of the list?

2777
02:12:17,760 --> 02:12:21,840
Um, don't, don't hurt yourself.

2778
02:12:21,880 --> 02:12:24,960
I make a career out of hurting myself over here.

2779
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:27,920
Um, get a workman's comp issue away.

2780
02:12:27,920 --> 02:12:33,160
I'm going to say the EU releasing the game that tanks because people buy EU shit anyway.

2781
02:12:33,160 --> 02:12:35,400
EA releasing a Wii U game that tanks.

2782
02:12:35,400 --> 02:12:36,960
You are eliminating that from the list.

2783
02:12:36,960 --> 02:12:37,960
Yeah.

2784
02:12:37,960 --> 02:12:38,960
And sorry.

2785
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:41,560
I mean, that was the only one that really just, and there goes my list.

2786
02:12:41,560 --> 02:12:43,280
They've done good.

2787
02:12:43,280 --> 02:12:44,800
They've done games that haven't tanked.

2788
02:12:44,800 --> 02:12:45,800
All right.

2789
02:12:45,800 --> 02:12:46,800
All right.

2790
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:48,600
Well, I still think that was accurate, but whatever.

2791
02:12:48,600 --> 02:12:53,440
This just means y'all just gave immunity to one of these DDoS brats gets the death penalty

2792
02:12:53,440 --> 02:12:54,440
is now immune.

2793
02:12:54,440 --> 02:12:55,440
I had a plan.

2794
02:12:55,440 --> 02:12:56,440
I had a plan.

2795
02:12:56,440 --> 02:13:01,040
So Alan may not remove that answer because no host may have their list completely eliminated.

2796
02:13:01,040 --> 02:13:05,120
So Alan, that one aside, which of these is not worthy of the list?

2797
02:13:05,120 --> 02:13:11,400
Hmm, I'm sorry.

2798
02:13:11,400 --> 02:13:13,320
I'm reading, I'm reading out off the screen.

2799
02:13:13,320 --> 02:13:15,920
I'm trying to pick between two.

2800
02:13:15,920 --> 02:13:22,920
Uh, I am going to eliminate the mass effect for one just cause I don't think we're getting

2801
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:24,420
it this year.

2802
02:13:24,420 --> 02:13:28,680
And of course people will have a problem with the content Bioware can't win for losing.

2803
02:13:28,680 --> 02:13:30,020
So all right.

2804
02:13:30,020 --> 02:13:33,120
So yeah, I got to admit that was 2016.

2805
02:13:33,120 --> 02:13:36,160
I would say so because I think that's when we're really going to have assets to look

2806
02:13:36,160 --> 02:13:38,160
at for Mass Effect.

2807
02:13:38,160 --> 02:13:39,160
All right.

2808
02:13:39,160 --> 02:13:40,160
Well, sorry, Jamie.

2809
02:13:40,160 --> 02:13:41,160
Sorry, Jamie.

2810
02:13:41,160 --> 02:13:42,160
But it's okay.

2811
02:13:42,160 --> 02:13:43,580
Hey, at least you still have two answers on the board.

2812
02:13:43,580 --> 02:13:44,580
I get one.

2813
02:13:44,580 --> 02:13:48,620
But yours is, but your answer is honestly beautiful.

2814
02:13:48,620 --> 02:13:49,620
It's a precious angel.

2815
02:13:49,620 --> 02:13:50,620
It's a sweet snowflake.

2816
02:13:50,620 --> 02:13:52,460
Well now don't influence the vote, Jamie.

2817
02:13:52,460 --> 02:13:53,460
Don't influence the vote.

2818
02:13:53,460 --> 02:13:54,460
All right.

2819
02:13:54,460 --> 02:13:55,460
Here it is.

2820
02:13:55,460 --> 02:13:56,460
Your list that is left to vote on.

2821
02:13:56,460 --> 02:13:57,860
I was just petting your ego.

2822
02:13:57,860 --> 02:13:58,860
And well, thank you.

2823
02:13:58,860 --> 02:13:59,860
I appreciate that.

2824
02:13:59,860 --> 02:14:00,860
That's always nice to have.

2825
02:14:00,860 --> 02:14:01,860
Uh, here it is.

2826
02:14:01,860 --> 02:14:06,160
The list of the answers you may vote on Microsoft announces Minecraft two new console enters

2827
02:14:06,160 --> 02:14:07,160
the market.

2828
02:14:07,160 --> 02:14:09,860
One of these DDoS brats gets the death penalty.

2829
02:14:09,860 --> 02:14:14,180
Remember mind controlled game a year full of dragon age inquisition DLC yet another

2830
02:14:14,180 --> 02:14:19,900
three DS skew punishing silence from valve on anything but financials and actual journalism

2831
02:14:19,900 --> 02:14:22,620
scandal to litigation over sex for secrets.

2832
02:14:22,620 --> 02:14:23,620
How did that one get by?

2833
02:14:23,620 --> 02:14:24,620
Look at that.

2834
02:14:24,620 --> 02:14:26,440
Alan's list because we expect it.

2835
02:14:26,440 --> 02:14:32,860
The controversial always Alan alchemy is list escapes completely unscathed to look at that.

2836
02:14:32,860 --> 02:14:33,860
So there it is.

2837
02:14:33,860 --> 02:14:34,860
It is your turn to answer.

2838
02:14:34,860 --> 02:14:38,680
You're going to click on your number one and then click on your number two.

2839
02:14:38,680 --> 02:14:39,880
Those votes are weighted.

2840
02:14:39,880 --> 02:14:43,720
So think carefully before clicking, you click on your number one and you click on your number

2841
02:14:43,720 --> 02:14:47,320
two answer and then you're going to click answer at the bottom of the screen and that

2842
02:14:47,320 --> 02:14:52,520
will submit the votes for the official tabulation and we will tabulate those votes and get the

2843
02:14:52,520 --> 02:14:59,320
answer for the official OLR 2015 video gaming prediction after a little bit here on OLR.

2844
02:14:59,320 --> 02:15:02,760
Um, Alan, I'm sure you're probably stepping out at this point to go play more games.

2845
02:15:02,760 --> 02:15:06,000
Oh, you wanted to read some of your rejects.

2846
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,440
Should I do that now or should I do it after the voting?

2847
02:15:08,440 --> 02:15:09,440
Why not?

2848
02:15:09,440 --> 02:15:10,440
Hold on one sec.

2849
02:15:10,440 --> 02:15:11,440
It's too late.

2850
02:15:11,440 --> 02:15:13,880
The list, the top three is coming from these eight, so it's too late now.

2851
02:15:13,880 --> 02:15:14,880
Okay.

2852
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:20,000
The only bummer is if one of these, uh, ends up, uh, uh, being better, but we'll see elder

2853
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:24,680
scrolls online and wild star together become free to play a little bit too.

2854
02:15:24,680 --> 02:15:26,000
That was on my list.

2855
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Okay.

2856
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:31,520
That was my extra answer is that elder scrolls online doesn't make its console release.

2857
02:15:31,520 --> 02:15:35,340
It just similar gets just evaporated.

2858
02:15:35,340 --> 02:15:37,080
Elder scrolls online just evaporates.

2859
02:15:37,080 --> 02:15:38,080
Yeah.

2860
02:15:38,120 --> 02:15:44,760
And then Loki covered this one, but I was going to say Microsoft, Microsoft announces

2861
02:15:44,760 --> 02:15:48,720
officially what they're doing with Minecraft and once everyone sees it, no one will care

2862
02:15:48,720 --> 02:15:49,720
that they bought it.

2863
02:15:49,720 --> 02:15:50,720
They'll love it.

2864
02:15:50,720 --> 02:15:51,720
They'll immediately fickle game.

2865
02:15:51,720 --> 02:15:52,920
We'd be like, yes, I want it.

2866
02:15:52,920 --> 02:15:53,920
It's so good.

2867
02:15:53,920 --> 02:15:55,760
They won't care where it comes from because that's what happens.

2868
02:15:55,760 --> 02:15:56,760
Okay.

2869
02:15:56,760 --> 02:15:59,600
But yeah, that's a very positive answer compared to your negativity.

2870
02:15:59,600 --> 02:16:01,920
And then you'll like this one is just for you.

2871
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:08,840
Some shade, um, polygon at some point over the year posts an editorial masked as news

2872
02:16:08,840 --> 02:16:13,040
that is as dire and catastrophic as it is pretentious.

2873
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:14,040
But see, that's too safe.

2874
02:16:14,040 --> 02:16:15,040
Yeah.

2875
02:16:15,040 --> 02:16:16,040
Obviously will happen.

2876
02:16:16,040 --> 02:16:17,040
That's that.

2877
02:16:17,040 --> 02:16:18,040
That's going to happen every week.

2878
02:16:18,040 --> 02:16:19,600
That's, that's, that's a given.

2879
02:16:19,600 --> 02:16:20,600
So there you go.

2880
02:16:20,600 --> 02:16:23,240
That's a little, little, little more, uh, rainbows and unicorns.

2881
02:16:23,240 --> 02:16:24,240
Those are my spares.

2882
02:16:24,240 --> 02:16:25,240
AKA throwaways.

2883
02:16:25,240 --> 02:16:26,240
That's good.

2884
02:16:26,240 --> 02:16:27,240
That's a good list.

2885
02:16:27,240 --> 02:16:28,240
Thank you.

2886
02:16:28,240 --> 02:16:29,240
You're always a good time.

2887
02:16:29,240 --> 02:16:30,240
You're Lars Von Trier Minecraft though.

2888
02:16:30,240 --> 02:16:31,240
That was better than anything.

2889
02:16:31,240 --> 02:16:32,240
That's my favorite.

2890
02:16:32,240 --> 02:16:36,800
The creepers are a metaphor for incest.

2891
02:16:36,800 --> 02:16:37,800
Soundtrack by Bjork.

2892
02:16:37,800 --> 02:16:38,800
And she's just crying.

2893
02:16:38,800 --> 02:16:39,800
Bjork crying.

2894
02:16:39,800 --> 02:16:44,320
Isn't that already a Bjork album?

2895
02:16:44,320 --> 02:16:49,960
No, it's like Bjork's beatboxing album is Minecraft.

2896
02:16:49,960 --> 02:17:00,040
You know, it is morning and everything is precious.

2897
02:17:00,040 --> 02:17:01,040
Minecraft two.

2898
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:02,840
Bye.

2899
02:17:02,840 --> 02:17:03,840
Bye.

2900
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:06,240
Thank you for blessing the show with your presence.

2901
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:07,240
I appreciate it.

2902
02:17:07,240 --> 02:17:08,240
All right.

2903
02:17:08,240 --> 02:17:10,080
And not just because it's our five year anniversary.

2904
02:17:10,080 --> 02:17:11,080
All right.

2905
02:17:11,080 --> 02:17:12,080
Now you too.

2906
02:17:12,080 --> 02:17:13,080
All right.

2907
02:17:13,080 --> 02:17:16,320
Let's get to the mailbag every week.

2908
02:17:16,320 --> 02:17:17,400
You guys send us emails.

2909
02:17:17,400 --> 02:17:21,280
Now it's your chance to take over the show for a little bit.

2910
02:17:21,280 --> 02:17:23,000
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

2911
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:27,840
If you want to participate with our mailbag segment, again, that's participate at orangelaungeradio.com

2912
02:17:27,840 --> 02:17:30,960
where you can send your emails and dark soccer will dive into the mailbag head.

2913
02:17:30,960 --> 02:17:38,200
First and find the email finds the emails that she believes are worthy of reading on

2914
02:17:38,200 --> 02:17:39,600
the show tonight.

2915
02:17:39,600 --> 02:17:40,600
Dark soccer.

2916
02:17:40,600 --> 02:17:42,640
What is in the mailbag?

2917
02:17:42,640 --> 02:17:48,440
First one comes from Robert M. I can't really give a proper top three since most of my leisure

2918
02:17:48,440 --> 02:17:51,800
time lately seems to be watching let's play videos and trying to sleep.

2919
02:17:51,800 --> 02:17:54,800
But here's what comes to my, this sounds like my husband.

2920
02:17:54,800 --> 02:17:58,800
Best 2003 13 steam purchase rogue legacy 2013.

2921
02:17:58,800 --> 02:17:59,800
Okay.

2922
02:17:59,800 --> 02:18:00,800
Yeah.

2923
02:18:00,800 --> 02:18:05,120
I'm glad I finally tricked this one out even though I still haven't made it much further

2924
02:18:05,120 --> 02:18:06,120
than the first boss.

2925
02:18:06,120 --> 02:18:10,760
It runs great for me except some more visually demanding traits like nearsighted or nostalgic

2926
02:18:10,760 --> 02:18:13,040
on my 2009 Mac book.

2927
02:18:13,040 --> 02:18:15,400
Gaming on a Mac.

2928
02:18:15,400 --> 02:18:17,800
Y'all shut up.

2929
02:18:17,800 --> 02:18:22,560
Smartest early access zombie survival strategy unturned.

2930
02:18:22,560 --> 02:18:28,360
In a store crammed with such titles, the Canadian roadblocks originated unturned with its simplistic

2931
02:18:28,360 --> 02:18:33,560
look, making it stand out and run on more systems than the more realistic looking games

2932
02:18:33,560 --> 02:18:39,160
only asked an entirely optional $5 for bonus content as opposed to the usual 20 to 40.

2933
02:18:39,160 --> 02:18:43,040
Its current build still doesn't always run great on my laptop though.

2934
02:18:43,040 --> 02:18:45,080
And then what am I doing with my life?

2935
02:18:45,080 --> 02:18:47,020
Smash champs for mobile.

2936
02:18:47,020 --> 02:18:53,760
This game is explicitly a rip off or a take on of, um, a competitive fruit ninja where

2937
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:58,240
you go training, uh, where you, what, Oh, nevermind.

2938
02:18:58,240 --> 02:19:03,640
I was misreading it with you training, fighting animal characters, but I can't seem to stop

2939
02:19:03,640 --> 02:19:06,120
clicking in to take my turns.

2940
02:19:06,120 --> 02:19:09,720
It has this charm, but it's, uh, but it's not certainly one I would put on a proper

2941
02:19:09,720 --> 02:19:11,460
game of the year list.

2942
02:19:11,460 --> 02:19:17,960
Certainly not next to threes and uh, monument valley and that's from Robert M. All right.

2943
02:19:17,960 --> 02:19:21,000
Those are, that was a kind of a creative way of doing a top three.

2944
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Appreciate that.

2945
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:23,000
Yep.

2946
02:19:23,240 --> 02:19:23,760
All right.

2947
02:19:23,760 --> 02:19:25,320
Um, next up.

2948
02:19:25,320 --> 02:19:26,320
Yep.

2949
02:19:27,560 --> 02:19:32,920
Hello, well, our it's cool that balloon fight came up as a classic game of the week, but

2950
02:19:32,920 --> 02:19:36,680
other than tons of virtual console and related releases, it seems you guys believe nothing

2951
02:19:36,680 --> 02:19:39,040
else has been done with the franchise.

2952
02:19:39,040 --> 02:19:43,540
I guess none of you played a wonderful Nintendo land on Wii U because if you had, you'd certainly

2953
02:19:43,540 --> 02:19:45,040
have remembered balloon trip breeze.

2954
02:19:45,040 --> 02:19:46,600
I did not play.

2955
02:19:46,600 --> 02:19:48,600
I forgot.

2956
02:19:48,600 --> 02:19:50,560
Like a lot of Nintendo land side.

2957
02:19:50,560 --> 02:19:51,560
I, I forgot.

2958
02:19:51,560 --> 02:19:52,560
Sorry.

2959
02:19:53,120 --> 02:19:54,120
I don't have a Wii U.

2960
02:19:54,120 --> 02:19:56,880
It wasn't as strong of a launch title as Wii sports, just saying.

2961
02:19:56,880 --> 02:19:57,880
That's right.

2962
02:19:57,880 --> 02:19:58,880
Now that he's saying that.

2963
02:19:58,880 --> 02:19:59,880
Oh yeah, duh.

2964
02:19:59,880 --> 02:20:01,260
That was a, that was a thing in Nintendo land.

2965
02:20:01,260 --> 02:20:02,800
It's a high good observation.

2966
02:20:02,800 --> 02:20:06,440
It's a high definition re-imagining of the classic one player endurance test featuring

2967
02:20:06,440 --> 02:20:10,600
23 stages of challenging game play and charming visuals.

2968
02:20:10,600 --> 02:20:14,800
There are items to collect and it means to battle and of course balloons to pop.

2969
02:20:14,800 --> 02:20:15,920
It's really great.

2970
02:20:15,920 --> 02:20:20,000
And one of the many reasons that anyone with Wii U should track down a cheap used copy

2971
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:25,720
of Nintendo land, but not worth it finding a new un-purchased copy, right?

2972
02:20:25,720 --> 02:20:26,720
No.

2973
02:20:26,720 --> 02:20:31,280
Um, also because I didn't get in the top games of the year thing, I wanted to mention two

2974
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:35,680
indie games that are my top three of 2014 but slipped under the radar for most people.

2975
02:20:35,680 --> 02:20:42,160
Bike Rider DX2 Galaxy on Nintendo 3DS is a sequel to 2013's most popular Japanese e-shop

2976
02:20:42,160 --> 02:20:43,160
download.

2977
02:20:43,160 --> 02:20:46,560
It's a very simple game where you move forward automatically, press A to jump and try to

2978
02:20:46,560 --> 02:20:48,020
reach the goal.

2979
02:20:48,020 --> 02:20:51,780
There are also pickups that allow you to float, fly, glide, drill through rocks, and more.

2980
02:20:51,780 --> 02:20:56,540
So it's Rainbow Unicorn Attack, or Robot Unicorn Attack.

2981
02:20:56,540 --> 02:21:00,620
Any game developer should take note that it's basically a clinic on both level design and

2982
02:21:00,620 --> 02:21:05,060
how to introduce new gameplay features throughout a game's levels, of which it has many.

2983
02:21:05,060 --> 02:21:09,620
It costs a whopping $2.99 and if anyone listening to this downloads it and winds up hating it,

2984
02:21:09,620 --> 02:21:11,660
I will pay them back.

2985
02:21:11,660 --> 02:21:13,040
Really?

2986
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:16,940
It's the best value on the e-shop and one of the 3DS's best games.

2987
02:21:16,940 --> 02:21:20,480
And then TXK is Jeff Minter's latest game.

2988
02:21:20,480 --> 02:21:24,780
If you don't know what it is, I will say that it's a perfectly tuned version of Tempest

2989
02:21:24,780 --> 02:21:28,060
2000 from the creator of Space Giraffe.

2990
02:21:28,060 --> 02:21:31,980
If you don't know what either of those are, I'll just say that if you like arcade style

2991
02:21:31,980 --> 02:21:36,580
shooting, hard and fast electronic music, and pretty visuals, then grab a Vita, drop

2992
02:21:36,580 --> 02:21:40,540
ten bucks on this game and turn off the lights, plug in some good headphones, and feed your

2993
02:21:40,540 --> 02:21:43,420
head to a hundred levels of bliss.

2994
02:21:43,420 --> 02:21:49,100
I hadn't realized that it came out until it was released as a PS Plus download in October,

2995
02:21:49,100 --> 02:21:51,380
and then quickly bought it before it became free.

2996
02:21:51,380 --> 02:21:54,820
It was worth every cent, plus way more, and now is the best gaming experience I've had

2997
02:21:54,820 --> 02:21:56,140
in 2014.

2998
02:21:56,140 --> 02:22:00,500
If you don't own a Vita, but do own or will own a PS4, it's coming next year.

2999
02:22:00,500 --> 02:22:06,540
A VoG Jam Jam Reggae YYR.

3000
02:22:06,540 --> 02:22:07,540
I like that.

3001
02:22:07,540 --> 02:22:08,540
VoG Jam Jam Reggae.

3002
02:22:08,540 --> 02:22:09,540
Yay!

3003
02:22:09,540 --> 02:22:10,540
Good, some good picks!

3004
02:22:10,540 --> 02:22:11,860
I like that.

3005
02:22:11,860 --> 02:22:13,260
Okay.

3006
02:22:13,300 --> 02:22:20,140
And this one here is from Andy R. Let me move a bit.

3007
02:22:20,140 --> 02:22:23,660
Just chiming in with my picks for favorite games last year.

3008
02:22:23,660 --> 02:22:27,900
Three, Altilier, Escha, and Loggy.

3009
02:22:27,900 --> 02:22:31,420
I'm a huge fan of the series in general, but this entry especially grabbed me.

3010
02:22:31,420 --> 02:22:34,940
The combat has always been refined from the previous entries.

3011
02:22:34,940 --> 02:22:38,820
And the alchemy system, one of the big draws of the series, is especially engaging thanks

3012
02:22:38,820 --> 02:22:42,900
to a focus on using skills and abilities during the alchemy rather than the ingredient focus

3013
02:22:42,940 --> 02:22:45,620
system of some of the past games.

3014
02:22:45,620 --> 02:22:51,660
Two, Tales of Hearts R. Just a wonderful game, the combat is fast and fun, with a system

3015
02:22:51,660 --> 02:22:55,660
that lets you ping pong enemies all over the battlefield if you're good.

3016
02:22:55,660 --> 02:22:57,980
I also really enjoyed the characters.

3017
02:22:57,980 --> 02:23:01,900
I was happy that the game actually went full bore on the romance, something a lot of JRPGs

3018
02:23:01,900 --> 02:23:04,260
seem to leave in the implied area.

3019
02:23:04,260 --> 02:23:09,100
One, Guilty Gear XRD.

3020
02:23:09,100 --> 02:23:12,820
Only just came out in December, but I love it already.

3021
02:23:12,860 --> 02:23:17,740
And I've been a fan of this series for a while, but Absence really made the heart grow fonder.

3022
02:23:17,740 --> 02:23:23,420
It's been forever since we had a proper sequel, pretty much since the PS2, as the only PS3

3023
02:23:23,420 --> 02:23:26,060
release, was a port with a few balance changes.

3024
02:23:26,060 --> 02:23:30,100
And this game kicks the franchise back into gear, haha, in a major way.

3025
02:23:30,100 --> 02:23:33,740
For the last few games, if I'm not playing this game, I'm probably thinking about this

3026
02:23:33,740 --> 02:23:34,740
game.

3027
02:23:34,740 --> 02:23:36,140
For the last few weeks, sorry.

3028
02:23:36,140 --> 02:23:39,860
Also one disappointment, Super Smash Brothers on the 3DS.

3029
02:23:39,860 --> 02:23:41,540
Not the Wii U, that version is fine.

3030
02:23:41,580 --> 02:23:46,660
I really don't feel the 3DS version, it feels incredibly subpar compared to the Wii U version,

3031
02:23:46,660 --> 02:23:49,580
to the point where I almost sold it back to buy it on the Wii U.

3032
02:23:49,580 --> 02:23:53,460
It just feels like there's much less single player content, the main mode Smash Run is

3033
02:23:53,460 --> 02:23:55,980
just crap in my opinion.

3034
02:23:55,980 --> 02:24:01,180
And I've yet to play the 3DS version online with 4 people, and have the match not lag

3035
02:24:01,180 --> 02:24:02,460
a ton.

3036
02:24:02,460 --> 02:24:04,780
Like everyone is moving at half speed lag.

3037
02:24:04,780 --> 02:24:09,100
As I've said, Wii U version is good, although obviously not one of my top 3, just the 3DS

3038
02:24:09,100 --> 02:24:11,100
version feels like a waste of 40 bucks.

3039
02:24:11,140 --> 02:24:13,300
Thanks and have a happy new year, Andy R.

3040
02:24:13,300 --> 02:24:16,940
I get the sense that Andy R kinda likes JRPGs a little bit.

3041
02:24:16,940 --> 02:24:17,940
No.

3042
02:24:17,940 --> 02:24:18,940
No.

3043
02:24:18,940 --> 02:24:19,940
You don't say.

3044
02:24:19,940 --> 02:24:20,940
No, thanks for the email though.

3045
02:24:20,940 --> 02:24:21,940
Appreciate it.

3046
02:24:21,940 --> 02:24:22,940
Heyyyyy.

3047
02:24:22,940 --> 02:24:24,940
Sorry, no one saw the hand move, open.

3048
02:24:24,940 --> 02:24:26,940
Um, hola.

3049
02:24:26,940 --> 02:24:28,940
This is your friendly neighborhood Mexican act-deafed.

3050
02:24:28,940 --> 02:24:29,940
Hola.

3051
02:24:29,940 --> 02:24:30,940
Hi.

3052
02:24:30,940 --> 02:24:36,020
I wanted to participate in last week's show, but it has some stuff to do, but I wanted

3053
02:24:36,020 --> 02:24:38,780
to weigh in with my picks for best games of 2014.

3054
02:24:38,860 --> 02:24:42,820
I will try to make this short, but sorry if gush for some of them.

3055
02:24:42,820 --> 02:24:47,660
I will, however, not rank them in top 3, but rather best games based in my experience with

3056
02:24:47,660 --> 02:24:48,660
them.

3057
02:24:48,660 --> 02:24:50,900
Sleeper Hit of the Year, Lethal League.

3058
02:24:50,900 --> 02:24:55,700
This game combines a simple game like Pong at Smash Brothers Mechanics and Jet Set Radio's

3059
02:24:55,700 --> 02:24:58,380
style and gives us a really fun game.

3060
02:24:58,380 --> 02:25:02,260
I think it's only on Steam right now, got it during the sale, but hopefully it does

3061
02:25:02,260 --> 02:25:05,940
get a console release since this game deserves everyone's attention.

3062
02:25:05,980 --> 02:25:11,140
The Does of the Year, or my obvious picks, Smash Brothers 3DS slash Wii U, Mario Kart

3063
02:25:11,140 --> 02:25:15,420
8, Bayonetta 1 and 2, all Wii U I know, but in consideration of what the other consoles

3064
02:25:15,420 --> 02:25:19,220
had to offer, Nintendo offered all I wanted.

3065
02:25:19,220 --> 02:25:20,220
Surprises of the Year.

3066
02:25:20,220 --> 02:25:22,020
First, Captain Toad Treasure Tracker.

3067
02:25:22,020 --> 02:25:25,840
I love the Captain Toad levels in Super Mario 3D World, but I was worried that the Treasure

3068
02:25:25,840 --> 02:25:28,300
Tracker wasn't going to be that great.

3069
02:25:28,300 --> 02:25:33,260
I was surprised that they gave lots of life of a somewhat simple concept.

3070
02:25:33,260 --> 02:25:34,260
It's really awesome.

3071
02:25:34,660 --> 02:25:35,660
Second, Hearthstone.

3072
02:25:35,660 --> 02:25:39,700
Granted, I don't play a lot, but that game is really well done and quite entertaining.

3073
02:25:39,700 --> 02:25:42,100
I seriously cannot wait for the Android version.

3074
02:25:42,100 --> 02:25:46,060
And finally, my game of 2014 is Shovel Knight.

3075
02:25:46,060 --> 02:25:47,060
That game is freaking amazing!

3076
02:25:47,060 --> 02:25:48,060
Those are all in caps.

3077
02:25:48,060 --> 02:25:49,060
Those are all in caps.

3078
02:25:49,060 --> 02:25:51,380
It is a great game.

3079
02:25:51,380 --> 02:25:52,380
It's near perfection.

3080
02:25:52,380 --> 02:25:57,700
Many complain about not being fresh and the game being short, but that's what makes it

3081
02:25:57,700 --> 02:25:58,700
good for me.

3082
02:25:58,700 --> 02:26:02,020
It's everything great from the NES era and put into a single game.

3083
02:26:02,020 --> 02:26:06,300
That game offers replayability by giving us achievements, new games plus, and tons

3084
02:26:06,300 --> 02:26:07,300
of cheats.

3085
02:26:07,300 --> 02:26:10,700
I own the game on Wii U, 3DS, and Steam, and I'll purchase the Playstation version when

3086
02:26:10,700 --> 02:26:11,840
it comes out.

3087
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:17,060
This is my Mass Effect slash Grand Theft Auto, but it's definitely worth the money I'm throwing

3088
02:26:17,060 --> 02:26:21,060
to Yacht Club games, and the hype is definitely there.

3089
02:26:21,060 --> 02:26:22,060
And the music.

3090
02:26:22,060 --> 02:26:23,060
By God, the music.

3091
02:26:23,060 --> 02:26:24,060
It was really good.

3092
02:26:24,060 --> 02:26:25,700
Well, that's it for me.

3093
02:26:25,700 --> 02:26:27,420
There were a lot of good games in 2014.

3094
02:26:27,420 --> 02:26:31,980
Hopefully 2015 can live up to the hype with Amplitude Mighty No. 9, Overwatch, Splatoon,

3095
02:26:31,980 --> 02:26:38,180
and Zelda, and all the other games that may come and may even not know about.

3096
02:26:38,180 --> 02:26:42,020
Until next time, Deft is Ka-Brown.

3097
02:26:42,020 --> 02:26:43,020
Great email.

3098
02:26:43,020 --> 02:26:44,020
Good list.

3099
02:26:44,020 --> 02:26:45,020
Yes.

3100
02:26:45,020 --> 02:26:46,020
And the last.

3101
02:26:46,020 --> 02:26:47,020
The last.

3102
02:26:47,020 --> 02:26:48,020
The last.

3103
02:26:48,020 --> 02:26:49,020
The final.

3104
02:26:49,020 --> 02:26:51,680
Hey, OLR crew, and Happy New Year to all.

3105
02:26:51,680 --> 02:26:54,660
By the way, this comes from AZHP, by the way.

3106
02:26:54,660 --> 02:27:00,300
AZHP here, done with, sorry, with a yearly reminder for all the OLR me to check out Awesome

3107
02:27:00,300 --> 02:27:06,300
Games Done Quick, which we mentioned during last segment, the last part.

3108
02:27:06,300 --> 02:27:08,860
It started this morning and runs until Saturday.

3109
02:27:08,860 --> 02:27:12,380
Speed gamers from all over the globe have gathered in Washington, D.C. to raise money

3110
02:27:12,380 --> 02:27:17,580
for the Prevent Cancer Foundation, which you should always, always look for anything other

3111
02:27:17,580 --> 02:27:22,700
than the Susan G. Komen Foundation for your cancer donations, because Komen is evil.

3112
02:27:22,700 --> 02:27:24,060
Okay, right.

3113
02:27:24,060 --> 02:27:25,780
Moving on.

3114
02:27:25,780 --> 02:27:28,900
Last year, they raised over $1 million throughout the week.

3115
02:27:28,900 --> 02:27:34,180
They already topped $100,000 today, and not counting donations, but that counts from going

3116
02:27:34,180 --> 02:27:38,820
through the different store things, so not the individual contributions.

3117
02:27:38,820 --> 02:27:43,500
It's been less than 12 hours and they've already raised $125,000.

3118
02:27:43,500 --> 02:27:46,700
It's pretty crazy, but let's try and break last year's record and make this the most

3119
02:27:46,700 --> 02:27:50,660
successful charity marathon yet and prove that gamers can do good sometimes.

3120
02:27:50,660 --> 02:27:52,300
Yours truly, AZHP.

3121
02:27:52,300 --> 02:27:53,300
P.S.

3122
02:27:53,300 --> 02:27:58,380
The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time run record was broken earlier this week by Joden Stone,

3123
02:27:58,380 --> 02:28:05,340
who beat Cosmo's record of 18.10 by 3 seconds to bring it to an exceptionally low 18.07.

3124
02:28:05,340 --> 02:28:12,100
People are estimating that an absolutely perfect run could reach 17.59, so it's ridiculously

3125
02:28:12,100 --> 02:28:13,900
optimized.

3126
02:28:13,900 --> 02:28:19,060
And this guy got into speed running only two years after watching AGQD 2013, so it's never

3127
02:28:19,060 --> 02:28:20,300
too late to get into the game.

3128
02:28:20,300 --> 02:28:21,300
Who knows?

3129
02:28:21,300 --> 02:28:22,300
You could be a world record holder someday, too.

3130
02:28:22,300 --> 02:28:23,300
That's right.

3131
02:28:23,300 --> 02:28:28,140
The record, the Banjo one that they did today, only missed the record by four seconds.

3132
02:28:28,140 --> 02:28:29,140
Oh, wow.

3133
02:28:29,140 --> 02:28:30,140
Yeah.

3134
02:28:30,140 --> 02:28:31,900
It was a really, really solid run.

3135
02:28:31,900 --> 02:28:32,900
That's awesome.

3136
02:28:32,900 --> 02:28:36,220
And it's funny, AZHP took my last story, because I was going to tell you guys about this.

3137
02:28:36,220 --> 02:28:39,140
It was on my list of things to tell you about tonight anyway.

3138
02:28:39,140 --> 02:28:43,700
They pick a really good time of year to do it because they can get a lot of coverage

3139
02:28:43,700 --> 02:28:47,140
because there's not a lot of other gaming news going on this year, so this is a great

3140
02:28:47,140 --> 02:28:48,580
thing to be reporting on.

3141
02:28:48,580 --> 02:28:51,620
So I guess the only other thing I would add to this that AZHP didn't already say in his

3142
02:28:51,620 --> 02:28:56,300
email is that there is a Humble Bundle to go along with this, and it had come up a little

3143
02:28:56,300 --> 02:28:57,660
earlier in the show.

3144
02:28:57,660 --> 02:29:02,340
So another way, and they're sending all their money that they make on this Humble Bundle,

3145
02:29:02,340 --> 02:29:04,780
you know, with the tips and all that.

3146
02:29:04,780 --> 02:29:08,780
You can just choose to have all your money go to that same Prevent Cancer Foundation,

3147
02:29:08,780 --> 02:29:10,340
which is really cool.

3148
02:29:10,340 --> 02:29:12,540
You can choose how the money is split.

3149
02:29:12,540 --> 02:29:18,420
Just to throw out there, the stuff that you get for free, Duke Nukem 3D Megaton Edition,

3150
02:29:18,420 --> 02:29:25,060
Shadow Warrior Classic Redo, Oddworld Abe's Odyssey, Volgar the Viking, and then for $6,

3151
02:29:25,060 --> 02:29:30,020
there's a Twitch Turbo subscription, Shantae Risky Revenge Director's Cut, Speedrunner's

3152
02:29:30,020 --> 02:29:34,900
Early Access, how appropriate for this, and Speedrunner's YouTuber packs.

3153
02:29:34,900 --> 02:29:40,780
And then lastly, $10 or more will get you a scapegoat 2 and an XSplit premium 3-month

3154
02:29:40,780 --> 02:29:41,780
subscription.

3155
02:29:41,780 --> 02:29:46,020
You can also, if you're willing to toss in $30, there's like t-shirts, buttons, stickers,

3156
02:29:46,020 --> 02:29:50,380
a lot of extra stuff with that as well, so lots and lots and lots of good stuff there

3157
02:29:50,380 --> 02:29:53,860
that you can also help contribute to the same charity.

3158
02:29:53,860 --> 02:29:57,500
Even though I don't think this money counts towards what they're tabulating on their Twitch

3159
02:29:57,500 --> 02:30:02,580
channel, I'm not sure if it's all together, but certainly still counts.

3160
02:30:02,580 --> 02:30:06,500
They're doing great stuff with that charity, so props to them.

3161
02:30:06,500 --> 02:30:10,020
And fuck cancer, I think very important to say.

3162
02:30:10,020 --> 02:30:11,020
Fuck cancer.

3163
02:30:11,020 --> 02:30:12,020
All right.

3164
02:30:12,020 --> 02:30:15,040
This is your last call to vote in tonight's List List.

3165
02:30:15,080 --> 02:30:18,000
Get your points by voting in tonight's List List now.

3166
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:23,400
This is your last chance, last call for List List votes, live.vognetwork.com.

3167
02:30:23,400 --> 02:30:27,800
You only have about a minute and a half left because it, well, maybe five minutes, depending

3168
02:30:27,800 --> 02:30:29,120
on how this segment goes tonight.

3169
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:32,560
It is time for the FUs of the Week.

3170
02:30:45,040 --> 02:30:48,400
This is fucked up.

3171
02:30:48,400 --> 02:30:53,400
I had something I was really angry about earlier today, but I don't remember what it is.

3172
02:30:53,400 --> 02:31:02,520
So FU two days off not having an extra four hours each day, and my days on being short

3173
02:31:02,520 --> 02:31:03,520
four hours.

3174
02:31:03,520 --> 02:31:06,560
They should just move those around.

3175
02:31:06,560 --> 02:31:10,000
Come on, doctor, change time and space for me.

3176
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:11,000
That's a fair request.

3177
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:12,920
Loki, your FU of the Week.

3178
02:31:12,920 --> 02:31:14,760
I guess FV did.

3179
02:31:14,760 --> 02:31:19,720
Children that don't sleep because our son was up for like three hours last night.

3180
02:31:19,720 --> 02:31:20,720
So that's fun.

3181
02:31:20,720 --> 02:31:23,040
And also my new schedule is kind of weird.

3182
02:31:23,040 --> 02:31:28,160
I have to go in an hour and 45 minutes or hour and 15 minutes later in the morning.

3183
02:31:28,160 --> 02:31:30,160
So I don't know how that's going to work.

3184
02:31:30,160 --> 02:31:34,280
I just know there's going to be more traffic both to and from work.

3185
02:31:34,280 --> 02:31:35,280
So that's kind of lame.

3186
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:36,280
Yeah.

3187
02:31:36,280 --> 02:31:37,280
Tomorrow's going to be a crappy.

3188
02:31:37,280 --> 02:31:38,480
And my lunch is 15 minutes shorter.

3189
02:31:38,480 --> 02:31:42,720
So it's like, yeah, everybody goes back to work tomorrow.

3190
02:31:42,720 --> 02:31:44,280
So it's going to be a really crappy commute.

3191
02:31:44,800 --> 02:31:45,800
So good luck, everybody.

3192
02:31:45,800 --> 02:31:46,800
That's why I'm going to leave early.

3193
02:31:46,800 --> 02:31:47,800
There you go.

3194
02:31:47,800 --> 02:31:49,320
That's why I'm glad Monday's my day off.

3195
02:31:49,320 --> 02:31:50,320
Lucky you.

3196
02:31:50,320 --> 02:31:52,320
And I live eight minutes from work.

3197
02:31:52,320 --> 02:31:53,320
Right.

3198
02:31:53,320 --> 02:31:58,720
Well, the FU for me is that FU to having to go back to work tomorrow and it's just been

3199
02:31:58,720 --> 02:32:02,440
very exhausting lately, but at least have Seattle look forward to in a couple of weeks.

3200
02:32:02,440 --> 02:32:05,040
I've got to make the money somehow.

3201
02:32:05,040 --> 02:32:10,680
So FU to deadlines that sneak up on you out of nowhere.

3202
02:32:10,680 --> 02:32:11,680
That's my other.

3203
02:32:11,680 --> 02:32:12,680
I do have another one.

3204
02:32:12,680 --> 02:32:13,680
All right, fine.

3205
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:16,960
Is everyone having the plague for my new year's party, Rob?

3206
02:32:16,960 --> 02:32:21,520
Hey, look, blame the Chinese food I ate on not only Sunday, but Tuesday.

3207
02:32:21,520 --> 02:32:23,520
It didn't make me sick and Dan finished mine off.

3208
02:32:23,520 --> 02:32:28,000
I think it was it was just that my stomach was already kind of because I ate a lot of

3209
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:29,000
that.

3210
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:34,800
But then I made eight Panda Express on Tuesday and that I see you've had overload.

3211
02:32:34,800 --> 02:32:35,800
The end.

3212
02:32:35,800 --> 02:32:36,800
Yeah.

3213
02:32:36,800 --> 02:32:37,800
Over by the way.

3214
02:32:37,800 --> 02:32:38,800
Fifth dream.

3215
02:32:38,800 --> 02:32:39,800
I got your fun link and I'm going to watch it when I get home.

3216
02:32:39,800 --> 02:32:40,800
It's fake Bjork.

3217
02:32:40,800 --> 02:32:41,800
Oh God.

3218
02:32:41,800 --> 02:32:43,040
All right.

3219
02:32:43,400 --> 02:32:52,120
So it is time, everybody, to get the definitive list that you guys have all voted on tonight.

3220
02:32:52,120 --> 02:32:53,120
That's right.

3221
02:32:53,120 --> 02:32:54,120
We have tabulated the votes.

3222
02:32:54,120 --> 02:32:56,920
And yes, I actually have the votes tonight.

3223
02:32:56,920 --> 02:33:02,480
We have tabulated your votes and we have your answers for the definitive list.

3224
02:33:02,480 --> 02:33:03,480
Here it is.

3225
02:33:03,480 --> 02:33:06,480
The official O.L.R. 2015 predictions.

3226
02:33:06,480 --> 02:33:11,520
Number three, Microsoft announces Minecraft two.

3227
02:33:11,520 --> 02:33:14,720
Microsoft announces Minecraft two is the number three winner.

3228
02:33:14,720 --> 02:33:19,560
And for number two tonight, we have a tie O.M.G.

3229
02:33:19,560 --> 02:33:21,400
It's a tie for the number two answer.

3230
02:33:21,400 --> 02:33:29,600
Number two answer is yet another 3DS skew and punishing silence from Valve on anything

3231
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:32,480
but financials is the number two.

3232
02:33:32,480 --> 02:33:33,480
Yay.

3233
02:33:33,480 --> 02:33:34,480
Alan for tying twice.

3234
02:33:34,480 --> 02:33:35,480
There you go, Alan.

3235
02:33:35,480 --> 02:33:36,480
Alan tied with himself.

3236
02:33:36,480 --> 02:33:37,780
Tied himself.

3237
02:33:37,780 --> 02:33:38,960
There it is.

3238
02:33:38,960 --> 02:33:45,160
And the number one answer, and might I say a bit by a landslide, the number one answer

3239
02:33:45,160 --> 02:33:50,360
tonight for your top 2015 prediction.

3240
02:33:50,360 --> 02:33:56,000
One of those DDoS brats gets the death penalty is the official O.L.R.

3241
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:57,000
Wishful thinking.

3242
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:01,360
See, aren't you glad I left that one alone?

3243
02:34:01,360 --> 02:34:07,040
I think it's a little bit of wishful thinking on everybody's part there.

3244
02:34:07,120 --> 02:34:12,560
It's just taking that off because no one would have voted for Konami being sold, so damn.

3245
02:34:12,560 --> 02:34:15,320
You need to strategize a little better next time.

3246
02:34:15,320 --> 02:34:16,800
So there it is.

3247
02:34:16,800 --> 02:34:21,400
The death penalty coming to one of those DDoS brats in 2014.

3248
02:34:21,400 --> 02:34:24,200
Ah, love it, love it, love it.

3249
02:34:24,200 --> 02:34:25,200
All right.

3250
02:34:25,200 --> 02:34:27,240
Thank you guys for participating with that.

3251
02:34:27,240 --> 02:34:28,380
That was a lot of fun.

3252
02:34:28,380 --> 02:34:33,020
And just like we did this year, assuming this show is still going next year, I don't see

3253
02:34:33,020 --> 02:34:34,060
why it wouldn't be.

3254
02:34:34,100 --> 02:34:38,580
We will revisit these predictions and see how far we've come.

3255
02:34:38,580 --> 02:34:40,220
All right.

3256
02:34:40,220 --> 02:34:41,220
There it is.

3257
02:34:41,220 --> 02:34:42,660
Nobody going for the dark answer.

3258
02:34:42,660 --> 02:34:46,660
Like Alan Alkley brought up kind of a darker answer and interesting.

3259
02:34:46,660 --> 02:34:47,660
And people not doing...

3260
02:34:47,660 --> 02:34:51,260
I would have thought the Dragon Age Inquisition is a very safe bet, but nobody opting...

3261
02:34:51,260 --> 02:34:53,940
Well, it was on the board, but it was a little low.

3262
02:34:53,940 --> 02:34:54,940
So yeah.

3263
02:34:54,940 --> 02:34:55,940
There you go.

3264
02:34:55,940 --> 02:34:56,940
All right.

3265
02:34:56,940 --> 02:34:58,180
I just think no one cares anymore.

3266
02:34:58,180 --> 02:35:02,580
At least no one cares to follow the whole, you know, gate problems.

3267
02:35:02,580 --> 02:35:03,580
The ethics stuff.

3268
02:35:04,100 --> 02:35:06,100
Let's just leave all that fuckery in 2014.

3269
02:35:06,100 --> 02:35:12,900
Occasionally I'll go into, was it the subreddit that was a Kotaku in action that follows that

3270
02:35:12,900 --> 02:35:13,900
kind of stuff.

3271
02:35:13,900 --> 02:35:14,900
Fuck, I'm sorry.

3272
02:35:14,900 --> 02:35:15,900
Well, no, no.

3273
02:35:15,900 --> 02:35:16,900
That's what they just call it.

3274
02:35:16,900 --> 02:35:17,900
It's, you know...

3275
02:35:17,900 --> 02:35:18,900
No, no.

3276
02:35:18,900 --> 02:35:19,900
I know, but I'm still saying I'm sorry.

3277
02:35:19,900 --> 02:35:22,580
And it's just, it's just ridiculous stuff.

3278
02:35:22,580 --> 02:35:27,700
And it's, you know, like with Polygon and everything, I just, I don't read that site

3279
02:35:27,700 --> 02:35:33,180
anymore and they've just kind of gone in a different direction that I don't care to follow.

3280
02:35:33,180 --> 02:35:36,460
It's too much drama in, in game reporting, I guess.

3281
02:35:36,460 --> 02:35:41,380
In general, across the board, can we just leave being mean to each other in 2014?

3282
02:35:41,380 --> 02:35:43,100
Can we just leave that in 2014?

3283
02:35:43,100 --> 02:35:45,420
Like, I don't care.

3284
02:35:45,420 --> 02:35:49,260
Can we just leave the being mean to each other in 2014, please?

3285
02:35:49,260 --> 02:35:50,260
Please?

3286
02:35:50,260 --> 02:35:51,260
Thank you.

3287
02:35:51,260 --> 02:35:53,360
That should have been one of my answers.

3288
02:35:53,360 --> 02:35:55,980
People stop being fucking mean, but, oh yeah, it's the internet.

3289
02:35:55,980 --> 02:35:57,540
Oh, Rob, you're such a hippie.

3290
02:35:57,540 --> 02:35:59,340
Nobody's ever going to get along on the internet.

3291
02:35:59,340 --> 02:36:00,340
Can we...

3292
02:36:00,860 --> 02:36:06,100
I know, I'm saying, Black Wolf says 2015, I'm saying, can we leave the meanness in 2014?

3293
02:36:06,100 --> 02:36:11,060
Can we leave it behind and have 2015 be a year where people are like, oh, I don't know

3294
02:36:11,060 --> 02:36:16,580
civil and can have like actual debate without making it so fucking personal?

3295
02:36:16,580 --> 02:36:17,580
God.

3296
02:36:17,580 --> 02:36:18,580
All right.

3297
02:36:18,580 --> 02:36:22,300
Anyway, there it is.

3298
02:36:22,300 --> 02:36:24,340
Moving on.

3299
02:36:24,340 --> 02:36:28,420
Black Wolf says, no, leave it in 2015 and civility can be in 2016.

3300
02:36:28,420 --> 02:36:29,860
You are part of the problem, sir.

3301
02:36:29,860 --> 02:36:30,860
All right.

3302
02:36:30,860 --> 02:36:31,860
Just kidding.

3303
02:36:31,860 --> 02:36:34,460
Awesome Games Done Quick was going to be my last story, but seeing as we had an emailer

3304
02:36:34,460 --> 02:36:37,940
already report on that, I will just plug it again.

3305
02:36:37,940 --> 02:36:41,020
Check that out, you know, after this show is done, because you can always watch their

3306
02:36:41,020 --> 02:36:43,260
entire archive at any point.

3307
02:36:43,260 --> 02:36:50,020
Let's get into your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

3308
02:36:50,020 --> 02:36:51,260
Please give us a call.

3309
02:36:51,260 --> 02:36:54,940
You can talk about your predictions if you want, maybe something in the news that we

3310
02:36:54,940 --> 02:36:56,500
missed tonight.

3311
02:36:56,500 --> 02:36:59,420
Anything you want to talk about, the time is now to give us a call.

3312
02:36:59,420 --> 02:37:04,540
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

3313
02:37:04,540 --> 02:37:05,980
Let me check in anyway.

3314
02:37:05,980 --> 02:37:09,460
Loki, any last minute stories tonight or even Dark Sakura?

3315
02:37:09,460 --> 02:37:10,460
No.

3316
02:37:10,460 --> 02:37:12,100
I like pie.

3317
02:37:12,100 --> 02:37:14,820
I had a feeling pie is tonight's last minute story.

3318
02:37:14,820 --> 02:37:16,420
There it is.

3319
02:37:16,420 --> 02:37:20,500
While we wait and see if our Skype line lights up here, let me go to our Twitter at twitter.com

3320
02:37:20,500 --> 02:37:21,500
slash OLR.

3321
02:37:21,500 --> 02:37:26,420
I don't think we got a lot of like questions or discussion topics tonight, but we did get

3322
02:37:26,420 --> 02:37:30,620
like act deaf tweeted us, listening to at OLR and heard this was the classic game of

3323
02:37:30,620 --> 02:37:35,900
the week, taking a picture of his guitar room man there, which I retweeted and some people

3324
02:37:35,900 --> 02:37:37,700
fans of that as well.

3325
02:37:37,700 --> 02:37:40,780
Kamui, I'm totally going to mispronounce this name.

3326
02:37:40,780 --> 02:37:41,780
I'm so sorry.

3327
02:37:41,780 --> 02:37:44,900
Kamui Arikado says, awesome game.

3328
02:37:44,900 --> 02:37:45,900
Yes, I agree.

3329
02:37:45,900 --> 02:37:46,900
Awesome game.

3330
02:37:46,900 --> 02:37:49,860
Soutor says, I love this game on my PSP.

3331
02:37:49,860 --> 02:37:52,180
Awesome soundtrack for metal heads.

3332
02:37:52,700 --> 02:37:56,420
Soutor also saying, I totes agree.

3333
02:37:56,420 --> 02:37:57,420
I love that word.

3334
02:37:57,420 --> 02:37:58,420
Totes agree.

3335
02:37:58,420 --> 02:38:01,180
Good way to abbreviate totally on Twitter too.

3336
02:38:01,180 --> 02:38:04,420
Totes agree on Manly Tears and Edward Scissorhands.

3337
02:38:04,420 --> 02:38:05,420
Thank you.

3338
02:38:05,420 --> 02:38:06,420
Thank you.

3339
02:38:06,420 --> 02:38:08,340
It's a movie with sad parts.

3340
02:38:08,340 --> 02:38:09,860
It's a fairy tale for everybody.

3341
02:38:09,860 --> 02:38:10,860
All right.

3342
02:38:10,860 --> 02:38:15,220
I just realized that CES is coming up really soon.

3343
02:38:15,220 --> 02:38:16,220
It is.

3344
02:38:16,220 --> 02:38:18,420
It's like, I already have people that have left for Vegas to go.

3345
02:38:18,420 --> 02:38:19,900
I think it is like this coming week.

3346
02:38:19,900 --> 02:38:20,900
Is it next week?

3347
02:38:20,900 --> 02:38:21,900
I think it's next week.

3348
02:38:22,620 --> 02:38:24,460
Yeah, it's coming up real soon.

3349
02:38:24,460 --> 02:38:25,780
It's always right in the beginning of the year.

3350
02:38:25,780 --> 02:38:27,460
I would love to go.

3351
02:38:27,460 --> 02:38:30,900
It's just, I have a lot of trips coming up this year.

3352
02:38:30,900 --> 02:38:35,780
I guess I could have taken Alan to CES for an anniversary trip.

3353
02:38:35,780 --> 02:38:38,700
I'm like, oh, by the way, we're going to go to this convention that I'm going to write

3354
02:38:38,700 --> 02:38:42,420
about for VOC, but I guess vacation means vacation.

3355
02:38:42,420 --> 02:38:46,420
We're going to relax for a few days in Seattle and go to all the tourist traps.

3356
02:38:46,420 --> 02:38:47,420
Yay.

3357
02:38:47,420 --> 02:38:48,620
But we do have a call coming in, so let's get to it.

3358
02:38:48,620 --> 02:38:49,620
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

3359
02:38:49,620 --> 02:38:50,620
Who's this?

3360
02:38:52,620 --> 02:38:53,620
Hi, Aaron.

3361
02:38:53,620 --> 02:38:55,020
Hey, this is Regineer.

3362
02:38:55,020 --> 02:38:56,020
There you are.

3363
02:38:56,020 --> 02:38:57,020
Hey, buddy.

3364
02:38:57,020 --> 02:38:58,020
What's up?

3365
02:38:58,020 --> 02:38:59,020
Not much.

3366
02:38:59,020 --> 02:39:01,020
I'll have to make this call short and sweet.

3367
02:39:01,020 --> 02:39:02,020
That's fine.

3368
02:39:02,020 --> 02:39:03,780
I'm a little bit under the weather.

3369
02:39:03,780 --> 02:39:06,140
I've stopped packing my air for a minute.

3370
02:39:06,140 --> 02:39:07,140
Feel better.

3371
02:39:07,140 --> 02:39:08,860
Well, isn't it like below 30 out there?

3372
02:39:08,860 --> 02:39:12,820
It's like some ungodly degrees out there in the Northeast right now, isn't it?

3373
02:39:12,820 --> 02:39:13,820
I don't know.

3374
02:39:13,820 --> 02:39:16,500
I haven't been outside all day.

3375
02:39:16,500 --> 02:39:20,860
I've been mostly sleeping all day.

3376
02:39:20,860 --> 02:39:30,700
But anyway, both you and Bobby were mentioning both in chat and on the show that Capcom and

3377
02:39:30,700 --> 02:39:35,260
Konami really haven't been doing all that well financially speaking.

3378
02:39:35,260 --> 02:39:41,700
That being said, do you think it would behoove them to release some of the classic games?

3379
02:39:41,700 --> 02:39:42,700
No.

3380
02:39:42,700 --> 02:39:50,100
Not so much on consoles because they've been doing that all along, especially on Xbox Live

3381
02:39:50,100 --> 02:39:57,180
and PC, but at least on the PC space.

3382
02:39:57,180 --> 02:40:04,060
In all seriousness, we pick on Konami and Capcom a little bit because they're easy targets.

3383
02:40:04,060 --> 02:40:09,060
We all miss Mega Man and are a little irritated that Mega Man seemed to just kind of disappear

3384
02:40:09,060 --> 02:40:13,340
over on the Capcom side and that a lot of games in general seem to be disappearing over

3385
02:40:13,340 --> 02:40:14,340
there.

3386
02:40:14,340 --> 02:40:18,260
And then on the Konami side, a lot can be said similarly about, I don't know, the music

3387
02:40:18,260 --> 02:40:19,380
games, for one.

3388
02:40:19,380 --> 02:40:22,620
Castlevania, for another, has really seemed to fall on the wayside.

3389
02:40:22,620 --> 02:40:28,820
But in all seriousness, Konami still does have a very strong business in the casino

3390
02:40:28,820 --> 02:40:32,020
realm and a lot of the other things they do outside of gaming.

3391
02:40:32,020 --> 02:40:34,860
Pachinko, don't forget, is still a huge thing.

3392
02:40:34,860 --> 02:40:38,100
We don't see it here, but it's still a huge industry in other parts of the world.

3393
02:40:38,100 --> 02:40:42,540
Konami still does very well there.

3394
02:40:42,540 --> 02:40:46,060
As much as we joke about it here on the show, I don't necessarily really think that either

3395
02:40:46,060 --> 02:40:53,660
of those companies are going to just go under or fall belly up, but I still think acquisition

3396
02:40:53,660 --> 02:40:55,740
is not completely out of the picture.

3397
02:40:55,740 --> 02:41:00,380
I mean, sometimes these acquisitions happen and they kind of surprise us, so I never leave

3398
02:41:00,380 --> 02:41:01,880
that stone unturned.

3399
02:41:01,880 --> 02:41:08,180
That all being said, what you bring up about retro releases, especially on PC, well, you

3400
02:41:08,180 --> 02:41:12,140
know another Japanese company is having a lot of luck with it, it seems, and that's

3401
02:41:12,140 --> 02:41:13,420
Square Enix.

3402
02:41:13,420 --> 02:41:17,460
And it really seems that Square Enix has really made a push this year.

3403
02:41:17,460 --> 02:41:22,340
I never thought we would see Final Fantasy 13, nevertheless the whole trilogy, show up

3404
02:41:22,340 --> 02:41:23,580
on Steam.

3405
02:41:23,580 --> 02:41:30,540
And now it's not just PC, it's iOS and it's Android as well.

3406
02:41:30,540 --> 02:41:36,920
It's all of these mobile platforms where you're seeing Final Fantasy 3, 4, 5, 6, I mean you're

3407
02:41:36,920 --> 02:41:41,020
just seeing lots and lots of games in their archive that people really remember that they're

3408
02:41:41,020 --> 02:41:42,740
really pushing out there.

3409
02:41:42,740 --> 02:41:47,660
And as far as I know, doing pretty well with, I can't imagine those games are very expensive

3410
02:41:47,660 --> 02:41:51,040
to make because they've all been ports of other stuff.

3411
02:41:51,040 --> 02:41:54,860
So it can't be like that expensive for them to do.

3412
02:41:54,860 --> 02:41:57,620
So I would think they're doing pretty well with that.

3413
02:41:57,620 --> 02:42:02,640
So could Konami and Capcom be successful with a similar deal?

3414
02:42:02,640 --> 02:42:09,400
I would think so, especially, you know, just straight up ports of some of the NES classics.

3415
02:42:09,400 --> 02:42:14,860
Like I don't know, Gradius, Contra, I think a lot of people would end up buying iOS ports

3416
02:42:14,860 --> 02:42:19,460
of those, even if they're not even that good, because I still think, like how can you fucking

3417
02:42:19,460 --> 02:42:21,400
play Contra without a controller?

3418
02:42:21,400 --> 02:42:27,080
I don't know, but if somebody would spend the 99 cents to try and find out, it still

3419
02:42:27,080 --> 02:42:31,560
makes Konami a lot of money at the end of the day.

3420
02:42:31,560 --> 02:42:36,960
I don't see what there is to lose in those avenues, but that doesn't necessarily mean

3421
02:42:36,960 --> 02:42:38,800
they're going to explore it.

3422
02:42:38,800 --> 02:42:43,700
But I would think with Square Enix going down that path, maybe they'll follow.

3423
02:42:43,700 --> 02:42:49,700
But as far as all the Mega Man games on PC, I don't know about that one.

3424
02:42:49,700 --> 02:42:50,700
That might be a bit of a stretch.

3425
02:42:50,700 --> 02:42:54,620
There was a Mega Man game on PC years ago, though.

3426
02:42:54,620 --> 02:42:56,740
It had nothing to do with the rest of the Mega Man games.

3427
02:42:56,740 --> 02:43:01,180
It was like, it was like three bosses and a couple Wileys Castle.

3428
02:43:01,180 --> 02:43:02,180
I remember it.

3429
02:43:02,180 --> 02:43:03,500
It was like an old PC game.

3430
02:43:03,500 --> 02:43:04,860
You could play it in like CGA mode.

3431
02:43:04,860 --> 02:43:05,860
Oh, God.

3432
02:43:05,860 --> 02:43:06,860
Yeah.

3433
02:43:06,860 --> 02:43:07,860
Yeah.

3434
02:43:07,920 --> 02:43:08,920
It just kind of disappeared.

3435
02:43:08,920 --> 02:43:09,920
I bought that.

3436
02:43:09,920 --> 02:43:10,920
I did, too.

3437
02:43:10,920 --> 02:43:11,920
It was pretty awesome.

3438
02:43:11,920 --> 02:43:12,920
It ran like shit on my old computer.

3439
02:43:12,920 --> 02:43:13,920
That is true.

3440
02:43:13,920 --> 02:43:14,920
I can confirm it.

3441
02:43:14,920 --> 02:43:16,760
Maybe with a built-in DOS box.

3442
02:43:16,760 --> 02:43:19,100
That is a perfect candidate for GOG.

3443
02:43:19,100 --> 02:43:21,080
But would Capcom ever get involved in a site like that?

3444
02:43:21,080 --> 02:43:22,080
I don't know.

3445
02:43:22,080 --> 02:43:23,080
I don't know.

3446
02:43:23,080 --> 02:43:25,600
Yeah, I agree with you wholeheartedly.

3447
02:43:25,600 --> 02:43:30,680
I'm no programmer by any means, no.

3448
02:43:30,680 --> 02:43:39,220
Between me and everyone else on the bug community, probably Black Wolf knows probably the most

3449
02:43:39,220 --> 02:43:41,340
from what I can tell.

3450
02:43:41,340 --> 02:43:48,380
But even with that being said, I don't see re-releasing stuff on PC would be all that

3451
02:43:48,380 --> 02:43:49,380
hard.

3452
02:43:49,380 --> 02:44:00,500
And now that Council Lists can't play my previously purchased downloadable content, if the real

3453
02:44:01,320 --> 02:44:07,960
releases were available on Steam, I would buy that stuff up in Heartbeat.

3454
02:44:07,960 --> 02:44:09,200
You know me.

3455
02:44:09,200 --> 02:44:12,120
I buy games left and right.

3456
02:44:12,120 --> 02:44:13,120
Right.

3457
02:44:13,120 --> 02:44:16,120
Well, I think a lot of us do when it comes to Steam.

3458
02:44:16,120 --> 02:44:22,660
But anyway, again, as much as I don't think the entire Capcom, Mega Man, all eight games

3459
02:44:22,660 --> 02:44:25,840
are going to come out for PC any time soon, or really ten, I guess, ten games are going

3460
02:44:25,840 --> 02:44:28,520
to come out for PC any time soon.

3461
02:44:28,520 --> 02:44:33,580
Remember, DuckTales HD was a thing, and a lot of people really liked it.

3462
02:44:33,580 --> 02:44:36,140
And it did pretty good.

3463
02:44:36,140 --> 02:44:42,020
Maybe that is the ray of hope that we need as far as some of these retro titles go.

3464
02:44:42,020 --> 02:44:44,380
Just remember to buy this stuff if you like it.

3465
02:44:44,380 --> 02:44:47,860
Don't frickin' pirate it and all that stuff, and that's going to send a message that we

3466
02:44:47,860 --> 02:44:48,860
want more of it.

3467
02:44:48,860 --> 02:44:49,860
So, all right.

3468
02:44:49,860 --> 02:44:51,860
Well, RageNator, thanks for the call.

3469
02:44:51,860 --> 02:44:52,860
And my fingers are crossed.

3470
02:44:52,860 --> 02:44:55,180
I know you're a Steam fan and would like to see some of these classics on Steam.

3471
02:44:55,180 --> 02:44:56,180
I hope it happens.

3472
02:44:56,180 --> 02:44:57,180
Oh, definitely.

3473
02:44:57,840 --> 02:44:58,840
Well, have a good one.

3474
02:44:58,840 --> 02:44:59,840
All right?

3475
02:44:59,840 --> 02:45:00,840
You, too.

3476
02:45:00,840 --> 02:45:01,840
Feel better.

3477
02:45:01,840 --> 02:45:02,840
All right.

3478
02:45:02,840 --> 02:45:03,840
Thanks.

3479
02:45:03,840 --> 02:45:04,840
All right.

3480
02:45:04,840 --> 02:45:05,840
Bye.

3481
02:45:05,840 --> 02:45:06,840
TigerClanChat, Mega Man PC came out in 1990.

3482
02:45:06,840 --> 02:45:07,840
Let's see.

3483
02:45:07,840 --> 02:45:11,080
BlackWolf in chat says, I'm not a programmer, but I don't think making this old code not

3484
02:45:11,080 --> 02:45:15,240
made for current hardware, work on current hardware shouldn't be hard.

3485
02:45:15,240 --> 02:45:16,640
Newsflash, it's not easy.

3486
02:45:16,640 --> 02:45:22,560
Well, isn't it interesting that somebody put out an NES emulator on the iOS marketplace?

3487
02:45:22,560 --> 02:45:26,600
That was one of the stories we read last week, and it got taken down swiftly.

3488
02:45:27,020 --> 02:45:32,620
So, you know, it kind of depends on what level of a port they want to do.

3489
02:45:32,620 --> 02:45:33,620
Okay.

3490
02:45:33,620 --> 02:45:34,620
An emulator?

3491
02:45:34,620 --> 02:45:35,620
Sure, it's going to take a little more.

3492
02:45:35,620 --> 02:45:36,620
No, no, no.

3493
02:45:36,620 --> 02:45:41,060
I'll go with Mega Man PC not being able to run on, you know, on current PCs.

3494
02:45:41,060 --> 02:45:42,060
How about...

3495
02:45:42,060 --> 02:45:44,860
1-877-GAMO-LR, username on Skype, orange launch radio.

3496
02:45:44,860 --> 02:45:46,860
What about Mega Man 9 and Mega Man 10?

3497
02:45:46,860 --> 02:45:48,500
No, why not?

3498
02:45:48,500 --> 02:45:49,500
Those are more modern.

3499
02:45:49,500 --> 02:45:50,500
Yeah.

3500
02:45:50,500 --> 02:45:52,860
It should be a little bit easier, the port over, I would think.

3501
02:45:52,860 --> 02:45:53,860
I would think.

3502
02:45:53,860 --> 02:45:59,440
And then, you know, something like DuckTales HD especially takes a lot, a lot of work,

3503
02:45:59,440 --> 02:46:04,000
and any time they're going to go back and actually change textures, you know, you're

3504
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:09,200
talking about basically redoing the game in a new language, and so yeah, that's going

3505
02:46:09,200 --> 02:46:10,440
to take work.

3506
02:46:10,440 --> 02:46:16,480
So a lot more work than just the turning around of the other titles.

3507
02:46:16,480 --> 02:46:22,460
I think another example is that Final Fantasy VI iOS port, I think a lot of the flak that

3508
02:46:22,460 --> 02:46:27,340
game's getting and that port's getting is that it was obviously outsourced.

3509
02:46:27,340 --> 02:46:31,840
And so sometimes that's how companies make these things happen is that they do them on

3510
02:46:31,840 --> 02:46:37,040
the super cheap, that they don't have their usual teams working on them, they send them

3511
02:46:37,040 --> 02:46:41,240
to other companies, and in some cases, like Final Fantasy VI, kind of think you get what

3512
02:46:41,240 --> 02:46:43,320
you pay for a little bit, so.

3513
02:46:43,320 --> 02:46:49,020
But Final Fantasy VI also didn't have any prior, you know, I don't think it was ever

3514
02:46:49,020 --> 02:46:54,640
out on PSP, I don't think they redid it at all for DS or anything else that's modern,

3515
02:46:54,640 --> 02:47:00,240
they probably had to go back and basically take that engine they had built for iOS for

3516
02:47:00,240 --> 02:47:03,640
that Final Fantasy...

3517
02:47:03,640 --> 02:47:08,820
There was another, there was a Final Fantasy game that was only on iOS that is like in

3518
02:47:08,820 --> 02:47:13,780
five episodes or something and the first one's free, but that engine is clearly what five

3519
02:47:13,780 --> 02:47:17,520
and six are running in, so they just took those games and like remade them in that engine.

3520
02:47:17,540 --> 02:47:19,540
So, but anyway.

3521
02:47:19,540 --> 02:47:27,020
1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.

3522
02:47:27,020 --> 02:47:28,260
Call our show, dammit.

3523
02:47:28,260 --> 02:47:31,820
You know, I think this is an interesting, worthy comment here from chat.

3524
02:47:31,820 --> 02:47:35,540
Kaijuto says, I'm burned out on retro crap.

3525
02:47:35,540 --> 02:47:37,540
Let's get new and innovative.

3526
02:47:37,540 --> 02:47:39,540
Duh, Dragon Age.

3527
02:47:39,540 --> 02:47:42,700
I think there's a time and a place for retro crap.

3528
02:47:42,700 --> 02:47:47,420
And to this day, and you know I always harp on this whenever I get the opportunity to,

3529
02:47:47,420 --> 02:47:54,140
I think Game Room on Microsoft's Xbox 360 and PC died way before it should have.

3530
02:47:54,140 --> 02:47:55,140
Way before it should have.

3531
02:47:55,140 --> 02:47:59,640
And it's so irritating to then turn around and see them make a documentary on 2600, which

3532
02:47:59,640 --> 02:48:02,200
to be fair I haven't watched and I need to.

3533
02:48:02,200 --> 02:48:03,200
Maybe I'll do that tonight.

3534
02:48:03,200 --> 02:48:04,540
I still really need to watch that.

3535
02:48:04,540 --> 02:48:09,440
But it's like they had a chance to bring back Atari 2600 stuff and it was kind of cool and

3536
02:48:09,440 --> 02:48:15,080
then they let it go for like three months and they pulled the plug and it was very sad.

3537
02:48:15,080 --> 02:48:16,080
Anyway.

3538
02:48:16,740 --> 02:48:18,460
And yeah, Black Wolf says the documentary is good.

3539
02:48:18,460 --> 02:48:19,780
It's only a little over an hour.

3540
02:48:19,780 --> 02:48:20,900
Yeah, I know it's pretty short.

3541
02:48:20,900 --> 02:48:23,480
That's why I really need to make the time to watch it.

3542
02:48:23,480 --> 02:48:25,060
So I'll have to do that at some point.

3543
02:48:25,060 --> 02:48:29,020
I still have an Xbox Gold subscription so I should be able to get it on my 360.

3544
02:48:29,020 --> 02:48:33,020
I just have to hook up my 360 because I disconnected it when I moved some things around here in

3545
02:48:33,020 --> 02:48:34,020
the studio.

3546
02:48:34,020 --> 02:48:35,020
So.

3547
02:48:35,020 --> 02:48:36,020
Alright.

3548
02:48:38,020 --> 02:48:42,620
Last call for calls, 1877 game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

3549
02:48:42,620 --> 02:48:43,620
Oh, there it is.

3550
02:48:43,620 --> 02:48:44,620
We've got one more call coming in.

3551
02:48:44,620 --> 02:48:45,620
Let's get to it.

3552
02:48:46,160 --> 02:48:47,160
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

3553
02:48:47,160 --> 02:48:48,160
Who's this?

3554
02:48:48,160 --> 02:48:49,160
It's me.

3555
02:48:49,160 --> 02:48:50,160
We're only DJ Rama.

3556
02:48:50,160 --> 02:48:51,160
Hey, Rama.

3557
02:48:51,160 --> 02:48:52,160
I like that shirt.

3558
02:48:52,160 --> 02:48:54,160
Is that like a Ninja Turtle shirt you're wearing?

3559
02:48:54,160 --> 02:48:55,160
Even better.

3560
02:48:55,160 --> 02:48:56,720
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Android.

3561
02:48:56,720 --> 02:48:58,160
Oh, my God.

3562
02:48:58,160 --> 02:48:59,160
That's cute.

3563
02:48:59,160 --> 02:49:00,160
I like that.

3564
02:49:00,160 --> 02:49:01,160
What's up, buddy?

3565
02:49:01,160 --> 02:49:02,160
Yes.

3566
02:49:02,160 --> 02:49:03,160
I'm kind of pissed right now.

3567
02:49:03,160 --> 02:49:04,160
Why?

3568
02:49:04,160 --> 02:49:10,080
Nobody's calling in and it seems like if nobody calls in, then I call in and everyone loses

3569
02:49:10,080 --> 02:49:11,080
their mind.

3570
02:49:11,080 --> 02:49:12,080
So you know what?

3571
02:49:12,080 --> 02:49:14,960
I'm here to fill in the gap, keep things going till there's no dead air.

3572
02:49:15,500 --> 02:49:16,500
So I'm here to help you all out.

3573
02:49:16,500 --> 02:49:17,500
I'm a player five.

3574
02:49:17,500 --> 02:49:18,500
Well, gee, thank you.

3575
02:49:18,500 --> 02:49:19,500
I mean, we couldn't have talked.

3576
02:49:19,500 --> 02:49:20,500
No.

3577
02:49:20,500 --> 02:49:24,780
We can always talk amongst ourselves, but I appreciate you calling, Rama.

3578
02:49:24,780 --> 02:49:27,580
It's always more fun with friends.

3579
02:49:27,580 --> 02:49:28,580
And you know what?

3580
02:49:28,580 --> 02:49:33,460
I know some people listen to this show and I know some people say, it's the same damn

3581
02:49:33,460 --> 02:49:35,220
people who call in every week.

3582
02:49:35,220 --> 02:49:38,980
And my response to that is, I would love to have you on the show too.

3583
02:49:38,980 --> 02:49:40,300
Just give us a call.

3584
02:49:40,300 --> 02:49:41,660
It's open for everybody.

3585
02:49:41,660 --> 02:49:42,660
Or email us.

3586
02:49:42,960 --> 02:49:43,960
And here's the thing.

3587
02:49:43,960 --> 02:49:46,520
There have been times I do not call in at all.

3588
02:49:46,520 --> 02:49:50,600
I let everybody else call in and see what's on their mind.

3589
02:49:50,600 --> 02:49:54,480
And it's like, how long does it take to pick up the phone?

3590
02:49:54,480 --> 02:49:55,480
This is what's bothering me.

3591
02:49:55,480 --> 02:49:56,480
This is what's up.

3592
02:49:56,480 --> 02:49:57,480
You know, that's all it is.

3593
02:49:57,480 --> 02:49:58,480
I know.

3594
02:49:58,480 --> 02:49:59,480
It's all right though.

3595
02:49:59,480 --> 02:50:00,480
It's probably a slower.

3596
02:50:00,480 --> 02:50:03,800
I haven't looked at the listener numbers for tonight, but I imagine with everybody going

3597
02:50:03,800 --> 02:50:06,160
back to work tomorrow, it's probably a little lower than usual anyway.

3598
02:50:06,160 --> 02:50:07,160
So no biggie.

3599
02:50:07,160 --> 02:50:08,160
Pretty much.

3600
02:50:08,160 --> 02:50:09,160
So what's on your mind though?

3601
02:50:10,160 --> 02:50:12,300
I picked up another video game over the weekend.

3602
02:50:12,300 --> 02:50:18,100
I picked up a couple of them to help with some awesome friends I have around this country.

3603
02:50:18,100 --> 02:50:19,100
What's that?

3604
02:50:19,100 --> 02:50:21,100
Let me go grab them real quick.

3605
02:50:21,100 --> 02:50:25,260
Because you probably won't believe one of the games that I got.

3606
02:50:25,260 --> 02:50:30,100
And the other one, you probably wouldn't be too surprised that I got in the first place.

3607
02:50:30,100 --> 02:50:36,220
As you all know, a particular remake just happened to come out a few weeks ago.

3608
02:50:36,220 --> 02:50:37,220
There it is.

3609
02:50:37,280 --> 02:50:40,280
That's 2.5 HD Remix on PS3.

3610
02:50:40,280 --> 02:50:41,280
Yeah, I got mine too.

3611
02:50:41,280 --> 02:50:44,600
I didn't pick that up, and I really need to, but the reason why I didn't pick it up is

3612
02:50:44,600 --> 02:50:49,040
because I didn't finish the frickin' first one, and I'm not going to play the second

3613
02:50:49,040 --> 02:50:50,480
one until I finish the first one.

3614
02:50:50,480 --> 02:50:51,480
Because by then it'll be on sale.

3615
02:50:51,480 --> 02:50:53,960
Do you know anything special about this copy though?

3616
02:50:53,960 --> 02:50:54,960
Is that a Japanese one?

3617
02:50:54,960 --> 02:50:55,960
No, it's a pin, Rob.

3618
02:50:55,960 --> 02:50:57,960
This is the limited edition with the Disney pin.

3619
02:50:57,960 --> 02:50:58,960
Oh!

3620
02:50:58,960 --> 02:50:59,960
Oh, holy shit.

3621
02:50:59,960 --> 02:51:00,960
Nice.

3622
02:51:00,960 --> 02:51:04,760
And I just lucked out on that because a friend of mine ordered two copies by accident because

3623
02:51:04,760 --> 02:51:09,940
when I went to go to Target to get mine, they said they had it in store, I go to pick

3624
02:51:09,940 --> 02:51:14,060
it up, I'm dealing with six people trying to ask them for the game, and they had no

3625
02:51:14,060 --> 02:51:15,060
more.

3626
02:51:15,060 --> 02:51:17,260
And when I went home, they still had it in stock, and I'm like, you know what, I'm not

3627
02:51:17,260 --> 02:51:18,260
dealing with it today.

3628
02:51:18,260 --> 02:51:19,260
Yep.

3629
02:51:19,260 --> 02:51:20,260
You know what happened to us?

3630
02:51:20,260 --> 02:51:21,260
What?

3631
02:51:21,260 --> 02:51:22,260
They lost our order.

3632
02:51:22,260 --> 02:51:25,740
No, they sent it to the old house even after we changed our address.

3633
02:51:25,740 --> 02:51:26,740
Oh no.

3634
02:51:26,740 --> 02:51:27,740
And so...

3635
02:51:27,740 --> 02:51:31,660
That actually happened to my copy of, remember when Activision was giving out free copies

3636
02:51:31,660 --> 02:51:34,100
of Guitar Hero Van Halen?

3637
02:51:34,440 --> 02:51:35,440
Yeah.

3638
02:51:35,440 --> 02:51:36,440
That happened to me!

3639
02:51:36,440 --> 02:51:41,560
Well, we ended up talking to the seller and everything, and we got our copy shipped to

3640
02:51:41,560 --> 02:51:42,560
us.

3641
02:51:42,560 --> 02:51:43,560
Nice.

3642
02:51:43,560 --> 02:51:46,080
And it arrived in time for opening presents.

3643
02:51:46,080 --> 02:51:47,080
That is awesome.

3644
02:51:47,080 --> 02:51:54,080
Now, the second game that I picked up, I like to call it Grand Theft Hacking, but from that

3645
02:51:54,080 --> 02:51:58,440
title, though, I think you know which game I'm talking about.

3646
02:51:58,440 --> 02:52:01,240
Grand Theft Hacking, I keep thinking Grand Theft Hacking.

3647
02:52:01,240 --> 02:52:02,240
Watch Dogs.

3648
02:52:02,240 --> 02:52:03,240
Oh, Watch Dogs.

3649
02:52:03,380 --> 02:52:04,380
Yeah, so the PlayStation 3.

3650
02:52:04,380 --> 02:52:05,380
Nice.

3651
02:52:05,380 --> 02:52:06,380
Of course, of course.

3652
02:52:06,380 --> 02:52:09,380
Hey, guess how much I paid for this?

3653
02:52:09,380 --> 02:52:10,380
$9.99.

3654
02:52:10,380 --> 02:52:11,380
Higher.

3655
02:52:11,380 --> 02:52:12,380
Uh, $19.99.

3656
02:52:12,380 --> 02:52:15,020
Crossed 25 with shipping.

3657
02:52:15,020 --> 02:52:16,020
That's not bad.

3658
02:52:16,020 --> 02:52:17,020
Not bad.

3659
02:52:17,020 --> 02:52:20,820
It seems that select targets were getting rid of it, and a friend of mine posted a picture

3660
02:52:20,820 --> 02:52:25,860
of the game, and I'm like, I will pay you money to send this to me, because I know for

3661
02:52:25,860 --> 02:52:28,720
a fact if I check my target, it'll be retail price.

3662
02:52:28,720 --> 02:52:32,020
And I checked, sure enough, this game was $59.

3663
02:52:32,800 --> 02:52:38,040
And after playing two hours of this game, I tell you what, I feel sorry for anyone who

3664
02:52:38,040 --> 02:52:39,800
paid retail price for this.

3665
02:52:39,800 --> 02:52:40,800
I do.

3666
02:52:40,800 --> 02:52:47,160
I'm gonna tell you, this is not the best time of year to get video games, because with everybody

3667
02:52:47,160 --> 02:52:52,280
that gets gift cards over the holiday season, they want to go to the stores and spend all

3668
02:52:52,280 --> 02:52:57,200
that money, so there's usually not a lot of sales early on this time of year.

3669
02:52:57,200 --> 02:53:00,640
You're gonna have to wait for probably like President's Day, things like that, where you're

3670
02:53:00,660 --> 02:53:03,700
gonna start to see some sales again to get people back in the stores.

3671
02:53:03,700 --> 02:53:08,420
But yeah, these first few weeks of January, really crappy time to get games, because they

3672
02:53:08,420 --> 02:53:10,820
know people want to burn those gift cards they got.

3673
02:53:10,820 --> 02:53:18,560
Well, see, if I'm buying anything, it won't be video games, it'll be technology to keep

3674
02:53:18,560 --> 02:53:23,420
the podcast and my crew going to conventions and doing other cool stuff.

3675
02:53:23,420 --> 02:53:28,020
That's right, which is a necessity for a convention-focused show like your guys's.

3676
02:53:28,080 --> 02:53:31,240
You know, we had a big convention here in Sacramento this weekend, and just none of

3677
02:53:31,240 --> 02:53:33,880
us got around to getting out, but SacAnime was this weekend.

3678
02:53:33,880 --> 02:53:35,880
Why did y'all not go to SacAnime?

3679
02:53:35,880 --> 02:53:38,480
I know people, I would have gotten y'all a hookup.

3680
02:53:38,480 --> 02:53:39,480
You know what's funny?

3681
02:53:39,480 --> 02:53:43,520
And I know people through the stuff I used to do with Rocky, I know people involved with

3682
02:53:43,520 --> 02:53:46,560
that stuff too, and it's just, I don't know why we don't go, well, I know why we don't

3683
02:53:46,560 --> 02:53:50,240
go to the summer one, because the summer one is always the same weekend as Dragon Con and

3684
02:53:50,240 --> 02:53:53,800
PAX, so it's like, sorry, SacAnime, there's just so much going on.

3685
02:53:53,800 --> 02:53:55,160
I don't know why we don't go to the winter one.

3686
02:53:55,160 --> 02:53:56,160
I don't have an excuse.

3687
02:53:56,220 --> 02:53:58,220
I really should have fucking gone, and I didn't.

3688
02:53:58,220 --> 02:53:59,220
I just, I don't know.

3689
02:53:59,220 --> 02:54:04,540
I honestly, honest to God, I just forgot until one of my Facebook friends, actually, several

3690
02:54:04,540 --> 02:54:09,220
of my Facebook friends were like, LOL, I was at SacAnime today, and I was like, aw, fuck.

3691
02:54:09,220 --> 02:54:13,140
Yeah, because one of my friends who's also a voice actor, he went, he posted a picture

3692
02:54:13,140 --> 02:54:19,700
of him and Peter Cullen, and I'm just like, oh, you bastard.

3693
02:54:19,700 --> 02:54:20,700
Yeah.

3694
02:54:20,700 --> 02:54:24,180
They're getting a lot of big names there right now, because again, this isn't a big time

3695
02:54:24,200 --> 02:54:28,320
of year for cons, but celebs still want to get paid, so they can get some really good

3696
02:54:28,320 --> 02:54:29,320
talent.

3697
02:54:29,320 --> 02:54:33,760
And what's interesting is there's also another convention going on this weekend, too, I have

3698
02:54:33,760 --> 02:54:37,920
friends that are staffing and working right now, Otacon Vegas.

3699
02:54:37,920 --> 02:54:41,680
Oh, I didn't know that was this weekend, interesting.

3700
02:54:41,680 --> 02:54:42,680
Wow.

3701
02:54:42,680 --> 02:54:43,680
All right.

3702
02:54:43,680 --> 02:54:47,760
Well, Rama, does Anime Jam Session come back from hiatus this week, or are you off on the

3703
02:54:47,760 --> 02:54:48,760
week?

3704
02:54:48,760 --> 02:54:49,760
No, we're still hibernating.

3705
02:54:49,760 --> 02:54:57,540
We're going to be back next week, live episode, January 13th, and we're doing what you missed

3706
02:54:57,540 --> 02:55:02,140
in the last two weeks in the fuckery that is anime and cosplay and other pop culture

3707
02:55:02,140 --> 02:55:03,140
stuff.

3708
02:55:03,140 --> 02:55:04,140
Well, good.

3709
02:55:04,140 --> 02:55:06,140
I look forward to hearing about SacAnime on that, since I didn't go.

3710
02:55:06,140 --> 02:55:10,020
Well, I think I'd be able to recruit someone to talk to us about SacAnime, but some of

3711
02:55:10,020 --> 02:55:14,860
the other news we've been picking up, oh, yeah, it'll be quite fun.

3712
02:55:14,860 --> 02:55:19,060
But Rama, Yaya Han went to SacAnime, come on.

3713
02:55:19,060 --> 02:55:21,160
I'm glad I didn't go.

3714
02:55:21,160 --> 02:55:24,520
You can't wait, so that means it's called Silicon.

3715
02:55:24,520 --> 02:55:27,880
Oh, you people, you people, all right.

3716
02:55:27,880 --> 02:55:29,960
Anime Jam Session, Tuesday nights here on VOG.

3717
02:55:29,960 --> 02:55:30,960
All right.

3718
02:55:30,960 --> 02:55:31,960
Take care, buddy.

3719
02:55:31,960 --> 02:55:32,960
Yeah, you stay fabulous, Rob.

3720
02:55:32,960 --> 02:55:33,960
Thank you.

3721
02:55:33,960 --> 02:55:34,960
I will.

3722
02:55:34,960 --> 02:55:35,960
Stay black.

3723
02:55:35,960 --> 02:55:36,960
I will.

3724
02:55:36,960 --> 02:55:37,960
I'll try.

3725
02:55:37,960 --> 02:55:38,960
All right.

3726
02:55:38,960 --> 02:55:39,960
Bye.

3727
02:55:39,960 --> 02:55:40,960
Bye.

3728
02:55:40,960 --> 02:55:41,960
There it is.

3729
02:55:41,960 --> 02:55:42,960
I'm going to go ahead and close up the Skype line.

3730
02:55:42,960 --> 02:55:43,960
Thank you guys so much for calling.

3731
02:55:43,960 --> 02:55:46,320
If you didn't get through and you wanted to, well, you should have called a little faster,

3732
02:55:46,320 --> 02:55:47,320
too.

3733
02:55:47,320 --> 02:55:52,860
You can always email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, but it is after midnight on the East Coast,

3734
02:55:52,860 --> 02:55:55,380
about time for us to wrap up here on the West Coast.

3735
02:55:55,380 --> 02:55:59,940
Thank you guys so much for tuning into the show and listening to our show.

3736
02:55:59,940 --> 02:56:02,700
We hope you enjoyed it, despite the fact it was a little more of a slow news week, but

3737
02:56:02,700 --> 02:56:06,540
you know, I think some of you like the tangents, so there was plenty of those for you this

3738
02:56:06,540 --> 02:56:07,540
week.

3739
02:56:07,540 --> 02:56:11,260
If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please help us spread the word,

3740
02:56:11,260 --> 02:56:16,300
because we don't have a big magazine or website or big radio network or something.

3741
02:56:16,300 --> 02:56:18,480
We don't have any backing from any of that.

3742
02:56:18,480 --> 02:56:23,520
We are a homegrown show in our 13th year, if you can believe it.

3743
02:56:23,520 --> 02:56:25,960
So word of mouth is all we got, word of mouth.

3744
02:56:25,960 --> 02:56:32,120
Tell a friend or five about the show, a five-star rating on a network like iTunes or Stitcher,

3745
02:56:32,120 --> 02:56:35,600
on which, by the way, we haven't gotten a five-star rating in a very long time on either

3746
02:56:35,600 --> 02:56:39,140
of those networks, so we would really appreciate it if you take a few seconds to, wherever

3747
02:56:39,140 --> 02:56:42,040
you learned about this show, go leave us a nice review.

3748
02:56:42,040 --> 02:56:46,120
It goes a long way in helping for visibility, and we really deeply appreciate each one we

3749
02:56:46,120 --> 02:56:47,120
get.

3750
02:56:47,120 --> 02:56:51,340
It is time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

3751
02:56:51,340 --> 02:56:52,500
Dark Soccer, I'll start with you tonight.

3752
02:56:52,500 --> 02:56:54,340
Your final thought?

3753
02:56:54,340 --> 02:56:56,460
I want ice cream.

3754
02:56:56,460 --> 02:56:57,820
Yummy.

3755
02:56:57,820 --> 02:57:04,100
My final thought tonight is support indie broadcasting, and also, I've got a lot of

3756
02:57:04,100 --> 02:57:08,680
work to do, speaking of indie stuff, for VOG with loading the shows and all that stuff,

3757
02:57:08,680 --> 02:57:13,040
before I go to bed early, so I can get up for work early and go to work early, yay early

3758
02:57:13,040 --> 02:57:15,040
work, blah.

3759
02:57:15,040 --> 02:57:16,820
Loki, your final thought tonight?

3760
02:57:16,820 --> 02:57:20,300
I'll be damn lucky if I finish my VOG gym project by Sunday, but...

3761
02:57:20,300 --> 02:57:21,300
You can do it.

3762
02:57:21,300 --> 02:57:22,300
I will try.

3763
02:57:22,300 --> 02:57:23,540
At least get one stage playable.

3764
02:57:23,540 --> 02:57:24,540
At least get something.

3765
02:57:24,540 --> 02:57:25,540
At least get a little something.

3766
02:57:25,540 --> 02:57:26,540
I'll try.

3767
02:57:26,540 --> 02:57:27,540
All right, there it is, guys.

3768
02:57:27,540 --> 02:57:31,500
That is gonna do it, and as one of our emailers said tonight, we've got a lot of great stuff

3769
02:57:31,500 --> 02:57:36,060
in gaming to look forward to this year, lots of great games on the way, things we might

3770
02:57:36,060 --> 02:57:39,500
not even know about yet that we're gonna hear about at E3 and so forth, but it's gonna be

3771
02:57:39,500 --> 02:57:42,700
an exciting year, and thanks for choosing to start it off with us.

3772
02:57:42,700 --> 02:57:43,820
We really appreciate it.

3773
02:57:43,820 --> 02:57:44,820
Have a great week, everybody.

3774
02:57:44,820 --> 02:57:45,820
Happy gaming.

3775
02:57:45,820 --> 02:57:49,080
We'll be back to do it again next week when everybody's back at work, and hopefully we

3776
02:57:49,080 --> 02:57:50,300
have a little more news.

3777
02:57:50,300 --> 02:57:52,960
