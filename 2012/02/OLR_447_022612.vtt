00:00.000 --> 00:19.880
Tonight, February 26, 2012, Sony pulls an app from the Vita just days after release,

00:19.880 --> 00:24.720
Pokemon has new sequels announced, and big companies team up for a portable console game

00:24.720 --> 00:31.960
collaboration.

00:31.960 --> 00:35.480
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.480 --> 00:39.680
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.680 --> 00:46.100
We are live right now, Sunday, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf

00:46.100 --> 00:49.800
show at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

00:49.800 --> 00:54.120
It is February 26, episode 447.

00:54.120 --> 00:57.880
I'll be joining over the next few hours, my name is Rob Roberts, with my co-hosts, say

00:57.880 --> 01:00.560
hello to Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:00.560 --> 01:01.560
Hi.

01:01.560 --> 01:02.560
How are you?

01:02.560 --> 01:03.560
I'm alright.

01:03.560 --> 01:04.560
You alright?

01:04.560 --> 01:05.560
Just alright?

01:05.560 --> 01:06.560
Yeah, it's been trying.

01:06.560 --> 01:07.560
But you had salad.

01:07.560 --> 01:08.640
Salad makes it all better.

01:08.640 --> 01:13.400
I did, but I just put balsamic vinegar in, not the kind of dressing I wanted, so it didn't

01:13.400 --> 01:15.440
turn out all that great and I'm feeling kind of sick now.

01:15.440 --> 01:16.440
Aww.

01:16.440 --> 01:17.440
Well, I hope the show can cheer you up.

01:17.440 --> 01:20.760
We're going to have a fun few hours tonight talking about video games and stuff, with

01:20.760 --> 01:24.400
of course our other co-hosts, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.

01:24.400 --> 01:25.400
Hello.

01:25.400 --> 01:26.400
How are you, Loki?

01:26.400 --> 01:27.400
I'm fine.

01:27.400 --> 01:30.480
Alright, starting it off tonight, a popular game we like to play for the show is, what

01:30.480 --> 01:31.920
did Loki bring to dinner tonight?

01:31.920 --> 01:34.080
So, Loki, what did you bring to dinner for the show tonight?

01:34.080 --> 01:38.240
I brought Taco Bell, but I actually wasn't that hungry, I didn't finish it.

01:38.240 --> 01:42.360
Now, and I asked you this before the show, did you try to win another PlayStation Vita

01:42.360 --> 01:43.360
at Taco Bell?

01:43.360 --> 01:44.360
No.

01:44.360 --> 01:45.360
What made you decide to go to Taco Bell?

01:45.360 --> 01:51.440
You know, it's funny, because I actually really hate Taco Bell, or at least I used to really

01:51.440 --> 01:57.560
hate Taco Bell, and so I just started eating Taco Bell, because I guess I'm less picky

01:57.560 --> 02:04.440
on what I'm eating now, so I got the steak quesadilla, which is hardly steak, but it's

02:04.440 --> 02:05.440
a quesadilla.

02:05.440 --> 02:08.760
Alright, look, I don't need the entire play-by-play.

02:08.760 --> 02:10.960
And two crunchy tacos.

02:10.960 --> 02:15.560
The reason why I'm kind of bringing this up is because I remember just before the show

02:15.560 --> 02:20.360
I was reading about that Taco Bell is in a lot of trouble over this Vita promotion, like,

02:20.360 --> 02:24.280
what is this, a bunch of people got an email that said they won, so imagine this, you get

02:24.280 --> 02:27.680
an email that says, you just won a frickin' PlayStation Vita.

02:27.680 --> 02:28.680
Not quite an email.

02:28.680 --> 02:30.000
Here's what basically happened.

02:30.000 --> 02:37.200
They put their codes into a website, and it says, congratulations, you've won a Vita upon

02:37.200 --> 02:40.280
verification and blah blah blah.

02:40.280 --> 02:45.400
But at the same time, they say first off that someone hacked their site, and so for a while

02:45.400 --> 02:48.940
it was showing that to everybody, regardless if you're a winner or not.

02:48.940 --> 02:51.200
And then they said, oh, well someone gamed the system.

02:51.200 --> 02:55.880
Well apparently someone, the reason they think, well, the reason that someone could game the

02:55.880 --> 02:58.560
system was the code was a 12-digit code.

02:58.560 --> 03:03.240
Only the last four numbers actually changed each time, so it's pretty easy to figure out

03:03.240 --> 03:07.920
every single, you know, to at least run down a list to see which codes would work or not.

03:07.920 --> 03:12.720
And then there's also ways to directly link to the winning page and stuff like that.

03:12.720 --> 03:13.720
Wow.

03:13.720 --> 03:21.800
So, okay, so the company that's marketing this for Taco Bell is, you know, terrible

03:21.800 --> 03:22.800
apparently.

03:22.800 --> 03:23.800
Fired.

03:23.800 --> 03:24.800
Well, yeah, among other things.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.680
Well, now there's room, they have a whole Facebook page.

03:27.680 --> 03:30.460
I was reading through that, because, you know, I love drama, so I was reading through their

03:30.460 --> 03:33.800
Facebook page and all these, you know, very angry people, which, you know, I can imagine

03:33.800 --> 03:34.800
especially.

03:34.800 --> 03:41.480
I mean, I understand someone may have gamed the game, but I think, I think there legitimately

03:41.480 --> 03:46.560
is probably a lot of people that did actually win that are getting screwed by this.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.560
Yeah.

03:47.560 --> 03:51.600
So, you know, now they're talking about class-action lawsuit, and that good old lawyer from right

03:51.600 --> 03:57.280
here in Sacramento where OLR's headquartered that, I don't, who did, he suits, he was buying

03:57.280 --> 03:58.280
some other big lawsuit.

03:58.280 --> 04:03.880
I don't remember if it was Taco Bell before or Sony, might have been the Sony class-action

04:03.880 --> 04:04.880
thing.

04:04.880 --> 04:08.680
I don't know, but I didn't, I didn't, I didn't do all my research, because this literally

04:08.680 --> 04:09.680
came up before the show.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.840
They had, they had something else on the local news that was like one of those call Curtis

04:12.840 --> 04:15.680
or something like that, you know, the consumer help thing.

04:15.680 --> 04:18.440
Investigative reports, consumer watchdog, please watch our news broadcast.

04:18.440 --> 04:19.440
Yeah, something like that.

04:19.440 --> 04:25.080
And they were checking stuff out, but, you know, I think honestly for anybody that got

04:25.080 --> 04:32.800
that page, you know, it says upon verification, now if you have the winning code, I mean,

04:32.800 --> 04:39.000
unless, I mean, unless they actually come out, okay, here's the list of code numbers

04:39.000 --> 04:43.560
that were winning codes, you know, which that's not gonna come out unless, you know, there's

04:43.560 --> 04:49.720
some investigation stuff done during the whole court process, but, you know, how are you

04:49.720 --> 04:52.040
gonna be able to prove that you have a winning code?

04:52.040 --> 04:53.040
You can't.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.920
I mean, because it's up to Taco Bell to say, nope, no, you didn't.

04:55.920 --> 04:59.400
Yeah, I know you saw that, but it was upon verification, and we verified your code is

04:59.400 --> 05:02.180
not, not a winning code.

05:02.180 --> 05:07.400
But apparently also, I guess, the website shows, like, who's won, like, each time there's

05:07.400 --> 05:10.120
a winner, and it hasn't updated for a long time.

05:10.120 --> 05:12.760
Well, now, because the thing is broken, who knows?

05:12.760 --> 05:13.760
I don't know.

05:13.760 --> 05:15.840
It's all messed up.

05:15.840 --> 05:16.840
As very messed up.

05:16.840 --> 05:20.680
So it's gonna be interesting to see the legal things that come out of this or what the promotion

05:20.680 --> 05:22.720
company behind this whole thing is gonna have to do.

05:22.720 --> 05:23.720
We'll see.

05:23.720 --> 05:27.720
If anything, they might try, they'll probably try to sweep it under the rug, but we'll see.

05:27.720 --> 05:28.720
All right.

05:28.720 --> 05:33.160
Anyhow, I want to give a shout out to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, where

05:33.160 --> 05:36.840
folks talk live with us, as we do tape, of course, every Sunday night.

05:36.840 --> 05:37.840
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

05:37.840 --> 05:41.880
I'll let Acidic Vampire start us off tonight, and chat says, hello, people.

05:41.880 --> 05:42.880
Fuck the Oscars.

05:42.880 --> 05:48.200
Because, yes, it is Sunday, and inevitably, there's always freaking something on TV on

05:48.200 --> 05:53.160
Sundays, whether it be the Grammys or the Tonys, and tonight it's the Oscars, which

05:53.160 --> 05:55.360
is kind of a big deal for some people.

05:55.360 --> 05:56.760
We need the Buddies.

05:56.760 --> 05:57.760
The Buddies?

05:57.760 --> 06:03.480
Yeah, we have the, you know, just, like, a complete, this is what we think of your award

06:03.480 --> 06:04.480
show.

06:04.480 --> 06:05.480
It's butt.

06:05.480 --> 06:09.000
Next year, we need to have the Schmoskers, where we do some type of, you know, video

06:09.000 --> 06:12.520
game-related Oscar thing on the show, but that would require planning.

06:12.520 --> 06:17.880
Plus, I'm a bigger fan of the Razzies, which talks about the worst in cinema, which they've

06:17.880 --> 06:19.220
changed their schedule now.

06:19.220 --> 06:22.720
They used to give out the awards the day before the Oscar, but now they give the nominations

06:22.720 --> 06:26.840
the day before the Oscars, and the ceremony's gonna be on April Fool's Day.

06:26.840 --> 06:30.120
Guess who got 11 nominations at the Razzies this year?

06:30.120 --> 06:34.160
For worst, like, worst actor, worst producer, worst film, worst everything.

06:34.160 --> 06:38.080
Um, let me think.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.080
Justin Bieber?

06:39.080 --> 06:40.160
No, not Justin Bieber.

06:40.160 --> 06:45.280
Twilight was nominated for worst picture, but Adam Sandler got nominated for, like,

06:45.280 --> 06:50.360
for like three different movies, and that Jack and Jill, he's nominated for worst actor.

06:50.360 --> 06:51.360
That's a winner right there.

06:51.360 --> 06:52.580
There you go.

06:52.580 --> 06:53.720
That is a winner.

06:53.720 --> 06:55.840
That's a winning loser right there.

06:55.840 --> 06:56.840
That's the biggest loser.

06:56.840 --> 07:01.840
And, hey, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and predict another possible winning, well,

07:01.840 --> 07:06.920
it's definitely gonna be a winner coming soon from Adam Sandler as well, Candyland.

07:06.920 --> 07:12.040
Is that, oh god, is that the whole, like, Battleship, and all these board games, apparently

07:12.040 --> 07:13.680
Clue's gonna get another movie?

07:13.680 --> 07:14.680
Hasbro, yeah.

07:14.680 --> 07:16.680
He's doing Candyland?

07:16.680 --> 07:21.520
Oh, that's kind of disturbing, like, ugh, I need bleach.

07:21.520 --> 07:24.160
Alright, look, we need to move on, games.

07:24.160 --> 07:27.480
So, before we get into our gaming week, so I guess this might be a little bit about gaming

07:27.480 --> 07:31.720
weeks, but Vita, okay, everybody's got Vita fever this week, because the system officially

07:31.720 --> 07:36.440
launched, so we had a lot of people talking about it last week with the pre-launch, whatever,

07:36.440 --> 07:40.600
now the system officially launched this week, I got my hot little hands on a Vita, and I

07:40.600 --> 07:43.600
think a lot of you out there did, I realize there are some other people that are like,

07:43.600 --> 07:48.120
no one cur, because, you know, there's always gotta be the haters, and then there's of course

07:48.120 --> 07:52.000
a lot of other people that, I think this is where a lot of people fit into, is like, I'll

07:52.000 --> 07:57.440
probably get one when the price comes down, or when XYZ game comes out.

07:57.440 --> 08:02.000
Speaking of the price coming down, let me start off with this, you were pretty angry

08:02.000 --> 08:07.040
on Twitter this week at a story about the price coming down, this whole games analysts

08:07.040 --> 08:10.840
are analyzing the system two days after it launches, what was this all about?

08:10.840 --> 08:18.640
Well, they were like going, oh, it's not selling well, or like, oh, it hasn't sold that many

08:18.640 --> 08:21.960
copies, I don't even know where they're getting data yet, I don't even think they have data,

08:21.960 --> 08:26.560
and now obviously they were looking at Japan, but that doesn't mean anything, I mean, if

08:26.560 --> 08:32.280
you're basing our information off of what goes on in Japan, then the Xbox 360 is doomed,

08:32.280 --> 08:37.440
because it just doesn't sell well in Japan, but yeah, they're already saying, oh, it needs,

08:37.440 --> 08:43.920
the price drop needs to happen now, it's like, dude, it just came out, like, how are you

08:43.920 --> 08:50.720
even, how are you coming to this conclusion of what its sales are yet, I mean, it just

08:50.720 --> 08:57.200
came out, you're going to get day one sales and that's it, I mean, look at the 3DS, if

08:57.200 --> 09:00.920
you're going to look at the 3DS, you know, day one sales or whatever, I'm sure they were

09:00.920 --> 09:01.920
terrible.

09:01.920 --> 09:07.000
Well, it also seems like the Vita, you know, I'm really trying to be impartial here and

09:07.000 --> 09:10.600
not sound like a Sony fanboy, but I got to be honest, the Vita seems to have a better

09:10.600 --> 09:15.440
launch projection over the next few months than the 3DS had, it seems like they've got

09:15.440 --> 09:20.160
some big titles evenly spaced out to keep it interesting, like what, little big planets

09:20.160 --> 09:26.120
next month, that's going to be a big deal, resistance in a few months, the frickin' Capcom

09:26.120 --> 09:30.640
cross Tekken's got what, 12 people on the Vita, which is ridiculous to me, excuse me,

09:30.640 --> 09:33.860
what did I say, Street Fighter cross Tekken, what did I say, Capcom cross, well, that's

09:33.860 --> 09:37.460
more accurate, look at the characters, they just, they already used the Capcom cross Namco

09:37.460 --> 09:44.440
thing or Namcom cross, Namcom, alright fine, it's Namcom, the Namcom game comes out, I

09:44.440 --> 09:48.420
have problems, the Namcom game comes out this coming month, I mean, the Vita's got a lot

09:48.420 --> 09:53.560
of stuff coming for it, whereas the 3DS was hurtin', I mean, there was really, I mean,

09:53.560 --> 10:00.360
their biggest launch title was what, the Street Fighter 4, the Street Fighter, sadly Ridge

10:00.360 --> 10:06.720
Racer was pretty good, it was actually, I think it was a pretty good 3DS game, no it

10:06.720 --> 10:11.560
was, it was just funny the way you phrased that, sadly Ridge Racer, well, I mean, Ridge

10:11.560 --> 10:18.680
Racer, to be honest, it doesn't change, I mean, it hasn't changed in a long time, so

10:18.680 --> 10:22.640
yeah, I mean, they've got a lot of, and the Vita titles, I mean, there was like a good

10:22.640 --> 10:30.360
30 Vita titles at launch, that's a lot, I mean, and there's still, there's some crap,

10:30.360 --> 10:34.640
but there's some, like little deviants, well, but there's some really good stuff too, you

10:34.640 --> 10:40.920
know, like one game I wanna talk about, Luminous, which is hotness, let me put it this way,

10:40.920 --> 10:44.480
I am a huge whore for all things Q Entertainment, and I've been that way on this show for a

10:44.480 --> 10:50.000
long, long time, you know, Luminous, Meteos, Gun Pay, every extend, you know, all their

10:50.000 --> 10:56.040
games, I freakin' defended 99 Nights on this show, it's not that bad, it's not that bad,

10:56.040 --> 11:03.080
alright, but, I don't wanna talk about that, alright, but Luminous, like, I bought the

11:03.080 --> 11:06.320
original Luminous, I bought Luminous 2, I bought Luminous on Xbox, I bought Luminous

11:06.320 --> 11:09.800
on Steam, so yes, of course I bought this new Luminous game, and I'll tell you what,

11:09.800 --> 11:15.280
it really is the best freakin' one yet, and I'm amazed to say that, because I will say,

11:15.280 --> 11:18.280
Luminous has had its weak points, I don't think that Xbox Live version of Luminous was

11:18.280 --> 11:23.380
very good, because there was so much they promised for that that never happened, where

11:23.380 --> 11:26.600
is my Madonna in Luminous, when's that gonna happen?

11:26.600 --> 11:33.120
Hey, real quick, just like, you know, kind of a thought here, wouldn't it be awesome

11:33.120 --> 11:38.600
if they port Child of Eden to the Vita, touch screen, aiming and everything?

11:38.600 --> 11:43.700
Even Rez, heck yeah, like a combo pack would be pretty amazing, but anyway, don't get me

11:43.700 --> 11:48.520
excited, Logie, but like, no, this Luminous game is so good, like, I can't, like, it is

11:48.520 --> 11:54.000
this generation's Tetris, it is that freakin' good, like, but, you know, again, I'm fully

11:54.000 --> 11:59.840
admitting, I also just, I have been in love with almost everything Tetsuya Mizuguchi's

11:59.840 --> 12:04.000
ever done, you know, all the way back to like Space Channel 5 and all that, so, you know,

12:04.000 --> 12:08.440
of course there's the built-in love for this game, but it's really hot on the Vita, it's

12:08.440 --> 12:12.600
shows off a lot of the functionality without being ridiculous, like, you can use the back

12:12.600 --> 12:17.140
touch pad, but you don't have to, you can use touch controls, but you don't have to,

12:17.140 --> 12:19.920
you know, there's a lot of good stuff to it, and I like the way it ties into the internet

12:19.920 --> 12:23.640
with the big block, although there's some serious balancing issues with the XP, but

12:23.640 --> 12:31.360
whatever, and the song list is so good, it is so good, like, I know, Logie and I had

12:31.360 --> 12:34.400
a talk on Bobby's show about this, yeah, I know he doesn't agree with me totally, but

12:34.400 --> 12:40.800
I think the song list is, because it's recognizable enough without them having to have shilled

12:40.800 --> 12:44.920
out all this money for AAA licenses like they did with Luminous 2, because like Luminous

12:44.920 --> 12:49.560
2 had Missy Elliott and Beck and Gwen Stefani, which some of it seemed really oddly out of

12:49.560 --> 12:55.040
place, but this song is that perfect match of, oh, hey, this is a song by Faithless,

12:55.040 --> 12:58.520
I think I heard them before, oh, Goldfrapp, they're pretty cool, here's a song, you know,

12:58.520 --> 13:02.560
like, there's just enough, and it's not usually their biggest hit, that's the other thing

13:02.560 --> 13:07.040
I'm noticing, there's a Benny Benassi song in it, but it's not Satisfaction, you know,

13:07.040 --> 13:11.800
there's a Beloved song in it, but it's not Sweet Harmony, it's a really neat way they

13:11.800 --> 13:16.240
kind of came up with that song list, and so, and the skins are gorgeous, the original tracks

13:16.240 --> 13:21.000
they've mixed in are good too, love, love, love, love, it's an early contender for my

13:21.000 --> 13:25.680
game of the year, honestly and truly, but again, I knew I was gonna like this game.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.160
Is it your game of February?

13:27.160 --> 13:29.680
Is my, is totally my game of February, absolutely.

13:29.680 --> 13:32.000
Well, I played yours.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.520
Yes.

13:33.520 --> 13:41.720
And my review for the Vita is, oh, my hand, because of how high up the buttons are on

13:41.720 --> 13:45.560
the right side, because again, I had hand surgery, it's holding my hand in that position,

13:45.560 --> 13:50.920
it actually kind of hurt, I tried using the touch screen for Luminous, which was actually

13:50.920 --> 13:58.520
a little hard, but it was really pretty, except I got really annoyed at some of the color

13:58.520 --> 14:02.520
change, but you don't even realize when the color's changed until you're like five blocks

14:02.520 --> 14:04.200
in, oh my god, the color's different.

14:04.200 --> 14:08.120
Yeah, the transition effect is much different than it was in the other Luminous games.

14:08.120 --> 14:11.440
Going to our chat room, Black Wolf in our chat room says Luminous was awesome when I

14:11.440 --> 14:15.960
plugged in my heavy duty podcasting headphones, I gotta try that at some point, oh, sounds

14:15.960 --> 14:17.440
awesome.

14:17.440 --> 14:23.040
Let's see, let's go to another question here from Frisbee, is the Vita worth the money?

14:23.040 --> 14:26.280
That's an excellent question that I don't think I can answer with a definitive yes or

14:26.280 --> 14:27.280
no.

14:27.280 --> 14:33.640
For me, yes, but I like to be on the cutting edge of this type of technology, now, my Vita

14:33.640 --> 14:38.320
experience has not been without problems, the Katamari game, which is the other game

14:38.320 --> 14:42.780
I picked up at launch, besides Luminous, froze my system the other night, like I'm talking

14:42.780 --> 14:47.480
it so bad, where it would not wake up out of sleep mode, I tried to hold down the power

14:47.480 --> 14:51.160
button, here's a tip, if you get into this problem, put it into a coma, yeah, it did,

14:51.160 --> 14:54.960
if you hold down, I mean, the Katamari broke it or rolled it up, I don't know, but you

14:54.960 --> 15:00.000
hold down the power button for about 10 seconds, and you'll get a menu kind of akin to what

15:00.000 --> 15:03.960
happens when you hold down one of the function keys when you start Windows, where you can

15:03.960 --> 15:09.080
do like a hard reset of the Vita, you can reset all your settings, I tried to do a hard

15:09.080 --> 15:13.720
reset, nothing happened, I ended up erasing all my settings, nothing happened, and I'm

15:13.720 --> 15:20.160
like holy shit, I have a Luminous, I have a Vita that I'm using to play a lot of Luminous

15:20.160 --> 15:29.720
break after 24 hours, but finally I just ejected the cartridge of Katamari, woke right up,

15:29.720 --> 15:33.920
and I had to reset everything, and I was so mad that I'd done that, so if your Vita will

15:33.920 --> 15:38.840
not wake up, eject the cartridge first thing, you think it's basic troubleshooting 101,

15:38.840 --> 15:42.320
so in other words my point is the Vita is not without its problems, especially for this

15:42.320 --> 15:46.200
early adoption, but what have we said for years and years and years on this program

15:46.200 --> 15:50.040
is the golden rule of gaming, Dark Soccer, please remind the listeners, a system is only

15:50.040 --> 15:51.480
as good as the games that are on it.

15:51.480 --> 15:52.480
Thank you.

15:52.480 --> 15:53.480
Trademark.

15:53.480 --> 15:57.040
If there is a game on the Vita, or several games on the Vita that you have to have right

15:57.040 --> 15:59.000
now, yes, get one.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.560
If you're a big Luminous whore like me, you're not going to be disappointed.

16:03.560 --> 16:08.520
If you want to get this new Katamari game, Uncharted, it's not a Naughty Dog Uncharted,

16:08.520 --> 16:13.480
but I'm hearing it's okay except for the fact that they've really shoved all the touch stuff

16:13.480 --> 16:14.660
into it.

16:14.660 --> 16:19.900
If you want Marvel vs. Capcom 3 on the go, you can't get that on the 3DS right now, then

16:19.900 --> 16:24.440
yeah, there might be something here worth your money, but if you don't think there's

16:24.440 --> 16:28.200
something in it for you right now, don't spend the money.

16:28.200 --> 16:30.920
It's really hard to kind of put a price tag on that.

16:30.920 --> 16:38.800
I bought a 3DS when they were still $249, I don't regret that decision, but it was kind

16:38.800 --> 16:40.440
of a weak launch lineup.

16:40.440 --> 16:47.540
Honestly, I like the Vita, but I have the games that I want on my phone, and I'm really

16:47.540 --> 16:51.080
wanting an iPad later, because you know what I can do with an iPad?

16:51.080 --> 16:52.080
I cayed.

16:52.080 --> 16:55.600
Let me go to SSJ100Matt in our chat room.

16:55.600 --> 16:58.440
Is the 3G version really worth it?

16:58.440 --> 17:03.040
I'll say this, I bought a 3G Vita, and I'm going to answer that with a no.

17:03.040 --> 17:07.640
I kind of think I shouldn't have done that, and I know some of you tried to call me out

17:07.640 --> 17:11.660
on it last week, and I will admit after getting my hands on it and using it, it was a mistake,

17:11.660 --> 17:19.020
and I would say they really pushed it with advertising that Super Stardust Delta or whatever

17:19.020 --> 17:23.280
is an included game, because it's kind of BS, the hurdles you have to jump around to

17:23.280 --> 17:27.300
get that, and that's part of the reason I just went for the 3G, because I'm like, with

17:27.300 --> 17:32.240
all this value, what, I'm paying $10 for 3G, okay, I might use that someday, I'll go ahead

17:32.240 --> 17:33.240
and buy it.

17:33.240 --> 17:35.480
I'm having a little bit of buyer's remorse on that.

17:35.480 --> 17:40.520
However, this is very important, I have an iPhone.

17:40.520 --> 17:47.360
If I didn't have the iPhone, I could see a lot more use in the 3G, so that would be my

17:47.360 --> 17:51.320
suggestion for you is that if you don't have some type of, and I realize some of you are

17:51.320 --> 17:56.240
Android folks too, if you don't have some type of smart device where you can get the

17:56.240 --> 18:00.920
web anywhere, then you might want to look into 3G for the Vita, I think it would be

18:00.920 --> 18:05.200
a good thing, because the web browser's pretty nice, I got to say, but if you already have

18:05.200 --> 18:11.240
a 3G device that you're paying for, I don't, the games don't play over 3G.

18:11.240 --> 18:16.380
The 3G is for stuff like Nier, it's for downloading patches, that's it.

18:16.380 --> 18:18.720
Don't expect to play head to head over 3G.

18:18.720 --> 18:21.080
It would be kind of a bad experience anyway.

18:21.080 --> 18:25.160
Yes, 3G is a lot slower than most people realize.

18:25.160 --> 18:31.280
Yeah, I don't think I would ever use 3G service that much, but here's the way I look at it.

18:31.280 --> 18:37.320
With a 3G one, you get an 8 gig memory card with it, and sure, yeah, you can buy that

18:37.320 --> 18:41.840
separately and you may save some money, but at the same time, it's nice to have the option

18:41.840 --> 18:46.880
that if later on you wanted to use 3G, you can, or if you are paying for 3G, say for

18:46.880 --> 18:51.120
example for an iPad, you can literally pop that SIM card out of your iPad, pop it into

18:51.120 --> 18:53.440
your Vita, and oh look, it works.

18:53.440 --> 18:54.440
Nice tip.

18:54.440 --> 18:59.680
Yes, and you don't have to worry about paying extra money for it, and who knows what kind

18:59.680 --> 19:02.160
of exploits and stuff they'll have for that type of stuff later on.

19:02.160 --> 19:05.760
I want to give you another really good tip on the Vita, and that is remote play.

19:05.760 --> 19:10.640
Now remote play already existed on the PSP, but now that you're seeing it on the Vita,

19:10.640 --> 19:15.360
I really feel like I'm looking at the Wii U technology already with this Vita and the

19:15.360 --> 19:19.920
remote play, because over remote play, I can turn on my PlayStation 3 when I'm lying in

19:19.920 --> 19:25.240
my bed with the Vita, I can turn on the PlayStation 3, go in there, I can play the PS1 games.

19:25.240 --> 19:30.600
Because right now you can't download a PS1 game to your Vita, you can't, like they don't

19:30.600 --> 19:34.680
have that functionality in there yet, I'm assuming they're going to add it, but what

19:34.680 --> 19:39.600
you can do is if the games are on your PlayStation 3, you fire up remote play, and you can stream

19:39.600 --> 19:44.200
it, and it's like what they're advertising on the Wii U, you're getting the little game

19:44.200 --> 19:45.200
in there.

19:45.200 --> 19:49.860
Now granted, I have several games, and I don't think Umjama Lamy would be a great idea to

19:49.860 --> 19:53.720
play over remote play, because music, game, lag, death, right?

19:53.720 --> 20:00.560
Final Fantasy 5, or something that, you know, the lag isn't going to be a big deal, is great.

20:00.560 --> 20:03.360
And I love the fact, and one of the things I was hoping that they would do, and they

20:03.360 --> 20:08.660
actually did, was mapping the extra buttons, and before with the PlayStation Portable,

20:08.660 --> 20:14.360
you had your L2, R2, and stuff mapped to one of the analogs, which is really dumb, and

20:14.360 --> 20:18.400
they have it still where you can do that, where you can hold select and then push a

20:18.400 --> 20:23.120
directional button or something like that, and it does one of those, or you can actually

20:23.120 --> 20:27.280
map it to your back touchpad, which is fantastic.

20:27.280 --> 20:28.280
It's great.

20:28.280 --> 20:33.160
Your L2, R2, and L3, R3 are on there, so it's great.

20:33.160 --> 20:37.120
I will put it this way though, I'm going to be really looking at that Wii U price point

20:37.120 --> 20:43.480
even closer now, because we can see that the technology is absolutely possible, absolutely

20:43.480 --> 20:49.280
possible, with a $200 PlayStation 3, and what is right now a $250 Vita.

20:49.280 --> 20:54.880
That's $450 for this technology, and I got to say, this Vita, probably a lot better than

20:54.880 --> 20:57.120
that tablet controller that Wii U is coming with.

20:57.120 --> 21:04.280
So there is no possible way, there is no possible, possible way that Wii U can get away with

21:04.280 --> 21:08.640
charging $450, and I would argue, there is no way that Wii U can get away with charging

21:08.640 --> 21:09.640
$400.

21:09.640 --> 21:14.000
And in fact, I think the bar needs to go even lower.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.440
And if they try to blame the technology, absolute utter total bullshit.

21:17.440 --> 21:20.060
We're looking at it right now with the Vita and the PlayStation 3.

21:20.060 --> 21:23.320
The Nintendo, if they want to win with the Wii U, they've got to be able to deliver this

21:23.320 --> 21:27.080
technology cheaper, and they've got to integrate it a little bit better, because right now

21:27.080 --> 21:30.560
there is no, you know, besides what I just mentioned, there's not a whole lot to do with

21:30.560 --> 21:31.700
remote play.

21:31.700 --> 21:36.020
But then again, it just came out, like, you know, a couple days ago.

21:36.020 --> 21:39.780
That's true, and Sony is very good at adding features.

21:39.780 --> 21:40.780
And I got to say-

21:40.780 --> 21:43.280
They saved the PS3 through some of that.

21:43.280 --> 21:47.040
You know, what can I say, you know, out of the box, I have a web browser.

21:47.040 --> 21:51.620
I didn't have to wait months for a patch to unlock the web browser function, which that

21:51.620 --> 21:53.620
web browser was terrible in the 3DS.

21:53.620 --> 21:57.580
But the Vita, but we have to be fair, and the Vita is missing some things it should

21:57.580 --> 21:58.580
have.

21:58.580 --> 22:01.560
Like, the whole fact that it doesn't play PS1 games right now when the PSP did it, that's

22:01.560 --> 22:04.240
a little like, what, what?

22:04.240 --> 22:08.360
I mean, you can do it through remote play, but it's a little weird that that's not there.

22:08.360 --> 22:12.560
They probably haven't built a new, they probably haven't built a new emulator for it, and they

22:12.560 --> 22:17.020
could probably do it emulating the PSP, emulating the PlayStation 1, which would be weird.

22:17.020 --> 22:21.200
But they probably want to see if they can improve upon it, make it, you know, hey, look,

22:21.200 --> 22:24.700
the graphics look nicer, or something like that.

22:24.700 --> 22:28.200
So anyhow, I'll talk a little more about Vita games when we get to my gaming week.

22:28.200 --> 22:31.560
I want to go around, we always start off the show with how was your gaming week, I guess

22:31.560 --> 22:33.480
we've kind of already been doing that.

22:33.480 --> 22:35.240
But maybe there's stuff not on the Vita.

22:35.240 --> 22:36.600
We'll start with Dark Sakura.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.880
Well, I played well.

22:38.880 --> 22:39.880
Addict.

22:39.880 --> 22:40.880
Dealer.

22:40.880 --> 22:46.320
And I made a new friend, so I'd like to give a shout out to Renee, who I asked to listen

22:46.320 --> 22:47.320
to tonight.

22:47.320 --> 22:48.320
Hi, Renee.

22:48.320 --> 22:49.320
Hi.

22:49.320 --> 22:56.960
Um, I, uh, I was gonna play some Portal 2, I played a lot of Being Pissed Off.

22:56.960 --> 23:00.680
So like, this is the problem I had, you know how, like, you have 50 million channels and

23:00.680 --> 23:02.240
nothing's on?

23:02.240 --> 23:07.920
I was looking at the collection, because we had some Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3, which

23:07.920 --> 23:12.680
mostly was Dan playing and screaming at the TV, because Galactus, even on Super Easy,

23:12.680 --> 23:13.680
is a cheap bitch.

23:13.680 --> 23:19.240
So, um, but I was looking at all, at the games, and I was like, I don't want to play this,

23:19.240 --> 23:21.720
I don't want to play this, I don't want to play this, I don't want to play this.

23:21.720 --> 23:23.680
Where is Blue Dragon?

23:23.680 --> 23:27.480
And I could not find Blue Dragon, and I was mad, and I wanted to...

23:27.480 --> 23:28.480
Do you want to borrow mine?

23:28.480 --> 23:30.480
I have the game.

23:30.480 --> 23:31.480
Okay.

23:31.480 --> 23:32.480
So then I was like...

23:32.480 --> 23:35.100
Haven't touched mine in two years, Steve.

23:35.100 --> 23:38.560
So then I was like, I'm gonna play BlazBlue.

23:38.560 --> 23:39.560
What?

23:39.560 --> 23:40.560
It's not open?

23:40.560 --> 23:44.960
Crap, because I don't like to open things that, you know, aren't already open.

23:44.960 --> 23:47.680
So then I was like, I'm gonna play Jumping Flash.

23:47.680 --> 23:51.720
And I could not find Jumping Flash, even though it was probably right in front of me.

23:51.720 --> 23:54.320
So I was like, I'm just not gonna play anything, and I took a nap.

23:54.320 --> 23:57.600
I'm just surprised that you couldn't see those old PlayStation 1 cases, they were the size

23:57.600 --> 23:59.120
of, like, a small house.

23:59.120 --> 24:05.280
We have them in the back room, and keep in mind, we have the cases that size also encompass

24:05.280 --> 24:12.320
our Sega Saturn collection, encompass the Sega CD collection, and we have a bunch of

24:12.320 --> 24:13.320
early PS1 games.

24:13.320 --> 24:16.920
You gotta take me back to this whole, why you didn't want to open BlazBlue, though.

24:16.920 --> 24:20.320
I'm not sure I get that, because you guys bought it, so why not open it?

24:20.320 --> 24:22.200
You can't take it back to Walmart at this point, can you?

24:22.200 --> 24:26.840
No, just because I was like, that means I have to open it, and then I'll have to, you

24:26.840 --> 24:27.840
know, try to...

24:27.840 --> 24:28.840
Oh, that evil Shrinkrap.

24:28.840 --> 24:31.680
Yeah, I was like, I don't want to open this.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.680
It is pretty tough.

24:33.680 --> 24:37.560
And then it's gonna get staticky and stick to my hand, and I was like, I don't want to.

24:37.560 --> 24:40.800
That is the ultimate laziest thing I've ever heard in my entire life.

24:40.800 --> 24:41.800
Shut up.

24:41.800 --> 24:42.800
Congratulations.

24:42.800 --> 24:43.920
You know, I finally opened my copy of...

24:43.920 --> 24:48.840
Because it ended with, and then I took a nap.

24:48.840 --> 24:54.520
The Shrinkrap monster proved too difficult that I went to go take a nap.

24:54.520 --> 24:55.960
I'm just calling it like I see it.

24:55.960 --> 24:57.640
You know I love you, but damn you lazy.

24:57.640 --> 24:59.120
Rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub,

24:59.120 --> 25:00.120
rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub.

25:00.120 --> 25:01.120
I was tired anyways to bite me.

25:01.120 --> 25:04.520
But, oh God, what else was it that I was...

25:04.520 --> 25:08.640
It was like I wanted to play certain things and I couldn't find them and I was frustrated.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.560
So then I was gonna play Project Diva.

25:10.560 --> 25:17.360
No, no, no, no, there's more, because remember I was loaned by one of our lovely listeners,

25:17.360 --> 25:18.360
Project Diva.

25:18.360 --> 25:19.520
Oh, right, right, right.

25:19.520 --> 25:22.280
And I could not find our PSP charger.

25:22.280 --> 25:25.520
I tore up everything and Dan's like, oh, it's in the bin.

25:25.520 --> 25:27.920
Actually, I think it's at my mom's house.

25:27.920 --> 25:30.120
Would you like to borrow our PSP charger?

25:30.120 --> 25:34.880
Because I have one of these now, so I don't know when I'll be using the PSP again.

25:34.880 --> 25:35.880
Sure.

25:35.880 --> 25:38.440
Or are you gonna take a nap instead?

25:38.440 --> 25:39.440
You know what?

25:39.440 --> 25:46.000
I had a really bad day, but I also downloaded a new game on my iPhone, but I haven't tried

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
it yet.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
I downloaded it on Name Alone.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
It's called Star Mine.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.360
Oh, like the old Bimani story game.

25:52.360 --> 25:53.360
Yeah, some puzzle game.

25:53.360 --> 25:55.960
I also did play Castlevania the Puzzle.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.920
Freaking sucks on the iPhone.

25:57.920 --> 26:01.560
You cannot, it's like, oh, we're gonna show both of the screens at the same time.

26:01.560 --> 26:05.320
No, it doesn't work because you have to move it with your fingers and the little blocks

26:05.320 --> 26:09.480
are too small and then, oh, sorry, you're just gonna drop the ball.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.040
You know the only good thing about that?

26:11.040 --> 26:12.040
The music.

26:12.040 --> 26:13.640
That's it.

26:13.640 --> 26:18.040
And you know, Dracula being a pimp.

26:18.040 --> 26:22.120
Techness in our chatroom at chat.orangesondready.com says about your story, sounds like a great

26:22.120 --> 26:24.060
first world problem, ma'am.

26:24.060 --> 26:32.160
You know, I would like to see an F.U. comic on Jamie's story.

26:32.160 --> 26:33.440
That's not shrink wrap.

26:33.440 --> 26:34.440
F.U.

26:34.440 --> 26:37.200
Actually, you know how my brain translates that?

26:37.200 --> 26:42.380
I hear it phonetically.

26:42.380 --> 26:43.740
That's how my brain translates that.

26:43.740 --> 26:45.760
You sound like a scary monster.

26:45.760 --> 26:47.760
Don't do that.

26:47.760 --> 26:52.080
Loki, how was your gaming week?

26:52.080 --> 26:56.680
I played some of the beta stuff, basically.

26:56.680 --> 26:58.800
Call of Duty, more of that.

26:58.800 --> 27:05.360
We got a sixth person in on our games now, so it's more than merry, you know?

27:05.360 --> 27:07.600
I played more Luminous.

27:07.600 --> 27:12.680
Although, see, during the week, there was more rumors that some of those demos might

27:12.680 --> 27:16.200
have been full games, so I had to clear some space off.

27:16.200 --> 27:22.760
And I accidentally, well, I deleted my, you know how I installed some stuff for each game

27:22.760 --> 27:24.480
that you pop in there so you have little icons of?

27:24.480 --> 27:25.480
I deleted one of those.

27:25.480 --> 27:29.680
Apparently, that also deletes your save for Luminous or whatever, so I deleted my save

27:29.680 --> 27:30.680
for Luminous.

27:30.680 --> 27:33.680
Apparently, that's because it said, oh, hey, you started playing Luminous for the first

27:33.680 --> 27:34.680
time.

27:34.680 --> 27:35.680
I'm like, no, I haven't.

27:35.680 --> 27:36.680
I've played it before.

27:36.680 --> 27:39.940
If you clear your system settings, the same thing happens where it's all, you just played

27:39.940 --> 27:40.940
Luminous for the first time.

27:40.940 --> 27:41.940
Liar.

27:41.940 --> 27:49.680
Even before that, though, I had some weird stuff where it wouldn't get any XP for the

27:49.680 --> 27:53.960
stuff that I did, so that was a little funky.

27:53.960 --> 27:58.840
And then, see, played more Rayman Origins, which is pretty fun, but I don't know.

27:58.840 --> 28:02.500
I don't have the patience to kind of play through that whole game, because I'm busy

28:02.500 --> 28:04.840
with a bunch of other stuff right now.

28:04.840 --> 28:10.760
But it looks fun, and I had fun with it for the little bit that I played it.

28:10.760 --> 28:15.440
Kind of myself, the completionists on that stuff have to go back and finish all the challenges

28:15.440 --> 28:16.440
and everything.

28:16.440 --> 28:19.160
They have time challenges, and they've kind of figured out some tricks with that.

28:19.160 --> 28:23.400
There's a dash move you can do that makes you move faster, which is kind of cool.

28:23.400 --> 28:31.960
And then, and that game still looks really gorgeous, Beat Touch My Katamari, or at least

28:31.960 --> 28:39.000
I finished the last level in the game, and I kind of don't want to buy any more Katamari

28:39.000 --> 28:44.720
games anymore, because they just all, it's kind of disappointing, because they're not,

28:44.720 --> 28:46.920
they're never as good as like the first few games.

28:46.920 --> 28:47.920
It's like kind of like-

28:47.920 --> 28:50.280
They're whipping that same horse over and over and over again.

28:50.280 --> 28:53.560
It's seriously, the last level was kind of terrible.

28:53.560 --> 28:57.280
It was kind of like, you know, some of the older games where it's like, okay, you start

28:57.280 --> 29:01.600
off really small, and then eventually you're rolling up the continents and like the planets

29:01.600 --> 29:02.600
and stuff like that.

29:02.600 --> 29:07.320
You know, that was epic, but this was like, okay, and I went to some psycho land that

29:07.320 --> 29:11.840
everything's rainbow and I'm starting to roll up some of that stuff, and it was just really

29:11.840 --> 29:16.780
weird for a Katamari game even.

29:16.780 --> 29:24.320
And then I unlocked some of the Eternal stages for those, which you get candy for that stuff

29:24.320 --> 29:27.860
too, so I don't know why you wouldn't do the Eternal stages.

29:27.860 --> 29:35.320
So I did those and I bought the King of Cosmos some new clothes, because he wanted some really

29:35.320 --> 29:39.880
flamboyant stuff, so I made him even more flamboyant, if that's possible.

29:39.880 --> 29:43.560
Yeah, my favorite is that the first thing he asked me for was a bridal cape.

29:43.560 --> 29:45.880
Yes, that's the one I got for him, the bridal cape.

29:45.880 --> 29:53.000
I'm like, okay, everybody has their thing, I'm not one to judge.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.680
Exactly, it was just really weird.

29:55.680 --> 30:00.900
So I did that, and then, what else did I play?

30:00.900 --> 30:04.280
I didn't play Little Deviants yet, because I really don't want to play that game, looks

30:04.280 --> 30:05.280
like crap.

30:05.280 --> 30:08.680
I actually played some of the Welcome Park stuff and tried to unlock trophies in that.

30:08.680 --> 30:11.040
Some of those games are actually kind of hard.

30:11.040 --> 30:15.720
The Welcome Park stuff for built-in games is, you know, it's alright.

30:15.720 --> 30:19.640
I gotta ask you, did you try some of those AR games?

30:19.640 --> 30:20.640
Not yet.

30:20.640 --> 30:23.760
I did, and I don't like them.

30:23.760 --> 30:26.640
No, seriously, they don't function well at all.

30:26.640 --> 30:33.720
And I mean, okay, let's be honest, your apartment, my house and stuff, maybe playing at night

30:33.720 --> 30:37.880
with just lights on, not the best lighting for these games.

30:37.880 --> 30:42.040
But it kept getting, especially on the soccer, actually almost all the games, I only played

30:42.040 --> 30:44.560
the soccer and the fireworks one.

30:44.560 --> 30:47.800
And I didn't even really play the soccer game, because I couldn't get it past building the

30:47.800 --> 30:53.760
field and going through the motions of how to play the game, because first off, it wouldn't

30:53.760 --> 30:57.440
register my movements well, which kind of sucked.

30:57.440 --> 31:02.840
And second, I kept getting this out of range error, and I'm not that far away from this

31:02.840 --> 31:03.840
stuff.

31:03.840 --> 31:08.240
I mean, I may be like three feet away from the actual cards, which I think is pretty

31:08.240 --> 31:11.680
reasonable, but it just wasn't working.

31:11.680 --> 31:16.400
And then the fireworks one was kind of neat, but the game's kind of dumb.

31:16.400 --> 31:20.520
And once again, I was getting the out of range error, even though I could see all the cards

31:20.520 --> 31:24.720
through the screen, so I don't know what the issue was there.

31:24.720 --> 31:28.720
But I mean, I'm sure it's just some bugs, they'll get worked out.

31:28.720 --> 31:34.760
Even in the hands of the games, they're free, so whatever.

31:34.760 --> 31:35.760
What else?

31:35.760 --> 31:39.760
Oh, I tried the Unit 13 demo, that was actually pretty good, I like that.

31:39.760 --> 31:43.200
Not my type of game, really, I'm not really huge into the SOCOM.

31:43.200 --> 31:48.200
It's like SOCOM, it's somebody that does Zipper Interactive, it's a third person squad shooter

31:48.200 --> 31:49.440
game.

31:49.440 --> 31:50.440
And it's okay.

31:50.440 --> 31:51.440
Those tend to sell pretty well.

31:51.440 --> 31:53.920
Yeah, it's alright, but it's not my...

31:53.920 --> 31:59.320
I'm not really into that, you know, Resistance, no, the new Resistance game, I'm definitely

31:59.320 --> 32:05.280
gonna be picking up, probably, but this one was not too big for me.

32:05.280 --> 32:09.160
Gripper01 in our chatroom says, the Vita needs a decent pinball game.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.860
Good call.

32:10.860 --> 32:14.320
I don't see why there won't be a pinball FX on it soon enough.

32:14.320 --> 32:15.320
That actually reminds me.

32:15.320 --> 32:16.320
Huh.

32:16.320 --> 32:18.960
I forgot to mention, we sold Lord of the Rings.

32:18.960 --> 32:19.960
Oh.

32:19.960 --> 32:21.480
Bye, Lord of the Rings.

32:21.480 --> 32:22.480
Yep.

32:22.480 --> 32:23.480
Just saying.

32:23.480 --> 32:24.480
I mean, it just is gone.

32:24.480 --> 32:25.480
Thank God.

32:25.480 --> 32:26.480
That's right.

32:26.480 --> 32:27.480
I mean, I'm tired of that game.

32:27.480 --> 32:29.880
Did you take it to Mount Mordor, or is it...

32:29.880 --> 32:31.680
No, Sauron came and picked it up.

32:31.680 --> 32:33.840
He was really nice, too, very personable guy.

32:33.840 --> 32:38.400
What does not simply multi-ball into, Mel?

32:38.400 --> 32:42.400
I will say this, if they do put out pinball FX on the Vita, I think that would be a great

32:42.400 --> 32:49.280
game for the rear touchpad, to use the blippers, and you could turn it so it's a long screen

32:49.280 --> 32:50.280
instead of the wide screen.

32:50.280 --> 32:56.240
I mean, you know, those guys that designed pinball FX, they've already done games on

32:56.240 --> 32:59.760
wide screen televisions, and they work fine, but imagine with the Vita, you could turn

32:59.760 --> 33:02.320
it the other way, and that'd be a pretty kick butt screen.

33:02.320 --> 33:09.640
There were some import shooters from Japan that were using the long screen for the PSP

33:09.640 --> 33:12.180
back in the day, so I'd be down for that.

33:12.180 --> 33:17.400
I really do feel like there's more potential to be unlocked with the Vita, but to be fair,

33:17.400 --> 33:22.680
the 3DS has done a pretty good job of unlocking more as we go, too.

33:22.680 --> 33:27.600
So it's on now, so there you go.

33:27.600 --> 33:28.600
What else for your gaming week?

33:28.600 --> 33:29.600
Anything?

33:29.600 --> 33:30.600
That was it.

33:30.600 --> 33:34.520
All right, well, Loki already mentioned Touch My Katamari, which was another...

33:34.520 --> 33:38.120
One thing real quick, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, real quick, just one thing I just wanted

33:38.120 --> 33:41.560
to mention that was absent from my gaming week, and that was the new download content

33:41.560 --> 33:45.840
for Saints Row the Third, because I am not buying into this bullshit download content

33:45.840 --> 33:48.080
crap that they're putting out these really terrible pieces of...

33:48.080 --> 33:49.080
Ooh, what happened?

33:49.080 --> 33:50.080
It did not good?

33:50.080 --> 33:54.840
Well, the last one they put out was really short, and it was $7 for about an hour's worth

33:54.840 --> 33:59.640
of content, and it was just kind of like cheap bullshit.

33:59.640 --> 34:00.640
So I waited.

34:00.640 --> 34:03.960
I waited to hear the reviews on it, and sure enough, someone's like, oh yeah, I beat it

34:03.960 --> 34:04.960
in 30 minutes.

34:04.960 --> 34:05.960
$7 still.

34:05.960 --> 34:06.960
Yes.

34:06.960 --> 34:07.960
Fuck that.

34:07.960 --> 34:08.960
No, I'm not doing it.

34:08.960 --> 34:09.960
That's too bad.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.840
Saints Row had a lot going for it when it first came out.

34:11.840 --> 34:13.400
They kind of ruined it, so...

34:13.400 --> 34:14.400
That's too bad.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.800
All right.

34:16.800 --> 34:17.800
My gaming week.

34:17.800 --> 34:19.280
I also played Touch My Katamari.

34:19.280 --> 34:24.920
I feel similarly to where Loki's at, you know, like, oh yeah, I like Katamari, it's a good

34:24.920 --> 34:27.600
game, but it's been kind of the same damn game.

34:27.600 --> 34:30.480
It's kind of like Sonic the Hedgehog coming out on every platform.

34:30.480 --> 34:36.960
You're like, oh, it's Sonic, I used to love this game, and I'm playing it again, and again,

34:36.960 --> 34:41.580
I'm playing the same game again, and nothing's changed, and now the nostalgia's worn off,

34:41.580 --> 34:43.080
and I think I'm done now.

34:43.080 --> 34:44.080
Yeah.

34:44.080 --> 34:47.920
I also played Sonic the Hedgehog on PlayStation 3 this week, for real.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.080
It was one of the free PlayStation Plus games.

34:50.080 --> 34:55.840
PlayStation Plus is having this whole, like, Genesis nostalgia fest thing going on, so

34:55.840 --> 34:59.360
whatever, which is weird, because yes, I have the Sonic Mega Genesis collection, so you

34:59.360 --> 35:03.360
might be thinking, why are you wasting the space on your hard drive to download it?

35:03.360 --> 35:06.000
And my answer is, trophies.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.760
I must have trophies.

35:08.760 --> 35:13.080
So I tried to unlock some trophies, and one game I will say I unlocked a shit ton of trophies

35:13.080 --> 35:18.400
in is Altered Beast, which I also played this week, but RISE FROM YOUR GRAVE.

35:18.400 --> 35:24.600
Okay, if there isn't a game that we have seen through thicker rose-colored glasses in our

35:24.600 --> 35:29.260
lives, it's Altered Beast, because I'll tell you what, I remember being a kid thinking

35:29.260 --> 35:37.640
that game was badass, and it was in the arcade for 25 cents for a few minute thrill, but

35:37.640 --> 35:42.120
what they decided to port over on the, you know, PlayStation 3, which granted is the

35:42.120 --> 35:49.760
exact same thing they have on Xbox Live Arcade, was the Genesis version, which, at the time,

35:49.760 --> 35:55.880
was great, but now it looks a lot like Pac-Man on the Atari 2600.

35:55.880 --> 36:03.200
I mean, it is, it's bad, it's a bad game, and some of the horrible noises it was making

36:03.200 --> 36:09.360
made me think my PlayStation 3 was about to spontaneously combust, and I asked you, have

36:09.360 --> 36:15.200
any of you actually played Altered Beast to Stage 5 all the way to the last stage of the

36:15.200 --> 36:16.200
game?

36:16.200 --> 36:17.200
Yes.

36:17.200 --> 36:24.080
What in the fuck are those unicorn tranny monsters that beat me with their high heels?

36:24.080 --> 36:29.720
I was like, what is this, I can't even, because like most people, let's be real, we remember

36:29.720 --> 36:34.640
Altered Beast to Stage 2 before we ran out of quarters.

36:34.640 --> 36:40.840
So you're saying unicorn tranny monsters, they're Altered Beasts.

36:40.840 --> 36:48.360
Look, I'm just, before you send in the hate mail and say, no, no, no, no.

36:48.360 --> 36:50.680
I'm finding pictures of them for everybody.

36:50.680 --> 36:56.760
I'm telling you, these unicorn monsters are, are, are a little funky, like it's just, what

36:56.760 --> 36:57.760
is this?

36:57.760 --> 36:58.760
Who designed this?

36:58.760 --> 36:59.760
I can't even.

36:59.760 --> 37:04.400
So yeah, I played Altered Beast all the way to the end, got my trophy, then promptly

37:04.400 --> 37:09.240
deleted it from my hard drive because damn, that's a bad game.

37:09.240 --> 37:16.800
Um, otherwise, more wow, more Final Fantasy 13 tube and trying to get a little further

37:16.800 --> 37:17.800
in that.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.240
And that's about the extent of my week.

37:19.240 --> 37:20.240
I mean, I did have the Vita.

37:20.240 --> 37:22.920
I literally played Luminous, like nothing but Luminous one night.

37:22.920 --> 37:26.380
I thought Stage 5 was the Rhino monsters.

37:26.380 --> 37:30.040
Is there a stage missing in the Genesis version?

37:30.040 --> 37:36.280
It's the hell level and you turn into the exact same monster you were in level one.

37:36.280 --> 37:42.600
So Tigerclaw in our chatroom at chat.orangelandtranny.com says Altered Beast is in need of a serious

37:42.600 --> 37:43.600
reboot.

37:43.600 --> 37:45.320
I'd be down with that.

37:45.320 --> 37:46.600
A serious reboot.

37:46.600 --> 37:47.600
Yes.

37:47.600 --> 37:50.920
I mean, there's some pretty cool concepts in Altered Beast, but those levels became

37:50.920 --> 37:53.040
laughably easy once you became the Beast.

37:53.040 --> 37:54.120
It's just kind of getting there.

37:54.120 --> 37:56.480
It can be a pain in the ass sometimes.

37:56.480 --> 38:01.020
So all right, anyhow, that's it for my gaming week.

38:01.020 --> 38:03.600
So let's talk about housekeeping.

38:03.600 --> 38:07.080
Join us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, or you can join us on Twitter

38:07.080 --> 38:08.080
as well.

38:08.080 --> 38:09.080
Twitter.com slash O.L.R.

38:09.080 --> 38:11.320
Get in your tweets for tonight's show.

38:11.320 --> 38:15.720
Um, as far as I can tell, we don't have any shows off planned in the next few weeks.

38:15.720 --> 38:18.680
So O.L.R. every Sunday for a little while.

38:18.680 --> 38:22.560
Let's get into some gaming news and what is going on in the gaming world this week.

38:22.560 --> 38:24.040
Loki's going to start it off.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.040
Yes.

38:25.040 --> 38:30.760
So I'm going to start off by talking about, um, one of the, what was it, what project

38:30.760 --> 38:31.760
did they call that?

38:31.760 --> 38:36.680
It was, uh, no, not downpour.

38:36.680 --> 38:39.400
That whole like campaign to get those really awesome.

38:39.400 --> 38:40.400
Operation rainfall.

38:40.400 --> 38:41.400
That's right.

38:41.400 --> 38:45.760
I was thinking downpour, project downpour, that downpour would be the new Silent Hill

38:45.760 --> 38:46.760
title.

38:46.760 --> 38:47.760
Uh, yes.

38:47.760 --> 38:48.760
Operation rainfall.

38:48.760 --> 38:56.280
Um, so the last story has been confirmed to be coming to North America in 2012, well,

38:56.280 --> 39:03.940
summer 2012, well, June 19th, 2012, um, and it's actually, it's kind of cool.

39:03.940 --> 39:08.360
It's not going to be one of those, oh, you have to buy the GameStop directly from Nintendo.

39:08.360 --> 39:12.360
It's actually being ported over by XSeed, um, which is probably going to have the easiest

39:12.360 --> 39:18.580
localization job ever because it's going to be going from English to English.

39:18.580 --> 39:22.360
So that's just money handed right to them basically.

39:22.360 --> 39:30.540
Um, so yeah, that'll be coming out later this year and is a pretty epic RPG from Mistwalker.

39:30.540 --> 39:31.960
We have a date for that?

39:31.960 --> 39:35.600
Well, they're saying summer 2012.

39:35.600 --> 39:39.240
What I've seen from XSeed is June 19th, 2012.

39:39.240 --> 39:40.800
That would be summer.

39:40.800 --> 39:41.800
That would be summer.

39:41.800 --> 39:43.900
And just in time for my birthday, yay!

39:43.900 --> 39:48.760
So I mean, dates can change, um, but June 19th.

39:48.760 --> 39:51.440
Downpour, by the way, was a Silent Hill game.

39:51.440 --> 39:52.920
I think you got confused there, Rain.

39:52.920 --> 39:56.720
No, I said downpour is the next Silent Hill game that's coming out.

39:56.720 --> 39:57.720
Just looking at the chatroom.

39:57.720 --> 39:59.960
Alan Wake's Silent Hill-ish game.

39:59.960 --> 40:00.960
Yeah, exactly.

40:00.960 --> 40:01.960
Alan Hill.

40:01.960 --> 40:02.960
All right.

40:02.960 --> 40:03.960
Um, hey, what now?

40:03.960 --> 40:04.960
Are you at all interested?

40:04.960 --> 40:05.960
I found the picture, by the way.

40:05.960 --> 40:06.960
Silent Hill game.

40:06.960 --> 40:10.480
Oh, let me see this scary, hold on, we'll come back to that.

40:10.480 --> 40:12.000
Yes.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.400
What are those things?

40:13.400 --> 40:14.400
Chain it to me.

40:14.400 --> 40:15.400
Uh.

40:15.400 --> 40:16.400
I have no idea.

40:16.400 --> 40:17.400
They're trainicorns.

40:17.400 --> 40:20.640
Get that on the Tumblr so the podcast listeners can refer to this.

40:20.640 --> 40:22.320
I'll give it to Ron Med to do it.

40:22.320 --> 40:23.320
Thank you.

40:23.320 --> 40:26.360
Because I want the podcasters, er, podcast-y listeners to be able to see this too if they're

40:26.360 --> 40:27.360
not live.

40:27.360 --> 40:28.720
Anyhow, where were we?

40:28.720 --> 40:32.360
Vita, Silent Hill, I didn't know there was an exclusive Silent Hill game on the Vita.

40:32.360 --> 40:33.360
Really?

40:33.360 --> 40:34.360
Yeah, Book of Memories.

40:34.360 --> 40:36.440
Why did I think that was a different game?

40:36.440 --> 40:37.440
I don't know.

40:37.440 --> 40:38.440
Because there's another one.

40:38.440 --> 40:39.440
Because you're hallucinating.

40:39.440 --> 40:42.920
No, no, no, because there was, like, Chain of Memory, no, not Chain of Memories, that's

40:42.920 --> 40:44.440
the, uh, Kingdom Hearts game.

40:44.440 --> 40:48.060
No, there was another, there was another game, though, that was something of Memories that

40:48.060 --> 40:51.600
was for Silent Hill, so it's a very similar title to another one.

40:51.600 --> 40:52.600
Um.

40:52.600 --> 40:53.600
But yeah.

40:53.600 --> 40:55.600
So that'll be coming out.

40:55.600 --> 40:57.760
Uh, sure, I'll, I'll at least check it out.

40:57.760 --> 41:00.240
I think I'm gonna need to rent a lot of these games.

41:00.240 --> 41:01.840
I don't have the money to buy all these games.

41:01.840 --> 41:02.840
Maybe I'll have a demo.

41:02.840 --> 41:03.840
Ah, there you go.

41:03.840 --> 41:04.840
That'll be fair.

41:04.840 --> 41:05.840
Um.

41:05.840 --> 41:07.480
I wanted to say, though, about the last story.

41:07.480 --> 41:11.240
A, I'm excited because I think Mistwalker games are pretty good.

41:11.240 --> 41:15.200
Um, you know, Blue Dragon was, eh, I know Jamie's more into it than I am.

41:15.200 --> 41:19.800
Lost Odyssey was criminally underrated on the 360, so I'm, I'm, you know, the, a happy

41:19.800 --> 41:22.240
medium between those would still be pretty good.

41:22.240 --> 41:25.240
So I, I'm looking forward to the last story on the Wii, and I'm really excited.

41:25.240 --> 41:29.040
I don't have to wait frickin' nine months to play it.

41:29.040 --> 41:34.880
That love, I love how it's, it's got almost the same font as Final Fantasy, and it's the

41:34.880 --> 41:36.320
last story.

41:36.320 --> 41:40.600
The final fan, I mean, come on, it's like, I didn't even think about a title.

41:40.600 --> 41:41.600
The last story.

41:41.600 --> 41:42.600
Ah, that sounds good.

41:42.600 --> 41:43.600
You know what?

41:43.600 --> 41:44.600
That reminds me of another game series.

41:44.600 --> 41:46.040
I can't really think of what it is, but.

41:46.040 --> 41:48.180
If the game is that good, I don't even care.

41:48.180 --> 41:49.240
I don't even care.

41:49.240 --> 41:52.240
They could have called it Dinal Dynasty, and I'd still play it.

41:52.240 --> 41:53.640
Oh, for the record.

41:53.640 --> 41:54.640
What?

41:54.640 --> 41:58.800
They're called Dark Unicorns, but this website refers to them as the Ninja Corn.

41:58.800 --> 42:01.120
Dark and fierce.

42:01.120 --> 42:02.120
The Ninja Corn.

42:02.120 --> 42:03.120
The Ninja Corn.

42:03.120 --> 42:04.120
I like, I prefer calling them the Trainicorn.

42:04.120 --> 42:05.120
Alright, anyhow.

42:05.120 --> 42:06.120
Um.

42:06.120 --> 42:11.080
So yeah, I'm looking forward to that.

42:11.080 --> 42:12.960
Interesting that Nintendo's not bringing it out themselves.

42:12.960 --> 42:17.040
This is, you know, with Xenoblade, Nintendo's doing it themselves.

42:17.040 --> 42:19.000
So this is where XSeed is doing it.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
And they did what?

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
They did like Half Minute Hero.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
They've done a few.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.340
They've done some pretty good RPGs and stuff.

42:23.340 --> 42:27.880
So I'm glad it's in their hands, because what makes me really happy, and I was getting into

42:27.880 --> 42:31.360
this on Twitter with somebody, it makes me really happy that XSeed is doing it, because

42:31.360 --> 42:36.440
this means no stupid retail exclusive agreements like we see happening with Xenoblade.

42:36.440 --> 42:38.080
And I have faith it'll go pretty well.

42:38.080 --> 42:42.160
It really does give me a reason to dust off my Nintendo Wii and check it out.

42:42.160 --> 42:45.220
Especially since you're going to have Xenoblade, and then like two months later you're going

42:45.220 --> 42:49.160
to have, you know, the last story.

42:49.160 --> 42:51.280
So I'm looking forward to that.

42:51.280 --> 42:52.280
So.

42:52.280 --> 42:56.680
Sergeant Stubby in our chat room, I love that name, wants to know where is the OLR Tumblr?

42:56.680 --> 42:57.680
Where is the OLR Tumblr?

42:57.680 --> 42:58.680
OrangeLoungeRadio.tumblr.com.

42:58.680 --> 42:59.680
Radio.tumblr.com.

42:59.680 --> 43:00.680
There you go.

43:00.680 --> 43:03.640
We also have a new one called FuckYeahCageMatch.tumblr.com.

43:03.640 --> 43:07.120
I don't remember if we said that on the podcast last week or if that was during the final

43:07.120 --> 43:11.000
Afterbirth segment, but we do have a new Tumblr called FuckYeahCageMatch, which we will be

43:11.000 --> 43:15.720
uploading songs for those that were saying, I liked it when you guys would play songs

43:15.720 --> 43:18.000
because it helped me learn new music.

43:18.000 --> 43:24.560
But we are also doing, some of our listeners have started a turntable.fm room.

43:24.560 --> 43:26.040
I love turntable.fm.

43:26.040 --> 43:28.320
And we were in there spinning last week.

43:28.320 --> 43:30.320
We were up until one o'clock in the morning.

43:30.320 --> 43:31.320
Our time.

43:31.320 --> 43:32.920
And like freaking East Coast people were still in there.

43:32.920 --> 43:33.920
I know.

43:33.920 --> 43:34.920
I was impressed.

43:34.920 --> 43:35.920
I was like, I have to sleep at some point.

43:35.920 --> 43:38.440
I don't even have a job and I have to sleep.

43:38.440 --> 43:40.080
What's going on?

43:40.080 --> 43:42.920
All right.

43:42.920 --> 43:43.920
Moving on.

43:43.920 --> 43:47.040
Let's talk about the Wii U a little bit because we mentioned it a little bit earlier in the

43:47.040 --> 43:48.040
show.

43:48.040 --> 43:49.040
Some rumors about the Wii U.

43:49.040 --> 43:54.360
Apparently this week, Adweek ran a report, Adweek is, you know, one of those magazines

43:54.360 --> 44:00.080
about what's going on, mentioning that Nintendo is talking to content providers about content

44:00.080 --> 44:01.840
for the Wii U.

44:01.840 --> 44:07.120
So think something like Comcast, because that's one of the companies Nintendo's rumored to

44:07.120 --> 44:08.840
be dealing with right now.

44:08.840 --> 44:12.800
Imagine if the whole Comcast on demand thing, or basically the exact same thing they're

44:12.800 --> 44:16.380
putting on the 360, wink, wink, comes over to the Wii U.

44:16.380 --> 44:17.960
That's what Nintendo's looking at.

44:17.960 --> 44:21.920
Now I got to say where Nintendo does have a leg up on the 360 right now is the fact

44:21.920 --> 44:26.800
that that tablet controller, that means I can start watching it and you know, I can

44:26.800 --> 44:29.160
see the commercial in my head right now.

44:29.160 --> 44:32.120
That Nintendo commercial in my head right now, they're going to be watching something

44:32.120 --> 44:33.360
on the TV.

44:33.360 --> 44:35.880
And then mom comes in and says, change the channel.

44:35.880 --> 44:38.360
I have to watch Oprah or Oprah's not on anymore.

44:38.360 --> 44:40.560
I have to watch Dr. Oz.

44:40.560 --> 44:45.120
And so the kid can take the tablet and continue watching their little show on demand into

44:45.120 --> 44:46.120
the bedroom.

44:46.120 --> 44:50.720
As long as that's 30 feet away from the actual console, well, you know, they're going to

44:50.720 --> 44:53.280
stretch the truth a little bit, whatever it is, right?

44:53.280 --> 45:00.560
So I remember, I remember the very, my very first E3 was the year they showed the DS for

45:00.560 --> 45:01.560
the very first time.

45:01.560 --> 45:05.080
And I still remember that commercial because that was a big moment.

45:05.080 --> 45:11.000
And the commercial for the DS showed a mom and a kid on Picto chat.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.340
And the mom was in the kitchen Picto chatting.

45:14.340 --> 45:16.880
It's time to come downstairs for breakfast.

45:16.880 --> 45:20.360
And the kid was like, okay, you know, like they're having a conversation on Picto chat.

45:20.360 --> 45:23.840
And I'm like, this is the most unrealistic thing I've ever seen in my life.

45:23.840 --> 45:29.720
Because if that were my house, Rob, get us ready!

45:29.720 --> 45:31.120
And I'd hear it upstairs.

45:31.120 --> 45:33.640
That's how it worked.

45:33.640 --> 45:39.280
Or if you're a good parent, please come downstairs.

45:39.280 --> 45:43.500
Or if you're a good parent, you'd have bacon cooking and then you don't need to tell people

45:43.500 --> 45:48.240
that there's, you don't even care what kind of, you know, what meal it is.

45:48.240 --> 45:49.320
It's bacon cooking.

45:49.320 --> 45:53.160
I'm coming down.

45:53.160 --> 45:58.360
In my house, it wouldn't have been anything because my mom lived in another state.

45:58.360 --> 46:01.120
I just fixed my food when I wanted it.

46:01.120 --> 46:02.120
I'm hungry.

46:02.120 --> 46:04.120
Time to make my own dinner.

46:04.120 --> 46:05.640
I had those nights too.

46:05.640 --> 46:06.640
Too busy playing Zelda.

46:06.640 --> 46:09.760
No, for me, it was too busy playing Kirby's Avalanche.

46:09.760 --> 46:14.980
All right, back to the, I don't know how he got to bacon, but leave it to the show from

46:14.980 --> 46:17.280
Nintendo and Comcast.

46:17.280 --> 46:19.000
This doesn't surprise me at all.

46:19.000 --> 46:24.560
Nintendo seems to be following a very similar path to what Xbox 360 has been doing.

46:24.560 --> 46:26.800
And you know, this is where video game systems are headed.

46:26.800 --> 46:28.240
So this is logical.

46:28.240 --> 46:33.260
I think what's honestly surprising most people in this whole thing is that Nintendo is actually

46:33.260 --> 46:37.660
kind of planning ahead for a lot of this stuff and thinking about this.

46:37.660 --> 46:41.520
That's the most surprising part is that, wait, Nintendo wants to be taken really seriously

46:41.520 --> 46:42.520
here.

46:42.520 --> 46:47.400
Well, they would be at a huge disadvantage if they have a broken old network like they

46:47.400 --> 46:48.780
have right now.

46:48.780 --> 46:51.760
So yeah, they kind of have to.

46:51.760 --> 46:54.860
Broken and old.

46:54.860 --> 46:56.520
They kind of break my old heart.

46:56.520 --> 46:57.520
All right.

46:57.520 --> 47:00.920
I was trying to find a way for it to work.

47:00.920 --> 47:01.920
That's right.

47:01.920 --> 47:06.320
Well, Sony had some fail already with the Vita.

47:06.320 --> 47:10.320
Their little Facebook app is gone from the store because it's broken.

47:10.320 --> 47:18.080
If you tried to log into it, you got an error code of NP-13144-3 and it meant you had to

47:18.080 --> 47:19.640
close the app.

47:19.640 --> 47:23.040
So they just took it down and said, we're working on it, but as for when it's going

47:23.040 --> 47:24.640
to be back up, no one said.

47:24.640 --> 47:26.880
It's only some people I think were getting that error.

47:26.880 --> 47:27.880
That's weird.

47:27.880 --> 47:28.880
Yeah.

47:28.880 --> 47:29.880
I was able to get into Facebook.

47:29.880 --> 47:30.880
Okay.

47:30.880 --> 47:31.880
In fact, I'm going to load it right now.

47:31.880 --> 47:32.880
See if it works.

47:32.880 --> 47:33.880
Yeah.

47:33.880 --> 47:37.480
They said that they're going to republish it once it's sorted, but the quote is, currently

47:37.480 --> 47:39.300
there is no timescale for this.

47:39.300 --> 47:43.560
We found out that it wasn't stealing enough user data so that we had to tweak it so that

47:43.560 --> 47:47.420
it would steal the proper amount of user data that Facebook requires.

47:47.420 --> 47:51.280
If downloading this Vita app upgraded me to timeline, I'm going to be so fucking pissed.

47:51.280 --> 47:56.120
Because you know how everything on Facebook now is like, we want you to upgrade to timeline.

47:56.120 --> 47:57.840
Turntable tried to do that to me.

47:57.840 --> 48:00.600
I updated the timeline back in September.

48:00.600 --> 48:05.960
I actually like the timeline because then I can put neat pictures up at the top.

48:05.960 --> 48:11.240
I can't read a timeline because there's some shit on the left, some shit on the right.

48:11.240 --> 48:15.280
From a design standpoint, I don't like it.

48:15.280 --> 48:17.320
I'm trying to speak Jamie's language.

48:17.320 --> 48:23.660
I have the cutest picture on mine of Dan and the baby.

48:23.660 --> 48:25.840
Not my baby.

48:25.840 --> 48:27.960
His cousin's baby.

48:27.960 --> 48:29.800
You want to make that very clear.

48:29.800 --> 48:30.800
It's a cute picture.

48:30.800 --> 48:31.800
Alright.

48:31.800 --> 48:37.200
I'm going to change it back to Thrall though, because Thrall a pimp.

48:37.200 --> 48:40.160
It is interesting that they had to pull that app so quickly after it was out, but then

48:40.160 --> 48:46.700
again if it was a security problem, okay, but I guess a login problem, I would, oh,

48:46.700 --> 48:47.700
there it is.

48:47.700 --> 48:48.700
I got the same error too.

48:48.700 --> 48:49.700
I guess I can't log in anymore.

48:49.700 --> 48:50.700
Hold on.

48:50.700 --> 48:51.700
Take a picture of it.

48:51.700 --> 48:52.700
Hold on.

48:52.700 --> 48:53.700
Oh, wait.

48:53.700 --> 48:54.700
No, you can look at it on the Vita.

48:54.700 --> 48:55.700
Watch.

48:55.700 --> 48:56.700
No.

48:56.700 --> 48:57.700
Watch.

48:57.700 --> 48:58.700
Watch.

48:58.700 --> 48:59.700
I just took a picture of the screen just like that.

48:59.700 --> 49:00.700
You suck.

49:00.700 --> 49:01.700
I just read about that the other day.

49:01.700 --> 49:02.700
That's pretty cool.

49:02.700 --> 49:05.600
Now I can tweet that if I want to.

49:05.600 --> 49:10.640
I can't email the picture to myself, which would be far too obvious, but anyway, I can

49:10.640 --> 49:11.640
tweet it.

49:11.640 --> 49:12.640
Here's another fun fact.

49:12.640 --> 49:16.000
Did you know that your Vita can receive text messages?

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
I didn't.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Well, you have a 3G one, right?

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
Uh, yeah.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
Yes.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
It can receive text messages.

49:22.000 --> 49:25.640
You won't get any notifications, I think, but you can't send text messages.

49:25.640 --> 49:32.320
The reason that is because your Vita has a phone number assigned to it because it has

49:32.320 --> 49:36.520
a SIM card and SIM cards have phone numbers assigned to them, so you can actually text

49:36.520 --> 49:42.920
your Vita and you'll get a message saying, you know, this is from the operator, like

49:42.920 --> 49:43.920
the matrix.

49:43.920 --> 49:45.080
Operator.

49:45.080 --> 49:48.760
I will say this though, I do really like the Twitter app.

49:48.760 --> 49:53.320
It's a little bit slow to load some of the tweets compared to the iPhone one, but I got

49:53.320 --> 49:57.880
to say the way it's designed is great because I love, it's the first one I've really seen

49:57.880 --> 50:01.780
that has those little picture previews right there in the bar, like on the side.

50:01.780 --> 50:05.160
So when people post links to pictures or YouTube, you can see it without having to actually

50:05.160 --> 50:07.700
like click on it like you do in the web browser and all that.

50:07.700 --> 50:10.640
So I just tweeted it.

50:10.640 --> 50:14.780
I put it on my personal account at SKIE on Twitter, Skye.

50:14.780 --> 50:16.600
That's pretty cool.

50:16.600 --> 50:19.200
That is one thing I do kind of like about the Vita, you can kind of do those screenshots

50:19.200 --> 50:20.200
and do that.

50:20.200 --> 50:24.560
Jamie trying to get her iPhone hovered just at the right angle above my screen.

50:24.560 --> 50:27.860
All right, anyhow, let's move on, more news.

50:27.860 --> 50:31.760
Something else that was kind of borked on the PlayStation Vita was that the PlayStation

50:31.760 --> 50:37.800
Plus minis that you get actually don't work on the Vita and apparently they're working

50:37.800 --> 50:44.240
on fixing that problem, but right now you can't play those free games that you unlock

50:44.240 --> 50:47.320
with the PlayStation Plus membership.

50:47.320 --> 50:50.840
So that's got to suck now, right Rob?

50:50.840 --> 50:57.160
Because you got a PlayStation Plus membership to check out some of those minis.

50:57.160 --> 50:58.640
I'm not missing that much.

50:58.640 --> 51:01.320
Okay, I downloaded this one that's free this week.

51:01.320 --> 51:02.320
What is it called?

51:02.320 --> 51:04.800
Like Hungry Giraffe or something like that?

51:04.800 --> 51:08.800
All it is is this big giraffe neck that goes up the screen and you drive it left and right

51:08.800 --> 51:10.120
to pick up fruit.

51:10.120 --> 51:15.840
And then like those other things, they're very basic, simple, simple games.

51:15.840 --> 51:19.640
For what they are, they're supposed to be basics.

51:19.640 --> 51:21.000
That's why they're minis.

51:21.000 --> 51:25.560
So for what they are, they're not terrible, but I'm not crying over the fact that I can't

51:25.560 --> 51:28.160
play them right now because I know Sony's going to fix it.

51:28.160 --> 51:31.540
You know, this is part of what happens when you have the early adopter.

51:31.540 --> 51:34.240
Does it make them look a little stupid for having it happen?

51:34.240 --> 51:35.240
Yeah.

51:35.240 --> 51:36.680
But am I going to throw a fit over it?

51:36.680 --> 51:37.680
No.

51:37.680 --> 51:41.200
I'm going to throw a fit over this and Katamari and the PSP games to keep me busy.

51:41.200 --> 51:42.200
I'll be fine.

51:42.200 --> 51:43.200
All right.

51:43.200 --> 51:48.800
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

51:48.800 --> 51:50.640
There's some other timeline haters in our chatroom.

51:50.640 --> 51:53.360
Shadow Charlie says, timeline is garbage.

51:53.360 --> 51:55.160
It's going to be mandatory in a few weeks.

51:55.160 --> 51:57.120
Yeah, I keep hearing about that.

51:57.120 --> 52:01.360
I'm not the most enthusiastic Facebook user right now.

52:01.360 --> 52:02.840
Other comments from our chatroom.

52:02.840 --> 52:08.480
Brad from our friends at Pod Culture says, Rob, I'm not a fan of the theme of the Twitter

52:08.480 --> 52:10.760
app, but the functionality is nice.

52:10.760 --> 52:14.760
Yeah, it would be nice if you could like change the colors up a little bit or kind of put

52:14.760 --> 52:15.760
your own designs on it.

52:15.760 --> 52:16.760
But maybe in a future version.

52:16.760 --> 52:17.760
Who knows?

52:17.760 --> 52:18.760
It's still early.

52:18.760 --> 52:20.960
It's not like they can't release a new version later.

52:20.960 --> 52:25.200
Bobby Blackwolf says, the only thing I dislike is that the Twitter app won't upload pics

52:25.200 --> 52:28.820
to Twitpik, only to Twitter's official photo thing.

52:28.820 --> 52:29.820
That's a good point.

52:29.820 --> 52:32.640
You can't really choose your service on the Vita client.

52:32.640 --> 52:35.200
It's all the official one.

52:35.200 --> 52:39.960
So I haven't really messed much with that Flickr app either.

52:39.960 --> 52:41.000
That looked a little weird.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.280
I downloaded it and it was really weird.

52:44.280 --> 52:48.560
Like I don't really use Flickr, but the way it was organized was kind of weird.

52:48.560 --> 52:53.280
I think if I was actually a Flickr user who had a photo stream set up so I could view

52:53.280 --> 52:56.440
friends pictures, it might be a little better.

52:56.440 --> 53:01.960
But most of my like picture feeds come through Twitter or I guess Facebook.

53:01.960 --> 53:04.360
So I'm not really a Flickr person.

53:04.360 --> 53:07.020
But I have some people that are really into photography that do it.

53:07.020 --> 53:10.680
But I know like with Flickr, man, people will upload like 250 photographs at once.

53:10.680 --> 53:13.040
It's like that would be a lot to have to scroll through.

53:13.040 --> 53:16.280
You know, like here's all my Disneyland pictures, womp.

53:16.280 --> 53:22.280
So Tiger Claw reminds us there's no Skype in the Vita.

53:22.280 --> 53:26.120
Not yet, but there's also, isn't there that built in party chat thing they have now?

53:26.120 --> 53:31.360
They have where you can group message and I think you can use the party chat thing that

53:31.360 --> 53:32.520
I think that's voice chat.

53:32.520 --> 53:33.520
I think so.

53:33.520 --> 53:36.360
I think it's supposed to work with PlayStation 3, too.

53:36.360 --> 53:40.420
There are some things where the Vita and the PlayStation 3 play each other.

53:40.420 --> 53:42.560
I think Wipeout's one of them.

53:42.560 --> 53:44.480
Wipeout is one of them.

53:44.480 --> 53:51.020
And you know, it's kind of funny, though, is you know how they have that one cross-play

53:51.020 --> 53:55.320
section where you get all the games that support cross-play?

53:55.320 --> 53:58.640
Wipeout's not on there, which is like, huh?

53:58.640 --> 54:02.240
Back again, because I was just looking at the store earlier and Wipeout and uh...

54:02.240 --> 54:04.840
It's Hustle Kings and Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

54:04.840 --> 54:05.840
Weird.

54:05.840 --> 54:06.840
Yeah.

54:06.840 --> 54:11.440
And Marvel vs. Capcom 3, I thought the only thing you could do on that was cross-play.

54:11.440 --> 54:17.760
Maybe you can fight other people, but I thought it was just playing the game using the Vita

54:17.760 --> 54:20.400
as the controller, but I don't know.

54:20.400 --> 54:25.160
I'm sorry, you say cross-play and I think of cross-dressing cosplay.

54:25.160 --> 54:26.480
Or unicorns and altered beasts?

54:26.480 --> 54:28.800
No, I mean, I actually think of...

54:28.800 --> 54:29.800
Anyway.

54:29.800 --> 54:35.720
Alright, anyhow, well, this is something that'll get maybe some cross-play fans and a lot of

54:35.720 --> 54:38.000
other people very excited this week.

54:38.000 --> 54:41.200
I know there's a lot of folks in our chat room that are excited about this news.

54:41.200 --> 54:46.140
New Pokemon games, Black 2 and White 2 have been announced.

54:46.140 --> 54:49.400
And a lot of people went, did they run out of colors?

54:49.400 --> 54:51.000
Like Black 2?

54:51.000 --> 54:52.240
What is this?

54:52.240 --> 54:53.240
What is this?

54:53.240 --> 54:56.040
So yeah, we don't really know exactly what it is.

54:56.040 --> 54:57.280
It's not gray.

54:57.280 --> 54:59.320
That's what a lot of people were thinking it was gonna be.

54:59.320 --> 55:04.520
And the other huge thing about this, it's not the 3DS.

55:04.520 --> 55:06.160
It's the DS.

55:06.160 --> 55:07.680
These are not 3DS games.

55:07.680 --> 55:12.120
These appear to be some type of upgrades or sequels to the existing Pokemon Black and

55:12.120 --> 55:13.120
White games.

55:13.120 --> 55:17.840
They will be out on the DS regular, which granted the 3DS can play them, in Japan in

55:17.840 --> 55:18.840
June.

55:18.840 --> 55:23.560
Now, there are some North American details, very few, but they're called here.

55:23.560 --> 55:28.960
It's gonna be Pokemon Black version 2 and Pokemon White version 2.

55:28.960 --> 55:31.160
We'll get details throughout the year.

55:31.160 --> 55:33.520
So that means we probably won't have it in June.

55:33.520 --> 55:36.080
I'd imagine this is something they're gonna be targeting for the holidays.

55:36.080 --> 55:39.740
Again, though, very interesting, it's not 3DS.

55:39.740 --> 55:42.560
And the fact that it's a direct sequel.

55:42.560 --> 55:43.560
What does that mean?

55:43.560 --> 55:45.640
Does that mean it's the same world?

55:45.640 --> 55:48.560
How did they add new Pokemon into it?

55:48.560 --> 55:49.560
How does this work?

55:49.560 --> 55:53.600
But of course I'm not as up and up on my Pokemon, I used to love Pokemon 10 years ago, but I

55:53.600 --> 55:54.600
don't follow it anymore.

55:54.600 --> 55:59.080
Wouldn't it be hilarious if it was a Game of the Year edition with any additional Pokemon

55:59.080 --> 56:00.080
that were offered?

56:00.080 --> 56:01.080
I don't even...

56:01.080 --> 56:03.280
No, it seems like it's gonna be richer than that.

56:03.280 --> 56:10.540
I saw some forums comparing it to when they upgraded Green to Emerald, but that was also

56:10.540 --> 56:13.560
a system upgrade with that.

56:13.560 --> 56:16.160
Black and White were on the DS, am I right?

56:16.160 --> 56:17.440
So there's no system upgrade happening there.

56:17.440 --> 56:21.080
It would be funny if they weren't on the DS, if they were on the 3DS and then they downgraded

56:21.080 --> 56:22.080
them.

56:22.080 --> 56:25.880
No, I mean, Black and White, they could have been advanced for all I know, but they weren't.

56:25.880 --> 56:27.720
They were DS titles.

56:27.720 --> 56:33.640
I honestly truly have not bought a Pokemon game since Sapphire, I think was the last

56:33.640 --> 56:34.640
one I had.

56:34.640 --> 56:35.640
I had Pearl.

56:35.640 --> 56:36.640
Yeah, so...

56:36.640 --> 56:37.640
Ugh.

56:37.640 --> 56:43.600
Uh, Rama suggests instead of version 2, just call it V2.

56:43.600 --> 56:47.720
Why couldn't they have just done Pokemon Ebony and Pokemon Ivory?

56:47.720 --> 56:49.000
I mean, they could have just named it something...

56:49.000 --> 56:50.680
And then they could have had that song.

56:50.680 --> 56:52.160
Dan was expecting Pokemon Gray.

56:52.160 --> 56:54.000
I think a lot of people were.

56:54.000 --> 57:01.640
I even heard somebody saying Gray and Gray, like G-R-E and G-R-A. Why?

57:01.640 --> 57:02.640
Which would have been weird.

57:02.640 --> 57:05.440
Why don't they just do one called Pokemans?

57:05.440 --> 57:06.440
That's it.

57:06.440 --> 57:07.440
Or how about...

57:07.440 --> 57:08.440
Pokemon Rainbow!

57:08.440 --> 57:10.440
Pokemon 3D!

57:10.440 --> 57:11.840
Done.

57:11.840 --> 57:15.920
Because we have Colosseum and...

57:15.920 --> 57:19.600
Would y'all be that tore up if they just ditched the color thing?

57:19.600 --> 57:22.360
Maybe you would, I don't know.

57:22.360 --> 57:26.680
But you know what, if there are more Pokemans to be had, there will be people buying these

57:26.680 --> 57:27.680
games.

57:27.680 --> 57:28.680
Touch them, love them.

57:28.680 --> 57:29.680
That's right.

57:29.680 --> 57:30.680
Touch them, love them.

57:30.680 --> 57:33.000
And you never know what type of, like, internet things they might try to build into this or

57:33.000 --> 57:34.000
whatever.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
Where's my Pokemon MMO?

57:35.000 --> 57:38.700
Maybe that's what's happening on the 3DS here, right?

57:38.700 --> 57:40.200
Someone tried to do that and they got sued.

57:40.200 --> 57:42.040
Of course they did!

57:42.040 --> 57:44.040
Nintendo, what's your money?

57:44.040 --> 57:49.320
S-H-A-100, Matt in our chatroom at chat.orangetonstrategy.com says, doesn't matter what platform it's on,

57:49.320 --> 57:51.800
it will make millions.

57:51.800 --> 57:55.480
Raginator says, no Pokemon Fuchsia?

57:55.480 --> 57:56.480
Pokemon Checkerboard?

57:56.480 --> 57:57.480
It said Pokemon Clear.

57:57.480 --> 57:59.960
How about Pokemon Peaceful Meadow?

57:59.960 --> 58:02.120
Pokemon Bloody Tampon.

58:02.120 --> 58:03.120
Stop it.

58:03.120 --> 58:04.120
Moving on.

58:04.120 --> 58:05.560
None of them know what we're talking about.

58:05.560 --> 58:07.120
It's for the best.

58:07.120 --> 58:08.120
Good.

58:08.120 --> 58:14.160
Well, how about that Double Fine adventure thing?

58:14.160 --> 58:15.520
They want it to be 2D.

58:15.520 --> 58:22.760
In fact, there's a quote on here that said they're working with Nathan Stapley, who is

58:22.760 --> 58:24.760
a painter.

58:24.760 --> 58:28.920
And they said that they wanted to do it sort of a paint style, you know, paint the backgrounds

58:28.920 --> 58:34.080
and hand paint the characters and animate them that way.

58:34.080 --> 58:42.600
Which, it would be, if you're gonna do a 2D game, typically it has to be pixel based.

58:42.600 --> 58:47.620
If you're going to do something that's gonna flow like paint, it's gonna have to still

58:47.620 --> 58:52.960
have a 3D element to it for that level of animation, unless it's all vector based.

58:52.960 --> 58:58.320
And then to do that is a little bit different too, because vector graphics are gonna need

58:58.320 --> 59:10.040
to have a screen capable of displaying mathematically calculated vectors, where most games are gonna

59:10.040 --> 59:14.140
need some type of raster thing to view it, right?

59:14.140 --> 59:18.920
So I don't think that's gonna be possible unless they do it some sort of shaded 3D.

59:18.920 --> 59:22.120
But the thing on here, and I'm gonna read this quote, one of the things I missed about

59:22.120 --> 59:27.920
2D graphic adventures is that you would be able to have a great artist expressing themselves

59:27.920 --> 59:32.160
directly on screen, not having to go through 3D shaders or any of the complicated technology

59:32.160 --> 59:35.160
might change or alter their vision.

59:35.160 --> 59:38.960
I just don't think it's gonna be possible without, for what they're describing, it's

59:38.960 --> 59:44.320
not gonna be possible to do it in a pixel based format.

59:44.320 --> 59:46.000
I don't think so.

59:46.000 --> 59:49.360
But for all those people that pre-ordered it, which is, you know, what we've been calling

59:49.360 --> 59:53.000
Kickstarter on Bobby's show earlier this evening when he was talking to us at the end of the

59:53.000 --> 59:57.760
show there, we were talking about how Kickstarter is basically the new pre-ordering.

59:57.760 --> 01:00:01.120
They'll get to see the whole journal and if it works or not.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:02.120
Yeah.

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:03.120
It'll be interesting.

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:09.200
I mean, now I'm trying to think in terms of pixel graphics at high definition, and possibly,

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:14.360
but it's gonna be a monster for memory.

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:16.560
It would just be a monster for memory.

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:21.200
So you would really have to be careful to make it work.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:23.800
Let's travel around the world and check out some games that will be coming out a whole

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:26.160
lot sooner than this Double Fine game.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.540
As in this week, Loki.

01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:30.120
There's a few things coming out of this week.

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:33.400
Poke Park 2 wonders beyond for the Nintendo Wii.

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:35.000
Well there's something for the Pokemon, people!

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
You can have it right now!

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
There you go.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000
What the fuck is Poke Park?

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.040
Yeah, Poke Park is basically- Do we get to poke them with the Wiimote?

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:47.760
No, it's like kind of a spinoff of the Pokemon series where you play as Pikachu and you go

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:50.880
through some crappy adventure with Pokemon.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:51.880
Sounds like a kid's game.

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:52.880
Yeah.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:53.880
Alright.

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:54.880
Pretty much.

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:58.840
And then, also this week, we have Lord of the Rings Online, the Myth Roll Edition, which

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:00.800
is a prior re-release there.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:04.560
Binary Domain on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 from Sega.

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:09.440
Order Up on the PlayStation 3 with Move Support from Ignition.

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:12.320
Order Up is kind of like cooking mama on the Wii.

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:17.880
Country Dance All Stars for the Xbox 360 and Kinect.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:27.440
Hyperdimension Neptunia MK2, the game where you play, I guess, game consoles turned into

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:29.920
anime chicks.

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:33.440
That's from Tecmo Koei.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:40.120
And this week, Mortal Kombat The Complete Edition with all the DLC included plus a voucher

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:44.380
for the very first Mortal Kombat movie and the soundtrack.

01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:46.680
That's on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:49.840
Alan secretly wants me to get that.

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:50.840
This game...

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:51.840
Why?

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:52.840
I already own Mortal Kombat.

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:53.840
This game looks pretty awesome.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:58.200
One I'm kind of looking forward to this week, SSX on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and finally

01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:02.880
for the Nintendo DS, Shin Megami Tensei Devil Survivor 2.

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:05.000
Let's go to Japan and look at the releases over there.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.600
On March 1st, UFC Undisputed 3 comes out on the Xbox 360 and that's really the only release

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:13.760
on the Xbox 360 of note this week.

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:23.560
On the, excuse me, on March 1st on the PlayStation 3, we have One Piece Kaizuko Musou.

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:26.940
I don't think that's somebody actually wearing a One Piece.

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:27.940
This is...

01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:28.940
Dynasty Warriors of One Piece.

01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:29.940
One Piece is an anime.

01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:30.940
Aha.

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:31.940
So there it is.

01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:32.940
Yeah.

01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:33.940
Historical Heroes.

01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:34.940
It's like a clash.

01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:35.940
It's a beat-em-up game.

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:36.940
They're stretchy pirates.

01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:37.940
Yeah.

01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:44.160
On top of that, there's a bad guy in there who has like this spear, uh, uh, what's it

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.160
called?

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:46.700
Uh, slingshot.

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:49.440
And I just saw a video today of where someone actually made it and it works.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:50.440
I will say this.

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:54.280
I'm noticing like, you know, it has kind of a Street Fighter 4-esque art style to it,

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:59.160
but I'm noticing like in some shots, the anime characters look really interesting being brought

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:00.160
to life.

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.560
That's exactly what the character looks like in the manga.

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:06.120
If you're interested in that style of gameplay, you should really check out the Cyber Connect

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:08.160
2 stuff, like the Naruto games.

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:09.640
They are gorgeous.

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:12.680
They're just like, it's like, holy crap, anime alive.

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:13.680
You know what's funny?

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:19.320
I have an issue of Shonen Jump from 1992 with the original One Piece and Dragon Ball Z in

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:20.320
it.

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:21.320
Nice.

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:22.320
Old, huh?

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.960
Why do I do Japanese releases on this show?

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:27.640
Because I don't know any of this, but I guess that's a funny thing.

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:28.640
All right.

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:29.640
I will say that that game...

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:30.640
You're being ironic, Rob.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:38.440
The game is big enough where they're releasing a PlayStation 3 themed console slash game included

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:39.440
whole thing with that.

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:40.440
Oh yeah.

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:41.440
One Piece is big.

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:42.440
So yeah.

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:43.880
And that's actually a pretty sweet looking PlayStation 3.

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:44.880
Look at that.

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:49.200
It's like this, it's this brown tan, which I know doesn't...

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:50.200
Like copper bronze.

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:51.200
Copper.

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.200
I like, yeah, copper.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:53.200
It's more like a copper color.

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.240
And it has the like artwork on the PS3.

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.240
What is it?

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.240
Like Luffy or something?

01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:58.240
That's pretty sweet, actually.

01:03:58.240 --> 01:03:59.240
I think it...

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:00.240
Isn't that his name?

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.240
Mm-hmm.

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:02.240
Yeah.

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:06.360
Like if I was at all interested in having a Japanese PlayStation 3, that would be one

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:07.360
of the ones to get.

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:08.360
I got...

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:11.840
Man, they get some really sweet custom PS3s over there because it seems like every month

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:12.840
there's something.

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:13.840
I miss the...

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:16.760
Remember when they had the Sakura PS2 that was actually kind of a purple color?

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:17.760
I do.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:18.760
That was cool.

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:19.760
Mm-hmm.

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:20.760
I'm sorry.

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:21.760
I still...

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:25.760
My original Xbox is that Halo Xbox, which not a lot of people had.

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:26.760
So is mine.

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:27.760
Oh yeah?

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:28.760
You guys had it too?

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:29.760
I have it too.

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:33.640
You know we've got like three different versions of the Xbox 360.

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:36.840
Oh yeah, yeah.

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:39.440
Because we had to ship them all back because the red rings went off.

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.000
Anyway, back to the release dates.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:47.000
On Nintendo 3DS, Doraemon has a game, Nobita no Kiseki no Shima.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.800
And Mario and Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games comes out in Japan.

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.280
There's a demo for that on the marketplace right now, at least in America.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:56.400
I'm pretty sure it's on the Japanese one as well.

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:57.620
And that's really it.

01:04:57.620 --> 01:05:00.120
I don't see a whole lot else coming out this week.

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:01.280
Kind of a slower week in Japan.

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:04.720
Well it's even slower in the UK.

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:11.600
On March 2nd, we have Mario Party 9 for the Wii, Mortal Kombat Complete Edition for 360

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.640
and PS3 and SSX.

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:15.560
That's it.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:17.520
All right.

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:20.680
I guess everybody's preoccupied with the Vita or something.

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:21.680
All right, Loki.

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:22.680
They must be.

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:28.400
I mean, I can't think of any other thing they could be occupied with.

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:29.400
Here's something interesting.

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:34.080
And I think we've talked a little bit about how some of these companies like Microsoft

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:40.400
and Sony are trying to emulate other companies.

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:43.600
Recently it's been kind of these Wii U tablet things.

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:53.160
Well a new one is Sony has patented a new Kinect-like PlayStation Eye camera that's

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:57.720
going to have some sort of backwards compatibility with the PlayStation Eye stuff right now,

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.720
which I guess it could.

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:03.460
Because I think the PlayStation Eye camera is just pretty much a camera.

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:08.080
But they said the filing calls for a real-time, three-dimensional interactive environment

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:11.240
using a depth sensing device.

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:15.040
Users would move in front of and interact with.

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:21.400
And also it says in body minutes of present invention provided real-time interactive gaming

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:23.240
experiences for users.

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:30.480
For example, users can interact with various computer-generated objects in real time.

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:34.340
That definitely sounds like the Kinect.

01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:37.880
What happened to the move?

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:42.640
Where did that go?

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:49.040
I really want them to come out with a controller-less thing and go, well you need buttons.

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.720
Buttons are where it's at.

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:51.800
Button button button.

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:56.520
And then honestly I think they should have both.

01:06:56.520 --> 01:07:05.120
I think that perhaps the PlayStation Eye camera is just not really good at capturing the rest

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:12.800
of your body aside from moving the controller around, the PlayStation Eye or the move stuff.

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:13.800
So maybe that's what it is.

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:18.280
It's like an upgrade to the PlayStation Eye camera that's going to be used in conjunction

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:20.040
with the PlayStation Move stuff.

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:23.880
So that you have your buttons, you have your controller inputs and stuff like that, plus

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:26.520
you have the rest of your body capturing stuff.

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:32.240
That's all I can figure it is because it doesn't mention anything about upgrading the move

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:33.240
stuff.

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:38.680
Well you know we're getting at this point in the year where we've got to be asking ourselves,

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:41.940
so what's E3 going to look like this year?

01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:44.200
We know what Nintendo is doing.

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:49.120
We can have a pretty good idea that Sony is going to be doing a little more with the Vita

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:52.820
and some of its big games for the rest of the year, but what are they going to mention

01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:56.440
with the PS3?

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:57.440
What's the next big thing with the PlayStation?

01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:03.840
And the one I really want to know about is Microsoft, what do they got going this year?

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:10.720
I'm going to assume Halo 4 is going to really dominate their press conference, but what

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:11.720
else?

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:16.800
What about, you know, it's kind of the question I wanted answered last year.

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:21.800
I think what is the, now show me how Kinect is really going to change my life.

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:26.080
Well for like their press conferences go, you're going to probably see something, I'm

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:29.440
going to be willing to bet that they're going to show Call of Duty, whatever the new Call

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:32.720
of Duty is, it's going to be a big portion of their thing, because they're probably going

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:36.360
to have exclusive DLC again, or exclusive window on DLC.

01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:40.400
I bet you they're going to show something about Grand Theft Auto 5, which they're probably

01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:47.680
going to have exclusive DLC on that, much like they did with the 4 franchise.

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:56.320
And then, oh, there's a new Assassin's Creed game coming out, maybe they'll show something

01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:57.320
on that.

01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:00.840
I think as far as first party stuff goes, I mean, Gears of War, I don't know if there's

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:04.840
going to be a new Gears of War game this year, I mean, I don't.

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:10.680
I'd be really curious at Sony's press conference to see if Final Fantasy XIV returns, because

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:16.340
we're looking at this very interesting thing that's never happened in gaming before that

01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:24.280
I can think of, where the launch of the game on PC was so fucked that they have redone

01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:28.680
the entire game with this whole 2.0 thing, and the version that's supposed to come out

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:31.680
on PlayStation 3 is the 2.0 game.

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:36.520
They're just going to pretend that 1.0 basically didn't happen, and then the PC and the PS3

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:37.840
will be merged together.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:42.000
So I'm very curious to see if they get up there on that stage and say, Final Fantasy

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:49.360
XIV is coming out on the PlayStation 3 in a new version developed for the PlayStation

01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:54.200
3, or whatever the fuck they embellish it with.

01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:57.680
Because they were so excited when they had it as the exclusive, remember a couple years

01:09:57.680 --> 01:09:58.680
ago?

01:09:58.680 --> 01:09:59.680
Not so excited anymore.

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:03.960
Oh shit, we still have to put this game out?

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:06.580
Versus XIII could be a thing though.

01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:08.840
Versus XIII is still, you know.

01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:10.800
That could be awesome.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:17.220
I just, I don't know, right now they've been pretty good about keeping secrets so far.

01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:18.480
We still got a few more months.

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:19.480
That's right.

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:20.920
That's right, let the hype begin.

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:24.640
Alright, well speaking of letting the hype begin, this is certainly interesting.

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:28.800
Ok, so Nintendo had the press conference this week where we mentioned a lot of the news.

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:30.880
By the way, I gotta do a quick tangent.

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:32.800
I gotta say this is pretty clever.

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:37.520
I woke up the other morning and my little swap note button is lit, meaning I have a

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:40.140
new message on the 3DS swap note.

01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:42.680
And I was like, oh yay, somebody sent me another 3D cat picture.

01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:44.520
Because that's pretty much all I ever get on swap note.

01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:45.520
Or fish.

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:47.640
Now I've been getting fish this week.

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:52.020
So I open it up and it's a message from Reggie Fils-Aime on my swap note.

01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:54.360
And it even goes, hi, this is Reggie from Nintendo.

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:56.880
Because you can do like a little five second audio clip.

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:58.600
And it's Reggie's little me.

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:06.240
And it says, join me tomorrow at 6am, lol, for a Nintendo Direct announcement.

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:10.080
And I even showed it to Alan and we were both kind of like, you know, that is a pretty clever

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:11.640
way to spam.

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:16.820
And it even unlocked that stationary for use with other swap note stuff.

01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:19.880
So it was like, hey, Nintendo spammed me, but I got something out of it.

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:23.160
Got a new stationary for my next cat picture.

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:27.120
Anyhow, so as part of this whole Nintendo Direct conference, they of course mentioned

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:31.040
the last story, which, you know, Loki said they would do at some point.

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:33.880
Come out, you know, I think you said they'd do it last year, but they're going to come

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:34.880
out and say...

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:35.880
No, I thought they were going to do it in E3.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.880
In E3, yeah, well.

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:37.880
And then I said PAX.

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.640
Wait, are we still missing one?

01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:40.640
There's still one.

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:42.720
There's no Pandora's Tower, but it's coming out in Europe.

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:43.920
We talked last week.

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:49.360
Europe's got a date.

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:52.960
This is happening because the Wii's not even going to get a mention of this year's E3.

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.400
It's all about the Wii U.

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:57.040
They have to get people excited for the Wii U.

01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:58.040
They have to.

01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:03.920
Anyhow, 3DS, they'll still say some stuff on the 3DS.

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:08.040
And this might be something you see more about at E3 this year.

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:11.520
All we got was a hint this week at the Nintendo Direct Conference.

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:20.160
Capcom, Bandai Namco, and Sega are all working on something.

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:21.160
That's it.

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:24.320
And apparently there's a little teaser site.

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:25.320
I don't know.

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:26.320
This is the first time I'm seeing this.

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:27.320
This is a Japanese site.

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:30.440
I apologize in advance if this auto-plays music, but I didn't even realize it had its

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:31.440
own teaser site.

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:35.000
Because what in the fuck are they going to show?

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.240
What is this supposed to be?

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:40.240
Oh, is this like one of those frickin' oh, um...

01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:41.240
It's an elevator.

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:42.240
No, it's a...

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:43.240
What do they call those games?

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:44.240
Oh, uh, um, ARG.

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:45.240
ARG.

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:46.240
Oh no.

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:59.880
So they punched in a little code and now we see Steam and we see the three logos, so...

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:01.880
And Bonpresto up in the corner.

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:02.880
Who knows?

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:05.440
That could be anything.

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:10.440
Maybe they all are also working on the next Super Smash Brothers.

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:15.120
And you're going to have Mega Man and Pac-Man and Sonic all doing it.

01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:18.720
It'll be bad art man, bad box art Mega Man.

01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:19.720
Ha ha ha.

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:20.720
You don't get it.

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:23.520
A lot of people's minds are going straight to a fighting game.

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:24.520
Which makes sense.

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:25.520
That's what we've seen a lot of Cross.

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:28.560
Street Fighter, Cross, Tekken, Cross, Dead or Alive.

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:31.080
Was Dead or Alive a Sega game?

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:32.080
No maybe not.

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:33.080
Team Ninja.

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:34.080
No that's Team Ninja.

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:35.080
Uh, Sega.

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:36.080
Virtua Fighter.

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:37.080
Virtua Fighter?

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.080
I don't think so.

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:39.080
No.

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:40.080
I don't think so.

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:41.080
Virtua Pac Fighter.

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:42.080
You know what?

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:49.760
Okay, I just want to remind everybody, Win Namco and Sega and Nintendo worked together

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:50.760
before.

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:56.000
That was the F-Zero arcade game.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.760
Just throwing it out there.

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.960
Maybe they're going to let Capcom have their share.

01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:01.960
I don't know.

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:04.400
A fanboy can dream.

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:07.000
Capcom doesn't have any.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.520
So if you want that.

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:09.520
So it's going to be.

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:10.520
Exactly.

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:11.520
Capcom doesn't have a racer franchise.

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:12.520
No no no no no.

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:13.520
You're wrong.

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:14.520
They do have a racer franchise.

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:15.520
What do they have?

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:16.520
It would be.

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:17.520
Here's what it would be.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:26.360
It would be Daytona, Cross, Ridge Racer, Cross, MotoGP because that's the Capcom franchise.

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:27.360
Get out.

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:28.360
Get out.

01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:29.360
In space.

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:32.800
In space.

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:34.200
You get nothing.

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:35.480
You lose.

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:40.000
Good day sir.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.920
They really need to do a new excite truck.

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:42.920
No.

01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:43.920
For an intent.

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:44.920
Let it go.

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:45.920
That would sell me.

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:46.920
That would sell me a Wii U.

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:47.920
A new excite truck.

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:48.920
I'm telling you.

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:54.160
If they announce a new excite truck for the 3DS, I will be pissed.

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:56.040
I will be.

01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:57.640
What the fuck.

01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:58.640
They're not.

01:14:58.640 --> 01:14:59.640
You understand.

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:00.640
They won't.

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:01.640
You're fine.

01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:02.640
They're fine.

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:03.640
They're not.

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:04.640
They're not.

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:05.640
They're not.

01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:06.640
They're not.

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:07.640
They're already poo poo'd on that franchise.

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:08.640
They're not.

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:09.640
Excite bots Loki.

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:10.640
That's what you got.

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:11.640
You got excite bots.

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:12.640
What?

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:13.640
Virtua caliber.

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:14.640
Alright.

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:15.640
I really want to slap whoever you know what Nintendo is like, hey you know what racing

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:16.640
games need?

01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:18.640
Mini games in the middle of the fucking race.

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:19.820
That's fantastic.

01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:20.820
Yeah.

01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:23.160
Mini games.

01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:27.520
Let's go back to a time when games were simpler.

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:28.520
Not this one.

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:34.920
We call the classic game of the week back when game companies. They didn't work together. They all hated each other's guts

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:41.880
In fact there was a big rivalry between Sierra online and

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.240
Lucasfilm games

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:48.420
Actually, I don't know if there really was that big of a rivalry. I just made that up

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:51.760
What's a classic game of the week Dark Sakura Luma?

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:58.560
Which is one of my favorite games excellent pick by the way. I have surprised. I hadn't done it before but I

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:01.480
Love the music in this game

01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:08.400
At any rate loom was put out by Lucasfilm games, which is now Lucasarts and

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:14.280
It was the fourth game. That was the use the scum engine

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:22.240
I still like saying the scum engine and was led by Brian Moriarty who was the guy who gave a swish bringer Trinity and beyond

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:23.400
Zork

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:25.400
just saying

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:29.680
So actually it's on Steam now. You can play the loom on Steam, and it's like five bucks really

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:31.680
I didn't know that yeah, I have it on Steam nice

01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:33.880
So it's an adventure game

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:39.680
And it's really different because it's a big fantasy story set in the future

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:45.520
And it its interface is actually very different for its time, so basically with the game

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:49.640
is that you play a little guy named Bob and thread bear who has a distaff and

01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:52.280
You can play a spell

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:55.080
that it's

01:16:55.080 --> 01:17:00.400
Musical like one of them is called opening or you have night vision or sharpening. It's different. It's a different

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:04.560
type of song that you can play they're called drafts and

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:10.600
And you can reverse them by playing them backwards so like for example the dry one

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:17.680
Like die sorry like it like the dying thread you play backward it becomes a beach or instead of

01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:22.280
Terror I guess is calming anyway

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:28.520
But at first when you only play the game you only have the note C D and E and as you get through it you

01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:32.080
Actually get a full scale on the C scale. It's like an ocarina

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:34.080
except

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:42.360
So basically when it it actually just followed the LucasArts game design philosophy

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:47.080
Where a character will never be killed or forced to restart the game and won't have to spend hours

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:52.940
Typing in synonyms until they get it so basically has different

01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:55.580
difficulty levels you have

01:17:55.580 --> 01:18:02.560
Like an easy to an expert level and the expert level actually doesn't have any of the notes marked on the staff

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:04.560
You have to play it by ear

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:12.960
But you do have a different graphic sequences that play after that and that's only on the original version

01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:18.560
But the DOS CD-ROM version has a different graphics to it, too

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:24.520
So anyway, the drafts are the same way spells work like I said, you've got different ones that do different things and

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:31.720
When you also have this thing on the island that Bobbin lives on called the great loom

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:38.440
And it's a loom island and it can echo the last draft that was spun in its presence

01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:43.600
So the only ones that can't are the ones that Bobbin did by himself

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:46.800
So you can't really forget a draft that you do

01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:50.560
You'll learn everything in the presence of the loom

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:56.360
I'm sending so basically it's got like a really in-depth story to this this audio

01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:59.480
Play came with it. That was

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.480
It was like a cassette that had all of this

01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:12.200
Prequel story leading up to it about how the game is going to end and how the game is going to end

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:17.280
Prequel story leading up to it about, you know, how it's in. Let me see if I can find the the world

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:21.000
It's in the future. It's in 8021 and

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:29.760
Basically people have dissolved into different types of guilds and the weavers have decided to form this great loom that

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:31.800
controls all of reality

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:36.320
Except they stopped being able to have kids. So this one woman named Signe Threadbear

01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:40.080
Sneaks past them and

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:42.080
Actually

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:50.360
Weaves a gray thread into the great loom and out of it comes an infant and they turn her into a swan and

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:57.120
This one other woman decides to raise Bobbin this is starting to sound like a Bjork video

01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:00.200
It's awesome

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:06.160
But anyway, the the elders are actually named after the three fates of Greek mythology

01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:08.160
Um

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.960
They

01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:16.640
As things happen the the woman who raises Bobbin and I'm trying to find her name

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:21.040
I think it was like hat hatch something. It's been a while. I'm trying to see if I can find it in the article

01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:23.840
but

01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:30.000
This woman who ends up raising him Oh Dame Hetchel, that was her name who was a serving woman

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:35.680
She ends up teaching Bobbin how to weave drafts

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:42.040
Which he wasn't supposed to learn until he turned 17. And so she gets turned into a swan, too

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:44.920
or no, she gets turned into a

01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:48.800
Different kind of bird but as it goes on basically

01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:53.800
Everyone on the island gets turned into a swan and they fly off and the only one left is Bobbin

01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:56.160
So he's trying to figure out what's going on

01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:58.160
So

01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:04.000
Yeah, she gets turned as the swan appears and cast a spell on all of the villagers

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:09.080
So all the weavings except Bobbin are turned into swans and it turns out that you know this one I think it's his mother

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:12.120
so

01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:13.460
this

01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:18.560
cleric actually takes the weavers to staff to take over the world with an army of undead and

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:24.040
And basically Bobbin gets it and has to go on to fight chaos

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:31.520
With Bobbin coming into the world like it weaved chaos into the world. So it was

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:36.160
Like I said a very in-depth story

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:40.120
So there were actually sequels that were planned after the game came out

01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:44.920
one of them was gonna call be called Forge that had starred rusty nail bender as

01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:48.120
Who was one of

01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:55.960
Bobbins friends and then another game called the fold that was a fleece firm flanks

01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:58.160
I think that's a funny name firm flanks

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:03.960
Who was gonna work a character in a John John Waters movie? Well, he was he's one of the shepherds

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:05.960
but he was gonna work with rusty and

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:11.320
It actually loom sold a lot of copies, but

01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:16.320
The only reason that the sequels never came out was because basically he wanted to work on other things

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:20.600
Nobody else wanted to do him. So it just sort of fell apart. They were ideas

01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:27.640
as far as getting the game it originally came out on for DOS on an EGA floppy disk and

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:31.520
then it came out to the Amiga the Atari ST the Mac and

01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:33.760
TurboGrafx-16

01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:39.680
Which actually was a much better version than the other versions. I did not know the TurboGrafx-16 had one

01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:44.840
fair game in town was selling a copy for 60 bucks and I wanted it so

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:50.920
Wow, and Dan's like you already have a game because I have the PC CD and I have it on Steam

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:59.120
But anyway, like I said Loon came out later on CD-rom for the FM towns computer and it was a VGA

01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:02.560
Enhanced and had a digital soundtrack

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:04.400
so

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:11.920
Everything was so much better on it. It was beautiful. And then a third version came out on CD-rom for DOS in 1992 that were

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:18.780
Really really souped up and it I had the talking in it like we got some samples of the voice

01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:24.440
Yes, we do had voice acting in it. Let's go to this is just right at the beginning here. Yeah

01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:28.360
So Bobin's walking along

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:33.400
Ouch. He gets hit by a rabbit. Bird steals a rabbit.

01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:43.060
Destiny shall draw the lightning down from heaven roll its thunder far across the sea

01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:48.240
To where I wait upon the shore of wonder on the day

01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:52.120
The sky is opened and the tree is split asunder

01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:55.240
So you get like this when you read different things

01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:57.240
so

01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:00.120
And you've got voice acting in it, okay

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.360
But this actually was the first talking scum game that came out and

01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:10.480
it had though a lot of the dialogue was rewritten and

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:15.480
That's just because they had to edit space they needed the space

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:20.400
So

01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:26.020
They had different solutions to some of the puzzles and different close-ups on the dialogues and different

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:32.080
Graphics that were included with it and this was considered to be the definitive version of Loom

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:41.440
Also, there was a rumor that said that Orson Scott Card helped make of the original version

01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:44.680
Not true. In fact, he even said not true

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:52.280
But he did help revise the game's dialogue. So he did contribute to the later version of the game the 1992 version and

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:57.520
You can't get the DOS CD-ROM version anymore

01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:03.280
Because of an agreement with Mindscape for licensing. Mindscape is no longer in business by the way

01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:11.300
So the only way that you can play the original versions of it really is by having the scum VM virtual machine

01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:13.500
although

01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:17.240
You can't play the FM towns version. What about the whole steam thing?

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:22.200
Let me get to that. This is like the original discs my bad. Okay versions

01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:25.720
Now the voice to CD-ROM version

01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:31.000
is available for on Steam for PC and Mac and

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.760
There is a

01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:42.800
The community actually the steam community has made a method to play the FM town version with the steam version of Loom

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:49.520
So it's there so like as you can hear some of the music has a search from Swan Lake because of the big swan theme

01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:53.320
In it and the MIDI version was arranged by the fat man. That's what he was called

01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:59.320
Others are there are you know full CD versions they're sequenced versions

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:06.320
It was at the time it really supported all kinds of the different graphics not graphics audio processors that came out that were out at the time

01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:20.320
and like I said with the package it had an audio tape that had a 30 minute drama that had the nature and the history of the Loom world and about Bobin being born and so the game is a continuation of the story that came on the cassette and

01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:24.320
Had original music that was composed by Jerry Gerber and

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:36.320
The actors who were in that reprised their roles for the talkie version most of them did so it really keeps up with that continuity and it was the first commercial cassette that used the Dolby S noise reduction

01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:42.320
and it also said that the side a was encoded for Dolby B playback and

01:26:42.320 --> 01:27:04.320
B the side B was the Dolby S playback so it had an illustrated notebook of the book of patterns which you know basically all the apprentice weavers in the game were given that type of thing and had different descriptions in there different had spaces that you could write down your what you learned in the game and

01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:27.320
because the drafts are random from game to game it said write it in pencil and it also worked as copy protection since the original disc would ask for the order of the notes for your disc for the first spell that you learn and that's how you can prove that your game isn't a copy

01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:40.320
if you don't enter the correct notes that came with your book it would go back to the DOS boot screen that's pretty clever I think

01:27:40.320 --> 01:28:04.320
you know basically like you put in your code here it actually was reviewed in dragon magazine number 159 and it was given a 5 out of 5 stars and overall had a 75% review and it was actually appeared in other games in the secret of monkey island there was a guy named Cobb who was in the scum bar and he was a

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:24.320
wearing a shirt that said ask me about Loom nice and actually in the VGA remake of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade a painting in the vault of the Brunwell Castle reveals a beach that appears as scenery from Loom and in the NES version of Maniac Mansion there's a broken record called the soundtrack of Loom also in Space Quest

01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:47.320
4 there is a game parodies called there's one called boom exactly like a Allen literally just shouted from the other room yes yeah so that's the game Loom you can get it on steam I literally paid actually when I got it I paid $3 for it because it was on sale

01:28:47.320 --> 01:29:10.320
totally worth it it's an amazing little point and click alright there it is your classic game of the week you had a lot to say about that one but it's a you know it's a really in-depth kind of game and I would just be stuck hours playing this game with my friend Marcy good times yeah alright well that's gonna do it for part a of orange launch radio but don't go anywhere we've got plenty more to come when we come back with orange launch radio another MMO going free to play

01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:26.320
a classic a classic classic game from back in the day I can't believe I'm calling a dreamcast game back in the day but I just did apparently set to come back so we're gonna talk all about that we come back with more of orange lounge radio

01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:53.320
welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio we're starting the second half of our show live here at all games radio it is February the 26th of 2012 and we are live with the 447th episode of our show we're about to get into some rapid fire news but I guess I have a interesting breaking news thing or whatever I win the other room

01:29:53.320 --> 01:30:21.320
and saw my 3ds had the blue light on and I was like oh Rama or somebody probably sent me a cat picture so I assumed it was swap note going off but it wasn't I had suddenly new data so you 3ds owners might want to check I just suddenly had new data in the mee plaza and it told me that that the puzzle trading mode you know like or the picture the picture swap thing is now available via spot pass which is the internet not just the walking by spot pass which is the internet

01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:49.320
not just the walking by somebody which I think they call street pass right street pass and spot pass so and then it gave me a piece of a brand new puzzle from kid Icarus uprising so you know which obviously the Nintendo stuff is to promote their own products I'm sure but I thought that was interesting that that just updated right now so those of you the guys with 3ds that are into that kind of collecting stuff might want to check that out right now because I just got it and I imagine the rest of you probably have it on their way just like the whole

01:30:49.320 --> 01:31:08.320
Reggie note on swap note earlier so I guess not to be outdone by the Vita Nintendo still needs a little attention this week hence their press conference on the day of the Vita launch and now some of this little stuff going on alright let's talk about some rapid fire news just some brief news we want to talk to you a little bit about Loki

01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:37.320
so one game that's still kind of teasing people over here in North America that they haven't gotten it yet is project 02 or Fatal Frame 2 it is coming to European regions very soon and it's funny because it's like one of those hey look we're translating the English but you can't have it yet you can't have it yet you can't okay fine you can have it no no you can't hahaha that's pretty much what they're doing so

01:31:38.320 --> 01:32:03.320
yes it's coming to Europe when no idea but the game was actually it was a remake I guess of project zero well fair enough I mean how often does Europe get screwed on having to wait so many months because we got something you know so yeah and of course they don't specify whether North America will see the release as well but maybe

01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:26.320
if you beg enough this is kind of interesting not really a property that I thought would be getting a game but apparently it was announced that the boondocks saints are getting a video game and I mean absolutely awesome movie kind of curious to see how that would come about but it is going to be apparently

01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:51.320
a movie or not a movie a video game based off the movie little while after the movie scenes that came out in 1999 but hey you know what the Warriors game was fucking awesome I was going to say that game on the Warriors that was a movie the first Warriors game was fucking awesome not necessarily the second one that they released on Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation

01:32:51.320 --> 01:33:19.320
or the original one they didn't games on the Godfather years and years later pretty good yeah so it happens and also Scarface was not bad how to kill Bill game I would see that I mean that would be kind of cool be fun just you know I don't know what exactly it would be but that's pretty cool so no word exactly what it is but apparently it's gonna be

01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:39.320
I guess part of a panel they're gonna have this it's Chris or critical mass interactive they're having a panel about it and I guess critical mass interactive they've done like outsource art and design stuff and they've been they've worked on some of the

01:33:39.320 --> 01:34:08.320
and some pretty old games actually the outfit one of the early titles for the Xbox 360 and the Incredible Hulk not sure which Incredible Hulk game that was but at least this console generation you know but interesting to say the least and last but not least I'm very excited about this game one of my must haves

01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:35.320
of this year Borderlands 2 has been announced that it'll be coming to North America September 18 internationally September 24 lots of people excited about that game is Borderlands is awesome have you got a chance to play border I played it a little bit just a little bit so I not enough to get a full taste of it but enough to kind of see what people are excited about remember me and shooters don't always get along but I love the it's a little more fallout to me

01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:54.320
yeah it's a lot of loot dropping and they're gonna have a lot more loot in this and I love how there is kind of self-aware you know of their own jokes and stuff like you know of course the trailer had dubstep in it and they promised that they're all ninety eight point six percent more wub wub

01:34:54.320 --> 01:35:23.320
according to the trailer this is great great trailer definitely need to watch it if you have it also apparently there is an incentive I guess if you pre-order is par like this premier club and you'll get a gearbox gun pack a golden key item to unlock some sort of loot chests later on in the game and vault hunters relic and stuff like that and you know to be honest the last Borderlands game that was some really well

01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:32.320
done dlc right there I mean there was just those expansions were all great every single one of them so looking forward to it

01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:57.320
alright well let's talk about Metroid yet again another Metroid release don't get too excited it's just the NES classic all over again but the NES game is a true classic but you probably already bought this when it was on the Wii or heck you have the original cart or maybe you unlocked it with the whole Gameboy Advance cable thing but if you miss somehow all those ways to play classic

01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:10.320
well if you didn't buy your 3DS early enough that's right oh yeah that's right cause the early adopters got this for free well now you'll be able to buy Metroid now keep in mind we're getting this news from Japan but come on inevitably it'll come out here too

01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:22.320
Japan is getting the Metroid NES release on the 3DS virtual console on February 29th hopefully it's going to be coming here soon after that for those that you know didn't have the early adopter program

01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:33.320
you know Dark Tetsuya in our little thread where we post all the stories we want to talk about this week he had an interesting prediction guessing that it's the Famicar or the Famidisc version which actually had the better music to it

01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:53.320
I think that's a great thought or a wish but I wouldn't get your hopes up because the one that the early adopters have now is not that one and I'm pretty sure all this is is going to be just like the Mario one that came out a couple weeks ago where now you have the more proper save states built in and it's just kind of the quote unquote full release

01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:59.320
it would have multiplayer except Metroid doesn't use that at all so there you go

01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:03.320
and price it was I think 600 yen?

01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:08.320
yeah 6 bucks so a dollar more than it costs on the Wii

01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:19.320
and if you want to put a price tag on your you know what you're getting you know if you assume like each one's going to be about 5 bucks then that's a hundred dollars worth of content

01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:23.320
well I mean I would assume that the Game Boy Advance games would be more expensive but

01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:28.320
who knows but they're not going to put those out apparently or at least they say they're not

01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:30.320
yeah they will

01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:35.320
or they'll be on the Wii U well we said we wouldn't put them out on the 3DS

01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:43.320
we had a Pokemon story earlier and you know what Pokemon was all the rage this week on iPhone but for all the wrong reasons

01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:53.320
this company called I don't know what they were there was something like anime original something I don't know it was clearly a ripoff company released what's called Pokemon yellow right

01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:57.320
the old Game Boy color or was it Game Boy regular?

01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:05.320
I think it was red and blue are regular and then yellow had to be the color one because they added Pikachu because he's popular in the cartoon right?

01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:14.320
I think I'd actually know it was a black and white one was it but you it had like I think special coloration available for the Super Game Boy

01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:21.320
that makes sense all right well anyhow Pokemon yellow came out on the iOS app store only it wasn't Pokemon in fact it was it was a dud app

01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:34.320
they were charging 99 cents for this app and it shot to the top of the charts apparently on name alone or you know some type of insider scheme where they had a bunch of people buy it real fast so it shot to the top of the charts I don't know

01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:42.320
but it was garbage they somebody actually it wouldn't even boot like you would launch the app and it would just die

01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:52.320
and somebody went in there and somehow hacked it decompiled it and saw that all it was was one of those bullshit apps that's just pictures of Pokemon and maps

01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:59.320
and Pokemon fan fiction and all this stuff I don't know it's just a bunch of garbage that they throw into an app and then charge for it

01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:09.320
but because of the fact it was called Pokemon yellow and they said in the description you know five star just like the original and they made up all these fucking press quotes that weren't attributed to anything

01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:16.320
I mean this whole thing was just a giant rip off well Apple ended up yanking it from the store but it took them like all weekend to do it

01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:23.320
and now the question is is Apple going to refund the money probably not there is apparently no wait you can't I think you can request the money back

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:35.320
yeah if you there's a way that you can request it there's some sort of complaint form and you say basically that the app didn't work because it literally didn't work and then they may give you back the money

01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:42.320
one thousand three hundred let that be abused let that be a buck lesson that you should do your research on anything you download

01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:47.320
oh I didn't buy it well I meant to anybody that bought it because it was one dollar right

01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:57.320
no if it was a legit release also look at the company that made it because the legit release would have come from Nintendo and if they had let it out to a third party or something it would have said

01:39:57.320 --> 01:40:12.320
but here's the thing though but I understand why they would do that though well why people might buy is because sometimes companies unscrupulous companies will take a game and like say port it to the iOS or whatever

01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:24.320
you know through an emulator or something like that and it gets yanked and say hi it actually was the working version of Pokemon yellow but you know not licensed or approved or whatever

01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:34.320
alright well one other story I have for you guys and this is of course sad news because it's about somebody passing Steve Kordek passed away on Sunday

01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:42.320
but he was a hundred years old so you know you can't say he didn't live a nice full long life I think that's a number we all want to get to

01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:52.320
if you don't know the name Steve Kordek play more pinball he was highly influential in the pinball world how influential well he's the guy who pretty much thought to do a two flipper table

01:40:52.320 --> 01:41:04.320
and kind of designed the modern pinball table he gave us drop targets triple action yeah he also I guess later on he didn't just kind of do triple action that kind of did the standard pinball layout if you will

01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:15.320
he designed more than a hundred tables when he was with Genco and then Williams and Bally he did drop targets in Vagabond and multiball beat the clock 1963

01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:23.320
so Steve Kordek gave us all those things I played that table but sadly passed away this week they're doing I mean it has all the funeral details here

01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:30.320
there's a tribute book available online the link is a little lengthy there but I will go ahead and post that link in chat

01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:36.320
I'll leave you with this quote that he mentioned to the Chicago Tribune in 2009 when he had an interview

01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:41.320
I've had more fun in this business than anyone could believe

01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:44.320
rest in peace

01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:49.320
well how about some news that's not quite so sad

01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:51.320
yes please topic change

01:41:52.320 --> 01:42:00.320
yeah there's going to be a few 80s stuff coming out in fact specifically it's a Huey Lewis and the news pack for a rock band

01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:05.320
there will be do you believe in love the heart of rock and roll and I want a new drug

01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:11.320
and the letter being one with a pro guitar and bass expansion so it's the usual pricing

01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:14.320
440 Microsoft points for the pack

01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:24.320
I want a new drug which you know what he sued for Ghostbusters for sounding like like his little riff in that

01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:35.320
really yeah also there is a best of Just Dance coming up by Ubisoft I guess people like Just Dance so there should be a best of

01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:40.320
but it's going to be on the Wii in Europe Middle East and Asia regions

01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:45.320
hopefully you'll get some songs from You Can Dance ABBA in there just saying

01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:51.320
well the ones listed on here so far are Hey Ya and Firework by Katy Perry

01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:54.320
the only girl in the world and airplanes

01:42:55.320 --> 01:43:01.320
you know I can't really hate on those games they're they're stupid fun if that's what you want to play go ahead

01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:11.320
and of course of course the Kung Fu fighting you can't touch this not the original it's by the Groove Century

01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:20.320
and I like to move it move it move it you know what it's interesting when these kind of best collections happen

01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:24.320
it's almost like what you see happen in the music world when like I don't know who put out a greatest hits CD

01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:30.320
Goldfrapp just last month put out like a greatest hits CD so this is kind of like a greatest hits CD of sorts

01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:37.320
but it's not like we haven't seen music games do this before hello guitar hero had a compilation at one point

01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:43.320
DDR best hits anybody so Konami did it too back in the day

01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:52.320
well and back in the day they still do it I was going to say best hits was what 19 no probably like 2000 or 2001 it was a PS1 game

01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:59.320
well the last bit on here is it has to do with Star Wars the Old Republic which I know there are addicts out there that listen to this

01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:13.320
people are averaging 4-6 hours per gaming session which according to Greg Zestchuk who is the head of Bioware Austin

01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:20.320
says that it's absurd that their sessions are absurd and that it's that one more quest one more thing

01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:25.320
and that people are just getting sucked in and he says that Sunday is the busiest day playing

01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:34.320
but the average during the average work week you get people playing mid afternoon because the East Coast

01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:42.320
and basically when Europe goes down North America goes up so they're getting consistent play times too

01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:49.320
and there are 2 million active subscribers so kind of like wow you know with about a fifth of the people

01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:57.320
and with more no one car I mean I'm I'm not gonna throw shade at Star Wars it was a fine month I played the game

01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:04.320
but I'm I'll check it out later on once things have leveled out a little more quality life improvements were needed in that game

01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:14.320
that's it all right anyhow we're gonna get back into some longer set news here this is usually a little part of the show where I have for an interlude

01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:20.320
but I didn't really have anything tonight so I don't know I heard the Muppets won the Oscar for whatever they were nominated for

01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:26.320
the songwriter won and apparently Miss Piggy stole it and Matt Smith is on top gear

01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:31.320
well there you go Doctor Who? Who? Who? Exactly

01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:43.320
Loki so Aeon a definitely an MMO I haven't played because I don't play MMOs anymore I played it when it was in beta

01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:54.320
well you may be able to get a chance to play it now because Aeon is going free play and apparently this is coinciding with a 3.0 patch

01:45:54.320 --> 01:46:02.320
one can only hope that a certain other Final Fantasy Online game when it gets its eventual 3.0 patch will go free to play as well

01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:07.320
how in the fuck is 11 not free to play at this point that's what I'm somebody asked that question on Twitter

01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:12.320
like with all these games going free to play how is Final Fantasy 11 I'm not even gonna touch 14

01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:17.320
but how is Final Fantasy 11 still charging but I guess you know 11 does still have its very loyal fan base

01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:25.320
you know they're very attached to that game and it's a fine game it's an MMO it's different it's not wow it's very much not wow

01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:28.320
I played Aeon in the beta it was a little wow

01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:33.320
if 11 goes free to play and they port to the Vita I may never be seen again

01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:37.320
that's right they were talking about 11 on the Vita at one point weren't they

01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:41.320
can you imagine if they know that it's gonna go free to play soon enough

01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:49.320
although you know if you put 11 free to play before Final Fantasy 14 is done you might as well just shoot it because it's dead

01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:52.320
I mean it's no one cares

01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:57.320
the reinvention is gonna be interesting that's all I have to say

01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:02.320
but anyways one can dream but for right now though Aeon is gonna be going free to play

01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:05.320
and the 3.0 patch is right around the corner

01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:09.320
they're saying that they're going to be adding some new zones

01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:13.320
6 new instances they're gonna increase the level cap up to 60 as well as other tweaks

01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:20.320
they're gonna have an extended trial with the level cap of 40 and no time limit

01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:27.320
and of course you know people who I guess are paying for it they'll get free activation for 14 days

01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:36.320
and doesn't say what it's gonna cost I'm assuming there's gonna be some sort of cost thing or some sort of limits for the free to play stuff

01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:39.320
nope doesn't say so no idea

01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:44.320
I was looking at the specs it's like you only get two character slots instead of eight

01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:46.320
oh darn I know

01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:49.320
yeah that's so terrible

01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:53.320
I'm sure they'll try to nickel and dime you that's what a lot of the free MMOs do

01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:55.320
I have my Star Trek online so I'm happy

01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:57.320
how is that free have you tried it?

01:47:58.320 --> 01:47:59.320
I've played it twice

01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:01.320
does it try to nickel and dime you a lot?

01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:07.320
well I mean what it did as far as the nickel and dime thing you have to have cryptic points

01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:12.320
so you actually do have to go in and actively buy a series of points so that you have that

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:17.320
and now instead of saying you can unlock this pack and your content is available

01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:23.320
it actually puts all of the content on there and lets you know what you have unlocked or not or what you can pay to unlock

01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:27.320
so like for costume packs and extra ships and things

01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:33.320
and it does that like say that you go into the clothing store to change your outfit

01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:39.320
it gives you that option while you're in there so I actually really like how that's integrated

01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:43.320
because you can see what they look like on your character and it lets you know whether or not you want to buy it

01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:45.320
that's a really good thing

01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:49.320
so far gameplay wise I haven't really noticed anything different

01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:54.320
keep in mind when I quit playing I was I think a vice admiral

01:48:54.320 --> 01:49:01.320
no I was rear admiral and so I've still got my freaking Defiant with all of its badass stuff on it

01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:06.320
and because I bought content on it I have the medium level account

01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:10.320
so I haven't noticed any difference

01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:13.320
I'm supposed to be meeting up with my fleet

01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:16.320
actually I think later tonight or next week

01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:18.320
better get home

01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:20.320
well keep in mind they're in Scotland

01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:22.320
I'm seven hours behind them

01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:23.320
right

01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:27.320
so I'm supposed to be meeting up with them either this weekend or next

01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:31.320
probably next weekend to have them get me leveled

01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:33.320
very cool

01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:36.320
alright well other quick story for you guys

01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:40.320
this is actually really good news

01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:42.320
a lot of people are very excited to hear about this

01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:46.320
Sega put out a teaser trailer this week, 22 seconds

01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:49.320
and it revealed that a new Jet Set Radio game

01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:53.320
excuse me not a new game but a rebirth of the original game is on its way

01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:57.320
Jet Set Radio for Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network

01:49:58.320 --> 01:49:59.320
if you don't remember

01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:01.320
is it Jet Grind or Jet Set?

01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:03.320
Jet Grind

01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:05.320
Japanese version Jet Set

01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:07.320
American version Jet Grind

01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:09.320
Jet Grind for us

01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:11.320
Jet Set Radio Future was the Xbox one

01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:13.320
Future was the Xbox one that's not the one we're getting

01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:15.320
we're getting the original one from the Dreamcast

01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:17.320
which makes sense we've had half the other Dreamcast games

01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:19.320
the big ones like Space Channel

01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:24.320
although I would be surprised or wouldn't be surprised if they re-released it

01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:27.320
for like you know the Xbox what do they call that

01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:29.320
the ones where you can download the full games

01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:33.320
if it's not already because they have that was a backwards compatible title

01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:35.320
oh that's a good point

01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:38.320
well but here's the thing and it's gonna be interesting to see how it affects this too

01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:42.320
is that while it's really exciting to hear that and it was a good game

01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:45.320
and that was what you skateboarded around into the graffiti it was a lot of fun

01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:46.320
it's a cheap amato

01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:49.320
what's well that's the whole thing the soundtrack

01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:52.320
what happened when Crazy Taxi got re-released

01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:56.320
the fuck was that band

01:50:57.320 --> 01:50:58.320
yeah yeah yeah offspring

01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:00.320
the offspring song was gone

01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:02.320
but Bad Religion wasn't that still

01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:04.320
I think they replaced it with something else

01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:09.320
so it's possible that this game is gonna get a different soundtrack

01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:12.320
and that is probably the same thing that's holding up the original Xbox

01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:18.320
the Jet Set Future from coming out is because they can't get the rights to the soundtrack

01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:21.320
they probably only licensed those songs specifically for that

01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:24.320
and so they can't suddenly put it out on 360

01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:29.320
so we'll see because the soundtrack was a huge part of the game

01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:33.320
so it's like well they could license equally awesome songs

01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:38.320
or they could try and put in generic stuff and see if the game will sell itself on nostalgia alone

01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:40.320
which it probably would

01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:41.320
but it's gonna be very interesting

01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:43.320
very interesting to see

01:51:44.320 --> 01:51:46.320
so anyhow I'm still excited

01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:48.320
so there

01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:51.320
also it is impossible to sing birthday cake without doing

01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:53.320
shut up Penny me

01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:57.320
Miho Hattori's accent

01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:00.320
yes I'm cooking for my son and his wife

01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:02.320
extra sugar extra salt

01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:04.320
I love that song anyhow

01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:06.320
I love this song too

01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:08.320
because it means it's time for the mailbag

01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:09.320
mailbag

01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:11.320
mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:15.320
again the email address is mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:17.320
and that's where you can send us some email

01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:19.320
that we will read here on the show

01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:23.320
and I'm saying that email address one more time because more of you need to use it

01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:26.320
mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:28.320
girl

01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:30.320
we actually did get another email in

01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:32.320
well yay

01:52:33.320 --> 01:52:34.320
after you checked it Mr. Rob

01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:36.320
I'm gonna read it last though

01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:37.320
okay

01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:40.320
this comes from Haseo Sumirogawa

01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:44.320
so maybe it came after I read the last email from him

01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:48.320
also if two people shared two PS3 systems for whatever reason

01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:54.320
and one bought a new copy of let's say Saints Row the Third with the online pass

01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:57.320
and one bought it used without the online pass

01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:00.320
could this person download the online pass from the other person's account

01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:02.320
and be able to play online?

01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:04.320
no

01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:05.320
on the note of online passes

01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:09.320
can a person without one still update their games and get DLC?

01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:11.320
yes you can get DLC

01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:13.320
the only thing you can't do is you can't play

01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:18.320
sadly enough you can't play SystemLink or whatever they call it

01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:23.320
and you can't play online co-op

01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:25.320
well co-op for both of those

01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:27.320
so you can't play co-op but you can't play

01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:30.320
well co-op the horde mode as well

01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:32.320
but the rest of the game you can download the DLC

01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:33.320
you can play single player you can do all that

01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:35.320
you just can't play together

01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:40.320
now on another note I've been playing a Japanese PSP demo for Final Fantasy Type 0

01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:43.320
now I'm wondering if this is ever going to come to America

01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:46.320
and now it ties into the Fabula Nova Crystallis

01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:48.320
it was supposed to be Agito 13

01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:52.320
right I thought it was coming out here or did come out here

01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:54.320
I wish

01:53:55.320 --> 01:53:56.320
hopefully it will

01:53:57.320 --> 01:54:00.320
but anyways thanks for reading my email signed Haseo Sumirogawa

01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:01.320
next email

01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:04.320
greetings OLR it's your friendly neighborhood turtle

01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:06.320
just wanted to say hi and have a good week

01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:08.320
your loyal turtle in Philly, serious turtle

01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:10.320
well thank you

01:54:11.320 --> 01:54:14.320
yeah I guess I'm looking at Amazon it's all imports on there

01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:17.320
they want 104 bucks for that Japanese import

01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:19.320
good lord

01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:22.320
oh chukaboo

01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:24.320
look at that face

01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:26.320
for the record Rob

01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:28.320
that is very cute it's a mascot cushion 50 bucks

01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:29.320
I have to tell you something Rob

01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:30.320
what's that

01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:32.320
every time I play one of my blood elves

01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:36.320
and hop on my whatever the crap their peep things are called

01:54:37.320 --> 01:54:39.320
their striders or whatever

01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:43.320
my brain instantly starts playing the chocobo music

01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:45.320
and Dan was walking in

01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:47.320
while I was writing on one

01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:49.320
and I was actually humming the chocobo theme

01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:51.320
in under city

01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:53.320
and he starts going

01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:55.320
chocobo bop chocobo bop

01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:57.320
chocobo bop so it was cute anyway

01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:00.320
alrighty

01:55:01.320 --> 01:55:02.320
get down to your chocobo bop

01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:04.320
I

01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:06.320
TBA for the North American release

01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:08.320
there's no date for this right now

01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:11.320
that's surprise I could have sworn we had

01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:14.320
that they had confirmed it was coming here and gave a date

01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:16.320
but I guess not

01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:18.320
I would imagine this is an E3 thing

01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:20.320
this is exactly why they're keeping it in their hat

01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:22.320
this is going to be an E3 thing

01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:24.320
maybe there's a problem with it being on PSP

01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:27.320
and not PS Vita at this point too

01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:29.320
but then again

01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:31.320
it came out in Japan with only a couple weeks to go

01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:33.320
before the Vita came out over there

01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:35.320
so they could still do it as a download thing

01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:38.320
they could really push it as a download title here in the US

01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:40.320
so I don't know

01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:43.320
someone doesn't have Japanese text installed on this computer

01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:45.320
yeah I know right

01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:47.320
well this is the show computer not my personal computer

01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:49.320
so but anyway

01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:51.320
I would imagine E3

01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:53.320
you got to hear something on this E3

01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:56.320
this is too big of a title to not get released here

01:55:57.320 --> 01:55:58.320
but we'll see

01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:00.320
can I jump in real quick

01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:02.320
for the chat room

01:56:03.320 --> 01:56:04.320
I wanted to follow up to something else

01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:06.320
I had several people stating this

01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:08.320
something to remember about Jet Set Radio

01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:10.320
is that a lot of the soundtrack was done in house

01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:12.320
so a lot of that will probably stay

01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:14.320
but certainly there was some great licensed music

01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:16.320
like the Chibomato comes to mind

01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:18.320
I really hope they're able to get that to stay

01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:20.320
but chatters you are right

01:56:21.320 --> 01:56:22.320
the original in house stuff will certainly stay

01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:24.320
I'm sure like Space Channel 5 didn't change

01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:26.320
that was all in house

01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:28.320
I mean and also you got to think

01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:30.320
you know the Mexican flyer is now in public domain

01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:32.320
right

01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:34.320
so because that's classic big band

01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:36.320
um

01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:38.320
Dear Orange Lounge

01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:40.320
I wanted to write to someone about my recent good experience

01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:42.320
with Nintendo customer service

01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:44.320
I bought a 3DS the day it came out

01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:45.320
two days before the ambassador program began

01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:47.320
I sent my 3DS through the wash

01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:49.320
now this is understandable if you are maybe 10

01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:51.320
but I am 34

01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:53.320
so I figured that was the end of that

01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:55.320
womp womp

01:56:56.320 --> 01:56:57.320
it was my husband who suggested I send the system in

01:56:58.320 --> 01:56:59.320
for possible repair

01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:01.320
I dragged my heels for several months

01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:03.320
I was sure they would do nothing

01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:05.320
it is $85 to send a system in for repair

01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:07.320
because my system was less than one year old

01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:09.320
I received a $20 discount

01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:11.320
65 days later I had a shopping label

01:57:11.320 --> 01:57:14.320
boxed it up and sent it away

01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:16.320
I explained to them that I sent it through the washer

01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:18.320
and was expecting to get the broken system back

01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:20.320
with a not our problem letter

01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:22.320
wait wait $65 later

01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:24.320
because it was $85 to send them

01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:26.320
but she had a $20 discount

01:57:27.320 --> 01:57:28.320
oh ok I thought for a minute too you said 65 days later

01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:30.320
I don't know why ok ok I'm good

01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:32.320
9 days later the box came back

01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:34.320
a letter explaining that they could not fix the old system

01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:36.320
and had replaced it with a brand new one

01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:38.320
my SD card which I forgot to remove

01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:40.320
was taped to the bottom of the cardboard box

01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:42.320
all of my pictures were still on the card

01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:44.320
it included instructions to redownload the lost content

01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:46.320
at no additional cost

01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:48.320
I had restored all of the games I purchased

01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:50.320
and was really happy with the new system

01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:52.320
and the promptness of their response

01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:54.320
after doing the homework to check the system

01:57:55.320 --> 01:57:56.320
I found they had signed the replacement system

01:57:57.320 --> 01:57:58.320
up for the ambassador program

01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:00.320
all free games were available for me to download

01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:02.320
squeeee

01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:04.320
nice

01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:06.320
I wanted to be able to tell other gamers

01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:07.320
about this wonderful experience

01:58:08.320 --> 01:58:09.320
Nintendo went above and beyond helping a silly old

01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:11.320
don't call yourself old because seriously

01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:13.320
you're younger than me

01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:15.320
silly old lady who can't remember to empty her pockets

01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:17.320
thanks again for your time and your game podcast Emily

01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:20.320
well thank you for the story Emily

01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:22.320
I guess Mayor Muse

01:58:23.320 --> 01:58:24.320
well you know I think there's something though

01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:26.320
with that ambassador program

01:58:27.320 --> 01:58:28.320
because I notice you get a little certificate

01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:30.320
like I'm looking at my 3DS right now

01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:32.320
there's a little certificate that goes

01:58:33.320 --> 01:58:34.320
I have a lot of icons don't I

01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:35.320
but there's this application there that's just

01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:37.320
3DS ambassador certificate

01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:39.320
that's all it is and it sits there

01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:41.320
and when you open it

01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:43.320
all it is if I remember right is

01:58:44.320 --> 01:58:45.320
do you want to opt it like it's just one question

01:58:46.320 --> 01:58:47.320
it says do you want to opt in for notifications

01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:48.320
for this title

01:58:49.320 --> 01:58:50.320
oh no no it's a movie that's what it is

01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:52.320
they just yeah they just recently

01:58:53.320 --> 01:58:54.320
oh but then they say receive notifications

01:58:55.320 --> 01:58:56.320
down there it's all it is

01:58:57.320 --> 01:58:58.320
so it like doesn't really do anything

01:58:59.320 --> 01:59:02.320
but I'm thinking that being on your 3DS

01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:03.320
is what lets you download all that stuff

01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:05.320
and maybe because

01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:07.320
guys it's inevitable that they're gonna

01:59:08.320 --> 01:59:09.320
come out with another 3DS

01:59:10.320 --> 01:59:11.320
like they're gonna incorporate

01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:13.320
that second circle pad into a new 3DS

01:59:14.320 --> 01:59:15.320
at some point so I've got to be able

01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:17.320
to transfer my ambassador shit over there

01:59:18.320 --> 01:59:19.320
so I'm thinking that little guy being

01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:22.320
there is the key somehow

01:59:23.320 --> 01:59:24.320
this probably ties to my console

01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:27.320
number somehow and Nintendo probably

01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:30.320
can generate that somehow in-house

01:59:30.320 --> 01:59:31.320
and did for your

01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:33.320
you know when you sent your 3DS back

01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:35.320
but that's great I mean you're right

01:59:36.320 --> 01:59:37.320
not a lot of folks would do that

01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:39.320
oh hey my spot pass notification

01:59:40.320 --> 01:59:41.320
just went off look at that

01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:43.320
oh that means kitty pictures

01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:45.320
in 3D oh lord

01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:48.320
yes it's a swap note

01:59:49.320 --> 01:59:50.320
oh squee I'm gonna look that up

01:59:51.320 --> 01:59:52.320
oh great all right

01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:54.320
well a Rick Santorum portrait made

01:59:55.320 --> 01:59:56.320
entirely of gay porn

01:59:57.320 --> 01:59:58.320
talked about that on Horde house already

01:59:58.320 --> 01:59:59.320
wow it's made up of a lot of legs

02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:01.320
um so yeah

02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:04.320
that's it for the emails

02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:06.320
I want to see more good

02:00:07.320 --> 02:00:08.320
customer service

02:00:09.320 --> 02:00:10.320
messages like that

02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:12.320
that makes me feel

02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:14.320
joyous in my soul

02:00:15.320 --> 02:00:16.320
Bobby is in our chat room

02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:18.320
by black wolf saying Rob

02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:20.320
all that certificate does is let

02:00:21.320 --> 02:00:22.320
you get spot pass notifications

02:00:23.320 --> 02:00:24.320
well yeah that's what the app does

02:00:25.320 --> 02:00:26.320
but I thought and I could have

02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:27.320
thought wrong that somehow that

02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:29.320
application existing

02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:31.320
was what kind of enabled my 3DS

02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:34.320
to get all that

02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:36.320
because obviously they've got to be

02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:38.320
looking at the MAC address

02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:40.320
on my system or something on the

02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:42.320
back end that tells them

02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:44.320
but all right

02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:46.320
Tigerclaw saying he sent me a swap

02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:48.320
note earlier maybe it's finally

02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:50.320
getting here it seems like it takes

02:00:51.320 --> 02:00:52.320
a couple hours for things to get here

02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:54.320
no this is wrong Rama has sent me a cat

02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:55.320
this is Indy

02:00:56.320 --> 02:00:57.320
he purrs like a race car

02:00:58.320 --> 02:00:59.320
oh because his name's Indy

02:01:00.320 --> 02:01:01.320
look at that there's Indy

02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:03.320
sorry I'm derailing I'm derailing

02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:05.320
this radio show with my 3D pictures

02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:07.320
all right

02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:09.320
any more emails

02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:11.320
you just made my eyes hurt

02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:13.320
here

02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:15.320
sorry

02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:17.320
all right then let's get to the F user

02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:19.320
Sam does that shit to me too with his phone

02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:21.320
because he has that Android phone

02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:23.320
he has that 3D pictures oh really here

02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:25.320
let me do this there all right now I'm

02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:27.320
not looking at it I'll close it it's

02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:29.320
fine all right let's get what an

02:01:30.320 --> 02:01:31.320
appropriate time to get to the FUs of

02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:33.320
the week

02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:48.320
my FU of the week I have a few actually

02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:51.320
because I've had a pissy week number one

02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:58.320
to me and involuntary actions of myself

02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:05.320
also FU to misunderstandings and

02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:10.320
fundamental things and then the last one

02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:15.320
goes to people being complete assholes to

02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:18.320
their family members you know you got to

02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:21.320
think about when kids are little the

02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:24.320
stuff that you're doing to them you know

02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:26.320
you can do stuff that's gonna scar them

02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:28.320
for life you can be too hard too pushy

02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:30.320
you never know how it's gonna affect

02:02:31.320 --> 02:02:32.320
somebody so be careful and don't be an

02:02:33.320 --> 02:02:36.320
asshole don't be an asshole good advice

02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:38.320
to anybody just because you're a parent

02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:40.320
doesn't mean you can be an asshole your

02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:44.320
kids treat them with respect too that's

02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:47.320
it all right Loki like you the people

02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:49.320
that don't know how to put lids on fast

02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:52.320
food drinks I mean seriously it's not

02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:55.320
that hard people it's not hard to snap a

02:02:56.320 --> 02:02:57.320
lid on there you really don't have that

02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:00.320
skill set then you should just jump off a

02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:07.320
bridge I think my FU of the week isn't

02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:09.320
that serious because luckily things have

02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:11.320
been pretty good this week so I can't

02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:13.320
complain too much but I will give an FU

02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:15.320
FU to the fact that I forgot I have a

02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:17.320
doctor's appointment in the morning and

02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:19.320
I have like this stack of paperwork I

02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:21.320
have to fill out like I really don't want

02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:23.320
to do that tonight after the show but I

02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:25.320
have to but I will say an FU a very

02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:28.320
serious FU to this amazing dessert I had

02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:30.320
at BJ's which yes is the name of a

02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:32.320
restaurant get your mind out of the

02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:36.320
gutter it I had a pizookie their flavor

02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:39.320
right now is red velvet pizookie oh my

02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:43.320
god you bitch it is so I thought I

02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:45.320
haven't been to BJ's in a while the last

02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:47.320
time I was there they only had like the

02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:50.320
chocolate and the peanut butter Oreo and

02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:52.320
regular juice did it still taste like

02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:54.320
eating granulated sugar kinda but I

02:03:55.320 --> 02:03:57.320
didn't even care chocolate chip or chunk

02:03:57.320 --> 02:04:01.320
or whatever but but but but red velvet

02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:05.320
oh my god so I'm torn because they're

02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:08.320
they're putting in a chick-fil-a and

02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:12.320
Folsom now your chick-fil-a openly

02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:16.320
supports you propaganda against you know

02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:19.320
the gays and that community and stuff

02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:21.320
but their breakfast sandwiches are so

02:04:22.320 --> 02:04:23.320
delicious it if it's it's actually okay

02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:25.320
in Sacramento because the local

02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:27.320
franchise owners here in Sacramento

02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:30.320
actually support pro-lgbt but is that one

02:04:31.320 --> 02:04:32.320
the same franchise or that's it don't

02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:34.320
have to check you'll have to check but

02:04:35.320 --> 02:04:36.320
hopefully but the Arden one the owners

02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:38.320
are on the lavender team they are on the

02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:40.320
Rainbow Chamber of Commerce because they

02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:42.320
are lavender here well whatever it's

02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:44.320
whatever it's gay but one of the owners

02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:46.320
they're just no they're a couple they

02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:50.320
just want to they've offset you know I

02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:52.320
mean animals images of chick-fil-a I

02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:54.320
know the corporate thing still goes

02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:59.320
towards those big charities but I like

02:05:00.320 --> 02:05:01.320
to think that they're a little bit is

02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:03.320
offsetting that part of what chick-fil-a

02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:05.320
does and that you know the children's

02:05:06.320 --> 02:05:07.320
programs and everything and the

02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:09.320
education programs are still good I

02:05:10.320 --> 02:05:11.320
don't know it's hard to be okay with a

02:05:12.320 --> 02:05:13.320
service that is preaching hate in one

02:05:14.320 --> 02:05:15.320
hand yet doing really good things for

02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:17.320
kids you know I don't I don't know what

02:05:17.320 --> 02:05:22.320
to think my brain explodes JV Mon just

02:05:22.320 --> 02:05:24.320
had the balls to tell me in chat that

02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:26.320
red velvet is overrated you know what my

02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:31.320
response was get out all right he can

02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:33.320
stay but don't you ever talk bad about

02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:36.320
red velvet again all right moving on so

02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:38.320

02:06:08.320 --> 02:06:09.320
lived in Alabama but I worked in the mall

02:06:09.320 --> 02:06:11.320
I worked there they would always save me

02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:13.320
the little tiny hash brown things from

02:06:14.320 --> 02:06:15.320

in Polynesian sauce are crack let's move

02:06:22.320 --> 02:06:24.320
on so we can get to Twitter topics in

02:06:25.320 --> 02:06:26.320
the skype line at one eight seven seven

02:06:27.320 --> 02:06:28.320
game olr but not just yet because we have

02:06:29.320 --> 02:06:30.320
just a few more stories for you guys

02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:33.320
Loki now this is kind of weird they're

02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:36.320
actually gonna be putting out a free to

02:06:36.320 --> 02:06:39.320
play multiplayer version of Killzone 3

02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:41.320
on the PlayStation now this is the

02:06:42.320 --> 02:06:45.320
multiplayer portion of Killzone 3 it's

02:06:46.320 --> 02:06:47.320
not really anything new but it's gonna

02:06:48.320 --> 02:06:49.320
be free to play up to a level cap of

02:06:50.320 --> 02:06:52.320
course you're gonna have a certain level

02:06:53.320 --> 02:06:54.320
cap and you can play up to that if you

02:06:55.320 --> 02:06:56.320
want to continue leveling up you'll have

02:06:57.320 --> 02:06:58.320
to pay $14.99 for the full experience but

02:06:59.320 --> 02:07:00.320
kind of got me thinking I mean that's

02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:02.320
kind of interesting that they do that I

02:07:03.320 --> 02:07:04.320
mean imagine like if Activision that with

02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:06.320
Call of Duty because you got a minute

02:07:07.320 --> 02:07:08.320
most of the people are paying for the

02:07:09.320 --> 02:07:11.320
multiplayer portion of Call of Duty not

02:07:12.320 --> 02:07:14.320
so much the campaign you could just kind

02:07:15.320 --> 02:07:16.320
of skip the pleasantries and just get the

02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:18.320
multiplayer portion plus it's free to

02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:20.320
play I mean it's an interesting

02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:22.320
experiment that they're trying that is I

02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:30.320
guess available available soon on

02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:33.320
Tuesday sorry I'm furiously adding

02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:35.320
people to my 3ds over yours I had

02:07:36.320 --> 02:07:37.320
somebody asked for cat pics so I needed

02:07:38.320 --> 02:07:42.320
a friend code all right I'm trying to

02:07:43.320 --> 02:07:44.320
think of other cases where this has been

02:07:45.320 --> 02:07:46.320
done before where they stripped out part

02:07:47.320 --> 02:07:47.320
of the game and then kind of like put it

02:07:48.320 --> 02:07:49.320
up on the marketplace just I don't really

02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:51.320
have by its own this is kind of new kind

02:07:52.320 --> 02:07:54.320
of interesting um we have a story last

02:07:55.320 --> 02:07:57.320
week about Metal Gear Solid 4's online

02:07:57.320 --> 02:07:59.320
component was shutting down yeah and it

02:08:00.320 --> 02:08:01.320
seems strange to me they didn't try to

02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:03.320
strip that out at some point kind of

02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:05.320
make it a standalone game hmm because no

02:08:06.320 --> 02:08:07.320
one played it that's why they shut

02:08:08.320 --> 02:08:09.320
servers and they're like well we'll just

02:08:10.320 --> 02:08:11.320
disappoint those two people still playing

02:08:12.320 --> 02:08:13.320
there more people playing Killzone than

02:08:14.320 --> 02:08:15.320
Metal Gear Solid I guess I don't think

02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:17.320
there's probably that many people playing

02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:19.320
Killzone that I think maybe they get

02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:21.320
more it's a good experiment we'll see

02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:25.320
what happens all right all right so um

02:08:25.320 --> 02:08:26.320
Dark Sakura listen up because this is a

02:08:27.320 --> 02:08:30.320
relevant interest to you grin was a big

02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:32.320
studio that shut down a couple years ago

02:08:33.320 --> 02:08:35.320
what year did they shut down was 2009 it

02:08:36.320 --> 02:08:37.320
was right after bionic commander which is

02:08:38.320 --> 02:08:39.320
sad that game was not bad I know the

02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:41.320
internet disagrees with you bionic

02:08:42.320 --> 02:08:43.320
commander rearmed was awesome but grin

02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:45.320
did kind of meet an untimely fate and

02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:48.320
they were working on a lot of shit like

02:08:49.320 --> 02:08:50.320
they had that Final Fantasy fortress

02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:52.320
game right or whatever that was we'll

02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:56.320
get this apparently Barcelona grin their

02:08:57.320 --> 02:08:58.320
studio there was working on these

02:08:59.320 --> 02:09:00.320
projects this grin Barcelona closed

02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:02.320
first they were like the first shoe

02:09:03.320 --> 02:09:04.320
dropping and then grin mean closing was

02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:07.320
the other shoe but grin Barcelona was

02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:10.320
apparently working on a Strider reboot

02:09:11.320 --> 02:09:13.320
that's what that's what they were working

02:09:14.320 --> 02:09:15.320
on they had and there's even this teaser

02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:17.320
video that goes with it and all it is

02:09:18.320 --> 02:09:19.320
it's pretty badass actually it's uh this

02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:21.320
you know it's just this little like Russian

02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:23.320
spy looking dude like if you remember the

02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:25.320
movie spies like us he looks like that

02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:27.320
he's just kind of standing there he's

02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:29.320
putting up a little poster and then all

02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:31.320
of a sudden see here's the little thing

02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:34.320
and then just out of nowhere whack you

02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:38.320
hear a little freak and oh there's all

02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:45.320
this blood everywhere like a little one

02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:47.320
of those little quick blade things and

02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:48.320
then all of a sudden you mean the cipher

02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:52.320
yeah that's a ciphering because this

02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:54.320
totally reminds me the opening the cube

02:09:55.320 --> 02:09:58.320
oh you got something happen sucks to be

02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:00.320
that guy well here's the thing though

02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:03.320
Capcom worked or excuse me grin Barcelona

02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:07.320
worked on that Capcom rejected it Capcom

02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:09.320
canceled the project grin was gonna do

02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:13.320
it anyway and just change the IP make it

02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:15.320
like you know ninja game you know or

02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:17.320
something a little different but after

02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:21.320
that didn't happen it got canceled they

02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:24.320
tried to do a Streets of Rage reboot

02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:27.320
instead and Sega it didn't happen they

02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:30.320
got shut down so it's very I mean grin

02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:33.320
did bionic commando they were trying

02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:36.320
Strider they were doing Final Fantasy

02:10:37.320 --> 02:10:39.320
they apparently had Streets of Rage

02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:41.320
goddamn they were working on a lot of

02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:43.320
like classic reboots I don't think any

02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:45.320
of us realize like how vested they were

02:10:46.320 --> 02:10:48.320
in bringing back I'm just imagining a

02:10:49.320 --> 02:10:51.320
Metal Gear Solid style game with Strider

02:10:52.320 --> 02:10:54.320
hear you mm-hmm in concept you kind of

02:10:55.320 --> 02:10:58.320
look at it so Metal Gear Rising

02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:01.320
revengeance which revengeance is such a

02:11:02.320 --> 02:11:04.320
stupid name that's the Capcom Namco Sega

02:11:05.320 --> 02:11:10.320
project okay maybe not it's a dumb name

02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:12.320
but yeah there's a bunch of artwork on

02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:14.320
this Spanish website that you can you

02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:16.320
know kind of look at some of the concept

02:11:17.320 --> 02:11:18.320
art for the Strider thing that got

02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:20.320
canceled you know I don't actually see

02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:22.320
Strider just you know cuz they had to

02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:24.320
change it that makes me sad so that's

02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:26.320
something they'll probably show at e3 is

02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:29.320
no rising stuff oh yeah Metal Gear I was

02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:32.320
like what are you talking about grin got

02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:34.320
canned in 2009 though Capcom really

02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:36.320
should do Strider because what else do

02:11:37.320 --> 02:11:38.320
they got they were the rebooting Devil

02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:40.320
Gear I guess and I just saw some article

02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:42.320
on the internet this week too about like

02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:45.320
it was defending Strider only you posted

02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:47.320
on Facebook for Dan it was the whole

02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:49.320
thing about Strider on the NES was not

02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:51.320
that bad yeah it was actually based off

02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:53.320
the Strider manga and I was reading and

02:11:54.320 --> 02:11:55.320
I was going I agree I love Strider on the

02:11:56.320 --> 02:11:57.320
NES like it was awesome that's how I

02:11:58.320 --> 02:11:59.320
remember Strider because I didn't own any

02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:01.320
Sega stuff growing up it wasn't till the

02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:03.320
dreamcast well also though if you were a

02:12:04.320 --> 02:12:05.320
big fan though of the arcade Strider

02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:07.320
games that's what that moon dancer is

02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:09.320
actually by the guy that made the first

02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:12.320
Strider arcade game and he of course he

02:12:13.320 --> 02:12:15.320
also worked on Strider 2 which is easy

02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:18.320
but very fun and but that moon dancer is

02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:20.320
like basically like a four player Strider

02:12:21.320 --> 02:12:23.320
yeah it is it's cool I like that so all

02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:26.320
right there you go just interesting that

02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:28.320
that studio was working on all that and

02:12:29.320 --> 02:12:31.320
finally got leaked by a disgruntled

02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:34.320
community well we need more describe I

02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:37.320
mean not really so um you know that

02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:39.320
Oklahoma law that we had actually

02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:41.320
discussed before about a bill to put a

02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:44.320
1% tax on violent video games well it

02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:48.320
failed like we knew it would basically

02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:51.320
um god this guy has such an awesomely

02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:55.320
badass name too bad he's you know stupid

02:12:55.320 --> 02:13:00.320
william fourkiller fourkiller rawr anyway

02:13:01.320 --> 02:13:03.320
he suggested that any game with an ESRB

02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:05.320
rating of teen or above should have the

02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:07.320
tax on it and that the revenue would go

02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:09.320
to fighting childhood obesity and

02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:12.320
bullying it was tweaked to focus on

02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:15.320
creating a task force into the

02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:17.320
relationship of video games to the two

02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:20.320
issues and it was voted down by a margin

02:13:20.320 --> 02:13:24.320
of five to six and so one of the other

02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:27.320
representatives Pat OMB asked why video

02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:29.320
games why not french fries or rap music

02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:31.320
or movies and fourkiller said we have to

02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:33.320
start somewhere there's no magic bullet

02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:35.320
that will solve these issues but I

02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:37.320
wanted to raise awareness of those two

02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:40.320
issues and basically everyone said

02:13:41.320 --> 02:13:43.320
representative Mike Reynolds said it's

02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:45.320
not a good idea we could have a task

02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:47.320
force on the multiple reasons of

02:13:47.320 --> 02:13:52.320
childhood obesity so nope basically it's

02:13:53.320 --> 02:13:54.320
been failing it failed before in New

02:13:55.320 --> 02:13:56.320
Mexico in 2008 at least your state won't

02:13:57.320 --> 02:13:58.320
be spending 1.8 million dollars to

02:13:59.320 --> 02:14:03.320
defend it in court saying yes exactly

02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:07.320
flu indeed all right anyhow yeah that's

02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:13.320
it moving on Loki all right so we've

02:14:14.320 --> 02:14:15.320
kind of seen this type of thing happen

02:14:15.320 --> 02:14:17.320
before and kind of know where it's gonna

02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:19.320
go but we'll give them the benefit of

02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:21.320
the doubt apparently there's a new game

02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:23.320
called band fuse that's going to be

02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:25.320
coming out band fuse rock legends it

02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:30.320
uses real guitars to play learn music or

02:14:31.320 --> 02:14:32.320
whatever and also they're having

02:14:33.320 --> 02:14:34.320
microphones involved in this as well so

02:14:35.320 --> 02:14:38.320
they're singing and guitars the kind of

02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:40.320
unique thing about it is actually it's

02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:43.320
real guitar for guitar tabs that are

02:14:43.320 --> 02:14:46.320
gonna be kind of streaming across there

02:14:47.320 --> 02:14:48.320
so it actually shows what frets to use

02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:51.320
and stuff really weird layout there but

02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:55.320
they've got you know a bunch of big name

02:14:56.320 --> 02:14:59.320
artists in it as well I want to say this

02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:02.320
is being put out by because I saw this a

02:15:03.320 --> 02:15:04.320
while back and I was like I good another

02:15:05.320 --> 02:15:06.320
music game the guitar game I can't

02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:08.320
remember who's publishing it I want to

02:15:09.320 --> 02:15:10.320
say it's like a really small company like

02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:12.320
maximum family games or something like

02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:16.320
that so it's gonna be like no sort of

02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:22.320
advertising or whatever on it but yeah

02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:24.320
and we coming out this fall and probably

02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:26.320
will do just about as well as what was

02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:30.320
that our gig power gig because I was

02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:33.320
gonna say um I think this game already

02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:36.320
exists like twice well yeah right one of

02:15:37.320 --> 02:15:38.320
one of them is doing pretty well and the

02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:41.320
other one not as well rocksmith did okay

02:15:42.320 --> 02:15:45.320
but power gig tanked right I think it's

02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:49.320
just that whole well you have to buy a

02:15:50.320 --> 02:15:52.320
guitar if you don't already have one and

02:15:53.320 --> 02:15:56.320
I mean if you have one you probably you

02:15:57.320 --> 02:15:58.320
probably have other ways to learn how to

02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:01.320
play guitar other than buying a $60 game

02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:03.320
I well you know what though I think I

02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:05.320
talked about this a couple weeks ago on

02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:07.320
the show is that I know I don't know

02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:09.320
anyone who bought power gig but I do know

02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:11.320
some actual musicians who bought

02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:13.320
rocksmith just you know because it was

02:16:14.320 --> 02:16:15.320
kind of something that was relevant to

02:16:16.320 --> 02:16:17.320
their interest and they're really into it

02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:19.320
because it's it's it's so it's it's it's

02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:21.320
actual guitar playing unlike you know

02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:23.320
rock band is where the plastic

02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:25.320
instruments although rock band tried to

02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:27.320
incorporate it I guess rocksmith takes a

02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:30.320
much better teaching approach to it you

02:16:31.320 --> 02:16:32.320
know and I think a lot of musicians

02:16:32.320 --> 02:16:34.320
that's what I'm seeing but is it does it

02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:36.320
necessitate three different games no but

02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:38.320
then again we didn't really need rock

02:16:39.320 --> 02:16:43.320
revolution either so this I hate to say

02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:45.320
it but I think this band fuse rock

02:16:46.320 --> 02:16:47.320
legends is gonna end up being the rock

02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:49.320
revolution of the bunch I mean yeah we'll

02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:51.320
see we'll see what they do with it who

02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:56.320
knows so yeah all right anyhow one more

02:16:57.320 --> 02:16:58.320
story for you guys then we're gonna open

02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:00.320
up the skype line and I think this is

02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:05.320
great news an old classic game is coming

02:17:06.320 --> 02:17:10.320
back to the 3ds c-man yay that's right

02:17:11.320 --> 02:17:12.320
c-man get your minds out of the gutter

02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:18.320
c-man with an a c-man is coming out on

02:17:19.320 --> 02:17:21.320
the 3ds it is a report from a japanese

02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:26.320
news outlet named Nick Nick a c-man is

02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:29.320
apparently targeted by Nintendo to come

02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:33.320
back to the 3ds that's the type of thing

02:17:34.320 --> 02:17:35.320
that Nintendo is targeting but there's

02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:37.320
no other detail on the update so I don't

02:17:38.320 --> 02:17:39.320
think we're talking about just like a

02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:41.320
dump of the Dreamcast game I think we're

02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:45.320
talking about like a new reimagining of

02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:47.320
the game which you know is cool because

02:17:48.320 --> 02:17:49.320
they're thinking kind of outside the box

02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:51.320
a little bit with not just a game but

02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:53.320
more of the simulation Jamie you know

02:17:53.320 --> 02:17:55.320
more about this game than the rest of us

02:17:56.320 --> 02:17:57.320
what was c-man like how can you describe

02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:01.320
this game weird um basically you started

02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:03.320
off listening to Leonard Nimoy's voice

02:18:04.320 --> 02:18:06.320
and you got these little eggs and you

02:18:07.320 --> 02:18:08.320
would take care of your little baby

02:18:09.320 --> 02:18:10.320
spores and raise them and they would

02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:12.320
eventually turn into little fishy people

02:18:13.320 --> 02:18:15.320
that would say cute things like marmar

02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:17.320
and you keep talking to them and

02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:19.320
eventually they would start talking back

02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:21.320
and ask you questions and be kind of rude

02:18:21.320 --> 02:18:22.320
to you and then they would eventually

02:18:23.320 --> 02:18:24.320
because you had to moderate their

02:18:25.320 --> 02:18:27.320
temperature in their tank and water level

02:18:28.320 --> 02:18:29.320
and all of this and eventually they would

02:18:30.320 --> 02:18:31.320
grow amphibious and you would turn their

02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:33.320
little thing into a terrarium and then

02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:38.320
marmar mar. Dan and I would say that over

02:18:39.320 --> 02:18:40.320
and over again when we were first playing

02:18:41.320 --> 02:18:42.320
that game and then then we got hey you

02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:45.320
pikachu which was which already existed

02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:47.320
oh did it oh I believe it did it was

02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:49.320
actually called Pikachu Genki de Chu

02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:52.320
um and that actually was already out in

02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:55.320
Japan but then it brought us one of the

02:18:56.320 --> 02:18:58.320
best youtubes we've ever played on OLR

02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:00.320
and I'm so excited we have an excuse to

02:19:01.320 --> 02:19:02.320
play this again all credit goes to the

02:19:03.320 --> 02:19:04.320

assuming the hardest one whatever seems

02:23:08.320 --> 02:23:09.320
like it from Twitter all because of the

02:23:10.320 --> 02:23:11.320
picture of them drinking little bottles

02:23:12.320 --> 02:23:14.320

saying I'll Oscar your butt wow well

02:23:53.320 --> 02:23:55.320
played what's on your mind Rama I went

02:23:55.320 --> 02:23:58.320
out and got a 3ds that's why you were

02:23:59.320 --> 02:24:01.320
dogging on the Vita and chat cuz I was

02:24:02.320 --> 02:24:04.320
like man Ron was hating on the Vita oh

02:24:05.320 --> 02:24:06.320
now it's explained you just bought a 3ds

02:24:07.320 --> 02:24:09.320
actually no I have other reasons for

02:24:10.320 --> 02:24:11.320
hating on 3ds all right let's talk about

02:24:12.320 --> 02:24:13.320
your seething hatred first why wait wait

02:24:14.320 --> 02:24:15.320
you have reasons for hating on 3ds not

02:24:16.320 --> 02:24:19.320
no no not the 3ds okay oh what are your

02:24:20.320 --> 02:24:22.320
reasons from hating on the Vita I still

02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:25.320
stand by the point of the price of it I

02:24:26.320 --> 02:24:28.320
mean cuz I remember when the PSP came

02:24:29.320 --> 02:24:30.320
out and I was there selling them and

02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:33.320
then it's like that whole week they sold

02:24:34.320 --> 02:24:35.320
it after that it just dropped nobody

02:24:36.320 --> 02:24:38.320
wanted one there were it just didn't go

02:24:39.320 --> 02:24:41.320
anywhere I just feel that it's the Vita

02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:43.320
may have to say that with the Vita and I

02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:46.320
understand that Sony's going to stand

02:24:47.320 --> 02:24:48.320
with the ps3 for premium system you have

02:24:48.320 --> 02:24:51.320
to pay a premium price I just think that

02:24:52.320 --> 02:24:54.320
Nintendo kind of set the price point of

02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:56.320
where if the comp if the portable

02:24:57.320 --> 02:24:59.320
consoles like under 150 bucks or within

02:25:00.320 --> 02:25:02.320
the 150 $200 range it's well worth it but

02:25:03.320 --> 02:25:05.320
for 249 for a portable console or 299 for

02:25:06.320 --> 02:25:08.320
a full for another portable console you

02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:10.320
better off just buying a regular system

02:25:11.320 --> 02:25:14.320
hooking it up to your TV all right I

02:25:15.320 --> 02:25:16.320
mean I can say that you know I can see

02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:18.320
that the 299 is for the you know 3g model

02:25:19.320 --> 02:25:21.320
and that'll buy a PlayStation 3 so I I

02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:24.320
can see where the price is is hurting

02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:27.320
people but I don't know I'm a sucker for

02:25:28.320 --> 02:25:30.320
this shit what can I say I'm not hating

02:25:31.320 --> 02:25:33.320
I'm saying I want a Vita but I will I

02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:35.320
will gladly wait till the price comes

02:25:36.320 --> 02:25:37.320
down you know I just I just can't see you

02:25:38.320 --> 02:25:39.320
know 250 for a portable console but I

02:25:40.320 --> 02:25:42.320
could put that towards a system hook up

02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:45.320
to my TV you know it's you know all

02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:47.320
right so let's let's let's let's make

02:25:48.320 --> 02:25:49.320
this a conversation about love instead

02:25:50.320 --> 02:25:51.320
so you bought your 3ds yeah I'm assuming

02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:55.320
you like it love it yeah mm-hmm well

02:25:56.320 --> 02:25:57.320
what what made you what made you decide

02:25:58.320 --> 02:25:59.320
I'm gonna take the plunge and get a 3ds

02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:05.320
Mario Kart 7 is that it Mario Kart 7 was

02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:07.320
a good enough game where you were like

02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:09.320
that's it I'm buying it or is there stuff

02:26:09.320 --> 02:26:11.320
on the horizon actually at first that's

02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:13.320
what that really did it because I love

02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:15.320
playing a Mario Kart racing games and

02:26:16.320 --> 02:26:17.320
but when I would get my 3ds they were

02:26:18.320 --> 02:26:19.320
sold out of it I'm looking at whatever

02:26:20.320 --> 02:26:22.320
games was left and I found upon the last

02:26:23.320 --> 02:26:25.320
copy of Star Fox 64 3ds I picked that up

02:26:26.320 --> 02:26:27.320
and those are my games I've been playing

02:26:28.320 --> 02:26:31.320
back and forth all right well what are

02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:33.320
you looking forward to in the future from

02:26:34.320 --> 02:26:35.320
3ds or is Mario Kart 7 gonna last you

02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:37.320
through 2013 I don't know it's gonna last

02:26:37.320 --> 02:26:40.320
through 2013 but I've already swap note

02:26:41.320 --> 02:26:44.320
will oh oh yeah 3ds kitties I know I'm

02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:47.320
glad you like the kitty I did do you

02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:49.320
like do you like the 3d cats I send you

02:26:50.320 --> 02:26:52.320
of course now that we have now we have a

02:26:53.320 --> 02:26:54.320
cat his name is India I have to start

02:26:55.320 --> 02:26:56.320
taking a few more shots and sending them

02:26:57.320 --> 02:26:58.320
over to everyone right answer and then

02:26:59.320 --> 02:27:00.320
I'll show your cat to my cat and it'll be

02:27:01.320 --> 02:27:02.320
awkward because cats can't see the 3d but

02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:06.320
anyway yeah I find it kind of amusing

02:27:07.320 --> 02:27:08.320
like you like you say about swap note

02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:10.320
because this whole weekend I'm at manga

02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:14.320
next and as I sit down pull up my 3ds to

02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:17.320
play a game I see the little icon to go

02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:19.320
to the meat Plaza and I'm like going

02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:22.320
through all find me and the puzzle swap

02:27:23.320 --> 02:27:24.320
and I'm like at this rate I will not get

02:27:25.320 --> 02:27:26.320
a chance to play the games that I want

02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:29.320
to play oh yeah it's the cons you get

02:27:29.320 --> 02:27:31.320
that stuff crazy fast like you know I

02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:34.320
can't even tell you last year at e3 keep

02:27:35.320 --> 02:27:36.320
in mind the price drop hadn't happened

02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:38.320
yet I was sitting there in the e3 oh my

02:27:39.320 --> 02:27:40.320
god I just like you would open up your

02:27:41.320 --> 02:27:42.320
3ds and 10 characters are there you

02:27:43.320 --> 02:27:44.320
process them all and good take them

02:27:45.320 --> 02:27:46.320
through find me and then another five

02:27:47.320 --> 02:27:48.320
more have arrived like it's crazy I've

02:27:49.320 --> 02:27:50.320
noticed that at 10 that's it only lets

02:27:51.320 --> 02:27:52.320
you it only lets you to bring 10 friends

02:27:53.320 --> 02:27:58.320
in at a time yes tip and pro tip so but

02:27:58.320 --> 02:28:00.320
now there's find me too and now there's

02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:03.320
puzzle swaps and been bigger so there's

02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:05.320
even more to StreetPass with and I will

02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:07.320
say this since we kind of talking about

02:28:08.320 --> 02:28:10.320
the Vita versus the 3ds the street

02:28:11.320 --> 02:28:12.320
passing makes a lot more sense than near

02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:14.320
to me right now I don't get near near

02:28:15.320 --> 02:28:16.320

02:28:17.320 --> 02:28:20.320
free shit the app Rob click the button

02:28:21.320 --> 02:28:22.320

shit yeah I know even I get it randomly

02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:27.320

it's a shame don't care anymore I like

02:33:33.320 --> 02:33:34.320
I had some popular people the only

02:33:35.320 --> 02:33:36.320
reason I tuned into like you know shows

02:33:37.320 --> 02:33:38.320
it's time for a girl to win and I you

02:33:39.320 --> 02:33:40.320
know but here's the thing after kind of

02:33:41.320 --> 02:33:42.320
you know talking to Oscar and watching

02:33:43.320 --> 02:33:44.320
what played out in that second week

02:33:45.320 --> 02:33:46.320
episode you know I don't really want to

02:33:47.320 --> 02:33:48.320
form my opinions off these people on

02:33:49.320 --> 02:33:50.320
what I'm seeing on TV if I had the time

02:33:51.320 --> 02:33:52.320
here on olr we get them all on in fact we

02:33:53.320 --> 02:33:54.320
should make all ten of them call in and

02:33:55.320 --> 02:33:56.320
they'll all have to fight each other for

02:33:56.320 --> 02:33:57.320
the first time or something I don't know

02:33:58.320 --> 02:34:00.320
but but if I had to go based off what

02:34:01.320 --> 02:34:03.320
I've seen on the TV I like the girl with

02:34:04.320 --> 02:34:05.320
the tattoos I think a girl needs to win

02:34:06.320 --> 02:34:07.320
it's time for some girl power and I want

02:34:08.320 --> 02:34:09.320
I would like to see that girl with the

02:34:10.320 --> 02:34:11.320
tattoos seems really cool so we'll see I

02:34:12.320 --> 02:34:14.320

been pimping he's supposed to be a guest

02:35:03.320 --> 02:35:05.320
on some IGN show that sounds a lot like

02:35:06.320 --> 02:35:08.320
the tester but it's like game design so

02:35:09.320 --> 02:35:11.320

02:35:12.320 --> 02:35:14.320
I really wish I hadn't but yeah it's

02:35:14.320 --> 02:35:17.320
basically a show where they have a bunch

02:35:18.320 --> 02:35:19.320

whatever bitch I have to to host my own

02:35:44.320 --> 02:35:45.320
game show and you know what the price

02:35:46.320 --> 02:35:47.320
should be is hosting a revival of press

02:35:48.320 --> 02:35:49.320
your luck done the right way not that

02:35:50.320 --> 02:35:51.320
whammy shit they did on GSN a couple

02:35:52.320 --> 02:35:53.320
years ago I'm talking old school pressure

02:35:54.320 --> 02:35:56.320
luck old school set why not it's a it's

02:35:57.320 --> 02:35:58.320
a Facebook game right now it's got a lot

02:35:59.320 --> 02:36:00.320
of people playing it so yes I want to

02:36:01.320 --> 02:36:02.320
host the new press your luck and I will

02:36:03.320 --> 02:36:04.320
I will do a reality competition to do it

02:36:05.320 --> 02:36:06.320
if I have to just saying there are hits

02:36:06.320 --> 02:36:10.320
on LinkedIn and chat twitch TV or www.

02:36:11.320 --> 02:36:13.320
twitch.tv so it's a Capcom thing yes

Street Fighter I'm sorry Street Fighter

02:36:24.320 --> 02:36:25.320
cross Tekken because you know Tekken had

02:36:26.320 --> 02:36:28.320
you know bad box art Mega Man and you

02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:31.320

02:36:33.320 --> 02:36:35.320
second to see if anyone's gonna call

02:36:36.320 --> 02:36:37.320
username on skype is orange lounge radio

02:36:38.320 --> 02:36:39.320
or one eight seven seven game olr you

02:36:40.320 --> 02:36:41.320
know I would expect there's less people

02:36:42.320 --> 02:36:43.320
listening tonight because of the Oscars

02:36:44.320 --> 02:36:45.320
and all that stuff but our chat rooms

02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:47.320
hopping so I'm surprised there's not more

02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:49.320
people wanting to call but if you all

02:36:50.320 --> 02:36:51.320
are gonna be shy that's fine going to

02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:53.320
Twitter Tiger Claw sent me a lot of links

02:36:54.320 --> 02:36:55.320
and get this we talked about all these

02:36:56.320 --> 02:36:57.320
things on the show Tiger Claw you forgot

02:36:58.320 --> 02:36:59.320
pac-man on DVD we talked about that last

02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:01.320
week that's all right I sometimes forget

02:37:01.320 --> 02:37:03.320
that I will say this act-def sent me a

02:37:04.320 --> 02:37:06.320
tweet about another victim of Xbox Live

02:37:07.320 --> 02:37:08.320
hackings because you know this shit is

02:37:09.320 --> 02:37:10.320
still going on and yet still no word from

02:37:11.320 --> 02:37:12.320
Microsoft but I found this interesting he

02:37:13.320 --> 02:37:14.320
sent me a screen grab of a forum post I

02:37:15.320 --> 02:37:16.320
don't know what forum this is but he sent

02:37:17.320 --> 02:37:19.320
me this thing and what's interesting

02:37:20.320 --> 02:37:21.320
about this guy is he's saying that they

02:37:22.320 --> 02:37:23.320
bought four thousand points on his

02:37:24.320 --> 02:37:26.320
account but not with his credit card he

02:37:27.320 --> 02:37:28.320
never had linked his credit card to the

02:37:28.320 --> 02:37:30.320
accounts they bought four thousand point

02:37:31.320 --> 02:37:32.320
they they took his account linked it to

02:37:33.320 --> 02:37:34.320
another count and then bought four

02:37:35.320 --> 02:37:36.320
thousand points with somebody else's

02:37:37.320 --> 02:37:38.320
credit card which was probably stolen

02:37:39.320 --> 02:37:40.320
let's be real sad to know and I guess he

02:37:41.320 --> 02:37:42.320
called and got off the phone or whatever

02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:44.320
apparently the tech people thought they

02:37:45.320 --> 02:37:46.320
wanted to access an idle account so they

02:37:47.320 --> 02:37:48.320
could download whatever was on it already

02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:50.320
you know whatever had been licensed to it

02:37:51.320 --> 02:37:52.320
and that made me think about when my

02:37:53.320 --> 02:37:54.320
Xbox got hacked some time ago oh my god I

02:37:55.320 --> 02:37:56.320
used to buy like every Xbox Live arcade

02:37:56.320 --> 02:37:57.320
game that was released that person if

02:37:58.320 --> 02:37:59.320
they were if they knew to do it was

02:38:00.320 --> 02:38:01.320
probably able to get like 80 90 get I'm

02:38:02.320 --> 02:38:03.320
serious I had a problem I looked on a

02:38:04.320 --> 02:38:05.320
slide for a while since you mentioned it

02:38:06.320 --> 02:38:07.320
out of curiosity went to the hacked on

02:38:08.320 --> 02:38:11.320
xbox.com site again they have 49 unresolved

02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:13.320
case stories right now two that have

02:38:14.320 --> 02:38:16.320
moved from unresolved to resolved so wow

02:38:17.320 --> 02:38:19.320
you know and here's the thing is that I

02:38:20.320 --> 02:38:21.320
know 49 doesn't sound like a lot but

02:38:22.320 --> 02:38:24.320
that's 49 people who know about this

02:38:24.320 --> 02:38:27.320
website who are in the gaming you know

02:38:28.320 --> 02:38:29.320
there's tons of people getting hacked we

02:38:30.320 --> 02:38:31.320
don't even know about like one of my

02:38:32.320 --> 02:38:33.320
friends from high school was hacked and

02:38:34.320 --> 02:38:35.320
you know he wouldn't seek out a gaming

02:38:36.320 --> 02:38:37.320
community to post it he also hadn't

02:38:38.320 --> 02:38:39.320
played his Xbox in like six months at

02:38:40.320 --> 02:38:41.320
least all right I will Tiger Claw said

02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:43.320
oh but I want to get one story and so

02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:45.320
how about this one I said okay so he

02:38:46.320 --> 02:38:47.320
sent us this tweet and I guess I'll close

02:38:48.320 --> 02:38:49.320
with this because our skype line is

02:38:50.320 --> 02:38:51.320
either broken or I don't know but this

02:38:51.320 --> 02:38:53.320
topic from Edge magazine he tweeted us

02:38:54.320 --> 02:38:57.320
Awada throwing shade at Nikkei Japanese

02:38:58.320 --> 02:38:59.320
news outlet Nikkei which we brought up

02:39:00.320 --> 02:39:01.320
earlier in the show he's saying quote

02:39:02.320 --> 02:39:04.320
gossip magazine techniques apparently

02:39:05.320 --> 02:39:06.320
this is because Nikkei on the website

02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:08.320
ran a story which said Nintendo is trying

02:39:09.320 --> 02:39:12.320
to bring back titles like C-man oh so

02:39:13.320 --> 02:39:16.320
apparently it said that Awada had a quote

02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:18.320
that said unless Nintendo changed its

02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:20.320
ways as a matter of urgency it would

02:39:21.320 --> 02:39:23.320
collapse and Awada went to Twitter and

02:39:24.320 --> 02:39:25.320
said this is inaccurate this continues

02:39:26.320 --> 02:39:28.320
repeatedly and it's gossip magazine

02:39:29.320 --> 02:39:32.320
techniques interesting very similar to

02:39:33.320 --> 02:39:34.320
another thing I was reading on the

02:39:35.320 --> 02:39:36.320
internet you know penny arcade has their

02:39:37.320 --> 02:39:38.320
new little press site thing the PA report

02:39:39.320 --> 02:39:40.320
right which is it's it's a neat concept

02:39:41.320 --> 02:39:42.320
for a site because it really focuses on

02:39:43.320 --> 02:39:44.320
features and lets other people handle

02:39:45.320 --> 02:39:46.320
the news which I think is a smart way to

02:39:46.320 --> 02:39:48.320
do this because it's so hard right now to

02:39:49.320 --> 02:39:50.320
stay on top of the news and all that and

02:39:51.320 --> 02:39:53.320
there's this article on David Jaff where

02:39:54.320 --> 02:39:55.320
he got in a verbal confrontation one of

02:39:56.320 --> 02:39:57.320
the one of the guys from Kotaku what and

02:39:58.320 --> 02:39:59.320
the guy from PA report is there and has

02:40:00.320 --> 02:40:02.320
it on tape and it's what David Jaff

02:40:03.320 --> 02:40:04.320
getting in a confrontation with somebody

02:40:05.320 --> 02:40:07.320
and throwing throwing colorful languages

02:40:08.320 --> 02:40:10.320
in the mix I don't believe it that is

02:40:11.320 --> 02:40:14.320
gotta be fake he's not a like a complete

02:40:14.320 --> 02:40:17.320
douche or anything no he would never do

02:40:18.320 --> 02:40:21.320
that I'm serious him and fucking cliffy

02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:23.320
bean even get the fucking argument right

02:40:24.320 --> 02:40:27.320
there that I would pay to see douche off

02:40:28.320 --> 02:40:31.320
go all right well the skype line ain't

02:40:32.320 --> 02:40:33.320
working I guess I'm getting private

02:40:34.320 --> 02:40:35.320
messages from people saying they're

02:40:36.320 --> 02:40:37.320
trying to call and it's not working so I

02:40:38.320 --> 02:40:41.320
IDK what skype not working that's got to

02:40:41.320 --> 02:40:44.320
be a load of crap I know I know all right

02:40:45.320 --> 02:40:46.320
well well I got a private message from

02:40:47.320 --> 02:40:48.320
Jester Scott saying I can't get through

02:40:49.320 --> 02:40:50.320
I wanted to call and say thank you for

02:40:51.320 --> 02:40:52.320
the show and keep up the good work oh

02:40:53.320 --> 02:40:54.320
it's nice warm fuzzies warm fuzzies

02:40:55.320 --> 02:40:57.320
group hug red velvet cookies for all but

02:40:58.320 --> 02:40:59.320
I guess Skype fail and as other people

02:41:00.320 --> 02:41:01.320
in the chat room are saying Rama broke

02:41:02.320 --> 02:41:03.320
it all right I'll accept that reasoning

02:41:04.320 --> 02:41:07.320
Rama broke it thank you Rama Loki any

02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:09.320
last-minute stories you want to get out

02:41:09.320 --> 02:41:11.320
for we say goodnight tonight uh yeah I

02:41:12.320 --> 02:41:13.320
was reading on some stuff because I

02:41:14.320 --> 02:41:16.320
subscribe to the dash hack network thing

02:41:17.320 --> 02:41:18.320
talking about hacking stuff apparently

02:41:19.320 --> 02:41:20.320
you know these new system updates that

02:41:21.320 --> 02:41:22.320
they keep rolling out from Microsoft's

02:41:23.320 --> 02:41:25.320
Xbox and how they're you know fixing

02:41:26.320 --> 02:41:27.320
color correction problems of you know

02:41:28.320 --> 02:41:29.320
when they're patching something that has

02:41:30.320 --> 02:41:31.320
to do color correction that kind of stuff

02:41:32.320 --> 02:41:33.320
that's not exactly what they're doing

02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:35.320
there of course patching out the reset

02:41:36.320 --> 02:41:37.320
glitch hacks which basically allows you

02:41:37.320 --> 02:41:40.320
to j-tag any console out there however

02:41:41.320 --> 02:41:43.320
team executor one of the hack groups

02:41:44.320 --> 02:41:45.320
behind a lot of the tools are available

02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:47.320
out there they have a new device coming

02:41:48.320 --> 02:41:49.320
out called the executor demon which with

02:41:50.320 --> 02:41:51.320
a new technique that they figured out how

02:41:52.320 --> 02:41:54.320
to reset glitch hacks their consoles will

02:41:55.320 --> 02:41:56.320
be unstoppable it's basically there's no

02:41:57.320 --> 02:42:00.320
way to patch this out so that sounds like

02:42:01.320 --> 02:42:02.320
they're pulling a Sony unhackable no way

02:42:03.320 --> 02:42:05.320
to patch well apparently it I don't know

02:42:05.320 --> 02:42:07.320
what's involved with it but this new chip

02:42:08.320 --> 02:42:09.320
it will make it impossible for them to

02:42:10.320 --> 02:42:15.320
patch it out so neat all right if that's

02:42:16.320 --> 02:42:20.320
it for the last minute stories then I'm

02:42:21.320 --> 02:42:22.320
gonna go around and get everybody's final

02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:24.320
thought dark soccer will start with you

02:42:25.320 --> 02:42:27.320
ladies first um I shouldn't have eaten so

02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:29.320
early because I'm freaking hungry and

02:42:30.320 --> 02:42:33.320
like with my stressful ass day I ate no

02:42:33.320 --> 02:42:35.320
lunch really you want another one of those

02:42:36.320 --> 02:42:37.320
gingerbread pita chips because they're

02:42:38.320 --> 02:42:39.320
really good no it actually had a little

02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:42.320
bit too much bite for me all right Loki

02:42:43.320 --> 02:42:45.320
your final thought my final thought is I

02:42:46.320 --> 02:42:48.320
really hope that this game of luminous I'm

02:42:49.320 --> 02:42:50.320
playing actually records because the last

02:42:51.320 --> 02:42:52.320
four of them that I've done and yes I did

02:42:53.320 --> 02:42:55.320
eventually hit quit so that this you know

02:42:56.320 --> 02:42:57.320
it would record my score or something like

02:42:58.320 --> 02:43:00.320
that have not recorded and reset each

02:43:00.320 --> 02:43:03.320
time so it's kind of annoying my final

02:43:04.320 --> 02:43:05.320
thought for tonight is you know we've

02:43:06.320 --> 02:43:07.320
been doing this thing where we talk about

02:43:08.320 --> 02:43:09.320
video games in the same room without

02:43:10.320 --> 02:43:11.320
Skype because you know Skype clearly

02:43:12.320 --> 02:43:13.320
doesn't even want to work half the time

02:43:14.320 --> 02:43:15.320
as you can see tonight we've been doing

02:43:16.320 --> 02:43:17.320
it this way for going on 10 years this

02:43:18.320 --> 02:43:20.320
June and you know not once have we ever

02:43:21.320 --> 02:43:22.320

02:43:23.320 --> 02:43:25.320
going and we plan to keep it that way

02:43:26.320 --> 02:43:28.320
you guys being here in chat is enough

02:43:28.320 --> 02:43:29.320

02:43:30.320 --> 02:43:31.320
