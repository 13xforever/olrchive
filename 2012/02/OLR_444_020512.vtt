00:00.000 --> 00:16.880
Tonight, February 5th, 2012.

00:16.880 --> 00:20.560
Could mature video games soon carry an extra sales tax?

00:20.560 --> 00:29.920
Game Gear games are spotted for the 3DS, and a creation kit is set to come for Skyrim.

00:29.920 --> 00:36.360
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:36.360 --> 00:40.880
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:40.880 --> 00:48.760
It is episode number 444, that's three fours, not four fours, for this February 5th of 2012.

00:48.760 --> 00:53.580
We are live as we are every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, where we

00:53.580 --> 00:59.100
tape live 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, although

00:59.100 --> 01:03.520
not tonight, Bobby had the night off, something about a superb owl, he was a superb owl or

01:03.520 --> 01:04.520
something he was doing.

01:04.520 --> 01:07.240
I thought he had to do a stupor or something.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.240
Something like that.

01:08.240 --> 01:11.080
So anyway, my name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with

01:11.080 --> 01:12.080
my co-host.

01:12.080 --> 01:15.540
First off, you already heard her, but it's Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

01:15.540 --> 01:18.280
Maybe it was Super Bowels.

01:18.280 --> 01:19.280
Maybe that was it.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.640
It might have been, I don't know, something like that.

01:21.640 --> 01:24.520
Also say hello, of course, to the one and only Tech Master, Loki.

01:24.520 --> 01:25.520
Hi.

01:25.520 --> 01:26.520
How are you, Loki?

01:26.520 --> 01:27.520
I'm fine.

01:27.520 --> 01:30.480
It's a name that a lot of the live listeners like to play on the show, and that is, you

01:30.480 --> 01:32.400
know, where did Loki get his food tonight?

01:32.400 --> 01:36.200
Because you like to go to like fast food restaurants, or you go to, you know, whatever restaurant

01:36.200 --> 01:38.640
you take out and you bring it to the show to munch on air, because, you know, we do

01:38.640 --> 01:39.760
the show at dinner time.

01:39.760 --> 01:40.760
Yeah.

01:40.760 --> 01:42.880
So if we don't eat before or after, we're kind of screwed.

01:42.880 --> 01:45.320
So, but you went to two restaurants tonight, right?

01:45.320 --> 01:49.680
Yeah, well, the KFC got some honey barbecue wings, and then I went to McDonald's and got

01:49.680 --> 01:51.760
some fries.

01:51.760 --> 01:54.840
So you had wings and fries for this superb owl day?

01:54.840 --> 01:55.840
Yeah.

01:55.840 --> 01:56.840
I see.

01:56.840 --> 01:57.840
It's not appropriate.

01:57.840 --> 02:03.360
Well, I wanted to go to someplace else, other than fast food, but the teriyaki place nearby

02:03.360 --> 02:11.600
closed, and the fish and chips place nearby, they're closed today, and it's just like all

02:11.600 --> 02:13.120
the other places are closed.

02:13.120 --> 02:15.360
I got to go into Quiznos, I guess, but meh.

02:15.360 --> 02:16.360
Yeah, a lot of places.

02:16.360 --> 02:20.160
Well, we actually, Alan and I went and got sushi real quick before the show, and they

02:20.160 --> 02:22.840
were open, but not very busy at all.

02:22.840 --> 02:24.040
There's like one table in there.

02:24.040 --> 02:25.040
Go figure.

02:25.040 --> 02:26.040
I can't imagine why.

02:26.040 --> 02:32.320
I considered stopping by Little Caesars for some really cheap ass pizza, but I figured

02:32.320 --> 02:33.880
that they'd be really busy.

02:33.880 --> 02:35.720
No, not now.

02:35.720 --> 02:38.760
All those pizzas would have been done before the big game started.

02:38.760 --> 02:41.560
I am, of course, talking about the Puppy Bowl.

02:41.560 --> 02:42.560
I got food too.

02:42.560 --> 02:44.440
Where'd you get food from tonight?

02:44.440 --> 02:46.360
Whole Foods.

02:46.360 --> 02:48.840
How healthy, you damn dirty hippie.

02:48.840 --> 02:49.840
Yes.

02:49.840 --> 02:51.720
Hey, it was delicious, and it had grapes in it.

02:51.720 --> 02:54.320
All right, so obviously, Pink Elephant in the room.

02:54.320 --> 02:59.120
We are live on a night where usually there's not a lot of stuff going on anywhere, not

02:59.120 --> 03:03.520
on TV, not anywhere, unless you're the network that's carrying the Super Bowl, because we

03:03.520 --> 03:04.520
are up against...

03:04.520 --> 03:08.800
I was going to say, I did hear something big happen today, and that was Madonna said, fuck

03:08.800 --> 03:09.800
you to everybody.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.360
Yeah, well, that was MIA, I guess.

03:11.360 --> 03:12.360
Oh, MIA?

03:12.360 --> 03:14.440
Yeah, because she had her own little entourage with her.

03:14.440 --> 03:18.920
Now, Madonna, you know, sashayed and lip synced for her life in front of all those people

03:18.920 --> 03:19.920
and stuff.

03:19.920 --> 03:20.920
It was interesting.

03:20.920 --> 03:24.480
Of course, I know people that pick their nose and eat it, and that's kind of interesting

03:24.480 --> 03:25.480
too.

03:25.480 --> 03:29.680
Anyway, let's introduce our chat room at chat.orangeloungelaunch...

03:29.680 --> 03:30.680
What?

03:30.680 --> 03:32.560
Can we take like five seconds to judge Madonna?

03:32.560 --> 03:33.560
Sure.

03:33.560 --> 03:34.560
Go ahead.

03:34.560 --> 03:37.400
Okay, I'm done.

03:37.400 --> 03:43.020
Chat.orangelaunchradio.com if you want to join us live in our chat room and talk along

03:43.020 --> 03:45.600
with the program and all that good stuff.

03:45.600 --> 03:50.840
So I got to say, look, I don't want to keep ragging on Madonna, because I do love Madonna.

03:50.840 --> 03:51.840
Like no, seriously.

03:51.840 --> 03:52.840
I'm gay.

03:52.840 --> 03:53.840
I have to love Madonna.

03:53.840 --> 03:55.360
Like it's like a it's like a requirement.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.520
She was pre gaga.

03:56.520 --> 03:57.520
She's been slipping.

03:57.520 --> 04:00.180
Like I don't I don't even want to make a Madonna gaga thing.

04:00.180 --> 04:01.280
Like that's not a thing.

04:01.280 --> 04:02.280
People need to stop making that a thing.

04:02.280 --> 04:03.280
It's not a thing.

04:03.280 --> 04:04.280
It's not a thing.

04:04.280 --> 04:05.280
What?

04:05.280 --> 04:06.520
It's an evolution of styles.

04:06.520 --> 04:07.720
What's an evolution of music?

04:07.720 --> 04:08.720
Sure.

04:08.720 --> 04:10.920
It was clearly an influence.

04:10.920 --> 04:12.400
Here's the thing about Madonna.

04:12.400 --> 04:13.400
She's kind of slipping.

04:13.400 --> 04:14.400
And I don't know.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.400
I don't know what it is.

04:15.400 --> 04:16.400
But like that new song.

04:16.400 --> 04:17.400
Not good.

04:17.400 --> 04:18.560
Like it's just not good.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.400
But anyway, huh?

04:21.400 --> 04:24.200
Was there ever a Madonna video game trying to get back on topic?

04:24.200 --> 04:26.640
I don't think there was.

04:26.640 --> 04:28.720
Wasn't Ray of Light in something?

04:28.720 --> 04:30.280
It might have been like in a dance game.

04:30.280 --> 04:31.280
I don't know.

04:31.280 --> 04:32.280
All right.

04:32.280 --> 04:36.400
Look, we do, of course, always invite our live chatters at chat.orangelaungerator.com.

04:36.400 --> 04:40.960
However, we do ask the live chatters, don't talk about the Super Bowl in the chat room.

04:40.960 --> 04:44.380
It's not that we want to like censor you or you know, but it's just as I'm trying to look

04:44.380 --> 04:47.400
through chat room and read comments that are relevant to the show, I don't need to see

04:47.400 --> 04:51.400
a bunch of like woo giants, woo patriots, blah, blah, blah, you know, whatever going

04:51.400 --> 04:52.400
on in there.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.720
So try to keep the Super Bowl chat out.

04:54.720 --> 04:56.880
However, Puppy Bowl chat is just fine.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.560
If you want to talk about the Puppy Bowl, we'll deal with that.

04:58.560 --> 05:02.920
What about that cute little lab that was drinking from the bowl when we were watching?

05:02.920 --> 05:05.760
Well, this year's Puppy Bowl was all about fumble.

05:05.760 --> 05:07.920
It seemed like the whole time was fumble.

05:07.920 --> 05:10.160
But I was a big fan of Oscar the dash on.

05:10.160 --> 05:12.520
Happy birthday, Tiger Claw.

05:12.520 --> 05:13.520
That's right.

05:13.520 --> 05:14.540
It is Tiger Claw's birthday.

05:14.540 --> 05:17.640
We should take a minute to acknowledge Tiger Claw because he does a lot.

05:17.640 --> 05:23.200
You know, the network that we're on, all games dot com like I don't want to like I don't

05:23.200 --> 05:27.740
want to say the wrong thing here, but there's there's really nobody running all games radio

05:27.740 --> 05:28.740
right now.

05:28.740 --> 05:33.460
Like it's kind of like this hive mind, I think that's kind of running the station.

05:33.460 --> 05:37.780
That's not a knock on Scott, who started a long time ago, but his station will be assimilated.

05:37.780 --> 05:41.440
He's got other projects and things and he's not really running things.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.840
He doesn't have a daily show on the network anymore.

05:43.840 --> 05:47.440
So there's really nobody in charge at all games radio.

05:47.440 --> 05:49.860
We're just kind of, you know, trucking along, doing our thing.

05:49.860 --> 05:55.160
But Tiger Claw, he has done a damn good job, just kind of like kind of keeping things orderly.

05:55.160 --> 05:59.640
Like I don't want to call him the secretary of all games radio, but he's he's definitely

05:59.640 --> 06:04.280
he's the P.A. The personal assistant to director.

06:04.280 --> 06:07.280
OK, he's the one that actually gets the stuff done.

06:07.280 --> 06:09.760
Yes, that's a very good way of putting it.

06:09.760 --> 06:10.860
That's a great way of putting it.

06:10.860 --> 06:14.980
He's the director's assistant or the one that's actually doing all the work because he's,

06:14.980 --> 06:17.780
you know, making sure that all the live shows are up.

06:17.780 --> 06:23.060
Like we have been on all games radio so, so, so long that we can do our own live show.

06:23.060 --> 06:25.420
We technically don't need Tiger Claw's help.

06:25.420 --> 06:27.460
We like having him here, of course.

06:27.460 --> 06:31.500
But I know a lot of the other shows on the network, like Tiger Claw helps them get on,

06:31.500 --> 06:34.300
actually set up their show, go live and all that good stuff.

06:34.300 --> 06:37.820
So he does a lot of stuff that you guys probably don't see.

06:37.820 --> 06:39.060
Why?

06:39.060 --> 06:40.380
Because he loves the network.

06:40.380 --> 06:43.180
So or or he's getting money that we don't know about.

06:43.180 --> 06:44.180
I don't know.

06:44.180 --> 06:45.180
I think it's the first one.

06:45.180 --> 06:50.580
So absolutely a special happy birthday to Tiger Claw, because without Tiger Claw, I

06:50.580 --> 06:55.380
don't know if there'd be a network still going right now, because if the power went down,

06:55.380 --> 06:59.340
it probably people would notice till the next live broadcasters like, where's my show?

06:59.340 --> 07:04.060
Do you know that that our buddy Brad from Pod Culture just got the first gong of the

07:04.060 --> 07:05.060
year?

07:05.060 --> 07:06.060
Oh, what did Brad do?

07:06.060 --> 07:11.180
He said he heard the puppy bowl just went to the dogs.

07:11.180 --> 07:12.180
Nice.

07:12.180 --> 07:13.180
Nice.

07:13.180 --> 07:15.900
I went old school and went with the gong instead of the sad trombone.

07:15.900 --> 07:17.500
All right.

07:17.500 --> 07:18.500
Okay.

07:18.500 --> 07:22.860
So I want to start since we are, you know, in a we can't ignore the big sports thing

07:22.860 --> 07:23.860
that's going on.

07:23.860 --> 07:28.420
I realize most people this week are probably downloading this via the podcast because I

07:28.420 --> 07:31.780
guess it's I guess it's just an American tradition or something.

07:31.780 --> 07:34.940
Did you know that Paula Deen was in Sacramento like this week?

07:34.940 --> 07:35.940
No, really?

07:35.940 --> 07:36.940
Yeah.

07:36.940 --> 07:38.180
She gave away a lot of ham.

07:38.180 --> 07:39.440
I'm serious.

07:39.440 --> 07:40.440
You're not making this up.

07:40.440 --> 07:41.440
I'm not making this up.

07:41.440 --> 07:42.440
Why were you there?

07:42.440 --> 07:43.440
I wasn't there.

07:43.440 --> 07:47.660
Um, but my Nellie's friend Colt, you remember Colt?

07:47.660 --> 07:48.660
I do.

07:48.660 --> 07:49.660
Yeah.

07:49.660 --> 07:50.660
He's got some tie.

07:50.660 --> 07:53.520
Well, he works, I think he works at Whole Foods now, but he has some ties to some sort

07:53.520 --> 07:58.500
of charity or something nearby that got Paula Deen to come out here, do a live show and

07:58.500 --> 07:59.860
give away a bunch of ham.

07:59.860 --> 08:00.860
From what I remember.

08:00.860 --> 08:03.340
Her personal ham stash.

08:03.340 --> 08:05.660
From what I remember of him, him being a big fan of Paula Deen.

08:05.660 --> 08:06.660
Is it coated in butter?

08:06.660 --> 08:09.940
Didn't he have like a little southern twang, if I remember right?

08:09.940 --> 08:13.780
He was a big fan of, uh, not Paula Deen.

08:13.780 --> 08:16.900
It was, um, Rachel Ray.

08:16.900 --> 08:19.520
No, it's a country music star.

08:19.520 --> 08:23.940
It's some country female, no, female country music star.

08:23.940 --> 08:24.940
Trisha Yearwood?

08:24.940 --> 08:25.940
No.

08:25.940 --> 08:27.020
I'm trying to think of like the five.

08:27.020 --> 08:29.460
Shania Twain.

08:29.460 --> 08:30.460
Might be Shania Twain.

08:30.460 --> 08:31.460
Okay.

08:31.460 --> 08:32.460
She's Canadian.

08:32.460 --> 08:33.620
Even though she hasn't been around in about 15 years.

08:33.620 --> 08:35.520
No, maybe that's not it.

08:35.520 --> 08:37.500
It's ah, I don't remember.

08:37.500 --> 08:38.500
Oh, whatever.

08:38.500 --> 08:39.500
That doesn't matter.

08:39.500 --> 08:40.500
It's not important.

08:40.500 --> 08:42.700
The important thing is that she looks like she's made of plastic.

08:42.700 --> 08:43.700
Yes.

08:43.700 --> 08:47.340
By the way, I have to tell you the sad thing that happened yesterday.

08:47.340 --> 08:48.340
What?

08:48.340 --> 08:51.980
Becky and I were at the Crocker Art Museum for Free Museum Day and we were standing next

08:51.980 --> 08:56.660
to this younger couple just looking at a picture and the guy's like, wow, this looks like a

08:56.660 --> 08:57.820
Rush album.

08:57.820 --> 09:00.060
And she's like, what's Rush?

09:00.060 --> 09:09.740
Becky and I turned around and in unison with her boyfriend said, what's Rush?

09:09.740 --> 09:14.020
She looked like she wanted to crawl into a corner and die.

09:14.020 --> 09:18.140
At least that didn't happen on 2-1-12 because that would have been a disaster.

09:18.140 --> 09:19.140
Anyway.

09:19.140 --> 09:20.140
All right.

09:20.140 --> 09:21.860
Can we actually talk about video games?

09:21.860 --> 09:22.860
Sure.

09:22.860 --> 09:23.860
Possibly.

09:23.860 --> 09:24.860
I thought that that was worth sharing.

09:24.860 --> 09:25.860
All right.

09:25.860 --> 09:26.860
No, it's fine.

09:26.860 --> 09:27.860
It's fine.

09:27.860 --> 09:28.860
Can we talk about video games?

09:28.860 --> 09:29.860
I played some.

09:29.860 --> 09:30.860
It happens occasionally on this show.

09:30.860 --> 09:31.860
All right.

09:31.860 --> 09:37.780
Look, the kickoff topic, her, her, I wanted to do tonight was OK, because a lot of folks

09:37.780 --> 09:42.100
tend to kind of notice that we don't talk a lot about sports games because we don't

09:42.100 --> 09:46.540
really play a lot of sports games these days because I don't know why don't we play sports

09:46.540 --> 09:47.540
games?

09:47.540 --> 09:48.540
Why don't you play Madden?

09:48.540 --> 09:49.540
Because they're ass.

09:49.540 --> 09:51.660
But that's that's not a good enough reason.

09:51.660 --> 09:52.660
I'm sorry.

09:52.660 --> 09:53.900
Like because I hate football.

09:53.900 --> 09:59.180
Well, I don't personally I don't hate football like hates a strong word, but I don't know.

09:59.180 --> 10:03.540
Like I think I'm just willing to admit I'm not very good at sports games because I'm

10:03.540 --> 10:06.340
not very knowledgeable about a lot of the sports.

10:06.340 --> 10:09.980
And for me, a lot of these games like Madden and stuff get really like detailed and stuff.

10:09.980 --> 10:13.300
And when I look at all these like, you know, maps of the X's nose and things like that.

10:13.300 --> 10:16.500
And I'm sure like like a lot of football fans, I'm just like the biggest idiot in the world

10:16.500 --> 10:17.500
right now.

10:17.500 --> 10:20.140
But like you have to realize there's some people that don't really watch sports, you

10:20.140 --> 10:21.140
guys.

10:21.140 --> 10:23.980
So I I can't really follow a lot of those new sports games.

10:23.980 --> 10:28.020
But I thought that doesn't mean I hate all sports games, because that's certainly not

10:28.020 --> 10:29.020
true.

10:29.020 --> 10:31.100
There are some sports games out there I actually really enjoy.

10:31.100 --> 10:35.060
So I thought we could talk a little bit about sports games that don't suck.

10:35.060 --> 10:38.780
So dark soccer, do you do you I know you say hate football, but are there any sports games

10:38.780 --> 10:41.220
you can think of that you really enjoy?

10:41.220 --> 10:45.420
I like like the only football game I've ever really enjoyed was super high impact on Super

10:45.420 --> 10:46.640
Nintendo.

10:46.640 --> 10:49.300
My brothers and I would play the crap out of that.

10:49.300 --> 10:52.300
And NBA Jam.

10:52.300 --> 10:56.500
And NBA Jam.

10:56.500 --> 11:03.660
And that skiing game on the PC that I used to scream at that was on the old no on the

11:03.660 --> 11:04.660
PC.

11:04.660 --> 11:05.660
Yeah.

11:05.660 --> 11:06.660
Whiskey.

11:06.660 --> 11:08.660
Loki, you need to talk into a mic.

11:08.660 --> 11:09.660
Yeah.

11:09.660 --> 11:10.660
Ski free.

11:10.660 --> 11:11.660
Ski free.

11:11.660 --> 11:12.660
That game would piss me off.

11:12.660 --> 11:17.580
Oh, actually, I remember one that I really, really liked Alpine Racer.

11:17.580 --> 11:20.380
I freaking loved Alpine Racer.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.300
And we had one at my arcade.

11:22.300 --> 11:25.220
I played the shit out of that I was super good at it.

11:25.220 --> 11:32.360
And I liked it's not really, you know, sports, but I'll count it as prop cycle.

11:32.360 --> 11:33.540
That's stretching it.

11:33.540 --> 11:36.860
That's like saying DDR and taking the easy way out of this question.

11:36.860 --> 11:39.740
I didn't say DDR.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.740
Some sports games that I've enjoyed in the past.

11:41.740 --> 11:46.100
I used to play a game on the NES back in the day that I loved.

11:46.100 --> 11:48.860
And I think it was like baseball.

11:48.860 --> 11:50.140
Baseball stars.

11:50.140 --> 11:51.140
Was that it?

11:51.140 --> 11:52.140
You could like manage.

11:52.140 --> 11:53.140
I have that game.

11:53.140 --> 11:54.140
Yes.

11:54.140 --> 11:55.140
That game.

11:55.140 --> 11:56.140
That game.

11:56.140 --> 11:57.780
But they had an NES version of it, right?

11:57.780 --> 11:58.780
I think they did.

11:58.780 --> 11:59.780
Maybe it was RBI Baseball or something.

11:59.780 --> 12:00.780
No, it wasn't RBI Baseball.

12:00.780 --> 12:01.780
It wasn't any other baseball game.

12:01.780 --> 12:04.980
No, I think that Baseball Stars was the...

12:04.980 --> 12:06.260
I think they did a Neo Geo.

12:06.260 --> 12:07.260
That wasn't Neo Geo.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.580
The version of the Neo Geo won.

12:08.580 --> 12:11.040
I think they did one on the NES.

12:11.040 --> 12:15.000
And then like, you know, because the folks that...

12:15.000 --> 12:18.660
They made some games on Nintendo before they spun off to their own thing.

12:18.660 --> 12:21.080
So anyway.

12:21.080 --> 12:22.080
Other stuff I enjoyed.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.060
Blades of Steel will always be one of my favorites.

12:24.060 --> 12:26.460
I had Ice Hockey and Blades of Steel on the NES.

12:26.460 --> 12:28.820
Those are both great games.

12:28.820 --> 12:30.860
I really like a lot of racing games.

12:30.860 --> 12:32.580
If you want to try and get a little more modern.

12:32.580 --> 12:33.580
I do like a lot of...

12:33.580 --> 12:34.580
I like the...

12:34.580 --> 12:39.380
Although, I don't know if it's really sports borderline, but I like the Wangan Midnight

12:39.380 --> 12:40.380
Maximum Tune games.

12:40.380 --> 12:42.420
That's not a sport.

12:42.420 --> 12:44.180
Racing is not a sport?

12:44.180 --> 12:45.180
Drifting is not a sport.

12:45.180 --> 12:46.180
Okay.

12:46.180 --> 12:49.060
I mean drifting, they have competitions, but it's not like a sport.

12:49.060 --> 12:52.000
I've played the NASCAR games and I've enjoyed them.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Like in the arcade.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.020
You know, like the big old simulations that you get in there and get into.

12:56.020 --> 12:57.220
I like those.

12:57.220 --> 12:58.220
So those are pretty cool.

12:58.220 --> 13:00.580
I'm trying to think if there's a...

13:00.580 --> 13:01.580
Oh!

13:01.580 --> 13:02.580
You know what?

13:02.580 --> 13:06.740
I really enjoyed, at least in the past, I haven't played a lot of them recently, but

13:06.740 --> 13:11.220
I remember when I was growing up, I used to love on the Commodore 64, because y'all know

13:11.220 --> 13:12.860
I loved my Commodore 64 growing up.

13:12.860 --> 13:17.060
I used to play the shit out of Winter Games and Summer Games 2, which were kind of like

13:17.060 --> 13:18.060
the Olympic...

13:18.060 --> 13:20.060
I mean, there was a Summer Games 1, but we didn't own it.

13:20.060 --> 13:21.420
So I had those other ones.

13:21.420 --> 13:24.940
Those were kind of like their Olympic games where you could do like cycling and, you know,

13:24.940 --> 13:30.500
if it was Winter Games, you could do, I don't know, like, I think figure skating and speed

13:30.500 --> 13:32.100
skating and some of the other stuff they have.

13:32.100 --> 13:33.100
So I like the Olympics.

13:33.100 --> 13:36.740
Like, I really do like that as far as sports go anyway.

13:36.740 --> 13:38.500
So I like usually a lot of the Olympic games.

13:38.500 --> 13:44.320
I even played the demo for that Mario and Sonic 2012 Olympic game that's coming out

13:44.320 --> 13:46.920
later this year because they have the 3DS demo out right now.

13:46.920 --> 13:51.340
I like the trampoline one because that was the only one where you really notice the 3D.

13:51.340 --> 13:53.740
But the cycling one drove me bonkers.

13:53.740 --> 13:57.900
So and some of the ones, Dark Soccer said, I used to play NBA Jam in the arcade all the

13:57.900 --> 13:58.900
time.

13:58.900 --> 13:59.900
I really try.

13:59.900 --> 14:03.380
I really tried to like this new NBA Jam that just came out, but I didn't really care for

14:03.380 --> 14:04.860
it.

14:04.860 --> 14:09.180
The new one that was on, yeah, I downloaded the demo on Fire Edition or whatever.

14:09.180 --> 14:10.180
Didn't care for it.

14:10.180 --> 14:11.180
It wasn't that good.

14:11.180 --> 14:12.180
That sad face.

14:12.180 --> 14:13.180
Yeah, I tried.

14:13.180 --> 14:16.740
You know, um, what was the game?

14:16.740 --> 14:17.740
California games?

14:17.740 --> 14:18.740
Oh, yeah.

14:18.740 --> 14:19.740
California.

14:19.740 --> 14:20.740
Links.

14:20.740 --> 14:21.740
Yeah.

14:21.740 --> 14:24.940
It was, uh, that was originally, um, that was, I would say it was an Amiga game.

14:24.940 --> 14:28.860
I wasn't great at it, but it was okay, but it had the unreal 360.

14:28.860 --> 14:34.660
Well, they tried to keep, actually, that's like a spinoff of the summer games and, uh,

14:34.660 --> 14:38.820
winter games because they, you know, they kind of ran out of stuff to do Olympic related

14:38.820 --> 14:43.700
720 and well, that was a different series, but yeah, seven to 720 was awesome.

14:43.700 --> 14:46.260
Anyhow, Loki, what about you?

14:46.260 --> 14:54.740
Um, I used to play some of the NFL Blitz arcade game back in, I don't know, when I worked

14:54.740 --> 14:55.740
at Roundtable.

14:55.740 --> 14:57.740
That was kind of fun.

14:57.740 --> 15:02.740
Um, and then co-op.

15:02.740 --> 15:03.740
It's running.

15:03.740 --> 15:07.740
Um, I don't know, I don't play a lot of sports games.

15:07.740 --> 15:08.740
Okay.

15:08.740 --> 15:12.140
I thought of a racing game that ought to count because everybody fucking loved this game

15:12.140 --> 15:13.700
when they were a kid.

15:13.700 --> 15:19.140
I mean, Ironman, Ivan Stewart, super off-road racing, every pizza parlor has that, right?

15:19.140 --> 15:20.140
I never played it.

15:20.140 --> 15:21.380
I actually never played that one.

15:21.380 --> 15:22.380
Oh my God.

15:22.380 --> 15:27.740
That had an awesome any, I remember when the NES version of that came out or was it, no,

15:27.740 --> 15:32.700
it was regular NES because it was one of the few games that supported the, um, uh, the

15:32.700 --> 15:34.540
ultra tap or whatever it was called.

15:34.540 --> 15:35.540
The multi tap.

15:35.540 --> 15:36.540
Yeah.

15:36.540 --> 15:39.980
Because I mean, if I was going to count a racing game as, you know, included, then I

15:39.980 --> 15:47.580
would totally, totally just put in the original Ridge Racer because that was a money sucker

15:47.580 --> 15:48.700
for me.

15:48.700 --> 15:51.420
If I hadn't worked at the damn arcade, I would have been broke.

15:51.420 --> 15:52.420
All right.

15:52.420 --> 15:54.500
Go into our chat room for some comments at chat.

15:54.500 --> 15:55.940
If I got everything for Loki, sorry.

15:55.940 --> 15:57.940
Just want to make sure.

15:57.940 --> 15:58.940
Um, sure.

15:58.940 --> 16:04.500
I mean, that's chat that orange lounge, radio.com, uh, Kaijuto says baseball all stars was awesome

16:04.500 --> 16:06.100
and I had it on Nintendo.

16:06.100 --> 16:11.540
Um, RDG singe says, OMG, no one mentioned track and field.

16:11.540 --> 16:12.540
That one was okay.

16:12.540 --> 16:16.180
You know, they had an Xbox live port of that, um, way back in the beginning when it was

16:16.180 --> 16:20.580
a bunch of old eighties, Konami games are being ported over, but it's really, I mean,

16:20.580 --> 16:23.100
it's good, but it's really just button mashing.

16:23.100 --> 16:27.740
I did play track and field, not even like three months ago though, the last time I was

16:27.740 --> 16:31.720
at electronica at Disneyland because they have the whole Flynn's arcade and they had

16:31.720 --> 16:32.720
a track and field machine.

16:32.720 --> 16:37.980
I played it on my, uh, arcade cabinet not too long ago, a few months ago, but it's really

16:37.980 --> 16:43.620
just like, you know, but I guess then again, the Commodore 64 games were no better.

16:43.620 --> 16:46.620
So what am I, who am I to judge?

16:46.620 --> 16:52.220
So, all right, anyhow, uh, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks.

16:52.220 --> 16:55.120
We usually like to start off the show, talk about the video games that we've been playing

16:55.120 --> 16:56.120
this week.

16:56.120 --> 16:57.120
Dark Sakura.

16:57.120 --> 16:58.120
How was your gaming week?

16:58.120 --> 16:59.120
I played.

16:59.120 --> 17:00.120
Wow.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.120
And something epic happened.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.120
Okay.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.980
I'm going to tell it to you earlier, but I'm going to tell it to me.

17:03.980 --> 17:13.580
So this guy named Lich Rage on Blade's Edge Alliance, Human DK, um, I was wondering around,

17:13.580 --> 17:18.820
uh, trying to finish the love is in the air crap, you know, for, they do for Valentine's

17:18.820 --> 17:19.820
suck.

17:19.820 --> 17:24.180
And, um, there's this thing that you have to throw rose petals on certain, uh, race

17:24.180 --> 17:25.180
and class combinations.

17:25.180 --> 17:27.580
And one of them is a human death knight.

17:27.580 --> 17:31.060
So I just went in trade chat and said, is there a human death knight around?

17:31.060 --> 17:34.140
And there's one said, yeah, 10 gold.

17:34.140 --> 17:41.660
So I invited him into my party and targeted him and then left the party and he said, you

17:41.660 --> 17:42.660
lied.

17:42.660 --> 17:46.900
I'm like, you shouldn't have been charging for something that's a free service.

17:46.900 --> 17:53.040
And he's like, I've only got 20 gold and I'm like, so go out and earn it like the rest

17:53.040 --> 17:54.040
of us.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.620
Mining and herbalism are your friends.

17:56.620 --> 17:57.620
And he said, suck it.

17:57.620 --> 18:02.820
You planning the herbal is, uh, she's like, suck it.

18:02.820 --> 18:06.780
And I was like, ignore, she just put deal with it.

18:06.780 --> 18:07.780
Happy face.

18:07.780 --> 18:12.120
Well, I was, I, I wasn't rude to him.

18:12.120 --> 18:18.580
You know, I was like, you know, I, when I started off, you swindled them, I didn't swindle

18:18.580 --> 18:19.580
them.

18:19.580 --> 18:20.580
Maybe a little bit, a little bit.

18:20.580 --> 18:21.580
You swindled him.

18:21.580 --> 18:23.260
He thought I swindled him.

18:23.260 --> 18:27.020
If you could, you would have had your character show her boobies a little bit, you know, cause

18:27.020 --> 18:32.660
my intention was the moment someone said, DK here, I was just going to find their name,

18:32.660 --> 18:35.740
target them and throw the rose petals anyway.

18:35.740 --> 18:36.740
That was the plan.

18:36.740 --> 18:39.340
And he's like, 10 gold.

18:39.340 --> 18:40.340
That's stupid.

18:40.340 --> 18:41.580
You don't, don't do that crap.

18:41.580 --> 18:43.740
You know, go out and earn your own damn money.

18:43.740 --> 18:48.780
No, I can't help it if you keep buying every pet that pops up in the auction house.

18:48.780 --> 18:51.460
So um, addicting.

18:51.460 --> 18:52.460
It kind of is.

18:52.460 --> 18:53.540
I've actually spent lots of money on pets.

18:53.540 --> 18:58.340
They should really have like a series of hoarders, you know, where it's people collecting wild

18:58.340 --> 18:59.340
pets.

18:59.340 --> 19:00.340
Like MMO hoarders.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.340
Yeah.

19:01.340 --> 19:02.340
MMO hoarders.

19:02.340 --> 19:03.340
I'm sure that exists somewhere.

19:03.340 --> 19:06.620
But, um, well actually though, um, one of my really good friends who was my roommate

19:06.620 --> 19:12.540
in college, uh, joined our server and gave me a pandaren monk.

19:12.540 --> 19:13.540
What a nice gift.

19:13.540 --> 19:16.860
It was very nice of her cause she had the magazine and it gave her an extra pandaren

19:16.860 --> 19:17.860
monk.

19:17.860 --> 19:20.060
When the magazine went away, they gave away all these pets in the game.

19:20.060 --> 19:21.620
It's like an I'm sorry type of thing.

19:21.620 --> 19:22.620
Yeah.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.980
So she gave it to me cause I think she already had it.

19:24.980 --> 19:30.060
Um, and then I'm also playing a bust move on my phone.

19:30.060 --> 19:31.060
It's still super fun.

19:31.060 --> 19:32.340
I really enjoy it.

19:32.340 --> 19:35.940
And also I have to make an observation before we move on to Loki.

19:35.940 --> 19:41.300
Um, on the can of Arizona diet green tea is a prostitute.

19:41.300 --> 19:43.300
Seriously.

19:43.300 --> 19:44.740
Taiyu.

19:44.740 --> 19:49.940
You can tell because her OB is tied in the front and her hair is over elaborate.

19:49.940 --> 19:51.500
That's what I get for studying weight.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.580
No, whoever designed that had no idea.

19:53.580 --> 19:58.520
They were just like, we just need to look like a geisha Asian looking on this green

19:58.520 --> 20:07.380
tea, but they've put a whore granted a very high class, talented, artistic whore.

20:07.380 --> 20:13.740
This writing here probably says I am horse, but, but I mean, I just had to point it out.

20:13.740 --> 20:18.020
It just, I looked at the can and it dawned on me that it's a prostitute.

20:18.020 --> 20:22.980
Isn't there some website of like bad Chinese text tattoos where you see people that got

20:22.980 --> 20:26.140
tattoos of Chinese writing and it says like really horrible things.

20:26.140 --> 20:29.900
Of course, I don't know how much of that's legit and how much of it's fake, but yeah.

20:29.900 --> 20:31.020
All right.

20:31.020 --> 20:33.860
If that's it for dark soccer's gaming week, Loki, how was your gaming week?

20:33.860 --> 20:37.500
Um, I played Skyrim only a little bit though.

20:37.500 --> 20:38.500
Actually.

20:38.500 --> 20:43.820
Um, I mainly this week was working on Grand Theft Auto modding and thank God finished

20:43.820 --> 20:46.980
what I was working on cause it was making my brain explode.

20:46.980 --> 20:53.540
Had to go back and learn, uh, or relearn some calculus stuff mainly because during my actual

20:53.540 --> 20:58.700
calculus class, well actually pre calculus cause I never took calculus, um, I was too

20:58.700 --> 21:04.340
busy programming a Final Fantasy type game on my calculator.

21:04.340 --> 21:10.500
So um, but then yeah, it was mainly just like, I'm never going to use any of this and then

21:10.500 --> 21:14.420
sure one time I need something.

21:14.420 --> 21:18.100
Obviously there's the internet, um, so yeah, I got that all taken care of.

21:18.100 --> 21:19.100
But yeah.

21:19.100 --> 21:28.700
Uh, Skyrim, I'm 123 hours now into the game and um, I'm telling you, I saw some things

21:28.700 --> 21:31.460
how Skyrim's won all these game of the year awards and stuff.

21:31.460 --> 21:33.860
That game is so fucking broken.

21:33.860 --> 21:34.900
It is just ridiculous.

21:34.900 --> 21:42.060
I literally have to now keep my iPod with me and pull up the quest as I do them to look

21:42.060 --> 21:45.380
at the bugs section, known bugs for this quest.

21:45.380 --> 21:46.540
So I don't run into them.

21:46.540 --> 21:52.620
I ran into two yesterday, um, that were kind, not really game breaking, but it, I mean one

21:52.620 --> 21:57.180
of them would have been pretty fucking annoying if it, you know, thankfully I was able to

21:57.180 --> 22:00.620
go back to a save prior to when I started that quest.

22:00.620 --> 22:04.940
There was an auto save for that, but man, if I hadn't, that would have sucked.

22:04.940 --> 22:14.740
It was, uh, but he VMs calling and um, basically, uh, you're supposed to drag this companion

22:14.740 --> 22:19.580
to this altar and you sacrifice him and then you have to go kill some other people or whatever.

22:19.580 --> 22:22.100
Wait, you'd sacrifice one of your companions?

22:22.100 --> 22:23.100
Awesome.

22:23.100 --> 22:28.220
It's not, it was when I hired, it was a guy that was like, Hey, I'm a stronger guy here.

22:28.220 --> 22:30.060
I'm like, wait, you die.

22:30.060 --> 22:31.060
Hold on.

22:31.060 --> 22:33.740
You hired a companion so you could sacrifice them.

22:33.740 --> 22:34.740
Yes.

22:34.740 --> 22:35.740
Awesome.

22:35.740 --> 22:36.740
Yes.

22:36.740 --> 22:43.180
Um, so anyways, so I did that and one, when she appears though, one of the Daedra appears,

22:43.180 --> 22:49.820
um, it's just like, it does this weird screen effect thing that gets all blurry and purple.

22:49.820 --> 22:51.820
Well that never went away.

22:51.820 --> 22:56.400
Apparently it's a known glitch and normally it's caused by pulling up any of your, if

22:56.400 --> 23:01.500
you hit pause, if you pull up your inventory, anything while that's going, then it will

23:01.500 --> 23:02.580
stay like that.

23:02.580 --> 23:04.100
I didn't do anything like that.

23:04.100 --> 23:06.140
It just did it for fun.

23:06.140 --> 23:10.220
And so I had to restart the whole thing and to get that to go away because I was like,

23:10.220 --> 23:14.140
well, is this supposed to be on all the time while I'm on this quest?

23:14.140 --> 23:17.100
Because this is really hard to see.

23:17.100 --> 23:19.340
But no, it's not for the record.

23:19.340 --> 23:22.820
The other one was when I was trying to become the Thane of Riften.

23:22.820 --> 23:29.140
Apparently if you visit your house, you have to purchase a house in Riften.

23:29.140 --> 23:34.140
If you visit the house before you talk to the Jarl, you can never become the Thane of

23:34.140 --> 23:35.140
Riften.

23:35.140 --> 23:38.220
It just breaks the whole quest.

23:38.220 --> 23:39.220
Thanks.

23:39.220 --> 23:43.740
Thanks for, there is no fucking way they bug tested this game.

23:43.740 --> 23:48.780
I mean, most of the quests they seriously must not have tested at all because there

23:48.780 --> 23:51.000
is no way that this would have been missed.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.700
This is just like completely obvious stuff.

23:54.700 --> 23:57.220
Hey, what would happen if I visited the house first?

23:57.220 --> 23:59.180
Oh, it breaks the fucking quest.

23:59.180 --> 24:01.900
Oh, no, we're not going to test for that.

24:01.900 --> 24:02.900
It's good.

24:02.900 --> 24:05.940
Yeah, it worked the first time I played through it.

24:05.940 --> 24:11.500
Oh, and I cheated in, well, not technically cheated.

24:11.500 --> 24:15.700
I exploited a glitch in the game to level my character up to 81 and a half, which is

24:15.700 --> 24:16.700
the cap.

24:16.700 --> 24:17.700
I capped all my skills at a hundred.

24:17.700 --> 24:20.100
Wait, the cap is 81 and a half?

24:20.100 --> 24:22.140
81 and a half.

24:22.140 --> 24:23.140
Okay.

24:23.140 --> 24:26.260
It just happens to be that's the amount of leveling you get when you have all your skills

24:26.260 --> 24:30.940
at 181 and a half.

24:30.940 --> 24:32.020
It didn't matter anyways.

24:32.020 --> 24:34.740
I'm unkillable anyways, so whatever.

24:34.740 --> 24:39.140
I just didn't want to have to, I wanted to know my perk points right away so I could

24:39.140 --> 24:42.820
like figure out where I wanted them and I actually went back and started doing the actual

24:42.820 --> 24:46.900
main quest line and I got to say, man, that thing is short.

24:46.900 --> 24:48.700
It is a really short quest line.

24:48.700 --> 24:50.260
Well, they usually are.

24:50.260 --> 24:52.900
I mean, the game isn't really about the main quest.

24:52.900 --> 24:56.900
The main quest is just kind of there to help you learn about the game.

24:56.900 --> 24:57.900
Yeah.

24:57.900 --> 25:03.500
I am looking forward to the 1.4 patch so I can finish Blood on the Ice, but at this point

25:03.500 --> 25:04.820
I'm kind of saying, you know what?

25:04.820 --> 25:08.420
So these quests are breaking, it's no big deal because none of them contribute to my

25:08.420 --> 25:10.220
achievement points on there.

25:10.220 --> 25:14.060
So I'm just going to finish all the quests that require, you know, that they need me

25:14.060 --> 25:18.380
to do in order to get my achievements and then I'm going to go kill everybody once I'm

25:18.380 --> 25:19.860
done with all that.

25:19.860 --> 25:22.660
Everybody will die in a bloody rage.

25:22.660 --> 25:27.180
I did see a video this week, it was great, it was of someone had changed their player

25:27.180 --> 25:31.620
model to one of the kids and then they had like some spell on there that was dragon fire

25:31.620 --> 25:32.620
and it was hilarious.

25:32.620 --> 25:33.620
I don't know.

25:33.620 --> 25:34.620
It made me laugh.

25:34.620 --> 25:40.260
It was a why kids, why kids can't be killed because they're actually dragons.

25:40.260 --> 25:41.660
All right.

25:41.660 --> 25:42.660
And Call of Duty.

25:42.660 --> 25:45.540
Play more Call of Duty, of course.

25:45.540 --> 25:47.820
All right, anything else?

25:47.820 --> 25:50.900
I think that's it.

25:50.900 --> 25:51.900
Yeah.

25:51.900 --> 25:53.660
All right.

25:53.660 --> 25:54.660
My gaming week.

25:54.660 --> 25:58.340
See, I actually played quite a bit of new stuff this week, a few games.

25:58.340 --> 26:00.140
Soul Calibur 5, quickly.

26:00.140 --> 26:04.700
I literally played Soul Calibur 5 once, so I don't want to like do a total review on

26:04.700 --> 26:09.380
it, but I did spend, you know, about an hour with it the other night when I got it and,

26:09.380 --> 26:10.540
you know, I had a fairly good time.

26:10.540 --> 26:11.900
The fighting's a lot of fun.

26:11.900 --> 26:12.900
Creative character's great.

26:12.900 --> 26:18.060
I love creative character and, you know, I was making some fun characters with that and

26:18.060 --> 26:22.260
story mode I noticed though right off the bat was kind of weird because like you would

26:22.260 --> 26:29.980
have these full cut scenes and then like a storyboard, like you just see like a cartoon

26:29.980 --> 26:34.180
storyboard that transitions, like it almost feels like it was like half done, a little

26:34.180 --> 26:36.100
bit rushed.

26:36.100 --> 26:40.300
I guess the bottom line I noticed after, you know, the short amount of time I did play

26:40.300 --> 26:43.780
the game is that although the core fighter game itself, which is what you're paying the

26:43.780 --> 26:48.060
money for, is good, I feel like everything kind of on the shell outside of that was a

26:48.060 --> 26:51.700
little bit like rushed or wonky, except, well, creative character's decent.

26:51.700 --> 26:54.940
The only thing that I'm disappointed is that, you know, because it's a game that didn't

26:54.940 --> 26:58.540
really pre-order anything, do you know how they have that pre-order character, that really

26:58.540 --> 26:59.540
weird looking guy?

26:59.540 --> 27:04.020
No, because I didn't pre- oh wait, no, I pre-ordered on Amazon, but they didn't give me anything.

27:04.020 --> 27:07.540
Yeah, you're supposed to get this like pre-order character, it's this guy, maybe it's only

27:07.540 --> 27:11.860
a GameStop or whatever, it's this guy in like a top hat or something like that that's just

27:11.860 --> 27:17.660
really- has some really wacky moves, but that would have been kind of fun to play as.

27:17.660 --> 27:18.660
Interesting.

27:18.660 --> 27:20.500
I think he was from- he may have been from 4.

27:20.500 --> 27:22.100
Or the PSP one maybe, right?

27:22.100 --> 27:24.140
Yeah, he might have been the PSP one.

27:24.140 --> 27:30.100
I wish the lost Amel was in this one, because he was awesome in 3, but I like Tyra a lot,

27:30.100 --> 27:32.460
so I have my custom character model off Tyra.

27:32.460 --> 27:33.660
And Ivy.

27:33.660 --> 27:35.020
I love Ivy.

27:35.020 --> 27:36.020
She's so dirty.

27:36.020 --> 27:37.980
I made a male Ivy.

27:37.980 --> 27:38.980
Awesome.

27:38.980 --> 27:41.420
What, like wearing Voldo's gear?

27:41.420 --> 27:46.580
No, just wearing like a tight top and leather pants, you know.

27:46.580 --> 27:47.580
Cool.

27:47.580 --> 27:48.580
That's pretty cool.

27:48.580 --> 27:53.500
So yeah, Soulcalibur V. I'll tell you more about it when I have more time to play it.

27:53.500 --> 27:59.220
Because I've been, on my Playstation 3, mostly been playing and sucked into Final Fantasy

27:59.220 --> 28:05.380
XIII II, which came out the same day, and I've sunk a good at least 7 hours if not more

28:05.380 --> 28:06.540
into that at this point.

28:06.540 --> 28:12.380
So yeah, I'm really enjoying Final Fantasy XIII II.

28:12.380 --> 28:17.020
I'm really surprised at how divided the internet is on this, because there's just some people

28:17.020 --> 28:20.500
that really just fucking hate Final Fantasy XIII.

28:20.500 --> 28:23.580
And I really don't think this game is going to do much to sway your mind.

28:23.580 --> 28:25.980
I mean, it's to the point, like this is how divided it is.

28:25.980 --> 28:30.460
You know that Final Fantasy XIII II is one of like, what, less than 20 games to get a

28:30.460 --> 28:34.280
perfect 40 from Famitsu magazine, ever, right?

28:34.280 --> 28:38.860
And then like, Edge, I think in the UK, gave it a 5 out of 10.

28:38.860 --> 28:43.820
Like, that's quite a difference between a perfect, pristine score from Famitsu and a

28:43.820 --> 28:44.820
5.

28:44.820 --> 28:47.140
So, I mean, it's just really interesting.

28:47.140 --> 28:50.960
It's because these fucking reviewers go into this shit very biased.

28:50.960 --> 28:55.340
I mean, they're like judging games on shit that they never judged games on before.

28:55.340 --> 28:57.300
It's like, this game is too linear.

28:57.300 --> 28:58.300
Really?

28:58.300 --> 28:59.300
Really?

28:59.300 --> 29:00.300
All these other RPGs were too linear?

29:00.300 --> 29:01.660
I just, I just want to give the disclaimer.

29:01.660 --> 29:04.140
I didn't read either of those reviews, I'm going off Wikipedia.

29:04.140 --> 29:05.700
I was just really surprised though.

29:05.700 --> 29:09.500
I was like, wow, this is really a diverse, you know, I would expect some, you know, not

29:09.500 --> 29:12.660
everybody's going to like everything, but just usually when it's all over the map like

29:12.660 --> 29:16.660
that, especially when Famitsu gave it such a high score, it just really surprised me.

29:16.660 --> 29:18.860
But anyway, let's not talk about what other people thought of it.

29:18.860 --> 29:20.940
Let's talk about what I thought of it.

29:20.940 --> 29:25.060
Of course, what they're doing is they're trying to fix a lot of what people bitched about

29:25.060 --> 29:28.220
with XIII.

29:28.220 --> 29:32.020
There's definitely not a linear sense in this game whatsoever now.

29:32.020 --> 29:38.280
You have this interesting map, um, the crux that you can travel to all these different

29:38.280 --> 29:43.740
time zones feels a little bit chrono-triggery kind of where they're pulling the story from.

29:43.740 --> 29:49.180
The story has a lot to do with time travel, like, and it's, it's a bit of a mind fuck

29:49.180 --> 29:55.580
because you start creating alternate timelines of the exact same place you just were.

29:55.580 --> 30:00.820
So like I'm at a point in the story where I was at a place 10 years in the future, but

30:00.820 --> 30:06.940
then I unlocked alternate timeline 10 years in the future because of something I did 200

30:06.940 --> 30:09.120
years in the future resolving the paradox.

30:09.120 --> 30:12.380
So it's like, it's enough time travel stuff to make your head spin.

30:12.380 --> 30:13.660
That sounds like lots of fun.

30:13.660 --> 30:15.500
That sounds like hanging out with Nordstrom.

30:15.500 --> 30:18.640
It's it's really like an entire season with a doctor.

30:18.640 --> 30:24.420
It's really an entire season of Doctor Who squished into a video game or it actually

30:24.420 --> 30:27.960
in some ways it reminds me of Quantum Leap.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.460
Like where in Knoll, Knoll and Sarah going to end up next?

30:30.460 --> 30:31.460
Wah, wah, wah.

30:31.460 --> 30:38.460
Um, but, uh, yeah, I mean the, the, the really good thing about 13 too is that the battle

30:38.460 --> 30:44.460
system is robust right off the bat and you know, well, maybe you don't really get the

30:44.460 --> 30:48.820
monster character and the monster trapping and all that till episode two, but needless

30:48.820 --> 30:55.500
to say in 13, one of the big issues that people had was that it took forever before you even

30:55.500 --> 30:59.300
got to like where you can flip paradigms and where the battle system becomes really interesting

30:59.300 --> 31:01.180
when you get the whole paradigm stuff, right?

31:01.180 --> 31:03.540
For the first two chapters, you're pretty much just button mashing.

31:03.540 --> 31:05.900
There's nothing else to do but auto attack.

31:05.900 --> 31:10.200
But in 13 too, that paradigm stuff starts battle one, which is good.

31:10.200 --> 31:17.180
So, um, towns are back, random conversations, side quests that people want you to do for

31:17.180 --> 31:18.180
them.

31:18.180 --> 31:20.940
Uh, Chocolena, who's now the shop, who's shows up everywhere.

31:20.940 --> 31:21.940
I love Chocolena.

31:21.940 --> 31:24.700
She's like a Vegas showgirl meets, uh, uh, Chocobo.

31:24.700 --> 31:25.700
It's great.

31:25.700 --> 31:29.860
And, um, apparently there's like a casino later on with tons of mini games and all that

31:29.860 --> 31:30.860
stuff.

31:30.860 --> 31:33.140
So I, I'm really enjoying it.

31:33.140 --> 31:39.020
You know, the story, although it's kind of confusing, like I hate to make myself sound

31:39.020 --> 31:44.500
like stupid, but I'm, the story's like really confusing, but I got to say it is really cool,

31:44.500 --> 31:51.980
um, to kind of see characters from 13 years later and they do some neat stuff with that.

31:51.980 --> 31:53.580
So it's cool.

31:53.580 --> 31:57.380
The only thing about the characters that's a little weird is that your party only has

31:57.380 --> 32:00.380
two people and I don't know if that's ever going to change.

32:00.380 --> 32:04.900
I kind of think the whole game might be just the two people and the rotating monster that

32:04.900 --> 32:06.380
might turn some people off.

32:06.380 --> 32:07.380
I don't know.

32:07.380 --> 32:09.180
I think there's other stuff through DLC.

32:09.180 --> 32:12.220
I think you might be able to get more characters as DLC.

32:12.220 --> 32:17.700
That's a little bit side eye and judging square for jumping on that bandwagon because I really

32:17.700 --> 32:22.320
don't like when so much stuff is behind DLC.

32:22.320 --> 32:27.340
You know, it's kind of like now games are really costing $90 because it's $60 for what

32:27.340 --> 32:28.340
you wouldn't.

32:28.340 --> 32:31.700
You know, a lot of that costume shit is paid to unlock content.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.540
Oh, of course it is.

32:33.540 --> 32:34.780
Of course it is.

32:34.780 --> 32:37.380
There's nothing to download right now.

32:37.380 --> 32:42.740
But I'm told that a bunch of zone areas are unlocked through DLC and I heard that lightning

32:42.740 --> 32:46.440
in a general from the first game are supposed to be DLC at some point.

32:46.440 --> 32:52.860
So I have to judge square a little bit for hopping on that bandwagon.

32:52.860 --> 32:57.660
You know, especially when the series is a little bit vulnerable right now.

32:57.660 --> 33:01.780
I think that, especially when your game only has two characters in it, that's a little

33:01.780 --> 33:04.860
bit judging you.

33:04.860 --> 33:11.380
But at least the game that you get for the money you pay for it is a robust experience

33:11.380 --> 33:14.380
and I can think of far worse games to blow $60 on.

33:14.380 --> 33:17.540
I don't think this game is worthy of a $5.

33:17.540 --> 33:22.740
I don't know if it's a perfect $40, but it's really good.

33:22.740 --> 33:24.340
But not perfect.

33:24.340 --> 33:27.020
So that's what I think about Final Fantasy 13, too.

33:27.020 --> 33:29.980
I think if you liked 13, play it.

33:29.980 --> 33:35.980
And don't let that hurdle of, but I never beat 13 stop you.

33:35.980 --> 33:40.500
Because yes, the game will tell you what happened at the end of 13 and you can even go through

33:40.500 --> 33:44.780
a mode that will just walk you through the story of Final Fantasy 13.

33:44.780 --> 33:48.300
Albeit it's kind of like narrated text, but you get the idea.

33:48.300 --> 33:52.820
I didn't beat 13 and I don't feel like it was really ruined for me.

33:52.820 --> 33:58.400
Yes, I will know what happens right at the end of 13, but there's still a lot of stuff

33:58.400 --> 34:00.820
that it takes to get there.

34:00.820 --> 34:05.020
So just knowing the ending I don't think is going to totally ruin 13 for me.

34:05.020 --> 34:06.020
Because I will have to go back.

34:06.020 --> 34:10.620
Because I was on chapter 12 when I stopped, I got a long way through it.

34:10.620 --> 34:13.900
But yeah, 13, too, is worth your time.

34:13.900 --> 34:16.220
One other game I played this week.

34:16.220 --> 34:19.180
So Tangent for a minute.

34:19.180 --> 34:23.720
Orange Launch Radio started, of course, for many years.

34:23.720 --> 34:28.940
For about, what, four years, we were a show exclusively about music games.

34:28.940 --> 34:33.740
Because DarkSakura, Loki, and myself all met playing DDR at the local arcade and the original

34:33.740 --> 34:39.980
concept behind the show was let's make this kind of like show about what we enjoy doing

34:39.980 --> 34:43.500
at the arcades every Wednesday or Thursday night, whatever night it was we were going

34:43.500 --> 34:44.860
back then.

34:44.860 --> 34:48.920
And we always used to go to Brookfield's, the diner, afterwards and kind of talk shit

34:48.920 --> 34:49.920
about games.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.980
It was kind of like let's do that as like our show.

34:52.980 --> 34:54.820
So for a long time it was about music games.

34:54.820 --> 34:57.260
We talked about DDR and the new songs are coming out in DDR.

34:57.260 --> 35:01.340
We used to talk about guitar freaks and drum media and keyboard media, Para Para Paradise.

35:01.340 --> 35:02.540
All these games that Konami did.

35:02.540 --> 35:07.220
And when they first came out, I think we were right on, I think we changed formats right

35:07.220 --> 35:12.020
around the time Guitar Hero was breaking and all that stuff.

35:12.020 --> 35:18.260
So the bottom line is we switched from doing a music game only show to a gaming show because

35:18.260 --> 35:22.220
there wasn't a lot of stuff in the music game world to talk about anymore, which was ironic

35:22.220 --> 35:26.420
because then about a year after we switched, Rock Band and Guitar Hero 2 and all that just

35:26.420 --> 35:27.940
made it huge.

35:27.940 --> 35:32.020
But we felt like there was more we could do talking about regular games.

35:32.020 --> 35:37.780
I haven't been following the music gaming scene as closely since then, but I do kind

35:37.780 --> 35:40.380
of like, you know, I like to, I check Bamani style once in a while.

35:40.380 --> 35:44.100
I checked DDR freak when that was still running, you know, and I would just kind of like keep,

35:44.100 --> 35:49.740
I'd like to keep tabs on the music game scene, but I gotta say I haven't really, really enjoyed

35:49.740 --> 35:52.140
a Bamani game in a long time.

35:52.140 --> 35:53.140
I haven't.

35:53.140 --> 35:57.620
I haven't really cared for a lot of the music in the newer BeatMania 2DX's.

35:57.620 --> 36:02.260
I didn't think Ju-Beat was all that, or U-Beat or whatever they call that game.

36:02.260 --> 36:05.420
I didn't think, what else has come out since then?

36:05.420 --> 36:11.260
Pop'n Music, you know, the one they tried here on the Xbox was absolutely awful.

36:11.260 --> 36:13.800
The Wii one was really weird.

36:13.800 --> 36:19.660
So I can't say I've really, really, truly enjoyed a Bamani game until I think this week.

36:19.660 --> 36:27.060
I downloaded a game on Xbox Live that's out called Rhythm Party, and I have to say it's

36:27.060 --> 36:28.860
actually pretty good.

36:28.860 --> 36:35.860
Now, it's not perfect, there are some things wrong with it, but all things considered,

36:35.860 --> 36:40.780
Rhythm Party is kind of the game that Dance Masters, the Kinect game that came out last

36:40.780 --> 36:48.060
year on Xbox 360, that was like Konami's first, like, let's put a Bamani game with Kinect.

36:48.060 --> 36:51.700
Rhythm Party is the game that Dance Masters should have been, I really think.

36:51.700 --> 36:57.220
Ironically enough, Dance Masters, or Dance Evolution as it's called in Japan, is an arcade

36:57.220 --> 37:00.420
game, or will become an arcade game very soon.

37:00.420 --> 37:01.420
Really?

37:01.420 --> 37:02.420
But Rhythm Party should.

37:02.420 --> 37:03.420
Yeah.

37:03.420 --> 37:10.660
Okay, here's the thing about Rhythm Party, like, Konami is setting this game up to fail,

37:10.660 --> 37:11.780
I really think.

37:11.780 --> 37:13.820
Like I kind of think this is just coming out.

37:13.820 --> 37:18.400
Like, I went to Bamani's style to see what they were saying about it, there's nothing

37:18.400 --> 37:19.400
on it.

37:19.400 --> 37:24.060
I went to, I put it on Twitter, like Rhythm Party, and like, nobody's talking about it.

37:24.060 --> 37:26.100
I saw like one Major Nelson tweet.

37:26.100 --> 37:31.060
The only way I knew about this game was from following Naoki Madaya on Facebook, who is

37:31.060 --> 37:33.980
of course one of the big, you know, guys, and we mentioned it, remember we mentioned

37:33.980 --> 37:37.500
it on the show last week, because we were like, oh, Naoki's teasing this game, and I

37:37.500 --> 37:40.700
remembered that, and so I'm like, oh, I'll download it and check it out, and when I fired

37:40.700 --> 37:45.660
it up, I noticed that the menu music was the music from Dance Dance Revolution 5th Mix,

37:45.660 --> 37:49.140
and I was like, oh, I loved 5th Mix, I love this music, this is awesome.

37:49.140 --> 37:52.820
And then I went into the game, and I was kind of like looking through the songs, I'm like,

37:52.820 --> 37:57.280
okay, well, even though it's only 10 songs, this is a decent mix of songs, like there's

37:57.280 --> 38:03.560
more stuff that's interesting to me here than there was in all of Dance Masters, so, and

38:03.560 --> 38:06.060
then I fired up the game and played it for a little bit.

38:06.060 --> 38:08.700
So let me tell you where this game's a little bit different.

38:08.700 --> 38:13.420
It's not really like, like Dance Masters or Dance Central at all, because you're not trying

38:13.420 --> 38:16.580
to mimic a pre-choreographed dance.

38:16.580 --> 38:21.580
It's actually a lot more like DDR, or really, Samba de Amigo, because what you're trying

38:21.580 --> 38:24.680
to do is you're trying to hit these balls as they fall into the circle.

38:24.680 --> 38:26.700
That's exactly what Samba de Amigo had, right?

38:26.700 --> 38:30.540
But you're trying to hit them with your hands, you're trying to hit them with your feet.

38:30.540 --> 38:35.200
So you might hit this ball over here and then kick one with your foot and stuff, and it's

38:35.200 --> 38:39.580
kind of like you get points depending on the timing of when you hit the balls.

38:39.580 --> 38:43.500
But you also get extra points as you freestyle.

38:43.500 --> 38:47.180
If you jump, you get extra points, if you turn, you get extra points.

38:47.180 --> 38:52.460
If you hit balls with hands, you're not supposed to, like you do like crossovers and stuff,

38:52.460 --> 38:54.420
you get extra points.

38:54.420 --> 38:56.820
You know, if you do poses and stuff, you get extra points.

38:56.820 --> 39:01.380
So there's really this emphasis on kind of making your own dance out of the balls that

39:01.380 --> 39:04.380
fly in, you know, out of that kind of pattern.

39:04.380 --> 39:09.100
And it was, it was entertaining, especially for somebody that kind of really liked DDR

39:09.100 --> 39:12.100
that was all about timing and, you know, hitting the arrows.

39:12.100 --> 39:17.300
This is truly a Kinect version of DDR, which I don't think Dance Masters was.

39:17.300 --> 39:22.360
Dance Masters unfortunately felt like, hmm, Dance Central did this a little better.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.780
Better music, easier to understand the choreography.

39:25.780 --> 39:30.500
Whereas I think this is now a true, okay, it's not about the choreography, it's about,

39:30.500 --> 39:34.300
you know, the more music timing and doing all this.

39:34.300 --> 39:40.900
So yeah, the song list, there's only 10 songs, which is a little eh, because two of them

39:40.900 --> 39:42.500
feature Vanilla Ice.

39:42.500 --> 39:50.520
But there are some good choices in there, Born This Way, Every Little Step, YMCA.

39:50.520 --> 39:56.280
Every song, this is, this is what remind, this is what really reminded me of old DDR.

39:56.280 --> 40:02.600
Every song has its own unique background, its own unique video, and its own unique kind

40:02.600 --> 40:05.620
of thing that your character like does or turns into.

40:05.620 --> 40:07.020
Let me explain what I mean.

40:07.020 --> 40:10.780
Like when you're playing Born This Way by Lady Gaga, if you do really well, you suddenly

40:10.780 --> 40:14.520
turn into like this electric peacock, I don't even know how to explain it.

40:14.520 --> 40:16.540
But the cool thing is, it's still you.

40:16.540 --> 40:18.220
You look like a human pipe organ.

40:18.220 --> 40:19.940
Yeah, it's kind of crazy.

40:19.940 --> 40:21.300
With headlights.

40:21.300 --> 40:26.500
That one song with all the anime rabbits and stuff, you turn into like a little butterfly.

40:26.500 --> 40:28.940
There's another one where you slowly turn into an astronaut.

40:28.940 --> 40:32.140
It's really cool because at the end of the song, your little astronaut like blasts off

40:32.140 --> 40:33.140
into space.

40:33.140 --> 40:36.500
And that reminded me of old DDR because remember like old DDR was like, oh, the backgrounds

40:36.500 --> 40:38.620
and the movies and all the animations.

40:38.620 --> 40:44.080
Like every song had its own unique one and Born This Way had the real video, YMCA has

40:44.080 --> 40:47.700
the real video, every little step has the real video.

40:47.700 --> 40:51.580
And it's like, everything I used to really like about the DDR games is kind of in this

40:51.580 --> 40:53.060
game.

40:53.060 --> 41:02.900
But what I what I really feel like I'm playing here is the demo for a full retail game.

41:02.900 --> 41:05.380
Like where's the rest of the songs?

41:05.380 --> 41:06.780
Where's multiplayer?

41:06.780 --> 41:08.660
Where's anything?

41:08.660 --> 41:13.540
I really feel like they're selling a demo for what could potentially be a really good

41:13.540 --> 41:14.780
retail game.

41:14.780 --> 41:17.980
But I have this bad feeling because nobody knows about it.

41:17.980 --> 41:24.440
Like, I really like feel like Konami just kind of, okay, Naoki, we know you have this

41:24.440 --> 41:25.440
idea.

41:25.440 --> 41:28.380
Why don't you throw something together and like, you know, they threw together the demo

41:28.380 --> 41:33.640
and you know, Konami was just like, let's just let's just put it out on Xbox Live and

41:33.640 --> 41:35.180
see if it sticks.

41:35.180 --> 41:36.600
And I just had this really bad feeling.

41:36.600 --> 41:39.240
It's not Denno.

41:39.240 --> 41:42.660
There's room for the game to support DLC.

41:42.660 --> 41:47.620
I don't know if I trust Konami to handle the DLC appropriately based on other games where

41:47.620 --> 41:50.340
like, you know, two songs ever come out as DLC.

41:50.340 --> 41:54.580
I'm going to just cross my fingers and really hope that they get some licensed songs.

41:54.580 --> 41:59.300
They get some good stuff in there to really round out the game.

41:59.300 --> 42:02.420
But yeah, I guess I'm going on a long time about this.

42:02.420 --> 42:05.060
But Rhythm Party is really not bad.

42:05.060 --> 42:08.740
And if you're listening to this show because you are a fan of Bomani from the yesteryear

42:08.740 --> 42:13.100
and so forth, I seriously go check out the demo at least.

42:13.100 --> 42:16.700
And tell me if you don't like see a little bit of the old DDR in it.

42:16.700 --> 42:21.480
Like I think it's like the closest thing to like a DDR Connect fused experience we're

42:21.480 --> 42:22.660
going to see.

42:22.660 --> 42:26.940
And I'll be really bummed if it doesn't go anywhere other than this, because it's not

42:26.940 --> 42:27.940
that bad.

42:27.940 --> 42:30.300
I know, Jamie, you just only got to watch me play it a little bit.

42:30.300 --> 42:34.260
But I think you kind of went into it going, really, Rhythm Party, but you kind of seem

42:34.260 --> 42:36.220
like you're like, oh, this is cute, right?

42:36.220 --> 42:37.220
Yeah.

42:37.220 --> 42:38.220
Yeah.

42:38.220 --> 42:39.220
I want.

42:39.220 --> 42:40.220
Actually, I do want.

42:40.220 --> 42:42.460
Loki, you've always been a vocal critic of Konami.

42:42.460 --> 42:45.140
I know you haven't really played it, but you saw me doing it for a little bit.

42:45.140 --> 42:46.140
It looked okay.

42:46.140 --> 42:49.660
I mean, but when I saw them announcing this, I'm like, oh, that's going to suck.

42:49.660 --> 42:53.460
I'm just like, I don't even want to look at it.

42:53.460 --> 42:55.380
And it was just all right.

42:55.380 --> 43:01.180
I mean, it's like, I remember my snarky comment on it was like, oh yeah.

43:01.180 --> 43:06.500
Or I don't remember what it was, it's like something about like, um, about they're all

43:06.500 --> 43:08.700
you guys excited, you know, pretty blah, blah, blah.

43:08.700 --> 43:12.100
I'm like, yeah, like beat and groovy.

43:12.100 --> 43:13.700
Remember how they handled that?

43:13.700 --> 43:14.700
Yeah.

43:14.700 --> 43:16.260
I'm really excited about Rhythm Party.

43:16.260 --> 43:17.260
Exactly.

43:17.260 --> 43:20.660
Like it's like, unfortunately, all the missteps that Konami has made with Bimani up until

43:20.660 --> 43:23.660
now, like makes everybody like, oh, yay, Rhythm Party's out.

43:23.660 --> 43:28.900
But like, no, go like, I don't know what happened behind the scenes, but it is worth your time

43:28.900 --> 43:29.900
to check out.

43:29.900 --> 43:33.460
Well, the way they may be treating is like a retail game where they're going to hopefully

43:33.460 --> 43:38.540
have a lot of DLC and then it's like, okay, I'm purchasing the, you know, a $60 game or

43:38.540 --> 43:41.280
something because of all this $50 or DLC or something.

43:41.280 --> 43:42.500
How much is the game by the way?

43:42.500 --> 43:43.500
Is it 10 bucks?

43:43.500 --> 43:44.500
10 bucks.

43:44.500 --> 43:45.500
Yeah.

43:45.500 --> 43:46.500
That's all right.

43:46.500 --> 43:47.500
I guess.

43:47.500 --> 43:48.500
I don't know.

43:48.500 --> 43:49.500
It seems a little expensive.

43:49.500 --> 43:50.500
It really depends how the DLC goes over.

43:50.500 --> 43:55.620
Like I would really think it would be not that hard to just slap together a 10 pack

43:55.620 --> 44:00.020
of, a song, a 10 pack of old DDR classics.

44:00.020 --> 44:01.020
Yeah.

44:01.020 --> 44:03.940
I realize if you're doing custom backgrounds for everything, maybe that takes a little

44:03.940 --> 44:08.020
more time and art and so forth, but even they could get away with fudging it a little bit.

44:08.020 --> 44:11.220
The old DDR games recycled a few things here and there recycle some art, some of the art

44:11.220 --> 44:15.460
assets and just put out like 10 other DDR songs for free.

44:15.460 --> 44:18.000
And then this game will have a really enhanced value.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
I think it will.

44:19.000 --> 44:24.240
And then put some, like, if you get some decent licenses, like they, they licensed gaga, somebody

44:24.240 --> 44:31.660
paid for that, like, you know, but unfortunately it's one modern song and then two retro classics

44:31.660 --> 44:39.860
with Bobby Black Wolf or Bobby Black Wolf, Bobby Black Wolf, AKA Vanilla Ice.

44:39.860 --> 44:42.260
I actually liked the Vanilla Ice song.

44:42.260 --> 44:50.100
Bobby Brown, Bobby, and that clip's going to end up on his show at some point.

44:50.100 --> 44:53.340
Watch, uh, Bobby Brown and, uh, village people.

44:53.340 --> 44:54.340
They're like the retro bigs.

44:54.340 --> 44:55.340
That's really it.

44:55.340 --> 45:00.020
And then the rest of the vanilla ice retro yet new, you know what, the songs, they're

45:00.020 --> 45:01.020
not terrible.

45:01.020 --> 45:03.740
They're not terrible.

45:03.740 --> 45:06.980
They're not like, I'm going to go run out and buy the CD tomorrow, but they're better

45:06.980 --> 45:13.420
than most of the stuff from dance masters, which was very unremarkable.

45:13.420 --> 45:17.020
Dance masters was just frustrating and the fact that they're making an arcade game now

45:17.020 --> 45:19.940
it's just, there was no cues whatsoever to what to do.

45:19.940 --> 45:26.380
Yeah, and I understand that, you know, par games and stuff like that, you know, that

45:26.380 --> 45:30.460
you have to learn the dances and stuff, but come on, Para at least had fucking arrows

45:30.460 --> 45:33.380
that would kind of cue you into what to do.

45:33.380 --> 45:38.500
Um, or clue you in, I should say cue you in, it's not a word, uh, clue you on what to do.

45:38.500 --> 45:42.740
But even like even one of the games had an actual like character doing the actual dance

45:42.740 --> 45:44.820
and stuff, but dance masters had nothing.

45:44.820 --> 45:47.460
There was flash every once in a while.

45:47.460 --> 45:50.220
It's like, how's it, how am I, how am I going to follow this?

45:50.220 --> 45:53.540
The only reason I was ever able to do anything good at dance masters was that I knew the

45:53.540 --> 45:54.540
Para Para.

45:54.540 --> 45:55.540
Yeah.

45:55.540 --> 45:58.460
There's only two, there's really only two Para Para songs in that whole game.

45:58.460 --> 45:59.460
There really are.

45:59.460 --> 46:00.460
There's five.

46:00.460 --> 46:02.180
No, there's two.

46:02.180 --> 46:04.180
There's um, yester, no.

46:04.180 --> 46:05.180
Night of fire.

46:05.180 --> 46:06.180
There are two.

46:06.180 --> 46:07.180
Night of fire.

46:07.180 --> 46:08.540
Uh, I thought there were two others.

46:08.540 --> 46:09.540
I thought that they did.

46:09.540 --> 46:11.460
Well maybe there's unlocks I never got to.

46:11.460 --> 46:12.460
I don't know.

46:12.460 --> 46:13.460
I thought like a virgin was in there.

46:13.460 --> 46:14.460
No, I don't think so.

46:14.460 --> 46:15.460
Unless.

46:15.460 --> 46:17.500
I don't know, but anyway, whatever.

46:17.500 --> 46:21.540
Uh, anyway, I've spent a lot of time talking about that song or that's talking about that

46:21.540 --> 46:25.300
game, but uh, you know, just as I've been a fan of music games for so, so long, I was

46:25.300 --> 46:30.100
just really surprised at what an unremarkable launch this game has had, but I think it's

46:30.100 --> 46:31.100
worth your attention.

46:31.100 --> 46:32.100
I really do.

46:32.100 --> 46:36.620
And if anybody from Konami haha is listening, you might want to consider making rhythm party

46:36.620 --> 46:41.020
the arcade game because I think, but maybe it needs a better name.

46:41.020 --> 46:43.060
I don't think rhythm party is the best name.

46:43.060 --> 46:44.740
You know, they're calling it in Japan.

46:44.740 --> 46:46.920
Boom boom dance.

46:46.920 --> 46:47.920
That's a better name.

46:47.920 --> 46:50.740
Which is, but there's no boom, boom dollar in it.

46:50.740 --> 46:55.180
And you know, you know why I bet they didn't call it that here because of boom, boom rocket.

46:55.180 --> 47:00.140
Remember boom, boom rocket from EA like, um, God, that was about five years ago now.

47:00.140 --> 47:03.300
I was an old ass, the one with little arrows that would come up and you do the fireworks

47:03.300 --> 47:08.420
and I was like, okay, it says, I'm looking at here, it says that there's an achievement

47:08.420 --> 47:10.340
for playing three Para Para genre songs.

47:10.340 --> 47:11.340
Huh?

47:11.340 --> 47:14.660
All right, well then maybe, well maybe there's like other songs that weren't in Para Para

47:14.660 --> 47:15.660
paradise.

47:15.660 --> 47:16.660
I just, I don't know.

47:16.660 --> 47:17.660
I think that's what it was.

47:17.660 --> 47:18.660
Maybe.

47:18.660 --> 47:19.660
All right.

47:19.660 --> 47:20.660
Whatever.

47:20.660 --> 47:21.660
There are songs that I knew, but they weren't in Para Para paradise.

47:21.660 --> 47:22.660
All right.

47:22.660 --> 47:23.660
I believe you.

47:23.660 --> 47:24.660
It's dance masters.

47:24.660 --> 47:27.700
It wasn't, you know, but anyway, uh, okay.

47:27.700 --> 47:28.940
That's it for my gaming week.

47:28.940 --> 47:30.280
I've talked plenty.

47:30.280 --> 47:34.660
So housekeeping real quick, follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio, or

47:34.660 --> 47:41.780
of course there's Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R let's get into some news and Loki's

47:41.780 --> 47:42.780
going to start us off tonight.

47:42.780 --> 47:45.620
You got a lot of stuff about one particular company, right?

47:45.620 --> 47:50.300
Um, and I also, I was going to say, here's the, the song list for dance masters.

47:50.300 --> 47:51.300
Let's see.

47:51.300 --> 48:01.980
So night of fire was one of, um, uh, yesterday was the other Para song and um, I don't know.

48:01.980 --> 48:06.980
It might've been one of these other, uh, there's a lot of songs I don't recognize.

48:06.980 --> 48:11.420
Maybe I can't stop falling in love super Euro version because that did have a Para.

48:11.420 --> 48:13.220
That wasn't Para Para.

48:13.220 --> 48:14.220
Okay.

48:14.220 --> 48:15.220
That was a Para Para song.

48:15.220 --> 48:16.220
I bet.

48:16.220 --> 48:17.220
That's it then.

48:17.220 --> 48:18.220
All right.

48:18.220 --> 48:19.220
Mystery solved.

48:19.220 --> 48:20.220
All right.

48:20.220 --> 48:21.220
Fair enough.

48:21.220 --> 48:24.100
If only it was that easy for companies to do well.

48:24.100 --> 48:29.500
Uh, THQ on the other hand has been having a rough, a boom, boom fire of their own.

48:29.500 --> 48:34.460
They've been having a rough, uh, rough year I should say.

48:34.460 --> 48:41.180
Um, first, you know, was it weeks ago with rumors that they've gotten rid of their 2014

48:41.180 --> 48:44.840
line up because of problems?

48:44.840 --> 48:48.580
Maybe they're, maybe this is the smoke to the fire I guess.

48:48.580 --> 48:56.380
Uh, first off, THQ received a, um, stock delisting notice and they basically have 180 calendar

48:56.380 --> 49:03.460
days until July 23rd, um, to make the stock regain compliance for 10 consecutive business

49:03.460 --> 49:04.460
days.

49:04.460 --> 49:10.820
If the company can't comply, then they get taken off the stock market basically.

49:10.820 --> 49:16.180
And of course, uh, their stock has fallen quite a bit down to about 70 cents a share.

49:16.180 --> 49:19.420
Um, so that's not good.

49:19.420 --> 49:28.020
Also the CEO, um, they've taken a, uh, 50% pay cut and also the, uh, board of directors

49:28.020 --> 49:31.860
has, they've taken pay cuts as well.

49:31.860 --> 49:34.580
Meaning $10 million as opposed to 20.

49:34.580 --> 49:40.780
No, no, no, no, no, um, actually the CEO doesn't make

49:40.780 --> 49:41.780
millions of dollars.

49:41.780 --> 49:44.580
Uh, he does make quite a, you know, six figures.

49:44.580 --> 49:53.460
He dropped his salary from $718,500 a year to $359,250 a year.

49:53.460 --> 49:57.540
How's he going to scrape by is what I want to know, man, that's, that's some tough stuff

49:57.540 --> 49:58.540
right there.

49:58.540 --> 50:01.580
God, that's just disgusting.

50:01.580 --> 50:07.820
Um, and then of course, you know, uh, some of the other, you know, they've cut from three

50:07.820 --> 50:13.340
times the highest bonus to, was it the just as highest bonus ever.

50:13.340 --> 50:17.580
At least he wasn't forced to take the, um, you know, Apple CEO at Steve jobs used to

50:17.580 --> 50:20.020
get a dollar and then a bunch of stock options.

50:20.020 --> 50:21.020
Yeah.

50:21.020 --> 50:23.160
This guy wasn't forced to take the board.

50:23.160 --> 50:29.940
The board of directors, uh, they've, uh, decided to take 50% less cash compensation for a year.

50:29.940 --> 50:39.860
Um, also unfortunately with all these cuts and delisting threats come layoffs, uh, 240

50:39.860 --> 50:47.580
people, um, were set to be laid off and it would be, uh, I guess cross, uh, nine months.

50:47.580 --> 50:53.500
Um, they said it's, it should be a, let's see, you have time to finish whatever game

50:53.500 --> 50:54.820
they were working on.

50:54.820 --> 50:55.820
Yeah.

50:55.820 --> 51:00.620
Uh, no, I don't believe 240, uh, 240 is the correct number.

51:00.620 --> 51:01.620
It's up to 240.

51:01.620 --> 51:05.740
I want to say it was a hundred and like 72 or something like that is what it's supposed

51:05.740 --> 51:06.740
to be.

51:06.740 --> 51:12.420
Um, and they said that this isn't anything that they were trying to hide, that the cuts

51:12.420 --> 51:18.320
were described in their statement last week and that no studios are a part of this.

51:18.320 --> 51:22.460
It's administration and publishing offices worldwide.

51:22.460 --> 51:30.980
And, uh, you know, also, um, it's, you know, do the varying employment guidelines around

51:30.980 --> 51:34.380
the world and internal finance considerations.

51:34.380 --> 51:40.220
The restructuring will be completed by February or I'm not February, September 30th, 2012,

51:40.220 --> 51:43.780
but most affected employees have already been notified.

51:43.780 --> 51:53.460
Um, and then on top of all that, um, you know, they've revealed that they've lost $56 million

51:53.460 --> 52:01.620
in a quarter three, which, uh, that would, uh, let's see, quarter ending in December

52:01.620 --> 52:03.660
31st, 2011.

52:03.660 --> 52:06.140
I'm kind of surprised that they lost a lot of money.

52:06.140 --> 52:11.020
I guess they were just in the hole so much, um, that, you know, even though Saints Row

52:11.020 --> 52:21.060
III and WWE 12 did good, um, or, well, I should say, um, it just wasn't enough to kind of

52:21.060 --> 52:23.340
make up for the slump of sales.

52:23.340 --> 52:25.980
And they actually had a pretty good quarter.

52:25.980 --> 52:29.620
I mean, I think we started off with, I don't remember if Warhammer, no, I don't think Warhammer

52:29.620 --> 52:31.740
was in the, in that quarter.

52:31.740 --> 52:37.580
I think that was Q2, but anyways, regardless of that, one other game did come out in quarter

52:37.580 --> 52:42.060
three for them and that would have been U-Draw and they're not putting out any more of those.

52:42.060 --> 52:47.140
Is all of this like sad trombone stuff for THQ?

52:47.140 --> 52:49.300
Is it all because of U-Draw or is there?

52:49.300 --> 52:53.060
I don't think these, I don't think they could have, I mean, could one peripheral bring down

52:53.060 --> 52:57.620
a company like that or is it because they're, their kiddie games are not doing too well

52:57.620 --> 53:02.280
either, but their kiddie games not doing well, I don't think is a big deal because even this

53:02.280 --> 53:12.140
year they focused more on, um, well, not entirely, more so on, um, kiddie, or less on kiddie

53:12.140 --> 53:13.740
games, more on their core franchises.

53:13.740 --> 53:19.500
However though, they did have a few games come out that were kind of kiddie that did

53:19.500 --> 53:20.500
not do well.

53:20.500 --> 53:25.740
Like, for example, they had Kung Fu Panda 2, which kind of bombed, and you know what,

53:25.740 --> 53:28.860
it really is kind of their fault though, it bombed, I mean, let's see.

53:28.860 --> 53:33.900
They had it on the PS3, which no one really buys kids games on the PS3, the Xbox 360 version

53:33.900 --> 53:38.940
was Kinect required, the Wii version was U-Draw required, Wii right there, that is a problem,

53:38.940 --> 53:42.180
see if they had it, you know, kind of, that is a prime audience right there and you're

53:42.180 --> 53:49.060
really limiting it to people that buy your fucking tablet, which no one did, I mean,

53:49.060 --> 53:50.220
it's just kind of annoying.

53:50.220 --> 53:55.620
Dungeon Buster in our chatroom at chat.orangemanjr.com says Saints Row the Third and WWE 12 did well,

53:55.620 --> 53:58.540
but U-Draw crapped all over the good news for both games.

53:58.540 --> 54:01.260
It's just, it's really shocking to me, like, that U-Draw is...

54:01.260 --> 54:02.260
I don't think it was that.

54:02.260 --> 54:05.420
I don't think that that had a big...

54:05.420 --> 54:11.340
But U-Draw was a huge investment for them, and I mean, nobody bought it.

54:11.340 --> 54:16.780
Like the one on the Wii, that came out what, a year before, a couple years ago, that one

54:16.780 --> 54:21.620
got bought, but didn't they try to put that U-Draw tablet on the PS3?

54:21.620 --> 54:22.620
It was on PS3 and 360.

54:22.620 --> 54:24.180
That was a huge mistake.

54:24.180 --> 54:25.180
That was a huge mistake.

54:25.180 --> 54:28.220
Yeah, it came out, that was what they were trying to debut and they were trying to debut

54:28.220 --> 54:29.220
some other games.

54:29.220 --> 54:35.060
I would argue, literally, no one bought it on the PlayStation 3.

54:35.060 --> 54:36.940
I'd say probably close to no one bought it.

54:36.940 --> 54:40.500
Yeah, obviously, that's what I really mean.

54:40.500 --> 54:44.620
But then also, you know, they had the Penguins of Madagascar game and stuff like that that

54:44.620 --> 54:48.180
came out that no one gave a shit about.

54:48.180 --> 54:54.100
Is it maybe because if you tie into movies that aren't so successful at the box office,

54:54.100 --> 54:58.140
like, wasn't that, or what penguin movie was that?

54:58.140 --> 55:00.780
Well, it wasn't even a movie, it was just Penguins of Madagascar.

55:00.780 --> 55:03.980
It's all the DreamWorks properties is what they had.

55:03.980 --> 55:08.700
They had a SpongeBob game that no one gave a shit about that came out.

55:08.700 --> 55:11.180
It just, that stuff doesn't do well anymore.

55:11.180 --> 55:17.140
I mean, kind of, it's run its course and no one really cared about Puss in Boots the game.

55:17.140 --> 55:20.860
I mean, it's just like, eh, whatever, you know?

55:20.860 --> 55:23.140
Or the Penguins of Madagascar game, I mean...

55:23.140 --> 55:25.300
Well, if you're five, you might.

55:25.300 --> 55:26.300
Yeah, okay.

55:26.300 --> 55:27.300
That's really who those games are for.

55:27.300 --> 55:28.700
You might buy this for me on the Wii.

55:28.700 --> 55:29.700
Oh, well, it requires U-Draw.

55:29.700 --> 55:31.420
Well, fuck that, I'm not buying that.

55:31.420 --> 55:32.420
You know, it's...

55:32.420 --> 55:35.900
So I'm not gonna buy a seven-year-old peripheral for your game.

55:35.900 --> 55:43.020
You know what I feel really bad about is Ubisoft with their, what is it, their awesome tablet

55:43.020 --> 55:48.740
or whatever the fuck they called it, the Drawsome tablet, that they came out in December, the

55:48.740 --> 55:51.500
hey, we're gonna get, we're gonna enter in this market, too.

55:51.500 --> 55:53.700
It seems like they're doing well with that U-Draw.

55:53.700 --> 55:55.740
We're gonna put ours out.

55:55.740 --> 55:57.420
Pfft, tanked.

55:57.420 --> 56:01.460
Does that mean we could expect something really awful to come to Ubisoft soon, or do you think

56:01.460 --> 56:02.460
they had enough to keep them above water?

56:02.460 --> 56:05.020
I don't think that they're gonna release anything else for it.

56:05.020 --> 56:07.820
Luckily, they still have Assassin's Creed and enough things to kinda...

56:07.820 --> 56:09.900
Oh, well, they actually do quite a bit.

56:09.900 --> 56:10.900
No, no, I know, I know.

56:10.900 --> 56:14.820
A lot less with kid stuff recently, but they do quite a bit in the...

56:14.820 --> 56:19.700
Didn't Rocksmith do a little better than folks thought for like a really niche thing?

56:19.700 --> 56:22.220
Because, see, I know people on Facebook that are playing it.

56:22.220 --> 56:24.860
I would not have expected to be playing any video games at all.

56:24.860 --> 56:29.540
I think it did okay, um, I mean, it hasn't really been a huge hit.

56:29.540 --> 56:36.820
It did better than, um, was it the Six Strings Rise of, or was it the Rise of the Six Strings

56:36.820 --> 56:37.820
Team?

56:37.820 --> 56:40.820
Oh, yeah, that one kinda disappeared, didn't it?

56:40.820 --> 56:41.820
Yeah.

56:41.820 --> 56:43.900
Yeah, that wasn't very good.

56:43.900 --> 56:44.900
Anyway.

56:44.900 --> 56:47.180
That sounds dreadful.

56:47.180 --> 56:52.500
Well, that's too bad for, um, you know, THQ.

56:52.500 --> 56:55.060
I hope it doesn't impact Saints Row the 4th.

56:55.060 --> 56:57.220
Oh, no, no, it won't.

56:57.220 --> 57:01.420
I'm sure they're gonna do well, I mean, this year, like, kicking off things, they've got

57:01.420 --> 57:03.940
UFC 3, which will do well for them.

57:03.940 --> 57:05.740
That's in a couple weeks.

57:05.740 --> 57:12.660
They're gonna have, um, you know, Darksiders 2 coming, I think, in like May-ish, um, then

57:12.660 --> 57:18.180
of course, you know, they've got the South Park RPG game coming out later this year.

57:18.180 --> 57:19.580
Well, that'll be good, I hope.

57:19.580 --> 57:27.300
There'll be another WWE game, WWE 13, um, I'm sure there's gonna be some other, you

57:27.300 --> 57:34.140
know, big franchises that they're gonna have, um, I don't think Saints Row the 4th would

57:34.140 --> 57:39.340
be coming out any time soon, I would, I would hope not, I mean, I think it's too soon for

57:39.340 --> 57:43.800
something like that, but they're gonna have DLC for the 3rd coming out, and I think that's

57:43.800 --> 57:51.020
sold well for them, but, I don't know, I wouldn't worry about THQ, they're gonna be fine.

57:51.020 --> 57:52.020
Alright.

57:52.020 --> 57:58.520
But I would say, you know, that it, it really sucks that Nintendo didn't, um, embrace the

57:58.520 --> 58:02.580
whole U-Draw tablet, but you kinda see why they didn't, because of the direction that

58:02.580 --> 58:03.580
they went.

58:03.580 --> 58:06.580
Well, now, yeah, now with the Wii U, they, it's, might do their own thing.

58:06.580 --> 58:12.340
Hey, yeah, Nintendo may make a Mario Paint game for the Wii, or for the, uh, that U-Draw

58:12.340 --> 58:16.720
tablet, or they're gonna hold on to it for a little longer and make a Mario Paint game

58:16.720 --> 58:19.100
for the Wii U.

58:19.100 --> 58:20.580
That's probably more like it.

58:20.580 --> 58:27.180
Alright, well, speaking of the Wii U, um, Team Ninja has commented on the Wii U, talking

58:27.180 --> 58:32.460
about it, saying that it's pretty easy to develop for, uh, this is from, uh, an interview

58:32.460 --> 58:36.620
with Nintendo Gamer Magazine, where some of the folks from Team Ninja said that they're

58:36.620 --> 58:41.940
finding it very similar to develop for Wii U as for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, which

58:41.940 --> 58:45.740
is no surprise if what, it's true, what we've heard about the hardware in the past, that

58:45.740 --> 58:50.140
it's very similar to, like, just kind of an over, over-drived Xbox, basically, is what

58:50.140 --> 58:51.900
Nintendo Wii U is supposed to be.

58:51.900 --> 58:57.340
Um, they also said that the Wii U hardware keeps changing, uh, that echo statements that

58:57.340 --> 59:04.700
were made by, uh, Yoshinori Ono from Capcom last week, uh, apparently said something very

59:04.700 --> 59:10.780
similar, that the Wii U keeps changing some of the hardware, um, they're asking these

59:10.780 --> 59:15.220
developers from Team Ninja what they want from the hardware, and for feedback, uh, they

59:15.220 --> 59:19.580
keep listening, making changes and so forth, the hardware keeps changing.

59:19.580 --> 59:22.940
What we don't know is, what is changing about the hardware?

59:22.940 --> 59:28.860
Now, my thought is, I wouldn't take the hardware is changing to mean, suddenly, this system

59:28.860 --> 59:33.540
is not gonna have the tablet or any of that stuff, that's, that's here to stay, like,

59:33.540 --> 59:35.100
that isn't going anywhere, right?

59:35.100 --> 59:39.260
I think they're either, they're too well, they're, they've gone all in on that, so,

59:39.260 --> 59:43.100
after last year's E3, they can't suddenly come out and say, well, we decided to scrap

59:43.100 --> 59:46.740
the tablet, ha ha, you know, right?

59:46.740 --> 59:50.060
They're gonna, they're just changing what's inside, because they don't fucking know, I

59:50.060 --> 59:55.500
mean, it's like, they're like, well, we've got this box that represents, just imagine,

59:55.500 --> 01:00:00.540
if you will, a console that'll do amazing things, imagine it, because we don't have

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:05.060
one yet, it's just this box that's sitting here that's actually, uh, well, it's about

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:09.660
time to commit, because, in a couple months, they're gonna have to show that to the world,

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:15.260
if they want to get that thing out this year, it's gotta be at E3, and it's gotta be good.

01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:18.500
It better be, I'm telling ya.

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:21.780
Although if Team Ninja's developing for, uh, this, that means that, that, you know, where

01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:23.500
the next Dead or Alive game's gonna show up.

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:26.140
No, I think it's Ninja Gaiden, they already said that they're gonna have a Ninja Gaiden

01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:27.140
game for it.

01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:28.140
Oh, that's right, they did.

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:30.020
And it's basically a port of Ninja Gaiden 3, so.

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:33.180
And Team Ninja and Nintendo have a little history, they did, uh, Team Ninja did the

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:36.940
Metroid Other M game, which, you know, although it didn't sell very well, it wasn't a bad

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:38.820
game, by any means, it's pretty neat.

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:39.820
Yeah.

01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:40.820
So.

01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:41.820
Interesting.

01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:42.820
I just...

01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:43.820
What?

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:51.860
I hope they don't fuck it up, I'm just saying, I mean, I, I think I'm, I'm hopeful that it'll

01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:53.820
be a good system, but...

01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:59.060
Just say the HG Mario and HZ Zelda game will be out this Christmas, and it'll, it'll print

01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:00.060
money.

01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:01.060
It will.

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:02.060
Keep your fingers crossed.

01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:05.620
It has to put those key franchises on it, and that's really what's gonna drive the system.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:10.400
And if, if you doubt what I'm saying, 3DS.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:14.740
That thing did not start selling until they put the Zelda remake on it, and it sold a

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:18.300
little bit, and then when they put Mario Kart 7 and 3D Land on it, boom!

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:19.940
Now it's selling tons.

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:20.940
And when they dropped the price.

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:21.940
Oh yeah, that too.

01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:23.940
That had a little bit to do with it.

01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:27.140
That did have a little bit to do with it.

01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:30.540
But well, then the price point is certainly important for the Wii U as well, you know,

01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:36.860
if they get up on stage and say, Wii U is 599 US dollars, 599, no, no, no, no, no,

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:37.860
no, no.

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:38.860
Ridge Racer!

01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:39.860
299.

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:42.020
It, it's gotta be 299, right?

01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:43.660
No higher than 299.

01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:46.860
It can't be 2, or it can't be higher than 299.

01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:47.860
Yeah.

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:48.860
It's...

01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:49.860
I...

01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:50.860
I...

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:51.860
I...

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:52.860
You don't even want it to be 299.

01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:55.220
I don't even see it being 299.

01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:59.180
I mean, I don't know.

01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:00.180
We'll see.

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:04.380
By the time we get there, I mean, the other consoles could be lower in price, I don't

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:05.380
know.

01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:06.380
I'm...

01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:07.380
I'm...

01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:12.260
I'm gonna be sitting back and watching what happens, cause, I don't know.

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:15.660
Why don't they just say the games will only be 40 bucks, as opposed to 60?

01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:17.140
That would go a long way.

01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:19.260
It'll go a very long way.

01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:21.860
Alright, anyhow.

01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:26.540
Brakeman in her chatroom at chat.thatorangelaunchmedia.com says, I hope they change the name from Wii

01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:30.380
2 to something else that would be easier for me to make penis jokes for it.

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:33.380
Well, there was some rumors last week that they are gonna change the name.

01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:39.540
I don't know how much that will, uh, you know, really come to light.

01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:44.820
RDGSinge in our chatroom says, anyway, it's probably three Gamecubes duct taped together.

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:45.820
Alright.

01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:49.300
So, you were curious on, uh, Rocksmith sales?

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:50.300
Yeah.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:58.420
We have 50,000 copies in the US on 360, uh, basically a total of, uh, 610,000 copies.

01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:03.540
That's pretty, for what's essentially a really niche title, I really consider that, that's

01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:04.940
pretty darn good.

01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:05.940
I think.

01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:06.940
Yeah.

01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:07.940
So.

01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:08.940
Alright.

01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:10.940
Anyhow.

01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:11.940
Let's move on.

01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:12.940
DarkSakura.

01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:21.180
Well, in other news, there is a proposition to put a one percent tax on violent video

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:22.180
games.

01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:23.180
I know.

01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:24.180
Stupid.

01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:29.260
Um, this is actually coming from Oklahoma, which, it's Oklahoma.

01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:31.140
Oh, Oklahoma.

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:37.580
Anyway, it was introduced by state representative William Forekiller.

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:38.580
Great name.

01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:44.100
Forekiller, F-O-U-R-K-I-L-L-E-R, that any title that's rated teen, mature, and adult

01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:47.460
only would fall under that spectrum.

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:50.780
That's the game that Team Ninja is making for the Wii U, actually, is Forekiller.

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:51.780
Go figure.

01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:54.300
But you know what else that would include?

01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:59.460
Dance Central 2 and Final Fantasy 13 2.

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:05.300
Oh, because those games are rated T for teen because of, um, what, language and all that

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:06.300
stuff, right?

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:07.300
I guess.

01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:10.540
Um, but he wants to donate- Somebody said Hell in 13 2.

01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:12.380
I was like, oh, no she didn't.

01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:17.020
But the, um, well, what about all the crap they said in 7?

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:19.660
Yeah, Barrett said shit and- Well, anyway-

01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:22.020
Does anyone ever drop the F bomb in a Final Fantasy game?

01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:23.260
Final Fantasy fuck?

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:26.500
Can I finish?

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:27.500
No.

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:35.300
Anyway, half of the revenues that, um, would go to, uh, donate the childhood outdoor education

01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:42.980
revolving fund, um, which is, uh, basically making kids get outside and play.

01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:47.140
And the other half is the bully prevention revolving fund.

01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:54.020
So it's, it's got a good heart behind it.

01:04:54.020 --> 01:05:01.420
But I think that it's- Well, okay, actually, here's a good quote on here.

01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:06.820
From the senior designer of Mass Effect 3, that's Manveer Hare, Air, I guess.

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:10.180
Oklahoma proposes a 1% tax on violent games.

01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:14.820
Can I propose a 1% tax on stupid fucking ideas that are also unconstitutional?

01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:15.820
Yeah.

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:18.260
I mean, this is going to be a losing battle.

01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:19.900
We've already seen this stuff.

01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:24.420
You heard us go off last week on the whole California has to pay the ESA of the Supreme

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:25.420
Court thing.

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:26.660
And I do get what you're saying.

01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:30.340
I think it is like, you know, at the core of it, it's nice that he's trying to do something

01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:31.340
for charity.

01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:32.340
I guess.

01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:35.220
But this just speaks- No one's asking him to do anything for charity.

01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:36.700
Well, yeah, it's that.

01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:42.020
And if you really want to tax violence, put a 1% tax on guns.

01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:44.820
You know, put it on something that's across the board.

01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:48.240
I do have- I have to say this.

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:54.700
To say that guns cause violence is the same thing that says pencils cause bad spelling.

01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:56.960
Then put a 1% tax on pencils.

01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:59.620
But the problem- Put the tax on a gun license.

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:01.120
Okay, fine.

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:04.460
The thing is, at least that's kind of constant.

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:10.860
But to put a 1% tax on a subset of video games strikes me as very odd.

01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:14.100
Would you put a 1% tax on R-rated movies?

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:17.740
Would you put a 1% tax on- Well, no, because we're afraid of the MPAA.

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:22.020
Would you put a tax on 1% books that are not for young adults or children?

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:28.100
Like would you put a 1% tax on the, you know, I don't know, you know, entire fiction section

01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:29.100
of Barnes and Noble?

01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:32.060
We're gonna put a 1% tax on contraceptives.

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:36.860
Would you put a 1% tax on parental advisory labels on CDs?

01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:37.860
I mean, no.

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:40.820
This is all- it's ridiculous in practice.

01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:44.920
It's just- and it's somebody who does- that just speaks- you know, it's a big surprise.

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:47.700
A politician who doesn't get video games.

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:49.260
But it just really speaks to somebody.

01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:52.540
And then, you know, did he try to use that hole for the children?

01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:53.540
It's for the children.

01:06:53.540 --> 01:07:02.180
Yes, pretty much, to combat childhood obesity, to stop bullying, and what I was going to

01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:08.600
say about that is that he's basically trying to do the same thing that all these other

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:13.020
places have done to curtail the sale of these video games by making them more expensive

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:17.320
by putting a tax on it and sugarcoating it with a, oh, but this is gonna do all this

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:18.900
good if this goes by.

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:22.780
He's trying to trick the gullible, which unfortunately most of the public is.

01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:23.780
Sorry.

01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:27.340
And you know those violent video games, they pack on the pounds.

01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:32.220
I'm telling ya, if I'm not, like, you know, killing people in a game, I'm just losing

01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:33.220
weight.

01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:38.220
Because, um, yeah, I don't understand the argument that, you know, putting a tax on

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:44.160
teen-rated and up games is gonna somehow get kids to be slimmer.

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:48.140
Because they're gonna be like, damn, I can afford that game, but I can't pay that 1%

01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:50.140
tax, I better go outside and exercise.

01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:53.820
I think you actually missed what I said about that.

01:07:53.820 --> 01:08:00.220
He said that the proceeds were gonna be in half donated to services that get children

01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:02.260
to go outside and exercise.

01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:08.020
So that's the thing, is it's kinda like, it's indirectly for the children because I'm tying

01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:12.180
this nice little charity and all the money's gonna go to good, but, you know.

01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:16.220
Why don't you tax them, like, 500%, then they can't afford the games and they'll go out

01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:17.220
and exercise.

01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:18.780
And then the charities will get a ton of money.

01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:24.340
I mean, I don't understand, why do we need a program to get people to go outside, I mean,

01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:25.340
is it that bad?

01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:26.980
Why don't parents do their fucking job?

01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:29.100
End of story.

01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:30.100
Parents do your job.

01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:32.220
Your kids are fat, send them outside.

01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:33.220
The end.

01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:35.520
You know what I did when I was bored when I was a kid?

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:36.820
And I had a Nintendo?

01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:38.820
I went and rode my bike.

01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:39.820
Uphill.

01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:40.820
Twice.

01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:41.820
In the snow?

01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:42.820
No.

01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:43.820
We didn't have snow in Alabama, what are you talking about?

01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:45.020
Or even better- In the swamp!

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:46.300
Which is worse than the snow.

01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:47.300
Or even better.

01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:51.540
Like, stop feeding your kids their sugary foods or whatever, you know, get them to go

01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:52.540
outside.

01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:53.540
I mean, come on.

01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:56.460
There's a lot of contributing factors for people getting overweight.

01:08:56.460 --> 01:09:00.420
It's not because you're just playing video games, it's because you're eating like shit

01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:02.180
and you're sitting around doing nothing.

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.180
You know what, kids?

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:07.300
If you want to lose weight, you just need to have more unprotected sex.

01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:09.820
It's exercise.

01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:13.300
Sexercise.

01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:14.300
I'm kidding, use a condom.

01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:15.300
Please use a condom.

01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:20.100
You told children to go have sex, that is so wrong.

01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:21.740
But it's exercise?

01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:26.660
That's for the public school system to tell our kids to go have sex.

01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:28.020
That's where my good money's going.

01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:32.140
Alright, now we need to change the topic, Loki.

01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:33.460
You sure I don't have another topic?

01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:35.460
Dark Soccer's left the room.

01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:40.260
But, but we were just talking about...

01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:47.180
So let's talk a little bit about our favorite topic, at least it has been the last few weeks,

01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:52.500
and that is online passes.

01:09:52.500 --> 01:10:00.060
And I kind of wonder if they don't understand what the online pass thing means, because

01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:05.220
they're putting it on games that don't have online portions to them, they're not putting

01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:09.700
it on games that have online portions to them, they're not locking people out with...

01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:11.220
I just don't understand.

01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:17.820
So first off, SSX, big sports, extreme sports game coming out from EA, it's gonna have an

01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:18.820
online pass.

01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:21.540
Not a big surprise, because they have a big online portion of it.

01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:26.500
What's kind of neat about it though, is that the online pass, if you do not have it, will

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:29.980
not lock people out of playing multiplayer.

01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:36.260
You just won't get any of the in-game credits used to unlock content while playing multiplayer.

01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:37.260
So that's kind of cool.

01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:40.580
You can at least play with your friends still if you have it used.

01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:46.220
Wait, you mean to say that some companies find the value in not having an online pass?

01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:52.060
Well come on, this is the same company that just put an online pass on an offline game.

01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:58.100
And to be fair, that wasn't really an online pass, that was just free DLC that they labeled

01:10:58.100 --> 01:10:59.540
something completely stupid.

01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:06.900
It was like, instead of saying, ooh, free gift, it was like, pay money or get raped.

01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:10.340
It's like, you know, not...

01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:13.100
If you just called it a free gift, it wouldn't have sounded so bad.

01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:14.100
Why'd you call it get raped?

01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:15.820
I mean, that doesn't make any sense.

01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:17.900
Why would you do that?

01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:22.420
So they're doing that for SSX, and so if you don't want to buy the game, or if you rent

01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:26.140
it, you can still play it online, you just won't be able to unlock your little tokens

01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:32.820
or shit for your download content, or unlocking in-game things, big deal.

01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:38.260
However what's kind of weird though is a co-op shooter, Syndicate, also coming out from EA,

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:40.940
is not going to have an online pass at all.

01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:42.820
Just, eh, whatever reason.

01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:49.460
They say we want little resistance or barriers to entry as possible.

01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:53.640
I think a lot of guys say that too.

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:54.640
The co-op...

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:56.400
I had to come back in the room, didn't I?

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.780
The co-op is equal billing in this.

01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:03.060
We wanted everyone who owns a copy of the game to have access to the entire product.

01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:07.460
Well now that's fair, if they recognize that like the core element of their game is the

01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:12.740
online part, you don't fucking gate it behind a pass, right?

01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:20.140
But yet they do, for Battlefield 3, for Madden, for, you know, NBA, well they don't have an

01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:24.380
NBA game, but when they do have another NBA game, probably this year, NBA Jam might have

01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:25.380
one.

01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:29.460
Oh no, because the Xbox 360 and PS3 are already online only.

01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:31.460
Yeah, so...

01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:35.180
And the Wii online, hahaha.

01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:41.860
Need for Speed, I mean, all this shit had these online passes, but I do like the direction

01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:45.740
they're going, and I want to fucking have every time that they have a goddamn online

01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:50.740
pass that EA says, we stand behind this online pass, I want them to fucking quote what they

01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:51.740
said.

01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:56.220
Just as little resistance or barriers to entry as possible, because that's really what you're

01:12:56.220 --> 01:13:00.340
doing is you're telling people, eh, we only want you the player games if you have the

01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:01.340
money to buy it new.

01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:05.260
If not, we don't really give a fuck, we want you to go away, because you cost us too much

01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:07.620
money to run our servers.

01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:08.620
God.

01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:12.500
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:14.780
Yeah, I'll come back.

01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:19.820
There was something I was going to rant about this week, and I just reminded myself.

01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:20.820
Oh goody.

01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:24.860
And I think it was something along the lines of this online pass thing.

01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:27.620
We'll get to that later.

01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:29.900
Alright.

01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:31.940
Is there another story coming up later that's going to prompt that?

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:37.740
I don't think so, but it was something I posted on Twitter, and I had to refresh my memory.

01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:39.540
Just explode on the rant at a random point in the show.

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:44.020
It was something about how used games steal money from developers, I think it was.

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:45.020
Oh yes, so it was.

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.620
Alright, look, well moving on.

01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:53.140
Old games still give money to the folks that own the rights to them these days, and old

01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:57.140
games will suddenly become new again on the 3DS, and the old games are coming from the

01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:58.780
Game Gear.

01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:03.340
That's right, apparently virtual console games for a non-Nintendo platform, of course in

01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:09.220
this case Sega, have shown up for 3DS release by the good old ESRB, who has spoiled the

01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:13.140
releases of Shinobi and Sonic Triple Trouble.

01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:15.100
So those games apparently have been spotted.

01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:19.820
To be fair, the ESRB, remember that one of the things that they could do, that the publishers

01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:23.740
could tell them not to list their stuff on there, so it's the fucking publisher's fault.

01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:27.260
Yeah, they might have forgot to check that box in the forum, who knows.

01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:32.140
Now it's worth noting that at some point TurboGrafx-16 games were supposed to be available on the

01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:36.080
3DS, but who knows if that's really going to happen anymore at some point because there's

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:37.080
no more Hudson.

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:43.580
Well, doesn't Konami inherently own all their old licenses, or am I wrong?

01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:44.580
Couldn't Konami?

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:45.580
I think they do, yeah.

01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:46.580
I think they could.

01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:47.580
I think they do, so I don't know.

01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:52.300
But anyhow, yeah, so Game Gear games are on their way to the 3DS, but let's be real, Dark

01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:55.380
Soccer is going to bitch slap me for this, but were there really any that good Game Gear

01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:56.380
games?

01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:57.380
Yes!

01:14:57.380 --> 01:14:58.380
What?

01:14:58.380 --> 01:14:59.380
Gunstar Heroes.

01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:03.660
Was that really a Game Gear game?

01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:05.980
I bought it for Dan for 30 bucks.

01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:06.980
Oh, that's right.

01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:07.980
I remember that.

01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:09.460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:12.820
There were really good, I think there was Puyo Puyo.

01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:15.260
There was Sonic Spinball.

01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:18.460
The Lion King game, of all things, was actually really good on Game Gear.

01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:22.380
So yeah, there were a lot of really good games.

01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:27.180
The Disney games on Genesis and all that stuff were, like Aladdin and shit, were like really

01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:28.180
good.

01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:32.460
It was like an interesting phase where like Sega and Disney just kind of had this really

01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:34.060
great harmony going on.

01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:37.580
And if I do recall correctly, I think there were a number of Master System games that

01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:40.420
were converted for Game Gear use, so.

01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:44.580
All I remember were that those things were so fucking huge and just drained your batteries.

01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:47.620
But now, you know, the 3DS will drain your battery.

01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:49.260
It'll be about as fast.

01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:53.980
But at least you can recharge your 3DS without having to go buy AA batteries.

01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:57.700
So Dark Sakura is going to read us a story and then we're going to get to the release

01:15:57.700 --> 01:15:58.900
dates.

01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:04.300
Once upon a time, there was a game called Skyrim, and everyone was like, oh my god,

01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:10.780
the menu sucks, so people hacked it and put out little ads for it on PC.

01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:16.820
Well, finally, the people at Bethesda were like, I guess people really don't like how

01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:19.700
we do this and want different stuff for the game.

01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:25.100
So there is a PC creation kit coming out for The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim, and it will be

01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:28.860
on Steam on Tuesday.

01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:37.100
And it's, uh, you can apparently just download it in the tools tab.

01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:39.960
So I guess people will be happy for it.

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:43.700
I'm slowly starting to regret not getting Skyrim on the PC.

01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:46.580
I wish a lot of these cool things would come to like the PlayStation 3.

01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:48.180
I thought some of it was supposed to.

01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:50.220
I could be wrong, though.

01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:53.580
But like, I've looked like Alan is he's in there playing Skyrim right now.

01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:57.300
He's hacked the shit out of that game, like, you know, well, I mean, like, he's still playing

01:16:57.300 --> 01:16:58.300
by the rules.

01:16:58.300 --> 01:16:59.300
Mostly.

01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:00.300
I don't think he's really cheated a lot.

01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:03.820
But, you know, like his interface doesn't even look right to me.

01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:06.220
Like it's all but it's it's really well organized.

01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:07.220
I like it.

01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:09.420
It's just like he's just done so many hacks to it.

01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:12.740
How many of us have wow that look exactly like it did when we first got it?

01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:13.740
That's true.

01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:14.740
That's true.

01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:15.740
But that is something that Blizzard embraces.

01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:19.300
And that's part of why it's better than a lot of MMOs, by the way.

01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:23.300
But anyway, let's travel around the world and look at release dates and talk about games

01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:25.900
that you'll be able to hack soon in a store near you.

01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:28.060
Loki, we'll start with the U.S. dates.

01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:34.600
There's actually some stuff this week, not really a game, but Connect for Windows came

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:35.600
out this week.

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:37.600
So that's neat.

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:43.900
OK, so next week we've got some stuff re-released at Fallout New Vegas, the Ultimate Edition

01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:45.520
with all the DLC included.

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:51.580
They have that coming out on all three systems, PS3, 360, and the PC.

01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:56.740
The Darkness 2 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC as well.

01:17:56.740 --> 01:18:01.740
The Jak and Daxter Collection for PS3 will be coming out.

01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:09.820
Resident Evil Revelations with an extra I, at least on the packaging.

01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:14.140
And that's coming out on 3DS only.

01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:21.460
Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:28.020
We also have the Zumba Fitness Rush on Xbox 360.

01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:31.380
That'll be out on Sunday.

01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:35.260
And uh, yeah.

01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:36.260
That's it.

01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:43.620
Oh, oh, and as I remember, remind you, the 3DS Circle Pad Pro will be out in GameStop.

01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:45.620
Yay.

01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:48.520
Irritated.

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:54.540
Is there any chance if I wait it out it'll come to another retailer?

01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:59.360
I guess there's nothing I need it for right now, so I'm just gonna hold my breath.

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:02.140
Let's go to Japan and take a look at what's coming out over in Japan.

01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:04.360
Xbox 360's looking a little dry this week.

01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:08.520
Just a game getting a price reduction, that's Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition.

01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:11.300
It's a price reduction this week on the 9th.

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:15.860
Heading on over to the PlayStation 3 and checking out what's coming there.

01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:20.860
Same thing, price reduction there, but there's also a game from Atlus called The Cursed Crusade

01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:22.740
comes out from Atlus this week.

01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:23.740
The Cursed Crusade?

01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:24.740
The Cursed Crusade.

01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:26.020
I could see it.

01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:27.020
Cursehead though.

01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:31.580
Um, I'm trying to see what- That hasn't come out over there yet?

01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:32.580
No, I guess not.

01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:33.580
I'm surprised.

01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:35.180
It came out over here back in October.

01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:36.180
I don't think it's a price reduction.

01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:37.740
No, it's definitely not a price reduction.

01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:41.060
It might be like a localized version for them.

01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:42.660
So, interesting.

01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:46.100
Uh, so yeah, that's coming out this week.

01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:50.340
Well, sometimes they get the games a little later than we do, you know?

01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:55.940
Uh, remember the PlayStation Vita Vita Vegemans already out in Japan, so they have some new

01:19:55.940 --> 01:19:56.940
games this week.

01:19:56.940 --> 01:20:02.100
Gravity Days comes out this week, and Sumioni, I think I'm saying that right, comes out this

01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:03.100
week on the Vita.

01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:07.780
Um, I'm trying to see if this is a game- I'm trying to see if this looks familiar to me.

01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:12.900
I'm looking at a little trailer for Sumiomi here in the studio to see if it's one that

01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:14.900
I recognized.

01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:17.980
I like the art style in this game.

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:22.060
Uh, I've seen the, uh- It looks a little bit like Okami.

01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:24.580
Oh, it's an ink game.

01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:27.060
Sumie is a type of drawing with ink.

01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:28.180
It looks like the background there.

01:20:28.180 --> 01:20:30.860
I saw this when they were talking about, uh, Vita stuff.

01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:32.980
I actually saw the video for it.

01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:35.620
I don't remember what's being called over here though.

01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:39.820
But that game is coming out this week in Japan, because, you know, they already have the Vita

01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:41.340
over there.

01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:46.580
Uh, looking at the other handheld real quick, I'm just gonna look really quickly at the

01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:48.900
Wii, see if there's anything worth mentioning, no.

01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:51.560
Um, how about the 3DS though?

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:52.560
Not really.

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:53.560
Nothing until the 14th.

01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:57.820
Nude Love Plus comes out on the 14th, with plenty of art book limited editions if you

01:20:57.820 --> 01:20:58.820
want to check that out.

01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:00.500
I thought for a second there you said Nude Love Plus.

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:01.500
I was like- No.

01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:03.220
Oh no, that would be a whole different- Well played!

01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:05.900
That would be a whole different 3DS game right there.

01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:07.860
Alright, that does it for Japanese releases.

01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:08.860
Dark Sakura?

01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:13.820
On this, um, in the UK on the 7th we have Combat Wings The Great Battles of World War

01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:18.260
II, Gotham City Impostors- Sorry.

01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:21.620
House of the Dead 3 and The Simpsons Arcade for PS3.

01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:26.200
On the 8th of February we have more Gotham City crap.

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:28.280
On the 9th we have Cell Emergence.

01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:34.420
On the 10th, Catherine for Xbox 360 and PS3, that game is messed up.

01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:40.380
EA Sports Grand Slam Tennis 2, Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning, uh, Mario and Sonic at the

01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:46.540
London Olympic Games on 3DS, One Piece Unlimited Cruise Special, and The Darkness 2.

01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:48.060
That's it.

01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:52.700
Alrighty, just a couple more stories for you guys, then we're gonna get to the classic

01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:54.880
game of the week, but first-

01:21:54.880 --> 01:22:03.140
So, there's some talk saying, you know, Iwata is actually interested in doing some, you

01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:05.820
know, microtransactions with the Wii U.

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:13.820
One of the pieces of technology that they may be incorporating for the Wii U is near-field

01:22:13.820 --> 01:22:20.460
communication, which will allow you to, for example, read credit cards if, you know, those

01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:24.440
have like, you know, the pay pass thing, I don't remember what they call them.

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:28.500
I think it's pay pass, it's basically that kind of communication where you touch the

01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:33.140
credit card up to the machine and away you go.

01:22:33.140 --> 01:22:38.500
Or you know, like, Skylanders sort of has that, so, but they're saying that, you know,

01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:44.620
it can provide a system in which consumers can use e-money, they'll find it much more

01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:51.380
easily be able to make payments by then entering credit card numbers or by purchasing Nintendo

01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:56.540
prepaid cards at the store.

01:22:56.540 --> 01:23:01.340
You know, of course, they're, you know, trying to support DLC, but they want to do it in

01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:05.660
a way that's not, you know, crazy.

01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:14.380
Also, they're throwing out the idea that, you know, maybe, maybe Super Mario Land 3D

01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:21.220
or Mario Kart may get DLC, which I would be happy with that, I think they should do that.

01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:27.500
You know, what if we could provide add-on content through the network, posing the question

01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:28.500
there.

01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:33.180
As I referred to before, for example, like everyone else does, yeah, this idea of supplying

01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:37.740
new stages as Super Mario users who want to play the game more, but have completed the

01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:43.760
game and lost interest in existing state or in the, you know, existing stages, this will

01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:49.980
not only give us new profits, but then lengthen the life of the product and that it will never

01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:55.420
appear to be out of fashion and can keep attracting public attention as long as many people play

01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:56.420
it.

01:23:56.420 --> 01:23:57.420
No shit!

01:23:57.420 --> 01:24:00.420
People have been doing this for fucking years now, and you just figured this out?

01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:02.420
Oh my God.

01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:03.420
That's fantastic.

01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:07.300
Yeah, I can't wait to see what breakthrough ideas will come with the Wii U.

01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:11.860
Hey, hey guys, we're gonna have this, we're gonna have this thing called online.

01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:16.620
People can play without being in the same room.

01:24:16.620 --> 01:24:22.580
You have to admit, as behind the times as Nintendo is, there is almost that benefit

01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:27.180
to them being behind the times that you don't have this online pass garbage on any of the

01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:28.180
Nintendo games.

01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:29.180
Yes you do.

01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:30.180
Do you?

01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:31.180
Yes you do.

01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:32.180
Which game?

01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:33.180
What?

01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:34.180
You have the U-Pass that's on the...

01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:35.180
God, really?

01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:42.300
And the online passes do apply to the Wii games for Madden, for example, has online

01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:46.780
pass, I believe, and it's just a lot of those corgis.

01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:48.780
Well then I stand corrected.

01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:54.860
Yeah, unfortunately they do have that stuff, they are not exempt from it.

01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:58.020
It's just that there's not a lot of big games that come out, so that's why you don't hear

01:24:58.020 --> 01:24:59.020
a lot of it.

01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:05.780
But yeah, I mean, come on, they do these really amazing things sometimes, like the 3D is kind

01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:09.700
of cool, you know, the motion controls and stuff like that, and at the same time, say

01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:14.400
hey we got this one cool thing, oh but we forgot to like totally update everything else.

01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:16.940
It's just like, oh shit you guys want HD graphics?

01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:17.940
Well we didn't fucking do that.

01:25:17.940 --> 01:25:18.940
Oh, online?

01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:19.940
Nah.

01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:20.940
But hey, you got motion controls?

01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:21.940
I mean, isn't that what you wanted?

01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:22.940
Something new?

01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:25.100
Hey, 3D, it's got 3D, that's awesome.

01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:26.100
DLC?

01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:28.060
Ah fuck, well we just didn't do DLC yet.

01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:31.980
We're gonna patch it in later, I'm sure, you know, we will eventually, and we'll support

01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:32.980
it someday.

01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:39.660
You know, maybe, yeah, we'll put out another system or something, I'll have DLC in there.

01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:47.460
Let me rephrase the point I made earlier, since Loki owned me.

01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:52.700
Because most of the stuff worth buying on the Wii is from Nintendo themselves, and Nintendo's

01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:56.460
buying the times, we don't have any of this online pass garbage.

01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:57.460
Exactly.

01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:59.660
Okay, at least we can agree on that.

01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:05.020
Alright, well, congrats to Nintendo for getting on the DLC train, I guess, I just hope they

01:26:05.020 --> 01:26:06.860
don't go overboard with all this.

01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:10.660
Now we know how to charge people, yay.

01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:17.900
Alright, sometimes your money just goes to these very interesting places where you just

01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:21.660
wish you'd never spent it in the first place, and I think that's what a lot of Mass Effect

01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:22.940
fans are feeling this week.

01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:25.300
No, I'm not talking about the game, don't worry.

01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:27.700
But I am talking about the spinoff book series.

01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:31.580
A book came out this, I guess, I don't know if it was last week or about a month ago,

01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:33.860
called Mass Effect Deception.

01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:38.140
And apparently the book has just got tons and tons of errors.

01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:45.180
And I'm talking like the type that, if you're a lore nerd, are just like terribly bad errors.

01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:51.060
For example, oh, actually they have put together a document, I guess, online on Google, that's

01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:58.740
a pretty neat community idea, that has 80 errors in the book, all together.

01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:04.860
I'm trying to actually pull this up right now and see if, they talk about like the Citadel

01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:07.340
is the wrong state.

01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:12.260
One of the characters kills an alien by slicing into the back of its neck and severing the

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:17.300
spine, but you can't really do that with this type of alien because they're not biologically

01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:18.300
set up that way.

01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:22.900
So it's like, it's almost like, you know how like when Star Trek kind of gets the canon

01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:24.860
wrong and the fans are up in arms?

01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:27.340
Like the whole series of Enterprise?

01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:34.980
So like 80 different errors they've all put together and stuff and yeah, timeline errors

01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:35.980
and things like that.

01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:41.620
So apparently it's gotten to the point where BioWare actually came out and said, the teams

01:27:41.620 --> 01:27:46.220
at Delray and BioWare would like to extend our sincerest apologies to the Mass Effect

01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:51.940
fans for any errors and oversights made in the recent novel, Mass Effect Deception.

01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:56.380
We are currently working on a number of changes that will appear in future editions of the

01:27:56.380 --> 01:27:57.780
novel.

01:27:57.780 --> 01:28:03.340
I don't know how that, so in other words, they're going to, it was all a dream or, you

01:28:03.340 --> 01:28:05.260
know, alternate timeline.

01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:06.980
That whole book was an alternate universe.

01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:07.980
Surprise.

01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:11.780
This is what happens when you write books like you write games.

01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:15.240
Can't fucking patch a book.

01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:16.700
You cannot patch a book.

01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:23.020
Oh, you can, apparently you just, you know, print it later, but, oh yeah, that's not everything.

01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:26.900
Like, hey the Wii, can't patch anything, so we better get it right the first time.

01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:30.980
Or we'll have to put out, no, because remember what they had to do for the Zelda save games?

01:28:30.980 --> 01:28:36.060
They had to put out the Zelda save game patching channel.

01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:41.780
You have to admit that's kind of funny.

01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:42.780
Kind of funny.

01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:44.660
That's kind of terrible.

01:28:44.660 --> 01:28:47.020
Always a hoot and a holler here on the show.

01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:52.020
The classic game of the Wii.

01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:55.420
Mark Sacker likes to dive into the classic gaming vault every week and pull out a game

01:28:55.420 --> 01:29:00.180
that she thinks, hey, back in my day, you didn't have patches.

01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:02.820
You took your games glitchy and you liked it.

01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:03.820
Yeah.

01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:07.620
And if they were glitchy, they were collector's items.

01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:09.020
Exactly.

01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:11.500
So here it is, the classic game of the Wii.

01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:12.500
Is it a glitchy title?

01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:13.500
Not really.

01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:14.500
But it's full of bugs, right?

01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:15.500
Full of viruses.

01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:18.500
Alright, what's the classic game of the Wii?

01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:19.500
Dr. Mario.

01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:23.700
It's been a while since I've done a puzzle game, I think, so I had to do Dr. Mario.

01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:25.940
And stupid me didn't link the YouTube.

01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:26.940
Fail.

01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:27.940
It's alright.

01:29:27.940 --> 01:29:28.940
Haha.

01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:33.780
We'll play the QT music and I'll bring in the Dr. Mario music when I can.

01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:34.780
Well, Dr. Mario.

01:29:34.780 --> 01:29:35.780
I need a patch.

01:29:35.780 --> 01:29:38.060
Dr. Mario came out in 1990.

01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:42.740
It was designed by Gunpei Yokoi and it was produced by Takahiro Harada.

01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:47.540
It came out on the Nintendo Entertainment System and it was super fun.

01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:51.180
You got to play as Mario who became a doctor.

01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:52.180
Plumber to doctor.

01:29:52.180 --> 01:29:53.180
Go fig.

01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:59.180
And his point is to eradicate really, really deadly viruses that look like ugly mofos.

01:29:59.180 --> 01:30:03.900
One of them looks like a really retarded rabbit, too.

01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:08.700
So it's basically a falling block style game, kind of like how Tetris did.

01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:14.220
And you line up the colors matching the corresponding colors of the viruses.

01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:19.580
And when you stack three of the same color on top of the virus, then it destroys the

01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:20.740
virus.

01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:21.860
And you keep going.

01:30:21.860 --> 01:30:23.940
And oh my god, I was good at this game.

01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:25.540
I mean, really good at this game.

01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:26.540
I'm not kidding.

01:30:26.540 --> 01:30:31.580
I would, like, you had a max level of 20 that you could select and then you could just keep

01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:32.780
going from there.

01:30:32.780 --> 01:30:37.260
And I could go, like, into the, I was really good at it.

01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:38.260
Anyway.

01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:39.580
And so humble, too.

01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:44.380
I'm not gonna, the game's kind of hard not to be good at, you know?

01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:47.700
I mean, unless you just have really awful reflexes.

01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:53.940
Anyway, there are all kinds of other versions, different ports and things that have come

01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:55.460
out, too.

01:30:55.460 --> 01:31:00.580
It was re-released on the Game Boy Advance as part of the classic NES series.

01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:07.180
And there were versions of it that was, there's a minigame in WarioWare Inc., Mega Microgames,

01:31:07.180 --> 01:31:11.900
and Brain Age 2, more training and minutes a day.

01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:17.460
But let's see what else that we have with this, because you also have, your playfield

01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:19.020
is a bottle.

01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:21.340
And so he's throwing it into a bottle.

01:31:21.340 --> 01:31:23.780
And you've got as much space as your bottle allows.

01:31:23.780 --> 01:31:29.180
And honestly, on screen, it's fairly small, especially man on the 13-inch TV that I played

01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:30.180
on.

01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:32.540
Can't go blind playing that thing.

01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:37.060
So let's hear about some of the people that probably had problems that this game was pushing

01:31:37.060 --> 01:31:39.020
pills to kids.

01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:44.020
Because I'm sure I've heard that story somewhere before.

01:31:44.020 --> 01:31:49.460
I know you might not have it in front of you, but I know some fucking old ladies club probably

01:31:49.460 --> 01:31:50.460
complained.

01:31:50.460 --> 01:31:53.740
And Dr. Mario teaches my kids about drugs!

01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:56.060
You see how many drugs old people pop?

01:31:56.060 --> 01:31:57.060
Hello?

01:31:57.060 --> 01:32:03.860
Anyway, it also did have a multiplayer mode where two players could compete against each

01:32:03.860 --> 01:32:06.900
other to clean their different fields out.

01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:10.340
And basically you just had to get rid of your viruses before they got rid of theirs, but

01:32:10.340 --> 01:32:14.900
it had more capsules fall on the opposing side.

01:32:14.900 --> 01:32:18.900
My little sister and I would play that hours on end.

01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:23.540
There was, of course, it was done by Yokoi, who was the guy that gave us the Game Boy

01:32:23.540 --> 01:32:26.020
and the Game & Watch.

01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:33.660
And Takahiro Harada, who was the producer, was the producer on Metroid.

01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:38.380
And a lot of the music actually that ended up, some of the music that ended up in Super

01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:46.020
Smash Bros. Brawl, was the guy that did that actually became one of the presence of Creatures

01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:52.020
Inc., which owned a third of the copyright regarding Pokemon, just to show that little

01:32:52.020 --> 01:32:53.020
correlation.

01:32:53.020 --> 01:32:56.500
Were you gonna say something?

01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:59.800
Gotta eradicate them all.

01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:02.100
There were lots of different versions and ports.

01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:06.900
There was a Nintendo versus system that brought out versus Dr. Mario.

01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:09.100
So there was an arcade version.

01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:14.180
And like I said, there was a GBA version in 2004 that was part of the classic NES series.

01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:17.100
Or in Japan it was called the Famicom miniseries.

01:33:17.100 --> 01:33:22.540
And then there was a version in Puzzle League in 2005, it was Dr. Mario in Puzzle League.

01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:31.660
2003 there was the release of a Nintendo GameCube preview disc that had, you could download

01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:33.980
the NES version of Dr. Mario to your Game Boy Advance console.

01:33:33.980 --> 01:33:35.300
That was pretty cool.

01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:38.940
You see that little cable deal that came out?

01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:43.660
There was an enhanced version that came with Tetris on the Super Nintendo, that was Tetris

01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:46.540
and Dr. Mario, that came out on December 30th, 1994.

01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:51.420
Why not bring it out before then, you know, Christmas, blah.

01:33:51.420 --> 01:33:59.820
It was also re-released in Japan on March 30th, 1997, and was downloadable for the Satellaview.

01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:02.540
It was called Dr. Mario BS Version.

01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:06.220
Because the Satellaview is the BS Satellaview.

01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:08.860
Can I play some music for one of the other versions here?

01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:09.860
Sure.

01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:22.620
We're going to go to the Mario 64 version here.

01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:25.260
Same song but a little souped up.

01:34:25.260 --> 01:34:26.260
Yep.

01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:33.620
But yeah, it was also downloadable for the Nintendo Power Cartridges in Super Famicom

01:34:33.620 --> 01:34:35.620
and Game Boy.

01:34:35.620 --> 01:34:42.620
And then it's on the 21st anniversary of its release in 2011, the original Game Boy version

01:34:42.620 --> 01:34:48.820
was made available for the 3DS to download.

01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:55.260
Basically parents, this is what you were talking about, they said that there was a parent,

01:34:55.260 --> 01:35:03.260
parents had issues about the inclusion of medicine, and there was a review by Ace that

01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:10.700
gave it a 510 out of 1000 points because it said it reeked of plagiarism and that it was

01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:13.340
worse than the games it was modeled after.

01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:15.180
Which is pretty stupid to me.

01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:16.180
What?

01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:17.180
I know.

01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:20.300
I wonder, you know, I'm going to actually check Ace real quick and see if they still

01:35:20.300 --> 01:35:21.300
exist.

01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:25.700
Ace Games magazine, nope, they were applied by EMAP.

01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:29.060
Oh my god, I remember this magazine now.

01:35:29.060 --> 01:35:32.620
The Amiga format and ST titles, oh wow.

01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:35.460
So yeah, anyway, keep going.

01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:39.500
There were, it was really just a good game.

01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:47.540
A lot of people really loved it, you know, it was very simple graphically but it got,

01:35:47.540 --> 01:35:48.540
it made its point.

01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:52.580
It was fun and simple to play and that's the point of the game.

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:56.380
It was enough challenging to keep you playing it because I would play this game for hours,

01:35:56.380 --> 01:35:58.500
I can tell you that.

01:35:58.500 --> 01:36:03.020
But yeah, like you said, there were other follow ups.

01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:08.060
There was Dr. Mario 64, like we're listening to right now, that had other game modes too

01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:15.260
and other characters including Wario, because at the time Wario Land 3 was out.

01:36:15.260 --> 01:36:19.620
And it came out in Japan under the Nintendo Puzzle Collection.

01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:23.780
But Wario wasn't a doctor, he was just a nurse practitioner.

01:36:23.780 --> 01:36:31.740
Dr. Mario Online RX, which I guess for prescription, came out in 2008 on the Wii so you could play

01:36:31.740 --> 01:36:34.580
online versus the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.

01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:38.100
So I do want to say to AlphaKananagram in our chatroom at chat.orangeslantreo.com who says

01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:42.780
Nintendo release Dr. Mario 3DS online, put it on the Nintendo network.

01:36:42.780 --> 01:36:44.380
There is the Wii one.

01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:47.940
I mean, granted, you might be specifically wanting a handheld, but there is an online

01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:49.100
version available.

01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:53.060
And then there was Dr. Mario Express that came out in 2009 for the DSi.

01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:54.500
Not multiplayer.

01:36:54.500 --> 01:36:55.500
Boo.

01:36:55.500 --> 01:37:04.900
Dr. Mario is a secret character in Smash Brothers Melee and they actually had an attack based

01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:09.220
on it in Brawl and it had the chill music from the game.

01:37:09.220 --> 01:37:14.860
So I mean, there's lots of cool stuff and actually that music was arranged by the guy

01:37:14.860 --> 01:37:17.620
that did music for Magical Drop.

01:37:17.620 --> 01:37:23.260
There's all kinds of neat little crossovers there, don't you think?

01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:25.260
So that's it.

01:37:25.260 --> 01:37:26.260
Alright.

01:37:26.260 --> 01:37:27.260
Dr. Mario.

01:37:27.260 --> 01:37:30.360
There it is, your classic game of the week, Dr. Mario.

01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:35.300
For the NES, really, but available on pretty much every Nintendo system since then.

01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:36.300
In one way or another.

01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:38.860
Including the Game Boy, I saw one there on YouTube.

01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:41.180
I think I owned it on Game Boy, actually.

01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:43.780
I don't think I owned it on NES, I owned it on Game Boy.

01:37:43.780 --> 01:37:46.140
I want to play the Satellaview version.

01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:48.140
The BS one?

01:37:48.140 --> 01:37:49.140
No.

01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:51.580
The BS, yeah.

01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:58.660
But we've actually got like a Satellaview ROM of the Zelda game.

01:37:58.660 --> 01:38:00.340
It's really good.

01:38:00.340 --> 01:38:03.820
So I can imagine what the Dr. Mario one looks like.

01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:04.820
Alright.

01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:08.100
Well, that's going to do it for part A of our show tonight, but we're not done yet,

01:38:08.100 --> 01:38:09.100
guys.

01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:10.100
We've got plenty more to come.

01:38:10.100 --> 01:38:13.060
We're going to talk about some other things when we get back from a quick break here,

01:38:13.060 --> 01:38:19.420
including some Xbox-related announcements and news, Sony possibly in trouble, according

01:38:19.420 --> 01:38:20.420
to somebody.

01:38:20.420 --> 01:38:21.420
So we'll talk a little bit about that.

01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:26.580
And then, of course, your Twitter topics at twitter.com slash O-L-R, and your emails at

01:38:26.580 --> 01:38:31.300
mailbag at orangelandtrader.com, and, because it is a show where every gamer has a voice,

01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:36.380
there's many ways to contact us, the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on

01:38:36.380 --> 01:38:40.580
Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, we will be taking all of those calls a little later on, right

01:38:40.580 --> 01:38:42.100
after a quick break.

01:38:42.100 --> 01:38:43.100
So stay tuned, guys.

01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:50.100
We'll be right back.

01:38:50.100 --> 01:38:56.540
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live with episode number 444 on this

01:38:56.540 --> 01:38:58.820
February the 5th of 2012.

01:38:58.820 --> 01:39:03.380
You know, there's this football game going on, and Loki was mentioning that he was watching,

01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:08.760
he's catching up now on the good stuff, the commercials, and he just said, what, the Battleship

01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:11.260
movie might not be so bad, from what you're looking at?

01:39:11.260 --> 01:39:15.060
No, it's gonna be terrible, but it's just one of those movies that you don't really,

01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:18.500
I mean, come on, it's a movie based on Battle...

01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:23.980
In name, pretty much only, and there's ships in it, I mean, that's the only way it's even

01:39:23.980 --> 01:39:24.980
remotely related to the Fortnite.

01:39:24.980 --> 01:39:25.980
Who's in that?

01:39:25.980 --> 01:39:26.980
Liam Neeson?

01:39:26.980 --> 01:39:27.980
Liam Neeson.

01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:28.980
I just really want to...

01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:29.980
He dies, though, unfortunately.

01:39:29.980 --> 01:39:30.980
Way to ruin it!

01:39:30.980 --> 01:39:31.980
Way to ruin it!

01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:34.860
He's in the trailer, you can fucking tell that he dies, I mean, come on.

01:39:34.860 --> 01:39:37.660
He better not die, if he doesn't fucking die, then that's great.

01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:43.940
I really want that clip of Liam Neeson that's like, E5!

01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:46.500
You sunk my Battleship!

01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:50.660
It just looks ridiculous, it's just like, it could be Transformers 4 or whatever, I

01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:55.180
mean, it's just pretty much, I don't know, I'm down with it, cause I mean, come on, look

01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:59.620
back at like, Independence Day, how fucking cheesy was that movie, I mean, it was so cheesy.

01:39:59.620 --> 01:40:01.540
I did see Snakes on a Plane.

01:40:01.540 --> 01:40:02.540
Yeah?

01:40:02.540 --> 01:40:06.340
In the theater at Disneyland.

01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:08.300
Did they get the motherfucking snakes off the motherfucking plane?

01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:16.060
It was me, Kristen, and Megsy, wearing giant plushy snakes wrapped around us in the movie

01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:17.060
theater.

01:40:17.060 --> 01:40:20.700
You dressed up to go see Snakes on a Plane!

01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:25.420
We got the snakes at the, um, Jungle Trader.

01:40:25.420 --> 01:40:29.660
We did something similar, we watched it at our work, they had a movie screening in our

01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:35.340
theater, we had rubber snakes that we were throwing during the movie, that was kind of

01:40:35.340 --> 01:40:36.340
fun.

01:40:36.340 --> 01:40:38.340
But yeah, the Avengers trailer's awesome.

01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:43.740
I have had it with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane!

01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:45.540
Everybody strap in!

01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:49.140
I'm about to open some fucking windows.

01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:50.140
That was a cool scene.

01:40:50.140 --> 01:40:51.140
I love Samuel L. Jackson.

01:40:51.140 --> 01:40:55.940
I like when the giant snake ate that one dude.

01:40:55.940 --> 01:41:00.860
And I gotta admit though, it would be, I would be all for them making a sequel where it takes

01:41:00.860 --> 01:41:05.860
place on a space shuttle with Samuel L. Jackson and Snakes on a Shuttle.

01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:10.900
Well you know that someone tried to do a knockoff called Snakes on a Train.

01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:12.700
Yeah, yeah, that's the directed video.

01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:22.620
Asylum does fucking transmorphers and shit with like, how can we get in one of these

01:41:22.620 --> 01:41:24.860
movies, dammit?

01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:30.580
Don't they have a need for witty radio trio to be eaten alive by snakes or something?

01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:36.820
They make so many stupid movies, and the thing is they do it intentional now.

01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:40.980
I mean, I don't know if they do it intentional as far as like, they buy the properties for

01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:44.780
these, and then they put them on like sci-fi channel, or they purposely make them that

01:41:44.780 --> 01:41:46.280
bad.

01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:51.060
I don't know if, it's hard to tell like, are you doing this on purpose, or do you really

01:41:51.060 --> 01:41:52.060
just suck that much?

01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:54.060
You know, that's just, I don't know.

01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:57.860
Alright, well before we get into the rapid fire news tonight, Dark Soccer, you mentioned

01:41:57.860 --> 01:41:59.180
you wanted to plug something real quick.

01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:00.740
Yes, I do.

01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:07.500
One of our fantabulous listeners, Ikuma JP, made an app for the iPhone, and I want to

01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:08.860
share it with everybody.

01:42:08.860 --> 01:42:11.480
It's called My Secret Garden.

01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:17.980
It's really beautiful, and it's free, so go get it.

01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:19.180
Rob says he likes free.

01:42:19.180 --> 01:42:25.980
I didn't give Rob enough time, so, but it's more than gorgeous moving pictures.

01:42:25.980 --> 01:42:26.980
It's beautiful.

01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:30.060
It has nothing to do with the My Secret Garden, like, book series.

01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:32.820
No, that wasn't a series, it was one book by the same-

01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:36.020
Well, there was too many fucking books, or, I'm sorry, there's too many fucking movies

01:42:36.020 --> 01:42:37.620
based on that book.

01:42:37.620 --> 01:42:40.800
There was the same lady that wrote A Little Princess.

01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:43.100
The more you know- Hey, I've read them both, I love those books.

01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:46.780
But the most beautiful part of that sentence was free, so there you go.

01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:47.780
Alright.

01:42:47.780 --> 01:42:49.740
I read that one of our listeners made it.

01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:51.540
Of course, of course.

01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:55.020
So we demand he gets a top 100 ranking immediately.

01:42:55.020 --> 01:42:59.860
Alright, let's move on to some rapid-fire news, Loki.

01:42:59.860 --> 01:43:06.020
Yes, let's talk a little bit about movies, I mean, we were just talking about movies,

01:43:06.020 --> 01:43:10.740
but Ace Attorney, a movie I'm sure a lot of people might be interested in checking out,

01:43:10.740 --> 01:43:14.220
is actually going to be localized for worldwide release.

01:43:14.220 --> 01:43:17.820
I'm sure that's going to be a very limited release, but hey, you'll eventually get it

01:43:17.820 --> 01:43:20.740
on DVD and Blu-Ray soon, you know, so.

01:43:20.740 --> 01:43:29.420
As long as Samuel L. Jackson is in it saying, OBJECTION!

01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:30.420
He should be the judge.

01:43:30.420 --> 01:43:34.380
Get these motherfucking ejections out of my motherfucking courtroom.

01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:36.980
Jackson is in the courtroom.

01:43:36.980 --> 01:43:38.460
SUSTAIN MOTHERFUCKER!

01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:43.300
You can put him really in anything, you know.

01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:45.700
Samuel L. Jackson really could just be in anything.

01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:48.940
Stance is sitting on the toilet the movie.

01:43:48.940 --> 01:43:53.900
That'll be the movie we get offered to do.

01:43:53.900 --> 01:43:55.580
Alright, sorry.

01:43:55.580 --> 01:44:02.220
So and then they're doing a Humble Bundle for Android, which is kind of unique, mainly

01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:06.780
it's been PC, but now you're going to be able to get a few games.

01:44:06.780 --> 01:44:15.420
The new Humble Bundle for Android offers Android versions of Anomaly, Warzone, Earth, Osmose,

01:44:15.420 --> 01:44:22.900
and Edge, with a bonus copy of World of Goo, if you exceed the average payment.

01:44:22.900 --> 01:44:23.900
So that's kind of neat.

01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:28.620
That's neat that it's coming to mobile phones, so it'll never happen on Apple, but hey, yay

01:44:28.620 --> 01:44:29.620
for Android.

01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:35.660
And I guess these games are cross-platform, so you get them on Android and Windows and

01:44:35.660 --> 01:44:39.140
OS X and Linux.

01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:41.780
So that's pretty nice, I guess.

01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:45.860
The problem is, you know, really with a lot of these bundles, it's like if you bought

01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:50.780
one of these bundles, you probably have most of the games already in there anyway, so it's

01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:56.980
like how many fucking copies of VVVV do I need, or World of Goo, I mean it's just really.

01:44:56.980 --> 01:45:01.940
Last but not least, Vita Games, they did mention a while back that Vita Games were going to

01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:08.340
be cheaper if you did buy them online versus a boxed game, however you may consider still

01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:13.260
wanting to buy a boxed game because you're only going to be saving 10%, and that's it.

01:45:13.260 --> 01:45:17.980
They're 10% cheaper on the Playstation Network, they will be day and day, so if it's a game

01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:23.060
that maybe you just don't want to go to the store to get it, then you can do it I guess,

01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:26.260
but it's only 10%.

01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:30.340
Like two bucks on some of these games.

01:45:30.340 --> 01:45:34.780
That's really interesting, actually, that whole thing.

01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:39.140
Because that's kind of how they're going to try and combat used games, is by making it

01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:44.380
cheaper to buy a new one that you can never sell back.

01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:46.740
It's not much cheaper, it's like a few bucks.

01:45:46.740 --> 01:45:52.980
I mean seriously, you're going to make back the difference if you sell a new copy of a

01:45:52.980 --> 01:45:54.740
game used.

01:45:54.740 --> 01:45:56.740
For some people, that's going to make the difference.

01:45:56.740 --> 01:45:59.260
You know it.

01:45:59.260 --> 01:46:01.940
It's 10% folks, I mean come on.

01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:05.980
Now if you want to play devil's advocate, you can say, no it's not really 10%, it's

01:46:05.980 --> 01:46:11.740
going to be that plus tax, but I don't know if they charge tax on these purchases.

01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:13.260
Might depend on the state still.

01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:21.300
Yeah, so you could potentially save upwards to 20%, but once again, you know, you could

01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:24.300
probably buy it used and it'll be cheaper.

01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:28.500
I just don't know if there's a real need for you to jump in and get everything digital.

01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:32.140
Yeah, that's the way you want to roll, then fine.

01:46:32.140 --> 01:46:37.940
But 10% is, I was hoping it'd be a little bit more significant, like you know, $5 cheaper

01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:38.940
or something like that.

01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:46.100
Like if it's a $25 for a $30 game or something, that might be a little bit more swaying, but

01:46:46.100 --> 01:46:49.100
10%, I don't think a lot of people are going to jump on board.

01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:54.160
I'm sure some people will, because yeah, I'm saving some money, but.

01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:58.740
And if you're not one to sell back games, then maybe.

01:46:58.740 --> 01:46:59.740
Alright.

01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:05.500
Well moving on, unfortunately misspellings on box art will not result in any type of

01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:06.500
price reduction.

01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:08.980
In fact, it might make the price of these go up, I don't know.

01:47:08.980 --> 01:47:12.100
But we talked about this a little bit last week, and that's of course Resident Evil

01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:18.260
Revelations, or whatever, because the name on the box is actually spelled wrong.

01:47:18.260 --> 01:47:21.380
We already talked about this a little bit last week, but somebody had said, no Rob,

01:47:21.380 --> 01:47:22.700
that's just the review copies.

01:47:22.700 --> 01:47:26.220
And I was like, are you sure, because I thought that came from the first printing.

01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:30.060
Well, sure enough, it has been spotted out in the wild.

01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:37.380
Resident Evil Revelations is actually out there in the wild, misspelled.

01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:39.740
So there you go.

01:47:39.740 --> 01:47:44.620
It's missing the I and the T are backwards there, so that's what's wrong.

01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:49.620
But anyway, yeah, so the box art made it out there, so you know, you might actually, if

01:47:49.620 --> 01:47:50.620
you've already picked up a copy.

01:47:50.620 --> 01:47:55.260
Does that stuff get proofed, I mean, yeah, no, we were talking about this last week.

01:47:55.260 --> 01:48:01.900
But anyway, seeing where that is now, I think the designer had very little to do with that.

01:48:01.900 --> 01:48:07.380
So anyhow, Capcom has stated that the initial shipment was sent to retailers in North America

01:48:07.380 --> 01:48:09.140
with a spelling error.

01:48:09.140 --> 01:48:14.420
It's being repackaged and will have the corrected spelling, so you can actually order a new

01:48:14.420 --> 01:48:15.780
like slip cover for it.

01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:20.500
This is the exact same thing they did when they put out what Okami with the IGN watermark

01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:21.500
on it.

01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:22.500
Hilarious!

01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:26.400
I have like all of the new ones that I didn't even know in the game.

01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:31.300
That's even better, is I have a poster that they've made up the box art that has just

01:48:31.300 --> 01:48:36.180
like, it's like, how'd you miss that, I mean, really?

01:48:36.180 --> 01:48:37.740
Somebody approved that.

01:48:37.740 --> 01:48:43.980
All right, well, if Dance Dance Revolution with Just Yourself isn't enough, and DDR in

01:48:43.980 --> 01:48:48.240
the arcades with two people isn't enough, well, I hope you're still in high school because

01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:56.160
DDR Classroom Edition is going to be a PC game that allows 48 dance mats all to be linked

01:48:56.160 --> 01:48:58.700
together so that you can all play DDR.

01:48:58.700 --> 01:48:59.700
That's actually kind of cool.

01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:03.500
I'm actually, you know, as a gamer nerd who, you know, has been one ever since like high

01:49:03.500 --> 01:49:06.940
school where sometimes I was looked at as like the big ol' nerd for being into games,

01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:12.200
this is pretty rad that DDR really has kind of gotten into a lot of different PE programs,

01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:17.680
and so this is out there to try and basically get like an official Dance Dance Revolution

01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:23.600
classroom game, I mean, DDR, Konami already supports DDR and PE programs, but this is

01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:27.380
now just a whole like, 48 people can all play the same game.

01:49:27.380 --> 01:49:32.760
I'm not sure how that works, like, I don't know if it's like, if the majority of people

01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:38.780
get it right, then you get points or whatever, but I think it's just kind of a, you know,

01:49:38.780 --> 01:49:39.780
but that would be-

01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:40.780
Individual scoring, maybe?

01:49:40.780 --> 01:49:41.780
Who knows, who knows?

01:49:41.780 --> 01:49:44.840
Yeah, if you fail this, you will get an F in PE.

01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:47.720
The time has come for you to dance for your life, no.

01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:48.720
Alright.

01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:52.400
Now's the time, let's focus on me dance!

01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:57.480
Now I couldn't tell you exactly what songs are going to be in this new DDR game, but

01:49:57.480 --> 01:50:02.200
I bet if it's for schools, it's probably not going to be any songs by one particular musician

01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:08.240
who's been showing up in a lot of music games lately, and if recent rumors are to be believed,

01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:17.320
Ubisoft, who has made Just Dance, the Black Eyed Peas experience, the ABBA You Can Dance,

01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:22.280
the Michael Jackson experience, guess what's supposed to come out for the Wii and the Wii

01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:24.280
U later this year?

01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:28.800
The Lady Gaga experience!

01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:31.240
You know you're gonna get it!

01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:33.240
Praise Gaga!

01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:35.560
Oh my god.

01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:42.480
Step aside, bless her pop divas.

01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:49.680
You too can experience Amazon discounting your album to 99 cents, your fifth single

01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:55.200
not doing so well with a video that you directed, nobody understands, no I'm kidding, look,

01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:59.480
Lady Gaga experience, there'll be plenty of people that'll pick that up, I may or may

01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:00.720
not be one of them.

01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:01.720
You will be one of them.

01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:03.200
I will totally fucking buy this game.

01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:08.040
I am not even gonna try and lie, as long as it has all the songs I really like, I'll get

01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:09.040
it day one.

01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:13.880
Lady Gaga the experience though sounds kind of scary, I gotta say that.

01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:17.780
I don't want to experience what Lady Gaga goes through.

01:51:17.780 --> 01:51:22.360
Lady Gaga the experience, all will be revealed.

01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:24.640
You will experience.

01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:26.640
Is she really a man?

01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:30.100
No, that was proven when she showed her twat.

01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:31.100
When did she show her twat?

01:51:31.100 --> 01:51:32.100
Telephone.

01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:33.880
I don't remember that.

01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:40.120
And they, she hopped up on the bars and showed her twat to everybody and it was all squared

01:51:40.120 --> 01:51:41.120
out.

01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:42.120
Oh yeah.

01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:43.120
Yeah.

01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:44.120
I remember that.

01:51:44.120 --> 01:51:46.680
Well, they just have the pixel on her penis.

01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:48.060
She likes to make fun of it.

01:51:48.060 --> 01:51:52.600
I mean, and you know, if she had a penis, that thing would be like platinum plated and

01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:53.600
candy striped.

01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:57.160
Don't give her ideas for a new video.

01:51:57.160 --> 01:52:00.640
I've seen her live twice in concert and both times she's joked about the rumors that she

01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:01.640
has a penis.

01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:02.960
She thinks it's funny.

01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:05.760
So she, she, she, she likes the mystery, I guess.

01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:09.600
Anyway, can we please stop talking about Lady Gaga's penis and move on to more rapid fire

01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:10.600
news?

01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:11.600
Tark Sakura.

01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:12.600
I guess.

01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:17.400
Well, how about Dance Central 2?

01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:22.240
Download content is going to have some fun stuff in it if you like the game.

01:52:22.240 --> 01:52:26.200
There is a say, Hey, I love you.

01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:33.900
And this, Oh, by the way, this is, um, on, uh, February 14th and Milkshake cause that

01:52:33.900 --> 01:52:38.480
song is still, you know, relative.

01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:41.920
It still brings all the boys to the yard all these years later.

01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:46.960
And LMFAO featuring Lauren Bennett and Goon Rock's Party Rock Anthem.

01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:49.440
That might be kind of cool.

01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:55.040
Also on January 31st is Forget You or as the version I like, Fuck You.

01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:59.160
I just realized, do you even know what song Party Rock Anthem is?

01:52:59.160 --> 01:53:00.160
No.

01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:02.080
It's just interesting.

01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:08.880
I only know because I have to drive my wife's car and she doesn't have an MP3 player and

01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:13.500
we listen to, well, let me put this, but you can listen to any station and it's pretty

01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:17.480
much like that's one of the 10 songs that they have in rotation.

01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:18.480
Yeah.

01:53:18.480 --> 01:53:21.520
My favorite was when Alan and I were in the car the other day and we were listening to

01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:24.640
one station and Adele came on and we flipped to another station.

01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:26.880
They were in the middle of another Adele song.

01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:27.880
Go to a third station.

01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:30.600
They're in the middle of the song, the Adele song that the first station started playing.

01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:34.480
I'm like, this bitch is everywhere.

01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:37.080
God, I cannot.

01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:42.640
Um, also if you bought your copy of Dance Central 2 from Best Buy, you will get a code

01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:45.400
to get Party Rock Anthem early.

01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:47.880
Just saying whatever the hell song that is.

01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:50.660
That's some delayed DLC bonus right there.

01:53:50.660 --> 01:53:55.960
How about Just Dance 3 DLC because you know that game's relevant too.

01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:58.440
It is technically the number one selling game right now.

01:53:58.440 --> 01:54:05.960
You can get The Power by Snap because people still like that song and you can actually

01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:14.320
get a Bollywood, um, kati kalandal, I guess, love letters Y O Y and sweet invaders skin

01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:15.320
to skin.

01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:20.920
So you can get all those 240 Microsoft points a piece.

01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:26.080
And then last but not least, which I kind of think I need to get this, there's going

01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:31.260
to be the Pink Pearl 3DS available on February 10th and I want it the same way I wanted my

01:54:31.260 --> 01:54:35.080
pink GBA in a totally ironic way.

01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:37.760
I was hipster before everybody else was.

01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:42.800
No, seriously, I wanted the pink one because I thought it was hideous and I liked it and

01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:46.480
I think I would want this one too because it's equally hideous and I really want it.

01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:48.760
Okay, so tell me if you've ever heard this song before.

01:54:48.760 --> 01:54:49.760
Dark soccer.

01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:50.760
You ready?

01:54:50.760 --> 01:55:00.160
Oh, this shit.

01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:02.040
I'm like, she's not the girl in the bubble.

01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:04.340
She has to have heard it at some point.

01:55:04.340 --> 01:55:06.600
It's like pretty much avoidable.

01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:11.960
You can't, you know, you can't avoid that song to the radio in my car, but you go to

01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:12.960
Pinkberry.

01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:16.560
Yeah, that's probably, I think where I heard it.

01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:22.360
You know what song though I think of all these radio dancing songs where you're all glad

01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:26.560
it's not a video show right now because I shake my ass for dark soccer and I just looked

01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:27.960
the other way.

01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:31.880
You know what song I actually like and they were playing it like, where was it that they

01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:32.880
were playing?

01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:36.660
I think they were playing it at big lots or some shit, but they played that I'm sexy and

01:55:36.660 --> 01:55:41.400
I know it song, whatever song that was, I think it's really funny and I want that song.

01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:42.960
I don't know who does it, but I'm winning.

01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:43.960
That's LMFAO.

01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:44.960
It's the same band.

01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:45.960
It is.

01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:46.960
Yeah.

01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:47.960
Okay.

01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:48.960
Yeah.

01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:51.000
I think also did that song that, you know, sign waves that, you know, when a cage, that's

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:57.920
who opened for Kesha when my friend went and she said she was going just to see them and

01:55:57.920 --> 01:55:58.920
not Kesha.

01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:00.880
I'm surprised she didn't catch the herbs.

01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:05.000
The next day when she came into class, she was still had glitter in her hair.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:06.520
It was so funny.

01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:07.520
I think Kesha's hilarious.

01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:10.680
Um, so yeah, I used to really hate Kesha.

01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:14.500
But she's really grown on me and a lot of that is probably the influence of some of

01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:19.320
my friends, but like now it's kind of like that whole, like, it's like a guilty pleasure

01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:20.320
type of thing.

01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:23.060
Like, you know, some days you just feel a little bit trashy.

01:56:23.060 --> 01:56:25.480
Some days you want a trashy girl.

01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:26.480
She's a hot mess.

01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:27.480
She is.

01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:28.480
But there was more.

01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:29.480
Oh, more.

01:56:29.480 --> 01:56:39.640
I was going to say, um, it comes on February 10th for $169.99 and um, this isn't a bundle.

01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:41.920
Also I'm in the UK.

01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:46.240
They will get the same thing on February 10th and the ice white model, which we're not getting

01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:47.880
yet.

01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:50.880
Just saying.

01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:56.080
Can you imagine if Ubisoft put out Kesha, the experience, I'm sexy and I know it would

01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:58.620
just come with a gallon of body glitter.

01:56:58.620 --> 01:57:03.920
I know, God, that would just be, that would make my soul hurt.

01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:08.160
I would play it a jar full of gonorrhea and a used tampon.

01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:11.800
I would play it, but I would turn back in the gonorrhea.

01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:13.440
You can keep this part.

01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:15.800
I like my Kesha, bathe that Kesha.

01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:16.800
All right.

01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:21.760
Anyhow, moving on, let's get into some other news stories and of course the mailbag is

01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:22.760
coming up soon too.

01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:28.320
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and the FUs of the week, Twitter topics, Skypline, all

01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:29.320
that fun stuff.

01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:31.920
But first, some more stories, Loki.

01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:36.360
So yeah, you know the new Xbox and everyone's like, oh yeah, it's going to be announced

01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:37.360
this year.

01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:40.360
Microsoft said, nope.

01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:44.600
Apparently the Xbox 360 cycle is not at all finished.

01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:51.600
The proof is that we don't see the logic in cutting the prices here.

01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:55.360
And you know, E3 is still premature.

01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:59.440
What's certain is that there'll be nothing new in 2012.

01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:03.920
So and of course, you know, they put out another statement saying, no, we're always thinking

01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:07.960
about the next and you know, what is next and how we can push the boundaries and blah,

01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:08.960
blah, blah, blah.

01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:14.520
So yeah, you know, there will be another Xbox, most likely 2014 or holiday 2013.

01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:16.400
We're waiting to see what Nintendo does.

01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:19.000
I should have just been there lying because everybody would believe that.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.000
I honestly think...

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
I was going to tell them that for your ringtone.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:31.360
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, yeah.

01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:32.360
I did it.

01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:33.360
Turned it back on.

01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:41.120
Anyways, you know, it's basically, I mean, their new system is going to be graphically,

01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:44.920
the Wii U is going to be graphically capable of what the 360 is right now.

01:58:44.920 --> 01:58:47.920
So I don't really think that they have too much to worry about right now, especially

01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:54.920
if that whole tablet thing doesn't end up working out to be like this innovative masterpiece.

01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:55.920
I don't know.

01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:56.920
I think that they're fine right now.

01:58:56.920 --> 01:59:01.560
They can, they can wait next year for the component prices to come way down and still

01:59:01.560 --> 01:59:07.960
beef up their, you know, what's inside their box and, you know, put out some great games.

01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:08.960
What's in their box?

01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:09.960
Yes.

01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:10.960
It's Kesha.

01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:13.320
Um, here's the thing though.

01:59:13.320 --> 01:59:15.600
What does Microsoft show at E3 this year then?

01:59:15.600 --> 01:59:17.720
Is it just going to be a repeat of last year's E3?

01:59:17.720 --> 01:59:18.960
Halo 4.

01:59:18.960 --> 01:59:20.280
Which they showed at last E3.

01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:22.000
They showed a teaser.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:23.000
And then what?

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.960
The Tomb Raider game probably won't be out till this holiday, right?

01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:26.960
That was a game.

01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:29.280
Tomb Raider's not coming out until holiday.

01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:32.160
There's Bioshock Infinite still holiday this year.

01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:38.720
Maybe Grand Theft Auto 5 holiday, another Call of Duty game.

01:59:38.720 --> 01:59:40.760
There's going to be a bunch of new IPs.

01:59:40.760 --> 01:59:45.680
How much of Microsoft's keynote is just going to be rehash of last year's stuff?

01:59:45.680 --> 01:59:47.700
I think they may still have a lot of stuff.

01:59:47.700 --> 01:59:49.520
We haven't heard a whole lot.

01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:51.440
Maybe they're keeping a lot of it under wraps.

01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:55.600
And I don't think they need to come out with a brand new system yet.

01:59:55.600 --> 02:00:02.760
I don't think they do either, but I'm still waiting for, like, that Killer Connect hardcore

02:00:02.760 --> 02:00:03.760
game.

02:00:03.760 --> 02:00:09.920
Like, what, didn't we get a glimpse at one that was supposed to be some, like, uh, Greek

02:00:09.920 --> 02:00:10.920
fighting thing?

02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:11.920
Yes.

02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:13.920
There's still the one, that's the one from Crytek.

02:00:13.920 --> 02:00:17.720
Which, you know, that could be a big hit or a big miss.

02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:20.160
It's hard to say.

02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:23.960
There's really, that could be a hot mess when that comes out.

02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:25.880
So we'll see.

02:00:25.880 --> 02:00:27.760
Yeah, there's that one.

02:00:27.760 --> 02:00:31.000
I don't remember what it's called, but yeah, it's from Crytek.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:36.460
I don't know, there's a lot of games coming out this year.

02:00:36.460 --> 02:00:40.240
And there's a lot of new IPs, I can't remember all of them.

02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:42.280
But I'm sure there's going to be some stuff that they'll be able to show.

02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:47.120
And obviously, you know, there's a new...

02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:51.360
They're going to show the new Fable game, which I don't give a shit about at all.

02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:57.600
If I'm done with that series, and done with Peter Molyneux, like, I think I need to pay

02:00:57.600 --> 02:00:58.960
more attention to what he said.

02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:01.840
Oh yeah, there was that whole Fable connect, like, it's not on Rails.

02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:02.840
It's not on Rails!

02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:03.840
It's on Rails.

02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:04.840
Read it on the board, it's not on Rails.

02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:09.240
Listen, listen, listen you fucker, I'm not fucking listening to what fucking Peter Molyneux

02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:10.240
says.

02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:12.400
It's not on Rails, it's fucking on Rails, okay?

02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:16.560
It will be on goddamn Rails.

02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:20.240
Because anything he promises you is going to be underwhelming, okay?

02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:23.280
It's just the way it is.

02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:25.680
He's a snake oil salesman.

02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:27.040
That's what he is, okay?

02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:29.340
He's a fucking snake oil salesman.

02:01:29.340 --> 02:01:33.520
He will promise you the world, and it will be fucking Fable all over again.

02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:34.520
And you know what?

02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:37.640
Whether you're a fan of Fable that much, that might be a good thing.

02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:40.280
I mean, maybe you're just looking for Fable.

02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:44.840
But it's not going to be this thing that's going to revolutionize Fable.

02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:46.960
Nothing will revolutionize Fable.

02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:51.000
But maybe Kingdom of Amalur, or whatever that game is called.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:52.880
Which is basically EA's Fable game.

02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:55.520
Yeah, it's Fable with God of War fighting.

02:01:55.520 --> 02:01:58.280
I mean, which, that's not a bad combo.

02:01:58.280 --> 02:01:59.280
That doesn't sound bad.

02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:00.280
It's not a bad combo.

02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:01.680
I mean, it sounds better than the demo.

02:02:01.680 --> 02:02:05.520
Alright, anyhow, big changes going on at Xbox.

02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:10.720
This is actually a pretty big change, and I always say this guy's name wrong, so, Steven

02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:11.720
Toulouse?

02:02:11.720 --> 02:02:13.280
That sounds right.

02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:15.960
Is one of the big guys at Xbox.

02:02:15.960 --> 02:02:19.400
He is the director of Xbox Live policy and enforcement.

02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:21.880
He's been working at Microsoft for quite a long time.

02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:25.040
I think about 17 years he's been working there.

02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:28.120
He is no longer going to be working there in a couple weeks.

02:02:28.120 --> 02:02:33.420
He has resigned, effective on February 16th, for no particular reason.

02:02:33.420 --> 02:02:34.420
It's very interesting.

02:02:34.420 --> 02:02:38.680
He's just said, on the 16th, I'm going to head down to Dallas to visit my family.

02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:40.400
I have no other plans beyond that.

02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:42.140
I'm a free agent.

02:02:42.140 --> 02:02:43.140
So he's not really saying...

02:02:43.140 --> 02:02:45.840
Is he a free bitch baby?

02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:49.460
He's not really saying he's jumped ship to go somewhere else, like some mega company

02:02:49.460 --> 02:02:52.880
or something like that, or what have you.

02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:58.080
Microsoft did come out and basically say that, yes, he's leaving the company.

02:02:58.080 --> 02:02:59.240
Thank you for his service.

02:02:59.240 --> 02:03:00.320
Wish all the best.

02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:03.500
We don't have any details to share about a potential successor.

02:03:03.500 --> 02:03:07.380
We can assure you that the Xbox Live enforcement squad will continue their work to help ensure

02:03:07.380 --> 02:03:09.880
a safer, more secure experience, da da da da da.

02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:14.980
Now, of course, the conclusion that many people have jumped to regarding this little resignation

02:03:14.980 --> 02:03:18.320
is that, oh, it's because of the hacks.

02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:22.120
Something's happening with the hacks and he's stepping out because he knows something ugly

02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:25.800
is going to go down and he doesn't want to go down with it, da da da da da, like all the

02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:28.100
tinfoil hat people come out.

02:03:28.100 --> 02:03:32.240
And to some extent, I've been one of the harshest critics of Xbox around here and the way they've

02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:34.040
handled that whole mess.

02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:36.600
You mean they handled it?

02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:38.600
Well, yeah, exactly.

02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:43.280
Rhythm party is like the first time I've turned on my Xbox in a month.

02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:47.960
So, you know, I'm just but I don't think at the end of the day, it really has anything

02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:55.080
to do with that because his role was more about keeping the Xbox Live environment a

02:03:55.080 --> 02:03:58.480
safe haven, if you are a family friendly environment.

02:03:58.480 --> 02:03:59.480
You know what I mean?

02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:05.600
It's just basically a safe place, I don't know, whatever you want to call it.

02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:09.120
It's just very possible that after it's like the Thor of the ban hammer.

02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:10.680
Well, let's be real.

02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:11.680
I don't know this guy.

02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:12.680
I don't know him personally.

02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:13.680
I don't know.

02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:14.680
I read his blogs.

02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:15.680
I don't follow him on Twitter, da da da.

02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:19.880
I've heard he's very accessible, but I have not chosen to access him.

02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:26.520
From what I hear is the thing, though, if you've been working at the same job 17 years,

02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:29.560
and so he's got to be what, like almost 40.

02:04:29.560 --> 02:04:34.200
He's probably going through what some might call a midlife crisis.

02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:38.960
And I'm not saying I'm not saying it's necessarily a bad thing to buy a Ferrari and drive.

02:04:38.960 --> 02:04:40.680
I'm not saying it's necessarily a bad thing.

02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:44.800
It's probably just that moment a lot of people go through where it's like, is this what I

02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:46.200
want to do forever?

02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:50.000
And maybe he decided I want to spend more time with family or I want to do something

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:51.000
else.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:55.560
And, you know, he, as a director, he's probably built up a little bit of a nest egg and he's

02:04:55.560 --> 02:04:57.480
probably okay to do that.

02:04:57.480 --> 02:05:00.760
So what I'm trying to say is that I really don't think this has anything to do with the

02:05:00.760 --> 02:05:05.080
Xbox hacks and just this guy wants to go have a life.

02:05:05.080 --> 02:05:06.280
Hooray!

02:05:06.280 --> 02:05:09.040
Good for him.

02:05:09.040 --> 02:05:11.360
It's great.

02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:16.200
So meanwhile, Xbox really does need to do something about the hacking, but I don't think

02:05:16.200 --> 02:05:19.560
this guy has anything to do with that.

02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:20.880
Let's move on, shall we?

02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:21.880
Why, yes.

02:05:21.880 --> 02:05:24.440
Oh, some comments from our chat room real quick on this.

02:05:24.440 --> 02:05:27.280
Tiger Claw says he was a co-host for Major Nelson's podcast.

02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:32.040
I think I've listened to one episode of Major Nelson's podcast and it was many, many years

02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:33.040
ago.

02:05:33.040 --> 02:05:35.440
So sadly, I wouldn't know that.

02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:36.680
But that's interesting to know.

02:05:36.680 --> 02:05:39.760
So I guess a lot of the community knows him through that, too.

02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:44.160
Break Man says he's leaving Xbox Live because he's tired of Xbox Live kids calling him the

02:05:44.160 --> 02:05:48.080
N-word or questioning his sexuality in vulgar ways on a regular basis.

02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:51.440
Kind of like how everybody gets treated on Xbox Live.

02:05:51.440 --> 02:05:56.480
Well, you know, if that hasn't been fixed in the past, how long has Xbox Live been around

02:05:56.480 --> 02:05:57.480
now?

02:05:57.480 --> 02:05:58.480
About nine years?

02:05:58.480 --> 02:05:59.960
I don't think it's going to get fixed anytime soon.

02:05:59.960 --> 02:06:00.960
That's it.

02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:02.280
All right.

02:06:02.280 --> 02:06:03.880
Not that it makes it right.

02:06:03.880 --> 02:06:05.440
Just saying.

02:06:05.440 --> 02:06:13.840
Maybe the Xbox lube or whatever the next Xbox ends up being called will have extreme anti-homophobe,

02:06:13.840 --> 02:06:16.040
anti-racist measures in it.

02:06:16.040 --> 02:06:17.920
But I wouldn't hold my breath.

02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:19.920
Let's get to some emails.

02:06:19.920 --> 02:06:20.920
Yay.

02:06:20.920 --> 02:06:24.880
Every week you guys email us at mailbagatorangelaunchrader.com.

02:06:24.880 --> 02:06:27.240
We read some of our favorite emails on the air.

02:06:27.240 --> 02:06:30.280
And we stop the music now.

02:06:30.280 --> 02:06:34.360
I got one that says don't judge my grammar, but grammar was misspelled.

02:06:34.360 --> 02:06:38.840
I'm not going to say who it was though, because I'm not going to bring attention to that person.

02:06:38.840 --> 02:06:44.800
So I'm grabbing a random email and here's one that actually has fantastic grammar.

02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:50.960
I found this great website where you can play Ness Ness, okay, Genesis is misspelled, etc.

02:06:50.960 --> 02:06:52.000
Games on your computer.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:55.040
I'm writing this because I know Dark Sakura is into old games.

02:06:55.040 --> 02:06:56.040
Keep up the good work.

02:06:56.040 --> 02:07:01.120
And here's another 10 great years of Orange Lounge Radio and that's sincerely CD Thunder.

02:07:01.120 --> 02:07:05.920
I just want to point out in 10 more years, we'll be as old or if not older than this

02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:10.480
guy who just resigned from Microsoft and we'll probably have a midlife crisis.

02:07:10.480 --> 02:07:13.240
I would like to point out that he didn't send the link.

02:07:13.240 --> 02:07:14.240
Really?

02:07:14.240 --> 02:07:16.600
He told you, hey, check out this great website.

02:07:16.600 --> 02:07:20.200
It's called Sincerely Me.

02:07:20.200 --> 02:07:22.320
Okay.

02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:23.320
Next email.

02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:29.320
This comes from, oh, nevermind.

02:07:29.320 --> 02:07:32.560
This was actually personally for us, so I'm saving it.

02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:34.280
Now I really want to see it.

02:07:34.280 --> 02:07:35.280
It's about mics.

02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:36.280
Oh yeah.

02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:37.280
Oh yeah.

02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:38.280
I remember that.

02:07:38.280 --> 02:07:39.280
Yeah.

02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:40.280
Yeah.

02:07:40.280 --> 02:07:41.280
This is what you get for not checking the email box.

02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:42.280
So I forgot one week.

02:07:42.280 --> 02:07:43.280
Good Lord.

02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:44.280
One week my butt.

02:07:44.280 --> 02:07:45.280
Okay.

02:07:45.280 --> 02:07:46.280
Squawk!

02:07:46.280 --> 02:07:47.280
Greetings, OLR.

02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:48.280
This is your friendly neighborhood turtle.

02:07:48.280 --> 02:07:52.400
Sky, I know you're probably under an NDA with Diablo three beta.

02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:55.960
Without breaking that, can you please speak a little about your thoughts on the game and

02:07:55.960 --> 02:07:59.080
some of the recent changes that they've made in the beta?

02:07:59.080 --> 02:08:00.080
I'm under an NDA.

02:08:00.080 --> 02:08:01.080
I don't know.

02:08:01.080 --> 02:08:04.880
Am I going to love this as much as D2, or is there too much hype at this point?

02:08:04.880 --> 02:08:07.200
I don't think I'm under an NDA.

02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:08.520
If I am, oops.

02:08:08.520 --> 02:08:10.040
There's so much information out there.

02:08:10.040 --> 02:08:12.320
No, there's like stuff on YouTube, people playing through it.

02:08:12.320 --> 02:08:13.880
It can't be under NDA.

02:08:13.880 --> 02:08:17.480
I'm not going to say anything that, I'll tell you what, the last time I played through it

02:08:17.480 --> 02:08:19.240
was in November.

02:08:19.240 --> 02:08:23.340
I probably gave it a more extensive review on one of the shows back then.

02:08:23.340 --> 02:08:24.340
But I enjoyed it.

02:08:24.340 --> 02:08:26.800
You know, I enjoyed the older Diablo games.

02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:30.200
Some people call it, oh, it's just a click fest, click, click, click.

02:08:30.200 --> 02:08:31.640
But no, I thought it was fun.

02:08:31.640 --> 02:08:37.600
I had a lot of fun, like Shane, who has sometimes been known as Mikolatov on the show, and he

02:08:37.600 --> 02:08:38.600
was in the beta too.

02:08:38.600 --> 02:08:41.760
And we did some co-op online and we had a lot of fun just kind of playing it together

02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:43.840
and exploring the dungeons.

02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:46.980
It's very similar to what you remember in Diablo two.

02:08:46.980 --> 02:08:49.040
There's a few quality of life improvements.

02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:52.440
Like I seem to remember, oh God, it's been a few months since I played it now, but I

02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:57.020
seem to remember that, like, you don't have to carry around a bunch of town portal scrolls

02:08:57.020 --> 02:09:00.480
because like there's an item in your inventory that lets you just make one, you know, just

02:09:00.480 --> 02:09:04.280
kind of like little things like that that help it, you know, feel.

02:09:04.280 --> 02:09:06.320
You said quality of life improvements.

02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:08.000
Does it make you sexy and you know it?

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:09.940
Yes, it does actually.

02:09:09.940 --> 02:09:11.360
And some of the classes were really fun to play.

02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:14.960
I really enjoyed Monk, but there was another one I played I didn't like as much.

02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:16.320
I think it was the Witch Doctor.

02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:17.320
That was the Chipmunk.

02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:18.320
No, the Witch Doctor.

02:09:18.320 --> 02:09:20.160
I didn't like as much, but I liked the Monk.

02:09:20.160 --> 02:09:21.160
Okay.

02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:24.320
If you're able to continue with the email, any tidbit of info would be appreciated.

02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:25.320
Thanks.

02:09:25.320 --> 02:09:27.480
Your loyal turtle and fairly serious turtle.

02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:28.480
P.S.

02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:31.200
I heard that Loki secretly works for Nintendo.

02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:32.200
Boom.

02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:34.480
I secretly work for Nintendo.

02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:35.480
Boom.

02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:36.480
Boom.

02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:37.480
Boom.

02:09:37.480 --> 02:09:38.480
Blocks.

02:09:38.480 --> 02:09:39.480
I wish.

02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:42.880
I honestly wish I did because, you know, I'd be getting a lot more money.

02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:47.000
If you saw Reggie knew how to kick ass and take names, Loki would be in there just, he

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.840
would just, he'd flip a table the first day.

02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:50.840
Okay.

02:09:50.840 --> 02:09:51.840
I wish.

02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:53.560
Loki, would you flip a table if you worked for Nintendo?

02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:54.560
Fuck that.

02:09:54.560 --> 02:09:55.560
I'd want to stay employed.

02:09:55.560 --> 02:09:56.560
Okay.

02:09:56.560 --> 02:09:57.560
So, email.

02:09:57.560 --> 02:09:58.560
Last email.

02:09:58.560 --> 02:09:59.560
Yes.

02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:00.560
Dear OLR.

02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:01.560
Okay.

02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:04.680
Recently I purchased a copy of the Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Game of the Year edition.

02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:07.800
Now I'm enjoying it for the most part with the exception of one thing.

02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:13.280
The Game of the Year edition has a glitch in which when you're a vampire and you seek,

02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:16.840
and you receive a quest to cure yourself.

02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:18.720
Now granted, I like being a vampire.

02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:22.120
I was strong, fast, didn't sparkle, but it made my character weak to fire and sunlight

02:10:22.120 --> 02:10:23.720
turns me into a crispy critter.

02:10:23.720 --> 02:10:25.840
I'm glad I'm not the only one that uses that term.

02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:26.840
Now-

02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:27.840
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:32.080
You mean an Elder Scrolls game is glitchy?

02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:35.440
Now on that quest you talk to a witch and after running errands for her, she sends you

02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:39.200
out for ingredients for the potion to cure yourself permanently, but one of the ingredients

02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:42.360
will not be accepted now they patched this out of the original game.

02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:47.600
But when they booted out the Knights of the Nine DLC, the glitch re-arose and there's

02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:49.880
no way around that with Game of the Year.

02:10:49.880 --> 02:10:53.920
Now on another note, I've been playing a Japanese PSP demo for Final Fantasy Type O.

02:10:53.920 --> 02:10:55.320
I wanna play that!

02:10:55.320 --> 02:10:59.440
I'm wondering if this will ever come into America and how it ties in with the, uh, Fabula

02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:01.200
Nova Crystallis.

02:11:01.200 --> 02:11:03.840
Thank you for reading my email signed Haseo Sumiragawa.

02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:07.120
I don't believe it is part of the Fabu-

02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:08.920
It was supposed to be Akido.

02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:12.600
It was originally gonna be the mobile phone one, right, but they just totally changed

02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:13.600
it.

02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:14.600
Now it's the PSP one.

02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:15.600
This is supposed to be the Akido 13.

02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:16.600
Yeah.

02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:18.240
I, I wanna play it.

02:11:18.240 --> 02:11:19.720
I really wanna play it.

02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:24.120
It's probably gonna, like, kinda feel like the same universe as 13, but it won't be like

02:11:24.120 --> 02:11:25.120
any of the same characters.

02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:29.600
It'll be like Versus, cause Final Fantasy Versus 13 doesn't look like it has shit in

02:11:29.600 --> 02:11:35.120
common with Final Fantasy 13, except I'm assuming it takes place on Cocoon.

02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:36.120
No characters?

02:11:36.120 --> 02:11:37.120
No.

02:11:37.120 --> 02:11:38.120
It's all different people?

02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:39.120
No.

02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:40.120
I don't even think it takes place on Cocoon.

02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:41.120
Yeah, so I don't know what the hell-

02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:42.640
I wanna play it when you're done.

02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:43.640
What?

02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:44.640
I don't have Versus.

02:11:44.640 --> 02:11:45.640
I have 13 too.

02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:49.080
Oh, yeah, you can- if I get it back in less than a year this time-

02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:55.280
Honestly, 13 Versus, it has, like, nothing to do with anything.

02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:57.600
13 Versus looks good, though.

02:11:57.600 --> 02:11:58.600
Yeah.

02:11:58.600 --> 02:11:59.600
It looks really good, I gotta say.

02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:00.600
Hey!

02:12:00.600 --> 02:12:03.160
We got an email from PlayStation Network.

02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:04.400
It's probably a hack email, or official email.

02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:07.640
It's not a hack email, it's that they're changing the PlayStation Network-

02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:13.120
Info at PlayStation.messages4.com, yeah, that's, that's a-

02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:15.120
I did get one for the PlayStation Network, it's basically-

02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:20.520
Yeah, they're merging PlayStation Network into the Sony Entertainment Network, or whatever.

02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:23.240
The Sony Entertainment Network of You Can't Sue Us.

02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:24.240
Yeah.

02:12:24.240 --> 02:12:25.240
Watch us.

02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:30.600
I mean, hey, if they give us no reason for legal action, we're not gonna say anything.

02:12:30.600 --> 02:12:35.400
For the record, I have not updated my system, so therefore I have not accepted the end user

02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:36.720
license agreement yet.

02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:37.720
Ho ho ho.

02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:41.240
I will still sue you if I feel like it.

02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:42.240
If you feel like it.

02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:46.440
This is my Southern lawyer, he was suing me.

02:12:46.440 --> 02:12:47.440
What?

02:12:47.440 --> 02:12:49.800
Okay, can we...visit?

02:12:49.800 --> 02:12:50.960
That's it?

02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:51.960
You're done?

02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:52.960
No more emails.

02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:53.960
I'm done, where's the fork?

02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:56.400
All right, let's go to the FUs of the week.

02:12:56.400 --> 02:12:58.840
Every week on this show we like to get angsty.

02:12:58.840 --> 02:12:59.840
Why?

02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:18.520
Because we can.

02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:27.680
F-U to, um- God, you know, I had it in my head and I forgot what it was, it was somebody-

02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:34.040
Oh yeah, the girl outside of Whole Foods today who was trying to get me to sign her petition.

02:13:34.040 --> 02:13:38.120
I normally don't have a problem with that, I'm all for political action, but I don't

02:13:38.120 --> 02:13:42.680
sign those petitions from people that are just standing outside the door because there's

02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:47.200
been a lot of issue lately with people trying to get your information and using it against

02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:48.200
you.

02:13:48.200 --> 02:13:51.880
And I don't really have- I thought she was legit, I mean, I'm not gonna make a judgment

02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:52.880
on her.

02:13:52.880 --> 02:13:56.920
But, um, she's like, do you have- hey, how you doing, do you have time for this?

02:13:56.920 --> 02:14:01.000
Like, I'm sorry, I'm really big in a hurry, she's like, oh, well, are you late for the

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:02.000
game?

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:05.880
Like, don't start a conversation with me when I tell you I am in a hurry.

02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:08.560
I hate football.

02:14:08.560 --> 02:14:11.920
Don't stop me with foot- I mean, she didn't know that, but I was like, I was like, if

02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:17.400
I say I'm in a hurry, the correct response will be, oh, I'm sorry, bye, bye.

02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:19.720
Not trying to start a conversation with me.

02:14:19.720 --> 02:14:21.440
I'm still not gonna sign your shit.

02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:24.000
Look at our website when you have a chance.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:29.800
Yeah, I would sign it through the website- if I had credentials, you know, but that and

02:14:29.800 --> 02:14:34.840
how much my feet hurt yesterday, oh my god, okay, but I had a really good time at museums

02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:35.840
with Becky.

02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:36.840
Lots of fun.

02:14:36.840 --> 02:14:37.840
Were they really crowded?

02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:42.440
I haven't heard a lot of people- We went to the Children's Discovery Museum

02:14:42.440 --> 02:14:44.720
with Julian in the morning and it was- We thought about going to that, we're really

02:14:44.720 --> 02:14:45.720
sure.

02:14:45.720 --> 02:14:47.600
Don't do it on the freebie day.

02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:48.600
Just get a membership.

02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:49.600
It's so much easier.

02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:55.160
But, I mean, he had a good time, but it was really crowded and then, but when we went

02:14:55.160 --> 02:15:02.400
to the Crocker, we got there right around like, I want to say one something and it was

02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:07.960
busy, yeah, but it wasn't prohibitively busy, if you know what I mean.

02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:12.840
We actually still got up close to several of the paintings that they had on display.

02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:19.560
There was a display of Italian Baroque art, it was really nice, but yeah, but my feet

02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:26.680
hurt after, you know, walking from J Street to the Crocker, walking around the Crocker

02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:31.000
and walking back and then I had to pee, so, alright, that was it.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:36.960
And you know what they say, and I'm sure they've stolen this from somebody, if it ain't Baroque,

02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:37.960
then don't fix it.

02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:38.960
I've heard that before.

02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:39.960
I don't remember that story.

02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:42.160
If it ain't Baroque, it's probably Renaissance.

02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:44.160
It was from Beauty and the Beast.

02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:45.800
Yeah, it was Lumiere.

02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:48.680
Lumiere says, no, Cogsworth says it.

02:15:48.680 --> 02:15:52.360
Cogsworth said it, and Becky even quoted that when we were at the thing with the Baroque

02:15:52.360 --> 02:15:53.360
art.

02:15:53.360 --> 02:15:54.360
You just quoted Beauty and the Beast, Loki.

02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:55.360
Yeah, whatever.

02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:59.160
It's not Baroque, don't fix it.

02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:05.920
Let's be real though, if this program were made up of dancing, you know, housewares,

02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:10.240
Loki would be in the scene as well.

02:16:10.240 --> 02:16:17.400
I don't want to be Mrs. Potts, or the cupboard, the wardrobe.

02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:18.400
Clearly I'm Lumiere.

02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:19.400
Alright, moving on.

02:16:19.400 --> 02:16:21.400
Because you're so French, Rob.

02:16:21.400 --> 02:16:24.080
I'm on fire.

02:16:24.080 --> 02:16:28.500
This is, I don't even know if this is really an F.U., but I guess it is.

02:16:28.500 --> 02:16:33.520
I'm just very sick and tired of the whole argument that used games steal away from developers.

02:16:33.520 --> 02:16:38.440
Okay, let me fucking, I mean, come on, developers, you should know how this fucking works.

02:16:38.440 --> 02:16:39.560
You make a game.

02:16:39.560 --> 02:16:41.440
The game gets pressed.

02:16:41.440 --> 02:16:45.920
The publisher sells the game to the retailer.

02:16:45.920 --> 02:16:48.240
Therefore there is money being exchanged there.

02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:52.540
It is up to the retailer to then sell the game so that they're not out the money that

02:16:52.540 --> 02:16:56.840
they paid for the game, and they make a small profit on top of that.

02:16:56.840 --> 02:17:03.800
Then maybe, as an incentive, you may get, you know, some extra money depending on how

02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:05.900
well the game sells.

02:17:05.900 --> 02:17:11.680
That is the only money that is getting eaten up by used game sales, and it's a very small

02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:17.100
fraction of that that you're even, you know, losing out on.

02:17:17.100 --> 02:17:21.080
And the great part is the person that was bitching about this in particular happened

02:17:21.080 --> 02:17:23.520
to be Ian Milham.

02:17:23.520 --> 02:17:28.320
Ian Milham is the creative director at Electronic Arts, art director on Dead Space.

02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:33.240
Yes, you of all people should really bitch about how your game is just tanked because

02:17:33.240 --> 02:17:34.400
of used game sales.

02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:37.440
Oh wait, how many millions of copies did it sell?

02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:42.080
Yeah, so you can shut the fuck up because you still made your fucking money and used

02:17:42.080 --> 02:17:45.360
games didn't do shit for you guys.

02:17:45.360 --> 02:17:49.280
I'm sorry, it's just a stupid argument, and I always tell people, we're the stupid money

02:17:49.280 --> 02:17:52.640
from the developers if we buy used games.

02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:53.640
No!

02:17:53.640 --> 02:17:57.240
It does not fucking steal any money from anybody because those games are already goddamn paid

02:17:57.240 --> 02:17:58.240
for.

02:17:58.240 --> 02:18:02.560
If they all sat on shelves, they don't fucking care, they have their money already.

02:18:02.560 --> 02:18:05.280
That's the whole point.

02:18:05.280 --> 02:18:06.280
That's it.

02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:09.960
Alright, well shit, how am I supposed to follow that?

02:18:09.960 --> 02:18:10.960
Um, F-U-

02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:11.960
It's pudding.

02:18:11.960 --> 02:18:12.960
I want pudding.

02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:16.560
Um, F-U to a lot of the same stuff that was bothering me last week, but I want to say

02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:19.720
thank you to the person who reached out to me on Twitter to talk about that.

02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:22.920
I thought that was very nice, you know who you are.

02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:27.640
And I want to say F-U to the fact that, oh my god, I went to California Pizza Kitchen

02:18:27.640 --> 02:18:31.440
last night, and granted there was a rather large party of us, but it took an hour and

02:18:31.440 --> 02:18:35.380
fifteen minutes to get a table when we were quoted thirty, and then even then they sat

02:18:35.380 --> 02:18:37.400
us at two separate tables.

02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:40.880
And we watched another party right after us get sat at the big long table where there

02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:43.000
was usually like twelve to thirteen of them.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:46.040
And so I was discriminated against, I'm convinced that's what it was.

02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:48.280
You should have called the manager.

02:18:48.280 --> 02:18:49.280
Uh, my friend did.

02:18:49.280 --> 02:18:51.520
You should have just gone to California Pizza Kitchen, I mean.

02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:56.920
I know, but here's the weird thing, F-U to myself, because we went to California Pizza

02:18:56.920 --> 02:18:59.840
Kitchen, and I ordered a salad.

02:18:59.840 --> 02:19:01.160
Actually Becky orders a salad.

02:19:01.160 --> 02:19:04.240
That's why they discriminated against you right there.

02:19:04.240 --> 02:19:05.480
These salads are really good.

02:19:05.480 --> 02:19:09.880
Yeah, they have a whole page dedicated to salads, and they have really good salads.

02:19:09.880 --> 02:19:12.980
Like you wouldn't know it, but- Yeah I would know it.

02:19:12.980 --> 02:19:15.640
It's not California Salad Kitchen, but it could be.

02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:17.320
You know what's funny?

02:19:17.320 --> 02:19:18.320
What?

02:19:18.320 --> 02:19:21.480
Julian calls his bedroom his pizza kitchen.

02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:27.440
Listen, we know your type of fresh choice is down the street, get the fuck out of here.

02:19:27.440 --> 02:19:28.440
That's where I had lunch yesterday.

02:19:28.440 --> 02:19:32.300
You fags are gonna come in here and order salad?

02:19:32.300 --> 02:19:33.300
That's exactly what happened.

02:19:33.300 --> 02:19:34.480
You know what that makes me think of?

02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:35.480
What?

02:19:35.480 --> 02:19:41.080
I ordered a brack, and she ordered something called a salad.

02:19:41.080 --> 02:19:42.640
That to me is love.

02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:49.800
The salt on the wound was watching all these high school kids coming in there all dressed

02:19:49.800 --> 02:19:51.800
up like it's fucking prom or something.

02:19:51.800 --> 02:19:54.120
Is it prom season?

02:19:54.120 --> 02:19:55.120
Maybe hell.

02:19:55.120 --> 02:19:56.120
Winter ball.

02:19:56.120 --> 02:19:57.120
Wait, no.

02:19:57.120 --> 02:19:58.600
Have things been cut back so much that they're gonna graduate next month?

02:19:58.600 --> 02:20:01.120
Winter ball, I guess, because- We never had that shit.

02:20:01.120 --> 02:20:04.560
I don't know, but there was a hell of people all dressed up, and all these kids, and their

02:20:04.560 --> 02:20:09.280
fancy pants dresses, because California Pizza Kitchen's the nice part of town where all

02:20:09.280 --> 02:20:11.280
the rich, spoiled kids live.

02:20:11.280 --> 02:20:12.280
What, Arden?

02:20:12.280 --> 02:20:13.280
No.

02:20:13.280 --> 02:20:14.280
You went to the other one?

02:20:14.280 --> 02:20:18.200
We went to the one where Dave and Buster's is, the Fountains.

02:20:18.200 --> 02:20:19.200
See what I mean?

02:20:19.200 --> 02:20:20.200
Go to Arden.

02:20:20.200 --> 02:20:22.560
That's why- Don't give a shit at Arden.

02:20:22.560 --> 02:20:27.600
Go hang out with the poor people like me at Arden.

02:20:27.600 --> 02:20:28.600
Arden don't give a shit.

02:20:28.600 --> 02:20:29.600
You know what?

02:20:29.600 --> 02:20:34.360
If I'm gonna go over there, I'm just gonna go to Mikuni anyway, or Dave and Buster's.

02:20:34.360 --> 02:20:35.360
Like the one or two.

02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:36.360
We had a party in nine, though.

02:20:36.360 --> 02:20:38.680
It's hard to find something everybody likes.

02:20:38.680 --> 02:20:39.680
Yeah.

02:20:39.680 --> 02:20:41.120
All right, so we went to California Salad Kitchen.

02:20:41.120 --> 02:20:43.800
We went to Dave and Buster's.

02:20:43.800 --> 02:20:44.800
You know what?

02:20:44.800 --> 02:20:46.800
I suggested Dave and Buster's, but I got shot down.

02:20:46.800 --> 02:20:49.000
They didn't want to do that.

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:50.000
Let's be real, though.

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.520
The food at Dave and Buster's is kind of mediocre.

02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:55.720
And the night before Super Bowl Sunday, we were kind of afraid it was gonna be a mess.

02:20:55.720 --> 02:20:59.160
Of course, we didn't fare much better at California Pizza Kitchen.

02:20:59.160 --> 02:21:03.140
But anyway, could we please not turn this into a California Pizza Kitchen show and talk

02:21:03.140 --> 02:21:05.760
about more news, Loki?

02:21:05.760 --> 02:21:14.160
So you know, not to be out done, I guess, in Monkey See Monkey Do or whatever.

02:21:14.160 --> 02:21:20.760
You know, Sony's pulling another move with the Wii U type controllers.

02:21:20.760 --> 02:21:28.120
Sony has patented their own Wii U-esque device, and it looks like a tablet.

02:21:28.120 --> 02:21:30.540
What more is there to say?

02:21:30.540 --> 02:21:31.540
Tablet with buttons on it.

02:21:31.540 --> 02:21:36.960
Actually, it looks like kind of a cross between a Game Boy and an iPod, and that looks really

02:21:36.960 --> 02:21:37.960
weird.

02:21:37.960 --> 02:21:44.320
It shows some augmented reality thing where this guy looks like his character through

02:21:44.320 --> 02:21:45.320
the tablet.

02:21:45.320 --> 02:21:46.320
That thing looks bizarre.

02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:47.320
Why do they need to do that?

02:21:47.320 --> 02:21:51.480
Didn't they just say, like, two weeks ago that the PlayStation Vita was capable of everything

02:21:51.480 --> 02:21:54.640
that they're saying the whole Wii U will do?

02:21:54.640 --> 02:21:55.640
I don't know.

02:21:55.640 --> 02:21:56.640
It looks weird.

02:21:56.640 --> 02:22:00.560
It looks like it's gonna support multiple tablets, and that it'll almost be some sort

02:22:00.560 --> 02:22:04.720
of augmented reality thing.

02:22:04.720 --> 02:22:13.160
It basically is titled the very generic position-dependent gaming 3D controller and handheld as remote.

02:22:13.160 --> 02:22:19.200
Device would track its own location as input into video game and would render an avatar

02:22:19.200 --> 02:22:29.800
on a mobile device such that it appears to overlay a competing user in the real world.

02:22:29.800 --> 02:22:32.800
I don't know.

02:22:32.800 --> 02:22:37.120
Maybe it's something that they're gonna implement into one of their tablets?

02:22:37.120 --> 02:22:40.640
Maybe it'll be a cheaper option as opposed to getting a Vita, but then, like, why would

02:22:40.640 --> 02:22:45.520
you kind of bite the, you know, take away from one to give to the other?

02:22:45.520 --> 02:22:48.120
Like, it just seems a little weird.

02:22:48.120 --> 02:22:49.280
I don't know.

02:22:49.280 --> 02:22:53.920
I do like how the fact that they're a little generic console that they use on there looks

02:22:53.920 --> 02:22:57.820
like the same console that they have rendered in Grand Theft Auto.

02:22:57.820 --> 02:23:01.640
Their, like, generic Xbox PS3 console.

02:23:01.640 --> 02:23:02.640
It's kind of funny.

02:23:02.640 --> 02:23:03.640
All right.

02:23:03.640 --> 02:23:08.600
Well, let's move on and talk about, speaking of the Vita and all that, this is seriously

02:23:08.600 --> 02:23:13.160
the game that might convince me to get a Vita when the Vita's out, which is what, like,

02:23:13.160 --> 02:23:14.600
next week or two weeks, I think?

02:23:14.600 --> 02:23:16.520
The early release is next week, right?

02:23:16.520 --> 02:23:18.020
Yeah, Valentine's Day.

02:23:18.020 --> 02:23:19.020
Two weeks.

02:23:19.020 --> 02:23:20.020
Oh, no.

02:23:20.020 --> 02:23:21.020
They have their Valentine's Day.

02:23:21.020 --> 02:23:23.920
So we're not that far away from the Vita launch over here, and I gotta say, this is the game

02:23:23.920 --> 02:23:27.400
that makes me kind of sorry.

02:23:27.400 --> 02:23:31.520
I get so distracted because there's this giant Gotham City Impostors ad on the page, and

02:23:31.520 --> 02:23:33.840
it just makes me think about how this really disturbs Jamie.

02:23:33.840 --> 02:23:38.120
Like, she really doesn't like what this game is doing, even though she's never played it.

02:23:38.120 --> 02:23:39.760
I just don't like the concept.

02:23:39.760 --> 02:23:40.760
I know, I know.

02:23:40.760 --> 02:23:41.760
It'll be fun to me.

02:23:41.760 --> 02:23:44.560
I downloaded the beta, but I just haven't run it yet.

02:23:44.560 --> 02:23:47.640
Anyway, the game of the Vita.

02:23:47.640 --> 02:23:50.520
Luminous Electronic Symphony.

02:23:50.520 --> 02:23:51.520
Yay!

02:23:51.520 --> 02:23:55.020
I gotta say, the song list looks damn impressive.

02:23:55.020 --> 02:24:01.060
There is 34 tracks in it, and a lot of it is really good licensed stuff.

02:24:01.060 --> 02:24:07.840
There's stuff from Cascade, 4AM is in here, Bang Bang Bang, Mark Ronson, Disco Infiltrator

02:24:07.840 --> 02:24:12.560
by LCD Sound System, Allen will like that, Dissolve by the Chemical Brothers, Embracing

02:24:12.560 --> 02:24:18.440
the Future by BT, Flying High by Faithless, Good Girl by Benny Benassi, Hey Boy Hey Girl

02:24:18.440 --> 02:24:26.280
by the Chemical Brothers, an air song, Mylo, Orbital, System F, 808 State, Goldfrap, Aeroplane,

02:24:26.280 --> 02:24:31.200
Deep Dish, Aphex Twin, Pet Shop Boys, this looks fucking great.

02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:37.560
Like, I'm really excited about this game, so, and a lot of it sounds really awesome.

02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:42.720
So, yeah, if you haven't seen the song list for this, you probably want to head over to

02:24:42.720 --> 02:24:48.400
the Luminous page on Facebook and check this out, because, yeah, I'm definitely, if I pick

02:24:48.400 --> 02:24:53.680
up a Vita launch day, which is looking very likely, because I did my taxes, and I'm looking

02:24:53.680 --> 02:24:57.440
good, so I might be able to get one of these when they come out, so, I'm excited.

02:24:57.440 --> 02:24:59.760
I don't think my wife will let me have one.

02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:01.160
Aw, womp womp.

02:25:01.160 --> 02:25:04.400
I am considering selling my 3DS to get a Vita.

02:25:04.400 --> 02:25:05.400
To me.

02:25:05.400 --> 02:25:06.400
We'll see.

02:25:06.400 --> 02:25:11.720
Thinking about it, huh?

02:25:11.720 --> 02:25:16.480
The only drawback to the whole Luminous thing is that I am still feeling a little bit bitter

02:25:16.480 --> 02:25:21.240
about the fact that I've bought Luminous, like, five times now.

02:25:21.240 --> 02:25:26.080
Like what, there was Luminous, Luminous 2, Luminous PC, Luminous Xbox 360, I never did

02:25:26.080 --> 02:25:29.120
get the PlayStation 3 one, but I seriously thought about it.

02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:33.880
I'm not in a huge hurry to get a Vita, because, like, you know, the launch games are cool,

02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:39.840
and, you know, Konomari might be fun, but, it's not a, like, there's not anything that

02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:43.580
I must, must, must, must have on the Vita right now, it's kind of like, well, these

02:25:43.580 --> 02:25:50.800
are the ones I would pick, but, I don't know, it's, I might want to wait, you know, wait

02:25:50.800 --> 02:25:55.920
until fourth quarter or something like that, because really, I mean, I don't play my 3DS,

02:25:55.920 --> 02:26:01.720
I really don't play my 3DS, and, and I'm just kind of like, uhh, is there really something

02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:05.920
gonna come out that I'm gonna play my 3DS for, I mean, am I really gonna want to pick

02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:12.000
up, you know, Kid Icarus, and is it gonna be something that's gonna hold my attention?

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:13.000
Maybe not.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:14.000
I don't think so.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.280
And even Mario Kart's kind of just gone away.

02:26:16.280 --> 02:26:20.120
Brakeman in our chat says, I thought Loki was about to say, I'm thinking about selling

02:26:20.120 --> 02:26:22.320
my wife to get it.

02:26:22.320 --> 02:26:23.320
No.

02:26:23.320 --> 02:26:24.320
No.

02:26:24.320 --> 02:26:28.920
Can't do that.

02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:30.680
She'd complain about that.

02:26:30.680 --> 02:26:31.820
She would not like that.

02:26:31.820 --> 02:26:32.820
She would not like that.

02:26:32.820 --> 02:26:35.760
All right, just a few more stories for you guys, then we're gonna get to the Twitter

02:26:35.760 --> 02:26:41.960
topics and the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

02:26:41.960 --> 02:26:43.720
But first, a few more stories.

02:26:43.720 --> 02:26:44.720
Dark Sakura?

02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:48.760
Actually, I have to stop and correct, bones006.

02:26:48.760 --> 02:26:52.720
The letters U-R do not spell anything.

02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:54.440
It spells ur.

02:26:54.440 --> 02:27:04.160
It's Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E. Dear Lord, stop looking ignorant.

02:27:04.160 --> 02:27:08.320
When you have U-R, that's two-thirds of an urn, which Dark Sakura will have you end up

02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:13.520
in if you don't change your ways.

02:27:13.520 --> 02:27:15.360
Be nice to the listeners, Jamie.

02:27:15.360 --> 02:27:16.800
Be nice to the listeners.

02:27:16.800 --> 02:27:17.880
I am being nice.

02:27:17.880 --> 02:27:22.720
I'm doing them a serious favor that will help them get a job and earn the respect of people

02:27:22.720 --> 02:27:24.660
around them.

02:27:24.660 --> 02:27:28.480
So fuck your Yankee blue jeans.

02:27:28.480 --> 02:27:30.640
There was a part where you did video game news.

02:27:30.640 --> 02:27:38.800
Oh yeah, there was a comment by Kaz Hirai, who's going to be going in as CEO of Sony,

02:27:38.800 --> 02:27:42.000
and he thinks that Sony's kind of in trouble.

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:45.680
He spoke with the Wall Street Journal about their financial report.

02:27:45.680 --> 02:27:52.360
As you remember, they lost like 1.3 billion pounds, because I'm going off a British site,

02:27:52.360 --> 02:27:59.600
so, in their last financial quarter, and expect to report a loss of 2.9 billion dollars for

02:27:59.600 --> 02:28:01.480
the full year.

02:28:01.480 --> 02:28:06.920
That's, I think, was it the fourth year that they've been in the red?

02:28:06.920 --> 02:28:08.880
Something like that?

02:28:08.880 --> 02:28:15.040
Anyway, he said, and this is a quote, I thought turning around the PlayStation business was

02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:18.360
going to be the toughest challenge of my career, but I guess it's not.

02:28:18.360 --> 02:28:19.480
It's one issue after another.

02:28:19.480 --> 02:28:23.680
I feel like, holy shit, now what?

02:28:23.680 --> 02:28:30.120
And saying that his strategy for recovery basically means we're not going to wrestle

02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:34.820
my laurels anymore, we're going to really push the user experience.

02:28:34.820 --> 02:28:39.560
He says that they need to buckle down and be realistic, but people are coming around

02:28:39.560 --> 02:28:42.080
to the idea even though not everyone's on board.

02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:47.440
If they don't catch up, they're going to die.

02:28:47.440 --> 02:28:52.600
This just strikes me really weird that somebody like that would say, holy shit, now what?

02:28:52.600 --> 02:28:56.400
In an interview, but I mean, I'm looking at the source in the Wall Street Journal right

02:28:56.400 --> 02:28:57.400
here.

02:28:57.400 --> 02:28:58.400
There it is.

02:28:58.400 --> 02:28:59.400
That's, that's just weird.

02:28:59.400 --> 02:29:02.640
This strikes me as odd.

02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:05.840
I mean, we can swear all we want, but we're not CEOs of Sony.

02:29:05.840 --> 02:29:06.840
It's just weird.

02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:09.040
And that kid is flipping somebody off.

02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:12.360
Wow, he totally is in this little preview.

02:29:12.360 --> 02:29:13.360
I didn't know.

02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:14.360
Trailer for what?

02:29:14.360 --> 02:29:15.360
Chronicle.

02:29:15.360 --> 02:29:18.720
Isn't that that movie you were talking about a few weeks ago that you really wanted to

02:29:18.720 --> 02:29:19.720
see?

02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:20.720
They came out in theaters this week.

02:29:20.720 --> 02:29:21.720
Did you know that?

02:29:21.720 --> 02:29:23.280
I saw this.

02:29:23.280 --> 02:29:26.680
You don't say, did you go see it or did you see it?

02:29:26.680 --> 02:29:29.480
That just that, that ad makes me think, fuck you clouds.

02:29:29.480 --> 02:29:33.100
I know he's actually look at the clouds.

02:29:33.100 --> 02:29:34.100
They're flipping him off too.

02:29:34.100 --> 02:29:35.100
I don't know.

02:29:35.100 --> 02:29:36.100
Yeah.

02:29:36.100 --> 02:29:37.100
It's the clouds fingers too.

02:29:37.100 --> 02:29:38.100
That's kind of interesting.

02:29:38.100 --> 02:29:42.000
Anyway, so back to the story at hand.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:47.120
It's weird that Sony, I mean, I feel like Sony's in a better place now so much more

02:29:47.120 --> 02:29:49.200
than they were four years ago.

02:29:49.200 --> 02:29:53.320
Like they were a hot mess when PlayStation three late first came out, but now things

02:29:53.320 --> 02:29:57.400
are getting a little better, but there are still some big falls that they make.

02:29:57.400 --> 02:30:00.320
Like, I just don't think the move.

02:30:00.320 --> 02:30:06.560
I mean, as nice as the move is, I do think the move feels a lot better than the Wii as

02:30:06.560 --> 02:30:07.560
it should.

02:30:07.560 --> 02:30:11.120
The technology's a little newer, but they never really came out with that must have

02:30:11.120 --> 02:30:12.120
game for it.

02:30:12.120 --> 02:30:13.120
You know what I mean?

02:30:13.120 --> 02:30:15.300
Everything kind of felt like a copycat of the Wii.

02:30:15.300 --> 02:30:17.880
And I think that's part of where a lot of their losses come from.

02:30:17.880 --> 02:30:24.560
But at the same time, I pretty much play games on my PS3 almost exclusively right now, unless

02:30:24.560 --> 02:30:30.120
it's like exclusive on 360 or there's people I know on Xbox 360 that I can play the games

02:30:30.120 --> 02:30:33.520
with, you know, or like a deliberate multiplayer game.

02:30:33.520 --> 02:30:36.200
And all my friends are playing it on 360.

02:30:36.200 --> 02:30:40.400
So it's just interesting that Sony is losing all this money.

02:30:40.400 --> 02:30:48.520
But I guess now, is this considering other arms of Sony too, like not just PSP, but maybe

02:30:48.520 --> 02:30:53.560
like, or excuse me, just not just like PlayStation and that stuff, but like movies?

02:30:53.560 --> 02:30:56.120
I guess turn that around too.

02:30:56.120 --> 02:30:59.320
I think it's mostly non-gaming.

02:30:59.320 --> 02:31:00.840
I think it's more of their electronics.

02:31:00.840 --> 02:31:04.080
Because their electronics are fucking expensive.

02:31:04.080 --> 02:31:07.320
I mean, just insanely expensive.

02:31:07.320 --> 02:31:14.560
We got a, as like a promotion thing, we got a gift card to Sony, and their shit is so

02:31:14.560 --> 02:31:16.120
fucking expensive.

02:31:16.120 --> 02:31:17.120
It's just ridiculous.

02:31:17.120 --> 02:31:21.640
Like for stuff that's just, you know, half the price for something better elsewhere,

02:31:21.640 --> 02:31:26.640
it's just such a markup for the brand.

02:31:26.640 --> 02:31:33.080
Yeah, maybe when they kind of take the JC Penney approach, they'll cut all their prices

02:31:33.080 --> 02:31:34.080
by 40%.

02:31:34.080 --> 02:31:40.280
You know, I mean, not to say that, I mean, Sony stuff's alright, because I have a Sony

02:31:40.280 --> 02:31:46.800
camera, a Sony camcorder, a Sony sound system, a Sony TV, a Sony PlayStation 3, a Sony PSP.

02:31:46.800 --> 02:31:50.120
Of course, most of that stuff was given to me for free.

02:31:50.120 --> 02:31:53.480
But it's not bad.

02:31:53.480 --> 02:31:56.720
It's just really fucking expensive.

02:31:56.720 --> 02:32:05.000
JV Mon in chat says, four years ago, Sony stock was worth double than what it is now.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.400
After 2009, it's been pretty much downhill since.

02:32:07.400 --> 02:32:11.360
Well, yeah, I mean, I don't know, I guess maybe just from the limited perspective, where

02:32:11.360 --> 02:32:15.440
I think of Sony, I think of PlayStation, I think four years ago, they were a mess.

02:32:15.440 --> 02:32:18.440
And maybe there was excitement about the PlayStation 3 and all that, but they, you know, there

02:32:18.440 --> 02:32:20.760
were some huge missteps there for a couple years.

02:32:20.760 --> 02:32:22.800
Then things got back on the right track.

02:32:22.800 --> 02:32:25.400
And then they just, you know, they had the move happen.

02:32:25.400 --> 02:32:27.720
They had the hack happen.

02:32:27.720 --> 02:32:30.400
And you know, it's like they just kind of keep getting kicked down.

02:32:30.400 --> 02:32:37.040
So they get knocked down, but they get up again.

02:32:37.040 --> 02:32:38.920
All right.

02:32:38.920 --> 02:32:42.700
Anyhow, let's do another story, Loki.

02:32:42.700 --> 02:32:49.880
So let's talk a little bit about sales from a company that's struggling so hard to overcome

02:32:49.880 --> 02:32:52.600
use game sales.

02:32:52.600 --> 02:32:54.200
I feel so bad for these guys.

02:32:54.200 --> 02:32:58.560
I mean, EA has got it so hard, so hard.

02:32:58.560 --> 02:33:00.800
You said so hard.

02:33:00.800 --> 02:33:09.200
FIFA 12 and Battlefield 3 only sold 10 million units, only 10 million units.

02:33:09.200 --> 02:33:11.160
How do they manage?

02:33:11.160 --> 02:33:18.640
Madden, only 5 million units sold since August.

02:33:18.640 --> 02:33:19.780
Poor struggling company.

02:33:19.780 --> 02:33:20.780
I feel so bad.

02:33:20.780 --> 02:33:21.780
I'm going to go buy a new game.

02:33:21.780 --> 02:33:24.240
I'm going to buy all their games brand new tomorrow.

02:33:24.240 --> 02:33:27.640
Just going to go right out and buy all of them.

02:33:27.640 --> 02:33:30.120
Just because I think they're doing such a swell job.

02:33:30.120 --> 02:33:31.120
Or not.

02:33:31.120 --> 02:33:38.160
Um, Star Wars The Old Republic has sold 200 million copies, and they already have...

02:33:38.160 --> 02:33:39.160
No, no.

02:33:39.160 --> 02:33:40.160
I'm sorry.

02:33:40.160 --> 02:33:41.160
Not 200.

02:33:41.160 --> 02:33:42.160
Thank you.

02:33:42.160 --> 02:33:43.160
2 million.

02:33:43.160 --> 02:33:44.160
I'm like, no way.

02:33:44.160 --> 02:33:45.160
Sorry.

02:33:45.160 --> 02:33:52.960
They have 1.7 million households, and 1.7 million are active each day, on average.

02:33:52.960 --> 02:33:53.960
That's not bad.

02:33:53.960 --> 02:33:58.120
I mean, for a user base, especially when they talk like, you know, EA came out with their

02:33:58.120 --> 02:34:03.520
origin numbers where they said they have like 7 million user accounts or something like

02:34:03.520 --> 02:34:04.520
that.

02:34:04.520 --> 02:34:09.680
Which I'm sure a lot lesser than that percentage is active, but 1.7 out of 2 million is not

02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:10.680
bad.

02:34:10.680 --> 02:34:11.680
To be fair, yeah.

02:34:11.680 --> 02:34:16.080
Wow has, what, 10 million active subscribers right now, and at their peak, they had about

02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:17.080
12 million.

02:34:17.080 --> 02:34:19.520
I don't know how many copies of the game they've sold.

02:34:19.520 --> 02:34:20.520
I would guess...

02:34:20.520 --> 02:34:21.520
That's global.

02:34:21.520 --> 02:34:22.520
Probably like, yeah, it is global.

02:34:22.520 --> 02:34:25.440
15 or 20 million, probably at some point.

02:34:25.440 --> 02:34:29.600
And I mean, I mean, everybody can't be on that game every day.

02:34:29.600 --> 02:34:32.160
I mean, some people do have, you know, other things they gotta do.

02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:36.920
Well, I am one of those people in the Gap where I bought the game and I cancelled after

02:34:36.920 --> 02:34:37.920
the first month.

02:34:37.920 --> 02:34:40.680
I just didn't really want to keep playing.

02:34:40.680 --> 02:34:46.400
It's alright, I just think the game needs some tweaks and needs some improvements.

02:34:46.400 --> 02:34:54.800
And I don't know, some things happen in WoW and I'm playing WoW a lot more.

02:34:54.800 --> 02:35:01.520
And then of course, EA's had the benefit of some DLC sales, and they've done well with

02:35:01.520 --> 02:35:02.840
certain types of DLC.

02:35:02.840 --> 02:35:17.760
In fact, in just three months, FIFA 12's Ultimate Team DLC has generated $39 million in microtransactions.

02:35:17.760 --> 02:35:21.800
That's 69% more than it generated in the same period last year.

02:35:21.800 --> 02:35:22.800
Gee!

02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:23.800
I wonder why.

02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:24.800
Wonder why.

02:35:24.800 --> 02:35:29.360
I'm sorry, but when I heard EA gloating that statistic, I was like, that's insulting.

02:35:29.360 --> 02:35:34.000
That is insulting because you know where that money's coming from.

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:39.560
You know, like, I don't know, I kind of feel like in order to justify it, EA needed to

02:35:39.560 --> 02:35:43.520
say, oh, this is subtracting all the, you know, we didn't count the money that, you

02:35:43.520 --> 02:35:46.600
know, we had to give back because, you know, it was stolen or whatever.

02:35:46.600 --> 02:35:50.800
Like it's just, I don't know, like that was a really sore spot.

02:35:50.800 --> 02:35:54.360
Like I realized their need to gloat to appease the shareholders and all that stuff.

02:35:54.360 --> 02:35:57.800
But again, fucking stop denying that there's a problem.

02:35:57.800 --> 02:35:58.800
Stop it.

02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:01.440
Is EA giving back that money or is Microsoft giving back that money?

02:36:01.440 --> 02:36:02.440
It's a thing.

02:36:02.440 --> 02:36:04.440
Who's taking the hit on that?

02:36:04.440 --> 02:36:06.200
I don't know.

02:36:06.200 --> 02:36:07.200
It's all digital, so.

02:36:07.200 --> 02:36:10.120
I would imagine Microsoft takes back the money from EA.

02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:12.360
I mean, I imagine they have to.

02:36:12.360 --> 02:36:21.240
And then of course they're saying, you know, to put, according to the chief financial officer

02:36:21.240 --> 02:36:26.600
Eric Brown, to put some rough numbers on this, if we compare the total digital revenue from

02:36:26.600 --> 02:36:32.920
FIFA 11 Ultimate Team to what we expect from FIFA 12 Ultimate Team this fiscal year, we're

02:36:32.920 --> 02:36:37.000
looking to see a 25% increase franchise to franchise.

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:41.760
Yeah, I wonder where the 25% come from.

02:36:41.760 --> 02:36:46.680
Their overall packaged goods units sold is not increasing by 25%.

02:36:46.680 --> 02:36:47.680
Hmm.

02:36:47.680 --> 02:36:49.240
Gee.

02:36:49.240 --> 02:36:55.320
And so we're expanding by a decent margin the microtransactions, microtransaction revenue

02:36:55.320 --> 02:37:00.560
per user of FIFA.

02:37:00.560 --> 02:37:04.920
And then it's funny because, you know, like the people covering this, it's like, yeah,

02:37:04.920 --> 02:37:08.560
we continue to receive complaints nearly every day of non FIFA players having their accounts

02:37:08.560 --> 02:37:11.360
hacked to purchase Ultimate Team DLC.

02:37:11.360 --> 02:37:18.480
Oh yeah, I still hear about it on Twitter and I hear about it, you know, hacked on Xbox.

02:37:18.480 --> 02:37:22.720
You know, they're still writing down a bunch of, yeah, I forgot about that website.

02:37:22.720 --> 02:37:24.760
I check it all the time because I'm on their Twitter feed.

02:37:24.760 --> 02:37:29.880
I check it and they've got 30 stories on there right now and a lot more that get posted.

02:37:29.880 --> 02:37:33.880
She's kind of running behind on posting all that because she's getting a lot of emails,

02:37:33.880 --> 02:37:34.880
but sure.

02:37:34.880 --> 02:37:40.800
And there's some that I saw that were so ridiculous that like, Oh yeah, you know, we were going

02:37:40.800 --> 02:37:47.040
to re give you back your money, but we're not going to because you put your, like, you

02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:49.000
didn't put your full name on your account.

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:55.420
You just put like, it'd be like, if I didn't put Matthew, I put Matt on my account.

02:37:55.420 --> 02:38:00.000
That's bull because my legal name I don't have on my Xbox and I still got it.

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:03.160
Yeah, but see, they pulled that bullshit.

02:38:03.160 --> 02:38:04.160
Stupid.

02:38:04.160 --> 02:38:05.200
All right.

02:38:05.200 --> 02:38:08.960
I guess I should be thankful that I didn't have quite the nightmare problem a lot of

02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:11.680
people are having, although it did take a month.

02:38:11.680 --> 02:38:15.480
That's the average time, 20 or 25 days is what I've been hearing.

02:38:15.480 --> 02:38:16.480
Ridiculous.

02:38:16.480 --> 02:38:19.080
One more ridiculous story for you guys.

02:38:19.080 --> 02:38:23.160
Remember last week we were talking about the whole Zynga, uh, the rip off artists where

02:38:23.160 --> 02:38:28.320
they were making their own, like was dream Heights, uh, was a complete knockoff of tiny

02:38:28.320 --> 02:38:29.320
tower.

02:38:29.320 --> 02:38:32.360
Well, Zynga finally came out and made a statement on the whole thing.

02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:36.920
Uh, and it went along these lines, Mark Pincus, who's the head of Zynga quote, you should

02:38:36.920 --> 02:38:41.320
be careful not to throw stones when you live in glass houses.

02:38:41.320 --> 02:38:45.580
When you pull the lens back, you saw that their tower game looks similar to five other

02:38:45.580 --> 02:38:57.760
tower games going all the way back to sim tower in the early 1990s bull shit, bull shit.

02:38:57.760 --> 02:39:03.860
That comparison of tiny tower to sim tower is a lazy, ignorant comparison that tells

02:39:03.860 --> 02:39:09.920
me you have never played sim tower in your life because sim tower was way, I mean in

02:39:09.920 --> 02:39:16.000
a way sim tower is a more complex, smarter game than tiny tower.

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:20.200
That's not a knock on tiny tower because the great thing about tiny tower is that it's

02:39:20.200 --> 02:39:24.280
great for a 30, 45 second, one minute fix.

02:39:24.280 --> 02:39:28.720
That's what that game is for, but there is not nearly the level of micromanaging that

02:39:28.720 --> 02:39:30.260
there is in sim tower.

02:39:30.260 --> 02:39:31.820
You know what those games have in common?

02:39:31.820 --> 02:39:33.740
They're both about skyscrapers.

02:39:33.740 --> 02:39:34.740
That's it.

02:39:34.740 --> 02:39:36.040
And they have tower in the name.

02:39:36.040 --> 02:39:39.580
Like you don't really manage the people in sim tower.

02:39:39.580 --> 02:39:44.840
You manage your tower, you manage the escalators, the elevators, what type of businesses you're

02:39:44.840 --> 02:39:45.840
putting in.

02:39:45.840 --> 02:39:53.680
It's just, it's a lazy, lazy comparison, especially when their game is such a blatant, you know,

02:39:53.680 --> 02:39:55.760
rip off of all the mechanics.

02:39:55.760 --> 02:39:59.260
Sim tower is not like tiny tower in that way.

02:39:59.260 --> 02:40:05.480
And then moving on in an internal memo to associates, here's how they justify it.

02:40:05.480 --> 02:40:09.160
Quote, Google didn't create the first search engine.

02:40:09.160 --> 02:40:12.560
Apple didn't create the first MP3 player or tablet.

02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:15.540
And Facebook didn't create the first social network.

02:40:15.540 --> 02:40:19.940
But these companies have evolved products and categories in revolutionary ways.

02:40:19.940 --> 02:40:24.000
They are all internet treasures because they all have specific and broad missions to change

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:25.000
the world.

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:29.600
If that wasn't blowing smoke up their employees ass, I don't know what was.

02:40:29.600 --> 02:40:32.940
Because seriously, how is that the same?

02:40:32.940 --> 02:40:33.940
How is that the same?

02:40:33.940 --> 02:40:34.940
It's not.

02:40:34.940 --> 02:40:37.480
Google didn't create the first search engine.

02:40:37.480 --> 02:40:40.960
That's true, but they created the best search engine.

02:40:40.960 --> 02:40:46.200
Okay, so tiny tower didn't create the first tower game.

02:40:46.200 --> 02:40:49.520
But they created a really good one for iOS systems.

02:40:49.520 --> 02:40:51.800
And you fucking jacked it all and made new art.

02:40:51.800 --> 02:40:52.800
That's it.

02:40:52.800 --> 02:40:57.720
Google didn't copy the code for Yahoo and change the name to Google on it.

02:40:57.720 --> 02:41:03.480
And Google actually has, it's like their whole search process is done by all kinds of different

02:41:03.480 --> 02:41:04.480
calculations, too.

02:41:04.480 --> 02:41:08.800
I mean, it's really complex.

02:41:08.800 --> 02:41:09.800
It's just...

02:41:09.800 --> 02:41:13.600
And then they've taken Google and made a full spectrum product out of it.

02:41:13.600 --> 02:41:14.600
This is their MSC.

02:41:14.600 --> 02:41:21.640
I used to give Gameloft crap for ripping off games like Halo and stuff like that and coming

02:41:21.640 --> 02:41:22.640
up with their own.

02:41:22.640 --> 02:41:23.640
But you know what?

02:41:23.640 --> 02:41:24.640
They came up with their own game.

02:41:24.640 --> 02:41:27.040
Yes, the genre looks exactly the same as Halo.

02:41:27.040 --> 02:41:29.820
It's a futuristic thing, it kind of resembles stuff.

02:41:29.820 --> 02:41:33.760
But it's not a fucking like, oh, we took Halo and we reskinned everything.

02:41:33.760 --> 02:41:40.040
Now it's, you know, Circle or Space Circle.

02:41:40.040 --> 02:41:44.920
Brakeman in our chat room says, Zinga is currently making a podcast called Red Lounge Radio.

02:41:44.920 --> 02:41:47.800
It will be on the More Than All Games Network.

02:41:47.800 --> 02:41:50.200
He actually fooled somebody in chat.

02:41:50.200 --> 02:41:51.200
Really?

02:41:51.200 --> 02:41:55.960
Frisbee says, dear everyone who plays Zinga games, please stop being a person that plays

02:41:55.960 --> 02:41:56.960
Zinga games.

02:41:56.960 --> 02:41:58.200
Love humans everywhere.

02:41:58.200 --> 02:42:05.400
Jvmon brings out the harsh reality, chat.orangelaunchradio.com saying, Zinga's stock doubled after the Facebook

02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:06.400
IPO this week.

02:42:06.400 --> 02:42:09.800
Well, when you see how really dependent they were on each other, as if you didn't already

02:42:09.800 --> 02:42:14.680
know, I mean, Facebook in their filing basically had to say a lot more about the internal workings

02:42:14.680 --> 02:42:15.680
of their company.

02:42:15.680 --> 02:42:20.120
And one of those things is that they kind of fucking rely on Zinga for people to return

02:42:20.120 --> 02:42:22.760
visit to Facebook, just like Zinga fucking relies on Facebook.

02:42:22.760 --> 02:42:25.780
Because didn't Zinga try to make their own portal?

02:42:25.780 --> 02:42:29.500
Like, I remember there was a time where Zinga was like, well, we don't really, like, remember

02:42:29.500 --> 02:42:32.020
when Google Plus was gonna murder everything?

02:42:32.020 --> 02:42:35.000
And Zinga was like, well, we don't really need Facebook.

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:40.520
We're gonna get everybody to come to our Zinga game, you know, Zinga book, or whatever they

02:42:40.520 --> 02:42:41.520
were gonna do.

02:42:41.520 --> 02:42:44.040
Yeah, I could see them doing that shit.

02:42:44.040 --> 02:42:46.480
We'll make our own social network.

02:42:46.480 --> 02:42:47.480
That's right.

02:42:47.480 --> 02:42:54.000
We're just gonna copy paste Facebook, and we're gonna call it Portrait Journal.

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:58.360
Now one final note on this whole story, Nimblebit, who made Tiny Tower, did not let this all

02:42:58.360 --> 02:43:00.680
go by unscathed.

02:43:00.680 --> 02:43:06.320
The co-founder Ian Marsh talked to Touch Arcade and said, quote, it was a smart idea for Mark

02:43:06.320 --> 02:43:10.720
Pincus and Zinga to try and lump all games with the name Tower together as an actual

02:43:10.720 --> 02:43:14.080
genre whose games borrow from each other.

02:43:14.080 --> 02:43:18.400
Sharing a name or a setting does not a genre make.

02:43:18.400 --> 02:43:19.800
Agreed.

02:43:19.800 --> 02:43:26.920
For example, 13 Ghosts may be about a haunted house, but it's not the same kind of movie

02:43:26.920 --> 02:43:30.680
as High Spirits, for example.

02:43:30.680 --> 02:43:34.880
They also, there was another game that was like some sort of bingo game or something

02:43:34.880 --> 02:43:38.720
like that that they were also shown ripping off of, and there was also a poker game that

02:43:38.720 --> 02:43:41.120
they also ripped off of.

02:43:41.120 --> 02:43:42.120
This is their ML.

02:43:42.120 --> 02:43:43.120
This is what they do.

02:43:43.120 --> 02:43:44.120
And you know what?

02:43:44.120 --> 02:43:46.520
No one can really fight them because their change, what they're doing is they're going

02:43:46.520 --> 02:43:52.880
in, they're trying to change as much as they need to, to not get a lawsuit thrown at them.

02:43:52.880 --> 02:44:01.560
Jamie, is that like saying the movie Independence Day isn't really about the 4th of July?

02:44:01.560 --> 02:44:09.480
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, the Skype line is open now.

02:44:09.480 --> 02:44:12.600
Give us a call if you want to talk about anything we've talked about tonight, or maybe there's

02:44:12.600 --> 02:44:17.520
something we missed that you wanted to bring up, or hell, I don't know, just call us if

02:44:17.520 --> 02:44:18.520
you want to say hello.

02:44:18.520 --> 02:44:23.440
We do have a reduced amount of live listeners tonight because of football games and so forth,

02:44:23.440 --> 02:44:28.840
but I do see there are some of you listening there in our chat room, the few, the loyal

02:44:28.840 --> 02:44:29.840
at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

02:44:29.840 --> 02:44:34.680
So go ahead and call us, 1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:44:34.680 --> 02:44:35.680
All right.

02:44:35.680 --> 02:44:39.960
Meanwhile, we're going to do some tweets, and what, did you have something, Loki, you

02:44:39.960 --> 02:44:40.960
want to add?

02:44:40.960 --> 02:44:41.960
Just real quick.

02:44:41.960 --> 02:44:48.520
Apparently there's a PlayStation Network update that just happened that has blocked users

02:44:48.520 --> 02:44:52.200
from accessing their paid content in the PAL territories.

02:44:52.200 --> 02:44:54.800
Oh, it's like, what?

02:44:54.800 --> 02:45:00.840
Apparently it's those, you know, who have done the update are getting an error labeled

02:45:00.840 --> 02:45:07.200
as 800-231-02, which helpfully informs them that no content was found when the user tries

02:45:07.200 --> 02:45:12.120
to download or re-download PlayStation Network content they've already purchased.

02:45:12.120 --> 02:45:14.200
All right.

02:45:14.200 --> 02:45:17.880
Going to our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:22.100
You know, not a lot of activities on Twitter either, although there were some nice tweets.

02:45:22.100 --> 02:45:24.640
I'll read some of these like nice tweets that are there.

02:45:24.640 --> 02:45:27.000
Breakman says, I might show up later for OLR.

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:30.240
I'll be pretty drunk though, so good luck to them.

02:45:30.240 --> 02:45:36.760
And Curly K. T. K. on Twitter says, putting the Super Bowl on mute to listen to OLR.

02:45:36.760 --> 02:45:37.760
Good job.

02:45:37.760 --> 02:45:38.760
Good job.

02:45:38.760 --> 02:45:39.760
All right.

02:45:39.760 --> 02:45:40.760
We do have some calls coming in.

02:45:40.760 --> 02:45:41.760
So let's go to the phones.

02:45:41.760 --> 02:45:42.760
Hi, you're on Orange On The Radio.

02:45:42.760 --> 02:45:43.760
Who's this?

02:45:43.760 --> 02:45:47.520
Hey, it's the guy who's normally CD Thunder and chat, but tonight I'm God of Thunder.

02:45:47.520 --> 02:45:48.520
How are you all doing?

02:45:48.520 --> 02:45:49.520
Good.

02:45:49.520 --> 02:45:50.520
How are you?

02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:51.520
God of Thunder?

02:45:51.520 --> 02:45:52.520
Not too bad.

02:45:52.520 --> 02:45:54.000
I've got a couple of quick things I'd like to talk about.

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:55.000
Yeah.

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.560
What do you want to talk about?

02:45:57.560 --> 02:46:00.880
First off quickly, I'd like to talk about Darkness 2.

02:46:00.880 --> 02:46:02.680
Darkness 2.

02:46:02.680 --> 02:46:04.880
Is this the one that's coming out or is this the one that was out?

02:46:04.880 --> 02:46:06.920
This is the one that's coming out on Tuesday.

02:46:06.920 --> 02:46:07.920
Okay.

02:46:07.920 --> 02:46:10.480
What do you want to talk about Darkness 2?

02:46:10.480 --> 02:46:16.840
Well, from what I've seen in the demo, this game looks completely over the top and gory

02:46:16.840 --> 02:46:21.160
and sick and it just looks really awesome.

02:46:21.160 --> 02:46:25.920
I wish I could actually play it, but yeah, it just looks really awesome.

02:46:25.920 --> 02:46:31.000
This is the game looks over the top and gory and disgusting and I love it.

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:36.600
That's like how I felt after I played the Bayonetta demo.

02:46:36.600 --> 02:46:40.840
So are you going to pre-order your copy of Darkness 2?

02:46:40.840 --> 02:46:47.560
Well, as I said before, I don't actually have the system to play it on, but if I did, I

02:46:47.560 --> 02:46:48.560
would.

02:46:48.560 --> 02:46:49.560
Well, you know what you have to do?

02:46:49.560 --> 02:46:50.560
You're going to have to steal one.

02:46:50.560 --> 02:46:51.560
No, I'm just kidding.

02:46:51.560 --> 02:46:52.560
Don't steal.

02:46:52.560 --> 02:46:53.560
Don't steal.

02:46:53.560 --> 02:46:54.560
No, no, no.

02:46:54.560 --> 02:46:55.560
All right.

02:46:55.560 --> 02:47:00.720
Well, do you have a friend who might buy it?

02:47:00.720 --> 02:47:05.160
Sometimes we have a rich friend who has all that stuff, like growing up, I didn't get

02:47:05.160 --> 02:47:07.920
a Super Nintendo when they first came out, but my rich friend did, so I'd go over to

02:47:07.920 --> 02:47:08.920
his house.

02:47:08.920 --> 02:47:13.600
Well, I don't know if anybody that I know would get it or not.

02:47:13.600 --> 02:47:14.840
I just really don't know.

02:47:14.840 --> 02:47:15.840
All right.

02:47:15.840 --> 02:47:17.280
Well, that's all right.

02:47:17.280 --> 02:47:21.740
But the other thing I'd like to talk about quickly is I was talking to a friend of mine

02:47:21.740 --> 02:47:28.400
today and apparently can actually get a classic Nintendo Entertainment System controller,

02:47:28.400 --> 02:47:35.040
USB, and plug it into your USB port in the computer and use that to play Nintendo Entertainment

02:47:35.040 --> 02:47:39.080
System games on the website that I linked to the chat room a few minutes earlier.

02:47:39.080 --> 02:47:40.080
What was the website?

02:47:40.080 --> 02:47:41.080
Because you sent us the email.

02:47:41.080 --> 02:47:42.080
You're the same guy who sent us the email.

02:47:42.080 --> 02:47:43.080
We didn't get the website.

02:47:43.080 --> 02:47:44.080
What is it?

02:47:44.080 --> 02:47:45.080
It's retrouprising.com.

02:47:45.080 --> 02:47:48.840
Now, is this going to install porn bots on my computer?

02:47:48.840 --> 02:47:54.800
Because you know how some of these emulation sites carry porn bots.

02:47:54.800 --> 02:47:59.760
And you know, one minute I'm playing Super Mario Brothers and the next minute, vagina!

02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:02.400
No, I've tested out some of this stuff.

02:48:02.400 --> 02:48:04.400
A lot of it works.

02:48:04.400 --> 02:48:05.400
Extensively?

02:48:05.400 --> 02:48:06.400
Yeah.

02:48:06.400 --> 02:48:07.400
Okay.

02:48:07.400 --> 02:48:08.400
Just checking.

02:48:08.400 --> 02:48:14.480
Well, what retro games have you rediscovered through the website?

02:48:14.480 --> 02:48:19.840
Well, they have stuff like Ice Climber, Donkey Kong, stuff like that.

02:48:19.840 --> 02:48:25.600
But some of the Super Nintendo games, you actually have to have an emulator, I believe,

02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:30.880
which unfortunately I do not have.

02:48:30.880 --> 02:48:33.880
But you have the internet one, right?

02:48:33.880 --> 02:48:34.880
Through the website?

02:48:34.880 --> 02:48:41.840
Well, I'm able to do the, like, the Sega Genesis and the Nintendo Entertainment System games,

02:48:41.840 --> 02:48:47.480
but for some reason it says it has a bar that shows the emulator is loading, then they get

02:48:47.480 --> 02:48:49.520
a black screen.

02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:53.200
Maybe update Java or try a different browser.

02:48:53.200 --> 02:48:54.200
I don't know.

02:48:54.200 --> 02:48:55.640
That's what I would do.

02:48:55.640 --> 02:48:58.600
Or it's installing vagina all over your computer.

02:48:58.600 --> 02:48:59.600
That could be what's happening.

02:48:59.600 --> 02:49:02.840
I'm just saying, you've got to be very careful about some of these websites.

02:49:02.840 --> 02:49:04.600
You've got an infestation of vagina.

02:49:04.600 --> 02:49:05.600
That's right.

02:49:05.600 --> 02:49:10.960
But yeah, I'll probably get the NES controller and use that to play some of those NES games,

02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:11.960
which are pretty awesome.

02:49:11.960 --> 02:49:15.320
Are you going to get one of those NES controllers that's like just a USB?

02:49:15.320 --> 02:49:16.320
Yeah.

02:49:16.320 --> 02:49:17.320
Gotcha.

02:49:17.320 --> 02:49:18.320
All right.

02:49:18.320 --> 02:49:19.320
Very cool.

02:49:19.320 --> 02:49:20.320
All right.

02:49:20.320 --> 02:49:23.320
Well, any other thoughts before we let you go?

02:49:23.320 --> 02:49:24.320
Hmm.

02:49:24.320 --> 02:49:29.320
Well, I hope you guys continue doing what you're doing for quite a while.

02:49:29.320 --> 02:49:38.720
You guys keep all of us entertaining, me included, and just history of good health and so forth

02:49:38.720 --> 02:49:40.360
and so on, et cetera, et cetera.

02:49:40.360 --> 02:49:41.360
That's pretty much it.

02:49:41.360 --> 02:49:42.960
Well, we appreciate it.

02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:45.640
It's kind comments like that that keep us going because, you know, we don't make any

02:49:45.640 --> 02:49:46.680
money off this show.

02:49:46.680 --> 02:49:49.400
That's why I have to have rich friends.

02:49:49.400 --> 02:49:50.400
All right.

02:49:50.400 --> 02:49:51.400
Have a good one.

02:49:51.400 --> 02:49:52.400
Yeah, you too.

02:49:52.400 --> 02:49:53.400
Later.

02:49:53.400 --> 02:49:54.400
Bye.

02:49:54.400 --> 02:49:55.400
Bye.

02:49:55.400 --> 02:49:57.280
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.

02:49:57.280 --> 02:50:04.000
Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.600
Meanwhile, more Twitter topics.

02:50:06.600 --> 02:50:12.280
Tigerclaw always sending us a few stories that we may have overlooked.

02:50:12.280 --> 02:50:14.360
Tigerclaw on Twitter tweets us this.

02:50:14.360 --> 02:50:19.520
Apple removes several iOS copycat games from one offending developer.

02:50:19.520 --> 02:50:23.480
So finally, this is funny that all the stuff we were talking about last week about the

02:50:23.480 --> 02:50:29.120
whole copycat crap is starting to kind of come to light, and Apple's taken action against

02:50:29.120 --> 02:50:30.120
some of it.

02:50:30.120 --> 02:50:31.120
Let's see.

02:50:31.120 --> 02:50:35.000
A blow is, again, I'm reading this story for the first time because Tigerclaw sent it to

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:36.000
us.

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:37.000
It's from Gamasutra.

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:41.020
It says, Apple struck a blow against video game clones today by removing several offending

02:50:41.020 --> 02:50:44.560
apps from one rather prolific independent developer.

02:50:44.560 --> 02:50:53.360
The games were Plant vs. Zombie, as in the one plant against one zombie, Angry Ninja

02:50:53.360 --> 02:51:00.060
Birds, and Temple Jump, which is a knockoff of a game called Temple Run, which is funny

02:51:00.060 --> 02:51:04.720
because Temple Jump actually was having some success on the app store, and yeah, we actually

02:51:04.720 --> 02:51:07.740
got all the way to the top of the paid app chart.

02:51:07.740 --> 02:51:12.940
The independent developer of the games, Anton Sinakov, and according to a Twitter post from

02:51:12.940 --> 02:51:19.580
another iOS developer, this developer had 68 iOS apps available this morning, and now

02:51:19.580 --> 02:51:21.680
only nine remain.

02:51:21.680 --> 02:51:22.920
Wow.

02:51:22.920 --> 02:51:25.980
Let's see.

02:51:25.980 --> 02:51:32.680
One of the developers who was copied in this case, Imangi, says, we were really happy with

02:51:32.680 --> 02:51:37.200
how quickly Apple responded to the situation and removed Temple Jump.

02:51:37.200 --> 02:51:42.440
The app was clearly a scam that traded entirely on the popularity of Temple Run and was packaged

02:51:42.440 --> 02:51:44.160
to confuse users.

02:51:44.160 --> 02:51:45.160
Booyah.

02:51:45.160 --> 02:51:49.560
A mole cart's gone now, right?

02:51:49.560 --> 02:51:53.200
Now my question is, when are they going to start taking down the Zynga games?

02:51:53.200 --> 02:51:54.200
Probably never.

02:51:54.200 --> 02:51:56.160
But anyway, we're getting another call, so let's go to the phones.

02:51:56.160 --> 02:51:57.600
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:51:57.600 --> 02:51:58.600
Who's this?

02:51:58.600 --> 02:51:59.600
Tesler.

02:51:59.600 --> 02:52:05.600
Log in and play.

02:52:05.600 --> 02:52:09.700
Are you calling to harass me to get me to come play WoW when I'm trying to do a show

02:52:09.700 --> 02:52:11.700
on the internets?

02:52:11.700 --> 02:52:13.820
Maybe.

02:52:13.820 --> 02:52:18.080
Who told you how to find my show?

02:52:18.080 --> 02:52:21.920
I don't even have to ask.

02:52:21.920 --> 02:52:22.920
Let me ask you some questions.

02:52:22.920 --> 02:52:25.080
Well, first off, introduce yourself to the listeners.

02:52:25.080 --> 02:52:26.840
Who am I speaking with?

02:52:26.840 --> 02:52:27.840
All right.

02:52:27.840 --> 02:52:34.760
So for all four of you out there who are listening, this is Mel Dool, and I play with your gracious

02:52:34.760 --> 02:52:37.560
host on a game called World of Warcraft.

02:52:37.560 --> 02:52:41.680
So Dark Soccer, this is one of the people that's in that guild I joined over on Proudmoore's

02:52:41.680 --> 02:52:42.680
server.

02:52:42.680 --> 02:52:43.680
You mean the one that I'm in?

02:52:43.680 --> 02:52:44.680
Yes.

02:52:44.680 --> 02:52:45.680
Now?

02:52:45.680 --> 02:52:46.680
Yeah, you just joined not that long ago.

02:52:46.680 --> 02:52:47.680
Yeah.

02:52:47.680 --> 02:52:48.680
Hi.

02:52:48.680 --> 02:52:49.680
So he's calling to harass me.

02:52:49.680 --> 02:52:50.680
Hey, what's going on?

02:52:50.680 --> 02:52:51.680
He says that instead of doing the show, I should be playing WoW with him.

02:52:51.680 --> 02:52:53.680
The show that I've been doing for 10 years.

02:52:53.680 --> 02:52:54.680
Do you need Dungeons Run?

02:52:54.680 --> 02:52:55.680
Do you need Valor Points?

02:52:55.680 --> 02:52:58.680
Do you need LFR?

02:52:58.680 --> 02:53:02.160
I need all those things and a port.

02:53:02.160 --> 02:53:03.160
You need a port.

02:53:03.160 --> 02:53:04.880
He needs a port.

02:53:04.880 --> 02:53:05.880
So I have to sign in.

02:53:05.880 --> 02:53:07.480
Welcome to my life.

02:53:07.480 --> 02:53:08.480
I know.

02:53:08.480 --> 02:53:09.480
Because this is the funny thing.

02:53:09.480 --> 02:53:14.680
Dark Sakura plays an Arcane Mage on Alliance side, and now I have this Arcane Mage on Horde.

02:53:14.680 --> 02:53:15.680
Port please.

02:53:15.680 --> 02:53:16.680
Port please.

02:53:16.680 --> 02:53:17.680
Right?

02:53:17.680 --> 02:53:18.680
5G.

02:53:18.680 --> 02:53:19.680
Right?

02:53:19.680 --> 02:53:20.680
Well, I'll do that since that's like what?

02:53:20.680 --> 02:53:21.680
500% inflation?

02:53:21.680 --> 02:53:22.680
Exactly.

02:53:22.680 --> 02:53:25.840
But now I've learned after your story earlier this evening, I'll never get paid for it.

02:53:25.840 --> 02:53:28.920
People will just swindle me like you did that poor death knight.

02:53:28.920 --> 02:53:31.160
No, you make them pay you and then you open the portal.

02:53:31.160 --> 02:53:32.160
I see.

02:53:32.160 --> 02:53:33.160
Alright.

02:53:33.160 --> 02:53:34.160
Exactly.

02:53:34.160 --> 02:53:37.960
Well, look, Meladoul, do you play any other video games besides WoW?

02:53:37.960 --> 02:53:44.120
I, I, oh wait, I gotta turn myself down here because I can hear myself talking.

02:53:44.120 --> 02:53:47.040
Yeah, it's always a little awkward, especially when there's a huge delay.

02:53:47.040 --> 02:53:48.040
Right.

02:53:48.040 --> 02:53:51.360
Even though I do sound pretty good on the radio, maybe I should have my own radio show.

02:53:51.360 --> 02:53:52.360
Me too.

02:53:52.360 --> 02:53:53.360
Me too.

02:53:53.360 --> 02:53:54.800
That's why I've been doing this so long is I sound great on the radio.

02:53:54.800 --> 02:53:56.400
I'm just like listening to himself talk.

02:53:56.400 --> 02:53:57.400
I do.

02:53:57.400 --> 02:53:58.400
I do.

02:53:58.400 --> 02:54:02.800
Well, hey, at the risk of like completely losing all of my sex life by, by admitting

02:54:02.800 --> 02:54:09.000
these things, um, I will admit to playing a little Final Fantasy, uh, here and there.

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.120
And, uh, I, what else do I play?

02:54:11.120 --> 02:54:17.400
I was a huge, huge EverQuest gamer for a long time before that, uh, the time.

02:54:17.400 --> 02:54:18.400
Oh, gosh, EverQuest.

02:54:18.400 --> 02:54:21.000
That, that's, that's a lot of geek points right there.

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.640
RIP EverQuest, RIP.

02:54:23.640 --> 02:54:26.760
Which Final Fantasy, which Final Fantasy, because there's a lot of them.

02:54:26.760 --> 02:54:31.520
There's one through 13 and now there's 13, two and 10, two and zero.

02:54:31.520 --> 02:54:34.280
I don't even know how to count that high in Roman numerals.

02:54:34.280 --> 02:54:40.280
Like I'm just like Final Fantasy X, X, X porn, X, I.

02:54:40.280 --> 02:54:43.440
There actually was a Final Fuck X in Japan.

02:54:43.440 --> 02:54:44.440
Perfect.

02:54:44.440 --> 02:54:45.440
I have this.

02:54:45.440 --> 02:54:46.620
I can play that.

02:54:46.620 --> 02:54:48.520
It's basically just bad cosplay boinging.

02:54:48.520 --> 02:54:49.520
Yeah.

02:54:49.520 --> 02:54:52.280
It's basically just chicks dressed up as the characters in Final Fantasy 10 and they get

02:54:52.280 --> 02:54:53.280
fucked.

02:54:53.280 --> 02:54:58.280
And the weird thing about Japanese porn is that they have to blur the penetration.

02:54:58.280 --> 02:54:59.280
So yeah.

02:54:59.280 --> 02:55:00.280
Yeah.

02:55:00.280 --> 02:55:01.640
And then the guys aren't dressed up.

02:55:01.640 --> 02:55:03.800
The guys are just like, Hey, I'm here to fuck Yuna.

02:55:03.800 --> 02:55:04.800
Okay.

02:55:04.800 --> 02:55:08.560
Well see, you gotta be careful because you could, if you're not, if you don't blur it,

02:55:08.560 --> 02:55:11.280
you could have an infestation of vagina.

02:55:11.280 --> 02:55:12.280
That's true.

02:55:12.280 --> 02:55:13.280
That's true.

02:55:13.280 --> 02:55:14.280
Just like the last caller.

02:55:14.280 --> 02:55:16.240
If you're on a bad website, you just knock, knock.

02:55:16.240 --> 02:55:17.240
Who's there?

02:55:17.240 --> 02:55:19.560
Too much vagina is never a good thing.

02:55:19.560 --> 02:55:21.560
You want to get moderation.

02:55:21.560 --> 02:55:22.560
Never.

02:55:22.560 --> 02:55:23.560
Never.

02:55:23.560 --> 02:55:24.560
Never.

02:55:24.560 --> 02:55:25.560
So yeah.

02:55:25.560 --> 02:55:26.560
Um, yeah, totally.

02:55:26.560 --> 02:55:29.000
That's, that's, uh, those are the games that I played for a while.

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:30.000
I love tactics.

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:32.160
That was my, that was my big thing.

02:55:32.160 --> 02:55:34.600
Final Fantasy Tactics was a great game.

02:55:34.600 --> 02:55:35.600
It was a great game.

02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:36.600
Final Fantasy Tactics was awesome.

02:55:36.600 --> 02:55:41.840
And then they, what they have the versions on, uh, what systems, uh, Game Boy Advance

02:55:41.840 --> 02:55:44.080
had one and then they ported it.

02:55:44.080 --> 02:55:48.080
Ah, there's another one on, uh, Iniscacy.

02:55:48.080 --> 02:55:49.080
Didn't they make another port?

02:55:49.080 --> 02:55:50.080
It was a PSP.

02:55:50.080 --> 02:55:51.080
It was just a PSP.

02:55:51.080 --> 02:55:52.080
Yeah.

02:55:52.080 --> 02:55:53.080
That was the only one.

02:55:53.080 --> 02:55:54.080
All right.

02:55:54.080 --> 02:56:02.840
Well, I, I, I loved Final Fantasy two with like, you know, the U S version where it was

02:56:02.840 --> 02:56:05.520
like Final Fantasy three or something in Japan.

02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:06.520
They couldn't get it right.

02:56:06.520 --> 02:56:07.520
I don't know.

02:56:07.520 --> 02:56:08.520
Yeah.

02:56:08.520 --> 02:56:09.520
It was, it was awesome.

02:56:09.520 --> 02:56:10.520
But you know what?

02:56:10.520 --> 02:56:13.400
I will, I will stop harassing you and let you get to your radio show.

02:56:13.400 --> 02:56:14.400
All right.

02:56:14.400 --> 02:56:15.400
I appreciate it.

02:56:15.400 --> 02:56:16.400
Totally.

02:56:16.400 --> 02:56:17.400
You know, cut it short.

02:56:17.400 --> 02:56:18.400
I need a port.

02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:19.400
All right.

02:56:19.400 --> 02:56:22.520
Well, you might have to buy one unless you want to wait till about 11 o'clock my time

02:56:22.520 --> 02:56:23.520
when I'll finally sign in.

02:56:23.520 --> 02:56:24.520
Unacceptable.

02:56:24.520 --> 02:56:25.520
All right.

02:56:25.520 --> 02:56:27.520
Have a good one.

02:56:27.520 --> 02:56:31.400
And I'm really sorry that now you're not going to get laid for like six weeks cause you admitted

02:56:31.400 --> 02:56:32.400
things on air.

02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:33.400
All right.

02:56:33.400 --> 02:56:35.400
I'll talk to you later.

02:56:35.400 --> 02:56:36.400
Bye.

02:56:36.400 --> 02:56:41.040
One eight seven seven Game O L R username on Skype is orange lounge radio.

02:56:41.040 --> 02:56:44.400
It's very, uh, amusing.

02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:45.400
Don't let it fool you.

02:56:45.400 --> 02:56:46.400
He's a total asshole.

02:56:46.400 --> 02:56:47.400
No, I'm kidding.

02:56:47.400 --> 02:56:48.400
I'm kidding.

02:56:48.400 --> 02:56:52.240
I've really been, I like everybody in that guild so far.

02:56:52.240 --> 02:56:54.400
We've been pretty, pretty nice people.

02:56:54.400 --> 02:56:56.040
You know, I have that Shane guy.

02:56:56.040 --> 02:56:58.440
Yeah, he's an ass.

02:56:58.440 --> 02:57:03.280
But the first, the first, like I joined that guild because I knew that they were doing

02:57:03.280 --> 02:57:06.480
some rating and that they were just starting and I was like, all right, well, you know,

02:57:06.480 --> 02:57:07.480
cause nothing's happening on Alliance.

02:57:07.480 --> 02:57:08.480
Why not?

02:57:08.480 --> 02:57:10.000
I'm going to try this to work out my heart.

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:15.120
The first night I went on the raid with the group, I was like, this might be a bit of

02:57:15.120 --> 02:57:16.120
a hot mess.

02:57:16.120 --> 02:57:17.120
I don't know.

02:57:17.120 --> 02:57:21.560
But, um, you know, the next week actually we, we rated again last and it was, it was

02:57:21.560 --> 02:57:22.560
really good.

02:57:22.560 --> 02:57:25.720
And I think like, you know, they made some tweaks to the group and it really worked and

02:57:25.720 --> 02:57:27.360
we cleared like five bosses in one night.

02:57:27.360 --> 02:57:28.360
So it's a good time.

02:57:28.360 --> 02:57:29.360
On Firelands?

02:57:29.360 --> 02:57:30.360
Uh, no, the new one.

02:57:30.360 --> 02:57:31.360
Dragon Soul.

02:57:31.360 --> 02:57:32.360
Oh, the new one, Dragon Soul?

02:57:32.360 --> 02:57:33.360
Yeah.

02:57:33.360 --> 02:57:34.360
I got a new belt.

02:57:34.360 --> 02:57:35.360
Yay.

02:57:35.360 --> 02:57:36.360
Leet loots.

02:57:36.360 --> 02:57:42.640
You know what, I actually got, someone just gave me random kudos for having two tier thirteens

02:57:42.640 --> 02:57:46.440
and two tier twelves because you actually get the bonuses from both sets.

02:57:46.440 --> 02:57:47.440
Right.

02:57:47.440 --> 02:57:48.440
Yeah.

02:57:48.440 --> 02:57:49.960
And it's kind of neat having extra haste with a double.

02:57:49.960 --> 02:57:53.260
I want that on my mage because I have the tier 12 bonus, but anyway, sorry.

02:57:53.260 --> 02:57:56.040
We're getting, this discussion is getting a little too Hoard House, which by the way

02:57:56.040 --> 02:58:00.480
is the other Warcraft show I do sometimes, www.hoardhouse.com.

02:58:00.480 --> 02:58:01.480
I'm going to be honest.

02:58:01.480 --> 02:58:02.520
Let's have some real talk for a minute.

02:58:02.520 --> 02:58:05.680
I don't know when there's going to be another episode of Hoard House because like Extifer

02:58:05.680 --> 02:58:10.320
is now like busy on the weekends all the time because I don't, I don't know if I should

02:58:10.320 --> 02:58:14.600
say this, but he's seen, he's got an infestation of a giant.

02:58:14.600 --> 02:58:20.400
He hasn't, he hasn't, we'll put it that way, Extifer has an infestation of a vagina all

02:58:20.400 --> 02:58:21.400
week.

02:58:21.400 --> 02:58:24.040
No, he's, he's, he's seeing a boy and I met the boy the other night and he's really cool.

02:58:24.040 --> 02:58:28.440
So I don't want to, you know, so you know, I don't know what's going to happen.

02:58:28.440 --> 02:58:30.800
So it's going to be really hard for us to kind of like coordinate our schedules and

02:58:30.800 --> 02:58:31.800
so forth.

02:58:31.800 --> 02:58:33.200
And plus he's not playing wow.

02:58:33.200 --> 02:58:36.000
So I know.

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:38.760
So we have to get guests that can fill in the gaps and so forth.

02:58:38.760 --> 02:58:41.280
I'll be more than happy to fill in if you want to record.

02:58:41.280 --> 02:58:42.280
I know.

02:58:42.280 --> 02:58:43.280
I know.

02:58:43.280 --> 02:58:45.600
I don't know what's going to happen now, but it's just, don't expect Horde House every

02:58:45.600 --> 02:58:48.720
week sadly until we get some of this stuff worked out.

02:58:48.720 --> 02:58:52.960
So especially like a common, uh, date and time and all that.

02:58:52.960 --> 02:58:54.400
All right.

02:58:54.400 --> 02:58:57.480
Tiger Claw in chat says, I bet Rob is strict and mean in the Guild.

02:58:57.480 --> 02:59:00.800
When someone underperforms, he'll yell at them like a drill Sergeant.

02:59:00.800 --> 02:59:04.520
I don't yell.

02:59:04.520 --> 02:59:06.660
What are you doing going to that side?

02:59:06.660 --> 02:59:07.660
We said this one.

02:59:07.660 --> 02:59:08.660
No, that's not Rob.

02:59:08.660 --> 02:59:09.660
No, I don't really do that.

02:59:09.660 --> 02:59:14.320
I do, I've, I like to think I'm fair and I'm nice and I'm patient.

02:59:14.320 --> 02:59:16.840
I'm very fucking patient.

02:59:16.840 --> 02:59:21.840
But like I hit the, I get to these moments where I fucking snap.

02:59:21.840 --> 02:59:23.760
This is what Rob sounds like.

02:59:23.760 --> 02:59:29.840
Like I'm going to do the, uh, what was the, the boss in black rock?

02:59:29.840 --> 02:59:30.840
The Faryon.

02:59:30.840 --> 02:59:31.840
Faryon.

02:59:31.840 --> 02:59:32.840
This is Rob on the Faryon.

02:59:32.840 --> 02:59:33.840
Okay.

02:59:33.840 --> 02:59:34.840
Get to the platform.

02:59:34.840 --> 02:59:35.840
Okay.

02:59:35.840 --> 02:59:36.840
Don't forget to interrupt.

02:59:36.840 --> 02:59:37.840
You interrupt.

02:59:37.840 --> 02:59:38.840
You interrupt.

02:59:38.840 --> 02:59:39.840
Are you healing?

02:59:39.840 --> 02:59:40.840
What happened?

02:59:40.840 --> 02:59:41.840
Or what happened to your mana?

02:59:41.840 --> 02:59:44.160
Are you healing?

02:59:44.160 --> 02:59:45.160
What was that?

02:59:45.160 --> 02:59:46.160
Why did we wipe?

02:59:46.160 --> 02:59:47.160
Okay.

02:59:47.160 --> 02:59:48.160
I think we wiped because this, this, this, and this.

02:59:48.160 --> 02:59:49.160
All right.

02:59:49.160 --> 02:59:50.160
Let's try it again.

02:59:50.160 --> 02:59:51.160
Get to the platform.

02:59:51.160 --> 02:59:52.160
That's Rob.

02:59:52.160 --> 02:59:55.920
A little bit, a little bit.

02:59:55.920 --> 02:59:56.920
All right.

02:59:56.920 --> 03:00:03.880
Uh, let's see another story here from the Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R. Tiger Claw

03:00:03.880 --> 03:00:05.960
sends us this link.

03:00:05.960 --> 03:00:10.000
Nintendo zone to feature full episodes of Pokemon.

03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:11.000
Yay.

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:16.720
3DS owners get free wifi access at 29,000 Nintendo zone locations.

03:00:16.720 --> 03:00:18.720
Oh, that's that new channel on my 3DS.

03:00:18.720 --> 03:00:20.960
I can't figure out what it's used for.

03:00:20.960 --> 03:00:26.000
Um, Nintendo zone will offer much more content for 3DS owners.

03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:29.920
There will be a dedicated Pokemon section that will feature full length episodes of

03:00:29.920 --> 03:00:32.320
the Pokemon TV series.

03:00:32.320 --> 03:00:36.120
And uh, yeah, McDonald's or Starbucks are both Nintendo zone partners.

03:00:36.120 --> 03:00:39.760
That's actually kind of cool, especially if I can get like old school Pokemon episodes.

03:00:39.760 --> 03:00:43.160
Like remember when I had all those Pokemon DVDs, I still do have some of them up there.

03:00:43.160 --> 03:00:44.160
I know.

03:00:44.160 --> 03:00:45.160
Oh, you know what?

03:00:45.160 --> 03:00:46.160
I have Rob.

03:00:46.160 --> 03:00:47.160
What?

03:00:47.160 --> 03:00:56.040
Japanese Digimon DVDs for the record, O L R has a one in three occurrence of vagina.

03:00:56.040 --> 03:00:58.680
Ah, all right.

03:00:58.680 --> 03:01:02.000
Oh, well our Skype line unfortunately isn't ringing anymore.

03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:03.000
I guess.

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:10.360
Uh, I guess I guess people just wanted to call and yell at me or talk about old games.

03:01:10.360 --> 03:01:11.360
So that's all right.

03:01:11.360 --> 03:01:12.760
They've come down with the case.

03:01:12.760 --> 03:01:14.880
Our usual callers are at their Superbowl parties.

03:01:14.880 --> 03:01:15.880
It's fine.

03:01:15.880 --> 03:01:16.880
I understand.

03:01:16.880 --> 03:01:19.820
Hey, look, he joined the chat room.

03:01:19.820 --> 03:01:22.080
It's the artist behind every little step.

03:01:22.080 --> 03:01:25.880
Bobby Blackpool speaking of the Superbowl.

03:01:25.880 --> 03:01:26.880
All right.

03:01:26.880 --> 03:01:27.880
Oh, sorry.

03:01:27.880 --> 03:01:28.880
It's super bowels.

03:01:28.880 --> 03:01:29.880
We're going to wrap it up.

03:01:29.880 --> 03:01:30.880
We're getting out of here.

03:01:30.880 --> 03:01:32.480
We're getting out of here for the night.

03:01:32.480 --> 03:01:34.040
Last minute stories.

03:01:34.040 --> 03:01:36.920
Loki, do you have anything you want to share for last minute stories?

03:01:36.920 --> 03:01:42.040
Uh, just one small thing that I noticed that Joyce had posted a little thing about this

03:01:42.040 --> 03:01:43.280
game.

03:01:43.280 --> 03:01:45.120
It's a free indie game.

03:01:45.120 --> 03:01:51.720
Um, and it's a really oddly named game called the cat that got milk or the cat that got

03:01:51.720 --> 03:01:53.800
the milk.

03:01:53.800 --> 03:01:58.040
Not necessarily what it sounds like, but it's a, it's a free game.

03:01:58.040 --> 03:01:59.040
Go check it out.

03:01:59.040 --> 03:02:05.920
Um, it's a pretty short, only 10, 15 minutes, but it's a, the cat that got the milk.com

03:02:05.920 --> 03:02:13.600
and um, it looks pretty awesome based on the trailer.

03:02:13.600 --> 03:02:14.720
All right.

03:02:14.720 --> 03:02:16.640
Let's go around and wrap up the show.

03:02:16.640 --> 03:02:17.840
We're at the end of the show.

03:02:17.840 --> 03:02:18.840
We've done all the stories.

03:02:18.840 --> 03:02:19.840
We've done all the calls.

03:02:19.840 --> 03:02:20.840
We've done all the news.

03:02:20.840 --> 03:02:22.280
We're time to wrap it up.

03:02:22.280 --> 03:02:24.440
So, um, Dark Sakura, we'll start with you.

03:02:24.440 --> 03:02:26.280
Your final thought tonight?

03:02:26.280 --> 03:02:27.960
Vagina.

03:02:27.960 --> 03:02:28.960
How lovely.

03:02:28.960 --> 03:02:29.960
Loki.

03:02:29.960 --> 03:02:30.960
Your final thought tonight?

03:02:30.960 --> 03:02:36.000
Uh, the character that I was talking about earlier at Soul Calibur five is Lord Geo Dom

03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:39.900
Pierre, which was a pre-order bonus at Best Buy.

03:02:39.900 --> 03:02:44.400
My final thought is Jigglypuff.

03:02:44.400 --> 03:02:46.800
That's going to do it guys for another episode of orange launch radio.

03:02:46.800 --> 03:02:49.600
Thank you guys so much for downloading and listening to our show.

03:02:49.600 --> 03:02:52.480
Even if it was just to yell at me that you needed a port somewhere.

03:02:52.480 --> 03:02:55.080
Um, we're going to do this all again next week.

03:02:55.080 --> 03:02:58.160
You know what we ask if you've enjoyed what you hear here at orange launch radio.

03:02:58.160 --> 03:03:02.600
Remember, we don't have a big magazine backing us with millions of dollars.

03:03:02.600 --> 03:03:04.200
We don't have all these ads and stuff.

03:03:04.200 --> 03:03:06.440
You know, all we ask, tell a friend about the show.

03:03:06.440 --> 03:03:10.620
Help spread the word of orange lounge radio and we'll come back to do it all again next

03:03:10.620 --> 03:03:11.620
week.

03:03:11.620 --> 03:03:14.860
So, uh, next week I'm hoping to talk a little more in depth about Soul Calibur five after

03:03:14.860 --> 03:03:16.580
I get some more hands on time with it.

03:03:16.580 --> 03:03:18.460
I don't know what my co-host will be playing.

03:03:18.460 --> 03:03:19.460
Hands on.

03:03:19.460 --> 03:03:22.120
Maybe get some time in with Evita if I know anyone that gets one early.

03:03:22.120 --> 03:03:23.120
We'll see.

03:03:23.120 --> 03:03:24.480
I'll have to go find my rich friends.

03:03:24.480 --> 03:03:26.600
But until then, that's going to do it.

03:03:26.600 --> 03:03:30.440
Myself, Dark Soccer and Loki saying, good night.

03:03:30.440 --> 03:03:34.960
