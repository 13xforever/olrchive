0	16880	Tonight, February 5th, 2012.
16880	20560	Could mature video games soon carry an extra sales tax?
20560	29920	Game Gear games are spotted for the 3DS, and a creation kit is set to come for Skyrim.
29920	36360	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
36360	40880	where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
40880	48760	It is episode number 444, that's three fours, not four fours, for this February 5th of 2012.
48760	53580	We are live as we are every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, where we
53580	59100	tape live 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, although
59100	63520	not tonight, Bobby had the night off, something about a superb owl, he was a superb owl or
63520	64520	something he was doing.
64520	67240	I thought he had to do a stupor or something.
67240	68240	Something like that.
68240	71080	So anyway, my name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with
71080	72080	my co-host.
72080	75540	First off, you already heard her, but it's Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
75540	78280	Maybe it was Super Bowels.
78280	79280	Maybe that was it.
79280	81640	It might have been, I don't know, something like that.
81640	84520	Also say hello, of course, to the one and only Tech Master, Loki.
84520	85520	Hi.
85520	86520	How are you, Loki?
86520	87520	I'm fine.
87520	90480	It's a name that a lot of the live listeners like to play on the show, and that is, you
90480	92400	know, where did Loki get his food tonight?
92400	96200	Because you like to go to like fast food restaurants, or you go to, you know, whatever restaurant
96200	98640	you take out and you bring it to the show to munch on air, because, you know, we do
98640	99760	the show at dinner time.
99760	100760	Yeah.
100760	102880	So if we don't eat before or after, we're kind of screwed.
102880	105320	So, but you went to two restaurants tonight, right?
105320	109680	Yeah, well, the KFC got some honey barbecue wings, and then I went to McDonald's and got
109680	111760	some fries.
111760	114840	So you had wings and fries for this superb owl day?
114840	115840	Yeah.
115840	116840	I see.
116840	117840	It's not appropriate.
117840	123360	Well, I wanted to go to someplace else, other than fast food, but the teriyaki place nearby
123360	131600	closed, and the fish and chips place nearby, they're closed today, and it's just like all
131600	133120	the other places are closed.
133120	135360	I got to go into Quiznos, I guess, but meh.
135360	136360	Yeah, a lot of places.
136360	140160	Well, we actually, Alan and I went and got sushi real quick before the show, and they
140160	142840	were open, but not very busy at all.
142840	144040	There's like one table in there.
144040	145040	Go figure.
145040	146040	I can't imagine why.
146040	152320	I considered stopping by Little Caesars for some really cheap ass pizza, but I figured
152320	153880	that they'd be really busy.
153880	155720	No, not now.
155720	158760	All those pizzas would have been done before the big game started.
158760	161560	I am, of course, talking about the Puppy Bowl.
161560	162560	I got food too.
162560	164440	Where'd you get food from tonight?
164440	166360	Whole Foods.
166360	168840	How healthy, you damn dirty hippie.
168840	169840	Yes.
169840	171720	Hey, it was delicious, and it had grapes in it.
171720	174320	All right, so obviously, Pink Elephant in the room.
174320	179120	We are live on a night where usually there's not a lot of stuff going on anywhere, not
179120	183520	on TV, not anywhere, unless you're the network that's carrying the Super Bowl, because we
183520	184520	are up against...
184520	188800	I was going to say, I did hear something big happen today, and that was Madonna said, fuck
188800	189800	you to everybody.
189800	191360	Yeah, well, that was MIA, I guess.
191360	192360	Oh, MIA?
192360	194440	Yeah, because she had her own little entourage with her.
194440	198920	Now, Madonna, you know, sashayed and lip synced for her life in front of all those people
198920	199920	and stuff.
199920	200920	It was interesting.
200920	204480	Of course, I know people that pick their nose and eat it, and that's kind of interesting
204480	205480	too.
205480	209680	Anyway, let's introduce our chat room at chat.orangeloungelaunch...
209680	210680	What?
210680	212560	Can we take like five seconds to judge Madonna?
212560	213560	Sure.
213560	214560	Go ahead.
214560	217400	Okay, I'm done.
217400	223020	Chat.orangelaunchradio.com if you want to join us live in our chat room and talk along
223020	225600	with the program and all that good stuff.
225600	230840	So I got to say, look, I don't want to keep ragging on Madonna, because I do love Madonna.
230840	231840	Like no, seriously.
231840	232840	I'm gay.
232840	233840	I have to love Madonna.
233840	235360	Like it's like a it's like a requirement.
235360	236520	She was pre gaga.
236520	237520	She's been slipping.
237520	240180	Like I don't I don't even want to make a Madonna gaga thing.
240180	241280	Like that's not a thing.
241280	242280	People need to stop making that a thing.
242280	243280	It's not a thing.
243280	244280	It's not a thing.
244280	245280	What?
245280	246520	It's an evolution of styles.
246520	247720	What's an evolution of music?
247720	248720	Sure.
248720	250920	It was clearly an influence.
250920	252400	Here's the thing about Madonna.
252400	253400	She's kind of slipping.
253400	254400	And I don't know.
254400	255400	I don't know what it is.
255400	256400	But like that new song.
256400	257400	Not good.
257400	258560	Like it's just not good.
258560	261400	But anyway, huh?
261400	264200	Was there ever a Madonna video game trying to get back on topic?
264200	266640	I don't think there was.
266640	268720	Wasn't Ray of Light in something?
268720	270280	It might have been like in a dance game.
270280	271280	I don't know.
271280	272280	All right.
272280	276400	Look, we do, of course, always invite our live chatters at chat.orangelaungerator.com.
276400	280960	However, we do ask the live chatters, don't talk about the Super Bowl in the chat room.
280960	284380	It's not that we want to like censor you or you know, but it's just as I'm trying to look
284380	287400	through chat room and read comments that are relevant to the show, I don't need to see
287400	291400	a bunch of like woo giants, woo patriots, blah, blah, blah, you know, whatever going
291400	292400	on in there.
292400	294720	So try to keep the Super Bowl chat out.
294720	296880	However, Puppy Bowl chat is just fine.
296880	298560	If you want to talk about the Puppy Bowl, we'll deal with that.
298560	302920	What about that cute little lab that was drinking from the bowl when we were watching?
302920	305760	Well, this year's Puppy Bowl was all about fumble.
305760	307920	It seemed like the whole time was fumble.
307920	310160	But I was a big fan of Oscar the dash on.
310160	312520	Happy birthday, Tiger Claw.
312520	313520	That's right.
313520	314540	It is Tiger Claw's birthday.
314540	317640	We should take a minute to acknowledge Tiger Claw because he does a lot.
317640	323200	You know, the network that we're on, all games dot com like I don't want to like I don't
323200	327740	want to say the wrong thing here, but there's there's really nobody running all games radio
327740	328740	right now.
328740	333460	Like it's kind of like this hive mind, I think that's kind of running the station.
333460	337780	That's not a knock on Scott, who started a long time ago, but his station will be assimilated.
337780	341440	He's got other projects and things and he's not really running things.
341440	343840	He doesn't have a daily show on the network anymore.
343840	347440	So there's really nobody in charge at all games radio.
347440	349860	We're just kind of, you know, trucking along, doing our thing.
349860	355160	But Tiger Claw, he has done a damn good job, just kind of like kind of keeping things orderly.
355160	359640	Like I don't want to call him the secretary of all games radio, but he's he's definitely
359640	364280	he's the P.A. The personal assistant to director.
364280	367280	OK, he's the one that actually gets the stuff done.
367280	369760	Yes, that's a very good way of putting it.
369760	370860	That's a great way of putting it.
370860	374980	He's the director's assistant or the one that's actually doing all the work because he's,
374980	377780	you know, making sure that all the live shows are up.
377780	383060	Like we have been on all games radio so, so, so long that we can do our own live show.
383060	385420	We technically don't need Tiger Claw's help.
385420	387460	We like having him here, of course.
387460	391500	But I know a lot of the other shows on the network, like Tiger Claw helps them get on,
391500	394300	actually set up their show, go live and all that good stuff.
394300	397820	So he does a lot of stuff that you guys probably don't see.
397820	399060	Why?
399060	400380	Because he loves the network.
400380	403180	So or or he's getting money that we don't know about.
403180	404180	I don't know.
404180	405180	I think it's the first one.
405180	410580	So absolutely a special happy birthday to Tiger Claw, because without Tiger Claw, I
410580	415380	don't know if there'd be a network still going right now, because if the power went down,
415380	419340	it probably people would notice till the next live broadcasters like, where's my show?
419340	424060	Do you know that that our buddy Brad from Pod Culture just got the first gong of the
424060	425060	year?
425060	426060	Oh, what did Brad do?
426060	431180	He said he heard the puppy bowl just went to the dogs.
431180	432180	Nice.
432180	433180	Nice.
433180	435900	I went old school and went with the gong instead of the sad trombone.
435900	437500	All right.
437500	438500	Okay.
438500	442860	So I want to start since we are, you know, in a we can't ignore the big sports thing
442860	443860	that's going on.
443860	448420	I realize most people this week are probably downloading this via the podcast because I
448420	451780	guess it's I guess it's just an American tradition or something.
451780	454940	Did you know that Paula Deen was in Sacramento like this week?
454940	455940	No, really?
455940	456940	Yeah.
456940	458180	She gave away a lot of ham.
458180	459440	I'm serious.
459440	460440	You're not making this up.
460440	461440	I'm not making this up.
461440	462440	Why were you there?
462440	463440	I wasn't there.
463440	467660	Um, but my Nellie's friend Colt, you remember Colt?
467660	468660	I do.
468660	469660	Yeah.
469660	470660	He's got some tie.
470660	473520	Well, he works, I think he works at Whole Foods now, but he has some ties to some sort
473520	478500	of charity or something nearby that got Paula Deen to come out here, do a live show and
478500	479860	give away a bunch of ham.
479860	480860	From what I remember.
480860	483340	Her personal ham stash.
483340	485660	From what I remember of him, him being a big fan of Paula Deen.
485660	486660	Is it coated in butter?
486660	489940	Didn't he have like a little southern twang, if I remember right?
489940	493780	He was a big fan of, uh, not Paula Deen.
493780	496900	It was, um, Rachel Ray.
496900	499520	No, it's a country music star.
499520	503940	It's some country female, no, female country music star.
503940	504940	Trisha Yearwood?
504940	505940	No.
505940	507020	I'm trying to think of like the five.
507020	509460	Shania Twain.
509460	510460	Might be Shania Twain.
510460	511460	Okay.
511460	512460	She's Canadian.
512460	513620	Even though she hasn't been around in about 15 years.
513620	515520	No, maybe that's not it.
515520	517500	It's ah, I don't remember.
517500	518500	Oh, whatever.
518500	519500	That doesn't matter.
519500	520500	It's not important.
520500	522700	The important thing is that she looks like she's made of plastic.
522700	523700	Yes.
523700	527340	By the way, I have to tell you the sad thing that happened yesterday.
527340	528340	What?
528340	531980	Becky and I were at the Crocker Art Museum for Free Museum Day and we were standing next
531980	536660	to this younger couple just looking at a picture and the guy's like, wow, this looks like a
536660	537820	Rush album.
537820	540060	And she's like, what's Rush?
540060	549740	Becky and I turned around and in unison with her boyfriend said, what's Rush?
549740	554020	She looked like she wanted to crawl into a corner and die.
554020	558140	At least that didn't happen on 2-1-12 because that would have been a disaster.
558140	559140	Anyway.
559140	560140	All right.
560140	561860	Can we actually talk about video games?
561860	562860	Sure.
562860	563860	Possibly.
563860	564860	I thought that that was worth sharing.
564860	565860	All right.
565860	566860	No, it's fine.
566860	567860	It's fine.
567860	568860	Can we talk about video games?
568860	569860	I played some.
569860	570860	It happens occasionally on this show.
570860	571860	All right.
571860	577780	Look, the kickoff topic, her, her, I wanted to do tonight was OK, because a lot of folks
577780	582100	tend to kind of notice that we don't talk a lot about sports games because we don't
582100	586540	really play a lot of sports games these days because I don't know why don't we play sports
586540	587540	games?
587540	588540	Why don't you play Madden?
588540	589540	Because they're ass.
589540	591660	But that's that's not a good enough reason.
591660	592660	I'm sorry.
592660	593900	Like because I hate football.
593900	599180	Well, I don't personally I don't hate football like hates a strong word, but I don't know.
599180	603540	Like I think I'm just willing to admit I'm not very good at sports games because I'm
603540	606340	not very knowledgeable about a lot of the sports.
606340	609980	And for me, a lot of these games like Madden and stuff get really like detailed and stuff.
609980	613300	And when I look at all these like, you know, maps of the X's nose and things like that.
613300	616500	And I'm sure like like a lot of football fans, I'm just like the biggest idiot in the world
616500	617500	right now.
617500	620140	But like you have to realize there's some people that don't really watch sports, you
620140	621140	guys.
621140	623980	So I I can't really follow a lot of those new sports games.
623980	628020	But I thought that doesn't mean I hate all sports games, because that's certainly not
628020	629020	true.
629020	631100	There are some sports games out there I actually really enjoy.
631100	635060	So I thought we could talk a little bit about sports games that don't suck.
635060	638780	So dark soccer, do you do you I know you say hate football, but are there any sports games
638780	641220	you can think of that you really enjoy?
641220	645420	I like like the only football game I've ever really enjoyed was super high impact on Super
645420	646640	Nintendo.
646640	649300	My brothers and I would play the crap out of that.
649300	652300	And NBA Jam.
652300	656500	And NBA Jam.
656500	663660	And that skiing game on the PC that I used to scream at that was on the old no on the
663660	664660	PC.
664660	665660	Yeah.
665660	666660	Whiskey.
666660	668660	Loki, you need to talk into a mic.
668660	669660	Yeah.
669660	670660	Ski free.
670660	671660	Ski free.
671660	672660	That game would piss me off.
672660	677580	Oh, actually, I remember one that I really, really liked Alpine Racer.
677580	680380	I freaking loved Alpine Racer.
680380	682300	And we had one at my arcade.
682300	685220	I played the shit out of that I was super good at it.
685220	692360	And I liked it's not really, you know, sports, but I'll count it as prop cycle.
692360	693540	That's stretching it.
693540	696860	That's like saying DDR and taking the easy way out of this question.
696860	699740	I didn't say DDR.
699740	701740	Some sports games that I've enjoyed in the past.
701740	706100	I used to play a game on the NES back in the day that I loved.
706100	708860	And I think it was like baseball.
708860	710140	Baseball stars.
710140	711140	Was that it?
711140	712140	You could like manage.
712140	713140	I have that game.
713140	714140	Yes.
714140	715140	That game.
715140	716140	That game.
716140	717780	But they had an NES version of it, right?
717780	718780	I think they did.
718780	719780	Maybe it was RBI Baseball or something.
719780	720780	No, it wasn't RBI Baseball.
720780	721780	It wasn't any other baseball game.
721780	724980	No, I think that Baseball Stars was the...
724980	726260	I think they did a Neo Geo.
726260	727260	That wasn't Neo Geo.
727260	728580	The version of the Neo Geo won.
728580	731040	I think they did one on the NES.
731040	735000	And then like, you know, because the folks that...
735000	738660	They made some games on Nintendo before they spun off to their own thing.
738660	741080	So anyway.
741080	742080	Other stuff I enjoyed.
742080	744060	Blades of Steel will always be one of my favorites.
744060	746460	I had Ice Hockey and Blades of Steel on the NES.
746460	748820	Those are both great games.
748820	750860	I really like a lot of racing games.
750860	752580	If you want to try and get a little more modern.
752580	753580	I do like a lot of...
753580	754580	I like the...
754580	759380	Although, I don't know if it's really sports borderline, but I like the Wangan Midnight
759380	760380	Maximum Tune games.
760380	762420	That's not a sport.
762420	764180	Racing is not a sport?
764180	765180	Drifting is not a sport.
765180	766180	Okay.
766180	769060	I mean drifting, they have competitions, but it's not like a sport.
769060	772000	I've played the NASCAR games and I've enjoyed them.
772000	773000	Like in the arcade.
773000	776020	You know, like the big old simulations that you get in there and get into.
776020	777220	I like those.
777220	778220	So those are pretty cool.
778220	780580	I'm trying to think if there's a...
780580	781580	Oh!
781580	782580	You know what?
782580	786740	I really enjoyed, at least in the past, I haven't played a lot of them recently, but
786740	791220	I remember when I was growing up, I used to love on the Commodore 64, because y'all know
791220	792860	I loved my Commodore 64 growing up.
792860	797060	I used to play the shit out of Winter Games and Summer Games 2, which were kind of like
797060	798060	the Olympic...
798060	800060	I mean, there was a Summer Games 1, but we didn't own it.
800060	801420	So I had those other ones.
801420	804940	Those were kind of like their Olympic games where you could do like cycling and, you know,
804940	810500	if it was Winter Games, you could do, I don't know, like, I think figure skating and speed
810500	812100	skating and some of the other stuff they have.
812100	813100	So I like the Olympics.
813100	816740	Like, I really do like that as far as sports go anyway.
816740	818500	So I like usually a lot of the Olympic games.
818500	824320	I even played the demo for that Mario and Sonic 2012 Olympic game that's coming out
824320	826920	later this year because they have the 3DS demo out right now.
826920	831340	I like the trampoline one because that was the only one where you really notice the 3D.
831340	833740	But the cycling one drove me bonkers.
833740	837900	So and some of the ones, Dark Soccer said, I used to play NBA Jam in the arcade all the
837900	838900	time.
838900	839900	I really try.
839900	843380	I really tried to like this new NBA Jam that just came out, but I didn't really care for
843380	844860	it.
844860	849180	The new one that was on, yeah, I downloaded the demo on Fire Edition or whatever.
849180	850180	Didn't care for it.
850180	851180	It wasn't that good.
851180	852180	That sad face.
852180	853180	Yeah, I tried.
853180	856740	You know, um, what was the game?
856740	857740	California games?
857740	858740	Oh, yeah.
858740	859740	California.
859740	860740	Links.
860740	861740	Yeah.
861740	864940	It was, uh, that was originally, um, that was, I would say it was an Amiga game.
864940	868860	I wasn't great at it, but it was okay, but it had the unreal 360.
868860	874660	Well, they tried to keep, actually, that's like a spinoff of the summer games and, uh,
874660	878820	winter games because they, you know, they kind of ran out of stuff to do Olympic related
878820	883700	720 and well, that was a different series, but yeah, seven to 720 was awesome.
883700	886260	Anyhow, Loki, what about you?
886260	894740	Um, I used to play some of the NFL Blitz arcade game back in, I don't know, when I worked
894740	895740	at Roundtable.
895740	897740	That was kind of fun.
897740	902740	Um, and then co-op.
902740	903740	It's running.
903740	907740	Um, I don't know, I don't play a lot of sports games.
907740	908740	Okay.
908740	912140	I thought of a racing game that ought to count because everybody fucking loved this game
912140	913700	when they were a kid.
913700	919140	I mean, Ironman, Ivan Stewart, super off-road racing, every pizza parlor has that, right?
919140	920140	I never played it.
920140	921380	I actually never played that one.
921380	922380	Oh my God.
922380	927740	That had an awesome any, I remember when the NES version of that came out or was it, no,
927740	932700	it was regular NES because it was one of the few games that supported the, um, uh, the
932700	934540	ultra tap or whatever it was called.
934540	935540	The multi tap.
935540	936540	Yeah.
936540	939980	Because I mean, if I was going to count a racing game as, you know, included, then I
939980	947580	would totally, totally just put in the original Ridge Racer because that was a money sucker
947580	948700	for me.
948700	951420	If I hadn't worked at the damn arcade, I would have been broke.
951420	952420	All right.
952420	954500	Go into our chat room for some comments at chat.
954500	955940	If I got everything for Loki, sorry.
955940	957940	Just want to make sure.
957940	958940	Um, sure.
958940	964500	I mean, that's chat that orange lounge, radio.com, uh, Kaijuto says baseball all stars was awesome
964500	966100	and I had it on Nintendo.
966100	971540	Um, RDG singe says, OMG, no one mentioned track and field.
971540	972540	That one was okay.
972540	976180	You know, they had an Xbox live port of that, um, way back in the beginning when it was
976180	980580	a bunch of old eighties, Konami games are being ported over, but it's really, I mean,
980580	983100	it's good, but it's really just button mashing.
983100	987740	I did play track and field, not even like three months ago though, the last time I was
987740	991720	at electronica at Disneyland because they have the whole Flynn's arcade and they had
991720	992720	a track and field machine.
992720	997980	I played it on my, uh, arcade cabinet not too long ago, a few months ago, but it's really
997980	1003620	just like, you know, but I guess then again, the Commodore 64 games were no better.
1003620	1006620	So what am I, who am I to judge?
1006620	1012220	So, all right, anyhow, uh, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks.
1012220	1015120	We usually like to start off the show, talk about the video games that we've been playing
1015120	1016120	this week.
1016120	1017120	Dark Sakura.
1017120	1018120	How was your gaming week?
1018120	1019120	I played.
1019120	1020120	Wow.
1020120	1021120	And something epic happened.
1021120	1022120	Okay.
1022120	1023980	I'm going to tell it to you earlier, but I'm going to tell it to me.
1023980	1033580	So this guy named Lich Rage on Blade's Edge Alliance, Human DK, um, I was wondering around,
1033580	1038820	uh, trying to finish the love is in the air crap, you know, for, they do for Valentine's
1038820	1039820	suck.
1039820	1044180	And, um, there's this thing that you have to throw rose petals on certain, uh, race
1044180	1045180	and class combinations.
1045180	1047580	And one of them is a human death knight.
1047580	1051060	So I just went in trade chat and said, is there a human death knight around?
1051060	1054140	And there's one said, yeah, 10 gold.
1054140	1061660	So I invited him into my party and targeted him and then left the party and he said, you
1061660	1062660	lied.
1062660	1066900	I'm like, you shouldn't have been charging for something that's a free service.
1066900	1073040	And he's like, I've only got 20 gold and I'm like, so go out and earn it like the rest
1073040	1074040	of us.
1074040	1076620	Mining and herbalism are your friends.
1076620	1077620	And he said, suck it.
1077620	1082820	You planning the herbal is, uh, she's like, suck it.
1082820	1086780	And I was like, ignore, she just put deal with it.
1086780	1087780	Happy face.
1087780	1092120	Well, I was, I, I wasn't rude to him.
1092120	1098580	You know, I was like, you know, I, when I started off, you swindled them, I didn't swindle
1098580	1099580	them.
1099580	1100580	Maybe a little bit, a little bit.
1100580	1101580	You swindled him.
1101580	1103260	He thought I swindled him.
1103260	1107020	If you could, you would have had your character show her boobies a little bit, you know, cause
1107020	1112660	my intention was the moment someone said, DK here, I was just going to find their name,
1112660	1115740	target them and throw the rose petals anyway.
1115740	1116740	That was the plan.
1116740	1119340	And he's like, 10 gold.
1119340	1120340	That's stupid.
1120340	1121580	You don't, don't do that crap.
1121580	1123740	You know, go out and earn your own damn money.
1123740	1128780	No, I can't help it if you keep buying every pet that pops up in the auction house.
1128780	1131460	So um, addicting.
1131460	1132460	It kind of is.
1132460	1133540	I've actually spent lots of money on pets.
1133540	1138340	They should really have like a series of hoarders, you know, where it's people collecting wild
1138340	1139340	pets.
1139340	1140340	Like MMO hoarders.
1140340	1141340	Yeah.
1141340	1142340	MMO hoarders.
1142340	1143340	I'm sure that exists somewhere.
1143340	1146620	But, um, well actually though, um, one of my really good friends who was my roommate
1146620	1152540	in college, uh, joined our server and gave me a pandaren monk.
1152540	1153540	What a nice gift.
1153540	1156860	It was very nice of her cause she had the magazine and it gave her an extra pandaren
1156860	1157860	monk.
1157860	1160060	When the magazine went away, they gave away all these pets in the game.
1160060	1161620	It's like an I'm sorry type of thing.
1161620	1162620	Yeah.
1162620	1164980	So she gave it to me cause I think she already had it.
1164980	1170060	Um, and then I'm also playing a bust move on my phone.
1170060	1171060	It's still super fun.
1171060	1172340	I really enjoy it.
1172340	1175940	And also I have to make an observation before we move on to Loki.
1175940	1181300	Um, on the can of Arizona diet green tea is a prostitute.
1181300	1183300	Seriously.
1183300	1184740	Taiyu.
1184740	1189940	You can tell because her OB is tied in the front and her hair is over elaborate.
1189940	1191500	That's what I get for studying weight.
1191500	1193580	No, whoever designed that had no idea.
1193580	1198520	They were just like, we just need to look like a geisha Asian looking on this green
1198520	1207380	tea, but they've put a whore granted a very high class, talented, artistic whore.
1207380	1213740	This writing here probably says I am horse, but, but I mean, I just had to point it out.
1213740	1218020	It just, I looked at the can and it dawned on me that it's a prostitute.
1218020	1222980	Isn't there some website of like bad Chinese text tattoos where you see people that got
1222980	1226140	tattoos of Chinese writing and it says like really horrible things.
1226140	1229900	Of course, I don't know how much of that's legit and how much of it's fake, but yeah.
1229900	1231020	All right.
1231020	1233860	If that's it for dark soccer's gaming week, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1233860	1237500	Um, I played Skyrim only a little bit though.
1237500	1238500	Actually.
1238500	1243820	Um, I mainly this week was working on Grand Theft Auto modding and thank God finished
1243820	1246980	what I was working on cause it was making my brain explode.
1246980	1253540	Had to go back and learn, uh, or relearn some calculus stuff mainly because during my actual
1253540	1258700	calculus class, well actually pre calculus cause I never took calculus, um, I was too
1258700	1264340	busy programming a Final Fantasy type game on my calculator.
1264340	1270500	So um, but then yeah, it was mainly just like, I'm never going to use any of this and then
1270500	1274420	sure one time I need something.
1274420	1278100	Obviously there's the internet, um, so yeah, I got that all taken care of.
1278100	1279100	But yeah.
1279100	1288700	Uh, Skyrim, I'm 123 hours now into the game and um, I'm telling you, I saw some things
1288700	1291460	how Skyrim's won all these game of the year awards and stuff.
1291460	1293860	That game is so fucking broken.
1293860	1294900	It is just ridiculous.
1294900	1302060	I literally have to now keep my iPod with me and pull up the quest as I do them to look
1302060	1305380	at the bugs section, known bugs for this quest.
1305380	1306540	So I don't run into them.
1306540	1312620	I ran into two yesterday, um, that were kind, not really game breaking, but it, I mean one
1312620	1317180	of them would have been pretty fucking annoying if it, you know, thankfully I was able to
1317180	1320620	go back to a save prior to when I started that quest.
1320620	1324940	There was an auto save for that, but man, if I hadn't, that would have sucked.
1324940	1334740	It was, uh, but he VMs calling and um, basically, uh, you're supposed to drag this companion
1334740	1339580	to this altar and you sacrifice him and then you have to go kill some other people or whatever.
1339580	1342100	Wait, you'd sacrifice one of your companions?
1342100	1343100	Awesome.
1343100	1348220	It's not, it was when I hired, it was a guy that was like, Hey, I'm a stronger guy here.
1348220	1350060	I'm like, wait, you die.
1350060	1351060	Hold on.
1351060	1353740	You hired a companion so you could sacrifice them.
1353740	1354740	Yes.
1354740	1355740	Awesome.
1355740	1356740	Yes.
1356740	1363180	Um, so anyways, so I did that and one, when she appears though, one of the Daedra appears,
1363180	1369820	um, it's just like, it does this weird screen effect thing that gets all blurry and purple.
1369820	1371820	Well that never went away.
1371820	1376400	Apparently it's a known glitch and normally it's caused by pulling up any of your, if
1376400	1381500	you hit pause, if you pull up your inventory, anything while that's going, then it will
1381500	1382580	stay like that.
1382580	1384100	I didn't do anything like that.
1384100	1386140	It just did it for fun.
1386140	1390220	And so I had to restart the whole thing and to get that to go away because I was like,
1390220	1394140	well, is this supposed to be on all the time while I'm on this quest?
1394140	1397100	Because this is really hard to see.
1397100	1399340	But no, it's not for the record.
1399340	1402820	The other one was when I was trying to become the Thane of Riften.
1402820	1409140	Apparently if you visit your house, you have to purchase a house in Riften.
1409140	1414140	If you visit the house before you talk to the Jarl, you can never become the Thane of
1414140	1415140	Riften.
1415140	1418220	It just breaks the whole quest.
1418220	1419220	Thanks.
1419220	1423740	Thanks for, there is no fucking way they bug tested this game.
1423740	1428780	I mean, most of the quests they seriously must not have tested at all because there
1428780	1431000	is no way that this would have been missed.
1431000	1434700	This is just like completely obvious stuff.
1434700	1437220	Hey, what would happen if I visited the house first?
1437220	1439180	Oh, it breaks the fucking quest.
1439180	1441900	Oh, no, we're not going to test for that.
1441900	1442900	It's good.
1442900	1445940	Yeah, it worked the first time I played through it.
1445940	1451500	Oh, and I cheated in, well, not technically cheated.
1451500	1455700	I exploited a glitch in the game to level my character up to 81 and a half, which is
1455700	1456700	the cap.
1456700	1457700	I capped all my skills at a hundred.
1457700	1460100	Wait, the cap is 81 and a half?
1460100	1462140	81 and a half.
1462140	1463140	Okay.
1463140	1466260	It just happens to be that's the amount of leveling you get when you have all your skills
1466260	1470940	at 181 and a half.
1470940	1472020	It didn't matter anyways.
1472020	1474740	I'm unkillable anyways, so whatever.
1474740	1479140	I just didn't want to have to, I wanted to know my perk points right away so I could
1479140	1482820	like figure out where I wanted them and I actually went back and started doing the actual
1482820	1486900	main quest line and I got to say, man, that thing is short.
1486900	1488700	It is a really short quest line.
1488700	1490260	Well, they usually are.
1490260	1492900	I mean, the game isn't really about the main quest.
1492900	1496900	The main quest is just kind of there to help you learn about the game.
1496900	1497900	Yeah.
1497900	1503500	I am looking forward to the 1.4 patch so I can finish Blood on the Ice, but at this point
1503500	1504820	I'm kind of saying, you know what?
1504820	1508420	So these quests are breaking, it's no big deal because none of them contribute to my
1508420	1510220	achievement points on there.
1510220	1514060	So I'm just going to finish all the quests that require, you know, that they need me
1514060	1518380	to do in order to get my achievements and then I'm going to go kill everybody once I'm
1518380	1519860	done with all that.
1519860	1522660	Everybody will die in a bloody rage.
1522660	1527180	I did see a video this week, it was great, it was of someone had changed their player
1527180	1531620	model to one of the kids and then they had like some spell on there that was dragon fire
1531620	1532620	and it was hilarious.
1532620	1533620	I don't know.
1533620	1534620	It made me laugh.
1534620	1540260	It was a why kids, why kids can't be killed because they're actually dragons.
1540260	1541660	All right.
1541660	1542660	And Call of Duty.
1542660	1545540	Play more Call of Duty, of course.
1545540	1547820	All right, anything else?
1547820	1550900	I think that's it.
1550900	1551900	Yeah.
1551900	1553660	All right.
1553660	1554660	My gaming week.
1554660	1558340	See, I actually played quite a bit of new stuff this week, a few games.
1558340	1560140	Soul Calibur 5, quickly.
1560140	1564700	I literally played Soul Calibur 5 once, so I don't want to like do a total review on
1564700	1569380	it, but I did spend, you know, about an hour with it the other night when I got it and,
1569380	1570540	you know, I had a fairly good time.
1570540	1571900	The fighting's a lot of fun.
1571900	1572900	Creative character's great.
1572900	1578060	I love creative character and, you know, I was making some fun characters with that and
1578060	1582260	story mode I noticed though right off the bat was kind of weird because like you would
1582260	1589980	have these full cut scenes and then like a storyboard, like you just see like a cartoon
1589980	1594180	storyboard that transitions, like it almost feels like it was like half done, a little
1594180	1596100	bit rushed.
1596100	1600300	I guess the bottom line I noticed after, you know, the short amount of time I did play
1600300	1603780	the game is that although the core fighter game itself, which is what you're paying the
1603780	1608060	money for, is good, I feel like everything kind of on the shell outside of that was a
1608060	1611700	little bit like rushed or wonky, except, well, creative character's decent.
1611700	1614940	The only thing that I'm disappointed is that, you know, because it's a game that didn't
1614940	1618540	really pre-order anything, do you know how they have that pre-order character, that really
1618540	1619540	weird looking guy?
1619540	1624020	No, because I didn't pre- oh wait, no, I pre-ordered on Amazon, but they didn't give me anything.
1624020	1627540	Yeah, you're supposed to get this like pre-order character, it's this guy, maybe it's only
1627540	1631860	a GameStop or whatever, it's this guy in like a top hat or something like that that's just
1631860	1637660	really- has some really wacky moves, but that would have been kind of fun to play as.
1637660	1638660	Interesting.
1638660	1640500	I think he was from- he may have been from 4.
1640500	1642100	Or the PSP one maybe, right?
1642100	1644140	Yeah, he might have been the PSP one.
1644140	1650100	I wish the lost Amel was in this one, because he was awesome in 3, but I like Tyra a lot,
1650100	1652460	so I have my custom character model off Tyra.
1652460	1653660	And Ivy.
1653660	1655020	I love Ivy.
1655020	1656020	She's so dirty.
1656020	1657980	I made a male Ivy.
1657980	1658980	Awesome.
1658980	1661420	What, like wearing Voldo's gear?
1661420	1666580	No, just wearing like a tight top and leather pants, you know.
1666580	1667580	Cool.
1667580	1668580	That's pretty cool.
1668580	1673500	So yeah, Soulcalibur V. I'll tell you more about it when I have more time to play it.
1673500	1679220	Because I've been, on my Playstation 3, mostly been playing and sucked into Final Fantasy
1679220	1685380	XIII II, which came out the same day, and I've sunk a good at least 7 hours if not more
1685380	1686540	into that at this point.
1686540	1692380	So yeah, I'm really enjoying Final Fantasy XIII II.
1692380	1697020	I'm really surprised at how divided the internet is on this, because there's just some people
1697020	1700500	that really just fucking hate Final Fantasy XIII.
1700500	1703580	And I really don't think this game is going to do much to sway your mind.
1703580	1705980	I mean, it's to the point, like this is how divided it is.
1705980	1710460	You know that Final Fantasy XIII II is one of like, what, less than 20 games to get a
1710460	1714280	perfect 40 from Famitsu magazine, ever, right?
1714280	1718860	And then like, Edge, I think in the UK, gave it a 5 out of 10.
1718860	1723820	Like, that's quite a difference between a perfect, pristine score from Famitsu and a
1723820	1724820	5.
1724820	1727140	So, I mean, it's just really interesting.
1727140	1730960	It's because these fucking reviewers go into this shit very biased.
1730960	1735340	I mean, they're like judging games on shit that they never judged games on before.
1735340	1737300	It's like, this game is too linear.
1737300	1738300	Really?
1738300	1739300	Really?
1739300	1740300	All these other RPGs were too linear?
1740300	1741660	I just, I just want to give the disclaimer.
1741660	1744140	I didn't read either of those reviews, I'm going off Wikipedia.
1744140	1745700	I was just really surprised though.
1745700	1749500	I was like, wow, this is really a diverse, you know, I would expect some, you know, not
1749500	1752660	everybody's going to like everything, but just usually when it's all over the map like
1752660	1756660	that, especially when Famitsu gave it such a high score, it just really surprised me.
1756660	1758860	But anyway, let's not talk about what other people thought of it.
1758860	1760940	Let's talk about what I thought of it.
1760940	1765060	Of course, what they're doing is they're trying to fix a lot of what people bitched about
1765060	1768220	with XIII.
1768220	1772020	There's definitely not a linear sense in this game whatsoever now.
1772020	1778280	You have this interesting map, um, the crux that you can travel to all these different
1778280	1783740	time zones feels a little bit chrono-triggery kind of where they're pulling the story from.
1783740	1789180	The story has a lot to do with time travel, like, and it's, it's a bit of a mind fuck
1789180	1795580	because you start creating alternate timelines of the exact same place you just were.
1795580	1800820	So like I'm at a point in the story where I was at a place 10 years in the future, but
1800820	1806940	then I unlocked alternate timeline 10 years in the future because of something I did 200
1806940	1809120	years in the future resolving the paradox.
1809120	1812380	So it's like, it's enough time travel stuff to make your head spin.
1812380	1813660	That sounds like lots of fun.
1813660	1815500	That sounds like hanging out with Nordstrom.
1815500	1818640	It's it's really like an entire season with a doctor.
1818640	1824420	It's really an entire season of Doctor Who squished into a video game or it actually
1824420	1827960	in some ways it reminds me of Quantum Leap.
1827960	1830460	Like where in Knoll, Knoll and Sarah going to end up next?
1830460	1831460	Wah, wah, wah.
1831460	1838460	Um, but, uh, yeah, I mean the, the, the really good thing about 13 too is that the battle
1838460	1844460	system is robust right off the bat and you know, well, maybe you don't really get the
1844460	1848820	monster character and the monster trapping and all that till episode two, but needless
1848820	1855500	to say in 13, one of the big issues that people had was that it took forever before you even
1855500	1859300	got to like where you can flip paradigms and where the battle system becomes really interesting
1859300	1861180	when you get the whole paradigm stuff, right?
1861180	1863540	For the first two chapters, you're pretty much just button mashing.
1863540	1865900	There's nothing else to do but auto attack.
1865900	1870200	But in 13 too, that paradigm stuff starts battle one, which is good.
1870200	1877180	So, um, towns are back, random conversations, side quests that people want you to do for
1877180	1878180	them.
1878180	1880940	Uh, Chocolena, who's now the shop, who's shows up everywhere.
1880940	1881940	I love Chocolena.
1881940	1884700	She's like a Vegas showgirl meets, uh, uh, Chocobo.
1884700	1885700	It's great.
1885700	1889860	And, um, apparently there's like a casino later on with tons of mini games and all that
1889860	1890860	stuff.
1890860	1893140	So I, I'm really enjoying it.
1893140	1899020	You know, the story, although it's kind of confusing, like I hate to make myself sound
1899020	1904500	like stupid, but I'm, the story's like really confusing, but I got to say it is really cool,
1904500	1911980	um, to kind of see characters from 13 years later and they do some neat stuff with that.
1911980	1913580	So it's cool.
1913580	1917380	The only thing about the characters that's a little weird is that your party only has
1917380	1920380	two people and I don't know if that's ever going to change.
1920380	1924900	I kind of think the whole game might be just the two people and the rotating monster that
1924900	1926380	might turn some people off.
1926380	1927380	I don't know.
1927380	1929180	I think there's other stuff through DLC.
1929180	1932220	I think you might be able to get more characters as DLC.
1932220	1937700	That's a little bit side eye and judging square for jumping on that bandwagon because I really
1937700	1942320	don't like when so much stuff is behind DLC.
1942320	1947340	You know, it's kind of like now games are really costing $90 because it's $60 for what
1947340	1948340	you wouldn't.
1948340	1951700	You know, a lot of that costume shit is paid to unlock content.
1951700	1953540	Oh, of course it is.
1953540	1954780	Of course it is.
1954780	1957380	There's nothing to download right now.
1957380	1962740	But I'm told that a bunch of zone areas are unlocked through DLC and I heard that lightning
1962740	1966440	in a general from the first game are supposed to be DLC at some point.
1966440	1972860	So I have to judge square a little bit for hopping on that bandwagon.
1972860	1977660	You know, especially when the series is a little bit vulnerable right now.
1977660	1981780	I think that, especially when your game only has two characters in it, that's a little
1981780	1984860	bit judging you.
1984860	1991380	But at least the game that you get for the money you pay for it is a robust experience
1991380	1994380	and I can think of far worse games to blow $60 on.
1994380	1997540	I don't think this game is worthy of a $5.
1997540	2002740	I don't know if it's a perfect $40, but it's really good.
2002740	2004340	But not perfect.
2004340	2007020	So that's what I think about Final Fantasy 13, too.
2007020	2009980	I think if you liked 13, play it.
2009980	2015980	And don't let that hurdle of, but I never beat 13 stop you.
2015980	2020500	Because yes, the game will tell you what happened at the end of 13 and you can even go through
2020500	2024780	a mode that will just walk you through the story of Final Fantasy 13.
2024780	2028300	Albeit it's kind of like narrated text, but you get the idea.
2028300	2032820	I didn't beat 13 and I don't feel like it was really ruined for me.
2032820	2038400	Yes, I will know what happens right at the end of 13, but there's still a lot of stuff
2038400	2040820	that it takes to get there.
2040820	2045020	So just knowing the ending I don't think is going to totally ruin 13 for me.
2045020	2046020	Because I will have to go back.
2046020	2050620	Because I was on chapter 12 when I stopped, I got a long way through it.
2050620	2053900	But yeah, 13, too, is worth your time.
2053900	2056220	One other game I played this week.
2056220	2059180	So Tangent for a minute.
2059180	2063720	Orange Launch Radio started, of course, for many years.
2063720	2068940	For about, what, four years, we were a show exclusively about music games.
2068940	2073740	Because DarkSakura, Loki, and myself all met playing DDR at the local arcade and the original
2073740	2079980	concept behind the show was let's make this kind of like show about what we enjoy doing
2079980	2083500	at the arcades every Wednesday or Thursday night, whatever night it was we were going
2083500	2084860	back then.
2084860	2088920	And we always used to go to Brookfield's, the diner, afterwards and kind of talk shit
2088920	2089920	about games.
2089920	2092980	It was kind of like let's do that as like our show.
2092980	2094820	So for a long time it was about music games.
2094820	2097260	We talked about DDR and the new songs are coming out in DDR.
2097260	2101340	We used to talk about guitar freaks and drum media and keyboard media, Para Para Paradise.
2101340	2102540	All these games that Konami did.
2102540	2107220	And when they first came out, I think we were right on, I think we changed formats right
2107220	2112020	around the time Guitar Hero was breaking and all that stuff.
2112020	2118260	So the bottom line is we switched from doing a music game only show to a gaming show because
2118260	2122220	there wasn't a lot of stuff in the music game world to talk about anymore, which was ironic
2122220	2126420	because then about a year after we switched, Rock Band and Guitar Hero 2 and all that just
2126420	2127940	made it huge.
2127940	2132020	But we felt like there was more we could do talking about regular games.
2132020	2137780	I haven't been following the music gaming scene as closely since then, but I do kind
2137780	2140380	of like, you know, I like to, I check Bamani style once in a while.
2140380	2144100	I checked DDR freak when that was still running, you know, and I would just kind of like keep,
2144100	2149740	I'd like to keep tabs on the music game scene, but I gotta say I haven't really, really enjoyed
2149740	2152140	a Bamani game in a long time.
2152140	2153140	I haven't.
2153140	2157620	I haven't really cared for a lot of the music in the newer BeatMania 2DX's.
2157620	2162260	I didn't think Ju-Beat was all that, or U-Beat or whatever they call that game.
2162260	2165420	I didn't think, what else has come out since then?
2165420	2171260	Pop'n Music, you know, the one they tried here on the Xbox was absolutely awful.
2171260	2173800	The Wii one was really weird.
2173800	2179660	So I can't say I've really, really, truly enjoyed a Bamani game until I think this week.
2179660	2187060	I downloaded a game on Xbox Live that's out called Rhythm Party, and I have to say it's
2187060	2188860	actually pretty good.
2188860	2195860	Now, it's not perfect, there are some things wrong with it, but all things considered,
2195860	2200780	Rhythm Party is kind of the game that Dance Masters, the Kinect game that came out last
2200780	2208060	year on Xbox 360, that was like Konami's first, like, let's put a Bamani game with Kinect.
2208060	2211700	Rhythm Party is the game that Dance Masters should have been, I really think.
2211700	2217220	Ironically enough, Dance Masters, or Dance Evolution as it's called in Japan, is an arcade
2217220	2220420	game, or will become an arcade game very soon.
2220420	2221420	Really?
2221420	2222420	But Rhythm Party should.
2222420	2223420	Yeah.
2223420	2230660	Okay, here's the thing about Rhythm Party, like, Konami is setting this game up to fail,
2230660	2231780	I really think.
2231780	2233820	Like I kind of think this is just coming out.
2233820	2238400	Like, I went to Bamani's style to see what they were saying about it, there's nothing
2238400	2239400	on it.
2239400	2244060	I went to, I put it on Twitter, like Rhythm Party, and like, nobody's talking about it.
2244060	2246100	I saw like one Major Nelson tweet.
2246100	2251060	The only way I knew about this game was from following Naoki Madaya on Facebook, who is
2251060	2253980	of course one of the big, you know, guys, and we mentioned it, remember we mentioned
2253980	2257500	it on the show last week, because we were like, oh, Naoki's teasing this game, and I
2257500	2260700	remembered that, and so I'm like, oh, I'll download it and check it out, and when I fired
2260700	2265660	it up, I noticed that the menu music was the music from Dance Dance Revolution 5th Mix,
2265660	2269140	and I was like, oh, I loved 5th Mix, I love this music, this is awesome.
2269140	2272820	And then I went into the game, and I was kind of like looking through the songs, I'm like,
2272820	2277280	okay, well, even though it's only 10 songs, this is a decent mix of songs, like there's
2277280	2283560	more stuff that's interesting to me here than there was in all of Dance Masters, so, and
2283560	2286060	then I fired up the game and played it for a little bit.
2286060	2288700	So let me tell you where this game's a little bit different.
2288700	2293420	It's not really like, like Dance Masters or Dance Central at all, because you're not trying
2293420	2296580	to mimic a pre-choreographed dance.
2296580	2301580	It's actually a lot more like DDR, or really, Samba de Amigo, because what you're trying
2301580	2304680	to do is you're trying to hit these balls as they fall into the circle.
2304680	2306700	That's exactly what Samba de Amigo had, right?
2306700	2310540	But you're trying to hit them with your hands, you're trying to hit them with your feet.
2310540	2315200	So you might hit this ball over here and then kick one with your foot and stuff, and it's
2315200	2319580	kind of like you get points depending on the timing of when you hit the balls.
2319580	2323500	But you also get extra points as you freestyle.
2323500	2327180	If you jump, you get extra points, if you turn, you get extra points.
2327180	2332460	If you hit balls with hands, you're not supposed to, like you do like crossovers and stuff,
2332460	2334420	you get extra points.
2334420	2336820	You know, if you do poses and stuff, you get extra points.
2336820	2341380	So there's really this emphasis on kind of making your own dance out of the balls that
2341380	2344380	fly in, you know, out of that kind of pattern.
2344380	2349100	And it was, it was entertaining, especially for somebody that kind of really liked DDR
2349100	2352100	that was all about timing and, you know, hitting the arrows.
2352100	2357300	This is truly a Kinect version of DDR, which I don't think Dance Masters was.
2357300	2362360	Dance Masters unfortunately felt like, hmm, Dance Central did this a little better.
2362360	2365780	Better music, easier to understand the choreography.
2365780	2370500	Whereas I think this is now a true, okay, it's not about the choreography, it's about,
2370500	2374300	you know, the more music timing and doing all this.
2374300	2380900	So yeah, the song list, there's only 10 songs, which is a little eh, because two of them
2380900	2382500	feature Vanilla Ice.
2382500	2390520	But there are some good choices in there, Born This Way, Every Little Step, YMCA.
2390520	2396280	Every song, this is, this is what remind, this is what really reminded me of old DDR.
2396280	2402600	Every song has its own unique background, its own unique video, and its own unique kind
2402600	2405620	of thing that your character like does or turns into.
2405620	2407020	Let me explain what I mean.
2407020	2410780	Like when you're playing Born This Way by Lady Gaga, if you do really well, you suddenly
2410780	2414520	turn into like this electric peacock, I don't even know how to explain it.
2414520	2416540	But the cool thing is, it's still you.
2416540	2418220	You look like a human pipe organ.
2418220	2419940	Yeah, it's kind of crazy.
2419940	2421300	With headlights.
2421300	2426500	That one song with all the anime rabbits and stuff, you turn into like a little butterfly.
2426500	2428940	There's another one where you slowly turn into an astronaut.
2428940	2432140	It's really cool because at the end of the song, your little astronaut like blasts off
2432140	2433140	into space.
2433140	2436500	And that reminded me of old DDR because remember like old DDR was like, oh, the backgrounds
2436500	2438620	and the movies and all the animations.
2438620	2444080	Like every song had its own unique one and Born This Way had the real video, YMCA has
2444080	2447700	the real video, every little step has the real video.
2447700	2451580	And it's like, everything I used to really like about the DDR games is kind of in this
2451580	2453060	game.
2453060	2462900	But what I what I really feel like I'm playing here is the demo for a full retail game.
2462900	2465380	Like where's the rest of the songs?
2465380	2466780	Where's multiplayer?
2466780	2468660	Where's anything?
2468660	2473540	I really feel like they're selling a demo for what could potentially be a really good
2473540	2474780	retail game.
2474780	2477980	But I have this bad feeling because nobody knows about it.
2477980	2484440	Like, I really like feel like Konami just kind of, okay, Naoki, we know you have this
2484440	2485440	idea.
2485440	2488380	Why don't you throw something together and like, you know, they threw together the demo
2488380	2493640	and you know, Konami was just like, let's just let's just put it out on Xbox Live and
2493640	2495180	see if it sticks.
2495180	2496600	And I just had this really bad feeling.
2496600	2499240	It's not Denno.
2499240	2502660	There's room for the game to support DLC.
2502660	2507620	I don't know if I trust Konami to handle the DLC appropriately based on other games where
2507620	2510340	like, you know, two songs ever come out as DLC.
2510340	2514580	I'm going to just cross my fingers and really hope that they get some licensed songs.
2514580	2519300	They get some good stuff in there to really round out the game.
2519300	2522420	But yeah, I guess I'm going on a long time about this.
2522420	2525060	But Rhythm Party is really not bad.
2525060	2528740	And if you're listening to this show because you are a fan of Bomani from the yesteryear
2528740	2533100	and so forth, I seriously go check out the demo at least.
2533100	2536700	And tell me if you don't like see a little bit of the old DDR in it.
2536700	2541480	Like I think it's like the closest thing to like a DDR Connect fused experience we're
2541480	2542660	going to see.
2542660	2546940	And I'll be really bummed if it doesn't go anywhere other than this, because it's not
2546940	2547940	that bad.
2547940	2550300	I know, Jamie, you just only got to watch me play it a little bit.
2550300	2554260	But I think you kind of went into it going, really, Rhythm Party, but you kind of seem
2554260	2556220	like you're like, oh, this is cute, right?
2556220	2557220	Yeah.
2557220	2558220	Yeah.
2558220	2559220	I want.
2559220	2560220	Actually, I do want.
2560220	2562460	Loki, you've always been a vocal critic of Konami.
2562460	2565140	I know you haven't really played it, but you saw me doing it for a little bit.
2565140	2566140	It looked okay.
2566140	2569660	I mean, but when I saw them announcing this, I'm like, oh, that's going to suck.
2569660	2573460	I'm just like, I don't even want to look at it.
2573460	2575380	And it was just all right.
2575380	2581180	I mean, it's like, I remember my snarky comment on it was like, oh yeah.
2581180	2586500	Or I don't remember what it was, it's like something about like, um, about they're all
2586500	2588700	you guys excited, you know, pretty blah, blah, blah.
2588700	2592100	I'm like, yeah, like beat and groovy.
2592100	2593700	Remember how they handled that?
2593700	2594700	Yeah.
2594700	2596260	I'm really excited about Rhythm Party.
2596260	2597260	Exactly.
2597260	2600660	Like it's like, unfortunately, all the missteps that Konami has made with Bimani up until
2600660	2603660	now, like makes everybody like, oh, yay, Rhythm Party's out.
2603660	2608900	But like, no, go like, I don't know what happened behind the scenes, but it is worth your time
2608900	2609900	to check out.
2609900	2613460	Well, the way they may be treating is like a retail game where they're going to hopefully
2613460	2618540	have a lot of DLC and then it's like, okay, I'm purchasing the, you know, a $60 game or
2618540	2621280	something because of all this $50 or DLC or something.
2621280	2622500	How much is the game by the way?
2622500	2623500	Is it 10 bucks?
2623500	2624500	10 bucks.
2624500	2625500	Yeah.
2625500	2626500	That's all right.
2626500	2627500	I guess.
2627500	2628500	I don't know.
2628500	2629500	It seems a little expensive.
2629500	2630500	It really depends how the DLC goes over.
2630500	2635620	Like I would really think it would be not that hard to just slap together a 10 pack
2635620	2640020	of, a song, a 10 pack of old DDR classics.
2640020	2641020	Yeah.
2641020	2643940	I realize if you're doing custom backgrounds for everything, maybe that takes a little
2643940	2648020	more time and art and so forth, but even they could get away with fudging it a little bit.
2648020	2651220	The old DDR games recycled a few things here and there recycle some art, some of the art
2651220	2655460	assets and just put out like 10 other DDR songs for free.
2655460	2658000	And then this game will have a really enhanced value.
2658000	2659000	I think it will.
2659000	2664240	And then put some, like, if you get some decent licenses, like they, they licensed gaga, somebody
2664240	2671660	paid for that, like, you know, but unfortunately it's one modern song and then two retro classics
2671660	2679860	with Bobby Black Wolf or Bobby Black Wolf, Bobby Black Wolf, AKA Vanilla Ice.
2679860	2682260	I actually liked the Vanilla Ice song.
2682260	2690100	Bobby Brown, Bobby, and that clip's going to end up on his show at some point.
2690100	2693340	Watch, uh, Bobby Brown and, uh, village people.
2693340	2694340	They're like the retro bigs.
2694340	2695340	That's really it.
2695340	2700020	And then the rest of the vanilla ice retro yet new, you know what, the songs, they're
2700020	2701020	not terrible.
2701020	2703740	They're not terrible.
2703740	2706980	They're not like, I'm going to go run out and buy the CD tomorrow, but they're better
2706980	2713420	than most of the stuff from dance masters, which was very unremarkable.
2713420	2717020	Dance masters was just frustrating and the fact that they're making an arcade game now
2717020	2719940	it's just, there was no cues whatsoever to what to do.
2719940	2726380	Yeah, and I understand that, you know, par games and stuff like that, you know, that
2726380	2730460	you have to learn the dances and stuff, but come on, Para at least had fucking arrows
2730460	2733380	that would kind of cue you into what to do.
2733380	2738500	Um, or clue you in, I should say cue you in, it's not a word, uh, clue you on what to do.
2738500	2742740	But even like even one of the games had an actual like character doing the actual dance
2742740	2744820	and stuff, but dance masters had nothing.
2744820	2747460	There was flash every once in a while.
2747460	2750220	It's like, how's it, how am I, how am I going to follow this?
2750220	2753540	The only reason I was ever able to do anything good at dance masters was that I knew the
2753540	2754540	Para Para.
2754540	2755540	Yeah.
2755540	2758460	There's only two, there's really only two Para Para songs in that whole game.
2758460	2759460	There really are.
2759460	2760460	There's five.
2760460	2762180	No, there's two.
2762180	2764180	There's um, yester, no.
2764180	2765180	Night of fire.
2765180	2766180	There are two.
2766180	2767180	Night of fire.
2767180	2768540	Uh, I thought there were two others.
2768540	2769540	I thought that they did.
2769540	2771460	Well maybe there's unlocks I never got to.
2771460	2772460	I don't know.
2772460	2773460	I thought like a virgin was in there.
2773460	2774460	No, I don't think so.
2774460	2775460	Unless.
2775460	2777500	I don't know, but anyway, whatever.
2777500	2781540	Uh, anyway, I've spent a lot of time talking about that song or that's talking about that
2781540	2785300	game, but uh, you know, just as I've been a fan of music games for so, so long, I was
2785300	2790100	just really surprised at what an unremarkable launch this game has had, but I think it's
2790100	2791100	worth your attention.
2791100	2792100	I really do.
2792100	2796620	And if anybody from Konami haha is listening, you might want to consider making rhythm party
2796620	2801020	the arcade game because I think, but maybe it needs a better name.
2801020	2803060	I don't think rhythm party is the best name.
2803060	2804740	You know, they're calling it in Japan.
2804740	2806920	Boom boom dance.
2806920	2807920	That's a better name.
2807920	2810740	Which is, but there's no boom, boom dollar in it.
2810740	2815180	And you know, you know why I bet they didn't call it that here because of boom, boom rocket.
2815180	2820140	Remember boom, boom rocket from EA like, um, God, that was about five years ago now.
2820140	2823300	I was an old ass, the one with little arrows that would come up and you do the fireworks
2823300	2828420	and I was like, okay, it says, I'm looking at here, it says that there's an achievement
2828420	2830340	for playing three Para Para genre songs.
2830340	2831340	Huh?
2831340	2834660	All right, well then maybe, well maybe there's like other songs that weren't in Para Para
2834660	2835660	paradise.
2835660	2836660	I just, I don't know.
2836660	2837660	I think that's what it was.
2837660	2838660	Maybe.
2838660	2839660	All right.
2839660	2840660	Whatever.
2840660	2841660	There are songs that I knew, but they weren't in Para Para paradise.
2841660	2842660	All right.
2842660	2843660	I believe you.
2843660	2844660	It's dance masters.
2844660	2847700	It wasn't, you know, but anyway, uh, okay.
2847700	2848940	That's it for my gaming week.
2848940	2850280	I've talked plenty.
2850280	2854660	So housekeeping real quick, follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio, or
2854660	2861780	of course there's Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R let's get into some news and Loki's
2861780	2862780	going to start us off tonight.
2862780	2865620	You got a lot of stuff about one particular company, right?
2865620	2870300	Um, and I also, I was going to say, here's the, the song list for dance masters.
2870300	2871300	Let's see.
2871300	2881980	So night of fire was one of, um, uh, yesterday was the other Para song and um, I don't know.
2881980	2886980	It might've been one of these other, uh, there's a lot of songs I don't recognize.
2886980	2891420	Maybe I can't stop falling in love super Euro version because that did have a Para.
2891420	2893220	That wasn't Para Para.
2893220	2894220	Okay.
2894220	2895220	That was a Para Para song.
2895220	2896220	I bet.
2896220	2897220	That's it then.
2897220	2898220	All right.
2898220	2899220	Mystery solved.
2899220	2900220	All right.
2900220	2901220	Fair enough.
2901220	2904100	If only it was that easy for companies to do well.
2904100	2909500	Uh, THQ on the other hand has been having a rough, a boom, boom fire of their own.
2909500	2914460	They've been having a rough, uh, rough year I should say.
2914460	2921180	Um, first, you know, was it weeks ago with rumors that they've gotten rid of their 2014
2921180	2924840	line up because of problems?
2924840	2928580	Maybe they're, maybe this is the smoke to the fire I guess.
2928580	2936380	Uh, first off, THQ received a, um, stock delisting notice and they basically have 180 calendar
2936380	2943460	days until July 23rd, um, to make the stock regain compliance for 10 consecutive business
2943460	2944460	days.
2944460	2950820	If the company can't comply, then they get taken off the stock market basically.
2950820	2956180	And of course, uh, their stock has fallen quite a bit down to about 70 cents a share.
2956180	2959420	Um, so that's not good.
2959420	2968020	Also the CEO, um, they've taken a, uh, 50% pay cut and also the, uh, board of directors
2968020	2971860	has, they've taken pay cuts as well.
2971860	2974580	Meaning $10 million as opposed to 20.
2974580	2980780	No, no, no, no, no, um, actually the CEO doesn't make
2980780	2981780	millions of dollars.
2981780	2984580	Uh, he does make quite a, you know, six figures.
2984580	2993460	He dropped his salary from $718,500 a year to $359,250 a year.
2993460	2997540	How's he going to scrape by is what I want to know, man, that's, that's some tough stuff
2997540	2998540	right there.
2998540	3001580	God, that's just disgusting.
3001580	3007820	Um, and then of course, you know, uh, some of the other, you know, they've cut from three
3007820	3013340	times the highest bonus to, was it the just as highest bonus ever.
3013340	3017580	At least he wasn't forced to take the, um, you know, Apple CEO at Steve jobs used to
3017580	3020020	get a dollar and then a bunch of stock options.
3020020	3021020	Yeah.
3021020	3023160	This guy wasn't forced to take the board.
3023160	3029940	The board of directors, uh, they've, uh, decided to take 50% less cash compensation for a year.
3029940	3039860	Um, also unfortunately with all these cuts and delisting threats come layoffs, uh, 240
3039860	3047580	people, um, were set to be laid off and it would be, uh, I guess cross, uh, nine months.
3047580	3053500	Um, they said it's, it should be a, let's see, you have time to finish whatever game
3053500	3054820	they were working on.
3054820	3055820	Yeah.
3055820	3060620	Uh, no, I don't believe 240, uh, 240 is the correct number.
3060620	3061620	It's up to 240.
3061620	3065740	I want to say it was a hundred and like 72 or something like that is what it's supposed
3065740	3066740	to be.
3066740	3072420	Um, and they said that this isn't anything that they were trying to hide, that the cuts
3072420	3078320	were described in their statement last week and that no studios are a part of this.
3078320	3082460	It's administration and publishing offices worldwide.
3082460	3090980	And, uh, you know, also, um, it's, you know, do the varying employment guidelines around
3090980	3094380	the world and internal finance considerations.
3094380	3100220	The restructuring will be completed by February or I'm not February, September 30th, 2012,
3100220	3103780	but most affected employees have already been notified.
3103780	3113460	Um, and then on top of all that, um, you know, they've revealed that they've lost $56 million
3113460	3121620	in a quarter three, which, uh, that would, uh, let's see, quarter ending in December
3121620	3123660	31st, 2011.
3123660	3126140	I'm kind of surprised that they lost a lot of money.
3126140	3131020	I guess they were just in the hole so much, um, that, you know, even though Saints Row
3131020	3141060	III and WWE 12 did good, um, or, well, I should say, um, it just wasn't enough to kind of
3141060	3143340	make up for the slump of sales.
3143340	3145980	And they actually had a pretty good quarter.
3145980	3149620	I mean, I think we started off with, I don't remember if Warhammer, no, I don't think Warhammer
3149620	3151740	was in the, in that quarter.
3151740	3157580	I think that was Q2, but anyways, regardless of that, one other game did come out in quarter
3157580	3162060	three for them and that would have been U-Draw and they're not putting out any more of those.
3162060	3167140	Is all of this like sad trombone stuff for THQ?
3167140	3169300	Is it all because of U-Draw or is there?
3169300	3173060	I don't think these, I don't think they could have, I mean, could one peripheral bring down
3173060	3177620	a company like that or is it because they're, their kiddie games are not doing too well
3177620	3182280	either, but their kiddie games not doing well, I don't think is a big deal because even this
3182280	3192140	year they focused more on, um, well, not entirely, more so on, um, kiddie, or less on kiddie
3192140	3193740	games, more on their core franchises.
3193740	3199500	However though, they did have a few games come out that were kind of kiddie that did
3199500	3200500	not do well.
3200500	3205740	Like, for example, they had Kung Fu Panda 2, which kind of bombed, and you know what,
3205740	3208860	it really is kind of their fault though, it bombed, I mean, let's see.
3208860	3213900	They had it on the PS3, which no one really buys kids games on the PS3, the Xbox 360 version
3213900	3218940	was Kinect required, the Wii version was U-Draw required, Wii right there, that is a problem,
3218940	3222180	see if they had it, you know, kind of, that is a prime audience right there and you're
3222180	3229060	really limiting it to people that buy your fucking tablet, which no one did, I mean,
3229060	3230220	it's just kind of annoying.
3230220	3235620	Dungeon Buster in our chatroom at chat.orangemanjr.com says Saints Row the Third and WWE 12 did well,
3235620	3238540	but U-Draw crapped all over the good news for both games.
3238540	3241260	It's just, it's really shocking to me, like, that U-Draw is...
3241260	3242260	I don't think it was that.
3242260	3245420	I don't think that that had a big...
3245420	3251340	But U-Draw was a huge investment for them, and I mean, nobody bought it.
3251340	3256780	Like the one on the Wii, that came out what, a year before, a couple years ago, that one
3256780	3261620	got bought, but didn't they try to put that U-Draw tablet on the PS3?
3261620	3262620	It was on PS3 and 360.
3262620	3264180	That was a huge mistake.
3264180	3265180	That was a huge mistake.
3265180	3268220	Yeah, it came out, that was what they were trying to debut and they were trying to debut
3268220	3269220	some other games.
3269220	3275060	I would argue, literally, no one bought it on the PlayStation 3.
3275060	3276940	I'd say probably close to no one bought it.
3276940	3280500	Yeah, obviously, that's what I really mean.
3280500	3284620	But then also, you know, they had the Penguins of Madagascar game and stuff like that that
3284620	3288180	came out that no one gave a shit about.
3288180	3294100	Is it maybe because if you tie into movies that aren't so successful at the box office,
3294100	3298140	like, wasn't that, or what penguin movie was that?
3298140	3300780	Well, it wasn't even a movie, it was just Penguins of Madagascar.
3300780	3303980	It's all the DreamWorks properties is what they had.
3303980	3308700	They had a SpongeBob game that no one gave a shit about that came out.
3308700	3311180	It just, that stuff doesn't do well anymore.
3311180	3317140	I mean, kind of, it's run its course and no one really cared about Puss in Boots the game.
3317140	3320860	I mean, it's just like, eh, whatever, you know?
3320860	3323140	Or the Penguins of Madagascar game, I mean...
3323140	3325300	Well, if you're five, you might.
3325300	3326300	Yeah, okay.
3326300	3327300	That's really who those games are for.
3327300	3328700	You might buy this for me on the Wii.
3328700	3329700	Oh, well, it requires U-Draw.
3329700	3331420	Well, fuck that, I'm not buying that.
3331420	3332420	You know, it's...
3332420	3335900	So I'm not gonna buy a seven-year-old peripheral for your game.
3335900	3343020	You know what I feel really bad about is Ubisoft with their, what is it, their awesome tablet
3343020	3348740	or whatever the fuck they called it, the Drawsome tablet, that they came out in December, the
3348740	3351500	hey, we're gonna get, we're gonna enter in this market, too.
3351500	3353700	It seems like they're doing well with that U-Draw.
3353700	3355740	We're gonna put ours out.
3355740	3357420	Pfft, tanked.
3357420	3361460	Does that mean we could expect something really awful to come to Ubisoft soon, or do you think
3361460	3362460	they had enough to keep them above water?
3362460	3365020	I don't think that they're gonna release anything else for it.
3365020	3367820	Luckily, they still have Assassin's Creed and enough things to kinda...
3367820	3369900	Oh, well, they actually do quite a bit.
3369900	3370900	No, no, I know, I know.
3370900	3374820	A lot less with kid stuff recently, but they do quite a bit in the...
3374820	3379700	Didn't Rocksmith do a little better than folks thought for like a really niche thing?
3379700	3382220	Because, see, I know people on Facebook that are playing it.
3382220	3384860	I would not have expected to be playing any video games at all.
3384860	3389540	I think it did okay, um, I mean, it hasn't really been a huge hit.
3389540	3396820	It did better than, um, was it the Six Strings Rise of, or was it the Rise of the Six Strings
3396820	3397820	Team?
3397820	3400820	Oh, yeah, that one kinda disappeared, didn't it?
3400820	3401820	Yeah.
3401820	3403900	Yeah, that wasn't very good.
3403900	3404900	Anyway.
3404900	3407180	That sounds dreadful.
3407180	3412500	Well, that's too bad for, um, you know, THQ.
3412500	3415060	I hope it doesn't impact Saints Row the 4th.
3415060	3417220	Oh, no, no, it won't.
3417220	3421420	I'm sure they're gonna do well, I mean, this year, like, kicking off things, they've got
3421420	3423940	UFC 3, which will do well for them.
3423940	3425740	That's in a couple weeks.
3425740	3432660	They're gonna have, um, you know, Darksiders 2 coming, I think, in like May-ish, um, then
3432660	3438180	of course, you know, they've got the South Park RPG game coming out later this year.
3438180	3439580	Well, that'll be good, I hope.
3439580	3447300	There'll be another WWE game, WWE 13, um, I'm sure there's gonna be some other, you
3447300	3454140	know, big franchises that they're gonna have, um, I don't think Saints Row the 4th would
3454140	3459340	be coming out any time soon, I would, I would hope not, I mean, I think it's too soon for
3459340	3463800	something like that, but they're gonna have DLC for the 3rd coming out, and I think that's
3463800	3471020	sold well for them, but, I don't know, I wouldn't worry about THQ, they're gonna be fine.
3471020	3472020	Alright.
3472020	3478520	But I would say, you know, that it, it really sucks that Nintendo didn't, um, embrace the
3478520	3482580	whole U-Draw tablet, but you kinda see why they didn't, because of the direction that
3482580	3483580	they went.
3483580	3486580	Well, now, yeah, now with the Wii U, they, it's, might do their own thing.
3486580	3492340	Hey, yeah, Nintendo may make a Mario Paint game for the Wii, or for the, uh, that U-Draw
3492340	3496720	tablet, or they're gonna hold on to it for a little longer and make a Mario Paint game
3496720	3499100	for the Wii U.
3499100	3500580	That's probably more like it.
3500580	3507180	Alright, well, speaking of the Wii U, um, Team Ninja has commented on the Wii U, talking
3507180	3512460	about it, saying that it's pretty easy to develop for, uh, this is from, uh, an interview
3512460	3516620	with Nintendo Gamer Magazine, where some of the folks from Team Ninja said that they're
3516620	3521940	finding it very similar to develop for Wii U as for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, which
3521940	3525740	is no surprise if what, it's true, what we've heard about the hardware in the past, that
3525740	3530140	it's very similar to, like, just kind of an over, over-drived Xbox, basically, is what
3530140	3531900	Nintendo Wii U is supposed to be.
3531900	3537340	Um, they also said that the Wii U hardware keeps changing, uh, that echo statements that
3537340	3544700	were made by, uh, Yoshinori Ono from Capcom last week, uh, apparently said something very
3544700	3550780	similar, that the Wii U keeps changing some of the hardware, um, they're asking these
3550780	3555220	developers from Team Ninja what they want from the hardware, and for feedback, uh, they
3555220	3559580	keep listening, making changes and so forth, the hardware keeps changing.
3559580	3562940	What we don't know is, what is changing about the hardware?
3562940	3568860	Now, my thought is, I wouldn't take the hardware is changing to mean, suddenly, this system
3568860	3573540	is not gonna have the tablet or any of that stuff, that's, that's here to stay, like,
3573540	3575100	that isn't going anywhere, right?
3575100	3579260	I think they're either, they're too well, they're, they've gone all in on that, so,
3579260	3583100	after last year's E3, they can't suddenly come out and say, well, we decided to scrap
3583100	3586740	the tablet, ha ha, you know, right?
3586740	3590060	They're gonna, they're just changing what's inside, because they don't fucking know, I
3590060	3595500	mean, it's like, they're like, well, we've got this box that represents, just imagine,
3595500	3600540	if you will, a console that'll do amazing things, imagine it, because we don't have
3600540	3605060	one yet, it's just this box that's sitting here that's actually, uh, well, it's about
3605060	3609660	time to commit, because, in a couple months, they're gonna have to show that to the world,
3609660	3615260	if they want to get that thing out this year, it's gotta be at E3, and it's gotta be good.
3615260	3618500	It better be, I'm telling ya.
3618500	3621780	Although if Team Ninja's developing for, uh, this, that means that, that, you know, where
3621780	3623500	the next Dead or Alive game's gonna show up.
3623500	3626140	No, I think it's Ninja Gaiden, they already said that they're gonna have a Ninja Gaiden
3626140	3627140	game for it.
3627140	3628140	Oh, that's right, they did.
3628140	3630020	And it's basically a port of Ninja Gaiden 3, so.
3630020	3633180	And Team Ninja and Nintendo have a little history, they did, uh, Team Ninja did the
3633180	3636940	Metroid Other M game, which, you know, although it didn't sell very well, it wasn't a bad
3636940	3638820	game, by any means, it's pretty neat.
3638820	3639820	Yeah.
3639820	3640820	So.
3640820	3641820	Interesting.
3641820	3642820	I just...
3642820	3643820	What?
3643820	3651860	I hope they don't fuck it up, I'm just saying, I mean, I, I think I'm, I'm hopeful that it'll
3651860	3653820	be a good system, but...
3653820	3659060	Just say the HG Mario and HZ Zelda game will be out this Christmas, and it'll, it'll print
3659060	3660060	money.
3660060	3661060	It will.
3661060	3662060	Keep your fingers crossed.
3662060	3665620	It has to put those key franchises on it, and that's really what's gonna drive the system.
3665620	3670400	And if, if you doubt what I'm saying, 3DS.
3670400	3674740	That thing did not start selling until they put the Zelda remake on it, and it sold a
3674740	3678300	little bit, and then when they put Mario Kart 7 and 3D Land on it, boom!
3678300	3679940	Now it's selling tons.
3679940	3680940	And when they dropped the price.
3680940	3681940	Oh yeah, that too.
3681940	3683940	That had a little bit to do with it.
3683940	3687140	That did have a little bit to do with it.
3687140	3690540	But well, then the price point is certainly important for the Wii U as well, you know,
3690540	3696860	if they get up on stage and say, Wii U is 599 US dollars, 599, no, no, no, no, no,
3696860	3697860	no, no.
3697860	3698860	Ridge Racer!
3698860	3699860	299.
3699860	3702020	It, it's gotta be 299, right?
3702020	3703660	No higher than 299.
3703660	3706860	It can't be 2, or it can't be higher than 299.
3706860	3707860	Yeah.
3707860	3708860	It's...
3708860	3709860	I...
3709860	3710860	I...
3710860	3711860	I...
3711860	3712860	You don't even want it to be 299.
3712860	3715220	I don't even see it being 299.
3715220	3719180	I mean, I don't know.
3719180	3720180	We'll see.
3720180	3724380	By the time we get there, I mean, the other consoles could be lower in price, I don't
3724380	3725380	know.
3725380	3726380	I'm...
3726380	3727380	I'm...
3727380	3732260	I'm gonna be sitting back and watching what happens, cause, I don't know.
3732260	3735660	Why don't they just say the games will only be 40 bucks, as opposed to 60?
3735660	3737140	That would go a long way.
3737140	3739260	It'll go a very long way.
3739260	3741860	Alright, anyhow.
3741860	3746540	Brakeman in her chatroom at chat.thatorangelaunchmedia.com says, I hope they change the name from Wii
3746540	3750380	2 to something else that would be easier for me to make penis jokes for it.
3750380	3753380	Well, there was some rumors last week that they are gonna change the name.
3753380	3759540	I don't know how much that will, uh, you know, really come to light.
3759540	3764820	RDGSinge in our chatroom says, anyway, it's probably three Gamecubes duct taped together.
3764820	3765820	Alright.
3765820	3769300	So, you were curious on, uh, Rocksmith sales?
3769300	3770300	Yeah.
3770300	3778420	We have 50,000 copies in the US on 360, uh, basically a total of, uh, 610,000 copies.
3778420	3783540	That's pretty, for what's essentially a really niche title, I really consider that, that's
3783540	3784940	pretty darn good.
3784940	3785940	I think.
3785940	3786940	Yeah.
3786940	3787940	So.
3787940	3788940	Alright.
3788940	3790940	Anyhow.
3790940	3791940	Let's move on.
3791940	3792940	DarkSakura.
3792940	3801180	Well, in other news, there is a proposition to put a one percent tax on violent video
3801180	3802180	games.
3802180	3803180	I know.
3803180	3804180	Stupid.
3804180	3809260	Um, this is actually coming from Oklahoma, which, it's Oklahoma.
3809260	3811140	Oh, Oklahoma.
3811140	3817580	Anyway, it was introduced by state representative William Forekiller.
3817580	3818580	Great name.
3818580	3824100	Forekiller, F-O-U-R-K-I-L-L-E-R, that any title that's rated teen, mature, and adult
3824100	3827460	only would fall under that spectrum.
3827460	3830780	That's the game that Team Ninja is making for the Wii U, actually, is Forekiller.
3830780	3831780	Go figure.
3831780	3834300	But you know what else that would include?
3834300	3839460	Dance Central 2 and Final Fantasy 13 2.
3839460	3845300	Oh, because those games are rated T for teen because of, um, what, language and all that
3845300	3846300	stuff, right?
3846300	3847300	I guess.
3847300	3850540	Um, but he wants to donate- Somebody said Hell in 13 2.
3850540	3852380	I was like, oh, no she didn't.
3852380	3857020	But the, um, well, what about all the crap they said in 7?
3857020	3859660	Yeah, Barrett said shit and- Well, anyway-
3859660	3862020	Does anyone ever drop the F bomb in a Final Fantasy game?
3862020	3863260	Final Fantasy fuck?
3863260	3866500	Can I finish?
3866500	3867500	No.
3867500	3875300	Anyway, half of the revenues that, um, would go to, uh, donate the childhood outdoor education
3875300	3882980	revolving fund, um, which is, uh, basically making kids get outside and play.
3882980	3887140	And the other half is the bully prevention revolving fund.
3887140	3894020	So it's, it's got a good heart behind it.
3894020	3901420	But I think that it's- Well, okay, actually, here's a good quote on here.
3901420	3906820	From the senior designer of Mass Effect 3, that's Manveer Hare, Air, I guess.
3906820	3910180	Oklahoma proposes a 1% tax on violent games.
3910180	3914820	Can I propose a 1% tax on stupid fucking ideas that are also unconstitutional?
3914820	3915820	Yeah.
3915820	3918260	I mean, this is going to be a losing battle.
3918260	3919900	We've already seen this stuff.
3919900	3924420	You heard us go off last week on the whole California has to pay the ESA of the Supreme
3924420	3925420	Court thing.
3925420	3926660	And I do get what you're saying.
3926660	3930340	I think it is like, you know, at the core of it, it's nice that he's trying to do something
3930340	3931340	for charity.
3931340	3932340	I guess.
3932340	3935220	But this just speaks- No one's asking him to do anything for charity.
3935220	3936700	Well, yeah, it's that.
3936700	3942020	And if you really want to tax violence, put a 1% tax on guns.
3942020	3944820	You know, put it on something that's across the board.
3944820	3948240	I do have- I have to say this.
3948240	3954700	To say that guns cause violence is the same thing that says pencils cause bad spelling.
3954700	3956960	Then put a 1% tax on pencils.
3956960	3959620	But the problem- Put the tax on a gun license.
3959620	3961120	Okay, fine.
3961120	3964460	The thing is, at least that's kind of constant.
3964460	3970860	But to put a 1% tax on a subset of video games strikes me as very odd.
3970860	3974100	Would you put a 1% tax on R-rated movies?
3974100	3977740	Would you put a 1% tax on- Well, no, because we're afraid of the MPAA.
3977740	3982020	Would you put a tax on 1% books that are not for young adults or children?
3982020	3988100	Like would you put a 1% tax on the, you know, I don't know, you know, entire fiction section
3988100	3989100	of Barnes and Noble?
3989100	3992060	We're gonna put a 1% tax on contraceptives.
3992060	3996860	Would you put a 1% tax on parental advisory labels on CDs?
3996860	3997860	I mean, no.
3997860	4000820	This is all- it's ridiculous in practice.
4000820	4004920	It's just- and it's somebody who does- that just speaks- you know, it's a big surprise.
4004920	4007700	A politician who doesn't get video games.
4007700	4009260	But it just really speaks to somebody.
4009260	4012540	And then, you know, did he try to use that hole for the children?
4012540	4013540	It's for the children.
4013540	4022180	Yes, pretty much, to combat childhood obesity, to stop bullying, and what I was going to
4022180	4028600	say about that is that he's basically trying to do the same thing that all these other
4028600	4033020	places have done to curtail the sale of these video games by making them more expensive
4033020	4037320	by putting a tax on it and sugarcoating it with a, oh, but this is gonna do all this
4037320	4038900	good if this goes by.
4038900	4042780	He's trying to trick the gullible, which unfortunately most of the public is.
4042780	4043780	Sorry.
4043780	4047340	And you know those violent video games, they pack on the pounds.
4047340	4052220	I'm telling ya, if I'm not, like, you know, killing people in a game, I'm just losing
4052220	4053220	weight.
4053220	4058220	Because, um, yeah, I don't understand the argument that, you know, putting a tax on
4058220	4064160	teen-rated and up games is gonna somehow get kids to be slimmer.
4064160	4068140	Because they're gonna be like, damn, I can afford that game, but I can't pay that 1%
4068140	4070140	tax, I better go outside and exercise.
4070140	4073820	I think you actually missed what I said about that.
4073820	4080220	He said that the proceeds were gonna be in half donated to services that get children
4080220	4082260	to go outside and exercise.
4082260	4088020	So that's the thing, is it's kinda like, it's indirectly for the children because I'm tying
4088020	4092180	this nice little charity and all the money's gonna go to good, but, you know.
4092180	4096220	Why don't you tax them, like, 500%, then they can't afford the games and they'll go out
4096220	4097220	and exercise.
4097220	4098780	And then the charities will get a ton of money.
4098780	4104340	I mean, I don't understand, why do we need a program to get people to go outside, I mean,
4104340	4105340	is it that bad?
4105340	4106980	Why don't parents do their fucking job?
4106980	4109100	End of story.
4109100	4110100	Parents do your job.
4110100	4112220	Your kids are fat, send them outside.
4112220	4113220	The end.
4113220	4115520	You know what I did when I was bored when I was a kid?
4115520	4116820	And I had a Nintendo?
4116820	4118820	I went and rode my bike.
4118820	4119820	Uphill.
4119820	4120820	Twice.
4120820	4121820	In the snow?
4121820	4122820	No.
4122820	4123820	We didn't have snow in Alabama, what are you talking about?
4123820	4125020	Or even better- In the swamp!
4125020	4126300	Which is worse than the snow.
4126300	4127300	Or even better.
4127300	4131540	Like, stop feeding your kids their sugary foods or whatever, you know, get them to go
4131540	4132540	outside.
4132540	4133540	I mean, come on.
4133540	4136460	There's a lot of contributing factors for people getting overweight.
4136460	4140420	It's not because you're just playing video games, it's because you're eating like shit
4140420	4142180	and you're sitting around doing nothing.
4142180	4143180	You know what, kids?
4143180	4147300	If you want to lose weight, you just need to have more unprotected sex.
4147300	4149820	It's exercise.
4149820	4153300	Sexercise.
4153300	4154300	I'm kidding, use a condom.
4154300	4155300	Please use a condom.
4155300	4160100	You told children to go have sex, that is so wrong.
4160100	4161740	But it's exercise?
4161740	4166660	That's for the public school system to tell our kids to go have sex.
4166660	4168020	That's where my good money's going.
4168020	4172140	Alright, now we need to change the topic, Loki.
4172140	4173460	You sure I don't have another topic?
4173460	4175460	Dark Soccer's left the room.
4175460	4180260	But, but we were just talking about...
4180260	4187180	So let's talk a little bit about our favorite topic, at least it has been the last few weeks,
4187180	4192500	and that is online passes.
4192500	4200060	And I kind of wonder if they don't understand what the online pass thing means, because
4200060	4205220	they're putting it on games that don't have online portions to them, they're not putting
4205220	4209700	it on games that have online portions to them, they're not locking people out with...
4209700	4211220	I just don't understand.
4211220	4217820	So first off, SSX, big sports, extreme sports game coming out from EA, it's gonna have an
4217820	4218820	online pass.
4218820	4221540	Not a big surprise, because they have a big online portion of it.
4221540	4226500	What's kind of neat about it though, is that the online pass, if you do not have it, will
4226500	4229980	not lock people out of playing multiplayer.
4229980	4236260	You just won't get any of the in-game credits used to unlock content while playing multiplayer.
4236260	4237260	So that's kind of cool.
4237260	4240580	You can at least play with your friends still if you have it used.
4240580	4246220	Wait, you mean to say that some companies find the value in not having an online pass?
4246220	4252060	Well come on, this is the same company that just put an online pass on an offline game.
4252060	4258100	And to be fair, that wasn't really an online pass, that was just free DLC that they labeled
4258100	4259540	something completely stupid.
4259540	4266900	It was like, instead of saying, ooh, free gift, it was like, pay money or get raped.
4266900	4270340	It's like, you know, not...
4270340	4273100	If you just called it a free gift, it wouldn't have sounded so bad.
4273100	4274100	Why'd you call it get raped?
4274100	4275820	I mean, that doesn't make any sense.
4275820	4277900	Why would you do that?
4277900	4282420	So they're doing that for SSX, and so if you don't want to buy the game, or if you rent
4282420	4286140	it, you can still play it online, you just won't be able to unlock your little tokens
4286140	4292820	or shit for your download content, or unlocking in-game things, big deal.
4292820	4298260	However what's kind of weird though is a co-op shooter, Syndicate, also coming out from EA,
4298260	4300940	is not going to have an online pass at all.
4300940	4302820	Just, eh, whatever reason.
4302820	4309460	They say we want little resistance or barriers to entry as possible.
4309460	4313640	I think a lot of guys say that too.
4313640	4314640	The co-op...
4314640	4316400	I had to come back in the room, didn't I?
4316400	4318780	The co-op is equal billing in this.
4318780	4323060	We wanted everyone who owns a copy of the game to have access to the entire product.
4323060	4327460	Well now that's fair, if they recognize that like the core element of their game is the
4327460	4332740	online part, you don't fucking gate it behind a pass, right?
4332740	4340140	But yet they do, for Battlefield 3, for Madden, for, you know, NBA, well they don't have an
4340140	4344380	NBA game, but when they do have another NBA game, probably this year, NBA Jam might have
4344380	4345380	one.
4345380	4349460	Oh no, because the Xbox 360 and PS3 are already online only.
4349460	4351460	Yeah, so...
4351460	4355180	And the Wii online, hahaha.
4355180	4361860	Need for Speed, I mean, all this shit had these online passes, but I do like the direction
4361860	4365740	they're going, and I want to fucking have every time that they have a goddamn online
4365740	4370740	pass that EA says, we stand behind this online pass, I want them to fucking quote what they
4370740	4371740	said.
4371740	4376220	Just as little resistance or barriers to entry as possible, because that's really what you're
4376220	4380340	doing is you're telling people, eh, we only want you the player games if you have the
4380340	4381340	money to buy it new.
4381340	4385260	If not, we don't really give a fuck, we want you to go away, because you cost us too much
4385260	4387620	money to run our servers.
4387620	4388620	God.
4388620	4392500	Oh, wait, wait, wait.
4392500	4394780	Yeah, I'll come back.
4394780	4399820	There was something I was going to rant about this week, and I just reminded myself.
4399820	4400820	Oh goody.
4400820	4404860	And I think it was something along the lines of this online pass thing.
4404860	4407620	We'll get to that later.
4407620	4409900	Alright.
4409900	4411940	Is there another story coming up later that's going to prompt that?
4411940	4417740	I don't think so, but it was something I posted on Twitter, and I had to refresh my memory.
4417740	4419540	Just explode on the rant at a random point in the show.
4419540	4424020	It was something about how used games steal money from developers, I think it was.
4424020	4425020	Oh yes, so it was.
4425020	4426620	Alright, look, well moving on.
4426620	4433140	Old games still give money to the folks that own the rights to them these days, and old
4433140	4437140	games will suddenly become new again on the 3DS, and the old games are coming from the
4437140	4438780	Game Gear.
4438780	4443340	That's right, apparently virtual console games for a non-Nintendo platform, of course in
4443340	4449220	this case Sega, have shown up for 3DS release by the good old ESRB, who has spoiled the
4449220	4453140	releases of Shinobi and Sonic Triple Trouble.
4453140	4455100	So those games apparently have been spotted.
4455100	4459820	To be fair, the ESRB, remember that one of the things that they could do, that the publishers
4459820	4463740	could tell them not to list their stuff on there, so it's the fucking publisher's fault.
4463740	4467260	Yeah, they might have forgot to check that box in the forum, who knows.
4467260	4472140	Now it's worth noting that at some point TurboGrafx-16 games were supposed to be available on the
4472140	4476080	3DS, but who knows if that's really going to happen anymore at some point because there's
4476080	4477080	no more Hudson.
4477080	4483580	Well, doesn't Konami inherently own all their old licenses, or am I wrong?
4483580	4484580	Couldn't Konami?
4484580	4485580	I think they do, yeah.
4485580	4486580	I think they could.
4486580	4487580	I think they do, so I don't know.
4487580	4492300	But anyhow, yeah, so Game Gear games are on their way to the 3DS, but let's be real, Dark
4492300	4495380	Soccer is going to bitch slap me for this, but were there really any that good Game Gear
4495380	4496380	games?
4496380	4497380	Yes!
4497380	4498380	What?
4498380	4499380	Gunstar Heroes.
4499380	4503660	Was that really a Game Gear game?
4503660	4505980	I bought it for Dan for 30 bucks.
4505980	4506980	Oh, that's right.
4506980	4507980	I remember that.
4507980	4509460	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4509460	4512820	There were really good, I think there was Puyo Puyo.
4512820	4515260	There was Sonic Spinball.
4515260	4518460	The Lion King game, of all things, was actually really good on Game Gear.
4518460	4522380	So yeah, there were a lot of really good games.
4522380	4527180	The Disney games on Genesis and all that stuff were, like Aladdin and shit, were like really
4527180	4528180	good.
4528180	4532460	It was like an interesting phase where like Sega and Disney just kind of had this really
4532460	4534060	great harmony going on.
4534060	4537580	And if I do recall correctly, I think there were a number of Master System games that
4537580	4540420	were converted for Game Gear use, so.
4540420	4544580	All I remember were that those things were so fucking huge and just drained your batteries.
4544580	4547620	But now, you know, the 3DS will drain your battery.
4547620	4549260	It'll be about as fast.
4549260	4553980	But at least you can recharge your 3DS without having to go buy AA batteries.
4553980	4557700	So Dark Sakura is going to read us a story and then we're going to get to the release
4557700	4558900	dates.
4558900	4564300	Once upon a time, there was a game called Skyrim, and everyone was like, oh my god,
4564300	4570780	the menu sucks, so people hacked it and put out little ads for it on PC.
4570780	4576820	Well, finally, the people at Bethesda were like, I guess people really don't like how
4576820	4579700	we do this and want different stuff for the game.
4579700	4585100	So there is a PC creation kit coming out for The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim, and it will be
4585100	4588860	on Steam on Tuesday.
4588860	4597100	And it's, uh, you can apparently just download it in the tools tab.
4597100	4599960	So I guess people will be happy for it.
4599960	4603700	I'm slowly starting to regret not getting Skyrim on the PC.
4603700	4606580	I wish a lot of these cool things would come to like the PlayStation 3.
4606580	4608180	I thought some of it was supposed to.
4608180	4610220	I could be wrong, though.
4610220	4613580	But like, I've looked like Alan is he's in there playing Skyrim right now.
4613580	4617300	He's hacked the shit out of that game, like, you know, well, I mean, like, he's still playing
4617300	4618300	by the rules.
4618300	4619300	Mostly.
4619300	4620300	I don't think he's really cheated a lot.
4620300	4623820	But, you know, like his interface doesn't even look right to me.
4623820	4626220	Like it's all but it's it's really well organized.
4626220	4627220	I like it.
4627220	4629420	It's just like he's just done so many hacks to it.
4629420	4632740	How many of us have wow that look exactly like it did when we first got it?
4632740	4633740	That's true.
4633740	4634740	That's true.
4634740	4635740	But that is something that Blizzard embraces.
4635740	4639300	And that's part of why it's better than a lot of MMOs, by the way.
4639300	4643300	But anyway, let's travel around the world and look at release dates and talk about games
4643300	4645900	that you'll be able to hack soon in a store near you.
4645900	4648060	Loki, we'll start with the U.S. dates.
4648060	4654600	There's actually some stuff this week, not really a game, but Connect for Windows came
4654600	4655600	out this week.
4655600	4657600	So that's neat.
4657600	4663900	OK, so next week we've got some stuff re-released at Fallout New Vegas, the Ultimate Edition
4663900	4665520	with all the DLC included.
4665520	4671580	They have that coming out on all three systems, PS3, 360, and the PC.
4671580	4676740	The Darkness 2 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC as well.
4676740	4681740	The Jak and Daxter Collection for PS3 will be coming out.
4681740	4689820	Resident Evil Revelations with an extra I, at least on the packaging.
4689820	4694140	And that's coming out on 3DS only.
4694140	4701460	Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
4701460	4708020	We also have the Zumba Fitness Rush on Xbox 360.
4708020	4711380	That'll be out on Sunday.
4711380	4715260	And uh, yeah.
4715260	4716260	That's it.
4716260	4723620	Oh, oh, and as I remember, remind you, the 3DS Circle Pad Pro will be out in GameStop.
4723620	4725620	Yay.
4725620	4728520	Irritated.
4728520	4734540	Is there any chance if I wait it out it'll come to another retailer?
4734540	4739360	I guess there's nothing I need it for right now, so I'm just gonna hold my breath.
4739360	4742140	Let's go to Japan and take a look at what's coming out over in Japan.
4742140	4744360	Xbox 360's looking a little dry this week.
4744360	4748520	Just a game getting a price reduction, that's Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition.
4748520	4751300	It's a price reduction this week on the 9th.
4751300	4755860	Heading on over to the PlayStation 3 and checking out what's coming there.
4755860	4760860	Same thing, price reduction there, but there's also a game from Atlus called The Cursed Crusade
4760860	4762740	comes out from Atlus this week.
4762740	4763740	The Cursed Crusade?
4763740	4764740	The Cursed Crusade.
4764740	4766020	I could see it.
4766020	4767020	Cursehead though.
4767020	4771580	Um, I'm trying to see what- That hasn't come out over there yet?
4771580	4772580	No, I guess not.
4772580	4773580	I'm surprised.
4773580	4775180	It came out over here back in October.
4775180	4776180	I don't think it's a price reduction.
4776180	4777740	No, it's definitely not a price reduction.
4777740	4781060	It might be like a localized version for them.
4781060	4782660	So, interesting.
4782660	4786100	Uh, so yeah, that's coming out this week.
4786100	4790340	Well, sometimes they get the games a little later than we do, you know?
4790340	4795940	Uh, remember the PlayStation Vita Vita Vegemans already out in Japan, so they have some new
4795940	4796940	games this week.
4796940	4802100	Gravity Days comes out this week, and Sumioni, I think I'm saying that right, comes out this
4802100	4803100	week on the Vita.
4803100	4807780	Um, I'm trying to see if this is a game- I'm trying to see if this looks familiar to me.
4807780	4812900	I'm looking at a little trailer for Sumiomi here in the studio to see if it's one that
4812900	4814900	I recognized.
4814900	4817980	I like the art style in this game.
4817980	4822060	Uh, I've seen the, uh- It looks a little bit like Okami.
4822060	4824580	Oh, it's an ink game.
4824580	4827060	Sumie is a type of drawing with ink.
4827060	4828180	It looks like the background there.
4828180	4830860	I saw this when they were talking about, uh, Vita stuff.
4830860	4832980	I actually saw the video for it.
4832980	4835620	I don't remember what's being called over here though.
4835620	4839820	But that game is coming out this week in Japan, because, you know, they already have the Vita
4839820	4841340	over there.
4841340	4846580	Uh, looking at the other handheld real quick, I'm just gonna look really quickly at the
4846580	4848900	Wii, see if there's anything worth mentioning, no.
4848900	4851560	Um, how about the 3DS though?
4851560	4852560	Not really.
4852560	4853560	Nothing until the 14th.
4853560	4857820	Nude Love Plus comes out on the 14th, with plenty of art book limited editions if you
4857820	4858820	want to check that out.
4858820	4860500	I thought for a second there you said Nude Love Plus.
4860500	4861500	I was like- No.
4861500	4863220	Oh no, that would be a whole different- Well played!
4863220	4865900	That would be a whole different 3DS game right there.
4865900	4867860	Alright, that does it for Japanese releases.
4867860	4868860	Dark Sakura?
4868860	4873820	On this, um, in the UK on the 7th we have Combat Wings The Great Battles of World War
4873820	4878260	II, Gotham City Impostors- Sorry.
4878260	4881620	House of the Dead 3 and The Simpsons Arcade for PS3.
4881620	4886200	On the 8th of February we have more Gotham City crap.
4886200	4888280	On the 9th we have Cell Emergence.
4888280	4894420	On the 10th, Catherine for Xbox 360 and PS3, that game is messed up.
4894420	4900380	EA Sports Grand Slam Tennis 2, Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning, uh, Mario and Sonic at the
4900380	4906540	London Olympic Games on 3DS, One Piece Unlimited Cruise Special, and The Darkness 2.
4906540	4908060	That's it.
4908060	4912700	Alrighty, just a couple more stories for you guys, then we're gonna get to the classic
4912700	4914880	game of the week, but first-
4914880	4923140	So, there's some talk saying, you know, Iwata is actually interested in doing some, you
4923140	4925820	know, microtransactions with the Wii U.
4925820	4933820	One of the pieces of technology that they may be incorporating for the Wii U is near-field
4933820	4940460	communication, which will allow you to, for example, read credit cards if, you know, those
4940460	4944440	have like, you know, the pay pass thing, I don't remember what they call them.
4944440	4948500	I think it's pay pass, it's basically that kind of communication where you touch the
4948500	4953140	credit card up to the machine and away you go.
4953140	4958500	Or you know, like, Skylanders sort of has that, so, but they're saying that, you know,
4958500	4964620	it can provide a system in which consumers can use e-money, they'll find it much more
4964620	4971380	easily be able to make payments by then entering credit card numbers or by purchasing Nintendo
4971380	4976540	prepaid cards at the store.
4976540	4981340	You know, of course, they're, you know, trying to support DLC, but they want to do it in
4981340	4985660	a way that's not, you know, crazy.
4985660	4994380	Also, they're throwing out the idea that, you know, maybe, maybe Super Mario Land 3D
4994380	5001220	or Mario Kart may get DLC, which I would be happy with that, I think they should do that.
5001220	5007500	You know, what if we could provide add-on content through the network, posing the question
5007500	5008500	there.
5008500	5013180	As I referred to before, for example, like everyone else does, yeah, this idea of supplying
5013180	5017740	new stages as Super Mario users who want to play the game more, but have completed the
5017740	5023760	game and lost interest in existing state or in the, you know, existing stages, this will
5023760	5029980	not only give us new profits, but then lengthen the life of the product and that it will never
5029980	5035420	appear to be out of fashion and can keep attracting public attention as long as many people play
5035420	5036420	it.
5036420	5037420	No shit!
5037420	5040420	People have been doing this for fucking years now, and you just figured this out?
5040420	5042420	Oh my God.
5042420	5043420	That's fantastic.
5043420	5047300	Yeah, I can't wait to see what breakthrough ideas will come with the Wii U.
5047300	5051860	Hey, hey guys, we're gonna have this, we're gonna have this thing called online.
5051860	5056620	People can play without being in the same room.
5056620	5062580	You have to admit, as behind the times as Nintendo is, there is almost that benefit
5062580	5067180	to them being behind the times that you don't have this online pass garbage on any of the
5067180	5068180	Nintendo games.
5068180	5069180	Yes you do.
5069180	5070180	Do you?
5070180	5071180	Yes you do.
5071180	5072180	Which game?
5072180	5073180	What?
5073180	5074180	You have the U-Pass that's on the...
5074180	5075180	God, really?
5075180	5082300	And the online passes do apply to the Wii games for Madden, for example, has online
5082300	5086780	pass, I believe, and it's just a lot of those corgis.
5086780	5088780	Well then I stand corrected.
5088780	5094860	Yeah, unfortunately they do have that stuff, they are not exempt from it.
5094860	5098020	It's just that there's not a lot of big games that come out, so that's why you don't hear
5098020	5099020	a lot of it.
5099020	5105780	But yeah, I mean, come on, they do these really amazing things sometimes, like the 3D is kind
5105780	5109700	of cool, you know, the motion controls and stuff like that, and at the same time, say
5109700	5114400	hey we got this one cool thing, oh but we forgot to like totally update everything else.
5114400	5116940	It's just like, oh shit you guys want HD graphics?
5116940	5117940	Well we didn't fucking do that.
5117940	5118940	Oh, online?
5118940	5119940	Nah.
5119940	5120940	But hey, you got motion controls?
5120940	5121940	I mean, isn't that what you wanted?
5121940	5122940	Something new?
5122940	5125100	Hey, 3D, it's got 3D, that's awesome.
5125100	5126100	DLC?
5126100	5128060	Ah fuck, well we just didn't do DLC yet.
5128060	5131980	We're gonna patch it in later, I'm sure, you know, we will eventually, and we'll support
5131980	5132980	it someday.
5132980	5139660	You know, maybe, yeah, we'll put out another system or something, I'll have DLC in there.
5139660	5147460	Let me rephrase the point I made earlier, since Loki owned me.
5147460	5152700	Because most of the stuff worth buying on the Wii is from Nintendo themselves, and Nintendo's
5152700	5156460	buying the times, we don't have any of this online pass garbage.
5156460	5157460	Exactly.
5157460	5159660	Okay, at least we can agree on that.
5159660	5165020	Alright, well, congrats to Nintendo for getting on the DLC train, I guess, I just hope they
5165020	5166860	don't go overboard with all this.
5166860	5170660	Now we know how to charge people, yay.
5170660	5177900	Alright, sometimes your money just goes to these very interesting places where you just
5177900	5181660	wish you'd never spent it in the first place, and I think that's what a lot of Mass Effect
5181660	5182940	fans are feeling this week.
5182940	5185300	No, I'm not talking about the game, don't worry.
5185300	5187700	But I am talking about the spinoff book series.
5187700	5191580	A book came out this, I guess, I don't know if it was last week or about a month ago,
5191580	5193860	called Mass Effect Deception.
5193860	5198140	And apparently the book has just got tons and tons of errors.
5198140	5205180	And I'm talking like the type that, if you're a lore nerd, are just like terribly bad errors.
5205180	5211060	For example, oh, actually they have put together a document, I guess, online on Google, that's
5211060	5218740	a pretty neat community idea, that has 80 errors in the book, all together.
5218740	5224860	I'm trying to actually pull this up right now and see if, they talk about like the Citadel
5224860	5227340	is the wrong state.
5227340	5232260	One of the characters kills an alien by slicing into the back of its neck and severing the
5232260	5237300	spine, but you can't really do that with this type of alien because they're not biologically
5237300	5238300	set up that way.
5238300	5242900	So it's like, it's almost like, you know how like when Star Trek kind of gets the canon
5242900	5244860	wrong and the fans are up in arms?
5244860	5247340	Like the whole series of Enterprise?
5247340	5254980	So like 80 different errors they've all put together and stuff and yeah, timeline errors
5254980	5255980	and things like that.
5255980	5261620	So apparently it's gotten to the point where BioWare actually came out and said, the teams
5261620	5266220	at Delray and BioWare would like to extend our sincerest apologies to the Mass Effect
5266220	5271940	fans for any errors and oversights made in the recent novel, Mass Effect Deception.
5271940	5276380	We are currently working on a number of changes that will appear in future editions of the
5276380	5277780	novel.
5277780	5283340	I don't know how that, so in other words, they're going to, it was all a dream or, you
5283340	5285260	know, alternate timeline.
5285260	5286980	That whole book was an alternate universe.
5286980	5287980	Surprise.
5287980	5291780	This is what happens when you write books like you write games.
5291780	5295240	Can't fucking patch a book.
5295240	5296700	You cannot patch a book.
5296700	5303020	Oh, you can, apparently you just, you know, print it later, but, oh yeah, that's not everything.
5303020	5306900	Like, hey the Wii, can't patch anything, so we better get it right the first time.
5306900	5310980	Or we'll have to put out, no, because remember what they had to do for the Zelda save games?
5310980	5316060	They had to put out the Zelda save game patching channel.
5316060	5321780	You have to admit that's kind of funny.
5321780	5322780	Kind of funny.
5322780	5324660	That's kind of terrible.
5324660	5327020	Always a hoot and a holler here on the show.
5327020	5332020	The classic game of the Wii.
5332020	5335420	Mark Sacker likes to dive into the classic gaming vault every week and pull out a game
5335420	5340180	that she thinks, hey, back in my day, you didn't have patches.
5340180	5342820	You took your games glitchy and you liked it.
5342820	5343820	Yeah.
5343820	5347620	And if they were glitchy, they were collector's items.
5347620	5349020	Exactly.
5349020	5351500	So here it is, the classic game of the Wii.
5351500	5352500	Is it a glitchy title?
5352500	5353500	Not really.
5353500	5354500	But it's full of bugs, right?
5354500	5355500	Full of viruses.
5355500	5358500	Alright, what's the classic game of the Wii?
5358500	5359500	Dr. Mario.
5359500	5363700	It's been a while since I've done a puzzle game, I think, so I had to do Dr. Mario.
5363700	5365940	And stupid me didn't link the YouTube.
5365940	5366940	Fail.
5366940	5367940	It's alright.
5367940	5368940	Haha.
5368940	5373780	We'll play the QT music and I'll bring in the Dr. Mario music when I can.
5373780	5374780	Well, Dr. Mario.
5374780	5375780	I need a patch.
5375780	5378060	Dr. Mario came out in 1990.
5378060	5382740	It was designed by Gunpei Yokoi and it was produced by Takahiro Harada.
5382740	5387540	It came out on the Nintendo Entertainment System and it was super fun.
5387540	5391180	You got to play as Mario who became a doctor.
5391180	5392180	Plumber to doctor.
5392180	5393180	Go fig.
5393180	5399180	And his point is to eradicate really, really deadly viruses that look like ugly mofos.
5399180	5403900	One of them looks like a really retarded rabbit, too.
5403900	5408700	So it's basically a falling block style game, kind of like how Tetris did.
5408700	5414220	And you line up the colors matching the corresponding colors of the viruses.
5414220	5419580	And when you stack three of the same color on top of the virus, then it destroys the
5419580	5420740	virus.
5420740	5421860	And you keep going.
5421860	5423940	And oh my god, I was good at this game.
5423940	5425540	I mean, really good at this game.
5425540	5426540	I'm not kidding.
5426540	5431580	I would, like, you had a max level of 20 that you could select and then you could just keep
5431580	5432780	going from there.
5432780	5437260	And I could go, like, into the, I was really good at it.
5437260	5438260	Anyway.
5438260	5439580	And so humble, too.
5439580	5444380	I'm not gonna, the game's kind of hard not to be good at, you know?
5444380	5447700	I mean, unless you just have really awful reflexes.
5447700	5453940	Anyway, there are all kinds of other versions, different ports and things that have come
5453940	5455460	out, too.
5455460	5460580	It was re-released on the Game Boy Advance as part of the classic NES series.
5460580	5467180	And there were versions of it that was, there's a minigame in WarioWare Inc., Mega Microgames,
5467180	5471900	and Brain Age 2, more training and minutes a day.
5471900	5477460	But let's see what else that we have with this, because you also have, your playfield
5477460	5479020	is a bottle.
5479020	5481340	And so he's throwing it into a bottle.
5481340	5483780	And you've got as much space as your bottle allows.
5483780	5489180	And honestly, on screen, it's fairly small, especially man on the 13-inch TV that I played
5489180	5490180	on.
5490180	5492540	Can't go blind playing that thing.
5492540	5497060	So let's hear about some of the people that probably had problems that this game was pushing
5497060	5499020	pills to kids.
5499020	5504020	Because I'm sure I've heard that story somewhere before.
5504020	5509460	I know you might not have it in front of you, but I know some fucking old ladies club probably
5509460	5510460	complained.
5510460	5513740	And Dr. Mario teaches my kids about drugs!
5513740	5516060	You see how many drugs old people pop?
5516060	5517060	Hello?
5517060	5523860	Anyway, it also did have a multiplayer mode where two players could compete against each
5523860	5526900	other to clean their different fields out.
5526900	5530340	And basically you just had to get rid of your viruses before they got rid of theirs, but
5530340	5534900	it had more capsules fall on the opposing side.
5534900	5538900	My little sister and I would play that hours on end.
5538900	5543540	There was, of course, it was done by Yokoi, who was the guy that gave us the Game Boy
5543540	5546020	and the Game & Watch.
5546020	5553660	And Takahiro Harada, who was the producer, was the producer on Metroid.
5553660	5558380	And a lot of the music actually that ended up, some of the music that ended up in Super
5558380	5566020	Smash Bros. Brawl, was the guy that did that actually became one of the presence of Creatures
5566020	5572020	Inc., which owned a third of the copyright regarding Pokemon, just to show that little
5572020	5573020	correlation.
5573020	5576500	Were you gonna say something?
5576500	5579800	Gotta eradicate them all.
5579800	5582100	There were lots of different versions and ports.
5582100	5586900	There was a Nintendo versus system that brought out versus Dr. Mario.
5586900	5589100	So there was an arcade version.
5589100	5594180	And like I said, there was a GBA version in 2004 that was part of the classic NES series.
5594180	5597100	Or in Japan it was called the Famicom miniseries.
5597100	5602540	And then there was a version in Puzzle League in 2005, it was Dr. Mario in Puzzle League.
5602540	5611660	2003 there was the release of a Nintendo GameCube preview disc that had, you could download
5611660	5613980	the NES version of Dr. Mario to your Game Boy Advance console.
5613980	5615300	That was pretty cool.
5615300	5618940	You see that little cable deal that came out?
5618940	5623660	There was an enhanced version that came with Tetris on the Super Nintendo, that was Tetris
5623660	5626540	and Dr. Mario, that came out on December 30th, 1994.
5626540	5631420	Why not bring it out before then, you know, Christmas, blah.
5631420	5639820	It was also re-released in Japan on March 30th, 1997, and was downloadable for the Satellaview.
5639820	5642540	It was called Dr. Mario BS Version.
5642540	5646220	Because the Satellaview is the BS Satellaview.
5646220	5648860	Can I play some music for one of the other versions here?
5648860	5649860	Sure.
5649860	5662620	We're going to go to the Mario 64 version here.
5662620	5665260	Same song but a little souped up.
5665260	5666260	Yep.
5666260	5673620	But yeah, it was also downloadable for the Nintendo Power Cartridges in Super Famicom
5673620	5675620	and Game Boy.
5675620	5682620	And then it's on the 21st anniversary of its release in 2011, the original Game Boy version
5682620	5688820	was made available for the 3DS to download.
5688820	5695260	Basically parents, this is what you were talking about, they said that there was a parent,
5695260	5703260	parents had issues about the inclusion of medicine, and there was a review by Ace that
5703260	5710700	gave it a 510 out of 1000 points because it said it reeked of plagiarism and that it was
5710700	5713340	worse than the games it was modeled after.
5713340	5715180	Which is pretty stupid to me.
5715180	5716180	What?
5716180	5717180	I know.
5717180	5720300	I wonder, you know, I'm going to actually check Ace real quick and see if they still
5720300	5721300	exist.
5721300	5725700	Ace Games magazine, nope, they were applied by EMAP.
5725700	5729060	Oh my god, I remember this magazine now.
5729060	5732620	The Amiga format and ST titles, oh wow.
5732620	5735460	So yeah, anyway, keep going.
5735460	5739500	There were, it was really just a good game.
5739500	5747540	A lot of people really loved it, you know, it was very simple graphically but it got,
5747540	5748540	it made its point.
5748540	5752580	It was fun and simple to play and that's the point of the game.
5752580	5756380	It was enough challenging to keep you playing it because I would play this game for hours,
5756380	5758500	I can tell you that.
5758500	5763020	But yeah, like you said, there were other follow ups.
5763020	5768060	There was Dr. Mario 64, like we're listening to right now, that had other game modes too
5768060	5775260	and other characters including Wario, because at the time Wario Land 3 was out.
5775260	5779620	And it came out in Japan under the Nintendo Puzzle Collection.
5779620	5783780	But Wario wasn't a doctor, he was just a nurse practitioner.
5783780	5791740	Dr. Mario Online RX, which I guess for prescription, came out in 2008 on the Wii so you could play
5791740	5794580	online versus the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.
5794580	5798100	So I do want to say to AlphaKananagram in our chatroom at chat.orangeslantreo.com who says
5798100	5802780	Nintendo release Dr. Mario 3DS online, put it on the Nintendo network.
5802780	5804380	There is the Wii one.
5804380	5807940	I mean, granted, you might be specifically wanting a handheld, but there is an online
5807940	5809100	version available.
5809100	5813060	And then there was Dr. Mario Express that came out in 2009 for the DSi.
5813060	5814500	Not multiplayer.
5814500	5815500	Boo.
5815500	5824900	Dr. Mario is a secret character in Smash Brothers Melee and they actually had an attack based
5824900	5829220	on it in Brawl and it had the chill music from the game.
5829220	5834860	So I mean, there's lots of cool stuff and actually that music was arranged by the guy
5834860	5837620	that did music for Magical Drop.
5837620	5843260	There's all kinds of neat little crossovers there, don't you think?
5843260	5845260	So that's it.
5845260	5846260	Alright.
5846260	5847260	Dr. Mario.
5847260	5850360	There it is, your classic game of the week, Dr. Mario.
5850360	5855300	For the NES, really, but available on pretty much every Nintendo system since then.
5855300	5856300	In one way or another.
5856300	5858860	Including the Game Boy, I saw one there on YouTube.
5858860	5861180	I think I owned it on Game Boy, actually.
5861180	5863780	I don't think I owned it on NES, I owned it on Game Boy.
5863780	5866140	I want to play the Satellaview version.
5866140	5868140	The BS one?
5868140	5869140	No.
5869140	5871580	The BS, yeah.
5871580	5878660	But we've actually got like a Satellaview ROM of the Zelda game.
5878660	5880340	It's really good.
5880340	5883820	So I can imagine what the Dr. Mario one looks like.
5883820	5884820	Alright.
5884820	5888100	Well, that's going to do it for part A of our show tonight, but we're not done yet,
5888100	5889100	guys.
5889100	5890100	We've got plenty more to come.
5890100	5893060	We're going to talk about some other things when we get back from a quick break here,
5893060	5899420	including some Xbox-related announcements and news, Sony possibly in trouble, according
5899420	5900420	to somebody.
5900420	5901420	So we'll talk a little bit about that.
5901420	5906580	And then, of course, your Twitter topics at twitter.com slash O-L-R, and your emails at
5906580	5911300	mailbag at orangelandtrader.com, and, because it is a show where every gamer has a voice,
5911300	5916380	there's many ways to contact us, the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on
5916380	5920580	Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, we will be taking all of those calls a little later on, right
5920580	5922100	after a quick break.
5922100	5923100	So stay tuned, guys.
5923100	5930100	We'll be right back.
5930100	5936540	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live with episode number 444 on this
5936540	5938820	February the 5th of 2012.
5938820	5943380	You know, there's this football game going on, and Loki was mentioning that he was watching,
5943380	5948760	he's catching up now on the good stuff, the commercials, and he just said, what, the Battleship
5948760	5951260	movie might not be so bad, from what you're looking at?
5951260	5955060	No, it's gonna be terrible, but it's just one of those movies that you don't really,
5955060	5958500	I mean, come on, it's a movie based on Battle...
5958500	5963980	In name, pretty much only, and there's ships in it, I mean, that's the only way it's even
5963980	5964980	remotely related to the Fortnite.
5964980	5965980	Who's in that?
5965980	5966980	Liam Neeson?
5966980	5967980	Liam Neeson.
5967980	5968980	I just really want to...
5968980	5969980	He dies, though, unfortunately.
5969980	5970980	Way to ruin it!
5970980	5971980	Way to ruin it!
5971980	5974860	He's in the trailer, you can fucking tell that he dies, I mean, come on.
5974860	5977660	He better not die, if he doesn't fucking die, then that's great.
5977660	5983940	I really want that clip of Liam Neeson that's like, E5!
5983940	5986500	You sunk my Battleship!
5986500	5990660	It just looks ridiculous, it's just like, it could be Transformers 4 or whatever, I
5990660	5995180	mean, it's just pretty much, I don't know, I'm down with it, cause I mean, come on, look
5995180	5999620	back at like, Independence Day, how fucking cheesy was that movie, I mean, it was so cheesy.
5999620	6001540	I did see Snakes on a Plane.
6001540	6002540	Yeah?
6002540	6006340	In the theater at Disneyland.
6006340	6008300	Did they get the motherfucking snakes off the motherfucking plane?
6008300	6016060	It was me, Kristen, and Megsy, wearing giant plushy snakes wrapped around us in the movie
6016060	6017060	theater.
6017060	6020700	You dressed up to go see Snakes on a Plane!
6020700	6025420	We got the snakes at the, um, Jungle Trader.
6025420	6029660	We did something similar, we watched it at our work, they had a movie screening in our
6029660	6035340	theater, we had rubber snakes that we were throwing during the movie, that was kind of
6035340	6036340	fun.
6036340	6038340	But yeah, the Avengers trailer's awesome.
6038340	6043740	I have had it with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane!
6043740	6045540	Everybody strap in!
6045540	6049140	I'm about to open some fucking windows.
6049140	6050140	That was a cool scene.
6050140	6051140	I love Samuel L. Jackson.
6051140	6055940	I like when the giant snake ate that one dude.
6055940	6060860	And I gotta admit though, it would be, I would be all for them making a sequel where it takes
6060860	6065860	place on a space shuttle with Samuel L. Jackson and Snakes on a Shuttle.
6065860	6070900	Well you know that someone tried to do a knockoff called Snakes on a Train.
6070900	6072700	Yeah, yeah, that's the directed video.
6072700	6082620	Asylum does fucking transmorphers and shit with like, how can we get in one of these
6082620	6084860	movies, dammit?
6084860	6090580	Don't they have a need for witty radio trio to be eaten alive by snakes or something?
6090580	6096820	They make so many stupid movies, and the thing is they do it intentional now.
6096820	6100980	I mean, I don't know if they do it intentional as far as like, they buy the properties for
6100980	6104780	these, and then they put them on like sci-fi channel, or they purposely make them that
6104780	6106280	bad.
6106280	6111060	I don't know if, it's hard to tell like, are you doing this on purpose, or do you really
6111060	6112060	just suck that much?
6112060	6114060	You know, that's just, I don't know.
6114060	6117860	Alright, well before we get into the rapid fire news tonight, Dark Soccer, you mentioned
6117860	6119180	you wanted to plug something real quick.
6119180	6120740	Yes, I do.
6120740	6127500	One of our fantabulous listeners, Ikuma JP, made an app for the iPhone, and I want to
6127500	6128860	share it with everybody.
6128860	6131480	It's called My Secret Garden.
6131480	6137980	It's really beautiful, and it's free, so go get it.
6137980	6139180	Rob says he likes free.
6139180	6145980	I didn't give Rob enough time, so, but it's more than gorgeous moving pictures.
6145980	6146980	It's beautiful.
6146980	6150060	It has nothing to do with the My Secret Garden, like, book series.
6150060	6152820	No, that wasn't a series, it was one book by the same-
6152820	6156020	Well, there was too many fucking books, or, I'm sorry, there's too many fucking movies
6156020	6157620	based on that book.
6157620	6160800	There was the same lady that wrote A Little Princess.
6160800	6163100	The more you know- Hey, I've read them both, I love those books.
6163100	6166780	But the most beautiful part of that sentence was free, so there you go.
6166780	6167780	Alright.
6167780	6169740	I read that one of our listeners made it.
6169740	6171540	Of course, of course.
6171540	6175020	So we demand he gets a top 100 ranking immediately.
6175020	6179860	Alright, let's move on to some rapid-fire news, Loki.
6179860	6186020	Yes, let's talk a little bit about movies, I mean, we were just talking about movies,
6186020	6190740	but Ace Attorney, a movie I'm sure a lot of people might be interested in checking out,
6190740	6194220	is actually going to be localized for worldwide release.
6194220	6197820	I'm sure that's going to be a very limited release, but hey, you'll eventually get it
6197820	6200740	on DVD and Blu-Ray soon, you know, so.
6200740	6209420	As long as Samuel L. Jackson is in it saying, OBJECTION!
6209420	6210420	He should be the judge.
6210420	6214380	Get these motherfucking ejections out of my motherfucking courtroom.
6214380	6216980	Jackson is in the courtroom.
6216980	6218460	SUSTAIN MOTHERFUCKER!
6218460	6223300	You can put him really in anything, you know.
6223300	6225700	Samuel L. Jackson really could just be in anything.
6225700	6228940	Stance is sitting on the toilet the movie.
6228940	6233900	That'll be the movie we get offered to do.
6233900	6235580	Alright, sorry.
6235580	6242220	So and then they're doing a Humble Bundle for Android, which is kind of unique, mainly
6242220	6246780	it's been PC, but now you're going to be able to get a few games.
6246780	6255420	The new Humble Bundle for Android offers Android versions of Anomaly, Warzone, Earth, Osmose,
6255420	6262900	and Edge, with a bonus copy of World of Goo, if you exceed the average payment.
6262900	6263900	So that's kind of neat.
6263900	6268620	That's neat that it's coming to mobile phones, so it'll never happen on Apple, but hey, yay
6268620	6269620	for Android.
6269620	6275660	And I guess these games are cross-platform, so you get them on Android and Windows and
6275660	6279140	OS X and Linux.
6279140	6281780	So that's pretty nice, I guess.
6281780	6285860	The problem is, you know, really with a lot of these bundles, it's like if you bought
6285860	6290780	one of these bundles, you probably have most of the games already in there anyway, so it's
6290780	6296980	like how many fucking copies of VVVV do I need, or World of Goo, I mean it's just really.
6296980	6301940	Last but not least, Vita Games, they did mention a while back that Vita Games were going to
6301940	6308340	be cheaper if you did buy them online versus a boxed game, however you may consider still
6308340	6313260	wanting to buy a boxed game because you're only going to be saving 10%, and that's it.
6313260	6317980	They're 10% cheaper on the Playstation Network, they will be day and day, so if it's a game
6317980	6323060	that maybe you just don't want to go to the store to get it, then you can do it I guess,
6323060	6326260	but it's only 10%.
6326260	6330340	Like two bucks on some of these games.
6330340	6334780	That's really interesting, actually, that whole thing.
6334780	6339140	Because that's kind of how they're going to try and combat used games, is by making it
6339140	6344380	cheaper to buy a new one that you can never sell back.
6344380	6346740	It's not much cheaper, it's like a few bucks.
6346740	6352980	I mean seriously, you're going to make back the difference if you sell a new copy of a
6352980	6354740	game used.
6354740	6356740	For some people, that's going to make the difference.
6356740	6359260	You know it.
6359260	6361940	It's 10% folks, I mean come on.
6361940	6365980	Now if you want to play devil's advocate, you can say, no it's not really 10%, it's
6365980	6371740	going to be that plus tax, but I don't know if they charge tax on these purchases.
6371740	6373260	Might depend on the state still.
6373260	6381300	Yeah, so you could potentially save upwards to 20%, but once again, you know, you could
6381300	6384300	probably buy it used and it'll be cheaper.
6384300	6388500	I just don't know if there's a real need for you to jump in and get everything digital.
6388500	6392140	Yeah, that's the way you want to roll, then fine.
6392140	6397940	But 10% is, I was hoping it'd be a little bit more significant, like you know, $5 cheaper
6397940	6398940	or something like that.
6398940	6406100	Like if it's a $25 for a $30 game or something, that might be a little bit more swaying, but
6406100	6409100	10%, I don't think a lot of people are going to jump on board.
6409100	6414160	I'm sure some people will, because yeah, I'm saving some money, but.
6414160	6418740	And if you're not one to sell back games, then maybe.
6418740	6419740	Alright.
6419740	6425500	Well moving on, unfortunately misspellings on box art will not result in any type of
6425500	6426500	price reduction.
6426500	6428980	In fact, it might make the price of these go up, I don't know.
6428980	6432100	But we talked about this a little bit last week, and that's of course Resident Evil
6432100	6438260	Revelations, or whatever, because the name on the box is actually spelled wrong.
6438260	6441380	We already talked about this a little bit last week, but somebody had said, no Rob,
6441380	6442700	that's just the review copies.
6442700	6446220	And I was like, are you sure, because I thought that came from the first printing.
6446220	6450060	Well, sure enough, it has been spotted out in the wild.
6450060	6457380	Resident Evil Revelations is actually out there in the wild, misspelled.
6457380	6459740	So there you go.
6459740	6464620	It's missing the I and the T are backwards there, so that's what's wrong.
6464620	6469620	But anyway, yeah, so the box art made it out there, so you know, you might actually, if
6469620	6470620	you've already picked up a copy.
6470620	6475260	Does that stuff get proofed, I mean, yeah, no, we were talking about this last week.
6475260	6481900	But anyway, seeing where that is now, I think the designer had very little to do with that.
6481900	6487380	So anyhow, Capcom has stated that the initial shipment was sent to retailers in North America
6487380	6489140	with a spelling error.
6489140	6494420	It's being repackaged and will have the corrected spelling, so you can actually order a new
6494420	6495780	like slip cover for it.
6495780	6500500	This is the exact same thing they did when they put out what Okami with the IGN watermark
6500500	6501500	on it.
6501500	6502500	Hilarious!
6502500	6506400	I have like all of the new ones that I didn't even know in the game.
6506400	6511300	That's even better, is I have a poster that they've made up the box art that has just
6511300	6516180	like, it's like, how'd you miss that, I mean, really?
6516180	6517740	Somebody approved that.
6517740	6523980	All right, well, if Dance Dance Revolution with Just Yourself isn't enough, and DDR in
6523980	6528240	the arcades with two people isn't enough, well, I hope you're still in high school because
6528240	6536160	DDR Classroom Edition is going to be a PC game that allows 48 dance mats all to be linked
6536160	6538700	together so that you can all play DDR.
6538700	6539700	That's actually kind of cool.
6539700	6543500	I'm actually, you know, as a gamer nerd who, you know, has been one ever since like high
6543500	6546940	school where sometimes I was looked at as like the big ol' nerd for being into games,
6546940	6552200	this is pretty rad that DDR really has kind of gotten into a lot of different PE programs,
6552200	6557680	and so this is out there to try and basically get like an official Dance Dance Revolution
6557680	6563600	classroom game, I mean, DDR, Konami already supports DDR and PE programs, but this is
6563600	6567380	now just a whole like, 48 people can all play the same game.
6567380	6572760	I'm not sure how that works, like, I don't know if it's like, if the majority of people
6572760	6578780	get it right, then you get points or whatever, but I think it's just kind of a, you know,
6578780	6579780	but that would be-
6579780	6580780	Individual scoring, maybe?
6580780	6581780	Who knows, who knows?
6581780	6584840	Yeah, if you fail this, you will get an F in PE.
6584840	6587720	The time has come for you to dance for your life, no.
6587720	6588720	Alright.
6588720	6592400	Now's the time, let's focus on me dance!
6592400	6597480	Now I couldn't tell you exactly what songs are going to be in this new DDR game, but
6597480	6602200	I bet if it's for schools, it's probably not going to be any songs by one particular musician
6602200	6608240	who's been showing up in a lot of music games lately, and if recent rumors are to be believed,
6608240	6617320	Ubisoft, who has made Just Dance, the Black Eyed Peas experience, the ABBA You Can Dance,
6617320	6622280	the Michael Jackson experience, guess what's supposed to come out for the Wii and the Wii
6622280	6624280	U later this year?
6624280	6628800	The Lady Gaga experience!
6628800	6631240	You know you're gonna get it!
6631240	6633240	Praise Gaga!
6633240	6635560	Oh my god.
6635560	6642480	Step aside, bless her pop divas.
6642480	6649680	You too can experience Amazon discounting your album to 99 cents, your fifth single
6649680	6655200	not doing so well with a video that you directed, nobody understands, no I'm kidding, look,
6655200	6659480	Lady Gaga experience, there'll be plenty of people that'll pick that up, I may or may
6659480	6660720	not be one of them.
6660720	6661720	You will be one of them.
6661720	6663200	I will totally fucking buy this game.
6663200	6668040	I am not even gonna try and lie, as long as it has all the songs I really like, I'll get
6668040	6669040	it day one.
6669040	6673880	Lady Gaga the experience though sounds kind of scary, I gotta say that.
6673880	6677780	I don't want to experience what Lady Gaga goes through.
6677780	6682360	Lady Gaga the experience, all will be revealed.
6682360	6684640	You will experience.
6684640	6686640	Is she really a man?
6686640	6690100	No, that was proven when she showed her twat.
6690100	6691100	When did she show her twat?
6691100	6692100	Telephone.
6692100	6693880	I don't remember that.
6693880	6700120	And they, she hopped up on the bars and showed her twat to everybody and it was all squared
6700120	6701120	out.
6701120	6702120	Oh yeah.
6702120	6703120	Yeah.
6703120	6704120	I remember that.
6704120	6706680	Well, they just have the pixel on her penis.
6706680	6708060	She likes to make fun of it.
6708060	6712600	I mean, and you know, if she had a penis, that thing would be like platinum plated and
6712600	6713600	candy striped.
6713600	6717160	Don't give her ideas for a new video.
6717160	6720640	I've seen her live twice in concert and both times she's joked about the rumors that she
6720640	6721640	has a penis.
6721640	6722960	She thinks it's funny.
6722960	6725760	So she, she, she, she likes the mystery, I guess.
6725760	6729600	Anyway, can we please stop talking about Lady Gaga's penis and move on to more rapid fire
6729600	6730600	news?
6730600	6731600	Tark Sakura.
6731600	6732600	I guess.
6732600	6737400	Well, how about Dance Central 2?
6737400	6742240	Download content is going to have some fun stuff in it if you like the game.
6742240	6746200	There is a say, Hey, I love you.
6746200	6753900	And this, Oh, by the way, this is, um, on, uh, February 14th and Milkshake cause that
6753900	6758480	song is still, you know, relative.
6758480	6761920	It still brings all the boys to the yard all these years later.
6761920	6766960	And LMFAO featuring Lauren Bennett and Goon Rock's Party Rock Anthem.
6766960	6769440	That might be kind of cool.
6769440	6775040	Also on January 31st is Forget You or as the version I like, Fuck You.
6775040	6779160	I just realized, do you even know what song Party Rock Anthem is?
6779160	6780160	No.
6780160	6782080	It's just interesting.
6782080	6788880	I only know because I have to drive my wife's car and she doesn't have an MP3 player and
6788880	6793500	we listen to, well, let me put this, but you can listen to any station and it's pretty
6793500	6797480	much like that's one of the 10 songs that they have in rotation.
6797480	6798480	Yeah.
6798480	6801520	My favorite was when Alan and I were in the car the other day and we were listening to
6801520	6804640	one station and Adele came on and we flipped to another station.
6804640	6806880	They were in the middle of another Adele song.
6806880	6807880	Go to a third station.
6807880	6810600	They're in the middle of the song, the Adele song that the first station started playing.
6810600	6814480	I'm like, this bitch is everywhere.
6814480	6817080	God, I cannot.
6817080	6822640	Um, also if you bought your copy of Dance Central 2 from Best Buy, you will get a code
6822640	6825400	to get Party Rock Anthem early.
6825400	6827880	Just saying whatever the hell song that is.
6827880	6830660	That's some delayed DLC bonus right there.
6830660	6835960	How about Just Dance 3 DLC because you know that game's relevant too.
6835960	6838440	It is technically the number one selling game right now.
6838440	6845960	You can get The Power by Snap because people still like that song and you can actually
6845960	6854320	get a Bollywood, um, kati kalandal, I guess, love letters Y O Y and sweet invaders skin
6854320	6855320	to skin.
6855320	6860920	So you can get all those 240 Microsoft points a piece.
6860920	6866080	And then last but not least, which I kind of think I need to get this, there's going
6866080	6871260	to be the Pink Pearl 3DS available on February 10th and I want it the same way I wanted my
6871260	6875080	pink GBA in a totally ironic way.
6875080	6877760	I was hipster before everybody else was.
6877760	6882800	No, seriously, I wanted the pink one because I thought it was hideous and I liked it and
6882800	6886480	I think I would want this one too because it's equally hideous and I really want it.
6886480	6888760	Okay, so tell me if you've ever heard this song before.
6888760	6889760	Dark soccer.
6889760	6890760	You ready?
6890760	6900160	Oh, this shit.
6900160	6902040	I'm like, she's not the girl in the bubble.
6902040	6904340	She has to have heard it at some point.
6904340	6906600	It's like pretty much avoidable.
6906600	6911960	You can't, you know, you can't avoid that song to the radio in my car, but you go to
6911960	6912960	Pinkberry.
6912960	6916560	Yeah, that's probably, I think where I heard it.
6916560	6922360	You know what song though I think of all these radio dancing songs where you're all glad
6922360	6926560	it's not a video show right now because I shake my ass for dark soccer and I just looked
6926560	6927960	the other way.
6927960	6931880	You know what song I actually like and they were playing it like, where was it that they
6931880	6932880	were playing?
6932880	6936660	I think they were playing it at big lots or some shit, but they played that I'm sexy and
6936660	6941400	I know it song, whatever song that was, I think it's really funny and I want that song.
6941400	6942960	I don't know who does it, but I'm winning.
6942960	6943960	That's LMFAO.
6943960	6944960	It's the same band.
6944960	6945960	It is.
6945960	6946960	Yeah.
6946960	6947960	Okay.
6947960	6948960	Yeah.
6948960	6951000	I think also did that song that, you know, sign waves that, you know, when a cage, that's
6951000	6957920	who opened for Kesha when my friend went and she said she was going just to see them and
6957920	6958920	not Kesha.
6958920	6960880	I'm surprised she didn't catch the herbs.
6960880	6965000	The next day when she came into class, she was still had glitter in her hair.
6965000	6966520	It was so funny.
6966520	6967520	I think Kesha's hilarious.
6967520	6970680	Um, so yeah, I used to really hate Kesha.
6970680	6974500	But she's really grown on me and a lot of that is probably the influence of some of
6974500	6979320	my friends, but like now it's kind of like that whole, like, it's like a guilty pleasure
6979320	6980320	type of thing.
6980320	6983060	Like, you know, some days you just feel a little bit trashy.
6983060	6985480	Some days you want a trashy girl.
6985480	6986480	She's a hot mess.
6986480	6987480	She is.
6987480	6988480	But there was more.
6988480	6989480	Oh, more.
6989480	6999640	I was going to say, um, it comes on February 10th for $169.99 and um, this isn't a bundle.
6999640	7001920	Also I'm in the UK.
7001920	7006240	They will get the same thing on February 10th and the ice white model, which we're not getting
7006240	7007880	yet.
7007880	7010880	Just saying.
7010880	7016080	Can you imagine if Ubisoft put out Kesha, the experience, I'm sexy and I know it would
7016080	7018620	just come with a gallon of body glitter.
7018620	7023920	I know, God, that would just be, that would make my soul hurt.
7023920	7028160	I would play it a jar full of gonorrhea and a used tampon.
7028160	7031800	I would play it, but I would turn back in the gonorrhea.
7031800	7033440	You can keep this part.
7033440	7035800	I like my Kesha, bathe that Kesha.
7035800	7036800	All right.
7036800	7041760	Anyhow, moving on, let's get into some other news stories and of course the mailbag is
7041760	7042760	coming up soon too.
7042760	7048320	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and the FUs of the week, Twitter topics, Skypline, all
7048320	7049320	that fun stuff.
7049320	7051920	But first, some more stories, Loki.
7051920	7056360	So yeah, you know the new Xbox and everyone's like, oh yeah, it's going to be announced
7056360	7057360	this year.
7057360	7060360	Microsoft said, nope.
7060360	7064600	Apparently the Xbox 360 cycle is not at all finished.
7064600	7071600	The proof is that we don't see the logic in cutting the prices here.
7071600	7075360	And you know, E3 is still premature.
7075360	7079440	What's certain is that there'll be nothing new in 2012.
7079440	7083920	So and of course, you know, they put out another statement saying, no, we're always thinking
7083920	7087960	about the next and you know, what is next and how we can push the boundaries and blah,
7087960	7088960	blah, blah, blah.
7088960	7094520	So yeah, you know, there will be another Xbox, most likely 2014 or holiday 2013.
7094520	7096400	We're waiting to see what Nintendo does.
7096400	7099000	I should have just been there lying because everybody would believe that.
7099000	7102000	I honestly think...
7102000	7104000	I was going to tell them that for your ringtone.
7104000	7111360	Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, yeah.
7111360	7112360	I did it.
7112360	7113360	Turned it back on.
7113360	7121120	Anyways, you know, it's basically, I mean, their new system is going to be graphically,
7121120	7124920	the Wii U is going to be graphically capable of what the 360 is right now.
7124920	7127920	So I don't really think that they have too much to worry about right now, especially
7127920	7134920	if that whole tablet thing doesn't end up working out to be like this innovative masterpiece.
7134920	7135920	I don't know.
7135920	7136920	I think that they're fine right now.
7136920	7141560	They can, they can wait next year for the component prices to come way down and still
7141560	7147960	beef up their, you know, what's inside their box and, you know, put out some great games.
7147960	7148960	What's in their box?
7148960	7149960	Yes.
7149960	7150960	It's Kesha.
7150960	7153320	Um, here's the thing though.
7153320	7155600	What does Microsoft show at E3 this year then?
7155600	7157720	Is it just going to be a repeat of last year's E3?
7157720	7158960	Halo 4.
7158960	7160280	Which they showed at last E3.
7160280	7162000	They showed a teaser.
7162000	7163000	And then what?
7163000	7165960	The Tomb Raider game probably won't be out till this holiday, right?
7165960	7166960	That was a game.
7166960	7169280	Tomb Raider's not coming out until holiday.
7169280	7172160	There's Bioshock Infinite still holiday this year.
7172160	7178720	Maybe Grand Theft Auto 5 holiday, another Call of Duty game.
7178720	7180760	There's going to be a bunch of new IPs.
7180760	7185680	How much of Microsoft's keynote is just going to be rehash of last year's stuff?
7185680	7187700	I think they may still have a lot of stuff.
7187700	7189520	We haven't heard a whole lot.
7189520	7191440	Maybe they're keeping a lot of it under wraps.
7191440	7195600	And I don't think they need to come out with a brand new system yet.
7195600	7202760	I don't think they do either, but I'm still waiting for, like, that Killer Connect hardcore
7202760	7203760	game.
7203760	7209920	Like, what, didn't we get a glimpse at one that was supposed to be some, like, uh, Greek
7209920	7210920	fighting thing?
7210920	7211920	Yes.
7211920	7213920	There's still the one, that's the one from Crytek.
7213920	7217720	Which, you know, that could be a big hit or a big miss.
7217720	7220160	It's hard to say.
7220160	7223960	There's really, that could be a hot mess when that comes out.
7223960	7225880	So we'll see.
7225880	7227760	Yeah, there's that one.
7227760	7231000	I don't remember what it's called, but yeah, it's from Crytek.
7231000	7236460	I don't know, there's a lot of games coming out this year.
7236460	7240240	And there's a lot of new IPs, I can't remember all of them.
7240240	7242280	But I'm sure there's going to be some stuff that they'll be able to show.
7242280	7247120	And obviously, you know, there's a new...
7247120	7251360	They're going to show the new Fable game, which I don't give a shit about at all.
7251360	7257600	If I'm done with that series, and done with Peter Molyneux, like, I think I need to pay
7257600	7258960	more attention to what he said.
7258960	7261840	Oh yeah, there was that whole Fable connect, like, it's not on Rails.
7261840	7262840	It's not on Rails!
7262840	7263840	It's on Rails.
7263840	7264840	Read it on the board, it's not on Rails.
7264840	7269240	Listen, listen, listen you fucker, I'm not fucking listening to what fucking Peter Molyneux
7269240	7270240	says.
7270240	7272400	It's not on Rails, it's fucking on Rails, okay?
7272400	7276560	It will be on goddamn Rails.
7276560	7280240	Because anything he promises you is going to be underwhelming, okay?
7280240	7283280	It's just the way it is.
7283280	7285680	He's a snake oil salesman.
7285680	7287040	That's what he is, okay?
7287040	7289340	He's a fucking snake oil salesman.
7289340	7293520	He will promise you the world, and it will be fucking Fable all over again.
7293520	7294520	And you know what?
7294520	7297640	Whether you're a fan of Fable that much, that might be a good thing.
7297640	7300280	I mean, maybe you're just looking for Fable.
7300280	7304840	But it's not going to be this thing that's going to revolutionize Fable.
7304840	7306960	Nothing will revolutionize Fable.
7306960	7311000	But maybe Kingdom of Amalur, or whatever that game is called.
7311000	7312880	Which is basically EA's Fable game.
7312880	7315520	Yeah, it's Fable with God of War fighting.
7315520	7318280	I mean, which, that's not a bad combo.
7318280	7319280	That doesn't sound bad.
7319280	7320280	It's not a bad combo.
7320280	7321680	I mean, it sounds better than the demo.
7321680	7325520	Alright, anyhow, big changes going on at Xbox.
7325520	7330720	This is actually a pretty big change, and I always say this guy's name wrong, so, Steven
7330720	7331720	Toulouse?
7331720	7333280	That sounds right.
7333280	7335960	Is one of the big guys at Xbox.
7335960	7339400	He is the director of Xbox Live policy and enforcement.
7339400	7341880	He's been working at Microsoft for quite a long time.
7341880	7345040	I think about 17 years he's been working there.
7345040	7348120	He is no longer going to be working there in a couple weeks.
7348120	7353420	He has resigned, effective on February 16th, for no particular reason.
7353420	7354420	It's very interesting.
7354420	7358680	He's just said, on the 16th, I'm going to head down to Dallas to visit my family.
7358680	7360400	I have no other plans beyond that.
7360400	7362140	I'm a free agent.
7362140	7363140	So he's not really saying...
7363140	7365840	Is he a free bitch baby?
7365840	7369460	He's not really saying he's jumped ship to go somewhere else, like some mega company
7369460	7372880	or something like that, or what have you.
7372880	7378080	Microsoft did come out and basically say that, yes, he's leaving the company.
7378080	7379240	Thank you for his service.
7379240	7380320	Wish all the best.
7380320	7383500	We don't have any details to share about a potential successor.
7383500	7387380	We can assure you that the Xbox Live enforcement squad will continue their work to help ensure
7387380	7389880	a safer, more secure experience, da da da da da.
7389880	7394980	Now, of course, the conclusion that many people have jumped to regarding this little resignation
7394980	7398320	is that, oh, it's because of the hacks.
7398320	7402120	Something's happening with the hacks and he's stepping out because he knows something ugly
7402120	7405800	is going to go down and he doesn't want to go down with it, da da da da da, like all the
7405800	7408100	tinfoil hat people come out.
7408100	7412240	And to some extent, I've been one of the harshest critics of Xbox around here and the way they've
7412240	7414040	handled that whole mess.
7414040	7416600	You mean they handled it?
7416600	7418600	Well, yeah, exactly.
7418600	7423280	Rhythm party is like the first time I've turned on my Xbox in a month.
7423280	7427960	So, you know, I'm just but I don't think at the end of the day, it really has anything
7427960	7435080	to do with that because his role was more about keeping the Xbox Live environment a
7435080	7438480	safe haven, if you are a family friendly environment.
7438480	7439480	You know what I mean?
7439480	7445600	It's just basically a safe place, I don't know, whatever you want to call it.
7445600	7449120	It's just very possible that after it's like the Thor of the ban hammer.
7449120	7450680	Well, let's be real.
7450680	7451680	I don't know this guy.
7451680	7452680	I don't know him personally.
7452680	7453680	I don't know.
7453680	7454680	I read his blogs.
7454680	7455680	I don't follow him on Twitter, da da da.
7455680	7459880	I've heard he's very accessible, but I have not chosen to access him.
7459880	7466520	From what I hear is the thing, though, if you've been working at the same job 17 years,
7466520	7469560	and so he's got to be what, like almost 40.
7469560	7474200	He's probably going through what some might call a midlife crisis.
7474200	7478960	And I'm not saying I'm not saying it's necessarily a bad thing to buy a Ferrari and drive.
7478960	7480680	I'm not saying it's necessarily a bad thing.
7480680	7484800	It's probably just that moment a lot of people go through where it's like, is this what I
7484800	7486200	want to do forever?
7486200	7490000	And maybe he decided I want to spend more time with family or I want to do something
7490000	7491000	else.
7491000	7495560	And, you know, he, as a director, he's probably built up a little bit of a nest egg and he's
7495560	7497480	probably okay to do that.
7497480	7500760	So what I'm trying to say is that I really don't think this has anything to do with the
7500760	7505080	Xbox hacks and just this guy wants to go have a life.
7505080	7506280	Hooray!
7506280	7509040	Good for him.
7509040	7511360	It's great.
7511360	7516200	So meanwhile, Xbox really does need to do something about the hacking, but I don't think
7516200	7519560	this guy has anything to do with that.
7519560	7520880	Let's move on, shall we?
7520880	7521880	Why, yes.
7521880	7524440	Oh, some comments from our chat room real quick on this.
7524440	7527280	Tiger Claw says he was a co-host for Major Nelson's podcast.
7527280	7532040	I think I've listened to one episode of Major Nelson's podcast and it was many, many years
7532040	7533040	ago.
7533040	7535440	So sadly, I wouldn't know that.
7535440	7536680	But that's interesting to know.
7536680	7539760	So I guess a lot of the community knows him through that, too.
7539760	7544160	Break Man says he's leaving Xbox Live because he's tired of Xbox Live kids calling him the
7544160	7548080	N-word or questioning his sexuality in vulgar ways on a regular basis.
7548080	7551440	Kind of like how everybody gets treated on Xbox Live.
7551440	7556480	Well, you know, if that hasn't been fixed in the past, how long has Xbox Live been around
7556480	7557480	now?
7557480	7558480	About nine years?
7558480	7559960	I don't think it's going to get fixed anytime soon.
7559960	7560960	That's it.
7560960	7562280	All right.
7562280	7563880	Not that it makes it right.
7563880	7565440	Just saying.
7565440	7573840	Maybe the Xbox lube or whatever the next Xbox ends up being called will have extreme anti-homophobe,
7573840	7576040	anti-racist measures in it.
7576040	7577920	But I wouldn't hold my breath.
7577920	7579920	Let's get to some emails.
7579920	7580920	Yay.
7580920	7584880	Every week you guys email us at mailbagatorangelaunchrader.com.
7584880	7587240	We read some of our favorite emails on the air.
7587240	7590280	And we stop the music now.
7590280	7594360	I got one that says don't judge my grammar, but grammar was misspelled.
7594360	7598840	I'm not going to say who it was though, because I'm not going to bring attention to that person.
7598840	7604800	So I'm grabbing a random email and here's one that actually has fantastic grammar.
7604800	7610960	I found this great website where you can play Ness Ness, okay, Genesis is misspelled, etc.
7610960	7612000	Games on your computer.
7612000	7615040	I'm writing this because I know Dark Sakura is into old games.
7615040	7616040	Keep up the good work.
7616040	7621120	And here's another 10 great years of Orange Lounge Radio and that's sincerely CD Thunder.
7621120	7625920	I just want to point out in 10 more years, we'll be as old or if not older than this
7625920	7630480	guy who just resigned from Microsoft and we'll probably have a midlife crisis.
7630480	7633240	I would like to point out that he didn't send the link.
7633240	7634240	Really?
7634240	7636600	He told you, hey, check out this great website.
7636600	7640200	It's called Sincerely Me.
7640200	7642320	Okay.
7642320	7643320	Next email.
7643320	7649320	This comes from, oh, nevermind.
7649320	7652560	This was actually personally for us, so I'm saving it.
7652560	7654280	Now I really want to see it.
7654280	7655280	It's about mics.
7655280	7656280	Oh yeah.
7656280	7657280	Oh yeah.
7657280	7658280	I remember that.
7658280	7659280	Yeah.
7659280	7660280	Yeah.
7660280	7661280	This is what you get for not checking the email box.
7661280	7662280	So I forgot one week.
7662280	7663280	Good Lord.
7663280	7664280	One week my butt.
7664280	7665280	Okay.
7665280	7666280	Squawk!
7666280	7667280	Greetings, OLR.
7667280	7668280	This is your friendly neighborhood turtle.
7668280	7672400	Sky, I know you're probably under an NDA with Diablo three beta.
7672400	7675960	Without breaking that, can you please speak a little about your thoughts on the game and
7675960	7679080	some of the recent changes that they've made in the beta?
7679080	7680080	I'm under an NDA.
7680080	7681080	I don't know.
7681080	7684880	Am I going to love this as much as D2, or is there too much hype at this point?
7684880	7687200	I don't think I'm under an NDA.
7687200	7688520	If I am, oops.
7688520	7690040	There's so much information out there.
7690040	7692320	No, there's like stuff on YouTube, people playing through it.
7692320	7693880	It can't be under NDA.
7693880	7697480	I'm not going to say anything that, I'll tell you what, the last time I played through it
7697480	7699240	was in November.
7699240	7703340	I probably gave it a more extensive review on one of the shows back then.
7703340	7704340	But I enjoyed it.
7704340	7706800	You know, I enjoyed the older Diablo games.
7706800	7710200	Some people call it, oh, it's just a click fest, click, click, click.
7710200	7711640	But no, I thought it was fun.
7711640	7717600	I had a lot of fun, like Shane, who has sometimes been known as Mikolatov on the show, and he
7717600	7718600	was in the beta too.
7718600	7721760	And we did some co-op online and we had a lot of fun just kind of playing it together
7721760	7723840	and exploring the dungeons.
7723840	7726980	It's very similar to what you remember in Diablo two.
7726980	7729040	There's a few quality of life improvements.
7729040	7732440	Like I seem to remember, oh God, it's been a few months since I played it now, but I
7732440	7737020	seem to remember that, like, you don't have to carry around a bunch of town portal scrolls
7737020	7740480	because like there's an item in your inventory that lets you just make one, you know, just
7740480	7744280	kind of like little things like that that help it, you know, feel.
7744280	7746320	You said quality of life improvements.
7746320	7748000	Does it make you sexy and you know it?
7748000	7749940	Yes, it does actually.
7749940	7751360	And some of the classes were really fun to play.
7751360	7754960	I really enjoyed Monk, but there was another one I played I didn't like as much.
7754960	7756320	I think it was the Witch Doctor.
7756320	7757320	That was the Chipmunk.
7757320	7758320	No, the Witch Doctor.
7758320	7760160	I didn't like as much, but I liked the Monk.
7760160	7761160	Okay.
7761160	7764320	If you're able to continue with the email, any tidbit of info would be appreciated.
7764320	7765320	Thanks.
7765320	7767480	Your loyal turtle and fairly serious turtle.
7767480	7768480	P.S.
7768480	7771200	I heard that Loki secretly works for Nintendo.
7771200	7772200	Boom.
7772200	7774480	I secretly work for Nintendo.
7774480	7775480	Boom.
7775480	7776480	Boom.
7776480	7777480	Boom.
7777480	7778480	Blocks.
7778480	7779480	I wish.
7779480	7782880	I honestly wish I did because, you know, I'd be getting a lot more money.
7782880	7787000	If you saw Reggie knew how to kick ass and take names, Loki would be in there just, he
7787000	7789840	would just, he'd flip a table the first day.
7789840	7790840	Okay.
7790840	7791840	I wish.
7791840	7793560	Loki, would you flip a table if you worked for Nintendo?
7793560	7794560	Fuck that.
7794560	7795560	I'd want to stay employed.
7795560	7796560	Okay.
7796560	7797560	So, email.
7797560	7798560	Last email.
7798560	7799560	Yes.
7799560	7800560	Dear OLR.
7800560	7801560	Okay.
7801560	7804680	Recently I purchased a copy of the Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Game of the Year edition.
7804680	7807800	Now I'm enjoying it for the most part with the exception of one thing.
7807800	7813280	The Game of the Year edition has a glitch in which when you're a vampire and you seek,
7813280	7816840	and you receive a quest to cure yourself.
7816840	7818720	Now granted, I like being a vampire.
7818720	7822120	I was strong, fast, didn't sparkle, but it made my character weak to fire and sunlight
7822120	7823720	turns me into a crispy critter.
7823720	7825840	I'm glad I'm not the only one that uses that term.
7825840	7826840	Now-
7826840	7827840	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
7827840	7832080	You mean an Elder Scrolls game is glitchy?
7832080	7835440	Now on that quest you talk to a witch and after running errands for her, she sends you
7835440	7839200	out for ingredients for the potion to cure yourself permanently, but one of the ingredients
7839200	7842360	will not be accepted now they patched this out of the original game.
7842360	7847600	But when they booted out the Knights of the Nine DLC, the glitch re-arose and there's
7847600	7849880	no way around that with Game of the Year.
7849880	7853920	Now on another note, I've been playing a Japanese PSP demo for Final Fantasy Type O.
7853920	7855320	I wanna play that!
7855320	7859440	I'm wondering if this will ever come into America and how it ties in with the, uh, Fabula
7859440	7861200	Nova Crystallis.
7861200	7863840	Thank you for reading my email signed Haseo Sumiragawa.
7863840	7867120	I don't believe it is part of the Fabu-
7867120	7868920	It was supposed to be Akido.
7868920	7872600	It was originally gonna be the mobile phone one, right, but they just totally changed
7872600	7873600	it.
7873600	7874600	Now it's the PSP one.
7874600	7875600	This is supposed to be the Akido 13.
7875600	7876600	Yeah.
7876600	7878240	I, I wanna play it.
7878240	7879720	I really wanna play it.
7879720	7884120	It's probably gonna, like, kinda feel like the same universe as 13, but it won't be like
7884120	7885120	any of the same characters.
7885120	7889600	It'll be like Versus, cause Final Fantasy Versus 13 doesn't look like it has shit in
7889600	7895120	common with Final Fantasy 13, except I'm assuming it takes place on Cocoon.
7895120	7896120	No characters?
7896120	7897120	No.
7897120	7898120	It's all different people?
7898120	7899120	No.
7899120	7900120	I don't even think it takes place on Cocoon.
7900120	7901120	Yeah, so I don't know what the hell-
7901120	7902640	I wanna play it when you're done.
7902640	7903640	What?
7903640	7904640	I don't have Versus.
7904640	7905640	I have 13 too.
7905640	7909080	Oh, yeah, you can- if I get it back in less than a year this time-
7909080	7915280	Honestly, 13 Versus, it has, like, nothing to do with anything.
7915280	7917600	13 Versus looks good, though.
7917600	7918600	Yeah.
7918600	7919600	It looks really good, I gotta say.
7919600	7920600	Hey!
7920600	7923160	We got an email from PlayStation Network.
7923160	7924400	It's probably a hack email, or official email.
7924400	7927640	It's not a hack email, it's that they're changing the PlayStation Network-
7927640	7933120	Info at PlayStation.messages4.com, yeah, that's, that's a-
7933120	7935120	I did get one for the PlayStation Network, it's basically-
7935120	7940520	Yeah, they're merging PlayStation Network into the Sony Entertainment Network, or whatever.
7940520	7943240	The Sony Entertainment Network of You Can't Sue Us.
7943240	7944240	Yeah.
7944240	7945240	Watch us.
7945240	7950600	I mean, hey, if they give us no reason for legal action, we're not gonna say anything.
7950600	7955400	For the record, I have not updated my system, so therefore I have not accepted the end user
7955400	7956720	license agreement yet.
7956720	7957720	Ho ho ho.
7957720	7961240	I will still sue you if I feel like it.
7961240	7962240	If you feel like it.
7962240	7966440	This is my Southern lawyer, he was suing me.
7966440	7967440	What?
7967440	7969800	Okay, can we...visit?
7969800	7970960	That's it?
7970960	7971960	You're done?
7971960	7972960	No more emails.
7972960	7973960	I'm done, where's the fork?
7973960	7976400	All right, let's go to the FUs of the week.
7976400	7978840	Every week on this show we like to get angsty.
7978840	7979840	Why?
7979840	7998520	Because we can.
7998520	8007680	F-U to, um- God, you know, I had it in my head and I forgot what it was, it was somebody-
8007680	8014040	Oh yeah, the girl outside of Whole Foods today who was trying to get me to sign her petition.
8014040	8018120	I normally don't have a problem with that, I'm all for political action, but I don't
8018120	8022680	sign those petitions from people that are just standing outside the door because there's
8022680	8027200	been a lot of issue lately with people trying to get your information and using it against
8027200	8028200	you.
8028200	8031880	And I don't really have- I thought she was legit, I mean, I'm not gonna make a judgment
8031880	8032880	on her.
8032880	8036920	But, um, she's like, do you have- hey, how you doing, do you have time for this?
8036920	8041000	Like, I'm sorry, I'm really big in a hurry, she's like, oh, well, are you late for the
8041000	8042000	game?
8042000	8045880	Like, don't start a conversation with me when I tell you I am in a hurry.
8045880	8048560	I hate football.
8048560	8051920	Don't stop me with foot- I mean, she didn't know that, but I was like, I was like, if
8051920	8057400	I say I'm in a hurry, the correct response will be, oh, I'm sorry, bye, bye.
8057400	8059720	Not trying to start a conversation with me.
8059720	8061440	I'm still not gonna sign your shit.
8061440	8064000	Look at our website when you have a chance.
8064000	8069800	Yeah, I would sign it through the website- if I had credentials, you know, but that and
8069800	8074840	how much my feet hurt yesterday, oh my god, okay, but I had a really good time at museums
8074840	8075840	with Becky.
8075840	8076840	Lots of fun.
8076840	8077840	Were they really crowded?
8077840	8082440	I haven't heard a lot of people- We went to the Children's Discovery Museum
8082440	8084720	with Julian in the morning and it was- We thought about going to that, we're really
8084720	8085720	sure.
8085720	8087600	Don't do it on the freebie day.
8087600	8088600	Just get a membership.
8088600	8089600	It's so much easier.
8089600	8095160	But, I mean, he had a good time, but it was really crowded and then, but when we went
8095160	8102400	to the Crocker, we got there right around like, I want to say one something and it was
8102400	8107960	busy, yeah, but it wasn't prohibitively busy, if you know what I mean.
8107960	8112840	We actually still got up close to several of the paintings that they had on display.
8112840	8119560	There was a display of Italian Baroque art, it was really nice, but yeah, but my feet
8119560	8126680	hurt after, you know, walking from J Street to the Crocker, walking around the Crocker
8126680	8131000	and walking back and then I had to pee, so, alright, that was it.
8131000	8136960	And you know what they say, and I'm sure they've stolen this from somebody, if it ain't Baroque,
8136960	8137960	then don't fix it.
8137960	8138960	I've heard that before.
8138960	8139960	I don't remember that story.
8139960	8142160	If it ain't Baroque, it's probably Renaissance.
8142160	8144160	It was from Beauty and the Beast.
8144160	8145800	Yeah, it was Lumiere.
8145800	8148680	Lumiere says, no, Cogsworth says it.
8148680	8152360	Cogsworth said it, and Becky even quoted that when we were at the thing with the Baroque
8152360	8153360	art.
8153360	8154360	You just quoted Beauty and the Beast, Loki.
8154360	8155360	Yeah, whatever.
8155360	8159160	It's not Baroque, don't fix it.
8159160	8165920	Let's be real though, if this program were made up of dancing, you know, housewares,
8165920	8170240	Loki would be in the scene as well.
8170240	8177400	I don't want to be Mrs. Potts, or the cupboard, the wardrobe.
8177400	8178400	Clearly I'm Lumiere.
8178400	8179400	Alright, moving on.
8179400	8181400	Because you're so French, Rob.
8181400	8184080	I'm on fire.
8184080	8188500	This is, I don't even know if this is really an F.U., but I guess it is.
8188500	8193520	I'm just very sick and tired of the whole argument that used games steal away from developers.
8193520	8198440	Okay, let me fucking, I mean, come on, developers, you should know how this fucking works.
8198440	8199560	You make a game.
8199560	8201440	The game gets pressed.
8201440	8205920	The publisher sells the game to the retailer.
8205920	8208240	Therefore there is money being exchanged there.
8208240	8212540	It is up to the retailer to then sell the game so that they're not out the money that
8212540	8216840	they paid for the game, and they make a small profit on top of that.
8216840	8223800	Then maybe, as an incentive, you may get, you know, some extra money depending on how
8223800	8225900	well the game sells.
8225900	8231680	That is the only money that is getting eaten up by used game sales, and it's a very small
8231680	8237100	fraction of that that you're even, you know, losing out on.
8237100	8241080	And the great part is the person that was bitching about this in particular happened
8241080	8243520	to be Ian Milham.
8243520	8248320	Ian Milham is the creative director at Electronic Arts, art director on Dead Space.
8248320	8253240	Yes, you of all people should really bitch about how your game is just tanked because
8253240	8254400	of used game sales.
8254400	8257440	Oh wait, how many millions of copies did it sell?
8257440	8262080	Yeah, so you can shut the fuck up because you still made your fucking money and used
8262080	8265360	games didn't do shit for you guys.
8265360	8269280	I'm sorry, it's just a stupid argument, and I always tell people, we're the stupid money
8269280	8272640	from the developers if we buy used games.
8272640	8273640	No!
8273640	8277240	It does not fucking steal any money from anybody because those games are already goddamn paid
8277240	8278240	for.
8278240	8282560	If they all sat on shelves, they don't fucking care, they have their money already.
8282560	8285280	That's the whole point.
8285280	8286280	That's it.
8286280	8289960	Alright, well shit, how am I supposed to follow that?
8289960	8290960	Um, F-U-
8290960	8291960	It's pudding.
8291960	8292960	I want pudding.
8292960	8296560	Um, F-U to a lot of the same stuff that was bothering me last week, but I want to say
8296560	8299720	thank you to the person who reached out to me on Twitter to talk about that.
8299720	8302920	I thought that was very nice, you know who you are.
8302920	8307640	And I want to say F-U to the fact that, oh my god, I went to California Pizza Kitchen
8307640	8311440	last night, and granted there was a rather large party of us, but it took an hour and
8311440	8315380	fifteen minutes to get a table when we were quoted thirty, and then even then they sat
8315380	8317400	us at two separate tables.
8317400	8320880	And we watched another party right after us get sat at the big long table where there
8320880	8323000	was usually like twelve to thirteen of them.
8323000	8326040	And so I was discriminated against, I'm convinced that's what it was.
8326040	8328280	You should have called the manager.
8328280	8329280	Uh, my friend did.
8329280	8331520	You should have just gone to California Pizza Kitchen, I mean.
8331520	8336920	I know, but here's the weird thing, F-U to myself, because we went to California Pizza
8336920	8339840	Kitchen, and I ordered a salad.
8339840	8341160	Actually Becky orders a salad.
8341160	8344240	That's why they discriminated against you right there.
8344240	8345480	These salads are really good.
8345480	8349880	Yeah, they have a whole page dedicated to salads, and they have really good salads.
8349880	8352980	Like you wouldn't know it, but- Yeah I would know it.
8352980	8355640	It's not California Salad Kitchen, but it could be.
8355640	8357320	You know what's funny?
8357320	8358320	What?
8358320	8361480	Julian calls his bedroom his pizza kitchen.
8361480	8367440	Listen, we know your type of fresh choice is down the street, get the fuck out of here.
8367440	8368440	That's where I had lunch yesterday.
8368440	8372300	You fags are gonna come in here and order salad?
8372300	8373300	That's exactly what happened.
8373300	8374480	You know what that makes me think of?
8374480	8375480	What?
8375480	8381080	I ordered a brack, and she ordered something called a salad.
8381080	8382640	That to me is love.
8382640	8389800	The salt on the wound was watching all these high school kids coming in there all dressed
8389800	8391800	up like it's fucking prom or something.
8391800	8394120	Is it prom season?
8394120	8395120	Maybe hell.
8395120	8396120	Winter ball.
8396120	8397120	Wait, no.
8397120	8398600	Have things been cut back so much that they're gonna graduate next month?
8398600	8401120	Winter ball, I guess, because- We never had that shit.
8401120	8404560	I don't know, but there was a hell of people all dressed up, and all these kids, and their
8404560	8409280	fancy pants dresses, because California Pizza Kitchen's the nice part of town where all
8409280	8411280	the rich, spoiled kids live.
8411280	8412280	What, Arden?
8412280	8413280	No.
8413280	8414280	You went to the other one?
8414280	8418200	We went to the one where Dave and Buster's is, the Fountains.
8418200	8419200	See what I mean?
8419200	8420200	Go to Arden.
8420200	8422560	That's why- Don't give a shit at Arden.
8422560	8427600	Go hang out with the poor people like me at Arden.
8427600	8428600	Arden don't give a shit.
8428600	8429600	You know what?
8429600	8434360	If I'm gonna go over there, I'm just gonna go to Mikuni anyway, or Dave and Buster's.
8434360	8435360	Like the one or two.
8435360	8436360	We had a party in nine, though.
8436360	8438680	It's hard to find something everybody likes.
8438680	8439680	Yeah.
8439680	8441120	All right, so we went to California Salad Kitchen.
8441120	8443800	We went to Dave and Buster's.
8443800	8444800	You know what?
8444800	8446800	I suggested Dave and Buster's, but I got shot down.
8446800	8449000	They didn't want to do that.
8449000	8450000	Let's be real, though.
8450000	8452520	The food at Dave and Buster's is kind of mediocre.
8452520	8455720	And the night before Super Bowl Sunday, we were kind of afraid it was gonna be a mess.
8455720	8459160	Of course, we didn't fare much better at California Pizza Kitchen.
8459160	8463140	But anyway, could we please not turn this into a California Pizza Kitchen show and talk
8463140	8465760	about more news, Loki?
8465760	8474160	So you know, not to be out done, I guess, in Monkey See Monkey Do or whatever.
8474160	8480760	You know, Sony's pulling another move with the Wii U type controllers.
8480760	8488120	Sony has patented their own Wii U-esque device, and it looks like a tablet.
8488120	8490540	What more is there to say?
8490540	8491540	Tablet with buttons on it.
8491540	8496960	Actually, it looks like kind of a cross between a Game Boy and an iPod, and that looks really
8496960	8497960	weird.
8497960	8504320	It shows some augmented reality thing where this guy looks like his character through
8504320	8505320	the tablet.
8505320	8506320	That thing looks bizarre.
8506320	8507320	Why do they need to do that?
8507320	8511480	Didn't they just say, like, two weeks ago that the PlayStation Vita was capable of everything
8511480	8514640	that they're saying the whole Wii U will do?
8514640	8515640	I don't know.
8515640	8516640	It looks weird.
8516640	8520560	It looks like it's gonna support multiple tablets, and that it'll almost be some sort
8520560	8524720	of augmented reality thing.
8524720	8533160	It basically is titled the very generic position-dependent gaming 3D controller and handheld as remote.
8533160	8539200	Device would track its own location as input into video game and would render an avatar
8539200	8549800	on a mobile device such that it appears to overlay a competing user in the real world.
8549800	8552800	I don't know.
8552800	8557120	Maybe it's something that they're gonna implement into one of their tablets?
8557120	8560640	Maybe it'll be a cheaper option as opposed to getting a Vita, but then, like, why would
8560640	8565520	you kind of bite the, you know, take away from one to give to the other?
8565520	8568120	Like, it just seems a little weird.
8568120	8569280	I don't know.
8569280	8573920	I do like how the fact that they're a little generic console that they use on there looks
8573920	8577820	like the same console that they have rendered in Grand Theft Auto.
8577820	8581640	Their, like, generic Xbox PS3 console.
8581640	8582640	It's kind of funny.
8582640	8583640	All right.
8583640	8588600	Well, let's move on and talk about, speaking of the Vita and all that, this is seriously
8588600	8593160	the game that might convince me to get a Vita when the Vita's out, which is what, like,
8593160	8594600	next week or two weeks, I think?
8594600	8596520	The early release is next week, right?
8596520	8598020	Yeah, Valentine's Day.
8598020	8599020	Two weeks.
8599020	8600020	Oh, no.
8600020	8601020	They have their Valentine's Day.
8601020	8603920	So we're not that far away from the Vita launch over here, and I gotta say, this is the game
8603920	8607400	that makes me kind of sorry.
8607400	8611520	I get so distracted because there's this giant Gotham City Impostors ad on the page, and
8611520	8613840	it just makes me think about how this really disturbs Jamie.
8613840	8618120	Like, she really doesn't like what this game is doing, even though she's never played it.
8618120	8619760	I just don't like the concept.
8619760	8620760	I know, I know.
8620760	8621760	It'll be fun to me.
8621760	8624560	I downloaded the beta, but I just haven't run it yet.
8624560	8627640	Anyway, the game of the Vita.
8627640	8630520	Luminous Electronic Symphony.
8630520	8631520	Yay!
8631520	8635020	I gotta say, the song list looks damn impressive.
8635020	8641060	There is 34 tracks in it, and a lot of it is really good licensed stuff.
8641060	8647840	There's stuff from Cascade, 4AM is in here, Bang Bang Bang, Mark Ronson, Disco Infiltrator
8647840	8652560	by LCD Sound System, Allen will like that, Dissolve by the Chemical Brothers, Embracing
8652560	8658440	the Future by BT, Flying High by Faithless, Good Girl by Benny Benassi, Hey Boy Hey Girl
8658440	8666280	by the Chemical Brothers, an air song, Mylo, Orbital, System F, 808 State, Goldfrap, Aeroplane,
8666280	8671200	Deep Dish, Aphex Twin, Pet Shop Boys, this looks fucking great.
8671200	8677560	Like, I'm really excited about this game, so, and a lot of it sounds really awesome.
8677560	8682720	So, yeah, if you haven't seen the song list for this, you probably want to head over to
8682720	8688400	the Luminous page on Facebook and check this out, because, yeah, I'm definitely, if I pick
8688400	8693680	up a Vita launch day, which is looking very likely, because I did my taxes, and I'm looking
8693680	8697440	good, so I might be able to get one of these when they come out, so, I'm excited.
8697440	8699760	I don't think my wife will let me have one.
8699760	8701160	Aw, womp womp.
8701160	8704400	I am considering selling my 3DS to get a Vita.
8704400	8705400	To me.
8705400	8706400	We'll see.
8706400	8711720	Thinking about it, huh?
8711720	8716480	The only drawback to the whole Luminous thing is that I am still feeling a little bit bitter
8716480	8721240	about the fact that I've bought Luminous, like, five times now.
8721240	8726080	Like what, there was Luminous, Luminous 2, Luminous PC, Luminous Xbox 360, I never did
8726080	8729120	get the PlayStation 3 one, but I seriously thought about it.
8729120	8733880	I'm not in a huge hurry to get a Vita, because, like, you know, the launch games are cool,
8733880	8739840	and, you know, Konomari might be fun, but, it's not a, like, there's not anything that
8739840	8743580	I must, must, must, must have on the Vita right now, it's kind of like, well, these
8743580	8750800	are the ones I would pick, but, I don't know, it's, I might want to wait, you know, wait
8750800	8755920	until fourth quarter or something like that, because really, I mean, I don't play my 3DS,
8755920	8761720	I really don't play my 3DS, and, and I'm just kind of like, uhh, is there really something
8761720	8765920	gonna come out that I'm gonna play my 3DS for, I mean, am I really gonna want to pick
8765920	8772000	up, you know, Kid Icarus, and is it gonna be something that's gonna hold my attention?
8772000	8773000	Maybe not.
8773000	8774000	I don't think so.
8774000	8776280	And even Mario Kart's kind of just gone away.
8776280	8780120	Brakeman in our chat says, I thought Loki was about to say, I'm thinking about selling
8780120	8782320	my wife to get it.
8782320	8783320	No.
8783320	8784320	No.
8784320	8788920	Can't do that.
8788920	8790680	She'd complain about that.
8790680	8791820	She would not like that.
8791820	8792820	She would not like that.
8792820	8795760	All right, just a few more stories for you guys, then we're gonna get to the Twitter
8795760	8801960	topics and the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
8801960	8803720	But first, a few more stories.
8803720	8804720	Dark Sakura?
8804720	8808760	Actually, I have to stop and correct, bones006.
8808760	8812720	The letters U-R do not spell anything.
8812720	8814440	It spells ur.
8814440	8824160	It's Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E. Dear Lord, stop looking ignorant.
8824160	8828320	When you have U-R, that's two-thirds of an urn, which Dark Sakura will have you end up
8828320	8833520	in if you don't change your ways.
8833520	8835360	Be nice to the listeners, Jamie.
8835360	8836800	Be nice to the listeners.
8836800	8837880	I am being nice.
8837880	8842720	I'm doing them a serious favor that will help them get a job and earn the respect of people
8842720	8844660	around them.
8844660	8848480	So fuck your Yankee blue jeans.
8848480	8850640	There was a part where you did video game news.
8850640	8858800	Oh yeah, there was a comment by Kaz Hirai, who's going to be going in as CEO of Sony,
8858800	8862000	and he thinks that Sony's kind of in trouble.
8862000	8865680	He spoke with the Wall Street Journal about their financial report.
8865680	8872360	As you remember, they lost like 1.3 billion pounds, because I'm going off a British site,
8872360	8879600	so, in their last financial quarter, and expect to report a loss of 2.9 billion dollars for
8879600	8881480	the full year.
8881480	8886920	That's, I think, was it the fourth year that they've been in the red?
8886920	8888880	Something like that?
8888880	8895040	Anyway, he said, and this is a quote, I thought turning around the PlayStation business was
8895040	8898360	going to be the toughest challenge of my career, but I guess it's not.
8898360	8899480	It's one issue after another.
8899480	8903680	I feel like, holy shit, now what?
8903680	8910120	And saying that his strategy for recovery basically means we're not going to wrestle
8910120	8914820	my laurels anymore, we're going to really push the user experience.
8914820	8919560	He says that they need to buckle down and be realistic, but people are coming around
8919560	8922080	to the idea even though not everyone's on board.
8922080	8927440	If they don't catch up, they're going to die.
8927440	8932600	This just strikes me really weird that somebody like that would say, holy shit, now what?
8932600	8936400	In an interview, but I mean, I'm looking at the source in the Wall Street Journal right
8936400	8937400	here.
8937400	8938400	There it is.
8938400	8939400	That's, that's just weird.
8939400	8942640	This strikes me as odd.
8942640	8945840	I mean, we can swear all we want, but we're not CEOs of Sony.
8945840	8946840	It's just weird.
8946840	8949040	And that kid is flipping somebody off.
8949040	8952360	Wow, he totally is in this little preview.
8952360	8953360	I didn't know.
8953360	8954360	Trailer for what?
8954360	8955360	Chronicle.
8955360	8958720	Isn't that that movie you were talking about a few weeks ago that you really wanted to
8958720	8959720	see?
8959720	8960720	They came out in theaters this week.
8960720	8961720	Did you know that?
8961720	8963280	I saw this.
8963280	8966680	You don't say, did you go see it or did you see it?
8966680	8969480	That just that, that ad makes me think, fuck you clouds.
8969480	8973100	I know he's actually look at the clouds.
8973100	8974100	They're flipping him off too.
8974100	8975100	I don't know.
8975100	8976100	Yeah.
8976100	8977100	It's the clouds fingers too.
8977100	8978100	That's kind of interesting.
8978100	8982000	Anyway, so back to the story at hand.
8982000	8987120	It's weird that Sony, I mean, I feel like Sony's in a better place now so much more
8987120	8989200	than they were four years ago.
8989200	8993320	Like they were a hot mess when PlayStation three late first came out, but now things
8993320	8997400	are getting a little better, but there are still some big falls that they make.
8997400	9000320	Like, I just don't think the move.
9000320	9006560	I mean, as nice as the move is, I do think the move feels a lot better than the Wii as
9006560	9007560	it should.
9007560	9011120	The technology's a little newer, but they never really came out with that must have
9011120	9012120	game for it.
9012120	9013120	You know what I mean?
9013120	9015300	Everything kind of felt like a copycat of the Wii.
9015300	9017880	And I think that's part of where a lot of their losses come from.
9017880	9024560	But at the same time, I pretty much play games on my PS3 almost exclusively right now, unless
9024560	9030120	it's like exclusive on 360 or there's people I know on Xbox 360 that I can play the games
9030120	9033520	with, you know, or like a deliberate multiplayer game.
9033520	9036200	And all my friends are playing it on 360.
9036200	9040400	So it's just interesting that Sony is losing all this money.
9040400	9048520	But I guess now, is this considering other arms of Sony too, like not just PSP, but maybe
9048520	9053560	like, or excuse me, just not just like PlayStation and that stuff, but like movies?
9053560	9056120	I guess turn that around too.
9056120	9059320	I think it's mostly non-gaming.
9059320	9060840	I think it's more of their electronics.
9060840	9064080	Because their electronics are fucking expensive.
9064080	9067320	I mean, just insanely expensive.
9067320	9074560	We got a, as like a promotion thing, we got a gift card to Sony, and their shit is so
9074560	9076120	fucking expensive.
9076120	9077120	It's just ridiculous.
9077120	9081640	Like for stuff that's just, you know, half the price for something better elsewhere,
9081640	9086640	it's just such a markup for the brand.
9086640	9093080	Yeah, maybe when they kind of take the JC Penney approach, they'll cut all their prices
9093080	9094080	by 40%.
9094080	9100280	You know, I mean, not to say that, I mean, Sony stuff's alright, because I have a Sony
9100280	9106800	camera, a Sony camcorder, a Sony sound system, a Sony TV, a Sony PlayStation 3, a Sony PSP.
9106800	9110120	Of course, most of that stuff was given to me for free.
9110120	9113480	But it's not bad.
9113480	9116720	It's just really fucking expensive.
9116720	9125000	JV Mon in chat says, four years ago, Sony stock was worth double than what it is now.
9125000	9127400	After 2009, it's been pretty much downhill since.
9127400	9131360	Well, yeah, I mean, I don't know, I guess maybe just from the limited perspective, where
9131360	9135440	I think of Sony, I think of PlayStation, I think four years ago, they were a mess.
9135440	9138440	And maybe there was excitement about the PlayStation 3 and all that, but they, you know, there
9138440	9140760	were some huge missteps there for a couple years.
9140760	9142800	Then things got back on the right track.
9142800	9145400	And then they just, you know, they had the move happen.
9145400	9147720	They had the hack happen.
9147720	9150400	And you know, it's like they just kind of keep getting kicked down.
9150400	9157040	So they get knocked down, but they get up again.
9157040	9158920	All right.
9158920	9162700	Anyhow, let's do another story, Loki.
9162700	9169880	So let's talk a little bit about sales from a company that's struggling so hard to overcome
9169880	9172600	use game sales.
9172600	9174200	I feel so bad for these guys.
9174200	9178560	I mean, EA has got it so hard, so hard.
9178560	9180800	You said so hard.
9180800	9189200	FIFA 12 and Battlefield 3 only sold 10 million units, only 10 million units.
9189200	9191160	How do they manage?
9191160	9198640	Madden, only 5 million units sold since August.
9198640	9199780	Poor struggling company.
9199780	9200780	I feel so bad.
9200780	9201780	I'm going to go buy a new game.
9201780	9204240	I'm going to buy all their games brand new tomorrow.
9204240	9207640	Just going to go right out and buy all of them.
9207640	9210120	Just because I think they're doing such a swell job.
9210120	9211120	Or not.
9211120	9218160	Um, Star Wars The Old Republic has sold 200 million copies, and they already have...
9218160	9219160	No, no.
9219160	9220160	I'm sorry.
9220160	9221160	Not 200.
9221160	9222160	Thank you.
9222160	9223160	2 million.
9223160	9224160	I'm like, no way.
9224160	9225160	Sorry.
9225160	9232960	They have 1.7 million households, and 1.7 million are active each day, on average.
9232960	9233960	That's not bad.
9233960	9238120	I mean, for a user base, especially when they talk like, you know, EA came out with their
9238120	9243520	origin numbers where they said they have like 7 million user accounts or something like
9243520	9244520	that.
9244520	9249680	Which I'm sure a lot lesser than that percentage is active, but 1.7 out of 2 million is not
9249680	9250680	bad.
9250680	9251680	To be fair, yeah.
9251680	9256080	Wow has, what, 10 million active subscribers right now, and at their peak, they had about
9256080	9257080	12 million.
9257080	9259520	I don't know how many copies of the game they've sold.
9259520	9260520	I would guess...
9260520	9261520	That's global.
9261520	9262520	Probably like, yeah, it is global.
9262520	9265440	15 or 20 million, probably at some point.
9265440	9269600	And I mean, I mean, everybody can't be on that game every day.
9269600	9272160	I mean, some people do have, you know, other things they gotta do.
9272160	9276920	Well, I am one of those people in the Gap where I bought the game and I cancelled after
9276920	9277920	the first month.
9277920	9280680	I just didn't really want to keep playing.
9280680	9286400	It's alright, I just think the game needs some tweaks and needs some improvements.
9286400	9294800	And I don't know, some things happen in WoW and I'm playing WoW a lot more.
9294800	9301520	And then of course, EA's had the benefit of some DLC sales, and they've done well with
9301520	9302840	certain types of DLC.
9302840	9317760	In fact, in just three months, FIFA 12's Ultimate Team DLC has generated $39 million in microtransactions.
9317760	9321800	That's 69% more than it generated in the same period last year.
9321800	9322800	Gee!
9322800	9323800	I wonder why.
9323800	9324800	Wonder why.
9324800	9329360	I'm sorry, but when I heard EA gloating that statistic, I was like, that's insulting.
9329360	9334000	That is insulting because you know where that money's coming from.
9334000	9339560	You know, like, I don't know, I kind of feel like in order to justify it, EA needed to
9339560	9343520	say, oh, this is subtracting all the, you know, we didn't count the money that, you
9343520	9346600	know, we had to give back because, you know, it was stolen or whatever.
9346600	9350800	Like it's just, I don't know, like that was a really sore spot.
9350800	9354360	Like I realized their need to gloat to appease the shareholders and all that stuff.
9354360	9357800	But again, fucking stop denying that there's a problem.
9357800	9358800	Stop it.
9358800	9361440	Is EA giving back that money or is Microsoft giving back that money?
9361440	9362440	It's a thing.
9362440	9364440	Who's taking the hit on that?
9364440	9366200	I don't know.
9366200	9367200	It's all digital, so.
9367200	9370120	I would imagine Microsoft takes back the money from EA.
9370120	9372360	I mean, I imagine they have to.
9372360	9381240	And then of course they're saying, you know, to put, according to the chief financial officer
9381240	9386600	Eric Brown, to put some rough numbers on this, if we compare the total digital revenue from
9386600	9392920	FIFA 11 Ultimate Team to what we expect from FIFA 12 Ultimate Team this fiscal year, we're
9392920	9397000	looking to see a 25% increase franchise to franchise.
9397000	9401760	Yeah, I wonder where the 25% come from.
9401760	9406680	Their overall packaged goods units sold is not increasing by 25%.
9406680	9407680	Hmm.
9407680	9409240	Gee.
9409240	9415320	And so we're expanding by a decent margin the microtransactions, microtransaction revenue
9415320	9420560	per user of FIFA.
9420560	9424920	And then it's funny because, you know, like the people covering this, it's like, yeah,
9424920	9428560	we continue to receive complaints nearly every day of non FIFA players having their accounts
9428560	9431360	hacked to purchase Ultimate Team DLC.
9431360	9438480	Oh yeah, I still hear about it on Twitter and I hear about it, you know, hacked on Xbox.
9438480	9442720	You know, they're still writing down a bunch of, yeah, I forgot about that website.
9442720	9444760	I check it all the time because I'm on their Twitter feed.
9444760	9449880	I check it and they've got 30 stories on there right now and a lot more that get posted.
9449880	9453880	She's kind of running behind on posting all that because she's getting a lot of emails,
9453880	9454880	but sure.
9454880	9460800	And there's some that I saw that were so ridiculous that like, Oh yeah, you know, we were going
9460800	9467040	to re give you back your money, but we're not going to because you put your, like, you
9467040	9469000	didn't put your full name on your account.
9469000	9475420	You just put like, it'd be like, if I didn't put Matthew, I put Matt on my account.
9475420	9480000	That's bull because my legal name I don't have on my Xbox and I still got it.
9480000	9483160	Yeah, but see, they pulled that bullshit.
9483160	9484160	Stupid.
9484160	9485200	All right.
9485200	9488960	I guess I should be thankful that I didn't have quite the nightmare problem a lot of
9488960	9491680	people are having, although it did take a month.
9491680	9495480	That's the average time, 20 or 25 days is what I've been hearing.
9495480	9496480	Ridiculous.
9496480	9499080	One more ridiculous story for you guys.
9499080	9503160	Remember last week we were talking about the whole Zynga, uh, the rip off artists where
9503160	9508320	they were making their own, like was dream Heights, uh, was a complete knockoff of tiny
9508320	9509320	tower.
9509320	9512360	Well, Zynga finally came out and made a statement on the whole thing.
9512360	9516920	Uh, and it went along these lines, Mark Pincus, who's the head of Zynga quote, you should
9516920	9521320	be careful not to throw stones when you live in glass houses.
9521320	9525580	When you pull the lens back, you saw that their tower game looks similar to five other
9525580	9537760	tower games going all the way back to sim tower in the early 1990s bull shit, bull shit.
9537760	9543860	That comparison of tiny tower to sim tower is a lazy, ignorant comparison that tells
9543860	9549920	me you have never played sim tower in your life because sim tower was way, I mean in
9549920	9556000	a way sim tower is a more complex, smarter game than tiny tower.
9556000	9560200	That's not a knock on tiny tower because the great thing about tiny tower is that it's
9560200	9564280	great for a 30, 45 second, one minute fix.
9564280	9568720	That's what that game is for, but there is not nearly the level of micromanaging that
9568720	9570260	there is in sim tower.
9570260	9571820	You know what those games have in common?
9571820	9573740	They're both about skyscrapers.
9573740	9574740	That's it.
9574740	9576040	And they have tower in the name.
9576040	9579580	Like you don't really manage the people in sim tower.
9579580	9584840	You manage your tower, you manage the escalators, the elevators, what type of businesses you're
9584840	9585840	putting in.
9585840	9593680	It's just, it's a lazy, lazy comparison, especially when their game is such a blatant, you know,
9593680	9595760	rip off of all the mechanics.
9595760	9599260	Sim tower is not like tiny tower in that way.
9599260	9605480	And then moving on in an internal memo to associates, here's how they justify it.
9605480	9609160	Quote, Google didn't create the first search engine.
9609160	9612560	Apple didn't create the first MP3 player or tablet.
9612560	9615540	And Facebook didn't create the first social network.
9615540	9619940	But these companies have evolved products and categories in revolutionary ways.
9619940	9624000	They are all internet treasures because they all have specific and broad missions to change
9624000	9625000	the world.
9625000	9629600	If that wasn't blowing smoke up their employees ass, I don't know what was.
9629600	9632940	Because seriously, how is that the same?
9632940	9633940	How is that the same?
9633940	9634940	It's not.
9634940	9637480	Google didn't create the first search engine.
9637480	9640960	That's true, but they created the best search engine.
9640960	9646200	Okay, so tiny tower didn't create the first tower game.
9646200	9649520	But they created a really good one for iOS systems.
9649520	9651800	And you fucking jacked it all and made new art.
9651800	9652800	That's it.
9652800	9657720	Google didn't copy the code for Yahoo and change the name to Google on it.
9657720	9663480	And Google actually has, it's like their whole search process is done by all kinds of different
9663480	9664480	calculations, too.
9664480	9668800	I mean, it's really complex.
9668800	9669800	It's just...
9669800	9673600	And then they've taken Google and made a full spectrum product out of it.
9673600	9674600	This is their MSC.
9674600	9681640	I used to give Gameloft crap for ripping off games like Halo and stuff like that and coming
9681640	9682640	up with their own.
9682640	9683640	But you know what?
9683640	9684640	They came up with their own game.
9684640	9687040	Yes, the genre looks exactly the same as Halo.
9687040	9689820	It's a futuristic thing, it kind of resembles stuff.
9689820	9693760	But it's not a fucking like, oh, we took Halo and we reskinned everything.
9693760	9700040	Now it's, you know, Circle or Space Circle.
9700040	9704920	Brakeman in our chat room says, Zinga is currently making a podcast called Red Lounge Radio.
9704920	9707800	It will be on the More Than All Games Network.
9707800	9710200	He actually fooled somebody in chat.
9710200	9711200	Really?
9711200	9715960	Frisbee says, dear everyone who plays Zinga games, please stop being a person that plays
9715960	9716960	Zinga games.
9716960	9718200	Love humans everywhere.
9718200	9725400	Jvmon brings out the harsh reality, chat.orangelaunchradio.com saying, Zinga's stock doubled after the Facebook
9725400	9726400	IPO this week.
9726400	9729800	Well, when you see how really dependent they were on each other, as if you didn't already
9729800	9734680	know, I mean, Facebook in their filing basically had to say a lot more about the internal workings
9734680	9735680	of their company.
9735680	9740120	And one of those things is that they kind of fucking rely on Zinga for people to return
9740120	9742760	visit to Facebook, just like Zinga fucking relies on Facebook.
9742760	9745780	Because didn't Zinga try to make their own portal?
9745780	9749500	Like, I remember there was a time where Zinga was like, well, we don't really, like, remember
9749500	9752020	when Google Plus was gonna murder everything?
9752020	9755000	And Zinga was like, well, we don't really need Facebook.
9755000	9760520	We're gonna get everybody to come to our Zinga game, you know, Zinga book, or whatever they
9760520	9761520	were gonna do.
9761520	9764040	Yeah, I could see them doing that shit.
9764040	9766480	We'll make our own social network.
9766480	9767480	That's right.
9767480	9774000	We're just gonna copy paste Facebook, and we're gonna call it Portrait Journal.
9774000	9778360	Now one final note on this whole story, Nimblebit, who made Tiny Tower, did not let this all
9778360	9780680	go by unscathed.
9780680	9786320	The co-founder Ian Marsh talked to Touch Arcade and said, quote, it was a smart idea for Mark
9786320	9790720	Pincus and Zinga to try and lump all games with the name Tower together as an actual
9790720	9794080	genre whose games borrow from each other.
9794080	9798400	Sharing a name or a setting does not a genre make.
9798400	9799800	Agreed.
9799800	9806920	For example, 13 Ghosts may be about a haunted house, but it's not the same kind of movie
9806920	9810680	as High Spirits, for example.
9810680	9814880	They also, there was another game that was like some sort of bingo game or something
9814880	9818720	like that that they were also shown ripping off of, and there was also a poker game that
9818720	9821120	they also ripped off of.
9821120	9822120	This is their ML.
9822120	9823120	This is what they do.
9823120	9824120	And you know what?
9824120	9826520	No one can really fight them because their change, what they're doing is they're going
9826520	9832880	in, they're trying to change as much as they need to, to not get a lawsuit thrown at them.
9832880	9841560	Jamie, is that like saying the movie Independence Day isn't really about the 4th of July?
9841560	9849480	1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, the Skype line is open now.
9849480	9852600	Give us a call if you want to talk about anything we've talked about tonight, or maybe there's
9852600	9857520	something we missed that you wanted to bring up, or hell, I don't know, just call us if
9857520	9858520	you want to say hello.
9858520	9863440	We do have a reduced amount of live listeners tonight because of football games and so forth,
9863440	9868840	but I do see there are some of you listening there in our chat room, the few, the loyal
9868840	9869840	at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
9869840	9874680	So go ahead and call us, 1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9874680	9875680	All right.
9875680	9879960	Meanwhile, we're going to do some tweets, and what, did you have something, Loki, you
9879960	9880960	want to add?
9880960	9881960	Just real quick.
9881960	9888520	Apparently there's a PlayStation Network update that just happened that has blocked users
9888520	9892200	from accessing their paid content in the PAL territories.
9892200	9894800	Oh, it's like, what?
9894800	9900840	Apparently it's those, you know, who have done the update are getting an error labeled
9900840	9907200	as 800-231-02, which helpfully informs them that no content was found when the user tries
9907200	9912120	to download or re-download PlayStation Network content they've already purchased.
9912120	9914200	All right.
9914200	9917880	Going to our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
9917880	9922100	You know, not a lot of activities on Twitter either, although there were some nice tweets.
9922100	9924640	I'll read some of these like nice tweets that are there.
9924640	9927000	Breakman says, I might show up later for OLR.
9927000	9930240	I'll be pretty drunk though, so good luck to them.
9930240	9936760	And Curly K. T. K. on Twitter says, putting the Super Bowl on mute to listen to OLR.
9936760	9937760	Good job.
9937760	9938760	Good job.
9938760	9939760	All right.
9939760	9940760	We do have some calls coming in.
9940760	9941760	So let's go to the phones.
9941760	9942760	Hi, you're on Orange On The Radio.
9942760	9943760	Who's this?
9943760	9947520	Hey, it's the guy who's normally CD Thunder and chat, but tonight I'm God of Thunder.
9947520	9948520	How are you all doing?
9948520	9949520	Good.
9949520	9950520	How are you?
9950520	9951520	God of Thunder?
9951520	9952520	Not too bad.
9952520	9954000	I've got a couple of quick things I'd like to talk about.
9954000	9955000	Yeah.
9955000	9957560	What do you want to talk about?
9957560	9960880	First off quickly, I'd like to talk about Darkness 2.
9960880	9962680	Darkness 2.
9962680	9964880	Is this the one that's coming out or is this the one that was out?
9964880	9966920	This is the one that's coming out on Tuesday.
9966920	9967920	Okay.
9967920	9970480	What do you want to talk about Darkness 2?
9970480	9976840	Well, from what I've seen in the demo, this game looks completely over the top and gory
9976840	9981160	and sick and it just looks really awesome.
9981160	9985920	I wish I could actually play it, but yeah, it just looks really awesome.
9985920	9991000	This is the game looks over the top and gory and disgusting and I love it.
9991000	9996600	That's like how I felt after I played the Bayonetta demo.
9996600	10000840	So are you going to pre-order your copy of Darkness 2?
10000840	10007560	Well, as I said before, I don't actually have the system to play it on, but if I did, I
10007560	10008560	would.
10008560	10009560	Well, you know what you have to do?
10009560	10010560	You're going to have to steal one.
10010560	10011560	No, I'm just kidding.
10011560	10012560	Don't steal.
10012560	10013560	Don't steal.
10013560	10014560	No, no, no.
10014560	10015560	All right.
10015560	10020720	Well, do you have a friend who might buy it?
10020720	10025160	Sometimes we have a rich friend who has all that stuff, like growing up, I didn't get
10025160	10027920	a Super Nintendo when they first came out, but my rich friend did, so I'd go over to
10027920	10028920	his house.
10028920	10033600	Well, I don't know if anybody that I know would get it or not.
10033600	10034840	I just really don't know.
10034840	10035840	All right.
10035840	10037280	Well, that's all right.
10037280	10041740	But the other thing I'd like to talk about quickly is I was talking to a friend of mine
10041740	10048400	today and apparently can actually get a classic Nintendo Entertainment System controller,
10048400	10055040	USB, and plug it into your USB port in the computer and use that to play Nintendo Entertainment
10055040	10059080	System games on the website that I linked to the chat room a few minutes earlier.
10059080	10060080	What was the website?
10060080	10061080	Because you sent us the email.
10061080	10062080	You're the same guy who sent us the email.
10062080	10063080	We didn't get the website.
10063080	10064080	What is it?
10064080	10065080	It's retrouprising.com.
10065080	10068840	Now, is this going to install porn bots on my computer?
10068840	10074800	Because you know how some of these emulation sites carry porn bots.
10074800	10079760	And you know, one minute I'm playing Super Mario Brothers and the next minute, vagina!
10079760	10082400	No, I've tested out some of this stuff.
10082400	10084400	A lot of it works.
10084400	10085400	Extensively?
10085400	10086400	Yeah.
10086400	10087400	Okay.
10087400	10088400	Just checking.
10088400	10094480	Well, what retro games have you rediscovered through the website?
10094480	10099840	Well, they have stuff like Ice Climber, Donkey Kong, stuff like that.
10099840	10105600	But some of the Super Nintendo games, you actually have to have an emulator, I believe,
10105600	10110880	which unfortunately I do not have.
10110880	10113880	But you have the internet one, right?
10113880	10114880	Through the website?
10114880	10121840	Well, I'm able to do the, like, the Sega Genesis and the Nintendo Entertainment System games,
10121840	10127480	but for some reason it says it has a bar that shows the emulator is loading, then they get
10127480	10129520	a black screen.
10129520	10133200	Maybe update Java or try a different browser.
10133200	10134200	I don't know.
10134200	10135640	That's what I would do.
10135640	10138600	Or it's installing vagina all over your computer.
10138600	10139600	That could be what's happening.
10139600	10142840	I'm just saying, you've got to be very careful about some of these websites.
10142840	10144600	You've got an infestation of vagina.
10144600	10145600	That's right.
10145600	10150960	But yeah, I'll probably get the NES controller and use that to play some of those NES games,
10150960	10151960	which are pretty awesome.
10151960	10155320	Are you going to get one of those NES controllers that's like just a USB?
10155320	10156320	Yeah.
10156320	10157320	Gotcha.
10157320	10158320	All right.
10158320	10159320	Very cool.
10159320	10160320	All right.
10160320	10163320	Well, any other thoughts before we let you go?
10163320	10164320	Hmm.
10164320	10169320	Well, I hope you guys continue doing what you're doing for quite a while.
10169320	10178720	You guys keep all of us entertaining, me included, and just history of good health and so forth
10178720	10180360	and so on, et cetera, et cetera.
10180360	10181360	That's pretty much it.
10181360	10182960	Well, we appreciate it.
10182960	10185640	It's kind comments like that that keep us going because, you know, we don't make any
10185640	10186680	money off this show.
10186680	10189400	That's why I have to have rich friends.
10189400	10190400	All right.
10190400	10191400	Have a good one.
10191400	10192400	Yeah, you too.
10192400	10193400	Later.
10193400	10194400	Bye.
10194400	10195400	Bye.
10195400	10197280	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.
10197280	10204000	Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.
10204000	10206600	Meanwhile, more Twitter topics.
10206600	10212280	Tigerclaw always sending us a few stories that we may have overlooked.
10212280	10214360	Tigerclaw on Twitter tweets us this.
10214360	10219520	Apple removes several iOS copycat games from one offending developer.
10219520	10223480	So finally, this is funny that all the stuff we were talking about last week about the
10223480	10229120	whole copycat crap is starting to kind of come to light, and Apple's taken action against
10229120	10230120	some of it.
10230120	10231120	Let's see.
10231120	10235000	A blow is, again, I'm reading this story for the first time because Tigerclaw sent it to
10235000	10236000	us.
10236000	10237000	It's from Gamasutra.
10237000	10241020	It says, Apple struck a blow against video game clones today by removing several offending
10241020	10244560	apps from one rather prolific independent developer.
10244560	10253360	The games were Plant vs. Zombie, as in the one plant against one zombie, Angry Ninja
10253360	10260060	Birds, and Temple Jump, which is a knockoff of a game called Temple Run, which is funny
10260060	10264720	because Temple Jump actually was having some success on the app store, and yeah, we actually
10264720	10267740	got all the way to the top of the paid app chart.
10267740	10272940	The independent developer of the games, Anton Sinakov, and according to a Twitter post from
10272940	10279580	another iOS developer, this developer had 68 iOS apps available this morning, and now
10279580	10281680	only nine remain.
10281680	10282920	Wow.
10282920	10285980	Let's see.
10285980	10292680	One of the developers who was copied in this case, Imangi, says, we were really happy with
10292680	10297200	how quickly Apple responded to the situation and removed Temple Jump.
10297200	10302440	The app was clearly a scam that traded entirely on the popularity of Temple Run and was packaged
10302440	10304160	to confuse users.
10304160	10305160	Booyah.
10305160	10309560	A mole cart's gone now, right?
10309560	10313200	Now my question is, when are they going to start taking down the Zynga games?
10313200	10314200	Probably never.
10314200	10316160	But anyway, we're getting another call, so let's go to the phones.
10316160	10317600	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10317600	10318600	Who's this?
10318600	10319600	Tesler.
10319600	10325600	Log in and play.
10325600	10329700	Are you calling to harass me to get me to come play WoW when I'm trying to do a show
10329700	10331700	on the internets?
10331700	10333820	Maybe.
10333820	10338080	Who told you how to find my show?
10338080	10341920	I don't even have to ask.
10341920	10342920	Let me ask you some questions.
10342920	10345080	Well, first off, introduce yourself to the listeners.
10345080	10346840	Who am I speaking with?
10346840	10347840	All right.
10347840	10354760	So for all four of you out there who are listening, this is Mel Dool, and I play with your gracious
10354760	10357560	host on a game called World of Warcraft.
10357560	10361680	So Dark Soccer, this is one of the people that's in that guild I joined over on Proudmoore's
10361680	10362680	server.
10362680	10363680	You mean the one that I'm in?
10363680	10364680	Yes.
10364680	10365680	Now?
10365680	10366680	Yeah, you just joined not that long ago.
10366680	10367680	Yeah.
10367680	10368680	Hi.
10368680	10369680	So he's calling to harass me.
10369680	10370680	Hey, what's going on?
10370680	10371680	He says that instead of doing the show, I should be playing WoW with him.
10371680	10373680	The show that I've been doing for 10 years.
10373680	10374680	Do you need Dungeons Run?
10374680	10375680	Do you need Valor Points?
10375680	10378680	Do you need LFR?
10378680	10382160	I need all those things and a port.
10382160	10383160	You need a port.
10383160	10384880	He needs a port.
10384880	10385880	So I have to sign in.
10385880	10387480	Welcome to my life.
10387480	10388480	I know.
10388480	10389480	Because this is the funny thing.
10389480	10394680	Dark Sakura plays an Arcane Mage on Alliance side, and now I have this Arcane Mage on Horde.
10394680	10395680	Port please.
10395680	10396680	Port please.
10396680	10397680	Right?
10397680	10398680	5G.
10398680	10399680	Right?
10399680	10400680	Well, I'll do that since that's like what?
10400680	10401680	500% inflation?
10401680	10402680	Exactly.
10402680	10405840	But now I've learned after your story earlier this evening, I'll never get paid for it.
10405840	10408920	People will just swindle me like you did that poor death knight.
10408920	10411160	No, you make them pay you and then you open the portal.
10411160	10412160	I see.
10412160	10413160	Alright.
10413160	10414160	Exactly.
10414160	10417960	Well, look, Meladoul, do you play any other video games besides WoW?
10417960	10424120	I, I, oh wait, I gotta turn myself down here because I can hear myself talking.
10424120	10427040	Yeah, it's always a little awkward, especially when there's a huge delay.
10427040	10428040	Right.
10428040	10431360	Even though I do sound pretty good on the radio, maybe I should have my own radio show.
10431360	10432360	Me too.
10432360	10433360	Me too.
10433360	10434800	That's why I've been doing this so long is I sound great on the radio.
10434800	10436400	I'm just like listening to himself talk.
10436400	10437400	I do.
10437400	10438400	I do.
10438400	10442800	Well, hey, at the risk of like completely losing all of my sex life by, by admitting
10442800	10449000	these things, um, I will admit to playing a little Final Fantasy, uh, here and there.
10449000	10451120	And, uh, I, what else do I play?
10451120	10457400	I was a huge, huge EverQuest gamer for a long time before that, uh, the time.
10457400	10458400	Oh, gosh, EverQuest.
10458400	10461000	That, that's, that's a lot of geek points right there.
10461000	10463640	RIP EverQuest, RIP.
10463640	10466760	Which Final Fantasy, which Final Fantasy, because there's a lot of them.
10466760	10471520	There's one through 13 and now there's 13, two and 10, two and zero.
10471520	10474280	I don't even know how to count that high in Roman numerals.
10474280	10480280	Like I'm just like Final Fantasy X, X, X porn, X, I.
10480280	10483440	There actually was a Final Fuck X in Japan.
10483440	10484440	Perfect.
10484440	10485440	I have this.
10485440	10486620	I can play that.
10486620	10488520	It's basically just bad cosplay boinging.
10488520	10489520	Yeah.
10489520	10492280	It's basically just chicks dressed up as the characters in Final Fantasy 10 and they get
10492280	10493280	fucked.
10493280	10498280	And the weird thing about Japanese porn is that they have to blur the penetration.
10498280	10499280	So yeah.
10499280	10500280	Yeah.
10500280	10501640	And then the guys aren't dressed up.
10501640	10503800	The guys are just like, Hey, I'm here to fuck Yuna.
10503800	10504800	Okay.
10504800	10508560	Well see, you gotta be careful because you could, if you're not, if you don't blur it,
10508560	10511280	you could have an infestation of vagina.
10511280	10512280	That's true.
10512280	10513280	That's true.
10513280	10514280	Just like the last caller.
10514280	10516240	If you're on a bad website, you just knock, knock.
10516240	10517240	Who's there?
10517240	10519560	Too much vagina is never a good thing.
10519560	10521560	You want to get moderation.
10521560	10522560	Never.
10522560	10523560	Never.
10523560	10524560	Never.
10524560	10525560	So yeah.
10525560	10526560	Um, yeah, totally.
10526560	10529000	That's, that's, uh, those are the games that I played for a while.
10529000	10530000	I love tactics.
10530000	10532160	That was my, that was my big thing.
10532160	10534600	Final Fantasy Tactics was a great game.
10534600	10535600	It was a great game.
10535600	10536600	Final Fantasy Tactics was awesome.
10536600	10541840	And then they, what they have the versions on, uh, what systems, uh, Game Boy Advance
10541840	10544080	had one and then they ported it.
10544080	10548080	Ah, there's another one on, uh, Iniscacy.
10548080	10549080	Didn't they make another port?
10549080	10550080	It was a PSP.
10550080	10551080	It was just a PSP.
10551080	10552080	Yeah.
10552080	10553080	That was the only one.
10553080	10554080	All right.
10554080	10562840	Well, I, I, I loved Final Fantasy two with like, you know, the U S version where it was
10562840	10565520	like Final Fantasy three or something in Japan.
10565520	10566520	They couldn't get it right.
10566520	10567520	I don't know.
10567520	10568520	Yeah.
10568520	10569520	It was, it was awesome.
10569520	10570520	But you know what?
10570520	10573400	I will, I will stop harassing you and let you get to your radio show.
10573400	10574400	All right.
10574400	10575400	I appreciate it.
10575400	10576400	Totally.
10576400	10577400	You know, cut it short.
10577400	10578400	I need a port.
10578400	10579400	All right.
10579400	10582520	Well, you might have to buy one unless you want to wait till about 11 o'clock my time
10582520	10583520	when I'll finally sign in.
10583520	10584520	Unacceptable.
10584520	10585520	All right.
10585520	10587520	Have a good one.
10587520	10591400	And I'm really sorry that now you're not going to get laid for like six weeks cause you admitted
10591400	10592400	things on air.
10592400	10593400	All right.
10593400	10595400	I'll talk to you later.
10595400	10596400	Bye.
10596400	10601040	One eight seven seven Game O L R username on Skype is orange lounge radio.
10601040	10604400	It's very, uh, amusing.
10604400	10605400	Don't let it fool you.
10605400	10606400	He's a total asshole.
10606400	10607400	No, I'm kidding.
10607400	10608400	I'm kidding.
10608400	10612240	I've really been, I like everybody in that guild so far.
10612240	10614400	We've been pretty, pretty nice people.
10614400	10616040	You know, I have that Shane guy.
10616040	10618440	Yeah, he's an ass.
10618440	10623280	But the first, the first, like I joined that guild because I knew that they were doing
10623280	10626480	some rating and that they were just starting and I was like, all right, well, you know,
10626480	10627480	cause nothing's happening on Alliance.
10627480	10628480	Why not?
10628480	10630000	I'm going to try this to work out my heart.
10630000	10635120	The first night I went on the raid with the group, I was like, this might be a bit of
10635120	10636120	a hot mess.
10636120	10637120	I don't know.
10637120	10641560	But, um, you know, the next week actually we, we rated again last and it was, it was
10641560	10642560	really good.
10642560	10645720	And I think like, you know, they made some tweaks to the group and it really worked and
10645720	10647360	we cleared like five bosses in one night.
10647360	10648360	So it's a good time.
10648360	10649360	On Firelands?
10649360	10650360	Uh, no, the new one.
10650360	10651360	Dragon Soul.
10651360	10652360	Oh, the new one, Dragon Soul?
10652360	10653360	Yeah.
10653360	10654360	I got a new belt.
10654360	10655360	Yay.
10655360	10656360	Leet loots.
10656360	10662640	You know what, I actually got, someone just gave me random kudos for having two tier thirteens
10662640	10666440	and two tier twelves because you actually get the bonuses from both sets.
10666440	10667440	Right.
10667440	10668440	Yeah.
10668440	10669960	And it's kind of neat having extra haste with a double.
10669960	10673260	I want that on my mage because I have the tier 12 bonus, but anyway, sorry.
10673260	10676040	We're getting, this discussion is getting a little too Hoard House, which by the way
10676040	10680480	is the other Warcraft show I do sometimes, www.hoardhouse.com.
10680480	10681480	I'm going to be honest.
10681480	10682520	Let's have some real talk for a minute.
10682520	10685680	I don't know when there's going to be another episode of Hoard House because like Extifer
10685680	10690320	is now like busy on the weekends all the time because I don't, I don't know if I should
10690320	10694600	say this, but he's seen, he's got an infestation of a giant.
10694600	10700400	He hasn't, he hasn't, we'll put it that way, Extifer has an infestation of a vagina all
10700400	10701400	week.
10701400	10704040	No, he's, he's, he's seeing a boy and I met the boy the other night and he's really cool.
10704040	10708440	So I don't want to, you know, so you know, I don't know what's going to happen.
10708440	10710800	So it's going to be really hard for us to kind of like coordinate our schedules and
10710800	10711800	so forth.
10711800	10713200	And plus he's not playing wow.
10713200	10716000	So I know.
10716000	10718760	So we have to get guests that can fill in the gaps and so forth.
10718760	10721280	I'll be more than happy to fill in if you want to record.
10721280	10722280	I know.
10722280	10723280	I know.
10723280	10725600	I don't know what's going to happen now, but it's just, don't expect Horde House every
10725600	10728720	week sadly until we get some of this stuff worked out.
10728720	10732960	So especially like a common, uh, date and time and all that.
10732960	10734400	All right.
10734400	10737480	Tiger Claw in chat says, I bet Rob is strict and mean in the Guild.
10737480	10740800	When someone underperforms, he'll yell at them like a drill Sergeant.
10740800	10744520	I don't yell.
10744520	10746660	What are you doing going to that side?
10746660	10747660	We said this one.
10747660	10748660	No, that's not Rob.
10748660	10749660	No, I don't really do that.
10749660	10754320	I do, I've, I like to think I'm fair and I'm nice and I'm patient.
10754320	10756840	I'm very fucking patient.
10756840	10761840	But like I hit the, I get to these moments where I fucking snap.
10761840	10763760	This is what Rob sounds like.
10763760	10769840	Like I'm going to do the, uh, what was the, the boss in black rock?
10769840	10770840	The Faryon.
10770840	10771840	Faryon.
10771840	10772840	This is Rob on the Faryon.
10772840	10773840	Okay.
10773840	10774840	Get to the platform.
10774840	10775840	Okay.
10775840	10776840	Don't forget to interrupt.
10776840	10777840	You interrupt.
10777840	10778840	You interrupt.
10778840	10779840	Are you healing?
10779840	10780840	What happened?
10780840	10781840	Or what happened to your mana?
10781840	10784160	Are you healing?
10784160	10785160	What was that?
10785160	10786160	Why did we wipe?
10786160	10787160	Okay.
10787160	10788160	I think we wiped because this, this, this, and this.
10788160	10789160	All right.
10789160	10790160	Let's try it again.
10790160	10791160	Get to the platform.
10791160	10792160	That's Rob.
10792160	10795920	A little bit, a little bit.
10795920	10796920	All right.
10796920	10803880	Uh, let's see another story here from the Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R. Tiger Claw
10803880	10805960	sends us this link.
10805960	10810000	Nintendo zone to feature full episodes of Pokemon.
10810000	10811000	Yay.
10811000	10816720	3DS owners get free wifi access at 29,000 Nintendo zone locations.
10816720	10818720	Oh, that's that new channel on my 3DS.
10818720	10820960	I can't figure out what it's used for.
10820960	10826000	Um, Nintendo zone will offer much more content for 3DS owners.
10826000	10829920	There will be a dedicated Pokemon section that will feature full length episodes of
10829920	10832320	the Pokemon TV series.
10832320	10836120	And uh, yeah, McDonald's or Starbucks are both Nintendo zone partners.
10836120	10839760	That's actually kind of cool, especially if I can get like old school Pokemon episodes.
10839760	10843160	Like remember when I had all those Pokemon DVDs, I still do have some of them up there.
10843160	10844160	I know.
10844160	10845160	Oh, you know what?
10845160	10846160	I have Rob.
10846160	10847160	What?
10847160	10856040	Japanese Digimon DVDs for the record, O L R has a one in three occurrence of vagina.
10856040	10858680	Ah, all right.
10858680	10862000	Oh, well our Skype line unfortunately isn't ringing anymore.
10862000	10863000	I guess.
10863000	10870360	Uh, I guess I guess people just wanted to call and yell at me or talk about old games.
10870360	10871360	So that's all right.
10871360	10872760	They've come down with the case.
10872760	10874880	Our usual callers are at their Superbowl parties.
10874880	10875880	It's fine.
10875880	10876880	I understand.
10876880	10879820	Hey, look, he joined the chat room.
10879820	10882080	It's the artist behind every little step.
10882080	10885880	Bobby Blackpool speaking of the Superbowl.
10885880	10886880	All right.
10886880	10887880	Oh, sorry.
10887880	10888880	It's super bowels.
10888880	10889880	We're going to wrap it up.
10889880	10890880	We're getting out of here.
10890880	10892480	We're getting out of here for the night.
10892480	10894040	Last minute stories.
10894040	10896920	Loki, do you have anything you want to share for last minute stories?
10896920	10902040	Uh, just one small thing that I noticed that Joyce had posted a little thing about this
10902040	10903280	game.
10903280	10905120	It's a free indie game.
10905120	10911720	Um, and it's a really oddly named game called the cat that got milk or the cat that got
10911720	10913800	the milk.
10913800	10918040	Not necessarily what it sounds like, but it's a, it's a free game.
10918040	10919040	Go check it out.
10919040	10925920	Um, it's a pretty short, only 10, 15 minutes, but it's a, the cat that got the milk.com
10925920	10933600	and um, it looks pretty awesome based on the trailer.
10933600	10934720	All right.
10934720	10936640	Let's go around and wrap up the show.
10936640	10937840	We're at the end of the show.
10937840	10938840	We've done all the stories.
10938840	10939840	We've done all the calls.
10939840	10940840	We've done all the news.
10940840	10942280	We're time to wrap it up.
10942280	10944440	So, um, Dark Sakura, we'll start with you.
10944440	10946280	Your final thought tonight?
10946280	10947960	Vagina.
10947960	10948960	How lovely.
10948960	10949960	Loki.
10949960	10950960	Your final thought tonight?
10950960	10956000	Uh, the character that I was talking about earlier at Soul Calibur five is Lord Geo Dom
10956000	10959900	Pierre, which was a pre-order bonus at Best Buy.
10959900	10964400	My final thought is Jigglypuff.
10964400	10966800	That's going to do it guys for another episode of orange launch radio.
10966800	10969600	Thank you guys so much for downloading and listening to our show.
10969600	10972480	Even if it was just to yell at me that you needed a port somewhere.
10972480	10975080	Um, we're going to do this all again next week.
10975080	10978160	You know what we ask if you've enjoyed what you hear here at orange launch radio.
10978160	10982600	Remember, we don't have a big magazine backing us with millions of dollars.
10982600	10984200	We don't have all these ads and stuff.
10984200	10986440	You know, all we ask, tell a friend about the show.
10986440	10990620	Help spread the word of orange lounge radio and we'll come back to do it all again next
10990620	10991620	week.
10991620	10994860	So, uh, next week I'm hoping to talk a little more in depth about Soul Calibur five after
10994860	10996580	I get some more hands on time with it.
10996580	10998460	I don't know what my co-host will be playing.
10998460	10999460	Hands on.
10999460	11002120	Maybe get some time in with Evita if I know anyone that gets one early.
11002120	11003120	We'll see.
11003120	11004480	I'll have to go find my rich friends.
11004480	11006600	But until then, that's going to do it.
11006600	11010440	Myself, Dark Soccer and Loki saying, good night.
11010440	11014960	You've been listening to orange lounge radio.
