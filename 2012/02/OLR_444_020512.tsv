14129	15530	Tonight, February 5th, 2012.
15650	19992	Could mature video games soon carry an extra sales tax?
20432	25715	Game Gear games are spotted for the 3DS, and a creation kit is set to come for Skyrim.
32335	40278	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
40838	47521	It is episode number 444, that's three fours, not four fours, for this February the 5th of 2012.
48681	58907	We are live as we are every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, where we tape live, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
58947	59587	Although not tonight.
59627	60508	Bobby had the night off.
60548	61849	Something about a superb owl.
62089	64370	He was a superb owl or something he was doing.
64410	66672	I thought he had to do a stupor or something.
67052	67552	Something like that.
67592	71835	So anyway, my name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host.
71995	75136	First off, you already heard her, but it's Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
75236	76557	Or maybe it was Super Bowels.
77298	77718	Ha ha ha!
78098	78679	Maybe that was it.
78979	79659	It might have been.
79699	80060	I don't know.
80100	80660	Something like that.
81420	84402	Also, say hello, of course, to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
84543	84803	Hi.
85063	85703	How are you, Loki?
85863	86344	I'm fine.
86624	92268	Now, there's like a game that a lot of the live listeners like to play on the show, and that is, you know, where did Loki get his food tonight?
92568	98152	Because you like to go to like fast food restaurants or you go to, you know, whatever restaurant you take out and you bring it to the show to munch on air.
98172	99613	Because, you know, we do this show at dinnertime.
100153	100293	Yeah.
100333	102855	So if we don't eat before or after, we're kind of screwed.
102875	105297	So but you went to two restaurants tonight, right?
105317	105397	Yeah.
105777	110161	I went to KFC and got some honey barbecue wings, and then I went to McDonald's and got some fries.
111742	114764	So you had wings and fries for this superb owl day.
115025	115205	Yeah.
115425	115725	I see.
116226	117086	It's very appropriate.
117106	129096	Well, I wanted to go to someplace else other than fast food, but the teriyaki place nearby closed, and the fish and chips place nearby, they're closed today.
130157	133219	And it's just like all the other places are closed.
133359	135281	I got one at the Quiznos, I guess, but eh.
135843	136143	I got food too
163089	164170	Where'd you get food from tonight?
164331	164851	Whole Foods.
166293	167474	How healthy?
167775	168716	You damn dirty hippie?
169216	170438	Hey, it was delicious.
170578	171399	And it had grapes in it.
171949	174230	All right, so obviously Pink Elephant in the room.
174290	189596	We are live on a night where usually there's not a lot of stuff going on anywhere, not on TV, not anywhere, unless you're, you know, the network that's carrying the Super Bowl, because we are up against... I was going to say, I did hear something big happen today, and that was Madonna said, fuck you to everybody.
189896	191076	Well, that was MIA, I guess.
191436	192037	Oh, MIA?
192077	194318	Yeah, because she had her whole little entourage with her.
194358	195158	No, Madonna, you know...
195658	197639	Can we take like five seconds to judge Madonna?
197679	198059	Sure, go ahead.
215891	216431	Okay, I'm done.
217132	225097	Chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to join us live in our chat room and talk along with the program and all that good stuff.
225557	230741	So I got to say, look, look, I don't want to keep ragging on Madonna because I do love Madonna.
230781	232402	Like, no, seriously, I'm gay.
232462	233463	I have to love Madonna.
233503	235064	Like, it's like a requirement.
235324	236245	She was pre-Gaga.
236425	237185	She's been slipping.
237525	240107	Like, I don't even want to make a Madonna Gaga thing.
240147	241108	Like, that's not a thing.
241148	242429	People need to stop making that a thing.
242469	243089	It's not a thing.
243870	245551	It's an evolution of styles.
246392	247533	What's an evolution of music?
247633	248093	Sure.
248173	250235	It was clearly an influence.
250795	251976	Here's the thing about Madonna.
252317	253158	She's kind of slipping.
253298	256641	And I don't know what it is, but that new song, not good.
257141	258242	It's just not good.
258963	259423	But anyway.
261345	264327	Was there ever a Madonna video game trying to get back on topic?
264688	265509	I don't think there was.
266533	268034	Wasn't Ray of Light in something?
268734	270255	It might have been like in a dance game.
270315	270635	I don't know.
271076	271316	All right.
271356	276819	Look, we do, of course, always invite our live chatters at chat.orangelounge.com.
276839	280781	However, we do ask the live chatters, don't talk about the Super Bowl in the chat room.
280901	291928	It's not that we want to like censor you or, you know, but it's just as I'm trying to look through chat room and read comments that are relevant to the show, I don't need to see a bunch of like woo giants, woo patriots, blah, blah, blah, you know, whatever going on in there.
291988	292448	So, yeah.
292848	294509	Try to keep the Super Bowl chat out.
294589	296431	However, Puppy Bowl chat is just fine.
296831	298572	If you want to talk about the Puppy Bowl, we'll deal with that.
298592	302635	What about that cute little lab that was drinking from the bowl when we were watching?
302695	305157	Well, this year's Puppy Bowl was all about fumble.
305717	306438	It seemed like.
306478	307859	The whole time was fumble.
307879	309620	But I was a big fan of Oscar the Dashun.
309980	311802	Happy birthday, Tiger Claw.
312382	312842	That's right.
312882	314123	It is Tiger Claw's birthday.
314524	317366	We should take a minute to acknowledge Tiger Claw because he does a lot.
317606	320548	You know, the network that we're on, allgames.com, like...
322344	323564	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
343712	344473	He's the P.A.
362543	364304	The personal assistant to director.
364404	364665	Okay.
364725	366546	So he's the one that actually gets the stuff done.
367327	367627	Yes.
367967	369588	That's a very good way of putting it.
369628	370769	That's a great way of putting it.
370809	377614	He's the director's assistant or the one that's actually doing all the work because he's, you know, making sure that all the live shows are up.
377734	378435	Like we...
378835	379536	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
398394	398674	Why?
398754	400214	Because he loves the network.
400475	403175	Or he's getting money that we don't know about.
403275	403735	I don't know.
403795	404816	I think it's the first one.
404876	408357	So absolutely a special happy birthday to Tigerclaw.
408397	412998	Because without Tigerclaw, I don't know if there'd be a network still going right now.
413018	419339	Because if the power went down, probably people wouldn't notice until the next live broadcaster's like, where's my show?
419579	424121	Do you know that our buddy Brad from PodCulture just got the first gong of the year?
424141	424981	Uh-oh.
425081	425781	What did Brad do?
426508	428630	He said he heard the puppy bull just went to the dogs.
430991	431292	Nice.
432492	435114	I went old school and went with the gong instead of the sad trombone.
436575	436876	All right.
438177	451486	Okay, so I want to start off, since we can't ignore the big sports thing that's going on, I realize most people this week are probably downloading this via the podcast, because I guess it's just an American tradition or something.
451767	454629	Did you know that Paula Deen was in Sacramento this week?
455109	456650	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
479762	482184	From what I remember... Her personal hamstache!
483265	485607	From what I remember of him, him being a big fan of Paula Deen.
485667	486788	Is it coated in butter?
486828	489490	Didn't he have like a little southern twang, if I remember right?
489950	493133	He was a big fan of... Not Paula Deen.
493173	493733	It's been like years.
493813	494073	It was...
496414	496955	Rachel Ray?
497135	498917	No, it's a country music star.
499177	503282	It's some country female country music star.
503902	504663	Trisha Yearwood?
505004	505304	No.
505384	506706	I'm trying to think of the five.
507126	507947	Shania Twain.
509329	511031	Might be Shania Twain.
511051	511671	She's Canadian.
511711	513533	Even though she hasn't been around in about 15 years.
514034	515315	No, maybe that's not it.
515435	515556	It's...
516854	517435	I don't remember.
517715	518115	Oh, whatever.
518175	518675	It doesn't matter.
518835	519676	It's not important.
520136	522577	The important thing is that she looks like she's made of plastic.
522997	523277	Yes.
524558	526919	By the way, I have to tell you the sad thing that happened yesterday.
527239	527439	What?
527940	530561	Becky and I were at the Crocker Art Museum for Free Museum Day.
531181	534783	And we were standing next to this younger couple just looking at a picture.
535263	537444	And the guy's like, wow, this looks like a Rush album.
537784	539065	And she's like, what's Rush?
539985	545188	And Becky and I turned around and in unison with her boyfriend said, what's Rush?
545408	545648	What?
549491	551853	And she looked like she wanted to crawl into a corner and die.
554015	557678	At least that didn't happen on 2-1-12 because that would have been a disaster.
559299	559619	Anyway.
560080	561621	Alright, can we actually talk about video games?
561761	562081	Sure.
562101	562622	Maybe possibly.
562642	564323	But I thought that that was worth sharing.
564443	564744	Alright.
564924	565544	No, it's fine.
565604	566025	It's fine.
567329	569590	I played some Because they're ass Because I hate football
594244	597165	Well, I don't... Personally, I don't hate football.
597225	599066	Like, hate's a strong word, but I don't know.
599126	605908	Like, I think I'm just willing to admit I'm not very good at sports games because I'm not very knowledgeable about a lot of the sports.
606288	610009	And for me, a lot of these games like Madden and stuff get really, like, detailed and stuff.
610029	619832	And when I look at all these, like, you know, maps of the X's and O's and things like that... And I'm sure, like, a lot of football fans, I'm going to sound like the biggest idiot in the world right now, but, like, you have to realize there's some people that don't really watch sports, you guys.
620592	640226	So I can't really follow a lot of those new sports games But I thought, that doesn't mean I hate all sports games Because that's certainly not true There's some sports games out there I actually really enjoy So I thought we could talk a little bit about sports games that don't suck So DarkSakura, I know you say you hate football But are there any sports games you can think of that you really enjoy?
642407	649633	The only football game I've ever really enjoyed was Super High Impact on Super Nintendo My brothers and I would play the crap out of that And NBA Jam
652177	654498	and NBA Jam.
654518	657600	NBA Jam's pretty damn good.
657620	663884	That skiing game on the PC that I used to scream at that was on the old... No, on the PC.
665822	666322	Whiskey.
666783	668784	Loki, you need to talk into a mic or they can't hear you.
668884	669704	Yeah, Ski Free.
670485	670925	Ski Free.
671085	672206	That game would piss me off.
672586	674407	Oh, actually, I remember one that I really, really liked.
675708	676268	Alpine Racer.
677749	679710	I freaking loved Alpine Racer.
680330	682311	And we had one at my arcade.
682372	683472	I played the shit out of that.
683492	684333	I was super good at it.
685093	690736	And I liked... It's not really, you know, sports, but I'll count it as prop cycle.
691137	691577	Yeah.
692177	714543	that's stretching it that's like saying DDR and taking the easy way out of this question I didn't say DDR uh some sports games that I've enjoyed in the past I used to play a game on the NES back in the day that I loved and I think it was like baseball baseball stars was that it you could like manage I have that game yes that game that game was awesome on Neo Geo
715526	717427	But they had an NES version of it, right?
717827	718248	I think they did.
718348	719748	Maybe it was RBI Baseball or something.
719808	720889	No, it wasn't RBI Baseball.
720909	721589	It wasn't any other baseball.
721609	727253	No, I think that Baseball Stars was the... I think they did a Neo Geo... That wasn't on Neo Geo.
727273	728553	The version of the Neo Geo one.
728674	730695	I think, like, they did one on the NES.
730975	738579	And then, like, you know, because that didn't... The folks at Neo... They made some games on Nintendo before they spun off to their own thing.
738639	739820	So, anyway...
741001	743503	Other stuff I enjoy, Blades of Steel will always be one of my favorites.
743903	746585	Actually, I had Ice Hockey and Blades of Steel on the NES.
746605	747526	Those are both great games.
749007	752449	I really like a lot of racing games if you want to try and get a little more modern.
752690	760296	I do like a lot of, like I like the, although I don't know if it's really sports borderline, but I like the Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune games.
760336	761096	That's not a sport.
762177	763138	Racing is not a sport.
763820	765022	Drifting is not a sport.
765562	768986	I mean, drifting, they have competitions, but it's not like a sport.
769167	775995	I've played the NASCAR games and I've enjoyed them, like in the arcade, you know, like the big old simulations that you get in there and get into.
776095	776676	I like those.
777196	777977	So those are pretty cool.
778658	781422	I'm trying to think if there's a... Oh, you know what?
781442	781462	I...
782583	799638	I really enjoyed, at least in the past, I haven't played a lot of them recently, but I remember when I was growing up, I used to love, on the Commodore 64, because you all know I loved my Commodore 64 growing up, I used to play the shit out of Winter Games and Summer Games 2, which were kind of like the Olympic, I mean there was a Summer Games 1, but we didn't own it.
800038	826409	so I had those other ones those are kind of like their Olympic games where you could do like cycling and you know if it was winter games you could do I don't know like I think figure skating and speed skating and some of the other stuff they have so I like the Olympics like I really do like that as far as sports go anyway so I like usually a lot of the Olympic games I even played the demo for that Mario and Sonic 2012 Olympic game that's coming out later this year because they have the 3DS demo out right now
827009	830351	I like the trampoline one because that was the only one where you really noticed the 3D.
831311	832892	But the cycling one drove me bonkers.
834753	836254	And some of the ones DarkSakura said.
836274	839336	I used to play NBA Jam in the arcade all the time.
839576	843558	I really tried to like this new NBA Jam that just came out, but I didn't really care for it.
844879	846279	The new one that was on, yeah.
846499	848621	I downloaded the demo on Fire Edition or whatever.
849101	849761	Didn't care for it.
849941	850442	It was not good.
850562	851262	That sad face.
851682	852563	Yeah, I tried.
853183	856546	You know, what was the game?
856726	857567	California Games.
858848	859949	Oh yeah, California Games.
860449	864293	Yeah, that was originally an Amiga game.
864993	866695	I wasn't great at it, but it was okay.
867195	868076	But it had the Unreal 360.
869698	875182	Well, they tried to keep... Actually, that's like a spinoff of the Summer Games and Winter Games.
875483	878826	Because they kind of ran out of stuff to do Olympic related.
878846	878966	720 and...
880447	883248	Well, that was a different series, but yeah, 720 was awesome.
884188	885608	Anyhow, Loki, what about you?
886909	895411	I used to play some of the NFL Blitz arcade game back in, I don't know, when I worked at Roundtable.
895591	896251	That was kind of fun.
898352	903213	And then Co-op, it's running.
904791	906854	I don't know, I don't play a lot of sports games.
907414	912840	Okay, I thought of a racing game that ought to count because everybody fucking loved this game when they were a kid.
914522	917546	Iron Man, Ivan Stewart's Super Off-Road Racing.
917706	919148	Every pizza parlor had that, right?
919168	919788	I never played it.
920549	921390	I actually never played that one.
921511	922272	Oh my god.
922632	923994	That had an awesome NES.
924135	926278	I remember when the NES version of that came out.
926298	926739	Super NES.
927039	927600	Or was it NES?
927640	932648	No, it was regular NES because it was one of the few games that supported the... Multitap?
932688	934050	The Ultitap or whatever it was called.
934530	935071	The Multitap.
936623	942912	If I was going to count a racing game as included, then I would totally, totally just put in the original Ridge Racer.
944193	947999	Because that was a money sucker for me.
948700	951043	If I hadn't worked at the damn arcade, I would have been broke.
952498	953980	All right, going to our chat room for some comments.
954500	956002	If I got everything for Loki, sorry.
956282	956782	Just want to make sure.
957783	958084	Sure.
959725	965711	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com Kaijudo says, Baseball All-Stars was awesome and I had it on Nintendo.
967013	970696	RDGSinge says, OMG, no one mentioned track and field.
971437	972318	That one was okay.
972378	978481	You know they had an Xbox Live port of that way back in the beginning when it was a bunch of old 80s Konami games were being ported over.
978841	983003	But it's really... I mean, it's good, but it's really just button mashing.
983223	992548	I did play Track and Field not even like three months ago, though, the last time I was at Electronica at Disneyland because they have the whole Flynn's Arcade and they had a Track and Field machine.
992568	993369	I played it on my...
994309	995830	Arcade Cabinet not too long ago.
996070	996291	Yeah.
996591	997451	Well, a few months ago.
997472	1003456	But it's really just like, you know, but I guess then again, the Commodore 64 games were no better.
1003576	1005137	So what am I, who am I to judge?
1007459	1008600	So, all right.
1008820	1012143	Anyhow, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks.
1012203	1015685	We usually like to start off the show, talk about the video games that we've been playing this week.
1016006	1017587	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1017607	1017727	What?
1017907	1018548	I played WoW.
1018929	1020131	And something epic happened.
1020832	1021834	Okay, I have to tell a story.
1021874	1023176	I told you earlier, but I'm going to tell the newie.
1023196	1023357	Okay.
1023958	1027945	So this guy named LichRage on Blade's Edge Alliance, HumanDK...
1032064	1039089	I was wandering around trying to finish the Love is in the Air crap, you know, they do for Valentine's suck.
1040050	1047095	And there's this thing that you have to throw rose petals on certain race and class combinations, and one of them is a human death knight.
1047576	1049897	So I just went in trade chat and said, is there a human death knight around?
1050878	1052900	And this one said, yeah, ten gold.
1054101	1056202	So I invited him into my party.
1057283	1057303	I
1057623	1060044	and targeted him and then left the party.
1060364	1061285	And he said, you lied.
1062225	1066587	I'm like, you shouldn't have been charging for something that's a free service.
1067628	1069809	And he's like, I've only got 20 gold.
1070229	1071950	And I'm like, so?
1072050	1073370	Go out and earn it like the rest of us.
1073510	1075871	Mining and herbalism are your friends.
1076592	1077672	And he said, suck it.
1077692	1079853	I don't do plenty of the herbalism.
1080934	1082735	So he's like, suck it.
1082795	1083595	And I was like, ignore.
1085293	1087139	You should have just put, deal with it, happy face.
1089258	1091738	Well, I wasn't rude to him.
1092099	1097039	You know, I was like, you know, when I started off... You swindled him.
1097800	1098660	I didn't swindle him.
1099340	1100020	Maybe a little bit.
1100080	1100460	A little bit.
1100500	1101480	You swindled him a little bit.
1101500	1102860	He thought I swindled him.
1103261	1106241	If you could, you would have had your character show her boobies a little bit.
1106781	1115163	Because my intention was the moment someone said, DK here, I was just going to find their name, target them, and throw the rose petals anyway.
1115603	1116403	That was the plan.
1116983	1118004	Manny's like 10 gold.
1119184	1119964	That's stupid.
1120425	1121625	Don't do that crap.
1122226	1123286	Go out and earn your own damn money.
1124447	1127388	I can't help it if you keep buying every pet that pops up in the auction house.
1128889	1130209	It's addicting.
1131430	1132030	It kind of is.
1132050	1133391	I've actually spent lots of money on pets.
1133411	1138773	They should really have a series of hoarders where it's people collecting wild pets.
1138933	1139794	Like MMO hoarders?
1140054	1140994	Yeah, MMO hoarders.
1141054	1142175	I'm sure that exists somewhere.
1142535	1144037	DarkSakura.com
1162396	1164677	So she gave it to me because I think she already had it.
1165477	1168799	And then I'm also playing Bust a Move on my phone.
1169979	1170859	It's still super fun.
1171059	1171760	I really enjoy it.
1172280	1175281	And also I have to make an observation before we move on to Loki.
1176942	1180283	On the can of Arizona Diet Green Tea is a prostitute.
1182164	1182564	Seriously.
1182584	1183604	A taiyu.
1184685	1188686	You can tell because her obi is tied in the front and her hair is over elaborate.
1189778	1191519	That's what I get for studying weight.
1191539	1193479	You know whoever designed that had no idea.
1193559	1194840	They were just like, we just need to put something.
1194860	1195540	It looks like a geisha.
1195560	1198741	Yeah, we just need to put something Asian looking on this green tea.
1199021	1199982	But they've put a whore.
1201342	1206964	Granted, a very high class, talented, artistic whore.
1207324	1209985	This writing here probably says, I am horse butt.
1212206	1213666	But I mean, I just had to point it out.
1213746	1217928	I looked at the can and it dawned on me that it's a prostitute.
1218308	1226033	Isn't there some website of like bad Chinese text tattoos where you see people that got tattoos of Chinese writing and it says like really horrible things?
1226553	1229755	Of course, I don't know how much of that's legit and how much of it's fake, but eh.
1230655	1233617	All right, if that's it for DarkSakura's Gaming Week, Loki, how was your Gaming Week?
1234397	1235758	I played Skyrim.
1236098	1237419	Only a little bit though, actually.
1238799	1241460	I mainly this week was working on Grand Theft Auto modding.
1242361	1246543	And thank God finished what I was working on because it was making my brain explode.
1246943	1250845	Had to go back and learn or relearn some calculus stuff.
1251825	1262810	Mainly because during my actual calculus class, well actually pre-calculus because I never took calculus, I was too busy programming a Final Fantasy type game on my calculator.
1264321	1267924	Skyrim I'm 123 hours now into the game and um
1286463	1291145	I saw some things how Skyrim's won all these Game of the Year awards.
1291385	1293206	That game is so fucking broken.
1293887	1294867	It is just ridiculous.
1295147	1303311	I literally have to now keep my iPod with me and pull up the quests as I do them to look at the bugs section.
1303651	1306573	Known bugs for this quest so I don't run into them.
1306733	1314917	I ran into two yesterday that were not really game breaking but one of them would have been pretty fucking annoying if it
1315117	1317939	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1342697	1343257	Awesome!
1343677	1345518	It's not... It was one I hired.
1345698	1348198	It was a guy that was like, Hey, I'm the strongest guy here!
1348278	1349578	I'm like, you die!
1350038	1350338	Hold on.
1350699	1353439	You hired a companion so you could sacrifice them?
1353639	1353839	Yes.
1354259	1354999	That's awesome.
1355159	1355359	Yes.
1357660	1358720	So anyway, so I did that.
1358920	1368662	And when she appears, when the Daedra appears, it's just like... It does this weird screen effect thing that gets all blurry and purple.
1368682	1369462	Yeah.
1369642	1370262	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1397027	1398448	But no, it's not for the record.
1399309	1402471	The other one was when I was trying to become the Thane of Riften.
1403092	1408796	Apparently, if you visit your house, you have to purchase a house in Riften.
1409116	1414880	If you visit the house before you talk to the Jarl, you can never become the Thane of Riften.
1415140	1417342	It just breaks the whole quest.
1419042	1419402	Thanks.
1419903	1423526	Thanks for... There is no fucking way they bug tested this game.
1423906	1428050	I mean, most of the quests they seriously must not have tested at all.
1428410	1430872	Because there is no way that this would have been missed.
1430932	1434595	This is just like... Completely obvious stuff.
1434896	1437318	Hey, what would happen if I visited the house first?
1437458	1438839	Oh, it breaks the fucking quest.
1439420	1440981	Oh, no, we're not going to test for that.
1441822	1442362	It's good.
1442462	1444624	Yeah, it worked the first time I played through it.
1446125	1446366	Sigh.
1448470	1451472	Oh, and I cheated in... Well, not technically cheated.
1451692	1456115	I exploited a glitch in the game to level my character up to 81.5, which is the cap.
1456415	1457375	I capped all my skills at 100.
1457415	1460177	Wait, the cap is 81.5?
1460237	1460177	81.5.
1461798	1462158	Okay.
1462939	1468302	It just happens to be that's the amount of leveling you get when you have all your skills at 100.
1468342	1468302	81.5.
1470924	1471604	It didn't matter anyways.
1471644	1474246	I'm unkillable anyways, so whatever.
1474826	1475967	I just didn't want to have to...
1477468	1480510	I wanted all my perk points right away so I could figure out where I wanted them.
1481051	1484634	And I actually went back and started doing the actual main quest line.
1484774	1486275	And I gotta say, man, that thing is short.
1486876	1488377	It is a really short quest line.
1489458	1490219	Well, they usually are.
1490279	1492561	I mean, the game isn't really about the main quest.
1493622	1496304	Main quest is just kind of there to help you learn about the game.
1498007	1501308	I am looking forward to the 1.4 patch so I can finish Blood on the Ice.
1517117	1518958	Then I'm going to go kill everybody once I'm done with all that.
1519578	1521639	Everybody will die in a bloody rage.
1522759	1523980	I did see a video this week.
1524060	1524520	It was great.
1526060	1532923	Someone had changed their player model to one of the kids and then they had some spell on there that was dragon fire and it was hilarious.
1533043	1533403	I don't know.
1533483	1534563	It made me laugh.
1535824	1539125	It was a why kids can't be killed because they're actually dragons.
1541526	1542626	And Call of Duty.
1543146	1544327	Play more Call of Duty, of course.
1546425	1547046	All right, anything else?
1548406	1551168	I think that's it, yeah.
1551769	1552089	All right.
1553630	1554310	My gaming week.
1554731	1556912	See, I actually played quite a bit of new stuff this week.
1557333	1557853	A few games.
1558273	1560054	Soul Calibur V, quickly.
1560535	1564718	I literally played Soul Calibur V once, so I don't want to do a total review on it.
1565098	1567800	But I did spend about an hour with it the other night when I got it.
1568900	1570502	And I had a fairly good time.
1570522	1571542	The fighting's a lot of fun.
1571662	1572723	Creative character's great.
1572903	1573784	I love creative character.
1574404	1594926	and you know I was making some fun characters with that and story mode I noticed though right off the bat was was kind of weird because like you would have these full cut scenes and then like a storyboard like thing like you just see like a cartoon storyboard that transitions paint like it almost feels like it was like half done a little bit rushed and
1596167	1623609	I guess the bottom line I noticed after you know the short amount of time I did play the game is that although the core fighter game itself which is what you're paying the money for is good I feel like everything kind of on the shell outside of that was a little bit like rushed or wonky except well creative characters decent the only thing that I'm disappointed is that you know because it's a game that didn't really pre-order anything do you know how they have that pre-order character that really weird looking guy no because I didn't pre wait no I pre-ordered on Amazon but they didn't give me anything
1623976	1626297	Yeah, you're supposed to get this pre-order character.
1626337	1626958	It's this guy.
1627158	1628639	Maybe it's only a GameStop or whatever.
1628659	1634682	It's this guy in a top hat or something like that that has some really wacky moves.
1635463	1637224	But that would have been kind of fun to play as.
1637984	1638324	Interesting.
1638585	1639985	I think he may have been from 4.
1640206	1641967	Or the PSP one, maybe, right?
1642767	1644148	Yeah, he might have been the PSP one.
1644188	1646009	I wish the Lost Amel was in this one.
1646189	1646589	I made a male Ivy.
1646609	1647070	It's awesome.
1647090	1647951	What, like wearing Voldo's gear?
1661613	1666497	No, just wearing like a tight top and leather pants, you know.
1666677	1666937	Cool.
1667177	1667698	It's pretty cool.
1668418	1673122	So, yeah, Soul Calibur V. I'll tell you more about it when I have more time to play it.
1673302	1681808	Because I've been on my PlayStation 3 mostly been playing and sucked into Final Fantasy XIII too, which came out the same day.
1682348	1686451	And I've sunk a good at least seven hours, if not more, into that at this point.
1686551	1686752	So...
1687592	1691978	Yeah, I'm really enjoying Final Fantasy XIII too.
1692559	1700030	I'm really surprised at how divided the internet is on this because there's just some people that really just fucking hate Final Fantasy XIII.
1700511	1703074	And I really don't think this game is going to do much to sway your mind.
1703695	1705896	I mean, it's to the point, like, this is how divided it is.
1705976	1713839	You know that Final Fantasy XIII too is one of, like, what, less than 20 games to get a perfect 40 from Fumitsu Magazine ever, right?
1714259	1717701	And then, like, Edge, I think in the UK, gave it a 5 out of 10.
1718481	1723943	Like, that's quite a difference between a perfect pristine score from Fumitsu and a 5.
1724923	1725924	So, I mean, it's just...
1727064	1730647	It's because these fucking reviewers go into this shit very biased.
1731088	1735311	I mean, they're like judging games on shit that they never judged games on before.
1735331	1736992	It's like, this game is too linear.
1737152	1737393	Really?
1737793	1738013	Really?
1738113	1739995	All these other RPGs were too linear?
1740375	1741336	I just want to give the disclaimer.
1741776	1743057	I didn't read either of those reviews.
1743097	1743978	I'm going off Wikipedia.
1744298	1745719	I was just really surprised, though.
1745739	1756547	I was like, wow, this is really a diverse, you know, I would expect some, you know, not everybody's going to like everything, but just usually when it's all over the map like that, especially when Famitsu gave it such a high score, it just really surprised me.
1756567	1758768	But anyway, let's not talk about what other people thought of it.
1758788	1759649	Let's talk about what I thought of it.
1760990	1779221	of course what they're doing is they're trying to fix a lot of what people bitched about with XIII there's definitely not a linear sense in this game whatsoever now you have this interesting map, the Crux, that you can travel to all these different time zones
1779801	1780421	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1795509	1796750	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1815745	1823228	It's really like an entire season of Doctor Who scratched into a video game.
1823568	1826569	Or actually, in some ways, it reminds me of Quantum Leap.
1827890	1830411	Like, where are Noel and Sarah going to end up next?
1830471	1831071	Wah, wah, wah.
1831831	1841836	Um, but, uh, yeah, I mean, the, the, the really good thing about 13.2 is that the battle system is robust right off the bat.
1842436	1849520	And, you know, well, maybe you don't really get the monster character and the monster trapping and all that till episode two, but needless to say...
1850421	1860795	In 13, one of the big issues that people had was that it took forever before you even got to where you can flip paradigms and where the battle system becomes really interesting when you get the whole paradigm stuff, right?
1861215	1863518	For the first two chapters, you're pretty much just button mashing.
1863558	1864940	There's nothing else to do but auto-attack.
1865925	1890431	but in 13.2 that paradigm stuff starts battle one which is good so um towns are back random conversations side quests that people want you to do for them uh Chocolina who's now the shop who shows up everywhere I love Chocolina she's like a Vegas show girl meets a Chocobo it's great and um apparently there's like a casino later on with tons of mini games and all that stuff so
1892150	1893290	I'm really enjoying it.
1893330	1902296	The story, although it's kind of confusing, I hate to make myself sound stupid, but the story is really confusing.
1902816	1909580	But I gotta say, it is really cool to kind of see characters from 13 years later.
1910220	1913142	And they do some neat stuff with that, so it's cool.
1913542	1917985	The only thing about the characters that's a little weird is that your party only has two people.
1918566	1920227	And I don't know if that's ever gonna change.
1920547	1924510	I kinda think the whole game might be just the two people and the rotating monster.
1924810	1925971	That might turn some people off.
1926651	1927011	I don't know.
1927352	1929153	I think there's other stuff through DLC.
1929213	1931194	I think you might be able to get more characters as DLC.
1931835	1933155	That's a little bit...
1934136	1941598	Side Eye and Judging Square for jumping on that bandwagon because I really don't like when so much stuff is behind DLC.
1942258	1947739	You know, it's kind of like now games are really costing $90 because it's $60 for what you would.
1947759	1951720	You know, a lot of that costume shit is paid to unlock content.
1952100	1952960	Oh, of course it is.
1953540	1954100	Of course it is.
1954661	1956301	There's nothing to download right now.
1957161	1982167	but I'm told that a bunch of zone areas are unlocked through DLC and I heard that Lightning and a General from the first game are supposed to be DLC at some point so I have to judge Square a little bit for hopping on that bad wagon you know especially when the series is a little bit vulnerable right now I think that especially when your game only has two characters in it that's a little bit...
1983607	1991433	I'm judging you, but at least the game that you get for the money you pay for it is a robust experience.
1991533	1994196	And I can think of far worse games to blow $60 on.
1994496	1995957	I don't think this game is worthy of a 5.
1996597	2000981	I don't know if it's a perfect 40, but it's really good.
2002731	2003351	But not perfect.
2004312	2006293	So that's what I think about Final Fantasy XIII too.
2007134	2009335	I think if you like XIII, play it.
2009956	2015480	And don't let that hurdle of, but I never beat XIII, stop you.
2015580	2024365	Because yes, the game will tell you what happened at the end of XIII, and you can even go through a mode that just, like it'll just walk you through the story of Final Fantasy XIII.
2024726	2027668	Like, albeit it's kind of like narrated text, but you get the idea.
2028048	2032591	I mean, I didn't beat XIII, and I don't feel like it was really ruined for me.
2033011	2035612	Yes, I will know what happens right at the end of 13.
2036713	2039634	But, you know, there's still a lot of stuff that it takes to get there.
2040294	2040554	You know?
2040774	2044695	So it's like, just knowing the ending, I don't think it's going to totally ruin 13 for me.
2044916	2048477	Because I will have to go back and... Because I was on like chapter 12 when I stopped.
2048497	2049497	I got a long way through it.
2050558	2052258	But yeah, 13.2 is worth your time.
2053859	2055600	One other game I played this week.
2056180	2056440	So...
2058106	2059007	Tangent for a minute.
2059167	2063631	Orange Lounge Radio started, of course, for many years.
2063671	2068195	For about, what, four years, we were a show exclusively about music games.
2068675	2072539	Because DarkSakura, Loki, and myself all met playing DDR at the local arcade.
2073139	2083949	And the original concept behind the show was, let's make this kind of like show about what we enjoy doing at the arcades every Wednesday or Thursday night, whatever night it was we were going back then.
2084709	2110568	and you know we also always used to go to Brookfield's the diner afterwards and kind of talk shit about games it was kind of like let's let's do that as like our show um so for a long time it was about music games we talked about DDR and the new songs are coming out in DDR we used to talk about guitar freaks and drum media and keyboard media para para paradise all these games that Konami did and when they first came out I think we were right on right I think we changed formats right around the time Guitar Hero was breaking and all that stuff um
2112009	2127181	So, the bottom line is, we switched from doing a music game only show to a gaming show because there wasn't a lot of stuff in the music game world to talk about anymore, which was ironic because then about a year after we switched, Rock Band and Guitar Hero 2 and all that just made it huge.
2127782	2131465	But, you know, we felt like there was more we could do talking about regular games.
2132205	2140395	I haven't been following the music gaming scene as closely since then, but I do kind of like, you know, I like to, I check Bomani style once in a while.
2140435	2146261	I checked DDR Freak when that was still running, you know, and I would just kind of like keep, I'd like to keep tabs on the music game scene.
2146642	2151808	But I gotta say, I haven't really, really enjoyed a Bomani game in a long time.
2152228	2152648	I haven't.
2153249	2156570	I haven't really cared for a lot of the music in the newer Beatmania 2DXs.
2157751	2161353	I didn't think Jubeat was all that, or Ubeat, or whatever they call that game.
2162353	2165115	I didn't think, what else has come out since then?
2165395	2170798	Poppin' Music, you know, the one they tried here on the Xbox was absolutely awful.
2171258	2172819	The Wii one was really weird.
2173799	2176681	So I can't say I've really, really, truly enjoyed a Bomani game.
2177541	2206480	until I think this week I downloaded a game on Xbox Live that's out called Rhythm Party and I have to say it's actually pretty good now it's not perfect there are some things wrong with it but all things considered Rhythm Party is kind of the game that Dance Masters the Kinect game that came out last year on Xbox 360 that was like Konami's first like let's put a Bomani game with Kinect
2207926	2211447	Rhythm Party is the game that Dance Masters should have been, I really think.
2211727	2220169	Ironically enough, Dance Masters, or Dance Evolution as it's called in Japan, is an arcade game, or will become an arcade game very soon.
2220329	2220629	Really?
2220769	2222869	But Rhythm Party should, okay?
2222889	2223029	Yeah.
2223049	2224789	Okay, here's the thing about Rhythm Party.
2227090	2227410	Oh, sorry.
2228730	2231451	Konami is setting this game up to fail, I really think.
2231771	2233431	I kind of think this is just coming out.
2233871	2236572	I went to Bomani Style to see what they were saying about it,
2237692	2238793	There's nothing on it.
2239673	2244015	I put it on Twitter, like Rhythm Party, and nobody's talking about it.
2244075	2245675	I saw one Major Nelson tweet.
2246055	2252378	The only way I knew about this game was from following Naoki Midea on Facebook, who is, of course, one of the big guys.
2252598	2253278	And we mentioned it.
2253318	2256540	Remember, we mentioned it on the show last week, because we were like, oh, Naoki's teasing this game.
2257220	2259721	And I remembered that, and so I'm like, oh, I'll download it and check it out.
2260021	2265143	And when I fired it up, I noticed that the menu music was the music from Dance Dance Revolution 5th Mix.
2265583	2267164	and I was like, oh, I loved Fifth Mix.
2267204	2267905	I love this music.
2267945	2268585	This is awesome.
2269046	2271988	And then I went into the game and I was kind of like looking through the songs.
2272048	2276912	I'm like, okay, well, even though it's only 10 songs, this is a decent mix of songs.
2276992	2280975	Like there's more stuff that's interesting to me here than there was in all of Dance Masters.
2282516	2285959	So, and then I fired up the game and played it for a little bit.
2285979	2287901	So let me tell you where this game's a little bit different.
2288582	2295969	It's not really like Dance Masters or Dance Central at all because you're not trying to mimic a pre-choreographed dance.
2296489	2300212	It's actually a lot more like DDR or really Samba de Amigo.
2300953	2301413	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2319429	2322750	But you also get extra points as you freestyle.
2323471	2325492	If you jump, you get extra points.
2325552	2326772	If you turn, you get extra points.
2327152	2334595	If you hit balls with hands you're not supposed to, like you do crossovers and stuff, you get extra points.
2334635	2336496	If you do poses and stuff, you get extra points.
2336776	2343559	So there's really this emphasis on kind of making your own dance out of the balls that fly in out of that kind of pattern.
2344639	2351624	It was entertaining, especially for somebody that really liked DDR, that was all about timing and hitting the arrows.
2351984	2357068	This is truly a Kinect version of DDR, which I don't think Dance Masters was.
2357128	2361871	Dance Masters, unfortunately, felt like Dance Central did this a little better.
2362211	2365113	Better music, easier to understand the choreography.
2365654	2373599	Whereas I think this is now a true, okay, it's not about the choreography, it's about the more music timing and doing all this.
2374240	2386999	So, yeah, the song list, there's only 10 songs, which is a little eh, because two of them feature Vanilla Ice, but there are some good choices in there, Born This Way, Every Little Step, YMCA
2390316	2395358	Every song, this is what really reminded me of old DDR.
2396099	2405544	Every song has its own unique background, its own unique video, and its own unique kind of thing that your character does or turns into.
2405584	2406545	Let me explain what I mean.
2407105	2412788	When you're playing Born This Way by Lady Gaga, if you do really well, you suddenly turn into this electric peacock.
2412888	2414149	I don't even know how to explain it.
2414469	2416670	But the cool thing is, it's still you.
2416810	2418151	You look like a human pipe organ.
2418351	2418711	YMCA
2448671	2451935	Everything I used to really like about the DDR games is kind of in this game.
2452815	2459142	But what I really feel like I'm playing here is the demo.
2460754	2462996	for a full retail game.
2463117	2464658	Where's the rest of the songs?
2465259	2466400	Where's multiplayer?
2466500	2467821	Where's anything?
2468883	2474368	I really feel like they're selling a demo for what could potentially be a really good retail game.
2474729	2477612	But I have this bad feeling because nobody knows about it.
2477992	2481916	I really feel like Konami just kind of...
2483160	2485141	Okay Naoki, we know you have this idea.
2485161	2486621	Why don't you throw something together?
2486721	2494444	And like, you know, they threw together the demo and, you know, Konami was just like, eh, let's just put it out on Xbox Live and see if it sticks.
2495164	2498766	And I just have this really bad feeling it's not gonna.
2499066	2500907	There's room for the game to support DLC.
2502768	2509858	I don't know if I trust Konami to handle the DLC appropriately based on other games where two songs ever come out as DLC.
2510559	2516867	I'm going to just cross my fingers and really hope that they get some licensed songs and they get some good stuff in there to really round out the game.
2519235	2520535	Rhythm Party is really not bad.
2542561	2547445	and I'll be really bummed if it doesn't go anywhere other than this because it's not that bad.
2547785	2552649	I know, Jamie, you just only got to watch me play it a little bit but I think you kind of went into it going, really?
2552729	2553370	Rhythm party?
2553450	2555592	But you kind of seemed like you were like, oh, this is cute, right?
2556172	2556352	Yeah.
2557213	2559315	I want... Actually, I do want...
2560175	2562496	Loki, you've always been a vocal critic of Konami.
2562516	2564937	I know you haven't really played it, but you saw me doing it for a little bit.
2565617	2566698	It looked okay.
2566898	2569419	But when I saw them announcing this, I'm like, oh, that's going to suck.
2570119	2571559	I don't even want to look at it.
2571779	2573120	Right?
2573340	2575341	And it was just all right.
2576361	2581023	I remember my snarky comment on it was like, oh, yeah.
2581043	2582183	I remember what it was.
2582263	2583124	It was something about...
2585487	2588348	I don't know what happened behind the scenes, but it is worth your time to check out.
2588368	2593110	Well, the way they may be treating it is like a retail game where they're gonna...
2613217	2614017	and I'll see you next time.
2633923	2639947	slap together a 10-pack of old DDR classics.
2640768	2647652	I realize if you're doing custom backgrounds for everything, maybe that takes a little more time and art and so forth, but they could get away with fudging it a little bit.
2648013	2649814	The old DDR games recycled a few things here and there.
2650134	2657919	Recycle some of the art assets and just put out 10 other DDR songs for free, and then this game will have a really enhanced value.
2658100	2658600	I think it will.
2658920	2663661	and then put some, like, if you get some decent licenses, like, they license Gaga.
2663961	2666262	Somebody paid for that, like, you know?
2666602	2673644	But unfortunately, it's one modern song and then two retro classics with Bobby Blackwolf, or Bobby Blackwolf.
2674824	2677585	Bobby Blackwolf, uh, a.k.a.
2677645	2678365	Vanilla Ice.
2679946	2681426	I actually like the Vanilla Ice song.
2682287	2684547	Bobby Brown, Bobby!
2685547	2685687	And...
2688127	2689868	That clip's going to end up on his show at some point.
2689908	2690148	Watch.
2690629	2694131	Bobby Brown and Village People were like the retro bigs.
2694151	2694732	That's really it.
2695412	2697714	Vanilla Ice, retro yet new.
2698214	2698514	You know what?
2698954	2700816	The songs, they're not terrible.
2701336	2702097	They're not terrible.
2703618	2711623	They're not like, I'm going to go run out and buy the CD tomorrow, but they're better than most of the stuff from Dance Masters, which was very unremarkable.
2713208	2714911	Dance Masters was just frustrating.
2714951	2719759	And the fact that they're making an arcade game now, it's just, there's no cues whatsoever to what to do.
2720079	2723725	Yeah, and I understand that, you know, para games and stuff like that,
2725644	2727505	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2748126	2749947	How am I going to follow this?
2750188	2755492	The only reason I was ever able to do anything good at Dance Masters was that I knew the Parapara routines.
2755632	2758194	There's really only two Parapara songs in that whole game.
2758694	2759195	There really are.
2759355	2760015	There's five.
2760856	2761857	No, there's two.
2761997	2765980	There's Night of Fire.
2767201	2768442	I thought there were two others.
2768642	2771424	I thought that they did Like a Virgin.
2771444	2772765	I thought Like a Virgin was in there.
2773086	2774226	No, I don't think so.
2775688	2776068	But anyway...
2777403	2777803	Whatever.
2778484	2789208	Anyway, I've spent a lot of time talking about that song, or talking about that game, but, you know, just as I've been a fan of music games for so, so long, I was just really surprised at what an unremarkable launch this game has had.
2789589	2791430	But I think it's worth your attention, I really do.
2791510	2797913	And if anybody from Konami, haha, is listening, you might want to consider making Rhythm Party the arcade game, because I think, but...
2799053	2800154	Maybe it needs a better name.
2801114	2802735	I don't think Rhythm Party is the best name.
2802915	2804136	You know what they're calling it in Japan?
2804596	2805517	Boom Boom Dance.
2806758	2807498	That's a better name.
2808379	2809900	But there's no Boom Boom Dollar in it.
2810680	2813122	And you know why I bet they didn't call it that here?
2813682	2814663	Because of Boom Boom Rocket.
2815003	2817144	Remember Boom Boom Rocket from EA?
2818725	2820086	God, that was about five years ago now.
2820366	2823368	That was an old-ass one with little arrows that would come up and you'd do the fireworks.
2824469	2824789	And that was...
2825563	2827204	I'm looking on here.
2827224	2830287	It says that there's an achievement for playing three Parapara genre songs.
2831547	2834890	Well, maybe there's other songs that weren't in Parapara Paradise.
2835090	2836991	I think that's what it was.
2837351	2841174	There are songs that I knew, but they weren't in Parapara Paradise.
2841765	2842706	Alright, I believe you.
2843587	2845208	Dance Masters wasn't, you know.
2845869	2846209	But anyway.
2847130	2848551	Okay, so that's it for my gaming week.
2849012	2849592	I've talked plenty.
2850253	2852034	So, housekeeping, real quick.
2852074	2852915	Follow us on Facebook.
2852935	2855497	Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio or of course there's Twitter.
2855898	2858200	Twitter.com slash OLR.
2859000	2861162	Let's get into some news.
2861282	2862864	And Loki's going to start us off tonight.
2862884	2865326	You got a lot of stuff about one particular company, right?
2866152	2878226	And also, I was going to say, the song was for Dance Masters, so Night of Fire was one of them, Yesterday was the other Para song, and...
2881613	2886357	I don't know, it might have been one of these other... There's a lot of songs I don't recognize.
2886837	2889440	Maybe Can't Stop Falling in Love Super Hero version?
2889640	2890741	Because that did have a para.
2891121	2893003	Oh, that was in para.
2893123	2894884	Okay, that was a para para song.
2895044	2895805	I bet that's it then.
2897687	2898988	Mystery solved!
2899368	2900069	Alright, fair enough.
2900749	2903952	If only it was that easy for companies to do well.
2904472	2908896	THQ, on the other hand, has been having a rough... A boom boom fire of their own.
2911138	2911638	Thanks for watching!
2929149	2933392	First off, THQ received a stock delisting notice.
2934213	2943759	And they basically have 180 calendar days until July 23rd to make the stock regain compliance for 10 consecutive business days.
2944259	2949903	If the company can't comply, then they get taken off the stock market, basically.
2950764	2955847	And, of course, their stock has fallen quite a bit down to about $0.70 a share.
2956988	2957628	So that's not good.
2959250	2964196	also the CEO they've taken a 50% pay cut
2966488	2970650	And also the board of directors, they've taken pay cuts as well.
2971770	2973691	Meaning $10 million as opposed to $20.
2973811	2975652	We're going to see layoffs.
2975812	2976832	No, no, no.
2978193	2981794	Actually, the CEO doesn't make millions of dollars.
2982274	2984175	He does make six figures.
2984575	2986036	He dropped his salary from $718,500 a year to $359,250 a year.
2993393	2995875	How's he gonna scrape by is what I want to know, man.
2995895	2997956	That's some tough stuff right there.
2999697	3001058	God, that's just disgusting.
3002859	3010364	And then, of course, you know, some of the other, you know, they've cut from three times the highest bonus to, was it the...
3011164	3012885	Just as high as bonus ever.
3013326	3019791	At least he wasn't forced to take the, you know, Apple CEO at Steve Jobs used to get a dollar and then a bunch of stock options.
3020391	3022953	At least this guy wasn't forced to take stock.
3023154	3028237	The board of directors, they've decided to take 50% less cash compensation for a year.
3029799	3029899	Um...
3031821	3039823	Also, unfortunately, with all these cuts and delisting threats come layoffs.
3039843	3047184	240 people were set to be laid off, and it would be, I guess, across nine months.
3048425	3052185	They said it should be, let's see here.
3052225	3054306	Enough time to finish whatever game they were working on.
3054946	3055086	Yeah.
3057026	3060407	I don't believe 240 is the correct number.
3060587	3061528	It's up to 240.
3061588	3066149	I want to say it was 172 or something like that is what it's supposed to be.
3068430	3075392	They said that this isn't anything that they were trying to hide, that the cuts were described in their statement last week.
3076392	3078215	and that no studios are a part of this.
3078295	3081379	It's administration and publishing offices worldwide.
3082380	3084984	And, you know, also...
3088425	3093908	do the varying employment guidelines around the world and internal finance considerations.
3094388	3103111	The restructuring will be completed by September 30, 2012, but most affected employees have already been notified.
3105212	3112515	And then, on top of all that, they've revealed that they've lost $56 million in quarter three, which...
3119062	3123666	That would, let's see, quarter ending in December 31st, 2011.
3123746	3125708	I'm kind of surprised that they lost a lot of money.
3125728	3143185	I guess they were just in the hole so much that, you know, even though Saints Row III and WWE 12 did good, or well, I should say, it just wasn't enough to kind of make up for the slump in sales.
3143305	3145987	And they actually had a pretty good quarter.
3146027	3151752	I mean, I think we started off with, I don't remember if Warhammer, no, I don't think Warhammer was in that quarter.
3151772	3152913	I think that was Q2.
3153034	3161421	But anyways, regardless of that, one other game did come out in quarter three for them, and that would have been UDraw, and they're not putting out any more of those.
3162370	3169640	All of this sad trombone stuff for THQ, is it all because of Udraw?
3169700	3171642	I don't think they could have invested.
3171662	3173965	Could One Peripheral bring down a company like that?
3174025	3175027	No, no.
3175087	3178011	Or is it because their kiddie games are not doing too well either?
3178291	3204395	but their kiddie games not doing well I don't think is a big deal because even this year they focused more on well not entirely more so on less on kiddie games more on their core franchises however though they did have a few games come out that were kind of kiddie that did not do well like for example they had Kung Fu Panda 2 which kind of bombed
3205015	3226642	and you know what, it really is kind of their fault though, it bombed, I mean, let's see, they had on the PS3, which no one really buys kids games on the PS3, the Xbox 360 version was Kinect required, the Wii version was UDraw required, Wii right there, that is a problem, see, if they had it, you know, kind of, that is a prime audience right there, and you're really limiting it to people that buy your fucking tablet, which no one did...
3228459	3229939	I mean, it's just kind of annoying.
3230239	3238461	DungeonBuster in our chatroom at chat.orangesponsorator.com says, Saints Row III and WWE 12 did well, but U-Draw crapped all over the good news for both games.
3238521	3242242	It's just, it's really shocking to me, like, that U-Draw's... It wasn't, I don't think it was that.
3242362	3250664	I don't think that that had a big... But, I mean, U-Draw was a huge investment for them, and I mean, nobody bought it.
3251224	3257366	Like, the one on the Wii that came out, what, a year before, a couple years ago, that one got bought.
3257766	3260927	But didn't they try to put that UDraw tablet on the PS3?
3261608	3262428	It was on PS3 and 360.
3262528	3263749	That was a huge mistake.
3264129	3265009	That was a huge mistake.
3265249	3265989	Yeah, it came out.
3266069	3269010	That was what they were trying to debut, and they were trying to debut some other games.
3269110	3273192	I would argue, literally, no one bought it on the PlayStation 3.
3275060	3276541	I'd say probably close to no one bought it.
3277361	3278862	Yeah, obviously, that's what I really mean.
3280443	3287207	But then also, you know, they had the Penguins of Madagascar game and stuff like that that came out that no one gave a shit about.
3288167	3297192	Is it maybe because if you tie into movies that aren't so successful at the box office, like, wasn't that... What Penguin movie was that?
3299613	3300534	Penguins of Madagascar.
3300734	3303015	It's all the DreamWorks properties is what they had.
3303955	3307457	They had a Spongebob game that no one gave a shit about that came out.
3308698	3311319	It's just that stuff doesn't do well anymore.
3311799	3317142	I mean, kind of it's run its course and no one really cared about Puss in Boots the game.
3317202	3319743	I mean, it's just like, eh, whatever, you know.
3320884	3322505	Or the Penguins of Madagascar game.
3322545	3322805	I mean...
3323385	3324886	Hey, we're gonna get...
3350100	3351486	We're going to enter in this market too.
3351547	3353455	It seems like they're doing well with that U-Draw.
3353676	3354640	We're going to put ours out.
3356690	3357030	Tanked.
3357330	3360911	Does that mean we could expect something really awful to come to Ubisoft soon?
3360951	3363092	Or do you think they had enough to keep them above water?
3363112	3364772	I don't think they're going to release anything else for it.
3364792	3369913	Luckily, they still have Assassin's Creed and enough things to kind of... Oh, and they actually do quite a bit.
3370293	3370793	I know, I know.
3370814	3374034	A lot less with kid stuff recently, but they do quite a bit.
3375175	3379496	Didn't Rocksmith do a little better than folks thought for a really niche thing?
3379716	3382236	Because I know people on Facebook that are playing it.
3382256	3384717	I would not have expected to be playing any video games at all.
3384997	3386118	I think it did okay.
3386899	3389100	I mean, it hasn't really been a huge hit.
3389521	3396807	It did better than, what was it, Six Strings, Rise of the Six Strings.
3396907	3399129	Oh, yeah, that one kind of disappeared, didn't it?
3399469	3400150	Yeah.
3401951	3402892	Yeah, that wasn't very good.
3406023	3407223	That sounds dreadful.
3407664	3412385	Well, that's too bad for THQ.
3412565	3414445	I hope it doesn't impact Saints Row IV.
3414565	3415866	Oh, no.
3416346	3416666	It won't.
3417306	3418986	I'm sure they're going to do well.
3419266	3423668	This year, kicking off things, they've got UFC 3, which will do well for them.
3423728	3424848	That's in a couple weeks.
3425628	3450856	they're going to have Darksiders 2 coming I think in May-ish then of course they've got the South Park RPG game coming out later this year there'll be another WWE game, WW13 I'm sure there's going to be some other big franchises that they're going to have um
3452236	3455718	I don't think Saints Row the 4th would be coming out anytime soon.
3455978	3457900	I would hope not.
3458080	3468926	I mean, I think it's too soon for something like that, but they're going to have DLC for the 3rd coming out, and I think that sold well for them, but I wouldn't worry about THQ.
3468946	3469587	They're going to be fine.
3471028	3471328	All right.
3471877	3482825	But I would say, you know, that it really sucks that Nintendo didn't embrace the whole UDraw tablet, but you kind of see why they didn't because of the direction that they went.
3482845	3485287	Well, now, yeah, now with the Wii U, they, it's...
3494053	3500177	or they're going to hold on to it for a little longer and make a Mario Paint game for the Wii U. That's probably more like it.
3501097	3509782	All right, well, speaking of the Wii U, Team Ninja has commented on the Wii U, talking about it, saying that it's pretty easy to develop for.
3510822	3525653	This is from an interview with Nintendo Gamer Magazine where some of the folks from Teen Ninja said that they're finding it very similar to develop for Wii U as for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, which is no surprise if it's true what we've heard about the hardware in the past.
3525733	3529616	It's very similar to just kind of an overdrived Xbox, basically.
3530017	3531238	That's what Nintendo Wii U is supposed to be.
3532498	3535461	They also said that the Wii U hardware keeps changing.
3536381	3542787	That echoes statements that were made by Yoshinori Ono from Capcom last week.
3543807	3547871	Apparently said something very similar, that the Wii U keeps changing some of the hardware.
3549752	3554536	They're asking these developers from Teen Ninja what they want from the hardware and for feedback.
3555257	3557759	They keep listening, making changes and so forth.
3557779	3559200	The hardware keeps changing.
3559560	3562763	What we don't know is what is changing about the hardware.
3563263	3571510	Now my thought is, I wouldn't take the hardware is changing to mean suddenly this system is not going to have the tablet or any of that stuff.
3571550	3572972	That's here to stay.
3573352	3575093	Like that isn't going anywhere, right?
3575213	3578696	I think they're either... They're too well, they've gone all in on that.
3578877	3584201	So after last year's E3, they can't suddenly come out and say, well, we decided to scrap the tablet, ha ha.
3584622	3585082	You know, right?
3586667	3588450	They're just changing what's inside.
3588490	3590013	Because they don't fucking know.
3590293	3597886	They're like, well, we've got this box that represents... Just imagine, if you will, a console that will do amazing things.
3599480	3601161	Imagine it because we don't have one yet.
3601301	3603422	It's just this box that's sitting here.
3604442	3609144	Well, it's about time to commit because in a couple months they're going to have to show that to the world.
3609664	3613286	If they want to get that thing out this year, it's got to be at E3 and it's got to be good.
3615207	3615847	It better be.
3616267	3616907	I'm telling you.
3618468	3623330	Although if Team Ninja is developing for this, that means that you know where the next Dead or Alive game is going to show up.
3623806	3624746	No, I think it's Ninja Gaiden.
3624766	3626247	They already said they were going to have a Ninja Gaiden.
3626267	3627427	Oh, that's right.
3627547	3627887	They did.
3628047	3629508	It was basically a port of Ninja Gaiden 3.
3630088	3632109	And Team Ninja and Nintendo have a little history.
3632129	3637510	Team Ninja did the Metroid Other M game, which, although it didn't sell very well, it wasn't a bad game by any means.
3637530	3638111	It was pretty neat.
3638371	3638911	Yeah.
3641011	3641392	Interesting.
3644968	3647029	I hope they all fuck it up, I'm just saying.
3647089	3659214	I mean, I think I'm hopeful that it'll be a good system, but... Just say the HG Mario and HZ Zelda game will be out this Christmas and it'll print money.
3659474	3659854	It will.
3660414	3661295	Keep our fingers crossed.
3661335	3665216	Nintendo just has to put those key franchises on it and that's really what's gonna drive the system.
3665596	3667397	And if you doubt what I'm saying...
3668497	3669318	3DS.
3670258	3678182	That thing did not start selling until they put the Zelda remake on it and then sold a little bit and then when they put Mario Kart 7 and 3D Land on it, boom!
3678322	3679202	Now it's selling tons.
3679923	3680963	And when they dropped the price.
3681583	3682184	Oh yeah, that too.
3683404	3683844	That helped.
3683904	3685085	That did have a little bit to do with it.
3687116	3690339	But well, then the price point is certainly important for the Wii U as well.
3690399	3692561	You know, if they get up on stage and say, Wii U is $599 US dollars.
3692581	3692561	$599.
3692601	3693181	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
3693221	3693502	Ridge Racer.
3693522	3693502	$299.
3693542	3694282	It's got to be $299, right?
3694302	3694763	No higher than $299.
3694803	3696224	It can't be higher than $299.
3696264	3696364	Yeah.
3696384	3696664	I don't know.
3711269	3712149	You don't even want it to be $2.99.
3712369	3714270	I don't even see it being $2.99.
3715070	3717891	I mean, I don't know.
3719131	3719551	We'll see.
3719652	3722653	I mean, by the time we get there, I mean, the other consoles could be lower.
3724893	3729515	I'm going to be sitting back and watching what happens because...
3731431	3732192	I don't know.
3732212	3735054	Why do they just say the games will only be $40 as opposed to $60?
3735574	3736775	That would go a long way.
3736795	3738756	That would go a very long way.
3739877	3740657	All right, anyhow.
3741858	3750244	Breakman in our chatroom at chat.orangelandreda.com says, I hope they change the name from Wii U to something else that would be easier for me to make penis jokes for it.
3750284	3753046	Well, there was some rumors last week that they are going to change the name.
3753466	3756168	I don't know how much that will, you know,
3758007	3764469	RDG Singenar Chatroom says, Anyway, it's probably three GameCubes duct taped together.
3765309	3769050	Alright, so you were curious on Rocksmith sales.
3769310	3770151	Yeah.
3771251	3772531	350,000 copies in the US on 360.
3773792	3778093	Basically a total of 610,000 copies.
3778233	3784395	That's pretty... For what's essentially a really niche title, I really consider that that's pretty darn good.
3785075	3785415	I think.
3786015	3786236	Yeah.
3786576	3786756	So...
3787916	3791519	Alright, anyhow, let's move on.
3792059	3792599	DarkSakura.
3793780	3801626	Well, in other news, there is a proposition to put a 1% tax on violent video games.
3802466	3803347	I know, stupid.
3804067	3807970	This is actually coming from Oklahoma, which, it's Oklahoma.
3809691	3810512	Oklahoma wins.
3812466	3833482	Anyway, it was introduced by State Representative William Forkiller Great name, Forkiller F-O-U-R-K-I-L-L-E-R That any title that's rated teen, mature, and adult only would fall under that spectrum That's the game that Team Ninja is making for the Wii U actually is Forkiller, go figure But you know what else that would include?
3834503	3837546	Dance Central 2 And Final Fantasy XIII 2
3840703	3845807	Oh, because those games are rated T for teen because of, um, what, language and all that stuff, right?
3845867	3846367	I guess.
3847488	3850250	Um, but he wants to donate- Somebody said hell in 13.2.
3850590	3851851	I was like, oh, no, she didn't.
3852291	3856474	But the, um, well, what about all the crap they said in 7?
3856514	3861717	Yeah, Barret said shit and- Well, anyway- Has anyone ever dropped the F-bomb in a Final Fantasy game?
3861857	3862738	Final Fantasy fuck?
3864559	3865139	Can I finish?
3865660	3865820	No.
3866600	3866881	Okay.
3868317	3881201	Anyway, half of the revenues would go to donate the Childhood Outdoor Education Revolving Fund, which is basically making kids get outside and play.
3882802	3886143	And the other half is the Bully Prevention Revolving Fund.
3889204	3895186	It's got a good heart behind it, but I think that it's...
3899299	3900841	Well, okay, actually here's a good quote on here.
3901261	3906227	From the senior designer of Mass Effect 3, that's Manvir Hare, I guess.
3906968	3909832	Oklahoma proposes a 1% tax on violent games.
3910132	3914738	Can I propose a 1% tax on stupid fucking ideas that are also unconstitutional?
3915942	3917942	Yeah, I mean, this is going to be a losing battle.
3918202	3919503	We've already seen this stuff.
3919863	3924944	You heard us go off last week on the whole California has to pay the ESA of the Supreme Court thing.
3925324	3926644	And I do get what you're saying.
3926704	3931685	I think it is like, you know, at the core of it, it's nice that he's trying to do something for charity, I guess.
3932285	3933485	But this just speaks clearly.
3933505	3935365	No one's asking him to do anything for charity.
3935545	3936286	Well, yeah, it's that.
3936566	3941286	And if you really want to tax violence, put a 1% tax on guns.
3941987	3944607	You know, put it on something that's across the board.
3944927	3947130	I have to say this.
3948231	3954538	To say that guns cause violence is the same thing that says pencils cause bad spelling.
3954638	3956480	Then put a 1% tax on pencils.
3956901	3959223	Put the tax on a gun license.
3959924	3960664	Okay, fine.
3961005	3963446	But the thing is, at least that's kind of constant.
3964326	3970549	But to put a 1% tax on a subset of video games strikes me as very odd.
3970749	3973350	Would you put a 1% tax on R-rated movies?
3974011	3977312	Would you put a 1% tax on... Well, no, because we're afraid of the MPAA.
3977652	3981614	Would you put a tax on 1% books that are not for young adults or children?
3981955	3989038	Like, would you put a 1% tax on the, you know, I don't know, entire fiction section of Barnes & Noble?
3989318	3991939	We're going to put a 1% tax on contraceptives.
3991979	3996100	Would you put a 1% tax on parental advisory labels on CDs?
3996960	3997500	I mean, no.
3997620	4000681	This is all – it's ridiculous in practice.
4000761	4009164	It's just – and it's somebody who – that just speaks – it's a big surprise, a politician who doesn't get video games, but it just really speaks to somebody.
4009204	4009424	And then –
4010484	4011065	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
4025521	4043147	he's basically trying to do the same thing that all these other places have done to curtail the sale of these video games by making them more expensive by putting a tax on it and sugarcoating it with the oh but this is going to do all this good if this goes by he's trying to trick the gullible which unfortunately most of the public is sorry
4044447	4063116	and you know those violent video games they pack on the pounds I'm telling you if I'm not like you know killing people in a game I'm just losing weight because um yeah I don't understand the argument that you know putting attacks on teen rated and up games is gonna somehow get kids to be slimmer
4065637	4072724	I think you actually missed what I said about that.
4073825	4081231	He said that the proceeds were going to be in half donated to services that get children to go outside and exercise.
4082202	4083904	So that's the thing.
4083964	4091214	It's kind of like it's indirectly for the children because I'm tying this nice little charity and all the money is going to go to good.
4091354	4093437	Why don't you tax them like 500%?
4093557	4096842	Then they can't afford the games and they'll go out and exercise.
4096862	4098184	And then the charities will get a ton of money.
4098844	4103567	I mean, I don't understand, why do we need a program to get people to go outside?
4103587	4105107	I mean, is it that bad?
4105288	4106728	Why don't parents do their fucking job?
4107429	4107909	End of story.
4108809	4109990	Parents, do your job.
4110390	4111891	Your kids are fat, send them outside.
4112211	4112571	The end.
4112892	4114973	You know what I did when I was bored when I was a kid?
4115493	4116494	And I had a Nintendo?
4117054	4117894	I went and rode my bike.
4118655	4119055	Uphill.
4119355	4119715	Twice.
4120115	4120596	In the snow?
4120976	4121136	No.
4121356	4122917	We didn't have snow in Alabama, what are you talking about?
4123717	4124458	In the swamp!
4124958	4126039	Which is worse than the snow.
4126279	4130543	Or even better, I mean, like, stop feeding your kids their sugary foods or whatever.
4130863	4132244	You know, get them to go outside.
4132284	4132924	I mean, come on.
4133405	4136407	There's a lot of contributing factors for people getting overweight.
4136447	4138288	It's not because you're just playing video games.
4138849	4142031	It's because you're eating like shit and you're sitting around doing nothing.
4142191	4143012	You know what, kids?
4143172	4146214	If you want to lose weight, you just need to have more unprotected sex.
4147655	4148316	Sexercise.
4149617	4150518	Sexercise.
4153345	4154326	DarkSakura's left the room
4176715	4186562	But we were just talking about... So, let's talk a little bit about our favorite topic, at least it has been the last few weeks.
4187082	4191985	And that is, quote, you know, online passes.
4192445	4203130	and I kind of wonder if they don't understand what the online pass thing means because they're putting it on games that don't have online portions to them.
4203210	4207452	They're not putting it on games that have online portions to them.
4207512	4208932	They're not locking people out.
4209773	4210613	I just don't understand.
4211173	4217177	So first off, SSX, a big extreme sports game coming out from EA.
4217457	4218438	It's going to have an online pass.
4218498	4221020	Not a big surprise because they have a big online portion of it.
4221480	4229566	What's kind of neat about it, though, is that the online pass, if you do not have it, will not lock people out of playing multiplayer.
4229946	4234589	You just won't get any of the in-game credits used to unlock content while playing multiplayer.
4236250	4236891	So that's kind of cool.
4237091	4239132	You can at least play with your friends still if you have it used.
4239613	4239793	So...
4242066	4246368	Wait, you mean to say that some companies find the value in not having an online pass?
4246408	4250289	Well, come on, this is the same company that just put an online pass on an offline game.
4250409	4250670	True.
4252010	4259493	And to be fair, that wasn't really an online pass, that was just, you know, free DLC that they labeled something completely stupid.
4259553	4262394	It was like, you know, instead of saying, ooh, free gift, it was like...
4263928	4266149	You know, pay money or get raped.
4266329	4273051	You know, it's like, you know, not... If you just called it a free gift, it wouldn't have sounded so bad.
4273111	4274391	Why'd you call it get raped?
4274471	4275772	I mean, that doesn't make any sense.
4275812	4276532	Why would you do that?
4277892	4283734	So they're doing that for SSX, and so if you don't want to buy the game, or if you rent it, you can still play online.
4283754	4290436	You just won't be able to unlock your little tokens or shit for your downloading or unlocking in-game things.
4290456	4290796	Big deal.
4291697	4291817	Um...
4292817	4299664	However, what's kind of weird though is a co-op shooter, Syndicate, also coming out from EA, is not going to have an online pass at all.
4300866	4302327	Just, eh, whatever reason.
4302828	4306512	They say we want little resistance or barriers to entry as possible.
4309557	4315581	I think a lot of guys say that too I had to come back in the room, didn't I?
4316441	4323125	The co-op is equal billing in this We wanted everyone who owns a copy of the game to have access to the entire product
4323612	4324252	Well, now, that's fair.
4324312	4330236	If they recognize that, like, the core element of their game is the online part, you don't fucking gate it behind a pass.
4331277	4331537	Right?
4332678	4339362	But yet they do for Battlefield 3, for Madden, for, you know, NBA.
4339622	4340643	Well, they don't have an NBA game.
4340823	4343425	But when they do have another NBA game, probably this year.
4343445	4344465	NBA Jam might have one.
4346046	4349048	Oh, no, because the Xbox 360 and PS3 are already online only.
4349489	4350269	Yeah, so.
4351430	4352471	And the Wii online.
4352551	4353131	Ha, ha, ha.
4355137	4356058	Need for Speed.
4356418	4359000	I mean, all this shit had these online passes.
4359381	4362323	But I do like the direction they're going.
4362604	4369029	And I want to fucking have, every time that they have a goddamn online pass, the EA says, yeah, we stand behind this online pass.
4369129	4371011	I want them to fucking quote what they said.
4371331	4373973	We want as little resistance or barriers to entry as possible.
4374414	4381360	Because that's really what you're doing is you're telling people, yeah, we only watch you, the player games, if you have the money to buy it new.
4381760	4382941	If not, we don't really give a fuck.
4383461	4386825	We want you to go away because you cost us too much money to run our servers.
4390668	4391729	Oh, wait, wait, wait.
4393111	4394372	Yeah, I'll come back.
4394712	4398596	There was something I was going to rant about this week.
4398616	4399757	I just reminded myself.
4399957	4400457	Oh, goody.
4402279	4404681	And I think it was something along the lines of this online pass thing.
4405242	4406243	We'll get to that later.
4408132	4412034	Alright, is there another story coming up later that's going to prompt that?
4412074	4417656	I don't think so, but it was something I posted on Twitter, and I had to refresh my memory.
4417676	4419577	Just explode on the rant at a random point in the show.
4419597	4423459	It was something about how used games steal money from developers, I think it was.
4423479	4424359	Oh yes, oh yes.
4424399	4425900	Alright, look, well moving on.
4426560	4432122	Old games still give money to the folks that own the rights to them these days.
4432742	4435863	And old games will suddenly become new again on the 3DS.
4436003	4438164	And the old games are coming from the Game Gear.
4438684	4439044	That's right.
4439084	4452448	Apparently, virtual console games for a non-Nintendo platform, of course, in this case Sega, have shown up for 3DS release by the good old ESRB, who has spoiled the releases of Shinobi and Sonic Triple Trouble.
4453128	4454809	So those games apparently have been spotted.
4455089	4482056	To be fair, the ESRB Remember that one of the things that they could do That the publishers could tell them Not to list their stuff on there So it's the fucking publisher's fault Yeah, they might have forgot to check that box in the forum, who knows Now, it's worth noting that at some point TurboGrafx-16 games Were supposed to be available on the 3DS But who knows if that's really going to happen anymore At some point, because there's no more Hudson Well, doesn't Konami Inherently own all their old licenses Or am I wrong?
4483559	4489625	DarkSakura is going to bitch slap me for this, but were there really any that good Game Gear games?
4489645	4489745	Yes.
4489765	4489845	What?
4500780	4501481	Gunstar Heroes.
4502221	4503343	Was that really a Game Gear game?
4503783	4505284	I bought it for Dan for $30.
4506125	4507126	Oh, that's right.
4507206	4507727	I remember that.
4507787	4508988	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4509328	4512271	There were really good... I think there was Puyo Puyo.
4512731	4514453	There was Sonic Spinball.
4515214	4518257	The Lion King game, of all things, was actually really good on Game Gear.
4519013	4520934	So yeah, there were a lot of really good games.
4520954	4527698	The Disney games on Genesis and all that stuff, like Aladdin and shit, were really good.
4528519	4533622	It was like an interesting phase where Sega and Disney just kind of had this really great harmony going on.
4533982	4539385	And if I do recall correctly, I think there were a number of Master System games that were converted for Game Gear use, so...
4540379	4544043	All I remember are that those things were so fucking huge and just drained your batteries.
4544504	4547307	But now, you know, the 3DS will drain your battery.
4548188	4549129	It'll be about as fast.
4549710	4553134	But at least you can recharge your 3DS without having to go buy AA batteries.
4554736	4557940	DarkSakura is going to read us a story and then we're going to get to the release dates.
4558846	4571053	Once upon a time, there was a game called Skyrim, and everyone was like, oh my god, the menu sucks, so people hacked it and put out little ads for it on PC.
4571693	4578757	Well, finally, the people at Bethesda were like, I guess people really don't like how we do this and want different stuff for the game.
4579657	4586961	So, there is a PC creation kit coming out for The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim, and it will be on Steam on Tuesday.
4588683	4599300	And, uh, it's, uh, you can apparently just download it in the tools tab, so I guess people will be happy for it.
4600014	4603276	I'm slowly starting to regret not getting Skyrim on the PC.
4603757	4606338	I wish a lot of these cool things would come to the PlayStation 3.
4606599	4607899	I thought some of it was supposed to.
4608640	4609280	I could be wrong, though.
4610141	4613443	But Alan, he's in there playing Skyrim right now.
4613503	4614804	He's hacked the shit out of that game.
4616625	4618647	He's still playing by the rules, mostly.
4618727	4620088	I don't think he's really cheated a lot.
4620448	4623670	But his interface doesn't even look right to me.
4623790	4626272	But it's really well organized.
4626312	4626772	I like it.
4626832	4629294	It's just like he's done so many hacks to it.
4629434	4632516	How many of us have WoW that look exactly like it did when we first got it?
4632656	4633536	That's true, that's true.
4633576	4638819	But that is something that Blizzard embraces, and that's part of why it's better than a lot of MMOs, by the way.
4639239	4645563	But anyway, let's travel around the world and look at release dates and talk about games that you'll be able to hack soon in a store near you.
4646283	4647564	Loki, we'll start with the US dates.
4648024	4650025	There's actually some stuff this week.
4650365	4651286	Not really a...
4652966	4654147	Thanks for watching!
4671635	4676217	The Darkness 2 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC as well.
4676758	4681081	The Jak and Daxter Collection for PS3 will be coming out.
4681741	4689086	Resident Evil Revelations with an extra I, at least on the packaging.
4689726	4693008	And that's coming out on 3DS only.
4694209	4697851	Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC as
4701473	4706975	We also have the Zumba Fitness Rush on Xbox 360.
4707955	4709575	That'll be out on Sunday.
4711316	4715537	And, yeah, that's it.
4716097	4722419	Oh, and as I remember, remind you, the 3DS Circle Pad Pro will be out in GameStop.
4725700	4726000	Yay.
4726658	4727279	I'm irritated.
4728541	4731445	Is there any chance if I wait it out it'll come to another retailer?
4734649	4738134	I guess there's nothing I need it for right now, so I'm just gonna hold my breath.
4739335	4739955	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4769321	4771463	I'm trying to see what... That hasn't come out over there yet?
4772123	4772764	No, I guess not.
4772904	4773365	Surprised.
4773605	4775026	It came out over here back in October.
4775286	4776347	I don't think it's a price reduction.
4776767	4777928	No, it's definitely not a price reduction.
4777948	4779770	It might be like a localized version for them.
4781071	4782733	So, interesting.
4784154	4785235	So yeah, that's coming out this week.
4787421	4789542	Well, sometimes they get the games a little later than we do, you know?
4791142	4796745	Remember, the PlayStation Vita Vita Vegman's already out in Japan, so they have some new games this week.
4796825	4802987	Gravity Days comes out this week, and Sumiyomi, I think I'm saying that right, comes out this week on the Vita.
4803007	4807789	I'm trying to see if this is a game... I'm trying to see if this looks familiar to me.
4807809	4813651	I'm looking at a little trailer for Sumiyomi here in the studio to see if it's one that I recognized.
4816044	4817345	I like the art style in this game.
4818206	4819928	It's a little bit like Okami.
4820248	4824412	I've seen the... Oh, it's an ink game.
4824512	4826875	Sumie is a type of drawing with ink.
4828316	4830919	I saw this when they were talking about Vita stuff.
4830939	4833021	I actually saw the video for it.
4833041	4835183	I don't remember what it's being called over here, though.
4836264	4840327	That game is coming out this week in Japan because they already have the Vita over there.
4842789	4848013	Looking at the other handheld real quick, I'm just going to look really quickly at the Wii, see if there's anything worth mentioning.
4848093	4848253	No.
4849494	4850675	How about the 3DS though?
4851476	4851996	Not really.
4852256	4853317	Nothing until the 14th.
4853397	4858521	Nude Love Plus comes out on the 14th with plenty of art book limited editions if you want to check that out.
4858541	4861363	I thought for a second there you said Nude Love Plus.
4862044	4862184	No.
4862224	4863665	That would be a whole different 3DS game right there.
4866127	4867707	Alright, that does it for Japanese releases.
4867747	4868267	DarkSakura?
4869748	4880930	In the UK, on the 7th, we have Combat Wings, The Great Battles of World War II, Gotham City Imposters, House of the Dead 3, and The Simpsons Arcade for PS3.
4881690	4885291	On the 8th of February, we have more Gotham City crap.
4886191	4888072	On the 9th, we have Cell Emergence.
4888272	4891912	On the 10th, Catherine for Xbox 360 and PS3.
4892473	4894013	That game is messed up.
4894833	4905739	EA Sports Grand Slam Tennis 2, Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning, Mario and Sonic at the London Olympic Games on 3DS, One Piece Unlimited Crew Special, and The Darkness 2.
4905959	4908080	That's it.
4909575	4913676	Alrighty, just a couple more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.
4913776	4931542	But first... So, there's some talk saying, you know, Iwata is actually interested in doing some, you know, microtransactions with the Wii U. One of the pieces of technology that they may be incorporating for the Wii U is...
4932302	4933904	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4953207	4957571	or Skylanders.
4957591	4961193	They're saying that it can provide a system in which consumers can use e-money.
4962174	4973042	They'll find it much more easily to be able to make payments by entering credit card numbers or by purchasing Nintendo prepaid cards at the store.
4974809	4984750	um you know of course they're you know trying to support DLC but they want to do it in a way that's not you know crazy
4986288	4998538	Also, they're throwing out the idea that maybe Super Mario Land 3D or Mario Kart may get DLC, which I would be happy with that.
4998558	4999538	I think they should do that.
5001460	5005083	What if we could provide add-on content through the network?
5006023	5011047	As I referred to before, for example... Like everyone else does?
5011147	5011808	Yeah, for example...
5012268	5041173	this idea of supplying new stages to Super Mario users who want to play the game more but have completed the game and lost interest in existing stages this will not only give us new profits but then lengthen the life of the product and that it will never appear to be out of fashion and can keep attracting public attention as long as many people play no shit people have been doing this for fucking years now and you just figured this out oh my god
5042293	5043274	That's fantastic.
5043674	5052176	Yeah, I can't wait to see what breakthrough ideas will come with the Wii U. Hey, guys, we're going to have this thing called online.
5052976	5056737	People can play without being in the same room.
5056777	5067901	You have to admit, as behind the times as Nintendo is, there is almost that benefit to them being behind the times that you don't have this online pass garbage on any of the Nintendo games.
5067921	5068441	Yes, you do.
5068581	5068941	Do you?
5068961	5069001	No.
5069241	5069841	Yes, you do.
5069861	5070241	Which game?
5070321	5070561	What?
5071241	5074522	You have the U-Pass that's on the... God, really?
5074702	5083224	And the online passes do apply to the Wii games for Madden, for example, has online pass, I believe.
5083664	5087765	And it's just a lot of those core games don't end up... Well, then I stand corrected.
5087945	5088105	Yeah.
5088885	5091385	Unfortunately, they do have that stuff.
5091465	5092886	They are not exempt from it.
5094826	5099328	It's just that there's not a lot of big games that come out, so that's why you don't hear a lot of it.
5100028	5101528	But yeah, I mean, come on.
5101868	5104149	They do these really amazing things sometimes.
5104989	5108330	Like the 3D's kind of cool, and the motion controls and stuff like that.
5108410	5111071	At the same time, say, hey, we got this one cool thing.
5112052	5114192	Oh, but we forgot to totally update everything else.
5114372	5116833	It's just like, oh, shit, you guys want HD graphics?
5116873	5117853	Well, we didn't fucking do that.
5117933	5118474	Oh, online?
5118494	5118874	Nah.
5119194	5120274	But hey, you got motion controls.
5121114	5121855	Isn't that what you wanted?
5121895	5122295	Something new?
5122975	5138879	Hey 3D, it's got 3D, that's awesome, DLC, ah fuck, well we just didn't do DLC yet, we're gonna patch it in later, I'm sure, you know, we will eventually, and we'll support it someday, you know, maybe, yeah, we'll put out another system or something that'll have DLC in there.
5141488	5145750	Let me rephrase the point I made earlier since Loki owned me.
5147211	5156336	Because most of the stuff worth buying on the Wii is from Nintendo themselves and Nintendo's buying the times, we don't have any of this online pass garbage.
5156596	5156977	Exactly.
5157077	5157337	Okay.
5157857	5158918	At least we can agree on that.
5159978	5160258	All right.
5161179	5164581	Well, congrats to Nintendo for getting on the DLC train, I guess.
5164661	5166442	I just hope they don't go overboard with all this.
5166862	5168003	Now we know how to charge people.
5168023	5168123	Yay.
5170031	5179640	Alright, sometimes your money just goes to these very interesting places where you just wish you'd never spent it in the first place.
5180180	5182863	And I think that's what a lot of Mass Effect fans are feeling this week.
5182963	5184905	No, I'm not talking about the game, don't worry.
5185265	5187387	But I am talking about the spinoff book series.
5188127	5193251	A book came out, I guess, I don't know if it was last week or about a month ago, called Mass Effect Deception.
5193771	5197434	And apparently the book has just got tons and tons of errors.
5198054	5203999	And I'm talking like the type that, like if you're a lore nerd, are just like terribly bad errors.
5205119	5210563	For example, oh, actually they have put together a document, I guess, online on Google.
5210924	5212325	That's a pretty neat community idea.
5212705	5213425	That has 80 errors.
5217553	5218215	All together.
5218736	5220520	I'm trying to actually pull this up right now and see if...
5223420	5226501	They talk about like the Citadel is the wrong state.
5227341	5238165	One of the characters kills an alien by slicing into the back of its neck and severing the spine, but you can't really do that with this type of alien because they're not biologically set up that way.
5238225	5244367	So it's like, it's almost like, you know how like when Star Trek kind of gets the canon wrong, the fans are up in arms?
5244827	5246188	Like the whole series of Enterprise?
5246628	5246848	Yes.
5249582	5276410	so like 80 different errors they've all put together and stuff and yeah timeline errors and things like that so apparently it's gotten to the point where Bioware actually came out and said the teams at Del Rey and Bioware would like to extend our sincerest apologies to the Mass Effect fans for any errors and oversights made in the recent novel Mass Effect Deception we are currently working on a number of changes that will appear in future editions of the novel
5277867	5287594	I don't know how... So, in other words, it was all a dream, or alternate timeline, that whole book was an alternate universe, surprise!
5287614	5290256	This is what happens when you write books like you write games.
5291677	5292918	Can't fucking patch a book.
5295260	5296361	You cannot patch a book.
5297562	5300264	You can, apparently, you just print it later, but...
5302119	5303020	Oh yeah, that's another thing.
5303180	5306704	Hey, the Wii, can't patch anything, so we better get it right the first time.
5306884	5310627	Or we'll have to put out, no, because remember what they had to do for the Zelda save games?
5310948	5314511	They had to put out the Zelda save game patching channel.
5319636	5320977	You have to admit, that's kind of funny.
5321638	5322159	Kind of funny.
5322319	5323300	That's kind of terrible.
5324661	5326303	Always a hoot and a holler here on the show.
5328569	5329731	The classic game of the week.
5331853	5339420	DarkSakura likes to dive into the classic gaming vault every week and pull out a game that she thinks, hey, back in my day, you didn't have patches.
5340140	5342122	You took your games glitchy and you liked it.
5342622	5343123	Yeah.
5344164	5346546	And if they were glitchy, they were collector's items.
5346626	5347367	Exactly.
5349008	5351451	So here it is, the classic game of the week.
5351531	5352492	Is it a glitchy title?
5353012	5353512	Not really.
5354012	5355233	But it's full of bugs, right?
5355753	5356293	Full of viruses.
5356353	5358054	Alright, what's the classic game of the week?
5358254	5358934	Dr. Mario.
5359974	5361815	It's been a while since I've done a puzzle game, I think.
5361915	5362995	So I had to do Dr. Mario.
5363576	5365776	And stupid me didn't link the YouTube.
5365976	5366277	Fail.
5366957	5369138	It's alright.
5369698	5373059	We'll play the QT music and I'll bring in the Dr. Mario music when I can.
5373479	5375221	Well, Dr. Mario... I need a patch.
5376122	5376962	Dr. Mario came out in 1990.
5377043	5382247	It was designed by Gunpei Yokoi, and it was produced by Takahiro Harada.
5382768	5387092	It came out on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and it was super fun.
5387532	5390715	You got to play as Mario, who became a doctor.
5391176	5392437	Plumber to doctor, go fig.
5393158	5397482	And his point is to eradicate really, really deadly viruses.
5397842	5398262	Thanks for watching!
5414049	5439125	and when you stack three of the same color on top of the virus then it destroys the virus and you keep going and oh my god I was good at this game I mean really good at this game I'm not kidding you had a max level of 20 that you could select and then you could just keep going from there and I could go into the I was really good at it and so humble too
5439805	5443668	I'm not gonna... A game's kind of hard not to be good at, you know?
5444528	5447410	I mean, unless you just have really awful reflexes.
5448371	5454595	Anyway, there are all kinds of other versions, different ports and things that have come out, too.
5455536	5459518	It was re-released on the Game Boy Advance as part of the Classic Nest series.
5460459	5469465	And there were versions of it that was... There's a minigame in WarioWare Inc., Mega Micro Games, and Brain Age 2, more training in minutes a day.
5471727	5474609	But let's see what else we have with this.
5474669	5478172	Because you also have... Your playfield is a bottle.
5479033	5480634	And so he's throwing it into a bottle.
5481315	5483597	And you've got as much space as your bottle allows.
5483757	5486419	And honestly, on screen, it's fairly small.
5486739	5489601	Especially, man, on the 13-inch TV that I played on...
5491014	5492235	Go blind playing that thing.
5492555	5498177	So let's hear about some of the people that probably had problems that this game was pushing pills to kids.
5499717	5502958	Because I'm sure I've heard that story somewhere before.
5504159	5510321	I know you might not have it in front of you, but I know some fucking old ladies club probably complained.
5511041	5513742	Dr. Mario teaches my kids about drugs.
5513782	5515343	You see how many drugs will people pop?
5515523	5515803	Hello?
5518287	5525949	Anyway, it also did have a multiplayer mode where two players could compete against each other to clean their different fields out.
5527290	5533572	Basically, you just had to get rid of your viruses before they got rid of theirs, but it had more capsules fall on the opposing side.
5534892	5539073	My little sister and I would play that hours on end.
5540173	5544555	Of course, it was done by Yokoi, who was the guy that gave us the Game Boy and the Game & Watch.
5545855	5559220	and um uh Takehiro Harada who um was the producer was the producer on Metroid so and um a lot of the music actually that ended up um some of the music ended up in Super Smash Brothers Brawl
5561820	5566343	was the guy that did that actually became one of the presidents of Creatures Inc.
5566583	5569925	which owned a third of the copyright regarding Pokemon.
5571186	5573227	Just to show that little correlation.
5574528	5575489	Were you going to say something?
5576369	5577370	Gotta eradicate them all.
5579710	5580651	Dr. Mario in Puzzle League
5602909	5613911	2003, there was the release of a Nintendo GameCube preview disc that had you could download the NES version of Dr. Mario to your Game Boy Advance console.
5614231	5614871	That was pretty cool.
5615551	5617652	You do that little cable deal that came out.
5618892	5626033	There was an enhanced version that came with Tetris on the Super Nintendo that was Tetris and Dr. Mario that came out on December 30th, 1994.
5627533	5629114	Why not bring it out before then, you know?
5629254	5630054	Christmas, blah.
5631474	5638338	It was also re-released in Japan on March 30th, 1997 and was downloadable for the Satellaview.
5639879	5641980	It was called Dr. Mario BS version.
5642000	5645983	Because the Satellaview is the BS Satellaview.
5647083	5648764	Can I play some music for one of the other versions here?
5648944	5649164	Sure.
5649385	5651646	We're going to go to the Mario 64 version here.
5654027	5654307	Kind of...
5662478	5666879	Same song, but a little souped up.
5667479	5674301	But yeah, it was also downloadable for the Nintendo Power Cartridges and Super Famicom and Game Boy.
5675422	5684724	And then on the 21st anniversary of its release in 2011, the original Game Boy version was made available for the 3DS to download.
5687274	5712488	Um, basically, parents, this is what you were talking about, they said that there was a parent, parents had issues about the inclusion of medicine, and there was a review by Ace that gave it a 510 out of 1000 points because it said it reeked of plagiarism, and that it was worse than the games it was modeled after.
5713308	5714390	Ace Games Magazine E-Map
5729109	5757472	Amiga format and ST titles oh wow so yeah anyway keep going there were it was really just a good game a lot of people really loved it you know it was very simple graphically but it got it made its point it was fun and simple to play and that's the point of a game it was enough challenging to keep you playing it because I would play this game for hours I can tell you that
5759834	5762877	But yeah, like you said, there were other follow-ups.
5762917	5765579	There was Dr. Mario 64, like we're listening to right now.
5766220	5767701	That other game modes too.
5768322	5770483	And other characters, including Wario.
5771304	5773246	Because at the time, Wario Land 3 was out.
5775107	5779211	And it came out in Japan under the Nintendo Puzzle Collection.
5779571	5780772	But Wario wasn't a doctor.
5780812	5782053	He was just a nurse practitioner.
5784796	5786077	Dr. Mario Online.
5787762	5794388	RX, which I guess for prescription, came out in 2008 on the Wii, so you could play online versus the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.
5794528	5801013	So I do want to say to Alpha Cananigram in our chat room at chat.orange.com who says, Nintendo, release Dr. Mario 3DS online.
5801334	5802595	Put it on the Nintendo Network.
5802675	5804376	There is the Wii one.
5804416	5808680	I mean, granted, you might be specifically wanting a handheld, but there is an online version available.
5809048	5812329	and then there was Dr. Mario Express that came out in 2009 for the DSi.
5812970	5813590	Not multiplayer.
5814790	5816471	Boo.
5816551	5819552	Dr. Mario is a secret character in Smash Bros.
5819592	5828776	Melee and they actually had an attack based on it in Brawl and it had the chill music from the game.
5830196	5836919	I mean, just lots of cool stuff and actually that music was arranged by the guy that did music for Magical Drop.
5838476	5841897	Just all kinds of neat little crossovers there, don't you think?
5842397	5842698	Mm-hmm.
5843218	5843998	So that's it.
5845178	5845459	All right.
5845679	5846179	Dr. Mario.
5846619	5849700	There it is, your classic game of the week, Dr. Mario.
5850340	5857483	For the NES, really, but available on pretty much every Nintendo system since then, in one way or another, including the Game Boy.
5857563	5858883	I saw one there on YouTube.
5859003	5860924	I think I owned it on Game Boy, actually.
5861244	5862425	I don't think I owned it on NES.
5862465	5863165	I owned it on Game Boy.
5863877	5865538	I want to play the Satellaview version.
5866399	5867600	The BS one?
5868340	5868560	No.
5869221	5869981	The BS, yeah.
5871442	5878287	But we've actually got a Satellaview ROM of the Zelda game.
5878307	5879888	It was really good.
5880288	5883270	So I can imagine what the Dr. Mario one looks like.
5884341	5884661	All right.
5885041	5888322	Well, that's going to do it for part A of our show tonight, but we're not done yet, guys.
5888342	5889482	We've got plenty more to come.
5889522	5896224	We're going to talk about some other things when we get back from a quick break here, including some Xbox-related announcements and news.
5896624	5901326	This is Sony possibly in trouble, according to somebody, so we'll talk a little bit about that.
5901346	5908768	And then, of course, your Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR and your emails at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and...
5909488	5911171	because it is a show where every gamer has a voice.
5911211	5912573	There's many ways to contact us.
5912934	5917441	The Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
5917461	5921727	We will be taking all of those calls a little later on right after a quick break.
5922068	5922869	So stay tuned, guys.
5922889	5923671	We'll be right back.
5930015	5937722	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live with episode number 444 on this February the 5th of 2012.
5938042	5945869	You know, there's this football game going on and Loki was mentioning that he was watching, he's catching up now on the good stuff, the commercials.
5947110	5951034	And you just said, what, the Battleship movie might not be so bad from what you're looking at?
5951054	5951154	Yeah.
5951554	5952194	I just really want that.
5969685	5969765	E5!
5969785	5970907	You sunk my battleship!
5986474	5987515	It just looked ridiculous.
5987795	5990396	It's just like it could be Transformers 4 or whatever.
5990436	5992777	I mean, it's just pretty much... I don't know.
5993138	5993738	I'm down with it.
5993758	5994438	Because, I mean, come on.
5995079	5996519	Look back at, like, Independence Day.
5996560	5998040	How fucking cheesy was that movie?
5998060	5999221	I mean, it was so cheesy.
5999761	6000942	I did see snakes on a plane.
6001482	6001742	Yeah?
6002543	6003483	In the theater at Disneyland.
6006285	6008246	Did they get the motherfucking snakes off the motherfucking plane?
6008346	6010067	It was me, Kristen, and Megzi.
6011365	6016529	Wearing giant plushy snakes wrapped around us in the movie theater.
6016589	6018931	You dressed up to go see Snakes on a Plane.
6020673	6024936	We got the snakes at the Jungle Trader.
6025257	6026317	Yeah, we did something similar.
6026417	6028199	We watched it actually at our work.
6028459	6030101	They had a movie screening in our theater.
6030181	6033383	We had rubber snakes that we were throwing during the movie.
6033523	6034224	That was kind of fun.
6035725	6037787	But yeah, the Avengers trailer is awesome.
6039537	6041079	That was a cool scene.
6041460	6042721	I love Samuel L. Jackson.
6042801	6046786	I like when the giant snake ate that one dude.
6055896	6064879	And I gotta admit though, I would be all for them making a sequel where it takes place on a space shuttle with Samuel Jackson in it.
6064919	6065839	Snakes on a shuttle.
6066459	6070780	Well, you know that someone tried to do a knockoff called Snakes on a Train.
6071020	6072561	Oh yeah, that's Asylum.
6072721	6075962	Asylum does fucking transmorphers and...
6078303	6083145	I would expect them to do a GoBot scene How can we get in one of these movies?
6083265	6090568	Damn it Don't they have a need for witty radio trio to be eaten alive by snakes or something?
6090588	6091028	They may
6092949	6113303	so many stupid movies and the thing is they do it intentional now I mean I don't know if they do it intentional as far as like they buy the properties for these and then they put them on like sci-fi channel or they purposely make them that bad I don't know if it's hard to tell like if are you doing this on purpose or you do you really just suck that much you know it's just I don't know
6114984	6118986	Before we get into the rapid fire news tonight, DarkSakura, you mentioned you wanted to plug something real quick.
6119186	6120286	Yes, I do.
6120726	6128389	One of our fantabulous listeners, Ikuma JP, made an app for the iPhone, and I want to share it with everybody.
6128789	6130650	It's called My Secret Garden.
6131230	6134911	It's really beautiful, and it's free, so go get it.
6137850	6138931	Rob says he likes free.
6139331	6140572	I didn't give Rob enough time.
6141293	6144015	But it's more than gorgeous moving pictures.
6145917	6146497	It's beautiful.
6146817	6150400	It has nothing to do with the My Secret Garden book series.
6150420	6151501	No, that wasn't a series.
6151561	6154184	It was one book by the same... Well, there was too many fucking books.
6154464	6157026	I'm sorry, there's too many fucking movies based on that book.
6157546	6159408	There was the same lady that wrote A Little Princess.
6159428	6159488	Yes.
6160779	6161439	The more you know.
6162180	6162720	Hey, I read them both.
6162740	6163180	I love those books.
6163200	6165361	But the most beautiful part of that sentence was free.
6165821	6166401	So there you go.
6167682	6167942	All right.
6168002	6169502	And that one of our listeners made him.
6169562	6170683	Of course, of course.
6171503	6174564	So we demand he gets a top 100 ranking immediately.
6175184	6175465	All right.
6176625	6179206	Let's move on to some rapid fire news, Loki.
6180000	6184142	Yes, let's talk a little bit about movies.
6184382	6186083	We were just talking about movies.
6186203	6193726	Ace Attorney, a movie I'm sure a lot of people might be interested in checking out, is actually going to be localized for worldwide release.
6194327	6198969	I'm sure that's going to be a very limited release, but hey, you'll eventually get it on DVD and Blu-ray soon.
6200730	6203511	As long as Samuel L. Jackson isn't saying, OBJECTION!
6209373	6210214	He should be the judge.
6210815	6213538	These motherfucking ejections out of my motherfucking courtroom.
6214379	6215640	Objections in the courtroom.
6216942	6220726	Sustain, motherfucker!
6221547	6223009	You can put him really in anything, you know.
6223029	6225131	Samuel Jackson really could just be in anything.
6225672	6227314	Stance is sitting on the toilet at the movie.
6231718	6233419	That'll be the movie we get offered to do.
6234080	6234400	All right.
6234740	6235781	Sorry.
6236681	6241405	And then they're doing a Humble Bundle for Android, which is kind of unique.
6241965	6243066	Mainly it's been PC.
6244166	6246368	But now you're going to be able to get a few games.
6246728	6261298	The new Humble Bundle for Android offers Android versions of Anomaly, Warzone, Earth, Osmos, and Edge with a bonus copy of World of Goo if you exceed the average payment.
6262098	6263519	Um, so that's kinda neat.
6263780	6269003	That's neat that it's coming to mobile phones, so it'll never happen on Apple, but hey, yay for Android.
6269183	6277009	And I guess, um, these games are cross-platform, so you get them on Android and Windows and OSX and Linux.
6279130	6281332	So, it's pretty nice, I guess.
6282372	6289938	Problem is, you know, really with a lot of these bundles, it's like if you bought one of these bundles, you probably have most of the games already in there anyway, so it's...
6290994	6293035	How many fucking copies of VVVV do I need?
6293095	6293875	Or World of Goo?
6293935	6294896	I mean, it's just really.
6296817	6298758	Last but not least, Vita Games.
6299418	6306602	They did mention a while back that Vita Games were going to be cheaper if you did buy them online versus a boxed game.
6306942	6311364	However, you may consider still wanting to buy a boxed game because you're only going to be saving 10%.
6312224	6313085	And that's it.
6313185	6315446	They're 10% cheaper on the PlayStation Network.
6315486	6316426	They will be day and day.
6316946	6320048	So if it's a game that maybe you just want to go to the store to get it,
6321750	6342357	and you can do it I guess but it's only 10% like two bucks on some of these games that's really interesting actually that whole thing because that's kind of how they're gonna try and combat used games is by making it cheaper to buy a new one that you can never sell back
6344325	6345366	It's not much cheaper.
6345526	6347168	It's like a few bucks.
6347268	6354257	Seriously, you're going to make back the difference if you sell a new copy of a game used.
6354758	6356400	For some people, that's going to make the difference.
6356720	6357101	You know it.
6359204	6360365	It's 10%, folks.
6360425	6361065	I mean, come on.
6361105	6361565	Just saying.
6361926	6365187	Now, if you want to play devil's advocate, you could say, no, it's not really 10%.
6365928	6370450	It's going to be that plus tax, but I don't know if they charge tax on these purchases.
6371691	6372811	Might depend on the state still.
6373152	6373392	Yeah.
6373912	6383657	So you could potentially save upwards to 20%, but once again, you could probably buy it used and it'll be cheaper.
6384458	6388520	I just don't know if there's a real need for you to jump in and get everything digital.
6389100	6389981	Thanks for watching!
6414100	6417602	And if you're not one to sell back games, then maybe?
6418842	6419062	Alright.
6419603	6420343	Well, moving on.
6421123	6426366	Unfortunately, misspellings on box art will not result in any type of price reduction.
6426426	6427907	In fact, it might make the price of these go up.
6428007	6428387	I don't know.
6428887	6434670	But we talked about this a little bit last week, and that's, of course, Resident Evil Revelations or whatever.
6435390	6436630	Thank you for watching!
6459678	6463761	It's missing the I and the T are backwards there, so that's what's wrong.
6464581	6471465	But anyway, yeah, so the box art made it out there, so you might actually, if you've already picked up a copy... Doesn't that stuff get proofed?
6471545	6473926	I mean... No, we were talking about this last week.
6475187	6479089	But anyway... Seeing where that is now, I think the designer had very little to do with that.
6480050	6480230	Yeah.
6482743	6488565	Capcom has stated that the initial shipment was sent to retailers in North America with a spelling error.
6489085	6495726	It's being repackaged and will have the corrected spelling so you can actually order a new slipcover for it.
6495926	6500848	This is the exact same thing they did when they put out Okami with the IGN watermark on it.
6501228	6502188	Hilarious!
6503388	6505849	I have all of the new ones and I didn't even know the game.
6506280	6510563	That's even better because I have a poster that they've made up the box art.
6511003	6513545	It's just like, how'd you miss that?
6515906	6517127	Somebody approved that.
6517748	6518068	All right.
6518988	6533418	Well, if Dance Dance Revolution with just yourself isn't enough and DDR in the arcades with two people isn't enough, well, I hope you're still in high school because DDR Classroom Edition is going to be a PC game that allows 48 dance mats.
6535592	6538354	All to be linked together so that you can all play DDR.
6538594	6539554	That's actually kind of cool.
6539695	6546779	I'm actually, you know, as a gamer nerd who, you know, has been one ever since like high school where sometimes I was looked at as like the big old nerd for being into games.
6547119	6551622	This is pretty rad that DDR really has kind of gotten into a lot of different PE programs.
6552182	6559166	And so this is out there to try and basically get like an official Dance Dance Revolution classroom game.
6559286	6567212	I mean, Konami already supports DDR and PE programs, but this is now just a whole, like, 48 people can all play the same game.
6567613	6569614	I'm not sure how that works.
6569854	6576780	Like, I don't know if it's like, if the majority of people get it right, then you get points or whatever, but I think it's just kind of a, you know...
6578757	6580419	Individual scorings, maybe?
6580819	6581220	Who knows?
6581280	6581600	Who knows?
6581640	6583943	Yeah, if you fail this, you will get an F in P.E.
6584844	6586926	The time has come for you to dance for your life.
6587267	6587367	No.
6587907	6588128	All right.
6588188	6589869	Now's the time let's break and swim and dance!
6592386	6604655	Now, I couldn't tell you exactly what songs are going to be in this new DDR game, but I bet if it's for schools, it's probably not going to be any songs by one particular musician who's been showing up in a lot of music games lately.
6605135	6613801	And if recent rumors are to be believed, Ubisoft, who has made Just Dance, The Black-Eyed Peas Experience...
6614641	6637629	The Abba You Can Dance The Michael Jackson Experience Guess what's supposed to come out for the Wii and the Wii U later this year The Lady Gaga Experience You know you're gonna get it Praise Gaga Oh my god Step aside lesser pop divas
6642455	6647017	You too can experience Amazon discounting your album to 99 cents.
6648937	6653259	Your fifth single not doing so well with a video that you directed nobody understands.
6653719	6654260	No, I'm kidding.
6654380	6656381	Look, Lady Gaga experience.
6656801	6659082	There'll be plenty of people that'll pick that up.
6659162	6660202	I may or may not be one of them.
6660662	6661423	You will be one of them.
6661443	6663224	I will totally fucking buy this game.
6663304	6664764	I am not even going to try and lie.
6665645	6668706	As long as it has all the songs I really like, I'll get it day one.
6668866	6670707	Lady Gaga, the experience, all will be revealed.
6670747	6671468	You will experience.
6671488	6672408	Is she really a man?
6672448	6674229	No, that was proven when she showed her twat.
6674289	6675090	When did she show her twat?
6675110	6675350	Telephone.
6692816	6693556	I don't remember that.
6694517	6700140	She hopped up on the bars and showed her twat to everybody and it was all squared out.
6701200	6702461	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
6702741	6703281	I remember that.
6703582	6705403	Well, they just had to pixel out her penis.
6706623	6707964	She likes to make fun of it.
6708324	6713307	And you know, if she had a penis, that thing would be like platinum plated and candy striped.
6714608	6729829	when I went to her concert don't give her ideas for a new video I've seen her live twice in concert and both times she's joked about the rumors that she has a penis like she thinks it's funny so she likes the mystery I guess anyway can we please stop talking about Lady Gaga's penis and move on to more rapid fire news
6730490	6731071	DarkSakura.
6731351	6732072	I guess.
6733473	6735815	Well, how about Dance Central 2?
6737056	6741399	Download content is going to have some fun stuff in it if you like the game.
6742080	6744602	There is Say Hey, I Love You.
6744622	6751427	Oh, by the way, this is on February 14th.
6752088	6755491	And Milkshake, because that song's still, you know...
6758483	6778198	It still brings all the boys to the yard All these years later And LMFAO featuring Lauren Bennett and Goon Rock's Party Rock Anthem That might be kind of cool Also on January 31st is Forget You Or as the version I like, Fuck You I just realized, do you even know what song Party Rock Anthem is?
6778599	6778719	No
6781335	6782016	Thanks for watching!
6797868	6804570	Yeah, my favorite was when Alan and I were in the car the other day and we were listening to one station and Adele came on and we flipped to another station.
6804610	6806570	They were in the middle of another Adele song.
6806850	6810611	Go to a third station, they're in the middle of the song, the Adele song that the first station started playing.
6810651	6814052	I'm like, this bitch is everywhere.
6815313	6816213	God, I cannot.
6818322	6824388	Also, if you bought your copy of Dance Central 2 from Best Buy, you will get a code to get Party Rock Anthem early.
6825248	6825869	Just saying.
6826529	6827770	Whatever the hell song that is.
6827790	6830412	That's a delayed DLC bonus right there.
6830613	6832234	How about Just Dance 3 DLC?
6832574	6834476	Because, you know, that game's relevant too.
6835957	6838219	It is technically the number one selling game right now.
6838399	6841420	You can get The Power by Snap.
6842540	6844861	Because people still like that song.
6845461	6851123	And you can actually get Bollywood, Kati Kallendal, I guess.
6851823	6853004	Love Letters, Y.O.Y.
6853184	6854864	and Sweet Invaders, Skin to Skin.
6856005	6857425	So you can get all those 240 Microsoft points apiece.
6860806	6886191	and then last but not least which I kind of think I need to get this there's going to be the Pink Pearl 3DS available on February 10th and I want it the same way I wanted my pink GBA in a totally ironic way I was hipster before everybody else was no seriously I wanted the pink one because I thought it was hideous and I liked it and I think I would want this one too because it's equally hideous and I really want it
6886601	6889463	Okay, so tell me if you've ever heard this song before, DarkSakura.
6890804	6896027	Are you ready?
6897148	6898129	Oh, this shit.
6900310	6901951	I'm like, she's not the girl in the bubble.
6902011	6903992	She has to have heard it at some point.
6904253	6905593	It's like pretty much avoidable.
6906554	6909156	You can't, you know, you can't avoid that song at all.
6909176	6909756	It's like avoiding something.
6909796	6911197	I don't listen to the radio in my car.
6911457	6912718	I know, but you go to Pinkberry.
6912958	6914900	Yeah, that's probably, I think, where I heard it.
6915060	6915260	Shit.
6916465	6917045	DarkSakura.com
6941480	6942840	I don't know who does it, but I'm winning.
6942860	6943601	That's LMFAO.
6943641	6944121	It's the same band.
6944141	6944321	It is?
6944761	6945041	Okay.
6945401	6946762	Yeah, I think that song was hilarious.
6946782	6950563	They also did that song that, you know, sine waves, you know, won a cage match.
6950583	6953023	You know, that's who opened for Kesha when my friend went.
6956184	6958425	She said she was going just to see them and not Kesha.
6959059	6960780	I'm surprised she didn't catch the herps.
6960860	6965004	The next day when she came into class, she still had glitter in her hair.
6965084	6965704	It was so funny.
6966585	6967646	I think Kesha's hilarious.
6968907	6972210	I used to really hate Kesha, but she's really grown on me.
6972270	6975152	And a lot of that is probably the influence of some of my friends.
6975833	6980917	But now it's kind of like that whole guilty pleasure type of thing.
6981077	6982658	Some days you just feel a little bit trashy.
6982978	6984399	Some days you want a trashy girl.
6984880	6985000	Shit.
6985160	6985560	Just saying.
7010816	7013599	Can you imagine if Ubisoft put out Kesha the experience?
7014460	7015921	I'm sexy and I know it.
7015961	7018123	It would just come with a gallon of body glitter.
7018864	7019725	I know, God.
7020866	7023849	That would just be... That would make my soul hurt.
7023989	7024950	I would play it.
7025030	7028013	A jar full of gonorrhea and a used tampon.
7028273	7030475	I would play it, but I would turn back in the gonorrhea.
7031776	7032857	You can keep this part.
7033578	7034299	I like my Kesha.
7034599	7035340	Bathe that Kesha.
7036145	7036526	All right.
7036766	7038168	Anyhow, moving on.
7038308	7040692	Let's get into some other news stories.
7040812	7042695	And, of course, the mailbag is coming up soon, too.
7042755	7044577	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7045719	7046680	And the FUs of the week.
7046740	7049023	Twitter topics, Skype line, all that fun stuff.
7049144	7050966	But first, some more stories, Loki.
7051900	7056745	So yeah, you know the new Xbox and everyone's like, oh yeah, it's going to be announced this year.
7056865	7057065	Nope.
7057745	7058846	Microsoft said nope.
7060368	7064412	Apparently the Xbox 360 cycle is not at all finished.
7064592	7068375	The proof is that we don't see the logic in cutting the prices here.
7071478	7074381	And, you know, E3 is still premature.
7075242	7077023	What's certain is that there'll be nothing new in 2012.
7079352	7088058	So, um, and of course, you know, they put out another statement saying, you know, we're always thinking about the next and, you know, what is next and how we can push the boundaries and blah, blah, blah.
7088438	7094002	So, yeah, you know, there will be another Xbox, most likely 2014 or holiday 2013.
7094462	7096263	We're waiting to see what Nintendo does.
7097044	7099405	I should have just been there lying because everybody would have believed that.
7099425	7103508	I honestly think... I was going to tell them that for your ringtone.
7103868	7106390	Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, yeah.
7106410	7106490	Yeah.
7111487	7112687	I did and it turned it back on.
7112707	7124869	Anyways, it's basically... I mean, their new system is going to be graphically... The Wii U is going to be graphically capable of what the 360 is right now.
7124909	7127450	So I don't really think that they have too much to worry about right now.
7127690	7133451	Especially if that whole tablet thing doesn't end up working out to be this innovative masterpiece.
7135003	7135323	I don't know.
7135343	7136505	I think that they're fine right now.
7136985	7147718	They can wait next year for the component prices to come way down and still beef up what's inside their box and put out some great games.
7147898	7148819	What's in their box?
7149500	7149760	Yes.
7150020	7150661	It's Kesha.
7151442	7151542	Um...
7152543	7153163	Here's the thing, though.
7153243	7155564	What does Microsoft show at E3 this year, then?
7155624	7157685	Is it just going to be a repeat of last year's E3?
7157705	7158385	Halo 4.
7158905	7160226	Which they showed at last E3.
7160286	7161706	They showed a teaser.
7161966	7162607	And then what?
7162687	7166208	The Tomb Raider game probably won't be out until this holiday, right?
7166508	7168269	Tomb Raider's not coming out until holiday.
7169109	7172650	There's Bioshock Infinite still holiday this year.
7172690	7175871	Maybe Grand Theft Auto V holiday.
7176051	7177632	Another Call of Duty game.
7178612	7180753	There's going to be a bunch of new IPs.
7180773	7184295	How much of Microsoft's keynote is just going to be rehashed of last year's stuff?
7185836	7187677	I think they may still have a lot of stuff.
7187697	7188797	We haven't heard a whole lot.
7189417	7190918	Maybe they're keeping a lot of it under wraps.
7191418	7194680	And I don't think they need to come out with a brand new system yet.
7195754	7202858	I don't think they do either, but I'm still waiting for that Killer Connect hardcore game.
7204559	7212043	Didn't we get a glimpse at one that was supposed to be some Greek fighting thing?
7212143	7214064	Yes, that's the one from Crytek.
7214865	7217206	That could be a big hit or a big miss.
7219347	7220308	It's hard to say.
7221208	7224450	That could be a hot mess when that comes out, so we'll see.
7226722	7227663	Yeah, there's that one.
7228144	7230487	I don't remember what it's called, but yeah, it's from Crytek.
7234051	7234372	I don't know.
7234392	7235874	There's a lot of games coming out this year.
7236434	7237716	And there's a lot of new IPs.
7237756	7238717	I can't remember all of them.
7240199	7242102	But I'm sure there's going to be some stuff that they'll be able to show.
7242262	7244285	And obviously, there's a new...
7247059	7250962	They're gonna show the new Fable game, which I don't give a shit about at all.
7251142	7254265	I'm done with that series, and done with Peter Molyneux.
7255265	7258948	Like, I think I paid more attention to what he said.
7259008	7261870	Oh yeah, there was that whole Fable connect, like, it's not on rails.
7262030	7262691	It's not on rails!
7262871	7263231	It's on rails.
7263251	7264432	Read the board, it's not on rails.
7264472	7269536	Okay, listen, listen, you fucker, I'm not fucking listening to what fucking Peter Molyneux says.
7269656	7272218	It's not on rails, it's fucking on rails, okay?
7272398	7274300	It will be on goddamn rails.
7276905	7279987	Anything he promises you is going to be underwhelming.
7280188	7281569	It's just the way it is.
7281729	7284711	He's a snake oil salesman.
7285551	7286872	That's what he is.
7286892	7288733	He's a fucking snake oil salesman.
7289334	7293276	He will promise you the world and it will be fucking Fable all over again.
7293456	7294037	And you know what?
7294337	7297599	Whether you're a fan of Fable that much, that might be a good thing.
7297999	7299500	Maybe you're just looking for Fable.
7300201	7303923	But it's not going to be this thing that's going to revolutionize Fable.
7304644	7306205	Nothing will revolutionize Fable.
7306705	7310027	Except maybe Kingdom of Amalur or whatever that game is called.
7310907	7312468	Which is basically EA's Fable game.
7312788	7315130	Yeah, it's Fable with God of War fighting.
7316150	7318191	Which, that's not a bad combo.
7318211	7319292	That doesn't sound bad.
7319312	7320012	It's not a bad combo.
7320052	7321193	It sounds better than the demo.
7321613	7325415	Anyhow, big changes going on at Xbox.
7325435	7326916	This is actually a pretty big change.
7327436	7329177	I always say this guy's name wrong.
7330398	7331278	Steven Toulouse?
7331779	7332379	That sounds right.
7333239	7335840	is one of the big guys at Xbox.
7335900	7339221	He is the director of Xbox Live Policy and Enforcement.
7339281	7341841	He's been working at Microsoft for quite a long time.
7341881	7343782	I think about 17 years he's been working there.
7345022	7347903	He is no longer going to be working there in a couple weeks.
7348083	7350664	He has resigned effective on February 16th.
7351844	7353266	for no particular reason.
7353326	7354126	It's very interesting.
7354187	7357650	He's just said, on the 16th, I'm going to head down to Dallas to visit my family.
7358431	7360353	I have no other plans beyond that.
7360493	7361534	I'm a free agent.
7361934	7364157	Is he a free bitch baby?
7365738	7370263	He's not really saying he's jumped ship to go somewhere else, like some mega company or something like that.
7370823	7372005	or what have you.
7372845	7377490	Microsoft did come out and basically say that yes, he's leaving the company.
7377891	7378992	Thank you for his service.
7379112	7379953	Wish all the best.
7380273	7383096	We don't have any details to share about a potential successor.
7383456	7388742	We can assure you that the Xbox Live Enforcement Squad will continue their work to help ensure a safer, more secure experience.
7390083	7397745	Now, of course, the conclusion that many people have jumped to regarding this little resignation is that, oh, it's because of the hacks.
7398025	7404347	Something's happening with the hacks, and he's stepping out because he knows something ugly is going to go down, and he doesn't want to go down with it.
7405528	7407128	Like all the tinfoil hat people come out.
7407968	7414290	And to some extent, I've been one of the harshest critics of Xbox around here and the way they've handled that whole mess.
7415011	7416071	You mean they handled it?
7416771	7444521	well yeah exactly Rhythm Party is like the first time I've turned on my Xbox in a month so you know I'm just but I don't think at the end of the day it really has anything to do with that because his role was more about keeping the Xbox live environment a safe haven if you will or a family friendly environment you know what I mean it's basically a safe place I don't know whatever you want to call it
7445501	7448763	It's just very possible that after... It's like the Thor of the Banhammer.
7449964	7450644	Well, let's be real.
7450784	7451584	I don't know this guy.
7451645	7452485	I don't know him personally.
7452585	7453706	I don't read his blogs.
7453766	7455386	I don't follow him on Twitter.
7455567	7459929	I've heard he's very accessible, but I have not chosen to access him.
7459989	7461810	Here's the thing, though.
7462350	7468553	If you've been working at the same job 17 years, and so he's got to be, what, like almost 40?
7469474	7473556	He's probably going through what some might call a midlife crisis.
7474156	7476678	And I'm not saying it's necessarily a bad thing.
7476698	7478779	Just tell him to buy a Ferrari and drive.
7479059	7480580	I'm not saying it's necessarily a bad thing.
7480641	7485804	It's probably just that moment a lot of people go through where it's like, is this what I want to do forever?
7486164	7490387	And maybe he decided I want to spend more time with family or I want to do something else.
7490507	7496992	And, you know, as a director, he's probably built up a little bit of a nest egg and he's probably okay to do that.
7497452	7520263	so what I'm trying to say is that I really don't think this has anything to do with the Xbox hacks and just this guy wants to go have a life hooray good for him it's great so meanwhile Xbox really does need to do something about the hacking but I don't think this guy has anything to do with that let's move on shall we
7521829	7548164	Some comments from our chat room real quick on this TigerClaw says he was a co-host for Major Nelson's podcast I think I've listened to one episode of Major Nelson's podcast and it was many many years ago so sadly I wouldn't know that but that's interesting to know so I guess a lot of the community knows him through that too Breakman says he's leaving Xbox Live because he's tired of Xbox Live kids calling him the n-word or questioning his sexuality in vulgar ways on a regular basis
7548456	7550717	Kind of like how everybody gets treated on Xbox Live.
7552659	7556581	Well, you know, if that hasn't been fixed in the past, how long has Xbox Live been around now?
7556601	7557722	About nine years?
7558022	7560243	I don't think it's going to get fixed anytime soon, I'd say.
7561164	7561404	All right.
7562165	7563105	Not that it makes it right.
7563746	7564146	Just saying.
7565267	7575333	Maybe the Xbox lube or whatever the next Xbox ends up being called will have extreme anti-homophobe, anti-racist measures in it.
7575973	7576754	But I wouldn't hold my breath.
7577782	7578843	Let's get to some emails!
7579183	7579843	Yay!
7581144	7586746	Every week you guys email us at mailbag at orangelawntrader.com We read some of our favorite emails on the air.
7587147	7588087	And we stop the music.
7588487	7588627	No.
7589888	7593710	I got one that says don't judge my grammar, but grammar was misspelled.
7594410	7597672	I'm not going to say who it was though because I'm not going to bring attention to that person.
7598772	7603595	So I'm grabbing a random email and here's one that actually has fantastic grammar.
7604895	7610578	I found this great website where you can play NES, NES, okay Genesis is misspelled, etc.
7610678	7611978	games on your computer.
7612058	7614499	I'm writing this because I know DarkSakura is into old games.
7614920	7619842	Keep up the good work and here's another 10 great years of Orange Lounge Radio and that's sincerely CD Thunder.
7621182	7630106	I just want to point out in 10 more years we'll be as old or if not older than this guy who just resigned from Microsoft and we'll probably have a midlife crisis.
7630566	7632547	I would like to point out that he didn't send the link.
7633943	7634223	Really?
7634284	7634624	He told you?
7634904	7636406	Hey, check out this great website.
7636546	7639329	It's called Sincerely Me.
7641010	7641331	Okay.
7642352	7643032	Next email.
7643093	7647978	This comes from... Oh, never mind.
7649379	7651942	This was actually personally for us, so I'm saving it.
7652542	7653523	Now I really want to see it.
7654224	7654985	It's about mics.
7656388	7661329	I'm under an NDA, I don't know Am I going to love this as much as D2 or is there too much hype at this point?
7684992	7686993	I don't think I'm under an NDA.
7687173	7689794	If I am, oops, there's so much information out there.
7689954	7692275	No, there's stuff on YouTube, people playing through it.
7692315	7693215	It can't be under NDA.
7693955	7698697	I'm not going to say anything that... I'll tell you what, the last time I played through it was in November.
7699297	7702358	I probably gave it a more extensive review on one of the shows back then.
7703279	7704239	But I enjoyed it.
7704339	7705720	I enjoyed the older Diablo games.
7706680	7708360	Some people call it, oh, it's just a click fest.
7708380	7709581	It's nothing but click, click, click, click.
7710051	7739612	but um no I thought it was fun I had a lot of fun like um Shane who has sometimes been known as Mikulatov on the show and I um he was in the beta too and we did some co-op online and we had a lot of fun just kind of playing it together and exploring the dungeons um it's very similar to what you remember in Diablo 2 there's a few quality of life improvements like I seem to remember oh god it's been a few months since I played it now but I seem to remember that like you don't have to carry around a bunch of town portal scrolls because like there's an item in your inventory that lets you just make one
7740032	7744114	You know, just kind of like little things like that that help it, you know, feel.
7744254	7745854	You said quality of life improvements?
7746275	7747595	Does it make you sexy and you know it?
7748235	7749396	Yes, it does, actually.
7749876	7751357	And some of the classes were really fun to play.
7751437	7754718	I really enjoyed Monk, but there was another one I played I didn't like as much.
7755418	7756319	I think it was The Witch Doctor.
7756339	7757059	That was The Chip Monk.
7757379	7758980	No, The Witch Doctor I didn't like as much.
7759200	7759780	But I liked The Monk.
7761260	7764065	To continue with the email, any tidbit of info would be appreciated.
7764125	7764386	Thanks.
7764847	7766911	Your loyal turtle in Philly, Sirius Turtle.
7767152	7767513	P.S.
7768956	7770819	I heard that Loki secretly works for Nintendo.
7770980	7771320	Boom!
7773041	7774422	I secretly work for Nintendo.
7774542	7774863	Boom.
7775263	7775543	Boom.
7775583	7775884	Boom.
7776144	7776524	Blocks.
7777645	7778286	I wish.
7778606	7782750	I honestly wish I did because I'd be getting a lot more money.
7782870	7786493	If you thought Reggie knew how to kick ass and take names, Loki would be in there.
7788114	7789515	He'd flip a table the first day.
7790736	7791357	I wish.
7791417	7793659	Loki, would you flip a table if you worked for Nintendo?
7793699	7794039	Fuck that.
7794059	7795200	I'd want to stay unemployed.
7795220	7795501	Okay.
7796855	7798235	Okay, so email, last email.
7798876	7804257	Dear OLR, okay, recently I purchased a copy of The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Game of the Year Edition.
7804657	7807438	Now I'm enjoying it for the most part with the exception of one thing.
7807778	7815560	The Game of the Year Edition has a glitch in which when you're a vampire and you receive a quest to cure yourself.
7816800	7818661	Now, granted, I like being a vampire.
7818801	7823322	I was strong, fast, didn't sparkle, but it made my character weak to fire and sunlight turns me into a crispy gritter.
7823922	7825683	I'm glad I'm not the only one that uses that term.
7826603	7827483	Wait, wait, wait.
7827783	7829464	You mean an Elder Scrolls game is glitchy?
7832065	7838026	Now on that quest, you talk to a witch and after running errands for her, she sends you out for ingredients for the potion to cure yourself permanently.
7838446	7842287	But one of the ingredients will not be accepted now they patched this out of the original game.
7842608	7849349	But when they booted out the Knights of the Nine DLC, the glitch re-arose and there's no way around that with Game of the Year.
7849870	7853951	Now on another note, I've been playing a Japanese PSP demo for Final Fantasy Type-O.
7854031	7854811	I want to play that!
7855411	7860412	I'm wondering if this will ever come into America and how it ties in with the Fabula Nova Crystallis.
7861092	7863613	Thank you for reading my email signed Haseo Sumirogawa.
7863993	7867174	I don't believe it is part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis.
7867234	7868734	It was supposed to be Akito.
7868974	7871335	It was originally going to be the mobile phone one, right?
7871375	7873676	But they just totally changed it and now it's the PSP one.
7873696	7874936	This is supposed to be the Akito 13.
7875176	7876556	Yeah, but it's not now.
7877316	7878257	I want to play it.
7878337	7879257	I really want to play it.
7879665	7884987	It's probably going to kind of feel like the same universe as XIII, but it won't be like any of the same characters.
7885007	7894850	It'll be like Versus, because Final Fantasy Versus XIII doesn't look like it has shit in common with Final Fantasy XIII, except I'm assuming it takes place on Cocoon.
7895130	7895650	No characters?
7896290	7896430	No.
7896450	7897090	It's all different people?
7897270	7897390	No.
7897410	7899171	I don't even think it takes place on Cocoon.
7900131	7902112	Yeah, so I don't know what the hell... I want to play it when you're done.
7902751	7902911	What?
7903011	7903772	I don't have Versus.
7903832	7904473	I have 13 too.
7904513	7906315	That's what I was talking about.
7906896	7909159	If I get it back in less than a year this time.
7911281	7915386	Honestly, 13 Versus has nothing to do with anything.
7915406	7916467	13 Versus looks good though.
7918390	7919071	It looks really good.
7919391	7921814	Hey, we got an email from PlayStation Network.
7923168	7924409	It's probably a hack email or a phishing email.
7924429	7927691	It's not a hack email, it's that they're changing the PlayStation Network.
7927731	7934655	Info at playstation.messages4.com Yeah, that's a... I did get one for the PlayStation Network.
7934775	7940038	Oh yeah, they're merging PlayStation Network into the Sony Entertainment Network or whatever.
7940498	7942639	The Sony Entertainment Network of You Can't Sue Us.
7944120	7944541	Watch us.
7945241	7949984	I mean, hey, if they give us no reason for legal action, we're not going to say anything.
7950560	7957262	For the record, I have not updated my system, so therefore I have not accepted the end user license agreement yet.
7958682	7961143	I will still sue you if I feel like it.
7961463	7963324	But I will get my southern lawyer.
7963344	7964444	What?
7967997	7969319	Can we miss it?
7969679	7970080	That's it?
7970900	7971321	You're done?
7971721	7972342	No more emails.
7972682	7973103	I'm done.
7973143	7973683	Where's the fork?
7974144	7976226	Alright, let's go to the FUs of the week.
7976286	7978248	Every week on this show we like to get angsty.
7978348	7978709	Why?
7979349	7980471	Because we can.
7998516	8000246	F you to...
8004315	8006896	God, you know, I had it in my head and I forgot what it was.
8006916	8013339	Oh yeah, the girl outside of Whole Foods today who was trying to get me to sign her petition.
8014120	8015580	I normally don't have a problem with that.
8015620	8017021	I'm all for political action.
8017521	8027266	But I don't sign those petitions from people that are just standing outside the door because there's been a lot of issue lately with people trying to get your information and using it against you.
8027946	8030767	And I don't really have... I thought she was legit.
8030807	8032148	I mean, I'm not going to make a judgment on her.
8032768	8033589	I hate football!
8048410	8055151	Don't stop me with- I mean, she didn't know that, but I was like, I was like, if I say I'm in a hurry, the correct response will be, oh, I'm sorry.
8055511	8055811	Bye.
8056551	8056831	Bye.
8057292	8058932	Not trying to start a conversation with me.
8059792	8061232	I'm still not gonna sign your shit.
8061352	8062713	Look at our website when you have a chance.
8064393	8067513	Yeah, I would sign it through the website if I had credentials, you know.
8068234	8072654	But that and how much my feet hurt yesterday, oh my god, okay.
8073354	8075275	But I had a really good time at museums with Becky.
8076055	8076455	Lots of fun.
8077813	8078534	Are they really crowded?
8080055	8084798	We went to the Children's Discovery Museum with Julian in the morning.
8085058	8087100	Don't do it on the freebie day.
8087460	8088360	Just get a membership.
8088380	8089141	It's so much easier.
8091122	8093204	I mean, he had a good time, but it was really crowded.
8094705	8100809	But when we went to the Crocker, we got there right around like, I want to say one something.
8101670	8107314	And it was busy, yeah, but it wasn't prohibitively busy, if you know what I mean.
8107779	8109100	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8129137	8131099	Alright, that was it.
8131239	8134622	You know what they say, and I'm sure they've stolen this from somebody.
8135523	8137985	If it ain't Baroque, then don't fix it.
8138025	8139506	I've heard that before.
8139766	8141688	If it ain't Baroque, it's probably Renaissance.
8142248	8144030	It was from Beauty and the Beast.
8144550	8145611	Yeah, it was Lumiere.
8145931	8146952	Lumiere says it.
8147012	8148673	No, Cogsworth says it.
8148794	8152597	And Becky even quoted that when we were at the Baroque Art.
8152637	8154518	You just quoted Beauty and the Beast, Loki.
8154558	8154999	Yeah, whatever.
8159063	8160044	Let's be real, though.
8160204	8167030	If this program were made up of dancing, you know, housewares, Loki would be the scene clock.
8170333	8172015	I don't want to be Mrs. Potts.
8173836	8174537	Or the cupboard.
8176659	8177279	The wardrobe.
8177359	8178320	Clearly, I'm Lumiere.
8178460	8179221	Alright, moving on.
8180002	8181063	Because you're so French, Rob.
8181963	8182543	I'm on fire.
8183904	8188027	I don't even know if this is really an FU, but I guess it is.
8188647	8193430	I'm just very sick and tired of the whole argument that used games steal away from developers.
8193671	8197653	Okay, let me fucking... I mean, come on, developers, you should know how this fucking works.
8198454	8199254	You make a game.
8199594	8200795	The game gets pressed.
8201475	8204858	The publisher sells the game to the retailer.
8205851	8208212	Therefore, there is money being exchanged there.
8208412	8215674	It is up to the retailer to then sell the game so that they're not out the money that they paid for the game and they make a small profit on top of that.
8216674	8225257	Then maybe, as an incentive, you may get some extra money depending on how well the game sells.
8225837	8233280	That is the only money that is getting eaten up by used game sales and it's a very small fraction of that
8233940	8235461	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8257489	8264331	Yeah, so you can shut the fuck up because you still made your fucking money and used games didn't do shit for you guys.
8265492	8272354	I'm sorry, it's just a stupid argument and I always hear people going, we're stealing money from the developers if we buy used games.
8272694	8272934	No!
8273235	8277516	It does not fucking steal any money from anybody because those games are already goddamn paid for.
8277736	8281838	If they all sat on shelves, they don't fucking care, they have their money already.
8282478	8283438	That's the whole point.
8285179	8285519	That's it.
8287429	8289390	Alright, well, shit, how am I supposed to follow that?
8290031	8293133	F you to... I want pudding.
8293393	8299778	F you to a lot of the same stuff that was bothering me last week, but I want to say thank you to the person who reached out to me on Twitter to talk about that.
8299798	8300638	I thought that was very nice.
8300678	8302179	You know who you are.
8302840	8316510	And I want to say F you to the fact that oh my god, I went to California Pizza Kitchen last night, and granted there was a rather large party of us, but it took an hour and 15 minutes to get a table when we were quoted 30, and then even then they sat us at two separate tables.
8317330	8318051	We'll see you next time.
8339634	8341435	Actually, Becky orders the salads every time we go.
8341455	8343316	That's why they discriminated against you right there.
8344157	8345538	The salads are really good.
8345598	8349700	Yeah, they have a whole page dedicated to salads, and they have really good salads.
8349820	8352762	Like, you wouldn't know it, but... Yeah, I wouldn't know it.
8352922	8355564	It's not California salad kitchen, but it could be.
8355584	8357125	You know what's funny?
8357205	8357445	What?
8357785	8359727	Julian calls his bedroom his pizza kitchen.
8362987	8363988	Listen, we know your type.
8364028	8365449	Fresh Choice is down the street.
8365469	8366570	Get the fuck out of here.
8367291	8368452	That's where I had lunch yesterday.
8368472	8370393	You fags are going to come in here and order salad?
8372195	8373276	That's exactly what happened.
8373296	8374336	You know what that makes me think of?
8374376	8374617	What?
8374797	8376038	Actually, Brack.
8376758	8378980	And she orders something called a salad.
8380900	8382542	That to me is love.
8382642	8391671	The salt on the wound was watching all these high school kids coming in there all dressed up like it's fucking prom or something.
8391791	8393673	Is it prom season?
8393993	8394174	Maybe.
8394474	8394934	Winter ball.
8395335	8398498	Have things come back so much that they're going to graduate next month?
8398538	8400260	Winter ball, I guess, because...
8400980	8411842	I don't know, but there was a hell of people all dressed up and like all these kids and their fancy pants dresses because California Pizza Kitchen is the nice part of town where all the rich spoiled kids live What, Arden?
8412582	8412802	No.
8412922	8413602	You went to the other one?
8413762	8418623	We went to the one where Dave and Buster's is, the Fountains See what I mean?
8418703	8428585	Go to Arden Don't give a shit at Arden Go hang out with the poor people like me at Arden Arden don't give a shit
8429595	8433680	If I'm going to go over there, I'm just going to go to Mikuni, anyway, or Dave & Buster's.
8434300	8436923	We had a party at 9, though.
8436943	8438605	It's hard to find something everybody likes.
8439606	8440927	So we went to California Salad Kitchen.
8441548	8442749	We went to Dave & Buster's.
8444671	8446854	I suggested Dave & Buster's, but I got shot down.
8446874	8447875	They didn't want to do that.
8448900	8449600	Let's be real, though.
8449620	8451483	The food at Dave & Buster's is kind of mediocre.
8452444	8455508	And the night before Super Bowl Sunday, we were kind of afraid it was going to be a mess.
8456669	8459112	Of course, we didn't fare much better at California Pizza Kitchen.
8459132	8464759	But anyway, can we please not turn this into a California Pizza Kitchen show and talk about more news, Loki?
8465700	8479753	So, you know, not to be outdone, I guess, in Monkey See, Monkey Do, or whatever, you know, Sony is pulling another move with the Wii U type controllers.
8480734	8487280	Sony has patented their own Wii U-esque device, and it looks like a tablet.
8487300	8487421	Yeah.
8488041	8489182	What more is there to say?
8490262	8491382	Tablet with buttons on it.
8491522	8494904	Actually, it looks like kind of a cross between a Game Boy and an iPod.
8496004	8497245	And that looks really weird.
8498085	8505168	It shows some augmented reality thing where this guy looks like his character through the tablet.
8505368	8506468	Why do they need to do that?
8506608	8514231	Didn't they just say two weeks ago that the PlayStation Vita was capable of everything that they're saying the whole Wii U will do?
8514750	8515170	I don't know.
8515310	8515950	It looks weird.
8516050	8522072	It looks like it's going to support multiple tablets and that it'll almost be some sort of augmented reality thing.
8524813	8531795	Basically, it's titled the very generic position-dependent gaming 3D controller and handheld as remote.
8532855	8538497	Device would track its own location as input to video game and would render an
8538817	8544958	Avatar on a mobile device such that it appears to overlay a competing user in the real world.
8549879	8550219	I don't know.
8552559	8555520	Maybe it's something that they're going to implement to other tablets?
8556920	8565562	Maybe it'll be a cheaper option as opposed to getting a Vita, but then why would you kind of bite the, you know, take away from one to give to the other?
8565762	8566802	It just seems a little weird.
8568217	8594362	I don't know I do like how the fact that they're a little generic console that they use on there looks like the same console that they have rendered in Grand Theft Auto their like generic Xbox PS3 console it's kind of funny alright well let's move on and talk about speaking of the Vita and all that this is seriously the game that might convince me to get a Vita when the Vita's out which is what like next week or two weeks I think
8594562	8596148	The early release is next week, right?
8597212	8597895	Yeah, Valentine's Day.
8597975	8599280	Day after Valentine's Day.
8600502	8613948	We're not that far away from the Vita launch over here, and I gotta say, this is the game that makes me... Sorry, I get so distracted because there's this giant Gotham City Imposters ad on the page, and it just makes me think about how this really disturbs Jamie.
8613988	8617289	She really doesn't like what this game is doing, even though she's never played it.
8618269	8619450	I just don't like the concept.
8619910	8620350	I know, I know.
8620370	8620991	It won't be fun to me.
8621251	8623712	I downloaded the beta, but I just haven't run it yet.
8624272	8626433	Anyway, the game on the Vita...
8628206	8650283	Luminous, Electronic Symphony I gotta say, the song list looks damn impressive There is 34 tracks in it, and a lot of it is really good licensed stuff There's stuff from Cascade, 4AM is in here, Bang Bang Bang, Mark Ronson Disco Infiltrator by LCD Sound System, Alan will like that
8650623	8669188	Dissolve by the Chemical Brothers, Embracing the Future by BT, Flying High by Faithless, Good Girl by Benny Benassi, Hey Boy Hey Girl by the Chemical Brothers, an Air Song, Milo, Orbital, System F, 808 State, Gold Frap, Aeroplane, Deep Dish, Apex Twin, Pet Shop Boys.
8669649	8670789	This looks fucking great.
8671109	8673750	Like, I'm really excited about this game.
8673830	8677291	So, and a lot of it sounds really awesome.
8677351	8677511	So,
8678391	8684793	Yeah, if you haven't seen the song list for this, you probably want to head over to the Luminous page on Facebook and check this out.
8684813	8694256	Because, yeah, I'm definitely, if I pick up a Vita launch day, which is looking very likely because I did my taxes, and I'm looking good.
8694396	8696557	So I might be able to get one of these when they come out.
8696757	8698717	I don't think my wife would let me.
8699317	8700698	Aw, womp womp.
8701338	8704299	I am considering selling my 3DS to get a Vita.
8704359	8704659	To me.
8707580	8707880	We'll see.
8709656	8710416	Thinking about it, huh?
8711697	8720963	The only drawback to the whole Luminous thing is that I am still feeling a little bit bitter about the fact that I've bought Luminous like five times now.
8721163	8721423	Like what?
8721443	8724805	There was Luminous, Luminous 2, Luminous PC, Luminous Xbox 360.
8725105	8728367	I never did get the PlayStation 3 one, but I seriously thought about it.
8728727	8742597	I'm, I'm not in a huge hurry to get a Vita cause like, you know, the launch games are cool and you know, Konamari might be fun, but it's not a like, there's not anything that I must, must, must, must have on the Vita right now.
8742657	8747260	It's kind of like, well, these are the ones I would pick, but I don't know.
8747540	8752544	It's, I might want to wait, you know, wait until fourth quarter or something like that.
8753746	8756087	I thought Loki was about to say I'm thinking about selling my wife to get it
8783507	8783867	No.
8785488	8785628	No.
8787108	8787769	Can't do that.
8788849	8789890	She'd complain about that.
8790590	8791690	She would not like that.
8791770	8792571	She would not like that.
8793411	8801914	All right, just a few more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to the Twitter topics and the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8802274	8803535	But first, a few more stories.
8803615	8804135	DarkSakura?
8805596	8807596	I actually have to stop and correct Bones006.
8808717	8811338	The letters U-R do not spell anything.
8812697	8813578	It spells er.
8815178	8819601	It's Y-O-U apostrophe R-E.
8820261	8822363	Dear Lord, stop looking ignorant.
8824084	8830187	When you have U-R, that's two-thirds of an earn, which DarkSakura will have you end up in if you don't change your ways.
8833509	8850934	be nice to the listeners Jamie, be nice to the listeners I am being nice I'm doing them a serious favor that will help them get a job and earn the respect of people around them so fuck your Yankee Blue Jeans there was a part where you did video game news mmm
8852054	8861001	Oh yeah, there was a comment by Kaz Harai who's going to be going in as CEO of Sony and he thinks that Sony's kind of in trouble.
8862042	8865505	He spoke with the Wall Street Journal about their financial report.
8865525	8880117	As you remember, they lost like 1.3 billion pounds because I'm going off a British site so in their last financial quarter and expect to report a loss of 2.9 billion dollars for the full year.
8883701	8897678	I thought turning around the PlayStation business was going to be the toughest challenge of my career, but I guess it's not.
8898338	8899480	It's one issue after another.
8899620	8901302	I feel like, holy shit, now what?
8903593	8911078	and saying that his strategy for recovery basically means we're not going to rest on our laurels anymore.
8911138	8913560	We're going to really push the user experience.
8914861	8921285	He says that they need to buckle down and be realistic but people are coming around to the idea even though not everyone's on board.
8922126	8923987	If they don't catch up, they're going to die.
8927386	8933529	This just strikes me really weird that somebody like that would say, holy shit, now what, in an interview.
8933689	8936691	But, I mean, I'm looking at the source in the Wall Street Journal right here.
8936771	8937191	There it is.
8937231	8939032	That's just weird.
8939052	8941653	That strikes me as odd.
8942753	8946395	I mean, we can swear all we want, but we're not CEOs of Sony.
8946655	8948156	And that kid is flipping somebody off.
8950188	8952310	Wow, he totally is in this little preview.
8952411	8952911	I didn't notice that.
8952931	8953512	Trailer for what?
8953892	8954673	Chronicle?
8954933	8957336	Isn't that that movie you were talking about a few weeks ago?
8957917	8958577	You really wanted to see?
8959038	8960059	They came out in theaters this week.
8960079	8960499	Did you know that?
8960519	8962001	It was number one at the box office.
8963263	8963783	You don't say.
8964684	8966746	Did you go see it or did you see it?
8967027	8969329	Just that ad makes me think, fuck you, clouds.
8969770	8969990	I know.
8970130	8971712	Actually, look at the clouds.
8973018	8974038	They're flipping him off too?
8974118	8974419	I don't know.
8974459	8976379	Yeah, it's the cloud's fingers too.
8976980	8977740	That's kind of interesting.
8978340	8980441	Anyway, so back to the story at hand.
8981922	8989305	It's weird that Sony... I mean, I feel like Sony's in a better place now so much more than they were four years ago.
8989345	8992146	They were a hot mess when PlayStation 3 first came out.
8992626	8997308	But now things are getting a little better, but there are still some big falls that they make.
8997448	8998969	I just don't think the move...
9000427	9007098	I mean, as nice as the move is, I do think the move feels a lot better than the Wii, as it should.
9007138	9008460	The technology's a little newer.
9008901	9012467	But they never really came out with that must-have game for it, you know what I mean?
9012847	9014811	Everything kind of felt like a copycat of the Wii.
9015325	9030474	and I think that's part of where a lot of their losses come from but at the same time I pretty much play games on my PS3 almost exclusively right now unless it's like exclusive on 360 or there's people I know on Xbox 360 that I can play the games with
9030954	9034518	or a deliberate multiplayer game and all my friends are playing it on 360.
9036219	9038902	So it's just interesting that Sony is losing all this money.
9041364	9045788	But I guess, now, is this considering other arms of Sony too?
9045908	9053796	Like not just PSP but maybe like, or excuse me, not just like PlayStation and that stuff but like movies?
9054496	9055918	I guess turn that around too?
9056238	9059319	I think it's mostly non-gaming.
9059359	9061100	I think it's more of their electronics.
9061340	9063581	Because their electronics are fucking expensive.
9064181	9067303	I mean, just insanely expensive.
9068323	9076026	As a promotion thing, we got a gift card to Sony, and their shit is so fucking expensive.
9076066	9077827	It's just ridiculous.
9077867	9085150	For stuff that's just half the price for something better elsewhere, it's just such a markup for the brand.
9088621	9093363	Yeah, maybe when they kind of take the JCPenney approach where they'll cut all their prices by 40%.
9093663	9106728	You know, not to say that, I mean, Sony stuff's all right because I have a Sony camera, a Sony camcorder, a Sony sound system, a Sony TV, a Sony PlayStation 3, a Sony PSP.
9106748	9109489	Of course, most of that stuff was given to me for free.
9109949	9113050	But it's not bad.
9113450	9115531	It's just really fucking expensive.
9119851	9146826	JV Mon in chat says four years ago Sony stock was worth double than what it is now after 2009 it's been pretty much downhill since well yeah I mean I don't know I guess maybe just from the limited perspective where I think of Sony I think of PlayStation I think four years ago they were a mess and maybe there was excitement about the PlayStation 3 and all that but you know there were some huge missteps there for a couple years then things got back on the right track and then they just you know they had the move happen they had the hack happen
9147606	9171402	and you know it's like they just kind of keep getting kicked down so mmm they get knocked down but they get up again all right anyhow uh let's do another story Loki um so let's talk a little bit about sales from a company that's struggling so hard to overcome used game sales
9172643	9174125	I feel so bad for these guys.
9174245	9177228	I mean, EA has got it so hard.
9177868	9179490	So hard.
9180691	9185356	FIFA 12 and Battlefield 3 only sold 10 million units.
9185876	9187438	Only 10 million units!
9189110	9190211	How do they manage?
9191092	9195796	Madden, only 5 million units sold since August.
9198378	9199639	Poor struggling company.
9199879	9200740	I feel so bad.
9200760	9201701	I'm gonna go buy a new game.
9201881	9203423	I'm gonna buy all their games brand new.
9204003	9204584	Tomorrow.
9204684	9206745	Just gonna go right out and buy all of them.
9207466	9209606	Just because I think they're doing such a swell job.
9210087	9210487	Or not.
9211667	9216648	Star Wars The Old Republic has sold 200 million copies.
9217048	9218788	And they already have... No, no.
9219208	9219708	I'm sorry, not 200.
9219748	9220409	Thank you.
9220449	9220909	Two million.
9220929	9222149	I'm like, no way.
9223189	9223549	Sorry.
9224229	9226130	Two million households.
9226510	9232631	And 1.7 million are active each day on average per day.
9232791	9233451	That's not bad.
9233491	9247598	I mean, for user base, you know, especially when they talk like, you know, EA came out with their origin numbers where they said they have like 7 million user or is like 7 million user accounts or something like that, which I'm sure a lot lesser that, you know, than that percentage is active.
9247698	9250019	But 1.7 out of 2 million is not bad.
9250179	9250959	To be fair.
9251079	9251560	Yeah.
9251640	9252600	Wow has what?
9252960	9254741	10 million active subscribers right now.
9254781	9256822	And at their peak, they had about 12 million.
9257322	9259483	I don't know how many copies of the game they've sold.
9259603	9260124	I would guess.
9260164	9260824	That's global.
9260844	9261064	Yeah.
9261444	9262285	Yeah, it is global.
9262825	9265587	15 or 20 million, probably at some point.
9265727	9269749	And I mean, everybody can't be on that game every day.
9269789	9272291	I mean, some people do have other things they gotta do.
9272311	9277474	Well, I am one of those people in the gap where I bought the game and I canceled after the first month.
9277854	9279955	I just didn't really want to keep playing.
9281916	9282416	It's alright.
9282536	9286157	I just think the game needs some tweaks and needs some improvements.
9286597	9286957	I don't know.
9287638	9292359	Some things happen in WoW and I'm playing WoW a lot more.
9292419	9300640	And then, of course, EA's had the benefit of some DLC sales.
9300740	9302841	And they've done well with certain types of DLC.
9302881	9307302	In fact, in just three months...
9307862	9316546	FIFA, FIFA 12's ultimate team, DLC, has generated $39 million in microtransactions.
9317607	9321289	That's 69% more than it generated in the same period last year.
9321609	9323450	Gee, I wonder why.
9324730	9328552	I'm sorry, but when I heard EA gloating that statistic, I was like, that's insulting.
9329232	9332414	That is insulting because you know where that money's coming from.
9333979	9336941	You know, like, I don't know.
9337021	9346066	I kind of feel like in order to justify it, EA needed to say, oh, this is subtracting all the, you know, we didn't count the money that, you know, we had to give back because, you know, it was stolen or whatever.
9346547	9347027	Like, it's just...
9348570	9349051	I don't know.
9349071	9350712	That was a really sore spot.
9350932	9357598	I realize their need to gloat to appease the shareholders and all that stuff, but again, fucking stop denying that there's a problem.
9357638	9358159	Stop it.
9358379	9361322	Is EA giving back that money or is Microsoft giving back that money?
9361362	9361902	It's a thing.
9362483	9363624	Who's taking the hit on that?
9364524	9364985	I don't know.
9366146	9367227	It's all digital.
9367347	9370069	I would imagine Microsoft takes back the money from EA.
9370490	9371330	I imagine they have to.
9375854	9396820	and then of course they're saying according to the Chief Financial Officer Eric Brown to put some rough numbers on this if we compare the total digital revenue from FIFA 11 Ultimate Team to what we expect from FIFA 12 Ultimate Team this fiscal year we're looking to see a 25% increase franchise to franchise
9398220	9401224	Yeah, I wonder where the 25% is coming from.
9401705	9405069	Their overall packaged goods units sold is not increasing by 25%.
9409194	9430388	and so we're expanding by a decent margin the microtransaction revenue per user of FIFA and then it's funny because you know like the people covering this it's like yeah we continue to receive complaints nearly every day of non-FIFA players having their accounts hacked to purchase Ultimate Team DLC
9434013	9437036	Oh yeah, I still hear about it on Twitter and I hear about it, you know.
9437316	9442521	Hacked on Xbox, you know, they're still writing down a bunch of... Oh yeah, I forgot about that website.
9442921	9444763	I check it all the time because I'm on their Twitter feed.
9444823	9448807	I check it and they've got 30 stories on there right now and a lot more that get posted.
9449787	9453651	She's kind of running behind on posting all that because she's getting a lot of emails.
9454031	9454292	Sure.
9455152	9457915	And there's some that I saw that were so ridiculous that like,
9458969	9468898	Oh yeah, you know, we were going to give you back your money, but we're not going to because you didn't put your full name on your account.
9469358	9474863	It'd be like if I didn't put Matthew, I put Matt on my account.
9475223	9479567	That's bull because my legal name I don't have on my Xbox and I still got it.
9480461	9482423	Yeah, but see, they pulled that bullshit.
9482744	9483184	Stupid.
9484366	9490654	Alright, I guess I should be thankful that I didn't have quite the nightmare problem a lot of people are having, although it did take a month.
9491495	9494598	That's the average time, 25 days is what I've been hearing.
9494679	9495279	Ridiculous.
9495540	9495760	Anyway...
9496901	9498883	One more ridiculous story for you guys.
9499203	9508449	Remember last week we were talking about the whole Zynga, the rip-off artist where they were making their own Dream Heights was a complete knock-off of Tiny Tower?
9508769	9512132	Well, Zynga finally came out and made a statement on the whole thing.
9512932	9514353	And it went along these lines.
9514513	9520636	Mark Pincus, who's the head of Zynga, quote, you should be careful not to throw stones when you live in glass houses.
9521236	9529259	When you pull the lens back, you saw that their tower game looks similar to five other tower games going all the way back to Sim Tower in the early 1990s.
9532165	9533907	Bullshit.
9534728	9535188	Bullshit.
9535208	9536810	I knew they were going to make that comparison.
9537711	9546200	The comparison of Tiny Tower to SimTower is a lazy, ignorant comparison that tells me you have never played SimTower in your life.
9546861	9552406	Because SimTower was way... I mean, in a way, SimTower is a more complex...
9553287	9554749	Thanks for watching!
9565751	9569895	But there is not nearly the level of micromanaging that there is in SimTower.
9570175	9571676	You know what those games have in common?
9571716	9573418	They're both about skyscrapers.
9573518	9574038	That's it.
9574298	9575379	And they have tower in the name.
9575900	9579443	Like, you don't really manage the people in SimTower.
9579503	9580684	You manage your tower.
9581044	9585488	You manage the escalators, the elevators, what type of businesses you're putting in.
9585928	9586489	It's just...
9586949	9588950	Google didn't create the first search engine.
9588970	9591250	Apple didn't create the first MP3 player or tablet.
9612612	9614913	Facebook didn't create the first social network.
9615433	9619114	But these companies have evolved products and categories in revolutionary ways.
9619874	9624555	They are all internet treasures because they all have specific and broad missions to change the world.
9625096	9628337	If that wasn't blowing smoke up their employees' ass, I don't know what was.
9629357	9631697	Because seriously, how is that the same?
9632858	9633638	How is that the same?
9633898	9634298	It's not.
9634558	9636699	Google didn't create the first search engine.
9637279	9640521	That's true, but they created the best search engine.
9641362	9649086	Okay, so Tiny Tower didn't create the first tower game, but they created a really good one for iOS systems.
9649447	9651548	And you fucking jacked it all and made new art.
9651668	9652128	That's it.
9652329	9656071	Google didn't copy the code for Yahoo and change the name to Google on it.
9657603	9665214	And Google actually has, it's like their whole search process is done by all kinds of different calculations too.
9665715	9667097	I mean, it's really complex.
9669621	9673046	And then they've taken Google and made a full spectrum product out of it.
9673530	9674291	Thanks for watching!
9696295	9709507	Circle Space Circle Breakman in our chatroom says Zynga is currently making a podcast called Red Lounge Radio It will be on the More Than All Games Network He actually fooled somebody in chat Really?
9711748	9716670	Frisbee says, Dear everyone who plays Zynga games, please stop being a person that plays Zynga games.
9716790	9717911	Love humans everywhere.
9718291	9720312	Jvmon brings out the harsh reality.
9720792	9726414	Chat.orange.com saying, Zynga's stock doubled after the Facebook IPO this week.
9726694	9730035	Well, when you see how really dependent they were on each other, as if you didn't already know.
9730336	9735157	I mean, Facebook in their filing basically had to say a lot more about the internal workings of their company.
9735498	9738799	And one of those things is that they kind of fucking rely on Zynga.
9739079	9742680	for people to return visit to Facebook, just like Zynga fucking relies on Facebook.
9742980	9745881	Because didn't Zynga try to make their own portal?
9746361	9751502	I remember there was a time where Zynga was like, well, we don't really... Remember when Google Plus was going to murder everything?
9751962	9754823	And Zynga was like, well, we don't really need Facebook.
9754963	9761125	We're going to get everybody to come to our Zynga game, Zynga book, or whatever they were going to do.
9761705	9763528	Yeah, I can see them doing that shit.
9764689	9766492	We'll make our own social network.
9766512	9767093	That's right.
9767193	9772240	We're just gonna copy-paste Facebook, and we're gonna call it Portrait...
9774019	9775840	Now, one final note on this whole story.
9776020	9779662	Nimblebit, who made Tiny Tower, did not let this all go by unscathed.
9780662	9793288	The co-founder, Ian Marsh, talked to Touch Arcade and said, quote, It was a smart idea for Mark Pincus and Zynga to try and lump all games with the name Tower together as an actual genre whose games borrow from each other.
9793928	9797650	Sharing a name or a setting does not a genre make.
9799651	9799911	Agreed.
9801550	9808353	For example, 13 Ghosts may be about a haunted house, but it's not the same kind of movie as High Spirits, for example.
9810629	9813971	Jamie, is that like saying the movie Independence Day isn't really about the 4th of July?
9844791	9868219	1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio The Skype line is open now Give us a call if you want to talk about anything we've talked about tonight Or maybe there's something we missed that you wanted to bring up Or, hell, I don't know Just call us if you want to say hello We do have a reduced amount of live listeners tonight Because of, you know, football games and so forth But I do see there are some of you listening There in our chat room The few, the loyal

9870180	9870880	So go ahead and call us.
9870900	9875182	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9875863	9876183	All right.
9877143	9878644	Meanwhile, we're going to do some tweets.
9878964	9879244	And what?
9879264	9880305	Do you have something, Loki, you want to add?
9880325	9880865	Just real quick.
9880885	9881826	I just thought this was funny.
9882186	9892311	Apparently, there's a PlayStation Network update that just happened that has blocked users from accessing their paid content in the PAL territories.
9893799	9894019	What?
9894820	9910554	Apparently, it's those who have done the update are getting an error labeled as 800-231-02, which helpfully informs them that no content was found when the user tries to download or re-download PlayStation Network content they've already purchased.
9914053	9917814	Going to our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
9918114	9922116	Not a lot of activities on Twitter either, although there were some nice tweets.
9922156	9923996	I'll read some of these nice tweets that are there.
9924656	9926997	Breakman says, I might show up later for OLR.
9927097	9929198	I'll be pretty drunk though, so good luck to them.
9930179	9936121	And CurlyKTK on Twitter says, putting the Super Bowl on mute to listen to OLR.
9936701	9937181	Good job.
9937661	9938101	Good job.
9938682	9940742	All right, we do have some calls coming in, so let's go to the phones.
9940782	9941743	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9941763	9942143	Who's this?
9943086	9947468	Hey, it's the guy who's normally CD Thunder in chat, but tonight I'm God of Thunder.
9947508	9948209	How are you all doing?
9948529	9948769	Good.
9948829	9949669	How are you, God of Thunder?
9951110	9951731	Not too bad.
9951771	9953912	I've got a couple quick things I'd like to talk about.
9954992	9955933	Yeah, what do you want to talk about?
9957333	9959615	First off, quickly, I'd like to talk about Darkness 2.
9960715	9961215	Darkness 2.
9962696	9964857	Is this the one that's coming out, or is this the one that was out?
9964877	9967119	This is the one that's coming out on Tuesday.
9967339	9969400	Okay, what do you want to talk about Darkness 2?
9971021	9999338	well from what I've seen in the demo this game looks completely over the top and gory and sick and it just looks really awesome I wish I could actually play it but that's a man who thinks like this the game looks over the top and gory and disgusting and I love it that's like how I felt after I played the Bayonetta demo oh so are you going to pre-order your copy of Darkness 2?
10001249	10007615	Well, as I said before, I don't actually have the system to play it on, but if I did, I would.
10007855	10008656	Well, you know what you have to do?
10008676	10009696	You're going to have to steal one.
10010397	10011578	No, I'm just kidding.
10011638	10012099	Don't steal.
10012579	10013140	No, no, no.
10013620	10013880	All right.
10016703	10020626	Well, maybe, do you have a friend who might buy it?
10020666	10023328	Sometimes we have a rich friend who has all that stuff.
10023809	10028353	Growing up, I didn't get a Super Nintendo when they first came out, but my rich friend did, so I'd go over to his house.
10029571	10033614	Well, I don't know if anybody that I know would get it or not.
10033694	10034595	I just really don't know.
10035095	10035795	Ah, all right.
10035835	10036396	Well, that's all right.
10037216	10058862	But the other thing I'd like to talk about quickly is I was talking to a friend of mine today and apparently can actually get a classic Nintendo Entertainment System controller USB and plug it into your USB port in a computer and use that to play Nintendo Entertainment System games on the website I linked to the chat room a few minutes earlier.
10059002	10059982	What was the website?
10060002	10061043	Because you sent us the email.
10061063	10062243	You're the same guy who sent us the email.
10062263	10063083	We didn't get the website.
10063123	10063543	What is it?
10063823	10066024	It's retrouprising.com
10066644	10068945	Now, is this going to install porn bots on my computer?
10069145	10074347	Because you know how some of these emulation sites are just, they carry porn bots.
10074667	10078808	And, you know, one minute I'm playing Super Mario Brothers and the next minute, Vagina!
10080149	10082350	No, I've tested out some of this stuff.
10082490	10082930	A lot of it works.
10082970	10083610	Extensively?
10085431	10085631	Yeah.
10085851	10086051	Okay.
10086511	10087052	Just checking.
10088292	10093754	Well, what retro games have you rediscovered through the websites?
10094844	10099607	Well, they have stuff like Ice Climber, Donkey Kong, stuff like that.
10099687	10104811	But some of the Super Nintendo games, you actually have to have an emulator, I believe.
10105572	10106913	Which, unfortunately, I do not have.
10110815	10113757	But you have the internet one, right?
10113797	10114498	Through the website?
10116584	10128348	Well, I'm able to do the Sega Genesis and the Nintendo Entertainment System games, but for some reason it says it has a bar that shows the emulator is loading, then they get a black screen.
10129208	10132990	Maybe update Java or try a different browser?
10133290	10133670	I don't know.
10133790	10134510	That's what I would do.
10135651	10138271	Or it's installing Vagina all over your computer.
10138492	10139652	That could be what's happening.
10139712	10142973	I'm just saying, you've got to be very careful about some of these websites.
10142993	10144394	You've got an infestation of Vagina.
10144474	10144954	That's right.
10146294	10152000	But yeah, I'll probably get the NES controller and use that to play some of those NES games, which are pretty awesome.
10152420	10154942	Are you going to get one of those NES controllers that's like just a USB?
10155763	10155963	Yeah.
10156424	10156784	Gotcha.
10157765	10158486	Alright, very cool.
10159166	10161469	Alright, well, any other thoughts before we let you go?
10163769	10169031	Hmm, well, I hope you guys continue doing what you're doing for quite a while.
10169531	10180055	You guys keep all of us entertaining, me included, and just history of good health and so forth and so on, et cetera, et cetera.
10180315	10181015	That's pretty much it.
10181075	10182696	Well, we appreciate it.
10182916	10186597	It's kind comments like that that keep us going because, you know, we don't make any money off this show.
10186638	10187838	That's why I have to have rich friends.
10189318	10190239	Alright, have a good one.
10190960	10191460	Yeah, you too.
10191600	10191881	Later.
10192021	10192241	Bye.
10192501	10192741	Bye.
10204400	10206502	Meanwhile, more Twitter topics.
10206562	10211107	TigerClaw, always sending us a few stories that we may have overlooked.
10212268	10213949	TigerClaw on Twitter tweets us this.
10214510	10219094	Apple removes several iOS copycat games from one offending developer.
10219475	10220295	So finally...
10221236	10230259	This is funny that all the stuff we were talking about last week about the whole copycat crap is starting to kind of come to light and Apple's taking action against some of it.
10230699	10231059	Let's see.
10232580	10235061	Again, I'm reading this story for the first time because TigerClock sent it to us.
10235101	10236081	It's from Gamasutra.
10236721	10243963	It says, Apple struck a blow against video game clones today by removing several offending apps from one rather prolific independent developer.
10244524	10247725	The games were Plant vs. Zombie.
10247745	10247825	What?
10249465	10266933	as in the one plant against one zombie, Angry Ninja Birds, and Temple Jump, which is a knockoff of a game called Temple Run, which is funny because Temple Jump actually was having some success on the App Store, and yeah, we actually got all the way to the top of the paid app chart.
10267713	10274316	The independent developer of the game is Anton Sinekov, and according to a Twitter post from another iOS developer,
10274736	10281619	This developer had 68 iOS apps available this morning and now only 9 remain.
10282879	10283159	Wow.
10284700	10285120	Let's see.
10285941	10296705	One of the developers who was copied in this case, Imanji, says we were really happy with how quickly Apple responded to the situation and removed Temple Jump.
10297185	10303728	The app was clearly a scam that traded entirely on the popularity of Temple Run and was packaged to confuse users.
10305680	10306120	Booyah.
10307422	10308883	Mulkart's gone now, right?
10309523	10312786	Now, my question is, when are they going to start taking down the Zynga games?
10312906	10313587	Probably never.
10313947	10316029	But anyway, we're getting another call, so let's go to the phones.
10316429	10317550	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10317570	10317931	Who's this?
10320213	10320773	Tesla.
10321674	10322555	Log in and play.
10325618	10330562	Are you calling to harass me to get me to come play WoW when I'm trying to do a show on the internets?
10333784	10335686	Who told you how to find my show?
10338148	10339409	I don't even have to ask.
10341531	10343032	Let me ask you some questions.
10343052	10345054	First off, introduce yourself to the listeners.
10345334	10346455	Who am I speaking with?
10348157	10351720	For all four of you out there who are listening, this is Melodule.
10352841	10357005	I play with your gracious host on a game called World of Warcraft.
10357532	10358873	Dude, I need a port I need all those things and a port
10383146	10385848	He needs a port, so I have to sign in.
10385908	10387349	Welcome to my life.
10387529	10389050	I know, because this is the funny thing.
10389270	10394172	DarkSakura plays an arcane mage on Alliance side, and now I have this arcane mage on Horde.
10394493	10395093	Port, please.
10395313	10395973	Port, please.
10396754	10397014	5G.
10397474	10401997	Well, I'll do that since that's like, what, 500% inflation?
10402237	10405458	Now I've learned after your story earlier this evening, I'll never get paid for it.
10405598	10408820	People will just swindle me like you did that poor death knight.
10409040	10410981	No, you make them pay you, and then you open the portal.
10411282	10411582	I see.
10413423	10417825	Exactly Well look, Meloduel, do you play any other video games besides WoW?
10419847	10437317	I, I, oh wait, I gotta turn myself down here because I didn't hear myself talking Yeah, it's always a little awkward, especially when there's a huge delay Right, even though I do sound pretty good on the radio Maybe I should have my own radio show Me too, me too, that's why I've been doing this so long is I sound great on the radio I'm just like listening to himself talk I do, I do
10438453	10449086	Well, hey, at the risk of completely losing all of my sex life by admitting these things, I will admit to playing a little Final Fantasy here and there.
10450347	10451168	What else do I play?
10451289	10453171	I was a huge, huge EverQuest.
10453803	10453943	R.I.P.
10453963	10455544	EverQuest, R.I.P.
10455584	10457505	There actually was a Final Fuck X in Japan.
10484431	10484831	Perfect.
10485251	10486052	I have this.
10486592	10488553	It's basically just bad cosplay boinging.
10488593	10492615	Yeah, it's basically just chicks dressed up as the characters in Final Fantasy X and they get fucked.
10492675	10496877	But this weird thing about Japanese porn is that they have to blur the penetration.
10498537	10499718	Oh, yeah, yeah.
10500238	10501539	And then the guys aren't dressed up.
10501639	10503660	The guys are just like, hey, I'm here to fuck Yuna.
10503820	10504100	Okay.
10505341	10510383	Well, see, you've got to be careful because if you don't blur it, you could have an infestation of a vagina.
10511124	10511784	That's true.
10511904	10512244	That's true.
10512264	10513245	Just like the last caller.
10513305	10516205	If you're on a bad website, you just, you know, knock, knock.
10516225	10516526	Who's there?
10517046	10518606	Too much vagina is never a good thing.
10519546	10520567	You want it in moderation.
10520687	10521367	Never.
10522187	10522487	Never.
10522767	10523327	Never.
10523688	10524248	So, yeah.
10525348	10526028	Yeah, totally.
10526088	10528529	That's that's those are the games that I played for a while.
10529102	10529882	I loved Tactics.
10529922	10531883	That was my big thing.
10531963	10534423	Final Fantasy Tactics was a great game.
10534623	10536584	Final Fantasy Tactics was awesome.
10536804	10540725	They have the versions on what systems?
10541245	10543645	Game Boy Advance had one and then they ported it.
10544586	10547966	There's another one on... It escapes me.
10547986	10548807	Didn't they make another port?
10549127	10549787	It was a PSP.
10549907	10552448	Yeah, there was a PSP.
10554388	10555188	Yeah, that was the only one.
10555728	10555948	I loved...
10558956	10565437	Final Fantasy 2, the US version where it was like Final Fantasy 3 or something in Japan.
10565497	10566197	They couldn't get it right.
10566217	10566658	I don't know.
10567678	10569198	It was awesome.
10569218	10569558	You know what?
10569678	10573319	I will stop harassing you and let you get to your radio show.
10573699	10573979	All right.
10574279	10574899	I appreciate it.
10575319	10577600	Totally cut it short because I need a port.
10578080	10578400	All right.
10579200	10583461	Well, you might have to buy one unless you want to wait until about 11 o'clock my time when I'll finally sign in.
10585271	10586051	All right.
10586752	10587313	Have a good one.
10587693	10587753	Bye.
10587793	10592018	And I'm really sorry that now you're not going to get laid for like six weeks because you admitted things on air.
10594933	10597654	I'll talk to you later.
10597774	10597914	Bye.
10597934	10600895	1-877-GAME-OLR Use the name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio.
10601235	10604156	It's very amusing.
10604296	10604936	Don't let it fool you.
10604976	10605896	He's a total asshole.
10605976	10606536	No, I'm kidding.
10606576	10606916	I'm kidding.
10606956	10607437	I'm kidding.
10607597	10611938	You know, I've actually been... I like everybody in that guild so far.
10612718	10614118	They've been pretty nice people.
10614379	10615919	Except for that Shane guy.
10616299	10616919	Yeah, he's an ass.
10618380	10618980	But the first...
10619600	10625044	The first, like I joined that guild because I knew that they were doing some raiding and that they were just starting.
10625064	10627586	And I was like, all right, well, you know, because nothing's happening on Alliance.
10627626	10627866	Why not?
10627886	10629487	I'm going to try this to work out my horde.
10629987	10635792	The first night I went on the raid with the group, I was like, this might be a bit of a hot mess.
10636032	10636492	I don't know.
10637293	10642116	But, you know, the next week, actually, we raided again last and it was really good.
10642316	10645598	And I think like, you know, they made some tweaks to the group and it really worked.
10645699	10647280	And we cleared like five bosses in one night.
10647320	10647880	So it's a good time.
10648400	10649001	On Firelands?
10649321	10650061	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10670051	10672133	I want that on my mage because I have the tier 12 bonus.
10672153	10673534	But anyway, sorry.
10673554	10678038	This discussion is getting a little too Horde House, which by the way is the other Warcraft show I do sometimes.
10678118	10679079	I want to be on soon.
10679319	10681221	www.hordehouse.com I'm going to be honest.
10681261	10682522	Let's have some real talk for a minute.
10682622	10684303	I don't know when there's going to be another episode of Horde House.
10684724	10687927	Because like, Extifer is now like busy on the weekends all the time.
10687947	10689248	Because I don't...
10689788	10694950	I don't know if I should say this, but he's seeing... He's got an infestation of vaginas.
10695870	10700692	Yes, he has an infestation of a vagina all week.
10700752	10703953	No, he's seeing a boy, and I met the boy the other night, and he's really cool.
10704013	10708375	So I don't want to, you know... So, you know, I don't know what's going to happen.
10708415	10711276	So it's going to be really hard for us to kind of like coordinate our schedules and so forth.
10711356	10712476	And plus, he's not playing WoW.
10713176	10713376	So...
10715942	10718745	So we have to get guests that can fill in the gaps and so forth.
10718786	10721429	I'll be more than happy to fill in if you want to record soon.
10721449	10722230	I know, I know.
10722470	10728217	We'll work something out, but it's just don't expect Horde House every week, sadly, until we get some of this stuff worked out.
10729178	10732162	Especially like a common date and time and all that.
10733223	10733503	Alright.
10734384	10737386	Tiger Claw in chat says, I bet Rob is strict and mean in the guild.
10737426	10740127	When someone underperforms, he'll yell at them like a drill sergeant.
10741488	10742008	I don't yell.
10742049	10742589	That's funny.
10744410	10746591	What are you doing going to that side?
10746631	10747632	We said this one.
10747672	10748492	No, that's not Rob.
10748692	10750273	No, I don't really do that.
10750814	10754055	I like to think I'm fair and I'm nice and I'm patient.
10754696	10755977	I'm very fucking patient.
10756617	10760099	But I get to these moments where I fucking snap.
10761760	10762860	This is what Rob sounds like.
10763760	10768622	I'm going to do the, what was the boss in Blackrock?
10769783	10770363	Nefarian?
10770383	10770943	Nefarian.
10771263	10772304	This is Rob on Nefarian.
10772584	10773384	Okay, get to the platform.
10774065	10775325	Okay, don't forget to interrupt.
10776025	10777406	You interrupt, you interrupt, you interrupt.
10778526	10779327	Okay, are you healing?
10780127	10780587	What happened?
10780607	10781427	What happened to your mana?
10781788	10782348	Are you healing?
10784096	10784597	What was that?
10784878	10785400	Why did we wipe?
10785941	10787846	Okay, I think we wiped because this, this, this, and this.
10788347	10789130	Alright, let's try it again.
10789771	10790874	Get to the platform!
10792478	10792839	That's wrong.
10794127	10794968	A little bit, a little bit.
10795868	10796189	All right.
10797830	10798230	Let's see.
10798390	10800252	Another story here from the Twitter.
10800292	10802633	Twitter.com slash OLR.
10802734	10805295	Tigerclaw sends us this link.
10806056	10809379	Nintendo Zone to feature full episodes of Pokemon.
10810019	10810740	Yay!
10811820	10816664	3DS owners get free Wi-Fi access at 29,000 Nintendo Zone locations.
10816964	10818726	Oh, that's that new channel on my 3DS.
10818766	10820087	I can't figure out what it's used for.
10820107	10820947	Okay.
10822128	10825629	Nintendo Zone will offer much more content for 3DS owners.
10825949	10831431	There will be a dedicated Pokemon section that will feature full length episodes of the Pokemon TV series.
10832251	10835712	And yeah, McDonald's or Starbucks are both Nintendo Zone partners.
10836032	10839393	That's actually kind of cool, especially if I can get like old school Pokemon episodes.
10839693	10841614	Like remember when I had all those Pokemon DVDs?
10841694	10843134	I still do have some of them up there.
10843294	10843594	I know.
10844355	10845155	You know what I have, Rob?
10845515	10845675	What?
10846435	10849336	Japanese Digimon DVDs.
10852097	10855138	For the record, OLR has a one in three occurrence of vagina.
10856479	10856619	Ah.
10858399	10858720	All right.
10859520	10862001	Well, our Skype line, unfortunately, isn't ringing anymore.
10862041	10865162	I guess... They've come down with the vagina.
10865342	10870044	I guess people just wanted to call and yell at me or talk about old games.
10870324	10871044	So that's all right.
10871304	10872685	They've come down with the cases.
10872765	10874746	Our usual callers are at their Super Bowl parties.
10874806	10875206	It's fine.
10875226	10875786	I understand.
10876026	10877007	Hey, Loki, join the chat room.
10879750	10882732	It's the artist behind Every Little Step, Bobby Blackpool.
10883153	10884474	Speaking of the stupor bowl.
10885855	10886135	All right.
10886735	10888036	Sorry, it's super bowels.
10888136	10889037	We're going to wrap it up.
10889257	10890078	We're getting out of here.
10890218	10894621	But before we get out of here for the night, last minute stories.
10894941	10896683	Loki, do you have anything you want to share for last minute stories?
10897743	10899024	Just one small thing.
10899264	10902605	I noticed that Joystick had posted a little thing about this game.
10903226	10904586	It's a free indie game.
10906287	10910009	And it's a really oddly named game called The Cat That Got Milk.
10911089	10912209	The Cat That Got The Milk.
10913630	10917492	Not necessarily what it sounds like, but it's a free game.
10917992	10918593	Go check it out.
10920273	10929718	It's pretty short, only 10-15 minutes, but it's thecatthatgothemilk.com and it looks pretty awesome based on the trailer.
10933482	10934743	My final thought is Jigglypuff.
10964249	10966610	That's going to do it, guys, for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
10966650	10971932	Thank you guys so much for downloading and listening to our show, even if it was just to yell at me that you needed a port somewhere.
10973292	10974893	We're going to do this all again next week.
10975013	10975893	You know what we ask.
10975933	10982495	If you've enjoyed what you hear here at Orange Launch Radio, remember we don't have a big magazine backing us with millions of dollars.
10982575	10983876	We don't have all these ads and stuff.
10984176	11010167	you know all we ask tell a friend about the show help spread the word of Orange Lounge Radio and we'll come back to do it all again next week so next week I'm hoping to talk a little more in depth about Soul Calibur 5 after I get some more hands on time with it I don't know what my co-hosts will be playing hands on maybe get some time in with Evita if I know anyone that gets one early we'll see I'll have to go find my rich friends but until then that's going to do it myself DarkSakura and Loki saying goodnight
11011454	11011934	See you next week!
