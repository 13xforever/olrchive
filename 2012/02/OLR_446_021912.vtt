00:00.000 --> 00:19.600
Tonight, February 19th, 2012, Capcom makes the same mistake twice.

00:19.600 --> 00:24.480
Sony plans a movie for one of its franchises, and one company is rumored to be working on

00:24.480 --> 00:31.680
a new Ninja Turtles game.

00:31.680 --> 00:35.240
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.240 --> 00:39.660
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.660 --> 00:47.440
We are live on this February 19th, 2012, with episode number 446 of our show.

00:47.440 --> 00:53.440
We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after

00:53.440 --> 00:57.440
the Bobby Black Wolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

00:57.440 --> 01:02.200
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts here

01:02.200 --> 01:03.260
with me as always.

01:03.260 --> 01:07.000
Say hello first off to the one, the only, dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Hi.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
How are you Jamie?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Caffeinated.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Well caffeinated.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Awake?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Awake.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Well I started falling asleep on the way over here.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Buzzing?

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
I was bored before I got here.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
That's not good.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Falling asleep while you drive, that's not good.

01:18.000 --> 01:27.760
No, but then I was like, Starbucks, I can go there, wow, so yeah.

01:27.760 --> 01:31.640
Alright, also joining us tonight, I don't know if he's caffeinated, but say hello to

01:31.640 --> 01:32.960
Techmaster Loki.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.080
I think I'm caffeinated, this has caffeine in it.

01:35.080 --> 01:37.640
You do have a jumbo little soda, what soda is that?

01:37.640 --> 01:42.600
It's more ice than soda, it's the McDonald's ripoff there.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.400
There you go.

01:44.400 --> 01:49.440
So anyway, join us live, if you are listening live here at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock

01:49.440 --> 01:52.320
Eastern at all games, join our chat room.

01:52.320 --> 01:56.480
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com is where you can interact with us, because of course it is

01:56.480 --> 02:00.320
the show where every gamer has a voice, we do like to read your voices throughout the

02:00.320 --> 02:04.640
show and we'll take your calls later, read your emails and all that good stuff.

02:04.640 --> 02:08.800
Looking in our chat, we see some people are celebrating being able to be here live tonight

02:08.800 --> 02:12.600
because they have tomorrow off, and I totally forgot that it's a three day weekend.

02:12.600 --> 02:16.640
So happy President's Day I suppose, but I don't have tomorrow off.

02:16.640 --> 02:17.640
Me neither.

02:17.640 --> 02:18.640
Isn't that weird?

02:18.640 --> 02:22.040
I have tomorrow off.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.880
Always ruining my party.

02:23.880 --> 02:24.880
Because I'm fun-employed.

02:24.880 --> 02:28.600
You have every day off.

02:28.600 --> 02:30.680
But yeah, what's up with that?

02:30.680 --> 02:31.920
We don't get President's Day off.

02:31.920 --> 02:33.600
I did at my old company too.

02:33.600 --> 02:37.200
Well I think the deal is, unless you're a bank or a school or something, your company

02:37.200 --> 02:40.440
either does Martin Luther King Day in January, which mine does.

02:40.440 --> 02:41.440
I don't get that either.

02:41.440 --> 02:42.440
Really?

02:42.440 --> 02:43.440
You got screwed.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.080
I don't know what to tell you.

02:45.080 --> 02:49.520
One place I was with, we used to get floaters for the major bank holidays.

02:49.520 --> 02:54.080
Yeah, we have what's called a floating holiday too in place of Veterans Day.

02:54.080 --> 02:58.560
We don't get Veterans Day off, but we can take a floating holiday any time during the

02:58.560 --> 03:02.360
year, which I usually use to cover my E3 trip the years I've gone.

03:02.360 --> 03:06.240
I don't know if that'll happen this year, but you know what?

03:06.240 --> 03:08.240
I don't know if E3 will happen this year.

03:08.240 --> 03:10.040
It really depends on a number of factors.

03:10.040 --> 03:16.240
Well, A, I'm probably not going to get in, but B, even like last year, I would go just

03:16.240 --> 03:21.640
to see Bobby and anybody else I know that's going to the event to do a Disney thing, if

03:21.640 --> 03:22.640
they're going.

03:22.640 --> 03:23.640
We need to do D3.

03:23.640 --> 03:24.640
Yeah, yeah.

03:24.640 --> 03:25.640
Seriously.

03:25.640 --> 03:26.640
I'm at the Disney convention.

03:26.640 --> 03:30.600
But I am seriously, seriously... I haven't done this convention in four years, but this

03:30.600 --> 03:34.640
year I really, really, really... Of course, so much of this depends on finances.

03:34.640 --> 03:39.800
I want to do PACS this year, so I'm definitely looking into doing that.

03:39.800 --> 03:40.800
PACS West, of course.

03:40.800 --> 03:44.640
I went to... The last PACS I went to was the first PACS East a couple years ago.

03:44.640 --> 03:46.800
I would love to go if someone would finance me.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.720
She's... Well, we don't have OLR funds anymore.

03:49.720 --> 03:52.340
We could do the Kickstarter thing.

03:52.340 --> 03:53.340
It works for Double Fine.

03:53.340 --> 03:56.760
Kickstarter so I can go to PACS.

03:56.760 --> 03:59.480
Donate $20 and Dark Sakura will sign your butt.

03:59.480 --> 04:00.480
There you go.

04:00.480 --> 04:01.480
At PACS.

04:01.480 --> 04:02.480
At PACS.

04:02.480 --> 04:03.480
All right.

04:03.480 --> 04:05.480
We'll figure something out.

04:05.480 --> 04:11.240
Anyhow, let's talk games, video games, and this week, of course, the big, big story in

04:11.240 --> 04:12.240
gaming.

04:12.240 --> 04:13.240
PlayStation Vita.

04:13.240 --> 04:14.240
No incur.

04:14.240 --> 04:15.240
Come on.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.120
Kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding.

04:17.120 --> 04:18.640
I'm like, are you insane?

04:18.640 --> 04:19.840
You saw that screen, too.

04:19.840 --> 04:20.840
That's a beautiful screen.

04:20.840 --> 04:23.200
It was pretty, but... That's the first time you've seen the Vita,

04:23.200 --> 04:24.200
right?

04:24.200 --> 04:25.200
Mm-hmm.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.320
What I'm referring to, Loki is an early adopter of the Vita.

04:27.320 --> 04:30.400
The Vita early adopter program started this week.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.720
Very strange for a console launch.

04:31.720 --> 04:35.440
I don't remember any console doing this before, but it's the whole like, pay an extra $50

04:35.440 --> 04:37.040
and get it a week early.

04:37.040 --> 04:41.200
Yeah, you get like a case and a crappy game.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.560
And yeah, Little Deviants is not a good game.

04:43.560 --> 04:44.560
Yeah.

04:44.560 --> 04:45.880
It's a terrible game, to be honest.

04:45.880 --> 04:48.280
Yeah, I have not heard a good thing about Little Deviants.

04:48.280 --> 04:51.360
So what made you take the plunge to get the early Vita?

04:51.360 --> 04:52.920
I just wanted... I wanted the Vita.

04:52.920 --> 05:00.000
I decided, you know, I was gonna sell my 3DS, and so I did that, and I bought a Vita, and

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
I'm glad I did.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.200
I think I'm gonna get a lot more use out of this than I will ever my 3DS.

05:05.200 --> 05:08.440
What is making you think those early signs?

05:08.440 --> 05:12.680
It... there's... with the 3DS, it was just kind of like, ooh, 3D, and then that kind

05:12.680 --> 05:14.840
of wore off really fast.

05:14.840 --> 05:20.800
And then it's like, ooh, it's just a DS with an analog stick, you know.

05:20.800 --> 05:26.280
I just didn't really play anything on there that, you know, I played a couple, you know,

05:26.280 --> 05:30.200
the launch games, which are kind of like, okay, pilot wings, fun.

05:30.200 --> 05:34.760
Or you know, Street Fighter was all right, you know, but it wasn't really kind of something

05:34.760 --> 05:37.360
that I really could get into.

05:37.360 --> 05:41.200
And then the Mario games came out, and I'm like, okay, well, Mario Kart and Super Mario

05:41.200 --> 05:45.280
3D Land, you know, this is gonna be something that like, oh my God, you know, this is gonna

05:45.280 --> 05:46.280
really make it for me.

05:46.280 --> 05:51.400
But... and I played those, and they were okay, but then I was like looking ahead, well,

05:51.400 --> 05:56.160
what games are I'm actually gonna be looking forward to on the 3DS?

05:56.160 --> 06:02.400
And the only thing I could come up with was Kid Icarus, and that's it.

06:02.400 --> 06:06.440
I mean, I was afraid that it was gonna go kind of the way of the Wii.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.680
You just didn't have enough people to swap note with.

06:08.680 --> 06:09.680
That was the problem.

06:09.680 --> 06:11.840
You needed more 3D cats in your life.

06:11.840 --> 06:14.640
I just added like three chatters to my 3DS friends list tonight.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.280
In fact, I need to send them cats.

06:16.280 --> 06:20.880
As soon as I get the confirmation that they've all added me back, 3D cats.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.080
That's why you hang on to the 3DS.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.080
Swap note.

06:24.080 --> 06:25.080
Revolutionary.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.080
I... no.

06:26.080 --> 06:27.080
No.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.080
I'm sorry.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.080
That's not why.

06:29.080 --> 06:32.720
It's like 3D email.

06:32.720 --> 06:37.160
And then the virtual console stuff is kind of cool, but once again it's like, okay, yeah,

06:37.160 --> 06:38.160
neat.

06:38.160 --> 06:42.120
You know, I can play NES games on another system.

06:42.120 --> 06:45.400
But I don't really need to play NES games.

06:45.400 --> 06:50.160
If I really want to play Nintendo games, I can play them on my PC.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.960
I can play them on my Wii.

06:51.960 --> 06:54.360
I can play them on almost anything.

06:54.360 --> 06:55.360
My PSP.

06:55.360 --> 07:01.960
Well, for me, I wanted to hang on to the 3DS mostly because a system is only as good as

07:01.960 --> 07:02.960
the games that are on it.

07:02.960 --> 07:07.920
And I know you are not as invested in the lineup, but remember, I thought Mario 3D Land

07:07.920 --> 07:09.400
was one of the best games that came out last year.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.440
I put it in my top three for the year.

07:11.440 --> 07:14.840
And I think it's a fantastic game, and I don't really want to part with it yet.

07:14.840 --> 07:21.640
And I don't know, Nintendo is getting really good at this whole stealthy launch.

07:21.640 --> 07:25.480
Like I think at E3 there's going to be some more titles that are announced that will be

07:25.480 --> 07:26.480
banged up.

07:26.480 --> 07:27.480
I'm hoping the Smash Brothers game.

07:27.480 --> 07:28.480
But we'll see.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.040
I'm not going to get my hopes up.

07:30.040 --> 07:35.000
I'm not, I'm not really, I'm not worried about the Smash Brothers game.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.080
If I really want a Smash Brothers game like that, I can play it on the Wii or something.

07:39.080 --> 07:42.920
And honestly, Smash Brothers was fun for a while on the Wii, and then I just didn't play

07:42.920 --> 07:43.920
it anymore.

07:43.920 --> 07:48.600
So I'm not, I don't know, I just don't see myself doing that.

07:48.600 --> 07:53.000
However with the Vita, I can see myself, I can definitely see some more of the games

07:53.000 --> 07:57.040
that I would normally play on it coming out for the Vita.

07:57.040 --> 08:00.240
Like Call of Duty is going to be coming out for it.

08:00.240 --> 08:03.840
A Grand Theft Auto is most definitely going to be coming out for it at some point.

08:03.840 --> 08:06.880
You know, probably A Saint's Row the next time around.

08:06.880 --> 08:09.120
That kind of stuff.

08:09.120 --> 08:14.320
Walk us through a little bit of opening up the Vita for the first time, because my understanding

08:14.320 --> 08:19.280
is A, it doesn't function at all like a Playstation, because the cross-media bar's not there.

08:19.280 --> 08:23.560
And B, it has this whole like, welcome park or something it's called that's supposed to

08:23.560 --> 08:24.560
orient you to the system?

08:24.560 --> 08:27.400
I have not even touched that yet, to be honest.

08:27.400 --> 08:28.400
Alright, fine.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.520
But yeah, there's the welcome park thing.

08:30.520 --> 08:36.440
Basically when you, as with most like, systems out there nowadays, when you first get the

08:36.440 --> 08:39.920
Vita, you have to do a system update.

08:39.920 --> 08:45.780
So you perform the system update, and you update to 1.6, and then you set up everything,

08:45.780 --> 08:49.120
your Playstation Network stuff, if you have an account or whatever.

08:49.120 --> 08:53.280
I had to reset the password on mine, because it had been so long since I logged into the

08:53.280 --> 08:54.640
Playstation Network.

08:54.640 --> 08:59.400
I had forgotten my password, although I hadn't really forgotten my password, it was just

08:59.400 --> 09:04.840
forcing me to reset my password, because I apparently haven't, no actually no, I must

09:04.840 --> 09:10.360
have reset my password at one point, because I downloaded those, the sorry we broke the

09:10.360 --> 09:12.000
Playstation Network for a month.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.240
I had trouble recalling my password after that too, because they had so many freaking

09:16.240 --> 09:22.200
rules on the password, I had to think of something that fell into those, because my old password,

09:22.200 --> 09:27.040
without trying to give it away, well I don't use it anymore, but it broke one of the rules.

09:27.040 --> 09:28.600
So I had to really think.

09:28.600 --> 09:32.880
Well, I finally remembered it was, it was just, there was a capital letter in there

09:32.880 --> 09:35.920
somewhere, so I was like, ah okay, I forgot.

09:35.920 --> 09:41.880
So I went ahead and did that, and so I got that all taken care of, and then I, pretty

09:41.880 --> 09:48.520
much what I did, because I actually got it, I got it on Valentine's Day, because I'm cool

09:48.520 --> 09:54.680
like that, and so there wasn't really much on the Playstation Network store to download,

09:54.680 --> 10:03.240
I mean it was, I don't even think any demos were up yet at that time, it was just full

10:03.240 --> 10:06.920
game purchases for the first party stuff.

10:06.920 --> 10:12.280
It wasn't until like midnight, well midnight eastern time, that all the demos started coming

10:12.280 --> 10:18.680
up for Ubisoft games and some of the launch day stuff.

10:18.680 --> 10:26.040
So it's gorgeous, that was the first thing I noticed, you know, the screen's just amazing

10:26.040 --> 10:29.640
looking and the touchscreen stuff works great.

10:29.640 --> 10:33.880
You know, I don't even really care that it's the little bubbles on there, I mean it's,

10:33.880 --> 10:39.440
just the way it functions is really smooth, so that was kinda cool.

10:39.440 --> 10:45.280
The near things neat, although I'm not really sure what the point of it is yet, I mean I

10:45.280 --> 10:49.280
know I unlock some things and I can see some random people around there and I get these

10:49.280 --> 10:53.320
really off the wall random friend requests and I don't even know who these people are.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.880
Is it because you're showing up on the near thing or whatever it's called?

10:56.880 --> 10:58.200
Yeah, I think it is.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.200
Interesting.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.200
I don't know who they are.

11:00.200 --> 11:03.200
Like, someone sent me a message like, okay maybe it's gonna say hey I'm Alyssa or something

11:03.200 --> 11:10.160
and it was like, sup, I'm like that doesn't fucking help, I don't know who you are.

11:10.160 --> 11:13.920
Yeah that's a good point, like if that all random stuff's gonna happen and you wanna

11:13.920 --> 11:17.280
add us on PlayStation Network, you might wanna say you're a listener, so that way we know

11:17.280 --> 11:23.000
like you're not like a random, does that thing show where you live?

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
It's not gonna give that away, right?

11:24.000 --> 11:28.720
No, it just, it'll say like you're, and it's not even accurate, entirely accurate, it'll

11:28.720 --> 11:37.960
show like, okay, your location is this cross section, you know, this cross street, which

11:37.960 --> 11:45.460
is not entirely accurate to where I'm at, and then it'll say this person is, you know,

11:45.460 --> 11:46.800
this far away from you.

11:46.800 --> 11:51.360
It doesn't show where they're at, it just shows, okay, this person's this far away from

11:51.360 --> 11:52.360
you.

11:52.360 --> 11:53.360
Approximately.

11:53.360 --> 11:54.840
So, that's about it.

11:54.840 --> 11:58.520
So what's the point of that, besides being able to like, add random ass people who are

11:58.520 --> 11:59.720
your neighbors?

11:59.720 --> 12:05.520
Um, you, well you can see like popularity of certain games, like it'll change, you know,

12:05.520 --> 12:11.520
um, like, oh okay, you know, Katamari's, you know, going up, or, I don't know.

12:11.520 --> 12:16.920
What is popular in your town, Orangevale, or whatever, wherever it is you live?

12:16.920 --> 12:20.880
It just shows, seems to show the stuff that I have, like I'm gonna pull it up right now,

12:20.880 --> 12:23.920
we'll see what's popular right here.

12:23.920 --> 12:28.960
Just going to our chatroom at chat.orangevalery.com, Tigerclaw says, heh, sky on swap note now.

12:28.960 --> 12:32.160
Yes, I saw that all the chatters added me, so I sent some cat pictures.

12:32.160 --> 12:35.840
Now, Tigerclaw, cause you were already on my list, you already saw these same notes,

12:35.840 --> 12:37.840
I just, I went back and sent some old notes.

12:37.840 --> 12:42.200
Cause I don't have new 3D cat pictures, but I will get some soon.

12:42.200 --> 12:43.600
So there's your 3D cat update.

12:43.600 --> 12:44.600
Back to the Vita.

12:44.600 --> 12:50.840
Okay, so right now, I'm syncing with the area, and it says I've traveled 21 kilometers today.

12:50.840 --> 12:53.760
Yeah, it's kilometers, it's not miles, even though this.

12:53.760 --> 12:55.880
You gotta be able to change that somewhere, I'm sure.

12:55.880 --> 12:56.880
I don't know.

12:56.880 --> 13:03.640
So, let's see here, out and about is one of the options, and it's showing popularity surge.

13:03.640 --> 13:06.440
There are five people playing Katamari.

13:06.440 --> 13:12.600
Topping the charts, the number of people for Little Deviance.

13:12.600 --> 13:20.120
And topping the charts, 18 people playing Little Deviance, and Katamari, Lumis.

13:20.120 --> 13:24.480
I think it's just showing the stuff I've played, cause that's what it seems like that's happening

13:24.480 --> 13:25.480
there.

13:25.480 --> 13:31.560
And it says also, I've just unlocked another thing, another discovery.

13:31.560 --> 13:36.240
Well, I'm also, I also live in the poorer part of town, so nobody probably has a Vita

13:36.240 --> 13:37.240
here.

13:37.240 --> 13:41.720
Like, I just unlocked a ModNation Racer road trip thing.

13:41.720 --> 13:45.480
I don't even know what it is, Alien 1 is what it is.

13:45.480 --> 13:50.240
A track, it says track part, it's from some, oh, it's from the person I just added, who

13:50.240 --> 13:55.000
I still don't know who the hell they are, Daredevil Onion.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.720
They sent me a track part.

13:57.720 --> 13:59.960
That sounds like what Dark Sakura had for lunch today.

13:59.960 --> 14:04.120
So I will download your track part, but I don't know who that is, so that doesn't really

14:04.120 --> 14:06.120
help me.

14:06.120 --> 14:13.880
Yeah, so, I mean, I don't, I still don't really know what the functionality of this is supposed

14:13.880 --> 14:14.880
to be.

14:14.880 --> 14:22.280
I can see some people that are playing nearby, but I just don't really understand what this

14:22.280 --> 14:25.120
is all about yet.

14:25.120 --> 14:29.880
Oh, here we go, I think I can, units of distance, there we go.

14:29.880 --> 14:31.920
I knew you could get it in miles.

14:31.920 --> 14:32.920
There you go.

14:32.920 --> 14:33.920
Anyways.

14:33.920 --> 14:34.920
So, there's that.

14:34.920 --> 14:37.960
Alright, tell us, tell us a little bit about the games, quickly.

14:37.960 --> 14:41.560
You've played, what, you've played Rayman, you were raving about the graphics in Rayman,

14:41.560 --> 14:42.560
right?

14:42.560 --> 14:43.640
Rayman I actually haven't played too much of yet.

14:43.640 --> 14:47.480
I just like, ooh, pretty graphics, and I went on and played something else.

14:47.480 --> 14:50.040
But yeah, Rayman's really, really gorgeous.

14:50.040 --> 14:55.840
I mean, Rayman Origins on the console looked great, and I'd say it's exactly like the console.

14:55.840 --> 15:01.520
I mean, that level of detail is there, and it's just, it's just jaw-dropping of how gorgeous

15:01.520 --> 15:02.760
the game is.

15:02.760 --> 15:03.760
And it plays great.

15:03.760 --> 15:05.400
It's a great platformer game.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.640
So that one's a good one.

15:07.640 --> 15:13.560
I got Luminous, Luminous is, you know, Luminous, there are some weird things that they've added

15:13.560 --> 15:16.920
to it, like you can tap the back panel, you're supposed to be able to tap it with the music

15:16.920 --> 15:22.240
and you unlock, it helps you unlock your power-up faster, although you can just spam the back

15:22.240 --> 15:26.600
of your system to unlock it as well.

15:26.600 --> 15:29.280
So I don't really know that point of that.

15:29.280 --> 15:33.200
The music in it's alright, although most of it I don't recognize, and most of it isn't

15:33.200 --> 15:35.300
as epic as I thought it would be.

15:35.300 --> 15:43.340
But there's some still, you know, good ones in there, like there's, oh, what was it, Window

15:43.340 --> 15:46.800
Liquor is in there, and that's awesome.

15:46.800 --> 15:51.800
And there's some other, some other songs that I've recognized.

15:51.800 --> 15:56.760
I heard something about a whole new kind of block that will shuffle block colors around

15:56.760 --> 15:57.760
it.

15:57.760 --> 16:02.240
Yeah, there's a block that will shuffle some of the stuff on there, there's also the blocks

16:02.240 --> 16:08.300
that you can drop, well the power-up that you start off with the default avatar allows

16:08.300 --> 16:15.880
you to, it'll break anything of the same color that's touching it, so you can eliminate a

16:15.880 --> 16:16.880
lot of stuff on there.

16:16.880 --> 16:19.160
Which was the old Luminous game, if I remember right.

16:19.160 --> 16:22.200
Yes, I think they have that.

16:22.200 --> 16:30.040
So it's fun, I like the game, and I actually played it one round for a good three hours

16:30.040 --> 16:31.040
I think the other day.

16:31.040 --> 16:33.780
That seems to be getting the best reviews out of all the Vita games, is Luminous, which

16:33.780 --> 16:34.780
doesn't surprise me.

16:34.780 --> 16:35.780
It's a fun-

16:35.780 --> 16:37.160
It's the PSP all over again.

16:37.160 --> 16:41.080
It's a fun game, but here's the thing, and this was kind of a problem with the original

16:41.080 --> 16:47.120
Luminous game, but it's even worse than this one, is some of those skins are so hard to

16:47.120 --> 16:48.120
see.

16:48.120 --> 16:51.960
Like there'll be some, some of the skins are completely flat, and they have the square

16:51.960 --> 16:55.480
blocks and stuff like that, some of them are like rounded or whatever.

16:55.480 --> 17:00.200
Some of them though have this weird fish-eye thing to them where it kind of, the screen

17:00.200 --> 17:05.500
bends a little bit, and it's just really disorienting.

17:05.500 --> 17:09.520
It's frustrating because I don't like, I don't like the look of it.

17:09.520 --> 17:11.200
I guess that's part of the challenge, maybe?

17:11.200 --> 17:12.200
I don't know.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.920
It's not even really a challenge, it's just like, okay, this song has this skin.

17:14.920 --> 17:17.080
It's just, it's dumb.

17:17.080 --> 17:21.040
But whatever, I mean, it is what it is.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.040
So that's Luminous.

17:22.040 --> 17:25.800
Honestly, I haven't played Little Deviants at all because I heard it's terrible.

17:25.800 --> 17:29.000
My coworker played it and he said, yep, it's terrible.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.360
So I haven't gotten to try that yet, so I can't really say if it's actually terrible

17:32.360 --> 17:35.600
or not, but I'm not planning on keeping it too long.

17:35.600 --> 17:40.280
I'm actually thinking of just trading it in and getting another memory card.

17:40.280 --> 17:48.520
And then, of course, I also played Touch My Katamari, which, it must have been a while

17:48.520 --> 17:52.600
since I've played other Katamari games because the levels seem new to me, but I hear that

17:52.600 --> 17:53.600
they're not.

17:53.600 --> 17:57.480
I hear they're just repeats of the old game again, which is kind of disappointing.

17:57.480 --> 17:59.920
It's really hard, I've found.

17:59.920 --> 18:05.040
I mean, I've been failing levels left and right and usually I breeze right through it.

18:05.040 --> 18:09.600
It's almost like it'll give you enough time to do everything.

18:09.600 --> 18:15.040
Not even necessarily breezing through, but I can't even get a five star rating after

18:15.040 --> 18:18.200
one or two tries.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.880
It's almost impossible.

18:19.880 --> 18:24.960
I think maybe some of the controls in there, but the way they've done the controls are

18:24.960 --> 18:26.400
kind of weird.

18:26.400 --> 18:29.600
They have everything mapped to buttons, which is nice because I don't like a lot of the

18:29.600 --> 18:38.280
touch screen stuff, like having to use the back panel to flip my Katamari around or jump.

18:38.280 --> 18:41.600
That's mapped to the shoulder buttons as well.

18:41.600 --> 18:46.920
And then to do the charge, you either have to hold the touch screen on the front or you

18:46.920 --> 18:53.560
spin your analog sticks around in a certain direction.

18:53.560 --> 19:00.240
And I don't know, neither way seems to work very well and that's kind of sad.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.240
It's really bad.

19:01.240 --> 19:05.240
And at the same time, it's like, hmm, yeah, that's cool that you mapped that to the analog

19:05.240 --> 19:09.720
sticks and yet you have all these face buttons you're not using at all.

19:09.720 --> 19:14.240
None of the face buttons are used in the game.

19:14.240 --> 19:17.800
Maybe they overdid it from people's complaints about the PSP game, but they could have just

19:17.800 --> 19:18.800
okay.

19:18.800 --> 19:22.600
They could either had it where you map your own custom buttons or they could have had

19:22.600 --> 19:26.760
it where, okay, Dash is now one of the buttons on the face.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.320
How hard would that have been?

19:28.320 --> 19:34.000
You added multiple stuff for the other buttons in the game, but oh, let's just not map it

19:34.000 --> 19:36.240
to the face buttons because that makes sense.

19:36.240 --> 19:41.080
Before you get to another game, let me read some comments from chat, chat.orangetonstrader.com.

19:41.080 --> 19:44.760
Ahamkara in our chat room says, I find the Vita annoying already.

19:44.760 --> 19:46.920
I tried one at an evil G in my area.

19:46.920 --> 19:51.480
In some menus you have multiple choices on screen, but you have to touch to choose to

19:51.480 --> 19:52.560
proceed.

19:52.560 --> 19:53.840
No buttons are used.

19:53.840 --> 19:59.340
You know, I had that same problem when I was on or when I went to evil G. Yes, I set foot

19:59.340 --> 20:03.400
in one to play it as well as I forgot that it had a touch screen because I associate

20:03.400 --> 20:07.360
the touch screen thing with like Apple, Nintendo, like I just forgot and I'm sitting there in

20:07.360 --> 20:08.640
the menu for ModNation races.

20:08.640 --> 20:11.400
I'm like, why can't I play the God damn game?

20:11.400 --> 20:12.400
It's not a big deal.

20:12.400 --> 20:13.400
Yeah, I know.

20:13.400 --> 20:15.840
Once I figured it out, I'm like, oh yeah, it's actually, it's really nice using the

20:15.840 --> 20:16.840
touch screen.

20:16.840 --> 20:21.440
A really interesting point that was brought up was that it does add a barrier for access

20:21.440 --> 20:22.440
ability.

20:22.440 --> 20:27.040
You know, I have a blind friend on Twitter that follows that's like, you know, this is

20:27.040 --> 20:30.940
limiting my accessibility cause you know, a blind person can use the buttons and everything,

20:30.940 --> 20:34.800
but might not necessarily know where to touch on the screen to use the menus.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.960
Well that's, it's going to be actually in the main menus and all that.

20:37.960 --> 20:43.040
Well, here's the problem with the main menus too, is that they can be all, all those buttons

20:43.040 --> 20:46.720
just like you can on the iOS and stuff, they can all be rearranged.

20:46.720 --> 20:52.760
So you know, it may not, and when you get stuff installed, it might not exactly be in

20:52.760 --> 20:56.120
the right order that you're thinking it's going to be in.

20:56.120 --> 21:03.000
So I don't know, they could easily add a button, you know, or patch it in later on, but it's

21:03.000 --> 21:07.440
going to be kind of difficult because icons can get added left and right.

21:07.440 --> 21:11.400
I don't know, unless you can change the sound effect that when you select a certain one,

21:11.400 --> 21:12.400
it sounds different.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.400
I don't know.

21:13.400 --> 21:14.400
Well, usually, I mean, think about it.

21:14.400 --> 21:17.920
It's really, you know, there's a lot of things that we take for granted sometimes, but I

21:17.920 --> 21:23.200
mean, a lot of folks in the blind gaming community, I get the sense they kind of, they're kind

21:23.200 --> 21:27.040
of trade ideas and so forth, and they know exactly how many taps one way and how many

21:27.040 --> 21:30.040
taps another way to get the result that they want.

21:30.040 --> 21:34.360
And you know, sometimes you might have very limited visibility of certain colors and so

21:34.360 --> 21:37.100
forth, and it's very, very sound oriented.

21:37.100 --> 21:41.700
Like I know fighting games are very popular because you use the sound cues a lot in those

21:41.700 --> 21:42.700
games.

21:42.700 --> 21:45.560
There's some YouTube out there, some blind guy just fucking regulating on Soulcalibur,

21:45.560 --> 21:48.640
I seem to remember, and it's all sound.

21:48.640 --> 21:49.640
Maybe.

21:49.640 --> 21:50.640
Yeah.

21:50.640 --> 21:56.160
But you adapt to what you know, but sometimes the system puts a barrier in place.

21:56.160 --> 22:00.280
It does seem a little silly that they can't just, you know, I get, okay, yes, we get it.

22:00.280 --> 22:05.000
The Vita has a touch screen, all right, now maybe not everybody wants to whore that out.

22:05.000 --> 22:10.060
Like any negative thing I'm hearing about the Vita on like Uncharted or even a game

22:10.060 --> 22:13.520
like Little Deviants is that, you know what, or like Uncharted, let's take Uncharted, is

22:13.520 --> 22:18.700
like, okay, A, it wasn't developed by Naughty Dog, B, the folks that developed it felt the

22:18.700 --> 22:22.240
need to really whore the touch screen and all the new stuff in it.

22:22.240 --> 22:26.000
I don't think it's that they felt the need, I think it's Sony felt the need to tell them

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
to do that.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
Right.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.800
You know, it's kind of like, you know, Excite Truck, Excite Truck is an awesome racing game,

22:32.800 --> 22:36.160
and then Nintendo felt the need to tell them, hey, you know what, we need to add some mini

22:36.160 --> 22:38.160
games in the middle of the race.

22:38.160 --> 22:41.080
Makes some fucking sense.

22:41.080 --> 22:44.680
The other thing I don't really care for about the Vita is sometimes it's very uncomfortable

22:44.680 --> 22:46.080
to hold the system.

22:46.080 --> 22:51.040
Like for example, the next game, which I got, which is funny because it's a full game, I

22:51.040 --> 22:57.000
didn't anticipate it being a full game, apparently when the system launched they had, like I

22:57.000 --> 23:00.840
said, demos that came up, you know, Ubisoft demos and stuff, and one of the games I did

23:00.840 --> 23:04.520
want to check out was Michael Jackson and the Experience because it's a rhythm music

23:04.520 --> 23:07.680
game on the Vita, and apparently it's, you know, pretty fun to play.

23:07.680 --> 23:12.200
So I downloaded that demo, didn't even really get a chance, I downloaded that in Uncharted

23:12.200 --> 23:14.000
because I was going to play them the next day.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.480
Can you do downloading in the background?

23:15.480 --> 23:16.480
Yes.

23:16.480 --> 23:17.480
Okay, cool.

23:17.480 --> 23:18.480
Yes, you can.

23:18.480 --> 23:21.640
And you can pause games too, you can just like totally go out of it, which is great

23:21.640 --> 23:24.880
because I use the web browser on there and web browser is awesome.

23:24.880 --> 23:25.880
It works great.

23:25.880 --> 23:26.880
Really?

23:26.880 --> 23:27.880
You can just...

23:27.880 --> 23:28.880
Does it do Flash?

23:28.880 --> 23:30.960
I don't think so.

23:30.960 --> 23:34.560
But you can go to websites and you can just, you know, hit the guide button, boop, go to

23:34.560 --> 23:38.440
a website, okay, I need to look up a FAQ on this game, look it up, whatever, and then

23:38.440 --> 23:41.560
switch back to your game again and take off.

23:41.560 --> 23:45.280
But yeah, Michael Jackson and Experience, actually a pretty fun music game.

23:45.280 --> 23:46.980
But here's the ironic part.

23:46.980 --> 23:51.000
The demo, originally when they first put it up, was the full game.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.500
Oops.

23:52.500 --> 24:01.440
So there's a few mix-ups where it was allowing you to download the full game for a few hours.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.200
So I have the full game of Michael Jackson and the Experience.

24:04.200 --> 24:07.600
I didn't pay for it, I still earn trophies from it, I just can't sync them because I

24:07.600 --> 24:09.520
didn't actually purchase the game.

24:09.520 --> 24:10.520
But I don't care.

24:10.520 --> 24:13.240
Interesting that it knows that.

24:13.240 --> 24:17.000
If I rent games from Gamefly or something, will I be able to do my trophies?

24:17.000 --> 24:20.800
Yeah, you will be able to because it's the physical cartridge.

24:20.800 --> 24:25.880
I have the digital download, so since it doesn't show that I have the actual full game, I don't

24:25.880 --> 24:28.540
have whatever it is to sync it.

24:28.540 --> 24:32.040
Great question from Tigerclaw in our chatroom at chat.orangesontraday.com, does the Vita

24:32.040 --> 24:34.280
have an internet radio player?

24:34.280 --> 24:36.660
I don't think so.

24:36.660 --> 24:40.900
We had that OLR PSP.com, which technically is still there, it hasn't been updated in

24:40.900 --> 24:42.680
a very long time.

24:42.680 --> 24:44.840
Yeah, whatever.

24:44.840 --> 24:48.760
I tried going to OLR Vita.com.

24:48.760 --> 24:54.500
I tried going to the All Games page today, and it did not play the radio player, so.

24:54.500 --> 24:55.760
So it might not do HTML5.

24:55.760 --> 24:56.760
Yeah, probably not.

24:56.760 --> 24:57.960
But no wait, is it Flash?

24:57.960 --> 24:59.760
I think All Games.com is Flash.

24:59.760 --> 25:00.760
It's HTML5 now.

25:00.760 --> 25:01.760
Is it?

25:01.760 --> 25:02.760
Yeah.

25:02.760 --> 25:03.760
So it doesn't, I don't think it does that.

25:03.760 --> 25:05.760
Oh yeah, because it works on my iPhone.

25:05.760 --> 25:08.440
I think you can very easily add an app for that.

25:08.440 --> 25:12.120
I mean, I haven't really mess, well let's click music.

25:12.120 --> 25:16.240
I haven't even really tried the music part yet because I don't have any music on here.

25:16.240 --> 25:17.240
But uh.

25:17.240 --> 25:20.320
What, you mean you're not downloading episodes of OLR to your phone?

25:20.320 --> 25:21.320
Or your PSP?

25:21.320 --> 25:26.000
Dude, I have a four gig card, it would fill that thing up really fast.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.120
That's true, that's true.

25:28.120 --> 25:29.440
So no, I don't have that.

25:29.440 --> 25:34.800
No, it doesn't look like it has a radio player in there, which is fine, you know.

25:34.800 --> 25:37.840
That could be added later on, easy, I mean.

25:37.840 --> 25:38.840
So.

25:38.840 --> 25:42.300
Hey, if there's a way to easily get OLR episodes in the PlayStation Vita, though, for those

25:42.300 --> 25:45.080
that do have bigger memory cards, I would let, you know, I'm all about, get the show

25:45.080 --> 25:48.720
out, get the show out there, however we can do it, you know.

25:48.720 --> 25:49.720
I'm all for that.

25:49.720 --> 25:50.720
So.

25:50.720 --> 25:55.240
Alright, well anyway, we talked about the Vita an awfully long time, so.

25:55.240 --> 26:00.720
What do you hope to most see from the system in the future?

26:00.720 --> 26:01.720
More games.

26:01.720 --> 26:05.240
I mean, there's a lot of games coming out already for it, and a lot of games I'm looking

26:05.240 --> 26:06.240
forward to.

26:06.240 --> 26:13.680
You know, the new Resistance game, Gravity Rush looks awesome, and I was trying to download

26:13.680 --> 26:19.600
the demo for it on my PS3 because I have a Japanese account and a UK account and stuff

26:19.600 --> 26:24.600
like that for, you know, getting multi-region demos, but they won't let you put them on

26:24.600 --> 26:29.120
the Vita, because you can only download demos for the account that's on the Vita because

26:29.120 --> 26:32.560
that's linked, that's stuck to one account, not multiple accounts.

26:32.560 --> 26:36.640
If I could put multiple accounts on there, I could have demos from all regions, which

26:36.640 --> 26:40.160
would have been awesome, because they also have the Twitter app over there, and the Flickr

26:40.160 --> 26:44.200
app already out in Japan, it's just not over here yet until Wednesday.

26:44.200 --> 26:46.920
Oh yeah, I forget those things have cameras on them.

26:46.920 --> 26:48.760
Yeah, they're not very good.

26:48.760 --> 26:49.760
Yeah.

26:49.760 --> 26:50.760
It's about as good as the 3DS.

26:50.760 --> 26:56.280
I mean, it's, they, I really wish they'd have a bigger camera, but I understand their thing

26:56.280 --> 27:00.960
was, it's gameplay first, you know, camera is just like, eh, whatever, but yeah, it has

27:00.960 --> 27:02.720
a front and back camera.

27:02.720 --> 27:03.720
Weird.

27:03.720 --> 27:08.280
And, here's the other thing that kind of sucks about it, the AR games aren't up yet, so they

27:08.280 --> 27:11.280
have these cards that don't do anything at the moment.

27:11.280 --> 27:12.280
Not yet.

27:12.280 --> 27:18.440
But they will, they will on Wednesday, and I'm trying to think what else is kind of cool.

27:18.440 --> 27:22.200
Yeah, the Welcome Park stuff, I haven't played it yet, but it's a bunch of little minigames

27:22.200 --> 27:27.200
to get you acclimated to the features of the Vita, and you can earn trophies from it, so

27:27.200 --> 27:32.000
that's kind of something, and I would recommend if you're thinking about gaining a system

27:32.000 --> 27:36.480
and thinking about gaining a memory card, you probably want more than 4 gigs, because

27:36.480 --> 27:43.180
I even just, you know, trying out some demos and stuff, it fills up the card really fast.

27:43.180 --> 27:46.040
But 8 gigs is probably, probably good.

27:46.040 --> 27:47.040
Alright.

27:47.040 --> 27:51.040
Well, I know that was extensive, but, you know, new system launch week, what can you

27:51.040 --> 27:52.040
do?

27:52.040 --> 27:55.280
I will be getting mine Wednesday, I'm really looking forward to it, I've only gotten to

27:55.280 --> 27:59.360
play with one a little bit, I'm getting Luminous and Katamari, so I'll tell you my impressions

27:59.360 --> 28:00.360
next week.

28:00.360 --> 28:04.200
Dark Sakura, I know one's not in the cards for you right away, but you, you were thinking

28:04.200 --> 28:05.960
about it a little bit, but you want an iPad more, huh?

28:05.960 --> 28:07.760
I really want the iPad 3.

28:07.760 --> 28:09.960
Yeah, because you can do more design stuff on that.

28:09.960 --> 28:13.760
Yeah, it's more practical for me, in that I can play tons of games on it too.

28:13.760 --> 28:14.760
Sure, sure.

28:14.760 --> 28:18.840
Alright, well, anyhow, but, but, it's, you gotta admit, it's pretty gorgeous, the screen's

28:18.840 --> 28:19.840
pretty gorgeous.

28:19.840 --> 28:20.840
Yeah, it's nice.

28:20.840 --> 28:21.840
Alright.

28:21.840 --> 28:25.040
Uh, let's, let's move on, we always start off the show with How Was Your Gaming Week,

28:25.040 --> 28:28.680
which I guess we kind of already did in a sense, but let's open it up to whatever we've

28:28.680 --> 28:29.680
been playing.

28:29.680 --> 28:31.920
Ladies first, Dark Sakura, How Was Your Gaming Week?

28:31.920 --> 28:35.680
Uh, it was pretty eventful, I mean, relatively.

28:35.680 --> 28:38.160
Dan and I played a lot of Bubble Bobble this morning.

28:38.160 --> 28:39.800
A lot of Bubble Bobble.

28:39.800 --> 28:40.800
I suck at it.

28:40.800 --> 28:41.800
Old school classic.

28:41.800 --> 28:42.800
Yeah.

28:42.800 --> 28:43.800
What system, because it was on everything.

28:43.800 --> 28:46.080
Not just one collection, but on the RPS3.

28:46.080 --> 28:51.400
Oh god, is that the one that came with, uh, it was like Bubble Bobble and it had-

28:51.400 --> 28:53.400
Rainbow Islands and the Rainbow Islands Deluxe.

28:53.400 --> 28:56.620
Oh, I thought there was another one, no, because that was a Capcom game, what am I thinking?

28:56.620 --> 29:02.280
I'm thinking of that game where you shoot the arrow up and it explodes the bubbles and

29:02.280 --> 29:06.400
it creates like a chain at the top of the screen and anything that hits it explodes

29:06.400 --> 29:07.400
too.

29:07.400 --> 29:08.400
Puzzle Bobble?

29:08.400 --> 29:09.400
No, no, no, no, no.

29:09.400 --> 29:10.400
Best of Move?

29:10.400 --> 29:11.400
No, it's Capcom.

29:11.400 --> 29:12.400
It was an old arcade game, somebody in chat was yelling it out.

29:12.400 --> 29:13.400
Buster Brothers?

29:13.400 --> 29:14.400
No.

29:14.400 --> 29:15.400
That's it.

29:15.400 --> 29:16.400
No.

29:16.400 --> 29:17.400
Well, yeah, now I know.

29:17.400 --> 29:19.760
I thought, I don't know why I tied those two games together in my mind because they weren't

29:19.760 --> 29:21.840
even the same company, but Bubbles.

29:21.840 --> 29:22.840
No.

29:22.840 --> 29:28.040
We played, um, Bubble Bobble a little bit today and, um, I was very alarmed that my

29:28.040 --> 29:32.360
friend who was over there at the time had never ever seen it.

29:32.360 --> 29:33.360
And he's my age.

29:33.360 --> 29:34.360
And I said-

29:34.360 --> 29:35.360
How do you not know the song at least?

29:35.360 --> 29:38.160
What planet were you born on?

29:38.160 --> 29:41.820
So, um, and I played well.

29:41.820 --> 29:42.820
And I played-

29:42.820 --> 29:43.820
And you played well at it?

29:43.820 --> 29:49.960
A lot of Busta Move on my phone, which I broke down and bought another puzzle pack.

29:49.960 --> 29:51.960
Who in the world does not know this song?

29:51.960 --> 29:55.960
That's like one of the best ones.

29:55.960 --> 29:58.960
Yeah, this is the best one.

29:58.960 --> 29:59.960
Sing along.

29:59.960 --> 30:08.980
And I would be stuck in your head all day.

30:08.980 --> 30:09.980
And the person next to you on the bus is looking at you funny.

30:09.980 --> 30:11.840
I was making up lyrics to it.

30:11.840 --> 30:12.840
Were you?

30:12.840 --> 30:13.840
Yeah.

30:13.840 --> 30:16.960
Have you ever watched that if video game themes had lyrics?

30:16.960 --> 30:18.720
No, I haven't.

30:18.720 --> 30:19.720
I've heard of it though.

30:19.720 --> 30:20.720
Those are funny.

30:20.720 --> 30:24.440
Um, actually, what's my favorite?

30:24.440 --> 30:32.240
They should do a Bubble Bobble like, I was actually just singing Bubble Bobble as the

30:32.240 --> 30:33.240
words.

30:33.240 --> 30:38.680
Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, yeah.

30:38.680 --> 30:41.000
So how was it?

30:41.000 --> 30:47.620
You had, you know, games back in the day didn't really have extensive soundtracks, you know?

30:47.620 --> 30:50.840
Like they started too late in the NES era, like especially a game like Final Fantasy

30:50.840 --> 30:51.840
or something.

30:51.840 --> 30:55.360
But a lot of those old games had like one little riff that would play through the whole

30:55.360 --> 30:56.360
damn game.

30:56.360 --> 30:57.360
So it had to be addicting.

30:57.360 --> 31:00.560
Oh, and there's one other game that actually I was looking for that I don't think I have

31:00.560 --> 31:05.200
on PC Engine that I want is Son Son 2.

31:05.200 --> 31:08.800
Son Son is a fun little side scroller and I was, found myself wishing today that I had

31:08.800 --> 31:11.360
a copy, and that's it.

31:11.360 --> 31:12.360
Good times.

31:12.360 --> 31:16.200
Uh, Loki, I know you've already talked extensively about the Vita, but opening it up to whatever

31:16.200 --> 31:18.120
you've been playing this week, is there anything else to share?

31:18.120 --> 31:19.600
Call of duty.

31:19.600 --> 31:22.120
My coworkers are starting to get really mad at me.

31:22.120 --> 31:24.920
Hasn't that been the running theme for how long now?

31:24.920 --> 31:32.520
Yeah, well, thankfully my other coworker comes back off of his paternity leave, so at least

31:32.520 --> 31:34.520
there'll be someone else to play.

31:34.520 --> 31:37.720
But yeah, they're getting mad.

31:37.720 --> 31:43.400
They had a conference in a, or they had a little group meeting in the conference room.

31:43.400 --> 31:52.040
I'm trying to think of one of the funny, uh, oh yeah, they, of course, you know, they know

31:52.040 --> 31:55.880
that there's people that play professional Starcraft in Korea.

31:55.880 --> 31:59.880
Of course, they mucked it up when they were doing the install.

31:59.880 --> 32:03.560
Why don't you just go, we're just going to send you to Korea to play competitive World

32:03.560 --> 32:04.560
of Warcraft.

32:04.560 --> 32:05.560
I'm like, okay.

32:05.560 --> 32:11.960
Well, if you want to get technical, arena is a big thing they do at Blizzcon.

32:11.960 --> 32:16.800
And I don't know if Korea is necessarily the big, I think that's Europe is really like,

32:16.800 --> 32:20.600
there's a lot of teams and you're like the biggest rating guilds are all over there.

32:20.600 --> 32:24.760
So I mean, it's just, it was just funny.

32:24.760 --> 32:25.760
All right.

32:25.760 --> 32:27.960
Anything else for your gaming week that you want to share?

32:27.960 --> 32:29.600
Um, that's it.

32:29.600 --> 32:30.600
All right.

32:30.600 --> 32:36.280
So gaming week, um, not a whole, whole, whole lot, but some new stuff I of course been playing.

32:36.280 --> 32:37.280
Wow.

32:37.280 --> 32:38.280
I'm on a rating team in wow now.

32:38.280 --> 32:41.760
So it's a little different, by the way, speaking of Warcraft, Horde house is coming back this

32:41.760 --> 32:42.760
week.

32:42.760 --> 32:44.560
Um, which is exciting because we've been gone for a month.

32:44.560 --> 32:47.600
We've just, we kind of suffered from burnout a little bit.

32:47.600 --> 32:50.800
And as you guys know, my cohost is on hiatus from wow.

32:50.800 --> 32:55.480
But um, and, and I just want to quell shiny fears, extra for an, I will both be on the

32:55.480 --> 32:56.480
new show.

32:56.480 --> 32:57.480
So don't worry about that.

32:57.480 --> 32:59.960
Nobody got fired or nothing, but it's going to be a little different and you'll have to

32:59.960 --> 33:02.120
tune in this week to find out how.

33:02.120 --> 33:05.240
But one of the things I'll be able to talk more about is like a legit rating because

33:05.240 --> 33:07.440
I've been doing more of that and more PVP.

33:07.440 --> 33:11.960
Um, so lots of wow, but I ha I believe it or not have had a life outside of wow.

33:11.960 --> 33:14.280
Um, a lot of it centers around the PlayStation three.

33:14.280 --> 33:17.960
I decided, and I'm going to get shit for this.

33:17.960 --> 33:21.640
I already know it, but I decided to take the plunge and sign up for PlayStation plus this

33:21.640 --> 33:22.640
week.

33:22.640 --> 33:26.340
Um, and I think the catalyst that did it for me was the fact that the Simpsons arcade game

33:26.340 --> 33:28.200
was free with PlayStation plus.

33:28.200 --> 33:33.600
And it really made me stop and think, damn, they are giving out free games all the freaking

33:33.600 --> 33:35.720
time on PlayStation plus.

33:35.720 --> 33:39.480
And especially if I've invested in the Vita and so forth, I'm getting all these minis.

33:39.480 --> 33:40.480
Why the heck not?

33:40.480 --> 33:41.480
I'm just going to get it now.

33:41.480 --> 33:42.480
Yes.

33:42.480 --> 33:44.760
Before you guys, I know, I know people are typing it in chat already.

33:44.760 --> 33:49.360
I already know if I, if I stopped paying for PlayStation plus, I'm fully aware you lose

33:49.360 --> 33:51.020
access to all these games.

33:51.020 --> 33:52.600
That's kind of the, the catalyst to it all.

33:52.600 --> 33:59.440
But then I was thinking, how many freaking games have I bought on Xbox live arcade hint

33:59.440 --> 34:01.980
a lot that I really don't play anymore.

34:01.980 --> 34:06.160
That if I lost access to it today, I'd be like, eh, Oh, well, you know, despite the

34:06.160 --> 34:12.520
fact that I paid five or $10 and I first got it, you know, so I'm not like, I fully realized

34:12.520 --> 34:16.200
that going into this deal that I might lose access to these games later on, but it's giving

34:16.200 --> 34:22.360
me the chance to really sample things that otherwise might not be worth a full download.

34:22.360 --> 34:24.440
For example, Simpson's arcade game.

34:24.440 --> 34:25.440
Okay.

34:25.440 --> 34:26.440
Here's the thing.

34:26.440 --> 34:29.640
We've all been wanting this game on, on the network, the PlayStation network and Xbox

34:29.640 --> 34:30.640
live forever.

34:30.640 --> 34:34.520
Like I even want to say we did a listless it's on iPhone a long, long time.

34:34.520 --> 34:36.880
Ah, it's a reimagining is on the iPhone.

34:36.880 --> 34:37.880
Tricky, tricky.

34:37.880 --> 34:39.700
Cause EA has the license now.

34:39.700 --> 34:45.640
So the one that's on the iPhone is inspired by the arcade game, but it's not exactly the

34:45.640 --> 34:49.400
arcade game, but the one that's on PlayStation network.

34:49.400 --> 34:53.720
And I don't know how they worked out the licensing and whatever, but it is the classic arcade

34:53.720 --> 34:54.720
game.

34:54.720 --> 34:58.560
Uh, the U S ROM and the Japanese ROM and all that stuff, you can play it online.

34:58.560 --> 35:02.140
And yeah, I played through it and I was like, Oh man, I used to love this game in the arcades,

35:02.140 --> 35:05.760
but now that I've done it, will I do it again next month?

35:05.760 --> 35:08.040
Will I play it every week?

35:08.040 --> 35:09.440
Probably not.

35:09.440 --> 35:13.760
So if I decide not to renew PlayStation plus after three months, yeah, I know, but it's

35:13.760 --> 35:16.440
not look, look, the stages and stuff are different.

35:16.440 --> 35:21.360
Like it, they, they, they know that people want the Simpsons arcade game on the phone,

35:21.360 --> 35:23.360
but EA didn't do the Simpsons arcade game.

35:23.360 --> 35:24.360
Konami did.

35:24.360 --> 35:25.360
This one's put up.

35:25.360 --> 35:26.360
Oh, that's right.

35:26.360 --> 35:27.360
Yep.

35:27.360 --> 35:28.920
So, and the one that's on network is a Konami.

35:28.920 --> 35:32.360
So yeah, JV Mon says the same thing in chat sky.

35:32.360 --> 35:34.200
You've bought hundreds of dollars in XBLA games.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.840
You've played once.

35:35.840 --> 35:36.840
Absolutely right.

35:36.840 --> 35:39.920
Uh, Kaijuto says, Rob, if all you wanted was Simpsons arcade game, you could have just

35:39.920 --> 35:41.960
bought it for the same price as PSN plus.

35:41.960 --> 35:43.280
Yes, that's true.

35:43.280 --> 35:47.860
But then I thought, you know, why not get some of the extra other games?

35:47.860 --> 35:50.360
And I got two other games too already.

35:50.360 --> 35:55.880
Uh, one of them was this kind of basic bitch, uh, monkey ball clone game.

35:55.880 --> 36:00.640
It's called hamster ball, but it not only had a monkey ball clone, but it had like a

36:00.640 --> 36:02.180
marble madness clone.

36:02.180 --> 36:05.840
And I started playing that, like there's two different types of like versions and one of

36:05.840 --> 36:06.840
them was a marble madness clone.

36:06.840 --> 36:10.880
I was like, okay, this, this is kind of cool because like marble madness is one of those

36:10.880 --> 36:11.880
games.

36:11.880 --> 36:14.680
I forgot was out there, but I really did love that game.

36:14.680 --> 36:17.560
And to be playing this, I was like, what the hell does this remind me of?

36:17.560 --> 36:18.560
Oh shit.

36:18.560 --> 36:19.560
It's marble madness.

36:19.560 --> 36:20.560
And I was like, okay.

36:20.560 --> 36:21.560
Okay.

36:21.560 --> 36:22.560
Hamster ball.

36:22.560 --> 36:23.560
I'm onto you.

36:23.560 --> 36:24.560
So that was kind of neat.

36:24.560 --> 36:25.560
And I didn't pay for it.

36:25.560 --> 36:31.860
Uh, and then I got a game called battle Fantasia, which was a very chibi RPG ish fighting game

36:31.860 --> 36:35.520
where you actually have hit points and you know, not a game I probably would have checked

36:35.520 --> 36:39.020
out otherwise, but it was, it's neat and I didn't pay anything for it.

36:39.020 --> 36:42.880
So, uh, go to our chat at chat.org.com.

36:42.880 --> 36:44.480
Uh, where is it?

36:44.480 --> 36:45.480
Rama?

36:45.480 --> 36:49.480
Rama said PlayStation plus a fool and their money is soon parted.

36:49.480 --> 36:51.480
Well, fine.

36:51.480 --> 36:52.560
You know, you're welcome to your opinion.

36:52.560 --> 36:53.560
You are that fool.

36:53.560 --> 36:54.560
Well, hold on though.

36:54.560 --> 36:57.280
No, somebody made me thinking of Adam's family.

36:57.280 --> 37:01.900
Honestly answer me this, how is Xbox live any better of a deal at this point?

37:01.900 --> 37:03.640
Like I'm not trying to sound like a Sony fan boy.

37:03.640 --> 37:07.880
I'm really not, but like, you know, go back four years ago in this show when Sony was

37:07.880 --> 37:08.880
really struggling.

37:08.880 --> 37:11.720
I didn't even hell as much as anyone else did, but I really feel like we've reached

37:11.720 --> 37:16.760
this point where outside of connect, I feel like my PlayStation three has more to offer.

37:16.760 --> 37:18.840
And that even goes as far as like PlayStation plus and stuff.

37:18.840 --> 37:26.240
What does Xbox live give me online gaming, which is on PlayStation network for free anyway,

37:26.240 --> 37:29.160
you know, Xbox isn't exactly giving away games or any of this stuff.

37:29.160 --> 37:33.040
So, I mean, I really am starting to question why the hell am I hanging onto an Xbox live

37:33.040 --> 37:34.040
gold account?

37:34.040 --> 37:38.160
I don't play anything on Xbox live right now that isn't a connect game.

37:38.160 --> 37:39.160
Don't get me wrong.

37:39.160 --> 37:42.200
I love dance central and rhythm party and all that, but I'm hanging on to Xbox live

37:42.200 --> 37:44.800
gold because I've already paid for it.

37:44.800 --> 37:48.320
Why is Konami made a game called fish kebab?

37:48.320 --> 37:52.640
Cause they, they can have weird stuff.

37:52.640 --> 37:53.640
Not meaning to derail.

37:53.640 --> 37:55.480
I was just looking through it.

37:55.480 --> 37:56.480
Okay.

37:56.480 --> 38:01.360
So, well I, I'm not going to give you shit because it's your money and you can do what

38:01.360 --> 38:02.760
the fuck you want with it.

38:02.760 --> 38:04.800
So let me know how it works out.

38:04.800 --> 38:05.800
I will.

38:05.800 --> 38:06.800
Yeah, that's all.

38:06.800 --> 38:09.080
It's neat that you get the minis and all that.

38:09.080 --> 38:11.480
And black Wolf and chat says it amuses me to always here.

38:11.480 --> 38:14.400
I didn't pay for it when you got access to it by paying for it.

38:14.400 --> 38:15.400
Okay.

38:15.400 --> 38:16.400
Blah, blah, blah, whatever.

38:16.400 --> 38:17.400
Fine.

38:17.400 --> 38:20.120
But, but at the same time, I've already probably got more value out of this than I have my

38:20.120 --> 38:21.640
year of Xbox live so far.

38:21.640 --> 38:22.640
Yeah.

38:22.640 --> 38:23.640
Really?

38:23.640 --> 38:26.400
Do we get free games each month with Xbox live?

38:26.400 --> 38:27.400
No.

38:27.400 --> 38:31.960
I mean, we get discounts sometimes and demos.

38:31.960 --> 38:34.360
They're not free cause you paid for it.

38:34.360 --> 38:35.360
That's true.

38:35.360 --> 38:38.080
I have that Castlevania game.

38:38.080 --> 38:39.200
I haven't tried it.

38:39.200 --> 38:40.200
It's interesting.

38:40.200 --> 38:42.000
Castlevania puzzle on core of the night.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
It's weird.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
Yeah.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
All right.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
Anyhow.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
So you know what?

38:47.000 --> 38:48.040
I did it and if I didn't, you know, it's just, I just did three months.

38:48.040 --> 38:51.400
So I was like, you know, if I don't want to do it and I already turned off the auto subscription

38:51.400 --> 38:55.400
thing cause it tries to make you turn it on, but you just go in and turn it off and there

38:55.400 --> 38:56.400
you go.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.680
Which is already a plus, which is already, yeah.

38:58.680 --> 39:00.800
Something you can't do on the three 60.

39:00.800 --> 39:10.880
So again, without taking a, a, uh, a trip to India via the telephone.

39:10.880 --> 39:11.880
So there you go.

39:11.880 --> 39:12.880
All right.

39:12.880 --> 39:14.480
That's enough of my gaming week.

39:14.480 --> 39:18.580
So let's talk housekeeping real quick of which I don't have a whole lot, but I will of course

39:18.580 --> 39:22.320
mention the Facebook and the Twitter's facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

39:22.320 --> 39:27.320
We're also on Twitter, twitter.com slash orange launch radio or twitter.com slash O L R and

39:27.320 --> 39:29.840
we're on Google plus under orange lounge radio.

39:29.840 --> 39:30.880
No URL there.

39:30.880 --> 39:31.880
Question for you.

39:31.880 --> 39:37.160
Since you use your PlayStation three more than I do, um, your PlayStation three, you

39:37.160 --> 39:40.760
can set it up to where your trophy stuff gets posted to the Facebook, right?

39:40.760 --> 39:41.760
Yeah.

39:41.760 --> 39:42.760
Okay.

39:42.760 --> 39:47.680
You can do that with the Vita too, but I obviously did not set that up cause I don't want to spend

39:47.680 --> 39:52.800
my, well, all somebody has to do is block the application, but I actually kind of enjoy

39:52.800 --> 39:56.480
reading it because it tells me like I leave it unblocked and I don't mind people posting

39:56.480 --> 40:01.120
those because it tells me what games my friends are playing and a lot of times I'll see so

40:01.120 --> 40:04.260
and so is playing this game and I'll be like, is this any good?

40:04.260 --> 40:05.520
And I get the same thing.

40:05.520 --> 40:10.700
Like I posted trophies from Simpsons arcade game and somebody was like, so is it more

40:10.700 --> 40:12.640
nostalgia or is it actually fun?

40:12.640 --> 40:16.160
And I was kind of like, well, it's a little bit of both.

40:16.160 --> 40:20.840
So you know, I, I, I do actually like the trophy spam, but thank heavens on Facebook

40:20.840 --> 40:25.720
you can easily block it and it won't upgrade you to timeline.

40:25.720 --> 40:29.440
So, well, upgrade you to timeline.

40:29.440 --> 40:30.440
Yeah.

40:30.440 --> 40:31.960
Like all these apps want to upgrade you to timeline now.

40:31.960 --> 40:34.120
Like you try to use Hulu or Pinterest.

40:34.120 --> 40:38.920
It's all, you can install this app, but it'll upgrade you to timeline the whole Facebook

40:38.920 --> 40:39.920
timeline.

40:39.920 --> 40:40.920
Horrible page.

40:40.920 --> 40:41.920
I can't stand it.

40:41.920 --> 40:44.080
I don't subscribe to anything anymore on Facebook.

40:44.080 --> 40:45.080
Yeah.

40:45.080 --> 40:49.040
I already see I was in timeline before I was in timeline back in September.

40:49.040 --> 40:50.600
So you're already stuck with it.

40:50.600 --> 40:51.600
I hate it.

40:51.600 --> 40:54.720
I hate looking at those timeline pages like sums on the left and sums on the right.

40:54.720 --> 40:55.720
It's weird.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.560
I don't look at my page anymore though.

40:57.560 --> 40:59.200
I only look at my feed.

40:59.200 --> 41:03.320
So all right, let's move on with some actual gaming news.

41:03.320 --> 41:04.320
Loki.

41:04.320 --> 41:07.040
So Sony spending a lot of money to promote the Vita, which is kind of funny cause I've

41:07.040 --> 41:10.060
yet to see any advertisements for the Vita.

41:10.060 --> 41:16.640
So I don't know where this $50 million is going, but I'm assuming that they're gonna

41:16.640 --> 41:21.160
start playing commercials after the system comes out, which is a little odd, but okay.

41:21.160 --> 41:29.120
And there's a few commercials floating around, I guess, on the internet, but anyways, yeah,

41:29.120 --> 41:38.440
part of it's of course the hashtag game changer on Twitter, which I mean, I don't know, whatever.

41:38.440 --> 41:42.320
And they have hashtags for everything and like hashtags for people posting comments

41:42.320 --> 41:47.840
during the Whitney Houston funeral, which my wife watched by the way, part of it at

41:47.840 --> 41:48.840
least.

41:48.840 --> 41:52.720
But yeah, I mean, they're used for everything.

41:52.720 --> 41:59.160
So yeah, and of course, you know, there's the huge Twitter campaign and I'm assuming

41:59.160 --> 42:03.280
lots of TV stuff, like probably like the PlayStation 3 was.

42:03.280 --> 42:04.280
So it'll be interesting.

42:04.280 --> 42:06.880
They're definitely working that out.

42:06.880 --> 42:12.760
And then of course, you know, like some of the first party PlayStation 3 titles, the

42:12.760 --> 42:18.240
PlayStation passes are making their way to the Vita as well.

42:18.240 --> 42:24.280
Two games that launched that do have an online pass would be Hotshots Golf World Invitational

42:24.280 --> 42:26.320
and Wipeout 2048.

42:26.320 --> 42:29.240
Why those titles are the only ones that have online passes?

42:29.240 --> 42:33.320
Those are the only ones with actually online multiplayer simultaneous.

42:33.320 --> 42:39.140
Note, ModNation Racers does not have simultaneous multiplayer.

42:39.140 --> 42:45.460
They have this fancy term called asynchronous multiplayer, which means you download someone's

42:45.460 --> 42:47.840
ghost run and you race against that.

42:47.840 --> 42:49.760
There is no multiplayer in that game.

42:49.760 --> 42:53.880
AlphaKananagram in our chatroom says, I've seen ads for the Vita for the US.

42:53.880 --> 42:54.880
They suck.

42:54.880 --> 43:00.360
Also, one of the US commercials shows 3G gaming when you can't game on 3G.

43:00.360 --> 43:02.460
You can.

43:02.460 --> 43:05.740
You can game, but you can't game over 3G.

43:05.740 --> 43:09.280
Maybe it's showing up on things like maybe it's playing on ESPN or something you don't

43:09.280 --> 43:10.280
really watch.

43:10.280 --> 43:11.520
Maybe that's where the commercials are.

43:11.520 --> 43:14.720
I don't watch a lot of TV either, so it's possible.

43:14.720 --> 43:17.040
But I mean, I don't know.

43:17.040 --> 43:21.720
I was watching Comedy Central the other day, and I didn't see anything.

43:21.720 --> 43:24.400
But then again, I don't watch a lot of TV, so maybe.

43:24.400 --> 43:28.080
AlphaKananagram in our chatroom continued to chat that OrangeLaunchRadio.com saying,

43:28.080 --> 43:32.080
also, I heard another one showed someone playing it outside with good screen quality, but I

43:32.080 --> 43:36.480
think screen can't do that in sunlight IRL, so it's sort of false advertising.

43:36.480 --> 43:37.680
How does that thing react in sunlight?

43:37.680 --> 43:38.680
I don't know.

43:38.680 --> 43:39.680
I haven't played it outside.

43:39.680 --> 43:40.680
Go outside!

43:40.680 --> 43:41.680
Yeah.

43:41.680 --> 43:44.160
There's a whole world out there.

43:44.160 --> 43:45.160
There's air.

43:45.160 --> 43:47.920
I don't have a vitamin D deficiency.

43:47.920 --> 43:50.400
I was outside most of the day today.

43:50.400 --> 43:53.120
I just didn't take my game system with me to go walk around.

43:53.120 --> 43:54.120
Yeah.

43:54.120 --> 43:55.120
See, that was a great thing.

43:55.120 --> 43:58.720
They had somebody like walking around in an urban environment, probably New York City

43:58.720 --> 44:03.280
or something like that, you know, looking down at the screen playing the Vita, waiting

44:03.280 --> 44:08.760
for that guy to get hit by a cab as he crosses the street because some fucking idiot walking

44:08.760 --> 44:13.960
around playing a game, you know, looking down, it's just stupid.

44:13.960 --> 44:17.080
I could see myself walking outside, taking a walk around the lake, I just fall right

44:17.080 --> 44:18.080
in.

44:18.080 --> 44:25.440
The other thing I do like about the Vita is the fact that you can actually type on the

44:25.440 --> 44:34.480
screen, you know, whereas before you did the crazy, you know, pre-touchscreen era analog,

44:34.480 --> 44:40.680
you know, yeah, it's not fun to type on the old PSPs, but, uh, Wipeout!

44:40.680 --> 44:41.680
Does PSP have auto-correct?

44:41.680 --> 44:48.760
Uh, PSV, excuse me, has suggestions, so you can, you can quickly, uh, tap, so just like

44:48.760 --> 44:55.080
PS3 kinda has that, yeah, yeah, um, I do kinda wanna try Wipeout, but I got frustrated the

44:55.080 --> 45:00.400
first Wipeout game, it's just not, not my thing, a little, a little too fast and just

45:00.400 --> 45:01.400
kind of weird.

45:01.400 --> 45:07.200
I want a more traditional racing game, I guess, but, uh, we'll see.

45:07.200 --> 45:11.320
And as I mentioned before, Ridge Racer did not make it at launch, it got delayed.

45:11.320 --> 45:12.320
Ooh!

45:12.320 --> 45:17.640
Oh, and one other thing, um, of course, Super Stardust Delta is gonna be the free 3G Vita

45:17.640 --> 45:19.200
game that you get at launch.

45:19.200 --> 45:22.920
Not a big surprise since, for, well, pretty much everything up until launch, it was the

45:22.920 --> 45:28.160
only 3, only, uh, you know, PlayStation Network download, except they added, you know, the

45:28.160 --> 45:31.760
escape plan stuff now and there's gonna be some other stuff coming out later on.

45:31.760 --> 45:39.080
Um, and that is, there's a lot of ifs and ands and, you know, uh, asterisks and stuff

45:39.080 --> 45:40.080
like that.

45:40.080 --> 45:47.400
So basically, you need to, um, sign up with AT&T, not necessarily sign up, but you need

45:47.400 --> 45:56.560
to activate your 3G, um, and then I believe the way it works is, um, you pay for a month

45:56.560 --> 46:05.640
of 3G, so 250 megs, $15, and then you get a free month of 3G, um, and then once you've

46:05.640 --> 46:09.520
done that, you also get Super Stardust Delta for free.

46:09.520 --> 46:15.840
And I think it also, um, that's so, that's so low in my opinion, it really strikes me

46:15.840 --> 46:20.120
as false advertising, because it's like you're not really getting, you know, because on Amazon

46:20.120 --> 46:25.020
it said you get, you get a free network game or whatever, but it's not really free.

46:25.020 --> 46:27.460
It's free when you pay for the 3G.

46:27.460 --> 46:28.800
Free when you pay more money.

46:28.800 --> 46:32.960
It's that whole, that's what somebody just criticized me of saying on PlayStation Plus

46:32.960 --> 46:33.960
earlier.

46:33.960 --> 46:37.800
And here's the thing about the 3G too, is they will auto renew, um, you know, if you

46:37.800 --> 46:44.200
don't cancel it, so that kind of sucks, um, and oh, oh, and I guess it's Super Stardust

46:44.200 --> 46:51.240
Delta plus the Blast Pack DLC for free, yeah, the Blast Pack DLC for Super Stardust Delta,

46:51.240 --> 46:57.840
which was a pay to unlock thing, for a download game, a pay to unlock thing, another $8 on

46:57.840 --> 47:05.000
top of like, the, what is it, $10 or $15 that that costs, just like, come on.

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
Yeah.

47:06.000 --> 47:10.640
All right, well, moving on to more Vita news, and this is something that will make Loki

47:10.640 --> 47:15.200
very happy, I'm sure, uh, it has been announced that Call of Duty will be coming out on the

47:15.200 --> 47:16.200
Vita this fall.

47:16.200 --> 47:17.200
Duh.

47:17.200 --> 47:21.160
I know, this is really a duh, but it's, it's, because, right, don't, doesn't Call of Duty

47:21.160 --> 47:24.760
come out on the frickin' like, Game Boy Color still?

47:24.760 --> 47:26.640
They had it on, they poured it everywhere.

47:26.640 --> 47:28.000
They had it on the DS.

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
I'm sure they did.

47:29.000 --> 47:32.920
I don't know if there was one, no, there was one last year for Modern Warfare 3 on the

47:32.920 --> 47:33.920
DS.

47:33.920 --> 47:37.680
Of course it's coming out on the Vita, but it is still notable, because obviously this

47:37.680 --> 47:42.320
is a huge franchise, and even though it's one I don't usually talk about, it is still

47:42.320 --> 47:43.640
a huge selling franchise.

47:43.640 --> 47:46.680
I think it would be a system seller, to be honest, for the Vita.

47:46.680 --> 47:47.680
You think it's gonna be that good?

47:47.680 --> 47:49.920
You don't think it'll just be a port of another title?

47:49.920 --> 47:55.520
Um, it may be a port of, um, I think it's gonna be a port of the game that they're gonna

47:55.520 --> 48:00.440
be putting out this year, but, I mean, the games look great on there, and if they can

48:00.440 --> 48:03.960
get the controls right, which, I mean, it's got most of the controls of a Playstation

48:03.960 --> 48:10.920
3, aside from missing the L3, R3, and, you know, L2, R2, but, um, you can kinda work

48:10.920 --> 48:13.400
that stuff in, you know, with the touch screen, maybe.

48:13.400 --> 48:17.260
Let me get to the exact quote about this release, uh, this is from Vice President Guy Longworth

48:17.260 --> 48:20.840
in an interview with Game Trailers, saying, quote, in the autumn, they're really looking

48:20.840 --> 48:24.760
forward to Call of Duty on Vita, and we think that's going to be an absolute game changer

48:24.760 --> 48:26.760
for the platform.

48:26.760 --> 48:28.720
Interesting way of phrasing that.

48:28.720 --> 48:31.160
Nice to work in the hashtag in there for their Twitter cam.

48:31.160 --> 48:33.600
I think it's gonna be a game changer.

48:33.600 --> 48:38.280
Oh, is that, uh, I didn't realize that was a whole tie-in to some weird marketing thing.

48:38.280 --> 48:39.280
Eh.

48:39.280 --> 48:40.720
But yeah, I think it'll do well.

48:40.720 --> 48:45.680
I mean, they'll probably have Call of Duty on the 3DS this year.

48:45.680 --> 48:51.480
Well, if it's a unique Vita game with features kinda unique to the system, I'm sure there'll

48:51.480 --> 48:56.120
be an audience for it, but I would think it's just gonna be a port, kinda like the DS games

48:56.120 --> 48:57.120
are.

48:57.120 --> 49:01.480
The DS games are completely different, I mean, that's really limited as far as the system

49:01.480 --> 49:02.480
goes.

49:02.480 --> 49:07.120
They've had Call of Duty's like really old Call of Duty's on the PSP, but even that was

49:07.120 --> 49:09.760
kinda limited because you didn't have a second analog stick and stuff.

49:09.760 --> 49:13.760
This I think is gonna be more along the lines of an actual Call of Duty game, and it would

49:13.760 --> 49:18.280
be cool if they had like cross-play with like the PS3 and stuff, you could do that.

49:18.280 --> 49:22.820
That could be the game changer right there.

49:22.820 --> 49:25.360
Play with the PC and the PS3.

49:25.360 --> 49:27.360
Alright.

49:27.360 --> 49:31.000
DarkSakura, what do you got for us in the news?

49:31.000 --> 49:34.600
Sorry, I was describing a bottle of wine.

49:34.600 --> 49:36.560
Talking to liquor with our chatters.

49:36.560 --> 49:39.240
And my windows have frozen.

49:39.240 --> 49:40.760
Oh noes.

49:40.760 --> 49:43.200
Deselect motherfucker.

49:43.200 --> 49:44.200
Stop it.

49:44.200 --> 49:46.520
What kind of laptop should our users not be buying?

49:46.520 --> 49:48.520
Hold on.

49:48.520 --> 49:49.520
Netbook.

49:49.520 --> 49:50.520
Netbook.

49:50.520 --> 49:52.760
I guess there's a difference, huh?

49:52.760 --> 49:53.760
Or is the mouse dying?

49:53.760 --> 49:55.840
No, it's not my mouse.

49:55.840 --> 50:01.880
What happens is that it's selected text, and it's not deselecting the text so that I can

50:01.880 --> 50:04.700
get to my other window.

50:04.700 --> 50:12.480
So yeah, Capcom had another spelling problem on a, what's the Azure watch?

50:12.480 --> 50:13.480
Is that the game?

50:13.480 --> 50:14.480
Azure's Wrath.

50:14.480 --> 50:15.480
Azure's Wrath.

50:15.480 --> 50:16.480
Azure's Wrath.

50:16.480 --> 50:17.480
Azure's Wrath.

50:17.480 --> 50:18.480
Whatever.

50:18.480 --> 50:19.480
Yeah, it's Chanelgers.

50:19.480 --> 50:20.480
Chanelingers.

50:20.480 --> 50:21.480
Chanlingers.

50:21.480 --> 50:22.480
Chanlingers.

50:22.480 --> 50:23.480
Chanlingers.

50:23.480 --> 50:24.480
Chanlingers.

50:24.480 --> 50:25.480
Chanlingers.

50:25.480 --> 50:28.860
It's apparently even more fail than it was before.

50:28.860 --> 50:30.800
So yeah, Capcom's still misspelling words.

50:30.800 --> 50:39.040
They really need to get things correct with their, you know, finally I can get to the

50:39.040 --> 50:40.040
damn thing.

50:40.040 --> 50:42.400
Now that you recalled it from memory, yes.

50:42.400 --> 50:46.120
They really need to get their QA really down.

50:46.120 --> 50:50.220
Either that or not let the Japanese team do the boxes.

50:50.220 --> 50:54.820
Or they need to just invest in Microsoft Word and the little red underline that appears

50:54.820 --> 50:57.240
when you spell a word wrong.

50:57.240 --> 50:58.560
Because these aren't done in Word.

50:58.560 --> 51:01.360
I'm not a designer, but couldn't illustrator or whatever.

51:01.360 --> 51:04.080
I have the solution to all of Capcom's problems.

51:04.080 --> 51:05.080
Hire me.

51:05.080 --> 51:10.080
This shit doesn't happen on anything that I make.

51:10.080 --> 51:11.320
Hire me.

51:11.320 --> 51:13.400
You should send in a resume.

51:13.400 --> 51:14.400
P.S.

51:14.400 --> 51:16.920
I don't screw up on the covers to video games.

51:16.920 --> 51:20.680
You should make a little YouTube and we can try and get it to go viral and send it to

51:20.680 --> 51:21.680
Capcom.

51:21.680 --> 51:22.680
Do you want to?

51:22.680 --> 51:23.680
I will help you make one if you want.

51:23.680 --> 51:24.680
Five.

51:24.680 --> 51:25.680
All right.

51:25.680 --> 51:26.680
New project for OLR.

51:26.680 --> 51:27.680
Get Jamie a job.

51:27.680 --> 51:30.920
Unlike your application for the tester, you need to actually go through with this one.

51:30.920 --> 51:33.480
You need to actually make, well, I didn't make my video for the tester.

51:33.480 --> 51:34.480
That's the only thing I didn't do.

51:34.480 --> 51:37.840
And it's just like sort of, I was sort of like, I don't want to move.

51:37.840 --> 51:38.840
It's really it.

51:38.840 --> 51:41.880
It's like, I don't want to go to LA, but I don't like LA.

51:41.880 --> 51:42.880
Capcom's in the Bay, right?

51:42.880 --> 51:43.880
They have a big office in the Bay.

51:43.880 --> 51:44.880
I think so.

51:44.880 --> 51:45.880
I think they do.

51:45.880 --> 51:46.880
Santa Clara.

51:46.880 --> 51:49.200
Which I would totally telecommute for that.

51:49.200 --> 51:51.200
There you go.

51:51.200 --> 51:52.600
I would absolutely telecommute.

51:52.600 --> 51:53.600
All right.

51:53.600 --> 51:54.600
And you, and no spelling mistakes.

51:54.600 --> 51:55.600
No spelling mistakes.

51:55.600 --> 51:59.280
T E L E C O M M U T E.

51:59.280 --> 52:03.440
If anyone from Capcom is listening, remember the dark soccer is a real bitch when it comes

52:03.440 --> 52:05.440
to grammar and spelling.

52:05.440 --> 52:06.440
I am.

52:06.440 --> 52:07.840
You've heard the mailbag segment on this show.

52:07.840 --> 52:09.320
She's ruthless.

52:09.320 --> 52:10.560
I have no Ruth.

52:10.560 --> 52:12.560
None at all.

52:12.560 --> 52:13.760
No Ruth anywhere near me.

52:13.760 --> 52:14.760
Well, let's be honest.

52:14.760 --> 52:17.080
Most people wouldn't notice that that's misspelled anyways.

52:17.080 --> 52:20.120
Someone had to it for them to have posted it on.

52:20.120 --> 52:21.120
That's pretty bad.

52:21.120 --> 52:22.120
You're a gamer.

52:22.120 --> 52:27.280
Some people, but I mean, after reading the many forums out there and the level, the level

52:27.280 --> 52:30.280
of spelling that is accepted nowadays.

52:30.280 --> 52:31.280
Chan-linges.

52:31.280 --> 52:32.720
They don't notice.

52:32.720 --> 52:33.720
Okay.

52:33.720 --> 52:34.720
Seriously.

52:34.720 --> 52:35.720
Oh, it's text speak.

52:35.720 --> 52:36.720
Chan-linges is text speak.

52:36.720 --> 52:37.720
No, it's not even that.

52:37.720 --> 52:38.920
It's an extra freaking letter.

52:38.920 --> 52:41.920
When I get, when I get my Vita next week, I'm going to send Loki a text message that

52:41.920 --> 52:44.600
says I Chan-linge you to a duel in luminous.

52:44.600 --> 52:45.600
I spell it.

52:45.600 --> 52:46.600
Maybe it's a friend's reference.

52:46.600 --> 52:48.760
Maybe it's a friend's reference.

52:48.760 --> 52:56.480
It's spelled C H A N L L E N G E S. That's an extra N. Someone got crazy typing fingers

52:56.480 --> 52:58.480
and spelled it wrong.

52:58.480 --> 53:02.760
And Capcom's like, no one cares for these who maybe they're a fan of Chandler.

53:02.760 --> 53:06.200
And so, you know, but there's no D in there to make it Chandler.

53:06.200 --> 53:09.880
So your argument is in value is in value is invalid.

53:09.880 --> 53:11.440
You just got fired from Capcom.

53:11.440 --> 53:15.640
Way to go, listen to me.

53:15.640 --> 53:19.600
First of all, I don't normally speak like this when I am at my job.

53:19.600 --> 53:22.480
So you can rely on me to be professional.

53:22.480 --> 53:24.940
Shut up, Rob.

53:24.940 --> 53:32.320
I am a great up and coming designer and I will work for 20 bucks an hour, which is cheaper

53:32.320 --> 53:33.680
than a lot of designers will charge you.

53:33.680 --> 53:35.880
I'll work for $19 an hour.

53:35.880 --> 53:37.280
You can't design shit.

53:37.280 --> 53:38.280
Okay.

53:38.280 --> 53:39.280
I can't design shit.

53:39.280 --> 53:41.360
I can out design anything.

53:41.360 --> 53:44.440
To his credit, he did make O L I N S P dot com, which was pretty kick out.

53:44.440 --> 53:48.240
I mean that, that was, that was something that like other people that weren't even into

53:48.240 --> 53:52.360
video games were looking at us like, wow, this is a great PSP like base.

53:52.360 --> 53:54.640
Now I can't a very good job.

53:54.640 --> 54:00.320
Now I can't promise that I will continue to update sites, but I can design it the first

54:00.320 --> 54:01.320
time.

54:01.320 --> 54:02.320
Okay.

54:02.320 --> 54:03.320
What is, what is CMYK?

54:03.320 --> 54:08.600
Here's CMYNK it's cyan, yellow, magenta, black, except you got the wrong order.

54:08.600 --> 54:09.600
I don't give a crap.

54:09.600 --> 54:11.480
You asked what it was, what's an ink limit.

54:11.480 --> 54:12.480
Shut up.

54:12.480 --> 54:13.480
You two both.

54:13.480 --> 54:14.480
What's that game?

54:14.480 --> 54:15.480
Okay.

54:15.480 --> 54:18.360
Here's, here's, I'm just giving you a hard time.

54:18.360 --> 54:20.320
Here's the difference between Loki, the designer and dark soccer.

54:20.320 --> 54:23.280
The designer Loki is a man in dark soccer as a woman.

54:23.280 --> 54:26.360
Therefore Loki starts projects and never finishes them.

54:26.360 --> 54:29.040
Then again, you've started a lot of projects that you don't please.

54:29.040 --> 54:31.000
Hey, I'm finishing a lot of stuff.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.680
I've just keep starting something too.

54:32.680 --> 54:38.840
Except my, except I just got paid for my, some of my work, which is, which is good.

54:38.840 --> 54:40.560
Being paid for doing design is good.

54:40.560 --> 54:45.680
I, it's funny cause I had another idea to start some more projects, but whatever, whatever

54:45.680 --> 54:48.600
happened to olrwee.com, whatever happened to that.

54:48.600 --> 54:52.080
Brad from Pod Culture says, um, Capcom where spell check doesn't exist.

54:52.080 --> 54:56.440
I'll tell you what happened to that is that no one uses the Wii web browser, so that's

54:56.440 --> 54:57.960
what happened to that.

54:57.960 --> 55:03.840
And tiger claw people would not get all F's because I would just beat them in the face

55:03.840 --> 55:08.480
and I would, I would expel anybody, I would expel anybody from my class.

55:08.480 --> 55:15.320
It got less than a C. All right, I just wouldn't have class moving on more news, less bickering

55:15.320 --> 55:19.240
Loki and you know, tiger claw, I know that you say that anything with spelling errors

55:19.240 --> 55:24.320
is going to be a collector's item, but not when they're, when you put out there widespread,

55:24.320 --> 55:27.320
what's also really easy to print fakes.

55:27.320 --> 55:30.840
I would think, I mean somebody like dark soccer could probably spot a fake.

55:30.840 --> 55:36.120
I have, I have to, I have to point out something just for the chat room to clarify.

55:36.120 --> 55:38.080
Loki's got natural design talent.

55:38.080 --> 55:45.920
If he were, had the schooling to go behind it, he'd be out there making bank.

55:45.920 --> 55:51.560
And I will say this offhand, a lot of talent just needs to know how to use the other software

55:51.560 --> 55:53.440
that we all have to know how to use.

55:53.440 --> 55:54.940
Now you want to know what's hilarious.

55:54.940 --> 55:59.920
I have no design talent whatsoever and yet I actually did do design for a short time

55:59.920 --> 56:01.560
before I was in insurance.

56:01.560 --> 56:03.720
I'll tell you, I'll tell you this too.

56:03.720 --> 56:04.800
Isn't that ironic?

56:04.800 --> 56:10.400
I um, I just got done, well not just got done, but I read the biography of Joe Simon, who's

56:10.400 --> 56:14.200
one of the guys that created Captain America and he was talking about back in the day that

56:14.200 --> 56:21.000
it was just natural talent and honing your own talent and he got jobs as designers doing

56:21.000 --> 56:27.980
photo touch ups, you know, in the, you know, depression era, but he, you know, back then

56:27.980 --> 56:29.960
it was all, what's your raw talent?

56:29.960 --> 56:31.040
Can you do this?

56:31.040 --> 56:32.420
Do you know how to use the software?

56:32.420 --> 56:35.720
And now it's like, they require so much more education.

56:35.720 --> 56:38.300
They don't care how well you know how to use everything.

56:38.300 --> 56:41.020
They want you to have the degree that says you know how to use it, which doesn't always

56:41.020 --> 56:42.280
mean you know how to do shit.

56:42.280 --> 56:45.560
Not everybody though, because I will tell you that the publisher I used to work for

56:45.560 --> 56:49.780
was very much, you know what, to me, work experience is very, very valuable.

56:49.780 --> 56:52.720
So you know, I'll just, I'll just say that there are some, tell that to the places I've

56:52.720 --> 56:53.720
been applying at.

56:53.720 --> 56:54.960
Some smart publishers out there.

56:54.960 --> 56:59.400
Anyhow, um, quickly coming from our chat room, JV Mon in our chat room at chat.onwinsocialmedia.com

56:59.400 --> 57:02.300
says, ugh, the Wii browser is terra bad.

57:02.300 --> 57:04.840
It's faster using AOL dial up.

57:04.840 --> 57:05.840
Yikes.

57:05.840 --> 57:11.880
Well, the problem is like no one's really using that anymore.

57:11.880 --> 57:13.840
No one's really using the PSP web browser anymore.

57:13.840 --> 57:16.820
I mean, there's a few people that are, but you're in the minority.

57:16.820 --> 57:22.280
Most everyone's using, you know, some sort of web browser on your phone, on your iPod,

57:22.280 --> 57:23.820
iPad, something like that.

57:23.820 --> 57:29.200
So to make a site dedicated to like the PSP or even the PlayStation V. And to be honest,

57:29.200 --> 57:33.500
you don't really need a website dedicated to the PlayStation Vita because hell, I pulled

57:33.500 --> 57:34.500
up our site on there.

57:34.500 --> 57:35.500
It looks great.

57:35.500 --> 57:40.960
I mean, any website looks great on as long as you don't put flash in there, you know,

57:40.960 --> 57:42.640
which God, my, my God.

57:42.640 --> 57:43.640
Okay.

57:43.640 --> 57:48.280
Why can't they put HTML five in a web browser on this stupid device and why can't they do

57:48.280 --> 57:49.280
that?

57:49.280 --> 57:50.280
Is it slow?

57:50.280 --> 57:51.280
Maybe.

57:51.280 --> 57:52.280
I don't know.

57:52.280 --> 57:55.480
Slows down memory loss, but it is from what I understand quite a bit more efficient than

57:55.480 --> 58:00.320
flashes lately, unless you're just fully putting full animation in something you don't need

58:00.320 --> 58:03.680
to have, have flash.

58:03.680 --> 58:05.360
So I don't, I don't get it.

58:05.360 --> 58:06.640
I can do flash.

58:06.640 --> 58:08.880
I don't like flash.

58:08.880 --> 58:10.360
I would rather do it in HTML.

58:10.360 --> 58:12.520
All right, let's move on Loki.

58:12.520 --> 58:13.720
All right.

58:13.720 --> 58:17.720
Let's talk a little bit about, um, Nintendo.

58:17.720 --> 58:22.900
And uh, this is kind of neat and see I'm have a few speculations on what this could mean,

58:22.900 --> 58:28.100
but Nintendo has acquired a video research and a kind of like a video middleware company

58:28.100 --> 58:30.480
called Moby Clip.

58:30.480 --> 58:37.640
And Moby Clip, uh, mainly they were kind of focused on, uh, video compression for Game

58:37.640 --> 58:40.360
Boy Advance DS and 3DS games.

58:40.360 --> 58:44.360
Now what I'm thinking this could be used for is a few things.

58:44.360 --> 58:52.360
Either A, they're gonna, you know, do some more video streaming stuff to the 3DS or B,

58:52.360 --> 58:57.960
it's for working on the Wii U and getting that, you know, video data compressed enough

58:57.960 --> 59:04.360
to where they can stream either a higher resolution or something like that to the Wii U's tablet.

59:04.360 --> 59:05.360
That's a really good thought.

59:05.360 --> 59:09.440
I was actually going in the direction of those, um, movies on the cartridge, you know, uh,

59:09.440 --> 59:12.200
for the 3DS because we still don't have the 3D movies.

59:12.200 --> 59:17.680
I'm kind of curious if anyone's picked up Tekken, um, Tekken Prime 3D Edition or whatever,

59:17.680 --> 59:24.240
or Tekken 3D Prime Edition, um, and how that 3D movie looks on the 3DS would be kind of

59:24.240 --> 59:25.240
interesting.

59:25.240 --> 59:26.240
I have not.

59:26.240 --> 59:27.240
Anybody in chat maybe?

59:27.240 --> 59:28.240
We'll see.

59:28.240 --> 59:29.240
So.

59:29.240 --> 59:34.760
Um, so, I mean, Nintendo was already working with this company anyway, right?

59:34.760 --> 59:38.200
So this whole acquisition isn't like gonna change the world, right?

59:38.200 --> 59:39.200
No, it's not.

59:39.200 --> 59:41.560
It's pro- why would you just bring them in under your wing?

59:41.560 --> 59:44.220
Cause you plan on using them a lot, right?

59:44.220 --> 59:49.200
They have something that you want and that you don't want anyone else to have.

59:49.200 --> 59:52.920
Like, for example, if you think about it, this company say they, they did find a way

59:52.920 --> 01:00:00.880
to a really good algorithm or, you know, some sort of tool that can compress stuff and do

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:04.600
like high definition video or, you know, really good video.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:09.000
And for this type of application, they don't want the Vita PS3 having that same technology.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.160
They don't want the PS3 pad or the Xbox, you know, tablet thing or whatever they have.

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.160
If that turns out to be true.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.160
Yeah.

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:18.320
I mean, they don't want them coming up with something like that and using that kind of

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:19.320
technology.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:21.440
For example, same thing with the Kinect.

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:25.480
Remember that company that developed the Kinect, Microsoft bought them because they don't want

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:27.120
anyone else developing their own Kinect.

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:28.120
Oh, that's true.

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.120
Okay.

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:30.120
That makes sense.

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:31.120
Yeah.

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.120
So maybe, maybe they cracked the case.

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:33.120
Who knows?

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.560
But this, this acquisition actually happened a while ago.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:36.560
We're just now seeing the papers filed on it.

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:37.560
Yes.

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:38.560
That makes it complete.

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:39.560
It was back in October.

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:40.560
Interesting.

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:41.560
All right.

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:44.840
So for that gamer, I have some news for you, both of you out there.

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:45.840
No, I'm just kidding.

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:46.840
I'm kidding.

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:47.840
Don't send the hate mail in.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:53.520
Uh, there is some new gaming related stuff coming to OS X Mountain Lion in the way of

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:54.520
Game Center.

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:58.960
Uh, Game Center is kind of, I don't know, not really there.

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:01.000
I mean, yes, it's on the iPhone.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.440
You have achievements or what do they call it?

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:06.680
Is it just achievements on the iPhone Game Center, iOS?

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:10.580
I can't remember, but you do have those, you know, things that you can earn on there and

01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:13.160
kind of see what your friends are playing and all that, but it doesn't really do that

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:14.280
much else.

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:19.160
But it is coming, uh, to OS X, uh, with the Mountain Lion update.

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:23.280
Uh, apparently it will add some new stuff though.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:27.520
I didn't even know this was in there, but voice chat will make its way.

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:31.320
I didn't think that was already in Game Center, but some are saying it is.

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.320
I didn't think voice chat was.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.320
I don't think so.

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:34.960
I thought, I didn't know that was there.

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:38.480
But it would make, it would make sense if it can kind of interface with the Mac that

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.480
way.

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:42.200
I don't see where they're, why they're doing that because they're trying to, you know,

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:45.600
tie in the stuff that's popular on iOS devices into the Mac.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:51.520
Just like say FaceTime, you know, one of the, uh, hideously underused feature of the iOS

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:52.520
device.

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:53.520
That's awesome.

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:59.600
Uh, but you can, you know, kind of cross do that between the iPhone, iPad and the Mac.

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:03.800
I think the only reason why people don't use FaceTime is because they're Skype and people

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.680
use Skype a lot more.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.680
On the computer.

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:07.680
Yeah.

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:08.680
But I like having a phone.

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:10.640
There's only only one person that ever Skypes with me.

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:14.200
I have a friend in the Bay Area and once in a while she buys something really funny that

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:16.880
she wants to like literally show me, so she'll FaceTime me.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:20.820
But otherwise I think FaceTime's biggest drawback is that it doesn't work on 3G.

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:23.820
I know there's competitors out there that do work on 3G.

01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:27.160
I'm aware of that, but Intel Apple kind of officially endorses it.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:30.960
Um, I think that's one of its biggest kind of drawbacks and maybe they're worried about

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:31.960
the quality.

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:32.960
I don't know, but you're right.

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:36.840
Skype will do 3G, but Skype isn't integrated into the fricking phone.

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.880
You have to download it separately and not everybody does that.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:43.960
You can do it on 3G, but you have to have it jailbroken before you can do that.

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:47.440
So well, again, not something that's integrated into it normally.

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:48.440
Yeah.

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:52.600
So, uh, Black Wolf in our chat room, of course, the man before us at All Games Radio says

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:57.320
there are voice chat APIs available to iOS developers as part of game kit.

01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:00.760
Not many people implement it though, so I guess, I guess, I don't know.

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:03.040
It's just not the same type of gaming on the iPhone.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:06.200
Like who would you talk to playing Angry Birds?

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:07.640
Well, Angry Birds isn't really-

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.080
I talk to Angry Birds.

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.080
I could think maybe-

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:11.920
I go, I hate this game!

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:13.920
Every time I play it, so.

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:18.660
There's a lot of games though, I don't think there's a lot that you play at the same time.

01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:23.080
Like Words With Friends and stuff like that, it's usually, okay, I'm gonna do my move now

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:25.080
and that's it.

01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:26.600
You just kind of play it on your own time.

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:30.400
It's not like, okay, hey, pop out your phone right now, we're gonna play a game of whatever,

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:31.400
you know?

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:32.400
Right, right.

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:33.640
Alright, let's move on.

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:37.680
Three states coming up very soon after one more story, DarkSakura.

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:38.680
Mantis.

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:40.960
Sorry, that's not the story.

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:41.960
No.

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:46.320
I just found something that was more, that was worse than the frilly dog panties.

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.320
Mantis.

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:48.320
Dear God.

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:49.320
What?

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:50.320
Mantis are worse than frilly dog panties.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:53.000
We've had this discussion on the show before and I don't want to have it again.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.600
So how about something that has absolutely nothing to do with mantis?

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:57.600
Please.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.600
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:00.600
Yay!

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:04.720
Heroes and a Manti.

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:06.760
Now I'm picturing Michelangelo and a Manti.

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:07.760
Don't picture that.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:10.440
I'm gonna have to draw that.

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:11.440
No!

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:12.960
No, you don't draw that.

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:15.520
This is not deviant art.

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:17.280
This isn't 4chan.

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:18.280
That would be hilarious.

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:22.940
Anyway, um, it was actually spotted by Ninja Pizza.

01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:29.400
There was a poster that was displayed at Toy Fair 2012 that showed a list of activity around

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:34.720
the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon series and at the bottom it says cross promotions

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:40.720
with key licenses including IDW comic book publisher and Activision.

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:46.640
So it could possibly be that Activision is doing a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game.

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:48.280
Who knows?

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:52.400
They haven't been attached with them before but maybe they will.

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:56.520
I like the last one that came up was that horrible Wii game.

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:58.080
And Ubisoft do that or something?

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.040
Yeah, it was another company had it at the time.

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:03.800
Yeah, it was published by Ubisoft and then before that was Konami.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:05.200
Well technically there was two Wii games.

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:09.160
There was one for the movie, the TMNT thing, then there was also the one that was like

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:10.160
Smash Brothers.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:13.920
Yeah, I'm talking about Smash Up.

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:17.260
You know how many times that they freaking rebooted the Ninja Turtles?

01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:18.260
You know what I want them to do?

01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:19.260
Huh?

01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:21.880
I want them to go back to the original Ninja Turtles, you know, the ones that were all

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:27.560
black and white or the only color they wore was red, and do like a big RPG based off the

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:28.560
original Turtles.

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:30.700
I want a music game with the Ninja Rap.

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:34.680
Go Ninja, go Ninja, go.

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:36.440
Come on, it'd be awesome.

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:40.840
I had, okay, this, honestly, I had no idea they were doing yet another new cartoon.

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:42.280
Like, I was like, really?

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:43.280
There's another one?

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:47.560
Well, like, the last one that I remembered watching, they had done, okay, they had done

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:52.200
like the one that was on in the late 80s and early 90s that, you know, I was watching as

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:55.500
a young teenager and my brothers were watching as kids.

01:05:55.500 --> 01:06:00.160
And then they did another one for a while that was supposed to be pretty much a little

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:02.560
bit, you know, a little bit more on the hardcore side.

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:06.720
And then, um, the last thing that I watched actually was from that series where they went

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:13.720
back into their other universes, and they went back with the original Turtle universe,

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:16.600
and they were all like, you guys are bitches.

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.840
So this is all CGI, it looks like, Tiger Claw Link.

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:21.880
It doesn't look like very good CGI either.

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:23.020
Was that like Dun and Poser?

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:24.020
You know what, though?

01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:29.200
This, um, could, this looks like it could be easily be a video game.

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:32.940
With the technology we have today, I could be looking at screenshots from a video game.

01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:34.400
I would not know the difference.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:35.400
To be real.

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:40.480
That looks like really, I hope those are just preliminary shots because those textures are

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:41.480
just horrendous.

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:45.440
Maybe it's, well, keep in mind, I think these are pictures of posters, so you're probably

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:46.440
losing some detail.

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:48.760
I don't think I'm losing anything.

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:54.480
But, um, maybe it's all Mashima is what it comes down to.

01:06:54.480 --> 01:07:01.560
Well at any rate, at any rate, you know, I've, it better be, I just really don't have a whole

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:04.640
lot of faith in it being much better.

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:10.320
Well, um, one interesting kind of tie in, because you were talking about kind of the

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:14.560
license through the days and how Konami had it and, you know, I guess Ubisoft may not

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:21.200
have it now looking at this story, but, um, the eight bit Ninja Turtle game that's on

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:24.640
virtual console right now is getting pulled or got pulled.

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:28.080
I think it's getting pulled soon because it sucks.

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:31.680
I like the original game, but that's, I like the arcade game.

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:33.520
That's one of those games I see through rose colored glasses.

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:36.200
It was awesome when you're nine, but now it's probably crap.

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:37.200
Okay.

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:38.200
Do the water level without cursing.

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:41.200
You know what I'm talking about?

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:47.320
Rocket seaweed, but that game is no longer going to be on virtual console.

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:48.320
Good.

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:51.760
You know, actually, you know, it's funny, you know what virtual console did get this

01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:52.760
week?

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:56.660
Finally, finally, after years and years, it's like the first virtual console game to come

01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:58.240
out in like nine months.

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:01.360
You know what game they got Genesis game?

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:02.360
Strider.

01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:03.360
Yes, that's right.

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:07.340
Cause Dan was talking about it and I'm like, you don't need another version of Strider.

01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:10.240
You really don't need another version of Strider.

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.880
You already have that version of Strider.

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.280
We do have that version of Strider.

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:14.840
I have beaten that version of Strider.

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.320
I have not beaten it in the arcade, but I've beaten the Genesis one.

01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:20.280
All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and what's coming

01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:21.800
out to a game store near you.

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:25.560
Gee, I wonder, I wonder what could be dominating the US releases this week.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:26.560
Loki.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:28.680
Not as many as you would think because most of them will last week.

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:37.600
So now this week we've got a Metal Gear Solid 3D Snake Eater on the 3DS of course.

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:43.680
We've got Shinobido to Revenge of Zen, which is basically by the guys that do Tenchu.

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:45.120
And that's on the Vita.

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:48.680
Touch My Katamari on the Vita this week as well.

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:52.240
Prevolution Soccer 2012 on the 3DS.

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:57.240
Syndicate on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:01.680
Asura's Wrath on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:03.080
Some more Vita titles.

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:06.280
Army Corps of Hell on the Vita.

01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:12.320
Dynasty Warriors Next, Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus on the Vita, of course the Vita system.

01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:17.400
Both the 3G and the Wi-Fi only version are launching this week as well.

01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:23.960
Poke Park 2 on the Wii and that's it.

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:27.200
All right then let's look at Japan and some of the games coming out in Japan this week.

01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:29.360
On the Xbox 360, Asura's Wrath.

01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:33.600
Now no telling if the spelling is wrong in Japanese as well, but it's coming out there

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:35.280
so you can let us know.

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:38.000
Entaku no Saito, Students of Round.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.040
I think that's a price reduction on an existing game.

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:46.320
Naruto Shippuden, Narutamite Storm Generation comes out on the 360 this week as well as

01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:49.840
Darkness 2, and Under Defeat HD.

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:53.760
I haven't heard of Under Defeat, it looks like a helicopter game, so kind of like a

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:56.200
shooter game on the 360.

01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:59.260
Going over to the Playstation 3 and checking out what's coming out there.

01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:03.800
Some of the same stuff, Asura's Wrath there as well, Naruto Shippuden, but some other

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:09.400
different games, Galgun comes out in regular and limited flavors this week on the Playstation

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.200
3.

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:17.520
This is the whole, I think shooting pheromones gun, yeah isn't this the whole like making

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:21.320
teenage girls fall in love with you by, I think you're fighting them off or something

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:25.580
I don't really know what the storyline was but it was it's an on-rails shooter game that

01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:31.080
uses the Playstation Move controller, let's just say it's not coming out here in the States.

01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:37.720
But thanks to the region free ability of the Playstation 3, it can be yours if you so wish.

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:43.520
Alright, let's see also, totally importing, Fight Night Champion getting a prize reduction.

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:47.760
It's actually not that bad of a game, I like the Xbox 360 one, I thought it was fun.

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:53.800
Shinken de Watashi no Koi Shinasi R comes out this week on the Playstation 3.

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:57.560
This is labeled as an adventure game, it looks like yet another one of those games that's

01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:02.920
heavy on the dialogue and kind of like simulator games.

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:06.240
But it doesn't look like a dating game, it looks like kind of something else, but I don't

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:11.200
see any like action screenshots, just all like talking and anime clip scenes and all

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:12.200
that.

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.200
So these...

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.200
And leaning over with a big bust.

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:16.440
Yes, of course, of course.

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:18.760
Gotta emphasize dem boobies.

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:20.880
Lots of stuff on the Playstation 3 this week.

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:29.680
Shadow Master, volume 5, Under Defeat, also on the PS3, Darkness 2, and Tachishio Love

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:32.040
Application.

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:35.240
I'll just let you decide what that game's all about.

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:37.320
Applicate your love.

01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:42.360
On the Vita this week in Japan, At Field, Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus, and Little Busters

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:50.200
Converted Edition come out on the Playstation Vita this week, and quickly checking the 3DS.

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:56.200
Bokuju Monogatari Hajimari no Daichi comes out this week from Marvelous on the 3DS.

01:11:56.200 --> 01:12:01.040
I'm trying to see if this is a version of a game we have here.

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:03.760
It looks kind of...

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:09.840
God damn it, what's that farming game from Natsume?

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:10.840
Harvest Moon?

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:14.120
It looks Harvest Moon-y to me, because look, they're growing eggplants there and they're

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:15.120
harvesting chickens.

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:17.360
It's not Harvest Moon, but it's like a 3D version of that.

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:18.360
There's no cows.

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:20.160
Yeah, well, she's wearing a cow hat.

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:23.800
Nope, there's a cow right there, a cute little fat-ass cow right there.

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:24.800
Any sheep?

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:25.800
And a sheep.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:26.800
Okay.

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:27.800
That is Harvest Moon.

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:33.280
This is like a Zynga-type Harvest Moon game coming out in Japan.

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:34.280
There you go.

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:35.280
That's it for Japanese.

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.080
It's not Harvest Moon, it's Harvest Noon.

01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:39.280
You're saying it's Farmville then.

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:41.680
Basically, yeah, it's Farmville instead of Farmtown.

01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:46.960
All right, anyhow, moving on, Dark Sakura, how about Across the Pond?

01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:50.360
Just assume this is Vita, unless I say differently, okay?

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:51.360
Yes.

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:52.360
This is on the 22nd.

01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:56.000
Army Corps of Hell, BlazBlue Continuum, Shift Extend, Dynasty Warriors.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:03.600
Next, Escape Plan, Everybody's Goth, Gravity Rush, Hustle Kings, Little Deviants, Luminous

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:09.120
Electronic Symphony, ModRation Nature's... ModNation Rager's...

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:10.400
Back, back, back, back up, back up.

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:12.400
Did you say a game called Everybody's Goth?

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:13.400
Goth?

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.440
Oh, I thought she said Everybody's Goth.

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:17.920
I'm like, is this 1994?

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:26.360
Today on Goth Talk, we'll explore, has Hot Topic deceived us?

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:28.420
Have they abandoned us?

01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:33.040
With always my co-host, Azraelibus Prince of Sorrow.

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:36.240
You know, I know it sounds like we're making fun, but seriously, that was my crowd in high

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:37.240
school, so whatever.

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:38.240
Yeah, same here.

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:45.640
ModNation Racer's Road Trip, MotorStormRC, Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus, the Vita itself,

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:53.520
Reality Fighters, Shinobido II, Revenge of Zen, oh, Shinobido, sorry, I was reading it

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:54.520
wrong.

01:13:54.520 --> 01:14:00.800
Super Stardust Delta, Top Darts, Touch My Katamari Baby, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:06.600
3, Uncharted Golden Abyss, Virtual Tennis 4, Wipeout 2048, and on the 24th, we have

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:13.960
Binary Domain on the 360 and PS3, and Hyperdimension Neptunia MK2 on PS3, Syndicate on the Xbox

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:16.840
360 and Playstation 3, The Last Story on Wii.

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:20.640
I'm surprised that they're getting Gravity Rush so early.

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:26.080
I may have to import that, if it's in English, which I would assume it is.

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:27.080
Mayhaps it may be.

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:29.000
Because it's not coming out over here until May.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:34.620
Same day as Resistance, too, so that's a tough one.

01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:39.640
By the way, completely off the record, well, not off, but having nothing to do with this,

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:44.200
I've decided to play through Mother 3, because I hate my life and I want to cry.

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:45.200
Have fun with that.

01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:46.200
It's depressing.

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:48.360
Well, maybe you should be playing everybody's goth then.

01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:53.040
I'm trying to imagine how that game would play.

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:56.280
You go around trying to convert the jocks and the cheerleaders.

01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:00.320
No, you go around trying to avoid the jocks and the cheerleaders.

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:02.760
With your goth gun.

01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:05.560
And yes, it fires bats.

01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:14.680
And you have to raise the depression level of everyone around you, but maintaining that

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:18.300
you have a higher depression level than the rest of them, and being tragic.

01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:22.760
And you get a cure bar, which basically will allow you to blast Robert Smith for a certain

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:26.040
amount of time, that will weaken the enemies.

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:30.360
At full blast, you play Fascination Street, you know, when it's very low, it plays Friday

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:32.520
I'm in Love.

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:36.200
You might get, like, there might be DLC that will change it to the Smiths, you know, or

01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:37.200
something like that.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.200
Yeah, that's what you do.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:39.200
It should progress.

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:41.420
Like, the Smiths would be the ultimate in depression.

01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:44.760
Or no, eventually you get to Bauhaus level.

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:47.320
Bella Lugosi is down.

01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:51.440
Loki, save us.

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:56.980
So Sony, seeing that they have a great storyline in the Twisted Metal series, they are going

01:15:56.980 --> 01:16:03.000
to be, or they have begun preparations for a Twisted Metal movie, which I gotta say,

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.120
that sounds pretty awesome.

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:06.400
Unfortunately it's probably getting pretty lame.

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:10.000
But you know, they kind of started that off a little early with the new Twisted Metal

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:15.520
game having live action cut scenes, and of course they're expecting to have the same

01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:22.980
characters from the last Twisted Metal game in this actual movie as well, so neat.

01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:30.560
It's being developed by, looks like Avi and Ari Arad, who I guess have worked with the

01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:42.140
Spider-Man series, and yeah, and I guess they signed a deal with the writer and director

01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:50.440
Brian Taylor, who he did the Crank movies, Jonah Hex, and the last Ghost Rider flick.

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:53.080
Well, that doesn't sound like it's gonna suck at all.

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.880
Well, at least we know he knows how to crash cars.

01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:58.000
So he is good at crashing cars.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.760
He's a car crashing expert.

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:05.760
It's too bad David Carradine didn't live long enough to see this.

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:07.400
That is too bad.

01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:09.800
But he did live long enough for Kill Bill.

01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:14.720
But hey, you know what, and I understand that he may not necessarily be part of the lore

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:17.860
for Twisted Metal.

01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:23.040
There is still Sylvester Stallone, and he could probably come back as Machine Gun Joe.

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:24.040
That's true.

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.040
What's he doing these days?

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.040
Is he Expendables?

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:27.040
Expendables 2.

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:28.040
Whoopee!

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:29.040
Well, actually, no, he has quite a few movies.

01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:33.680
He has Expendables 2, he has two more movies with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:37.740
That's right, Arnold's gone back to acting.

01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:41.560
He needs to go back to exercising, too, because, whoa!

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:47.480
I mean, that's pretty wrong of me saying that, but, you know, that's insane.

01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:48.480
No, right?

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:54.120
Here he was, we've got the man who was elected by Ronald Reagan to be our, you know, the

01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:58.880
person we attain, you know, we looked for as a role model for fitness, who was, what

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:02.400
was it, the president's fitness shit thing?

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:03.400
I'm not gonna lie, though.

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:07.720
If I'm that fit at that age, I'll be happy.

01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:09.920
There's a very easy way for you to get that fit.

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:11.200
Stop eating that.

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:12.200
No.

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:13.840
It comes in a needle.

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:15.720
It comes with a needle in a little glass.

01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:16.720
Oh, no.

01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:17.720
Steroids.

01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:19.880
Because that's how he did it.

01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:21.880
Crack his wack, yo.

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:24.920
Oh, I see those receipts.

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:26.600
I don't believe it.

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:30.360
Don't make me get out the Whitney Houston interview, so I might say it's in bad taste.

01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:36.880
All right, um, actually, I gotta say, I have, I have, I've become a lot more active lately.

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:37.880
I really have.

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:40.040
I mean, this is only within, like, the past, like, week and a half, so, you know, it's

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:42.840
not really a habit yet, which is why I haven't been talking about it a lot, but there's two

01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:44.440
things to credit with it.

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:46.720
One of them would be the site Fitocracy.

01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:48.680
I don't know how many of you guys know about this website, but-

01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:49.680
I signed up for it.

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:54.080
It helps you kind of like, it turns tracking your fitness into a role-playing game with,

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:58.560
like, achievements and everything, and, you know, obviously, a lot of it is on your honor,

01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:02.240
you know, because sure, I could sit, put in there and say, I did 100 sit-ups today, but,

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:06.200
you know, if you didn't do it, then you're only, you're losing, so, you know, it's kind

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:12.720
of helped motivate you and so forth, and I gotta say, as crazy as this sounds, and I,

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:18.400
I know I'll get called sell-out or whatever, but Rhythm Party got me up and moving and

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:24.160
remembering how good it feels to play DER for 30 minutes, again, and I really do credit

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:25.760
Rhythm Party, which had DLC this week.

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:28.760
I don't even think that comes, comes up in our show tonight, so I'll say it now.

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:31.240
They finally put out DLC for Rhythm Party this week.

01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:38.200
The downside is it's all Konami originals, but the upside is, oh my god, the collaborations

01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:39.840
are hilarious.

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:42.800
Do you know who Naoki collaborated with this time?

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:43.800
Tiffany.

01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:44.800
Awesome.

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:46.800
Where does he?

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:53.760
I know, and then one of the songs has, um, who are, who are the, the, the sister sledge?

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:54.760
You remember sister sledge?

01:19:54.760 --> 01:20:00.560
We are family, the, the oldest sister sledge, the one that was the vocalist, is in another

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:01.560
collaboration.

01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:07.680
Like, it's all these, like, washed up fucking 80s and 70s vocalists are now in DDR, or Rhythm

01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:14.720
Party, excuse me, songs, but unfortunately, Rhythm Party's weakest thing is like, okay,

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:21.640
it's got Born This Way by Gaga and nothing else contemporary.

01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:24.840
I'm sorry, Bobby Brown is not contemporary.

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:26.080
More contemporary now though.

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:31.840
It is now, by sheer luck, but it was not supposed to be contemporary.

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:33.840
Um, the songs are decent though.

01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:35.840
I wasn't, the songs are surprisingly decent.

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:36.840
You know, they're not.

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:38.880
I, I enjoy it more than Dance Masters.

01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:39.880
I will stand by that.

01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:40.880
It's a, it's a way better.

01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:43.000
Dance Masters theme happens to be part of that.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.120
Yeah, that wasn't a download pack too.

01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:47.120
So anyhow, sorry.

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:48.120
See the thing.

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:50.040
I didn't mean to get on a tangent, but like I have been on a fitness kick lately.

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:51.040
See the thing with nice.

01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:55.520
The thing with me though is I don't like really allocate myself that much time because you

01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:59.320
know, when I get home from work, I got to watch the, you know, my son until he goes

01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:00.320
to bed at eight.

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:06.720
So I have a short window between eight o'clock and 11 p.m. to have dinner, relax for a little

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:07.720
bit.

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:09.080
It's like, okay, where am I going to fit fitness in there?

01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:12.240
Yes, I could do it, but then again at the same time, that's the only free time I have

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:13.240
all day.

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:14.360
I got to fit in games in there.

01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:18.000
I'm going to fit and working on stuff I want to work on, you know, and I understand it's

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.780
just, I don't prioritize it enough.

01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:21.320
I'll throw this out there.

01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:26.160
Um, I, I, it may not work for your situation, but one like kind of goal I made is that I

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:29.800
try to walk a mile every day and I do that on my breaks at work.

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:33.780
I do it on my break and I have an application on my phone called Runkeeper that helps me

01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:36.820
and it funny, Runkeeper ties into Fitocracy.

01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:41.840
So every time I walk it will say on my Fitocracy, you walked 1.2 miles today.

01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:43.000
And so I do that on my break.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.720
I mean that's, that's what I've been trying to do.

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:52.000
Well, I'll tell you too, um, when I, cause keep in mind, I was up there a few years ago

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.900
and that's how I lost all of my weight was by cutting down, way down on sugar and walking

01:21:56.900 --> 01:21:59.260
every day at work during my lunch break.

01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:03.760
And that was when I was working off of downtown, off of Alhambra and walking around the house.

01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:06.000
That big park twice.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.120
So yeah, I don't know how, but I ballooned up at the end of last year, so I'm trying

01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:11.120
to lose it.

01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:12.120
Yoga.

01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:13.920
And I'm actually planning on getting the connect yoga.

01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:19.360
I started taking yoga twice a week and now I do it every day and I have noticed, um,

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:23.700
well, I'm, I'm not going to actually say the number or anything, but I've, since I've started

01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:30.320
taking yoga and cut out all bread, I am now down seven pounds from when I started.

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:31.920
So congrats.

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:35.880
So yeah, just making little changes and incorporating some activity into your life is amazing.

01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:39.000
You'll, you'll, you'll find a place to squeeze it in.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.320
You know, I would love to, I had lift weights, do sit up, do 25 sit ups before you go to

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:44.320
bed.

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:45.320
Well, not before you go to bed.

01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:46.320
Cause then you'll be up all night.

01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:48.040
Do 25 sit ups right when you get home.

01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:50.920
I've seriously thought about building new DDR pads.

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:54.720
I have sheet metal in my garage dedicated.

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:58.880
I can't because of the proximity to my son's room, it would be too loud.

01:22:58.880 --> 01:22:59.880
Yeah.

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:00.880
All right, well moving on.

01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:02.480
Let's get back into a video game talk.

01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:05.480
I want to do a follow up to something we were talking about last week, which was the double

01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:08.100
fine funding that happened through Kickstarter.

01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:09.520
They're going to break 2 million.

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:12.440
I mean there's still 22 days left on that thing and I just checked it earlier today.

01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:13.800
It was at 1.9 million.

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:16.960
So they're going to easily break 2 million, maybe make two and a half.

01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:17.960
I don't know.

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:22.000
Uh, but double fine did, uh, kind of put out their first video that, you know, obviously

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.440
thanks everybody and so forth and talks about what's going to happen because remember a

01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:30.200
big part of donating to this was that they were going to make the process transparent.

01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:32.100
You know, a lot of game companies don't do this.

01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:33.100
They need secrecy.

01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:37.640
They don't unveil things till E3, everything is kind of done in a bubble, but this whole,

01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:40.800
you know, part that, you know, they're trying to appeal to the masses is we're going to

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:44.320
have this whole process be transparent and they've already announced that there will

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:51.680
be a DRM free, uh, game that will be released on the PC, Mac and Linux when it launches.

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:55.320
Uh, there will be a closed beta that's going to happen on steam.

01:23:55.320 --> 01:24:00.280
Um, and now Tim Schafer said in an interview that went up on YouTube that because they

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:05.400
got more money, uh, they're going to also do it on iOS and certain types of Android

01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:06.400
phones.

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:08.320
So they're going to kind of expand to those platforms.

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:11.960
But it is important to note if you donate it to the project, you won't be able to get

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:17.960
the iOS and Android versions free because of the limitations of those types of distributions.

01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:23.640
Um, from what I remember of the Apple store, you can get a finite number of codes to give

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:24.780
away your product.

01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:28.440
Like it's gotta be a hundred or less, maybe even like 50 or 20.

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:33.240
But um, like, you know, with 30,000 people donating to this and counting, I think it's

01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:38.600
even more, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm just reading off the lowest tier even, um, they can't generate

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:40.040
that kind of codes on iOS.

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:45.600
So your, your free one that you get for donating will be the PC, Mac or Linux version.

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:51.240
But there will also be now this iOS and Linux one, uh, nothing about consoles yet.

01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:52.240
So there you go.

01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:53.240
Kind of the first update.

01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:55.640
You'll probably see more of this as it gets developed.

01:24:55.640 --> 01:25:00.320
That'd be funny if they put that on indie games.

01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:01.320
I guess they could.

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:02.320
Yeah.

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:06.240
File size is usually the only thing that's holding it back, but, um.

01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:07.240
You never know though.

01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:10.560
I mean, Xbox, Xbox is known for making exceptions.

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:12.040
So a high profile thing like this.

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:13.760
They'd probably put that Xbox library in.

01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:14.760
Yeah.

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:15.760
Might as well.

01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:16.760
Right.

01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:17.760
Yeah.

01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:20.800
So, all right, well, let's take a moment to walk down the halls of gaming's history.

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:21.800
You know, there was a time.

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:23.920
We didn't know anything.

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:28.360
The only stuff we knew about video games was what we read in Nintendo power or electronic

01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:29.480
gaming monthly.

01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:30.880
That's what we got to see development.

01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:32.040
We didn't have the internet.

01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:33.040
It looked like DOS.

01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:34.560
It was called AOL.

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:35.560
That's right.

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:36.560
Or 1.0.

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:39.920
Back in my day it was quantum link on the Commodore 64.

01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:40.920
We had beep.

01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:41.920
Yes.

01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:42.920
I had Prodigy.

01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:46.120
Oh, you know, we call it what the AOL users called it, at least in my group, Buttigy.

01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:47.120
We really called it.

01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:48.120
Hey, hey.

01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:49.120
And CompuSuck.

01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:53.680
Prodigy was fucking awesome on the old PCs because of the graphics and everything.

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:57.680
Anyway, I was just very, I was very loyal to Prodigy for a long time.

01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:00.560
I remember my old sign in, but anyway, we won't go there.

01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:02.920
We'll go to the classic game of the week.

01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:07.240
Dark Sakura is going to jump in the gaming vault and pick out one game she thinks, hey,

01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:08.320
play it.

01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:11.760
It is Rainbow Islands, the story of Bubble Bobble 2.

01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:13.280
You've been on a bobble kick lately.

01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:15.880
Well, I was inspired.

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:20.280
But any, and actually the music that I linked is probably one of the best home versions

01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:21.520
ever.

01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:25.800
This one is the PC Engine version, which is pretty much Arcade Perfect.

01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:29.760
Anyway, Rainbow Islands came out in 1987.

01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:31.680
It was by Taito.

01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:36.280
And it was a sequel to, as it says, Bubble Bobble.

01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:42.440
And the game, it was actually the second in the series.

01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:45.960
It was followed by Bubble Symphony and Bubble Memories.

01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:51.480
But it has two sequels, Parasol Stars and Bubble Bobble Part 2.

01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:53.640
So it's come out on like, darn your everything.

01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:54.960
It's kind of messed up.

01:26:54.960 --> 01:27:00.020
But the way that you get through that is you have to, you're on an island that you have

01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:02.880
to throw rainbows around to get to different platforms.

01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:08.760
And you can use the rainbows to shoot things, but they will eventually break down.

01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:15.760
You've also got this thing called the Hidden Depths, where it actually has a bunch of different

01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:19.840
secrets that you can find, like different levels and power ups and different riddles.

01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:25.400
And so it makes it, you can beat the game so many different ways.

01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:30.320
It also has a scoring system that has its own secrets too, so you can get different

01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:33.640
high scores by finding all the different stuff.

01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:38.600
So as I said, it's set on islands, ten of them, and they each have their different theme.

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:43.080
And you basically move, you know, to the next island in the chain by, you know, going around

01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:44.080
and passing the levels.

01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:45.960
And they get progressively more difficult.

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:50.720
You have faster enemies, and you can also go on a large map screen where you can see

01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:52.280
all the different islands.

01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:56.640
There are three secret islands that are not visible until the seven big diamonds are collected,

01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:58.840
which are hidden throughout the game.

01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:01.720
And actually, most home versions lack the secret islands.

01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:06.440
So you can release these rainbows, and they're weapons and platforms.

01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:11.320
And when you jump on them, they fall down and hit the enemies below it.

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:16.760
And different power ups can make you go faster, increase the speed of the rainbows, and let

01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:18.760
you spawn, I believe, up to three rainbows.

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:20.760
Isn't that right, Rob?

01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:21.760
Yes.

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:24.040
I think it was three was the max you could get.

01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:26.880
Just so you guys know, I love this game.

01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:30.960
Like I used to play this at Roseville Golf Land in between while waiting for DDR, because

01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:33.080
that was back when Ultracade was cool.

01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:36.020
And I used to play this in the Ultracade machine all the time.

01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:39.440
And people were like, what is that very homosexual game you are playing where you are literally

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:41.480
shooting rainbows?

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:44.360
It's Rainbow Islands, and it's awesome, you shut your judging mouth.

01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:50.720
Well, and the other thing that's good about the little rainbows, too, is that they actually

01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:55.360
protect you from overhead enemies taking big poops on you.

01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:59.840
So at any rate- That video finished, so I'm going to do the totally awesome Commodore

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:01.840
64 version of the game.

01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:02.840
Okay.

01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:07.040
Well, at any rate, if you take too long on the level, then water will rise up from the

01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:08.040
bottom.

01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:12.120
The main characters are Bubloon and Bobloon, who are basically Bub and Bob, but they are

01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:14.360
in human form as Bubby and Bobby.

01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:17.960
Which, just looking at Bubby makes me laugh, because that's also like the Yiddish word

01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:18.960
for grandmother.

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:19.960
Listen, Bubby.

01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:20.960
Bubby.

01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:23.720
And Bobby, Bobby's in this game.

01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:24.720
Yeah.

01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:25.720
Bobby's in the game.

01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:29.520
So they're not bubble dragons, they're, you know, people.

01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:34.480
And they have to take turns through the level, so Bubby is wearing a green shirt and Bobby

01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:36.200
is wearing a blue shirt.

01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:40.280
There's also Rainbow Island's extra version that's a modified version.

01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:44.400
It has the same thing, except the bosses are in different orders, the enemies are in different

01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:47.560
order, kind of like Bubble Bobble's super mode.

01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:49.920
And it came out in limited quantities.

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:55.020
Now, just to let you know, it actually was included in the Mega Drive version of Rainbow

01:29:55.020 --> 01:30:01.600
Islands, and the arcade version was actually licensed to Romstar to come out over in the

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:02.600
US.

01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:08.800
So, the version that I was playing of Bubble Bobble had that version on it, the PS1 collection,

01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:10.800
Bubble Bobble collection.

01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:15.520
So all the different versions that came out at home, there was a Commodore 64, which we

01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:21.200
just heard, the ZX Spectrum, an Amstrad CPC, there was an Amiga and Atari ST, the Mega

01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:27.880
Drive version, there was the NES version, which was not that great, the European version

01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:31.320
is also different than the Japanese version, just saying.

01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:34.760
Sorry, sorry for that little clip in the background that wasn't really from Rainbow Islands, it

01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:40.040
said it was the loading theme, but I think that was a universal loader thing back in

01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:42.560
Commodore 64 piracy days, so sorry.

01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:45.920
That clip was not actually from Rainbow Islands, I apologize.

01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:47.560
So we'll go to...

01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:48.560
Can I keep listing?

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:50.920
Yeah, but I need to find what system to do now.

01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:55.480
How about this one, I think this is Arcade, let's hope nobody's doing a voiceover on this

01:30:55.480 --> 01:30:56.480
one.

01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:58.480
The Arcade one that I found was really quiet.

01:30:58.480 --> 01:30:59.480
Yeah.

01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:02.680
It's alright, it needs to be quiet so you can talk over it.

01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:08.600
At any rate, we also had PC Engine Turbo Graphics, which was the first one that I linked as a

01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:09.600
cue card.

01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:15.320
There was also a PC Sega Saturn and Playstation version that was released as Bubble Bobble

01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:17.560
featuring Rainbow Islands, that's the one I was playing.

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:24.200
There's a WonderSwan version, Game Boy Color, PC, PS2, Xbox that came out as part of Taito

01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:25.200
Legends.

01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:33.360
A mobile version and Xbox Live Arcade version got one that was updated with 2.5T graphics.

01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:41.040
And then the Arcade game, now this is kinda neat, the music was actually based off Over

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:43.680
the Rainbow from the Wizard of Oz.

01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:50.440
And it came on the Mega Drive, PC Engine, and Famicom versions, but when it came out

01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:56.840
on the Master System, Saturn, all those other ones, they actually changed it so that they

01:31:56.840 --> 01:32:00.280
wouldn't risk copyright infringement.

01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:02.040
So yeah, that's the game that we have.

01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:05.480
Oh, and I do want to mention some regional differences.

01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:08.940
For the Sega Master System version and the European one, there was a glitch that made

01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:12.960
the game crash after level 7, so it sent you back to the title screen.

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:19.000
If you use the level select code to get to 8, the glitch happens at the end of that level

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.400
and you can't even see the ending.

01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:23.560
The Brazilian version, fixed it.

01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:29.080
And the European version of the NES port is actually a lot more like the Arcade version

01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:33.800
where the Japanese and North American versions have the original level designs and story

01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:34.800
versions.

01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:35.800
That's it.

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:41.460
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Rainbow Islands, on pretty much

01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:44.860
every frickin' console that was out at the time.

01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:46.520
And a few that weren't out at the time.

01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:47.520
That's right.

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.520
There you go.

01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:52.000
By the way, just to answer some questions from chat, some folks were saying, wasn't

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.360
that already the game of the week before?

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:54.360
No.

01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:58.400
No, we did check versus the wiki, Parasol Stars, which was kind of a different like

01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:00.520
bubble bobble sequel the other way.

01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:02.360
It was one of the official sequels to the game.

01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:06.840
Right, it was in the past and I'm pretty sure I would have brought up Rainbow Islands because

01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:11.840
I did genuinely like the game a lot, but I believe, at least according to our wiki, this

01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:13.920
is the first time that it has officially been the game of the week.

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:17.960
I did Parasol Stars like, what, last year, the year before, or something like that?

01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:18.960
It was a while ago.

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:23.080
Well, you gotta remember, we've been doing classic game of the week since episode 250,

01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:24.080
I believe.

01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:25.080
Yeah.

01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:26.080
We're almost to 450.

01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:28.340
I've named over 200 games.

01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:30.880
Probably when you count the marathon show and some of the shows where you weren't here

01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:33.400
and all that, it's probably up to about 200 games.

01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:34.400
Yeah, so.

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:35.400
There's still more to go.

01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:36.400
I check.

01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:40.680
I fact check because, dammit, I don't misspell shit like Capcom does.

01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:42.120
I mean, I love you, Capcom, hire me.

01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:44.000
But you did duplicate a game once, but just once.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Why did I duplicate?

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Eh, one of the Final Fantasy games.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000
It was in there twice.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.480
No, I think that I did a different version of it.

01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:49.480
Eh.

01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:50.480
Whatever.

01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:52.040
I think it was one of those things where when it happened, we were just like, yeah, you

01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:53.040
know what?

01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:54.040
Deal with it.

01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:55.040
Yeah.

01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:56.040
It's been 200 shows.

01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:57.040
If that was my only thing, then.

01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:58.040
This game was doubly classic.

01:33:58.040 --> 01:33:59.040
Screw it.

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:02.020
I'm, what I will, you know, it's going to get to a point where you're like, shit, I've

01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:03.020
done like everything.

01:34:03.020 --> 01:34:04.020
I'm going to be like.

01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:06.520
It's going to be a PCP version as well.

01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:07.520
I think that's what he heard.

01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:10.760
Uh, I'm going to get out my Commodore 64 five and a quarter floppies and be all like, just

01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:13.360
pick one out of the box.

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:15.600
My dad still has those in the garage.

01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:16.600
You think those disks work?

01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:19.400
Or do you think they've probably melted by now?

01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:20.400
Let's fire up.

01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:21.400
Geos.

01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:22.400
All right.

01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:24.680
Anyhow, uh, we're gonna take a break guys, but there's still plenty more show to come.

01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:25.840
Rapid fire news coming up.

01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:30.800
Of course, your emails at mailbag at orangeonshooter.com, uh, the FUs of the week, Twitter topics, and

01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:40.800
so much more when we come back with more of orange lounge radio.

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:44.000
Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:51.520
We are live with the 446 episode, 446th episode of our show on this February, the 19th of

01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:55.080
2012 live tonight live only tonight.

01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:58.680
We're saying goodbye sadly to the OLR after birth at the very end of the show.

01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:01.560
You know, we used to be live for about 20 minutes after we taped the show.

01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:04.720
And the reason why we couldn't podcast is because a big central part of that was the

01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:07.080
cage match where we played copyrighted music.

01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:10.960
Uh, we've made a very difficult creative decision to end that segment tonight.

01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:16.180
Um, in the good news is that it'll free up the resources to do other things, but I want

01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:17.180
to warn everybody.

01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:18.520
Don't expect that to come right away.

01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:21.640
Uh, there's still some things that have to happen behind the scenes, but we are going

01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:23.920
to use the time to work on other projects.

01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:27.440
Um, so we still appreciate, of course, the live listeners coming out every week, but

01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:31.080
we hope you'll understand and respect our decision to, um, you know, kind of say, you

01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:33.840
know what, this, the segments losing steam for us.

01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:38.480
We need to, we need to kind of put it out to pasture and reinvent with something new.

01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:39.880
So that'll be ending live tonight.

01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:41.760
Podcasters, not a damn thing changes for you.

01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:45.840
If you've never listened to OLR live before, you're not going to notice a lick of difference

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:46.840
right now.

01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:48.840
No, nothing will change.

01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:49.840
Nothing will change.

01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:50.840
The show is still fine.

01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:51.840
All right.

01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:53.680
Um, still holding it together with chicken wire duct tape.

01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:56.240
There might be more in the future for you.

01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:57.240
Who knows?

01:35:57.240 --> 01:35:58.240
All right.

01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:02.320
Uh, anyhow, before I give too much away, uh, let's talk, Oh, speaking of spoilers, I wanted

01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:06.120
to bring this up at some point because, um, last week on the show, we had a very, uh,

01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:10.520
unexpected surprise during the phone call segment and we made a new friend here at orange

01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:16.320
launch radio and it was Asuka, Asuka, I always, I always want to say Asuka, but it's Asuka.

01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:24.720
Keep in mind any, and for most words in Japanese, the U or Su or Ru, the U is really cut short.

01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:29.760
Well now I've had my lesson, but, um, Asuka was on the show last week and she is from

01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:36.120
the tester, which is, uh, the Sony, um, download show that you can get reality show that you

01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:37.400
can only download.

01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:41.080
And she was on the show last week and she was very candid about the whole thing and

01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:42.080
it was great.

01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:45.320
I really love talking to her and you know, I feel like we made a new friend and a new

01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:50.520
member of the OL army who was very real with us about what was going on on the show.

01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:56.040
And a spoiler alert, she got kicked off this week, which was the second week of the show,

01:36:56.040 --> 01:37:00.000
which in some ways, you know, from an OLR perspective is, is funny.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.660
I mean, I'm not, obviously I am not happy she got kicked off.

01:37:03.660 --> 01:37:04.660
I think it's sad.

01:37:04.660 --> 01:37:05.840
I wish, I really do wish she would have won.

01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:09.860
She was a great gal, but in the respect of she was on the show, not even three days before

01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:15.480
she got kicked off on the, the one props to her for keeping that secret.

01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:18.660
Cause if I was, if that was me, that would have been a really hard thing to keep under

01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:24.780
my hat is like, no guys, really next week's episode is going to make you so mad.

01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:30.020
But the only bummer about that episode is, um, it was, it was kind of one of those things

01:37:30.020 --> 01:37:32.760
where it was like, they definitely did Loki.

01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:33.760
You saw it, right?

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:35.400
You finally watched it or whatever.

01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:42.280
They definitely went for, it was an episode where you were reminded that it's a TV show

01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:47.520
and not really a job interview because the decision that they made, you know, Oscar got

01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:53.060
kicked off in favor of somebody who, you know, was quote unquote more entertaining television.

01:37:53.060 --> 01:37:57.420
And Oscar knows that's not a dig on her, but this person that they kept was causing drama

01:37:57.420 --> 01:37:59.960
and dramas ratings and so forth.

01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:04.180
And Oscar, you know, was, was generally trying to get the job done and so forth.

01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:07.440
But unfortunately the way that whole challenge was set up, it was going to be her, the other

01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:09.640
gal and the other gal was starting fights.

01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:15.700
So she was, excuse me, she had personality or whatever Jaffe said about her.

01:38:15.700 --> 01:38:20.520
So bummer about Oscar, very sad to hear about that.

01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:24.040
And um, you know, I get the sense she's kind of bummed out about the edit she got on the

01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:25.920
show just in reading her Twitter and stuff.

01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:30.600
But I just want to say, you know what I know, I think what bugs her is that they used a

01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:32.840
clip of her at the very beginning of the show.

01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:33.840
I'm just guessing.

01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:37.420
I don't know, but I'm going to guess if I were her, they used a clip of her at the very

01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:40.980
beginning of the show where she's dogging on Egoraptor a little bit because Egoraptor

01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:45.240
got to stay around and this show kind of starts off with her like that's bull that he got

01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:47.560
to stick around and you know, so forth.

01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:51.540
Well guys, you know, remember this and the problem is Egoraptor has a very rabid fan

01:38:51.540 --> 01:38:56.080
base on the internet and I'm sure she's getting, you know, nasty tweets and so forth because

01:38:56.080 --> 01:39:00.760
of that, which is stupid because people should differentiate, you know, television from the

01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:04.480
real person we had on the show last week who was a lot of fun.

01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:08.900
I'm sure every person in the house said it was bullshit that he got to stick around because

01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:11.660
of course that's one person between you and the prize.

01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:16.280
They chose to show her probably because they wanted to show her to remind people who she

01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:19.240
was because it was going to be her week to get kicked off the show.

01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:22.640
You know, so it was all editing garbage and all this stuff.

01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:26.180
So you know, it's unfortunate, but I didn't think she looked like a bitch.

01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:31.240
I think she looked like somebody who was fighting to be there, you know, and that's, that was,

01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:32.600
that was what it was all about.

01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:33.840
So best of luck.

01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:37.220
And if I know she's not in chat tonight, but I think there was a con or something this

01:39:37.220 --> 01:39:40.820
weekend if we can get her back on the show to really now get the skinny on what went

01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:44.800
down, she definitely has an open invite to come back any time.

01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:50.600
Meanwhile, let's move on and talk about other video game news and we'll go with the rapid

01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:51.600
fire news.

01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:52.600
Loki.

01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:53.600
All right.

01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:57.120
So let's talk a little bit about, this is kind of cool.

01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:02.720
It's a Vita game I'm definitely looking forward to and that would be Resistance Burning Skies.

01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:09.560
It has been announced that it is coming out May 29th on the Vita and you know, kind of

01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:16.320
been a side story to the whole Resistance series and looks pretty awesome.

01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:19.400
So I'm definitely checking that out.

01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:24.480
Also, it wasn't part of this, but I believe Gravity Rush is also supposed to be coming

01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:32.780
out that same day as well, which is another really awesome looking Vita game, which unfortunately

01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:37.080
due to the fact that you can only have one profile on your Vita system, I am not able

01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:43.080
to download to my Vita, which is annoying, but yeah.

01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:44.080
So there's that.

01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:50.760
And then on top of that, there's also this new arcade game that's coming to Xbox Live

01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:51.760
Arcade.

01:40:51.760 --> 01:41:00.040
It's called Jam Live Music Arcade and what it is, is it's kind of like a music creation

01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:02.960
remix program.

01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:10.840
You can use your instruments, your Guitar Hero instruments, Rock Band instruments, whatever,

01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:12.880
with this and you can actually remix some different songs.

01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:17.800
It includes 30 licensed songs including, I guess, stuff from Modest Mouse, Fall Out Boy,

01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:25.080
Fat Boy Slim, Rise Against, Atmosphere, and some other artists.

01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:28.960
And we'll be coming out, I guess, on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network later

01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:30.320
this year.

01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:34.880
So that's kind of cool, at least something to maybe dust those instruments off for.

01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:41.520
And then finally, the next piece of download content has been announced for, well the date

01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:46.720
has for the, since we're the third game, Gangstas in Space.

01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:54.560
It continues on kind of one of the endings of the game where you are filming a movie

01:41:54.560 --> 01:42:00.760
and it's really cheesy, kind of like a parody of old Star Trek episodes or whatever.

01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:02.920
It's just really, really ridiculous.

01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:04.880
But there's gonna be that.

01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:09.040
It's coming out for $6.99 on the 21st.

01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:13.640
I will probably download it because I like Saints Row, so I don't know why I just didn't

01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:15.040
get a season pass.

01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:20.040
I gotta say this though, it better be longer than the last DLC because the last DLC I finished

01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:22.060
in an hour and that's bullshit.

01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:23.160
How much was it?

01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:24.160
Seven dollars.

01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:27.720
That is absolute bullshit.

01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:31.960
And I gotta tell you this much, they aren't already starting off on a good note because

01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:36.600
I thought the whole Gangstas in Space mission at the end won the alternate enemies.

01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:39.920
It was kind of stupid, but whatever.

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:43.640
That's too bad because the first hour of that game I've never laughed so hard in my life.

01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:44.640
That game is awesome.

01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:47.400
No, don't get me wrong, that game is awesome.

01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:53.080
It's just how they're treating the whole download content thing is just really annoying.

01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:59.920
And trust me, if all three of these pieces of download content are terrible like this,

01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:03.760
I'm just not gonna buy any download content for you guys anymore.

01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:09.640
There's still ways I can play this shit without having to buy it, so I have that option, but

01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:10.640
I'm not taking it.

01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:12.640
I actually am purchasing download content.

01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:13.640
Alright.

01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:17.520
Speaking of DLC, I just want to insert something here because I noticed it's not in the show

01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:20.120
roll but it's something I read because it sounds interesting to me.

01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:22.520
Final Fantasy XIII-2 is getting a lot of DLC.

01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:25.120
This is a very interesting path that Square is going down.

01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:29.320
I wonder what this is going to do for future Final Fantasy games, but I guess they announced

01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:30.320
one this week.

01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:36.920
Not only are they doing another costume, and this one is Sarah with booby-age, but there's

01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:42.560
going to be a side story mission now that will bring back Saws, who is an awesome character

01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:44.040
in Final Fantasy XIII.

01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:46.200
He was the dude with the chocobo and his afro.

01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:50.520
I guess he's going to have a side mission or a side story thing, and if you beat it,

01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:55.000
you get to use him as one of the quote-unquote monster companions in the main game.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:59.160
So that could be interesting, but like Loki, I hope it doesn't disappoint in length.

01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:03.080
I hope it's something that you can, you know, is rewarding.

01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:07.200
I hope it has the same good storytelling as the rest of the Final Fantasy game does.

01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:09.240
Meanwhile, other rapid-fire news.

01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:13.800
Pandora's Tower is going to be coming out in Europe in April.

01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:18.160
Now this is notable because Pandora's Tower is one of those Operation Rainfall games,

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:21.680
you know, one of the games that was big in Japan, and people were like, why aren't these

01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:23.400
games coming out on the Wii over here?

01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:27.580
Well, it's coming out in Europe in April, which means English translation.

01:44:27.580 --> 01:44:30.080
Could it come out in America after that?

01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:31.840
Maybe by 2013 at this rate.

01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:32.840
We'll see.

01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:35.200
Meanwhile, the rest of us will probably have pirated it by then.

01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:40.200
Not that I endorse piracy, but I'm getting pretty damn sick of why is the game in English

01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:43.960
and takes nine months to come over here, and then it's exclusive to only one store.

01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:51.600
Excuse me, April 13th is the day that Pandora's Tower is coming out in Europe.

01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:52.960
Pretty awesome there.

01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:57.320
I guess the announcement came out with some Valentine's cards that they did online, which

01:44:57.320 --> 01:45:00.360
was a very strange tie-in, but whatever.

01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:05.800
Metal Gear Solid, a little bit of Metal Gear Solid news this week, the Metal Gear 3D demo,

01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:06.800
by the way, is out.

01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:09.760
I haven't checked it out myself, but for those of you that are 3DS-ing, you might want to

01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:10.760
check out that demo.

01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:16.640
Otherwise, Metal Gear Solid 4 is going to be ending its online portion this summer.

01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:20.040
You might have already forgot that there was a whole Metal Gear portion online, but it

01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:22.240
was Metal Gear Online.

01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:26.120
It is going offline this summer, and it's probably because, well, nobody's really playing

01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:27.120
it anymore.

01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:34.360
I guess, oh, no, the shop for Metal Gear Online is closing March 21st, and then in April,

01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:39.880
you cannot make new characters, and on June 21st, it is all going down.

01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:45.480
Unfortunately, this is what happens to games that their servers aren't really used anymore

01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:49.400
is that they take the servers down and use them for other games.

01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:54.160
One other game announcement of sorts, or I guess it's more like a leaked, Korea's Game

01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:58.680
Ratings Board has leaked news about Dragon Ball Z Connect.

01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:03.560
Bondi Namco, who's made all the other Dragon Ball Z games, is making this one as well.

01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:05.880
Who knows what the hell this game will involve.

01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:08.080
Let's hope it will involve dancing.

01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:12.600
Not bad for a show that's been off the air in Japan since 1990-something.

01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:13.600
Right.

01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:17.720
But, hey, how many times have they rebooted Ninja Turtles, so...

01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:20.440
Except they haven't rebooted Dragon Ball Z.

01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:24.360
GT came out, and that came out while I still lived in Alabama.

01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:26.300
So there you go.

01:46:26.300 --> 01:46:28.680
That's my rapid-fire news, Dark Sakura.

01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:30.520
How about a Capcom-related one?

01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:34.200
There is a new Dark Stalkers trademark in Europe.

01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:35.400
Ooh.

01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:37.620
So maybe there's a surprise game coming out?

01:46:37.620 --> 01:46:40.440
Maybe they're doing something in the vein of Street Fighter III?

01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:41.440
Who knows?

01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:44.540
But that would be really sweet.

01:46:44.540 --> 01:46:52.140
And we actually have been getting those constant reminders from Ono to have a push on Capcom

01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:53.600
for more Dark Stalkers.

01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:55.640
He said this is all up to the readers.

01:46:55.640 --> 01:46:56.640
They have to create the buzz.

01:46:56.640 --> 01:46:57.640
They have to tell us.

01:46:57.640 --> 01:46:59.620
They have to write the condition.

01:46:59.620 --> 01:47:02.380
They have to send the letters out of plead.

01:47:02.380 --> 01:47:05.480
I guess that was translated badly.

01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:08.880
Next up, Hulu Plus is now on Wii!

01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:13.880
And it is a $7.99 a month subscription.

01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:16.440
And there will be a 3DS version out later.

01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:18.920
But no one cares.

01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:24.120
And in Rock Band News, we do have some Megadeth.

01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:32.600
The Megadeth pack has Symphony of Destruction and A Total Le Monde and Public Enemy number

01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:33.600
1.

01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:40.400
Symphony of Destruction has Pro Guitar and Pro Bass available for an extra buck.

01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:43.200
But there are...

01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:46.240
You can get the full albums of Peace Sells, but Who's Buying and Rest in Peace.

01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:49.320
Because, you know, for me, it's all about playing Sweating Bullets.

01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:50.320
Done.

01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:51.320
Alright.

01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:52.320
Megadeth.

01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:55.800
You know, I'm gonna say this.

01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:58.840
Megadeth is not great, but they had some great songs.

01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:04.720
I mean, freaking Dave Mustaine got kicked out of Metallica for a reason.

01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:06.040
But I don't know.

01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:08.680
I think Sweating Bullets is probably their best song.

01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:11.320
I gotta go back to the Darkstalkers news a little bit here.

01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:13.720
Obviously, that was some big news.

01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:17.800
Dungeon Buster in our chatroom at chat.orangelandrater.com says, I'd love another Darkstalkers.

01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:19.640
Dude, I don't think you're alone.

01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:22.440
I would really get a kick out of that.

01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:24.800
And it would make sense for Capcom to go back to that.

01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:26.800
You know, they've had Street Fighter IV.

01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:28.680
They're gonna have this whole Street Fighter X Tekken.

01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:34.320
I wouldn't be surprised at all if Darkstalkers kind of gets that treatment for 2013.

01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:36.240
It's all about three.

01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:38.000
One move and two characters.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.040
Now, reverse that.

01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:43.400
Two moves and one character.

01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:46.280
The Succubus attack.

01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:47.280
What was it called?

01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:49.720
The pleasure something?

01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:54.000
Dimitri's Midnight Bliss, where he turns the character into a female version.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.240
Sexy female and then sucks him dry.

01:48:56.240 --> 01:48:57.240
And then...

01:48:57.240 --> 01:48:58.320
Nasty.

01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:04.760
And then Jetta, who is just disgusting with the fetus, the God fetus stage.

01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:08.600
All right, we're gonna get back into some more news here in the mailbag in just a moment,

01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:10.560
but I do want to make sure I put out a call.

01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:15.040
The last call for tweets for tonight, twitter.com slash O-L-R. If you have any statements you

01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:18.880
want to make on what we've talked about tonight, or if you have any questions for us, we'll

01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:23.600
take those via Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to add us and tweet at us

01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:24.600
at O-L-R.

01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:28.800
Uh, Loki, you got quite a little bit of news about one franchise, don't you?

01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:33.280
Yeah, Assassin's Creed Revelations done pretty well, so of course it makes sense that they're

01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:35.120
gonna do another Assassin's Creed game.

01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:37.280
There's something called Assassin's Creed 3.

01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:42.240
Yes, that's confusing because it's not the third Assassin's Creed game, but whatever.

01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:48.320
It's coming out October 30th in North America, so it's, yeah, not too far away.

01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:52.680
Definitely in time for the fourth quarter rush.

01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:57.480
And for good reason, of course, Assassin's Creed Revelations shipped nearly 7 million

01:49:57.480 --> 01:50:05.100
units worldwide, and to make a comparison with another popular franchise, Just Dance

01:50:05.100 --> 01:50:09.020
shipped 13 million units worldwide.

01:50:09.020 --> 01:50:14.460
That's in the last year, but if you remember, though, Revelations, though, that came out

01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:20.720
back in November, so it's had a lot less time to do that, so it's pretty cool.

01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:25.600
Of course, also, there's gonna be some download content coming to Revelations as well.

01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:29.640
The new download content's called Assassin's Creed Revelations Lost Archives.

01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:37.000
It's gonna be $15, and some of the achievements have already leaked out about it, and it's

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:47.040
supposed to be a single-player campaign as well, including 10 new achievements, so neat.

01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:52.720
Lots and lots of Assassin's Creed news, but I guess when your franchise is popular...

01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:55.600
The whole Assassin's Creed 3 thing doesn't bother me too much, though.

01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:59.000
Think about how many Mario games there have been that have had all these different numbers,

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.640
like you had Mario World, then you had a bunch of other Mario games, then they went back

01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:03.160
and did Mario World 2.

01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:08.840
So Mario 64 wasn't really the 64th game in the series, although it may have felt like

01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:10.840
his 64th appearance.

01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:15.640
Alright, well, I find this next story kind of interesting.

01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:18.680
It wasn't really like one of the big news stories this week, but I found this whole

01:51:18.680 --> 01:51:22.160
discussion interesting, and kind of the questions this poses.

01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:25.760
And I'm gonna mention this story that's on Destructoid.

01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:33.240
And Destructoid ran an article about this site called Classic FM and the Hall of Fame.

01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:38.920
Classic FM is a radio station in the UK, and they're trying to do a Hall of Fame contest

01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:44.480
that has what they consider the most inspirational and worthwhile compositions of the year.

01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:46.320
The public votes on this.

01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:53.120
So there's a campaign to try to get Final Fantasy, Aris, Arith, I always want to say

01:51:53.120 --> 01:51:59.840
Aris, because I grew up that way, but Arith theme for Final Fantasy VII as a song that's

01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:00.840
recognized.

01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:06.100
Which, you know, love or hate Final Fantasy VII, you gotta say that's a damn fine composition

01:52:06.100 --> 01:52:10.940
and fits in well with the classical theme.

01:52:10.940 --> 01:52:15.880
It's interesting to me kind of how much we've seen the video games kind of dip into classic

01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:19.240
music just within the past, I don't know, I wanna say like five, six years, whenever

01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:21.080
they started Dear Friends.

01:52:21.080 --> 01:52:26.440
Because Dear Friends, there's, you know, of course video games live, which was, I wouldn't

01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:31.000
really say as a night at the opera, but it definitely brings classical music and rock

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.400
music together, you know, in a way.

01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:36.080
But of course Play, the video game orchestra.

01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:38.560
You know, there have been several of these, and of course there was More Friends, which

01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:39.800
really was not good.

01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:43.840
I was there, you guys, it was a mess.

01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:48.720
But for the most part, now we have what, the Zelda tours happening right now, and all this

01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:49.720
other stuff.

01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:56.720
So there's definitely been a push to get people into classic music through, I guess, music

01:52:56.720 --> 01:52:59.080
and games, which makes sense to me.

01:52:59.080 --> 01:53:04.940
I mean, we really connect with a lot of these songs and games, especially a lot of the songs

01:53:04.940 --> 01:53:06.240
in Final Fantasy.

01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:10.440
Like Dark Sakura, I know you cheered when she died in Final Fantasy VII, but you've

01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:11.440
got to admit-

01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:12.440
Oh yes I did!

01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:14.880
You've got to admit, the music was amazing.

01:53:14.880 --> 01:53:17.160
That actually wasn't my favorite music in the game, to be honest.

01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:18.160
Really?

01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:22.640
My favorite music in the game was the Jenova boss fight music right before that.

01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:25.040
But see, that's not something that's really classic, you know what I mean?

01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:26.360
No, but I'm serious.

01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:28.800
I thought the Erythos scene was actually kind of boring.

01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:29.800
Really?

01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:32.200
And it wasn't really musically exciting.

01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:38.400
I like really challenging and musically complex pieces.

01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:41.960
So that's why I really liked the Jenova theme.

01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:45.240
It was- what was that particular Jenova theme?

01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:48.280
Wait, okay, go ahead and play some of it.

01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:51.520
Well, I was going to play the Eryth theme because I see a comment in our chat room here

01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:52.520
at chat.orangelandtrady.com.

01:53:52.520 --> 01:53:56.720
Kaijuto says, I played Final Fantasy VII three times and I don't remember that theme.

01:53:56.720 --> 01:53:57.720
I'm like, what?

01:53:57.720 --> 01:54:01.720
All right, so here- yeah, I know.

01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:06.400
But you know something- here we go.

01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:08.880
This is right when she gets killed.

01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:15.960
And this music is kind of used as an incidental throughout the whole game.

01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:16.960
But it's sad.

01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:23.240
It's pretty, but it's just- What it did at the time- this was so fucking

01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:25.040
revolutionary for video games.

01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:26.240
You know, it really was.

01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:31.000
I realize there's seven haters out there, but you've got to recognize there was nothing

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.160
like this in games until here.

01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:38.760
Yes, we had characters die in games before, but they didn't die on CD media in an epic

01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:39.760
RPG.

01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:41.600
Well, Celes did throw herself off a cliff.

01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:45.400
Right, but she blinked and disappeared, you know?

01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:49.760
This was like big, you know?

01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:53.040
Well, find the Jenova thing.

01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:55.080
What was the actual name of it?

01:54:55.080 --> 01:54:56.080
Do you remember?

01:54:56.080 --> 01:55:00.080
It was, uh, hold on.

01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:02.520
I think I can get it.

01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:03.760
Just the Jenova theme?

01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:09.680
No, it was, uh- no, this wasn't it.

01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:19.180
It was, uh- because that's- I think it was the Jenova absolute.

01:55:19.180 --> 01:55:20.180
That's the one I liked.

01:55:20.180 --> 01:55:24.600
Oh, I remember this, too.

01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:27.400
Because it was like the play on the fight theme.

01:55:27.400 --> 01:55:31.240
And you know what, you know, I shouldn't dog this compared to the other one.

01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:33.240
I mean, it definitely invokes a mood.

01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:37.560
You know, a lot of the boss music in these games is supposed to get you, like, you know,

01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:38.800
pumped up, like, you know.

01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:39.800
But see, that's my thing.

01:55:39.800 --> 01:55:44.080
When I look for musical pieces, I look for the complexity of the piece.

01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:50.080
I'm not saying I didn't like the Aerith music even as much as I hate the bitch herself.

01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:53.720
It's just I thought her theme was a little formulaic.

01:55:53.720 --> 01:55:54.720
I really did.

01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:56.660
It- yes, it needs to be recognized.

01:55:56.660 --> 01:55:59.800
I think this is a much more mature piece of music.

01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:00.800
Just saying.

01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:03.840
Well, what's interesting, you know, despite whatever game you're gonna pick from these

01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:08.180
games, you know, the fact that I don't think this station would otherwise get as many votes

01:56:08.180 --> 01:56:14.520
as they're gonna get now that there's actually a Facebook campaign trying to get Nobuo Imatsu's

01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:15.520
theme recognized.

01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:20.400
And you know what, no matter what song they pick, Nobuo Imatsu himself should be recognized

01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:23.640
because that man has contributed so much for video game music.

01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:26.840
Not just Final Fantasy, but some games that get grossly overlooked.

01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:27.840
I met him.

01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:30.720
I was- oh yeah, I sat two seats away from him.

01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:32.040
Do you remember that?

01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:33.040
When I went to Dear Friends?

01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:37.160
But I'll tell you, the other person that I met in music gaming who has been inspirational

01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:40.320
to me was Koji Kondo.

01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:45.240
But I think Nobuo Imatsu, like, I was just talking with Twitter, or talking on Twitter

01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:51.160
with somebody about this this week, Lost Odyssey is a grossly overlooked 360 title that also

01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:52.720
has an amazing soundtrack.

01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:54.240
But anyhow, I digress.

01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:59.060
I was trying to get into the whole topic of, does a video game theme deserve to be treated

01:56:59.060 --> 01:57:06.000
as a classical, you know, nod as a class- and I say yeah, why not?

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:10.720
My one thing about this is that now if that was a full- because keep in mind, the versions

01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:16.320
of the songs of Final Fantasy VII were rendered with the game engine.

01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:20.440
If they had taken actual- because I mean, they're synthesized.

01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:22.440
It's clearly synthesizer music.

01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:25.680
It's very complex synthesizer music, but that's what it is.

01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:30.080
If it had been, you know, classically recorded with a full orchestra and then presented,

01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:33.400
I think then maybe it could qualify.

01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:36.320
But then you'd be looking into, you know, electronic music.

01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:42.920
There's the Dear Friends version or there was an event in Japan that preceded Dear Friends

01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:44.040
and inspired it.

01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:47.200
Was it 2002?

01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:49.520
It had some type of numberation in it.

01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:52.440
There was some big concert they did in Japan for the Final Fantasy series.

01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:56.480
I want to say it was 2-2-2002 that kind of started the whole damn thing.

01:57:56.480 --> 01:57:58.360
There's a CD out for it and everything.

01:57:58.360 --> 01:57:59.360
Yeah.

01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:00.360
So, anyhow.

01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:01.360
All right.

01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:02.360
Well, anyhow.

01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:04.360
I mean, we could also look to the Black Mages CDs too.

01:58:04.360 --> 01:58:10.560
I don't think this video game music should dominate this whole thing, but I think a tip

01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:12.160
of the hat would be great.

01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:15.640
Ooh, good call from RDG Singe in the chat room.

01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:16.640
Actraiser Suite.

01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:17.640
True.

01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:20.320
Oh, man, that was some fucking good music.

01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:21.320
That was a...

01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:22.320
Who did that?

01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:23.320
That was...

01:58:23.320 --> 01:58:24.320
Oh, God.

01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:25.320
Why is his name escaping me just now?

01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:26.960
He was in all the...

01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:28.600
He did a DDR song that was big.

01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:30.080
He did all the Wangan music.

01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:31.080
Oh.

01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:32.960
Why is his name escaping me right now?

01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:34.720
He's like one of my favorites.

01:58:34.720 --> 01:58:36.040
I know who you're talking about.

01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:37.040
Oh, God.

01:58:37.040 --> 01:58:38.040
Alzheimer's setting in early.

01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:39.040
No, Rob.

01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:40.040
Yuzu Koshiro.

01:58:40.040 --> 01:58:41.040
Yeah.

01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:54.760
All right, let's move on.

01:58:54.760 --> 01:59:00.080
This is the part of the show where we're gonna go to the mailbag and read your emails.

01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:05.080
Every week, you guys email us at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and Dark Soccer dives

01:59:05.080 --> 01:59:07.040
into the email bag head first.

01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:08.200
It's a little sticky.

01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:09.720
And reads the emails.

01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:10.720
Sorry.

01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:13.400
Mailbag, orange laundry, I spilled cranberry juice on it.

01:59:13.400 --> 01:59:17.800
And this time, I won't bitch about your grammar.

01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:21.040
Hello, O-O-R. After last week's episode, I felt a little compelled to write an email

01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:22.040
to you guys again.

01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:25.960
I wanted to express how much I admire what you three are doing for such a long time.

01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:26.960
Volunteering isn't always easy.

01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:29.800
I'd like to tell my own story, if that's okay?

01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:30.800
I guess.

01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:32.200
You wrote a long enough email.

01:59:32.200 --> 01:59:34.640
Hey, every gamer gets a voice.

01:59:34.640 --> 01:59:35.640
In my voice.

01:59:35.640 --> 01:59:38.980
10 years ago, we started a team to rebuild the local playground.

01:59:38.980 --> 01:59:41.880
It really needed a lot of work to be safe and nice again.

01:59:41.880 --> 01:59:45.720
Of course, we have to raise money, and we organize a festival that lasts three days.

01:59:45.720 --> 01:59:50.000
More than 60 people helped us, from local youth to older people.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:53.560
People always have a great time during the festival, because just like you, we try to

01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:55.200
be very down to earth.

01:59:55.200 --> 01:59:59.040
We don't think that we organize the biggest party ever, because we simply don't.

01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:01.800
And most importantly, we don't act like it, too.

02:00:01.800 --> 02:00:04.320
We want our festival to be for everyone.

02:00:04.320 --> 02:00:05.520
But it is sometimes hard.

02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:09.400
Some people come and say, wow, that's good money for only three days of work, but we

02:00:09.400 --> 02:00:13.320
tell them how many hours, days, weeks, months to go into organizing the three days.

02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:15.160
They say we must be crazy.

02:00:15.160 --> 02:00:19.000
And yes, sometimes I don't feel like I'm doing anything, and sometimes it feels a little

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:20.000
tedious.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:21.000
But you pull through.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:24.160
When in summertime, you hear children play, laugh, scream, and cry in the playground.

02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:28.240
Their parents read a book, or their grandparents just sit and watch the grandchildren play.

02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:31.220
It makes it all more than worth it.

02:00:31.220 --> 02:00:34.960
It feels good to create a little space for people to be themselves and have a good time

02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:36.920
without having any troubles for a little while.

02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:38.960
Can I just say, I think that's a great thing.

02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:40.600
That's volunteer work, essentially.

02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:43.840
That's volunteering for your community and doing good.

02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:47.200
A lot of people do that stuff and don't get paid a single dime.

02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:49.840
So I don't think you're crazy for only getting three days pay or whatever it was.

02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:54.000
And I think that they're actually raising the money for charity for the sake of keeping

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:55.580
the playground upkeep.

02:00:55.580 --> 02:00:56.580
That's great.

02:00:56.580 --> 02:00:57.580
I think that's great.

02:00:57.580 --> 02:00:59.640
OLR does that for its listeners, too, I think.

02:00:59.640 --> 02:01:00.760
Well, at least for me.

02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:02.200
You guys are very down to earth, too.

02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:05.920
You don't go bragging about how fantastic you are or how you are just so outstanding

02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:06.920
at games.

02:01:06.920 --> 02:01:07.920
I am.

02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:08.920
No, I'm kidding.

02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:11.920
You're just normal, everyday people with the same problems as everyone else.

02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:15.480
And funny as hell, too, I do miss Rob Bloods.

02:01:15.480 --> 02:01:19.360
I don't.

02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:22.880
I'm sorry if this email is a little long, but it really comes from my heart.

02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:28.680
You are three hours of feel good and a very troublesome time for a lot of people.

02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:30.180
Thank you for doing this show for so long.

02:01:30.180 --> 02:01:33.560
I hope it can go on for some time because without it, I'd feel kind of lost.

02:01:33.560 --> 02:01:34.560
You guys are awesome.

02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:36.840
Yours truly, Fabrice from Belgium.

02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:40.960
Aww, big hugs all the way for Belgium.

02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:41.960
And Rob.

02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:43.960
What do you want, woman?

02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:44.960
A cookie.

02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:45.960
I hate you.

02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:46.960
No, you don't.

02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:47.960
You love me.

02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:53.680
You know what, though?

02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:59.560
I appreciate that because I actually claim I don't want to be the best at gaming and

02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:01.760
I don't want you to think I'm the best at gaming.

02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:07.040
I am just an average gamer, you know, because I think, you know, why would I be stupid enough

02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:08.040
to make that claim?

02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:09.800
I know I'm not the best.

02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:14.360
I fully admitted how much sucking I did on Bubble Bobble today, which is like the easiest

02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:15.720
freaking game ever.

02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:20.240
But I do have the number four score in Master Mode on Born This Way and Rhythm Party, so

02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:21.560
I will kick your ass at Rhythm Party.

02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:23.920
I am really good at Puzzle Bobble.

02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:24.920
Just saying.

02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:25.920
Just saying.

02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:26.920
We all have our things.

02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:27.920
Yeah.

02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:28.920
No, we really appreciate it.

02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:32.120
I mean, this whole show is kind of a way for us to get together on Sunday nights and just

02:02:32.120 --> 02:02:33.120
do this.

02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:36.280
And it really, you know, in some ways it's become a habit.

02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:40.600
I think we do this show out of habit at this point, but I don't know where I'm going with

02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:41.600
this.

02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:43.640
When I have a week off, it feels really nice.

02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:44.920
I'm not going to lie.

02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:46.760
Like a week off here and there has been great.

02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:51.520
But like if I had every week off, I think I'd be going like, I'm really bored.

02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:52.520
Yeah.

02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:58.480
I really don't know what to do with my Sundays, you know, without, honestly, without the show.

02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:02.840
Um, you know, I actually feel, I hate to draw the comparison, I feel the same way about

02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:09.280
Babysitting Julian too, because I love that kid and I love doing the show and I guess

02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:10.280
I like you guys.

02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:13.840
I usually, I come here for Alan really.

02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:14.840
Alan and the cats.

02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:17.560
Alan's only been in the picture for a couple of years though.

02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:21.120
He's only been living here for about, you know, 10 months.

02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:27.640
But um, no, I, you know, I, there, there would definitely be a void in my life.

02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:28.640
I, you know, it's funny.

02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:32.960
I was just talking today about the Oscars, you know, the Oscars are on next week.

02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:33.960
Oscar shmaskers.

02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:38.840
I used to be so into like, like a lot of gay man, this is very stereotypical, but we all

02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:39.840
have our things.

02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:44.680
I used to be really into the Oscars like, you know, 10 years ago and I was just commenting

02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:47.440
like, I haven't seen the Oscars in 10 years.

02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:49.080
Like who, who hosted last year?

02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:52.840
I forgot, you know, cause I'm like, I do a show Sundays.

02:03:52.840 --> 02:03:53.840
That's my thing.

02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:59.180
I don't watch award shows anymore, even though like 10 years ago my friends would throw dinner

02:03:59.180 --> 02:04:02.400
parties where all the dishes were themed after the best picture nominees.

02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:03.400
Like how gay is that?

02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:04.400
Right.

02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:05.840
But, but it really happened.

02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:09.600
You know, it's, this has just become a part of my life.

02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:10.600
We've had scares.

02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:14.840
Yeah, we've had scares, but, but you know, I'm going to have to say this is that even

02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:19.760
if the situation has made me move, I would still try to find some way to make it work.

02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:22.320
I would try everything until there was no other option.

02:04:22.320 --> 02:04:27.380
I think even if OLR were to, I mean, there is going to come a day where OLR ends, everything

02:04:27.380 --> 02:04:28.380
comes to an end.

02:04:28.380 --> 02:04:29.380
Next week.

02:04:29.380 --> 02:04:30.380
But no, not next week.

02:04:30.380 --> 02:04:31.380
Stop it.

02:04:31.380 --> 02:04:35.360
But you know, something will happen or whatever and you know, for whatever reason we'll choose

02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:36.360
to end it.

02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:40.160
And, but I just don't see me not podcasting.

02:04:40.160 --> 02:04:41.160
I'd probably still do something.

02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:43.520
I just have too big of a mouth.

02:04:43.520 --> 02:04:51.540
Well, and we've actually, however we're going to make it work, still have a project in mind

02:04:51.540 --> 02:04:56.360
that kind of got put on the back burner because of stuff and things, but we have stuff planned.

02:04:56.360 --> 02:04:57.360
Curse that stuff and things.

02:04:57.360 --> 02:04:58.360
I know.

02:04:58.360 --> 02:04:59.360
All right, let's move on with emails.

02:04:59.360 --> 02:05:00.360
Okay.

02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:01.360
We're getting too sappy.

02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:04.800
This one comes from Haseo Sumi Ragawa and I'm not going to vag you on your grammar this

02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:05.800
time.

02:05:05.800 --> 02:05:07.960
Like I said, I'm being a good girl.

02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:10.200
She wants to get hired this week.

02:05:10.200 --> 02:05:12.980
Capcom.

02:05:12.980 --> 02:05:13.980
You know what?

02:05:13.980 --> 02:05:15.080
I have to get a job this year.

02:05:15.080 --> 02:05:16.080
I have to.

02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:17.100
I know.

02:05:17.100 --> 02:05:20.580
So all of you out there listening, you want to hire me.

02:05:20.580 --> 02:05:22.860
I'm really amazing.

02:05:22.860 --> 02:05:25.240
She doesn't like selling French fries, you guys.

02:05:25.240 --> 02:05:27.080
I'm not going to work fast food.

02:05:27.080 --> 02:05:28.920
I know you're not.

02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:29.920
Dear OLR.

02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:30.920
Okay.

02:05:30.920 --> 02:05:33.720
Recently I purchased a copy of the older schools for oblivion game of the year edition.

02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:36.420
Now I'm enjoying it for the most part with the exception of one thing.

02:05:36.420 --> 02:05:40.740
The game of the year edition has a glitch in which when you are, oh shoot, he's sent

02:05:40.740 --> 02:05:42.800
this before.

02:05:42.800 --> 02:05:44.040
I've read this email before.

02:05:44.040 --> 02:05:45.040
You have?

02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:46.040
Yes, I have.

02:05:46.040 --> 02:05:47.280
Did you send it again?

02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:48.680
Thanks for reading my email.

02:05:48.680 --> 02:05:52.600
Yeah, it's the same email.

02:05:52.600 --> 02:05:55.280
I can pretend like we didn't hear it last week.

02:05:55.280 --> 02:05:56.280
So did he accidentally send it?

02:05:56.280 --> 02:05:57.280
Short, short version.

02:05:57.280 --> 02:05:58.280
Okay.

02:05:58.280 --> 02:06:02.980
Got turned into a vampire in elder schools for can't get turned back cause he gets burnt.

02:06:02.980 --> 02:06:05.400
I didn't even know you could be a vampire and I'll just rolls for, and I think I said

02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:06.400
the same thing.

02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:12.080
And when this email was read, you meet a witch, she sends you out for stuff, but the ingredients

02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:13.220
would not be accepted.

02:06:13.220 --> 02:06:15.440
Now there's a patch.

02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:17.400
Well, elder scrolls games broken.

02:06:17.400 --> 02:06:18.720
Go figure.

02:06:18.720 --> 02:06:19.720
Okay.

02:06:19.720 --> 02:06:20.720
Last email.

02:06:20.720 --> 02:06:21.720
Hey guys.

02:06:21.720 --> 02:06:22.720
Sterlak here.

02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:23.720
Hi Sterlak.

02:06:23.720 --> 02:06:26.200
I'm sad to see the cage match ending after so long.

02:06:26.200 --> 02:06:27.800
I've been listening since 2007.

02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:31.200
I've discovered some great music, thanks to the cage match, particularly the birthday

02:06:31.200 --> 02:06:33.480
massacre pendulum and goldfrap.

02:06:33.480 --> 02:06:37.400
That's all three of us are big picks that we've done.

02:06:37.400 --> 02:06:42.520
That is interesting because birthday massacre was my thing.

02:06:42.520 --> 02:06:45.400
Pendulum is a Loki's thing and goldfrap was definitely from you.

02:06:45.400 --> 02:06:46.400
That is true.

02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:47.400
That is true though.

02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:51.400
I'll definitely miss it as it was a big part of my week and something I always looked forward

02:06:51.400 --> 02:06:52.400
to.

02:06:52.400 --> 02:06:57.000
Well, maybe, maybe I'll suggest a song for you every week.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:58.000
There'll be something.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:59.000
Yeah.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:00.000
Jamie will start a music advice blog.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:05.160
You know, actually though, I did like the suggestion of post-show turntable.

02:07:05.160 --> 02:07:06.160
Yes.

02:07:06.160 --> 02:07:11.280
I love the idea of a post-show turntable FM because I think turntable FM is a great site.

02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:14.780
It's which I've been grossly neglecting lately.

02:07:14.780 --> 02:07:20.040
We used to just, what, run heroics, we used to run heroics and listen to, you know, all

02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:22.160
of our weird stuff.

02:07:22.160 --> 02:07:26.660
And so, yeah, you know, you actually got me back into a few bands that I used to listen

02:07:26.660 --> 02:07:33.360
to before, like, um, Lea Andreone and, uh, um, D-Lite.

02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:35.480
I met her once.

02:07:35.480 --> 02:07:36.480
Nobody knows who she is.

02:07:36.480 --> 02:07:37.480
I'm sure.

02:07:37.480 --> 02:07:38.480
All right.

02:07:38.480 --> 02:07:39.480
Okay.

02:07:39.480 --> 02:07:40.480
So the rest of the email.

02:07:40.480 --> 02:07:41.480
Yes.

02:07:41.480 --> 02:07:44.520
Um, that being said, however, I do respect your guy's decision to end the segment.

02:07:44.520 --> 02:07:45.760
It's not fun for you anymore.

02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:49.120
It's a little silly to continue and you should devote your energy to something fresh and

02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:50.120
new.

02:07:50.120 --> 02:07:53.860
I, like many diehard O'Larians, sort of see you guys as family.

02:07:53.860 --> 02:07:56.880
I eagerly look forward to seeing whatever you come up with next.

02:07:56.880 --> 02:07:59.880
Also, I have a podcast recommendation for Jamie.

02:07:59.880 --> 02:08:00.880
Ooh.

02:08:00.880 --> 02:08:01.880
Okay.

02:08:01.880 --> 02:08:04.400
You mentioned a week or two that you were into history.

02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:06.760
Have you ever heard of Dan Carlin's Hardcore History?

02:08:06.760 --> 02:08:07.960
Yes I have.

02:08:07.960 --> 02:08:11.960
It's a really great podcast and quite educational as Mr. Carlin researches all his subjects

02:08:11.960 --> 02:08:14.080
extensively and it really shows.

02:08:14.080 --> 02:08:16.760
I have listened to hardcore history, but I'm way out of it.

02:08:16.760 --> 02:08:18.400
I used to listen to it at my old job.

02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:21.800
Um, he has great radio personality and it's a blast to listen to.

02:08:21.800 --> 02:08:26.320
I really think you as a history enthusiast will, um, would really enjoy it.

02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:27.320
Anyway.

02:08:27.320 --> 02:08:28.320
Guess that's all for now.

02:08:28.320 --> 02:08:29.320
Keep up the awesome work guys.

02:08:29.320 --> 02:08:30.320
Thank you, Sterlok.

02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:32.100
You're such a sweetie.

02:08:32.100 --> 02:08:33.680
I have the perfect idea.

02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:39.560
Well, we're going to start a Tumblr that you, me and Loki all have access to and we will

02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:41.040
post songs we think are cool.

02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:42.040
Okay.

02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:43.040
That's it.

02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:46.880
If you have music recommendations, we'll have a place where you can go look.

02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:47.880
Okay.

02:08:47.880 --> 02:08:51.600
And the great thing, unlike cage match, you'll be able to press the stop button.

02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:52.600
You know what?

02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:53.600
You know what we should call it?

02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:54.600
Huh?

02:08:54.600 --> 02:08:55.600
We should call our new Tumblr.

02:08:55.600 --> 02:08:56.600
O-L-R cage match.

02:08:56.600 --> 02:08:57.600
Fuck yeah cage match.

02:08:57.600 --> 02:08:58.600
Yeah.

02:08:58.600 --> 02:08:59.600
Fuck yeah cage match.

02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:00.600
Everything on Tumblr.

02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:02.760
I swear to God, if one of you registers that now, I'm going to go do it right now.

02:09:02.760 --> 02:09:03.760
Hurry up.

02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:04.760
Rob.

02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:06.960
Well, okay.

02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:15.320
I am actually, you know, I was actually thinking that, uh, because I've been, I miss doing

02:09:15.320 --> 02:09:19.400
the comic book podcasts I used to except comics are kind of, they kind of blow now.

02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:25.880
Um, but I was thinking, you know, what we haven't seen, there's classic gaming podcasts,

02:09:25.880 --> 02:09:29.720
but there's no real history of gaming podcasts.

02:09:29.720 --> 02:09:30.720
You know what I mean?

02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:31.720
So, okay.

02:09:31.720 --> 02:09:40.680
I just want to throw the idea out there guys who would be interested in a history podcast

02:09:40.680 --> 02:09:42.960
like history of gaming.

02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:46.620
I would like to know who is interested in that and just email the mailbag.

02:09:46.620 --> 02:09:51.320
Also to the people who won master system games, I am sorry.

02:09:51.320 --> 02:09:53.220
I have had a midterm last week.

02:09:53.220 --> 02:09:54.760
I have been uber busy.

02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:55.980
I'm very sorry.

02:09:55.980 --> 02:09:57.520
Just send me an email.

02:09:57.520 --> 02:10:00.920
It's my personal email, which I have given you guys because only a few people out there

02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:07.680
have my real email and I will take care of it as soon as I get paid.

02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:08.680
Okay.

02:10:08.680 --> 02:10:09.680
I did it.

02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:10.680
Fuck.

02:10:10.680 --> 02:10:11.680
Yeah.

02:10:11.680 --> 02:10:12.680
Cage match dot tumblr.com.

02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:13.680
Okay.

02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:14.680
I got it.

02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:15.680
You know what song you should put up there first?

02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:16.680
It should be from both of us.

02:10:16.680 --> 02:10:17.680
No, I'm going to put the troll a little song up.

02:10:17.680 --> 02:10:18.680
Okay.

02:10:18.680 --> 02:10:19.680
Last week.

02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:20.680
Oh, why would I not?

02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:21.680
Ooh.

02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:22.680
10 hours of trouble.

02:10:22.680 --> 02:10:23.680
What?

02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:28.400
I want you to put Beth Dito up there.

02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:29.400
I will.

02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:30.760
I will start putting good songs on there later.

02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:36.060
You it's the same password as, as I shouldn't say that as something else.

02:10:36.060 --> 02:10:40.040
I'm not going to say the same one we use for everything else except for that stuff.

02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:41.040
Fucking safe.

02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:44.480
I was being silly as if for everything except for that other stuff.

02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:45.480
Yes, exactly.

02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:50.520
God, no one knows what her password is anyway, except for Ron.

02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:57.560
All right, Lord, anyhow, Rob, you make me ashamed.

02:10:57.560 --> 02:10:58.560
Why?

02:10:58.560 --> 02:10:59.560
I'm just kidding.

02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:00.560
That made me sad.

02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:01.560
Rob, you should get me some Pinkberry.

02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:02.560
No.

02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:06.240
See, that's the reason why we're actually quitting Afterbirth so we can go get Pinkberry

02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:07.920
after the show.

02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:10.040
We've decided that Pinkberry is more important.

02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:11.320
I'm kidding.

02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:20.400
Um, I actually hearing people being positive about the end of the, uh, the, uh, cage match.

02:11:20.400 --> 02:11:24.240
It's not really just the cage, but just the whole Afterbirth makes me happy, but you know

02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:26.160
what makes me pissed off?

02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:31.600
Rob, not starting the FUs of the Week music.

02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:33.520
I didn't know that we were done with the mailbag.

02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:34.520
Mailbag at...

02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:35.520
We are.

02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:36.520
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:11:36.520 --> 02:11:37.520
Girl.

02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:44.520
And now the FUs of the Week.

02:11:44.520 --> 02:11:56.520
Uh, I guess I really don't have an FU.

02:11:56.520 --> 02:11:57.520
No, I'm kidding.

02:11:57.520 --> 02:12:05.120
Um, FU to, uh, not having an iPad in my hand hurting, like, a bitch while I was trying

02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:10.640
to eat, uh, a Mongolian barbecue today and for Rob telling me that my dinner was stinky.

02:12:10.640 --> 02:12:13.880
It was a little stinky.

02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:22.000
It was just garlic and onions and lamb and moms and, um, an FU to me not having an awesome

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:23.000
job.

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.360
Capcom!

02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:27.140
I want to work for you.

02:12:27.140 --> 02:12:32.440
I would be a proud employee of Capcom, but then I couldn't talk about your games on OLR

02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:34.980
anymore.

02:12:34.980 --> 02:12:37.200
That would be a good reason to end OLR though, just saying.

02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:38.760
Jamie got a job at Capcom.

02:12:38.760 --> 02:12:39.760
We have to end the show.

02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:40.760
End DA's.

02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:41.760
Ending the show.

02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:42.760
Alright.

02:12:42.760 --> 02:12:43.880
I would just keep it up.

02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:46.120
I would just show up as your celebrity guest.

02:12:46.120 --> 02:12:47.120
It would be weird.

02:12:47.120 --> 02:12:48.120
No, it would be weird.

02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:49.120
We'd have to change the name.

02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:53.480
It would be Rob and Loki on games because it wouldn't be OLR anymore.

02:12:53.480 --> 02:12:58.760
Yeah, so really though, I mean, honestly, I am kind of in pissy mode about not having

02:12:58.760 --> 02:13:11.720
a job and also FU to, um, my, uh, girl bits for not growing a small person.

02:13:11.720 --> 02:13:14.280
I finally gave up and opened my bottle of chocolate wine.

02:13:14.280 --> 02:13:15.280
My mom was 37.

02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:18.280
I don't want to be 37.

02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:19.280
Well.

02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:20.280
Ever!

02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:21.280
No, I'm kidding.

02:13:21.280 --> 02:13:27.840
Um, yeah, uh, I gave up and I opened the bottle of wine I was saving for getting knocked up.

02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:28.840
So.

02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:29.840
Done.

02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:30.840
Then it'll happen.

02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:32.280
Don't get discouraged.

02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:34.480
You know what, I have a coworker going through a very similar thing.

02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:35.960
Oh, no, I'm done.

02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:36.960
I'm done.

02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:38.960
Loki, your FU's of the week.

02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:44.640
I have you the week of eBay for the way they handle their feedback on ship time because

02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:49.720
that should be something that shouldn't even be reliant upon the person that you ship something

02:13:49.720 --> 02:13:56.520
to because it's basically the time, you know, that your auction ends versus how much time

02:13:56.520 --> 02:14:00.220
you say you're going to ship it and when you actually ship your thing, not how long it

02:14:00.220 --> 02:14:04.600
takes in the mail, but people are educated enough to understand that.

02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:07.800
And so they're like, well, it took a long time to get to me because you shipped it during

02:14:07.800 --> 02:14:13.640
Christmas and all the, you know, the weather was bad and it took me weeks to get it something

02:14:13.640 --> 02:14:17.720
by the slowest ass mail service that I decided to pay for instead of upgrading it.

02:14:17.720 --> 02:14:19.320
So I'm going to rate you a one.

02:14:19.320 --> 02:14:21.440
Well, that sticks around for a whole year.

02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:28.080
And then PayPal holds your money because they're fucking PayPal and they can do that.

02:14:28.080 --> 02:14:34.260
So fuck you to eBay for even having that as an option of something to feed back on because

02:14:34.260 --> 02:14:37.960
really they have all that information, they're just being fucking lazy so they can hold your

02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:38.960
money.

02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:44.200
All right, my FU of the week, actually all things considered, I've had a, I've had a

02:14:44.200 --> 02:14:46.360
pretty good week, so I can't complain too much.

02:14:46.360 --> 02:14:52.340
So I regretfully have to give an FU of the week to Sanrio, who's one of our cats.

02:14:52.340 --> 02:14:55.360
She decided to claw me this morning when I picked her up because I actually, I banged

02:14:55.360 --> 02:14:59.360
my head on the door and it scared the shit out of her, so she clawed me and it hurt.

02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:01.820
So FU'd a cat for clawing me.

02:15:01.820 --> 02:15:03.680
So there you go.

02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:05.080
No KT's for you.

02:15:05.080 --> 02:15:08.840
KT is short for a word I can't say because the cat understands what it means and she

02:15:08.840 --> 02:15:09.840
will run in here.

02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:10.840
Yes.

02:15:10.840 --> 02:15:17.360
It rhymes with Bitty Meats KT, so they actually know what that means and they'll run out here

02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:18.360
screaming.

02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:19.840
You know, I actually never have to say the word around Shermie.

02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:20.840
Really?

02:15:20.840 --> 02:15:23.400
I just have to say, is it time?

02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:28.960
And she'll go, they know, they know Shermie loves her greenies.

02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:30.680
All right.

02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:31.680
There it is.

02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:32.680
Your FUs of the week.

02:15:32.680 --> 02:15:35.120
This segment will not be going anywhere anytime soon, just so you know.

02:15:35.120 --> 02:15:38.240
I realize it has nothing to do with games, but you know what?

02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:39.240
We don't care.

02:15:39.240 --> 02:15:40.240
Sometimes we're mad.

02:15:40.240 --> 02:15:41.240
Loki!

02:15:41.240 --> 02:15:42.240
You mad?

02:15:42.240 --> 02:15:43.240
More gaming news.

02:15:43.240 --> 02:15:44.240
You mad Rob?

02:15:44.240 --> 02:15:45.240
You mad?

02:15:45.240 --> 02:15:46.240
I'm mad.

02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:47.240
2.0.

02:15:47.240 --> 02:15:48.240
Heart.

02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:53.240
All right, so let's talk a little bit about indie games and you know, no one's gonna disagree

02:15:53.240 --> 02:15:57.800
at the fact that they're kind of hard to find sometimes.

02:15:57.800 --> 02:16:04.920
Microsoft seems to kind of bury them pretty well within their new dashboard revisions

02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:12.200
and the like, so of course it's up to the indies to take matters into their own hands

02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:18.620
and launch their own Xbox Live indie game app for Windows Phone 7.

02:16:18.620 --> 02:16:19.760
So they have done that.

02:16:19.760 --> 02:16:27.780
There's actually an app that ties with XboxIndies.com and it gathers different feed data based

02:16:27.780 --> 02:16:34.960
on that and you can actually search and link to the actual pages where you can buy them

02:16:34.960 --> 02:16:42.280
and send them to your Xbox using this app and some other features that they're adding

02:16:42.280 --> 02:16:49.480
that aren't really part of the indie games portion of the dashboard as it is are like

02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:55.520
some dev picks and recommendations based on that kind of stuff.

02:16:55.520 --> 02:17:01.400
So that's kind of cool and apparently this is going to be coming to other phone operating

02:17:01.400 --> 02:17:07.860
systems like Android and iOS later on, but right now it's just Windows Phone 7.

02:17:07.860 --> 02:17:12.840
But really it's kind of sad that they even have to do this because the fact that it's

02:17:12.840 --> 02:17:19.080
just so poorly laid out on the current dashboard, but you know, it is what it is.

02:17:19.080 --> 02:17:24.940
So at least now you can find that if you happen to have a Windows Phone 7, although I don't,

02:17:24.940 --> 02:17:29.380
so eh, oh well.

02:17:29.380 --> 02:17:35.200
I find that interesting though that the community is helping to fill in the gaps.

02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:41.680
It's just sad that they're treating it the way, I mean, it's so under promoted.

02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:47.560
I mean, so many games get added to that service and granted not a lot of them are great, but

02:17:47.560 --> 02:17:53.480
there are a lot of them that are really good and good luck finding them because I mean

02:17:53.480 --> 02:17:57.840
it's just, it's really hard to nail down that stuff.

02:17:57.840 --> 02:18:01.960
I really wish that Microsoft's web interface was better because you know, you can find

02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:09.840
all those indie games on Xbox.com or whatever, but it's not easy to navigate that store and

02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:13.320
I think it'd be really great if they would build something in the web because I think

02:18:13.320 --> 02:18:18.420
that's a great feature to be able to queue up Xbox downloads from the web.

02:18:18.420 --> 02:18:21.660
I did that with the DLC I bought this week for Rhythm Party just so I wouldn't forget

02:18:21.660 --> 02:18:22.660
to do it.

02:18:22.660 --> 02:18:26.120
But yeah, I think they should use the web more to promote the indie games, they really

02:18:26.120 --> 02:18:27.120
should.

02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:29.960
Well that's just my thought.

02:18:29.960 --> 02:18:35.160
Alright, well speaking of things we can't believe have been implemented by now, I still

02:18:35.160 --> 02:18:40.700
can't believe that Apple has not put out an official tangible game button device that

02:18:40.700 --> 02:18:43.280
works with the iPhone and iPad.

02:18:43.280 --> 02:18:44.280
It's been third party.

02:18:44.280 --> 02:18:45.600
Yeah, it's always been third party.

02:18:45.600 --> 02:18:50.440
Well one of the biggest ones is the iCade and I think iCade is kind of getting adopted

02:18:50.440 --> 02:18:53.880
as like the standard now, like there's games that just frickin' support it and one of the

02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:58.440
big ones is the Atari's Classics thing will support iCade and more and more games are

02:18:58.440 --> 02:19:02.800
supporting it so where Apple will not step in, iCade has been.

02:19:02.800 --> 02:19:08.720
iCade is now putting out a new controller that's called the 8-Biddy.

02:19:08.720 --> 02:19:13.360
It is basically an NES controller, is totally what they're jacking here, except it has four

02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:15.860
buttons instead of two.

02:19:15.860 --> 02:19:18.800
But hey, the NES controller was a great controller.

02:19:18.800 --> 02:19:23.520
Kinda flimsy looking back on it, but when I was 11 that thing was rock solid.

02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:28.280
25 bucks if you want this thing on ThinkGeek and it will work on all the games that the

02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:30.480
iCade cabinet works with.

02:19:30.480 --> 02:19:34.960
There's a D-pad start select and four buttons, I don't know what they're called but they're

02:19:34.960 --> 02:19:35.960
there.

02:19:35.960 --> 02:19:36.960
There you go.

02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:41.680
And it looks neat, it looks a little Atari to me, which is strange because it's the 8-Biddy,

02:19:41.680 --> 02:19:46.360
but it looks like it has that wood paneling look on the sides and then kind of that rainbow

02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:51.360
color, kind of some of the old Atari art had, so it's kind of a mishmash of different video

02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:55.120
game worlds, which is fine because they don't want to get sued.

02:19:55.120 --> 02:20:03.920
For me, actually, as much as I like the idea, I wouldn't use it because playing on the controller

02:20:03.920 --> 02:20:04.920
hurts.

02:20:04.920 --> 02:20:05.920
Let's imagine you didn't have that though.

02:20:05.920 --> 02:20:06.920
Good idea, right?

02:20:06.920 --> 02:20:08.920
Yeah, good idea.

02:20:08.920 --> 02:20:11.640
Most people don't.

02:20:11.640 --> 02:20:14.960
When I get an iPad, we actually were going to get an iCade.

02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:15.960
Nice.

02:20:15.960 --> 02:20:18.720
All right, things are pretty nice, I got to say.

02:20:18.720 --> 02:20:20.360
Some day when I have an iPad, we'll see.

02:20:20.360 --> 02:20:23.480
All right, moving on, DarkSakura, speaking of peripherals, right?

02:20:23.480 --> 02:20:24.480
Yep.

02:20:24.480 --> 02:20:32.480
We have some support for Razer, the company Razer, within their lovely peripherals and

02:20:32.480 --> 02:20:34.440
this is actually from Mass Effect 3.

02:20:34.440 --> 02:20:37.720
Their download content comes bundled with the peripherals.

02:20:37.720 --> 02:20:44.400
You actually get the Impertrator gaming mouse, which is 80 bucks.

02:20:44.400 --> 02:20:51.720
There is the Vespula dual-sided gaming mouse mat, the Black Widow Ultimate gaming keyboard,

02:20:51.720 --> 02:21:00.560
the Razer Onza Tournament Edition Xbox 360 controller, the Chimera Xbox 360 gaming headset,

02:21:00.560 --> 02:21:04.960
iPhone 4s protection case, and N7 messenger bag.

02:21:04.960 --> 02:21:11.120
This is kind of big bucks of stuff, but it's all Mass Effect 3.

02:21:11.120 --> 02:21:13.920
What do you think?

02:21:13.920 --> 02:21:15.640
I actually have a Razer mouse now.

02:21:15.640 --> 02:21:20.280
I got one on Woot, the Tron Razer mouse, that came out for that.

02:21:20.280 --> 02:21:22.020
I really love that mouse.

02:21:22.020 --> 02:21:26.120
My only complaint is that I tend to click the side buttons when I don't intend to, so

02:21:26.120 --> 02:21:30.360
I had to actually just disable them because one of them was set to mouse sensitivity and

02:21:30.360 --> 02:21:34.560
that would really screw me up mid-raid, but otherwise, I love that mouse.

02:21:34.560 --> 02:21:36.920
I love that it lights up and plays the Tron music.

02:21:36.920 --> 02:21:38.520
The geek in me giggles every time.

02:21:38.520 --> 02:21:44.680
Well, the other thing about this too is that on Razer's website, they're saying that this

02:21:44.680 --> 02:21:49.400
Mass Effect 3 Collector's Edition peripherals and gear come with a redeemable code to unlock

02:21:49.400 --> 02:21:54.340
bonus items for Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, including the Deadly Collector assault rifle

02:21:54.340 --> 02:21:56.400
to give you a leg up on the Reaper invasion.

02:21:56.400 --> 02:21:57.640
I'm quoting here.

02:21:57.640 --> 02:22:00.960
If you have already unlocked the Collector assault rifle, this code will strengthen the

02:22:00.960 --> 02:22:03.280
weapon further.

02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:11.160
And of course the game comes out in the US on March 9th.

02:22:11.160 --> 02:22:15.920
That's kind of interesting, bundling the DLC with peripherals, but I guess at one point

02:22:15.920 --> 02:22:18.180
there was DLC on Pepsi bottles, right?

02:22:18.180 --> 02:22:22.600
So I guess this isn't anything too new to entice the real fans.

02:22:22.600 --> 02:22:25.200
Sega needs to get their ass in gear and give us Pepsi, man!

02:22:25.200 --> 02:22:28.960
But the problem is, here's the thing, I'm not into Mass Effect, but I know a lot of

02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:33.600
people that are, and if I was into Mass Effect, I wouldn't want that mouse anyway, because

02:22:33.600 --> 02:22:36.400
I have the Tron mouse now.

02:22:36.400 --> 02:22:42.160
You can only really have one mouse, maybe two, if you are really feeling spendy and

02:22:42.160 --> 02:22:45.400
you want one for your laptop as well as your desktop.

02:22:45.400 --> 02:22:46.400
That's it.

02:22:46.400 --> 02:22:47.400
I suppose.

02:22:47.400 --> 02:22:48.400
Yeah.

02:22:48.400 --> 02:22:51.680
All right, just a couple more news stories for you guys, then the Twitter topics and

02:22:51.680 --> 02:22:57.840
the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, but first, Loki.

02:22:57.840 --> 02:23:05.320
All right, I know this is going to come as a shocker to you, so please be prepared, but

02:23:05.320 --> 02:23:07.840
Activision is making another Call of Duty game.

02:23:07.840 --> 02:23:08.840
Get out!

02:23:08.840 --> 02:23:11.040
And it's coming out this fall.

02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:12.040
Shut the front door!

02:23:12.040 --> 02:23:18.960
I know, it's just, I cannot believe that kind of news.

02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:21.320
It just boggles my mind.

02:23:21.320 --> 02:23:27.760
So yes, anyway, so I don't even know why websites are running this story because it's stupid

02:23:27.760 --> 02:23:30.560
but there's a French...

02:23:30.560 --> 02:23:32.000
Here we are reporting on it!

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:33.000
Here we are.

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:39.760
Yeah, there is a French, there's a few French retailers, I think it may have even been Amazon,

02:23:39.760 --> 02:23:42.880
that listed Call of Duty Black Ops 2.

02:23:42.880 --> 02:23:43.880
Well, goodie.

02:23:43.880 --> 02:23:52.080
Then on top of that, there's also this now developer, not really a developer, but kind

02:23:52.080 --> 02:23:57.080
of a contract art studio employee.

02:23:57.080 --> 02:24:04.680
He had listed, one of the pieces that he worked on was Call of Duty Black Ops 2.

02:24:04.680 --> 02:24:12.920
Of course, now he has that taken, his whole profile is taken off of LinkedIn, but yeah,

02:24:12.920 --> 02:24:18.000
I mean, come on, if you're surprised of this news, then you're an idiot, I mean, because

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:19.000
there is seriously...

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:25.460
This is just crazy talk, I mean, what's going to happen next, Loki, Madden 13?

02:24:25.460 --> 02:24:28.000
There's already Madden 13.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.960
I just...

02:24:30.960 --> 02:24:32.840
My mind is blown.

02:24:32.840 --> 02:24:33.840
I know, man.

02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:36.280
I know.

02:24:36.280 --> 02:24:39.520
I don't know what to tell you, but...

02:24:39.520 --> 02:24:43.400
You mean there's not going to be a Guitar Hero 6, or wait, there may actually not be

02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:45.080
a Guitar Hero 6?

02:24:45.080 --> 02:24:48.000
There's a possibility that there will be, but yeah.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:49.000
Alright.

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:54.120
One more news story for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR

02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:56.240
or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:24:56.240 --> 02:25:00.360
Due to the delay, it's probably actually already open by the time you're hearing this.

02:25:00.360 --> 02:25:01.360
This is a quick story.

02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:02.880
This is about...

02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:09.880
This is about the interesting repercussions of the Kickstarter thing, because...

02:25:09.880 --> 02:25:14.360
And the reason why I say that is because, you know, when the Kickstarter raised a million

02:25:14.360 --> 02:25:18.800
bucks last week, I'm sure many of us, and I know we here on the show said, how long

02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:22.920
before everybody else signs up for this, trying to get their game funded.

02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:29.200
Well, it's been mentioned that possibly this game will.

02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:34.340
The folks at InXile Entertainment are going to start a Kickstarter, at least they've mentioned

02:25:34.340 --> 02:25:36.200
their intentions to.

02:25:36.200 --> 02:25:39.960
They did Hunted the Demons Forge, but the game that they want to use Kickstarter to

02:25:39.960 --> 02:25:44.880
do is fund a reboot of Wasteland.

02:25:44.880 --> 02:25:48.900
Brian Fargo, who's the CEO, recently got the rights to this role-playing game that was

02:25:48.900 --> 02:25:53.920
on the PC back in 98?

02:25:53.920 --> 02:26:01.080
I guess it's really a cult popular title because fans have been asking for a remake, and it's

02:26:01.080 --> 02:26:06.200
very early in planning, but after seeing what happened with Double Fine, the CEO Brian Fargo

02:26:06.200 --> 02:26:11.040
is on board, and they would have to raise a million dollars for that to happen.

02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:15.840
I've got to be bluntly honest, I played a lot of old school PC games, and especially

02:26:15.840 --> 02:26:19.120
Commodore 64 growing up, this game did not ring a bell to me.

02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:22.000
And I'm sure there's fans of the game that are like, Rob, you're stupid, you suck.

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:23.800
But I did not know of Wasteland ever.

02:26:23.800 --> 02:26:24.800
I went and looked it up on Wiki.

02:26:24.800 --> 02:26:27.800
Yeah, it's apparently what Fallout's based off of.

02:26:27.800 --> 02:26:28.800
Is it?

02:26:28.800 --> 02:26:29.800
Okay, well now that makes sense.

02:26:29.800 --> 02:26:36.160
Yeah, I was looking, even in the little screenshot, there seemed to be some comparisons, but yeah.

02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:41.840
This series is really old, it goes all the way back to, it was 88, not 98, that's how

02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:43.640
old this game is.

02:26:43.640 --> 02:26:48.120
Apple 2 and Commodore 64 and all that, I don't remember playing it on Commodore 64, and god

02:26:48.120 --> 02:26:50.080
I thought I played everything.

02:26:50.080 --> 02:26:57.720
So that'll be interesting if that can actually get rebooted, but who knows how many people

02:26:57.720 --> 02:26:59.840
will be willing to put their money where their mouth is.

02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:02.320
Dungeon Buster in our chat room says Wasteland is awesome.

02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:06.000
Yeah, but will you pay 15 bucks to see a new one in advance?

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:07.680
We'll see.

02:27:07.680 --> 02:27:13.520
The Skype line is now open, 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:27:13.520 --> 02:27:17.040
Go ahead and give us a call, we're gonna take some calls before we close out the show.

02:27:17.040 --> 02:27:21.520
In the meantime, we're gonna move to our Twitter, Twitter.com slash OLR.

02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:24.680
Our first tweet tonight is from Dark Tetsuya.

02:27:24.680 --> 02:27:30.140
There's an indie game jam type thing I'm going to be partaking in, so wish me luck.

02:27:30.140 --> 02:27:36.040
And sends us a link to this thing at Glorious Train Wrecks, what in the world is this?

02:27:36.040 --> 02:27:39.900
Pirate Cart 5, okay you gotta tell me what this is.

02:27:39.900 --> 02:27:44.260
We're making loads of awesome and or terrible games and taking them to GDC to blow minds

02:27:44.260 --> 02:27:45.260
with them.

02:27:45.260 --> 02:27:48.840
Over the weekend of February 25th to 26th, everyone is invited to make as many games

02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:51.640
as they can and submit them here.

02:27:51.640 --> 02:27:55.360
After the event is over, we will package the games up into a launcher like we did with

02:27:55.360 --> 02:27:56.520
previous Pirate Carts.

02:27:56.520 --> 02:28:00.600
And then this March, we will be showing them off in a kiosk at the Game Developers Conference.

02:28:00.600 --> 02:28:02.560
And they want everyone to participate.

02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:04.520
That's kind of interesting.

02:28:04.520 --> 02:28:09.020
Like please make all these games, we just want to flood.

02:28:09.020 --> 02:28:12.760
It's almost like, let's throw something against the wall and see what sticks.

02:28:12.760 --> 02:28:14.480
I don't know how else to phrase that, but we've got a call.

02:28:14.480 --> 02:28:16.700
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio, who's this?

02:28:16.700 --> 02:28:18.360
It's me, Swan Tom.

02:28:18.360 --> 02:28:19.800
Hey, Swan Tom?

02:28:19.800 --> 02:28:20.800
Yeah.

02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:21.800
Hey, what's up?

02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:22.800
Uh, none much.

02:28:22.800 --> 02:28:25.000
This is my first time calling, obviously.

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.880
I was going to say, I don't recognize the name, but welcome to the show.

02:28:27.880 --> 02:28:31.000
Yeah, I've been listening to Five Years now.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:34.120
Holy schmoly, and this is your first time listening live?

02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:35.120
First time calling in.

02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:37.720
Oh my god, long time listener, first time caller.

02:28:37.720 --> 02:28:44.160
Yeah, like, uh, I usually never listen live because I'm always sleeping or I'm doing something.

02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:45.360
Where do you live?

02:28:45.360 --> 02:28:46.360
I live in Seattle.

02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:48.560
But you're, you're on the West Coast.

02:28:48.560 --> 02:28:49.560
It's not that late.

02:28:49.560 --> 02:28:50.560
Yeah.

02:28:50.560 --> 02:28:51.560
But I work night shift.

02:28:51.560 --> 02:28:52.560
I don't get off work like 4am.

02:28:52.560 --> 02:28:53.560
All right.

02:28:53.560 --> 02:28:54.560
You're excused then.

02:28:54.560 --> 02:28:55.560
All right.

02:28:55.560 --> 02:28:59.320
And the only reason why I remembered was, um, cause I don't know about you, but on Sundays,

02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:05.120
like Loki, I usually like eat a big ass burger and like, I think it's cause I'm getting older.

02:29:05.120 --> 02:29:11.760
I fall asleep after I eat and so it's like, like I get food coma.

02:29:11.760 --> 02:29:15.480
So like by the time I wake up, it's like nine o'clock and it's like already over.

02:29:15.480 --> 02:29:17.160
So there's like no point.

02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:20.240
Yes, I have had similar things going on.

02:29:20.240 --> 02:29:21.240
It's usually after work.

02:29:21.240 --> 02:29:23.480
I'll come home from work and it's like nap.

02:29:23.480 --> 02:29:26.680
I mean, you probably do something similar, but of course you also work the night shift.

02:29:26.680 --> 02:29:27.680
So there you go.

02:29:27.680 --> 02:29:28.680
Yeah, it sucks.

02:29:28.680 --> 02:29:30.080
That's, that's the reason why I'm gaining weight too.

02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:31.680
I eat and I sleep.

02:29:31.680 --> 02:29:34.920
Time to start playing rhythm party and walk a mile every day.

02:29:34.920 --> 02:29:35.920
Yeah.

02:29:35.920 --> 02:29:36.920
I can't do that though.

02:29:36.920 --> 02:29:39.000
Cause uh, I get home at four and I live in an apartment.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:40.000
Oh yeah.

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:41.000
Yeah.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:42.000
Isn't Seattle, isn't Seattle kind of nice though?

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:43.960
Or are there like bad parts?

02:29:43.960 --> 02:29:45.600
Uh, there's bad parts.

02:29:45.600 --> 02:29:46.600
All right.

02:29:46.600 --> 02:29:47.600
I love Seattle for the record.

02:29:47.600 --> 02:29:48.600
Like Tacoma.

02:29:48.600 --> 02:29:49.600
I'm kidding.

02:29:49.600 --> 02:29:50.600
I was just,

02:29:50.600 --> 02:29:51.600
No, no, no.

02:29:51.600 --> 02:29:52.600
Tacoma is actually pretty bad and a lot of,

02:29:52.600 --> 02:29:54.840
I know, but I didn't want to actually say that.

02:29:54.840 --> 02:29:58.320
We went to PAX obviously a few years ago and then I was in Seattle.

02:29:58.320 --> 02:30:03.200
I just went for fun January of 2010 I think.

02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:04.200
I know.

02:30:04.200 --> 02:30:06.400
Cause you were there for a Martin Luther King.

02:30:06.400 --> 02:30:07.920
You were going to see a friend or something.

02:30:07.920 --> 02:30:08.920
Are you a stalker?

02:30:08.920 --> 02:30:09.920
No.

02:30:09.920 --> 02:30:14.880
The only reason why I remember that was because, uh, I was like, Oh, sky's coming, but I don't

02:30:14.880 --> 02:30:16.080
know what you look like.

02:30:16.080 --> 02:30:18.720
And all three of you went to PAX and I was like, where are they?

02:30:18.720 --> 02:30:19.720
I don't know what they look like.

02:30:19.720 --> 02:30:21.080
We were broadcasting in the hall.

02:30:21.080 --> 02:30:25.680
I took a two hour nap on the beanbag section.

02:30:25.680 --> 02:30:29.040
I'm watching Wil Wheaton and Jonathan Colton.

02:30:29.040 --> 02:30:32.380
There's some money questions that have to be answered in my life as I'm sure we all

02:30:32.380 --> 02:30:35.720
have going on this year, but I swear I'm doing everything I can to come to PAX this year

02:30:35.720 --> 02:30:37.520
because I miss it.

02:30:37.520 --> 02:30:39.440
So this year you will know what I look like.

02:30:39.440 --> 02:30:43.920
But last year for some reason, like the tickets sold out really quick and I couldn't find

02:30:43.920 --> 02:30:46.000
any tickets for the three day passes.

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:49.080
So I had to buy Friday, Saturday and Sunday all separate.

02:30:49.080 --> 02:30:50.900
Yeah, that sucked.

02:30:50.900 --> 02:30:52.360
Get in on it early this year.

02:30:52.360 --> 02:30:54.500
Well, to what, to what do we really owe the call?

02:30:54.500 --> 02:30:56.020
This call has been five years in the making.

02:30:56.020 --> 02:30:57.020
What's on your mind?

02:30:57.020 --> 02:31:01.400
Well, I, like I said, I was reminded that the show was on tonight because I was half

02:31:01.400 --> 02:31:06.120
asleep and I was watching a movie called, uh, well it's a dumb movie, it's 17 again.

02:31:06.120 --> 02:31:07.120
It's on Netflix.

02:31:07.120 --> 02:31:09.200
I actually heard it was really good.

02:31:09.200 --> 02:31:13.720
Yeah, well for the time, yeah, but anyways, they go into like this club and it's called

02:31:13.720 --> 02:31:18.200
Orange Lounge and I was like, oh, Orange Lounge is on.

02:31:18.200 --> 02:31:21.160
So I turned on the computer and here I am.

02:31:21.160 --> 02:31:23.840
We're going to fucking sue their asses for jacking our name.

02:31:23.840 --> 02:31:26.680
Yeah, and we'll do that when the Mobo Mogo people get us.

02:31:26.680 --> 02:31:27.680
Oh yeah, that's right.

02:31:27.680 --> 02:31:29.360
Konami, Konami could probably get us first.

02:31:29.360 --> 02:31:31.480
But we're Orange Lounge Radio.

02:31:31.480 --> 02:31:33.240
Yeah, there you go.

02:31:33.240 --> 02:31:34.240
There's the radio part.

02:31:34.240 --> 02:31:38.360
But anyways, my question was, um, why don't you like Terraria?

02:31:38.360 --> 02:31:41.200
Oh God, I knew it.

02:31:41.200 --> 02:31:44.440
Rabid, Rabid Minecrafty fans calling in.

02:31:44.440 --> 02:31:45.840
Why do you hate our game?

02:31:45.840 --> 02:31:46.840
I don't hate it.

02:31:46.840 --> 02:31:49.560
I just, I didn't understand it at all.

02:31:49.560 --> 02:31:50.960
Like I'm trying to play it.

02:31:50.960 --> 02:31:52.200
Here's the thing.

02:31:52.200 --> 02:31:55.180
I think you have to be an artistic person to get into those games.

02:31:55.180 --> 02:31:59.960
And if you ever saw my art, which is ironic because I did the design thing for a little

02:31:59.960 --> 02:32:00.960
bit.

02:32:00.960 --> 02:32:04.280
Like, I don't know why I was able to do that, but like my drawing is terrible and just kind

02:32:04.280 --> 02:32:07.440
of getting into that game, I was like, the hell am I supposed to be doing?

02:32:07.440 --> 02:32:14.240
It was very weird to me to not have any tutorial, any objective, any anything.

02:32:14.240 --> 02:32:18.640
And I realized for some people, that's the charm and I respect that.

02:32:18.640 --> 02:32:21.520
But for me, I was just, I just felt so lost and overwhelmed.

02:32:21.520 --> 02:32:23.080
I was like back to wow.

02:32:23.080 --> 02:32:26.680
Yeah, in a way, wow was like that for me too.

02:32:26.680 --> 02:32:31.000
Like I started, but I played for like two minutes because I was like, I don't know what

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:32.000
to do.

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:33.320
I don't know where to go.

02:32:33.320 --> 02:32:34.880
When did you play wow?

02:32:34.880 --> 02:32:35.880
Huh?

02:32:35.880 --> 02:32:37.720
When did you play wow?

02:32:37.720 --> 02:32:39.280
Was it recently or a long time ago?

02:32:39.280 --> 02:32:41.360
It was like a year and a half ago.

02:32:41.360 --> 02:32:42.360
They put it out with-

02:32:42.360 --> 02:32:43.360
That was Cataclysm then.

02:32:43.360 --> 02:32:44.360
Might've been.

02:32:44.360 --> 02:32:46.640
With the Cataclysm expansion, they redid the beginner stuff.

02:32:46.640 --> 02:32:48.640
So it might be a little better now.

02:32:48.640 --> 02:32:51.080
I hated wow before that and I really like it now.

02:32:51.080 --> 02:32:52.080
Oh.

02:32:52.080 --> 02:32:53.080
Yeah.

02:32:53.080 --> 02:32:54.080
Yeah.

02:32:54.080 --> 02:32:55.080
And plus I have no friends to talk to.

02:32:55.080 --> 02:32:58.600
So it's just like, I'm walking around and like, I'll see a character and I'll talk to

02:32:58.600 --> 02:33:01.600
him or at least I think I'm talking to him anyways.

02:33:01.600 --> 02:33:06.680
And like, I don't know, I just feel like I'm barging in or like, I'm like a stalker.

02:33:06.680 --> 02:33:08.200
Like hey, look, there's a person.

02:33:08.200 --> 02:33:10.520
So I go over there, talk and then they just walk away.

02:33:10.520 --> 02:33:13.680
I'm like, oh, it's like real life.

02:33:13.680 --> 02:33:14.680
It's weird.

02:33:14.680 --> 02:33:15.680
People in wow don't want to talk.

02:33:15.680 --> 02:33:16.680
Wait a minute.

02:33:16.680 --> 02:33:20.040
You have no friends in wow, but you've got friends IRL, right?

02:33:20.040 --> 02:33:21.440
No, not really.

02:33:21.440 --> 02:33:22.440
No.

02:33:22.440 --> 02:33:23.440
Well, cause I work night shift.

02:33:23.440 --> 02:33:28.440
I have friends from school and stuff, but like when I want to hang out, everyone's sleeping.

02:33:28.440 --> 02:33:32.880
He seems like he's mentally stable, at least from what we're getting in this hall.

02:33:32.880 --> 02:33:33.880
I'll be your wow buddy.

02:33:33.880 --> 02:33:35.360
We'll be, we'll be your friend.

02:33:35.360 --> 02:33:36.680
You can add me on Steam.

02:33:36.680 --> 02:33:40.520
Yeah, I have Steam too, but like I have no friends on Steam.

02:33:40.520 --> 02:33:43.080
So it's like, there's no games to play with anyone.

02:33:43.080 --> 02:33:47.320
Cause like I look on forums and stuff cause there's shows that have forums, but like every

02:33:47.320 --> 02:33:50.600
now and then I'll look in the forum and there's trolls all the time.

02:33:50.600 --> 02:33:51.600
And it's just like, wow.

02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:52.600
No, no, no.

02:33:52.600 --> 02:33:55.200
There's, there's a safe place on Steam for you.

02:33:55.200 --> 02:33:58.400
You're going to go to orangelawntradio.com and on the left hand side, there's a little

02:33:58.400 --> 02:34:00.440
box that says, or no, now it's in the upper right.

02:34:00.440 --> 02:34:01.440
It says interact with us.

02:34:01.440 --> 02:34:03.440
I don't even know my own damn site.

02:34:03.440 --> 02:34:06.720
It's and there's a little picture of the Steam icon and that'll take you to the OLR Steam

02:34:06.720 --> 02:34:07.720
community.

02:34:07.720 --> 02:34:11.560
And we have one rule in the OLR Steam community and that is don't be a Dick.

02:34:11.560 --> 02:34:12.600
Don't be a Dick.

02:34:12.600 --> 02:34:16.320
So you're not going to get that in the, and if you get it, I want screenshots and you

02:34:16.320 --> 02:34:18.020
report their asses to me.

02:34:18.020 --> 02:34:21.720
And I will, Jamie, I will sick Jamie on them.

02:34:21.720 --> 02:34:24.440
I will slap a bitch.

02:34:24.440 --> 02:34:27.640
If you want to find me, I'm not there as dark Sakura and there's Kurosabasa.

02:34:27.640 --> 02:34:28.640
Yeah.

02:34:28.640 --> 02:34:29.640
So we're, we're there.

02:34:29.640 --> 02:34:33.440
So, so feel free to add us and add, I'm sure there's folks in chat that'll be like, I like

02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:36.280
Terraria, so I'll play it with you.

02:34:36.280 --> 02:34:37.280
I didn't dislike it.

02:34:37.280 --> 02:34:38.280
I just didn't get into it.

02:34:38.280 --> 02:34:39.280
Before I let you go.

02:34:39.280 --> 02:34:41.880
I got to know why do you like Terraria?

02:34:41.880 --> 02:34:42.880
It's sway me.

02:34:42.880 --> 02:34:43.880
Why should I be playing this game?

02:34:43.880 --> 02:34:45.720
Well, the aesthetic is really nice.

02:34:45.720 --> 02:34:50.520
I'm not really smart when it comes, well, I am smart, but I don't know, I don't understand

02:34:50.520 --> 02:34:54.320
the whole eight bit and 16 bit, but it's got kind of like that same aesthetic.

02:34:54.320 --> 02:34:57.560
So that's why I was wondering why you didn't like it because I know you like, you know,

02:34:57.560 --> 02:35:01.360
older games and it's in two, it's two D, it's not three D. I played Minecraft.

02:35:01.360 --> 02:35:06.760
I hated Minecraft because it's three D, but the world looks like crap and like you kind

02:35:06.760 --> 02:35:11.840
of, it's like an RPG almost like you grind as in like mining or, and you can get better

02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:15.000
pickaxes to pick faster.

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:19.280
Later on, if you, uh, if you really want, you don't have to, there are boss battles.

02:35:19.280 --> 02:35:22.260
There's three boss battles, but they already added a lot more.

02:35:22.260 --> 02:35:26.760
So there's another boss battle, which adds more bosses later and they added more stuff

02:35:26.760 --> 02:35:29.480
from previous versions of the game.

02:35:29.480 --> 02:35:33.520
It's just, they keep adding onto it and it's just something very addictive about it.

02:35:33.520 --> 02:35:37.540
And like me and my girlfriend, like, uh, sometimes on the weekends we'll play and we'll make

02:35:37.540 --> 02:35:38.840
our own house together.

02:35:38.840 --> 02:35:41.080
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, no, stop, stop.

02:35:41.080 --> 02:35:43.140
You don't have friends, but you're getting laid.

02:35:43.140 --> 02:35:45.120
You have a girlfriend, that's why you don't have friends.

02:35:45.120 --> 02:35:46.120
That's why you don't have friends.

02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:49.120
This is the woman saying it.

02:35:49.120 --> 02:35:50.120
No, I'm kidding.

02:35:50.120 --> 02:35:51.120
I'm kidding.

02:35:51.120 --> 02:35:52.120
Okay.

02:35:52.120 --> 02:35:53.120
I'm glad.

02:35:53.120 --> 02:35:54.120
I'm glad.

02:35:54.120 --> 02:35:55.120
At least you're getting taken care of.

02:35:55.120 --> 02:35:56.120
All right.

02:35:56.120 --> 02:35:57.120
I'm getting taken care of in that way.

02:35:57.120 --> 02:35:59.840
But you know, after a while when you live with some like two years, we've been together

02:35:59.840 --> 02:36:06.240
for four, but like after a while you kind of want friends, you know, like, like, okay.

02:36:06.240 --> 02:36:08.400
I want to go out on a double date once in a while.

02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:13.080
Yeah, well we're not married, but if we are, is it this how it's going to be?

02:36:13.080 --> 02:36:14.520
I'm going to tell you something.

02:36:14.520 --> 02:36:18.900
When I moved out here from Alabama, all I had really was Dan and his friends and actually

02:36:18.900 --> 02:36:23.000
one of his friends became my best friend, Becky.

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:27.680
But I, it wasn't until I actually started venturing out to the arcades when we had good

02:36:27.680 --> 02:36:33.320
ones and made friends on my own and found other groups that I could get involved with.

02:36:33.320 --> 02:36:38.440
I am now like three people, like three or four people that I met at school are now really

02:36:38.440 --> 02:36:39.440
good friends of mine.

02:36:39.440 --> 02:36:44.360
And I will say this on Jamie's behalf, the best road trips that Jamie and Dan have ever

02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:46.120
taken have been with me.

02:36:46.120 --> 02:36:49.320
They really have cause Rob's heard us fight.

02:36:49.320 --> 02:36:50.640
I will say this though.

02:36:50.640 --> 02:36:54.160
Every time I go to like say, cause there's game works in Seattle.

02:36:54.160 --> 02:36:59.300
Every time I go there and I played DDR, there's like this one weird person that like walks

02:36:59.300 --> 02:37:03.000
up to the DDR machine because I'm pretty good at DDR.

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:08.000
I can beat max 300 pretty easily, but like people will just like come up to me, just

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:09.000
stare at me.

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:13.880
They come on, they're like kind of follow me, you know, and like ask me questions and

02:37:13.880 --> 02:37:14.880
like cling on.

02:37:14.880 --> 02:37:15.880
It's kind of weird.

02:37:15.880 --> 02:37:17.360
So I kind of just stopped with that scene.

02:37:17.360 --> 02:37:20.960
Did you say they ask you questions and cling on?

02:37:20.960 --> 02:37:21.960
They cling on.

02:37:21.960 --> 02:37:26.600
Oh, cause I was going to say you should just reply KA-BLAH.

02:37:26.600 --> 02:37:27.600
Yeah.

02:37:27.600 --> 02:37:29.240
Uh, I just get weirded out.

02:37:29.240 --> 02:37:30.240
That's it.

02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:31.240
I would get weirded out too.

02:37:31.240 --> 02:37:34.760
Uh, you know, there's, there's ways to approach people and like stalking them is not one of

02:37:34.760 --> 02:37:38.960
them, but it's an, you know, every fan scene has their very socially awkward.

02:37:38.960 --> 02:37:40.520
People in it.

02:37:40.520 --> 02:37:44.880
And let's be real, DDR has its fair share of socially awkward people.

02:37:44.880 --> 02:37:50.100
Um, and, and so, you know, I, I don't know if there's an easy way to handle it.

02:37:50.100 --> 02:37:54.320
Like you can, you can either be nice, you know, if you want to, or you can just be like,

02:37:54.320 --> 02:37:57.800
okay, you're like violating some kind of code here and you gotta, you gotta like, bro, you

02:37:57.800 --> 02:37:58.800
gotta go.

02:37:58.800 --> 02:37:59.800
Yeah.

02:37:59.800 --> 02:38:00.800
But that's the thing.

02:38:00.800 --> 02:38:02.040
I don't say that to people cause, um, I'm kind of nice and I don't want to get in those

02:38:02.040 --> 02:38:03.040
situations.

02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:04.040
Yeah.

02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:07.560
You know, if I was in that position, I'd be like, Oh, this guy's a dick.

02:38:07.560 --> 02:38:08.560
Yeah.

02:38:08.560 --> 02:38:09.560
I don't really do that.

02:38:09.560 --> 02:38:11.120
Just like kind of brush them off lightly.

02:38:11.120 --> 02:38:14.120
Like like I smoke, but I don't smoke that much.

02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:18.640
So if someone follows me, I know that they don't smoke cause you could tell a smoker

02:38:18.640 --> 02:38:19.640
from a non-smoker.

02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:20.640
Sure.

02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:21.640
So I'll just smoke.

02:38:21.640 --> 02:38:27.920
It's kind of like my repellent, but like, like bees, it's kind of like smoke.

02:38:27.920 --> 02:38:30.040
You throw them on bees cause you don't want them to sting you.

02:38:30.040 --> 02:38:31.040
So they just run away.

02:38:31.040 --> 02:38:32.040
Wait a minute.

02:38:32.040 --> 02:38:33.480
You're a smoker and you can beat max 300.

02:38:33.480 --> 02:38:34.480
Yeah.

02:38:34.480 --> 02:38:35.480
That's a pretty big achievement.

02:38:35.480 --> 02:38:38.360
I mean, I gotta say, I'm not going to judge you for the smoking thing cause I smoked for

02:38:38.360 --> 02:38:42.000
years, but I would have never been able to beat max 300 as a smoker.

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:43.920
Well, yeah, it's pretty easy.

02:38:43.920 --> 02:38:48.200
I mean, like if you smoke and you regularly exercise, it's you get used to it.

02:38:48.200 --> 02:38:49.200
All right.

02:38:49.200 --> 02:38:50.200
All right.

02:38:50.200 --> 02:38:51.200
Well, um, you know what?

02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:56.560
I gotta let you go so we can get more calls, but, um, I, I will, I will give Terraria a

02:38:56.560 --> 02:38:59.360
second chance and seriously go to the steam community.

02:38:59.360 --> 02:39:01.440
And I see people giving out their name and chat right now.

02:39:01.440 --> 02:39:02.440
All right.

02:39:02.440 --> 02:39:04.480
You can have people to play Terraria with.

02:39:04.480 --> 02:39:05.480
All right.

02:39:05.480 --> 02:39:06.480
All right.

02:39:06.480 --> 02:39:11.400
So do not quit cause if you quit, I'm going to find you in LA or wherever you are, Sacramento,

02:39:11.400 --> 02:39:12.400
but that's all you get.

02:39:12.400 --> 02:39:14.580
All right.

02:39:14.580 --> 02:39:16.080
It's like Seattle, but less rain.

02:39:16.080 --> 02:39:17.080
All right.

02:39:17.080 --> 02:39:18.080
Yeah.

02:39:18.080 --> 02:39:19.080
All right.

02:39:19.080 --> 02:39:20.080
Later.

02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:21.080
Later.

02:39:21.080 --> 02:39:22.080
That was a fun call.

02:39:22.080 --> 02:39:23.080
I let it go on a little longer.

02:39:23.080 --> 02:39:25.280
Usually I try to keep it in five minutes, but Hey, he was a long time listener.

02:39:25.280 --> 02:39:26.840
I spelled mine out in chat.

02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:30.880
So one eight seven seven game OLR or username on Skype is orange Laundraido.

02:39:30.880 --> 02:39:33.760
By the way, I just want to say with that last call, I'm not endorsing smoking.

02:39:33.760 --> 02:39:37.360
It's just, I'm not going to be that guy that's like, you need to quit smoking right now.

02:39:37.360 --> 02:39:38.780
Trust me smokers.

02:39:38.780 --> 02:39:43.060
They know the choice they're making and I've heard the pros and cons and you usually just

02:39:43.060 --> 02:39:47.080
have to have something happen where you're like, okay, I'm going to quit.

02:39:47.080 --> 02:39:50.640
So that's what happened to me is finally, I just hit a point where something happened

02:39:50.640 --> 02:39:52.000
and I was like, you know what?

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:53.440
I'm now going to quit.

02:39:53.440 --> 02:39:58.480
So anyhow, let's move on with more calls higher on orange Laundraido.

02:39:58.480 --> 02:39:59.480
Who's this?

02:39:59.480 --> 02:40:01.480
Hey, this is hackdeft.

02:40:01.480 --> 02:40:03.840
Our favorite Mexican.

02:40:03.840 --> 02:40:05.160
Yeah.

02:40:05.160 --> 02:40:08.100
Actually we have two or three Mexicans that listen, so I shouldn't play favorites.

02:40:08.100 --> 02:40:13.040
So one of our favorite Mexicans, what's on your mind, buddy?

02:40:13.040 --> 02:40:18.920
Uh, I just wanted to talk about, uh, the article you, uh, you were talking about, uh, video

02:40:18.920 --> 02:40:22.880
game music being in the hall of fame.

02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:23.880
Yes.

02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:24.880
The classic music in the hall of fame.

02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:26.600
What'd you want to say about it?

02:40:26.600 --> 02:40:33.400
Well, basically you talk about if, whether it should be recognized as classical music

02:40:33.400 --> 02:40:37.160
or it should be recognized there in the hall of fame.

02:40:37.160 --> 02:40:44.240
And I think, and this is a very strong opinion of mine that it should be, uh, uh, recognized

02:40:44.240 --> 02:40:48.000
as music by everyone.

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:49.000
Well absolutely.

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.360
But what about classical music?

02:40:51.360 --> 02:40:53.360
That's that's the key thing.

02:40:53.360 --> 02:40:55.720
Well, that's the thing.

02:40:55.720 --> 02:41:04.120
I don't consider it, consider it, uh, as classical music at least it, uh, because, well, you're

02:41:04.120 --> 02:41:11.000
talking about genres and all that and video game music is more, uh, how do you say it?

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:12.000
Contemporary?

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:13.000
More modern?

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.740
Yeah, I agree with you.

02:41:15.740 --> 02:41:21.880
So as classical music, I don't think it should be, uh, well, characterized.

02:41:21.880 --> 02:41:29.960
So, uh, so like that, I don't think so, but it should definitely be recognized.

02:41:29.960 --> 02:41:32.120
All right.

02:41:32.120 --> 02:41:37.280
Well, I mean, it's just, I think there's a lot of like contemporary classical, which

02:41:37.280 --> 02:41:42.240
is a really weird term, but I guess it's like, you know, um, when you kind of write your

02:41:42.240 --> 02:41:45.600
music with that classical sound and you're influenced with that.

02:41:45.600 --> 02:41:46.600
And I don't know, I get that.

02:41:46.600 --> 02:41:47.600
I get that sense.

02:41:47.600 --> 02:41:52.360
I think it's very, I think that's why things like Dear Friends work is that they feel like

02:41:52.360 --> 02:41:58.440
a night out at the orchestra, but it's music I killed monsters to.

02:41:58.440 --> 02:42:06.680
Well, the thing with me is that classical music is more like Beethoven, Mozart, uh,

02:42:06.680 --> 02:42:08.480
things like that.

02:42:08.480 --> 02:42:15.360
And well, while, while some music, like, especially in Final Fantasy, that is heavily orchestrated.

02:42:15.360 --> 02:42:20.480
Well, it sounds like classical music, but it, but it isn't, it isn't classical.

02:42:20.480 --> 02:42:22.320
It isn't a classical piece.

02:42:22.320 --> 02:42:27.440
It's an orchestrated, uh, modern piece, but it isn't classical.

02:42:27.440 --> 02:42:28.440
Okay.

02:42:28.440 --> 02:42:29.440
Okay.

02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:34.520
So maybe they're just, and I'm sure there's a better word to define this genre of music.

02:42:34.520 --> 02:42:35.960
You know what it makes me think of?

02:42:35.960 --> 02:42:38.880
It makes me think of fusion, like Vanessa May.

02:42:38.880 --> 02:42:39.880
Okay.

02:42:39.880 --> 02:42:44.120
And what, like, if I were to look in a CD store, wouldn't they, that'd be like adult

02:42:44.120 --> 02:42:46.160
contemporary, but then that makes me think like Celine Dion.

02:42:46.160 --> 02:42:47.800
It would be under instrumental.

02:42:47.800 --> 02:42:48.800
Yeah.

02:42:48.800 --> 02:42:49.800
Okay.

02:42:49.800 --> 02:42:50.800
Okay.

02:42:50.800 --> 02:42:53.920
Or, uh, sometimes you find them under world music sometimes.

02:42:53.920 --> 02:42:56.720
Do you think that if this gets enough votes, Oh, go ahead.

02:42:56.720 --> 02:42:58.720
I was gonna say one more place you find video game music.

02:42:58.720 --> 02:43:02.080
There is under soundtrack sections cause I find it all the time at dimple.

02:43:02.080 --> 02:43:03.080
True.

02:43:03.080 --> 02:43:08.400
Do you think if there is, Oh, I like this comment from Black Wolf in our chat at chat.orangesoundsradio.com.

02:43:08.400 --> 02:43:11.920
Classical is a style of music, not an era of music.

02:43:11.920 --> 02:43:13.300
Maybe a different way of thinking about it.

02:43:13.300 --> 02:43:19.720
Maybe you're thinking about classical in the, um, era sense, but, um, all this stuff aside,

02:43:19.720 --> 02:43:24.160
what, what it is or what it isn't, we just know, you know, we like this music.

02:43:24.160 --> 02:43:31.180
Do you think if it wins the poll, do you think that the UK radio station will ultimately

02:43:31.180 --> 02:43:36.620
recognize it or do you think they'll reject it as like, Oh, it's these silly gamer fan

02:43:36.620 --> 02:43:40.160
boys are doing this and we're just going to throw their votes out?

02:43:40.160 --> 02:43:46.680
Well, they may be recognized it and all because, well, the people voted for it.

02:43:46.680 --> 02:43:54.520
So I don't think why it shouldn't be, but like I said, and maybe Black Wolf has a point,

02:43:54.520 --> 02:44:02.200
but like I said, it, it isn't classical in the sense that it, it hasn't like, uh, like

02:44:02.200 --> 02:44:04.080
I said, it isn't very classical.

02:44:04.080 --> 02:44:10.880
It isn't something from the 18, 18 hundreds or the 17 hundreds.

02:44:10.880 --> 02:44:11.880
It's modern.

02:44:11.880 --> 02:44:19.640
It's something like as of recent and then there's very, and there's other, uh, uh, outside

02:44:19.640 --> 02:44:27.040
of video games that, that also have, uh, classical pieces or that sound classical, but I don't

02:44:27.040 --> 02:44:33.360
at least, uh, in my opinion, and I know that Black Wolf is a classic, uh, as a musician

02:44:33.360 --> 02:44:36.040
and it's trained for that, but this is my opinion.

02:44:36.040 --> 02:44:39.040
And like I said, it isn't for me.

02:44:39.040 --> 02:44:40.040
Okay.

02:44:40.040 --> 02:44:41.040
That's, that's fair.

02:44:41.040 --> 02:44:42.040
That's fair.

02:44:42.040 --> 02:44:45.960
Uh, and, uh, JV Mon in our chat room gives a term that should have been fricking obvious,

02:44:45.960 --> 02:44:47.960
orchestral music.

02:44:47.960 --> 02:44:49.160
That's a word I should have thought of.

02:44:49.160 --> 02:44:50.160
All right.

02:44:50.160 --> 02:44:52.900
Let me take this a completely different direction and then we'll end this call active since

02:44:52.900 --> 02:44:56.180
you brought up music and all this and what you like and so forth.

02:44:56.180 --> 02:44:59.560
What is your favorite video game music ever?

02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:00.560
No.

02:45:00.560 --> 02:45:08.440
This, that is a very tough question for me, especially since I'll make a little plug here

02:45:08.440 --> 02:45:14.400
and well, and I love and I love, sorry, I love that song.

02:45:14.400 --> 02:45:15.400
I love that.

02:45:15.400 --> 02:45:18.320
The music articles we do for all are right.

02:45:18.320 --> 02:45:25.100
Me and Dr. Zuya, we try to pick at least in my, in my, um, personal perspective, I tried

02:45:25.100 --> 02:45:29.440
to pick something that is, that it isn't that recognized.

02:45:29.440 --> 02:45:40.160
But if I had to pick one soundtrack that I really, really like, it should be, and I think

02:45:40.160 --> 02:45:48.880
I may, I maybe, uh, maybe I, I will think about another, but in the future, but, uh,

02:45:48.880 --> 02:45:55.320
I think the Silent Hill 2, uh, soundtrack is like awesome.

02:45:55.320 --> 02:45:56.320
Interesting direction.

02:45:56.320 --> 02:45:57.320
No, it's great.

02:45:57.320 --> 02:45:58.320
It is.

02:45:58.320 --> 02:45:59.320
That's a great pick.

02:45:59.320 --> 02:46:00.320
Interesting direction.

02:46:00.320 --> 02:46:04.440
I, that's not one I usually hear people say is their absolute favorite, but it's really

02:46:04.440 --> 02:46:05.440
damn good.

02:46:05.440 --> 02:46:07.440
So I, I'm not surprised to hear that at all.

02:46:07.440 --> 02:46:09.360
Akira Yamaoka is great.

02:46:09.360 --> 02:46:10.360
He's a great guy.

02:46:10.360 --> 02:46:11.360
All right.

02:46:11.360 --> 02:46:16.760
You know, cause like my, one of my favorite composers, if not the best in video game music

02:46:16.760 --> 02:46:18.400
and definitely not something I would call classical.

02:46:18.400 --> 02:46:19.400
All right.

02:46:19.400 --> 02:46:20.400
Definitely.

02:46:20.400 --> 02:46:21.400
All right.

02:46:21.400 --> 02:46:23.800
On the same note, I actually prefer Silent Hill 3, that soundtrack.

02:46:23.800 --> 02:46:25.440
Yeah, but still it's all, it's all Akira.

02:46:25.440 --> 02:46:26.440
That's really good.

02:46:26.440 --> 02:46:27.440
Yeah.

02:46:27.440 --> 02:46:28.440
All right.

02:46:28.440 --> 02:46:30.440
We'll have one more call in for the end of the show, but have a great night.

02:46:30.440 --> 02:46:31.440
Okay.

02:46:31.440 --> 02:46:32.440
You too.

02:46:32.440 --> 02:46:33.440
All right.

02:46:33.440 --> 02:46:34.440
Thanks buddy.

02:46:34.440 --> 02:46:35.440
Uh, quick, one more quick call.

02:46:35.440 --> 02:46:38.760
We cannot make time for when it we're running a little long, but we, we took a extended

02:46:38.760 --> 02:46:43.760
break and then, um, we had a long call there to start, but I'll try to squeeze in one more

02:46:43.760 --> 02:46:44.760
quick call.

02:46:44.760 --> 02:46:45.760
One eight seven seven game.

02:46:45.760 --> 02:46:47.960
O L R or a username on Skype is orange launch radio.

02:46:47.960 --> 02:46:51.120
If you want to give us a call, uh, Twitter topics, I got to get through those real quick.

02:46:51.120 --> 02:46:54.240
I only got through the first one, uh, tiger class and in a couple of quick ones, I'll

02:46:54.240 --> 02:46:58.240
try to get out here quick, quick BAFTA nominations, which we missed.

02:46:58.240 --> 02:47:02.400
Talking about on the show, BAFTA is the British Academy film and television arts.

02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:07.560
They have, uh, released the nominations for the 2012 video game awards, which honors the

02:47:07.560 --> 02:47:13.160
top games from 2011, the year before, and they've nominated in various categories, action,

02:47:13.160 --> 02:47:14.160
artistic achievement.

02:47:14.160 --> 02:47:19.640
I don't really have time to read all of these games, uh, but I will say quickly the game

02:47:19.640 --> 02:47:25.700
award of the year, Batman, Arkham city, battlefield three, call of duty, modern warfare three

02:47:25.700 --> 02:47:30.280
FIFA 12 LA noir Minecraft portal to elder scrolls, Skyrim, legend of Zelda, Skyward

02:47:30.280 --> 02:47:33.920
sword and uncharted three phone higher on orange launch radio.

02:47:33.920 --> 02:47:34.920
Who's this?

02:47:34.920 --> 02:47:36.720
Hey, this is Bobby black Wolf.

02:47:36.720 --> 02:47:38.240
Oh, Hey Bobby.

02:47:38.240 --> 02:47:40.920
What could you ever be calling in about what's on your mind?

02:47:40.920 --> 02:47:47.080
So Wikipedia says classical music is the art music produced in or rooted in the traditions

02:47:47.080 --> 02:47:50.680
of Western liturgical and secular music.

02:47:50.680 --> 02:47:55.520
So it's all about the style and not necessarily when it was composed because Leonard Bernstein

02:47:55.520 --> 02:47:59.720
was a great classical composer and he was born this century.

02:47:59.720 --> 02:48:05.160
So does that mean that like, uh, kabuki theater music would not be considered classical because

02:48:05.160 --> 02:48:07.160
it's Eastern.

02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:11.200
There's um, let's see, basically classical is mostly Western music.

02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:12.200
Yeah.

02:48:12.200 --> 02:48:16.920
According to this, a lot of the terminology here, it's usually like American or European.

02:48:16.920 --> 02:48:18.480
Where would you find something like Brian Eno?

02:48:18.480 --> 02:48:22.080
Is that classical or is that considered like new age?

02:48:22.080 --> 02:48:23.080
Probably new age.

02:48:23.080 --> 02:48:31.140
Cause I've played both classical and I play new age music as have I and jazz.

02:48:31.140 --> 02:48:32.600
So Bobby, what do you say?

02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:36.040
Of course, Bobby, I gotta, I gotta let you plug your show here, which you're on before

02:48:36.040 --> 02:48:38.880
us at all games radio, of course, Sunday nights.

02:48:38.880 --> 02:48:44.600
But um, what do you think about the whole trying to push for video game recognition

02:48:44.600 --> 02:48:47.800
on a classical music station?

02:48:47.800 --> 02:48:52.240
I think it's great because I mean, and here's the thing, like everybody's like, Oh, well

02:48:52.240 --> 02:48:56.080
that, that wasn't even the best song in final fantasy seven and blah, blah, blah.

02:48:56.080 --> 02:48:57.120
Here's the thing.

02:48:57.120 --> 02:49:04.160
You need to get the majority to agree with you and to be able to get something recognized

02:49:04.160 --> 02:49:05.160
on that platform.

02:49:05.160 --> 02:49:11.560
And you know, yeah, Aerith's theme, you know, was created on a synth and everything, but

02:49:11.560 --> 02:49:17.960
the more friends CD version, I know the concert sucked, but that CD version, if you play that

02:49:17.960 --> 02:49:21.320
for somebody who doesn't know it's from a video game, they will think it's one of the

02:49:21.320 --> 02:49:25.200
most beautiful classical pieces they've heard in a long time.

02:49:25.200 --> 02:49:29.960
And that's really the testament to that piece.

02:49:29.960 --> 02:49:33.760
And yes, it's, if somebody doesn't know it's from a video game, they will think it is a

02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:35.440
classical piece.

02:49:35.440 --> 02:49:36.440
I agree.

02:49:36.440 --> 02:49:40.060
You've got to rally the troops behind one thing or it's not going to work.

02:49:40.060 --> 02:49:41.640
You're going to, you're going to divide it all up.

02:49:41.640 --> 02:49:46.360
So, you know, I think they just kind of had to say, you know what, this is the song that

02:49:46.360 --> 02:49:49.680
had a huge moment that was notable in gaming.

02:49:49.680 --> 02:49:50.680
We're going to go here.

02:49:50.680 --> 02:49:55.400
You know, I can see that despite how, you know, whatever song from Final Fantasy 7 or

02:49:55.400 --> 02:49:57.240
even Final Fantasy 6 may be your favorite.

02:49:57.240 --> 02:50:01.840
Like if it were me picking a Final Fantasy song, I think Terra's theme from Final Fantasy

02:50:01.840 --> 02:50:04.360
6 is like the greatest Final Fantasy song there ever was.

02:50:04.360 --> 02:50:06.840
I think the marching version of that is the best.

02:50:06.840 --> 02:50:07.840
Love it.

02:50:07.840 --> 02:50:11.640
Well, I actually did, I did a little more digging on this and actually the Aerith's

02:50:11.640 --> 02:50:14.240
theme that's in Final Fantasy 7 is not eligible.

02:50:14.240 --> 02:50:17.200
Oh no, why is that?

02:50:17.200 --> 02:50:19.920
Here's why, because it was made for a synth.

02:50:19.920 --> 02:50:20.920
Oh.

02:50:20.920 --> 02:50:25.040
But, you can nominate one of the later versions.

02:50:25.040 --> 02:50:30.200
So, you know, basically what they're nominating is that it was rearranged for an orchestra.

02:50:30.200 --> 02:50:35.320
That is also applicable, but also that Facebook fan page is not just concentrating on Aerith's

02:50:35.320 --> 02:50:36.320
theme.

02:50:36.320 --> 02:50:37.320
That was the first one.

02:50:37.320 --> 02:50:42.400
They actually, like every week, they're putting up a new classical piece from video games

02:50:42.400 --> 02:50:47.600
that you can also put in, like Dragonborn from Skyrim is currently also, they're trying

02:50:47.600 --> 02:50:49.000
to get people to vote for that.

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:50.760
They just want something in there.

02:50:50.760 --> 02:50:54.360
Aerith's theme is just the one that's going to be the most popular that the most people

02:50:54.360 --> 02:50:57.080
are going to go into.

02:50:57.080 --> 02:51:03.920
But they've got several suggestions of pieces that do fit the criteria that Classic FM has

02:51:03.920 --> 02:51:04.920
set.

02:51:04.920 --> 02:51:10.760
They actually do have rules and the original PlayStation 1 version of Aerith's theme does

02:51:10.760 --> 02:51:11.760
not count.

02:51:11.760 --> 02:51:15.760
I gotta give you credit, Dark Soccer, you kinda were on that track earlier when you

02:51:15.760 --> 02:51:16.760
were talking about that.

02:51:16.760 --> 02:51:17.760
So I gotta give you props.

02:51:17.760 --> 02:51:18.760
Thank you.

02:51:18.760 --> 02:51:21.520
I thought you brought that up earlier.

02:51:21.520 --> 02:51:23.360
You know, some great suggestions from our chatroom too.

02:51:23.360 --> 02:51:28.040
JV Monn says the simple and clean orchestral version is amazing.

02:51:28.040 --> 02:51:31.520
That was one of the other ones that they had suggested on that same Facebook page.

02:51:31.520 --> 02:51:36.800
The story that Tommy T. tells about that, and I think he told it on your show and ours

02:51:36.800 --> 02:51:40.840
about how Disney didn't want to give the rights to the visuals, but then they heard it and

02:51:40.840 --> 02:51:45.000
not a dry eye in the house.

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:46.120
That's a powerful piece of music.

02:51:46.120 --> 02:51:47.120
It really is.

02:51:47.120 --> 02:51:52.480
Yeah, so I mean, that's the thing is that, you know, classical music is not just an era.

02:51:52.480 --> 02:51:55.620
People hear the term classical and think, oh, it's just Bach.

02:51:55.620 --> 02:51:58.560
It's just, you know, it's just Mozart.

02:51:58.560 --> 02:52:06.120
All right, Bobby, before we let you go, we can't keep this going all night because we

02:52:06.120 --> 02:52:07.120
probably could.

02:52:07.120 --> 02:52:09.560
But before we let you go, I gotta put you on the spot too.

02:52:09.560 --> 02:52:14.960
What is your favorite video game music of all time, or at least one of them?

02:52:14.960 --> 02:52:16.960
I should have thought about this before I called in.

02:52:16.960 --> 02:52:22.720
You know, you might not have heard us ask deafness because I was trying to speed dial

02:52:22.720 --> 02:52:23.720
in.

02:52:23.720 --> 02:52:24.720
That's all right.

02:52:24.720 --> 02:52:25.720
Because we asked him too.

02:52:25.720 --> 02:52:28.180
What was your one of your favorites?

02:52:28.180 --> 02:52:29.180
You know what?

02:52:29.180 --> 02:52:32.640
I mean, and it's going to sound kind of because we've been talking about it because I mean,

02:52:32.640 --> 02:52:39.440
I've kind of and the reason I'm kind of prepping this up is because one of the 21st century

02:52:39.440 --> 02:52:42.440
orchestra is what we call ourselves because we don't like the term new age.

02:52:42.440 --> 02:52:47.360
We've been kicking around a video game concert idea because we used to do movie stuff and

02:52:47.360 --> 02:52:51.840
we've been kicking around doing video game stuff and they've put me in charge of kind

02:52:51.840 --> 02:52:56.260
of, you know, putting in what we're going to what we would do in this hypothetical concert

02:52:56.260 --> 02:52:59.700
that's actually probably not going to happen for years now.

02:52:59.700 --> 02:53:03.920
And actually the one, the piece that would be the most emotional and the most gratifying

02:53:03.920 --> 02:53:08.820
to play and to be a part of is actually Aerith's Theme.

02:53:08.820 --> 02:53:15.760
The actual, specifically the More Friends version from the CD that's the fully orchestral

02:53:15.760 --> 02:53:17.760
and everything.

02:53:17.760 --> 02:53:20.880
That's actually the first time I shed a tear in a video game.

02:53:20.880 --> 02:53:21.880
Me too.

02:53:21.880 --> 02:53:22.880
No.

02:53:22.880 --> 02:53:27.680
And so it's very powerful from that aspect and the way it would be phrased in the concert

02:53:27.680 --> 02:53:33.040
is because I know that Square Enix doesn't let people use their footage in concerts that

02:53:33.040 --> 02:53:34.040
aren't their own.

02:53:34.040 --> 02:53:35.280
I know all about that.

02:53:35.280 --> 02:53:39.600
So it would be kind of phrased around, can a video game make you cry?

02:53:39.600 --> 02:53:43.520
And basically, you know, we'd be showing like fan art and stuff of Aerith's and of that

02:53:43.520 --> 02:53:48.320
scene with that piece and that was going to be kind of the emotional high point of this

02:53:48.320 --> 02:53:49.920
theoretical concert.

02:53:49.920 --> 02:53:54.360
So I'm really going to go with Aerith's Theme just because of what it means.

02:53:54.360 --> 02:53:58.540
I don't blame you one bit just because it's, there's a reason why it's newsworthy right

02:53:58.540 --> 02:53:59.540
now.

02:53:59.540 --> 02:54:00.540
Absolutely.

02:54:00.540 --> 02:54:06.240
All right, well Bobby, quick, plug your stuff before we let you go.

02:54:06.240 --> 02:54:08.280
Contrary to popular belief, I do not hate Act Deft.

02:54:08.280 --> 02:54:13.800
So if you want to listen to somebody who does not actually hate Act Deft, I'm on, before

02:54:13.800 --> 02:54:18.000
you guys at 8 p.m. Eastern, 5 p.m. Pacific, you're on All Games Radio and the last 10

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:22.240
minutes of my show were actually me, you know, fucking around with OLR.

02:54:22.240 --> 02:54:23.240
So it's a good time.

02:54:23.240 --> 02:54:26.400
Oh, you can say the F word on our show.

02:54:26.400 --> 02:54:27.400
You get to swear.

02:54:27.400 --> 02:54:29.880
It's a side of Bobby you don't normally get to see.

02:54:29.880 --> 02:54:32.820
I'm sorry I said bitch on your show.

02:54:32.820 --> 02:54:33.820
That's okay.

02:54:33.820 --> 02:54:34.820
It's okay.

02:54:34.820 --> 02:54:37.080
You will get the podcast up again soon, right Bobby?

02:54:37.080 --> 02:54:38.080
I hope so, yeah.

02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:39.080
We miss him.

02:54:39.080 --> 02:54:40.080
All right.

02:54:40.080 --> 02:54:41.080
All right.

02:54:41.080 --> 02:54:42.080
Bobby Black Wolf, everybody.

02:54:42.080 --> 02:54:43.080
Thank you so much for calling in.

02:54:43.080 --> 02:54:44.080
Have a good one.

02:54:44.080 --> 02:54:45.080
Capcom fires you.

02:54:45.080 --> 02:54:46.080
You're fired too.

02:54:46.080 --> 02:54:48.760
No, hire, hire.

02:54:48.760 --> 02:54:49.760
Need to hire.

02:54:49.760 --> 02:54:50.760
You're fired.

02:54:50.760 --> 02:54:51.760
All right.

02:54:51.760 --> 02:54:53.840
Anyhow, all right, we got to wrap it up.

02:54:53.840 --> 02:54:57.960
I know there's some folks that wanted to call and get through, but guys, we have an important

02:54:57.960 --> 02:54:59.160
live thing happening tonight.

02:54:59.160 --> 02:55:01.120
We got to get to it before it's like one in the morning.

02:55:01.120 --> 02:55:02.920
So I got to close up the Skype line.

02:55:02.920 --> 02:55:07.600
If you didn't get through, tweet us, email us, yell at us in all caps and chat.

02:55:07.600 --> 02:55:08.600
No, don't do that.

02:55:08.600 --> 02:55:10.400
But you know ways to get in touch with us.

02:55:10.400 --> 02:55:11.400
Please do.

02:55:11.400 --> 02:55:14.240
We want to know your thoughts and we'll share them next week on the show.

02:55:14.240 --> 02:55:16.520
In the meantime, we've got to wrap things up quickly.

02:55:16.520 --> 02:55:18.480
One more tweet here from Tiger Claw.

02:55:18.480 --> 02:55:21.520
Quickly, quickly read this.

02:55:21.520 --> 02:55:28.440
Robota Vengeance pits robots against genetically modified dinosaurs.

02:55:28.440 --> 02:55:32.840
It was actually created by an Academy Award winner, Doug Chang.

02:55:32.840 --> 02:55:35.600
He was the lead designer on Star Wars episode one and two.

02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:39.160
We'll say what you will about those movies, but at least the special effects were really

02:55:39.160 --> 02:55:40.720
good for their time.

02:55:40.720 --> 02:55:46.120
They want to do it as an iOS game that's a full scale rival to Infinity Blade.

02:55:46.120 --> 02:55:47.120
I guess.

02:55:47.120 --> 02:55:48.120
Oh, here's the deal.

02:55:48.120 --> 02:55:49.120
Here it is.

02:55:49.120 --> 02:55:50.120
It's another Kickstarter.

02:55:50.120 --> 02:55:52.080
They're trying to raise $100,000 to get Robota.

02:55:52.080 --> 02:55:53.440
Oh, boy.

02:55:53.440 --> 02:55:56.240
See, what did I say last week?

02:55:56.240 --> 02:55:58.720
Nora's box has been opened.

02:55:58.720 --> 02:56:01.840
This is going to be interesting, but I will say it does sound pretty cool.

02:56:01.840 --> 02:56:02.840
The little concept.

02:56:02.840 --> 02:56:09.120
Pre-order your game now by securing your vested share in the development of this game.

02:56:09.120 --> 02:56:10.680
That's how it's going to be.

02:56:10.680 --> 02:56:12.080
All right.

02:56:12.080 --> 02:56:14.960
That's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio, but we could not end

02:56:14.960 --> 02:56:19.360
the show if we don't go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:56:19.360 --> 02:56:20.760
Dark Sakura, we'll start with you.

02:56:20.760 --> 02:56:21.760
Your final thought tonight.

02:56:21.760 --> 02:56:23.160
I'm going to read a quote from Buddha.

02:56:23.160 --> 02:56:24.160
Please do.

02:56:24.160 --> 02:56:28.120
Give nothing no matter where you read it or who has said it, not even if I have said it

02:56:28.120 --> 02:56:33.880
unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense.

02:56:33.880 --> 02:56:34.880
How deep.

02:56:34.880 --> 02:56:36.200
Loki, your final thought.

02:56:36.200 --> 02:56:37.200
I hate Myspace.

02:56:37.200 --> 02:56:40.040
But they've got a million new users.

02:56:40.040 --> 02:56:41.040
It's noteworthy.

02:56:41.040 --> 02:56:46.720
Dude, I went back to my page because I was looking through some of the songs I had uploaded

02:56:46.720 --> 02:56:50.280
there, and you can't download them anymore even though I had it before where you could

02:56:50.280 --> 02:56:53.280
download them for free because they don't want to give anything away for free.

02:56:53.280 --> 02:56:57.840
You can share it on your blogs and bullshit like that, and then it pulls up like, hey,

02:56:57.840 --> 02:57:02.200
I know you want to listen to your music, but how about some shit from somebody else?

02:57:02.200 --> 02:57:03.280
No.

02:57:03.280 --> 02:57:06.160
You're not fucking Pandora.

02:57:06.160 --> 02:57:07.800
Although maybe you are Pandora.

02:57:07.800 --> 02:57:10.520
Hey, they got to buy it off somebody who's making money.

02:57:10.520 --> 02:57:11.520
All right.

02:57:11.520 --> 02:57:33.120
My final thought of the day, everybody, is listen to O-L-R. It's on right after bopping.

02:57:33.120 --> 02:57:37.720
If you enjoyed what you hear or to hear at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend

02:57:37.720 --> 02:57:38.720
about the show.

02:57:38.720 --> 02:57:40.400
Word of mouth is how we get the word out.

02:57:40.400 --> 02:57:44.080
We don't have a million dollar magazine behind us or website or any of that stuff.

02:57:44.080 --> 02:57:45.480
It's all about word of mouth.

02:57:45.480 --> 02:57:47.200
Help the O-L Army grow.

02:57:47.200 --> 02:57:49.040
Play Terraria with each other.

02:57:49.040 --> 02:57:50.040
Don't be a dick.

02:57:50.040 --> 02:57:51.040
We'll see you next week.

02:57:51.040 --> 02:57:53.040
Have a wonderful, wonderful night.

02:57:53.040 --> 02:57:57.000
