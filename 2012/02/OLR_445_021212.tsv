61720	66400	actually a little sore you're a little sore in the hand oh in the handle region
66400	72800	well you've had the rain and I spent the last three days typing a renaming files
72800	76760	for the American River review we got we did our art submissions and I submitted
76760	81080	five pieces which this is like you know you're you're you are one of the stars
81080	86360	of NBC's community in a sense you're going to community college and you're on
86360	92320	yearbook right or what this I'll put it this way this makes a yearbook look like
92320	96560	a fanzine in comparison I was in your book in high school but I'm doing have
96560	101520	your books in high school yes oh by the way over there tech master Loki how are
101520	104840	you Loki they have your books in high school yes they did or not high school
104840	111200	out of college sure they could they did because my parents met at a Modesto
111200	114840	junior college I'll say it and they there was a yearbook yeah of course they
114840	118400	have your books in high school I I I was in yearbook at high school because it's
118400	121760	okay wait we got to go back to our Sakura story we derailed the magazine
121760	125280	basically it showcases all of the art the culinary the fashion that gets put
125280	130600	out through American River College and we win lots of big national awards we
130600	133920	beat out four year schools we beat out dedicated art schools and we beat
133920	138480	Harvard one year and you won the humility award apparently well now I'm
138480	141400	just really proud we put a lot of hard work on it and it's something to be
141400	146240	proud of fair enough but this is my last year being able to not for art selection
146240	149520	but it's my last year that I'm gonna be working on the design team so and no
149520	153520	time for games I've played some games someday though someday though you could
153520	158880	totally do designing for instruction manuals or you know I was at best I've
158880	162600	been applying for those types of jobs well I know I don't know how much I
162600	165560	should say it say on air but there's that company just down the road that
165560	170440	makes those strategy guides and I was just at Best Buy the other day and I was
170440	174360	really admiring there was a collector's strategy guide for Final Fantasy 13 to
174360	178560	I'm not usually the type to get strategy guides because you know you can kind of
178560	182960	get it all on game facts but I gotta say if you're a really big fan of a game
182960	186520	there's just some beautiful art and design in a lot of those books like
186520	190920	they're just they're they're good coffee table books for nerds I mean in this one
190920	194320	I was looking at with the collector's edition had like that that big thick
194320	199480	kind of pillowy cover almost to it I mean it was not your stand lost books I
199480	202040	guess I don't know what the technical name is for it but it was like you know
202040	205400	it was like the type that if you threw it on the ground it wouldn't leave any
205400	211440	marks because it's like push so they those are done with actually I think
211440	217160	foam and embossing mm-hmm so yeah I mean the thing is maybe I should save this
217160	221680	for my F use but I'll go ahead and say it right now the problem with a lot of
221680	225120	places that hire designers is they want you to have a four-year degree and it
225120	228880	doesn't matter really how much experience real-life experience you have
228880	234840	and just have an associates hmm it's stupid I've got tons of experience and
234840	239300	they knew in a four-year degree man I'm like well tell them to reduce the
239300	243280	tuition please do you know that I used to do design work before I worked at my
243280	246980	current company which I've been at for ten years this is a long time ago when I
246980	255860	was 21 22 I work excuse me I worked for a truck drivers magazine and I was just
255860	259280	kind of the dude in the office like we all worked at the publishers office it
259280	262700	was it was a great staff was a very small office seven people and I was more
262700	265400	like I guess you could say kind of an administrative assistant to the
265400	269120	publisher sort of but I really did a lot of just different stuff I helped with
269120	272680	subscriptions and one role I ended up taking on when one of the gals left I
272680	277360	started designing trade ads for the magazine so I mean that's something I
277360	283280	didn't I just fell into it it was weird and I'm not like I had yearbook and in
283280	287080	high school but let's be real that's I there's a lot more to it that I'm not up
287080	290520	and up on but that's just how the way the the market is right now yeah it's
290520	297120	it's crazy and I you know I I would have no problem finishing my four-year degree
297120	301300	if tuition was not so stupidly high and now you all know a little fact about me
301300	305500	yes it's true I used to work for a truck drivers magazine so but it's I don't
305500	309220	know if it's still around I think it is but anyway I got laid off because you
309220	312960	know not a lot of truck drivers read magazines they all listen to satellite
312960	318820	radio but anyhow let's move on video games techmaster Loki how are you these
318820	323980	days fine I gotta say this one of the popular games like to play here at olr
323980	327160	before we get into the game talk is what did Loki bring to the show tonight and
327160	332360	Loki brought with him Jack in the Box and one of the now Jack in the Box they
332360	337480	have almost everywhere in the u.s. right but not not in the Northeast I think they
337480	340180	don't have it that's weird yeah it's weird they don't have it like cuz I know
340180	342800	friends that live up in like Connecticut and stuff and when they come out here
342800	346760	they're like we got to go to Jack in the Box oh my god it's kind of like it's
346760	349920	kind of like me and Dunkin Donuts cuz we don't have Dunkin Donuts here in
349920	360680	California or Krispy Kreme coffee we do have a Krispy Kreme in Roseville yeah they're still yeah there's a Krispy Kreme where somewhere
360680	364360	there's one in Stockton too yeah but where's Roseville where in Roseville
364360	370240	though cuz I can swing out that way let me Google that for you anyhow Jack in
370240	374320	the Box right now they have the bacon milkshakes right now I don't know why I'm
374320	377480	giving them free advertising but whatever it's not on their menu probably
377480	381080	for good reason well okay I got to say when Loki came in and said I got a bacon
381080	384760	milkshake I'm like alright I have to try it that's why I brought it it's like try
384760	389160	that was so fucking repulsive I can't oh my god that was terrible I was I didn't
389160	394560	hate it and she's the Jewish one it's not real bacon that's right it's just
394560	401520	tastes like it just tastes like hickory and vanilla it did taste a little bit
401520	406000	like the cheeses that they have out at the mall with the Swiss ladies at
406000	409680	Christmastime was that the hickory farms hickory farms at it it did taste a
409680	414480	little bit like like smoked vanilla they made a bacon cheddar milkshake that might
414480	421080	be pretty good all right you know what though that has inspired me that you
421080	426680	know make my own bacon milkshake because this is it's the careful the grease and
426680	431600	milk don't hurdle Eric RPG says I want to go to a psycho donuts I've never heard
431600	435840	of that I wonder if that's like if you live in Portland there's a great place
435840	438600	called voodoo don't you surely you already know at this place it's legendary
438600	443000	up there but voodoo donuts which I had when I was up in Portland and that's
443000	446200	where you can get the donuts that look like penises and you can also get the
446200	452920	bacon maple bars Loki I've seen that on a I know actually no I've seen in that
452920	459800	and and no it wasn't that it was a what the hell it man versus food I saw it on
459800	464560	there all right video do weddings there to video games I want to want to get
464560	468800	into this off the top of the show Loki you sent out a tweet this week you are
468800	473320	parting with one of your video game systems what's going on I just don't
473320	481360	play my 3ds so I want to get rid of it and really it came down to just I'm was
481360	487880	thinking okay Vita or the 3ds you know normally I would get both but I don't
487880	493920	play my 3ds that often so I was like okay what titles coming you know soon or
493920	497600	this year or that have been announced or potentially would be announced that I
497600	501560	would be looking forward to on the 3ds
501840	507800	kid Icarus maybe another Mario title or a paper Mario or something like that
507800	511600	confirm a 2d Mario right yeah there well there's one learn another 2d Marba I
511600	515160	don't really care and then there's like maybe a paper Mario or something like
515160	519400	that but it's just it's a few and far between it's you know I picked up Mario
519400	524240	Kart and I picked up the Super Mario 3 land and I played a lot of Mario Kart I
524240	530320	didn't really play much of Super Mario 3 land but be tween those I hadn't picked
530320	536520	up anything says launch I mean it's a good you know nine months span basically
536520	542840	between games and and honestly the next thing I'd probably pick up would be kid
542840	548240	Icarus which is in March and beyond that yeah I mean this is not a whole lot
548240	552560	whereas the Vita I mean they're porting everything to that there's gonna be a
552560	556120	Call of Duty on that there's gonna be probably the grand theft next grant the
556120	560040	thought it will be on that I would not be surprised and just I think there's a
560040	565080	lot more games on there that I would probably play versus my 3ds and be
565080	570240	honest I mean the 3ds it's kind of a letdown a little bit because it's just a
570240	576080	DS more or less I mean with some 3d graphics that are just kind of like yeah
576080	580960	that's kind of neat but would you think about I mean one I see I'm not quite on
580960	584880	the same side issue but I'm also in a situation right now where financially I
584880	589120	could get the V because I just did taxes and I had a huge tax refund so I could
589120	592080	get the Vita without having to part with my 3ds and I can juggle them both I'm
592080	595360	not gonna feel like I'm losing something to gain something else but the more I
595360	599120	think about it from your perspective if you do sell your 3ds it's not like you
599120	603240	couldn't buy one later and they'll probably have the read is the inevitable
603240	608240	redesign that includes that second d-pad and we all know there's going to be some
608240	612200	redesign in the future I know that's Alan's thing you know he doesn't want to
612200	615440	get a 3ds until the end there there will be there's absolutely going to be a
615440	620040	redesigned 3ds at some point and and that's not even really a big deal for me
620040	623520	either because it's it's just like even the next console generation I was kind
623520	627120	of thinking about it and it's like I'm not gonna I don't think I'm gonna buy
627120	631440	all three again you know it was kind of cool with the Wii is like oh I got to
631440	635000	try that out because you know that is a completely different type of way to play
635000	639560	games and the ps3 I honestly wouldn't have picked up at all but I got one for
639560	645000	free so you know I'm not gonna complain there and and really I didn't play too
645000	649160	much of my I've played a few games on the ps3 but not a whole lot and I still
649160	655640	don't I hardly ever use it for blu-rays I use it for streaming movies but I mean
655640	660240	I could do that with my Xbox too I play a lot more Xbox but so interesting
660240	663720	because I'm the exact opposite ever since the hacking like I don't know what
663720	668480	it is but like I don't touch my xbox 360 unless it's specifically for something I
668480	671840	can only play on 360 which lately is connect games rhythm party I talked
671840	676120	about last week I'm really into I played that like every day this past week but
676120	680080	otherwise the multi console stuff has been all ps3 for me like 13 to have been
680080	687080	playing on the ps3 you know I just don't know if I will mainly it was before it
687080	693280	was going to be that it was money was going to be the issue where I just wanted
693280	699320	to be didn't even then I really want to be there I mean but yeah I do because
699320	703200	there's actually some games on there that I'd like to try out I'm going to go
703200	707760	crazy and buy like a bunch of launch games like I did you know with you know
707760	716920	the 3DS crazy there but I mean it's just that's kind of why I'm going that way
716920	721240	it's just I don't have a lot of I mean I don't play Kingdom Hearts so because
721240	725760	otherwise Kingdom Hearts is probably a big draw for me for the 3ds I guess but
725760	732400	you know they don't have a date for that yet it's still some time is here I don't
732400	735680	know I just think there's gonna be a lot of stuff that in that system seems like
735680	741200	such a step up versus the DS and the 3ds ds and 3ds I mean they're much the same
741200	747760	I mean the graphics dsi you know and even the 3ds in some regards is a step
747760	752320	backwards I mean I'm still team 3ds I really like my 3ds I'm not gonna part
752320	756840	with it but I will say those dsi XL's I mean when Alan got one of those those
756840	761200	screens are gigantic I love it like it's that's the best way to play DS games
761200	765360	right now I wish the 3ds screens were that big but I guess they have to save
765360	769000	that for the reason something I don't know well maybe it's more expensive
769000	773960	because of the technology and those screens I don't know it's a 3ds tablet
773960	779960	oh wait that's just a Wii U controller oh yeah all right Vida yeah have you
779960	783320	gotten your hands on a Vida yet I finally played one yesterday no I have
783320	788080	done I played one at GameStop yesterday which I know yes I walked into a
788080	791760	GameStop and I didn't instantly turn to ash but in my defense I was at the mall
791760	796360	and we were shopping at some other stores and so we were walking right by
796360	799520	and I was like oh there's the Vita right there on the wall damn it let's go in
799520	803360	and take a look so I did get my hands on the Vita a little bit and I gotta say I
803360	808560	first thing I noticed right away damn that screen is big like for a handheld
808560	812680	like that you know it's more like regular TV proportions and I was kind of
812680	817680	okay that's that's kind of neat like the analog sticks are tiny though that's
817680	822080	that was interesting and they're not thank God they're not like that little
822080	825840	nub that's on the PSP that would like hurt my thumb after using it for so long
825840	830480	like yeah how was that thing they're like little tiny tiny little nubs tiny
830480	835920	little PS nipples that you can use to you know for whatever but then it's like
835920	839800	I'm standing there like an idiot like how do I start the damn game I can't and
839800	843760	then I remembered oh yeah this thing has a touchscreen I have to touch the screen
843760	850440	to get it to do anything but I played um oh what is it the mod nation racers and
850440	856520	I played wipeout 2048 or whatever the wipeout game is it's on the Vita and
856520	861160	yeah I mean it's it's gorgeous looking the graphics you know when they say it
861160	866280	looks like a PlayStation 3 yeah I can kind of see that I mean you know again
866280	869440	it's it's a little bit of bait-and-switch because yeah it's really
869440	874200	high resolution but on a lower resolution monitor but for handhelds it
874200	877880	is it is pretty gorgeous looking I'm still kind of on the fence on if I want
877880	881640	one or not and funny enough it's it's kind of what's troubling Loki and that
881640	885440	is the games but Loki I got to say you do make a good point most of the big
885440	889240	franchises will probably inevitably come over at some point I know I want that
889240	892880	Final Fantasy 10 thing that they're gonna do down the line I absolutely like
892880	896280	if I were to buy the Vita at launch I'm getting that luminous game absolutely
896280	899880	hasn't yet but song list and everything and you know I always have this fanboy
899880	905120	boner for Q entertainment you know it was speaking it just I didn't decide
905120	910600	I was kind of ironic and funny Ridge racers no longer a launch title I wonder
910600	914640	if it didn't sell very well at all in Japan and they went back to fix it and
914640	918560	add tracks let's hope but didn't Ninja Gaiden get bumped up like there was kind
918560	922720	of a no it's just that the news is too they're they're behind in getting
922720	927240	release dates and stuff like that so it's been launched for a while it does
927240	930160	kind of concern me a little bit too that there's a lot about the Vita that's
930160	934320	still kind of a question mark even though the damn things out in Japan and
934320	937560	there's a lot of stuff that ought to be there that's not and I gotta admit one
937560	941000	of the things I know a lot of people are like well if you want to just go play
941000	945840	your PSP or go hook up your PlayStation 1 the ps1 games not playing on the
945840	952760	PlayStation Vita I mean why not I don't understand why that doesn't work if that
952760	956760	thing is supposed to be as powerful as a PlayStation 3 why can't it successfully
956760	960520	emulate the PlayStation 1 games I'm sure there's a highly technical answer but
960520	964960	from a consumer standpoint I'm like damn it I bought like Final Fantasy I would
964960	968920	like to play that I've got the emulator to work because they still have full
968920	972880	backwards compatibility with the PlayStation portable stuff and they are
972880	976760	working on that right it's me when Sony's like implementing all these
976760	979960	features as they go but then there's a part of you that watches what happened
979960	985080	with Microsoft because remember when the Xbox first came out it was like these
985080	990360	handful of titles will be emulatable from the original Xbox and they slowly
990360	993840	added more and more to that list and they said we're not gonna stop till
993840	998040	they're all emulatable and they stopped about a year you're into it and you
998040	1002080	still can't play the old DDR ultimate games on 360 at the same time at least
1002080	1005320	they're not shipping that system saying oh hey look internet browser Oh
1005320	1012000	internet browser coming in the future you know patch what yeah I guess okay
1012000	1014560	Nintendo's guilty of the same thing hey look you're right I want to buy a game
1014560	1020600	oops sorry store coming in a future patch all right here I always the second
1020600	1025000	analog see you know that March release day for whatever reason or April what
1025000	1028200	what the hell month did it come out March March all right they sure were
1028200	1032760	married to that date oh yeah the because of the quarter quarter earnings are
1032760	1037800	you're yeah so I mean I get maybe it's the same thing with Sony I mean yeah
1037800	1041800	it's February but it's you know still maybe that's part of the reason why they
1041800	1048040	got to get it out now oh well I'm sure I'll end up getting one inevitably
1048040	1052400	because I really do want that luminous game I really want it and then when the
1052400	1057160	Final Fantasy 10 thing comes out I'm gonna be like I want that too so well
1057160	1060360	and just looking at like some of the other stuff like little big planet on it
1060360	1065920	I'm not you know I don't play enough of little big planet on the ps3 but just
1065920	1071160	showing how easy it is to make stuff using that touchscreen just like okay I
1071160	1075320	want to make a hill and I want to adjust it oh and I'm gonna pinch it to make it
1075320	1078800	a little bit smaller and I'm gonna rotate it and I'm just gonna poke at
1078800	1083280	this stuff and everything works perfectly fine it I mean it's awesome
1083280	1091800	it's just so easy to make stuff with so I'm kind of looking for that spin-offs
1091800	1094560	that they're gonna have let's go to our chat room we always love to be joined by
1094560	1098800	the chat room chat that orange lounge radio calm some comments in the chat
1098800	1104000	room let's see a suka and our chat room says Vita is worthwhile at launch only
1104000	1110000	if you don't own a PSP see I do oh yeah I do own a PSP yet I'm still kind of
1110000	1113720	like and what of one is the other thing too though and I don't know if you've
1113720	1118360	done this yet you remember back when they gave you those free PlayStation
1118360	1125740	Network games and the free PSP games as part of the reparations for you know the
1125740	1129680	network being down for a while I haven't used those PSP games so I actually have
1129680	1136200	ModNation racers waiting for me as soon as I you know get my Vita more comments
1136200	1141160	in our chat room at chat.org.com ahamkara says no HDMI port on the Vita
1141160	1145360	well that's kind of ass what if you want to play your Vita stuff on the TV who
1145360	1151240	cares me I like cooking up the PSP to the TV yeah but who cares you know why
1151240	1155760	because first off who's to say that you're not going to be able to stream
1155760	1160120	that stuff from your Vita to your TV in the first place and whoever fucking uses
1160120	1164920	stupid cable so you actually use the cables hook up to your TV you like being
1164920	1169320	tethered six feet away from your TV was that fun I mean because I actually okay
1169320	1174000	hold on hold on smarty pants when I'm in the bedroom on the TV in there and I'm
1174000	1178240	kind of lying on the bed that six-foot tether is just enough where yes I can
1178240	1183940	lie in bed and play Final Fantasy 4 and have a fat day where I am fat and I am
1183940	1189040	playing PSP in bed on my TV I mean the only one that was actually that would
1189040	1193000	make sense doing that would have been like the PSP go where it actually had
1193000	1198880	you know DualShock 3 Bluetooth support which hey there you go Bluetooth support
1198880	1203440	you know you could maybe do something like that later on but I don't care I've
1203440	1206760	got a big screen in front of me why do I need to hook it up to my TV to have some
1206760	1212720	weird resolution on there I just don't need that if I want to play on my TV I'll
1212720	1217120	use my PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 spazz nator in our chat room says I don't want
1217120	1220160	to get a Vita due to the shit I've gone through with my PlayStation 3 and my
1220160	1224920	digital downloaded videos you know history can burn you and I you know I
1224920	1228120	know spazz nators called into the show before to talk about his his trials and
1228120	1231680	tribulations and I gotta say yeah I can see where he's coming from because it's
1231680	1236120	it's me and Microsoft right now I feel very apprehensive with like I don't want
1236120	1242800	to buy things on Xbox because my wallet will be you know stolen from yet again
1242800	1246360	I'm feeling a little weird about all that stuff whereas I'm sure some people
1246360	1249320	are like Rob you're irrational I don't buy a lot of digital content so it
1249320	1254040	doesn't matter to me I mean especially since they're like hey you get 10% off
1254040	1257400	maybe that's if we decide to discount it because uncharted it's not fucking
1257400	1262840	discounted or at least it wasn't it might be discounted now but still 10% all
1262840	1272160	right let's uh let's move on so Vida so Vida yes for you launch day um hopefully
1272160	1278520	Vida is strong like leaning towards yes but I'm really gonna wait for that first
1278520	1282200	week release thing that's Valentine's Day or whatever and see what the
1282200	1286160	feedback is on that dark soccer I'm pretty sure you said you're a no just
1286160	1292280	due to personal situations but any interest in Vita I want an iPad just
1292280	1295280	wait for an iPad three or whatever they're gonna announce one at the
1295280	1298560	beginning that's true yeah iPad 3 will be all HD and pretty I want one of those
1298560	1304320	two honestly I don't really give a shit about the Vida anymore why is that I
1304320	1309200	mean it would be nice to have one and I'm sure Dan wants to get one yeah are
1309200	1311960	you psyching yourself out of your like I don't want a Vida
1311960	1316080	Vida's are shit because I can't afford it no you know I'm saying I'm saying
1316080	1323880	this I really I'm still playing games on my DS and I can't play for very long
1323880	1329840	before I start to hurt so it's sort of like I play with anything that I want to
1329840	1337720	on my phone I only have to use my thumbs and bust to move is all I need bust to
1337720	1341640	move is all I need all right fair enough let's move on we're gonna talk about our

1415900	1418680	what's new with you in the world of Warcraft what are you been like your
1418680	1425280	goals lately holo dailies that's pretty much it I want pink flamingo it's running
1425280	1431920	around I go look at my pink flamingo and I'm playing my troll who cries in
1431920	1439800	size all the time and I have another horrid tune on Ravencrest to play with
1439800	1444840	other people good times but by the way Rob I did get the name today for the
1444840	1451520	death night alright be Whitney for you so just letting you know I I believe
1451520	1455480	grandpa war crafter as he goes by in our chat room salvellous would be proud
1455480	1460520	because he had what he had our IP Steve Jobs I have our IP Betty white just
1460520	1467240	waiting and I think he rolled he rolled another one when somebody passed away
1467240	1472400	recently I remember who was I'm actually because my one that's on the main server
1472400	1478280	I'm gonna be I'm learning how to tank on that one but this one other ones just
1478280	1483120	gonna be a DPS for lol so I can go in and go haha I begin some emails about a
1483120	1486880	Star Trek online and how they've added some new stuff and have really kind of
1486880	1489240	got behind the free-to-play stuff you've been able to check that out since when
1489240	1493280	FTP um well I haven't checked out the very new stuff I've seen some they they
1493280	1497480	have a really a lot easier way now to get some of the different costumes and
1497480	1501040	goodies and if you've got the cryptic points for it you actually just will
1501040	1504560	select it on the menu with all the rest of everything like if you're changing
1504560	1508120	your outfit and you want a certain piece of an outfit you can just select that
1508120	1512800	piece and pay your points then so I'm probably gonna be getting some cryptic
1512800	1516960	points in the next couple of weeks and really giving it a go because I miss
1516960	1522200	playing with my Scottish buddies but I still love us yo I went around and they
1522200	1527000	fixed a bunch of stuff on DS DS 9 Oh Deep Space 9 is in the game you can
1527000	1529880	actually now go in the office it's been in the game you did there were just
1529880	1534200	parts that were closed off now you can actually go you know in the commander's
1534200	1540400	office and the baseball is sitting there Cisco's baseball because you know he is
1540400	1547000	awesome tastic all right so I've had school and all this other stuff on my
1547000	1552000	plate so I still haven't sent out the game so sorry and we were gonna pick up
1552000	1558800	our lazy I know busy we're gonna pick up our duo today but we just didn't get by
1558800	1563800	there we had we were gonna go by Dan's mom's house but she had to go somewhere
1563800	1569120	else so we didn't get a chance to all right let's go to Loki tech master Loki
1569120	1573320	how was your gaming week I didn't play much I was writing for tutorials this
1573320	1580800	weekend I played very little bit of Skyrim I remember what I did in there
1580800	1586680	but something in Skyrim related I think it was oh yeah I checked out patch 1 4
1586680	1592680	which sadly to say even though it promised to fix the quest it did not
1592680	1597120	fix the quest I think the quest is too dead for me did they push out the
1597120	1602400	console finally yes it's a console now it was supposed to fix the fire on the
1602400	1612280	ice bro no not firing yes blood on the ice quest and I didn't none of mine it's
1612280	1620960	impossible so me whatever um let's see then some other miscellaneous quests I
1620960	1628000	did I also played the cat that got the milk which was the free game I was
1628000	1633760	talking about the cat that got the milk calm and it's this weird it's like a
1633760	1640680	puzzle game and it gets all kind of artsy and it gets pretty hard actually
1640680	1647360	so it's fun for like a few minutes that's about how long the game is and
1647360	1655960	called you played more Call of Duty and I'm starting to try to teach myself now
1655960	1663160	pronating which is throwing grenades in really specific ways to get them to
1663160	1669480	bounce off shit and hit people very far away from you that's pretty much the
1669480	1674240	only area I could improve upon right now I'm really frustrated how that my
1674240	1679160	co-workers they they really don't like playing with me you're just too good
1679160	1683120	because I because because I will purposefully run up behind them and
1683120	1687920	stab them I have the opportunity that's not a nice or they'll be or they'll be
1687920	1690880	or they'll be standing there or something like that I'm like and I'll
1690880	1695440	sit behind them I'm like okay what's something funny that I could do to kill
1695440	1702320	them hmm something funny so like one of my co-workers is prone under this truck
1702320	1707240	like trying to snipe at people so I went prone to and I crawled up right behind
1707240	1711360	them and they started seeing my gun in their screen because you know I had
1711360	1716240	clipped past their camera no like what is that and then they turned and that
1716240	1722600	shot him in the face god damn it you're sitting there the whole time just kill
1722600	1727600	me I'm so hateful that at your work you can do this like you always just it
1727600	1731200	sounds like you work at a frat house for God's no it's just our 15-minute games
1731200	1735360	we get to 15 minutes and then they ask you know what I do on my 15-minute
1735360	1742720	breaks like a walk yeah I could do that but now where's the fun in that exactly
1742720	1748120	walking for nerds Call of Duty is where it's at well they the whole thing with
1748120	1752600	Call of Duty was we hate getting our asses kicked in Grand Theft Auto we're
1752600	1757600	gonna play Call of Duty because he's probably not good at that so humble so
1757600	1761840	humble I hey I didn't know I was gonna be good at it because honestly I played
1761840	1768760	Call of Duty for once before I'd actually played with them and so I was
1768760	1773560	kind of at the same spot that they were in fact I believe that my boss at least
1773560	1779480	had Call of Duty 4 already and he's been playing online for like a while now so
1779480	1783920	that's why he thought he had the advantage but apparently I'm really good
1783920	1791080	at that game I also read up on everything it's it's good to be educated
1791080	1794600	in what you're playing all right anything else for your gaming week that's
1794600	1797920	it all right my gaming week I get pretty short because I didn't play a lot of new
1797920	1801720	stuff I've been playing when I'm not playing World of Warcraft just like Dark
1801720	1808320	Sakura Final Fantasy 13 to haters stay pressed step off it's great I'm loving
1808320	1816040	Final Fantasy 13 to it's it's so I it's it's such a different story than the
1816040	1821080	last one and kind of the way they they they split it up it's really it's really
1821080	1825320	interesting that you go into one time and then you can go into a parallel
1825320	1830840	timeline that's the same thing with a different result it's interesting and I
1830840	1834880	have to correct one little thing I said in my review last week and that is that
1834880	1841640	you actually do get more than the two characters in your party but they're not
1841640	1846560	really controllable like it's kind of like this extra characters just standing
1846560	1849600	off to the side and kind of fighting with me although I don't really watch
1849600	1853600	their hit points or anything but I just didn't want to be you know corrected in
1853600	1856840	my review last week because I played a lot further into it now I did check out
1856840	1865240	some of the DLC you can download right now the lightning and oh her her guy in
1865240	1870400	charge of the squadron dude I can't remember his name you can play against
1870400	1874240	them and I guess if you're able to beat them you can use lightning as your
1874240	1878260	summon summonable monster in battle but I can't beat them yet because I'm too
1878260	1882880	low a level as I guess I haven't played far enough so I'm still working away at
1882880	1888080	it I finally got to the casino in Final Fantasy 13 too so it was you know kind
1888080	1890680	of fun to see some of the minigames they're bringing back chocobo racing I
1890680	1895160	heard that the case if was in the game as a suitable well it but it's not it's
1895160	1899320	not the Kate Sith it's not the guy in the big moogle that you remember from
1899320	1902960	Final Fantasy 7 but it's a monster called Kate Sith in fact it's probably
1902960	1906980	the first monster that you'll get and probably hang on to hang on to for a
1906980	1910240	long time because it's a healer and it's one of the few healer monsters you get
1910240	1915240	and plus is a kitty and in the little special attack he goes wow and then
1915240	1920120	eats claw claw claw claw claw it's really funny so yeah I'm liking Final
1920120	1923440	Fantasy 13 too and I'm definitely gonna play this to completion that's pretty
1923440	1926960	much where all my gaming hours have gone when I'm not playing Wow or something
1926960	1932800	else I will say I randomly had an urge to play bit trip runner yesterday and
1932800	1937800	try to get further in that game that's the one you know it plays like the chip
1937800	1941960	yeah I know it's hard as hell it's like an older game it's on Steam it's where I
1941960	1947520	play it on PC I think maybe I played cannibal this week cuz I remember
1947520	1955120	yeah don't start Skyrim you'll never finish it um let's see I'm looking in
1955120	1959800	our chat room at chat orange launch rated calm hey Stan Stan says me too
1959800	1964160	loves Final Fantasy 13 to the use of enemies is the third character reminds
1964160	1968600	me of Pokemon mixed with dog fights it's an interesting way to think of that
1968600	1973440	jester Scott says by the way you need lightning I would love to get lightning
1973440	1978400	but I can't beat beat her yet Eric RPG says actually sky it's a 10% drop even
1978400	1983640	at 5 star oh my god I was able to beat lightning and tell her little buddy
1983640	1987260	joined in the fight and then I got wasted so I just I just need to level
1987260	1991080	further and grind and all that those of you that missed grinding in Final
1991080	1995560	Fantasy those of you that bitched about Final Fantasy 13 it's too linear and
1995560	2000600	there's no grinding it's too easy well guess what you got your wish prayers
2000600	2008600	answered enjoy grind grind grind away otherwise gaming a little bit Mario Kart
2008600	2017480	7 that's really it so let's move on and talk about some housekeeping tonight we
2017480	2021400	actually have some really big news in housekeeping tonight we didn't want to
2021400	2025760	promote this a little bit because not everybody's gonna see this is good news
2025760	2029440	I wish dark soccer was in the room but she's in the restroom right now but
2029440	2033320	that's alright we'll we'll move on anyway she can say her piece afterwards
2033320	2037040	if she needs to but it's it's pretty straightforward this is more of a
2037040	2043120	programming note and it's gonna be kind of a shift in in orange lounge radio it
2043120	2048080	is not going to affect anybody that listens to the podcast at all but it
2048080	2052360	will affect the live listeners the announcement is that we are going to be
2052360	2056600	ending the orange launch radio after birth and it's gonna be ending next week
2056600	2061120	next week will be the final after birth that we're gonna do and it's gonna
2061120	2066280	involve the ultimate cage match and we'll tell you more about that next week
2066280	2073520	why we're doing it I think part of us kind of creatively the the after birth
2073520	2076720	which which if you only are a podcast listener you don't know what it is the
2076720	2080120	orange on radio after birth it's kind of like after we tape the show live for
2080120	2084000	about 20 minutes afterwards we'll usually just kind of sit around and chat
2084000	2087520	and then we do this segment called the cage match where we play three songs and
2087520	2091480	it's more of a indulgence for the live listeners and we do this fortune cookie
2091480	2095000	message of the day and all this stuff and the cage match is a segment that
2095000	2101760	dates back to episode 20 of this program so we're on episode 445 and the cage
2101760	2106360	match dates back to episode 20 so it's it's very old segment and it's something
2106360	2111440	we kind of wanted to keep even after we made the shift to all games radio some
2111440	2116640	years ago but creatively unfortunately I think the after birth has lost a lot of
2116640	2122320	steam those of us here that hosts the show kind of feel like we got a we got
2122320	2126240	to get our cage match song we're stuck in the studio for another 20 minutes and
2126240	2129960	you know it's kind of it's kind of become this necessary thing we have to
2129960	2135280	do every week so and you know when creatively something's not working you
2135280	2139320	say okay we're gonna change it so that's what we're gonna do we're gonna change
2139320	2144160	it so we've decided to and the orange ones radio after birth and next week we
2144160	2146960	are gonna be saying goodbye to the cage match which has been a part of our show
2146960	2152800	for the past 425 weeks give or take a few so you know I realize our live
2152800	2156480	listeners may see this as oh well you don't care about your live audience
2156480	2160800	anymore hey that no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no it's not about
2160800	2167520	that at all think of it this way by doing that and ending the cage match it
2167520	2172280	opens the door for other possibilities and things we could better spend our
2172280	2177520	time with once this show is over more information on that in the coming weeks
2177520	2181200	but for now we hope our live listeners will understand this creative decision
2181200	2186800	and this longtime segment of our show that you know podcast listeners weren't
2186800	2192560	even hearing anyway so all right Kai's you know in chat says I'm gonna read
2192560	2196160	these Kai's you know in chat says just saying you guys are getting lazy after
2196160	2200520	birth is good times I think that comments a little bit unfair because you
2200520	2204640	know it's not a lazy thing to be doing a show for the past 10 years every week
2204640	2213120	but I think too you have to wait to see what the future holds I think we'll
2213120	2218000	prove you wrong hit stun says I think we need an official post show turntable FM
2218000	2222360	party I'd be in support of that I I have not logged on to turntable in quite some
2222360	2227600	time and I love the iPhone app and all that and I am totally in support of that
2227600	2233320	ahamkara in chat says play games after the show and stream it I've been
2233320	2237200	thinking about that as like a side project the whole twitch TV thing and
2237200	2245240	all that good times all right anyone want to chime in on this whole thing I
2245240	2251360	think I said my piece in the chat room but I'll say it aloud fuck you we do
2251360	2256360	this for free we do this as a service and we keep trying to think of new
2256360	2259880	things to make things even better so if we're getting rid of something we're
2259880	2264200	doing it for a very good reason not just because we don't feel like doing it so
2264200	2268680	fuck off but I can see well that's a strong reaction but I can see where the
2268680	2271240	strong reaction comes from in chat too is that you know we've been doing this
2271240	2278600	so long and then we're saying goodbye to it and it's like but wait why that's
2278600	2285400	well that's my initial reaction to uh just an accusation of overt laziness no
2285400	2290520	yeah and on top of that I mean Rob has a full-time job Loki has a full-time job I
2290520	2297200	go to school you know we give up our Sundays for you guys so there's nothing
2297200	2302040	I think wrong at all for us you know trying to think of something new some
2302040	2307200	way to innovate because nothing ever grows without a challenge and without
2307200	2313200	making small changes to it to make it grow so so just but there are no there
2313200	2316560	are some people in our chat that are like Brad from pop culture says
2316560	2322560	understandable and let's see Tiger Claw says so there won't be a post show of
2322560	2329680	any kind I didn't say that let's see active says nobody but one person is
2329680	2334000	complaining so you know I think I think for the most part people get it that
2334000	2336840	creatively sometimes you we don't not ending the show we're not ending the
2336840	2340880	show so don't know about that and there is there is something else coming yeah
2340880	2346720	so just deal with it all right I mean to be honest we don't have to do the show I
2346720	2351920	mean really but we do in the show we like doing the show in the show it free
2351920	2357200	up a lot of Skyrim time you know I've got design work that I'm being paid for
2357200	2362160	that I could be doing tonight but you know what I'm here doing the show all
2362160	2366120	right no worries guys all right let's move on and talk about something a
2366120	2370800	little more in gaming and we're gonna start with Loki with the video game news
2370800	2375160	Loki so we were talking a little bit about the Vita one of the things that
2375160	2380440	they offered in Japan was this cool UMD passport service basically if you owned
2380440	2388840	a PSP and some PSP games like UMD games and you downloaded this application or
2388840	2393060	whatever from the PlayStation Network that allowed you to kind of mark the
2393060	2398800	games that you had so then you could download them for a discount off of the
2398800	2402720	PlayStation Network store and be able to download them onto your Vita so it's not
2402720	2408720	a way to port your games for free from UMD but just a way to kind of offer you
2408720	2414160	a discount or an incentive to do that well that didn't just they just decided
2414160	2417880	hey you know what that's a cool service we're not bringing it over to the United
2417880	2424200	States or North America or Canada or anybody we're just meh you're not gonna
2424200	2428760	have it same with Europe Europe's not getting it either so unfortunately that
2428760	2433920	wonderful service they don't care I think they think that we're gonna abuse
2433920	2437880	it because we're you know the type of people to abuse that kind of thing
2437880	2444520	renting games or whatever I don't know how big rental is over in Japan but I
2444520	2452880	guess it's possible to be honest so not really anyone rents PSP games so oh it's
2452880	2459040	a little disappointing I guess it's disappointing it's you know there's gonna
2459040	2462480	be those people that are like but if you want to play a PSP game then you go get
2462480	2467520	your PSP but well then don't offer the service in Japan and not in other
2467520	2473400	territories there yeah there's that too um and then I'm also like you guys are
2473400	2478640	forgetting that that PSP didn't have digital distribution in the beginning so
2478640	2482200	those of us that were early adopters the PC or at least I'm almost positive it
2482200	2488200	didn't right it didn't for so you know longer than a year yeah it was a while
2488200	2491200	and like there was a lot of games I bought when the PSP first came out like
2491200	2494320	luminous which you know of course I'm always gonna go back to that cuz what
2494320	2499240	probably the greatest puzzle game to come out in a long time and yeah I'd
2499240	2505640	like to be able to have that on my PS Vita but granted the pain is numbed
2505640	2508880	significantly when you consider there's an all-new luminous game coming out so
2508880	2512400	it's gonna with some sounds well yeah I probably won't need the old one as badly
2512400	2517280	as I thought I did but okay what about Final Fantasy 4 the the collection on
2517280	2522560	the complete is great it's the original game and it's it's that PSP graphics
2522560	2526200	which are great and you couldn't download that on the marketplace at
2526200	2530480	first so of course I bought it on UMD and it's like oh damn I'd really love to
2530480	2537120	be able to have that on the Vita but I guess not so I want to buy it again so
2537120	2541440	they guarantee we'll go for the market value that it is right now exactly like
2541440	2546040	you know Final Fantasy 1 & 2 those are pretty awesome games I mean they're like
2546040	2549900	$9 retail now but they're probably gonna be like 15 bucks on the PlayStation
2549900	2553320	that's yeah that's that's kind of a bummer because now the PlayStation
2553320	2557400	Network kind of controls all that and you know hopefully they'll learn
2557400	2560400	something from steam about the deep discounting or maybe the whole
2560400	2564880	PlayStation Plus will throw in I think they already do right don't you get some
2564880	2569280	of those PlayStation do you get full PSP games free I know you get some PSN
2569280	2572640	Network games I don't think PlayStation PlayStation Plus is only on the
2572640	2576240	PlayStation 3 it's not a play oh it'll be it's a Vita thing you're gonna be
2576240	2580720	able to get the discounts on Vita I don't think I don't DLC certainly will
2580720	2593120	be discounted some of it so all right anyhow anything else on the UMD passport
2593120	2597760	system and all that good stuff there's ever a chance there'll be a drive no
2597760	2601480	there won't no they're not gonna make a drive and I don't think they should I
2601480	2610360	mean it's it's ridiculous you don't need to make a UMD drive for a PSP although
2610360	2614200	they did that with the PlayStation 2 memory cards remember they have the
2614200	2618240	memory card adapter that you can now do that before they you know allowed you
2618240	2625160	to use saves one thing that does kind of suck though is the backwards
2625160	2629320	compatibility games Grantha thought it was not one of the games is backwards
2629320	2634720	compatible that is so disappointing but ah but but I hope that that's because
2634720	2638600	that they're gonna go and fix the camera because before there was no camera
2638600	2645720	option it was one analog stick it was very difficult to play but I hope they
2645720	2649680	go back and fix that maybe some HD versions I'd be fine of that I can wait
2649680	2654520	I remember what it was I was gonna say earlier I got distracted by chat for a
2654520	2657920	little bit but I remember what I was gonna say earlier about UMDs notice how
2657920	2661920	in the complaining and the talking and all this stuff no one is talking about
2661920	2670800	the movies remember UMD movies no no one's feeling short change that the
2670800	2675480	movies are not gonna be playable or any of that stuff granted same thing they'll
2675480	2678680	playstation network certainly has its share of movies that they want you to
2678680	2682680	buy download all that well here's a thought how nice your movie's gonna look
2682680	2687160	like on that screen because they already look pretty because they have a lot of
2687160	2690960	digital downloads especially almost all the movies nowadays that come out like
2690960	2694760	on the blu-ray combo packs or whatever they have hey you can download digital
2694760	2699080	copy of the movie it's not bad isn't that all I always thought that was
2699080	2703720	restricted to the iPhone or no no it's usually it's usually iPhone they use
2703720	2709320	that Sony specially had the PSP ones but I think a lot of that they mean mp4s
2709320	2714120	kind of play on everything and they that's the format they usually use I did
2714120	2720840	not think about that so if I haven't cashed in my Tron digital Tron why is
2720840	2724840	the name escaping me right now the new one Tron legacy thank you if I haven't
2724840	2728600	cashed in my Tron legacy digital copy down the back of it because usually
2728600	2739160	it'll say PC you know PC iPod that kind of stuff and you may be able to convert
2739160	2743520	it if because a lot of the portable devices I mean Android phones and so
2743520	2748880	that they don't play you know the iPod stuff let's see I'm so glad we do the
2748880	2753840	show in the house Tron legacy digital copy of future feature film watch it
2753840	2757520	anytime anywhere on your computer and portable device works with iTunes works
2757520	2765160	with Windows Media Player I don't know you might be able to convert it somehow
2765920	2773280	but I mean there's a lot of stuff that you know supports that that's true
2773280	2778040	well Randy said F that UMDs it's all about GBA movie play our carts oh my
2778040	2783560	gosh remember those at e3 yes I do still coming to for the 3ds apparently
2783560	2787960	whatever happened to 3d movies on the 3ds that was a big thing they showed at
2787960	2793920	e3 I'm glad you mentioned that next week shut up really yeah okay there's been
2793920	2797840	like no press about it what 3ds movies just come out next it's not a movie it's
2797840	2804520	a game but it has the movie on it Tekken Tekken Prime or Tekken 3d Prime Edition
2804520	2812640	has the full Tekken animated movie on there in 3d that's weird that's kind of
2812640	2817000	cool though yeah it's just like and the good one too not the crappy live-action
2817000	2822520	Tekken movie hmm so that'll be something for next week that's pretty cool
2822520	2826800	well I just remember at e3 a couple years ago when we first saw the 3ds one
2826800	2830480	of the big things I remember seeing was the tangled trailer because that movie
2830480	2834560	wouldn't out yet and it was on the 3ds and I was like wow this is gonna be a
2834560	2838840	great babysitter system that you know kids and I'm and of course my mind I'm
2838840	2845520	like I want Tron on this thing yeah now haha now you're thinking about that 3ds
2845520	2851440	no I'm still not thinking about the 3ds I have Tron I'm five you have the
2851440	2857280	uber Tron with you know the original Tron on blue-gray and stuff but I don't
2857280	2863440	need three it 3d is cool in a theater 3d is cool maybe on my TV although I don't
2863440	2867920	have a 3d TV so I can't really speak for that I actually have seen our lobby TV
2867920	2875800	has a it's a 3d TV and that was alright but I don't need it 3d on the road I
2875800	2879440	don't need to watch the movie in 3d I mean it adds a little bit it's a little
2879440	2884600	bit more immersive but it's not like oh my god night and day so I'm fine without
2884600	2890360	3d that's why I like a lot of these 3d games I mean it's cool that the 3ds in
2890360	2896040	there like for the 3ds but I don't necessarily need it it doesn't add like
2896040	2900120	a ton of extra gameplay whereas you know that second analog stick does help quite
2900120	2904800	a bit just saying you know if I were the choose hey guess what we can make a
2904800	2908760	system with a second analog stick we're going to have 3d graphics yeah I'd
2908760	2916640	rather play with the second analog stick because that would be pretty useful all
2916640	2922440	right going to our chat room black will says about the Tron digital card says
2922440	2927440	check to see when it expires they expire after a few months great so I might be
2927440	2932840	screwed it's usually about a year and it's been about a year yeah Brad from
2932840	2937760	pot culture says fuck just torrent the movies well if I'm not able to get my
2937760	2941240	digital distribution that I bought fair and or a digital copy that I bought fair
2941240	2945800	and square I just might have to it is stupid that they expire that is kind of
2945800	2951000	dumb that it expires is that a whole is that like to prevent use bonuses I don't
2951000	2955600	what is the point of that it's them being assholes black will says I can't
2955600	2959480	wait for netflix to have 3d movies so I can actually see them in 3d I mean
2959480	2963880	wouldn't mind a 3d netflix after everything netflix has gone through this
2963880	2967800	past year I think a 3d version would be welcomed alright let's move on with some
2967800	2973240	more news we heard that Verizon is teaming up with I did did you also hear
2973240	2977040	that Disney is implementing the rental window I saw that on your Twitter
2977040	2980360	explain that quickly before we go on the next story what is the rental window so
2980360	2984520	to speak the rental window is basically that they limit all distributors from
2984520	2995160	selling copies to rental customers so blockbuster red box whomever cannot buy
2995160	3002160	copies for rent this is to prevent people it doesn't prevent people because
3002160	3006760	the first sale doctrine you can't prevent people from renting movies out
3006760	3012040	but it's basically to prevent them from having the movie on release date so the
3012040	3017840	people have to go so people go into you know their local video store ago all
3017840	3022800	sad face my neutron movies and I hear I better go buy it brand new instead of
3022800	3027600	you're renting it and so they go out will be not trying to try and you should
3027600	3034360	buy when it comes out but no like okay they don't have ours needs moms all they
3034360	3041320	don't have you know Mars needs moms to mom harder so I guess electric mama Lou
3041320	3048160	so I guess I gotta go buy it brand new so my kid can watch this so and and of
3048160	3053880	course you know the idiots that you make these decisions higher up hey look when
3053880	3058360	we did that look our our sell-through sales have just spiked they're just
3058360	3062080	going through there yeah because everybody's going to retail buying
3062080	3065920	copies and bring it back to the rental store so yes that is going to increase
3065920	3069880	the amount of sales you have in your sell-through copies oh but you forgot
3069880	3073400	all the other copies that you were selling for rental that aren't there
3073400	3078960	anymore so it actually evens out or is less but still that's the decision that
3078960	3081960	they make that's also the decision that Warner made a while back in there now a
3081960	3086880	60-day rental window I think and that's because they hate people that rent
3086880	3092240	movies all right ahamkara in our chat room says most of the Nintendo channel
3092240	3095600	3d isn't good you could turn it off and it's no different looking you know
3095600	3100240	that's kind of true like there's a have you ever Loki have you ever watched some
3100240	3104320	of the stuff on the Nintendo download stuff yeah there's some really bad sketch
3104320	3108600	comedy and some stuff on there this is I watch the animated shorts or I used to
3108600	3112280	have it you saw automatically downloaded I was like stop stop I don't I don't
3112280	3117040	want to watch this all right look we got it we we're like 50 minutes into the
3117040	3120920	show we don't one story so let's move on this is a big deal because this is to
3120920	3126240	gain companies people really love me I love both these companies and isn't it
3126240	3131360	rough when you see people you love fighting isn't that hard to watch well
3131360	3136520	that's what's happening now and it's it's a court battle blizzard filed a
3136520	3140760	notice of opposition with the u.s. patent and trademark office what they're trying
3140760	3146400	to do they're trying to block valve from using the term dota now for those that
3146400	3151720	don't know dota defense of the ancients long time ago was a Warcraft 3 mod that
3151720	3157120	was super freaking popular to the extent that it went on to spawn just all these
3157120	3160920	kind of I don't want to say clone games but other types of games in that same
3160920	3166920	vein League of Legends being the huge example of that now what's interesting
3166920	3171320	about dota is that because it was a Warcraft III thing how did it work like
3171320	3176100	there were two guys there was one guy that started dota one guy that continued
3176100	3180320	dota I think that I could guys I so apologize if I'm fucking this up but
3180320	3184880	it's like a soap opera storyline okay I think the guy that continued dota went
3184880	3190360	to go do League of Legends the guy that started dota got hired by valve because
3190360	3193760	that's what valve does they see things out there in the community they hire
3193760	3197240	that's that's where portal came from right the whole nevacular drop yeah
3197240	3204480	hired those guys so valve does that so now valve has dota 2 coming out blizzard
3204480	3208720	because defense of the ancients was a Warcraft 3 mod they're doing their own
3208720	3215880	thing blizzard dota for Starcraft 2 that's coming out at some point most
3215880	3219360	people seem to think it's gonna launch with heart of the swarm or it's gonna
3219360	3223800	require heart of the swarm to give the next Starcraft 2 expansion kind of
3223800	3228720	something that everybody's gonna really want well we've known that this has been
3228720	3232760	the case for almost a year and a half or two years but blizzard is now decided
3232760	3238400	now that dota 2 is in beta testing to take issue which I can kind of you know
3238400	3241520	if you really want to kick them where it counts do it after the games already in
3241520	3246480	beta testing so from that strategical standpoint I assume I can see that but a
3246480	3250720	blizzards case quote by virtue of that use the dota mark has been firmly
3250720	3255520	associated in the mind of consumers with blizzard including to signify a highly
3255520	3259160	popular scenario or variant of one of blizzard best-selling computer games
3259160	3264120	Warcraft 3 a lot of fans are up in arms about this because they're saying
3264120	3269000	blizzard you didn't make the mod yeah and I honestly never heard of the term
3269000	3274880	until a couple days ago but you don't really follow these types of games
3274880	3280200	either to be fair I don't see who wait I'm the lore nerd for Warcraft hold on
3280200	3284360	one sec Matt the dark soccer in your mind go back three days who did you
3284360	3291280	think own dota I was honestly I was I kind of glanced at it and didn't care
3291280	3297480	okay that thought didn't come to your mind fair enough
3297480	3303320	tiger claw on our charm says blizzards version is D OTA with the periods while
3303320	3307960	valve went around that by just calling it dota 2 apparently that wasn't good
3307960	3316280	enough for blizzard valve blizzard doesn't own the I can it was created for
3316280	3319800	one of their games and I can see the whole Association legally I don't know
3319800	3322880	what standing they have I mean I gotta admit legal but I'm not a lawyer also
3322880	3328720	I'm just a sick fanboy the only way legally that blizzard can stand on it is
3328720	3335760	if they had filed a trademark on it also valves game isn't dota it's dota 2 I
3335760	3343320	mean if I want to have a superb owl party can I get away with that are we
3343320	3347240	talking about this last week all right anyhow well and this to me this almost
3347240	3353480	reminds me of monster like monster cable suing monster mini golf because as the
3353480	3357760	word monster in it oh yeah or like I think monster energy drinks does the
3357760	3363240	same thing or they suit monster energy drink I'm sorry but just because a mod
3363240	3368360	was used on your game doesn't mean you have the rights to that and that doesn't
3368360	3372000	work it doesn't work that way unless they use some mod tools that you
3372000	3378760	provided them I don't see how they have the you don't have the rights to that
3378760	3382280	unless they gave you the rights what is this that our pal Bobby black wolf is
3382280	3386400	sending me right now he says this is the link to the dota song by bass hunter you
3386400	3390560	should play this for shits and giggles what is this
3390560	3395040	did end on a job dog on a seat that I haven't a low spell I don't thought we
3395040	3403440	see the heart event and spare money they don't stop I visit the heart event and
3403440	3410160	spare money they don't stop a few lawsuits off dance party instead can we
3410160	3427960	just dance our problems out somebody should sue this guy for being addicting
3427960	3433520	all right that same fucking melodies in like 50 goddamn songs I've heard come
3433520	3442080	out of various European territories moving I'm suing them for that melody
3442080	3451320	damn it dark Sakura save us from dance party I like to move it move it how
3451320	3456120	about some steam stuff speaking of valve yes well you know that whole business
3456120	3462320	with the steam hack it looks like they might have gotten some information for
3462320	3469360	transactions after all that happened between 2004 and 2008 so no incur
3469360	3473920	basically that was announced by Gabe Newell he said that the file had
3473920	3477160	usernames and email addresses and encrypted billing addresses and credit
3477160	3486000	card information but no passwords so I guess maybe your expired card might be
3486000	3494480	in trouble change your passwords anyway and to be perfectly honest it just said
3494480	3500000	he's he suggests using steam guard keep it on and my suggestion is don't put
3500000	3506520	your fucking credit card on steam I use PayPal for a reason the end but it's so
3506520	3510060	easy when you give them your credit card information I'll admit steam has my
3510060	3513040	credit card information so I'm a little nervous but also that credit card
3513040	3519960	expires very soon so yeah and honestly like my last credit card expiration date
3519960	3524880	was like 2010 yeah that's true I mean if they got information from 2008 whatever
3524880	3530920	credit card I was using then long since expired yeah so I mean as long as they
3530920	3534680	can't see what porn I bought on other websites between that time it never
3534680	3539400	hurts to be careful but don't panic in other words hey I like though that
3539400	3543240	they're being very upfront about it I mean the whole steam is awesome situation
3543240	3549360	really sucks but you know I've come to learn that the hacking is one thing and
3549360	3555200	you know PlayStation got hacked and Sony or Sony PlayStation got hacked and then
3555200	3559680	valve got hacked and you know other websites but then the information
3559680	3564880	actually being misused to steal money is another and that's Xbox which totally
3564880	3568880	denies that there has been a hacking of any sort so when choosing between this
3568880	3574400	or this I'd rather go with welp the information was hacked I know that
3574400	3578800	sounds really weird but think about it also use a different password on every
3578800	3582080	website that's really the best practice you have to use a different password on
3582080	3586320	every website you do and it's the only way to keep your information choice a
3586320	3591000	for the love of God your bank account password better be unique please tell me
3591000	3594240	your bank account password is unique and really your email password should be
3594240	3598000	unique too because to reset your password on any other website it usually
3598000	3601680	goes back to your email address so if any thing is going to have unique
3601680	3606640	passwords your banking and your email needs to have unique passwords right and
3606640	3610920	don't have any of your password saved yes and don't name passwords after your
3610920	3615120	kitty and don't be like who was it the president of Syria or whatever they had
3615120	3619680	their password one two three four five don't really that's the same multiple
3619680	3624340	people don't please don't do that but that's the password an idiot would put
3624340	3628160	on his luggage alright moving on
3628160	3635620	Loki so there's a big Kickstarter project featuring double fine they
3635620	3640160	decided to go ahead and put it this project on a Kickstarter to raise money
3640160	3646280	for a classic point-and-click adventure game using modern technology or modern
3646280	3653840	touch technology and it's broken all sorts of records they made their
3653840	3658600	forty thousand or four hundred thousand dollars in less than 24 hours that was
3658600	3665040	the original amount that they were looking to raise and it's already well
3665040	3669880	over a million dollars I believe 1.6 million as of today and they've still
3669880	3676520	got like 30 days to go on this it's just ridiculous it broke you know the records
3676520	3680600	on your Kickstarter and of course they're making quite a bit money off
3680600	3686720	that 5% cut they get kind of nice Kickstarter gets 5% they get 5% oh my
3686720	3690640	gosh hey they got a run they got a run their company yeah I know but I'm just
3690640	3694240	like do people know that 5% of their money goes to I guess they have to when
3694240	3700560	they click accept whether they read it or not yeah so yeah and so obviously
3700560	3705200	this game will be made there's lots of sorry I'm laughing because now I'm
3705200	3709240	thinking about that report I saw on CNN where the people at Kickstarter were
3709240	3712920	watching this double fine thing happening on the televisions and they
3712920	3716480	were like all around and they busted out champagne when it passed the million
3716480	3720960	dollar mark and like oh now I get why cuz they just made two hundred thousand
3720960	3725360	dollars in one fucking day or excuse me twenty thousand dollars it's still
3725360	3729960	really good yeah they've got 29 days to go and I mean you can still if you want
3729960	3733900	to pledge money for this and there's no reason I mean I can't fucking do math
3733900	3741200	50,000 yeah there's you know you can still pledge money if you want to and
3741200	3744840	they've got you know all the upper tier stuff sold out someone actually pledged
3744840	3751560	$10,000 or more to this there's ten people that pledge $5,000 100 to pledge
3751560	3757640	over $1,000 900 that pledges over 250 this is ridiculous but there's still the
3757640	3762240	bottom tier stuff if you pledge $15 you get a copy of the game and access to the
3762240	3766320	beta and steam as well as access to the video series and private discussion
3766320	3771080	community $30 or more you get HD download of the documentary series with
3771080	3775960	extras digital game soundtrack and all the other stuff before that and then 100
3775960	3780520	bucks you get the original double fine adventure poster an exclusive campaign
3780520	3787440	special thanks in the games credits and all the previous stuff so you should
3787440	3792200	well check out Kickstarter period cuz they need a lot of neat stuff on there
3792200	3796680	not necessarily just video game stuff but like they had it one time and I
3796680	3801360	almost considered doing it like you could buy a set of Catan tiles that were
3801360	3806580	like etched laser etched on wood nice nice that they're really fucking
3806580	3815580	expensive but uh oh my my favorite one which I've got a I can't remember it's a
3815580	3823480	card game it's just very inappropriate that's I can remember now dark to see
3823480	3826800	you in our time says last I heard they were almost gonna break 2 million 1.6
3826800	3830280	million when I looked earlier is where they're at now yeah yeah so that fair
3830280	3834360	chunk of money this just in by the way orange launch radio is starting a
3834360	3838140	Kickstarter if you want to save the afterbirth segment I'm kidding I'm
3838140	3847500	kidding I'm kidding but seriously now I'm like what could we give away and we
3847500	3852320	can honestly do that I mean no card against humanity not in it for the money
3852320	3856200	remember guys are not enough for the money cards against humanity is the
3856200	3859320	thing that was a Kickstarter project that it's basically this card game
3859320	3868320	that's really bad it's it's not appropriate for most ages um did you
3868320	3872400	donate to this or did you think about donating this why not I mean I didn't
3872400	3876560	either but we were talking about this with Bobby on his show earlier before we
3876560	3879960	started tonight and he did and so we were kind of talking about the last
3879960	3887520	thing I donated money for was that humble bundle and I've played one of the
3887520	3891000	games out of that I'm not gonna buy another digital game that I'm not gonna
3891000	3896720	fucking play so I do play the games in the humble indie bundle yeah that was a
3896720	3899960	great deal I've played only one of them I still have all the other like but you
3899960	3904360	did good for charity this has nothing to do with charity I understand nothing to
3904360	3909000	do with charity remember that I understand that and and that's the other
3909000	3913640	thing too it's raised money faster than Child's Play did think about it Child's
3913640	3916240	Play did not raise a million dollars in it well I take that back they may have
3916240	3920240	at some point but over the course of three months they raised three million
3920240	3924800	well it was great if I Child's Play then comes up with some cool perks you know
3924800	3929840	to give away and I know the guys behind penny arcade probably could come up with
3929840	3932560	some cool perks and then put a Kickstarter page up I'm sure they can
3932560	3938720	get quite a bit of tension and get money raised that way and I think it's a cool
3938720	3943400	idea crowdsourcing is kind of neat and you know I could think of some ways we
3943400	3950720	could utilize that but it's just I don't know like if we like they had another
3950720	3955360	game there was another one it was by the guys that did I want to say the Tony
3955360	3959840	Hawk game or something like that like one of the Tony Hawk games or something
3959840	3965160	and they were raising money for this really terrible looking Kinect Xbox Live
3965160	3969640	arcade game where you bounce your characters around like some Steve
3969640	3974200	Pachinko looking machine and it was just terrible but they love pitching but
3974200	3978720	they're raising money for that and it's like so you're gonna raise money for
3978720	3983080	this and then you're gonna put on Xbox Live arcade and make more money because
3983080	3986640	you're not investing really any of your money because it's you're making all the
3986640	3990600	money it must be nice I mean hell if I was motivated enough to program games
3990600	3994000	and stuff and I could make a convincing Kickstarter that would be cool hey look
3994000	3996760	I got all my seed money now I'm gonna make some money and all I have to do is
3996760	4001760	provide some people some free codes or some extra tchotchkes then that's it
4001760	4006600	here's my honest concern and I think this is a legitimate concern to have what
4006600	4011080	if the game's bad I mean I realize the whole community is gonna be
4011080	4015140	participating and in talking about this on the forums and you know watching the
4015140	4018840	development and that part's really cool I got to give props to somebody that's
4018840	4023400	willing to lift the curtain a little bit there and show you what's back there but
4023400	4027640	I'm also a little bit like you know some sometimes community isn't always right
4027640	4031760	in their decisions you know sometimes the hardcore gamers alienate the casual
4031760	4035440	gamers and I talked about World of Warcraft did that a little bit with
4035440	4039120	that's the same with like a pre-order though I mean you put money down for a
4039120	4042960	pre-order and you get the game and it could suck mmm thing again I'm not
4042960	4049360	putting $100 down for a game I mean I I could see putting the $15 down which is
4049360	4053960	basically a game purchase and don't get me wrong this day and age so $15 for
4053960	4057960	digital game is kind of kind of expensive so it you know it better be
4057960	4062200	pretty good I beg to differ that's average for a PlayStation or Xbox game
4062200	4067480	most of them these days are 1200 points it's 15 bucks I make it ever I we like
4067480	4071560	them when they're 800 points but let's be real there has not been a 400 points
4071560	4079640	game in like four years so unless you're talking indie games because I think
4079640	4087240	indie games can go as high as 400 points so so we'll see I don't know it's just I
4087240	4092720	just don't see myself you know buying this game I'm well yeah I'll buy it if
4092720	4097120	it if the folks that are watching it say gosh this is looking greater it's a
4097120	4100120	great game or when it actually comes out it's great reviews just like any other
4100120	4104640	game but I don't know like I don't know if I but see as I was you know
4104640	4109520	mentioning on this topic earlier I might not feel that strongly about this double
4109520	4113240	fine thing but if Nintendo came out tomorrow and said hey if we can raise
4113240	4116920	$500,000 on Kickstarter we'll do killer instinct 3 I'll be like take my money
4116920	4122800	take it here you go and you're part of the problem no I'm serious here you're
4122800	4128120	part of the problem then I or Konami says we'll support rhythm rhythm fever
4128120	4133560	if you know no no if they came out and said that shit I say fuck you fuck you
4133560	4139760	fuck you I am NOT paying you a dime for a fucking game you make the game and
4139760	4144760	then I'll buy it if it's good I'm not gonna you know I'm not gonna be like oh
4144760	4149520	well I'm not gonna make games until people pay me money first yeah that must
4149520	4154400	be nice you know I'm not gonna well Konami did that remember it was beat
4154400	4158360	mania 2d x7 style yeah remember they said they were not gonna do it until
4158360	4162880	10,000 people pre-ordered the game yeah and they're fucking assholes and you see
4162880	4166840	what their car see what that karma did yeah where's your fucking beat mania
4166840	4173040	DDR series now oh that's right where is your god of music now it's in the
4173040	4179720	shitter because you fucking sucked it it's just like you know what you know
4179720	4184280	what the chicken style is awesome you know the cherry on the top for that
4184280	4190840	karma pie was it's a fucking rock revolution rock revolution was just
4190840	4198840	like I'm gonna take a dump on this disc right here here you go I you know what
4198840	4205200	though if you want to ask the question when did Bamani die that would be the
4205200	4209840	best answer now thankful thank thank God Bamani's seemingly making a comeback
4209840	4214160	there's a couple new arcade games I still I still say I don't give two
4214160	4218760	shits what you say Loki that rhythm fever game is actually a lot of fun on
4218760	4223000	connect no don't get me wrong they're on the path they're on the right path but
4223000	4228720	it's just it's still a ways away and I'm sorry they just take a lot of missteps
4228720	4234640	and you know dark gray nope it's flowing down the screen against a black
4234640	4239320	background not the smartest thing to do let's go to the chat room because Bobby
4239320	4245280	black wolf loves to correct me loves to correct me and says there is a 400
4245280	4250240	spacebucks arcade game a few weeks ago the scrabble plus risk combo coral
4250240	4254080	member coral that I didn't realize that was 400 points I've heard a lot of good
4254080	4255840	things about that game I think I might get it
4255840	4259440	scrabble plus risk dark soccer doesn't that sound pretty cool sounds
4259440	4266400	interesting mm-hmm all right moving on let's talk Mass Effect I know a lot of
4266400	4270680	you kids really love Mass Effect and boy Mass Effect is going to keep on giving
4270680	4275480	you know Bioware has all these studios now I mean hell Sacramento has one where
4275480	4279960	we're at even as a Bioware studio so when there's a big Bioware event man
4279960	4283880	they can get all these properties out everywhere and that's what's happening
4283880	4291600	with Mass Effect 3 there is a Mass Effect 3 tie-in called Mass Effect data
4291600	4298080	pad it's gonna be an iPad app that works with the console or PC version of the
4298080	4302520	game and the reason why I sound sketchy on this is because there's really no
4302520	4306400	details beyond that just some type of iPad interaction that works with the
4306400	4309920	game I don't know if that's like Disney it will take a picture of a something or
4309920	4313400	other on the screen and do something that's pretty much I think what it's
4313400	4317040	gonna do like read QR codes or something like that I like something like that
4317040	4322840	like you at the but I don't know you know a lot of a lot of nerds have that
4322840	4328800	stuff handy so I don't have an iPad but you know on iOS which is the other story
4328800	4333760	so not just the iPad or whatever that is but there's also Mass Effect
4333760	4339120	infiltrator this is gonna be an iPhone iPad iPod touch game it's a third-person
4339120	4343960	shooter it features certain weapon and powers from Mass Effect the whole
4343960	4347080	storyline has to do with freeing prisoners from a hostile base you know
4347080	4352480	typical space sci-fi stuff you get awards for collecting evidence of the
4352480	4358160	crimes that happen that you catch in the mission and I guess it increases your
4358160	4363440	Mass Effect 3 galaxy at war galactic readiness rating so I guess things that
4363440	4367480	you do an infiltrator can actually affect what happens in Mass Effect 3 so
4367480	4370480	that's kind of neat that they'll work together like that I imagine you kind of
4370480	4375280	tie all your accounts together through the EA website and it'll work so that's
4375280	4379760	kind of cool tie your accounts all together through the EA website get FIFA
4379760	4389520	you didn't ask for it so I it's interesting I mean I'm not super huge in
4389520	4393200	Mass Effect but I know people that are and I can't deny that Mass Effect is a
4393200	4396240	huge franchise that a lot of people are really excited about so I gotta admit
4396240	4399880	there are certain games where if they had like the iPad app I'd be like that's
4399880	4405000	pretty awesome so I hope it enhances the experience it isn't just a cheap cash-in
4405000	4409120	I'm not gonna pretend if they had an IS app for like a Grand Theft Auto game or
4409120	4412400	something like that I'm I might have to pick it up or like an iPad Saints Row
4412400	4417040	the third somehow like like you could control your missiles on the iPad no
4417040	4423320	that wouldn't be worth it I don't think so yeah the UAV got they got boring
4423320	4429720	pretty fast it's just much faster to use the other weapons all right release
4429720	4434120	dates coming up right after one more story from Dark Sakura well how about
4434120	4445440	the Xbox the Xbox I've never played an Xbox the lube the ex you the ex you
4445440	4451200	explain yourself woman how about an Xbox tablet instead there in Xbox world for
4451200	4458520	April 2012 there was an announcement for a new Xbox at e3 that has a tablet of
4458520	4464840	course my thought is that this is the April issue hello it's a little early
4464840	4470000	for the April issue I think it says scans of Xbox world for April 2012
4470000	4476520	actually no because April ones are on the newsstand in March and we're getting
4476520	4479840	towards the end of February so we're getting towards the end of February
4479840	4484880	really this could be so well for the publisher we're approaching the end it's
4484880	4490760	way over there but we're on our way I shut up if I may this may also be
4490760	4495080	someone who happens to be with a publisher or something I don't know it
4495080	4504880	says April 2012 huh huh yeah but that's when Xbox world is okay well it says
4504880	4511200	that there is a matte black media hub that is gonna have a tablet and that
4511200	4518560	it's gonna be I'm trying to see where yes they're anticipating 399 pounds yeah
4518560	4523960	this is British of course but they said that it works as a remote control with
4523960	4527280	your TV as a browser when you're on the internet has extra buttons for playing a
4527280	4532640	game or a portable display when you want to take your game with you so yeah 600
4532640	4539520	bucks roughly it's it's a rumor I'm thinking it's a troll but it better be a
4539520	4543200	troll because I'm looking at that picture and it shows just a tablet with
4543200	4547360	no tangible buttons and when I see that and see Xbox wants to use this as a
4547360	4552840	controller I'm like nine nine nine nine nine tangible control no no no I think
4552840	4557040	what I think what it sounds like to me is that it's a little bit of an
4557040	4560160	expansion on what they had already talked about with I think you do this
4560160	4566120	window windows phones where basically you can browse your I don't even know
4566120	4569120	what the fuck they call their little dashboard you can browse around they're
4569120	4572720	using your windows phone and you can queue up stuff like that maybe that they
4572720	4577320	add that to a tablet that's running like the windows phone OS or whatever hope
4577320	4582760	they got it they updated to like Android or something and then they can you know
4582760	4586640	have some buttons on there so that you can play like different Xbox Live arcade
4586640	4591440	games or something like that on there I could see an app maybe but isn't it
4591440	4594360	funny that this comes up this story comes up right after we were talking
4594360	4598320	about Mass Effect and how it's kind of tying into tablets well here's the other
4598320	4602200	funny thing to precursor of things to come I have to find it but there was
4602200	4606560	also the same rumor for the PlayStation 3 that they were oh wait no we talked
4606560	4609760	about last week but they're gonna come up with a tablet member oh yeah the
4609760	4614000	whole it had been patented or something like that right yeah but though and then
4614000	4618320	the patent doesn't always mean reality my response to that is you already have
4618320	4624040	some of that with the PSP can tie into the ps3 a little bit and plus the whole
4624040	4628000	god they were showing it at e3 the whole Vita and that dungeon crawler game that
4628000	4631240	hasn't changed its name like three times now the dungeon crawler game that's on
4631240	4634400	the Vita that you know you can that's our game and then pick it up on the ps3
4634400	4639640	and that's a hunter's alliance I think because I think they're calling it now
4639640	4646200	right yeah so I mean theoretically you can already have that technology if you
4646200	4649960	really want to use it but it's expensive because that means you have to own a
4649960	4659920	$249 Vita and a $299 PlayStation 3 so $299 $200 it has a lot cheaper than it
4659920	4664840	used to be it is but that's that's where it's at now because blu-ray players are
4664840	4667960	very cheap to came down with that technology all right let's move on we're
4667960	4670440	gonna travel around the world and talk about release dates and see what's
4670440	4676440	coming out to a game stop or a Best Buy or Walmart or whatever you like to shop
4676440	4683880	Amazon near you actually earlier this week the Nintendo 3ds pearl pink came
4683880	4692160	out ooh snap those up right away before the new hardware revision comes out
4692160	4698080	Zumba fitness rush came out today that's definitely worthy of a Sunday release
4698080	4705640	that's on Xbox 360 for connect rhythm heaven fever comes out tomorrow on the
4705640	4712280	Nintendo Wii and only $29.99 they did a big push for that Adam there was like a
4712280	4716040	whole launch event in LA and all this stuff yeah I fucking hate rhythm heaven
4716040	4721720	it's a frustrating fucking game it looks interesting but it's not very fun I'm
4721720	4726840	kind of over the Wii the Wii's just kind of sitting sad in the corner B units
4726840	4735960	build it for Nintendo DS see hakuoki demon of the fleeting blossom coming
4735960	4742200	out on PSP I believe that's a visual novel game blaze blue continuum shift
4742200	4747480	extend on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and because this week you are getting the
4747480	4754320	early adopter edition of you know the first run PS PlayStation Vita although
4754320	4760680	they do say PS Vita so Vita it is also now coming out on the Vita as well also
4760680	4771000	on the Vita formula 1 2011 FIFA soccer Virtua Tennis 4 world tour and luminous
4771000	4778680	electronic symphony Rayman origins and that's right Vita games are now going to
4778680	4781880	hit stores because people have those early bundles and to be honest they've
4781880	4784880	already been hitting stores because there's no street dates on the first
4784880	4788760	party games those were already out for a few weeks now interesting nothing you
4788760	4792800	know I'm gonna go take this box home and just read the instruction manual if you
4792800	4795720	have a Japanese system it's useful because they're region free so that's
4795720	4802320	right uh-huh other stuff on other systems we've got of course UFC
4802320	4809400	Undisputed 3 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 tales of the abyss on the 3ds the

5172600	5178840	push the button to scoop their poop my devi mon not my devi my my yeah it was
5178840	5185320	because I had the digimon ones remember the original digimon that was a direct
5185320	5189640	release from the Tamagotchi I don't know some guys might be into that in 3d and
5189640	5195880	all you never know devi mon was a big shitter alright just a couple more news
5195880	5200280	stories for you guys in the classic game of the week Loki so the ps3 did get
5200280	5205560	another firmware update this week it speeds up web browsing apparently
5205560	5211520	according to the notes for the 4.1 update also they change your account
5211520	5215320	from the PlayStation Network account to the Sony Entertainment Network account
5215320	5222560	and other things and improve display speed for the browser and I believe they
5222560	5229840	also added Dropbox support so you can use that for storing images online huh
5229840	5235080	I didn't realize that yeah it's pretty cool some other cool stuff of course
5235080	5239280	there was this whole play memories thing that they were teasing a little bit ago
5239280	5244680	it's a video editing app that's gonna be part of the PlayStation 3 as well as a
5244680	5252720	PC and mobile suite and they've included five gigabytes of storage as well that's
5252720	5259960	going to be on a cloud-based service and it does work with you know iOS and
5259960	5265040	Android devices and apparently you'll be able to you know edit images and videos
5265040	5271760	and stuff like that I can't imagine the image editing on the ps3 be very easy
5271760	5280680	this is the controller right everyone else all right real quickly speaking of
5280680	5284200	Sony things one of the big things that people are looking forward to on the
5284200	5290200	PlayStation Vita or the PlayStation 3 the Final Fantasy 10 re-release now this is
5290200	5295240	interesting because I thought we had a story on this a couple months ago that
5295240	5299320	said Final Fantasy 10 is is a complete redo they're building it from the ground
5299320	5304200	up and all this stuff it is it is a remake but this week it seems like
5304200	5308840	they've gone back on that a little bit let's see this was at a China Final
5308840	5313000	Fantasy event the Taipei game show because they were pushing Final Fantasy
5313000	5318160	13 to squeamix producer you know we always call Square Enix squeamix here on
5318160	5322600	the show producer Shinji Hashimoto was at answering some fan questions about
5322600	5326280	some of the Final Fantasy games and somebody asked about hey is the
5326280	5330920	PlayStation 3 and Vita re-release of Final Fantasy 10 is it a remake or is it
5330920	5338200	a remaster and Hashimoto said directly it is a remaster so think like the
5338200	5342440	Shadow of the Colossus HD thing that came out not too long ago I wouldn't
5342440	5346680	even say it's well that wouldn't be so bad hopefully it's not like the
5346680	5351440	Melger Solid stuff they look kind of blurry and weird now he also went so far
5351440	5355120	to say that the screen is much prettier than the original but he didn't really
5355120	5363040	elaborate on that whatsoever what can I do for you give me Final Fantasy 7 next
5363040	5368040	how about first that's what all the fans are saying but I I get it though it's
5368040	5371680	easier to do this I mean there was an excellent point that was made is that a
5371680	5374680	lot of the stuff that was in Final Fantasy 7 was still kind of sprite based
5374680	5379600	whereas everything in Final Fantasy 10 was full 3d so it's much easier to take
5379600	5384720	Final Fantasy 10 and just you know assign it to the new resolution give it
5384720	5389400	some higher res textures and you know maybe remake the menu and and go back
5389400	5392520	into some of the things you know I think they'll do some other little things to
5392520	5396120	sweeten the pot I'm sure maybe like a bonus summon or a bonus dungeon or
5396120	5400040	something else you know it's I think it'll I think it'll pay tribute well
5400040	5403560	enough to the original I'm so I like Final Fantasy 10 I know Final Fantasy 10
5403560	5408460	has a share of haters but I thought it was great it's still still to this day
5408460	5412600	in my opinion has the best summon of all time Shiva of course when she comes out
5412600	5424160	snap great so huh anyhow how about we travel down memory lane a little bit
5424160	5430120	sounds plan later we always on the show let's take a trip down memory lane in a
5430120	5434280	segment we call the classic game of the week where dark soccer is gonna reach
5434280	5438800	into the vault and find a classic game she says hey why don't you remaster this
5438800	5446120	bitches hmm back in my day we didn't have remakes and remasters we played our
5446120	5451600	games ugly ass pixelated and we liked it ugly they were cute all right so dark
5451600	5457720	Sakura what is the classic game of the week this week puzzle bobble yay it came
5457720	5462900	out in America as bust a move but puzzle bobble is great and I've been playing a
5462900	5473200	lot of it lately it came out in 1994 it's about as high as it goes this
5473200	5480920	YouTube I'm streaming things a little quiet I love this game anyway puzzle
5480920	5485400	bobble was a puzzle game that came out for one or two players put out by Taito
5485400	5489680	based off of their 1986 game bubble bubble and it has the characters from
5489680	5496240	that game you play as bub and or Bob and it's cute it's super cute I love the
5496240	5502440	game there were two different versions of the original there was puzzle bobble
5502440	5508720	that came out in Japan only in 1994 on a Taito B system hardware though and it
5508720	5512200	was originally called bubble buster and then down the line there was the neo-geo
5512200	5517480	version of puzzle bobble that was exactly the same except it was in stereo
5517480	5523880	and had a few different sound effects and translated text when it came out in
5523880	5529280	the u.s. it was called a bust a move and had anti-drug and anti-literary messages
5529280	5536640	ooh and the same title was wait a minute puzzle bottle was anti-drug are we
5536640	5540640	talking just an FBI warning in the beginning winners don't use drugs okay
5540640	5548400	and the title was retained for the u.s. Canada and Europe on consoles so
5548400	5554000	basically you have different colored balls for different reason they're
5554000	5561800	bubbles but they you have different colors and you have to turn the crank to
5561800	5570680	launch the balls yes turn the crank to watch the balls that's what they're doing yes
5570680	5576400	at any rate you have a little pointer and yes you does attach to a crank that
5576400	5581960	Bob and Bob move and you can bounce these bubbles little bubbles up to other
5581960	5587520	bubbles and when you get three in a row touching then they pop you may have a
5587520	5591520	bunch of one color already up there in a neat colorful pattern but it gets really
5591520	5595000	complicated trust me I noticed that when they touch the balls together they
5595000	5606000	explode so they go in the direct line along the pointer and as you do though a
5606000	5612520	few more in a row then the ceiling starts to drop down when your bubbles
5612520	5618840	hit the very bottom line then your game over if you don't know this game isn't
5618840	5627240	crawl up from under the rock no dipping your balls below the line I think dark
5627240	5638800	soccer is mad at me anyway which were your favorite balls the blue ones she's
5638800	5646960	trying not to laugh she thinks she's bad she's not shut up you're a bitch at any
5646960	5652400	rate it has really busting your balls there it has a different scoring system
5652400	5657520	it's exponential scoring so for each that you pop in the same color they're
5657520	5661720	worth ten points each but if you drop a bunch that are attached to that one me
5661720	5667400	like say that you've got at the top you have like two yellow one blue one green
5667400	5671000	you know I'll touch the yellow when you break the yellow ones everything that's
5671000	5677600	textural balls it's good balls drop your score actually will go to 20 points and
5677600	5681680	then 40 and then 80 so it's an exponential scoring system if you rub
5681680	5686040	and girls together their maximum is 50,000 points that you get for clearing
5686040	5690720	it within five seconds or less and then it drops down to zero over the next
5690720	5696400	minute you do have two player modes are not around you just each have the arena
5696400	5703760	and the same arrangement but when you get a large clump broken it goes on to
5703760	5708160	the opponent's side kind of the way that uh help you appeal works which is one of
5708160	5712680	another one of my favorites so yeah it's bub and Bob or as they were doing in
5712680	5719760	Japan baboon and baboon and it's their same animation from a bubble bubble
5719760	5724840	actually closer to bubble symphony and it also has all the enemies in it so the
5724840	5733040	red one is and I'll do both names the English name was super socket and
5733040	5739160	Japanese name was invader the yellow one is hello balloon or pull pull there was
5739160	5744080	a green is Willy whistle or drunk blue is bubble buster or Zen Chan purple is
5744080	5750640	beluga or Monsta orange is quietly or Bonnie bow black is incendo or hit a
5750640	5756840	konsu and white is stoner or my death who doesn't want to name their balls so
5756840	5759840	for all the games that came out there are a bunch of them and I will go
5759840	5766000	pretty much in order there was puzzle bobble puzzle bobble 2 which was called

5890880	5895360	ask it's very important that we didn't address what in the actual fuck it was
5895360	5901280	this box art on the PlayStation 2 for super bus to move it was redonk I'm
5901280	5905000	gonna I'm gonna post this link in chat it's from Amazon I apologize it's big
5905000	5907760	but that's the only place I need to find the box art for those listening on the
5907760	5912400	podcast just go to your favorite retail site Amazon whatever look for super bus

5941840	5945200	the chat room like Taito what kind of crack do you think Americans are on I
5945200	5949080	think that company or whoever they hired for marketing was the same one that
5949080	5961200	launched the PlayStation 3 a shitload of that game on Saturn like I would just
5961200	5964160	sit in front of it for hours and scream at it it's one of those games that you
5964160	5967720	see it in the arcade and if it's 25 cents you can't help but just check it
5967720	5971560	out you know like even to this day I've fucking creepy game even recently

6059360	6063280	to say this I'm very proud of the chatters tonight because despite
6063280	6066800	everything that's going on in the world right now there wasn't a single person
6066800	6069720	now of course now they're gonna say this everybody's gonna do this but there
6069720	6073240	wasn't a single person that came in to chat tonight and said hey did you guys
6073240	6077440	hear that Whitney Houston died because I was so waiting for that because
6077440	6081400	inevitably when something big happens in the world that really has nothing to do
6081400	6085080	with video games it'll get brought up anyway it's really been off and on like
6085080	6090040	even on the radio and stuff because like today I was you know driving my wife's
6090040	6095080	car and she has the radio tuned to be like it's not really like oldies but
6095080	6099080	it's like the R&B station or whatever and is it that V 101 or whatever you
6099080	6104200	want to say so I was driving to the park to take Josh to the park it's just you
6104200	6107960	know regular music you know that's fine I'll wait home for the park all Whitney
6107960	6113280	Houston solid Whitney Houston from like it was like three songs all Whitney
6113280	6117400	Houston it was ridiculous obviously it's a tragic loss that it up but they all
6117400	6121400	sound very the same it doesn't have to stop it it doesn't really have anything
6121400	6125720	to do with video games well she to be fair I totally have I want to dance with
6125720	6131160	somebody and sing star so she wasn't seeing star so tip of the hat to a
6131160	6137280	famous seeing star inspiration I guess if you want to say that all right but I
6137280	6141600	will give a big gold star to all our chatters tonight for keeping it on topic
6141600	6145880	you know even despite all of the unfortunate that happened with Miss
6145880	6150080	Houston there's not really a lot of talk about the Grammys either so I know you
6150080	6154640	guys are focused and I appreciate that all right let's move on let's get back
6154640	6160320	into some rapid-fire news we're going to do some quick news stories and then
6160320	6164920	we'll get back into the longer stuff so Loki start us off with some rapid-fire
6164920	6169300	news Microsoft finally or Microsoft or LucasArts I haven't really said who
6169300	6175000	announced this but they've announced the date for connect Star Wars I know let's
6175000	6181180	get excited it's coming in April and it's not joke it's on April 3rd that is
6181180	6185080	probably the closest date they could have added to you know get in there

6195240	6200600	that um that can the Xbox it looks like r2d2 looks pretty kick-ass oh yeah so
6200600	6205280	that'll be coming on the same day as well now here's here's the thing and I
6205280	6209820	know we've talked about this before but really really they're gonna have dancing
6209820	6215840	in there I mean that just looks stupid shut up they put dancing in there oh my
6215840	6223240	god that's Star Wars that is connects Star Wars that looks like dance masters
6223240	6228040	yeah exactly is that like cantina dancing or something they're gonna have
6228040	6231520	dancing I see Jabba the Hutt back there it's like you can be one of his sluts

6247300	6250560	eyes in our chat room gives us the greatest line from the trailer
6250560	6257040	lightsaber on remember it's all about the voice commands and I'm telling you I
6257040	6264640	played this game and oh my god yeah you played it oh my god no no no no no I
6264640	6275280	think you need to see this as well no make it stop stupid like that that
6275280	6279320	little picture is not helping the rumors about c-3po sexuality because you know
6279320	6284880	that's out there in the fanverse I'm just saying I'm just saying just saying
6284880	6290440	all I gotta say is the one that they had a Disneyland dance-off much better than
6290440	6297040	this shit and you know he's dancing the gaga it's he was programmed this way
6297040	6305040	baby lol ah yeah anyways I just hope that God it's it's way better than than
6305040	6310000	the versions because those were not good but that is supposed to be coming out
6310000	6318480	April 3rd and so yeah some other stuff Super Mario Brothers crossover 2 is now
6318480	6322320	on the Super Mario Brothers crossover is definitely something that's infringing
6322320	6326040	all sorts of copyrights but hey it's a flash game it's been out there for a
6326040	6330760	while and people play it so if you want to check it out it's at exploding rabbit
6330760	6338160	com slash game slash Super dash Mario dash Bros dash crossover I'm sure if you
6338160	6341880	just go explaining rabbit.com they have a link on the front page and basically
6341880	6347080	what version 2 offers you is you know you still get the play as multiple
6347080	6353200	characters including Mario Luigi Link Samus Simon Belmont Megaman base Bill
6353200	6360760	Reiser Ryu and Sophia the third from blaster master yes blaster master and
6360760	6364800	then they all have alternate looks because you can also cycle through the
6364800	6369960	game or they cycle randomly through versions of the levels including NES
6369960	6375160	Super NES and Game Boy styles throughout the game as well also
6375160	6383080	apparently demon returns super demon returns and I guess the Super Mario
6383080	6389080	Brothers style game from the DS's retro game challenge 2 are different versions
6389080	6398160	as well so neat and there's also a picture that shows Dr. Wily in there so
6398160	6405320	I don't know if you could play as him that'd be weird so that's uh that by the
6405320	6409760	way quickly the chatters are asking for the question or asking for the Star
6409760	6414040	Wars dance party pictures see all Lincoln yeah Lincoln and then Rama can
6414040	6416600	get him up on the tumbler for the podcast listeners I want to see it too
6416600	6422440	disturbing it is a little disturbing just a warning don't click and then
6422440	6427600	finally apparently there's a rumor that certain and I mean this is probably
6427600	6435600	gonna be happening certain people that put stuff on the App Store are using
6435600	6442120	bots to automatically download their games and boost their rankings in the
6442120	6449640	App Store to get more people to download it I mean I don't even have to really
6449640	6453120	look into that to know that that's probably true I mean there's people that
6453120	6458680	put artificially high review scores to boost their reviews and stuff so why not
6458680	6461960	now is a great time to mention if you want to leave your totally legitimate
6461960	6465480	five-star reviews for Orange Lounge Radio on the iTunes Store we'd really
6465480	6468480	appreciate it by the way click the subscribe button four or five times
6468480	6473640	while you're there I'm kidding maybe I'm not about the five-star reviews though
6473640	6478280	so all right I I'm not I would not be surprised all by the way looking at some
6478280	6481000	of those games that are in the top 20 like you really look at like how did
6481000	6484520	this get here really this game is beating Angry Birds and where's my water
6484520	6490040	and the stuff you expect to see in the top 10 really interesting speaking of
6490040	6496520	games you expect to see in the top 10 on the iOS store tiny tower look hate on
6496520	6501080	this game all you want but it is really fucking addicting and how many addicts

6506240	6509880	tweeted this week that 10 million folks have downloaded tiny tower that's on
6509880	6514320	iOS that's not counting Android or I think that's it it's only also on
6514320	6519920	Android I believe it has a million daily active users I am no longer an active
6519920	6523600	player this game I finally quit I stopped the crack a few months ago how
6523600	6527840	tall is your tower um I know it pales in comparison years I won't say it was like
6527840	6531320	82 stories or something like that I still have to get the new shops well
6531320	6535280	actually no I did get the new shops last time I still have the oh that's right
6535280	6541560	there are new shops huh damn you don't say things like that let me look because
6541560	6544200	you asked I'm gonna fire up my tiny tower right look at this I haven't
6544200	6549240	touched this crack in a long time dark soccer did you ever get us sucked into
6549240	6552880	tiny tower for a little yeah I stopped you finally stopped I stopped it a while
6552880	6559480	back good for you let's see my tower is I do not want to get the plant game
6559480	6567080	leave me alone let's see 86 stories tall I was close and my 86th floor for the
6567080	6574280	record is the nerd cave apartments very cool very cool right above the 85th
6574280	6577280	floor volleyball because I don't know who puts volleyball on the 85th floor
6577280	6583520	but there you go huh Bahmani fans are looking forward to a new arcade game
6583520	6589720	called sound voltex booth this is gonna be playable at the AOU 2012 amusement
6589720	6594120	Expo it's kind of a new Bahmani game from Konami and there's some new songs
6594120	6597880	that have been announced for it called Zephyr remix so you might remember
6597880	6601880	Zephyr from one of the old DDR games a red zone remix and this is gonna be very
6601880	6605400	cool a vampire killer remix because as you know vampire killer is one of the
6605400	6609760	big songs from Castlevania so we like it when the Bahmani series kind of jacks
6609760	6614640	music from other Konami games because let's face it Konami music was awesome
6614640	6621720	also making its way to AOU an arcade version of dance evolution a new version
6621720	6625240	of you beat as well and I didn't know this series was still going guitar
6625240	6630800	freaks and drum mania xg3 I had no idea that series is still alive and kicking
6630800	6637360	but there you go lastly from me Nintendo of America has hired a new spokesperson
6637360	6641880	and following in the footsteps of what Carrie Underwood has been a Nintendo
6641880	6646840	spokesperson Beyonce has been a Nintendo spokesperson who could live up to those
6646840	6654640	great great musicians how about Oogie Oogie is a Jack Russell Terrier that's
6654640	6659040	right Nintendo has hired a dog to be their next pose person now to be fair
6659040	6663400	this dog is very famous because this dog appears in the movie the artist which is
6663400	6667080	like you know the movie they all say is gonna win the Oscar right I haven't seen
6667080	6670240	the movie it apparently the dog plays one of those like way too cute roles
6670240	6674600	that you know it's very memorable and what game will he be pimping guesses
6674600	6680580	guesses Nintendogs of course Nintendogs we have something to say about that a
6680580	6688160	second and and and the pearl pink 3ds Oh for the record I found in the
6688160	6693640	Nintendogs plus cats in the clearance Bennett fries nice how much 14 bucks I'm
6693640	6697760	not surprised they need to fucking sell those they probably have like tons on
6697760	6704840	their shelves hey this is just Nintendogs the end there's no cats yeah
6704840	6714120	all right dark Sakura well how about Sonic Sonic and Sega all-stars racing is
6714120	6722720	getting a sequel and it will be out it looks like at the end of the year so hey
6722720	6728560	fun I tried to play it I didn't really care for it and then there is and more
6728560	6733560	racing news little big planet karting that will be coming out and it was
6733560	6740000	actually announced via Twitter I think dark Tetsuya said this in the
6740000	6743880	destination PlayStations where people were at I think our Tetsuya said this in
6743880	6747640	the mod forums but isn't little big planet karting basically mod nation

6910240	6918600	meat there goes that tail there they go they're on out of here the chatters are
6918600	6923200	talking about the Rick roll Akuma JP says oh this is the end of olr that was
6923200	6926080	the moment we jump we jump the shark when we Rick rolled all the listeners
6926080	6932560	there let's see stand in our chat room says Rob should do a karaoke version of
6932560	6935560	the Rick roll song and use his re-recording as a soundbit for the show
6935560	6941680	when he wants to fuck sound with fuck around with the audience um no act
6941680	6950280	deaf in our chat room says forever alone see what he did there forever alone back
6950280	6956080	to some news Loki all right so the Skyrim creation kit came out this week
6956080	6963960	with the steam packs and stuff they have a high-resolution texture pack and also
6963960	6973000	there is a portal cameo apparently you can download an add-on that creates the
6973000	6978320	space core visiting your game it crashes into it really just goes to show glados
6978320	6985720	makes everything better and and space space core can be used to craft a helmet
6985720	6992240	that looks like one of the cores as well that is so awesome it really should have
6992240	6995560	a thing on the PC where then once you do that quest you get like a costume in
6995560	7002880	portal 2 for the little dudes and co-op you know there's also a rumor thanks to
7002880	7006920	someone that was digging around some of the console commands that there's a
7006920	7013400	quest that's tied to all that too that they haven't unlocked yet that's awesome
7013400	7019400	um some other cool stuff I want to see our eyes I saw on there they had a mod
7019400	7024160	that someone made that it was a giant horse and a bunch of people like you
7024160	7027720	know whacking at it with you know swords and stuff like that and they named you
7027720	7031760	know Bethesda and valve and stuff like that and it was the arrow and the knee
7031760	7035640	thing you know they're beating a dead horse huh
7035640	7042440	Wow okay that's some intellectual humor there right but one of the things so one
7042440	7046160	of the most popular mods that's actually available on this creation kit service
7046160	7051020	is something that removes that arrow in the need line from the game so that you
7051020	7056120	don't have to ever hear that brilliant now the interesting thing about this is
7056120	7060360	that modding was being done a long time before this even came out yeah now it's
7060360	7064400	like you know officially embraced but if I know this because I was playing I was
7064400	7068200	what I wasn't playing I was watching Alan play Skyrim and he zoomed his
7068200	7072440	character out I'm like Alan why is your person not wearing any clothes
7072440	7076360	whatsoever I can see her titties I can see her titties and I can see her butt
7076360	7083920	and Alan's just like no this was legitimately Alan's reaction oh I knew I
7083920	7089440	forgot to put the armor on I am playing possibly one of the sluttiest games of
7089440	7095040	Skyrim ever everyone is modded to be like not naked but just and they're in
7095040	7098960	you know Norway or whatever they all look very cold but yeah everyone's very
7098960	7104040	sexy and it's some of the some of the male armors that I have have the back
7104040	7106760	piece missing so they're just their asses hanging out and I'm like this is
7106760	7110680	hot and they're beating on the dragon like with this ass hanging out yeah but
7110680	7114520	there's a lot of like stuff that you could do but it required you to move
7114520	7118000	files and something that the creation kit kind of simplifies all that with
7118000	7122120	they have a launcher and you basically okay I want this this this this go and
7122120	7129520	that's why they for anyone playing Skyrim on PC you absolutely have to get
7129520	7135840	at least sky UI it's a complete UI an inventory replacer and also I think it's
7135840	7140800	called categorized favorites menu it completely changes the UI which I hated
7140800	7144520	originally and it's like a different game super awesome
7144520	7150600	all right unannounced Alan cameo thank you no don't be don't apologize it's
7150600	7153360	like the minute he heard Skyrim he's like I should come out and make a
7153360	7159120	sandwich I should take a break from Skyrim to go talk about Skyrim right hey
7159120	7164920	I heard you like Skyrim so here's some Skyrim while you're sky rimming I really
7164920	7170440	do wanna I want to get it for my laptop here but I'm playing it on my PC or my
7170440	7174920	PSR no kids read that 360 right now I love that they did the higher resolution
7174920	7179800	textures I wish I wish they had that like you know how the outfield through I
7179800	7184120	understand that for PC oh but I said yeah you know how like battlefield 3 had
7184120	7188240	a thing where you can install high-res textures to your hard drive I wish they
7188240	7192320	have that for like the 360 that would be pretty awesome I understand why they
7192320	7195880	don't but you know Tiger Claw in our chat room says I'm sure the furries are
7195880	7198600	messing around with the Skyrim mods you'd be surprised the stuff you can
7198600	7204280	find and it's not safe for work so basically someone has turned Skyrim in
7204280	7207080	his second life am I understanding this correctly
7207080	7213200	act-def says I want Skyrim so I can mod it with my little pony stuff I you know
7213200	7217560	they have that already as much as I I love having Skyrim on the PlayStation
7217560	7220720	3 is gonna use my controller and all that I have to admit I am somewhat
7220720	7227780	starting to regret not getting it on PC the minute I saw that macho man dragon
7227780	7234640	mod if you had a J tag you can do that well wasn't the PlayStation supposed to
7234640	7238960	get some of the popular community mods at some point yeah yeah they had that
7238960	7242280	whole steam integration think that they use for one game that was fucking awesome
7242280	7247920	I think though I think but we now that modding is officially embraced and now
7247920	7251160	that things can be officially signed off by Bethesda maybe that's a possibility
7251160	7256580	down the line I don't know maybe not gonna happen I don't know never say
7256580	7261800	never there'll be a fee but never say never and well the other thing I was
7261800	7268560	gonna say is you know I don't know if you saw but like they had a whole a I
7268560	7274280	don't know what they called it was a Bethesda kind of hey team members make
7274280	7279400	whatever you want during a week and then show us what you have for Skyrim so they
7279400	7282960	were able to make whatever mod they want and they came up with a whole bunch of
7282960	7287280	cool shit that they could have could have thrown in there but oh we couldn't
7287280	7291380	give them another week to do what they want you know because that would be you
7291380	7297800	know too awesome they have like Spears they had a giant enemy crab yeah and
7297800	7304160	giant enemy crab all sorts of you know improvements seasonal changes stuff like
7304160	7308080	that it's just amazing Lee there's some silence to one in our
7308080	7315320	chat room says Oda Ving is rainbow bright best mod right there what I guess
7315320	7321120	you can change one of the characters in a rainbow bright why have naked people
7321120	7329320	when you can have 80s cartoon nostalgia why not have both you're sick well I'm
7329320	7332120	not saying rainbow brain has to be naked but you can have naked people and you
7332120	7335640	can have rainbow bright I don't know I don't know I feel awkward this is an
7335640	7339160	awkward covers I want to be able to have all these different dragons like I want
7339160	7342200	to have a macho man dragon I want to have these you know my little pony
7342200	7345280	dragon I want to have I don't know what other dragons they have out there and
7345280	7349040	you know maybe you know maybe a family got Peter Griffin dragon or something
7349040	7354480	like that or I want to have a mod that makes one of my companions Loki and he
7354480	7358160	always just yells he's really like he always gets really irritated like why
7358160	7363240	are you doing that and then it kids like shout and they can shout and knock
7363240	7369640	people away I'd be awesome all right I don't know why Loki didn't have this
7369640	7372360	story because it's more relevant to his interest but I'll read it and then Loki
7372360	7377000	can react to it eat sleep play who is the developer behind twisted metal which
7377000	7380120	you know remember the series was like big back in the day and now it's all
7380120	7383440	nostalgic against I don't even know what they're doing with this game to be honest
7383440	7387840	there's a there's a new one coming out like what this week I do want to get it
7387840	7393440	but we'll see maybe I'll get it well according to the Salt Lake City Tribune
7393440	7398720	David Jaff is not with eat sleep play anymore he left the company and he's off
7398720	7405080	to pursue casual games yes that worked so well the last time he responded and
7405080	7409800	called it highly exaggerated but he didn't deny that he left so apparently
7409800	7414120	there's been reductions and all this stuff David Jaff did confirm that
7414120	7418000	following the release of twisted metal he is going to step away from eat sleep
7418000	7422760	play there have been layoffs these this affects the offices in Utah which is
7422760	7428760	interesting because David Jaff lives in California but he did mention that the
7428760	7434240	directing a game from a distance and all that did take its toll so that's not
7434240	7438640	good when the game I mean well I don't know I it's easy to sit here and say oh
7438640	7442680	that looks bad but at the same time it's also very common in the industry when a
7442680	7447800	game is done for there to be layoffs so but I guess this means they aren't
7447800	7453520	starting work on a sequel right away he said there's gonna be no DLC zero DLC
7453520	7457160	for it interesting I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing I
7457160	7459720	mean part of me is like well doing good it's all on the disc but then I'm like
7459720	7462320	oh wait maybe it's bad because that means they're just putting it out there
7462320	7466400	yeah there's gonna be aside from like I think the pre-order bonus that you can
7466400	7472120	get you know for me a prior in the game aside from that there is going to be no
7472120	7477280	DLC for twisted mill none they're just sticking around long enough to do like
7477280	7482400	any game balancing and bugs that may they've they may not have caught and
7482400	7491520	that's it once that patch is done they're done interesting all right well
7491520	7496720	there's that so we'll see what this game has in store I don't know I'm not
7496720	7500400	hearing good things about it which is kind of disappointing Loki you're still
7500400	7506600	gonna get in on it just because you love the old ones we'll see all right let's

7604520	7608240	one of the following a a romantic game a game with a realistic portrayal of
7608240	7611520	romance that is pulled off in a convincing manner not something where
7611520	7615160	the characters are driven by wanting to engage in hot monkey sex rather a game
7615160	7618280	where the characters are motivated by wanting to engage in a truly enriching
7618280	7623800	enriching romantic relationship or be a game to play while drunk a game that is
7623800	7627120	ideal to play while you are drunk drunk drunk drunk drunk not a game to play

7703840	7707680	pulled off in a convincing manner really not where the characters are driven by
7707680	7713800	wanting to engage in hot monkey sex I'm trying to think of any like I got to say
7713800	7722700	hot monkey sex a lot there's there's like there's a the Tokimeki games donkey

7743560	7749800	while you're drunk plate irritating stick move next email I like
7749800	7753880	entertainment the get the chatters are kind of agreeing with the Catherine
7753880	7762320	selection okay this is from the ECA put out a call to action to discover state
7762320	7767920	laws relating to EULA they used some of the verbiage from my previous inquiry to
7767920	7771720	Maryland's consumer protection office blows what appears to be another canned
7771720	7775360	response and only the first two sentences seem remotely related to my
7775360	7780260	email what makes this cool is letter I sent to OLR a couple of months which
7780260	7784960	Jamie read was used as a basis for the official ECA letter you see I confirmed
7784960	7788120	that they liked parts of the letter enough to include in their letter this
7788120	7791660	is the first time I ever influenced something so countrywide but also Canada
7791660	7796400	except of course OLR mailbag which is clearly worldwide the goal of this
7796400	7799580	letter-writing campaign is to establish what the current laws for each state are
7799580	7803880	and then maybe we can start talking about changing it I suggest sending the
7803880	7808400	ECA letter to your state legislators as well as the Attorney General of your
7808400	7812480	respective state this may boil down to actually having to hire a business law
7812480	7821600	lawyer to find out and that's from rubber so his email was used in the his
7821600	7826840	letter was basically turned into the form letter for the ECA go you you a
7826840	7835860	celebrity a winner is you you like Whitney I mean stop it right now party
7835860	7841840	fell okay we have two emails left two more emails shut up I'm the one reading
7841840	7847880	them I've been seeing a lot of forum members upset at Sony not bringing the
7847880	7851760	UMD transfer program to North America forgive me if I'm oversimplifying this
7851760	7855680	or misunderstanding something they're upset because they have to pay Sony to
7855680	7859720	repurchase the content they already bought on UMD as Vita digital contact
7859720	7862320	instead of having to pay Sony to repurchase the contact they already
7862320	7867800	bought on UMD as Vita digital content well they wanted the discount I'll be it
7867800	7872840	for slightly less in some cases if the UMD game has a digital version and the
7872840	7877320	publisher is participating as for me I'm not really in the market for another
7877320	7881240	handheld quite yet I did get a PSP for Christmas been on my list for a while

7907760	7914680	but we also have a PSP so greetings olr it's your friendly neighborhood turtle I
7914680	7918160	have a somewhat odd question please don't take this the wrong way your show
7918160	7922240	is my absolute favorite among video game podcasts hence my question can you
7922240	7927480	mention any other video game podcasts that you like or listen to the caveat I
7927480	7931920	want to know about other shows besides what's on the all games network I used
7931920	7935400	to like Derek but there's way too much cursing for my liking why do I like oh
7935400	7939760	why do I ask all our this question wait a minute though I do like oh alert I know
7939760	7944640	I was gonna say hold on cuz we curse a lot on this show so that I okay okay I
7944640	7953160	need to step it up what the fuck is your problem dude well I'm a carpenter and
7953160	7957000	choose to work by myself all day and need good stuff to listen to which means
7957000	7960600	that every Monday morning I start out my week with olr but by lunch I'm out of
7960600	7965280	video game related material any shows that you'd like I'm sure to like keep up
7965280	7968880	the best podcast on air you guys are a great way to start out each week also
7968880	7972320	being on the right coast I never knew what pinkberry is but after looking at
7972320	7976720	their website I am extremely jealous you guys are awesome your loyal turtle in
7976720	7979720	Philly serious turtle it's sort of God we need to start charging for all the
7979720	7984840	product placement we just give away on this show thank me um well thank you I
7984840	7987600	mean that's that's quite the compliment I don't see that as a negative at all
7987600	7990480	that they're looking at us for recommendations for other shows because
7990480	7995880	I'm looking at my like the ultimate compliment see here's the thing I listen
7995880	7999400	to a lot of stuff that's not video game related whatsoever and the stuff that is
7999400	8004160	video game related is kind of all game shows yeah you mentioned Derek's dead
8004160	8006880	pixel a lot I think that's what he was talking about that because alive I you
8006880	8009960	know that's a good I like it I don't think there's that I like fantastic
8009960	8016200	forum uh-huh I I really like video game outsiders yeah and they they have a they
8016200	8020720	have a rhythm very similar to ours um not so much lately I think they I think
8020720	8024040	they've been challenged because I think the hosts are starting to kind of go
8024040	8028320	their own ways but when they're together it's a good time and John does his best
8028320	8035240	to keep it together I listen to Horde house well Horde house no comment right
8035240	8039880	now but there there's gonna be some things changing I think um let's see
8039880	8044680	other video game podcasts of course Bobby black wolf of course that's just a
8044680	8049040	given we like him but he has an updated podcast feed in a while
8049040	8052960	naughty boy so even if I told you to listen to him you couldn't get his
8052960	8059040	newest shows stuff that's off the all games network there's not a lot of video
8059040	8062600	game podcasts that I've actually see here's the thing are you well I try to
8062600	8065880	listen to others and I don't like them so I don't want to name them but there's
8065880	8069200	one in particular I really tried to listen to and I just and it's an
8069200	8072400	independent show so that's what I really want to support other independent shows
8072400	8078280	but we'll say it's a it was a very slickly produced independent show and
8078280	8083400	the person behind it does a lot of podcasts on iTunes but I just wasn't
8083400	8089440	in um it's a video podcast but I guess so that wouldn't really work but I like
8089440	8096000	occasionally watching episodes of the Ben Heck show well I'll throw on some of
8096000	8100920	the video game YouTube ones when I when I was at work I would check out the
8100920	8108080	angry video game nerd on my phone just by plugging in on YouTube and I like
8108080	8111480	classic game room that was one of my favorites let me give a shout out to a
8111480	8114320	few that I'm subscribed to that I actually whipped out my phone and I'm

8288000	8294560	gonna teach you something that in video game ones so but hopefully this help and
8294560	8302560	that was last email all right anyhow let's move on past the mailbag this is
8302560	8306640	the part of the show where we get angsty sometimes we get a little bit angry here
8306640	8309800	at orange launch radio and we do a segment called the F use of the week so
8309800	8325560	here it is
8325560	8331160	fu to the increased cost of tuition and people who only want you to have a
8331160	8339400	bachelor's degree and fu to all the morons driving with their lights off in
8339400	8343720	the rain and not signaling in the rain

8471640	8475640	than it was a Black Friday and just stupid people jumping in front of cars
8475640	8479560	driving slowly it got to the point we drove around the parking lot twice
8479560	8483840	couldn't find a place to park went up to the second floor of the parking
8483840	8488360	structure where nobody ever parks every space if there was taken and I said fuck
8488360	8492720	it and went home park across the street that's what I used to do we park at
8492720	8496520	Hooters oh no in that lot where nobody there's like fucking nothing there now
8496520	8501040	huh yep where they used to have the club the nightclub yeah exactly used to park
8501040	8505080	across the street right there next to the sidewalk hit the crosswalk by the
8505080	8509240	time you like cross the street and stuff you'll it seriously I used to go to
8509240	8514200	Virgin over there it was awesome I'm a mega store yeah sad
8514200	8518200	it's urban outfitters now it's all right urban outfit like some of their shirts

8535480	8539400	right anyhow and then the internet all right let's move on more news and
8539400	8543320	skype line coming up very soon Twitter topics as well tons of fun stuff coming
8543320	8546680	up very very very very soon Loki yeah I was gonna say fuck you to your parking
8546680	8551860	lot too cuz I have a park in like the mill nowhere the hike back to my car if
8551860	8558560	I remember where it is so call duty elite it's pretty popular for Activision
8558560	8565720	they've have 7 million users using the elite service on the 1.5 million have
8565720	8572080	actually paid the you know $60 for or $50 I think it is for all the free well
8572080	8577920	plenty of the paid for the download content so $50 times 100 or 1.5 million
8577920	8584800	times that's a lot of fucking money 75 million dollars and people thought who
8584800	8588280	would want to sign up for this service well to be honest if you're gonna pay
8588280	8592920	for the download content you're actually saving money with that service and if
8592920	8596260	you play a lot of Call of Duty that might be worth it to you I mean the
8596260	8600560	maps don't look bad I just don't play Call of Duty modern warfare 3 so I don't
8600560	8605920	use the service at all now I don't think it ties in with modern warfare so the
8605920	8613880	first one it does it looks like it's doing well for them they made lots of
8613880	8617400	money do you are they gonna do another one of those Expos this year like they
8617400	8620560	did last year they might I don't know this didn't that do really well for him
8620560	8624440	too because there's no BlizzCon this year but there might be the whole Call
8624440	8628840	of Duty con or what did they call that like the I forget the name somebody in
8628840	8633080	shadow yell it out but they did like a day long event remember so I could see
8633080	8638240	them I mean I could see them doing that so because it worked out you know pretty
8638240	8642520	well for them of course there's gonna be another call it yeah I saw yeah they
8642520	8645120	announced that they're gonna make another Call of Duty game you don't even
8645120	8649040	have to put that in the fucking you do not have to announce that at all that it
8649040	8654640	was part of their you know their financial report or something like that
8654640	8657200	that they're making new Call of Duty game of course they're gonna fucking
8657200	8660720	make a new Call of Duty game it's news when they say we're not making the Call
8660720	8665800	of Duty game we're not having a BlizzCon I mean it's just you know you don't even
8665800	8668680	need to report that people just make the assumption that there's gonna be a new
8668680	8672640	Call of Duty game coming out speaking of that Activision Blizzard earnings call
8672640	8675680	that happened this week very surprising that they announced there's no release
8675680	8679280	date still for Diablo 3 which we thought for sure we'd have that by the end of
8679280	8682960	next month but now it's looking like no cute summertime Q2 is what they're
8682960	8686840	saying if America will Starcraft not a Starcraft
8686840	8692320	probably buggy Starcraft I'm in the beta it's great well then I they just hate
8692320	8698680	you clearly Starcraft is you know launched in the end of July so that was
8698680	8705720	kind of an odd time for it I mean less yeah no no date well speaking of Diablo
8705720	8709980	3 my next story happens to be about Diablo 3 Bashiach who's the community
8709980	8714120	manager over at Blizzard was answering some questions and it wasn't about
8714120	8718640	Warcraft this time it was about Diablo 3 they say Diablo 3 it is still slated for
8718640	8722720	2012 but now they're saying that Diablo 3 is only going to support up to four
8722720	8727160	players even though there is five classes now that's four player co-op
8727160	8732680	they haven't said anything about a five player mode in the game Bashiach said
8732680	8735520	that Blizzard is not looking into it and they're not going to expand their player
8735520	8740680	cap no idea as to why they did that interesting because in World of Warcraft
8740680	8746400	you have if I'm not mistaken you have 10 classes and raids are 10 people or 25 or
8746400	8750680	you know but most you know the end game content is geared towards that although
8750680	8755400	you would find very very very few raid groups that have one of each class very
8755400	8761320	few Diablo 3 also will not have built-in voice chat at launch Blizzard wants to
8761320	8766360	make sure the voice chat is going to be worth it the wow voice chat leaves a lot
8766360	8771200	to be desired so it turned a lot of people to you know team speak ventrilo
8771200	8775640	mumble so Diablo 3 is going to have to do the same thing they're also one of
8775640	8779120	the thing Diablo 3 is not going to be getting any more visual treatment than
8779120	8783040	what you're already seeing there is no higher resolution textures in the final
8783040	8786280	game that's the official word from Bashiach I still thought the game looked
8786280	8790600	good enough on look in fact to look great on the beta so I don't think they
8790600	8793920	necessarily need to make it that much better you know again part of the charm
8793920	8797520	of Diablo is that you know be able to be played on a variety of systems if you
8797520	8800680	want to be able to find four people to co-op with I'm still really looking
8800680	8804160	forward to Diablo 3 despite all this I just wish it would come out already I
8804160	8807520	get a free copy because I signed the Blizzard blood pact for World of
8807520	8813280	Warcraft because I have problems few more news stories for you guys and then
8813280	8817360	the Twitter topics in the skype line dark soccer well did you ever watching
8817360	8823240	that pac-man show in the 80s I can I do that's where pac-man had legs right yeah
8823240	8827560	yes I do remember that well I also the pac-land game was based off of that too
8827560	8832880	and I used to also watch that in cupid but Hannah Barbara put it out well
8832880	8838680	they're four seasons coming out on DVD it's a two-disc 13 episode collection
8838680	8845560	where it has inky and blinky pinky Clyde and Sue and mesmer on who wants to take
8845560	8854200	over pac-land and has vampire pakula and all kinds of yeah I forgot about
8854200	8858040	pac-land that was a really interesting game it was kind of like a side
8858040	8863720	scroller pac-man I have it yeah no I've it's in those Namco collections like the
8863720	8867720	you know the ones that tend to come out on every system but I used to I also
8867720	8870600	remember the Christmas special where Santa came down they had no idea what a
8870600	8878840	human was yeah nice I had the pac-man board game growing up and it had like a
8878840	8883520	million marbles it was all these fucking marbles that were little pellets I have
8883520	8888080	the bedsheets awesome I bet it had remember miss pac-man was called pepper
8888080	8895160	and there was pac-baby yeah nice I like super pac-man dude the arcade game for
8895160	8903920	super pac-man is awesome anyhow Loki you know it's always great when you start
8903920	8910880	off the story with a sigh it should not be a surprise that they're making
8910880	8916080	another Skylanders game I mean really didn't you say this game was gonna tank
8916080	8921800	yeah it should have tanked I underestimated how stupid the average
8921800	8927440	consumer is my mistake and you know what if you bought this game you have
8927440	8931760	yourself to blame this is why you're gonna get fucking expensive down I do I
8931760	8936560	do not want to hear another fucking thing about oh those map packs are call
8936560	8940880	of duty are too expensive this is your fucking fault for buying
8940880	8947320	Skylanders this is why no more can you complain about DLC costs or the quantity
8947320	8954080	so yes Skylanders Giants because hey how can we make Skylanders better I don't
8954080	8959120	notice make larger figures that we could charge more for sounds like a plan bigger
8959120	8966360	is better people will buy them because they're consumer whores and how so yes
8966360	8971400	Skylanders Giants will be coming out later this year I think also for the Wii
8971400	8976200	U probably at some point and I gotta be honest by looking at the screenshots
8976200	8982560	which this game itself kinda looks like it could have been on the GameCube or
8982560	8988520	the PlayStation 2 I mean pretty cheap I've heard good things about the game
8988520	8992240	itself just the game not all this extra crap at the game itself I've heard
8992240	8997200	decent things as a decent dungeon crawler it looks pretty cheap anyways so
8997200	9001000	you can't go off the only the only thing they're changing is they're adding these
9001000	9006280	giant fucking characters that do stuff and their money but hey guess what
9006280	9009640	they're not going to force you to buy another goddamn portal you can still use
9009640	9013080	your old portal so they're just gonna be twice as many skews I got a fucking set
9013080	9019760	up thank God for that and it's so we're gonna have these giant fucking portal
9019760	9024160	characters that you have to use with your regular Skylanders characters and
9024160	9028240	I'm sure they're gonna have more characters go along with that and yeah
9028240	9032320	so that's fantastic and I want to say they were the number one accessory item
9032320	9040760	for games this month so congrats to you Skylanders for me I'm selling a lot and
9040760	9044440	then of course there's going to be some Toys R Us exclusive items because they
9044440	9050240	have signed a fucking blood pact with Activision to pimp these two children so
9050240	9055720	once again I hope you're happy because you you folks that purchase Skylanders
9055720	9059720	are going to be the downfall of the gaming industry when the inevitable
9059720	9063000	video game crash happens was by the way there's big rumblings we're headed
9063000	9066440	towards another video game crash because think about it if the Wii U and the Vita
9066440	9071280	don't do very well it could lead to another crash and if the Wii U and the
9071280	9074720	Vita don't do well people are just going to buy games the PlayStation 3 and the
9074720	9080600	Xbox 360 oh the world will end but I don't know things I'm reading I don't
9080600	9084360	think anything could ever happen to the extent that it happened with Atari but
9084360	9088360	if you look at the sales dude sales this January were way down compared to a year
9088360	9093880	ago there's nothing coming out in January I'm not surprised they had they
9093880	9097960	had one week of sales because all the game releases for January came out the
9097960	9100760	last still have holdovers and people using their gift cards and all that
9100760	9105080	but see normally January like last year January they had Darksiders which came
9105080	9110080	out like in the first week they had Bayonetta they had actually been under
9110080	9114120	my bed in the year before it was I think I think Bayonetta was a year before okay
9114120	9122400	well one of these January's had Darksiders and Bayonetta and you know
9122400	9124880	Alan was saying to me the other day why haven't they announced a sequel to
9124880	9132400	Bayonetta yet it's a very good question it did well then of course there's a
9132400	9136760	whole a Metal Gear game that now is basically no Metal Gear Bayonetta the
9136760	9144520	Metal Gear game will come out eventually rebooted it totally rebooted it alright
9144520	9150440	so yes Skylander Giants hip hip hooray one more story for you guys here and
9150440	9154120	then we're gonna go to the Skype line and this one is also going to start off
9154120	9161080	with a sigh sorry I gotta interrupt real quick here so yeah remember how I was
9161080	9164800	saying that they're gonna have some exclusive stuff some of the characters
9164800	9168080	they've run out of you know they have the legendary characters which sell for
9168080	9171880	a lot more on eBay that's how you know how they're special and also they have
9171880	9176840	now iridescent blue characters so they're like and we're not even gonna
9176840	9180760	paint this one we're just gonna make it clear plastic and people spend more
9180760	9187960	money for it alright I got one more story for you guys then we're gonna get
9187960	9191120	to the sky plane and your Twitter topics so just a reminder here's your last
9191120	9198560	chance to get those Twitter topics into twitter.com slash o LR this story is
9198560	9207200	about another sigh huge sigh Ubisoft I I can't with this this is the whole DRM
9207200	9211000	thing okay and you know they've gotten a lot of shit about this whole I thought
9211000	9216520	they I thought that Ubisoft got rid of this DRM when the people started being
9216520	9219880	up in arms about it but I guess that was just like moving forward and what I'm
9219880	9223200	talking about is the whole you have to be online to play the game and if you
9223200	9227000	get kicked offline you get kicked out of the game well what happened is that
9227000	9231520	Ubisoft had to do an online server switch this past week and it locked
9231520	9235680	people out of the games now granted they warned people you know this is gonna be
9235680	9239080	happening so you won't be able to play your fucking game for a day the game
9239080	9242840	that you bought it won't work for a day because we were too lazy to have a
9242840	9247760	backup server in place or however these technical things work meaning driver
9247760	9253160	San Francisco and so forth was unable to be signed into however driver San
9253160	9256280	Francisco was not one of the games that Ubisoft originally said you will not be
9256280	9261360	able to play so extra games got taken down on top of what Ubisoft originally
9261360	9266840	said some games were still okay like Just Dance 3 and settlers online via
9266840	9270400	Twitter Ubisoft says we apologize for the inconvenience it seems some of you
9270400	9274440	can't connect to games announced as playable during migration we're on it
9274440	9278200	and we'll keep you posted here in related news those that pirated these
9278200	9285560	games experience no issues I don't think Just Dance would be part of it because
9285560	9290840	that's not I think I think it was after the fact to no one gets to wiggle their
9290840	9294280	but how about Assassin's Creed revelations there you go I think it's
9294280	9301320	only PC tiles yeah so but but am I correct in saying Ubisoft does not not
9301320	9307840	do this anymore right they will they don't care you're still gonna buy the
9307840	9311840	next Assassin's Creed game people you're not gonna remember that they even did
9311840	9315560	this I'm not but then again I hadn't bought by any of the others like does
9315560	9319160	anyone remember the snafu with the whole like PlayStation Network where they
9319160	9323720	they forgot to calculate a date correctly or something like that and so
9323720	9330560	it knocked everything offline for like a day no one remembers that that's true
9330560	9333640	that's true I remember the big fuss people made about that I wonder how many
9333640	9337200	people forgot about the PlayStation hack by now I'm sure a lot of people have
9337200	9343480	already forgotten a whole little PlayStation Network thing all right we
9343480	9349000	are about ready to go to the skype line so go ahead one eight seven seven game OLR

9376680	9381000	gonna call into orange lounge radio now we've been chatting a little bit this
9381000	9383360	week so I think I think it's really cool that you're actually you're actually

9388000	9392120	it thanks for that he introduced me to OLR and I'm loving it so far thank you
9392120	9396280	so much thank you Stan now for those that don't know who you are is there a
9396280	9400640	place where folks may or may not have been seeing you this week yes um I
9400640	9406000	actually appeared on the new season of the tester on the PlayStation Network I
9406000	9410640	can't believe it guys after all this okay I I don't know if you know about
9410640	9413800	some of our running jokes if Stan feels you in about the tester but when I
9413800	9418360	originally gave my review on the tester season one way back when I talked about
9418360	9423280	the tester and I actually said the tester is not bad like it's it's it's
9423280	9426600	not like a great freakin show it's not like you know you're gonna be watching
9426600	9431120	The Walking Dead or something but right as far as reality TV goes as far as a
9431120	9436600	lot of the old g4 shows go the tester is not bad but as I'm talking about this
9436600	9440360	Jamie's cat because we were doing the show at her house Shermie took a big
9440360	9448040	dump all over the floor and so I think well there's Shermie's review well
9448040	9451600	actually it's quite fitting because for those that might have seen the first
9451600	9456880	episode Quajimonster gotten some deep shit literally because she started
9456880	9462160	talking about farting and shitting and yeah what works what is up with this
9462160	9466360	okay I gotta say I made a tweet right after I watched the first episode cuz
9466360	9471040	you I look I love video games and I love trashy reality TV so I'm not gonna lie I
9471040	9474560	did watch the tester all right judge me all you want I don't give a fuck all
9474560	9483360	right it's not as bad as being on the tester trust me wow we've got to get
9483360	9487360	into this a little bit but okay okay but here's the thing I'm watching it and I'm
9487360	9492240	like these they all have potty mouths it was like watching there was an episode
9492240	9498160	of South Park called it hits the fan where they hype up in the whole episode
9498160	9502120	dude they're gonna say shit on Chicago hope tonight they're gonna say shit and
9502120	9506960	then like it turns into they say one shit to now it's like mush shit TV and
9506960	9510320	they say the word shit like 200 times and I'm watching the first episode of
9510320	9517320	tester and I hear shit dropped like literally 1520 times during the show my
9517320	9522800	game you hear me go that's bullshit and there's there is an awesome story about
9522800	9527480	that it's in regards to what somebody said so might stop by next week to talk
9527480	9530720	about it it's a good story but yeah there's a lot of shit being dropped left
9530720	9535120	and right Wow but yet they bleep fuck I don't know sorry to the guy who didn't
9535120	9538760	like cursing I'm very sorry but you know it's just look they say it on PlayStation
9538760	9543360	Network all right yeah for real you you were actually on the tester and it's
9543360	9553160	funny because we joked about getting dark soccer to apply next year I applied
9553160	9557080	a little bit of a whim and I actually the reason I decided to go for the
9557080	9564080	tester was way back when sci-fi did WCG ultimate gamer I said why not I'll try I
9564080	9568000	made it to like the final 42 people and didn't make that show because apparently
9568000	9572960	I wasn't like cool enough so screw them and then the tester started applying or
9572960	9576880	started the application process for season three I said why not next I know
9576880	9580440	I'm getting a phone call saying yeah we're flying you out to Los Angeles and
9580440	9584720	you're gonna be on the tester like oh shit you just got picked like there
9584720	9588960	wasn't a lot of like screening and whittling down there's it's the whole
9588960	9593720	process starts in about there started about mid August I want to say and I put
9593720	9597800	up a profile really quickly I said you know I need to think of what what's
9597800	9602360	gonna get me noticed I figured okay how many people are the combination of a
9602360	9610120	chemist plays roller derby and has like a trophy level of 18 not many so I use
9610120	9614340	that and then within a day of putting that up I had a producer calling me say
9614340	9618080	hey you want to do some interviews with you check you out and then the Skype
9618080	9624040	interview had to wait a month of like no contact from them and then all of a
9624040	9628480	sudden mid-october I get a call from the executive producer saying yeah you're
9628480	9632080	still in the running here's a contract sign your life away once to do that
9632080	9637980	we'll do another interview and I found out I was flying to LA about mmm four or
9637980	9643360	five days before filming began so it's a long process but just a lot of
9643360	9647440	interviews and waiting but I get the sense that the whole process of
9647440	9651040	recording the show itself is really quick like you know I know there's a lot
9651040	9656680	of TV magic but you know I could kind of tell that they're probably doing like
9656680	9661160	multiple challenges in a day and the whole no actually no really no it's
9661160	9666920	every episode is literally one day of filming huh it's back to back to back
9666920	9671320	to back about like 15 18 hours worth of filming crammed into one little half
9671320	9678320	hour Wow there's a lot of awesomeness but they try to keep the drama and my
9678320	9682080	case a picture of a cockroach trying to go like ass to mouth to me which was
9682080	9686640	great now because I know Loki and don't start a dark soccer don't watch the
9686640	9691240	tester this week the challenge no no no I saw do you watch I was a night and I
9691240	9696960	had a joke ready too so basically I'm like say be glad that they're just you
9696960	9700940	know you know they're they're doing the analogy where it's you know you have to
9700940	9704560	keep your head in a case of bugs you know because you're squashing bugs or
9704560	9708200	whatever thank God you're not testing for Bethesda where you'd have to jump in
9708200	9713200	a fun swimming pool full of cockroaches well the thing is if you're testing for
9713200	9716300	Bethesda there would be no bugs because apparently they don't see them when they
9716300	9720000	test them they just leave them in the game you know my honest-to-god reaction
9720000	9723280	when I saw that on the show though I said dark soccer would have been first
9723280	9729320	out she would have been first out she put your hand no they had to they had to
9729320	9733000	have their head in this case full of bugs and they're pouring cockroaches
9733000	9737440	because because they wanted to see who can interview under pressure and I was
9737440	9742640	like dark soccer would have been telling that guy off like I put my head no bugs
9742640	9748160	well what's funny is like we have our this one guy Jay Titan he's this big
9748160	9752400	rough-and-tough trash talk and like knows the shit and then as soon as we
9752400	9757600	find out it's the roaches we go back into the loft as they're doing us they're
9757600	9762440	doing each person for the challenge one at a time he starts freaking out back in
9762440	9769400	the loft like scream I quit and he was probably one of the next to last people
9769400	9773160	to go and all of us are coming back oh it's fine you'll be fine he's almost
9773160	9778480	starting to like shake from nervousness he's that terrified of bugs so that
9778480	9781200	would have been me I would have been crying I would have been screaming I
9781200	9784040	would have been threatening calls to my lawyer but then I would have just done
9784040	9787680	it you know I would have been like alright just fucking get in the zone
9787680	9790080	don't think about it don't think about it don't think I'm fucking thinking
9790080	9794840	about it don't think about it like the hardest part was just well for me I the
9794840	9798920	way they fell down my hair started going in my face so I had like at one point
9798920	9802400	almost a dozen roaches just checking out my face like you know I'm gonna sit
9802400	9805800	right in front of her so she can't see anything you know it would freak them
9805800	9811200	out you start munching off actually actually we were totally weren't allowed
9811200	9815800	to eat them ah there was like this roach wrangler or this guy that owned the
9815800	9819680	roaches and they were his like precious little babies and we couldn't do any
9819680	9823840	harm to him what was his name Joe and did he have an apartment I wouldn't be
9823840	9828400	surprised if it's probably him the only one that remembers Joe's apartment I
9828400	9832920	remember Joe's apartment singing roaches so I I have to I I know there's probably
9832920	9835240	tons you want to talk about but of course I I'm gonna steer the
9835240	9840800	conversation but I'm take over I felt bad for the girl they sent home I get
9840800	9845280	oh I shouldn't ruin it for those that watched it my bad but I I like that the
9845280	9849680	person that they sent home seemed I don't agree with that I completely
9849680	9853320	disagree with sending the person they sent home she that person seemed really
9853320	9856640	nice to me and I was like that seemed I'm surprised that person's not
9856640	9859640	listening to OLR cuz like that seemed like the kind of person that would like
9859640	9864000	be like I would be friends with like for real so I kind of felt bad for them
9864000	9870320	she's like she was the one of the coolest cats in the loft I mean like she
9870320	9874280	just the first thing we noticed by her she had this giant like tail that she
9874280	9878480	brought with and okay you're awesome and actually we were aligned or we were
9878480	9881960	getting into the vans to head to the law for filming she originally had on this
9881960	9885120	Voltron t-shirt that they took away from her because you couldn't like have
9885120	9890320	copyrighted material that wasn't first party Sony cuz wah wah wah whatever but
9890320	9895080	I'm just looking at going I like her so we spent a good like our just talking
9895080	9900000	about Voltron and it's I was so sad to see her go and considering it was either
9900000	9906000	like the person that either didn't like wasn't memorable the person that talked
9906000	9910320	about shit the whole time but that's home the person talked about shit that
9910320	9913960	that's just me that's reality TV I'm kind of you know I'm kind of looking at
9913960	9918360	it going you know it sounds like you are the real deal you're legit your
9918360	9921900	intentions I mean am I correct you really did want to work for Sony right
9921900	9927280	like oh my god yeah they're in a later episode you'll see just how much I I
9927280	9932960	would have killed or I did I get my dream job it's like I can't really say
9932960	9937320	which way how or which way it fell but right sure no I understand and listeners
9937320	9940440	please do respect that she's under contract can't say if she wins or got
9940440	9948720	told to sashay away sued so yeah all five people that watch the show I mean I
9948720	9952800	don't know like it's kind of a joke that like no one watches the tester but yet
9952800	9958920	here I am I I I admit I watch it and you know I gotta say all joking aside what
9958920	9963160	they're doing there is interesting because it really is the only show right
9963160	9967000	now that I can think of that's produced exclusively for a gaming console you
9967000	9969560	don't have anything like it on Nintendo you don't have anything like it
9969560	9973440	otherwise on Sony you'd certainly don't have anything like it on Xbox especially
9973440	9976200	since one versus a hundred isn't around anymore which was a different kind of
9976200	9982040	thing anyway right but no it it's I mean like I said they originally did that
9982040	9986960	that the BC ultimate gamer but that kind of flopped after two seasons but even
9986960	9991720	then it wasn't entirely Xbox I think season two had some we crap in it that
9991720	9996400	no one cared about but yeah it's when I tell people that it's exclusively on
9996400	10000240	PlayStation Network you can't download the episodes on your computer via the
10000240	10005800	tester calm or crackle calm but yeah just the fact that it's produced by Sony
10005800	10011200	for Sony promoting Sony it's very unique in that sound so here's a question
10011200	10016680	though Rob is since you mentioned crackle calm crackle they have the
10016680	10022360	actual utility on or the app on the 360 so could you watch a tester on the 360
10022360	10028320	can actually watch the tester on the 360 I've tried it and it is possible so yeah
10028320	10032320	I kind of got a personal kick a lot of that zenacorn our term is do you have to
10032320	10037240	pay to see the tester no it's it's no we free trust me would you want to pay to
10037240	10042920	see the tester I love that you're deprecated I I don't know I again I know
10042920	10045480	you can't tell me which way but the way you talk about it sometimes makes me
10045480	10053040	think it might not a one just looking at the first episode there it's supposed to
10053040	10057000	be a double elimination but it wasn't a little bit of spoiler there but it was a
10057000	10062680	single elimination and with who was clearly supposed to go home when he or
10062680	10069280	she didn't that pissed me off like throwing a little shade Lee bullshit
10069280	10073360	what happened there so I'm getting I'm getting the sense that maybe you're
10073360	10077460	you're still kind of friends with some of these folks like maybe the person we
10077460	10079680	were talking about earlier who got kicked off before their time but maybe
10079680	10088000	not with yeah I we have this like yes I talked she's actually going to a like a
10088000	10093480	giant world cosplay competition so good luck to her but um yeah we have this
10093480	10097200	secret tester we call it the tester lounge on fake book as I call it because
10097200	10103400	Facebook is but yeah like people from all three seasons Brent go keys in it
10103400	10111120	Meredith Adrian side note Meredith knows her shit about games like it surprised
10111120	10115120	all of us how much she knew about it so that was awesome but yeah we we talk all
10115120	10120760	the time and as a matter of fact once the cast was announced Mo chocolate from
10120760	10124600	season 2 reached out to all of us it's like whoa what's up my mo nice to meet
10124600	10129280	you let's video chat on Skype and I'm just going oh my god you're you were
10129280	10133240	you're Mo chocolate and you're talking to me holy crap and we've become the
10133240	10138240	best of friends since then so it's pretty cool that is that is awesome what
10138240	10141000	sounds like you at the end of the day you know no matter what's happening on
10141000	10144120	the show you you good or bad you had a good experience and you met a lot of
10144120	10149000	great people out of it sounds like so oh my god it I it's something that I could
10149000	10154120	never like forget I mean I never thought I would be doing something like that
10154120	10158400	efforts I'm not the most outgoing person I'm a gamer I'm a little bit shy a
10158400	10164040	little bit of a closet dweller but it just blew my mind in terms of
10164040	10169000	awesomeness and oh my god I look on the TV that I've muted and it's Whitney
10169000	10179400	Houston changing that's why people watch the tester to get away from CNN and the
10179400	10185520	witness that's it we need to hang out I had to catch a predator on and then all
10185520	10189400	of a sudden it became Whitney Houston I'm like I can't see the sake but let's
10189400	10193800	turn on something equally that's what I have you know what's funny and I swear
10193800	10197560	I'm not just I I swear I'm not just saying this because I had no idea that
10197560	10200560	you were gonna read like I know Stan had told me like hey I know someone on the
10200560	10204920	show and I was like okay cool like I didn't I guess you guys must be pretty
10204920	10208240	close because here you are actually listening to orange lounge radio but at
10208240	10211440	first I was like oh neat it's kind of fun to know somebody who got to do you
10211440	10215040	know a rare experience like that but when when I saw you specifically on the
10215040	10218960	show I actually thought I was like that's the girl they have instead of
10218960	10224840	dark Sakura I really did I really think that because you guys kind of strike me
10224840	10229400	as having stuff in common so well maybe I'll do it next year if I don't have a
10229400	10238360	job I had a job or have have had a job as a chemist so they even asked me would
10238360	10244560	you be okay with giving up your current job I said hmm work in a lab or work at
10244560	10249560	Santa Monica let me think yes yes I would be okay with that okay thanks I'm
10249560	10255240	a designer so I was like I can do all of your booklets it's a good way to get
10255240	10258400	your foot in the door as I understand the the guy that won the very first
10258400	10263600	season was only like a tester for like what six months and now he's like in
10263600	10269040	marketing or something and I know that guy isn't the whole six months thing is
10269040	10275480	what they don't tell you is it's for a six month contract mmm it's so like
10275480	10279680	kicking the groin cuz after Meredith like tells about the prize that you
10279680	10283400	could win you're all excited and they cut the scene then this one random crew
10283400	10287160	member comes out and they go alright this is just a reminder the prizes you
10287160	10292040	got the ps3 the money the TV blah blah blah blah and just you know the job as a
10292040	10295320	tester is a six-month contract at which point somebody may or may not keep you
10295320	10301240	okay keep filming all going and the same thing for this season it's like the
10301240	10305600	Santa Monica thing six-month contract and then the cars for two-year lease all
10305600	10314920	right let's see some enthusiasm cars going funny Wow no stand in the chat
10314920	10317320	says I'm sure Rob thought I was making stuff up no I didn't think you were
10317320	10320720	making stuff up I just thought you know some like sometimes like you you might
10320720	10324200	know somebody like oh I knew I went to high school with that person and after
10324200	10328440	the six-month period we're gonna have your memory erased just look into this
10328440	10334160	pen let me put on my sunglasses oh god um let's god what else was I gonna ask
10334160	10338480	I know something escapes me I don't know it was just one episodes aired and I'm
10338480	10341400	sure there's plenty more you've really got to bite your tongue on but we'll
10341400	10344680	well hopefully you'll decide to keep listening to olr and we can get some
10344680	10348600	more dirt on the tester I look we're probably the only podcast that talks
10348600	10356400	about this show there's a few out there actually totally don't want to plug it
10356400	10361880	but kind of have to since Greg Miller was a guest judge this season sure he's
10361880	10366040	actually having all of the cast members as they're booted off the show on the
10366040	10370960	beyond podcast so all right whatever I get kicked off or when I win I'll be on
10370960	10374920	there and I'll I'll see if I can put in a well our show for you guys that's
10374920	10379480	awesome see you know you don't have to say the final thing that kept me from
10379480	10384280	applying really was that I don't want to live in LA except for being close to
10384280	10391840	Disneyland well I figured it would be nice to actually like enjoy non sub
10391840	10396040	zero temperatures like I am right now because I'm in Milwaukee not really the
10396040	10400400	best weather capital of the world so I think it'd be a nice change you live
10400400	10404080	relatively close to good friends of ours yeah you live right by these olr
10404080	10410040	lesbians located in Wisconsin in Madison in that case they should come to my
10410040	10414280	roller derby bouts I actually play for the Brew City Bruisers in Milwaukee so
10414280	10418880	if you guys are listening come to our fucking bouts I have a good a really
10418880	10421320	good friend of mine just recently got into that whole roller derby thing and
10421320	10424880	she's loving it you know actually a friend of mine from one of my classes
10424880	10428720	two semesters ago tried to get me into their league in Sacramento Sacramento
10428720	10432640	League yeah I could see however my bad ankle kind of keeps me from doing it
10432640	10437960	don't oh I I have like horrible ankles I actually tore my PCL on my left knee so
10437960	10441960	I have to wear this like Robo Bryce of death and I still do it it's it sounds
10441960	10445640	like you might make me to make quite the scene you know you could be the Android
10445640	10450920	of the scapes pretty much all right well unfortunately I gotta I gotta wrap

10550080	10554880	bedroom y'all I love that she's so delts like self-deprecating about the whole
10554880	10559520	thing like the I and it sounds to me I mean I could be wrong but it sounds to
10559520	10562480	me based on the whole like Facebook group they've got going on or where fake
10562480	10565720	book as she called it that it sounds like they're all kind of in on the joke
10565720	10570120	like yeah you know it's the tester and that's that's pretty awesome you know
10570120	10576560	they they accept it for what it is so that's awesome but I'll tell you what
10576560	10580080	you know what again I and I do stand by this I said this before and I'll say it
10580080	10583960	now the tester it's not a TV show that's going to change your life it's not the
10583960	10587240	best thing on television but you know what for something in the background it
10587240	10591720	is probably more entertaining than a lot of shows that have been about video
10591720	10597000	gaming in the past so there you go 1 8 7 7 game olr or our username on Skype is
10597000	10600760	orange a lounge radio if you want to give us a call you can go for that right
10600760	10603680	now we've got time to take a couple more calls I know that call went on a long
10603680	10607200	time but we'll get at least one or two more other people on the show in the
10607200	10613800	meantime let's read some Twitter topics at twitter.com slash olr 13x4 ever sent
10613800	10618180	us a tweet this week that says hey olr how about five game music albums for
10618180	10623360	whatever price you wish to pay how about 13 plus albums for $10 or more and he's
10623360	10627640	referring to the game music bundle.com it's another one of those indie bundles
10627640	10631680	you know that whole thing's been very popular lately and yeah you can donate
10631680	10636840	their money and get soundtracks so if you're a game music fan it sounds like
10636840	10640080	they have all different types of games included in that and they add more
10640080	10644680	soundtracks as more people donate so interesting let's go to the phones
10644680	10647160	because we have more people calling in hi you're on orange launch radio who's
10647160	10651760	this yo what up guys it's Zina Korp from the UKC how you doing hey Zina Korp from
10651760	10655640	Oklahoma City unless OKC stands for something else what's up you're pretty
10655640	10660400	worried about money hey by the way just want to say the Thunder losing to the
10660400	10666760	Kings dude dude the Thunder lost to the Kings that's do you watch basketball who
10666760	10671800	the hell the Thunder never mind all right never mind that I'll pay tips of
10671800	10675800	that fucking team they paying me fucking let me just say the Thunder right now is
10675800	10679080	the best team in the league and they fucking lost to the Kings the Sacramento
10679080	10682560	King pretty funny everybody here in Sacramento is just laughing cuz like the
10682560	10687280	Kings suck and you guys anyway I won't make this about basketball what's on
10687280	10690720	your mind Zina Korp that much not much just been playing the hell out of League
10690720	10695800	of Legends for some reason you know it's funny you bring that up Twitter asked us
10695800	10699080	a question here about League of Legends so I can kind of tie this together
10699080	10703600	awesome her sent us a tweet said have you guys ever played League of Legends
10703600	10707720	it's an extremely popular free online game that I've never heard you mention
10707720	10710720	on the show which is funny because we did end up mentioning it at the top of
10710720	10714720	the show during the Dota thing but he's right I I personally have not played
10714720	10719000	League of Legends myself but Zina Korp sounds like you're a fan yeah I've been
10719000	10722520	playing it for a while now finally got my account maxed out so I can actually
10722520	10726760	compete with some of the other characters in the game like the whole
10726760	10730480	thing with the multiplayer online battle arenas at least that's the genre it's
10730480	10735800	been labeled as the MOBAs is it since it's all team based there's a lot of
10735800	10740760	rage in there more so than you might see in the first-person shooter so I can
10740760	10743400	only play it for about an hour and then a little 12 year olds get on my nerves
10743400	10746720	but other than that the game itself is pretty fun I can only imagine like the
10746720	10749280	League of Legends one of those games I think I would enjoy more if I just
10749280	10753480	played it with like only people I know but um one thing I do notice is that
10753480	10757560	it's a hugely popular game to be streamed on those video game streaming
10757560	10760960	websites like twitch TV I always see League of Legends stuff going on on
10760960	10764960	there yeah actually started playing Heroes of Newark just because it looked
10764960	10768800	this looks more polished you know cuz they acted the higher resolutions and
10768800	10772600	all this other stuff your interface was better but I couldn't find any like pro
10772600	10776480	content or even games being played so I could learn how to play it but there's
10776480	10780000	tons of League of Legends stuff so I started watching that here here and
10780000	10784080	there like pro coverage and just some guys casting their games because that's
10784080	10787040	how I got into Starcraft is when everybody was casting it during the beta
10787040	10790880	and I'd started playing it out and once I figured out how it worked it was
10790880	10793820	pretty fun it's the only really competitive game that I play so I'm
10793820	10796840	pretty much done with first-person shooters as far as I'm concerned let me
10796840	10799280	back up a minute because this is the question I should have asked you first
10799280	10802220	like for those that aren't familiar with League of Legends this ossifer kind of
10802220	10806520	insinuates we are in on the Twitter what what is what makes this game addicting
10806520	10809840	what makes you stick it out through the 12 year olds as long as you can for this
10809840	10813620	okay so you're familiar with the interface that Starcraft and them use
10813620	10817220	right so you got your your mouse control you're right-clicking on things moving
10817220	10820700	them around this one you're locked in a one single character alright so you play
10820700	10824520	one character there's about I think just under a hundred if not just a little
10824520	10827920	over a hundred characters to choose from they all have different abilities some
10827920	10834400	yeah think of your standard role-playing game party they have characters that fit
10834400	10839480	each role that's in the game your healer your magic user your Archer sure yeah
10839480	10843260	this one is this street attack damage you have your attack power which are
10843260	10847240	your magical abilities you have your tanks and you have your junglers of the
10847240	10850600	guys who don't sit in the main action of the game running around in the
10850600	10855200	assisting everybody else to sum it up here real quick and you just keep used
10855200	10859160	it's tower defense so you have three lines of towers and a large crystal that
10859160	10862160	you defend if you kill the other guys crystal you win or they can surrender
10862160	10868760	and give up okay it's not hard to learn but it takes patience to learn how to
10868760	10871920	play each character because they're all a little bit different there's like I
10871920	10876540	think right puts out a teaser video on each one of the characters they release
10876540	10879720	that tell you all about how to use their powers and just that any other thing so
10879720	10885480	just if you want to learn one there's plenty of resources to do so you know I
10885480	10889600	gotta admit part of what is scary to me in sorts about League of Legends that I
10889600	10893760	am afraid of of signing on there and that just getting owned by twelve-year
10893760	10896400	olds right off the bat cuz there's no way to practice like is there any type
10896400	10900640	of like practice learning curve like kinda way to ease yourself into this
10900640	10904280	game before you have to play against the hardcore people yeah well you can't
10904280	10907240	really play with the hardcore guys cuz they're mainly doing ranked matches
10907240	10911160	right matches you can't even touch until you max out your account they keeps
10911160	10914760	track of your players skill and how long you've been playing up to level 30 so
10914760	10918480	it'll take you about a good four or five months before you can even touch the
10918480	10921320	rank stuff so you don't have to worry about it and the matching is pretty good
10921320	10925880	so balances the team based off of the level base and how many wins they have
10925880	10929800	okay that's a little better so in the very beginning you'll see rookie stuff
10929800	10933560	happening left and right like when you think about it's like that doesn't make
10933560	10936080	any sense why is it gonna go close to that when he knows he's gonna die
10936080	10939080	because he's a rookie and he doesn't know any better they say exactly why so
10939080	10943520	you'll see that and as you your level goes up the quality of your games will
10943520	10948200	go up as far as who you're matched with and once you reach level 30 you're
10948200	10951120	pretty much like you can pretty much play any role because you've been
10951120	10954640	playing the game enough in order to do so and it's free you don't have to put
10954640	10959280	any money into it whatsoever I like free I do like free let me ask this um what
10959280	10962120	do you think about the whole dota stuff that we were talking about earlier in
10962120	10965560	the show with Blizzard and valve going at each other over dota I mean it seems
10965560	10968760	like you're kind of getting into these games now do you do you have a
10968760	10973320	preference on what you want to see happen with the dota name or well to
10973320	10979000	sum them all up dota and dota 2 and what blizzard I think is trying to do in
10979000	10983080	heroes a new earth follow the original model the original model is not newbie
10983080	10988080	friendly there's a lot of step game is very complex I mean you take just five
10988080	10992360	on five guys in the Starcraft environment fighting each other and you
10992360	10997720	add the crafting system and how you build bigger items you worry about the
10997720	11001160	concepts of feeding other players just running and killing so they get gold
11001160	11004680	because they're killing you off left or right which unbalances the whole game
11004680	11007040	and then everybody's screaming new bet you this that and the other thing
11007040	11010520	there's a lot of craft to remember for the all those but some people like that
11010520	11014840	complexity League of Legends is a lot simpler it's easier to get into and the
11014840	11018440	matches don't potentially don't last as long because there's a level cap during
11018440	11021880	the game your character can only get up to level 18 I think and all the others
11021880	11027200	and go up to 25 30 before they start capping out so the game is forced to a
11027200	11031080	conclusion usually one game will not go any longer than an hour even as a newbie
11031080	11036080	all right so it sounds like there's a lot of even though you know we kind of
11036080	11038920	say these games all have the same roots there's still a lot of mechanic
11038920	11043440	mechanical differences between them so yeah at the core of the same but one is
11043440	11046600	very newbie friendly the other one just let the pros deal with it don't even
11046600	11049920	bother all right xenocore anything else you want to share with listeners for we
11049920	11055120	take another call yeah actually now if you get it uh to go order from the Olive

11250080	11255480	what since the studio is at your house can we get to all our cam back I've
11255480	11258720	thought about it I've seriously thought about it but it's kind of a pain in the
11258720	11263320	butt to hook up and we're probably gonna be moving in June anyway so probably
11263320	11268840	after that because we'll have a more proper studio set up at that point it's
11268840	11273220	like the studio is like a nomad isn't it maybe for your 10-year present olr
11273220	11279480	listeners because our birthdays in June too it plays Genesis games I have a
11279480	11289320	thing that plays Genesis games it's called a Genesis what am I gonna do with
11289320	11293480	you Rama all right anything else you want to I filthy up the show it tonight
11293480	11297480	how bad the beat is gonna fall flat on its face no now you're throwing some
11297480	11301120	shade this is good this is these are the types of calls I like why is the Vita
11301120	11306560	gonna fall flat on its face Rama I can't as much as I want the system I can't see
11306560	11310720	myself shelling out two hundred and fifty dollars for this thing I just
11310720	11315440	can't I mean Nintendo learned their lesson like pretty quickly with the
11315440	11322240	price drop Sony will just stand there all right just say that it's okay it's
11322240	11326880	a cop it's okay there's nothing wrong with the price for me for a year before
11326880	11331520	it falls if that all right let's look at let's look at the technology with you
11331520	11337240	know the DS and the 3ds I mean if you put those side to side and you know is
11337240	11342200	you give it to somebody like okay why are these the same thing so I mean
11342200	11347280	really all they added with the 3ds is an analog nub and 3d and the 3d is just
11347280	11352560	kind of it and their launch lineup was kind of meh so that's why the 3ds
11352560	11355920	flopped is because they didn't have a good launch lineup didn't have any big
11355920	11360480	franchise I'm sorry Nintendogs fucking porting Nintendogs I'm not even gonna
11360480	11364580	call it a new game and adding cats because some people have cats is not a
11364580	11369200	fucking launch game I mean that's just terrible and pilot wings is kind of ho
11369200	11373480	hum it was three three activities that you could do on woohoo Island that no
11373480	11377360	one gives a shit about woohoo Island is not fucking character Mario is a
11377360	11381160	character link is a character woohoo Island no one gives a shit I want woohoo
11381160	11385200	Island to be a fighter in the next Smash Brothers I would like to see that but
11385200	11392360	that's not gonna happen but um so that's why it tanked is because of that and I
11392360	11396160	know people think it may tank again because it didn't do so well in Japan
11396160	11400000	but Japanese people are fickle they they like some things they don't like some
11400000	11404880	things they like dating sim games we don't like dating sim games I don't know
11404880	11409960	it's just weird so um I think it has a good chance because their launch lineup
11409960	11414120	is fucking awesome I mean they've got a lot of games coming out and it's not
11414120	11418600	like hey look here's our launch lineup and then we have one 3ds game coming out
11418600	11424000	each month I mean we're talking like a lot of games and it's gonna be Vita Vita
11424000	11428200	Vita all I will say PlayStation does seem to have really good third-party
11428200	11432440	support out the gate as opposed to third-party support eventually and and
11432440	11436800	it's also pretty you know powerful technology wise I mean the screen looks
11436800	11442460	nice it's got dual analog sticks which is gonna be great for porting games over
11442460	11445040	or creating you know first-person shooter games and that kind of stuff
11445040	11448840	because you actually have some decent controls there except you know unlike
11448840	11453680	the 3ds where you're gonna force people to use the analog stick and then the
11453680	11458360	touchscreen and oh it's very fucking uncomfortable so let's throw in the
11458360	11462880	stand we're gonna have a kickstand on this fucker that we're gonna put out
11462880	11466800	with this game because it's just not gonna work well yeah that's stupid if
11466800	11471400	you've got to add accessories to your stupid system because oh I forgot to put
11471400	11474800	some buttons on there and oh this is really fucking uncomfortable to hold
11474800	11481480	then then you got a problem all right Rama he's made his case we'll see we'll
11481480	11484680	see a lot a lot of questions to be answered over the next month and see
11484680	11488840	what the numbers look like when the system comes out all right Rama anything
11488840	11492480	else quickly before we let you go I'm kind of floored because I actually
11492480	11497800	agree with Loki on that hmm I mean I do and I understand where he's coming from
11497800	11504160	I mean the Vita is a much more powerful system it it's there but the way I see
11504160	11508260	it is that the consumers can look at like I could do all this look at the
11508260	11512940	price put it down and they can go pick up a 3ds or something like that I think
11512940	11516480	that's what it's coming down to right about now it's all about the price point
11516480	11519760	yeah but people are comfortable in pain that's kinds of price points because
11519760	11523960	people are buying tablets and they're buying all this other electronic garbage
11523960	11527000	that's really expensive well the price point is not that big a deal anymore
11527000	11531560	well I don't know about that most people are buying tablets or iPad users because
11531560	11536760	they're buying because it's an iPad you know people people shell out that type
11536760	11540200	of money but you know but iPads aren't the only tablets out there and there's
11540200	11544560	definitely plenty of them being sold yeah but those are but those tablets
11544560	11552080	cost less or less expensive than the iPad I mean okay between a $500 iPad and
11552080	11557600	a $200 Kindle fire I'll I will drop 200 on the Kindle fire so you'll drop $200
11557600	11562800	on a Kindle fire but you won't drop $200 on a fucking via I see how it is no no
11562800	11567880	no no you get my words twisted Loki but I respect you for that all right I have
11567880	11571040	to put it into this we got to wrap up the show right all right Rama thank you
11571040	11575440	very much for your call good luck no problem take care later run John all
11575440	11578920	right well he didn't hear that he'll hear it on the air all right so really
11578920	11582760	the Skype was really you gotta buy a system that's less less expensive than
11582760	11587700	the other system that's how it is so I mean that's that's the argument me well
11587700	11592240	you know the iPads $500 so you know spending $250 on this tablet it's not
11592240	11598120	that big a deal wait what doesn't make any sense all right we got to wrap up
11598120	11601600	the show we ran long tonight but that's okay why it was worth it for the phone
11601600	11607360	call with Aska earlier on it was fun so I'm who I've been chatting but I knew
11607360	11610560	you would I need to be braiding each other's hair within minutes this is a
11610560	11614200	matter of time all right hitting each other with pellas on the party all
