14158	25067	Tonight, February 12, 2012, Blizzard files suit against Valve, Mass Effect gets iOS tie-ins galore, and could the next Xbox also have a tablet controller?
32489	32649	Derp
56721	57581	Herp?
57762	58002	Herp?
58642	59923	No, it's going to be like this tonight, huh?
60683	61183	How are you doing?
61703	62864	I'm actually a little sore.
63144	63884	You're a little sore?
63984	64565	In the hand.
65065	65385	Uh-oh.
65505	66426	In the handle region.
66746	68487	Well, you've had hand problems.
68787	74169	It's because of the rain and I spent the last three days typing, renaming files for the American River Review.
75010	77431	We did our art submissions and I submitted five pieces.
79974	88684	You are one of the stars of NBC's community, in a sense, where you're going to community college and you're on yearbook, right?
89185	90046	I'll put it this way.
90606	94651	This makes a yearbook look like a fanzine in comparison to Vogue.
94691	95832	I was in yearbook in high school.
95953	97715	They have yearbooks in high school?
98416	98716	Yes.
99137	101018	Oh, by the way, over there, Techmaster Loki.
101398	102019	How are you, Loki?
102099	103340	They have yearbooks in high school?
103520	104020	Yes, they did.
104141	105662	Or not high school, college?
106422	106823	They could.
107623	114168	They did because my parents met at Modesto Junior College, I'll say it, and there was a yearbook.
114409	115830	Yeah, of course they have yearbooks in high school.
116891	118452	I was in yearbook in high school because it's...
118812	119252	DarkSakura.com
138041	138702	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
151272	152693	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
175211	186385	I'm not usually the type to get strategy guides because, you know, you can kind of get it all on GameFAQs, but I gotta say, if you're a really big fan of a game, there's just some beautiful art and design in a lot of those books.
186425	189509	Like, they're just, they're good coffee table books for nerds.
190350	197012	I mean, and this one I was looking at with the collector's edition had like that, that big, thick kind of pillowy cover almost to it.
197032	200093	I mean, it was not your standard books, I guess.
200174	206576	I don't know what the technical name is for it, but it was like, you know, it was like the type that if you threw it on the ground, it wouldn't leave any marks because it's like ploosh.
209157	212719	Well, those are done with, actually, I think, foam and embossing.
213619	219602	So, yeah, I mean, the thing is, maybe I should save this for my FUs, but I'll go ahead and say it right now.
220142	230547	The problem with a lot of places that hire designers is they want you to have a four-year degree, and it doesn't matter really how much real-life experience you have and just have an associate's.
231488	231668	Hmm.
232168	232969	It's stupid.
233069	240139	I've got tons of experience and... I'm like, well, tell them to reduce the tuition, please.
240579	246047	Do you know that I used to do design work before I worked at my current company, which I've been at for 10 years.
246107	247088	This was a long time ago when I was 21, 22.
250772	253634	I worked for a truck driver's magazine.
254514	257396	And I was just kind of the dude in the office.
257657	259178	We all worked at the publisher's office.
259538	260198	It was a great staff.
260218	261619	It was a very small office, seven people.
262080	266083	And I was more like, I guess you could say kind of an administrative assistant to the publisher, sort of.
266103	268344	But I really did a lot of just different stuff.
268704	269705	I helped with subscriptions.
270045	275209	And one role I ended up taking on when one of the gals left, I started designing trade ads for the magazine.
275269	275990	So, I mean...
276710	279673	That's something I didn't... I just fell into it.
279733	280333	It was weird.
280553	284537	And I'm not... I had yearbook in high school, but let's be real.
285338	287559	There's a lot more to it that I'm not up and up on.
287639	289941	But that's just how the way the market is right now.
290142	290702	Yeah.
291042	291563	It's crazy.
291703	291803	And...
293164	299147	I would have no problem finishing my four-year degree if tuition was not so stupidly high.
299847	301328	And now you all know a little fact about me.
301368	301888	Yes, it's true.
301928	303729	I used to work for a truck driver's magazine.
304470	306210	But I don't know if it's still around.
306250	306871	I think it is.
307011	312073	But anyway, I got laid off because not a lot of truck drivers read magazines.
312093	313314	They all listen to satellite radio.
313834	315955	But anyhow, let's move on.
316455	317076	Video games.
317136	319157	Techmaster Loki, how are you these days?
320217	320477	Fine.
320758	321478	I gotta say this.
321778	326983	One of the popular games I like to play here at OLR before we get into the game talk is, what did Loki bring to the show tonight?
327603	329505	And Loki brought with him Jack in the Box.
330586	334769	Now, Jack in the Box, they have almost everywhere in the U.S., right?
335129	335590	I think so.
335610	337311	But not in the Northeast, I think.
337411	337891	They don't have it.
337931	338332	That's weird.
338772	339313	Yeah, it's weird.
339333	345020	They don't have it because I know friends that live up in like Connecticut and stuff and when they come out here, they're like, we got to go to Jack in the Box.
345080	345440	Oh my God.
345480	350506	It's kind of like, it's kind of like me and Dunkin Donuts because we don't have Dunkin Donuts here in California.
351167	351888	Or Krispy Kreme anymore.
351908	352829	I need their coffee.
353029	354331	We do have a Krispy Kreme in Roseville.
354727	356108	Yeah, there's still a Krispy Kreme.
356348	357068	Yeah, there's a Krispy Kreme.
357088	358549	They opened a Krispy Kreme in Roseville.
358789	358969	Where?
359889	360270	Somewhere.
361530	362571	There's one in Stockton, too.
362771	363571	Yeah, but where's Roseville?
363731	364532	Where in Roseville, though?
364552	366352	Because I can swing out that way.
366492	367933	Let me Google that for you.
369474	370654	Anyhow, Jack in the Box.
371015	373396	Right now, they have the bacon milkshakes right now.
373796	376097	I don't know why I'm giving them free advertising, but whatever.
376357	378279	It's not on their menu, probably for good reason.
400002	406627	It did taste a little bit like the cheeses that they have out at the mall with the Swiss ladies at Christmas time.
406647	407627	What is that, the Hickory Farms?
407767	408268	Hickory Farms.
408288	408648	Is that it?
409088	412270	It did taste a little bit like... Like smoked vanilla.
412390	414191	They made a bacon cheddar milkshake.
414231	415272	That might be pretty good.
417614	417974	All right.
418474	419035	You know what, though?
419055	425719	That has inspired me to make my own bacon milkshake because this is just meh.
425739	427400	Be careful the grease and milk don't curdle.
428757	431178	Eric RPG says, I want to go to a Psycho Donuts.
431258	431938	I've never heard of that.
432458	436759	I wonder if that's like, if you live in Portland, there's a great place called Voodoo Donuts.
436779	438000	Surely you already know this place.
438060	439040	It's legendary up there.
439100	442801	But Voodoo Donuts, which I had when I was up in Portland.
442821	444902	And that's where you can get the donuts that look like penises.
445502	447603	And you can also get the bacon maple bars, Loki.
448123	451344	I've seen that on Diner's Drive-Ins and Dives.
451364	452064	Food Network, right?
452224	453044	No, I've seen it on that.
453984	454645	No, it wasn't that.
454745	455005	It was...
457529	458089	Oh, what the hell?
458489	459190	Man vs. Food.
459330	461330	I saw it on there.
461430	462691	They do weddings there too.
462991	463491	Video games.
463791	466172	I want to get into this off the top of the show.
466392	468473	Loki, you sent out a tweet this week.
468613	470534	You are parting with one of your video game systems.
470574	471054	What's going on?
472808	475390	I just don't play my 3DS, so I want to get rid of it.
476811	499326	And really, it came down to just, I was thinking, okay, Vita or the 3DS, normally I would get both, but I don't play my 3DS that often, so I was like, okay, what titles coming soon or this year or that have been announced or potentially would be announced that I would be looking forward to on the 3DS?
502728	507853	Kid Icarus, maybe another Mario title or Paper Mario or something like that.
507874	509275	They did confirm a 2D Mario, right?
509315	512118	Yeah, well, there's another 2D Mario, but I don't really care.
512599	515482	And then there's maybe a Paper Mario or something like that.
518463	524209	I picked up Mario Kart, Super Mario 3 Land, and I played a lot of Mario Kart.
524269	531677	I didn't really play much of Super Mario 3 Land, but between those, I hadn't picked up anything since launch.
532177	538383	I mean, it's a good nine-month span, basically, between games.
538724	538844	And
540605	544127	And honestly, the next thing I'd probably pick up would be Kid Icarus, which is in March.
544588	548350	And beyond that, I mean, it's just not a whole lot.
548710	552233	Whereas the Vita, I mean, they're porting everything to that.
552253	553574	There's going to be a Call of Duty on that.
553614	557036	There's going to be probably the next Grand Theft Auto will be on that.
557056	558097	I would not be surprised.
558897	564421	And just I think there's a lot more games on there that I would probably play versus my 3DS.
564441	568343	And to be honest, I mean, the 3DS, it's kind of a letdown a little bit
569324	572366	It's just a DS, more or less.
572426	576888	I mean, with some 3D graphics that are just kind of like, eh, that's kind of neat.
577629	588415	Would you think about, I mean, one, see, I'm not quite on the same side issue, but I'm also in a situation right now where financially I could get the V, because I just did taxes and I had a huge tax refund.
588815	591997	So I could get the Vita without having to part with my 3DS and I can juggle them both.
592037	594659	I'm not going to feel like I'm losing something to gain something else.
595079	609288	But the more I think about it from your perspective, if you do sell your 3DS, it's not like you couldn't buy one later and they'll probably have the inevitable redesign that includes that second D-pad and we all know there's going to be some redesign in the future.
609628	611109	I know that's Alan's thing.
611370	613771	He doesn't want to get a 3DS until the inevitable redesign.
613791	614291	There will be.
614352	617073	There's absolutely going to be a redesigned 3DS at some point.
617253	617353	And
618534	641287	and that's not even really a big deal for me either because it's it's just like even the next console generation I was kind of thinking about it and it's like I'm not gonna I don't think I'm gonna buy all three again you know it was kind of cool with the Wii it was like oh I gotta try that out because you know that is a completely different type of way to play games and the PS3 I honestly wouldn't have picked up at all but I got one for free so you know I'm not gonna complain there
642547	657415	and really I didn't play too much I've played a few games on the PS3 but not a whole lot and I still don't I hardly ever use it for Blu-rays I use it for streaming movies but I mean I could do that with my Xbox too
658055	659535	I play a lot more Xbox, but...
683800	711310	I just don't know well mainly it was before it was going to be that it was money was going to be the issue where I kind of just wanted a Vita and even then I was like do I really want a Vita I mean but yeah I do because there's actually some games on there that I would like to try out I'm not going to go crazy and buy like a bunch of launch games like I did with the 3DS I went a little crazy there um
713450	729422	I don't play Kingdom Hearts, otherwise Kingdom Hearts would probably be a big draw for me for the 3DS, but they don't have a date for that yet, it's still sometime this year.
732236	732516	I don't know.
732536	733858	I just think there's going to be a lot of stuff.
733938	738904	And that system seems like such a step up versus the DS and the 3DS.
738924	741267	DS and 3DS, I mean, they're pretty much the same.
741407	744551	Especially DSi, you know.
745252	748856	And even the 3DS in some regards is a step backwards.
749216	750337	I'm still Team 3DS.
750417	751418	I really like my 3DS.
751718	752559	I'm not going to part with it.
752639	757983	But I will say those DSi XLs, when Alan got one of those, those screens are gigantic.
758043	758744	I love it.
759164	761747	That's the best way to play DS games right now.
762447	766570	I wish the 3DS screens were that big, but I guess they have to save that for the redesign.
767131	767511	I don't know.
767992	770994	Or maybe it's more expensive because of the technology in those screens.
771034	771414	I don't know.
772475	774037	It's a 3DS tablet.
774697	776258	Oh, wait, that's just a Wii U controller.
776518	776618	Oh.
776638	778058	Yeah.
778278	778539	All right.
779159	781140	Vita, have you gotten your hands on a Vita yet?
781300	782600	I finally played one yesterday.
782960	783601	No, I have not.
784321	789943	I played one at GameStop yesterday, which I know, yes, I walked into a GameStop and I didn't instantly turn to Ash.
790343	793724	But in my defense, I was at the mall and we were shopping at some other stores.
794865	798646	And so we were walking right by and I was like, oh, there's the Vita right there on the wall.
798746	799087	Damn it.
799127	800007	Let's go in and take a look.
800587	802588	So I did get my hands on the Vita a little bit.
802608	807429	And I got to say, first thing I noticed right away, damn, that screen is big.
807729	811870	Like for a handheld, it's more like regular TV proportions.
811950	815491	And I was kind of, okay, that's kind of neat.
815831	817531	The analog sticks are tiny though.
817591	818732	That was interesting.
818752	825933	And they're not, thank God, they're not like that little nub that's on the PSP that would hurt my thumb after using it for so long.
825973	826894	Like what the hell was that thing?
827194	828574	They're like little tiny...
828854	834682	tiny little nubs, tiny little PS nipples that you can use to, you know, for whatever.
834722	839408	But then it's like, I'm standing there like an idiot, like, how do I start the damn game?
839769	842112	And then I remembered, oh yeah, this thing has a touchscreen.
842673	844876	I have to touch the screen to get it to do anything.
846818	848859	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
876178	878759	I'm still kind of on the fence on if I want one or not.
878819	882441	And funny enough, it's kind of what's troubling Loki, and that is the games.
882841	884562	But Loki, I got to say, you do make a good point.
884822	888483	Most of the big franchises will probably inevitably come over at some point.
888583	891925	I know I want that Final Fantasy X thing that they're going to do down the line.
892945	895406	If I were to buy the Vita at launch, I'm getting that Luminous game.
895806	896286	Absolutely.
896306	897867	It has a kick-butt song list and everything.
897907	901208	And you know I always have this fanboy boner for Q Entertainment.
901228	901929	Yeah.
902609	906411	You know, speaking, I just thought it was kind of ironic and funny.
907511	909252	Ridge Racer is no longer a launch title.
910173	915475	I wonder if it didn't sell very well at all in Japan and they went back to fix it and add tracks.
915776	916236	Let's hope.
916356	917797	But didn't Ninja Gaiden get bumped up?
918037	918617	Like there was kind of a...
919017	921339	No, it's just that the news is too slow.
921499	926422	They're behind in getting release dates and stuff like that, so it's been launched for a while.
926942	943634	It does kind of concern me a little bit, too, that there's a lot about the Vita that's still kind of a question mark, even though the damn thing's out in Japan, and there's a lot of stuff that ought to be there that's not, and I gotta admit, one of the things, I know a lot of people are like, well, if you want it, just go play your PSP or go hook up your PlayStation 1.
944214	946656	The PS1 game's not playing on the PlayStation Vita.
946796	948317	I mean, why not?
948957	950718	I don't understand why that doesn't work.
952518	958041	If that thing is supposed to be as powerful as a PlayStation 3, why can't it successfully emulate the PlayStation 1 games?
958421	963903	I'm sure there's a highly technical answer, but from a consumer standpoint, I'm like, damn it, I bought Final Fantasy 5.
964743	965964	I would like to play that and go.
965984	972226	They just have to get the emulator to work because they still don't have full backwards compatibility with the PlayStation portable stuff.
972526	973866	And they are working on that, right?
974286	977887	It's always weird to me when Sony's implementing all these features as they go.
978247	980808	But then there's a part of me that watches what happened with Microsoft.
981148	989229	Because remember when the Xbox first came out, it was like, these handful of titles will be emulatable from the original Xbox.
989669	992170	And they slowly added more and more to that list.
992210	995090	And they said, we're not going to stop until they're all emulatable.
995751	997211	And they stopped about a year into it.
997871	1000855	and you still can't play the old DDR Ultramix games on 360.
1001195	1005240	At the same time, at least they're not shipping that system saying, oh, hey, look, internet browser.
1005560	1008704	Oh, internet browser coming in the future patch.
1010366	1010526	What?
1011127	1013229	Yeah, I guess that's... Okay, Nintendo's guilty of the same thing.
1013249	1014791	Hey, look, I want to buy a game.
1014951	1015412	Oh, sorry.
1016273	1017675	Store coming in the future patch.
1019276	1021758	I want to use the second analog seat.
1021778	1024519	Nintendo was married to that March release date for whatever reason.
1024559	1024900	Or April.
1024920	1026401	What the hell month did it come out?
1026661	1026901	March.
1027001	1027481	March, alright.
1027701	1029082	They sure were married to that date.
1029483	1032845	Oh yeah, because of the quarter earnings, right?
1032865	1033765	Yeah, their fiscal year.
1035186	1056225	so I get maybe it's the same thing with Sony I mean yeah it's February but it's you know still maybe that's part of the reason why they got to get it out now oh well I'm sure I'll end up getting one inevitably because I really do want that Luminous game I really want it and then when the Final Fantasy 10 thing comes out I'm gonna be like I want that too so
1057074	1073801	Well, and just looking at some of the other stuff, like LittleBigPlanet on it, I'm not, you know, I don't play enough of LittleBigPlanet on the PS3, but just showing how easy it is to make stuff using that touchscreen, just like, okay, I want to make a hill, and I want to adjust it.
1074121	1081545	Oh, and I'm going to pinch it to make it a little bit smaller, and I'm going to rotate it, and I'm just going to poke at this stuff, and everything works perfectly fine.
1081785	1081845	It...
1082765	1084667	Vita is worthwhile at launch only if you don't own a PSP
1107170	1114412	See, I do own a PSP, and I'm still kind of like, sort of want... And here's the other thing, too, though, and I don't know if you've done this yet.
1114952	1127016	Remember back when they gave you those free PlayStation Network games and the free PSP games as part of the reparations for the network being down for a while?
1127416	1134418	I haven't used those PSP games, so I actually have ModNation Racers waiting for me as soon as I get my Vita.
1135775	1141300	More comments in our chatroom at chat.org.com Ahamkara says, no HDMI port on the Vita.
1141320	1142341	Well, that's kind of ass.
1143082	1144844	What if you want to play your Vita stuff on the TV?
1145324	1146045	Who cares?
1146285	1146625	Me!
1147066	1148647	I like hooking up the PSP to the TV.
1149758	1150739	Yeah, but who cares?
1150859	1151400	You know why?
1151861	1158529	Because, first off, who's to say that you're not going to be able to stream that stuff from your Vita to your TV in the first place?
1158809	1167059	And whoever fucking uses stupid cable, so you actually use the cables to hook up to your TV, you like being tethered six feet away from your TV, was that fun?
1167079	1167160	Yeah.
1167740	1195316	I mean because I had actually okay hold on hold on smarty pants when I'm in the bedroom on the TV in there and I'm kind of lying on the bed that six foot tether is just enough where yes I can lie in bed and play Final Fantasy 4 and have a fat day where I am fat and I am playing PSP in bed on my TV I mean the only one that was actually that would make sense doing that would have been like the PSP Go where it actually had you know DualShock 3 Bluetooth support
1196056	1197798	Which, hey, there you go.
1198059	1201984	Bluetooth support, you know, you could maybe do something like that later on.
1202344	1203346	But I don't care.
1203386	1204888	I've got a big screen in front of me.
1204928	1208372	Why do I need to hook it up to my TV that has some weird resolution on there?
1209554	1210435	I just don't need that.
1211596	1215298	If I want to play on my TV, I'll use my PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360.
1215538	1221461	Spaznator in our chatroom says, I don't want to get a Vita due to the shit I've gone through with my PlayStation 3 and my digital downloaded videos.
1221881	1223341	You know, history can burn you.
1223942	1228764	And I know Spaznator's called into this show before to talk about his trials and tribulations.
1228804	1233386	And I got to say, yeah, I can see where he's coming from because it's me and Microsoft right now.
1233786	1243092	I feel very apprehensive with, like, I don't want to buy things on Xbox because my wallet will be, you know, stolen from yet again.
1243352	1244853	I'm feeling a little weird about all that stuff.
1245454	1247475	Whereas I'm sure some people are like, Rob, you're irrational.
1247575	1249996	I don't buy a lot of digital content, so it doesn't matter to me.
1251537	1254139	I mean, especially since they're like, hey, you get 10% off.
1254519	1254860	Maybe.
1254900	1257902	That's if we decide to discount it because Uncharted's not fucking discounted.
1258122	1258882	Or at least it wasn't.
1259042	1260063	It might be discounted now.
1260123	1260403	But still 10%.
1260443	1260944	All right.
1264557	1290389	let's uh let's move on so Vita so Vita yes for you launch day um hopefully Vita I is strong like leaning towards yes but I'm really gonna wait for that first week release thing that's Valentine's Day or whatever and see what the feedback is on that DarkSakura I'm pretty sure you said you're a no just due to personal situations but any interest in Vita I want an iPad
1292213	1294195	Just wait for an iPad 3 or whatever.
1294335	1295756	They're going to announce one at the beginning of March.
1295776	1296016	That's true.
1296036	1298018	Yeah, iPad 3 will be all HD and pretty.
1298038	1299059	I want one of those, too.
1300199	1303402	Honestly, I don't really give a shit about the Vita anymore.
1303782	1304163	Why's that?
1304643	1308046	I mean, it would be nice to have one, and I'm sure Dan wants to get one.
1309187	1310328	Are you psyching yourself out?
1310388	1311829	You're like, I don't want a Vita.
1312149	1314151	Vitas are shit because I can't afford it.
1314251	1316333	No, I'm saying this.
1316893	1317774	I really...
1319958	1325800	I'm still playing games on my DS and I can't play for very long before I start to hurt.
1326880	1330401	So it's sort of like I play anything that I want to on my phone.
1330441	1333102	I only have to use my thumbs and bust a move is all I need.
1337443	1338644	Bust a move is all I need.
1338724	1339464	All right, fair enough.
1339798	1340559	Let's move on.
1340639	1344742	We're going to talk about our gaming weeks and the video games that we've been playing this week.
1345683	1348105	Of course, you can always join us in the chat room to chat along with us.
1348225	1353429	Chat.orangeloungeradio.com live on this Sunday evening, February the 12th of 2012.
1354429	1358753	If you're listening on the podcast, hey, just a reminder, we do tape live every Sunday night.
1359334	1367966	Right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com And a big thanks, of course, to the chatters for coming out as always.
1369167	1372412	What did I say fucking last week when we were up against the Super Bowl?
1372452	1374655	We are always against some...
1375396	1377818	Damn national event on TV on Sunday nights.
1378158	1379340	And tonight it's the Grammys.
1379800	1382202	But Adele's going to win everything.
1383503	1386486	Every star that gets on the stage is going to say something about Whitney Houston.
1386586	1388427	And that'll be pretty much it.
1388467	1389128	I don't think I'll miss much.
1389208	1390689	Any good performances will be on YouTube.
1391090	1391510	So there you go.
1391570	1392251	Now you can listen to us.
1392791	1415907	it'll be more spontaneous um let's talk about our gaming weeks DarkSakura we'll start with you what types of video games you've been playing this week best to move on my phone which um i'm trying to go back through and get all the medals now which i think i have most of them um so i can get like the proper ending of the game um and i'm uh play well addict dealer
1416590	1417991	What's new with you in the world of Warcraft?
1418011	1419212	What have you been, like, your goals lately?
1419452	1420072	Holidailies.
1422293	1422974	That's pretty much it.
1423554	1426896	I want a pink flamingo to run around and go, ooh, look at my pink flamingo.
1428437	1429518	And I'm playing my troll.
1430945	1432566	Who cries and sighs all the time.
1433926	1440229	And I have another Horde tune on Ravencrest to play with other people.
1441089	1441549	Good times.
1441909	1445251	But, by the way, Rob, I did get the name today for the Death Knight.
1446211	1446531	R.I.P.
1446551	1446831	Whitney.
1448252	1448812	Good for you.
1449652	1450853	So, just letting you know.
1451213	1455555	I believe Grandpa Warcrafter, as he goes by in our chatroom with Salvelos, would be proud.
1456215	1458856	Because he had RIP Steve Jobs.
1459056	1460337	I have RIP Betty White.
1460377	1460897	Just waiting.
1461798	1467781	And I think he rolled another one when somebody passed away recently.
1467801	1468641	I don't remember who it was.
1468781	1477346	I'm actually, because my one that's on the main server, I'm going to be, I'm learning how to tank on that one.
1477386	1479847	But this one, the other one is just going to be DPS for lols.
1479887	1481188	So I can go in and go, ha ha.
1482068	1482489	Star Trek Online F2P
1490437	1492038	Well, I haven't checked out the very new stuff.
1492878	1497839	They have a really a lot easier way now to get some of the different costumes and goodies.
1498659	1503441	If you've got the cryptic points for it, you actually just will select it on the menu with all the rest of everything.
1504021	1509602	Like if you're changing your outfit and you want a certain piece of an outfit, you can just select that piece and pay your points then.
1510503	1518685	So I'm probably going to be getting some cryptic points in the next couple of weeks and really giving it a go because I miss playing with my Scottish buddies.
1519805	1521026	But I still love SEO.
1521066	1523647	I went around and they fixed a bunch of stuff on DS9.
1525628	1526748	Oh, Deep Space Nine is in the game?
1526788	1528309	You can actually now go in the office.
1528449	1529230	It's been in the game.
1529550	1530830	There were just parts that were closed off.
1531311	1536493	Now you can actually go in the commander's office and the baseball is sitting there.
1536573	1537333	Cisco's baseball.
1537914	1541435	Because, you know, he is awesome-tastic.
1542416	1542676	All right.
1544601	1549403	I've had school and all this other stuff on my plate, so I still haven't sent out the games.
1549543	1549863	Sorry.
1551263	1553284	And we were going to pick up our... Lazy.
1554044	1554805	No, busy.
1555145	1559046	We were going to pick up our duo today, but we just didn't get by there.
1559126	1565449	We were going to go by Dan's mom's house, but she had to go somewhere else, so we didn't get a chance to.
1567028	1568349	All right, let's go to Loki.
1568410	1569891	Techmaster Loki, how was your gaming week?
1570232	1570852	I didn't play much.
1571012	1573635	I was writing tutorials this weekend.
1575237	1578961	I played very little bit of Skyrim.
1578981	1582865	I don't even remember what I did in there, but something Skyrim related.
1583025	1586409	I think it was... Oh, yeah, I checked out Patch 1.4, which...
1589051	1589731	Sadly the same.
1590011	1593292	Even though it promised to fix the quest, it did not fix the quest.
1594612	1595932	I think the quest is too dead for me.
1596472	1597793	Did they push that to console finally?
1598153	1599973	Yes, it's to console now.
1600753	1604794	It was supposed to fix the Fire on the Ice... No, not Fire on the Ice.
1604994	1610755	Blood on the Ice quest and... No, it didn't.
1611475	1611875	None of mine.
1612255	1612855	It's impossible.
1614335	1615116	So, eh, whatever.
1615776	1615896	Um...
1617316	1618697	Let's see then.
1619558	1621260	Some other miscellaneous quests I did.
1624202	1628626	I also played The Cat That Got the Milk, which was the free game I was talking about.
1628967	1634312	CatThatGotTheMilk.com And it's this weird... It's like a puzzle game.
1635012	1636314	And it gets all...
1638427	1639127	Call of Duty
1668868	1671451	That's pretty much the only area I can improve upon right now.
1672933	1676738	I'm really frustrated now that my coworkers, they really don't like playing with me.
1678427	1679427	You're just too good.
1679447	1683909	Because I will purposefully run up behind them and stab them.
1684330	1685230	I have the opportunity.
1685250	1687851	Well, that's not a nice thing to do to your coworkers.
1688411	1690152	Or they'll be standing there or something like that.
1690732	1691693	And I'll sit behind them.
1691753	1695934	I'm like, okay, what's something funny that I could do to kill them?
1696175	1697415	Hmm, something funny.
1697675	1700316	So one of my coworkers is prone under this...
1701937	1702798	and DarkSakura.com
1719768	1721870	God damn it, you were sitting there the whole time.
1722130	1722871	Just kill me.
1723352	1725774	I'm so hateful that at your work you can do this.
1725994	1729837	It sounds like you work at a frat house, for God's sake.
1729857	1731339	No, it's just our 15-minute games.
1731379	1733981	We get two 15-minute games.
1734021	1735723	You know what I do on my 15-minute breaks?
1735963	1736684	I take a walk.
1737504	1738826	Yeah, I could do that, but no.
1741004	1742646	Call of Duty is where it's at.
1756628	1758089	So humble, so humble.
1758870	1766956	Hey, I didn't know I was going to be good at it, because honestly, I had played Call of Duty 4 once before I'd actually played with them.
1767417	1770419	And so I was kind of at the same spot that they were.
1770439	1778546	In fact, I believe that my boss, at least, had Call of Duty 4 already, and he's been playing online for like a while now.
1779446	1784891	So that's why he thought he had the advantage, but apparently I'm really good at that game.
1785951	1787632	I also read up on everything.
1790113	1792494	It's good to be educated in what you're playing.
1792834	1794115	All right, anything else for your gaming week?
1794515	1794795	That's it.
1794995	1796115	All right, my gaming week.
1796516	1798316	Pretty short because I didn't play a lot of new stuff.
1798416	1803698	I've been playing, when I'm not playing World of Warcraft, just like DarkSakura, Final Fantasy XIII 2.
1805139	1806319	Haters, stay pressed.
1806480	1807000	Step off.
1807280	1807780	It's great.
1807940	1809061	I'm loving Final Fantasy XIII 2.
1809101	1809221	It's...
1814363	1819506	It's such a different story than the last one in kind of the way they split it up.
1819586	1829212	It's really interesting that you go into one time and then you can go into a parallel timeline that's the same thing with a different result.
1829493	1830093	It's interesting.
1830273	1840419	And I have to correct one little thing I said in my review last week, and that is that you actually do get more than the two characters in your party, but...
1841300	1843181	They're not really controllable.
1843381	1850963	It's kind of like this extra character is just standing off to the side and kind of fighting with me, although I don't really watch their hit points or anything.
1851043	1856305	But I just didn't want to be corrected in my review last week because I've played a lot further into it now.
1856405	1857645	I did check out some of the DLC.
1858465	1866568	You can download right now the Lightning and her guy in charge of the squadron dude.
1866588	1867328	I can't remember his name.
1868168	1870790	You can play against them.
1870850	1876653	And I guess if you're able to beat them, you can use lightning as your summonable monster in battle.
1876713	1878914	But I can't beat them yet because I'm too low a level.
1879274	1880735	Because I guess I haven't played far enough.
1881555	1883036	So I'm still working away at it.
1883216	1886658	I finally got to the casino in Final Fantasy XIII too.
1886758	1889239	So it was kind of fun to see some of the minigames.
1889259	1890580	They're bringing back Chocobo Racing.
1890700	1893802	I heard that the Cait Sith was in the game as a summonable monster.
1894242	1917784	well but it's not it's not the Kate Sith it's not the guy in the big moogle that you remember from Final Fantasy 7 but it's a monster called Kate Sith in fact it's probably the first monster that you'll get and probably hang on to hang on to for a long time because it's a healer and it's one of the few healer monsters you get and plus it's a kitty and and the little special attack he goes wow and then you claw claw claw claw it's really funny so
1919352	1922715	Yeah, I'm liking Final Fantasy XIII too, and I'm definitely going to play this to completion.
1922735	1927140	That's pretty much where all my gaming hours have gone when I'm not playing WoW or something else.
1927900	1935348	I will say I randomly had an urge to play Bit.Trip Runner yesterday and try to get further in that game.
1936569	1938691	That's the one, you know, it plays like the chiptune music.
1938751	1939612	It's hard as hell.
1940012	1940773	It's like an older game.
1940793	1941333	It's on Steam.
1941654	1942795	That's where I play it on PC.
1942815	1942915	Okay.
1943331	1950546	I was thinking maybe I played Cannibal this week because I remember... Don't start Skyrim.
1950847	1951789	You'll never finish it.
1953679	1959924	Let's see, I'm looking in our chatroom at chat.orangelancerated.com Hey, Stan says, me too.
1960124	1961705	Loves Final Fantasy XIII too.
1962126	1966109	The use of enemies as a third character reminds me of Pokemon mixed with dog fights.
1966609	1967910	That's an interesting way to think of that.
1969291	1971733	Jester Scott says, by the way, you need lightning.
1971913	1975016	I would love to get lightning, but I can't beat her yet.
1975596	1979219	Eric RPG says, actually, Sky, it's a 10% drop even at five star.
1979299	1979939	Oh my God.
1981093	1981894	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1999363	2011571	you got your wish prayers answered enjoy grind grind grind away um otherwise gaming a little bit Mario Kart 7 that's really it so
2013341	2016523	Let's move on and talk about some housekeeping tonight.
2017424	2019445	We actually have some really big news in housekeeping tonight.
2020386	2025870	We didn't want to promote this a little bit because not everybody's going to see this as good news.
2027090	2029232	I wish DarkSakura was in the room, but she's in the restroom right now.
2029352	2030272	But that's all right.
2031173	2031953	We'll move on anyway.
2031994	2033975	She can say her piece afterwards if she needs to.
2034575	2035396	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2057433	2071264	next week will be the final afterbirth that we're going to do and it's going to involve the ultimate cage match and we'll tell you more about that next week why we're doing it I think part of us kind of creatively
2072105	2073386	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2093527	2094268	Thanks for watching!
2113562	2117143	Creatively, unfortunately, I think the afterbirth has lost a lot of steam.
2118084	2123765	Those of us here that host the show kind of feel like we got to get our cage match song.
2123785	2126006	We're stuck in the studio for another 20 minutes.
2126186	2132668	And, you know, it's kind of become this necessary thing we have to do every week.
2133489	2137310	And, you know, when creatively something's not working, you say, okay, we're going to change it.
2138050	2138810	So that's what we're going to do.
2138830	2139490	We're going to change it.
2140251	2149273	So we've decided to end the Orange Lounge Radio Afterbirth, and next week we are going to be saying goodbye to the Cage Match, which has been a part of our show for the past 425 weeks, give or take a few.
2150694	2157015	So, you know, I realize our live listeners may see this as, oh, well, you don't care about your live audience anymore.
2157375	2159616	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
2160356	2161216	It's not about that at all.
2161817	2162597	Think of it this way.
2163968	2174152	By doing that and ending the cage match, it opens the door for other possibilities and things we could better spend our time with once this show is over.
2175012	2177613	More information on that in the coming weeks.
2178033	2187537	But for now, we hope our live listeners will understand this creative decision to end this long time segment of our show that podcast listeners weren't even hearing anyway.
2189017	2190237	All right.
2190317	2192838	Kaijudo in chat says, I'm going to read these.
2192898	2197140	Kaijudo in chat says, just saying you guys are getting lazy after birth is good times.
2197800	2204882	I think that comment's a little bit unfair because, you know, it's not a lazy thing to be doing a show for the past 10 years every week.
2205742	2211004	But I think, too, you have to wait to see what the future holds.
2212785	2213625	I think we'll prove you wrong.
2214286	2218429	Hitstun says, I think we need an official post-show Turntable FM party.
2218729	2219670	I'd be in support of that.
2220230	2222752	I have not logged on to Turntable in quite some time.
2222992	2224753	And I love the iPhone app and all that.
2225113	2227675	And I am totally in support of that.
2228576	2231578	Ahamkara in chat says, play games after the show and stream it.
2232358	2235521	I've been thinking about that as like a side project.
2235881	2237502	The whole Twitch TV thing and all that.
2238062	2238543	Good times.
2240024	2240284	All right.
2241661	2243783	Anyone want to chime in on this whole thing?
2246045	2247406	I think I said my piece in the chat room.
2247747	2248407	But I'll say it aloud.
2248868	2249248	Fuck you.
2251130	2251990	We do this for free.
2253243	2257968	We do this as a service and we keep trying to think of new things to make things even better.
2258709	2263714	So if we're getting rid of something, we're doing it for a very good reason, not just because we don't feel like doing it.
2264095	2264775	So fuck off.
2265456	2274526	But I can see, well, that's a strong reaction, but I can see where the strong reaction comes from in chat too, is that, you know, we've been doing this so long and then we're saying goodbye to it and it's like, ugh.
2275305	2276727	But wait, why?
2279129	2284856	That's my initial reaction to just an accusation of overt laziness.
2285316	2285516	No.
2286478	2289501	And on top of that, I mean, Rob has a full-time job.
2289541	2290462	Loki has a full-time job.
2290562	2291263	I go to school.
2292725	2295287	You know, we give up our Sundays for you guys.
2296795	2309558	So there's nothing, I think, wrong at all for us, you know, trying to think of something new, some way to innovate because nothing ever grows without a challenge and without making small changes to it to make it grow.
2310842	2340116	so just chill there are some people in our chat that are like Brad from PodCulture says understandable and let's see TigerClaw says so there won't be a post show of any kind I didn't say that let's see Actdeft says nobody but one person is complaining so you know I think for the most part people get it that creatively sometimes we're not ending the show we're not ending the show so don't worry about that and there is something else coming
2340526	2341967	Yeah.
2341987	2342928	So just deal with it.
2343328	2343629	All right.
2343849	2346551	I mean, to be honest, we don't have to do the show.
2347292	2347812	I mean, really.
2349093	2349334	But we do.
2349354	2350174	But we like doing the show.
2350234	2351315	I like doing the show.
2351375	2353477	I would free up a lot of Skyrim time.
2355118	2358441	You know, I've got design work that I'm being paid for that I could be doing tonight.
2358601	2359362	But you know what?
2359502	2360283	I'm here doing the show.
2362145	2363927	The Vita Passport Service
2379646	2402436	If you owned a PSP and some PSP games, like UMD games, and you downloaded this application or whatever from the PlayStation Network that allowed you to mark the games that you had so that you could download them for a discount off of the PlayStation Network store and be able to download them onto your Vita.
2402476	2403076	It's not a way...
2403556	2405477	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2431212	2431712	They don't care.
2432312	2437855	I think they think that we're going to abuse it because we're the type of people to abuse that kind of thing.
2438435	2440136	Renting games or whatever.
2440176	2446098	I don't know how big rental is over in Japan, but I guess it's possible.
2446418	2449560	To be honest though, not really anyone rents PSP games.
2452821	2454942	It's a little disappointing, I guess.
2456215	2458676	It's disappointing.
2458756	2463297	There's going to be those people that are like, but if you want to play a PSP game, then you go get your PSP.
2464618	2468279	Well, then don't offer the service in Japan and not in other territories.
2469180	2469960	Yeah, there's that too.
2471321	2478104	Um, and then I'm also like, you guys are forgetting that, that PSP didn't have digital distribution in the beginning.
2478584	2482885	So those of us that were early adopters of the PSP, or at least I'm almost positive it didn't, right?
2482945	2484806	When the PSP launched, it didn't for a good year.
2485286	2487107	So, you know, longer than a year.
2487167	2488287	Yeah, it was, it was a while.
2488367	2496971	And like, there was a lot of games I bought when the PSP first came out, like Luminous, which, you know, of course I'm always going to go back to that because it's probably the greatest puzzle game to come out in a long time.
2496991	2497791	Um, and,
2498331	2515023	and yeah I'd like to be able to have that on my PS Vita but granted the pain is numbed significantly when you consider there's an all new Luminous game coming out so it's gonna with an awesome soundtrack well yeah I probably won't need the old one as badly as I thought I did but okay what about Final Fantasy 4
2515803	2535511	the collection on PSP which is great it's the original game and it's that PSP graphics which are great and you couldn't download that on the marketplace at first so of course I bought it on UMD and it's like oh damn I'd really love to be able to have that on the Vita but I guess not unless I want to buy it again
2537177	2555647	and I guarantee you we'll go for the market value that it is right now exactly like you know Final Fantasy 1 and 2 those are pretty awesome games I mean they're like $9 retail now but they're probably going to be like $15 on the PlayStation Network store yeah that's kind of a bummer because now the PlayStation Network kind of controls all that and you know
2556923	2556983	So...
2586747	2587027	Alright.
2588308	2588628	Anyhow.
2591170	2594753	Anything else on the UMD passport system and all that good stuff?
2595773	2597495	Think there's ever a chance there'll be a drive?
2597695	2598255	No, there won't.
2598655	2600316	No, they're not going to make a drive.
2600356	2601357	And I don't think they should.
2601517	2604059	I mean, it's ridiculous.
2604159	2607762	You don't need to make a UMD drive for a PSP.
2609043	2613927	Grand Theft Auto is not one of the games that's backwards compatible.
2613947	2614528	That is so disappointing.
2632442	2636947	But I hope that that's because they're going to go and fix the camera.
2636988	2639691	Because before there was no camera option.
2639791	2641393	It was one analog stick.
2641473	2643475	It was very difficult to play.
2645478	2645998	I hope they go back
2668885	2673367	No one's feeling shortchanged that the movies are not going to be playable or any of that stuff.
2674388	2675568	Granted, same thing though.
2675588	2679850	PlayStation Network certainly has its share of movies that they want you to buy, download, and all that.
2679890	2680511	Well, here's a thought.
2681731	2684073	How nice are movies going to look like on that screen?
2684993	2686414	They already look pretty damn good on the PSP screen.
2686434	2692897	Because they have a lot of digital downloads, especially almost all the movies nowadays that come out on the Blu-ray combo packs or whatever they have.
2693498	2695459	Hey, you can download a digital copy of the movie.
2696544	2697505	It's not bad.
2698325	2700727	I always thought that was restricted to the iPhone.
2700908	2701888	Nope.
2702109	2703590	It's usually iPhone.
2704070	2705892	Sony especially had the PSP ones.
2706252	2711276	But I think a lot of that... I mean, MP4s kind of play on everything.
2711656	2713418	That's the format they usually use.
2713852	2715533	I did not think about that.
2715753	2721916	So if I haven't cashed in my Tron... Why is the name escaping me right now?
2721956	2722316	The new one.
2722336	2723737	Tron Legacy.
2723797	2724157	Thank you.
2724517	2735263	If I haven't cashed in my Tron Legacy digital copy download... Just check on the back of it because usually it'll say PC, iPod, that kind of stuff.
2736003	2739365	And you may be able to convert it.
2739885	2746709	Because a lot of the portable devices, I mean Android phones and stuff like that, they don't play the iPod stuff.
2746929	2747289	Let's see.
2748170	2749490	I'm so glad we do this show in the house.
2750111	2750971	Tron Legacy.
2751411	2753473	Digital copy of feature film.
2753513	2756354	Watch it anytime, anywhere on your computer and portable device.
2756454	2757355	Works with iTunes.
2757395	2758795	Works with Windows Media Player.
2761437	2761817	I don't know.
2762197	2763298	You might be able to convert it somehow.
2766860	2769883	But, I mean, there's a lot of stuff that supports that.
2772865	2773225	That's true.
2773526	2777429	Wow, Randy said, F at UMDs, it's all about GBA movie player carts.
2777789	2778910	Oh my gosh.
2778970	2779871	Remember those at E3?
2780411	2781212	Yes, I do.
2781232	2783614	Those are still coming, too, for the 3DS, apparently.
2784295	2786456	Whatever happened to 3D movies on the 3DS?
2786817	2788278	That was a big thing they showed at E3.
2788438	2789559	I'm glad you mentioned that.
2789959	2790400	Next week.
2791460	2792241	Shut up, really?
2792521	2792661	Yeah.
2793442	2795264	Okay, there's been like no press about it.
2795324	2796985	What 3DS movies are supposed to come out next week?
2797005	2797726	It's not a movie.
2797806	2800468	It's a game, but it has the movie on it.
2800808	2809856	Tekken 3D Prime Edition has the full Tekken animated movie on there in 3D.
2811337	2812177	That's weird.
2812318	2813178	That's kind of cool though.
2813599	2817642	Yeah, it's just like, and the good one too, not the crappy live action Tekken movie.
2819533	2821233	So that'll be something for next week.
2821854	2822374	That's pretty cool.
2842455	2844078	Thanks for watching!
2857123	2860865	3D is cool in a theater.
2861365	2865527	3D is cool maybe on my TV, although I don't have a 3D TV, so I can't really speak for that.
2866427	2869949	Actually, I've seen our lobby TV is a 3D TV, and that was all right.
2871370	2875692	But I don't need 3D on the road.
2875832	2877372	I don't need to watch the movie in 3D.
2877412	2878613	I mean, it adds a little bit.
2879113	2882295	It's a little bit more immersive, but it's not like, oh, my God, night and day.
2883175	2884696	So I'm fine without 3D.
2886246	2888628	That's why I like a lot of these 3D games.
2888688	2895073	I mean, it's cool that the 3D's in there, like, for the 3DS, but I don't necessarily need it.
2895213	2897595	It doesn't add, like, a ton of extra gameplay.
2897855	2900557	Whereas, you know, that second analog stick does help quite a bit.
2901138	2901718	Just saying.
2901999	2904421	You know, if I were to choose, hey, guess what?
2904461	2907843	We can make a system with a second analog stick or we're going to have 3D graphics.
2908504	2914649	Yeah, I'd rather play with the second analog stick because that would be pretty useful.
2916641	2917962	All right, going to our chat room.
2918222	2922224	Blackwolf says about the Tron digital card.
2922244	2924104	It says, check to see when it expires.
2924144	2925845	They expire after a few months.
2926486	2927026	Oh, great.
2927066	2927966	So I might be screwed.
2928186	2928867	It's usually about a year.
2928887	2930227	I don't know.
2930287	2931088	It's been about a year.
2931108	2931188	Yeah.
2932448	2935370	Brad from PodCulture says, fuck, just torrent the movies.
2936390	2942573	Well, if I'm not able to get my digital distribution that I bought, or digital copy that I bought fair and square, I just might have to.
2943939	2948442	BlackWolf says, I can't wait for Netflix to have 3D movies so I can actually see them in 3D.
2948462	2950543	I mean, I wouldn't mind a 3D Netflix.
2950563	2953686	After everything Netflix has gone through this past year, I think a 3D version would be welcomed.
2966974	2968235	All right, let's move on with some more news.
2968655	2971696	Well, you heard that Verizon is teaming up with... I did.
2972657	2975118	Did you also hear that Disney is implementing the rental window?
2976178	2977199	I saw that on your Twitter.
2977319	2979200	Explain that quickly before we go on to the next story.
2979240	2980720	What is the rental window, so to speak?
2980740	2988184	The rental window is basically that they limit all distributors from selling copies to rental customers.
2989004	2992886	So Blockbuster, Redbox, whomever...
2993410	2996192	Thank you for watching!
3017686	3020247	Aw, sad face, my new Tron movie's not here.
3020487	3023669	I better go buy it brand new instead of, you know, renting it.
3024989	3028531	And so they go out, okay, well, maybe not Tron, because Tron you should buy when it comes out.
3028871	3033853	But no, like, okay, aw, they don't have... Mars needs moms.
3034113	3036934	Aw, they don't have, you know, Mars needs moms too.
3037334	3037914	Mom harder.
3037934	3038395	So...
3040410	3047460	Electric Mama Lou So I guess I gotta go buy it brand new so my kid can watch this.
3047941	3052548	And of course, the idiots that make these decisions higher up
3053164	3057966	Hey, look, when we did that, look, our sell-through sales have just spiked.
3057986	3059226	They're just going through the roof.
3059466	3064008	Yeah, because everybody's going to retail, buying copies and bringing it back to the rental store.
3064228	3068950	So, yes, that is going to increase the amount of sales you have in your sell-through copies.
3069230	3074092	Oh, but you forgot all the other copies that you were selling for rental that aren't there anymore.
3074212	3076193	So it actually evens out or is less.
3077433	3079376	But still, that's the decision that they make.
3079416	3083681	That's also the decision that Warner made a while back and they're now a 60-day rental window, I think.
3084903	3087286	And that's because they hate people that rent movies.
3089201	3093284	Alright, Ahamkara in our chatroom says, most of the Nintendo Channel 3D isn't good.
3093324	3095046	You could turn it off and it's no different looking.
3095446	3096487	You know, that's kind of true.
3096867	3102051	Like, have you ever, Loki, have you ever watched some of the stuff on the Nintendo Download stuff?
3102251	3102432	Yeah.
3102552	3107155	There's some really bad sketch comedy and some stuff on there that's just like, oh, this hurts.
3107195	3108156	I watched some animated shorts.
3108216	3113140	I used to have it, it used to automatically download and I was like, stop, stop, I don't want to watch this.
3113160	3113921	Yeah.
3115602	3118783	We're like 50 minutes into the show and we've done one story, so let's move on.
3119383	3122705	This is a big deal because this is two game companies people really love.
3123605	3125406	Me, I love both these companies.
3125846	3129468	And isn't it rough when you see people you love fighting?
3129848	3130929	Isn't that hard to watch?
3131329	3132289	Well, that's what's happening.
3132930	3134450	And it's a court battle.
3134550	3135151	Blizzard.
3135971	3138453	filed a notice of opposition with the U.S.
3138533	3139934	Patent and Trademark Office.
3140234	3145037	What they're trying to do, they're trying to block Valve from using the term DOTA.
3145877	3161387	Now, for those that don't know, DOTA, Defense of the Ancients, long time ago was a Warcraft 3 mod that was super freaking popular to the extent that it went on to spawn just all these kind of, I don't want to say clone games, but other types of games in that same vein.
3162268	3171836	League of Legends being the huge example of that now what's interesting about Dota is that because it was a Warcraft 3 thing how did it work?
3171916	3186489	there was one guy that started Dota one guy that continued Dota guys I so apologize if I'm fucking this up but it's like a soap opera storyline I think the guy that continued Dota went to go do League of Legends
3186849	3187189	StarCraft 2
3213638	3214599	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3238487	3242209	If you really want to kick them where it counts, do it after the game's already in beta testing.
3242610	3245852	So from that strategical standpoint, I can see that.
3246353	3260743	But Blizzard's case, quote, By virtue of that use, the Dota mark has been firmly associated in the mind of consumers with Blizzard, including to signify a highly popular scenario or variant of one of Blizzard's best-selling computer games, Warcraft 3.
3261904	3265827	A lot of fans are up in arms about this because they're saying, Blizzard, you didn't make the mod.
3266835	3272461	Yeah, and I honestly never heard of the term until a couple days ago.
3273522	3275684	But you don't really follow these types of games either, to be fair.
3276025	3279749	I don't see... Wait, I'm the lore nerd for Warcraft.
3280009	3281150	Hold on one sec, Matt.
3281751	3283533	DarkSakura, in your mind, go back three days.
3283953	3285315	Who did you think owned Dota?
3285875	3286316	I was thinking...
3288630	3291152	Honestly, I kind of glanced at it and didn't care.
3292113	3293354	Okay, that thought didn't come to your mind.
3296936	3297357	Fair enough.
3297677	3305903	TigerClaw in our chatroom says, Blizzard's version is D-O-T-A with the periods, while Valve went around that by just calling it Dota 2.
3307044	3309066	Well, apparently that wasn't good enough for Blizzard.
3310407	3311608	But Blizzard doesn't own the...
3313783	3318845	It was created for one of their games and I can see the whole association.
3319025	3320666	Legally, I don't know what standing they have.
3320746	3323066	I mean, I gotta admit, but I'm not a lawyer also.
3323146	3324367	I'm just a sick fanboy.
3325147	3331689	The only way legally that Blizzard can stand on it is if they had filed a trademark on it.
3332329	3334130	Also, Valve's game isn't Dota.
3334170	3334590	It's Dota 2.
3336571	3336831	I mean...
3339426	3342656	If I want to have a superb owl party, can I get away with that?
3343058	3344281	Were we talking about this last week?
3344853	3355861	To me, this almost reminds me of Monster Cable suing Monster Minigolf because it has the word monster in it.
3356061	3360144	I think Monster Energy Drinks does the same thing, or they sued Monster Energy Drinks.
3360544	3367769	I'm sorry, but just because a mod was used on your game doesn't mean you have the rights to that.
3367990	3369210	It doesn't work that way.
3370271	3378915	Unless they use some mod tools that you provided them, I don't see how they have the, you don't have the rights to that.
3379096	3380156	Unless they gave you the rights.
3380416	3382977	What is this that our pal Bobby Blackwolf is sending me right now?
3383038	3385879	He says, this is the link to the Dota song by Bass Hunter.
3386319	3387820	You should play this for shits and giggles.
3389041	3389541	What is this?
3391102	3392122	I hear your mod.
3403936	3407619	Lawsuits off.
3407719	3409020	Dance party instead.
3409961	3411402	Can we just dance our problems out?
3411442	3417006	Pants off, pants off.
3424332	3426534	Somebody should sue this guy for being addicting.
3430100	3435626	That same fucking melody is in like 50 goddamn songs I've heard come out of various European territories.
3439609	3439990	Moving on.
3440010	3441651	I'm suing them for that melody.
3442953	3443293	Damn it.
3444489	3447471	DarkSakura, save us from dance party.
3448892	3450513	I like to move it, move it.
3451294	3452534	How about some Steam stuff?
3453255	3454035	Speaking of Valve.
3454576	3454776	Yes.
3454996	3457878	Well, you know that whole business with the Steam hack?
3458918	3463041	It looks like they might have gotten some information for transactions.
3463281	3465623	After all, that happened between 2004 and 2008.
3465663	3466003	So no one care.
3468271	3470314	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3488075	3489056	Change your passwords anyway.
3490879	3496526	And to be perfectly honest, he suggests using Steam Guard.
3497027	3497508	Keep it on.
3498349	3501153	And my suggestion is don't put your fucking credit card on Steam.
3502274	3503556	I use PayPal for a reason.
3503916	3504197	The end.
3506035	3507156	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3522130	3522691	Yeah, that's true.
3522771	3527616	I mean, if they got information from 2008, whatever credit card I was using then, long since expired.
3527636	3534163	As long as they can't see what porn I bought on other websites between that time.
3534443	3536505	It never hurts to be careful, but don't panic.
3537306	3537786	In other words.
3538507	3540788	Hey, I like, though, that they're being very upfront about it.
3540908	3544110	I mean, the whole situation really sucks.
3544270	3548732	But, you know, I've come to learn that the hacking is one thing.
3549592	3557476	And, you know, PlayStation got hacked and Sony PlayStation got hacked and then Valve got hacked and, you know, other websites.
3557856	3562518	But then the information actually being misused to steal money is another thing.
3563098	3566679	and that's Xbox which totally denies that there has been a hacking of any sort.
3567159	3572261	So when choosing between this or this I'd rather go with well the information was hacked.
3574102	3576122	I know that sounds really weird but think about it.
3577323	3579263	Also use a different password on every website.
3579303	3580904	That's really the best practice.
3581104	3582665	You have to use a different password on every website.
3582845	3583045	You do.
3584585	3586386	And that's the only way to keep your information.
3586646	3589867	For the love of God, your bank account password better be unique.
3590487	3592208	Please tell me your bank account password is unique.
3592268	3594869	And really, your email password should be unique too.
3595229	3599211	Because to reset your password on any other website, it usually goes back to your email address.
3599511	3605333	So if anything is going to have unique passwords, your banking and your email needs to have unique passwords.
3605713	3605973	Right?
3606653	3608294	And don't have any of your passwords saved.
3608974	3611256	Yes, and don't name passwords after your kitty.
3611616	3615740	And don't be like, who was it, the president of Syria or whatever that had their password 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
3616561	3618703	Really, that's the same.
3619103	3620824	Multiple people have that.
3621425	3622466	Please don't do that.
3623066	3625008	That's the password an idiot would put on his luggage.
3627390	3627991	Alright, moving on.
3628171	3628431	Loki.
3629331	3635196	So, um, there's a big Kickstarter project featuring Double Fine.
3635476	3647364	They decided to go ahead and put this project on Kickstarter to raise money for a classic point-and-click adventure game using modern technology, or modern touch technology.
3648305	3648865	And, um,
3651082	3652602	It's broken all sorts of records.
3652682	3658144	They made their $400,000 in less than 24 hours.
3658324	3661644	That was the original amount that they were looking to raise.
3662625	3668446	And it's already well over a million dollars, I believe $1.6 million as of today.
3669266	3672787	And they've still got like 30 days to go on this project.
3674318	3674979	It's just ridiculous.
3675039	3677803	It broke records on Kickstarter.
3678544	3682228	And of course, they're making quite a bit of money off that 5% cut they get.
3683109	3683590	Kind of nice.
3684131	3684792	Kickstarter gets 5%?
3685613	3685853	They get 5%.
3686534	3687295	Oh my gosh.
3687775	3689618	Hey, they got to run their company.
3689838	3696061	Yeah, I know, but I'm just like, do people know that 5% of their money goes to... I guess they have to when they click accept, whether they read it or not.
3699783	3701865	Yeah, and so obviously this game will be made.
3702245	3713751	There's lots of... Sorry, I'm laughing because now I'm thinking about that report I saw on CNN where the people at Kickstarter were watching this Double Fine thing happening on the televisions and they were like all around...
3714031	3717034	and they busted out champagne when it passed the million dollar mark.
3717074	3719137	And like, oh, now I get why.
3719157	3722800	Because they just made $200,000 in one fucking day.
3724082	3724442	Or excuse me, $20,000.
3724723	3725824	That's still really good.
3726384	3728206	Yeah, they've got 29 days to go.
3728326	3732110	And I mean, you can still, if you want to pledge money for this, and there's no reason.
3733111	3734052	I can't fucking do math. $50,000.
3735416	3740538	Yeah, there's, you know, you can still pledge money if you want to.
3741139	3744140	And they've got, you know, all the upper tier stuff sold out.
3744200	3747741	Someone actually pledged $10,000 or more to this.
3747802	3748922	There's 10 people that pledged $5,000.
3749282	3750703	100 that pledged over $1,000.
3750763	3751963	900 that pledged over $250.
3755805	3756525	This is ridiculous.
3756606	3758467	But there's still the bottom tier stuff.
3758487	3766872	If you pledge $15, you get a copy of the game and access to the beta on Steam as well as access to the video series and private discussion community.
3767752	3774597	$30 or more, you get HD download of the documentary series with extras, digital game soundtrack, and all the other stuff before that.
3775397	3784963	And then $100, you get the original Double Fine Adventure poster, an exclusive campaign, special thanks in the game's credits, and all the previous stuff.
3786894	3792199	So you should... Well, check out Kickstarter, period, because they've got a lot of neat stuff on there.
3792519	3797664	Not necessarily just video game stuff, but, like, they had it one time, and I almost considered doing it.
3797724	3805071	Like, you could buy a set of Catan tiles that were, like, laser etched on wood, and they looked nice.
3805371	3805511	Nice.
3805531	3807213	Except they're really fucking expensive.
3807754	3808054	But, uh...
3809255	3815344	Oh, my favorite one, which I've got a... I can't remember.
3815404	3818468	It's a card game that's just very inappropriate.
3818849	3819109	That's...
3821822	3822522	I can't remember now.
3823022	3826163	DarkSakura in our chatroom says, last I heard they were almost going to break $2 million.
3826183	3828524	$1.6 million when I looked earlier is where they're at now.
3828704	3829384	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3829724	3831305	It's a fair chunk of money.
3832185	3834986	This just in, by the way, Orange Lounge Radio is starting a Kickstarter.
3835326	3838927	If you want to save the afterbirth segment, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
3840608	3843529	But seriously, now I'm like, what could we give away?
3847430	3849011	We could honestly do that.
3849912	3852414	No, we're not in it for the money.
3852574	3854035	Remember, guys, we're not in it for the money.
3854075	3857678	Cards Against Humanity is the thing that was a Kickstarter project.
3858018	3860540	It's basically this card game that's really bad.
3862281	3864423	It's not appropriate for most ages.
3868106	3870547	Did you donate to this, or did you think about donating to this?
3870587	3870888	Why not?
3872109	3873289	I didn't either, but...
3874210	3879597	We were talking about this with Bobby on his show earlier before we started tonight and he did and so we were kind of talking about this a little bit.
3879638	3888289	The last thing I donated money for was that Humble Bundle and I've played one of the games out of that.
3888850	3891554	I'm not going to buy another digital game that I'm not going to fucking play.
3892154	3893756	I mean, so... No, wait.
3894117	3896099	I do play the games in the Humble Indie Bundle.
3896299	3896459	Yeah.
3896479	3897140	That was a great deal.
3897160	3898402	But I've played only one of them.
3898442	3900004	I still have all the other, like, ten games.
3900024	3901385	But you did good for charity.
3901485	3902767	This has nothing to do with charity.
3902787	3903468	This Double Fine thing?
3903488	3904028	I understand that.
3904088	3905109	Nothing to do with charity.
3905230	3905730	Remember that.
3905890	3906691	I understand that.
3906892	3906992	And...
3908502	3936807	and that's the other thing too it's raised money faster than Child's Play did think about it Child's Play did not raise a million dollars in it well I take that back they may have at some point but over the course of three months they raised three million which is great if Child's Play then comes up with some cool perks you know to give away and I know the guys behind Penny Arcade probably could come up with some cool perks and then put a Kickstarter page up I'm sure they can get quite a bit of attention and get money raised that way um
3937967	3939267	And I think it's a cool idea.
3939347	3940728	Crowdsourcing is kind of neat.
3941448	3944269	And I can think of some ways we could utilize that.
3944329	3948390	But it's just, I don't know.
3948610	3951111	Like, they had another game.
3951131	3951891	There was another one.
3951971	3957513	It was by the guys that did, I want to say, the Tony Hawk game or something like that.
3957753	3959814	Like, one of the Tony Hawk games or something.
3960554	3972800	and they were raising money for this really terrible looking Kinect Xbox Live Arcade game where you bounce your characters around like some stupid pachinko looking machine and it was just terrible.
3972900	3974140	But I love pachinko.
3974160	3976241	But they were raising money for that.
3976801	3978022	So you're going to raise money
3978562	3979042	for this.
3979082	3982504	And then you're going to put it on Xbox Live Arcade and make more money.
3982925	3986947	Because you're not investing really any of your money because you're making all the money.
3987587	3988168	It must be nice.
3988228	3993471	I mean, hell, if I was motivated enough to program games and stuff and I could make a convincing Kickstarter, that would be cool.
3993711	3995932	Hey, look, I got all my seed money and now I'm going to make some money.
3996092	4001836	And all I have to do is provide some people some free codes or some extra tchotchkes and that's it.
4002096	4003336	Here's my honest concern.
4003797	4005758	And I think this is a legitimate concern to have.
4006538	4007459	What if the game's bad?
4008809	4015733	I mean, I realize the whole community is going to be participating and talking about this on the forums and watching the development.
4015773	4016894	And that part's really cool.
4017034	4022637	I got to give props to somebody that's willing to lift the curtain a little bit there and show you what's back there.
4023318	4029361	But I'm also a little bit like sometimes community isn't always right in their decisions.
4029442	4032183	Sometimes the hardcore gamers alienate the casual gamers.
4032203	4034765	And I talked about World of Warcraft did that a little bit.
4035365	4037787	Well, that's the same with like a pre-order, though.
4037928	4041010	I mean, you put money down for a pre-order and you get the game and it could suck.
4042151	4043613	Thing again, I'm not putting $100 down for a game.
4046198	4050361	I mean, I can see putting the $15 down, which is basically a game purchase.
4050481	4056606	And don't get me wrong, this day and age, though, $15 for a digital game is kind of expensive.
4056807	4058408	So it better be pretty good.
4058948	4059709	I beg to differ.
4059729	4060289	That's average.
4060529	4064112	For a PlayStation or Xbox game, most of them these days are 1,200 points.
4064152	4064292	That's $15.
4064353	4065774	I beg to differ.
4067155	4069717	We like them when they're 800 points, but let's be real.
4069777	4073620	There has not been a 400 points game in, like, four years.
4078369	4081391	Unless you're talking indie games, because I think indie games can go as high as 400 points.
4081671	4083772	So we'll see.
4084153	4084893	I don't know.
4088015	4090336	I just don't see myself buying this game.
4091277	4100422	Well, I'll buy it if the folks that are watching it say, gosh, this is looking great, or it's a great game, or when it actually comes out, it gets great reviews, just like any other game.
4101502	4102463	And you're part of the problem then.
4121815	4122656	No, I'm serious.
4122676	4123756	You're part of the problem then.
4125477	4128299	Or Konami says, we'll support Rhythm Fever.
4128639	4129179	No, no, no.
4130000	4132461	If they came out and said that shit, I'd say, fuck you.
4133042	4133762	Fuck you.
4134162	4134783	Fuck you.
4135063	4138345	I am not paying you a dime for a fucking game.
4138705	4141887	You make the game, and then I'll buy it if it's good.
4142087	4148831	I'm not going to be like, oh, I'm not going to make games until people pay me money first.
4149110	4150070	Yeah, that must be nice.
4150270	4152671	Konami did that.
4152891	4156153	Remember, it was Beatmania 2DX 7th style.
4156393	4160234	Remember, they said they were not going to do it until 10,000 people pre-ordered the game.
4160834	4163555	Yeah, and they're fucking assholes.
4163815	4165096	See what that karma did?
4165376	4168637	Yeah, where's your fucking Beatmania DDR series now?
4169297	4169837	Oh, that's right.
4169857	4171918	Where is your god of music now?
4172658	4175720	It's in the shitter because you fucking sucked it.
4176160	4176740	It's just like...
4178779	4186061	You know what the cherry on the top for that caramel pie was?
4186401	4188281	It's a fucking rock revolution.
4189422	4195743	Rock revolution was just like, I'm going to take a dump on this disc right here.
4197103	4197784	Here you go.
4198404	4199164	You know what, though?
4199644	4202865	If you want to ask the question, when did Bomani die?
4204651	4205892	That would be the best answer.
4206212	4210015	Now, thank God, Bomani's seemingly making a comeback.
4210035	4211276	There's a couple new arcade games.
4211797	4215380	I still say, I don't give two shits what you say, Loki.
4215820	4219203	That Rhythm Fever game is actually a lot of fun on Kinect.
4219243	4220143	No, don't get me wrong.
4220204	4221284	They're on the path.
4221745	4222746	They're on the right path.
4222926	4225067	But it's just, it still weighs away.
4225208	4225788	And I'm sorry.
4226849	4229471	They just take a lot of missteps.
4230592	4231833	Dark, gray, nope.
4233305	4235086	Flowing down the screen against a black background.
4235446	4236806	Not the smartest thing to do.
4237006	4241227	Let's go to the chat room because Bobby Blackwolf loves to correct me.
4241687	4242608	Loves to correct me.
4243908	4247329	And says there is a 400 space bucks arcade game a few weeks ago.
4247649	4249830	The Scrabble plus Risk combo.
4249910	4250350	Quarrel.
4250790	4251490	Remember Quarrel?
4252070	4253291	I didn't realize it was 400 points.
4253571	4254851	I've heard a lot of good things about that game.
4254971	4255751	I think I might get it.
4256332	4257732	Scrabble plus Risk, DarkSakura.
4257752	4258492	Doesn't that sound pretty cool?
4259292	4259833	Sounds interesting.
4261193	4261433	All right.
4263180	4263680	Moving on.
4264040	4265081	Let's talk Mass Effect.
4266081	4268021	I know a lot of you kids really love Mass Effect.
4268062	4270582	And boy, Mass Effect's just going to keep on giving.
4271683	4273663	You know, BioWare has all these studios now.
4273723	4277804	I mean, hell, Sacramento has one where we're at, even as a BioWare studio.
4278165	4283186	So when there's a big BioWare event, man, they can get all these properties out everywhere.
4283206	4285247	And that's what's happening with Mass Effect 3.
4286667	4288888	There is a Mass Effect 3 tie-in
4289608	4294389	It will take a picture of something or other on the screen and do something.
4294529	4296990	That's pretty much I think what it's going to do.
4314295	4315216	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4329511	4330392	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4348749	4375722	you get awards for collecting evidence of the crimes that happen that you catch in the mission and I guess it increases your Mass Effect 3 Galaxy at War galactic readiness rating so I guess things that you do in Infiltrator can actually affect what happens in Mass Effect 3 so that's kind of neat that they'll work together like that I imagine you kind of tie all your accounts together through the EA website and it'll work so that's kind of cool
4375950	4377991	Ty, your account's all together through the EA website.
4378271	4381752	Get FIFA download packs that you didn't ask for.
4381772	4383272	Ah, damn it.
4385893	4387893	So, it's interesting.
4387993	4395595	I mean, I'm not super huge into Mass Effect, but I know people that are, and I can't deny that Mass Effect's a huge franchise that a lot of people are really excited about.
4395655	4400837	So, I gotta admit, there are certain games where if they had the iPad app, I'd be like, that's pretty awesome.
4402117	4405079	I hope it enhances the experience and isn't just a cheap cash-in.
4405199	4411062	I'm not going to pretend if they had a SAP for a Grand Theft Auto game or something like that, I might have to pick it up.
4411162	4413543	Or like an iPad Saints Row the 3rd somehow.
4413643	4416325	Like you could control your missiles on the iPad.
4416925	4418326	No, that wouldn't be worth it.
4418346	4418986	You don't think so?
4420887	4424109	The UAV got boring pretty fast.
4425089	4427871	It's just much faster to use the other weapons.
4428331	4428692	Alright.
4429473	4432116	Release dates coming up right after one more story from DarkSakura.
4433137	4435580	Well, how about the Xbox
4439232	4441653	The Xbox... I've never played an Xbox.
4441973	4442433	The Lube?
4443074	4443714	The XU.
4444794	4445615	The XU?
4445855	4446735	Explain yourself, woman.
4446755	4448396	How about an Xbox tablet instead?
4449716	4458400	In Xbox World for April 2012, there was an announcement for a new Xbox at E3 that has a tablet.
4458840	4460961	Of course, my thought is that this is the April issue.
4460981	4461081	Hello?
4462662	4463062	Hello?
4464235	4466316	It's a little early for the April issue, I think.
4467017	4469879	It says scans of Xbox World for April 2012.
4470619	4477343	Actually, no, because April ones are on the newsstand in March, and we're getting towards the end of February.
4478584	4479945	We're getting towards the end of February?
4480085	4480405	Really?
4480486	4482247	And this could be someone working for the publisher.
4482507	4482807	It could.
4483379	4484760	We're approaching the end.
4484860	4487722	It's way over there, but we're on our way.
4487862	4488683	All right, shut up.
4488743	4494487	If I may, this may also be someone who happens to be with a publisher or something.
4494587	4494928	I don't know.
4495308	4496149	It says April 2012.
4496709	4497049	Huh?
4497470	4497810	Huh?
4498270	4500672	Yeah, but that's when Xbox World is, okay?
4501673	4501913	Fine.
4504403	4517487	Well, it says that there is a matte black media hub that is going to have a tablet and that it's going to be... I'm trying to see where... They're anticipating 399 pounds.
4517667	4519688	Yeah, this is British, of course.
4521768	4529971	But they said that it works as a remote control with your TV, as a browser when you're on the internet, has extra buttons for playing a game, or a portable display when you want to take your game with you.
4529991	4532151	So yeah, $600 roughly.
4534873	4535353	It's a rumor.
4536114	4537555	I'm thinking it's a troll.
4538596	4544522	It better be a troll because I'm looking at that picture and it shows just a tablet with no tangible buttons.
4545002	4548205	And when I see that and see Xbox wants to use this as a controller, I'm like, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9.
4549126	4551668	You need tangible controls.
4551748	4552689	No, no, no.
4552789	4558915	I think what it sounds like to me is that it's a little bit of an expansion on what they had already talked about with...
4559575	4588023	I think you can do this with Windows phones where basically you can browse your I don't even know what the fuck they call it well a dashboard you can browse around there using your Windows phone and you can queue up stuff like that maybe that they add that to a tablet that's running like the Windows phone OS or whatever or hope to god that they update it to like Android or something and then they can you know have some buttons on there so that you can play like different Xbox Live arcade games or something like that on there
4588402	4589243	I could see an app.
4590485	4590845	Maybe.
4590965	4597114	But isn't it funny that this story comes up right after we were talking about Mass Effect and how it's kind of tying into tablets?
4597514	4599116	Well, here's the other funny thing, too.
4599136	4600358	A precursor of things to come?
4600698	4605625	I have to find it, but there was also the same rumor for the PlayStation 3 that they were...
4605965	4609027	Oh wait, no, we talked about it last week, where they were going to come up with a tablet, remember?
4609287	4612489	Oh yeah, the whole, it had been patented or something like that, right?
4612649	4612929	Yeah.
4613290	4616011	The patent doesn't always mean reality.
4616131	4629780	My response to that is, you already have some of that with the PSP can tie into the PS3 a little bit, and plus the whole, god, they were showing it at E3, the whole Vita and that dungeon crawler game, hasn't it changed its name like three times now?
4630240	4634923	The Dungeon Crawler game that's on the Vita that, you know, you can pause your game and then pick it up on the PS3 and all that stuff.
4634943	4636243	Dungeon Hunters Alliance, I think?
4636664	4638245	I don't know what the hell they're calling it now.
4640546	4641246	But, yeah.
4642967	4649811	So, I mean, theoretically, you can already have that technology if you really want to use it, but it's expensive because that means you have to own a $249 Vita and a $299 PlayStation 3, so...
4656298	4660459	$299!
4656318	4660459	$299!
4656458	4660459	That was a lot cheaper than it used to be.
4661340	4663380	It is, but that's where it's at now.
4663820	4665401	Because Blu-ray players are cheap too.
4665981	4666921	Came down with that technology.
4666941	4667861	Alright, let's move on.
4667881	4677564	We're going to travel around the world and talk about release dates and see what's coming out to a GameStop or a Best Buy or Walmart or whatever you like to shop Amazon near you.
4679345	4684166	Actually, earlier this week the Nintendo 3DS Pearl Pink came out.
4685573	4687976	Rhythm Heaven Fever
4705385	4706506	on the Nintendo Wii.
4707966	4708947	And it's only $29.99.
4710107	4711248	They did a big push for that.
4711488	4714089	There was like a whole launch event in LA and all this stuff.
4714390	4716111	Yeah, I fucking hate Rhythm Heaven.
4716811	4717151	Why?
4717211	4718832	It's a frustrating fucking game.
4719192	4721153	It looks interesting, but... It's not very fun.
4721713	4722734	I'm kind of over the Wii.
4722934	4725395	The Wii's just kind of sitting sad in the corner.
4726336	4729137	B-Units build it for Nintendo DS.
4730498	4730638	Um...
4732541	4735567	Hakuoki, Demon of the Fleeting Blossom
4738885	4740266	I believe that's a visual novel game.
4740966	4759814	BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and because this week you are getting the early adopter edition of the first run PlayStation Vita, although they do say PS Vita, so Vita, it is also now coming out on the Vita as well.
4760534	4767277	Also on the Vita, Formula 1 2011, FIFA Soccer, Virtua Tennis 4 World Tour,
4769406	4772590	and Luminous Electronic Symphony.
4774091	4775113	Rayman Origins.
4777235	4777716	That's right.
4777776	4780639	Vita games are now going to hit stores because people have those early bundles.
4780940	4785425	And to be honest, they've already been hitting stores because there's no street dates on the first party games.
4785445	4787187	Those were already out for a few weeks now.
4787448	4787748	Interesting.
4789210	4792574	Oh, I'm going to go take this box home and just read the instruction manual.
4792594	4795277	Well, if you have a Japanese system, it's useful because they're region-free.
4795497	4797079	Oh, that's right.
4798181	4804428	Other stuff on other systems, we've got, of course, UFC Undisputed 3 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4806550	4823024	Tales of the Abyss on the 3DS The Sims 3 Hidden Springs expansion for the PC Twisted Metal on PlayStation 3 this week which includes Twisted Metal Black Mario & Sonic at the London Olympic Games on the 3DS B-Units build it on the Wii
4824044	4833470	Grand Slam Tennis 2 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 Tekken 3D Prime Edition Dungeon Hunter Alliance Michael Jackson The Experience HD Asphalt Injection Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 Ben 10 Galactic Racing
4848520	4865537	Reality Fighters although I thought that was supposed to be next month Sledgehammer for the Xbox 360 which is a weird racing game with big rigs Metal Gear Solid 3 oh I'm sorry that's next week getting ahead of myself this is a big week on the Vita isn't it
4865757	4868038	HotShotsGolfWorldTour
4895501	4896443	or World Invitational.
4896503	4897605	World Tour is the PSP one.
4898247	4899609	So a big week for the Vita.
4899950	4900291	Of course.
4900311	4901774	That's what happens when a new system launches.
4902472	4904473	All right, let's go to Japan.
4904713	4906413	Talk about what games are coming out in Japan this week.
4906453	4912175	On the Xbox 360, Binary Domain and WRC2, Fio World Rally Championship.
4912255	4913676	Those are coming out on the 16th.
4914556	4916877	On the PlayStation 3, they also get Binary Domain.
4917557	4921038	And the same game there, WRC2, Fio World Rally Championship.
4921238	4923739	So both those games on the main consoles.
4924459	4926400	Checking out the PlayStation Vita in Japan.
4926940	4933508	and Kyokugen Dashutsu ADV Zenin Shibodesu comes out this week.
4933628	4935811	I have no idea what the hell game this is.
4936411	4940376	It looks like there's pretty anime people on it and pretty anime creatures.
4940396	4941177	Oh, there's a little trailer here.
4941197	4941858	What is this all about?
4941878	4943560	What are you talking about?
4945219	4945780	Anime tie-in game
4959736	4978752	As they do get a lot of those out in Japan But that's really the only big release on the Vita this week in Japan Going over to the Nintendo systems real quick I want to see if the Wii or the 3DS has anything Not so much on the Wii Releases are kind of drying up there The regular DS doesn't have anything How about the 3DS?
4979232	4987559	Looking there quickly Oh, this is a big one for the 3DS New Love Plus, just in time for Valentine's Day Out from Konami
4988480	4990462	New Love Plus makes its way out this week.
4990802	4995206	This is where... Can I read the description for this?
4995246	4995806	This is great.
4996587	4999089	Introduce your friends to your girlfriend.
4999469	5004413	With the new functions on the Nintendo 3DS, your game life and your real life will be blurred.
5004833	5008136	Makes use of the gyro sensor to take pictures of your girlfriend.
5008516	5013020	Find the angle that best captures her beauty now that you can control the camera physically.
5013300	5014781	By beauty, we mean her panties.
5015221	5017903	You can also share photographs of your friends with her.
5018343	5021586	She will remember their faces and integrate firmly into your life.
5022046	5025608	Her attitude and her personality changes as the two of you date.
5026049	5029271	See how she acts more familiar with you as you know her better.
5029931	5031732	Yes, this is the New Love Plus series.
5031812	5035895	This is the girlfriend in my pocket or Tamagotchi with tits.
5036255	5042920	I don't know what else to say about New Love Plus, but I love that it's coming out on Valentine's Day.
5043921	5051676	Forever Alone They just put that picture on the cover
5052714	5053694	That would be awesome.
5055035	5061998	If you're looking for something, I don't know, different on the 3DS, you know, maybe that other people, like people like you and me might actually be interested in.
5062018	5062438	Hey, you know what?
5062618	5064799	This is kind of... Oh, sorry.
5064839	5065179	Go ahead.

5086175	5087375	It's a terrible looking game.
5090956	5093337	Frisbee in our chatroom says, Tidagachi.
5094217	5095118	Tidagachi.
5096298	5097978	Anyhow, what were you going to derail me with, Loki?
5097998	5105560	I was going to say that it would be cool if they came up with some sort of tower defense game with all those internet memes thrown in there.
5105920	5107801	Like an internet meme tower defense game.
5108530	5109772	Who owns the right?
5109832	5113136	I mean, we were talking about copyright earlier with Dota and this community-made stuff.
5113436	5116300	Who technically owns the rights to Forever Alone?
5116460	5117000	I don't know.
5117281	5118182	And Rage Comics.
5118282	5121426	Nancat Adventure came out in indie games this week.

5163414	5168317	Asuka in our chatroom asks, Do the Tidagotchis leave digipoop on the screen too?
5170279	5171900	Remember that on the old Tamagotchis?
5171920	5174101	You used to have to push the button to scoop their poop?

5184294	5186615	That was a direct release from the Tamagotchi.
5187556	5189957	I don't know, some guys might be into that in 3D and all.
5190557	5191057	You never know.
5191077	5192437	My Devimon was a big shitter.
5194959	5198320	Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week, Loki.
5199187	5204013	So the PS3 did get another firmware update this week and it speeds up web browsing.
5205195	5215408	Apparently according to the notes for the 4.1 update, also they changed your account from the PlayStation Network account to the Sony Entertainment Network account.
5216209	5229163	and other things, improved display speed for the browser and I believe they also added Dropbox support so you can use that for storing images online.
5229784	5230785	Huh, I didn't realize that.
5231425	5232326	Yeah, it's pretty cool.
5233828	5234789	Some other cool stuff.
5234849	5239372	Of course, there was this whole PlayMemories thing that they were teasing a little bit ago.
5239633	5246518	It's a video editing app that's going to be part of the PlayStation 3 as well as a PC and mobile suite.
5247799	5255166	And they've included 5 gigabytes of storage as well that's going to be on a cloud-based service.
5256467	5256627	And...
5258288	5265870	It does work with iOS and Android devices and apparently you'll be able to edit images and videos and stuff like that.
5266951	5271552	I can't imagine though image editing on the PS3 would be very easy.
5271572	5275153	I don't know, just the controller or whatever mouse.
5277574	5277954	Alright.
5279015	5285677	Real quickly, speaking of Sony things, one of the big things that people are looking forward to on the PlayStation Vita or the PlayStation 3
5287202	5289144	The Final Fantasy X re-release.
5303777	5304738	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5319017	5323962	Producer Shinji Hashimoto was answering some fan questions about some of the Final Fantasy games.
5324422	5331808	And somebody asked about, hey, is the PlayStation 3 and Vita re-release of Final Fantasy X, is it a remake or is it a remaster?
5332589	5336452	And Hashimoto said directly, it is a remaster.
5337133	5341156	So think like the Shadow of the Colossus HD thing that came out not too long ago.
5342077	5344841	I wouldn't even say it's... Well, that wouldn't be so bad.
5345522	5348385	Hopefully it's not like the Metal Gear Solid stuff.
5348405	5349907	They look kind of blurry and weird.
5350588	5356976	Now, he also went so far to say that the screen is much prettier than the original, but he didn't really elaborate on that whatsoever.
5357357	5358138	What can I do for you?
5361397	5363058	Give me Final Fantasy 7 next.
5363819	5364840	How about first?
5364960	5366421	That's what all the fans are saying.
5366441	5367882	But I get it, though.
5367982	5369523	It's easier to do this.
5369744	5378130	I mean, there was an excellent point that was made is that a lot of the stuff that was in Final Fantasy 7 was still kind of sprite-based, whereas everything in Final Fantasy 10 was full 3D.
5378491	5381053	So it's much easier to take Final Fantasy 10 and just, you know...
5381853	5390458	assign it to the new resolution, give it some higher res textures, and maybe remake the menu and go back into some of the things.
5390478	5393720	I think they'll do some other little things to sweeten the pot, I'm sure.
5393800	5397462	Maybe like a bonus summon or a bonus dungeon or something else.
5398042	5400843	I think it'll pay tribute well enough to the original.
5400904	5404806	I like Final Fantasy X. I know Final Fantasy X has its share of haters, but...
5405806	5406607	I thought it was great.
5407287	5410650	Still to this day, in my opinion, has the best summon of all time.
5411070	5411430	Shiva.
5411690	5413232	Of course, when she comes out, snap.
5413492	5414092	Bing.
5415033	5415273	Great.
5417134	5417335	So.
5419296	5419616	Anyhow.
5421177	5423979	How about we travel down memory lane a little bit?
5424920	5425520	Sounds plan-like.
5425541	5427122	You know, we always on this show...
5428450	5428770	DarkSakura.com
5445843	5447605	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5472076	5472376	Puzzle Bobble
5492874	5494015	And it's cute!
5494115	5495536	It's super cute!
5495936	5496637	I love the game.
5498918	5500840	There were two different versions of the original.
5501400	5508145	There was Puzzle Bobble that came out in Japan only in 1994 on a Taito B system hardware.
5508585	5509886	And it was originally called Bubble Buster.
5510666	5513889	And then down the line there was the Neo Geo version of Puzzle Bobble.
5514469	5515010	Wait a minute.
5515030	5516251	Puzzle Bobble was anti-drug?
5516291	5516371	Pfft.
5536508	5538590	Are we talking just an FBI warning in the beginning?
5538610	5539570	Winners don't use drugs?
5540051	5540251	Yes.
5540291	5540771	Oh, okay.
5541351	5547316	And the title was retained for the US, Canada, and Europe on consoles.
5548336	5553040	So basically, you have different colored balls for different reasons.
5553920	5554541	They're bubbles.
5555642	5562767	But you have different colors and you have to... Turn the crank to launch the balls.
5563747	5565929	Yes, turn the crank to launch the balls.
5566584	5567324	That's what they're doing!
5567545	5567825	Yes.
5571427	5586355	At any rate, you have a little pointer, and yes, it's attached to a crank that Bub and Bob move, and you can bounce these little bubbles up to other bubbles, and when you get three in a row touching, then they pop.
5587176	5592699	You may have a bunch of one color already up there in a neat colorful pattern, but it gets really complicated, trust me.
5592879	5595701	I noticed that when they touch the balls together, they explode.
5599389	5611057	So they go in a direct line along the pointer, and as you do a few more in a row, then the ceiling starts to drop down.
5611217	5616561	When your bubbles hit the very bottom line, then you're game over.
5617642	5620684	If you don't know what this game is, then crawl up from under the rock.
5620804	5622685	No dipping your balls below the line.
5626812	5628192	I think DarkSakura's mad at me.
5628332	5631073	I think DarkSakura's mad at me.
5631413	5634114	Anyway, um... Which were your favorite balls?
5634154	5634714	The blue ones?
5638655	5640135	She's trying not to laugh.
5640236	5641856	She thinks she's mad, but she's not.
5642056	5642796	Shut up.
5643636	5644337	You're a bitch.
5646777	5649398	At any rate, it has a different... She's really busting your balls there.
5650962	5651903	It's good when your balls drop.
5674056	5678357	Your score actually will go to 20 points and then 40 and then 80.
5678817	5680958	So it's an exponential scoring system.
5681278	5684039	If you rub enough balls together, there's exponential growth.
5684059	5687740	Maximum is 50,000 points that you get for clearing it within five seconds or less.
5688180	5691021	And then it drops down to zero over the next minute.
5691841	5693643	You do have two player modes.
5693663	5694404	They're not in rounds.
5694444	5709103	You just each have the arena and the same arrangement, but when you get a large clump broken, it goes on to the opponent's side, kind of the way that how Puyo Puyo works, which is another one of my favorites.
5709525	5714009	So yeah, it's Bub and Bob, or as they were doing in Japan, Bubloon and Bobloon.
5715310	5721074	And it's their same animation from Bubble Bobble, actually closer to Bubble Symphony.
5721995	5724317	And it also has all the enemies in it.
5724617	5728660	So the red one is... and I'll do both names...
5729941	5734786	The English name was Super Socket and Japanese name was Invader.
5734906	5738149	The yellow one is Hullaballoon or Pull Pull.
5739551	5740932	Green is Willy Whistle or Drunk.
5741553	5743374	Blue is Bubble Buster or Zen-Chan.
5743715	5745176	Purple is Beluga or Monsta.
5746197	5747859	Orange is Coily or Bonnie Bow.
5748719	5751242	Black is Incendo or Hide Gonsu.
5751682	5753344	And white is Stoner or Midas.
5754591	5755912	And who doesn't want to name their balls?
5756753	5760696	So, for all the games that came out, there are a bunch of them, and I will go pretty much in order.
5761116	5767501	There was Puzzle Bobble, Puzzle Bobble 2, which was called Best to Move Again in the US.
5768501	5771784	Puzzle Bobble 2X, which I believe is the one that I had on Saturn.
5772284	5779129	Puzzle Bobble 3 in 1986, Puzzle Bobble 4, Puzzle Bobble Mini on the Neo Geo Pocket Color, Super Puzzle Bobble in 1999.
5780450	5795158	Azumanga Puzzle Dio, which was based off of Azumanga Dio from 2001, Super Puzzle Bobble 2, Super Puzzle Bobble All-Stars, Puzzle Bobble Mobile, which I am playing on my phone, Puzzle Bobble Versus, which was for the N-Gage.
5795999	5797019	Who remembers the N-Gage?
5797900	5801642	Best Move Deluxe on PSP, Ultra Best Move on Xbox, Puzzle Bobble DS, and
5802522	5826125	Hipate Buzzle Bobble, which was Bust a Move DS, Ultra Puzzle Bobble Pocket, which was Bust a Move Deluxe in the US, and Bust a Move Ghost in Europe, Bust a Move Bash on Wii, Bust a Move Online, Bust a Move Mobile for the newer mobile phones in 2008, Space Puzzle Bobble, which was called Space Bust a Move or Puzzle Bobble Galaxy in Europe.
5826145	5827086	Space Bust a Move?
5827826	5843959	Balls in Space, Puzzle Bobble Plus, Puzzle Bobble Live, Puzzle Bobble for iOS, which is Busted Move, Puzzle Bobble 3D, which was Busted Move Universe on the 3DS, New Puzzle Bobble, aka New Busted Move for iOS, and Puzzle Bobble Online.
5845020	5845460	That came out in 2011.
5846601	5847282	There were clones.
5847522	5848503	Who remembers Snood?
5850242	5850542	I don't.
5850662	5852523	Fortunately, I have sold Snood.
5853164	5856466	Yeah, my friend's mom was hooked on that stupid game.
5856486	5857666	It's like, play the real thing!
5858387	5863109	There's Frozen Bubble and Bubble Shooter, you know, which I actually... All those crappy Facebook games.
5863470	5863750	Yeah.
5863790	5864210	Yeah, yeah.
5864690	5866611	Like, Jungle Quest was not one of them.
5867632	5868232	No Jungle.
5869093	5872815	And there's actually even a version of it that comes built in with Linux.
5873015	5874496	There's one on Google+, too, I think.
5874576	5875836	What about Puzzle de Pon?
5876156	5877277	I love Puzzle de Pon.
5877297	5879037	That's nothing to do with... Not like that.
5879457	5880878	There are no balls in Puzzle de Pon.
5880978	5881398	Yeah, there are.
5882258	5883419	It's exactly the same thing.
5883459	5886240	So anyway, that's your game is Puzzle Bobble.
5887600	5888240	For everything.
5890201	5892902	One question I want to ask that's very important that we didn't address.
5893803	5898984	What in the actual fuck was this box art on the PlayStation 2 for Super Bus to Move?
5899144	5900085	It was redonk.
5901680	5903001	I'm gonna post this link in chat.
5903061	5903802	It's from Amazon.
5903822	5906784	I apologize, it's big, but that's the only place I need to find the box art.
5907104	5917512	For those listening on the podcast, just go to your favorite retail site, Amazon, whatever, look for Super Bust-a-Move on the PlayStation 2 and tell me, what in the fuck is that box art?
5917792	5924817	It is a baby blowing a bubble, and in the sunglasses you see glimpses of the... It's... What...
5925097	5927518	The Saturn one was freaking creepy looking.
5927538	5928478	That is fucking scary.
5928838	5929598	Who would buy that?
5929698	5932139	No, look at the Saturn version.
5932579	5933939	Let me see the Saturn version.
5935539	5936920	Ah, his face is melting.
5937020	5938620	No, his eyes are being pinned open.
5941801	5945042	I'm like, Taito, what kind of crack do you think Americans are on?
5945642	5950583	I think that company or whoever they hired for marketing was the same one that launched the PlayStation 3.
5953716	5958660	I did, however, play a shitload of that game on Saturn.
5959501	5963064	Like, I would just sit in front of it for hours and scream at it.
5963344	5968228	It's one of those games that you see it in the arcade, and if it's 25 cents, you can't help but just check it out, you know?
5968368	5969308	Like, even to this day.
5969569	5971610	I've played this game even recently.
5972030	5972811	Fucking creepy!
5974112	5975693	But it was an awesome game!
5976734	5977755	It still is awesome.
5978900	5979281	All righty.
5979521	5979841	There it is.
5979861	5980902	Your classic game of the week.
5981783	5982444	Puzzle Bobble.
5983105	5984606	Or, if you want, Bust a Move.
5985167	5986048	But not that creepy.
5986068	5987890	The Japanese box art is so much better.
5988010	5989432	Not that creepy Super Bust a Move.
5989452	5989912	Look at that.
5990253	5992115	That should be what it was in the U.S.
5992155	5995979	Instead it was a stupid dude trapped in a bubble with his eyes pinned open.
5996039	5997360	That gives me creep nightmares.
5999035	6001838	That is definitely one of the monsters in Silent Hill on the box there.
6002418	6002678	All right.
6003199	6004760	That's going to do it for part A of our show.
6004800	6005381	But guess what?
6005501	6006842	We are not done yet, kids.
6006882	6008263	We've got plenty more show to come.
6008283	6010065	We've got some rapid fire news coming up.
6010125	6010785	Some more news.
6010805	6011706	Your emails.
6011766	6012627	The FUs of the week.
6012927	6014288	And Twitter topics.
6014608	6015209	And no more balls.
6015549	6015990	Twitter.com.
6016630	6017590	Well, I don't know about that.
6017911	6021012	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send in your Twitter topics.
6021572	6025674	And, and, and, and, the Skype line will be open very soon.
6025934	6028415	Skype us at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
6028455	6028996	But not just yet.
6029036	6031677	That's all coming up in part B. So stay tuned, everybody.
6037734	6045241	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio with episode number 445 live on this Sunday evening.
6045261	6048664	2-12-12 is the date today.
6049064	6053688	Join us, of course, live via our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
6053708	6054589	We've got quite a good show.
6054789	6057772	Considering we're up against the Grammys tonight, got quite a good showing.
6058112	6059093	And I am very proud.
6059193	6059874	I have to say this.
6059994	6061956	I'm very proud of the chatters tonight.
6062356	6083620	because despite everything that's going on in the world right now there wasn't a single person now of course now that I'm gonna say this everybody's gonna do this but there wasn't a single person that came in a chat tonight and said hey did you guys hear that Whitney Houston died because I was so waiting for that because inevitably when something big happens in the world that really has nothing to do with video games it'll get brought up anyway it's
6083680	6084641	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6106172	6108253	on the way home from the park, all Whitney Houston.
6108613	6112375	Solid Whitney Houston from like... And it was like three songs.
6112895	6113735	All Whitney Houston.
6113935	6114836	It was ridiculous.
6115056	6116997	Obviously, it's a tragic loss.
6117037	6118837	And they all sound very the same.
6119057	6120178	It doesn't have... Oh, stop it.
6120658	6122259	It doesn't really have anything to do with video games.
6123246	6126647	To be fair, I totally have I want to dance with somebody in SingStar.
6126967	6128788	So she was in SingStar.
6129048	6136110	So tip of the hat to a famous SingStar inspiration, I guess, if you want to say that.
6136731	6136991	All right.
6137031	6141892	But I will give a big gold star to all our chatters tonight for keeping it on topic.
6142232	6149155	You know, even despite all of the unfortunate that happened with Miss Houston, there's not really a lot of talk about the Grammys either.
6149275	6152496	So I know you guys are focused and I appreciate that.
6153467	6154268	All right, let's move on.
6154308	6157472	Let's get back into some rapid-fire news.
6157512	6161896	We're gonna do some quick news stories, and then we'll get back into the longer stuff.
6161936	6165220	So, Loki, start us off with some rapid-fire news.
6165881	6170326	Microsoft finally, or Microsoft or LucasArts, I haven't really decided who announced this, but...
6170826	6173790	They've announced the date for Kinect Star Wars.
6174251	6174631	I know.
6174912	6175753	Let's get excited.
6176934	6178016	It's coming in April.
6178376	6179137	It's not a joke.
6179337	6180419	It's on April 3rd.
6180999	6186086	That is probably the closest date they could have added to get it near April Fool's Day.
6186707	6187368	Although, actually...
6189542	6193505	Yeah, because April 1st is a Sunday.
6194926	6200009	I got to say that the Xbox that looks like R2-D2 looks pretty kick-ass, though.
6200249	6202170	Yeah, so that'll be coming out on the same day as well.
6203171	6210396	Now, here's the thing, and I know we've talked about this before, but really, really, they're going to have dancing in there?
6210836	6212557	I mean, that just looks stupid.
6212597	6213238	Shut up.
6213338	6214518	They put dancing in there?
6215719	6216340	Oh, my God.
6218499	6219900	That's Star Wars?
6220061	6221702	That is Connect Star Wars.
6221943	6223404	That looks like Dance Masters.
6223524	6224745	Yeah, exactly.
6225286	6227268	Is that like cantina dancing or something?
6227608	6228549	They're gonna have dancing.
6228589	6230171	Look, I see Jabba the Hutt back there.
6230211	6233114	It's like you can be one of his sluts dancing there.
6233314	6234535	Dance for me, slut.
6237438	6240259	Wasn't that a line that Lucas put back in Return of the Jedi?
6240279	6242020	Yeah, he should have.
6243200	6244381	Yeah, so that will be coming out.
6245341	6252084	And, of course, on my eyes in our chat room gives us the greatest line from the trailer, lightsaber on.
6253804	6255065	Remember, it's all about the voice commands.
6256246	6261729	And I'm telling you, I played this game, and, um, oh my god.
6261749	6262490	Yeah, you played it.
6262750	6263450	Oh my god.
6263670	6264491	No, no, no, no, no.
6265111	6266812	I think you need to see this as well.
6266832	6267273	Oh no.
6268393	6269074	Make it stop.
6273476	6274817	It's just stupid, Loki.
6274837	6280861	You know, that little picture is not helping the rumors about C-3PO's sexuality, because you know that's out there in the fanverse.
6280901	6281381	I'm just saying.
6282141	6282622	I'm just saying.
6284543	6285003	I'm just saying.
6285791	6290982	All I gotta say is the one that they had at Disneyland to dance off much better than this shit.
6292345	6293547	And you know he's dancing to Gaga.
6295985	6297506	He was programmed this way, baby.
6301168	6307931	I just hope that it's way better than the versions I've played because those were not good.
6308531	6311832	That is supposed to be coming out April 3rd.
6313153	6313813	Some other stuff.
6314374	6315514	Super Mario Bros.
6315614	6319036	Crossover 2 is now out.
6319076	6319996	Super Mario Bros.
6320056	6323878	Crossover is definitely something that's infringing on all sorts of copyrights, but
6324178	6324498	DarkSakura.com
6341415	6358582	and basically what version 2 offers you is you still get to play as multiple characters including Mario, Luigi, Link, Samus, Simon Belmont, Mega Man, Bass, Bill Riser, Ryu and Sophia the 3rd from Blaster Master.
6358702	6359843	Yes, Blaster Master.
6360525	6374254	and then they all have alternate looks because you can also cycle through the game or they cycle randomly through versions of the levels including NES, Super NES and Game Boy styles throughout the game as well.
6374695	6383440	Also, apparently Demon Returns, Super Demon Returns and I guess the Super Mario Bros.
6383500	6389705	style game from the DS's Retro Game Challenge 2 are different versions as well.
6390625	6394370	Um, so, uh, neat.
6394690	6397734	And there's also a picture that shows Dr. Wily in there.
6397994	6400237	So I don't know if you can play as him.
6400257	6401158	That'd be weird.
6401899	6401999	Um,
6403604	6404984	So that's that.
6405225	6411726	By the way, quickly, the chatters are asking for the Star Wars dance party pictures.
6412287	6412747	I'll link them.
6412767	6416568	Yeah, link them and then Ranma can get them up on the Tumblr for the podcast listeners that want to see it too.
6416608	6417808	It's so disturbing.
6417868	6418849	Yeah, it is a little disturbing.
6418889	6420189	Just a warning, don't click.
6422245	6446026	and then uh finally um apparently there's a rumor that certain and i mean this is probably gonna be happening certain um people that put stuff on the app store are using bots to automatically download their games and boost their rankings in the app store to get more people to download it um
6447842	6452124	I mean, I don't even have to really look into that to know that that's probably true.
6452184	6458808	I mean, there's people that put artificially high review scores to boost their reviews and stuff, so why not?
6459368	6466092	Now's a great time to mention if you want to leave your totally legitimate five-star reviews for Orange Lounge Radio on the iTunes Store, we'd really appreciate it.
6466412	6468974	By the way, click the subscribe button four or five times while you're there.
6471007	6471848	I'm kidding, maybe.
6472248	6473589	I'm not about the five-star reviews, though.
6474489	6475610	So, all right.
6476691	6477851	I would not be surprised at all, by the way.
6477871	6481473	Looking at some of those games that are in the top 20, like, you really look at, like, how did this get here?
6481894	6482154	Really?
6482294	6486356	This game is beating Angry Birds and Where's My Water and the stuff you expect to see in the top 10?
6486697	6486977	Really?
6488218	6488598	Interesting.
6489438	6494141	Speaking of games you expect to see in the top 10 on the iOS store, Tiny Tower.
6494522	6494782	Look.
6494802	6495282	Look.
6496202	6499764	Hate on this game all you want, but it is really fucking addicting.
6500044	6502225	And how many addicts are playing Tiny Tower?
6502245	6509549	10 million, according to a tweet from Ian Marsh that tweeted this week that 10 million folks have downloaded Tiny Tower.
6509589	6510390	That's on iOS.
6510410	6513171	That's not counting Android or I think that's it.
6513211	6515052	It's only also on Android, I believe.
6515492	6518173	It has a million daily active users.
6518454	6520695	I am no longer an active player of this game.
6520755	6521395	I finally quit.
6521895	6523176	I stopped the crack a few months ago.
6523556	6524417	How tall is your tower?
6526058	6527258	I know it pales in comparison to yours.
6527278	6529600	I want to say it was like 82 stories or something like that.
6529740	6531081	I still have to get the new shops.
6531221	6533202	Well, actually, no, I did get the new shops last time.
6534083	6535343	I still have the... Oh, that's right.
6535383	6536444	There are new shops, huh?
6536644	6537205	Damn you.
6538145	6539146	Don't say things like that.
6540366	6540847	Let me look.
6541347	6543689	Because you asked, I'm going to fire up my tiny tower.
6543709	6543989	Look at this.
6544009	6547511	I haven't touched this crack in a long time.
6547864	6550385	DarkSakura, did you ever get... You got sucked into Tiny Tower for a little bit, didn't you?
6550405	6551065	Yeah, I stopped.
6551165	6551946	Did you finally stop?
6552246	6553146	I stopped it a while back.
6554127	6554627	Good for you.
6555307	6555647	Let's see.
6555747	6559589	My tower is... I do not want to get the plant game.
6559629	6560229	Leave me alone.
6560930	6561310	Let's see.
6561330	6563151	86 stories tall.
6563571	6564151	I was close.
6565211	6570113	And my 86th floor, for the record, is the Nerd Cave Apartments.
6570834	6571234	Very cool.
6572517	6575319	Bimani fans are looking forward to a new arcade game called Sound Vortex Booth.
6575359	6577340	This is going to be playable at the AOU 2012 Amusement Expo.
6577360	6581824	It's kind of a new Bimani game.
6592171	6592932	Thank you for watching!
6613895	6622760	Um, also making its way to AOU, an arcade version of Dance Evolution, uh, a new version of Ubeat as well.
6622880	6624541	And I didn't know this series was still going.
6624942	6627303	Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania XG3.
6627803	6631345	I had no idea that series was still alive and kicking, but there you go.
6632706	6648564	and lastly from me, Nintendo of America has hired a new spokesperson and following in the footsteps of what Carrie Underwood has been a Nintendo spokesperson, Beyonce has been a Nintendo spokesperson, who could live up to those great, great musicians?
6649005	6650807	How about Oogie?
6652540	6654360	Oogie is a Jack Russell Terrier.
6654460	6654921	That's right.
6654981	6657961	Nintendo has hired a dog to be their next spokesperson.
6658341	6665683	Now, to be fair, this dog is very famous because this dog appears in the movie The Artist, which is like, you know, the movie they all say is going to win the Oscar.
6666063	6666263	Right.
6666563	6667503	I haven't seen the movie.
6667523	6671564	And apparently the dog plays one of those like way too cute roles that, you know, is very memorable.
6672204	6673865	And what game will he be pimping?
6674145	6674625	Guesses.
6675025	6675485	Guesses.
6676991	6691514	Nintendogs of course Nintendogs plus cats which I have something to say about that in a second and and and the Pearl Pink 3DS aww for the record I found Nintendogs plus cats in the clearance bin at Fry's nice how much?
6691534	6703756	14 bucks I'm not surprised they need to fucking sell those they probably have like tons on their shelves people are like hey this is just Nintendogs again there's no cats yeah
6705795	6710958	Alright, DarkSakura Well, how about Sonic?
6711619	6724687	Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing is getting a sequel And it will be out, it looks like, at the end of the year So hey, fun, I tried to play it, I didn't really care for it
6726228	6737141	and then there is, and more racing news, LittleBigPlanet Karting that will be coming out and it was actually announced via Twitter.
6738722	6748050	DarkTetsuya said this in the Mod Forums, but isn't LittleBigPlanet Karting basically Mod Nation Racers?
6748470	6755536	It is, and they actually do have a poster for it that is on the NeoGAF forums, I think.
6757257	6772527	and um you know what though yes it is but i think that this will be more fun i you know what as much like i want to hate on this but i can't be why because little big planet seriously is like the best thing sony has right now in my opinion i mean i fucking love those games
6773847	6780110	The last bit of news has to do with Rock Band and it's the releases that are coming out I believe around Valentine's Day.
6780950	6785652	So it's the Gold Star My Heart Pack and here is what's on it.
6786313	6789514	It's Alone by Heart which I freaking want that song.
6791135	6791735	I want that song.
6792175	6793936	Are you going to sing it in the privacy of your own home?
6794502	6797385	I'll sing it with people around if you want to hear me try to break my voice.
6798406	6804972	There's To Be With You by Mr. Big, Every Rose Has Its Thorn by Poison, and the Rick Roland song.
6805452	6805873	Wait, wait, wait.
6805913	6808775	You mean I finally have an excuse to do this to the listeners?
6809316	6809676	Yes.
6810357	6812259	I've been waiting 10 years.
6812919	6813800	10 freaking years.
6814040	6814881	Never going to give you up.
6815262	6817323	Oh, to get trolled by an ad on YouTube.
6819225	6819865	That's what I get.
6819965	6825008	Oh yeah, and for To Be With You and Every Rose Has Its Thorn, it's got pro guitar and bass expansions.
6828069	6828869	Delayed punchline.
6828909	6829530	I don't care.
6834315	6836896	Have you noticed that he still looks exactly like that?
6864677	6865758	I would play that song.
6866198	6866879	That would be awesome.
6866919	6867439	What, alone?
6867699	6868240	No, not alone.
6868300	6868740	Fuck alone.
6869120	6872022	No, I'm talking about... Fuck you, Heart is awesome.
6873223	6874084	We saw Heart.
6874384	6877586	I know we did see Heart, like two songs, because we were late to the concert.
6878267	6880909	Best concert lineup ever.
6881609	6883230	Heart and Journey.
6883831	6884691	It does not get more awesome.
6884772	6886313	It doesn't matter who opened for Heart.
6886793	6888034	Cheap trick, but whatever.
6889315	6889936	Alright, anyhow.
6892077	6893078	Well, there's been a cat sighting.
6893478	6896300	Alright, we're going to get back into some longer news here.
6897321	6901645	Join us in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you are listening live on this Sunday evening.
6902525	6904827	I think we finally had cats seen during the show.
6905227	6910592	We had a very vocal... Oh, Alan says they could smell the lunch meat.
6911873	6912713	There goes that tail.
6915896	6916496	There they go.
6916656	6917377	They're on out of here.
6918121	6920023	The chatters are talking about the Rickroll.
6920323	6922505	Akuma JP says, oh, this is the end of OLR.
6922965	6926368	That was the moment we jumped the shark when we Rickrolled all the listeners there.
6927368	6927789	Let's see.
6929950	6938557	Stan in our chatroom says, Rob should do a karaoke version of the Rickroll song and use his re-recording as a sound bit for the show when he wants to fuck around with the audience.
6939938	6940098	No.
6941660	6944422	Actdeft in our chatroom says, forever alone.
6945463	6946023	See what he did there?
6946263	6947144	Forever alone.
6950181	6951261	Back to some news, Loki.
6951922	6960008	Alright, so the Skyrim creation kit came out this week with the Steam packs and stuff.
6960088	6966293	They have a high resolution texture pack and also there is a portal cameo.
6966373	6975139	Apparently you can download an add-on that creates the space core visiting your game.
6975259	6976080	It crashes into...
6976710	6979312	It really just goes to show, GLaDOS makes everything better.
6979753	6982715	And... Space!
6982775	6987659	And the space core can be used to craft a helmet that looks like one of the cores as well.
6988720	6989661	That is so awesome.
6991652	6998656	You really should have a thing on the PC where then once you do that quest you get like a costume in Portal 2 for the little dudes in co-op.
6999516	7011462	You know, there's also a rumor, thanks to someone that was digging around some of the console command set, there's a quest that's tied to all that too that they haven't unlocked yet.
7012763	7034291	that's awesome um some other cool stuff uh i want to see or i saw on there they had a mod that someone made that it was a giant horse and a bunch of people like you know whacking at it with you know swords and stuff like that and they named you know bethesda and valve and stuff like that and it was the arrow in the knee thing you know they're beating a dead horse haha
7036531	7037292	Wow, okay.
7038573	7039874	That's some intellectual humor there.
7040295	7053127	But one of the things, though, one of the most popular mods that's actually available on this creation kit service is something that removes that arrow in the needle line from the game so that you don't have to ever hear that again.
7053227	7053688	Brilliant.
7054833	7055774	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7079171	7082073	Alan's just like, no, this was legitimately Alan's reaction.
7082793	7085234	Oh, I knew I forgot to put the armor on.
7087115	7090097	I am playing possibly one of the sluttiest games of Skyrim ever.
7090217	7096500	Everyone is modded to be like, not naked, but just, and they're in, you know, Norway or whatever.
7096800	7099481	They all look very cold, but yeah, everyone's very sexy.
7101489	7109073	Some of the male armors that I have have the back piece missing, so their ass is hanging out, and I'm like, this is hot, and they're beating on the dragon with his ass hanging out.
7110373	7115476	Yeah, but there's a lot of stuff that you could do, but it required you to move files and stuff like that.
7115516	7118057	The creation kit kind of simplifies all that.
7118097	7121539	They have a launcher, and you basically, okay, I want this, this, this, this, go.
7122379	7124220	And that's all you do.
7125509	7147084	for anyone playing Skyrim on PC you absolutely have to get at least Sky UI it's a complete UI an inventory replacer and also I think it's called categorized favorites menu it completely changes the UI which I hated originally and it's like a different game super awesome unannounced Alan cameo thank you
7148573	7149734	No, don't apologize.
7150575	7153818	It's like the minute he heard Skyrim, he's like, I should come out and make a sandwich.
7154658	7157360	I should take a break from Skyrim to go talk about Skyrim, right?
7157381	7162505	Hey, I heard you like Skyrim, so here's some Skyrim while you're Skyrimming.
7164614	7193356	I really do want to I want to get it for my laptop here but I'm playing it on my PC or not my PS3 the 360 right now I love that they did the higher resolution textures I wish they had that like you know how Battlefield 3 I understand that for PC but I said you know how like Battlefield 3 had a thing where you can install high res textures to your hard drive I wish they had that for like the 360 that would be pretty awesome I understand why they don't but you know
7193772	7197394	TigerClaw in our chatroom says, I'm sure the furries are messing around with the Skyrim mods.
7197414	7200996	You'd be surprised the stuff you can find and it's not safe for work.
7202583	7204925	So basically someone has turned Skyrim into Second Life.
7205425	7206566	Am I understanding this correctly?
7208147	7211510	Actdeft says, I want Skyrim so I can mod it with my little pony stuff.
7213071	7214212	They have that already.
7214632	7222678	As much as I love having Skyrim on the PlayStation 3 so I can use my controller and all that, I have to admit I am somewhat starting to regret not getting it on PC.
7223438	7228202	The minute I saw that Macho Man dragon mod,
7229517	7232258	If you had a JTAG, you can do that.
7232618	7237439	Well, wasn't the PlayStation supposed to get some of the popular community mods at some point down the line?
7237619	7241400	Yeah, they had that whole Steam integration thing that they used for one game.
7241460	7242681	That was fucking awesome.
7242961	7251983	I think, though, I think now that modding is officially embraced and now that things can be officially signed off by Bethesda, maybe that's a possibility down the line.
7252523	7252843	I don't know.
7252963	7253223	Maybe.
7253484	7254144	Not gonna happen.
7255924	7256224	I don't know.
7256264	7256864	Never say never.
7257345	7258725	There'll be a fee, but never say never.
7260333	7281470	and well the other thing I was going to say is you know I don't know if you saw but like they had a whole I don't know what they called it it was a Bethesda kind of hey team members make whatever you want during a week and then show us what you have for Skyrim so they were able to make whatever mod they want and
7281633	7292500	And they came up with a whole bunch of cool shit that they could have thrown in there, but, oh, we couldn't give them another week to do what they want, you know, because that would be, you know, too awesome.
7293581	7294942	They have, like, spears.
7294982	7296723	They had a giant enemy crab.
7297424	7297504	Eh?
7297824	7297924	Eh?
7298024	7299045	Giant enemy crab.
7300145	7304408	All sorts of, you know, improvements, seasonal changes, stuff like that.
7304428	7306410	It's just amazing.
7306430	7306670	Really?
7306770	7310392	There's a silence to one in our chatroom says, Odaving is rainbow bright.
7310492	7311453	Best mod right there.
7315175	7317116	I guess you can change one of the characters into Rainbow Bright.
7320238	7323119	Why have naked people when you can have 80s cartoon nostalgia?
7324020	7325881	Why not have both?
7328339	7328879	You're sick.
7329139	7333081	Well, I'm not saying Rainbow Brite has to be naked, but you can have naked people and you can have Rainbow Brite.
7333181	7333521	I don't know.
7333561	7334501	I don't know how I feel about this.
7334681	7335381	This is awkward.
7335421	7336402	This is an awkward conversation.
7336422	7338762	I want to be able to have all these different dragons.
7338802	7340243	Like, I want to have a Macho Man dragon.
7340263	7342584	I want to have these, you know, My Little Pony dragon.
7342624	7345144	I want to have, I don't know what other dragons they have out there.
7345164	7349706	You know, maybe, you know, maybe a Family Guy Peter Griffin dragon or something like that or...
7350014	7352916	I want to have a mod that makes one of my companions Loki.
7354277	7355418	And he always just yells.
7356379	7357620	He always gets really irritated.
7357660	7359181	Like, why are you doing that?
7359822	7361263	And then it could shout and knock people away.
7365246	7365926	I'd be awesome.
7367207	7367487	All right.
7368127	7373068	I don't know why Loki didn't have this story because it's more relevant to his interest, but I'll read it and then Loki can react to it.
7373968	7381431	Eat, Sleep, Play, who is the developer behind Twisted Metal, which, you know, remember the series was like big back in the day and now it's all nostalgic again.
7381511	7383831	I don't even know what they're doing with this game, to be honest.
7383991	7386272	There's a new one coming out like what, this week?
7387012	7390796	I do want to get it, but we'll see.
7390816	7391337	Maybe I'll get it.
7391757	7396762	According to the Salt Lake City Tribune, David Jaffe is not with Eat Sleep Play anymore.
7396863	7397744	He left the company.
7398444	7400446	He's off to pursue casual games.
7402208	7404170	Yes, that worked so well last time.
7404230	7408275	He responded and called it highly exaggerated, but he didn't deny that he left.
7409215	7412077	So apparently there's been reductions and all this stuff.
7412797	7418460	David Jaffe did confirm that following the release of Twisted Metal, he is going to step away from Eat Sleep Play.
7418760	7419961	There have been layoffs.
7420761	7425303	This affects the offices in Utah, which is interesting because David Jaffe lives in California.
7425804	7432107	But he did mention that, that directing a game from a distance and all that did take its toll.
7432607	7436609	So that's not good when the game... I mean, well, I don't know.
7437049	7449428	it's easy to sit here and say oh that looks bad but then at the same time it's also very common in the industry when a game is done for there to be layoffs so but I guess this means they aren't starting work on a sequel right away
7450236	7451776	He said there's going to be no DLC.
7452356	7454077	Zero DLC for it.
7455077	7455697	Interesting.
7455857	7457137	I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
7457397	7459278	Part of me is like, good, it's all on the disc.
7459338	7464019	But then I'm like, oh wait, maybe it's bad because that means they're just putting it out there.
7464159	7473521	Aside from the pre-order bonus that you can get for pre-ordering the game, aside from that, there's going to be no DLC for Twisted Mill.
7473861	7474081	None.
7474341	7475102	Thank you for watching!
7490279	7492600	Alright, well, there's that.
7492881	7495682	So we'll see what this game has in store.
7495782	7499604	I don't know, I'm not hearing good things about it, which is kind of disappointing.
7499845	7501565	Loki, you're still going to get in on it?
7501686	7503106	Just because you love the old ones?
7503547	7504427	I don't know.
7505408	7505768	We'll see.
7505788	7508049	Alright, let's go to the email bag.
7508129	7512532	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is where we invite your emails each and every week.
7513840	7514260	DarkSakura.com
7535857	7545165	I would say iPod, but some jackass dumb shit who took an arrow to the knee of their knowledge stole that from me along with my 3DS, DS Lite, and FM transmitter.
7545665	7559237	The DS I had I marked with my girlfriend's initials, taped over with duct tape, and had an R4 flash card with all of my DS backups and old school ROMs, and my 3DS I had a lot of...
7561318	7565541	Um, I had a lot of 90s pop and DDR OSTs on the SD card.
7565861	7568622	Was super glued in and locked in with a flap of duct tape.
7569163	7571944	If he or she is listening, give me back my stuff, you bitch.
7572425	7576067	Sadly, it sounds like someone knew you had all that stuff in your case.
7576147	7577027	Peace out, DS Lover.
7577788	7580930	So, I want to know who we bumped off to become number one.
7582371	7584132	DS Lover didn't say which podcast.
7584152	7586093	I want to know who we bumped off to be number one.
7586934	7587595	Next email.
7587875	7588335	Alright, yes.
7589557	7590618	Stop it right now.
7591058	7592199	No, she's gone to join her career.
7592279	7592640	Stop it.
7593881	7594642	Read the next email.
7594882	7603070	Dear Dearlings, With the non-holiday holiday coming up on Tuesday, I was wondering if I could get some Valentine's Day video game recommendations out of you.
7603370	7605332	The game I'm looking for should be one of the following.
7605632	7606833	A. A romantic game.
7606933	7610317	A game with a realistic portrayal of romance that is pulled off in a convincing manner.
7610877	7614178	Not something where the characters are driven by wanting to engage in hot monkey sex.
7614659	7620621	Rather a game where the characters are motivated by wanting to engage in a truly enriching romantic relationship.
7621101	7622962	Or B, a game to play while drunk.
7623302	7625883	A game that is ideal to play while you are drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk.
7626403	7626824	and I have a game
7642711	7643352	Love Plus.
7643372	7646854	I was going to say Catherine.
7647435	7648816	I was going to say Catherine, actually.
7649456	7650217	Or Girl Gun.
7652338	7652979	Gal Gun.
7653299	7657242	If it's true love, you can play rock band together all night long.
7657422	7658063	Get Catherine.
7659023	7666509	If it's single love, then... If it's self love, then it's going to be the guy game.
7666649	7666849	First...
7669173	7672594	Oh my god, I haven't heard of that game in like six years.
7673854	7677195	Wasn't that game banned because there was a 17-year-old naked in it?
7677575	7678575	We don't know which one.
7678915	7681816	Metal Gear Solid, because remember, love can bloom on the battlefield.
7681836	7683056	And they can all be underage.
7683076	7683957	Love is a battlefield?
7684137	7687557	No, there's a line, Snake, can love bloom on the battlefield?
7689198	7691898	RDGSinge in our chatroom suggests, Leisure Shoot Larry 3.
7691958	7693519	That's a good suggestion.
7693539	7694359	Playboy the Mansion.
7695882	7697082	Get Catherine.
7697843	7700164	Was it self-love or was it duo-love?
7701324	7705205	A game with realistic portrayal of romance that is pulled off in a convincing manner.
7706006	7709187	Not where the characters are driven by wanting to engage in hot monkey sex.
7711767	7712888	I'm trying to think of any JRPGs.
7712988	7715049	I also got to say hot monkey sex a lot.
7718230	7719230	There's the Tokimeki games.
7722352	7724153	Donkey Kong Final Fantasy VIII?
7724233	7724753	I don't know.
7725213	7726254	What can I do for you?
7726474	7727735	No.
7728795	7731877	Just get Catherine.
7732517	7733277	What was that really?
7734458	7735319	Was it on the PSP?
7735379	7735899	Brooktown?
7736219	7739501	And if you want to play a game while you're drunk that's just going to piss you off.
7740001	7741602	You'll never be able to find that game.
7741942	7745344	No, if you want a game that's just going to piss you off while you're drunk, play Irritating Stick.
7747264	7748125	Move next email.
7750108	7764212	The ECA put out a call to action to discover state laws relating to EULA.
7764913	7769554	They used some of the verbiage from my previous inquiry to Maryland's Consumer Protection Office.
7770014	7775716	Blow is what appears to be another canned response, and only the first two sentences seem remotely related to my email.
7776696	7783860	What makes this cool is the letter I sent to OLR a couple of months, which Jamie read, was used as a basis for the official ECA letter.
7784280	7787641	ECA confirmed that they liked parts of the letter enough to include in their letter.
7788062	7794545	This is the first time I ever influenced something so countrywide, but also Canada, except, of course, OLR Mailbag, which is clearly worldwide.
7795745	7802228	The goal of this letter writing campaign is to establish what the current laws for each state are and then maybe we can start talking about changing it.
7802648	7809151	I suggest sending the ECA letter to your state legislatures as well as the Attorney General of your respective state.
7809531	7814153	This may boil down to actually having to hire a business lawyer to find out.
7818934	7819414	Good idea.
7819434	7824736	So his email was used in the... His letter was basically turned into the form letter for the ECA.
7824836	7825376	Go you.
7826677	7827557	You a celebrity.
7828777	7829378	A winner is you.
7829498	7830038	You like Whitney.
7830158	7832239	I mean... I couldn't help it.
7832959	7834239	Stop it right now.
7835560	7836260	Party foul.
7837400	7838501	Okay, we have two emails left.
7839441	7840541	Two more emails?
7840641	7841062	Shut up.
7841222	7841922	I'm the one reading them.
7843416	7844676	Well, they wanted the discount.
7867463	7867763	All right.
7867843	7868543	And last email.
7897216	7900278	I only have like two UMD games anyways because I sold the rest off.
7900318	7902359	I have like some of the Grand Theft Auto games.
7902379	7903419	We actually have a bunch.
7903680	7904460	Yeah, I have quite a few.
7904480	7906881	All my Q Entertainment games.
7906941	7907762	Every Xtend Extra.
7908202	7910864	But we also have a PSP, so it doesn't matter.
7912004	7912865	Greetings, OLR.
7913345	7914526	It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
7915046	7916467	I have a somewhat odd question.
7916647	7917867	Please don't take this the wrong way.
7917907	7920449	Your show is my absolute favorite among video game podcasts.
7920909	7921650	Answer my question.
7922030	7925252	Can you mention any other video game podcasts that you like or listen to?
7926473	7937093	The caveat, I want to know about other shows besides what's on the All Games Network I used to like Derek, but there's way too much cursing for my liking Why do I ask OLR this question?
7939728	7946091	I need to step it up!
7946691	7949032	What the fuck is your problem, dude?
7949652	7951773	Let me read the email!
7951953	7956235	Well, I'm a carpenter and choose to work by myself all day and need good stuff to listen to.
7956675	7961858	Which means that every Monday morning I start out my week with OLR, but by lunch I'm out of video game related material.
7962478	7964461	Any shows that you like, I'm sure to like.
7964902	7966624	Keep up the best podcasts on air.
7966684	7968446	You guys are a great way to start out each week.
7968867	7973954	Also, being on the right coast, I never knew what Pinkberry is, but after looking at their website, I am extremely jealous.
7974515	7975456	You guys are awesome.
7975476	7977639	Your loyal turtle in Philly, Serious Turtle.
7977799	7978780	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7993968	7994809	See, here's the thing.
7995489	7998571	I listen to a lot of stuff that's not video game related whatsoever.
7998691	8002073	And the stuff that is video game related is kind of all game shows.
8002353	8003033	Yeah.
8003113	8004674	You mentioned Derek's Dead Pixel Live.
8004694	8005735	I think that's what he was talking about.
8005775	8006435	Dead Pixel Live.
8006816	8008136	You know, that's a good... I like it.
8008256	8010137	I don't think there's that much... I like Fantastic Forum.
8012859	8030985	I really like Video Game Outsiders and they have a rhythm very similar to ours not so much lately I think they've been challenged because I think the hosts are starting to kind of go their own ways but when they're together it's a good time and John does his best to keep it together I listen to Horde House
8032105	8037949	Well, Horde House, no comment right now, but there's going to be some things changing, I think.
8039550	8040010	Let's see.
8040651	8042031	Other video game podcasts.
8042151	8043272	Of course, Bobby Blackwolf.
8043452	8044233	Of course.
8044333	8044993	That's just a given.
8045994	8046554	We like him.
8046895	8049656	But he hasn't updated his podcast feed in a while, naughty boy.
8050597	8053539	So even if I told you to listen to him, you couldn't get his newest shows.
8055440	8057402	Stuff that's off the All Games Network.
8057422	8061465	There's not a lot of video game podcasts that I've actually... See, here's the thing.
8062045	8064567	I've tried to listen to others, and I don't like them.
8064668	8065508	So I don't want to name them.
8065588	8072454	But there's one in particular I really try to listen to, and I just... And it's an independent show, so I really want to support other independent shows.
8072874	8073494	But we'll say it's...
8075076	8084105	It was a very slickly produced independent show, and the person behind it does a lot of podcasts on iTunes, but I just wasn't into it.
8084505	8094095	It's a video podcast, but I guess that wouldn't really work, but I like occasionally watching episodes of the Ben Heck Show.
8094725	8098447	Well, I'll throw on some of the video game YouTube ones.
8098988	8106212	When I was at work, I would check out the Angry Video Game Nerd on my phone just by plugging in on YouTube.
8107213	8109114	And I like Classic Game Room.
8109734	8110535	That was one of my favorites.
8110655	8112636	Let me give a shout out to a few that I'm subscribed to.
8113016	8116038	I actually whipped out my phone and I'm looking at some others that I'm subscribed to.
8116659	8123143	Of course, I subscribe to Under Sedation Live, which is sci-fi and stuff.
8123203	8125384	Travis, that's the show I started on.
8125604	8126845	Our own Ranma has a podcast.
8127265	8129146	of course, Anime Jam Session if you're into that.
8129667	8130447	PodCulture.
8130787	8135010	I got to give a shout out to my buddy Brad over at PodCulture if you like the sci-fi geeky stuff.
8135410	8136291	Let me put it this way.
8137011	8139973	The TARDIS shows up like in nine-tenths of the artwork.
8140053	8142715	So, you know, if you're a Doctor Who fan, you're going to love PodCulture.
8142735	8144396	A couple people are saying the BombCast.
8146268	8147569	I haven't tried that one myself.
8147689	8149849	I know a lot of folks are big fans of Giant Bomb, though.
8151190	8154811	I really love Smartest Man in the World by Greg Proops.
8155171	8155431	Yes.
8155531	8161893	But if you're not into swearing, I think it's still really funny, but just warning you.
8162073	8165915	Well, there's two that I listen to, and they're both from...
8167995	8171857	I'm going to have to look it up again, but one of them is Stuff Mom Never Told You.
8173317	8176798	That's really just interesting tidbits, things that you might not know.
8177378	8182040	And the other one is from How Stuff Works.
8183020	8187382	And one of them is Things You Never Learned in History Class.
8189110	8190691	and two others I want to name real quick here.
8191071	8193992	Of course, Girls Gone Wow, the lovely sill out of the UK.
8194392	8197413	Since there is, you know, Horde House is on a Horde hiatus right now.
8197993	8199754	Girls Gone Wow is a great place to get your fix.
8200514	8201895	Girl on Guy with Aisha Tyler.
8202555	8203835	But see, I love Aisha Tyler.
8203955	8209577	Like, you know, I'm totally gay, but Aisha Tyler, she's pretty hot and she's really intelligent and a total geek.
8210758	8211498	I've met her before.
8211898	8212438	Did you really?
8212458	8212759	Yeah.
8212939	8213479	What'd you think of her?
8213939	8214840	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8237540	8241201	Dude, Podcat.
8241282	8241942	That's a good idea.
8242942	8243242	Alright.
8244383	8244783	There you go.
8244823	8246344	I think we've given you plenty of suggestions.
8247544	8248945	We could probably name a million more.
8250285	8252366	The ones I named were off my personal iPod.
8252406	8253426	I do listen to all those shows.
8253446	8254527	There's one other that I listen to.
8254547	8257088	It's not a video game, but you know me and my history love.
8257688	8267716	There is History of the World Through 100 Objects that's put out by the BBC and the Museum of History in London.
8268797	8272480	Actually, if you like history, that one's a really freaking good one.
8273061	8276523	Even though the guy sounds a little too posh for my taste.
8277324	8278645	But other than that, it's a really good one.
8279706	8284130	You know me, I listen to all of the informational ones and the...
8287655	8291157	stuff that's going to teach you something that in video game ones.
8293698	8294459	But hopefully this helped.
8294499	8295339	And that was the last email.
8296840	8297180	All right.
8298681	8302103	Anyhow, let's move on past the mailbag.
8302383	8304064	This is the part of the show where we get angsty.
8305024	8309467	Sometimes we get a little bit angry here at Orange Lounge Radio and we do a segment called the FUs of the Week.
8309727	8310127	So here it is.
8326628	8331953	F you to the increased cost of tuition and people who only want you to have a bachelor's degree.
8333875	8342823	And F you to all the morons driving with their lights off in the rain and not signaling in the rain.
8344465	8344805	Stupid.
8345385	8347407	Not signaling in the rain.
8347808	8349009	Signaling in the rain.
8349309	8350190	Loki, you're F yous.
8350946	8351867	Um, so my F.U.
8351927	8359411	goes to Jack in the Box for pushing this milkshake that has no bacon in it.
8359711	8362333	I mean, seriously, I mean, come on.
8363193	8367215	You can't even put like a little, you can't sprinkle a little bit of bacon bits on top.
8367615	8369757	You know, because it is a bacon milkshake.
8370717	8371478	And, you know...
8372972	8373333	Whatever.
8374575	8375396	It is what it is.
8375596	8376738	I guess I'll have to make my own.
8378040	8381004	Baking ice cream wasn't bad, so baking milkshake could work.
8383328	8384129	So, I'll do that.
8386564	8388285	Actdeft in our chat goes, blame it on the rain.
8388325	8392127	I think that was in response to your FU, DarkSakura, who just head-desked.
8418212	8419202	Alright, you okay, DarkSakura?
8422652	8423412	My FU of the week.
8423472	8424553	Wait, where's the FU music?
8426393	8427073	My FU of the week.
8427233	8428073	FU to that noise.
8428573	8429914	After all these years, I still hate that.
8429994	8430994	It's so old!
8431274	8432714	No one saw the grudge.
8433215	8434675	You said dead.
8434735	8435515	A lot of people saw it.
8435755	8438996	I bet we're getting to the point now where people were born after that movie.
8439056	8441236	No one's going to know what you're talking about.
8441256	8442757	Why does she sound like a creaking door?
8442777	8443797	I don't get it.
8445077	8448538	Do not distract from my real FU of the week because this is serious business.
8449398	8452125	My FU of the week goes to Parking Lots
8453732	8455493	I hate them so much.
8455593	8459256	No, dude, dude, dude, dude.
8459496	8464400	I went to the mall, Arden Fair, 2 o'clock yesterday, Saturday.
8464960	8467182	That was the dumbest thing I could have ever done in my life.
8467642	8469884	That mall was more crowded than it is on Christmas.
8469924	8471165	Like, what is that, Black Friday?
8471185	8472686	It was more crowded than it was on Black Friday.
8472786	8476909	And just stupid people jumping in front of cars, driving slowly.
8476989	8481693	It got to the point we drove around the parking lot twice, couldn't find a place to park.
8482293	8485356	Went up to the second floor of the parking structure where nobody ever parks.
8485737	8489200	Every space up there was taken, and I said, fuck it, and went home.
8489500	8490401	Park across the street.
8491302	8492163	That's what I used to do.
8492183	8493084	Wait, you park at Hooters?
8493644	8496907	Oh, no, in that lot where nobody, there's like fucking nothing there now, huh?
8496987	8497128	Yep.
8497328	8500090	Where they used to have the nightclub closed.
8500130	8500631	Yeah, exactly.
8500651	8504695	You used to park across the street right there next to the sidewalk, hit the crosswalk.
8504995	8510139	By the time you cross the street and stuff, seriously, I used to go to Virgin over there.
8510199	8511220	It was awesome.
8511240	8512641	Oh, I remember Virgin Megastore.
8512762	8514083	Yeah, it's sad.
8514363	8515404	It's Urban Outfitters now.
8515684	8516104	It's all right.
8516204	8516885	Urban Outfitters.
8516945	8517786	I like some of their shirts.
8519147	8520068	They sell Michelle's book.
8520168	8523250	Do you know what I bought at that Virgin?
8523651	8523851	What?
8524251	8525012	My activator.
8525931	8526251	Nice.
8526272	8530697	For the Genesis with... Oh, what was that game?
8530737	8532418	I used to get import CDs at Virgin.
8533340	8534441	That's what I would go there for.
8535482	8536023	All right, anyhow.
8536543	8537464	And then the internet.
8537905	8538706	All right, let's move on.
8538766	8541028	More news and Skypline coming up very soon.
8541128	8542390	Twitter topics as well.
8542470	8544692	Tons of fun stuff coming up very, very, very, very soon.
8544853	8545093	Loki.
8545313	8549657	I was going to say, fuck you to your parking lot too, because I have to park in the middle of nowhere.
8549677	8552719	I have to hike back to my car if I remember where it is.
8553280	8556263	So Call of Duty Elite, it's pretty popular for...
8558050	8558631	Activision.
8558691	8562693	They have 7 million users using the Elite service.
8564375	8574141	1.5 million have actually paid the $60 for, or $50 I think it is, for all the free, well, the paid for the download content.
8574722	8578424	So $50 times 100, or 1.5 million times.
8578464	8580906	That's a lot of fucking money.
8580926	8581847	$75 million.
8583748	8586390	And people thought, who would want to sign up for this service?
8586994	8592236	Well, to be honest, if you're going to pay for the download content, you're actually saving money with that service.
8592576	8595218	And if you play a lot of Call of Duty, that might be worth it to you.
8596098	8597359	And the maps don't look bad.
8597699	8601821	I just don't play Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, so I don't use the service at all.
8601841	8606423	And I don't think it ties in with Modern Warfare, so the first one.
8610544	8611865	I don't know.
8612125	8613326	It looks like it's doing well for them.
8613346	8614066	They made lots of money.
8614506	8616427	Are they going to do another one of those expos this year?
8617299	8617539	They might.
8617559	8617860	I don't know.
8632751	8638735	I could see them doing that, because it worked out pretty well for them.
8639636	8642037	Of course, there's going to be another Call of Duty.
8642077	8644619	Yeah, they announced that they're going to make another Call of Duty game.
8644799	8649942	You don't even have to put that in the fucking... You do not have to announce that at all, that it was part of their...
8653038	8656041	Their financial report or something like that that they're making a new Call of Duty game.
8656122	8658284	Of course they're going to fucking make a new Call of Duty game.
8658524	8661287	It's news when they say we're not making a Call of Duty game.
8661427	8662929	Or we're not having a BlizzCon.
8663249	8666713	I mean, it's just, you know, you don't even need to report that.
8666753	8669857	People just make the assumption that there's going to be a new Call of Duty game coming out.
8670464	8681873	Speaking of that Activision Blizzard earnings call that happened this week, very surprising that they announced there's no release date still for Diablo 3, which we thought for sure we'd have that by the end of next month, but now it's looking like, nope, maybe summertime.
8681953	8683374	Q2 is what they're saying.
8683394	8685175	StarCraft... No, I'm in the beta.
8685195	8685656	It's great.
8690785	8692485	Well, then they just hate you.
8693366	8693706	Clearly.
8694186	8700088	StarCraft launched at the end of July, so that was kind of an odd time for it.
8700848	8704049	Yeah, no date.
8704909	8707570	Well, speaking of Diablo 3, my next story happens to be about Diablo 3.
8708270	8714972	Bashyak, who's the community manager over at Blizzard, was answering some questions, and it wasn't about Warcraft this time.
8714992	8715952	It was about Diablo 3.
8716832	8718773	They say Diablo 3 is still slated for 2012.
8720173	8737900	but now they're saying that Diablo 3 is only going to support up to four players even though there is five classes now that's four player co-op they haven't said anything about a five player mode in the game Bashok said that Blizzard is not looking into it and they're not going to expand their player cap no idea as to why they did that
8739280	8750362	Interesting because in World of Warcraft you have, if I'm not mistaken, you have 10 classes and raids are 10 people or 25 or, you know, but most, you know, the end game content is geared towards that.
8750482	8754843	Although you would find very, very, very few raid groups that have one of each class.
8755303	8755663	Very few.
8756583	8759984	Diablo 3 also will not have built-in voice chat at launch.
8760824	8763205	Blizzard wants to make sure that the voice chat is going to be worth it.
8764025	8765265	The WoW voice chat
8765885	8767707	Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3
8785365	8786867	I still thought the game looked good enough.
8788368	8793153	In fact, it looked great on the beta, so I don't think they necessarily need to make it that much better.
8793173	8799318	Again, part of the charm of Diablo is that you'll be able to be played on a variety of systems if you want to be able to find four people to co-op with.
8800019	8802341	I'm still really looking forward to Diablo 3 despite all this.
8802782	8804043	I just wish it would come out already.
8804623	8809228	I get a free copy because I signed the Blizzard Blood Pact for World of Warcraft because I have problems.
8811533	8812153	DarkSakura.com
8831224	8833025	But Hanna-Barbera put it out well.
8833366	8835287	Their first season's coming out on DVD.
8836167	8838749	It's a two-disc, 13-episode collection.
8839209	8841991	It has Inky, Blinky, Pinky, Clyde, and Sue.
8842972	8846534	And Mesmeron, who wants to take over Pac-Land.
8847775	8849636	And has Vampire Pacula.
8850917	8853759	And all kinds of, yeah.
8853819	8855340	I forgot about Pac-Land.
8855380	8857281	That was a really interesting game.
8857301	8859082	It was kind of like a side-scroller Pac-Man.
8859323	8859743	I have it.
8861363	8865945	It's in those Namco collections like the ones that tend to come out on every system.
8867545	8871126	I also remember the Christmas special where Santa came down and they had no idea what a human was.
8873287	8873607	Yeah.
8874307	8874507	Nice.
8875887	8880389	I had the Pac-Man board game growing up and it had like a million marbles.
8880669	8882809	It was all these fucking marbles that were little pellets.
8883409	8884130	I had the bed sheets.
8884950	8885250	Awesome.
8885726	8887309	Super Pac-Man Super Pac-Man
8902846	8905227	It's always great when you start off the story with a sigh.
8907288	8912649	It should not be a surprise that they're making another Skylanders game.
8914389	8916090	Didn't you say this game was going to tank?
8916890	8918210	Yeah, it should have tanked.
8919171	8922891	I underestimated how stupid the average consumer is.
8923292	8924232	My mistake.
8925112	8925773	And you know what?
8926253	8928455	If you bought this game, you have yourself to blame.
8928635	8930997	This is why you're going to get fucking expensive.
8931357	8938363	I do not want to hear another fucking thing about, oh, those map packs for Call of Duty are too expensive.
8939023	8941765	This is your fucking fault for buying Skylanders.
8942446	8943106	This is why.
8943406	8947049	No more can you complain about DLC costs or the quantity.
8948211	8950632	So yes, Skylanders, Giants.
8951332	8953493	Because hey, how can we make Skylanders better?
8953794	8954274	I don't know!
8954294	8957175	Let's make larger figures that we can charge more for.
8957896	8958916	Sounds like a plan.
8958936	8959776	Bigger is better.
8960197	8963478	People will buy them because they're consumer whores.
8963958	8964499	And how.
8965759	8993874	so yes Skylanders Giants will be coming out later this year I think also for the Wii U probably at some point and I gotta be honest by looking at the screenshots which this game itself kinda looks like it could have been on the Gamecube or the Playstation 2 I mean pretty cheap I've heard good things about the game itself just the game not all this extra crap but the game itself I've heard decent things about it it's a decent dungeon crawler
8994954	8995955	It looks pretty cheap.
8996235	8998877	You can't go off books though.
8998957	9003419	The only thing they're changing is they're adding these giant fucking characters that do stuff.
9003860	9005221	And they're going to cost more money.
9005461	9006241	But hey, guess what?
9006401	9008803	They're not going to force you to buy another goddamn portal.
9008883	9010284	You can still use your old portal.
9010504	9013145	So there's going to be twice as many SKUs I've got to fucking set up.
9014566	9033718	thank god for that uh and it's so we're gonna have these giant fucking portal characters that you have to use with your regular Skylanders characters and I'm sure they're gonna have more characters to go along with that and yeah so that's fantastic and I want to say they were the number one accessory item for games this month so
9034418	9040104	Congrats to you, Skylanders, for selling a lot.
9040604	9048172	And then, of course, there's going to be some Toys R Us exclusive items because they have signed a fucking blood pact with Activision to pimp these to children.
9050133	9057681	So, once again, I hope you're happy because you folks that purchased Skylanders are going to be the downfall of the gaming industry.
9058920	9060822	When an inevitable video game crash happens.
9060842	9064105	Which, by the way, there's big rumblings that we're headed towards another video game crash.
9064645	9065266	Because think about it.
9065306	9069370	If the Wii U and the Vita don't do very well, it could lead to another crash.
9070331	9075717	If the Wii U and the Vita don't do well, people are just going to have to buy games for the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.
9075917	9076818	Oh, the world will end.
9077679	9078199	I don't know.
9078239	9078540	It's just...
9079020	9083703	I don't think anything could ever happen to the extent that it happened with Atari.
9084183	9088466	But if you look at the sales, dude, sales this January were way down compared to a year ago.
9089537	9091038	There's nothing coming out in January.
9091218	9092058	I'm not surprised.
9093238	9098180	They had one week of sales because all the game releases for January came out the last week.
9098200	9100881	You still have holdovers and people using their gift cards and all that stuff?
9100901	9106083	Yeah, but see, normally January, like last year January, they had Darksiders, which came out like in the first week.
9106403	9107404	They had Bayonetta.
9108584	9110945	They had... Actually, Bayonetta might have been the year before.
9110965	9113706	Anyways, I think... I think Bayonetta was the year before.
9113966	9117307	Okay, well, one of these Januaries, they had Darksiders and Bayonetta.
9118868	9119048	And...
9120694	9121654	What else do they have?
9122254	9125516	You know, Alan was saying to me the other day, why haven't they announced a sequel to Bayonetta yet?
9126436	9127336	That's a very good question.
9127356	9128536	Because it tanked?
9129537	9129937	It did?
9129957	9131077	Oh, God, I love Bayonetta.
9131097	9131637	It doesn't do well.
9131657	9135759	Well, then, of course, there's that whole Metal Gear game that now is basically Metal Gear Bayonetta.
9136699	9137559	The Metal Gear game.
9137619	9138720	It'll come out eventually.
9139160	9140820	Well, they rebooted it.
9140920	9142861	They totally rebooted it.
9144555	9146037	So, yes, Skylander Giants.
9146637	9147538	Hip, hip, hooray.
9156133	9159174	Sorry, I got to interrupt real quick here.
9159775	9163576	So yeah, remember how I was saying that they're going to have some exclusive stuff?
9164056	9169079	Some of the characters they've run out of, you know, they have the legendary characters which sell for a lot more on eBay.
9169099	9170319	That's how you know how they're special.
9170919	9174601	And also they have now iridescent blue characters.
9174701	9177602	So they're like, we're not even going to paint this one.
9177622	9181424	We're just going to make it clear plastic and people will spend more money for it.
9185410	9195366	Alright, I got one more story for you guys, then we're going to get to the Skyplane and your Twitter topics, so just a reminder, here's your last chance to get those Twitter topics in at twitter.com slash OLR
9198038	9200679	This story is about another sigh.
9201360	9202100	Huge sigh.
9203321	9203941	Ubisoft.
9205282	9206142	I can't with this.
9206223	9207583	This is the whole DRM thing.
9208264	9217429	And they've gotten a lot of shit about this whole... I thought that Ubisoft got rid of this DRM when people started being up in arms about it.
9217449	9219110	But I guess that was just moving forward.
9219590	9224753	And what I'm talking about is the whole, you have to be online to play the game, and if you get kicked offline, you get kicked out of the game.
9225600	9226681	and DarkSakura.com.
9247293	9252055	and so forth was unable to be signed into.
9252416	9256838	However, Driver San Francisco was not one of the games that Ubisoft originally said you will not be able to play.
9257418	9261781	So extra games got taken down on top of what Ubisoft originally said.
9262501	9266103	Some games were still okay, like Just Dance 3 and Settlers Online.
9266704	9269705	Via Twitter, Ubisoft says, We apologize for the inconvenience.
9269765	9273567	It seems some of you can't connect to games announced as playable during migration.
9273948	9275849	We're on it and will keep you posted here.
9276389	9279751	In related news, those that pirated these games experience no issues.
9283755	9287756	I don't think Just Dance would be part of it because that's not a PC game.
9287796	9289757	I think it was after the fact too.
9289957	9291117	No one gets to wiggle their butt.
9291217	9292898	How about Assassin's Creed Revelations?
9292938	9293378	There you go.
9293938	9295099	I think it's only PC titles.
9295679	9296779	Yeah.
9299020	9302301	But am I correct in saying Ubisoft does not do this anymore, right?
9303381	9303801	They will.
9305202	9305722	They don't care.
9307102	9309583	You're still going to buy the next Assassin's Creed game, people.
9310243	9312044	You're not going to remember that they even did this.
9313058	9315199	I'm not, but then again, I hadn't bought any of the others.
9315419	9325563	Does anyone remember the snafu with the whole PlayStation Network where they forgot to calculate a date correctly or something like that and so it knocked everything offline for like a day?
9326824	9327684	No one remembers that.
9330105	9330665	That's true.
9331086	9331466	That's true.
9331526	9333226	I remember the big fuss people made about that.
9333287	9335708	I wonder how many people forgot about the PlayStation hack by now.
9336368	9339129	I'm sure a lot of people have already forgotten about the whole PlayStation Network thing.
9341980	9342301	Alright.
9343442	9345944	We are about ready to go to the Skype line.
9346045	9346845	So go ahead.
9346865	9352391	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9352452	9353853	We're going to go to the Skype line.
9354394	9355455	It's already lighting up.
9356216	9357757	People are ready to call in and get through.
9358318	9359940	So let's go to the phones right now.
9360020	9361161	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9361181	9361561	Who's this?
9362435	9363616	Hey, this is Asuka, what's up?
9386243	9388726	Yeah, it's a good buddy Stan to thank for that.
9388766	9391649	He introduced me to OLR and I'm loving it so far.
9391749	9392450	Well, thank you so much.
9392470	9393131	Thank you, Stan.
9393591	9398797	Now, for those that don't know who you are, is there a place where folks may or may not have been seeing you this week?
9399578	9405524	Yes, I actually appeared on the new season of The Tester on the PlayStation Network.
9406705	9433236	I can't believe it guys after all this okay I I don't know if you know about some of our running jokes if Stan filled you in about the tester but when I originally gave my review on the tester season one way back when I talked about the tester and I actually said the tester is not bad like it's it's it's not like a great freaking show it's not like you know you're gonna be watching The Walking Dead or something but right as far as reality TV goes as far as a lot of the old g4 shows go I
9433536	9434757	The tester is not bad.
9435017	9442024	But as I'm talking about this, Jamie's cat, because we were doing the show at her house, Shermie, took a big dump all over the floor.
9443845	9444666	She did.
9444866	9446408	Well, there's Shermie's review.
9447949	9459740	Well, actually, it's quite fitting because for those that might have seen the first episode, a quadra monster got into some deep shit, literally, because she started talking about farting and shitting and...
9460040	9462242	Yeah, what is up with this?
9462342	9466205	Okay, I gotta say, I made a tweet right after I watched the first episode.
9466966	9470949	Look, I love video games and I love trashy reality TV, so I'm not gonna lie.
9471089	9472470	I did watch the tester, alright?
9472510	9473331	Judge me all you want.
9473351	9474131	I don't give a fuck.
9474552	9477434	Okay, it's not as bad as being on the tester, trust me.
9478975	9479515	It's okay.
9482620	9483561	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9501800	9502461	DarkSakura.com
9518918	9519258	DarkSakura.com
9546226	9570898	which I did you should totally do it okay I'll do it for next year I applied on a little bit of a whim and I actually the reason I decided to go for the tester was way back when Sci-Fi did WCG Ultimate Gamer I said eh why not I'll try I made it to like the final 42 people and didn't make that show because apparently I wasn't like cool enough so screw them
9571698	9574461	and then the tester started the application process for season 3.
9574621	9575922	I said, eh, why not?
9576443	9581247	Next thing I know, I'm getting a phone call saying, yeah, we're flying you out to Los Angeles and you're going to be on the tester.
9581367	9582809	Like, oh, shit.
9583069	9584230	You just got picked?
9584390	9586813	Like, there wasn't a lot of screening and whittling down?
9587213	9592655	There's, it's, the whole process starts in about, started about mid-August, I want to say.
9593295	9595295	And I put up a profile really quickly.
9595335	9598796	I said, you know, I need to think of what's going to get me noticed.
9598976	9607739	I figured, okay, how many people are the combination of a chemist, plays roller derby, and has like a trophy level of 18?
9608359	9608999	Not many.
9609339	9610740	So I used that and then
9611480	9616728	Within a day of putting that up, I had a producer calling me saying, hey, I want to do some interviews with you, check you out.
9616768	9622036	And then the Skype interview had to wait a month of no contact from them.
9622858	9626223	And then all of a sudden, mid-October, I get a call from the executive producer.
9627537	9628278	Thank you for having me.
9645470	9649594	But I get the sense that the whole process of recording the show itself is really quick.
9649734	9658262	Like, you know, I know there's a lot of TV magic, but, you know, I could kind of tell that they're probably doing, like, multiple challenges in a day.
9658602	9660004	No, actually, no.
9660244	9660564	Really?
9660684	9660924	No?
9661745	9664788	Every episode is literally one day of filming.
9665228	9668131	And it's back to back to back to back about, like,
9668456	9671758	15-18 hours worth of filming crammed into one little half hour.
9671958	9682724	So you lose a lot of awesomeness, but they try to keep the drama and, in my case, a picture of a cockroach trying to go ass-to-mouth to me, which was great.
9684005	9690949	Because I know Loki and DarkSakura don't watch the tester, this week, the challenge... Did you watch it?
9691109	9692410	And I had a joke ready, too.
9693110	9693551	Basically...
9694551	9704956	I'm like saying, be glad that they're just, you know, they're doing the analogy where it's, you know, you have to keep your head in a case of bugs, you know, because you're squashing bugs or whatever.
9705196	9710638	Thank God you're not testing for Bethesda where you'd have to jump in a fucking swimming pool full of cockroaches.
9711258	9716841	Well, and the thing is, if you're testing for Bethesda, there would be no bugs because apparently they don't see them when they test them.
9717481	9718361	They just leave them in the game.
9718602	9723684	You know my honest to God reaction when I saw that on the show though, I said DarkSakura would have been first out.
9723964	9724124	See,
9725596	9727338	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9743556	9766741	Well, what's funny is, like, we have our, this one guy, JTitan, he's this big, rough and tough trash talk and, like, knows his shit, and then as soon as we find out it's the roaches, we go back into the loft as they're doing us, um, they're doing each person for the challenge one at a time, he starts freaking out back in the loft, like, screaming, I'm fucking doing this, I'm, no, I quit, I fucking quit, and
9767481	9791042	he was probably one of the next last people to go and all of us are coming back oh it's fine you'll be fine he's almost starting to like shake from nervousness he's that terrified of bugs so that would have been me I would have been crying I would have been screaming I would have been threatening calls to my lawyer but then I would have just done it you know I would have been like all right just fucking get in the zone don't think about it don't think about it don't think I'm fucking thinking about it don't think about it
9791598	9792078	DarkSakura.com
9812887	9813428	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9828602	9830123	I remember Joe's apartment.
9830263	9830863	Singing roaches.
9831643	9835825	I know there's probably tons you want to talk about, but of course I'm going to steer the conversation.
9837065	9837545	Take over.
9838026	9839986	I felt bad for the girl they sent home.
9840787	9843167	Oh, I shouldn't ruin it for those that haven't watched it.
9843187	9843488	My bad.
9844068	9846809	The person that they sent home seemed...
9847808	9848669	I don't agree with that.
9848949	9851831	I completely disagree with sending the person that they sent home.
9852511	9854612	That person seemed really nice to me.
9855593	9862577	I'm surprised that person's not listening to OLR because that seemed like the kind of person that I would be friends with for real.
9862957	9863918	So I kind of felt bad for them.
9864804	9869006	She was one of the coolest cats in the loft.
9869026	9874768	The first thing we noticed about her was she had this giant tail that she brought with.
9874788	9876489	We were like, okay, you're awesome.
9877209	9889755	Actually, when we were getting into the vans to head to the loft for filming, she originally had on this Voltron t-shirt that they took away from her because you couldn't have copyrighted material that wasn't first-party Sony because wah-wah-wah, whatever.
9890655	9892316	I'm just looking at her going, I like her.
9892936	9895960	So we spent a good hour just talking about Voltron.
9897301	9898963	I was so sad to see her go.
9899043	9902346	And considering it was either the person that...
9903359	9907302	either wasn't memorable or a person that talked about shit the whole time.
9908123	9911105	I would maybe send home the person that talked about shit, but that's just me.
9911125	9912506	That's reality TV.
9912606	9917530	I'm kind of looking at it going, you know, it sounds like you are the real deal.
9917570	9918171	You're legit.
9918211	9919311	You're intentions.
9919351	9920292	I mean, am I correct?
9920372	9922054	You really did want to work for Sony, right?
9922374	9923174	Oh my God.
9923355	9923935	Yeah.
9924015	9931321	In a later episode, you'll see just how much I would have killed or did I get my dream job?
9931361	9931641	It's like,
9932452	9936554	I can't really say which way it fell, but... Right, sure, no, I understand.
9936754	9938355	And listeners, please do respect that.
9938415	9941537	She's under contract, can't say if she wins or got told to sashay away.
9941557	9942937	Yeah, I'm gonna get sued.
9943698	9945159	All five people that watch the show.
9945719	9946559	Well, yeah, how...
9948260	9949681	I mean, I don't know.
9950181	9953404	It's kind of a joke that no one watches the tester, but yet here I am.
9954004	9955025	I admit I watch it.
9955165	9966913	And I gotta say, all joking aside, what they're doing there is interesting because it really is the only show right now that I can think of that's produced exclusively for a gaming console.
9966933	9968334	You don't have anything like it on Nintendo.
9968654	9970815	You don't have anything like it otherwise on Sony.
9971055	9976859	You certainly don't have anything like it on Xbox, especially since 1 vs. 100 isn't around anymore, which was a different kind of thing anyway.
9977340	9977640	Right.
9980341	9985422	Like I said, they originally did that WC Ultimate Gamer, but that kind of flopped after two seasons.
9985962	9988503	But even then, it wasn't entirely Xbox.
9988543	9992524	I think season two had some Wii crap in it that no one cared about.
9992584	10001906	But yeah, when I tell people that it's exclusively on PlayStation Network, you can download the episodes on your computer via thetester.com or crackle.com.
10003791	10010697	Just the fact that it's produced by Sony for Sony, promoting Sony, it's very unique in that sense.
10010837	10012338	Here's a question though, Rob.
10013419	10021946	Since you mentioned Crackle.com, Crackle, they have the actual utility or the app on the 360, so could you watch a tester on the 360?
10022126	10024428	You can actually watch the tester on the 360.
10025029	10025909	I've tried it and
10026770	10027390	It is possible.
10027770	10030312	So, yeah, I kind of got a personal kickle out of that.
10030852	10033373	Xenocor in our chatroom is, do you have to pay to see the tester?
10033453	10034653	No, it's a free show.
10034673	10035294	Completely free.
10036174	10036514	Trust me.
10036654	10037815	Would you want to pay to see the tester?
10039896	10040956	I love that you're deprecating.
10041516	10041836	I don't know.
10042537	10046679	Again, I know you can't tell me which way, but the way you talk about it sometimes makes me think it might not have won.
10049960	10051481	Just looking at the first episode, they're...
10052561	10066805	it's supposed to be a double elimination but it wasn't a little bit of a spoiler there but it was a single elimination and with who was clearly supposed to go home when he or she didn't that pissed me off like completely
10068766	10070067	Bullshit what happened there.
10070307	10085799	So I'm getting the sense that maybe you're still kind of friends with some of these folks, like maybe the person we were talking about earlier who got kicked off before their time, but maybe not with others.
10085839	10090783	She's actually going to a giant world cosplay competition, so good luck.
10091750	10091990	to her.
10092491	10094693	But yeah, we have this secret tester.
10094733	10106343	We call it the tester lounge on Facebook, as I call it, because Facebook is... But yeah, people from all three seasons, Brent Gokey's in it, Meredith, Adrian.
10107183	10109786	Side note, Meredith knows her shit about games.
10109966	10113349	It surprised all of us how much she knew about it, so that was awesome.
10113389	10115791	But yeah, we talk all the time.
10115871	10117612	And as a matter of fact, once...
10118693	10119794	The cast was announced.
10120114	10122535	Moe Chocolate from season two reached out to all of us.
10122575	10123836	He's like, whoa, what's up?
10123956	10124216	I'm Moe.
10124236	10124836	Nice to meet you.
10124876	10126617	Let's video chat on Skype.
10126717	10131520	And I'm just going, oh my God, you're Moe Chocolate and you're talking to me?
10131760	10132300	Holy crap.
10132360	10134321	And we've become the best of friends since then.
10134341	10136522	So it's pretty cool.
10136982	10138023	That is awesome.
10138043	10145767	Well, it sounds like at the end of the day, no matter what's happening on the show, good or bad, you had a good experience and you met a lot of great people out of it, sounds like.
10145867	10146127	Yeah.
10146900	10150322	Oh my god, it's something that I could never forget.
10150362	10156807	I mean, I never thought I would be doing something like that ever, because I'm not the most outgoing person.
10156847	10157347	I'm a gamer.
10157407	10158228	I'm a little bit shy.
10158248	10159549	A little bit of a closet dweller.
10159889	10164672	But it just blew my mind in terms of awesomeness.
10164732	10169435	And oh my god, I look on the TV that I've muted, and it's Whitney Houston.
10169935	10171036	I hate bringing her up.
10171116	10172697	God damn it, I need to change channels.
10172717	10172978	Changing!
10173838	10174378	Changing!
10175559	10190246	that's why people watch the tester to get away from CNN and the Whitney Houston that's it we need to hang out well I had to catch a predator on and then all of a sudden it became Whitney Houston I'm like I can't see the seg but let's turn on something
10190946	10191927	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10221340	10221680	I did.
10222300	10225922	I really did think that because you guys kind of strike me as having stuff in common.
10227042	10229763	Maybe I'll do it next year if I don't have a job.
10233164	10236526	I had a job or have had a job as a chemist.
10236606	10240667	So they even asked me, would you be okay with giving up your current job?
10240727	10245169	I said, hmm, work in a lab or work at Santa Monica.
10246730	10249411	Yes, I would be okay with that.
10249872	10253674	I'm a designer, so I was like, I can do all of your booklets.
10254755	10255795	It's a good way to get your foot in the door.
10255835	10264601	I understand the guy that won the very first season was only a tester for six months, and now he's in marketing or something.
10264621	10272325	Part of the reason the whole six months thing is what they don't tell you is it's for a six-month contract.
10274226	10274887	It's so like...
10276457	10276797	and DarkSakura.
10299234	10300495	and the same thing for this season.
10300515	10304276	It's like the Santa Monica thing, six month contract and then the car is for two year lease.
10304596	10306357	All right, let's see some enthusiasm.
10306377	10308037	The car is a two year lease?
10309058	10309298	What?
10310858	10311579	So funny.
10313839	10314099	Wow.
10314179	10316700	Now Stan in the chat says, I'm sure Rob thought I was making stuff up.
10316740	10318081	No, I didn't think you were making stuff up.
10318121	10321682	I just thought, you know, sometimes you might know somebody.
10321802	10323603	Like, oh, I went to high school with that person.
10323883	10325984	And after the six month period, we're going to have your memory erased.
10327804	10334410	Just look into this pen, let me put on my sunglasses Oh god, what else was I going to ask?
10335832	10349344	Something escapes me, I don't know, just one episode's aired and I'm sure there's plenty more you've really got to bite your tongue on Hopefully you'll decide to keep listening to OLR and we can get some more dirt on the tester We're probably the only podcast that talks about this show
10351515	10352516	There's a few out there.
10353316	10360981	I actually totally don't want to plug it, but kind of have to since Greg Miller was a guest judge this season.
10361802	10367045	He's actually having all of the cast members as they're booted off the show on the Beyond podcast.
10367125	10373429	So whenever I get kicked off or when I win, I'll be on there and I'll see if I can put in an OLR.
10374708	10399817	that's awesome you know what I have to say the final thing that kept me from applying really was that I don't want to live in LA except for being close to Disneyland well I figured it would be nice to actually like enjoy non sub zero temperatures like I am right now because I'm in Milwaukee not really the best weather capital of the world so I figured it'd be a nice change
10400157	10402160	You live relatively close to good friends of ours.
10402200	10404703	Yeah, you live right by the OLR Lesbians.
10406005	10407126	Located in Wisconsin.
10407467	10408088	In Madison.
10408308	10411012	In that case, they should come to my roller derby bouts.
10411853	10416920	I actually play for the Brew City Brewers in Milwaukee, so if you guys are listening, come to our fucking bouts!
10418081	10421925	I have a good, a really good friend of mine just recently got into that whole roller derby thing and she's loving it.
10422005	10428911	You know, actually, a friend of mine from one of my classes two semesters ago tried to get me into their league, the Sacramento League.
10429131	10430572	Yeah, I could see you out there taking some ass.
10430712	10432654	However, my bad ankle kind of keeps me from doing it.
10432674	10432994	Don't.
10433875	10435757	Oh, I have horrible ankles.
10435797	10441024	I actually tore my PCL on my left knee, so I have to wear this robo-brace of death, and I still do it.
10441644	10444287	It sounds like you might make quite the scene.
10444327	10446390	You could be the android of the skates.
10447792	10448252	Pretty much.
10449153	10469510	well unfortunately I gotta wrap things up we've had you on for like 20 minutes which is way longer than we have most callers but you're special cause you're you know you got the whole tie in to like something that's going on right now but please do I hope you're able to listen again and call us with updates so we can dish especially when the whole thing's over then we can really dish then we can really dish
10470440	10499506	I have so many fun stories Can't wait I will make it a point to catch the episode so that it's not just one person Now you have a reason to watch Now it's like someone from OLR is on It might have happened in the reverse order but now that she's listening to OLR she's kind of a member of the OLR I can take a few minutes out of my week 22 minutes, you can do it Just fast forward the last 5 minutes and you'll find out who's gone and who stays You're all good
10500111	10503253	Rob takes that 20 minutes out of his busy rating schedule.
10503373	10503793	No, I'm kidding.
10504054	10504314	I know.
10504354	10510118	It's like... But with all due respect, I watched Drag Race first, then The Tester.
10510358	10510818	Nice.
10510838	10511578	All right.
10512139	10513180	Good combo you got there.
10514320	10514540	All right.
10514821	10516822	Well, Asuka, thank you so much for calling in.
10517202	10518283	I hope to hell you win.
10519023	10522325	But, you know, I... Yeah, I hope to hell you win.
10522486	10523286	Let's just put it that way.
10524067	10524427	Thanks.
10524947	10526048	And yes, I will definitely be...
10527609	10529010	coming back next week and the week after.
10529110	10530331	Awesome.
10530411	10531152	You can't get rid of me now.
10531192	10531612	I'm sorry.
10531952	10532392	Awesome.
10533013	10534154	She's joined the oil army.
10534794	10536415	We've used the oil army duct tape.
10536515	10537156	Just don't tell Sherry.
10537176	10537616	Blame Stan.
10538157	10538457	All right.
10538877	10539117	All right.
10539337	10539858	Take care.
10539898	10540318	Have a good one.
10541139	10541539	Take care.
10541559	10542400	Bye, guys.
10542520	10542780	Bye.
10543220	10544321	You're mentioning Shermie now.
10544341	10548423	I'm going to have to go home and clean a big pile of crap up off the laundry room floor.
10548443	10550784	Because Shermie has her own bedroom, y'all.
10551145	10555727	I love that she's so self-deprecating about the whole thing.
10556968	10565853	And it sounds to me, I mean, I could be wrong, but it sounds to me based on the whole Facebook group they've got going on or Fakebook, as she called it, that it sounds like they're all kind of in on the joke.
10565933	10567654	Like, yeah, you know, it's the tester.
10568014	10569655	And that's pretty awesome.
10570796	10573037	They accept it for what it is.
10573658	10574558	So that's awesome.
10575979	10577100	But I'll tell you what, you know what?
10577180	10578941	Again, and I do stand by this.
10579021	10580282	I said this before and I'll say it now.
10580623	10583445	The Tester, it's not a TV show that's going to change your life.
10583585	10585026	It's not the best thing on television.
10585366	10585906	But you know what?
10585946	10592551	For something in the background, it is probably more entertaining than a lot of shows that have been about video gaming in the past.
10592731	10593672	So there you go.
10595052	10598574	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10598614	10601074	If you want to give us a call, you can go for that right now.
10601114	10602535	We've got time to take a couple more calls.
10602575	10606596	I know that call went on a long time, but we'll get at least one or two more other people on the show.
10607096	10611298	In the meantime, let's read some Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR.
10613039	10619503	13xforever sent us a tweet this week that says, Hey, OLR, how about five game music albums for whatever price you wish to pay?
10619943	10622865	How about 13 plus albums for $10 or more?
10623205	10626287	And he's referring to the gamemusicbundle.com.
10626327	10627708	It's another one of those indie bundles.
10627748	10629609	You know, that whole thing's been very popular lately.
10630209	10635233	and yeah, you can donate their money and get soundtracks.
10635433	10642918	So if you're a game music fan, it sounds like they have all different types of games included in that and they add more soundtracks as more people donate.
10643099	10643719	So interesting.
10644079	10645961	Let's go to the phones because we have more people calling in.
10646001	10647042	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10647062	10647402	Who's this?
10648086	10648787	Yo, what up, guys?
10648807	10649968	It's Xenacore from the OKC.
10649988	10650428	How you doing?
10650488	10654612	Hey, Xenacore from Oklahoma City, unless OKC stands for something else.
10655012	10655212	What's up?
10655232	10656474	Nah, you're pretty right on money.
10656974	10661018	Hey, by the way, just want to say, the Thunder losing to the Kings?
10661458	10662099	Dude.
10663080	10664861	Dude, the Thunder lost to the Kings.
10665362	10666202	Do you watch basketball?
10666703	10667624	Who the hell are the Thunder?
10667684	10668104	Never mind.
10668124	10670286	All right.
10670486	10670967	Never mind.
10670987	10672428	Nah, I don't pay attention to that fucking team.
10672448	10673028	They ain't paying me.
10673069	10673349	Fuck it.
10674520	10678322	Let me just say the Thunder right now is the best team in the league and they fucking lost to the Kings.
10678582	10679162	The Sacramento Kings.
10679182	10680042	That's pretty funny.
10680062	10683524	And everybody here in Sacramento is just laughing because we're like, the Kings suck.
10683564	10684144	And you guys, oh God.
10684164	10684864	All right, anyway.
10685764	10686825	I won't make this about basketball.
10687085	10687985	What's on your mind, ZetaCore?
10688566	10689366	Not much, not much.
10689446	10691967	Just been playing the hell out of League of Legends for some reason.
10692577	10693797	You know, it's funny you bring that up.
10694378	10699059	Twitter asked us a question here about League of Legends, so I can kind of tie this together.
10699700	10703661	Ossifer sent us a tweet, said, Have you guys ever played League of Legends?
10703741	10711724	It's an extremely popular free online game that I've never heard you mention on the show, which is funny because we did end up mentioning it at the top of the show during the Dota thing.
10712124	10713044	But he's right.
10713384	10717626	I personally have not played League of Legends myself, but Xenocore sounds like you're a fan.
10718684	10719865	Yeah, I've been playing it for a while now.
10719885	10724769	I finally got my account maxed out so I can actually compete with some of the other characters in the game.
10726591	10737140	The whole thing with the multiplayer online battle arenas, at least that's the genre it's been labeled as, the MOBAs, is since it's all team based, there's a lot of rage in there.
10737260	10739462	More so than you might see in a first person shooter, so.
10740598	10743499	I can only play it for about an hour and then the little 12-year-olds get on my nerves.
10743619	10745779	But other than that, the game itself is pretty fun.
10745859	10746480	I can only imagine.
10746500	10750881	Like, League of Legends is one of those games I think I would enjoy more if I just played it with, like, only people I know.
10751381	10758803	But one thing I do notice is that it's a hugely popular game to be streamed on those video game streaming websites like Twitch TV.
10759123	10761144	I always see League of Legends stuff going on on there.
10761684	10766245	Yeah, I actually started playing Heroes of Newer just because it looks more polished.
10767066	10769447	because they acted at higher resolutions and all this other stuff.
10769467	10770448	Your interface was better.
10770788	10775650	But I couldn't find any pro content or even games being played so I could learn how to play it.
10776150	10787196	But there was tons of League of Legends stuff, so I started watching that here and there, like pro coverage and just some guys casting their games because that's how I got into StarCraft is when everybody was casting it during the beta.
10787896	10791438	And I started playing it out, and once I figured out how it worked, it was pretty fun.
10791598	10793479	It's the only really competitive game that I play.
10793779	10796160	I'm pretty much done with first-person shooters as far as I'm concerned.
10796647	10799670	Let me back up a minute, because this is the question I should have asked you first.
10799710	10806576	For those that aren't familiar with League of Legends, as Ossifer kind of insinuates we are on the Twitter, what makes this game addicting?
10806696	10809919	What makes you stick it out through the 12-year-olds as long as you can for this?
10810519	10813962	Okay, so you're familiar with the interface that StarCraft and them use, right?
10813982	10817625	So you got your mouse control, you're right-clicking on things and moving them around.
10817825	10819687	This one, you're locked into one single character.
10820368	10821789	So you play one character, there's about
10822423	10826144	I think just under 100, if not just a little over 100 characters to choose from.
10826424	10827965	They all have different abilities.
10828785	10832807	Think of your standard role-playing game party.
10833127	10835908	They have characters that fit each role that's in the game.
10836188	10839229	Your healer, your magic user, your archer, sure.
10839349	10841450	Yeah, here's one that does straight attack damage.
10841470	10844491	You have your attack power, which are your magical abilities.
10844791	10845571	You have your tanks.
10846011	10862727	and you have your junglers, the guys who don't sit in the main action of the game running around and assisting everybody else to sum it up real quick and you just keep, it's tower defense so you have three lines of towers and a large crystal that you defend if you kill the other guy's crystal you win or they can surrender and give up
10863448	10863648	Okay.
10863668	10865470	So it sounds like the concept is pretty easy.
10865550	10871137	It's not hard to learn, but it takes patience to learn how to play each character because they're all a little bit different.
10871838	10879587	I think Riot puts out a teaser video on each one of the characters they release that tell you all about how to use their powers and this, that, and the other thing.
10879607	10882931	So if you want to learn one, there's plenty of resources to do so.
10884267	10902518	Um, you know, I got to admit part of what is scary to me in sorts about League of Legends is that I am afraid of signing on there and that just getting owned by 12 year olds right off the bat because there's no way to practice like is there any type of like practice learning curve like kind of way to ease yourself into this game before you have to play against the hardcore people?
10903123	10907184	Yeah, well, you can't really play with the hardcore guys because they're mainly doing rank matches.
10907264	10910085	Rank matches you can't even touch until you max out your account.
10910885	10914006	It keeps track of your player skill and how long you've been playing up to level 30.
10914686	10918887	So it'll take you about a good four or five months before you can even touch the rank stuff.
10918907	10919767	So you don't have to worry about it.
10920167	10921328	And the matching is pretty good.
10921368	10925829	So it balances the team based off of the level base and how many wins they have.
10926969	10927729	Thanks for watching!
10942219	10945642	The quality of your games will go up as far as who you're matched with.
10946262	10953087	And once you reach level 30, you can pretty much play any role because you've been playing the game enough in order to do so.
10953288	10953848	And it's free.
10954068	10955910	You don't have to put any money into it whatsoever.
10956150	10956770	I like free.
10957090	10957651	I do like free.
10957931	10958512	Let me ask this.
10959212	10965117	What do you think about the whole Dota stuff that we were talking about earlier in the show with Blizzard and Valve going at each other over Dota?
10965157	10967619	I mean, it seems like you're kind of getting into these games now.
10968039	10971001	Do you have a preference on what you want to see happen with the
10972302	10997035	well to sum them all up dota and dota 2 and what blizzard i think is trying to do in heroes of new earth follow the original model the original model is not newbie friendly there's a lot of that game is very complex i mean you take just five on five guys in the starcraft environment fighting each other and you add the crafting system and how you build bigger items you worry about
10997635	11007022	The concepts of feeding other players, just running and killing so they get gold because they're killing you off left and right, which unbalances the whole game, and then everybody's screaming noob at you, this, that, and the other thing.
11007182	11011144	There's a lot of crap to remember for all those, but some people like that complexity.
11011505	11018790	League of Legends is a lot simpler, it's easier to get into, and the matches potentially don't last as long because there's a level cap during the game.
11019030	11024894	Your character can only get up to level 18, I think, and all the others can go up to 25, 30 before they start capping out.
11025474	11027635	So the game is forced to a conclusion.
11027755	11031037	Usually one game will not go any longer than an hour, even as a newbie.
11032218	11032618	All right.
11033018	11040382	So it sounds like there's a lot of, even though we kind of say these games all have the same roots, there's still a lot of mechanical differences between them.
11041742	11044224	Yeah, at the core they're the same, but one is very newbie friendly.
11044264	11046265	The other one, just let the pros deal with it.
11046305	11046785	Don't even bother.
11047805	11050607	All right, Xenocore, anything else you want to share with listeners before we take another call?
11051260	11058530	Yeah, actually, now if you get a to-go order from the Olive Garden, they give you a whole freaking roll of drumsticks, or breadsticks, man.
11058550	11059051	It's awesome.
11061654	11063296	I got five in the fridge, I'm going to eat for breakfast.
11064697	11070602	I heard a random story that the Olive Garden is having image problems right now.
11070662	11074385	I can't imagine why, but they're actually going to change their restaurants.
11074405	11078848	They're going through a JCPenney crisis right now where they're going to totally rebrand the Olive Garden.
11078888	11080589	Yeah, it's weird because no one's really going there anymore.
11080729	11082631	Yeah, well, the Olive Garden's kind of become a joke now.
11083491	11085053	Because it's freaking corporate, man.
11085093	11090657	You can go in and see some old Italian dude cooking in the back speaking Italian and have these joints around here.
11090677	11091818	So I'd rather go there.
11092298	11093279	Exactly, exactly.
11093618	11097503	Alright, well, Xenocore, enjoy those breadsticks, but I gotta let you go so we can take a few more calls.
11097563	11098745	And good luck with your League of Legends.
11098785	11099326	I'm outta here.
11099446	11100127	Thanks for having me on.
11100327	11100888	Hey, no problem.
11101248	11101669	Take care, buddy.
11103348	11107611	Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
11107971	11111033	Let me get a few more Twitter topics out of the way before the next call comes in.
11111974	11117758	Let's see, we have... DarkTesuya tweets us and says, Bad news for Loki.
11118598	11121440	Guess who's working on haptic technology?
11121780	11122181	Apple.
11123321	11124922	What is haptic technology?
11125203	11126784	Oh, it's a Ready Player One reference.
11126804	11129425	It's touching stuff with a glove.
11129626	11133048	He tweets us a story about, I guess Apple's working on this right now?
11133868	11150920	Very good for them Apple is playing around in this space now adding teeth to speculation it may soon launch high-end TV sets with glasses-less 3D God, all you ever hear about are these Apple TV sets that are all the rumor right now I don't know
11152031	11154174	Would an Apple TV interest you in the least, Loki?
11154434	11154574	No.
11155575	11161923	I'm not one... Okay, listen, I'm not your normal Apple consumer that like, Oh, Apple released something!
11161943	11163425	I'm gonna go out to the store right now and go buy it!
11163445	11163766	Go buy it!
11163786	11164066	Go buy it!
11164086	11164447	Go buy it!
11165669	11169070	I mean, like, that is your usual consumer.
11169090	11171111	I, on the other hand, have a TV.
11171191	11174512	I have two TVs, one of which I use, one of which I don't use.
11174852	11176192	I do not need a third TV.
11176252	11178593	All right, I got to wrap it up and go to the phones because we have another call.
11178633	11179733	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11179753	11180113	Who's this?
11180773	11182214	It's the one and only Ranma.
11182374	11182934	Hey, Ranma.
11182954	11185815	Sorry you had to sit there on the line and listen to more of Loki's ranting.
11185975	11186455	Bad timing.
11187105	11193748	You have to understand, I enjoy Loki's ranting about Apple since my new roommate is an Apple fanboy, so you know.
11195189	11196029	Well, what's up, buddy?
11196870	11200331	Not too much, but Rob, I have a bone to pick with you again.
11200752	11201952	You have a boner to pick with me?
11202012	11202492	That's hot.
11203293	11205934	Okay, first we have balls, now we have boners, okay?
11205954	11207875	Alright, what's up?
11208035	11208655	What's up, Rama?
11209556	11210316	Rob, you're a dick.
11210836	11211037	Why?
11211077	11211677	What do I do now?
11213483	11214784	Talk about balls.
11215084	11217145	You are a dick talking about balls, man.
11217165	11217885	You got some nerve.
11218786	11221547	That's what I do here on the show is help it land in the toilet.
11222388	11227530	Yes, but we should leave the talking of balls to David Bowie since he fondles them on a regular basis.
11230992	11231452	Stop.
11233293	11234434	Is that all you really want?
11235094	11236975	Come on my show and make balls jokes?
11237975	11239476	No, I also wanted to compliment your hair.
11239596	11240617	So you look like Riker.
11243024	11244005	We don't have a webcam.
11244025	11245526	You don't know what my hair looks like right now.
11245566	11246227	I've been napping.
11246747	11249069	I should ask this question.
11249429	11249869	What hair?
11250970	11251190	What?
11251971	11254613	Since the studio's at your house, can we get the OLR cam back?
11255514	11256214	I've thought about it.
11256515	11259337	I've seriously thought about it, but it's kind of a pain in the butt to hook up.
11259837	11264281	And we're probably going to be moving in June anyway, so probably after that.
11264861	11267243	Because we'll have a more proper studio set up at that point.
11269434	11270976	The studio's like a nomad, isn't it?
11271256	11275039	Maybe for your 10-year present, OLR listeners, because our birthday's in June, too.
11275440	11276641	It plays Genesis games?
11279304	11280945	I have a thing that plays Genesis games.
11281446	11282186	It's called a Genesis.
11283788	11287491	And a nomad.
11288553	11289714	What am I going to do with you, Ranma?
11289774	11292016	All right, anything else you want to filthy up the show with tonight?
11292699	11295901	No, um, how bad the Vita's gonna fall flat on its face.
11296401	11297942	Oh, now you're throwing some shade.
11297982	11298562	This is good.
11298622	11300123	These are the types of calls I like.
11300543	11302964	Why is the Vita gonna fall flat on its face, Ranma?
11303704	11309687	I can't, as much as I want the system, I can't see myself shelling out $250 for this thing.
11310488	11310988	I just can't.
11311949	11316091	I mean, Nintendo learned their lesson, like, pretty quickly with the price drop.
11316731	11320833	Sony will just stand there and just say that if
11321672	11322072	It's okay.
11322172	11323314	It's okay.
11323334	11324515	There's nothing wrong with the price.
11325116	11327499	It'll stay at that price for me for a year before it falls.
11328140	11328501	If that.
11328781	11332866	Alright, let's look at the technology with the DS and the 3DS.
11333347	11335870	I mean, if you put those side to side and you know...
11337252	11337972	Thanks for watching!
11362825	11363445	Thanks for watching!
11386457	11387077	Thanks for watching!
11407691	11431677	I think it has a good chance because their launch lineup is fucking awesome I mean they've got a lot of games coming out and it's not like hey look here's our launch lineup and then we have one 3DS game coming out each month I mean we're talking like a lot of games and it's gonna be Vita Vita Vita all over the place I will say PlayStation does seem to have really good third party support out the gate as opposed to third party support eventually
11432177	11435978	And it's also pretty powerful technology-wise.
11435998	11437219	I mean, the screen looks nice.
11437319	11455465	It's got dual analog sticks, which is going to be great for porting games over or creating first-person shooter games and that kind of stuff because you actually have some decent controls there, except unlike the 3DS where you're going to force people to use the analog stick and then the touchscreen.
11455545	11459026	And, oh, it's very fucking uncomfortable, so let's throw in the stand.
11459366	11459786	Thanks for watching!
11478388	11480189	Alright, Ranma, he's made his case.
11480650	11481150	We'll see.
11481370	11486634	We'll see a lot of questions to be answered over the next month and see what the numbers look like when the system comes out.
11487214	11489956	Alright, Ranma, anything else quickly before we let you go?
11491017	11494059	I'm kind of floored because I actually agree with Loki on that.
11494079	11498041	I mean, I do and I understand where he's coming from.
11498141	11500663	I mean, the Vita is a much more powerful system.
11500983	11502945	It's there.
11503445	11504746	But the way I see it is that
11505762	11512968	The consumer's going to look at it like, oh, I can do all this, look at the price, put it down, and they can go pick up a 3DS or something like that.
11512988	11515190	I think that's what it's coming down to right about now.
11515310	11516591	It's all about the price point.
11516831	11524998	Yeah, but people are comfortable in paying those kinds of price points because people are buying tablets and they're buying all this other electronic garbage that's really expensive.
11525319	11526880	The price point's not that big a deal anymore.
11527901	11528882	Well, I don't know about that.
11528942	11533906	Most people that are buying tablets are iPad users because they're buying because it's an iPad, you know?
11535459	11536021	and many more.
11546465	11546945	and DarkSakura.
11567133	11568614	All right, I have to put an end to this.
11568634	11569494	We've got to wrap up the show.
11569514	11570274	We're running out of time.
11570574	11571875	Ranma, thank you very much for your call.
11572075	11572355	Good luck.
11572395	11572935	No problem.
11573095	11573455	Take care.
11573916	11574156	Later.
11574596	11575176	Run, John.
11575416	11575676	All right.
11576156	11576797	Oh, he didn't hear that.
11576837	11577697	He'll hear it on the air.
11578117	11579638	All right, we've got to close up the Skype line, guys.
11579658	11583579	So really, you've got to buy a system that's less expensive than the other system.
11583739	11584300	That's how it is.
11585400	11587421	I mean, that's the argument he's making.
11587601	11590502	Well, you know, the iPad's $500, so spending $250 on this tablet's not that big a deal.
11593959	11594459	Wait, what?
11594620	11595781	Doesn't make any sense.
11596441	11596781	All right.
11597602	11598523	We got to wrap up the show.
11598723	11600264	We ran long tonight, but that's okay.
11600525	11603647	It was worth it for the phone call with Asuka earlier on.
11603687	11604848	It was fun.
11605329	11606830	Who I've been chatting with.
11607090	11608011	I knew you would.
11608031	11610313	I knew you'd be braiding each other's hair within minutes.
11610333	11611254	This is a matter of time.
11611294	11611534	All right.
11612014	11612895	Hitting each other with pillows.
11612955	11613195	All right.
11615357	11616918	Anyway, we got to wrap it up.
11616998	11620581	We got to wrap up the show and be on out of here for the night.
11620641	11623002	So let's go around and get everybody's... Oh, I didn't do all the tweets.
11623082	11623703	Damn it, damn it, damn it.
11623723	11623983	Quickly.
11624343	11625684	Because there were some I really wanted to read.
11626885	11630467	Actdeft says, Beat Hazard Ultra is now on iOS.
11630607	11637932	If you know the Beat Hazard games, which are actually a lot of... I do love Beat Hazard on the PC via Steam.
11638012	11640814	So I'm going to definitely check this out now that I know it's on iOS.
11641275	11644176	I don't see a price here in the story, but I wanted to say I read somewhere it was like $2.99.
11645277	11649102	and it will work with all the stuff that's on your iOS device.
11649142	11649702	That's pretty cool.
11650123	11652145	A couple quick ones from Tiger Claw.
11652566	11655509	I think the Sonic and Sega All-Stars you mentioned during Quickfire News.
11655549	11657011	Let me read this other one from Tiger Claw.
11657031	11657751	305 on Twitter.
11660074	11663195	Twisted Metal promotion blows up Sweet Tooth's truck.
11663995	11668716	Let's see, I guess this is a promotion for Twisted Metal where you get to destroy things.
11668736	11680818	Fans can sign up for a chance to remotely fire M249 saw machine guns at the real-life version of the ice cream truck driven by Sweet Tooth, the game's fire-haired, clown-faced antagonist.
11682198	11686379	They've hooked guns up to a satellite so you can control them remotely from your computer.
11686519	11686779	What? !
11687759	11691523	You can shoot a real gun with real bullets at a real truck from your computer.
11691843	11695466	Go to shootmytruck.com for a chance to pull the trigger.
11696928	11700471	Or it's just a video of that and not actually a real trick.
11700771	11701712	It's a dirty trick.
11704110	11705811	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight
11730880	11735442	My final thought tonight is the only downside to shows running long is no Pinkberry Break.
11735963	11736543	I know!
11737584	11738064	Oh well.
11738524	11739205	We'll get it during the week.
11740285	11741766	Salted Caramel, you will be mine.
11742697	11744839	That's gonna do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
11744859	11746520	Hey, if you like what you heard, you know what we say.
11746620	11748542	Please just tell a couple other people about the show.
11748882	11750784	Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.
11750804	11751785	We really appreciate it.
11752185	11758731	And, you know, we don't have a million dollar magazine backing us up or a website or our own show on the PlayStation Network or anything like that.
11759071	11763375	So all we ask is tell a friend or two about the show and help grow the OL Army.
11763675	11765677	like Stan did.
11765837	11770620	Stan told his buddy who happened to be on this little show that's going on right now to listen to the show and it worked.
11770640	11772001	So Stan gets a gold star this week.
11772381	11775143	But you guys definitely everybody else can earn gold stars.
11775164	11777886	Just tell a friend or two about Orange Lounge Radio.
11777926	11778666	Really appreciate it.
11778946	11779947	Have a great week everybody.
11779987	11783149	We'll see you back here next week for more gaming news and discussion.
11783390	11785451	Maybe some more Vita impressions.
11785491	11792016	I don't know if anyone's getting the early one but have a great Valentine's Day as well whether you're spending it with somebody special or whether you're spending it
11792416	11793197	Forever alone.
11794018	11795399	Or whether you're spending it with your hand.
11796500	11797521	Have a great week, everybody.
11798302	11798903	See you next time.
11816039	11818543	or allgames.com but we're probably right anyway see you next week
