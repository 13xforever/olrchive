00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,600
Tonight, February 19th, 2012, Capcom makes the same mistake twice.

2
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,480
Sony plans a movie for one of its franchises, and one company is rumored to be working on

3
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,680
a new Ninja Turtles game.

4
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,240
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

5
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,660
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:47,440
We are live on this February 19th, 2012, with episode number 446 of our show.

7
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,440
We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after

8
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,440
the Bobby Black Wolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

9
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,200
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts here

10
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,260
with me as always.

11
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,000
Say hello first off to the one, the only, dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hi.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
How are you Jamie?

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Caffeinated.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Well caffeinated.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Awake?

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Awake.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well I started falling asleep on the way over here.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Buzzing?

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I was bored before I got here.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That's not good.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Falling asleep while you drive, that's not good.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,760
No, but then I was like, Starbucks, I can go there, wow, so yeah.

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,640
Alright, also joining us tonight, I don't know if he's caffeinated, but say hello to

25
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,960
Techmaster Loki.

26
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,080
I think I'm caffeinated, this has caffeine in it.

27
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,640
You do have a jumbo little soda, what soda is that?

28
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,600
It's more ice than soda, it's the McDonald's ripoff there.

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,400
There you go.

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,440
So anyway, join us live, if you are listening live here at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock

31
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,320
Eastern at all games, join our chat room.

32
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,480
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com is where you can interact with us, because of course it is

33
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,320
the show where every gamer has a voice, we do like to read your voices throughout the

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,640
show and we'll take your calls later, read your emails and all that good stuff.

35
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,800
Looking in our chat, we see some people are celebrating being able to be here live tonight

36
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,600
because they have tomorrow off, and I totally forgot that it's a three day weekend.

37
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,640
So happy President's Day I suppose, but I don't have tomorrow off.

38
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,640
Me neither.

39
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,640
Isn't that weird?

40
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,040
I have tomorrow off.

41
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,880
Always ruining my party.

42
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,880
Because I'm fun-employed.

43
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,600
You have every day off.

44
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,680
But yeah, what's up with that?

45
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,920
We don't get President's Day off.

46
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,600
I did at my old company too.

47
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,200
Well I think the deal is, unless you're a bank or a school or something, your company

48
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,440
either does Martin Luther King Day in January, which mine does.

49
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,440
I don't get that either.

50
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,440
Really?

51
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,440
You got screwed.

52
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,080
I don't know what to tell you.

53
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,520
One place I was with, we used to get floaters for the major bank holidays.

54
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,080
Yeah, we have what's called a floating holiday too in place of Veterans Day.

55
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,560
We don't get Veterans Day off, but we can take a floating holiday any time during the

56
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,360
year, which I usually use to cover my E3 trip the years I've gone.

57
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,240
I don't know if that'll happen this year, but you know what?

58
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,240
I don't know if E3 will happen this year.

59
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,040
It really depends on a number of factors.

60
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:16,240
Well, A, I'm probably not going to get in, but B, even like last year, I would go just

61
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,640
to see Bobby and anybody else I know that's going to the event to do a Disney thing, if

62
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
they're going.

63
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
We need to do D3.

64
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
Yeah, yeah.

65
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,640
Seriously.

66
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,640
I'm at the Disney convention.

67
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,600
But I am seriously, seriously... I haven't done this convention in four years, but this

68
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,640
year I really, really, really... Of course, so much of this depends on finances.

69
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,800
I want to do PACS this year, so I'm definitely looking into doing that.

70
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
PACS West, of course.

71
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,640
I went to... The last PACS I went to was the first PACS East a couple years ago.

72
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,800
I would love to go if someone would finance me.

73
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,720
She's... Well, we don't have OLR funds anymore.

74
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,340
We could do the Kickstarter thing.

75
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,340
It works for Double Fine.

76
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,760
Kickstarter so I can go to PACS.

77
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,480
Donate $20 and Dark Sakura will sign your butt.

78
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,480
There you go.

79
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,480
At PACS.

80
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,480
At PACS.

81
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,480
All right.

82
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,480
We'll figure something out.

83
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:11,240
Anyhow, let's talk games, video games, and this week, of course, the big, big story in

84
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,240
gaming.

85
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
PlayStation Vita.

86
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,240
No incur.

87
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Come on.

88
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,120
Kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding.

89
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,640
I'm like, are you insane?

90
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,840
You saw that screen, too.

91
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,840
That's a beautiful screen.

92
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,200
It was pretty, but... That's the first time you've seen the Vita,

93
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
right?

94
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,200
Mm-hmm.

95
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,320
What I'm referring to, Loki is an early adopter of the Vita.

96
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,400
The Vita early adopter program started this week.

97
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,720
Very strange for a console launch.

98
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,440
I don't remember any console doing this before, but it's the whole like, pay an extra $50

99
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,040
and get it a week early.

100
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,200
Yeah, you get like a case and a crappy game.

101
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,560
And yeah, Little Deviants is not a good game.

102
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Yeah.

103
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,880
It's a terrible game, to be honest.

104
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,280
Yeah, I have not heard a good thing about Little Deviants.

105
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,360
So what made you take the plunge to get the early Vita?

106
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,920
I just wanted... I wanted the Vita.

107
00:04:52,920 --> 00:05:00,000
I decided, you know, I was gonna sell my 3DS, and so I did that, and I bought a Vita, and

108
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm glad I did.

109
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,200
I think I'm gonna get a lot more use out of this than I will ever my 3DS.

110
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,440
What is making you think those early signs?

111
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,680
It... there's... with the 3DS, it was just kind of like, ooh, 3D, and then that kind

112
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,840
of wore off really fast.

113
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,800
And then it's like, ooh, it's just a DS with an analog stick, you know.

114
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,280
I just didn't really play anything on there that, you know, I played a couple, you know,

115
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,200
the launch games, which are kind of like, okay, pilot wings, fun.

116
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,760
Or you know, Street Fighter was all right, you know, but it wasn't really kind of something

117
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,360
that I really could get into.

118
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,200
And then the Mario games came out, and I'm like, okay, well, Mario Kart and Super Mario

119
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,280
3D Land, you know, this is gonna be something that like, oh my God, you know, this is gonna

120
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,280
really make it for me.

121
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,400
But... and I played those, and they were okay, but then I was like looking ahead, well,

122
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,160
what games are I'm actually gonna be looking forward to on the 3DS?

123
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,400
And the only thing I could come up with was Kid Icarus, and that's it.

124
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,440
I mean, I was afraid that it was gonna go kind of the way of the Wii.

125
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,680
You just didn't have enough people to swap note with.

126
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,680
That was the problem.

127
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,840
You needed more 3D cats in your life.

128
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,640
I just added like three chatters to my 3DS friends list tonight.

129
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,280
In fact, I need to send them cats.

130
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,880
As soon as I get the confirmation that they've all added me back, 3D cats.

131
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,080
That's why you hang on to the 3DS.

132
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,080
Swap note.

133
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,080
Revolutionary.

134
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,080
I... no.

135
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,080
No.

136
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,080
I'm sorry.

137
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,080
That's not why.

138
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,720
It's like 3D email.

139
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,160
And then the virtual console stuff is kind of cool, but once again it's like, okay, yeah,

140
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,160
neat.

141
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,120
You know, I can play NES games on another system.

142
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,400
But I don't really need to play NES games.

143
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,160
If I really want to play Nintendo games, I can play them on my PC.

144
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,960
I can play them on my Wii.

145
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,360
I can play them on almost anything.

146
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,360
My PSP.

147
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,960
Well, for me, I wanted to hang on to the 3DS mostly because a system is only as good as

148
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
the games that are on it.

149
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,920
And I know you are not as invested in the lineup, but remember, I thought Mario 3D Land

150
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,400
was one of the best games that came out last year.

151
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,440
I put it in my top three for the year.

152
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,840
And I think it's a fantastic game, and I don't really want to part with it yet.

153
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:21,640
And I don't know, Nintendo is getting really good at this whole stealthy launch.

154
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,480
Like I think at E3 there's going to be some more titles that are announced that will be

155
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
banged up.

156
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,480
I'm hoping the Smash Brothers game.

157
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
But we'll see.

158
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,040
I'm not going to get my hopes up.

159
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm not, I'm not really, I'm not worried about the Smash Brothers game.

160
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,080
If I really want a Smash Brothers game like that, I can play it on the Wii or something.

161
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,920
And honestly, Smash Brothers was fun for a while on the Wii, and then I just didn't play

162
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,920
it anymore.

163
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,600
So I'm not, I don't know, I just don't see myself doing that.

164
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,000
However with the Vita, I can see myself, I can definitely see some more of the games

165
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,040
that I would normally play on it coming out for the Vita.

166
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,240
Like Call of Duty is going to be coming out for it.

167
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,840
A Grand Theft Auto is most definitely going to be coming out for it at some point.

168
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,880
You know, probably A Saint's Row the next time around.

169
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,120
That kind of stuff.

170
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,320
Walk us through a little bit of opening up the Vita for the first time, because my understanding

171
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,280
is A, it doesn't function at all like a Playstation, because the cross-media bar's not there.

172
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,560
And B, it has this whole like, welcome park or something it's called that's supposed to

173
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,560
orient you to the system?

174
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,400
I have not even touched that yet, to be honest.

175
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Alright, fine.

176
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,520
But yeah, there's the welcome park thing.

177
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:36,440
Basically when you, as with most like, systems out there nowadays, when you first get the

178
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,920
Vita, you have to do a system update.

179
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:45,780
So you perform the system update, and you update to 1.6, and then you set up everything,

180
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,120
your Playstation Network stuff, if you have an account or whatever.

181
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,280
I had to reset the password on mine, because it had been so long since I logged into the

182
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,640
Playstation Network.

183
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,400
I had forgotten my password, although I hadn't really forgotten my password, it was just

184
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,840
forcing me to reset my password, because I apparently haven't, no actually no, I must

185
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:10,360
have reset my password at one point, because I downloaded those, the sorry we broke the

186
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,000
Playstation Network for a month.

187
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,240
I had trouble recalling my password after that too, because they had so many freaking

188
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,200
rules on the password, I had to think of something that fell into those, because my old password,

189
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,040
without trying to give it away, well I don't use it anymore, but it broke one of the rules.

190
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,600
So I had to really think.

191
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,880
Well, I finally remembered it was, it was just, there was a capital letter in there

192
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,920
somewhere, so I was like, ah okay, I forgot.

193
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,880
So I went ahead and did that, and so I got that all taken care of, and then I, pretty

194
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:48,520
much what I did, because I actually got it, I got it on Valentine's Day, because I'm cool

195
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:54,680
like that, and so there wasn't really much on the Playstation Network store to download,

196
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:03,240
I mean it was, I don't even think any demos were up yet at that time, it was just full

197
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,920
game purchases for the first party stuff.

198
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:12,280
It wasn't until like midnight, well midnight eastern time, that all the demos started coming

199
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:18,680
up for Ubisoft games and some of the launch day stuff.

200
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:26,040
So it's gorgeous, that was the first thing I noticed, you know, the screen's just amazing

201
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,640
looking and the touchscreen stuff works great.

202
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,880
You know, I don't even really care that it's the little bubbles on there, I mean it's,

203
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:39,440
just the way it functions is really smooth, so that was kinda cool.

204
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,280
The near things neat, although I'm not really sure what the point of it is yet, I mean I

205
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,280
know I unlock some things and I can see some random people around there and I get these

206
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,320
really off the wall random friend requests and I don't even know who these people are.

207
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,880
Is it because you're showing up on the near thing or whatever it's called?

208
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,200
Yeah, I think it is.

209
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Interesting.

210
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,200
I don't know who they are.

211
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,200
Like, someone sent me a message like, okay maybe it's gonna say hey I'm Alyssa or something

212
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:10,160
and it was like, sup, I'm like that doesn't fucking help, I don't know who you are.

213
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,920
Yeah that's a good point, like if that all random stuff's gonna happen and you wanna

214
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,280
add us on PlayStation Network, you might wanna say you're a listener, so that way we know

215
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:23,000
like you're not like a random, does that thing show where you live?

216
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's not gonna give that away, right?

217
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,720
No, it just, it'll say like you're, and it's not even accurate, entirely accurate, it'll

218
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:37,960
show like, okay, your location is this cross section, you know, this cross street, which

219
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:45,460
is not entirely accurate to where I'm at, and then it'll say this person is, you know,

220
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,800
this far away from you.

221
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,360
It doesn't show where they're at, it just shows, okay, this person's this far away from

222
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
you.

223
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,360
Approximately.

224
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,840
So, that's about it.

225
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,520
So what's the point of that, besides being able to like, add random ass people who are

226
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,720
your neighbors?

227
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:05,520
Um, you, well you can see like popularity of certain games, like it'll change, you know,

228
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:11,520
um, like, oh okay, you know, Katamari's, you know, going up, or, I don't know.

229
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:16,920
What is popular in your town, Orangevale, or whatever, wherever it is you live?

230
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,880
It just shows, seems to show the stuff that I have, like I'm gonna pull it up right now,

231
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,920
we'll see what's popular right here.

232
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,960
Just going to our chatroom at chat.orangevalery.com, Tigerclaw says, heh, sky on swap note now.

233
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,160
Yes, I saw that all the chatters added me, so I sent some cat pictures.

234
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,840
Now, Tigerclaw, cause you were already on my list, you already saw these same notes,

235
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,840
I just, I went back and sent some old notes.

236
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:42,200
Cause I don't have new 3D cat pictures, but I will get some soon.

237
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,600
So there's your 3D cat update.

238
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Back to the Vita.

239
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:50,840
Okay, so right now, I'm syncing with the area, and it says I've traveled 21 kilometers today.

240
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,760
Yeah, it's kilometers, it's not miles, even though this.

241
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,880
You gotta be able to change that somewhere, I'm sure.

242
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,880
I don't know.

243
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,640
So, let's see here, out and about is one of the options, and it's showing popularity surge.

244
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,440
There are five people playing Katamari.

245
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:12,600
Topping the charts, the number of people for Little Deviance.

246
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:20,120
And topping the charts, 18 people playing Little Deviance, and Katamari, Lumis.

247
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,480
I think it's just showing the stuff I've played, cause that's what it seems like that's happening

248
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,480
there.

249
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:31,560
And it says also, I've just unlocked another thing, another discovery.

250
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,240
Well, I'm also, I also live in the poorer part of town, so nobody probably has a Vita

251
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,240
here.

252
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,720
Like, I just unlocked a ModNation Racer road trip thing.

253
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,480
I don't even know what it is, Alien 1 is what it is.

254
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,240
A track, it says track part, it's from some, oh, it's from the person I just added, who

255
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,000
I still don't know who the hell they are, Daredevil Onion.

256
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,720
They sent me a track part.

257
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,960
That sounds like what Dark Sakura had for lunch today.

258
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,120
So I will download your track part, but I don't know who that is, so that doesn't really

259
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,120
help me.

260
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:13,880
Yeah, so, I mean, I don't, I still don't really know what the functionality of this is supposed

261
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,880
to be.

262
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:22,280
I can see some people that are playing nearby, but I just don't really understand what this

263
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,120
is all about yet.

264
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,880
Oh, here we go, I think I can, units of distance, there we go.

265
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,920
I knew you could get it in miles.

266
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,920
There you go.

267
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,920
Anyways.

268
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,920
So, there's that.

269
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,960
Alright, tell us, tell us a little bit about the games, quickly.

270
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,560
You've played, what, you've played Rayman, you were raving about the graphics in Rayman,

271
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,560
right?

272
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,640
Rayman I actually haven't played too much of yet.

273
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,480
I just like, ooh, pretty graphics, and I went on and played something else.

274
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,040
But yeah, Rayman's really, really gorgeous.

275
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:55,840
I mean, Rayman Origins on the console looked great, and I'd say it's exactly like the console.

276
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:01,520
I mean, that level of detail is there, and it's just, it's just jaw-dropping of how gorgeous

277
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,760
the game is.

278
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,760
And it plays great.

279
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,400
It's a great platformer game.

280
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,640
So that one's a good one.

281
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:13,560
I got Luminous, Luminous is, you know, Luminous, there are some weird things that they've added

282
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,920
to it, like you can tap the back panel, you're supposed to be able to tap it with the music

283
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:22,240
and you unlock, it helps you unlock your power-up faster, although you can just spam the back

284
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,600
of your system to unlock it as well.

285
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,280
So I don't really know that point of that.

286
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,200
The music in it's alright, although most of it I don't recognize, and most of it isn't

287
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,300
as epic as I thought it would be.

288
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:43,340
But there's some still, you know, good ones in there, like there's, oh, what was it, Window

289
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,800
Liquor is in there, and that's awesome.

290
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,800
And there's some other, some other songs that I've recognized.

291
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,760
I heard something about a whole new kind of block that will shuffle block colors around

292
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,760
it.

293
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,240
Yeah, there's a block that will shuffle some of the stuff on there, there's also the blocks

294
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:08,300
that you can drop, well the power-up that you start off with the default avatar allows

295
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:15,880
you to, it'll break anything of the same color that's touching it, so you can eliminate a

296
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,880
lot of stuff on there.

297
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,160
Which was the old Luminous game, if I remember right.

298
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,200
Yes, I think they have that.

299
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:30,040
So it's fun, I like the game, and I actually played it one round for a good three hours

300
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,040
I think the other day.

301
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,780
That seems to be getting the best reviews out of all the Vita games, is Luminous, which

302
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,780
doesn't surprise me.

303
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,780
It's a fun-

304
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,160
It's the PSP all over again.

305
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,080
It's a fun game, but here's the thing, and this was kind of a problem with the original

306
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:47,120
Luminous game, but it's even worse than this one, is some of those skins are so hard to

307
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,120
see.

308
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,960
Like there'll be some, some of the skins are completely flat, and they have the square

309
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,480
blocks and stuff like that, some of them are like rounded or whatever.

310
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,200
Some of them though have this weird fish-eye thing to them where it kind of, the screen

311
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:05,500
bends a little bit, and it's just really disorienting.

312
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,520
It's frustrating because I don't like, I don't like the look of it.

313
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,200
I guess that's part of the challenge, maybe?

314
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
I don't know.

315
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,920
It's not even really a challenge, it's just like, okay, this song has this skin.

316
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,080
It's just, it's dumb.

317
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,040
But whatever, I mean, it is what it is.

318
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,040
So that's Luminous.

319
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,800
Honestly, I haven't played Little Deviants at all because I heard it's terrible.

320
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,000
My coworker played it and he said, yep, it's terrible.

321
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,360
So I haven't gotten to try that yet, so I can't really say if it's actually terrible

322
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,600
or not, but I'm not planning on keeping it too long.

323
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,280
I'm actually thinking of just trading it in and getting another memory card.

324
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:48,520
And then, of course, I also played Touch My Katamari, which, it must have been a while

325
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,600
since I've played other Katamari games because the levels seem new to me, but I hear that

326
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,600
they're not.

327
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,480
I hear they're just repeats of the old game again, which is kind of disappointing.

328
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,920
It's really hard, I've found.

329
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:05,040
I mean, I've been failing levels left and right and usually I breeze right through it.

330
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,600
It's almost like it'll give you enough time to do everything.

331
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,040
Not even necessarily breezing through, but I can't even get a five star rating after

332
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,200
one or two tries.

333
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,880
It's almost impossible.

334
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,960
I think maybe some of the controls in there, but the way they've done the controls are

335
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,400
kind of weird.

336
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,600
They have everything mapped to buttons, which is nice because I don't like a lot of the

337
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:38,280
touch screen stuff, like having to use the back panel to flip my Katamari around or jump.

338
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,600
That's mapped to the shoulder buttons as well.

339
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,920
And then to do the charge, you either have to hold the touch screen on the front or you

340
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:53,560
spin your analog sticks around in a certain direction.

341
00:18:53,560 --> 00:19:00,240
And I don't know, neither way seems to work very well and that's kind of sad.

342
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,240
It's really bad.

343
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,240
And at the same time, it's like, hmm, yeah, that's cool that you mapped that to the analog

344
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,720
sticks and yet you have all these face buttons you're not using at all.

345
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,240
None of the face buttons are used in the game.

346
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,800
Maybe they overdid it from people's complaints about the PSP game, but they could have just

347
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,800
okay.

348
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,600
They could either had it where you map your own custom buttons or they could have had

349
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,760
it where, okay, Dash is now one of the buttons on the face.

350
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,320
How hard would that have been?

351
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:34,000
You added multiple stuff for the other buttons in the game, but oh, let's just not map it

352
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,240
to the face buttons because that makes sense.

353
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,080
Before you get to another game, let me read some comments from chat, chat.orangetonstrader.com.

354
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,760
Ahamkara in our chat room says, I find the Vita annoying already.

355
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,920
I tried one at an evil G in my area.

356
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:51,480
In some menus you have multiple choices on screen, but you have to touch to choose to

357
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,560
proceed.

358
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,840
No buttons are used.

359
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,340
You know, I had that same problem when I was on or when I went to evil G. Yes, I set foot

360
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:03,400
in one to play it as well as I forgot that it had a touch screen because I associate

361
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,360
the touch screen thing with like Apple, Nintendo, like I just forgot and I'm sitting there in

362
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,640
the menu for ModNation races.

363
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,400
I'm like, why can't I play the God damn game?

364
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
It's not a big deal.

365
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,400
Yeah, I know.

366
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,840
Once I figured it out, I'm like, oh yeah, it's actually, it's really nice using the

367
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,840
touch screen.

368
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,440
A really interesting point that was brought up was that it does add a barrier for access

369
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,440
ability.

370
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:27,040
You know, I have a blind friend on Twitter that follows that's like, you know, this is

371
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,940
limiting my accessibility cause you know, a blind person can use the buttons and everything,

372
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,800
but might not necessarily know where to touch on the screen to use the menus.

373
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,960
Well that's, it's going to be actually in the main menus and all that.

374
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:43,040
Well, here's the problem with the main menus too, is that they can be all, all those buttons

375
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,720
just like you can on the iOS and stuff, they can all be rearranged.

376
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,760
So you know, it may not, and when you get stuff installed, it might not exactly be in

377
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,120
the right order that you're thinking it's going to be in.

378
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:03,000
So I don't know, they could easily add a button, you know, or patch it in later on, but it's

379
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,440
going to be kind of difficult because icons can get added left and right.

380
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,400
I don't know, unless you can change the sound effect that when you select a certain one,

381
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,400
it sounds different.

382
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,400
I don't know.

383
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,400
Well, usually, I mean, think about it.

384
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,920
It's really, you know, there's a lot of things that we take for granted sometimes, but I

385
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:23,200
mean, a lot of folks in the blind gaming community, I get the sense they kind of, they're kind

386
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,040
of trade ideas and so forth, and they know exactly how many taps one way and how many

387
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,040
taps another way to get the result that they want.

388
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,360
And you know, sometimes you might have very limited visibility of certain colors and so

389
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,100
forth, and it's very, very sound oriented.

390
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:41,700
Like I know fighting games are very popular because you use the sound cues a lot in those

391
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,700
games.

392
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,560
There's some YouTube out there, some blind guy just fucking regulating on Soulcalibur,

393
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,640
I seem to remember, and it's all sound.

394
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,640
Maybe.

395
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,640
Yeah.

396
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,160
But you adapt to what you know, but sometimes the system puts a barrier in place.

397
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,280
It does seem a little silly that they can't just, you know, I get, okay, yes, we get it.

398
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:05,000
The Vita has a touch screen, all right, now maybe not everybody wants to whore that out.

399
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,060
Like any negative thing I'm hearing about the Vita on like Uncharted or even a game

400
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,520
like Little Deviants is that, you know what, or like Uncharted, let's take Uncharted, is

401
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,700
like, okay, A, it wasn't developed by Naughty Dog, B, the folks that developed it felt the

402
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:22,240
need to really whore the touch screen and all the new stuff in it.

403
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,000
I don't think it's that they felt the need, I think it's Sony felt the need to tell them

404
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
to do that.

405
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Right.

406
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,800
You know, it's kind of like, you know, Excite Truck, Excite Truck is an awesome racing game,

407
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,160
and then Nintendo felt the need to tell them, hey, you know what, we need to add some mini

408
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,160
games in the middle of the race.

409
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,080
Makes some fucking sense.

410
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,680
The other thing I don't really care for about the Vita is sometimes it's very uncomfortable

411
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,080
to hold the system.

412
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,040
Like for example, the next game, which I got, which is funny because it's a full game, I

413
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:57,000
didn't anticipate it being a full game, apparently when the system launched they had, like I

414
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,840
said, demos that came up, you know, Ubisoft demos and stuff, and one of the games I did

415
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,520
want to check out was Michael Jackson and the Experience because it's a rhythm music

416
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,680
game on the Vita, and apparently it's, you know, pretty fun to play.

417
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,200
So I downloaded that demo, didn't even really get a chance, I downloaded that in Uncharted

418
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,000
because I was going to play them the next day.

419
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,480
Can you do downloading in the background?

420
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,480
Yes.

421
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,480
Okay, cool.

422
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,480
Yes, you can.

423
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,640
And you can pause games too, you can just like totally go out of it, which is great

424
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,880
because I use the web browser on there and web browser is awesome.

425
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,880
It works great.

426
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,880
Really?

427
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,880
You can just...

428
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,880
Does it do Flash?

429
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,960
I don't think so.

430
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,560
But you can go to websites and you can just, you know, hit the guide button, boop, go to

431
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,440
a website, okay, I need to look up a FAQ on this game, look it up, whatever, and then

432
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,560
switch back to your game again and take off.

433
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,280
But yeah, Michael Jackson and Experience, actually a pretty fun music game.

434
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,980
But here's the ironic part.

435
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:51,000
The demo, originally when they first put it up, was the full game.

436
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,500
Oops.

437
00:23:52,500 --> 00:24:01,440
So there's a few mix-ups where it was allowing you to download the full game for a few hours.

438
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,200
So I have the full game of Michael Jackson and the Experience.

439
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,600
I didn't pay for it, I still earn trophies from it, I just can't sync them because I

440
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,520
didn't actually purchase the game.

441
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,520
But I don't care.

442
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,240
Interesting that it knows that.

443
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,000
If I rent games from Gamefly or something, will I be able to do my trophies?

444
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,800
Yeah, you will be able to because it's the physical cartridge.

445
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:25,880
I have the digital download, so since it doesn't show that I have the actual full game, I don't

446
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,540
have whatever it is to sync it.

447
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:32,040
Great question from Tigerclaw in our chatroom at chat.orangesontraday.com, does the Vita

448
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,280
have an internet radio player?

449
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,660
I don't think so.

450
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:40,900
We had that OLR PSP.com, which technically is still there, it hasn't been updated in

451
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,680
a very long time.

452
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,840
Yeah, whatever.

453
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,760
I tried going to OLR Vita.com.

454
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:54,500
I tried going to the All Games page today, and it did not play the radio player, so.

455
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,760
So it might not do HTML5.

456
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,760
Yeah, probably not.

457
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,960
But no wait, is it Flash?

458
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,760
I think All Games.com is Flash.

459
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,760
It's HTML5 now.

460
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,760
Is it?

461
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,760
Yeah.

462
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,760
So it doesn't, I don't think it does that.

463
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,760
Oh yeah, because it works on my iPhone.

464
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,440
I think you can very easily add an app for that.

465
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,120
I mean, I haven't really mess, well let's click music.

466
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,240
I haven't even really tried the music part yet because I don't have any music on here.

467
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,240
But uh.

468
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,320
What, you mean you're not downloading episodes of OLR to your phone?

469
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,320
Or your PSP?

470
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:26,000
Dude, I have a four gig card, it would fill that thing up really fast.

471
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,120
That's true, that's true.

472
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,440
So no, I don't have that.

473
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,800
No, it doesn't look like it has a radio player in there, which is fine, you know.

474
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,840
That could be added later on, easy, I mean.

475
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,840
So.

476
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,300
Hey, if there's a way to easily get OLR episodes in the PlayStation Vita, though, for those

477
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,080
that do have bigger memory cards, I would let, you know, I'm all about, get the show

478
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,720
out, get the show out there, however we can do it, you know.

479
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,720
I'm all for that.

480
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,720
So.

481
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,240
Alright, well anyway, we talked about the Vita an awfully long time, so.

482
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:00,720
What do you hope to most see from the system in the future?

483
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,720
More games.

484
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,240
I mean, there's a lot of games coming out already for it, and a lot of games I'm looking

485
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,240
forward to.

486
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:13,680
You know, the new Resistance game, Gravity Rush looks awesome, and I was trying to download

487
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:19,600
the demo for it on my PS3 because I have a Japanese account and a UK account and stuff

488
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,600
like that for, you know, getting multi-region demos, but they won't let you put them on

489
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,120
the Vita, because you can only download demos for the account that's on the Vita because

490
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,560
that's linked, that's stuck to one account, not multiple accounts.

491
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,640
If I could put multiple accounts on there, I could have demos from all regions, which

492
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,160
would have been awesome, because they also have the Twitter app over there, and the Flickr

493
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,200
app already out in Japan, it's just not over here yet until Wednesday.

494
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,920
Oh yeah, I forget those things have cameras on them.

495
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,760
Yeah, they're not very good.

496
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,760
Yeah.

497
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,760
It's about as good as the 3DS.

498
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:56,280
I mean, it's, they, I really wish they'd have a bigger camera, but I understand their thing

499
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,960
was, it's gameplay first, you know, camera is just like, eh, whatever, but yeah, it has

500
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,720
a front and back camera.

501
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,720
Weird.

502
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,280
And, here's the other thing that kind of sucks about it, the AR games aren't up yet, so they

503
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,280
have these cards that don't do anything at the moment.

504
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,280
Not yet.

505
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:18,440
But they will, they will on Wednesday, and I'm trying to think what else is kind of cool.

506
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,200
Yeah, the Welcome Park stuff, I haven't played it yet, but it's a bunch of little minigames

507
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,200
to get you acclimated to the features of the Vita, and you can earn trophies from it, so

508
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,000
that's kind of something, and I would recommend if you're thinking about gaining a system

509
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,480
and thinking about gaining a memory card, you probably want more than 4 gigs, because

510
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:43,180
I even just, you know, trying out some demos and stuff, it fills up the card really fast.

511
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,040
But 8 gigs is probably, probably good.

512
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,040
Alright.

513
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,040
Well, I know that was extensive, but, you know, new system launch week, what can you

514
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,040
do?

515
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,280
I will be getting mine Wednesday, I'm really looking forward to it, I've only gotten to

516
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,360
play with one a little bit, I'm getting Luminous and Katamari, so I'll tell you my impressions

517
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,360
next week.

518
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,200
Dark Sakura, I know one's not in the cards for you right away, but you, you were thinking

519
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,960
about it a little bit, but you want an iPad more, huh?

520
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,760
I really want the iPad 3.

521
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,960
Yeah, because you can do more design stuff on that.

522
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,760
Yeah, it's more practical for me, in that I can play tons of games on it too.

523
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,760
Sure, sure.

524
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,840
Alright, well, anyhow, but, but, it's, you gotta admit, it's pretty gorgeous, the screen's

525
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,840
pretty gorgeous.

526
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,840
Yeah, it's nice.

527
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,840
Alright.

528
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,040
Uh, let's, let's move on, we always start off the show with How Was Your Gaming Week,

529
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,680
which I guess we kind of already did in a sense, but let's open it up to whatever we've

530
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,680
been playing.

531
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,920
Ladies first, Dark Sakura, How Was Your Gaming Week?

532
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,680
Uh, it was pretty eventful, I mean, relatively.

533
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,160
Dan and I played a lot of Bubble Bobble this morning.

534
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,800
A lot of Bubble Bobble.

535
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,800
I suck at it.

536
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
Old school classic.

537
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
Yeah.

538
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,800
What system, because it was on everything.

539
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,080
Not just one collection, but on the RPS3.

540
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,400
Oh god, is that the one that came with, uh, it was like Bubble Bobble and it had-

541
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,400
Rainbow Islands and the Rainbow Islands Deluxe.

542
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,620
Oh, I thought there was another one, no, because that was a Capcom game, what am I thinking?

543
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:02,280
I'm thinking of that game where you shoot the arrow up and it explodes the bubbles and

544
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:06,400
it creates like a chain at the top of the screen and anything that hits it explodes

545
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,400
too.

546
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,400
Puzzle Bobble?

547
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
No, no, no, no, no.

548
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,400
Best of Move?

549
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,400
No, it's Capcom.

550
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,400
It was an old arcade game, somebody in chat was yelling it out.

551
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,400
Buster Brothers?

552
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,400
No.

553
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,400
That's it.

554
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,400
No.

555
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,400
Well, yeah, now I know.

556
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,760
I thought, I don't know why I tied those two games together in my mind because they weren't

557
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,840
even the same company, but Bubbles.

558
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
No.

559
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:28,040
We played, um, Bubble Bobble a little bit today and, um, I was very alarmed that my

560
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:32,360
friend who was over there at the time had never ever seen it.

561
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,360
And he's my age.

562
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,360
And I said-

563
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,360
How do you not know the song at least?

564
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,160
What planet were you born on?

565
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,820
So, um, and I played well.

566
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,820
And I played-

567
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,820
And you played well at it?

568
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:49,960
A lot of Busta Move on my phone, which I broke down and bought another puzzle pack.

569
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,960
Who in the world does not know this song?

570
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,960
That's like one of the best ones.

571
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,960
Yeah, this is the best one.

572
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,960
Sing along.

573
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:08,980
And I would be stuck in your head all day.

574
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,980
And the person next to you on the bus is looking at you funny.

575
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,840
I was making up lyrics to it.

576
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,840
Were you?

577
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,840
Yeah.

578
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,960
Have you ever watched that if video game themes had lyrics?

579
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,720
No, I haven't.

580
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,720
I've heard of it though.

581
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,720
Those are funny.

582
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,440
Um, actually, what's my favorite?

583
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:32,240
They should do a Bubble Bobble like, I was actually just singing Bubble Bobble as the

584
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,240
words.

585
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,680
Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, yeah.

586
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,000
So how was it?

587
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,620
You had, you know, games back in the day didn't really have extensive soundtracks, you know?

588
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,840
Like they started too late in the NES era, like especially a game like Final Fantasy

589
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,840
or something.

590
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,360
But a lot of those old games had like one little riff that would play through the whole

591
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,360
damn game.

592
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,360
So it had to be addicting.

593
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,560
Oh, and there's one other game that actually I was looking for that I don't think I have

594
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:05,200
on PC Engine that I want is Son Son 2.

595
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,800
Son Son is a fun little side scroller and I was, found myself wishing today that I had

596
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,360
a copy, and that's it.

597
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,360
Good times.

598
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,200
Uh, Loki, I know you've already talked extensively about the Vita, but opening it up to whatever

599
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,120
you've been playing this week, is there anything else to share?

600
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,600
Call of duty.

601
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,120
My coworkers are starting to get really mad at me.

602
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,920
Hasn't that been the running theme for how long now?

603
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:32,520
Yeah, well, thankfully my other coworker comes back off of his paternity leave, so at least

604
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,520
there'll be someone else to play.

605
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,720
But yeah, they're getting mad.

606
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:43,400
They had a conference in a, or they had a little group meeting in the conference room.

607
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:52,040
I'm trying to think of one of the funny, uh, oh yeah, they, of course, you know, they know

608
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,880
that there's people that play professional Starcraft in Korea.

609
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,880
Of course, they mucked it up when they were doing the install.

610
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,560
Why don't you just go, we're just going to send you to Korea to play competitive World

611
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,560
of Warcraft.

612
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,560
I'm like, okay.

613
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:11,960
Well, if you want to get technical, arena is a big thing they do at Blizzcon.

614
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,800
And I don't know if Korea is necessarily the big, I think that's Europe is really like,

615
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,600
there's a lot of teams and you're like the biggest rating guilds are all over there.

616
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,760
So I mean, it's just, it was just funny.

617
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,760
All right.

618
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,960
Anything else for your gaming week that you want to share?

619
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,600
Um, that's it.

620
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
All right.

621
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:36,280
So gaming week, um, not a whole, whole, whole lot, but some new stuff I of course been playing.

622
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,280
Wow.

623
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,280
I'm on a rating team in wow now.

624
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,760
So it's a little different, by the way, speaking of Warcraft, Horde house is coming back this

625
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,760
week.

626
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,560
Um, which is exciting because we've been gone for a month.

627
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,600
We've just, we kind of suffered from burnout a little bit.

628
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,800
And as you guys know, my cohost is on hiatus from wow.

629
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:55,480
But um, and, and I just want to quell shiny fears, extra for an, I will both be on the

630
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,480
new show.

631
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,480
So don't worry about that.

632
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,960
Nobody got fired or nothing, but it's going to be a little different and you'll have to

633
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,120
tune in this week to find out how.

634
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,240
But one of the things I'll be able to talk more about is like a legit rating because

635
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,440
I've been doing more of that and more PVP.

636
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,960
Um, so lots of wow, but I ha I believe it or not have had a life outside of wow.

637
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,280
Um, a lot of it centers around the PlayStation three.

638
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,960
I decided, and I'm going to get shit for this.

639
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,640
I already know it, but I decided to take the plunge and sign up for PlayStation plus this

640
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,640
week.

641
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,340
Um, and I think the catalyst that did it for me was the fact that the Simpsons arcade game

642
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,200
was free with PlayStation plus.

643
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:33,600
And it really made me stop and think, damn, they are giving out free games all the freaking

644
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,720
time on PlayStation plus.

645
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,480
And especially if I've invested in the Vita and so forth, I'm getting all these minis.

646
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,480
Why the heck not?

647
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,480
I'm just going to get it now.

648
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,480
Yes.

649
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,760
Before you guys, I know, I know people are typing it in chat already.

650
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:49,360
I already know if I, if I stopped paying for PlayStation plus, I'm fully aware you lose

651
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,020
access to all these games.

652
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,600
That's kind of the, the catalyst to it all.

653
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:59,440
But then I was thinking, how many freaking games have I bought on Xbox live arcade hint

654
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,980
a lot that I really don't play anymore.

655
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:06,160
That if I lost access to it today, I'd be like, eh, Oh, well, you know, despite the

656
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:12,520
fact that I paid five or $10 and I first got it, you know, so I'm not like, I fully realized

657
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,200
that going into this deal that I might lose access to these games later on, but it's giving

658
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:22,360
me the chance to really sample things that otherwise might not be worth a full download.

659
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,440
For example, Simpson's arcade game.

660
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,440
Okay.

661
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,440
Here's the thing.

662
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,640
We've all been wanting this game on, on the network, the PlayStation network and Xbox

663
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,640
live forever.

664
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:34,520
Like I even want to say we did a listless it's on iPhone a long, long time.

665
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,880
Ah, it's a reimagining is on the iPhone.

666
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,880
Tricky, tricky.

667
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,700
Cause EA has the license now.

668
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:45,640
So the one that's on the iPhone is inspired by the arcade game, but it's not exactly the

669
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:49,400
arcade game, but the one that's on PlayStation network.

670
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,720
And I don't know how they worked out the licensing and whatever, but it is the classic arcade

671
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,720
game.

672
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,560
Uh, the U S ROM and the Japanese ROM and all that stuff, you can play it online.

673
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,140
And yeah, I played through it and I was like, Oh man, I used to love this game in the arcades,

674
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:05,760
but now that I've done it, will I do it again next month?

675
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,040
Will I play it every week?

676
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,440
Probably not.

677
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,760
So if I decide not to renew PlayStation plus after three months, yeah, I know, but it's

678
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,440
not look, look, the stages and stuff are different.

679
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,360
Like it, they, they, they know that people want the Simpsons arcade game on the phone,

680
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,360
but EA didn't do the Simpsons arcade game.

681
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,360
Konami did.

682
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,360
This one's put up.

683
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,360
Oh, that's right.

684
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,360
Yep.

685
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,920
So, and the one that's on network is a Konami.

686
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,360
So yeah, JV Mon says the same thing in chat sky.

687
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,200
You've bought hundreds of dollars in XBLA games.

688
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,840
You've played once.

689
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,840
Absolutely right.

690
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,920
Uh, Kaijuto says, Rob, if all you wanted was Simpsons arcade game, you could have just

691
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,960
bought it for the same price as PSN plus.

692
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,280
Yes, that's true.

693
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,860
But then I thought, you know, why not get some of the extra other games?

694
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,360
And I got two other games too already.

695
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:55,880
Uh, one of them was this kind of basic bitch, uh, monkey ball clone game.

696
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:00,640
It's called hamster ball, but it not only had a monkey ball clone, but it had like a

697
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,180
marble madness clone.

698
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:05,840
And I started playing that, like there's two different types of like versions and one of

699
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,840
them was a marble madness clone.

700
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:10,880
I was like, okay, this, this is kind of cool because like marble madness is one of those

701
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,880
games.

702
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,680
I forgot was out there, but I really did love that game.

703
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,560
And to be playing this, I was like, what the hell does this remind me of?

704
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,560
Oh shit.

705
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,560
It's marble madness.

706
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,560
And I was like, okay.

707
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,560
Okay.

708
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,560
Hamster ball.

709
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,560
I'm onto you.

710
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,560
So that was kind of neat.

711
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,560
And I didn't pay for it.

712
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:31,860
Uh, and then I got a game called battle Fantasia, which was a very chibi RPG ish fighting game

713
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:35,520
where you actually have hit points and you know, not a game I probably would have checked

714
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,020
out otherwise, but it was, it's neat and I didn't pay anything for it.

715
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:42,880
So, uh, go to our chat at chat.org.com.

716
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,480
Uh, where is it?

717
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,480
Rama?

718
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,480
Rama said PlayStation plus a fool and their money is soon parted.

719
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,480
Well, fine.

720
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,560
You know, you're welcome to your opinion.

721
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,560
You are that fool.

722
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,560
Well, hold on though.

723
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,280
No, somebody made me thinking of Adam's family.

724
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,900
Honestly answer me this, how is Xbox live any better of a deal at this point?

725
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,640
Like I'm not trying to sound like a Sony fan boy.

726
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,880
I'm really not, but like, you know, go back four years ago in this show when Sony was

727
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,880
really struggling.

728
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,720
I didn't even hell as much as anyone else did, but I really feel like we've reached

729
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:16,760
this point where outside of connect, I feel like my PlayStation three has more to offer.

730
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,840
And that even goes as far as like PlayStation plus and stuff.

731
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:26,240
What does Xbox live give me online gaming, which is on PlayStation network for free anyway,

732
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,160
you know, Xbox isn't exactly giving away games or any of this stuff.

733
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:33,040
So, I mean, I really am starting to question why the hell am I hanging onto an Xbox live

734
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,040
gold account?

735
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:38,160
I don't play anything on Xbox live right now that isn't a connect game.

736
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,160
Don't get me wrong.

737
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,200
I love dance central and rhythm party and all that, but I'm hanging on to Xbox live

738
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,800
gold because I've already paid for it.

739
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,320
Why is Konami made a game called fish kebab?

740
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,640
Cause they, they can have weird stuff.

741
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,640
Not meaning to derail.

742
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,480
I was just looking through it.

743
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,480
Okay.

744
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,360
So, well I, I'm not going to give you shit because it's your money and you can do what

745
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,760
the fuck you want with it.

746
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,800
So let me know how it works out.

747
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,800
I will.

748
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,800
Yeah, that's all.

749
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,080
It's neat that you get the minis and all that.

750
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,480
And black Wolf and chat says it amuses me to always here.

751
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,400
I didn't pay for it when you got access to it by paying for it.

752
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,400
Okay.

753
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,400
Blah, blah, blah, whatever.

754
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,400
Fine.

755
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,120
But, but at the same time, I've already probably got more value out of this than I have my

756
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,640
year of Xbox live so far.

757
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,640
Yeah.

758
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,640
Really?

759
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,400
Do we get free games each month with Xbox live?

760
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
No.

761
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,960
I mean, we get discounts sometimes and demos.

762
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,360
They're not free cause you paid for it.

763
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,360
That's true.

764
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,080
I have that Castlevania game.

765
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,200
I haven't tried it.

766
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,200
It's interesting.

767
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,000
Castlevania puzzle on core of the night.

768
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
It's weird.

769
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Yeah.

770
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
All right.

771
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Anyhow.

772
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
So you know what?

773
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,040
I did it and if I didn't, you know, it's just, I just did three months.

774
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,400
So I was like, you know, if I don't want to do it and I already turned off the auto subscription

775
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,400
thing cause it tries to make you turn it on, but you just go in and turn it off and there

776
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,400
you go.

777
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,680
Which is already a plus, which is already, yeah.

778
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,800
Something you can't do on the three 60.

779
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:10,880
So again, without taking a, a, uh, a trip to India via the telephone.

780
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,880
So there you go.

781
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,880
All right.

782
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,480
That's enough of my gaming week.

783
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,580
So let's talk housekeeping real quick of which I don't have a whole lot, but I will of course

784
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:22,320
mention the Facebook and the Twitter's facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

785
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,320
We're also on Twitter, twitter.com slash orange launch radio or twitter.com slash O L R and

786
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,840
we're on Google plus under orange lounge radio.

787
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,880
No URL there.

788
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,880
Question for you.

789
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:37,160
Since you use your PlayStation three more than I do, um, your PlayStation three, you

790
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,760
can set it up to where your trophy stuff gets posted to the Facebook, right?

791
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,760
Yeah.

792
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,760
Okay.

793
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,680
You can do that with the Vita too, but I obviously did not set that up cause I don't want to spend

794
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,800
my, well, all somebody has to do is block the application, but I actually kind of enjoy

795
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,480
reading it because it tells me like I leave it unblocked and I don't mind people posting

796
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:01,120
those because it tells me what games my friends are playing and a lot of times I'll see so

797
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,260
and so is playing this game and I'll be like, is this any good?

798
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,520
And I get the same thing.

799
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,700
Like I posted trophies from Simpsons arcade game and somebody was like, so is it more

800
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,640
nostalgia or is it actually fun?

801
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,160
And I was kind of like, well, it's a little bit of both.

802
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,840
So you know, I, I, I do actually like the trophy spam, but thank heavens on Facebook

803
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:25,720
you can easily block it and it won't upgrade you to timeline.

804
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,440
So, well, upgrade you to timeline.

805
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,440
Yeah.

806
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,960
Like all these apps want to upgrade you to timeline now.

807
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,120
Like you try to use Hulu or Pinterest.

808
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:38,920
It's all, you can install this app, but it'll upgrade you to timeline the whole Facebook

809
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,920
timeline.

810
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,920
Horrible page.

811
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,920
I can't stand it.

812
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,080
I don't subscribe to anything anymore on Facebook.

813
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,080
Yeah.

814
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:49,040
I already see I was in timeline before I was in timeline back in September.

815
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,600
So you're already stuck with it.

816
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,600
I hate it.

817
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,720
I hate looking at those timeline pages like sums on the left and sums on the right.

818
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,720
It's weird.

819
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,560
I don't look at my page anymore though.

820
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,200
I only look at my feed.

821
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,320
So all right, let's move on with some actual gaming news.

822
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,320
Loki.

823
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,040
So Sony spending a lot of money to promote the Vita, which is kind of funny cause I've

824
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,060
yet to see any advertisements for the Vita.

825
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:16,640
So I don't know where this $50 million is going, but I'm assuming that they're gonna

826
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,160
start playing commercials after the system comes out, which is a little odd, but okay.

827
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:29,120
And there's a few commercials floating around, I guess, on the internet, but anyways, yeah,

828
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:38,440
part of it's of course the hashtag game changer on Twitter, which I mean, I don't know, whatever.

829
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:42,320
And they have hashtags for everything and like hashtags for people posting comments

830
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:47,840
during the Whitney Houston funeral, which my wife watched by the way, part of it at

831
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,840
least.

832
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,720
But yeah, I mean, they're used for everything.

833
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:59,160
So yeah, and of course, you know, there's the huge Twitter campaign and I'm assuming

834
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,280
lots of TV stuff, like probably like the PlayStation 3 was.

835
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,280
So it'll be interesting.

836
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,880
They're definitely working that out.

837
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:12,760
And then of course, you know, like some of the first party PlayStation 3 titles, the

838
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:18,240
PlayStation passes are making their way to the Vita as well.

839
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:24,280
Two games that launched that do have an online pass would be Hotshots Golf World Invitational

840
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,320
and Wipeout 2048.

841
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,240
Why those titles are the only ones that have online passes?

842
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:33,320
Those are the only ones with actually online multiplayer simultaneous.

843
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:39,140
Note, ModNation Racers does not have simultaneous multiplayer.

844
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:45,460
They have this fancy term called asynchronous multiplayer, which means you download someone's

845
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,840
ghost run and you race against that.

846
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,760
There is no multiplayer in that game.

847
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,880
AlphaKananagram in our chatroom says, I've seen ads for the Vita for the US.

848
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,880
They suck.

849
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,360
Also, one of the US commercials shows 3G gaming when you can't game on 3G.

850
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,460
You can.

851
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,740
You can game, but you can't game over 3G.

852
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:09,280
Maybe it's showing up on things like maybe it's playing on ESPN or something you don't

853
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,280
really watch.

854
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,520
Maybe that's where the commercials are.

855
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,720
I don't watch a lot of TV either, so it's possible.

856
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,040
But I mean, I don't know.

857
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,720
I was watching Comedy Central the other day, and I didn't see anything.

858
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,400
But then again, I don't watch a lot of TV, so maybe.

859
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,080
AlphaKananagram in our chatroom continued to chat that OrangeLaunchRadio.com saying,

860
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:32,080
also, I heard another one showed someone playing it outside with good screen quality, but I

861
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:36,480
think screen can't do that in sunlight IRL, so it's sort of false advertising.

862
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,680
How does that thing react in sunlight?

863
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,680
I don't know.

864
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,680
I haven't played it outside.

865
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,680
Go outside!

866
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,680
Yeah.

867
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,160
There's a whole world out there.

868
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,160
There's air.

869
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,920
I don't have a vitamin D deficiency.

870
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,400
I was outside most of the day today.

871
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,120
I just didn't take my game system with me to go walk around.

872
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,120
Yeah.

873
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,120
See, that was a great thing.

874
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,720
They had somebody like walking around in an urban environment, probably New York City

875
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,280
or something like that, you know, looking down at the screen playing the Vita, waiting

876
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,760
for that guy to get hit by a cab as he crosses the street because some fucking idiot walking

877
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:13,960
around playing a game, you know, looking down, it's just stupid.

878
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,080
I could see myself walking outside, taking a walk around the lake, I just fall right

879
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,080
in.

880
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:25,440
The other thing I do like about the Vita is the fact that you can actually type on the

881
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:34,480
screen, you know, whereas before you did the crazy, you know, pre-touchscreen era analog,

882
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:40,680
you know, yeah, it's not fun to type on the old PSPs, but, uh, Wipeout!

883
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,680
Does PSP have auto-correct?

884
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:48,760
Uh, PSV, excuse me, has suggestions, so you can, you can quickly, uh, tap, so just like

885
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:55,080
PS3 kinda has that, yeah, yeah, um, I do kinda wanna try Wipeout, but I got frustrated the

886
00:44:55,080 --> 00:45:00,400
first Wipeout game, it's just not, not my thing, a little, a little too fast and just

887
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,400
kind of weird.

888
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:07,200
I want a more traditional racing game, I guess, but, uh, we'll see.

889
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,320
And as I mentioned before, Ridge Racer did not make it at launch, it got delayed.

890
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,320
Ooh!

891
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:17,640
Oh, and one other thing, um, of course, Super Stardust Delta is gonna be the free 3G Vita

892
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,200
game that you get at launch.

893
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,920
Not a big surprise since, for, well, pretty much everything up until launch, it was the

894
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:28,160
only 3, only, uh, you know, PlayStation Network download, except they added, you know, the

895
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,760
escape plan stuff now and there's gonna be some other stuff coming out later on.

896
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:39,080
Um, and that is, there's a lot of ifs and ands and, you know, uh, asterisks and stuff

897
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,080
like that.

898
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:47,400
So basically, you need to, um, sign up with AT&T, not necessarily sign up, but you need

899
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:56,560
to activate your 3G, um, and then I believe the way it works is, um, you pay for a month

900
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:05,640
of 3G, so 250 megs, $15, and then you get a free month of 3G, um, and then once you've

901
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:09,520
done that, you also get Super Stardust Delta for free.

902
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:15,840
And I think it also, um, that's so, that's so low in my opinion, it really strikes me

903
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:20,120
as false advertising, because it's like you're not really getting, you know, because on Amazon

904
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:25,020
it said you get, you get a free network game or whatever, but it's not really free.

905
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,460
It's free when you pay for the 3G.

906
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,800
Free when you pay more money.

907
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,960
It's that whole, that's what somebody just criticized me of saying on PlayStation Plus

908
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,960
earlier.

909
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,800
And here's the thing about the 3G too, is they will auto renew, um, you know, if you

910
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:44,200
don't cancel it, so that kind of sucks, um, and oh, oh, and I guess it's Super Stardust

911
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:51,240
Delta plus the Blast Pack DLC for free, yeah, the Blast Pack DLC for Super Stardust Delta,

912
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:57,840
which was a pay to unlock thing, for a download game, a pay to unlock thing, another $8 on

913
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:05,000
top of like, the, what is it, $10 or $15 that that costs, just like, come on.

914
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Yeah.

915
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,640
All right, well, moving on to more Vita news, and this is something that will make Loki

916
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:15,200
very happy, I'm sure, uh, it has been announced that Call of Duty will be coming out on the

917
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,200
Vita this fall.

918
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,200
Duh.

919
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,160
I know, this is really a duh, but it's, it's, because, right, don't, doesn't Call of Duty

920
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:24,760
come out on the frickin' like, Game Boy Color still?

921
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,640
They had it on, they poured it everywhere.

922
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,000
They had it on the DS.

923
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I'm sure they did.

924
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,920
I don't know if there was one, no, there was one last year for Modern Warfare 3 on the

925
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,920
DS.

926
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,680
Of course it's coming out on the Vita, but it is still notable, because obviously this

927
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:42,320
is a huge franchise, and even though it's one I don't usually talk about, it is still

928
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,640
a huge selling franchise.

929
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,680
I think it would be a system seller, to be honest, for the Vita.

930
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,680
You think it's gonna be that good?

931
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,920
You don't think it'll just be a port of another title?

932
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:55,520
Um, it may be a port of, um, I think it's gonna be a port of the game that they're gonna

933
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:00,440
be putting out this year, but, I mean, the games look great on there, and if they can

934
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:03,960
get the controls right, which, I mean, it's got most of the controls of a Playstation

935
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:10,920
3, aside from missing the L3, R3, and, you know, L2, R2, but, um, you can kinda work

936
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,400
that stuff in, you know, with the touch screen, maybe.

937
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,260
Let me get to the exact quote about this release, uh, this is from Vice President Guy Longworth

938
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:20,840
in an interview with Game Trailers, saying, quote, in the autumn, they're really looking

939
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:24,760
forward to Call of Duty on Vita, and we think that's going to be an absolute game changer

940
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,760
for the platform.

941
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,720
Interesting way of phrasing that.

942
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,160
Nice to work in the hashtag in there for their Twitter cam.

943
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,600
I think it's gonna be a game changer.

944
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:38,280
Oh, is that, uh, I didn't realize that was a whole tie-in to some weird marketing thing.

945
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,280
Eh.

946
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,720
But yeah, I think it'll do well.

947
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:45,680
I mean, they'll probably have Call of Duty on the 3DS this year.

948
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:51,480
Well, if it's a unique Vita game with features kinda unique to the system, I'm sure there'll

949
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:56,120
be an audience for it, but I would think it's just gonna be a port, kinda like the DS games

950
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,120
are.

951
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:01,480
The DS games are completely different, I mean, that's really limited as far as the system

952
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,480
goes.

953
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,120
They've had Call of Duty's like really old Call of Duty's on the PSP, but even that was

954
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:09,760
kinda limited because you didn't have a second analog stick and stuff.

955
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,760
This I think is gonna be more along the lines of an actual Call of Duty game, and it would

956
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:18,280
be cool if they had like cross-play with like the PS3 and stuff, you could do that.

957
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:22,820
That could be the game changer right there.

958
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:25,360
Play with the PC and the PS3.

959
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,360
Alright.

960
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:31,000
DarkSakura, what do you got for us in the news?

961
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,600
Sorry, I was describing a bottle of wine.

962
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,560
Talking to liquor with our chatters.

963
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,240
And my windows have frozen.

964
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,760
Oh noes.

965
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,200
Deselect motherfucker.

966
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,200
Stop it.

967
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,520
What kind of laptop should our users not be buying?

968
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,520
Hold on.

969
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,520
Netbook.

970
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,520
Netbook.

971
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,760
I guess there's a difference, huh?

972
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,760
Or is the mouse dying?

973
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,840
No, it's not my mouse.

974
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:01,880
What happens is that it's selected text, and it's not deselecting the text so that I can

975
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,700
get to my other window.

976
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:12,480
So yeah, Capcom had another spelling problem on a, what's the Azure watch?

977
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,480
Is that the game?

978
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,480
Azure's Wrath.

979
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,480
Azure's Wrath.

980
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,480
Azure's Wrath.

981
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,480
Azure's Wrath.

982
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,480
Whatever.

983
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,480
Yeah, it's Chanelgers.

984
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,480
Chanelingers.

985
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,480
Chanlingers.

986
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,480
Chanlingers.

987
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,480
Chanlingers.

988
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:24,480
Chanlingers.

989
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,480
Chanlingers.

990
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,860
It's apparently even more fail than it was before.

991
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,800
So yeah, Capcom's still misspelling words.

992
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:39,040
They really need to get things correct with their, you know, finally I can get to the

993
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,040
damn thing.

994
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,400
Now that you recalled it from memory, yes.

995
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,120
They really need to get their QA really down.

996
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:50,220
Either that or not let the Japanese team do the boxes.

997
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:54,820
Or they need to just invest in Microsoft Word and the little red underline that appears

998
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:57,240
when you spell a word wrong.

999
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,560
Because these aren't done in Word.

1000
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,360
I'm not a designer, but couldn't illustrator or whatever.

1001
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,080
I have the solution to all of Capcom's problems.

1002
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,080
Hire me.

1003
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:10,080
This shit doesn't happen on anything that I make.

1004
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,320
Hire me.

1005
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,400
You should send in a resume.

1006
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,400
P.S.

1007
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,920
I don't screw up on the covers to video games.

1008
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:20,680
You should make a little YouTube and we can try and get it to go viral and send it to

1009
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,680
Capcom.

1010
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,680
Do you want to?

1011
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:23,680
I will help you make one if you want.

1012
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,680
Five.

1013
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,680
All right.

1014
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:26,680
New project for OLR.

1015
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,680
Get Jamie a job.

1016
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,920
Unlike your application for the tester, you need to actually go through with this one.

1017
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:33,480
You need to actually make, well, I didn't make my video for the tester.

1018
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:34,480
That's the only thing I didn't do.

1019
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,840
And it's just like sort of, I was sort of like, I don't want to move.

1020
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,840
It's really it.

1021
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:41,880
It's like, I don't want to go to LA, but I don't like LA.

1022
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:42,880
Capcom's in the Bay, right?

1023
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,880
They have a big office in the Bay.

1024
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:44,880
I think so.

1025
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:45,880
I think they do.

1026
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:46,880
Santa Clara.

1027
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,200
Which I would totally telecommute for that.

1028
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,200
There you go.

1029
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,600
I would absolutely telecommute.

1030
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,600
All right.

1031
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,600
And you, and no spelling mistakes.

1032
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:55,600
No spelling mistakes.

1033
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:59,280
T E L E C O M M U T E.

1034
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,440
If anyone from Capcom is listening, remember the dark soccer is a real bitch when it comes

1035
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,440
to grammar and spelling.

1036
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,440
I am.

1037
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,840
You've heard the mailbag segment on this show.

1038
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,320
She's ruthless.

1039
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,560
I have no Ruth.

1040
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,560
None at all.

1041
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,760
No Ruth anywhere near me.

1042
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,760
Well, let's be honest.

1043
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,080
Most people wouldn't notice that that's misspelled anyways.

1044
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:20,120
Someone had to it for them to have posted it on.

1045
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,120
That's pretty bad.

1046
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,120
You're a gamer.

1047
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:27,280
Some people, but I mean, after reading the many forums out there and the level, the level

1048
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,280
of spelling that is accepted nowadays.

1049
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,280
Chan-linges.

1050
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,720
They don't notice.

1051
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,720
Okay.

1052
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,720
Seriously.

1053
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,720
Oh, it's text speak.

1054
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,720
Chan-linges is text speak.

1055
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,720
No, it's not even that.

1056
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:38,920
It's an extra freaking letter.

1057
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,920
When I get, when I get my Vita next week, I'm going to send Loki a text message that

1058
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,600
says I Chan-linge you to a duel in luminous.

1059
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,600
I spell it.

1060
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,600
Maybe it's a friend's reference.

1061
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,760
Maybe it's a friend's reference.

1062
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:56,480
It's spelled C H A N L L E N G E S. That's an extra N. Someone got crazy typing fingers

1063
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,480
and spelled it wrong.

1064
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,760
And Capcom's like, no one cares for these who maybe they're a fan of Chandler.

1065
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:06,200
And so, you know, but there's no D in there to make it Chandler.

1066
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,880
So your argument is in value is in value is invalid.

1067
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,440
You just got fired from Capcom.

1068
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:15,640
Way to go, listen to me.

1069
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:19,600
First of all, I don't normally speak like this when I am at my job.

1070
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,480
So you can rely on me to be professional.

1071
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,940
Shut up, Rob.

1072
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:32,320
I am a great up and coming designer and I will work for 20 bucks an hour, which is cheaper

1073
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,680
than a lot of designers will charge you.

1074
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,880
I'll work for $19 an hour.

1075
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,280
You can't design shit.

1076
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,280
Okay.

1077
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,280
I can't design shit.

1078
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,360
I can out design anything.

1079
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:44,440
To his credit, he did make O L I N S P dot com, which was pretty kick out.

1080
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:48,240
I mean that, that was, that was something that like other people that weren't even into

1081
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:52,360
video games were looking at us like, wow, this is a great PSP like base.

1082
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,640
Now I can't a very good job.

1083
00:53:54,640 --> 00:54:00,320
Now I can't promise that I will continue to update sites, but I can design it the first

1084
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,320
time.

1085
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,320
Okay.

1086
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,320
What is, what is CMYK?

1087
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:08,600
Here's CMYNK it's cyan, yellow, magenta, black, except you got the wrong order.

1088
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,600
I don't give a crap.

1089
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,480
You asked what it was, what's an ink limit.

1090
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:12,480
Shut up.

1091
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,480
You two both.

1092
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,480
What's that game?

1093
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,480
Okay.

1094
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,360
Here's, here's, I'm just giving you a hard time.

1095
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,320
Here's the difference between Loki, the designer and dark soccer.

1096
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:23,280
The designer Loki is a man in dark soccer as a woman.

1097
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,360
Therefore Loki starts projects and never finishes them.

1098
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,040
Then again, you've started a lot of projects that you don't please.

1099
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,000
Hey, I'm finishing a lot of stuff.

1100
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,680
I've just keep starting something too.

1101
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:38,840
Except my, except I just got paid for my, some of my work, which is, which is good.

1102
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,560
Being paid for doing design is good.

1103
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:45,680
I, it's funny cause I had another idea to start some more projects, but whatever, whatever

1104
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,600
happened to olrwee.com, whatever happened to that.

1105
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:52,080
Brad from Pod Culture says, um, Capcom where spell check doesn't exist.

1106
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:56,440
I'll tell you what happened to that is that no one uses the Wii web browser, so that's

1107
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,960
what happened to that.

1108
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:03,840
And tiger claw people would not get all F's because I would just beat them in the face

1109
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:08,480
and I would, I would expel anybody, I would expel anybody from my class.

1110
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:15,320
It got less than a C. All right, I just wouldn't have class moving on more news, less bickering

1111
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:19,240
Loki and you know, tiger claw, I know that you say that anything with spelling errors

1112
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:24,320
is going to be a collector's item, but not when they're, when you put out there widespread,

1113
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,320
what's also really easy to print fakes.

1114
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:30,840
I would think, I mean somebody like dark soccer could probably spot a fake.

1115
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:36,120
I have, I have to, I have to point out something just for the chat room to clarify.

1116
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,080
Loki's got natural design talent.

1117
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:45,920
If he were, had the schooling to go behind it, he'd be out there making bank.

1118
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:51,560
And I will say this offhand, a lot of talent just needs to know how to use the other software

1119
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,440
that we all have to know how to use.

1120
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,940
Now you want to know what's hilarious.

1121
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:59,920
I have no design talent whatsoever and yet I actually did do design for a short time

1122
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,560
before I was in insurance.

1123
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,720
I'll tell you, I'll tell you this too.

1124
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:04,800
Isn't that ironic?

1125
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:10,400
I um, I just got done, well not just got done, but I read the biography of Joe Simon, who's

1126
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,200
one of the guys that created Captain America and he was talking about back in the day that

1127
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:21,000
it was just natural talent and honing your own talent and he got jobs as designers doing

1128
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:27,980
photo touch ups, you know, in the, you know, depression era, but he, you know, back then

1129
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:29,960
it was all, what's your raw talent?

1130
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,040
Can you do this?

1131
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,420
Do you know how to use the software?

1132
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:35,720
And now it's like, they require so much more education.

1133
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,300
They don't care how well you know how to use everything.

1134
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:41,020
They want you to have the degree that says you know how to use it, which doesn't always

1135
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:42,280
mean you know how to do shit.

1136
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:45,560
Not everybody though, because I will tell you that the publisher I used to work for

1137
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:49,780
was very much, you know what, to me, work experience is very, very valuable.

1138
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:52,720
So you know, I'll just, I'll just say that there are some, tell that to the places I've

1139
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:53,720
been applying at.

1140
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:54,960
Some smart publishers out there.

1141
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,400
Anyhow, um, quickly coming from our chat room, JV Mon in our chat room at chat.onwinsocialmedia.com

1142
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,300
says, ugh, the Wii browser is terra bad.

1143
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,840
It's faster using AOL dial up.

1144
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,840
Yikes.

1145
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:11,880
Well, the problem is like no one's really using that anymore.

1146
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,840
No one's really using the PSP web browser anymore.

1147
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,820
I mean, there's a few people that are, but you're in the minority.

1148
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:22,280
Most everyone's using, you know, some sort of web browser on your phone, on your iPod,

1149
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,820
iPad, something like that.

1150
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:29,200
So to make a site dedicated to like the PSP or even the PlayStation V. And to be honest,

1151
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,500
you don't really need a website dedicated to the PlayStation Vita because hell, I pulled

1152
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,500
up our site on there.

1153
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:35,500
It looks great.

1154
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:40,960
I mean, any website looks great on as long as you don't put flash in there, you know,

1155
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,640
which God, my, my God.

1156
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,640
Okay.

1157
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:48,280
Why can't they put HTML five in a web browser on this stupid device and why can't they do

1158
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,280
that?

1159
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,280
Is it slow?

1160
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,280
Maybe.

1161
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,280
I don't know.

1162
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,480
Slows down memory loss, but it is from what I understand quite a bit more efficient than

1163
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:00,320
flashes lately, unless you're just fully putting full animation in something you don't need

1164
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:03,680
to have, have flash.

1165
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,360
So I don't, I don't get it.

1166
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,640
I can do flash.

1167
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,880
I don't like flash.

1168
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,360
I would rather do it in HTML.

1169
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,520
All right, let's move on Loki.

1170
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,720
All right.

1171
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:17,720
Let's talk a little bit about, um, Nintendo.

1172
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:22,900
And uh, this is kind of neat and see I'm have a few speculations on what this could mean,

1173
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:28,100
but Nintendo has acquired a video research and a kind of like a video middleware company

1174
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:30,480
called Moby Clip.

1175
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:37,640
And Moby Clip, uh, mainly they were kind of focused on, uh, video compression for Game

1176
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,360
Boy Advance DS and 3DS games.

1177
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:44,360
Now what I'm thinking this could be used for is a few things.

1178
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:52,360
Either A, they're gonna, you know, do some more video streaming stuff to the 3DS or B,

1179
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:57,960
it's for working on the Wii U and getting that, you know, video data compressed enough

1180
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:04,360
to where they can stream either a higher resolution or something like that to the Wii U's tablet.

1181
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,360
That's a really good thought.

1182
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:09,440
I was actually going in the direction of those, um, movies on the cartridge, you know, uh,

1183
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,200
for the 3DS because we still don't have the 3D movies.

1184
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:17,680
I'm kind of curious if anyone's picked up Tekken, um, Tekken Prime 3D Edition or whatever,

1185
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:24,240
or Tekken 3D Prime Edition, um, and how that 3D movie looks on the 3DS would be kind of

1186
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,240
interesting.

1187
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,240
I have not.

1188
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,240
Anybody in chat maybe?

1189
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,240
We'll see.

1190
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,240
So.

1191
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:34,760
Um, so, I mean, Nintendo was already working with this company anyway, right?

1192
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:38,200
So this whole acquisition isn't like gonna change the world, right?

1193
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,200
No, it's not.

1194
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,560
It's pro- why would you just bring them in under your wing?

1195
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:44,220
Cause you plan on using them a lot, right?

1196
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:49,200
They have something that you want and that you don't want anyone else to have.

1197
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,920
Like, for example, if you think about it, this company say they, they did find a way

1198
00:59:52,920 --> 01:00:00,880
to a really good algorithm or, you know, some sort of tool that can compress stuff and do

1199
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,600
like high definition video or, you know, really good video.

1200
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:09,000
And for this type of application, they don't want the Vita PS3 having that same technology.

1201
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:14,160
They don't want the PS3 pad or the Xbox, you know, tablet thing or whatever they have.

1202
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,160
If that turns out to be true.

1203
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:16,160
Yeah.

1204
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,320
I mean, they don't want them coming up with something like that and using that kind of

1205
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:19,320
technology.

1206
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,440
For example, same thing with the Kinect.

1207
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:25,480
Remember that company that developed the Kinect, Microsoft bought them because they don't want

1208
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,120
anyone else developing their own Kinect.

1209
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,120
Oh, that's true.

1210
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,120
Okay.

1211
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,120
That makes sense.

1212
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,120
Yeah.

1213
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,120
So maybe, maybe they cracked the case.

1214
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,120
Who knows?

1215
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,560
But this, this acquisition actually happened a while ago.

1216
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,560
We're just now seeing the papers filed on it.

1217
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:37,560
Yes.

1218
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:38,560
That makes it complete.

1219
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,560
It was back in October.

1220
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:40,560
Interesting.

1221
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:41,560
All right.

1222
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:44,840
So for that gamer, I have some news for you, both of you out there.

1223
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:45,840
No, I'm just kidding.

1224
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:46,840
I'm kidding.

1225
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:47,840
Don't send the hate mail in.

1226
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:53,520
Uh, there is some new gaming related stuff coming to OS X Mountain Lion in the way of

1227
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,520
Game Center.

1228
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:58,960
Uh, Game Center is kind of, I don't know, not really there.

1229
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,000
I mean, yes, it's on the iPhone.

1230
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,440
You have achievements or what do they call it?

1231
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,680
Is it just achievements on the iPhone Game Center, iOS?

1232
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:10,580
I can't remember, but you do have those, you know, things that you can earn on there and

1233
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:13,160
kind of see what your friends are playing and all that, but it doesn't really do that

1234
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,280
much else.

1235
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:19,160
But it is coming, uh, to OS X, uh, with the Mountain Lion update.

1236
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:23,280
Uh, apparently it will add some new stuff though.

1237
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:27,520
I didn't even know this was in there, but voice chat will make its way.

1238
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:31,320
I didn't think that was already in Game Center, but some are saying it is.

1239
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:32,320
I didn't think voice chat was.

1240
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,320
I don't think so.

1241
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,960
I thought, I didn't know that was there.

1242
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,480
But it would make, it would make sense if it can kind of interface with the Mac that

1243
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:39,480
way.

1244
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:42,200
I don't see where they're, why they're doing that because they're trying to, you know,

1245
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:45,600
tie in the stuff that's popular on iOS devices into the Mac.

1246
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:51,520
Just like say FaceTime, you know, one of the, uh, hideously underused feature of the iOS

1247
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,520
device.

1248
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:53,520
That's awesome.

1249
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:59,600
Uh, but you can, you know, kind of cross do that between the iPhone, iPad and the Mac.

1250
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:03,800
I think the only reason why people don't use FaceTime is because they're Skype and people

1251
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,680
use Skype a lot more.

1252
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,680
On the computer.

1253
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:07,680
Yeah.

1254
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:08,680
But I like having a phone.

1255
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,640
There's only only one person that ever Skypes with me.

1256
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:14,200
I have a friend in the Bay Area and once in a while she buys something really funny that

1257
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,880
she wants to like literally show me, so she'll FaceTime me.

1258
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,820
But otherwise I think FaceTime's biggest drawback is that it doesn't work on 3G.

1259
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,820
I know there's competitors out there that do work on 3G.

1260
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:27,160
I'm aware of that, but Intel Apple kind of officially endorses it.

1261
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,960
Um, I think that's one of its biggest kind of drawbacks and maybe they're worried about

1262
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:31,960
the quality.

1263
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:32,960
I don't know, but you're right.

1264
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,840
Skype will do 3G, but Skype isn't integrated into the fricking phone.

1265
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,880
You have to download it separately and not everybody does that.

1266
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:43,960
You can do it on 3G, but you have to have it jailbroken before you can do that.

1267
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:47,440
So well, again, not something that's integrated into it normally.

1268
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,440
Yeah.

1269
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:52,600
So, uh, Black Wolf in our chat room, of course, the man before us at All Games Radio says

1270
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:57,320
there are voice chat APIs available to iOS developers as part of game kit.

1271
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:00,760
Not many people implement it though, so I guess, I guess, I don't know.

1272
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:03,040
It's just not the same type of gaming on the iPhone.

1273
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:06,200
Like who would you talk to playing Angry Birds?

1274
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,640
Well, Angry Birds isn't really-

1275
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,080
I talk to Angry Birds.

1276
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,080
I could think maybe-

1277
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:11,920
I go, I hate this game!

1278
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,920
Every time I play it, so.

1279
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:18,660
There's a lot of games though, I don't think there's a lot that you play at the same time.

1280
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:23,080
Like Words With Friends and stuff like that, it's usually, okay, I'm gonna do my move now

1281
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:25,080
and that's it.

1282
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:26,600
You just kind of play it on your own time.

1283
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:30,400
It's not like, okay, hey, pop out your phone right now, we're gonna play a game of whatever,

1284
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,400
you know?

1285
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,400
Right, right.

1286
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,640
Alright, let's move on.

1287
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:37,680
Three states coming up very soon after one more story, DarkSakura.

1288
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:38,680
Mantis.

1289
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,960
Sorry, that's not the story.

1290
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:41,960
No.

1291
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:46,320
I just found something that was more, that was worse than the frilly dog panties.

1292
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,320
Mantis.

1293
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,320
Dear God.

1294
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:49,320
What?

1295
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,320
Mantis are worse than frilly dog panties.

1296
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:53,000
We've had this discussion on the show before and I don't want to have it again.

1297
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,600
So how about something that has absolutely nothing to do with mantis?

1298
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:57,600
Please.

1299
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,600
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!

1300
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:00,600
Yay!

1301
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:04,720
Heroes and a Manti.

1302
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,760
Now I'm picturing Michelangelo and a Manti.

1303
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:07,760
Don't picture that.

1304
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,440
I'm gonna have to draw that.

1305
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,440
No!

1306
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:12,960
No, you don't draw that.

1307
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:15,520
This is not deviant art.

1308
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,280
This isn't 4chan.

1309
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:18,280
That would be hilarious.

1310
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:22,940
Anyway, um, it was actually spotted by Ninja Pizza.

1311
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:29,400
There was a poster that was displayed at Toy Fair 2012 that showed a list of activity around

1312
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:34,720
the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon series and at the bottom it says cross promotions

1313
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:40,720
with key licenses including IDW comic book publisher and Activision.

1314
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:46,640
So it could possibly be that Activision is doing a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game.

1315
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,280
Who knows?

1316
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:52,400
They haven't been attached with them before but maybe they will.

1317
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:56,520
I like the last one that came up was that horrible Wii game.

1318
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:58,080
And Ubisoft do that or something?

1319
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:00,040
Yeah, it was another company had it at the time.

1320
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:03,800
Yeah, it was published by Ubisoft and then before that was Konami.

1321
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,200
Well technically there was two Wii games.

1322
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:09,160
There was one for the movie, the TMNT thing, then there was also the one that was like

1323
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,160
Smash Brothers.

1324
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:13,920
Yeah, I'm talking about Smash Up.

1325
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:17,260
You know how many times that they freaking rebooted the Ninja Turtles?

1326
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:18,260
You know what I want them to do?

1327
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:19,260
Huh?

1328
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:21,880
I want them to go back to the original Ninja Turtles, you know, the ones that were all

1329
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:27,560
black and white or the only color they wore was red, and do like a big RPG based off the

1330
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:28,560
original Turtles.

1331
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,700
I want a music game with the Ninja Rap.

1332
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:34,680
Go Ninja, go Ninja, go.

1333
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,440
Come on, it'd be awesome.

1334
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:40,840
I had, okay, this, honestly, I had no idea they were doing yet another new cartoon.

1335
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,280
Like, I was like, really?

1336
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:43,280
There's another one?

1337
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:47,560
Well, like, the last one that I remembered watching, they had done, okay, they had done

1338
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:52,200
like the one that was on in the late 80s and early 90s that, you know, I was watching as

1339
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,500
a young teenager and my brothers were watching as kids.

1340
01:05:55,500 --> 01:06:00,160
And then they did another one for a while that was supposed to be pretty much a little

1341
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,560
bit, you know, a little bit more on the hardcore side.

1342
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:06,720
And then, um, the last thing that I watched actually was from that series where they went

1343
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:13,720
back into their other universes, and they went back with the original Turtle universe,

1344
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,600
and they were all like, you guys are bitches.

1345
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,840
So this is all CGI, it looks like, Tiger Claw Link.

1346
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,880
It doesn't look like very good CGI either.

1347
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,020
Was that like Dun and Poser?

1348
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:24,020
You know what, though?

1349
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:29,200
This, um, could, this looks like it could be easily be a video game.

1350
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:32,940
With the technology we have today, I could be looking at screenshots from a video game.

1351
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:34,400
I would not know the difference.

1352
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,400
To be real.

1353
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:40,480
That looks like really, I hope those are just preliminary shots because those textures are

1354
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:41,480
just horrendous.

1355
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:45,440
Maybe it's, well, keep in mind, I think these are pictures of posters, so you're probably

1356
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:46,440
losing some detail.

1357
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,760
I don't think I'm losing anything.

1358
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:54,480
But, um, maybe it's all Mashima is what it comes down to.

1359
01:06:54,480 --> 01:07:01,560
Well at any rate, at any rate, you know, I've, it better be, I just really don't have a whole

1360
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:04,640
lot of faith in it being much better.

1361
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:10,320
Well, um, one interesting kind of tie in, because you were talking about kind of the

1362
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:14,560
license through the days and how Konami had it and, you know, I guess Ubisoft may not

1363
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:21,200
have it now looking at this story, but, um, the eight bit Ninja Turtle game that's on

1364
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:24,640
virtual console right now is getting pulled or got pulled.

1365
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:28,080
I think it's getting pulled soon because it sucks.

1366
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:31,680
I like the original game, but that's, I like the arcade game.

1367
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,520
That's one of those games I see through rose colored glasses.

1368
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,200
It was awesome when you're nine, but now it's probably crap.

1369
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,200
Okay.

1370
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,200
Do the water level without cursing.

1371
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:41,200
You know what I'm talking about?

1372
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:47,320
Rocket seaweed, but that game is no longer going to be on virtual console.

1373
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,320
Good.

1374
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:51,760
You know, actually, you know, it's funny, you know what virtual console did get this

1375
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:52,760
week?

1376
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:56,660
Finally, finally, after years and years, it's like the first virtual console game to come

1377
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:58,240
out in like nine months.

1378
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,360
You know what game they got Genesis game?

1379
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:02,360
Strider.

1380
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:03,360
Yes, that's right.

1381
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:07,340
Cause Dan was talking about it and I'm like, you don't need another version of Strider.

1382
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:10,240
You really don't need another version of Strider.

1383
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,880
You already have that version of Strider.

1384
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,280
We do have that version of Strider.

1385
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:14,840
I have beaten that version of Strider.

1386
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,320
I have not beaten it in the arcade, but I've beaten the Genesis one.

1387
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:20,280
All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and what's coming

1388
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:21,800
out to a game store near you.

1389
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:25,560
Gee, I wonder, I wonder what could be dominating the US releases this week.

1390
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:26,560
Loki.

1391
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,680
Not as many as you would think because most of them will last week.

1392
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:37,600
So now this week we've got a Metal Gear Solid 3D Snake Eater on the 3DS of course.

1393
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:43,680
We've got Shinobido to Revenge of Zen, which is basically by the guys that do Tenchu.

1394
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,120
And that's on the Vita.

1395
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:48,680
Touch My Katamari on the Vita this week as well.

1396
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:52,240
Prevolution Soccer 2012 on the 3DS.

1397
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:57,240
Syndicate on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

1398
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:01,680
Asura's Wrath on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.

1399
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,080
Some more Vita titles.

1400
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:06,280
Army Corps of Hell on the Vita.

1401
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:12,320
Dynasty Warriors Next, Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus on the Vita, of course the Vita system.

1402
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:17,400
Both the 3G and the Wi-Fi only version are launching this week as well.

1403
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:23,960
Poke Park 2 on the Wii and that's it.

1404
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:27,200
All right then let's look at Japan and some of the games coming out in Japan this week.

1405
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,360
On the Xbox 360, Asura's Wrath.

1406
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:33,600
Now no telling if the spelling is wrong in Japanese as well, but it's coming out there

1407
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,280
so you can let us know.

1408
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:38,000
Entaku no Saito, Students of Round.

1409
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,040
I think that's a price reduction on an existing game.

1410
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:46,320
Naruto Shippuden, Narutamite Storm Generation comes out on the 360 this week as well as

1411
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:49,840
Darkness 2, and Under Defeat HD.

1412
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:53,760
I haven't heard of Under Defeat, it looks like a helicopter game, so kind of like a

1413
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:56,200
shooter game on the 360.

1414
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:59,260
Going over to the Playstation 3 and checking out what's coming out there.

1415
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:03,800
Some of the same stuff, Asura's Wrath there as well, Naruto Shippuden, but some other

1416
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:09,400
different games, Galgun comes out in regular and limited flavors this week on the Playstation

1417
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,200
3.

1418
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:17,520
This is the whole, I think shooting pheromones gun, yeah isn't this the whole like making

1419
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,320
teenage girls fall in love with you by, I think you're fighting them off or something

1420
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:25,580
I don't really know what the storyline was but it was it's an on-rails shooter game that

1421
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:31,080
uses the Playstation Move controller, let's just say it's not coming out here in the States.

1422
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:37,720
But thanks to the region free ability of the Playstation 3, it can be yours if you so wish.

1423
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:43,520
Alright, let's see also, totally importing, Fight Night Champion getting a prize reduction.

1424
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:47,760
It's actually not that bad of a game, I like the Xbox 360 one, I thought it was fun.

1425
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:53,800
Shinken de Watashi no Koi Shinasi R comes out this week on the Playstation 3.

1426
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:57,560
This is labeled as an adventure game, it looks like yet another one of those games that's

1427
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:02,920
heavy on the dialogue and kind of like simulator games.

1428
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:06,240
But it doesn't look like a dating game, it looks like kind of something else, but I don't

1429
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:11,200
see any like action screenshots, just all like talking and anime clip scenes and all

1430
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,200
that.

1431
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,200
So these...

1432
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,200
And leaning over with a big bust.

1433
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,440
Yes, of course, of course.

1434
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:18,760
Gotta emphasize dem boobies.

1435
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,880
Lots of stuff on the Playstation 3 this week.

1436
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:29,680
Shadow Master, volume 5, Under Defeat, also on the PS3, Darkness 2, and Tachishio Love

1437
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:32,040
Application.

1438
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:35,240
I'll just let you decide what that game's all about.

1439
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:37,320
Applicate your love.

1440
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:42,360
On the Vita this week in Japan, At Field, Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus, and Little Busters

1441
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:50,200
Converted Edition come out on the Playstation Vita this week, and quickly checking the 3DS.

1442
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:56,200
Bokuju Monogatari Hajimari no Daichi comes out this week from Marvelous on the 3DS.

1443
01:11:56,200 --> 01:12:01,040
I'm trying to see if this is a version of a game we have here.

1444
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,760
It looks kind of...

1445
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:09,840
God damn it, what's that farming game from Natsume?

1446
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:10,840
Harvest Moon?

1447
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:14,120
It looks Harvest Moon-y to me, because look, they're growing eggplants there and they're

1448
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:15,120
harvesting chickens.

1449
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,360
It's not Harvest Moon, but it's like a 3D version of that.

1450
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:18,360
There's no cows.

1451
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,160
Yeah, well, she's wearing a cow hat.

1452
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:23,800
Nope, there's a cow right there, a cute little fat-ass cow right there.

1453
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:24,800
Any sheep?

1454
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:25,800
And a sheep.

1455
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:26,800
Okay.

1456
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:27,800
That is Harvest Moon.

1457
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:33,280
This is like a Zynga-type Harvest Moon game coming out in Japan.

1458
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,280
There you go.

1459
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:35,280
That's it for Japanese.

1460
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,080
It's not Harvest Moon, it's Harvest Noon.

1461
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:39,280
You're saying it's Farmville then.

1462
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,680
Basically, yeah, it's Farmville instead of Farmtown.

1463
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:46,960
All right, anyhow, moving on, Dark Sakura, how about Across the Pond?

1464
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:50,360
Just assume this is Vita, unless I say differently, okay?

1465
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:51,360
Yes.

1466
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:52,360
This is on the 22nd.

1467
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:56,000
Army Corps of Hell, BlazBlue Continuum, Shift Extend, Dynasty Warriors.

1468
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:03,600
Next, Escape Plan, Everybody's Goth, Gravity Rush, Hustle Kings, Little Deviants, Luminous

1469
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:09,120
Electronic Symphony, ModRation Nature's... ModNation Rager's...

1470
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,400
Back, back, back, back up, back up.

1471
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,400
Did you say a game called Everybody's Goth?

1472
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,400
Goth?

1473
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:15,440
Oh, I thought she said Everybody's Goth.

1474
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,920
I'm like, is this 1994?

1475
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:26,360
Today on Goth Talk, we'll explore, has Hot Topic deceived us?

1476
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,420
Have they abandoned us?

1477
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:33,040
With always my co-host, Azraelibus Prince of Sorrow.

1478
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:36,240
You know, I know it sounds like we're making fun, but seriously, that was my crowd in high

1479
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:37,240
school, so whatever.

1480
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:38,240
Yeah, same here.

1481
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:45,640
ModNation Racer's Road Trip, MotorStormRC, Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus, the Vita itself,

1482
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:53,520
Reality Fighters, Shinobido II, Revenge of Zen, oh, Shinobido, sorry, I was reading it

1483
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:54,520
wrong.

1484
01:13:54,520 --> 01:14:00,800
Super Stardust Delta, Top Darts, Touch My Katamari Baby, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom

1485
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:06,600
3, Uncharted Golden Abyss, Virtual Tennis 4, Wipeout 2048, and on the 24th, we have

1486
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:13,960
Binary Domain on the 360 and PS3, and Hyperdimension Neptunia MK2 on PS3, Syndicate on the Xbox

1487
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:16,840
360 and Playstation 3, The Last Story on Wii.

1488
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:20,640
I'm surprised that they're getting Gravity Rush so early.

1489
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:26,080
I may have to import that, if it's in English, which I would assume it is.

1490
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,080
Mayhaps it may be.

1491
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,000
Because it's not coming out over here until May.

1492
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:34,620
Same day as Resistance, too, so that's a tough one.

1493
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:39,640
By the way, completely off the record, well, not off, but having nothing to do with this,

1494
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:44,200
I've decided to play through Mother 3, because I hate my life and I want to cry.

1495
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,200
Have fun with that.

1496
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:46,200
It's depressing.

1497
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:48,360
Well, maybe you should be playing everybody's goth then.

1498
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:53,040
I'm trying to imagine how that game would play.

1499
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:56,280
You go around trying to convert the jocks and the cheerleaders.

1500
01:14:56,280 --> 01:15:00,320
No, you go around trying to avoid the jocks and the cheerleaders.

1501
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:02,760
With your goth gun.

1502
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:05,560
And yes, it fires bats.

1503
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:14,680
And you have to raise the depression level of everyone around you, but maintaining that

1504
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:18,300
you have a higher depression level than the rest of them, and being tragic.

1505
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:22,760
And you get a cure bar, which basically will allow you to blast Robert Smith for a certain

1506
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:26,040
amount of time, that will weaken the enemies.

1507
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:30,360
At full blast, you play Fascination Street, you know, when it's very low, it plays Friday

1508
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,520
I'm in Love.

1509
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:36,200
You might get, like, there might be DLC that will change it to the Smiths, you know, or

1510
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,200
something like that.

1511
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,200
Yeah, that's what you do.

1512
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,200
It should progress.

1513
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:41,420
Like, the Smiths would be the ultimate in depression.

1514
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:44,760
Or no, eventually you get to Bauhaus level.

1515
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:47,320
Bella Lugosi is down.

1516
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:51,440
Loki, save us.

1517
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:56,980
So Sony, seeing that they have a great storyline in the Twisted Metal series, they are going

1518
01:15:56,980 --> 01:16:03,000
to be, or they have begun preparations for a Twisted Metal movie, which I gotta say,

1519
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,120
that sounds pretty awesome.

1520
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:06,400
Unfortunately it's probably getting pretty lame.

1521
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:10,000
But you know, they kind of started that off a little early with the new Twisted Metal

1522
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:15,520
game having live action cut scenes, and of course they're expecting to have the same

1523
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:22,980
characters from the last Twisted Metal game in this actual movie as well, so neat.

1524
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:30,560
It's being developed by, looks like Avi and Ari Arad, who I guess have worked with the

1525
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:42,140
Spider-Man series, and yeah, and I guess they signed a deal with the writer and director

1526
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:50,440
Brian Taylor, who he did the Crank movies, Jonah Hex, and the last Ghost Rider flick.

1527
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:53,080
Well, that doesn't sound like it's gonna suck at all.

1528
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:55,880
Well, at least we know he knows how to crash cars.

1529
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,000
So he is good at crashing cars.

1530
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,760
He's a car crashing expert.

1531
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:05,760
It's too bad David Carradine didn't live long enough to see this.

1532
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,400
That is too bad.

1533
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,800
But he did live long enough for Kill Bill.

1534
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:14,720
But hey, you know what, and I understand that he may not necessarily be part of the lore

1535
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:17,860
for Twisted Metal.

1536
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:23,040
There is still Sylvester Stallone, and he could probably come back as Machine Gun Joe.

1537
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,040
That's true.

1538
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:25,040
What's he doing these days?

1539
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,040
Is he Expendables?

1540
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,040
Expendables 2.

1541
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:28,040
Whoopee!

1542
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:29,040
Well, actually, no, he has quite a few movies.

1543
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:33,680
He has Expendables 2, he has two more movies with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

1544
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:37,740
That's right, Arnold's gone back to acting.

1545
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:41,560
He needs to go back to exercising, too, because, whoa!

1546
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:47,480
I mean, that's pretty wrong of me saying that, but, you know, that's insane.

1547
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:48,480
No, right?

1548
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:54,120
Here he was, we've got the man who was elected by Ronald Reagan to be our, you know, the

1549
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:58,880
person we attain, you know, we looked for as a role model for fitness, who was, what

1550
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:02,400
was it, the president's fitness shit thing?

1551
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,400
I'm not gonna lie, though.

1552
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:07,720
If I'm that fit at that age, I'll be happy.

1553
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:09,920
There's a very easy way for you to get that fit.

1554
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,200
Stop eating that.

1555
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:12,200
No.

1556
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:13,840
It comes in a needle.

1557
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,720
It comes with a needle in a little glass.

1558
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:16,720
Oh, no.

1559
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:17,720
Steroids.

1560
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:19,880
Because that's how he did it.

1561
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:21,880
Crack his wack, yo.

1562
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:24,920
Oh, I see those receipts.

1563
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:26,600
I don't believe it.

1564
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:30,360
Don't make me get out the Whitney Houston interview, so I might say it's in bad taste.

1565
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:36,880
All right, um, actually, I gotta say, I have, I have, I've become a lot more active lately.

1566
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:37,880
I really have.

1567
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:40,040
I mean, this is only within, like, the past, like, week and a half, so, you know, it's

1568
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:42,840
not really a habit yet, which is why I haven't been talking about it a lot, but there's two

1569
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,440
things to credit with it.

1570
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,720
One of them would be the site Fitocracy.

1571
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:48,680
I don't know how many of you guys know about this website, but-

1572
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:49,680
I signed up for it.

1573
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:54,080
It helps you kind of like, it turns tracking your fitness into a role-playing game with,

1574
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:58,560
like, achievements and everything, and, you know, obviously, a lot of it is on your honor,

1575
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:02,240
you know, because sure, I could sit, put in there and say, I did 100 sit-ups today, but,

1576
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:06,200
you know, if you didn't do it, then you're only, you're losing, so, you know, it's kind

1577
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:12,720
of helped motivate you and so forth, and I gotta say, as crazy as this sounds, and I,

1578
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:18,400
I know I'll get called sell-out or whatever, but Rhythm Party got me up and moving and

1579
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:24,160
remembering how good it feels to play DER for 30 minutes, again, and I really do credit

1580
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:25,760
Rhythm Party, which had DLC this week.

1581
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:28,760
I don't even think that comes, comes up in our show tonight, so I'll say it now.

1582
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:31,240
They finally put out DLC for Rhythm Party this week.

1583
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:38,200
The downside is it's all Konami originals, but the upside is, oh my god, the collaborations

1584
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,840
are hilarious.

1585
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,800
Do you know who Naoki collaborated with this time?

1586
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:43,800
Tiffany.

1587
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:44,800
Awesome.

1588
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,800
Where does he?

1589
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:53,760
I know, and then one of the songs has, um, who are, who are the, the, the sister sledge?

1590
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:54,760
You remember sister sledge?

1591
01:19:54,760 --> 01:20:00,560
We are family, the, the oldest sister sledge, the one that was the vocalist, is in another

1592
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:01,560
collaboration.

1593
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:07,680
Like, it's all these, like, washed up fucking 80s and 70s vocalists are now in DDR, or Rhythm

1594
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:14,720
Party, excuse me, songs, but unfortunately, Rhythm Party's weakest thing is like, okay,

1595
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:21,640
it's got Born This Way by Gaga and nothing else contemporary.

1596
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:24,840
I'm sorry, Bobby Brown is not contemporary.

1597
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,080
More contemporary now though.

1598
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:31,840
It is now, by sheer luck, but it was not supposed to be contemporary.

1599
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,840
Um, the songs are decent though.

1600
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,840
I wasn't, the songs are surprisingly decent.

1601
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,840
You know, they're not.

1602
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:38,880
I, I enjoy it more than Dance Masters.

1603
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:39,880
I will stand by that.

1604
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:40,880
It's a, it's a way better.

1605
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:43,000
Dance Masters theme happens to be part of that.

1606
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,120
Yeah, that wasn't a download pack too.

1607
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,120
So anyhow, sorry.

1608
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,120
See the thing.

1609
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:50,040
I didn't mean to get on a tangent, but like I have been on a fitness kick lately.

1610
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:51,040
See the thing with nice.

1611
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:55,520
The thing with me though is I don't like really allocate myself that much time because you

1612
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:59,320
know, when I get home from work, I got to watch the, you know, my son until he goes

1613
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:00,320
to bed at eight.

1614
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:06,720
So I have a short window between eight o'clock and 11 p.m. to have dinner, relax for a little

1615
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:07,720
bit.

1616
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:09,080
It's like, okay, where am I going to fit fitness in there?

1617
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:12,240
Yes, I could do it, but then again at the same time, that's the only free time I have

1618
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:13,240
all day.

1619
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:14,360
I got to fit in games in there.

1620
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:18,000
I'm going to fit and working on stuff I want to work on, you know, and I understand it's

1621
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,780
just, I don't prioritize it enough.

1622
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:21,320
I'll throw this out there.

1623
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:26,160
Um, I, I, it may not work for your situation, but one like kind of goal I made is that I

1624
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:29,800
try to walk a mile every day and I do that on my breaks at work.

1625
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:33,780
I do it on my break and I have an application on my phone called Runkeeper that helps me

1626
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:36,820
and it funny, Runkeeper ties into Fitocracy.

1627
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:41,840
So every time I walk it will say on my Fitocracy, you walked 1.2 miles today.

1628
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,000
And so I do that on my break.

1629
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,720
I mean that's, that's what I've been trying to do.

1630
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:52,000
Well, I'll tell you too, um, when I, cause keep in mind, I was up there a few years ago

1631
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,900
and that's how I lost all of my weight was by cutting down, way down on sugar and walking

1632
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:59,260
every day at work during my lunch break.

1633
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:03,760
And that was when I was working off of downtown, off of Alhambra and walking around the house.

1634
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:06,000
That big park twice.

1635
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,120
So yeah, I don't know how, but I ballooned up at the end of last year, so I'm trying

1636
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:11,120
to lose it.

1637
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:12,120
Yoga.

1638
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,920
And I'm actually planning on getting the connect yoga.

1639
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:19,360
I started taking yoga twice a week and now I do it every day and I have noticed, um,

1640
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:23,700
well, I'm, I'm not going to actually say the number or anything, but I've, since I've started

1641
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:30,320
taking yoga and cut out all bread, I am now down seven pounds from when I started.

1642
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,920
So congrats.

1643
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:35,880
So yeah, just making little changes and incorporating some activity into your life is amazing.

1644
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:39,000
You'll, you'll, you'll find a place to squeeze it in.

1645
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:43,320
You know, I would love to, I had lift weights, do sit up, do 25 sit ups before you go to

1646
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:44,320
bed.

1647
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:45,320
Well, not before you go to bed.

1648
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:46,320
Cause then you'll be up all night.

1649
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,040
Do 25 sit ups right when you get home.

1650
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:50,920
I've seriously thought about building new DDR pads.

1651
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:54,720
I have sheet metal in my garage dedicated.

1652
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:58,880
I can't because of the proximity to my son's room, it would be too loud.

1653
01:22:58,880 --> 01:22:59,880
Yeah.

1654
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:00,880
All right, well moving on.

1655
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:02,480
Let's get back into a video game talk.

1656
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:05,480
I want to do a follow up to something we were talking about last week, which was the double

1657
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:08,100
fine funding that happened through Kickstarter.

1658
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:09,520
They're going to break 2 million.

1659
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:12,440
I mean there's still 22 days left on that thing and I just checked it earlier today.

1660
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:13,800
It was at 1.9 million.

1661
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:16,960
So they're going to easily break 2 million, maybe make two and a half.

1662
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:17,960
I don't know.

1663
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:22,000
Uh, but double fine did, uh, kind of put out their first video that, you know, obviously

1664
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,440
thanks everybody and so forth and talks about what's going to happen because remember a

1665
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:30,200
big part of donating to this was that they were going to make the process transparent.

1666
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,100
You know, a lot of game companies don't do this.

1667
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:33,100
They need secrecy.

1668
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:37,640
They don't unveil things till E3, everything is kind of done in a bubble, but this whole,

1669
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:40,800
you know, part that, you know, they're trying to appeal to the masses is we're going to

1670
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:44,320
have this whole process be transparent and they've already announced that there will

1671
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:51,680
be a DRM free, uh, game that will be released on the PC, Mac and Linux when it launches.

1672
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:55,320
Uh, there will be a closed beta that's going to happen on steam.

1673
01:23:55,320 --> 01:24:00,280
Um, and now Tim Schafer said in an interview that went up on YouTube that because they

1674
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:05,400
got more money, uh, they're going to also do it on iOS and certain types of Android

1675
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:06,400
phones.

1676
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,320
So they're going to kind of expand to those platforms.

1677
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:11,960
But it is important to note if you donate it to the project, you won't be able to get

1678
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:17,960
the iOS and Android versions free because of the limitations of those types of distributions.

1679
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:23,640
Um, from what I remember of the Apple store, you can get a finite number of codes to give

1680
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:24,780
away your product.

1681
01:24:24,780 --> 01:24:28,440
Like it's gotta be a hundred or less, maybe even like 50 or 20.

1682
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:33,240
But um, like, you know, with 30,000 people donating to this and counting, I think it's

1683
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:38,600
even more, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm just reading off the lowest tier even, um, they can't generate

1684
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,040
that kind of codes on iOS.

1685
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:45,600
So your, your free one that you get for donating will be the PC, Mac or Linux version.

1686
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:51,240
But there will also be now this iOS and Linux one, uh, nothing about consoles yet.

1687
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:52,240
So there you go.

1688
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:53,240
Kind of the first update.

1689
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:55,640
You'll probably see more of this as it gets developed.

1690
01:24:55,640 --> 01:25:00,320
That'd be funny if they put that on indie games.

1691
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:01,320
I guess they could.

1692
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:02,320
Yeah.

1693
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:06,240
File size is usually the only thing that's holding it back, but, um.

1694
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:07,240
You never know though.

1695
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:10,560
I mean, Xbox, Xbox is known for making exceptions.

1696
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:12,040
So a high profile thing like this.

1697
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,760
They'd probably put that Xbox library in.

1698
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:14,760
Yeah.

1699
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:15,760
Might as well.

1700
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:16,760
Right.

1701
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:17,760
Yeah.

1702
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:20,800
So, all right, well, let's take a moment to walk down the halls of gaming's history.

1703
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:21,800
You know, there was a time.

1704
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,920
We didn't know anything.

1705
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:28,360
The only stuff we knew about video games was what we read in Nintendo power or electronic

1706
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:29,480
gaming monthly.

1707
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:30,880
That's what we got to see development.

1708
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,040
We didn't have the internet.

1709
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:33,040
It looked like DOS.

1710
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:34,560
It was called AOL.

1711
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:35,560
That's right.

1712
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:36,560
Or 1.0.

1713
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:39,920
Back in my day it was quantum link on the Commodore 64.

1714
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:40,920
We had beep.

1715
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:41,920
Yes.

1716
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:42,920
I had Prodigy.

1717
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:46,120
Oh, you know, we call it what the AOL users called it, at least in my group, Buttigy.

1718
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:47,120
We really called it.

1719
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:48,120
Hey, hey.

1720
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:49,120
And CompuSuck.

1721
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:53,680
Prodigy was fucking awesome on the old PCs because of the graphics and everything.

1722
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:57,680
Anyway, I was just very, I was very loyal to Prodigy for a long time.

1723
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:00,560
I remember my old sign in, but anyway, we won't go there.

1724
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,920
We'll go to the classic game of the week.

1725
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:07,240
Dark Sakura is going to jump in the gaming vault and pick out one game she thinks, hey,

1726
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:08,320
play it.

1727
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:11,760
It is Rainbow Islands, the story of Bubble Bobble 2.

1728
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,280
You've been on a bobble kick lately.

1729
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:15,880
Well, I was inspired.

1730
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:20,280
But any, and actually the music that I linked is probably one of the best home versions

1731
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:21,520
ever.

1732
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:25,800
This one is the PC Engine version, which is pretty much Arcade Perfect.

1733
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:29,760
Anyway, Rainbow Islands came out in 1987.

1734
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,680
It was by Taito.

1735
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:36,280
And it was a sequel to, as it says, Bubble Bobble.

1736
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:42,440
And the game, it was actually the second in the series.

1737
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:45,960
It was followed by Bubble Symphony and Bubble Memories.

1738
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:51,480
But it has two sequels, Parasol Stars and Bubble Bobble Part 2.

1739
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:53,640
So it's come out on like, darn your everything.

1740
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:54,960
It's kind of messed up.

1741
01:26:54,960 --> 01:27:00,020
But the way that you get through that is you have to, you're on an island that you have

1742
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:02,880
to throw rainbows around to get to different platforms.

1743
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:08,760
And you can use the rainbows to shoot things, but they will eventually break down.

1744
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:15,760
You've also got this thing called the Hidden Depths, where it actually has a bunch of different

1745
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:19,840
secrets that you can find, like different levels and power ups and different riddles.

1746
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:25,400
And so it makes it, you can beat the game so many different ways.

1747
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:30,320
It also has a scoring system that has its own secrets too, so you can get different

1748
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:33,640
high scores by finding all the different stuff.

1749
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:38,600
So as I said, it's set on islands, ten of them, and they each have their different theme.

1750
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:43,080
And you basically move, you know, to the next island in the chain by, you know, going around

1751
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:44,080
and passing the levels.

1752
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:45,960
And they get progressively more difficult.

1753
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:50,720
You have faster enemies, and you can also go on a large map screen where you can see

1754
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:52,280
all the different islands.

1755
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:56,640
There are three secret islands that are not visible until the seven big diamonds are collected,

1756
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:58,840
which are hidden throughout the game.

1757
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,720
And actually, most home versions lack the secret islands.

1758
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:06,440
So you can release these rainbows, and they're weapons and platforms.

1759
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:11,320
And when you jump on them, they fall down and hit the enemies below it.

1760
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:16,760
And different power ups can make you go faster, increase the speed of the rainbows, and let

1761
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:18,760
you spawn, I believe, up to three rainbows.

1762
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:20,760
Isn't that right, Rob?

1763
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:21,760
Yes.

1764
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:24,040
I think it was three was the max you could get.

1765
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:26,880
Just so you guys know, I love this game.

1766
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:30,960
Like I used to play this at Roseville Golf Land in between while waiting for DDR, because

1767
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:33,080
that was back when Ultracade was cool.

1768
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:36,020
And I used to play this in the Ultracade machine all the time.

1769
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:39,440
And people were like, what is that very homosexual game you are playing where you are literally

1770
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:41,480
shooting rainbows?

1771
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:44,360
It's Rainbow Islands, and it's awesome, you shut your judging mouth.

1772
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:50,720
Well, and the other thing that's good about the little rainbows, too, is that they actually

1773
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:55,360
protect you from overhead enemies taking big poops on you.

1774
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:59,840
So at any rate- That video finished, so I'm going to do the totally awesome Commodore

1775
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,840
64 version of the game.

1776
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:02,840
Okay.

1777
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:07,040
Well, at any rate, if you take too long on the level, then water will rise up from the

1778
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:08,040
bottom.

1779
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:12,120
The main characters are Bubloon and Bobloon, who are basically Bub and Bob, but they are

1780
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:14,360
in human form as Bubby and Bobby.

1781
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:17,960
Which, just looking at Bubby makes me laugh, because that's also like the Yiddish word

1782
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:18,960
for grandmother.

1783
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:19,960
Listen, Bubby.

1784
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:20,960
Bubby.

1785
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:23,720
And Bobby, Bobby's in this game.

1786
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:24,720
Yeah.

1787
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:25,720
Bobby's in the game.

1788
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:29,520
So they're not bubble dragons, they're, you know, people.

1789
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:34,480
And they have to take turns through the level, so Bubby is wearing a green shirt and Bobby

1790
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,200
is wearing a blue shirt.

1791
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:40,280
There's also Rainbow Island's extra version that's a modified version.

1792
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:44,400
It has the same thing, except the bosses are in different orders, the enemies are in different

1793
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:47,560
order, kind of like Bubble Bobble's super mode.

1794
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:49,920
And it came out in limited quantities.

1795
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:55,020
Now, just to let you know, it actually was included in the Mega Drive version of Rainbow

1796
01:29:55,020 --> 01:30:01,600
Islands, and the arcade version was actually licensed to Romstar to come out over in the

1797
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,600
US.

1798
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:08,800
So, the version that I was playing of Bubble Bobble had that version on it, the PS1 collection,

1799
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,800
Bubble Bobble collection.

1800
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:15,520
So all the different versions that came out at home, there was a Commodore 64, which we

1801
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:21,200
just heard, the ZX Spectrum, an Amstrad CPC, there was an Amiga and Atari ST, the Mega

1802
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:27,880
Drive version, there was the NES version, which was not that great, the European version

1803
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:31,320
is also different than the Japanese version, just saying.

1804
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:34,760
Sorry, sorry for that little clip in the background that wasn't really from Rainbow Islands, it

1805
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:40,040
said it was the loading theme, but I think that was a universal loader thing back in

1806
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:42,560
Commodore 64 piracy days, so sorry.

1807
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:45,920
That clip was not actually from Rainbow Islands, I apologize.

1808
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:47,560
So we'll go to...

1809
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:48,560
Can I keep listing?

1810
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,920
Yeah, but I need to find what system to do now.

1811
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:55,480
How about this one, I think this is Arcade, let's hope nobody's doing a voiceover on this

1812
01:30:55,480 --> 01:30:56,480
one.

1813
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:58,480
The Arcade one that I found was really quiet.

1814
01:30:58,480 --> 01:30:59,480
Yeah.

1815
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:02,680
It's alright, it needs to be quiet so you can talk over it.

1816
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:08,600
At any rate, we also had PC Engine Turbo Graphics, which was the first one that I linked as a

1817
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:09,600
cue card.

1818
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:15,320
There was also a PC Sega Saturn and Playstation version that was released as Bubble Bobble

1819
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:17,560
featuring Rainbow Islands, that's the one I was playing.

1820
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:24,200
There's a WonderSwan version, Game Boy Color, PC, PS2, Xbox that came out as part of Taito

1821
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:25,200
Legends.

1822
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:33,360
A mobile version and Xbox Live Arcade version got one that was updated with 2.5T graphics.

1823
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:41,040
And then the Arcade game, now this is kinda neat, the music was actually based off Over

1824
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:43,680
the Rainbow from the Wizard of Oz.

1825
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:50,440
And it came on the Mega Drive, PC Engine, and Famicom versions, but when it came out

1826
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:56,840
on the Master System, Saturn, all those other ones, they actually changed it so that they

1827
01:31:56,840 --> 01:32:00,280
wouldn't risk copyright infringement.

1828
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:02,040
So yeah, that's the game that we have.

1829
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:05,480
Oh, and I do want to mention some regional differences.

1830
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:08,940
For the Sega Master System version and the European one, there was a glitch that made

1831
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:12,960
the game crash after level 7, so it sent you back to the title screen.

1832
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:19,000
If you use the level select code to get to 8, the glitch happens at the end of that level

1833
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,400
and you can't even see the ending.

1834
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:23,560
The Brazilian version, fixed it.

1835
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:29,080
And the European version of the NES port is actually a lot more like the Arcade version

1836
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:33,800
where the Japanese and North American versions have the original level designs and story

1837
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:34,800
versions.

1838
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:35,800
That's it.

1839
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:41,460
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Rainbow Islands, on pretty much

1840
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:44,860
every frickin' console that was out at the time.

1841
01:32:44,860 --> 01:32:46,520
And a few that weren't out at the time.

1842
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:47,520
That's right.

1843
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:48,520
There you go.

1844
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:52,000
By the way, just to answer some questions from chat, some folks were saying, wasn't

1845
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,360
that already the game of the week before?

1846
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:54,360
No.

1847
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:58,400
No, we did check versus the wiki, Parasol Stars, which was kind of a different like

1848
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:00,520
bubble bobble sequel the other way.

1849
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:02,360
It was one of the official sequels to the game.

1850
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:06,840
Right, it was in the past and I'm pretty sure I would have brought up Rainbow Islands because

1851
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:11,840
I did genuinely like the game a lot, but I believe, at least according to our wiki, this

1852
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,920
is the first time that it has officially been the game of the week.

1853
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:17,960
I did Parasol Stars like, what, last year, the year before, or something like that?

1854
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:18,960
It was a while ago.

1855
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:23,080
Well, you gotta remember, we've been doing classic game of the week since episode 250,

1856
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:24,080
I believe.

1857
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:25,080
Yeah.

1858
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:26,080
We're almost to 450.

1859
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:28,340
I've named over 200 games.

1860
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:30,880
Probably when you count the marathon show and some of the shows where you weren't here

1861
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:33,400
and all that, it's probably up to about 200 games.

1862
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:34,400
Yeah, so.

1863
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:35,400
There's still more to go.

1864
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:36,400
I check.

1865
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:40,680
I fact check because, dammit, I don't misspell shit like Capcom does.

1866
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:42,120
I mean, I love you, Capcom, hire me.

1867
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:44,000
But you did duplicate a game once, but just once.

1868
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Why did I duplicate?

1869
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Eh, one of the Final Fantasy games.

1870
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,000
It was in there twice.

1871
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,480
No, I think that I did a different version of it.

1872
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:49,480
Eh.

1873
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:50,480
Whatever.

1874
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:52,040
I think it was one of those things where when it happened, we were just like, yeah, you

1875
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:53,040
know what?

1876
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:54,040
Deal with it.

1877
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:55,040
Yeah.

1878
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:56,040
It's been 200 shows.

1879
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:57,040
If that was my only thing, then.

1880
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,040
This game was doubly classic.

1881
01:33:58,040 --> 01:33:59,040
Screw it.

1882
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:02,020
I'm, what I will, you know, it's going to get to a point where you're like, shit, I've

1883
01:34:02,020 --> 01:34:03,020
done like everything.

1884
01:34:03,020 --> 01:34:04,020
I'm going to be like.

1885
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:06,520
It's going to be a PCP version as well.

1886
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:07,520
I think that's what he heard.

1887
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:10,760
Uh, I'm going to get out my Commodore 64 five and a quarter floppies and be all like, just

1888
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:13,360
pick one out of the box.

1889
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,600
My dad still has those in the garage.

1890
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:16,600
You think those disks work?

1891
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:19,400
Or do you think they've probably melted by now?

1892
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:20,400
Let's fire up.

1893
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:21,400
Geos.

1894
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:22,400
All right.

1895
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:24,680
Anyhow, uh, we're gonna take a break guys, but there's still plenty more show to come.

1896
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:25,840
Rapid fire news coming up.

1897
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:30,800
Of course, your emails at mailbag at orangeonshooter.com, uh, the FUs of the week, Twitter topics, and

1898
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:40,800
so much more when we come back with more of orange lounge radio.

1899
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:44,000
Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio.

1900
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:51,520
We are live with the 446 episode, 446th episode of our show on this February, the 19th of

1901
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:55,080
2012 live tonight live only tonight.

1902
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:58,680
We're saying goodbye sadly to the OLR after birth at the very end of the show.

1903
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:01,560
You know, we used to be live for about 20 minutes after we taped the show.

1904
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:04,720
And the reason why we couldn't podcast is because a big central part of that was the

1905
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:07,080
cage match where we played copyrighted music.

1906
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:10,960
Uh, we've made a very difficult creative decision to end that segment tonight.

1907
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:16,180
Um, in the good news is that it'll free up the resources to do other things, but I want

1908
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:17,180
to warn everybody.

1909
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:18,520
Don't expect that to come right away.

1910
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:21,640
Uh, there's still some things that have to happen behind the scenes, but we are going

1911
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:23,920
to use the time to work on other projects.

1912
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:27,440
Um, so we still appreciate, of course, the live listeners coming out every week, but

1913
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:31,080
we hope you'll understand and respect our decision to, um, you know, kind of say, you

1914
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:33,840
know what, this, the segments losing steam for us.

1915
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:38,480
We need to, we need to kind of put it out to pasture and reinvent with something new.

1916
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:39,880
So that'll be ending live tonight.

1917
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:41,760
Podcasters, not a damn thing changes for you.

1918
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:45,840
If you've never listened to OLR live before, you're not going to notice a lick of difference

1919
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:46,840
right now.

1920
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:48,840
No, nothing will change.

1921
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:49,840
Nothing will change.

1922
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:50,840
The show is still fine.

1923
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:51,840
All right.

1924
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:53,680
Um, still holding it together with chicken wire duct tape.

1925
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:56,240
There might be more in the future for you.

1926
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:57,240
Who knows?

1927
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:58,240
All right.

1928
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:02,320
Uh, anyhow, before I give too much away, uh, let's talk, Oh, speaking of spoilers, I wanted

1929
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:06,120
to bring this up at some point because, um, last week on the show, we had a very, uh,

1930
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:10,520
unexpected surprise during the phone call segment and we made a new friend here at orange

1931
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:16,320
launch radio and it was Asuka, Asuka, I always, I always want to say Asuka, but it's Asuka.

1932
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:24,720
Keep in mind any, and for most words in Japanese, the U or Su or Ru, the U is really cut short.

1933
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:29,760
Well now I've had my lesson, but, um, Asuka was on the show last week and she is from

1934
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:36,120
the tester, which is, uh, the Sony, um, download show that you can get reality show that you

1935
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:37,400
can only download.

1936
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:41,080
And she was on the show last week and she was very candid about the whole thing and

1937
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:42,080
it was great.

1938
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:45,320
I really love talking to her and you know, I feel like we made a new friend and a new

1939
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:50,520
member of the OL army who was very real with us about what was going on on the show.

1940
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:56,040
And a spoiler alert, she got kicked off this week, which was the second week of the show,

1941
01:36:56,040 --> 01:37:00,000
which in some ways, you know, from an OLR perspective is, is funny.

1942
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,660
I mean, I'm not, obviously I am not happy she got kicked off.

1943
01:37:03,660 --> 01:37:04,660
I think it's sad.

1944
01:37:04,660 --> 01:37:05,840
I wish, I really do wish she would have won.

1945
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:09,860
She was a great gal, but in the respect of she was on the show, not even three days before

1946
01:37:09,860 --> 01:37:15,480
she got kicked off on the, the one props to her for keeping that secret.

1947
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:18,660
Cause if I was, if that was me, that would have been a really hard thing to keep under

1948
01:37:18,660 --> 01:37:24,780
my hat is like, no guys, really next week's episode is going to make you so mad.

1949
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:30,020
But the only bummer about that episode is, um, it was, it was kind of one of those things

1950
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:32,760
where it was like, they definitely did Loki.

1951
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:33,760
You saw it, right?

1952
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,400
You finally watched it or whatever.

1953
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:42,280
They definitely went for, it was an episode where you were reminded that it's a TV show

1954
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:47,520
and not really a job interview because the decision that they made, you know, Oscar got

1955
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:53,060
kicked off in favor of somebody who, you know, was quote unquote more entertaining television.

1956
01:37:53,060 --> 01:37:57,420
And Oscar knows that's not a dig on her, but this person that they kept was causing drama

1957
01:37:57,420 --> 01:37:59,960
and dramas ratings and so forth.

1958
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:04,180
And Oscar, you know, was, was generally trying to get the job done and so forth.

1959
01:38:04,180 --> 01:38:07,440
But unfortunately the way that whole challenge was set up, it was going to be her, the other

1960
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:09,640
gal and the other gal was starting fights.

1961
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:15,700
So she was, excuse me, she had personality or whatever Jaffe said about her.

1962
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:20,520
So bummer about Oscar, very sad to hear about that.

1963
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:24,040
And um, you know, I get the sense she's kind of bummed out about the edit she got on the

1964
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:25,920
show just in reading her Twitter and stuff.

1965
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:30,600
But I just want to say, you know what I know, I think what bugs her is that they used a

1966
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:32,840
clip of her at the very beginning of the show.

1967
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:33,840
I'm just guessing.

1968
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:37,420
I don't know, but I'm going to guess if I were her, they used a clip of her at the very

1969
01:38:37,420 --> 01:38:40,980
beginning of the show where she's dogging on Egoraptor a little bit because Egoraptor

1970
01:38:40,980 --> 01:38:45,240
got to stay around and this show kind of starts off with her like that's bull that he got

1971
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:47,560
to stick around and you know, so forth.

1972
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:51,540
Well guys, you know, remember this and the problem is Egoraptor has a very rabid fan

1973
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:56,080
base on the internet and I'm sure she's getting, you know, nasty tweets and so forth because

1974
01:38:56,080 --> 01:39:00,760
of that, which is stupid because people should differentiate, you know, television from the

1975
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:04,480
real person we had on the show last week who was a lot of fun.

1976
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:08,900
I'm sure every person in the house said it was bullshit that he got to stick around because

1977
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:11,660
of course that's one person between you and the prize.

1978
01:39:11,660 --> 01:39:16,280
They chose to show her probably because they wanted to show her to remind people who she

1979
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:19,240
was because it was going to be her week to get kicked off the show.

1980
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:22,640
You know, so it was all editing garbage and all this stuff.

1981
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:26,180
So you know, it's unfortunate, but I didn't think she looked like a bitch.

1982
01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:31,240
I think she looked like somebody who was fighting to be there, you know, and that's, that was,

1983
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:32,600
that was what it was all about.

1984
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:33,840
So best of luck.

1985
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:37,220
And if I know she's not in chat tonight, but I think there was a con or something this

1986
01:39:37,220 --> 01:39:40,820
weekend if we can get her back on the show to really now get the skinny on what went

1987
01:39:40,820 --> 01:39:44,800
down, she definitely has an open invite to come back any time.

1988
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:50,600
Meanwhile, let's move on and talk about other video game news and we'll go with the rapid

1989
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:51,600
fire news.

1990
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:52,600
Loki.

1991
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:53,600
All right.

1992
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:57,120
So let's talk a little bit about, this is kind of cool.

1993
01:39:57,120 --> 01:40:02,720
It's a Vita game I'm definitely looking forward to and that would be Resistance Burning Skies.

1994
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:09,560
It has been announced that it is coming out May 29th on the Vita and you know, kind of

1995
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:16,320
been a side story to the whole Resistance series and looks pretty awesome.

1996
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:19,400
So I'm definitely checking that out.

1997
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:24,480
Also, it wasn't part of this, but I believe Gravity Rush is also supposed to be coming

1998
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:32,780
out that same day as well, which is another really awesome looking Vita game, which unfortunately

1999
01:40:32,780 --> 01:40:37,080
due to the fact that you can only have one profile on your Vita system, I am not able

2000
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:43,080
to download to my Vita, which is annoying, but yeah.

2001
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:44,080
So there's that.

2002
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:50,760
And then on top of that, there's also this new arcade game that's coming to Xbox Live

2003
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:51,760
Arcade.

2004
01:40:51,760 --> 01:41:00,040
It's called Jam Live Music Arcade and what it is, is it's kind of like a music creation

2005
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:02,960
remix program.

2006
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:10,840
You can use your instruments, your Guitar Hero instruments, Rock Band instruments, whatever,

2007
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:12,880
with this and you can actually remix some different songs.

2008
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:17,800
It includes 30 licensed songs including, I guess, stuff from Modest Mouse, Fall Out Boy,

2009
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:25,080
Fat Boy Slim, Rise Against, Atmosphere, and some other artists.

2010
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:28,960
And we'll be coming out, I guess, on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network later

2011
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,320
this year.

2012
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:34,880
So that's kind of cool, at least something to maybe dust those instruments off for.

2013
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:41,520
And then finally, the next piece of download content has been announced for, well the date

2014
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:46,720
has for the, since we're the third game, Gangstas in Space.

2015
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:54,560
It continues on kind of one of the endings of the game where you are filming a movie

2016
01:41:54,560 --> 01:42:00,760
and it's really cheesy, kind of like a parody of old Star Trek episodes or whatever.

2017
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:02,920
It's just really, really ridiculous.

2018
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:04,880
But there's gonna be that.

2019
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:09,040
It's coming out for $6.99 on the 21st.

2020
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:13,640
I will probably download it because I like Saints Row, so I don't know why I just didn't

2021
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:15,040
get a season pass.

2022
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:20,040
I gotta say this though, it better be longer than the last DLC because the last DLC I finished

2023
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:22,060
in an hour and that's bullshit.

2024
01:42:22,060 --> 01:42:23,160
How much was it?

2025
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:24,160
Seven dollars.

2026
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:27,720
That is absolute bullshit.

2027
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:31,960
And I gotta tell you this much, they aren't already starting off on a good note because

2028
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:36,600
I thought the whole Gangstas in Space mission at the end won the alternate enemies.

2029
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:39,920
It was kind of stupid, but whatever.

2030
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:43,640
That's too bad because the first hour of that game I've never laughed so hard in my life.

2031
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:44,640
That game is awesome.

2032
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:47,400
No, don't get me wrong, that game is awesome.

2033
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:53,080
It's just how they're treating the whole download content thing is just really annoying.

2034
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:59,920
And trust me, if all three of these pieces of download content are terrible like this,

2035
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:03,760
I'm just not gonna buy any download content for you guys anymore.

2036
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:09,640
There's still ways I can play this shit without having to buy it, so I have that option, but

2037
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:10,640
I'm not taking it.

2038
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:12,640
I actually am purchasing download content.

2039
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:13,640
Alright.

2040
01:43:13,640 --> 01:43:17,520
Speaking of DLC, I just want to insert something here because I noticed it's not in the show

2041
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:20,120
roll but it's something I read because it sounds interesting to me.

2042
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:22,520
Final Fantasy XIII-2 is getting a lot of DLC.

2043
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:25,120
This is a very interesting path that Square is going down.

2044
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:29,320
I wonder what this is going to do for future Final Fantasy games, but I guess they announced

2045
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:30,320
one this week.

2046
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:36,920
Not only are they doing another costume, and this one is Sarah with booby-age, but there's

2047
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:42,560
going to be a side story mission now that will bring back Saws, who is an awesome character

2048
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:44,040
in Final Fantasy XIII.

2049
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:46,200
He was the dude with the chocobo and his afro.

2050
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:50,520
I guess he's going to have a side mission or a side story thing, and if you beat it,

2051
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:55,000
you get to use him as one of the quote-unquote monster companions in the main game.

2052
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:59,160
So that could be interesting, but like Loki, I hope it doesn't disappoint in length.

2053
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:03,080
I hope it's something that you can, you know, is rewarding.

2054
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:07,200
I hope it has the same good storytelling as the rest of the Final Fantasy game does.

2055
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:09,240
Meanwhile, other rapid-fire news.

2056
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:13,800
Pandora's Tower is going to be coming out in Europe in April.

2057
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:18,160
Now this is notable because Pandora's Tower is one of those Operation Rainfall games,

2058
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:21,680
you know, one of the games that was big in Japan, and people were like, why aren't these

2059
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:23,400
games coming out on the Wii over here?

2060
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:27,580
Well, it's coming out in Europe in April, which means English translation.

2061
01:44:27,580 --> 01:44:30,080
Could it come out in America after that?

2062
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:31,840
Maybe by 2013 at this rate.

2063
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:32,840
We'll see.

2064
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:35,200
Meanwhile, the rest of us will probably have pirated it by then.

2065
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:40,200
Not that I endorse piracy, but I'm getting pretty damn sick of why is the game in English

2066
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:43,960
and takes nine months to come over here, and then it's exclusive to only one store.

2067
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:51,600
Excuse me, April 13th is the day that Pandora's Tower is coming out in Europe.

2068
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:52,960
Pretty awesome there.

2069
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:57,320
I guess the announcement came out with some Valentine's cards that they did online, which

2070
01:44:57,320 --> 01:45:00,360
was a very strange tie-in, but whatever.

2071
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:05,800
Metal Gear Solid, a little bit of Metal Gear Solid news this week, the Metal Gear 3D demo,

2072
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:06,800
by the way, is out.

2073
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,760
I haven't checked it out myself, but for those of you that are 3DS-ing, you might want to

2074
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:10,760
check out that demo.

2075
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:16,640
Otherwise, Metal Gear Solid 4 is going to be ending its online portion this summer.

2076
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:20,040
You might have already forgot that there was a whole Metal Gear portion online, but it

2077
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:22,240
was Metal Gear Online.

2078
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:26,120
It is going offline this summer, and it's probably because, well, nobody's really playing

2079
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:27,120
it anymore.

2080
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:34,360
I guess, oh, no, the shop for Metal Gear Online is closing March 21st, and then in April,

2081
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:39,880
you cannot make new characters, and on June 21st, it is all going down.

2082
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:45,480
Unfortunately, this is what happens to games that their servers aren't really used anymore

2083
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:49,400
is that they take the servers down and use them for other games.

2084
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:54,160
One other game announcement of sorts, or I guess it's more like a leaked, Korea's Game

2085
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:58,680
Ratings Board has leaked news about Dragon Ball Z Connect.

2086
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:03,560
Bondi Namco, who's made all the other Dragon Ball Z games, is making this one as well.

2087
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:05,880
Who knows what the hell this game will involve.

2088
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:08,080
Let's hope it will involve dancing.

2089
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:12,600
Not bad for a show that's been off the air in Japan since 1990-something.

2090
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:13,600
Right.

2091
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:17,720
But, hey, how many times have they rebooted Ninja Turtles, so...

2092
01:46:17,720 --> 01:46:20,440
Except they haven't rebooted Dragon Ball Z.

2093
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:24,360
GT came out, and that came out while I still lived in Alabama.

2094
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:26,300
So there you go.

2095
01:46:26,300 --> 01:46:28,680
That's my rapid-fire news, Dark Sakura.

2096
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:30,520
How about a Capcom-related one?

2097
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:34,200
There is a new Dark Stalkers trademark in Europe.

2098
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:35,400
Ooh.

2099
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:37,620
So maybe there's a surprise game coming out?

2100
01:46:37,620 --> 01:46:40,440
Maybe they're doing something in the vein of Street Fighter III?

2101
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:41,440
Who knows?

2102
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:44,540
But that would be really sweet.

2103
01:46:44,540 --> 01:46:52,140
And we actually have been getting those constant reminders from Ono to have a push on Capcom

2104
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:53,600
for more Dark Stalkers.

2105
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:55,640
He said this is all up to the readers.

2106
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:56,640
They have to create the buzz.

2107
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:57,640
They have to tell us.

2108
01:46:57,640 --> 01:46:59,620
They have to write the condition.

2109
01:46:59,620 --> 01:47:02,380
They have to send the letters out of plead.

2110
01:47:02,380 --> 01:47:05,480
I guess that was translated badly.

2111
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:08,880
Next up, Hulu Plus is now on Wii!

2112
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:13,880
And it is a $7.99 a month subscription.

2113
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:16,440
And there will be a 3DS version out later.

2114
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:18,920
But no one cares.

2115
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:24,120
And in Rock Band News, we do have some Megadeth.

2116
01:47:24,120 --> 01:47:32,600
The Megadeth pack has Symphony of Destruction and A Total Le Monde and Public Enemy number

2117
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:33,600
1.

2118
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:40,400
Symphony of Destruction has Pro Guitar and Pro Bass available for an extra buck.

2119
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:43,200
But there are...

2120
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:46,240
You can get the full albums of Peace Sells, but Who's Buying and Rest in Peace.

2121
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:49,320
Because, you know, for me, it's all about playing Sweating Bullets.

2122
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:50,320
Done.

2123
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:51,320
Alright.

2124
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:52,320
Megadeth.

2125
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:55,800
You know, I'm gonna say this.

2126
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:58,840
Megadeth is not great, but they had some great songs.

2127
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:04,720
I mean, freaking Dave Mustaine got kicked out of Metallica for a reason.

2128
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:06,040
But I don't know.

2129
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:08,680
I think Sweating Bullets is probably their best song.

2130
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:11,320
I gotta go back to the Darkstalkers news a little bit here.

2131
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:13,720
Obviously, that was some big news.

2132
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:17,800
Dungeon Buster in our chatroom at chat.orangelandrater.com says, I'd love another Darkstalkers.

2133
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:19,640
Dude, I don't think you're alone.

2134
01:48:19,640 --> 01:48:22,440
I would really get a kick out of that.

2135
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:24,800
And it would make sense for Capcom to go back to that.

2136
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:26,800
You know, they've had Street Fighter IV.

2137
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:28,680
They're gonna have this whole Street Fighter X Tekken.

2138
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:34,320
I wouldn't be surprised at all if Darkstalkers kind of gets that treatment for 2013.

2139
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:36,240
It's all about three.

2140
01:48:36,240 --> 01:48:38,000
One move and two characters.

2141
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,040
Now, reverse that.

2142
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:43,400
Two moves and one character.

2143
01:48:43,400 --> 01:48:46,280
The Succubus attack.

2144
01:48:46,280 --> 01:48:47,280
What was it called?

2145
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:49,720
The pleasure something?

2146
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:54,000
Dimitri's Midnight Bliss, where he turns the character into a female version.

2147
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,240
Sexy female and then sucks him dry.

2148
01:48:56,240 --> 01:48:57,240
And then...

2149
01:48:57,240 --> 01:48:58,320
Nasty.

2150
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:04,760
And then Jetta, who is just disgusting with the fetus, the God fetus stage.

2151
01:49:04,760 --> 01:49:08,600
All right, we're gonna get back into some more news here in the mailbag in just a moment,

2152
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:10,560
but I do want to make sure I put out a call.

2153
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:15,040
The last call for tweets for tonight, twitter.com slash O-L-R. If you have any statements you

2154
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:18,880
want to make on what we've talked about tonight, or if you have any questions for us, we'll

2155
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:23,600
take those via Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to add us and tweet at us

2156
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:24,600
at O-L-R.

2157
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:28,800
Uh, Loki, you got quite a little bit of news about one franchise, don't you?

2158
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:33,280
Yeah, Assassin's Creed Revelations done pretty well, so of course it makes sense that they're

2159
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:35,120
gonna do another Assassin's Creed game.

2160
01:49:35,120 --> 01:49:37,280
There's something called Assassin's Creed 3.

2161
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:42,240
Yes, that's confusing because it's not the third Assassin's Creed game, but whatever.

2162
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:48,320
It's coming out October 30th in North America, so it's, yeah, not too far away.

2163
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:52,680
Definitely in time for the fourth quarter rush.

2164
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:57,480
And for good reason, of course, Assassin's Creed Revelations shipped nearly 7 million

2165
01:49:57,480 --> 01:50:05,100
units worldwide, and to make a comparison with another popular franchise, Just Dance

2166
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:09,020
shipped 13 million units worldwide.

2167
01:50:09,020 --> 01:50:14,460
That's in the last year, but if you remember, though, Revelations, though, that came out

2168
01:50:14,460 --> 01:50:20,720
back in November, so it's had a lot less time to do that, so it's pretty cool.

2169
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:25,600
Of course, also, there's gonna be some download content coming to Revelations as well.

2170
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:29,640
The new download content's called Assassin's Creed Revelations Lost Archives.

2171
01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:37,000
It's gonna be $15, and some of the achievements have already leaked out about it, and it's

2172
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:47,040
supposed to be a single-player campaign as well, including 10 new achievements, so neat.

2173
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:52,720
Lots and lots of Assassin's Creed news, but I guess when your franchise is popular...

2174
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:55,600
The whole Assassin's Creed 3 thing doesn't bother me too much, though.

2175
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:59,000
Think about how many Mario games there have been that have had all these different numbers,

2176
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,640
like you had Mario World, then you had a bunch of other Mario games, then they went back

2177
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:03,160
and did Mario World 2.

2178
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:08,840
So Mario 64 wasn't really the 64th game in the series, although it may have felt like

2179
01:51:08,840 --> 01:51:10,840
his 64th appearance.

2180
01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:15,640
Alright, well, I find this next story kind of interesting.

2181
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:18,680
It wasn't really like one of the big news stories this week, but I found this whole

2182
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:22,160
discussion interesting, and kind of the questions this poses.

2183
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:25,760
And I'm gonna mention this story that's on Destructoid.

2184
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:33,240
And Destructoid ran an article about this site called Classic FM and the Hall of Fame.

2185
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:38,920
Classic FM is a radio station in the UK, and they're trying to do a Hall of Fame contest

2186
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:44,480
that has what they consider the most inspirational and worthwhile compositions of the year.

2187
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:46,320
The public votes on this.

2188
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:53,120
So there's a campaign to try to get Final Fantasy, Aris, Arith, I always want to say

2189
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:59,840
Aris, because I grew up that way, but Arith theme for Final Fantasy VII as a song that's

2190
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:00,840
recognized.

2191
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:06,100
Which, you know, love or hate Final Fantasy VII, you gotta say that's a damn fine composition

2192
01:52:06,100 --> 01:52:10,940
and fits in well with the classical theme.

2193
01:52:10,940 --> 01:52:15,880
It's interesting to me kind of how much we've seen the video games kind of dip into classic

2194
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:19,240
music just within the past, I don't know, I wanna say like five, six years, whenever

2195
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:21,080
they started Dear Friends.

2196
01:52:21,080 --> 01:52:26,440
Because Dear Friends, there's, you know, of course video games live, which was, I wouldn't

2197
01:52:26,440 --> 01:52:31,000
really say as a night at the opera, but it definitely brings classical music and rock

2198
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,400
music together, you know, in a way.

2199
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:36,080
But of course Play, the video game orchestra.

2200
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:38,560
You know, there have been several of these, and of course there was More Friends, which

2201
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:39,800
really was not good.

2202
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:43,840
I was there, you guys, it was a mess.

2203
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:48,720
But for the most part, now we have what, the Zelda tours happening right now, and all this

2204
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:49,720
other stuff.

2205
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:56,720
So there's definitely been a push to get people into classic music through, I guess, music

2206
01:52:56,720 --> 01:52:59,080
and games, which makes sense to me.

2207
01:52:59,080 --> 01:53:04,940
I mean, we really connect with a lot of these songs and games, especially a lot of the songs

2208
01:53:04,940 --> 01:53:06,240
in Final Fantasy.

2209
01:53:06,240 --> 01:53:10,440
Like Dark Sakura, I know you cheered when she died in Final Fantasy VII, but you've

2210
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:11,440
got to admit-

2211
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:12,440
Oh yes I did!

2212
01:53:12,440 --> 01:53:14,880
You've got to admit, the music was amazing.

2213
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:17,160
That actually wasn't my favorite music in the game, to be honest.

2214
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:18,160
Really?

2215
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:22,640
My favorite music in the game was the Jenova boss fight music right before that.

2216
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:25,040
But see, that's not something that's really classic, you know what I mean?

2217
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:26,360
No, but I'm serious.

2218
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:28,800
I thought the Erythos scene was actually kind of boring.

2219
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:29,800
Really?

2220
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:32,200
And it wasn't really musically exciting.

2221
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:38,400
I like really challenging and musically complex pieces.

2222
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:41,960
So that's why I really liked the Jenova theme.

2223
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:45,240
It was- what was that particular Jenova theme?

2224
01:53:45,240 --> 01:53:48,280
Wait, okay, go ahead and play some of it.

2225
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:51,520
Well, I was going to play the Eryth theme because I see a comment in our chat room here

2226
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:52,520
at chat.orangelandtrady.com.

2227
01:53:52,520 --> 01:53:56,720
Kaijuto says, I played Final Fantasy VII three times and I don't remember that theme.

2228
01:53:56,720 --> 01:53:57,720
I'm like, what?

2229
01:53:57,720 --> 01:54:01,720
All right, so here- yeah, I know.

2230
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:06,400
But you know something- here we go.

2231
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:08,880
This is right when she gets killed.

2232
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:15,960
And this music is kind of used as an incidental throughout the whole game.

2233
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:16,960
But it's sad.

2234
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:23,240
It's pretty, but it's just- What it did at the time- this was so fucking

2235
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:25,040
revolutionary for video games.

2236
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:26,240
You know, it really was.

2237
01:54:26,240 --> 01:54:31,000
I realize there's seven haters out there, but you've got to recognize there was nothing

2238
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,160
like this in games until here.

2239
01:54:33,160 --> 01:54:38,760
Yes, we had characters die in games before, but they didn't die on CD media in an epic

2240
01:54:38,760 --> 01:54:39,760
RPG.

2241
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:41,600
Well, Celes did throw herself off a cliff.

2242
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:45,400
Right, but she blinked and disappeared, you know?

2243
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:49,760
This was like big, you know?

2244
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:53,040
Well, find the Jenova thing.

2245
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:55,080
What was the actual name of it?

2246
01:54:55,080 --> 01:54:56,080
Do you remember?

2247
01:54:56,080 --> 01:55:00,080
It was, uh, hold on.

2248
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:02,520
I think I can get it.

2249
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:03,760
Just the Jenova theme?

2250
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:09,680
No, it was, uh- no, this wasn't it.

2251
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:19,180
It was, uh- because that's- I think it was the Jenova absolute.

2252
01:55:19,180 --> 01:55:20,180
That's the one I liked.

2253
01:55:20,180 --> 01:55:24,600
Oh, I remember this, too.

2254
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:27,400
Because it was like the play on the fight theme.

2255
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:31,240
And you know what, you know, I shouldn't dog this compared to the other one.

2256
01:55:31,240 --> 01:55:33,240
I mean, it definitely invokes a mood.

2257
01:55:33,240 --> 01:55:37,560
You know, a lot of the boss music in these games is supposed to get you, like, you know,

2258
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:38,800
pumped up, like, you know.

2259
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:39,800
But see, that's my thing.

2260
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:44,080
When I look for musical pieces, I look for the complexity of the piece.

2261
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:50,080
I'm not saying I didn't like the Aerith music even as much as I hate the bitch herself.

2262
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:53,720
It's just I thought her theme was a little formulaic.

2263
01:55:53,720 --> 01:55:54,720
I really did.

2264
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:56,660
It- yes, it needs to be recognized.

2265
01:55:56,660 --> 01:55:59,800
I think this is a much more mature piece of music.

2266
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:00,800
Just saying.

2267
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:03,840
Well, what's interesting, you know, despite whatever game you're gonna pick from these

2268
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:08,180
games, you know, the fact that I don't think this station would otherwise get as many votes

2269
01:56:08,180 --> 01:56:14,520
as they're gonna get now that there's actually a Facebook campaign trying to get Nobuo Imatsu's

2270
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:15,520
theme recognized.

2271
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:20,400
And you know what, no matter what song they pick, Nobuo Imatsu himself should be recognized

2272
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:23,640
because that man has contributed so much for video game music.

2273
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:26,840
Not just Final Fantasy, but some games that get grossly overlooked.

2274
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:27,840
I met him.

2275
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:30,720
I was- oh yeah, I sat two seats away from him.

2276
01:56:30,720 --> 01:56:32,040
Do you remember that?

2277
01:56:32,040 --> 01:56:33,040
When I went to Dear Friends?

2278
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:37,160
But I'll tell you, the other person that I met in music gaming who has been inspirational

2279
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:40,320
to me was Koji Kondo.

2280
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:45,240
But I think Nobuo Imatsu, like, I was just talking with Twitter, or talking on Twitter

2281
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:51,160
with somebody about this this week, Lost Odyssey is a grossly overlooked 360 title that also

2282
01:56:51,160 --> 01:56:52,720
has an amazing soundtrack.

2283
01:56:52,720 --> 01:56:54,240
But anyhow, I digress.

2284
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:59,060
I was trying to get into the whole topic of, does a video game theme deserve to be treated

2285
01:56:59,060 --> 01:57:06,000
as a classical, you know, nod as a class- and I say yeah, why not?

2286
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:10,720
My one thing about this is that now if that was a full- because keep in mind, the versions

2287
01:57:10,720 --> 01:57:16,320
of the songs of Final Fantasy VII were rendered with the game engine.

2288
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:20,440
If they had taken actual- because I mean, they're synthesized.

2289
01:57:20,440 --> 01:57:22,440
It's clearly synthesizer music.

2290
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:25,680
It's very complex synthesizer music, but that's what it is.

2291
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:30,080
If it had been, you know, classically recorded with a full orchestra and then presented,

2292
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:33,400
I think then maybe it could qualify.

2293
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:36,320
But then you'd be looking into, you know, electronic music.

2294
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:42,920
There's the Dear Friends version or there was an event in Japan that preceded Dear Friends

2295
01:57:42,920 --> 01:57:44,040
and inspired it.

2296
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:47,200
Was it 2002?

2297
01:57:47,200 --> 01:57:49,520
It had some type of numberation in it.

2298
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:52,440
There was some big concert they did in Japan for the Final Fantasy series.

2299
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:56,480
I want to say it was 2-2-2002 that kind of started the whole damn thing.

2300
01:57:56,480 --> 01:57:58,360
There's a CD out for it and everything.

2301
01:57:58,360 --> 01:57:59,360
Yeah.

2302
01:57:59,360 --> 01:58:00,360
So, anyhow.

2303
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:01,360
All right.

2304
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:02,360
Well, anyhow.

2305
01:58:02,360 --> 01:58:04,360
I mean, we could also look to the Black Mages CDs too.

2306
01:58:04,360 --> 01:58:10,560
I don't think this video game music should dominate this whole thing, but I think a tip

2307
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:12,160
of the hat would be great.

2308
01:58:12,160 --> 01:58:15,640
Ooh, good call from RDG Singe in the chat room.

2309
01:58:15,640 --> 01:58:16,640
Actraiser Suite.

2310
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:17,640
True.

2311
01:58:17,640 --> 01:58:20,320
Oh, man, that was some fucking good music.

2312
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:21,320
That was a...

2313
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:22,320
Who did that?

2314
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:23,320
That was...

2315
01:58:23,320 --> 01:58:24,320
Oh, God.

2316
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:25,320
Why is his name escaping me just now?

2317
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:26,960
He was in all the...

2318
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:28,600
He did a DDR song that was big.

2319
01:58:28,600 --> 01:58:30,080
He did all the Wangan music.

2320
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:31,080
Oh.

2321
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:32,960
Why is his name escaping me right now?

2322
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:34,720
He's like one of my favorites.

2323
01:58:34,720 --> 01:58:36,040
I know who you're talking about.

2324
01:58:36,040 --> 01:58:37,040
Oh, God.

2325
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:38,040
Alzheimer's setting in early.

2326
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:39,040
No, Rob.

2327
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:40,040
Yuzu Koshiro.

2328
01:58:40,040 --> 01:58:41,040
Yeah.

2329
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:54,760
All right, let's move on.

2330
01:58:54,760 --> 01:59:00,080
This is the part of the show where we're gonna go to the mailbag and read your emails.

2331
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:05,080
Every week, you guys email us at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and Dark Soccer dives

2332
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:07,040
into the email bag head first.

2333
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:08,200
It's a little sticky.

2334
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:09,720
And reads the emails.

2335
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:10,720
Sorry.

2336
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:13,400
Mailbag, orange laundry, I spilled cranberry juice on it.

2337
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:17,800
And this time, I won't bitch about your grammar.

2338
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:21,040
Hello, O-O-R. After last week's episode, I felt a little compelled to write an email

2339
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:22,040
to you guys again.

2340
01:59:22,040 --> 01:59:25,960
I wanted to express how much I admire what you three are doing for such a long time.

2341
01:59:25,960 --> 01:59:26,960
Volunteering isn't always easy.

2342
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:29,800
I'd like to tell my own story, if that's okay?

2343
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:30,800
I guess.

2344
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:32,200
You wrote a long enough email.

2345
01:59:32,200 --> 01:59:34,640
Hey, every gamer gets a voice.

2346
01:59:34,640 --> 01:59:35,640
In my voice.

2347
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:38,980
10 years ago, we started a team to rebuild the local playground.

2348
01:59:38,980 --> 01:59:41,880
It really needed a lot of work to be safe and nice again.

2349
01:59:41,880 --> 01:59:45,720
Of course, we have to raise money, and we organize a festival that lasts three days.

2350
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:50,000
More than 60 people helped us, from local youth to older people.

2351
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:53,560
People always have a great time during the festival, because just like you, we try to

2352
01:59:53,560 --> 01:59:55,200
be very down to earth.

2353
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:59,040
We don't think that we organize the biggest party ever, because we simply don't.

2354
01:59:59,040 --> 02:00:01,800
And most importantly, we don't act like it, too.

2355
02:00:01,800 --> 02:00:04,320
We want our festival to be for everyone.

2356
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:05,520
But it is sometimes hard.

2357
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:09,400
Some people come and say, wow, that's good money for only three days of work, but we

2358
02:00:09,400 --> 02:00:13,320
tell them how many hours, days, weeks, months to go into organizing the three days.

2359
02:00:13,320 --> 02:00:15,160
They say we must be crazy.

2360
02:00:15,160 --> 02:00:19,000
And yes, sometimes I don't feel like I'm doing anything, and sometimes it feels a little

2361
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,000
tedious.

2362
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,000
But you pull through.

2363
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:24,160
When in summertime, you hear children play, laugh, scream, and cry in the playground.

2364
02:00:24,160 --> 02:00:28,240
Their parents read a book, or their grandparents just sit and watch the grandchildren play.

2365
02:00:28,240 --> 02:00:31,220
It makes it all more than worth it.

2366
02:00:31,220 --> 02:00:34,960
It feels good to create a little space for people to be themselves and have a good time

2367
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:36,920
without having any troubles for a little while.

2368
02:00:36,920 --> 02:00:38,960
Can I just say, I think that's a great thing.

2369
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:40,600
That's volunteer work, essentially.

2370
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:43,840
That's volunteering for your community and doing good.

2371
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:47,200
A lot of people do that stuff and don't get paid a single dime.

2372
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:49,840
So I don't think you're crazy for only getting three days pay or whatever it was.

2373
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:54,000
And I think that they're actually raising the money for charity for the sake of keeping

2374
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,580
the playground upkeep.

2375
02:00:55,580 --> 02:00:56,580
That's great.

2376
02:00:56,580 --> 02:00:57,580
I think that's great.

2377
02:00:57,580 --> 02:00:59,640
OLR does that for its listeners, too, I think.

2378
02:00:59,640 --> 02:01:00,760
Well, at least for me.

2379
02:01:00,760 --> 02:01:02,200
You guys are very down to earth, too.

2380
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:05,920
You don't go bragging about how fantastic you are or how you are just so outstanding

2381
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:06,920
at games.

2382
02:01:06,920 --> 02:01:07,920
I am.

2383
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:08,920
No, I'm kidding.

2384
02:01:08,920 --> 02:01:11,920
You're just normal, everyday people with the same problems as everyone else.

2385
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:15,480
And funny as hell, too, I do miss Rob Bloods.

2386
02:01:15,480 --> 02:01:19,360
I don't.

2387
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:22,880
I'm sorry if this email is a little long, but it really comes from my heart.

2388
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:28,680
You are three hours of feel good and a very troublesome time for a lot of people.

2389
02:01:28,680 --> 02:01:30,180
Thank you for doing this show for so long.

2390
02:01:30,180 --> 02:01:33,560
I hope it can go on for some time because without it, I'd feel kind of lost.

2391
02:01:33,560 --> 02:01:34,560
You guys are awesome.

2392
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:36,840
Yours truly, Fabrice from Belgium.

2393
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:40,960
Aww, big hugs all the way for Belgium.

2394
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:41,960
And Rob.

2395
02:01:41,960 --> 02:01:43,960
What do you want, woman?

2396
02:01:43,960 --> 02:01:44,960
A cookie.

2397
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:45,960
I hate you.

2398
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:46,960
No, you don't.

2399
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:47,960
You love me.

2400
02:01:47,960 --> 02:01:53,680
You know what, though?

2401
02:01:53,680 --> 02:01:59,560
I appreciate that because I actually claim I don't want to be the best at gaming and

2402
02:01:59,560 --> 02:02:01,760
I don't want you to think I'm the best at gaming.

2403
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:07,040
I am just an average gamer, you know, because I think, you know, why would I be stupid enough

2404
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:08,040
to make that claim?

2405
02:02:08,040 --> 02:02:09,800
I know I'm not the best.

2406
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:14,360
I fully admitted how much sucking I did on Bubble Bobble today, which is like the easiest

2407
02:02:14,360 --> 02:02:15,720
freaking game ever.

2408
02:02:15,720 --> 02:02:20,240
But I do have the number four score in Master Mode on Born This Way and Rhythm Party, so

2409
02:02:20,240 --> 02:02:21,560
I will kick your ass at Rhythm Party.

2410
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:23,920
I am really good at Puzzle Bobble.

2411
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:24,920
Just saying.

2412
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:25,920
Just saying.

2413
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:26,920
We all have our things.

2414
02:02:26,920 --> 02:02:27,920
Yeah.

2415
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:28,920
No, we really appreciate it.

2416
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:32,120
I mean, this whole show is kind of a way for us to get together on Sunday nights and just

2417
02:02:32,120 --> 02:02:33,120
do this.

2418
02:02:33,120 --> 02:02:36,280
And it really, you know, in some ways it's become a habit.

2419
02:02:36,280 --> 02:02:40,600
I think we do this show out of habit at this point, but I don't know where I'm going with

2420
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:41,600
this.

2421
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:43,640
When I have a week off, it feels really nice.

2422
02:02:43,640 --> 02:02:44,920
I'm not going to lie.

2423
02:02:44,920 --> 02:02:46,760
Like a week off here and there has been great.

2424
02:02:46,760 --> 02:02:51,520
But like if I had every week off, I think I'd be going like, I'm really bored.

2425
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:52,520
Yeah.

2426
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:58,480
I really don't know what to do with my Sundays, you know, without, honestly, without the show.

2427
02:02:58,480 --> 02:03:02,840
Um, you know, I actually feel, I hate to draw the comparison, I feel the same way about

2428
02:03:02,840 --> 02:03:09,280
Babysitting Julian too, because I love that kid and I love doing the show and I guess

2429
02:03:09,280 --> 02:03:10,280
I like you guys.

2430
02:03:10,280 --> 02:03:13,840
I usually, I come here for Alan really.

2431
02:03:13,840 --> 02:03:14,840
Alan and the cats.

2432
02:03:14,840 --> 02:03:17,560
Alan's only been in the picture for a couple of years though.

2433
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:21,120
He's only been living here for about, you know, 10 months.

2434
02:03:21,120 --> 02:03:27,640
But um, no, I, you know, I, there, there would definitely be a void in my life.

2435
02:03:27,640 --> 02:03:28,640
I, you know, it's funny.

2436
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:32,960
I was just talking today about the Oscars, you know, the Oscars are on next week.

2437
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:33,960
Oscar shmaskers.

2438
02:03:33,960 --> 02:03:38,840
I used to be so into like, like a lot of gay man, this is very stereotypical, but we all

2439
02:03:38,840 --> 02:03:39,840
have our things.

2440
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:44,680
I used to be really into the Oscars like, you know, 10 years ago and I was just commenting

2441
02:03:44,680 --> 02:03:47,440
like, I haven't seen the Oscars in 10 years.

2442
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:49,080
Like who, who hosted last year?

2443
02:03:49,080 --> 02:03:52,840
I forgot, you know, cause I'm like, I do a show Sundays.

2444
02:03:52,840 --> 02:03:53,840
That's my thing.

2445
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:59,180
I don't watch award shows anymore, even though like 10 years ago my friends would throw dinner

2446
02:03:59,180 --> 02:04:02,400
parties where all the dishes were themed after the best picture nominees.

2447
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:03,400
Like how gay is that?

2448
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:04,400
Right.

2449
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:05,840
But, but it really happened.

2450
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:09,600
You know, it's, this has just become a part of my life.

2451
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:10,600
We've had scares.

2452
02:04:10,600 --> 02:04:14,840
Yeah, we've had scares, but, but you know, I'm going to have to say this is that even

2453
02:04:14,840 --> 02:04:19,760
if the situation has made me move, I would still try to find some way to make it work.

2454
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:22,320
I would try everything until there was no other option.

2455
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:27,380
I think even if OLR were to, I mean, there is going to come a day where OLR ends, everything

2456
02:04:27,380 --> 02:04:28,380
comes to an end.

2457
02:04:28,380 --> 02:04:29,380
Next week.

2458
02:04:29,380 --> 02:04:30,380
But no, not next week.

2459
02:04:30,380 --> 02:04:31,380
Stop it.

2460
02:04:31,380 --> 02:04:35,360
But you know, something will happen or whatever and you know, for whatever reason we'll choose

2461
02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:36,360
to end it.

2462
02:04:36,360 --> 02:04:40,160
And, but I just don't see me not podcasting.

2463
02:04:40,160 --> 02:04:41,160
I'd probably still do something.

2464
02:04:41,160 --> 02:04:43,520
I just have too big of a mouth.

2465
02:04:43,520 --> 02:04:51,540
Well, and we've actually, however we're going to make it work, still have a project in mind

2466
02:04:51,540 --> 02:04:56,360
that kind of got put on the back burner because of stuff and things, but we have stuff planned.

2467
02:04:56,360 --> 02:04:57,360
Curse that stuff and things.

2468
02:04:57,360 --> 02:04:58,360
I know.

2469
02:04:58,360 --> 02:04:59,360
All right, let's move on with emails.

2470
02:04:59,360 --> 02:05:00,360
Okay.

2471
02:05:00,360 --> 02:05:01,360
We're getting too sappy.

2472
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:04,800
This one comes from Haseo Sumi Ragawa and I'm not going to vag you on your grammar this

2473
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:05,800
time.

2474
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:07,960
Like I said, I'm being a good girl.

2475
02:05:07,960 --> 02:05:10,200
She wants to get hired this week.

2476
02:05:10,200 --> 02:05:12,980
Capcom.

2477
02:05:12,980 --> 02:05:13,980
You know what?

2478
02:05:13,980 --> 02:05:15,080
I have to get a job this year.

2479
02:05:15,080 --> 02:05:16,080
I have to.

2480
02:05:16,080 --> 02:05:17,100
I know.

2481
02:05:17,100 --> 02:05:20,580
So all of you out there listening, you want to hire me.

2482
02:05:20,580 --> 02:05:22,860
I'm really amazing.

2483
02:05:22,860 --> 02:05:25,240
She doesn't like selling French fries, you guys.

2484
02:05:25,240 --> 02:05:27,080
I'm not going to work fast food.

2485
02:05:27,080 --> 02:05:28,920
I know you're not.

2486
02:05:28,920 --> 02:05:29,920
Dear OLR.

2487
02:05:29,920 --> 02:05:30,920
Okay.

2488
02:05:30,920 --> 02:05:33,720
Recently I purchased a copy of the older schools for oblivion game of the year edition.

2489
02:05:33,720 --> 02:05:36,420
Now I'm enjoying it for the most part with the exception of one thing.

2490
02:05:36,420 --> 02:05:40,740
The game of the year edition has a glitch in which when you are, oh shoot, he's sent

2491
02:05:40,740 --> 02:05:42,800
this before.

2492
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:44,040
I've read this email before.

2493
02:05:44,040 --> 02:05:45,040
You have?

2494
02:05:45,040 --> 02:05:46,040
Yes, I have.

2495
02:05:46,040 --> 02:05:47,280
Did you send it again?

2496
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:48,680
Thanks for reading my email.

2497
02:05:48,680 --> 02:05:52,600
Yeah, it's the same email.

2498
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:55,280
I can pretend like we didn't hear it last week.

2499
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:56,280
So did he accidentally send it?

2500
02:05:56,280 --> 02:05:57,280
Short, short version.

2501
02:05:57,280 --> 02:05:58,280
Okay.

2502
02:05:58,280 --> 02:06:02,980
Got turned into a vampire in elder schools for can't get turned back cause he gets burnt.

2503
02:06:02,980 --> 02:06:05,400
I didn't even know you could be a vampire and I'll just rolls for, and I think I said

2504
02:06:05,400 --> 02:06:06,400
the same thing.

2505
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:12,080
And when this email was read, you meet a witch, she sends you out for stuff, but the ingredients

2506
02:06:12,080 --> 02:06:13,220
would not be accepted.

2507
02:06:13,220 --> 02:06:15,440
Now there's a patch.

2508
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:17,400
Well, elder scrolls games broken.

2509
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:18,720
Go figure.

2510
02:06:18,720 --> 02:06:19,720
Okay.

2511
02:06:19,720 --> 02:06:20,720
Last email.

2512
02:06:20,720 --> 02:06:21,720
Hey guys.

2513
02:06:21,720 --> 02:06:22,720
Sterlak here.

2514
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:23,720
Hi Sterlak.

2515
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:26,200
I'm sad to see the cage match ending after so long.

2516
02:06:26,200 --> 02:06:27,800
I've been listening since 2007.

2517
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:31,200
I've discovered some great music, thanks to the cage match, particularly the birthday

2518
02:06:31,200 --> 02:06:33,480
massacre pendulum and goldfrap.

2519
02:06:33,480 --> 02:06:37,400
That's all three of us are big picks that we've done.

2520
02:06:37,400 --> 02:06:42,520
That is interesting because birthday massacre was my thing.

2521
02:06:42,520 --> 02:06:45,400
Pendulum is a Loki's thing and goldfrap was definitely from you.

2522
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:46,400
That is true.

2523
02:06:46,400 --> 02:06:47,400
That is true though.

2524
02:06:47,400 --> 02:06:51,400
I'll definitely miss it as it was a big part of my week and something I always looked forward

2525
02:06:51,400 --> 02:06:52,400
to.

2526
02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:57,000
Well, maybe, maybe I'll suggest a song for you every week.

2527
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,000
There'll be something.

2528
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:59,000
Yeah.

2529
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:00,000
Jamie will start a music advice blog.

2530
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:05,160
You know, actually though, I did like the suggestion of post-show turntable.

2531
02:07:05,160 --> 02:07:06,160
Yes.

2532
02:07:06,160 --> 02:07:11,280
I love the idea of a post-show turntable FM because I think turntable FM is a great site.

2533
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:14,780
It's which I've been grossly neglecting lately.

2534
02:07:14,780 --> 02:07:20,040
We used to just, what, run heroics, we used to run heroics and listen to, you know, all

2535
02:07:20,040 --> 02:07:22,160
of our weird stuff.

2536
02:07:22,160 --> 02:07:26,660
And so, yeah, you know, you actually got me back into a few bands that I used to listen

2537
02:07:26,660 --> 02:07:33,360
to before, like, um, Lea Andreone and, uh, um, D-Lite.

2538
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:35,480
I met her once.

2539
02:07:35,480 --> 02:07:36,480
Nobody knows who she is.

2540
02:07:36,480 --> 02:07:37,480
I'm sure.

2541
02:07:37,480 --> 02:07:38,480
All right.

2542
02:07:38,480 --> 02:07:39,480
Okay.

2543
02:07:39,480 --> 02:07:40,480
So the rest of the email.

2544
02:07:40,480 --> 02:07:41,480
Yes.

2545
02:07:41,480 --> 02:07:44,520
Um, that being said, however, I do respect your guy's decision to end the segment.

2546
02:07:44,520 --> 02:07:45,760
It's not fun for you anymore.

2547
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:49,120
It's a little silly to continue and you should devote your energy to something fresh and

2548
02:07:49,120 --> 02:07:50,120
new.

2549
02:07:50,120 --> 02:07:53,860
I, like many diehard O'Larians, sort of see you guys as family.

2550
02:07:53,860 --> 02:07:56,880
I eagerly look forward to seeing whatever you come up with next.

2551
02:07:56,880 --> 02:07:59,880
Also, I have a podcast recommendation for Jamie.

2552
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:00,880
Ooh.

2553
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:01,880
Okay.

2554
02:08:01,880 --> 02:08:04,400
You mentioned a week or two that you were into history.

2555
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:06,760
Have you ever heard of Dan Carlin's Hardcore History?

2556
02:08:06,760 --> 02:08:07,960
Yes I have.

2557
02:08:07,960 --> 02:08:11,960
It's a really great podcast and quite educational as Mr. Carlin researches all his subjects

2558
02:08:11,960 --> 02:08:14,080
extensively and it really shows.

2559
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:16,760
I have listened to hardcore history, but I'm way out of it.

2560
02:08:16,760 --> 02:08:18,400
I used to listen to it at my old job.

2561
02:08:18,400 --> 02:08:21,800
Um, he has great radio personality and it's a blast to listen to.

2562
02:08:21,800 --> 02:08:26,320
I really think you as a history enthusiast will, um, would really enjoy it.

2563
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:27,320
Anyway.

2564
02:08:27,320 --> 02:08:28,320
Guess that's all for now.

2565
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:29,320
Keep up the awesome work guys.

2566
02:08:29,320 --> 02:08:30,320
Thank you, Sterlok.

2567
02:08:30,320 --> 02:08:32,100
You're such a sweetie.

2568
02:08:32,100 --> 02:08:33,680
I have the perfect idea.

2569
02:08:33,680 --> 02:08:39,560
Well, we're going to start a Tumblr that you, me and Loki all have access to and we will

2570
02:08:39,560 --> 02:08:41,040
post songs we think are cool.

2571
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:42,040
Okay.

2572
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:43,040
That's it.

2573
02:08:43,040 --> 02:08:46,880
If you have music recommendations, we'll have a place where you can go look.

2574
02:08:46,880 --> 02:08:47,880
Okay.

2575
02:08:47,880 --> 02:08:51,600
And the great thing, unlike cage match, you'll be able to press the stop button.

2576
02:08:51,600 --> 02:08:52,600
You know what?

2577
02:08:52,600 --> 02:08:53,600
You know what we should call it?

2578
02:08:53,600 --> 02:08:54,600
Huh?

2579
02:08:54,600 --> 02:08:55,600
We should call our new Tumblr.

2580
02:08:55,600 --> 02:08:56,600
O-L-R cage match.

2581
02:08:56,600 --> 02:08:57,600
Fuck yeah cage match.

2582
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:58,600
Yeah.

2583
02:08:58,600 --> 02:08:59,600
Fuck yeah cage match.

2584
02:08:59,600 --> 02:09:00,600
Everything on Tumblr.

2585
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:02,760
I swear to God, if one of you registers that now, I'm going to go do it right now.

2586
02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:03,760
Hurry up.

2587
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:04,760
Rob.

2588
02:09:04,760 --> 02:09:06,960
Well, okay.

2589
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:15,320
I am actually, you know, I was actually thinking that, uh, because I've been, I miss doing

2590
02:09:15,320 --> 02:09:19,400
the comic book podcasts I used to except comics are kind of, they kind of blow now.

2591
02:09:19,400 --> 02:09:25,880
Um, but I was thinking, you know, what we haven't seen, there's classic gaming podcasts,

2592
02:09:25,880 --> 02:09:29,720
but there's no real history of gaming podcasts.

2593
02:09:29,720 --> 02:09:30,720
You know what I mean?

2594
02:09:30,720 --> 02:09:31,720
So, okay.

2595
02:09:31,720 --> 02:09:40,680
I just want to throw the idea out there guys who would be interested in a history podcast

2596
02:09:40,680 --> 02:09:42,960
like history of gaming.

2597
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:46,620
I would like to know who is interested in that and just email the mailbag.

2598
02:09:46,620 --> 02:09:51,320
Also to the people who won master system games, I am sorry.

2599
02:09:51,320 --> 02:09:53,220
I have had a midterm last week.

2600
02:09:53,220 --> 02:09:54,760
I have been uber busy.

2601
02:09:54,760 --> 02:09:55,980
I'm very sorry.

2602
02:09:55,980 --> 02:09:57,520
Just send me an email.

2603
02:09:57,520 --> 02:10:00,920
It's my personal email, which I have given you guys because only a few people out there

2604
02:10:00,920 --> 02:10:07,680
have my real email and I will take care of it as soon as I get paid.

2605
02:10:07,680 --> 02:10:08,680
Okay.

2606
02:10:08,680 --> 02:10:09,680
I did it.

2607
02:10:09,680 --> 02:10:10,680
Fuck.

2608
02:10:10,680 --> 02:10:11,680
Yeah.

2609
02:10:11,680 --> 02:10:12,680
Cage match dot tumblr.com.

2610
02:10:12,680 --> 02:10:13,680
Okay.

2611
02:10:13,680 --> 02:10:14,680
I got it.

2612
02:10:14,680 --> 02:10:15,680
You know what song you should put up there first?

2613
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:16,680
It should be from both of us.

2614
02:10:16,680 --> 02:10:17,680
No, I'm going to put the troll a little song up.

2615
02:10:17,680 --> 02:10:18,680
Okay.

2616
02:10:18,680 --> 02:10:19,680
Last week.

2617
02:10:19,680 --> 02:10:20,680
Oh, why would I not?

2618
02:10:20,680 --> 02:10:21,680
Ooh.

2619
02:10:21,680 --> 02:10:22,680
10 hours of trouble.

2620
02:10:22,680 --> 02:10:23,680
What?

2621
02:10:23,680 --> 02:10:28,400
I want you to put Beth Dito up there.

2622
02:10:28,400 --> 02:10:29,400
I will.

2623
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:30,760
I will start putting good songs on there later.

2624
02:10:30,760 --> 02:10:36,060
You it's the same password as, as I shouldn't say that as something else.

2625
02:10:36,060 --> 02:10:40,040
I'm not going to say the same one we use for everything else except for that stuff.

2626
02:10:40,040 --> 02:10:41,040
Fucking safe.

2627
02:10:41,040 --> 02:10:44,480
I was being silly as if for everything except for that other stuff.

2628
02:10:44,480 --> 02:10:45,480
Yes, exactly.

2629
02:10:45,480 --> 02:10:50,520
God, no one knows what her password is anyway, except for Ron.

2630
02:10:50,520 --> 02:10:57,560
All right, Lord, anyhow, Rob, you make me ashamed.

2631
02:10:57,560 --> 02:10:58,560
Why?

2632
02:10:58,560 --> 02:10:59,560
I'm just kidding.

2633
02:10:59,560 --> 02:11:00,560
That made me sad.

2634
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:01,560
Rob, you should get me some Pinkberry.

2635
02:11:01,560 --> 02:11:02,560
No.

2636
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:06,240
See, that's the reason why we're actually quitting Afterbirth so we can go get Pinkberry

2637
02:11:06,240 --> 02:11:07,920
after the show.

2638
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:10,040
We've decided that Pinkberry is more important.

2639
02:11:10,040 --> 02:11:11,320
I'm kidding.

2640
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:20,400
Um, I actually hearing people being positive about the end of the, uh, the, uh, cage match.

2641
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:24,240
It's not really just the cage, but just the whole Afterbirth makes me happy, but you know

2642
02:11:24,240 --> 02:11:26,160
what makes me pissed off?

2643
02:11:26,160 --> 02:11:31,600
Rob, not starting the FUs of the Week music.

2644
02:11:31,600 --> 02:11:33,520
I didn't know that we were done with the mailbag.

2645
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:34,520
Mailbag at...

2646
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:35,520
We are.

2647
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:36,520
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2648
02:11:36,520 --> 02:11:37,520
Girl.

2649
02:11:37,520 --> 02:11:44,520
And now the FUs of the Week.

2650
02:11:44,520 --> 02:11:56,520
Uh, I guess I really don't have an FU.

2651
02:11:56,520 --> 02:11:57,520
No, I'm kidding.

2652
02:11:57,520 --> 02:12:05,120
Um, FU to, uh, not having an iPad in my hand hurting, like, a bitch while I was trying

2653
02:12:05,120 --> 02:12:10,640
to eat, uh, a Mongolian barbecue today and for Rob telling me that my dinner was stinky.

2654
02:12:10,640 --> 02:12:13,880
It was a little stinky.

2655
02:12:13,880 --> 02:12:22,000
It was just garlic and onions and lamb and moms and, um, an FU to me not having an awesome

2656
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:23,000
job.

2657
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,360
Capcom!

2658
02:12:25,360 --> 02:12:27,140
I want to work for you.

2659
02:12:27,140 --> 02:12:32,440
I would be a proud employee of Capcom, but then I couldn't talk about your games on OLR

2660
02:12:32,440 --> 02:12:34,980
anymore.

2661
02:12:34,980 --> 02:12:37,200
That would be a good reason to end OLR though, just saying.

2662
02:12:37,200 --> 02:12:38,760
Jamie got a job at Capcom.

2663
02:12:38,760 --> 02:12:39,760
We have to end the show.

2664
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:40,760
End DA's.

2665
02:12:40,760 --> 02:12:41,760
Ending the show.

2666
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:42,760
Alright.

2667
02:12:42,760 --> 02:12:43,880
I would just keep it up.

2668
02:12:43,880 --> 02:12:46,120
I would just show up as your celebrity guest.

2669
02:12:46,120 --> 02:12:47,120
It would be weird.

2670
02:12:47,120 --> 02:12:48,120
No, it would be weird.

2671
02:12:48,120 --> 02:12:49,120
We'd have to change the name.

2672
02:12:49,120 --> 02:12:53,480
It would be Rob and Loki on games because it wouldn't be OLR anymore.

2673
02:12:53,480 --> 02:12:58,760
Yeah, so really though, I mean, honestly, I am kind of in pissy mode about not having

2674
02:12:58,760 --> 02:13:11,720
a job and also FU to, um, my, uh, girl bits for not growing a small person.

2675
02:13:11,720 --> 02:13:14,280
I finally gave up and opened my bottle of chocolate wine.

2676
02:13:14,280 --> 02:13:15,280
My mom was 37.

2677
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:18,280
I don't want to be 37.

2678
02:13:18,280 --> 02:13:19,280
Well.

2679
02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:20,280
Ever!

2680
02:13:20,280 --> 02:13:21,280
No, I'm kidding.

2681
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:27,840
Um, yeah, uh, I gave up and I opened the bottle of wine I was saving for getting knocked up.

2682
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:28,840
So.

2683
02:13:28,840 --> 02:13:29,840
Done.

2684
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:30,840
Then it'll happen.

2685
02:13:30,840 --> 02:13:32,280
Don't get discouraged.

2686
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:34,480
You know what, I have a coworker going through a very similar thing.

2687
02:13:34,480 --> 02:13:35,960
Oh, no, I'm done.

2688
02:13:35,960 --> 02:13:36,960
I'm done.

2689
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:38,960
Loki, your FU's of the week.

2690
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:44,640
I have you the week of eBay for the way they handle their feedback on ship time because

2691
02:13:44,640 --> 02:13:49,720
that should be something that shouldn't even be reliant upon the person that you ship something

2692
02:13:49,720 --> 02:13:56,520
to because it's basically the time, you know, that your auction ends versus how much time

2693
02:13:56,520 --> 02:14:00,220
you say you're going to ship it and when you actually ship your thing, not how long it

2694
02:14:00,220 --> 02:14:04,600
takes in the mail, but people are educated enough to understand that.

2695
02:14:04,600 --> 02:14:07,800
And so they're like, well, it took a long time to get to me because you shipped it during

2696
02:14:07,800 --> 02:14:13,640
Christmas and all the, you know, the weather was bad and it took me weeks to get it something

2697
02:14:13,640 --> 02:14:17,720
by the slowest ass mail service that I decided to pay for instead of upgrading it.

2698
02:14:17,720 --> 02:14:19,320
So I'm going to rate you a one.

2699
02:14:19,320 --> 02:14:21,440
Well, that sticks around for a whole year.

2700
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:28,080
And then PayPal holds your money because they're fucking PayPal and they can do that.

2701
02:14:28,080 --> 02:14:34,260
So fuck you to eBay for even having that as an option of something to feed back on because

2702
02:14:34,260 --> 02:14:37,960
really they have all that information, they're just being fucking lazy so they can hold your

2703
02:14:37,960 --> 02:14:38,960
money.

2704
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:44,200
All right, my FU of the week, actually all things considered, I've had a, I've had a

2705
02:14:44,200 --> 02:14:46,360
pretty good week, so I can't complain too much.

2706
02:14:46,360 --> 02:14:52,340
So I regretfully have to give an FU of the week to Sanrio, who's one of our cats.

2707
02:14:52,340 --> 02:14:55,360
She decided to claw me this morning when I picked her up because I actually, I banged

2708
02:14:55,360 --> 02:14:59,360
my head on the door and it scared the shit out of her, so she clawed me and it hurt.

2709
02:14:59,360 --> 02:15:01,820
So FU'd a cat for clawing me.

2710
02:15:01,820 --> 02:15:03,680
So there you go.

2711
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:05,080
No KT's for you.

2712
02:15:05,080 --> 02:15:08,840
KT is short for a word I can't say because the cat understands what it means and she

2713
02:15:08,840 --> 02:15:09,840
will run in here.

2714
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:10,840
Yes.

2715
02:15:10,840 --> 02:15:17,360
It rhymes with Bitty Meats KT, so they actually know what that means and they'll run out here

2716
02:15:17,360 --> 02:15:18,360
screaming.

2717
02:15:18,360 --> 02:15:19,840
You know, I actually never have to say the word around Shermie.

2718
02:15:19,840 --> 02:15:20,840
Really?

2719
02:15:20,840 --> 02:15:23,400
I just have to say, is it time?

2720
02:15:23,400 --> 02:15:28,960
And she'll go, they know, they know Shermie loves her greenies.

2721
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:30,680
All right.

2722
02:15:30,680 --> 02:15:31,680
There it is.

2723
02:15:31,680 --> 02:15:32,680
Your FUs of the week.

2724
02:15:32,680 --> 02:15:35,120
This segment will not be going anywhere anytime soon, just so you know.

2725
02:15:35,120 --> 02:15:38,240
I realize it has nothing to do with games, but you know what?

2726
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:39,240
We don't care.

2727
02:15:39,240 --> 02:15:40,240
Sometimes we're mad.

2728
02:15:40,240 --> 02:15:41,240
Loki!

2729
02:15:41,240 --> 02:15:42,240
You mad?

2730
02:15:42,240 --> 02:15:43,240
More gaming news.

2731
02:15:43,240 --> 02:15:44,240
You mad Rob?

2732
02:15:44,240 --> 02:15:45,240
You mad?

2733
02:15:45,240 --> 02:15:46,240
I'm mad.

2734
02:15:46,240 --> 02:15:47,240
2.0.

2735
02:15:47,240 --> 02:15:48,240
Heart.

2736
02:15:48,240 --> 02:15:53,240
All right, so let's talk a little bit about indie games and you know, no one's gonna disagree

2737
02:15:53,240 --> 02:15:57,800
at the fact that they're kind of hard to find sometimes.

2738
02:15:57,800 --> 02:16:04,920
Microsoft seems to kind of bury them pretty well within their new dashboard revisions

2739
02:16:04,920 --> 02:16:12,200
and the like, so of course it's up to the indies to take matters into their own hands

2740
02:16:12,200 --> 02:16:18,620
and launch their own Xbox Live indie game app for Windows Phone 7.

2741
02:16:18,620 --> 02:16:19,760
So they have done that.

2742
02:16:19,760 --> 02:16:27,780
There's actually an app that ties with XboxIndies.com and it gathers different feed data based

2743
02:16:27,780 --> 02:16:34,960
on that and you can actually search and link to the actual pages where you can buy them

2744
02:16:34,960 --> 02:16:42,280
and send them to your Xbox using this app and some other features that they're adding

2745
02:16:42,280 --> 02:16:49,480
that aren't really part of the indie games portion of the dashboard as it is are like

2746
02:16:49,480 --> 02:16:55,520
some dev picks and recommendations based on that kind of stuff.

2747
02:16:55,520 --> 02:17:01,400
So that's kind of cool and apparently this is going to be coming to other phone operating

2748
02:17:01,400 --> 02:17:07,860
systems like Android and iOS later on, but right now it's just Windows Phone 7.

2749
02:17:07,860 --> 02:17:12,840
But really it's kind of sad that they even have to do this because the fact that it's

2750
02:17:12,840 --> 02:17:19,080
just so poorly laid out on the current dashboard, but you know, it is what it is.

2751
02:17:19,080 --> 02:17:24,940
So at least now you can find that if you happen to have a Windows Phone 7, although I don't,

2752
02:17:24,940 --> 02:17:29,380
so eh, oh well.

2753
02:17:29,380 --> 02:17:35,200
I find that interesting though that the community is helping to fill in the gaps.

2754
02:17:35,200 --> 02:17:41,680
It's just sad that they're treating it the way, I mean, it's so under promoted.

2755
02:17:41,680 --> 02:17:47,560
I mean, so many games get added to that service and granted not a lot of them are great, but

2756
02:17:47,560 --> 02:17:53,480
there are a lot of them that are really good and good luck finding them because I mean

2757
02:17:53,480 --> 02:17:57,840
it's just, it's really hard to nail down that stuff.

2758
02:17:57,840 --> 02:18:01,960
I really wish that Microsoft's web interface was better because you know, you can find

2759
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:09,840
all those indie games on Xbox.com or whatever, but it's not easy to navigate that store and

2760
02:18:09,840 --> 02:18:13,320
I think it'd be really great if they would build something in the web because I think

2761
02:18:13,320 --> 02:18:18,420
that's a great feature to be able to queue up Xbox downloads from the web.

2762
02:18:18,420 --> 02:18:21,660
I did that with the DLC I bought this week for Rhythm Party just so I wouldn't forget

2763
02:18:21,660 --> 02:18:22,660
to do it.

2764
02:18:22,660 --> 02:18:26,120
But yeah, I think they should use the web more to promote the indie games, they really

2765
02:18:26,120 --> 02:18:27,120
should.

2766
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:29,960
Well that's just my thought.

2767
02:18:29,960 --> 02:18:35,160
Alright, well speaking of things we can't believe have been implemented by now, I still

2768
02:18:35,160 --> 02:18:40,700
can't believe that Apple has not put out an official tangible game button device that

2769
02:18:40,700 --> 02:18:43,280
works with the iPhone and iPad.

2770
02:18:43,280 --> 02:18:44,280
It's been third party.

2771
02:18:44,280 --> 02:18:45,600
Yeah, it's always been third party.

2772
02:18:45,600 --> 02:18:50,440
Well one of the biggest ones is the iCade and I think iCade is kind of getting adopted

2773
02:18:50,440 --> 02:18:53,880
as like the standard now, like there's games that just frickin' support it and one of the

2774
02:18:53,880 --> 02:18:58,440
big ones is the Atari's Classics thing will support iCade and more and more games are

2775
02:18:58,440 --> 02:19:02,800
supporting it so where Apple will not step in, iCade has been.

2776
02:19:02,800 --> 02:19:08,720
iCade is now putting out a new controller that's called the 8-Biddy.

2777
02:19:08,720 --> 02:19:13,360
It is basically an NES controller, is totally what they're jacking here, except it has four

2778
02:19:13,360 --> 02:19:15,860
buttons instead of two.

2779
02:19:15,860 --> 02:19:18,800
But hey, the NES controller was a great controller.

2780
02:19:18,800 --> 02:19:23,520
Kinda flimsy looking back on it, but when I was 11 that thing was rock solid.

2781
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:28,280
25 bucks if you want this thing on ThinkGeek and it will work on all the games that the

2782
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:30,480
iCade cabinet works with.

2783
02:19:30,480 --> 02:19:34,960
There's a D-pad start select and four buttons, I don't know what they're called but they're

2784
02:19:34,960 --> 02:19:35,960
there.

2785
02:19:35,960 --> 02:19:36,960
There you go.

2786
02:19:36,960 --> 02:19:41,680
And it looks neat, it looks a little Atari to me, which is strange because it's the 8-Biddy,

2787
02:19:41,680 --> 02:19:46,360
but it looks like it has that wood paneling look on the sides and then kind of that rainbow

2788
02:19:46,360 --> 02:19:51,360
color, kind of some of the old Atari art had, so it's kind of a mishmash of different video

2789
02:19:51,360 --> 02:19:55,120
game worlds, which is fine because they don't want to get sued.

2790
02:19:55,120 --> 02:20:03,920
For me, actually, as much as I like the idea, I wouldn't use it because playing on the controller

2791
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:04,920
hurts.

2792
02:20:04,920 --> 02:20:05,920
Let's imagine you didn't have that though.

2793
02:20:05,920 --> 02:20:06,920
Good idea, right?

2794
02:20:06,920 --> 02:20:08,920
Yeah, good idea.

2795
02:20:08,920 --> 02:20:11,640
Most people don't.

2796
02:20:11,640 --> 02:20:14,960
When I get an iPad, we actually were going to get an iCade.

2797
02:20:14,960 --> 02:20:15,960
Nice.

2798
02:20:15,960 --> 02:20:18,720
All right, things are pretty nice, I got to say.

2799
02:20:18,720 --> 02:20:20,360
Some day when I have an iPad, we'll see.

2800
02:20:20,360 --> 02:20:23,480
All right, moving on, DarkSakura, speaking of peripherals, right?

2801
02:20:23,480 --> 02:20:24,480
Yep.

2802
02:20:24,480 --> 02:20:32,480
We have some support for Razer, the company Razer, within their lovely peripherals and

2803
02:20:32,480 --> 02:20:34,440
this is actually from Mass Effect 3.

2804
02:20:34,440 --> 02:20:37,720
Their download content comes bundled with the peripherals.

2805
02:20:37,720 --> 02:20:44,400
You actually get the Impertrator gaming mouse, which is 80 bucks.

2806
02:20:44,400 --> 02:20:51,720
There is the Vespula dual-sided gaming mouse mat, the Black Widow Ultimate gaming keyboard,

2807
02:20:51,720 --> 02:21:00,560
the Razer Onza Tournament Edition Xbox 360 controller, the Chimera Xbox 360 gaming headset,

2808
02:21:00,560 --> 02:21:04,960
iPhone 4s protection case, and N7 messenger bag.

2809
02:21:04,960 --> 02:21:11,120
This is kind of big bucks of stuff, but it's all Mass Effect 3.

2810
02:21:11,120 --> 02:21:13,920
What do you think?

2811
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:15,640
I actually have a Razer mouse now.

2812
02:21:15,640 --> 02:21:20,280
I got one on Woot, the Tron Razer mouse, that came out for that.

2813
02:21:20,280 --> 02:21:22,020
I really love that mouse.

2814
02:21:22,020 --> 02:21:26,120
My only complaint is that I tend to click the side buttons when I don't intend to, so

2815
02:21:26,120 --> 02:21:30,360
I had to actually just disable them because one of them was set to mouse sensitivity and

2816
02:21:30,360 --> 02:21:34,560
that would really screw me up mid-raid, but otherwise, I love that mouse.

2817
02:21:34,560 --> 02:21:36,920
I love that it lights up and plays the Tron music.

2818
02:21:36,920 --> 02:21:38,520
The geek in me giggles every time.

2819
02:21:38,520 --> 02:21:44,680
Well, the other thing about this too is that on Razer's website, they're saying that this

2820
02:21:44,680 --> 02:21:49,400
Mass Effect 3 Collector's Edition peripherals and gear come with a redeemable code to unlock

2821
02:21:49,400 --> 02:21:54,340
bonus items for Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, including the Deadly Collector assault rifle

2822
02:21:54,340 --> 02:21:56,400
to give you a leg up on the Reaper invasion.

2823
02:21:56,400 --> 02:21:57,640
I'm quoting here.

2824
02:21:57,640 --> 02:22:00,960
If you have already unlocked the Collector assault rifle, this code will strengthen the

2825
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:03,280
weapon further.

2826
02:22:03,280 --> 02:22:11,160
And of course the game comes out in the US on March 9th.

2827
02:22:11,160 --> 02:22:15,920
That's kind of interesting, bundling the DLC with peripherals, but I guess at one point

2828
02:22:15,920 --> 02:22:18,180
there was DLC on Pepsi bottles, right?

2829
02:22:18,180 --> 02:22:22,600
So I guess this isn't anything too new to entice the real fans.

2830
02:22:22,600 --> 02:22:25,200
Sega needs to get their ass in gear and give us Pepsi, man!

2831
02:22:25,200 --> 02:22:28,960
But the problem is, here's the thing, I'm not into Mass Effect, but I know a lot of

2832
02:22:28,960 --> 02:22:33,600
people that are, and if I was into Mass Effect, I wouldn't want that mouse anyway, because

2833
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:36,400
I have the Tron mouse now.

2834
02:22:36,400 --> 02:22:42,160
You can only really have one mouse, maybe two, if you are really feeling spendy and

2835
02:22:42,160 --> 02:22:45,400
you want one for your laptop as well as your desktop.

2836
02:22:45,400 --> 02:22:46,400
That's it.

2837
02:22:46,400 --> 02:22:47,400
I suppose.

2838
02:22:47,400 --> 02:22:48,400
Yeah.

2839
02:22:48,400 --> 02:22:51,680
All right, just a couple more news stories for you guys, then the Twitter topics and

2840
02:22:51,680 --> 02:22:57,840
the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, but first, Loki.

2841
02:22:57,840 --> 02:23:05,320
All right, I know this is going to come as a shocker to you, so please be prepared, but

2842
02:23:05,320 --> 02:23:07,840
Activision is making another Call of Duty game.

2843
02:23:07,840 --> 02:23:08,840
Get out!

2844
02:23:08,840 --> 02:23:11,040
And it's coming out this fall.

2845
02:23:11,040 --> 02:23:12,040
Shut the front door!

2846
02:23:12,040 --> 02:23:18,960
I know, it's just, I cannot believe that kind of news.

2847
02:23:18,960 --> 02:23:21,320
It just boggles my mind.

2848
02:23:21,320 --> 02:23:27,760
So yes, anyway, so I don't even know why websites are running this story because it's stupid

2849
02:23:27,760 --> 02:23:30,560
but there's a French...

2850
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:32,000
Here we are reporting on it!

2851
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:33,000
Here we are.

2852
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:39,760
Yeah, there is a French, there's a few French retailers, I think it may have even been Amazon,

2853
02:23:39,760 --> 02:23:42,880
that listed Call of Duty Black Ops 2.

2854
02:23:42,880 --> 02:23:43,880
Well, goodie.

2855
02:23:43,880 --> 02:23:52,080
Then on top of that, there's also this now developer, not really a developer, but kind

2856
02:23:52,080 --> 02:23:57,080
of a contract art studio employee.

2857
02:23:57,080 --> 02:24:04,680
He had listed, one of the pieces that he worked on was Call of Duty Black Ops 2.

2858
02:24:04,680 --> 02:24:12,920
Of course, now he has that taken, his whole profile is taken off of LinkedIn, but yeah,

2859
02:24:12,920 --> 02:24:18,000
I mean, come on, if you're surprised of this news, then you're an idiot, I mean, because

2860
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:19,000
there is seriously...

2861
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:25,460
This is just crazy talk, I mean, what's going to happen next, Loki, Madden 13?

2862
02:24:25,460 --> 02:24:28,000
There's already Madden 13.

2863
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,960
I just...

2864
02:24:30,960 --> 02:24:32,840
My mind is blown.

2865
02:24:32,840 --> 02:24:33,840
I know, man.

2866
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:36,280
I know.

2867
02:24:36,280 --> 02:24:39,520
I don't know what to tell you, but...

2868
02:24:39,520 --> 02:24:43,400
You mean there's not going to be a Guitar Hero 6, or wait, there may actually not be

2869
02:24:43,400 --> 02:24:45,080
a Guitar Hero 6?

2870
02:24:45,080 --> 02:24:48,000
There's a possibility that there will be, but yeah.

2871
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:49,000
Alright.

2872
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:54,120
One more news story for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR

2873
02:24:54,120 --> 02:24:56,240
or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2874
02:24:56,240 --> 02:25:00,360
Due to the delay, it's probably actually already open by the time you're hearing this.

2875
02:25:00,360 --> 02:25:01,360
This is a quick story.

2876
02:25:01,360 --> 02:25:02,880
This is about...

2877
02:25:02,880 --> 02:25:09,880
This is about the interesting repercussions of the Kickstarter thing, because...

2878
02:25:09,880 --> 02:25:14,360
And the reason why I say that is because, you know, when the Kickstarter raised a million

2879
02:25:14,360 --> 02:25:18,800
bucks last week, I'm sure many of us, and I know we here on the show said, how long

2880
02:25:18,800 --> 02:25:22,920
before everybody else signs up for this, trying to get their game funded.

2881
02:25:22,920 --> 02:25:29,200
Well, it's been mentioned that possibly this game will.

2882
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:34,340
The folks at InXile Entertainment are going to start a Kickstarter, at least they've mentioned

2883
02:25:34,340 --> 02:25:36,200
their intentions to.

2884
02:25:36,200 --> 02:25:39,960
They did Hunted the Demons Forge, but the game that they want to use Kickstarter to

2885
02:25:39,960 --> 02:25:44,880
do is fund a reboot of Wasteland.

2886
02:25:44,880 --> 02:25:48,900
Brian Fargo, who's the CEO, recently got the rights to this role-playing game that was

2887
02:25:48,900 --> 02:25:53,920
on the PC back in 98?

2888
02:25:53,920 --> 02:26:01,080
I guess it's really a cult popular title because fans have been asking for a remake, and it's

2889
02:26:01,080 --> 02:26:06,200
very early in planning, but after seeing what happened with Double Fine, the CEO Brian Fargo

2890
02:26:06,200 --> 02:26:11,040
is on board, and they would have to raise a million dollars for that to happen.

2891
02:26:11,040 --> 02:26:15,840
I've got to be bluntly honest, I played a lot of old school PC games, and especially

2892
02:26:15,840 --> 02:26:19,120
Commodore 64 growing up, this game did not ring a bell to me.

2893
02:26:19,120 --> 02:26:22,000
And I'm sure there's fans of the game that are like, Rob, you're stupid, you suck.

2894
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:23,800
But I did not know of Wasteland ever.

2895
02:26:23,800 --> 02:26:24,800
I went and looked it up on Wiki.

2896
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:27,800
Yeah, it's apparently what Fallout's based off of.

2897
02:26:27,800 --> 02:26:28,800
Is it?

2898
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:29,800
Okay, well now that makes sense.

2899
02:26:29,800 --> 02:26:36,160
Yeah, I was looking, even in the little screenshot, there seemed to be some comparisons, but yeah.

2900
02:26:36,160 --> 02:26:41,840
This series is really old, it goes all the way back to, it was 88, not 98, that's how

2901
02:26:41,840 --> 02:26:43,640
old this game is.

2902
02:26:43,640 --> 02:26:48,120
Apple 2 and Commodore 64 and all that, I don't remember playing it on Commodore 64, and god

2903
02:26:48,120 --> 02:26:50,080
I thought I played everything.

2904
02:26:50,080 --> 02:26:57,720
So that'll be interesting if that can actually get rebooted, but who knows how many people

2905
02:26:57,720 --> 02:26:59,840
will be willing to put their money where their mouth is.

2906
02:26:59,840 --> 02:27:02,320
Dungeon Buster in our chat room says Wasteland is awesome.

2907
02:27:02,320 --> 02:27:06,000
Yeah, but will you pay 15 bucks to see a new one in advance?

2908
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:07,680
We'll see.

2909
02:27:07,680 --> 02:27:13,520
The Skype line is now open, 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2910
02:27:13,520 --> 02:27:17,040
Go ahead and give us a call, we're gonna take some calls before we close out the show.

2911
02:27:17,040 --> 02:27:21,520
In the meantime, we're gonna move to our Twitter, Twitter.com slash OLR.

2912
02:27:21,520 --> 02:27:24,680
Our first tweet tonight is from Dark Tetsuya.

2913
02:27:24,680 --> 02:27:30,140
There's an indie game jam type thing I'm going to be partaking in, so wish me luck.

2914
02:27:30,140 --> 02:27:36,040
And sends us a link to this thing at Glorious Train Wrecks, what in the world is this?

2915
02:27:36,040 --> 02:27:39,900
Pirate Cart 5, okay you gotta tell me what this is.

2916
02:27:39,900 --> 02:27:44,260
We're making loads of awesome and or terrible games and taking them to GDC to blow minds

2917
02:27:44,260 --> 02:27:45,260
with them.

2918
02:27:45,260 --> 02:27:48,840
Over the weekend of February 25th to 26th, everyone is invited to make as many games

2919
02:27:48,840 --> 02:27:51,640
as they can and submit them here.

2920
02:27:51,640 --> 02:27:55,360
After the event is over, we will package the games up into a launcher like we did with

2921
02:27:55,360 --> 02:27:56,520
previous Pirate Carts.

2922
02:27:56,520 --> 02:28:00,600
And then this March, we will be showing them off in a kiosk at the Game Developers Conference.

2923
02:28:00,600 --> 02:28:02,560
And they want everyone to participate.

2924
02:28:02,560 --> 02:28:04,520
That's kind of interesting.

2925
02:28:04,520 --> 02:28:09,020
Like please make all these games, we just want to flood.

2926
02:28:09,020 --> 02:28:12,760
It's almost like, let's throw something against the wall and see what sticks.

2927
02:28:12,760 --> 02:28:14,480
I don't know how else to phrase that, but we've got a call.

2928
02:28:14,480 --> 02:28:16,700
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio, who's this?

2929
02:28:16,700 --> 02:28:18,360
It's me, Swan Tom.

2930
02:28:18,360 --> 02:28:19,800
Hey, Swan Tom?

2931
02:28:19,800 --> 02:28:20,800
Yeah.

2932
02:28:20,800 --> 02:28:21,800
Hey, what's up?

2933
02:28:21,800 --> 02:28:22,800
Uh, none much.

2934
02:28:22,800 --> 02:28:25,000
This is my first time calling, obviously.

2935
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,880
I was going to say, I don't recognize the name, but welcome to the show.

2936
02:28:27,880 --> 02:28:31,000
Yeah, I've been listening to Five Years now.

2937
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:34,120
Holy schmoly, and this is your first time listening live?

2938
02:28:34,120 --> 02:28:35,120
First time calling in.

2939
02:28:35,120 --> 02:28:37,720
Oh my god, long time listener, first time caller.

2940
02:28:37,720 --> 02:28:44,160
Yeah, like, uh, I usually never listen live because I'm always sleeping or I'm doing something.

2941
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:45,360
Where do you live?

2942
02:28:45,360 --> 02:28:46,360
I live in Seattle.

2943
02:28:46,360 --> 02:28:48,560
But you're, you're on the West Coast.

2944
02:28:48,560 --> 02:28:49,560
It's not that late.

2945
02:28:49,560 --> 02:28:50,560
Yeah.

2946
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:51,560
But I work night shift.

2947
02:28:51,560 --> 02:28:52,560
I don't get off work like 4am.

2948
02:28:52,560 --> 02:28:53,560
All right.

2949
02:28:53,560 --> 02:28:54,560
You're excused then.

2950
02:28:54,560 --> 02:28:55,560
All right.

2951
02:28:55,560 --> 02:28:59,320
And the only reason why I remembered was, um, cause I don't know about you, but on Sundays,

2952
02:28:59,320 --> 02:29:05,120
like Loki, I usually like eat a big ass burger and like, I think it's cause I'm getting older.

2953
02:29:05,120 --> 02:29:11,760
I fall asleep after I eat and so it's like, like I get food coma.

2954
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:15,480
So like by the time I wake up, it's like nine o'clock and it's like already over.

2955
02:29:15,480 --> 02:29:17,160
So there's like no point.

2956
02:29:17,160 --> 02:29:20,240
Yes, I have had similar things going on.

2957
02:29:20,240 --> 02:29:21,240
It's usually after work.

2958
02:29:21,240 --> 02:29:23,480
I'll come home from work and it's like nap.

2959
02:29:23,480 --> 02:29:26,680
I mean, you probably do something similar, but of course you also work the night shift.

2960
02:29:26,680 --> 02:29:27,680
So there you go.

2961
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:28,680
Yeah, it sucks.

2962
02:29:28,680 --> 02:29:30,080
That's, that's the reason why I'm gaining weight too.

2963
02:29:30,080 --> 02:29:31,680
I eat and I sleep.

2964
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:34,920
Time to start playing rhythm party and walk a mile every day.

2965
02:29:34,920 --> 02:29:35,920
Yeah.

2966
02:29:35,920 --> 02:29:36,920
I can't do that though.

2967
02:29:36,920 --> 02:29:39,000
Cause uh, I get home at four and I live in an apartment.

2968
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:40,000
Oh yeah.

2969
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:41,000
Yeah.

2970
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:42,000
Isn't Seattle, isn't Seattle kind of nice though?

2971
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:43,960
Or are there like bad parts?

2972
02:29:43,960 --> 02:29:45,600
Uh, there's bad parts.

2973
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:46,600
All right.

2974
02:29:46,600 --> 02:29:47,600
I love Seattle for the record.

2975
02:29:47,600 --> 02:29:48,600
Like Tacoma.

2976
02:29:48,600 --> 02:29:49,600
I'm kidding.

2977
02:29:49,600 --> 02:29:50,600
I was just,

2978
02:29:50,600 --> 02:29:51,600
No, no, no.

2979
02:29:51,600 --> 02:29:52,600
Tacoma is actually pretty bad and a lot of,

2980
02:29:52,600 --> 02:29:54,840
I know, but I didn't want to actually say that.

2981
02:29:54,840 --> 02:29:58,320
We went to PAX obviously a few years ago and then I was in Seattle.

2982
02:29:58,320 --> 02:30:03,200
I just went for fun January of 2010 I think.

2983
02:30:03,200 --> 02:30:04,200
I know.

2984
02:30:04,200 --> 02:30:06,400
Cause you were there for a Martin Luther King.

2985
02:30:06,400 --> 02:30:07,920
You were going to see a friend or something.

2986
02:30:07,920 --> 02:30:08,920
Are you a stalker?

2987
02:30:08,920 --> 02:30:09,920
No.

2988
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:14,880
The only reason why I remember that was because, uh, I was like, Oh, sky's coming, but I don't

2989
02:30:14,880 --> 02:30:16,080
know what you look like.

2990
02:30:16,080 --> 02:30:18,720
And all three of you went to PAX and I was like, where are they?

2991
02:30:18,720 --> 02:30:19,720
I don't know what they look like.

2992
02:30:19,720 --> 02:30:21,080
We were broadcasting in the hall.

2993
02:30:21,080 --> 02:30:25,680
I took a two hour nap on the beanbag section.

2994
02:30:25,680 --> 02:30:29,040
I'm watching Wil Wheaton and Jonathan Colton.

2995
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:32,380
There's some money questions that have to be answered in my life as I'm sure we all

2996
02:30:32,380 --> 02:30:35,720
have going on this year, but I swear I'm doing everything I can to come to PAX this year

2997
02:30:35,720 --> 02:30:37,520
because I miss it.

2998
02:30:37,520 --> 02:30:39,440
So this year you will know what I look like.

2999
02:30:39,440 --> 02:30:43,920
But last year for some reason, like the tickets sold out really quick and I couldn't find

3000
02:30:43,920 --> 02:30:46,000
any tickets for the three day passes.

3001
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:49,080
So I had to buy Friday, Saturday and Sunday all separate.

3002
02:30:49,080 --> 02:30:50,900
Yeah, that sucked.

3003
02:30:50,900 --> 02:30:52,360
Get in on it early this year.

3004
02:30:52,360 --> 02:30:54,500
Well, to what, to what do we really owe the call?

3005
02:30:54,500 --> 02:30:56,020
This call has been five years in the making.

3006
02:30:56,020 --> 02:30:57,020
What's on your mind?

3007
02:30:57,020 --> 02:31:01,400
Well, I, like I said, I was reminded that the show was on tonight because I was half

3008
02:31:01,400 --> 02:31:06,120
asleep and I was watching a movie called, uh, well it's a dumb movie, it's 17 again.

3009
02:31:06,120 --> 02:31:07,120
It's on Netflix.

3010
02:31:07,120 --> 02:31:09,200
I actually heard it was really good.

3011
02:31:09,200 --> 02:31:13,720
Yeah, well for the time, yeah, but anyways, they go into like this club and it's called

3012
02:31:13,720 --> 02:31:18,200
Orange Lounge and I was like, oh, Orange Lounge is on.

3013
02:31:18,200 --> 02:31:21,160
So I turned on the computer and here I am.

3014
02:31:21,160 --> 02:31:23,840
We're going to fucking sue their asses for jacking our name.

3015
02:31:23,840 --> 02:31:26,680
Yeah, and we'll do that when the Mobo Mogo people get us.

3016
02:31:26,680 --> 02:31:27,680
Oh yeah, that's right.

3017
02:31:27,680 --> 02:31:29,360
Konami, Konami could probably get us first.

3018
02:31:29,360 --> 02:31:31,480
But we're Orange Lounge Radio.

3019
02:31:31,480 --> 02:31:33,240
Yeah, there you go.

3020
02:31:33,240 --> 02:31:34,240
There's the radio part.

3021
02:31:34,240 --> 02:31:38,360
But anyways, my question was, um, why don't you like Terraria?

3022
02:31:38,360 --> 02:31:41,200
Oh God, I knew it.

3023
02:31:41,200 --> 02:31:44,440
Rabid, Rabid Minecrafty fans calling in.

3024
02:31:44,440 --> 02:31:45,840
Why do you hate our game?

3025
02:31:45,840 --> 02:31:46,840
I don't hate it.

3026
02:31:46,840 --> 02:31:49,560
I just, I didn't understand it at all.

3027
02:31:49,560 --> 02:31:50,960
Like I'm trying to play it.

3028
02:31:50,960 --> 02:31:52,200
Here's the thing.

3029
02:31:52,200 --> 02:31:55,180
I think you have to be an artistic person to get into those games.

3030
02:31:55,180 --> 02:31:59,960
And if you ever saw my art, which is ironic because I did the design thing for a little

3031
02:31:59,960 --> 02:32:00,960
bit.

3032
02:32:00,960 --> 02:32:04,280
Like, I don't know why I was able to do that, but like my drawing is terrible and just kind

3033
02:32:04,280 --> 02:32:07,440
of getting into that game, I was like, the hell am I supposed to be doing?

3034
02:32:07,440 --> 02:32:14,240
It was very weird to me to not have any tutorial, any objective, any anything.

3035
02:32:14,240 --> 02:32:18,640
And I realized for some people, that's the charm and I respect that.

3036
02:32:18,640 --> 02:32:21,520
But for me, I was just, I just felt so lost and overwhelmed.

3037
02:32:21,520 --> 02:32:23,080
I was like back to wow.

3038
02:32:23,080 --> 02:32:26,680
Yeah, in a way, wow was like that for me too.

3039
02:32:26,680 --> 02:32:31,000
Like I started, but I played for like two minutes because I was like, I don't know what

3040
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:32,000
to do.

3041
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:33,320
I don't know where to go.

3042
02:32:33,320 --> 02:32:34,880
When did you play wow?

3043
02:32:34,880 --> 02:32:35,880
Huh?

3044
02:32:35,880 --> 02:32:37,720
When did you play wow?

3045
02:32:37,720 --> 02:32:39,280
Was it recently or a long time ago?

3046
02:32:39,280 --> 02:32:41,360
It was like a year and a half ago.

3047
02:32:41,360 --> 02:32:42,360
They put it out with-

3048
02:32:42,360 --> 02:32:43,360
That was Cataclysm then.

3049
02:32:43,360 --> 02:32:44,360
Might've been.

3050
02:32:44,360 --> 02:32:46,640
With the Cataclysm expansion, they redid the beginner stuff.

3051
02:32:46,640 --> 02:32:48,640
So it might be a little better now.

3052
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:51,080
I hated wow before that and I really like it now.

3053
02:32:51,080 --> 02:32:52,080
Oh.

3054
02:32:52,080 --> 02:32:53,080
Yeah.

3055
02:32:53,080 --> 02:32:54,080
Yeah.

3056
02:32:54,080 --> 02:32:55,080
And plus I have no friends to talk to.

3057
02:32:55,080 --> 02:32:58,600
So it's just like, I'm walking around and like, I'll see a character and I'll talk to

3058
02:32:58,600 --> 02:33:01,600
him or at least I think I'm talking to him anyways.

3059
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:06,680
And like, I don't know, I just feel like I'm barging in or like, I'm like a stalker.

3060
02:33:06,680 --> 02:33:08,200
Like hey, look, there's a person.

3061
02:33:08,200 --> 02:33:10,520
So I go over there, talk and then they just walk away.

3062
02:33:10,520 --> 02:33:13,680
I'm like, oh, it's like real life.

3063
02:33:13,680 --> 02:33:14,680
It's weird.

3064
02:33:14,680 --> 02:33:15,680
People in wow don't want to talk.

3065
02:33:15,680 --> 02:33:16,680
Wait a minute.

3066
02:33:16,680 --> 02:33:20,040
You have no friends in wow, but you've got friends IRL, right?

3067
02:33:20,040 --> 02:33:21,440
No, not really.

3068
02:33:21,440 --> 02:33:22,440
No.

3069
02:33:22,440 --> 02:33:23,440
Well, cause I work night shift.

3070
02:33:23,440 --> 02:33:28,440
I have friends from school and stuff, but like when I want to hang out, everyone's sleeping.

3071
02:33:28,440 --> 02:33:32,880
He seems like he's mentally stable, at least from what we're getting in this hall.

3072
02:33:32,880 --> 02:33:33,880
I'll be your wow buddy.

3073
02:33:33,880 --> 02:33:35,360
We'll be, we'll be your friend.

3074
02:33:35,360 --> 02:33:36,680
You can add me on Steam.

3075
02:33:36,680 --> 02:33:40,520
Yeah, I have Steam too, but like I have no friends on Steam.

3076
02:33:40,520 --> 02:33:43,080
So it's like, there's no games to play with anyone.

3077
02:33:43,080 --> 02:33:47,320
Cause like I look on forums and stuff cause there's shows that have forums, but like every

3078
02:33:47,320 --> 02:33:50,600
now and then I'll look in the forum and there's trolls all the time.

3079
02:33:50,600 --> 02:33:51,600
And it's just like, wow.

3080
02:33:51,600 --> 02:33:52,600
No, no, no.

3081
02:33:52,600 --> 02:33:55,200
There's, there's a safe place on Steam for you.

3082
02:33:55,200 --> 02:33:58,400
You're going to go to orangelawntradio.com and on the left hand side, there's a little

3083
02:33:58,400 --> 02:34:00,440
box that says, or no, now it's in the upper right.

3084
02:34:00,440 --> 02:34:01,440
It says interact with us.

3085
02:34:01,440 --> 02:34:03,440
I don't even know my own damn site.

3086
02:34:03,440 --> 02:34:06,720
It's and there's a little picture of the Steam icon and that'll take you to the OLR Steam

3087
02:34:06,720 --> 02:34:07,720
community.

3088
02:34:07,720 --> 02:34:11,560
And we have one rule in the OLR Steam community and that is don't be a Dick.

3089
02:34:11,560 --> 02:34:12,600
Don't be a Dick.

3090
02:34:12,600 --> 02:34:16,320
So you're not going to get that in the, and if you get it, I want screenshots and you

3091
02:34:16,320 --> 02:34:18,020
report their asses to me.

3092
02:34:18,020 --> 02:34:21,720
And I will, Jamie, I will sick Jamie on them.

3093
02:34:21,720 --> 02:34:24,440
I will slap a bitch.

3094
02:34:24,440 --> 02:34:27,640
If you want to find me, I'm not there as dark Sakura and there's Kurosabasa.

3095
02:34:27,640 --> 02:34:28,640
Yeah.

3096
02:34:28,640 --> 02:34:29,640
So we're, we're there.

3097
02:34:29,640 --> 02:34:33,440
So, so feel free to add us and add, I'm sure there's folks in chat that'll be like, I like

3098
02:34:33,440 --> 02:34:36,280
Terraria, so I'll play it with you.

3099
02:34:36,280 --> 02:34:37,280
I didn't dislike it.

3100
02:34:37,280 --> 02:34:38,280
I just didn't get into it.

3101
02:34:38,280 --> 02:34:39,280
Before I let you go.

3102
02:34:39,280 --> 02:34:41,880
I got to know why do you like Terraria?

3103
02:34:41,880 --> 02:34:42,880
It's sway me.

3104
02:34:42,880 --> 02:34:43,880
Why should I be playing this game?

3105
02:34:43,880 --> 02:34:45,720
Well, the aesthetic is really nice.

3106
02:34:45,720 --> 02:34:50,520
I'm not really smart when it comes, well, I am smart, but I don't know, I don't understand

3107
02:34:50,520 --> 02:34:54,320
the whole eight bit and 16 bit, but it's got kind of like that same aesthetic.

3108
02:34:54,320 --> 02:34:57,560
So that's why I was wondering why you didn't like it because I know you like, you know,

3109
02:34:57,560 --> 02:35:01,360
older games and it's in two, it's two D, it's not three D. I played Minecraft.

3110
02:35:01,360 --> 02:35:06,760
I hated Minecraft because it's three D, but the world looks like crap and like you kind

3111
02:35:06,760 --> 02:35:11,840
of, it's like an RPG almost like you grind as in like mining or, and you can get better

3112
02:35:11,840 --> 02:35:15,000
pickaxes to pick faster.

3113
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:19,280
Later on, if you, uh, if you really want, you don't have to, there are boss battles.

3114
02:35:19,280 --> 02:35:22,260
There's three boss battles, but they already added a lot more.

3115
02:35:22,260 --> 02:35:26,760
So there's another boss battle, which adds more bosses later and they added more stuff

3116
02:35:26,760 --> 02:35:29,480
from previous versions of the game.

3117
02:35:29,480 --> 02:35:33,520
It's just, they keep adding onto it and it's just something very addictive about it.

3118
02:35:33,520 --> 02:35:37,540
And like me and my girlfriend, like, uh, sometimes on the weekends we'll play and we'll make

3119
02:35:37,540 --> 02:35:38,840
our own house together.

3120
02:35:38,840 --> 02:35:41,080
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, no, stop, stop.

3121
02:35:41,080 --> 02:35:43,140
You don't have friends, but you're getting laid.

3122
02:35:43,140 --> 02:35:45,120
You have a girlfriend, that's why you don't have friends.

3123
02:35:45,120 --> 02:35:46,120
That's why you don't have friends.

3124
02:35:46,120 --> 02:35:49,120
This is the woman saying it.

3125
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:50,120
No, I'm kidding.

3126
02:35:50,120 --> 02:35:51,120
I'm kidding.

3127
02:35:51,120 --> 02:35:52,120
Okay.

3128
02:35:52,120 --> 02:35:53,120
I'm glad.

3129
02:35:53,120 --> 02:35:54,120
I'm glad.

3130
02:35:54,120 --> 02:35:55,120
At least you're getting taken care of.

3131
02:35:55,120 --> 02:35:56,120
All right.

3132
02:35:56,120 --> 02:35:57,120
I'm getting taken care of in that way.

3133
02:35:57,120 --> 02:35:59,840
But you know, after a while when you live with some like two years, we've been together

3134
02:35:59,840 --> 02:36:06,240
for four, but like after a while you kind of want friends, you know, like, like, okay.

3135
02:36:06,240 --> 02:36:08,400
I want to go out on a double date once in a while.

3136
02:36:08,400 --> 02:36:13,080
Yeah, well we're not married, but if we are, is it this how it's going to be?

3137
02:36:13,080 --> 02:36:14,520
I'm going to tell you something.

3138
02:36:14,520 --> 02:36:18,900
When I moved out here from Alabama, all I had really was Dan and his friends and actually

3139
02:36:18,900 --> 02:36:23,000
one of his friends became my best friend, Becky.

3140
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:27,680
But I, it wasn't until I actually started venturing out to the arcades when we had good

3141
02:36:27,680 --> 02:36:33,320
ones and made friends on my own and found other groups that I could get involved with.

3142
02:36:33,320 --> 02:36:38,440
I am now like three people, like three or four people that I met at school are now really

3143
02:36:38,440 --> 02:36:39,440
good friends of mine.

3144
02:36:39,440 --> 02:36:44,360
And I will say this on Jamie's behalf, the best road trips that Jamie and Dan have ever

3145
02:36:44,360 --> 02:36:46,120
taken have been with me.

3146
02:36:46,120 --> 02:36:49,320
They really have cause Rob's heard us fight.

3147
02:36:49,320 --> 02:36:50,640
I will say this though.

3148
02:36:50,640 --> 02:36:54,160
Every time I go to like say, cause there's game works in Seattle.

3149
02:36:54,160 --> 02:36:59,300
Every time I go there and I played DDR, there's like this one weird person that like walks

3150
02:36:59,300 --> 02:37:03,000
up to the DDR machine because I'm pretty good at DDR.

3151
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:08,000
I can beat max 300 pretty easily, but like people will just like come up to me, just

3152
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:09,000
stare at me.

3153
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:13,880
They come on, they're like kind of follow me, you know, and like ask me questions and

3154
02:37:13,880 --> 02:37:14,880
like cling on.

3155
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:15,880
It's kind of weird.

3156
02:37:15,880 --> 02:37:17,360
So I kind of just stopped with that scene.

3157
02:37:17,360 --> 02:37:20,960
Did you say they ask you questions and cling on?

3158
02:37:20,960 --> 02:37:21,960
They cling on.

3159
02:37:21,960 --> 02:37:26,600
Oh, cause I was going to say you should just reply KA-BLAH.

3160
02:37:26,600 --> 02:37:27,600
Yeah.

3161
02:37:27,600 --> 02:37:29,240
Uh, I just get weirded out.

3162
02:37:29,240 --> 02:37:30,240
That's it.

3163
02:37:30,240 --> 02:37:31,240
I would get weirded out too.

3164
02:37:31,240 --> 02:37:34,760
Uh, you know, there's, there's ways to approach people and like stalking them is not one of

3165
02:37:34,760 --> 02:37:38,960
them, but it's an, you know, every fan scene has their very socially awkward.

3166
02:37:38,960 --> 02:37:40,520
People in it.

3167
02:37:40,520 --> 02:37:44,880
And let's be real, DDR has its fair share of socially awkward people.

3168
02:37:44,880 --> 02:37:50,100
Um, and, and so, you know, I, I don't know if there's an easy way to handle it.

3169
02:37:50,100 --> 02:37:54,320
Like you can, you can either be nice, you know, if you want to, or you can just be like,

3170
02:37:54,320 --> 02:37:57,800
okay, you're like violating some kind of code here and you gotta, you gotta like, bro, you

3171
02:37:57,800 --> 02:37:58,800
gotta go.

3172
02:37:58,800 --> 02:37:59,800
Yeah.

3173
02:37:59,800 --> 02:38:00,800
But that's the thing.

3174
02:38:00,800 --> 02:38:02,040
I don't say that to people cause, um, I'm kind of nice and I don't want to get in those

3175
02:38:02,040 --> 02:38:03,040
situations.

3176
02:38:03,040 --> 02:38:04,040
Yeah.

3177
02:38:04,040 --> 02:38:07,560
You know, if I was in that position, I'd be like, Oh, this guy's a dick.

3178
02:38:07,560 --> 02:38:08,560
Yeah.

3179
02:38:08,560 --> 02:38:09,560
I don't really do that.

3180
02:38:09,560 --> 02:38:11,120
Just like kind of brush them off lightly.

3181
02:38:11,120 --> 02:38:14,120
Like like I smoke, but I don't smoke that much.

3182
02:38:14,120 --> 02:38:18,640
So if someone follows me, I know that they don't smoke cause you could tell a smoker

3183
02:38:18,640 --> 02:38:19,640
from a non-smoker.

3184
02:38:19,640 --> 02:38:20,640
Sure.

3185
02:38:20,640 --> 02:38:21,640
So I'll just smoke.

3186
02:38:21,640 --> 02:38:27,920
It's kind of like my repellent, but like, like bees, it's kind of like smoke.

3187
02:38:27,920 --> 02:38:30,040
You throw them on bees cause you don't want them to sting you.

3188
02:38:30,040 --> 02:38:31,040
So they just run away.

3189
02:38:31,040 --> 02:38:32,040
Wait a minute.

3190
02:38:32,040 --> 02:38:33,480
You're a smoker and you can beat max 300.

3191
02:38:33,480 --> 02:38:34,480
Yeah.

3192
02:38:34,480 --> 02:38:35,480
That's a pretty big achievement.

3193
02:38:35,480 --> 02:38:38,360
I mean, I gotta say, I'm not going to judge you for the smoking thing cause I smoked for

3194
02:38:38,360 --> 02:38:42,000
years, but I would have never been able to beat max 300 as a smoker.

3195
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:43,920
Well, yeah, it's pretty easy.

3196
02:38:43,920 --> 02:38:48,200
I mean, like if you smoke and you regularly exercise, it's you get used to it.

3197
02:38:48,200 --> 02:38:49,200
All right.

3198
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:50,200
All right.

3199
02:38:50,200 --> 02:38:51,200
Well, um, you know what?

3200
02:38:51,200 --> 02:38:56,560
I gotta let you go so we can get more calls, but, um, I, I will, I will give Terraria a

3201
02:38:56,560 --> 02:38:59,360
second chance and seriously go to the steam community.

3202
02:38:59,360 --> 02:39:01,440
And I see people giving out their name and chat right now.

3203
02:39:01,440 --> 02:39:02,440
All right.

3204
02:39:02,440 --> 02:39:04,480
You can have people to play Terraria with.

3205
02:39:04,480 --> 02:39:05,480
All right.

3206
02:39:05,480 --> 02:39:06,480
All right.

3207
02:39:06,480 --> 02:39:11,400
So do not quit cause if you quit, I'm going to find you in LA or wherever you are, Sacramento,

3208
02:39:11,400 --> 02:39:12,400
but that's all you get.

3209
02:39:12,400 --> 02:39:14,580
All right.

3210
02:39:14,580 --> 02:39:16,080
It's like Seattle, but less rain.

3211
02:39:16,080 --> 02:39:17,080
All right.

3212
02:39:17,080 --> 02:39:18,080
Yeah.

3213
02:39:18,080 --> 02:39:19,080
All right.

3214
02:39:19,080 --> 02:39:20,080
Later.

3215
02:39:20,080 --> 02:39:21,080
Later.

3216
02:39:21,080 --> 02:39:22,080
That was a fun call.

3217
02:39:22,080 --> 02:39:23,080
I let it go on a little longer.

3218
02:39:23,080 --> 02:39:25,280
Usually I try to keep it in five minutes, but Hey, he was a long time listener.

3219
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:26,840
I spelled mine out in chat.

3220
02:39:26,840 --> 02:39:30,880
So one eight seven seven game OLR or username on Skype is orange Laundraido.

3221
02:39:30,880 --> 02:39:33,760
By the way, I just want to say with that last call, I'm not endorsing smoking.

3222
02:39:33,760 --> 02:39:37,360
It's just, I'm not going to be that guy that's like, you need to quit smoking right now.

3223
02:39:37,360 --> 02:39:38,780
Trust me smokers.

3224
02:39:38,780 --> 02:39:43,060
They know the choice they're making and I've heard the pros and cons and you usually just

3225
02:39:43,060 --> 02:39:47,080
have to have something happen where you're like, okay, I'm going to quit.

3226
02:39:47,080 --> 02:39:50,640
So that's what happened to me is finally, I just hit a point where something happened

3227
02:39:50,640 --> 02:39:52,000
and I was like, you know what?

3228
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:53,440
I'm now going to quit.

3229
02:39:53,440 --> 02:39:58,480
So anyhow, let's move on with more calls higher on orange Laundraido.

3230
02:39:58,480 --> 02:39:59,480
Who's this?

3231
02:39:59,480 --> 02:40:01,480
Hey, this is hackdeft.

3232
02:40:01,480 --> 02:40:03,840
Our favorite Mexican.

3233
02:40:03,840 --> 02:40:05,160
Yeah.

3234
02:40:05,160 --> 02:40:08,100
Actually we have two or three Mexicans that listen, so I shouldn't play favorites.

3235
02:40:08,100 --> 02:40:13,040
So one of our favorite Mexicans, what's on your mind, buddy?

3236
02:40:13,040 --> 02:40:18,920
Uh, I just wanted to talk about, uh, the article you, uh, you were talking about, uh, video

3237
02:40:18,920 --> 02:40:22,880
game music being in the hall of fame.

3238
02:40:22,880 --> 02:40:23,880
Yes.

3239
02:40:23,880 --> 02:40:24,880
The classic music in the hall of fame.

3240
02:40:24,880 --> 02:40:26,600
What'd you want to say about it?

3241
02:40:26,600 --> 02:40:33,400
Well, basically you talk about if, whether it should be recognized as classical music

3242
02:40:33,400 --> 02:40:37,160
or it should be recognized there in the hall of fame.

3243
02:40:37,160 --> 02:40:44,240
And I think, and this is a very strong opinion of mine that it should be, uh, uh, recognized

3244
02:40:44,240 --> 02:40:48,000
as music by everyone.

3245
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:49,000
Well absolutely.

3246
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,360
But what about classical music?

3247
02:40:51,360 --> 02:40:53,360
That's that's the key thing.

3248
02:40:53,360 --> 02:40:55,720
Well, that's the thing.

3249
02:40:55,720 --> 02:41:04,120
I don't consider it, consider it, uh, as classical music at least it, uh, because, well, you're

3250
02:41:04,120 --> 02:41:11,000
talking about genres and all that and video game music is more, uh, how do you say it?

3251
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:12,000
Contemporary?

3252
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:13,000
More modern?

3253
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,740
Yeah, I agree with you.

3254
02:41:15,740 --> 02:41:21,880
So as classical music, I don't think it should be, uh, well, characterized.

3255
02:41:21,880 --> 02:41:29,960
So, uh, so like that, I don't think so, but it should definitely be recognized.

3256
02:41:29,960 --> 02:41:32,120
All right.

3257
02:41:32,120 --> 02:41:37,280
Well, I mean, it's just, I think there's a lot of like contemporary classical, which

3258
02:41:37,280 --> 02:41:42,240
is a really weird term, but I guess it's like, you know, um, when you kind of write your

3259
02:41:42,240 --> 02:41:45,600
music with that classical sound and you're influenced with that.

3260
02:41:45,600 --> 02:41:46,600
And I don't know, I get that.

3261
02:41:46,600 --> 02:41:47,600
I get that sense.

3262
02:41:47,600 --> 02:41:52,360
I think it's very, I think that's why things like Dear Friends work is that they feel like

3263
02:41:52,360 --> 02:41:58,440
a night out at the orchestra, but it's music I killed monsters to.

3264
02:41:58,440 --> 02:42:06,680
Well, the thing with me is that classical music is more like Beethoven, Mozart, uh,

3265
02:42:06,680 --> 02:42:08,480
things like that.

3266
02:42:08,480 --> 02:42:15,360
And well, while, while some music, like, especially in Final Fantasy, that is heavily orchestrated.

3267
02:42:15,360 --> 02:42:20,480
Well, it sounds like classical music, but it, but it isn't, it isn't classical.

3268
02:42:20,480 --> 02:42:22,320
It isn't a classical piece.

3269
02:42:22,320 --> 02:42:27,440
It's an orchestrated, uh, modern piece, but it isn't classical.

3270
02:42:27,440 --> 02:42:28,440
Okay.

3271
02:42:28,440 --> 02:42:29,440
Okay.

3272
02:42:29,440 --> 02:42:34,520
So maybe they're just, and I'm sure there's a better word to define this genre of music.

3273
02:42:34,520 --> 02:42:35,960
You know what it makes me think of?

3274
02:42:35,960 --> 02:42:38,880
It makes me think of fusion, like Vanessa May.

3275
02:42:38,880 --> 02:42:39,880
Okay.

3276
02:42:39,880 --> 02:42:44,120
And what, like, if I were to look in a CD store, wouldn't they, that'd be like adult

3277
02:42:44,120 --> 02:42:46,160
contemporary, but then that makes me think like Celine Dion.

3278
02:42:46,160 --> 02:42:47,800
It would be under instrumental.

3279
02:42:47,800 --> 02:42:48,800
Yeah.

3280
02:42:48,800 --> 02:42:49,800
Okay.

3281
02:42:49,800 --> 02:42:50,800
Okay.

3282
02:42:50,800 --> 02:42:53,920
Or, uh, sometimes you find them under world music sometimes.

3283
02:42:53,920 --> 02:42:56,720
Do you think that if this gets enough votes, Oh, go ahead.

3284
02:42:56,720 --> 02:42:58,720
I was gonna say one more place you find video game music.

3285
02:42:58,720 --> 02:43:02,080
There is under soundtrack sections cause I find it all the time at dimple.

3286
02:43:02,080 --> 02:43:03,080
True.

3287
02:43:03,080 --> 02:43:08,400
Do you think if there is, Oh, I like this comment from Black Wolf in our chat at chat.orangesoundsradio.com.

3288
02:43:08,400 --> 02:43:11,920
Classical is a style of music, not an era of music.

3289
02:43:11,920 --> 02:43:13,300
Maybe a different way of thinking about it.

3290
02:43:13,300 --> 02:43:19,720
Maybe you're thinking about classical in the, um, era sense, but, um, all this stuff aside,

3291
02:43:19,720 --> 02:43:24,160
what, what it is or what it isn't, we just know, you know, we like this music.

3292
02:43:24,160 --> 02:43:31,180
Do you think if it wins the poll, do you think that the UK radio station will ultimately

3293
02:43:31,180 --> 02:43:36,620
recognize it or do you think they'll reject it as like, Oh, it's these silly gamer fan

3294
02:43:36,620 --> 02:43:40,160
boys are doing this and we're just going to throw their votes out?

3295
02:43:40,160 --> 02:43:46,680
Well, they may be recognized it and all because, well, the people voted for it.

3296
02:43:46,680 --> 02:43:54,520
So I don't think why it shouldn't be, but like I said, and maybe Black Wolf has a point,

3297
02:43:54,520 --> 02:44:02,200
but like I said, it, it isn't classical in the sense that it, it hasn't like, uh, like

3298
02:44:02,200 --> 02:44:04,080
I said, it isn't very classical.

3299
02:44:04,080 --> 02:44:10,880
It isn't something from the 18, 18 hundreds or the 17 hundreds.

3300
02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:11,880
It's modern.

3301
02:44:11,880 --> 02:44:19,640
It's something like as of recent and then there's very, and there's other, uh, uh, outside

3302
02:44:19,640 --> 02:44:27,040
of video games that, that also have, uh, classical pieces or that sound classical, but I don't

3303
02:44:27,040 --> 02:44:33,360
at least, uh, in my opinion, and I know that Black Wolf is a classic, uh, as a musician

3304
02:44:33,360 --> 02:44:36,040
and it's trained for that, but this is my opinion.

3305
02:44:36,040 --> 02:44:39,040
And like I said, it isn't for me.

3306
02:44:39,040 --> 02:44:40,040
Okay.

3307
02:44:40,040 --> 02:44:41,040
That's, that's fair.

3308
02:44:41,040 --> 02:44:42,040
That's fair.

3309
02:44:42,040 --> 02:44:45,960
Uh, and, uh, JV Mon in our chat room gives a term that should have been fricking obvious,

3310
02:44:45,960 --> 02:44:47,960
orchestral music.

3311
02:44:47,960 --> 02:44:49,160
That's a word I should have thought of.

3312
02:44:49,160 --> 02:44:50,160
All right.

3313
02:44:50,160 --> 02:44:52,900
Let me take this a completely different direction and then we'll end this call active since

3314
02:44:52,900 --> 02:44:56,180
you brought up music and all this and what you like and so forth.

3315
02:44:56,180 --> 02:44:59,560
What is your favorite video game music ever?

3316
02:44:59,560 --> 02:45:00,560
No.

3317
02:45:00,560 --> 02:45:08,440
This, that is a very tough question for me, especially since I'll make a little plug here

3318
02:45:08,440 --> 02:45:14,400
and well, and I love and I love, sorry, I love that song.

3319
02:45:14,400 --> 02:45:15,400
I love that.

3320
02:45:15,400 --> 02:45:18,320
The music articles we do for all are right.

3321
02:45:18,320 --> 02:45:25,100
Me and Dr. Zuya, we try to pick at least in my, in my, um, personal perspective, I tried

3322
02:45:25,100 --> 02:45:29,440
to pick something that is, that it isn't that recognized.

3323
02:45:29,440 --> 02:45:40,160
But if I had to pick one soundtrack that I really, really like, it should be, and I think

3324
02:45:40,160 --> 02:45:48,880
I may, I maybe, uh, maybe I, I will think about another, but in the future, but, uh,

3325
02:45:48,880 --> 02:45:55,320
I think the Silent Hill 2, uh, soundtrack is like awesome.

3326
02:45:55,320 --> 02:45:56,320
Interesting direction.

3327
02:45:56,320 --> 02:45:57,320
No, it's great.

3328
02:45:57,320 --> 02:45:58,320
It is.

3329
02:45:58,320 --> 02:45:59,320
That's a great pick.

3330
02:45:59,320 --> 02:46:00,320
Interesting direction.

3331
02:46:00,320 --> 02:46:04,440
I, that's not one I usually hear people say is their absolute favorite, but it's really

3332
02:46:04,440 --> 02:46:05,440
damn good.

3333
02:46:05,440 --> 02:46:07,440
So I, I'm not surprised to hear that at all.

3334
02:46:07,440 --> 02:46:09,360
Akira Yamaoka is great.

3335
02:46:09,360 --> 02:46:10,360
He's a great guy.

3336
02:46:10,360 --> 02:46:11,360
All right.

3337
02:46:11,360 --> 02:46:16,760
You know, cause like my, one of my favorite composers, if not the best in video game music

3338
02:46:16,760 --> 02:46:18,400
and definitely not something I would call classical.

3339
02:46:18,400 --> 02:46:19,400
All right.

3340
02:46:19,400 --> 02:46:20,400
Definitely.

3341
02:46:20,400 --> 02:46:21,400
All right.

3342
02:46:21,400 --> 02:46:23,800
On the same note, I actually prefer Silent Hill 3, that soundtrack.

3343
02:46:23,800 --> 02:46:25,440
Yeah, but still it's all, it's all Akira.

3344
02:46:25,440 --> 02:46:26,440
That's really good.

3345
02:46:26,440 --> 02:46:27,440
Yeah.

3346
02:46:27,440 --> 02:46:28,440
All right.

3347
02:46:28,440 --> 02:46:30,440
We'll have one more call in for the end of the show, but have a great night.

3348
02:46:30,440 --> 02:46:31,440
Okay.

3349
02:46:31,440 --> 02:46:32,440
You too.

3350
02:46:32,440 --> 02:46:33,440
All right.

3351
02:46:33,440 --> 02:46:34,440
Thanks buddy.

3352
02:46:34,440 --> 02:46:35,440
Uh, quick, one more quick call.

3353
02:46:35,440 --> 02:46:38,760
We cannot make time for when it we're running a little long, but we, we took a extended

3354
02:46:38,760 --> 02:46:43,760
break and then, um, we had a long call there to start, but I'll try to squeeze in one more

3355
02:46:43,760 --> 02:46:44,760
quick call.

3356
02:46:44,760 --> 02:46:45,760
One eight seven seven game.

3357
02:46:45,760 --> 02:46:47,960
O L R or a username on Skype is orange launch radio.

3358
02:46:47,960 --> 02:46:51,120
If you want to give us a call, uh, Twitter topics, I got to get through those real quick.

3359
02:46:51,120 --> 02:46:54,240
I only got through the first one, uh, tiger class and in a couple of quick ones, I'll

3360
02:46:54,240 --> 02:46:58,240
try to get out here quick, quick BAFTA nominations, which we missed.

3361
02:46:58,240 --> 02:47:02,400
Talking about on the show, BAFTA is the British Academy film and television arts.

3362
02:47:02,400 --> 02:47:07,560
They have, uh, released the nominations for the 2012 video game awards, which honors the

3363
02:47:07,560 --> 02:47:13,160
top games from 2011, the year before, and they've nominated in various categories, action,

3364
02:47:13,160 --> 02:47:14,160
artistic achievement.

3365
02:47:14,160 --> 02:47:19,640
I don't really have time to read all of these games, uh, but I will say quickly the game

3366
02:47:19,640 --> 02:47:25,700
award of the year, Batman, Arkham city, battlefield three, call of duty, modern warfare three

3367
02:47:25,700 --> 02:47:30,280
FIFA 12 LA noir Minecraft portal to elder scrolls, Skyrim, legend of Zelda, Skyward

3368
02:47:30,280 --> 02:47:33,920
sword and uncharted three phone higher on orange launch radio.

3369
02:47:33,920 --> 02:47:34,920
Who's this?

3370
02:47:34,920 --> 02:47:36,720
Hey, this is Bobby black Wolf.

3371
02:47:36,720 --> 02:47:38,240
Oh, Hey Bobby.

3372
02:47:38,240 --> 02:47:40,920
What could you ever be calling in about what's on your mind?

3373
02:47:40,920 --> 02:47:47,080
So Wikipedia says classical music is the art music produced in or rooted in the traditions

3374
02:47:47,080 --> 02:47:50,680
of Western liturgical and secular music.

3375
02:47:50,680 --> 02:47:55,520
So it's all about the style and not necessarily when it was composed because Leonard Bernstein

3376
02:47:55,520 --> 02:47:59,720
was a great classical composer and he was born this century.

3377
02:47:59,720 --> 02:48:05,160
So does that mean that like, uh, kabuki theater music would not be considered classical because

3378
02:48:05,160 --> 02:48:07,160
it's Eastern.

3379
02:48:07,160 --> 02:48:11,200
There's um, let's see, basically classical is mostly Western music.

3380
02:48:11,200 --> 02:48:12,200
Yeah.

3381
02:48:12,200 --> 02:48:16,920
According to this, a lot of the terminology here, it's usually like American or European.

3382
02:48:16,920 --> 02:48:18,480
Where would you find something like Brian Eno?

3383
02:48:18,480 --> 02:48:22,080
Is that classical or is that considered like new age?

3384
02:48:22,080 --> 02:48:23,080
Probably new age.

3385
02:48:23,080 --> 02:48:31,140
Cause I've played both classical and I play new age music as have I and jazz.

3386
02:48:31,140 --> 02:48:32,600
So Bobby, what do you say?

3387
02:48:32,600 --> 02:48:36,040
Of course, Bobby, I gotta, I gotta let you plug your show here, which you're on before

3388
02:48:36,040 --> 02:48:38,880
us at all games radio, of course, Sunday nights.

3389
02:48:38,880 --> 02:48:44,600
But um, what do you think about the whole trying to push for video game recognition

3390
02:48:44,600 --> 02:48:47,800
on a classical music station?

3391
02:48:47,800 --> 02:48:52,240
I think it's great because I mean, and here's the thing, like everybody's like, Oh, well

3392
02:48:52,240 --> 02:48:56,080
that, that wasn't even the best song in final fantasy seven and blah, blah, blah.

3393
02:48:56,080 --> 02:48:57,120
Here's the thing.

3394
02:48:57,120 --> 02:49:04,160
You need to get the majority to agree with you and to be able to get something recognized

3395
02:49:04,160 --> 02:49:05,160
on that platform.

3396
02:49:05,160 --> 02:49:11,560
And you know, yeah, Aerith's theme, you know, was created on a synth and everything, but

3397
02:49:11,560 --> 02:49:17,960
the more friends CD version, I know the concert sucked, but that CD version, if you play that

3398
02:49:17,960 --> 02:49:21,320
for somebody who doesn't know it's from a video game, they will think it's one of the

3399
02:49:21,320 --> 02:49:25,200
most beautiful classical pieces they've heard in a long time.

3400
02:49:25,200 --> 02:49:29,960
And that's really the testament to that piece.

3401
02:49:29,960 --> 02:49:33,760
And yes, it's, if somebody doesn't know it's from a video game, they will think it is a

3402
02:49:33,760 --> 02:49:35,440
classical piece.

3403
02:49:35,440 --> 02:49:36,440
I agree.

3404
02:49:36,440 --> 02:49:40,060
You've got to rally the troops behind one thing or it's not going to work.

3405
02:49:40,060 --> 02:49:41,640
You're going to, you're going to divide it all up.

3406
02:49:41,640 --> 02:49:46,360
So, you know, I think they just kind of had to say, you know what, this is the song that

3407
02:49:46,360 --> 02:49:49,680
had a huge moment that was notable in gaming.

3408
02:49:49,680 --> 02:49:50,680
We're going to go here.

3409
02:49:50,680 --> 02:49:55,400
You know, I can see that despite how, you know, whatever song from Final Fantasy 7 or

3410
02:49:55,400 --> 02:49:57,240
even Final Fantasy 6 may be your favorite.

3411
02:49:57,240 --> 02:50:01,840
Like if it were me picking a Final Fantasy song, I think Terra's theme from Final Fantasy

3412
02:50:01,840 --> 02:50:04,360
6 is like the greatest Final Fantasy song there ever was.

3413
02:50:04,360 --> 02:50:06,840
I think the marching version of that is the best.

3414
02:50:06,840 --> 02:50:07,840
Love it.

3415
02:50:07,840 --> 02:50:11,640
Well, I actually did, I did a little more digging on this and actually the Aerith's

3416
02:50:11,640 --> 02:50:14,240
theme that's in Final Fantasy 7 is not eligible.

3417
02:50:14,240 --> 02:50:17,200
Oh no, why is that?

3418
02:50:17,200 --> 02:50:19,920
Here's why, because it was made for a synth.

3419
02:50:19,920 --> 02:50:20,920
Oh.

3420
02:50:20,920 --> 02:50:25,040
But, you can nominate one of the later versions.

3421
02:50:25,040 --> 02:50:30,200
So, you know, basically what they're nominating is that it was rearranged for an orchestra.

3422
02:50:30,200 --> 02:50:35,320
That is also applicable, but also that Facebook fan page is not just concentrating on Aerith's

3423
02:50:35,320 --> 02:50:36,320
theme.

3424
02:50:36,320 --> 02:50:37,320
That was the first one.

3425
02:50:37,320 --> 02:50:42,400
They actually, like every week, they're putting up a new classical piece from video games

3426
02:50:42,400 --> 02:50:47,600
that you can also put in, like Dragonborn from Skyrim is currently also, they're trying

3427
02:50:47,600 --> 02:50:49,000
to get people to vote for that.

3428
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:50,760
They just want something in there.

3429
02:50:50,760 --> 02:50:54,360
Aerith's theme is just the one that's going to be the most popular that the most people

3430
02:50:54,360 --> 02:50:57,080
are going to go into.

3431
02:50:57,080 --> 02:51:03,920
But they've got several suggestions of pieces that do fit the criteria that Classic FM has

3432
02:51:03,920 --> 02:51:04,920
set.

3433
02:51:04,920 --> 02:51:10,760
They actually do have rules and the original PlayStation 1 version of Aerith's theme does

3434
02:51:10,760 --> 02:51:11,760
not count.

3435
02:51:11,760 --> 02:51:15,760
I gotta give you credit, Dark Soccer, you kinda were on that track earlier when you

3436
02:51:15,760 --> 02:51:16,760
were talking about that.

3437
02:51:16,760 --> 02:51:17,760
So I gotta give you props.

3438
02:51:17,760 --> 02:51:18,760
Thank you.

3439
02:51:18,760 --> 02:51:21,520
I thought you brought that up earlier.

3440
02:51:21,520 --> 02:51:23,360
You know, some great suggestions from our chatroom too.

3441
02:51:23,360 --> 02:51:28,040
JV Monn says the simple and clean orchestral version is amazing.

3442
02:51:28,040 --> 02:51:31,520
That was one of the other ones that they had suggested on that same Facebook page.

3443
02:51:31,520 --> 02:51:36,800
The story that Tommy T. tells about that, and I think he told it on your show and ours

3444
02:51:36,800 --> 02:51:40,840
about how Disney didn't want to give the rights to the visuals, but then they heard it and

3445
02:51:40,840 --> 02:51:45,000
not a dry eye in the house.

3446
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:46,120
That's a powerful piece of music.

3447
02:51:46,120 --> 02:51:47,120
It really is.

3448
02:51:47,120 --> 02:51:52,480
Yeah, so I mean, that's the thing is that, you know, classical music is not just an era.

3449
02:51:52,480 --> 02:51:55,620
People hear the term classical and think, oh, it's just Bach.

3450
02:51:55,620 --> 02:51:58,560
It's just, you know, it's just Mozart.

3451
02:51:58,560 --> 02:52:06,120
All right, Bobby, before we let you go, we can't keep this going all night because we

3452
02:52:06,120 --> 02:52:07,120
probably could.

3453
02:52:07,120 --> 02:52:09,560
But before we let you go, I gotta put you on the spot too.

3454
02:52:09,560 --> 02:52:14,960
What is your favorite video game music of all time, or at least one of them?

3455
02:52:14,960 --> 02:52:16,960
I should have thought about this before I called in.

3456
02:52:16,960 --> 02:52:22,720
You know, you might not have heard us ask deafness because I was trying to speed dial

3457
02:52:22,720 --> 02:52:23,720
in.

3458
02:52:23,720 --> 02:52:24,720
That's all right.

3459
02:52:24,720 --> 02:52:25,720
Because we asked him too.

3460
02:52:25,720 --> 02:52:28,180
What was your one of your favorites?

3461
02:52:28,180 --> 02:52:29,180
You know what?

3462
02:52:29,180 --> 02:52:32,640
I mean, and it's going to sound kind of because we've been talking about it because I mean,

3463
02:52:32,640 --> 02:52:39,440
I've kind of and the reason I'm kind of prepping this up is because one of the 21st century

3464
02:52:39,440 --> 02:52:42,440
orchestra is what we call ourselves because we don't like the term new age.

3465
02:52:42,440 --> 02:52:47,360
We've been kicking around a video game concert idea because we used to do movie stuff and

3466
02:52:47,360 --> 02:52:51,840
we've been kicking around doing video game stuff and they've put me in charge of kind

3467
02:52:51,840 --> 02:52:56,260
of, you know, putting in what we're going to what we would do in this hypothetical concert

3468
02:52:56,260 --> 02:52:59,700
that's actually probably not going to happen for years now.

3469
02:52:59,700 --> 02:53:03,920
And actually the one, the piece that would be the most emotional and the most gratifying

3470
02:53:03,920 --> 02:53:08,820
to play and to be a part of is actually Aerith's Theme.

3471
02:53:08,820 --> 02:53:15,760
The actual, specifically the More Friends version from the CD that's the fully orchestral

3472
02:53:15,760 --> 02:53:17,760
and everything.

3473
02:53:17,760 --> 02:53:20,880
That's actually the first time I shed a tear in a video game.

3474
02:53:20,880 --> 02:53:21,880
Me too.

3475
02:53:21,880 --> 02:53:22,880
No.

3476
02:53:22,880 --> 02:53:27,680
And so it's very powerful from that aspect and the way it would be phrased in the concert

3477
02:53:27,680 --> 02:53:33,040
is because I know that Square Enix doesn't let people use their footage in concerts that

3478
02:53:33,040 --> 02:53:34,040
aren't their own.

3479
02:53:34,040 --> 02:53:35,280
I know all about that.

3480
02:53:35,280 --> 02:53:39,600
So it would be kind of phrased around, can a video game make you cry?

3481
02:53:39,600 --> 02:53:43,520
And basically, you know, we'd be showing like fan art and stuff of Aerith's and of that

3482
02:53:43,520 --> 02:53:48,320
scene with that piece and that was going to be kind of the emotional high point of this

3483
02:53:48,320 --> 02:53:49,920
theoretical concert.

3484
02:53:49,920 --> 02:53:54,360
So I'm really going to go with Aerith's Theme just because of what it means.

3485
02:53:54,360 --> 02:53:58,540
I don't blame you one bit just because it's, there's a reason why it's newsworthy right

3486
02:53:58,540 --> 02:53:59,540
now.

3487
02:53:59,540 --> 02:54:00,540
Absolutely.

3488
02:54:00,540 --> 02:54:06,240
All right, well Bobby, quick, plug your stuff before we let you go.

3489
02:54:06,240 --> 02:54:08,280
Contrary to popular belief, I do not hate Act Deft.

3490
02:54:08,280 --> 02:54:13,800
So if you want to listen to somebody who does not actually hate Act Deft, I'm on, before

3491
02:54:13,800 --> 02:54:18,000
you guys at 8 p.m. Eastern, 5 p.m. Pacific, you're on All Games Radio and the last 10

3492
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:22,240
minutes of my show were actually me, you know, fucking around with OLR.

3493
02:54:22,240 --> 02:54:23,240
So it's a good time.

3494
02:54:23,240 --> 02:54:26,400
Oh, you can say the F word on our show.

3495
02:54:26,400 --> 02:54:27,400
You get to swear.

3496
02:54:27,400 --> 02:54:29,880
It's a side of Bobby you don't normally get to see.

3497
02:54:29,880 --> 02:54:32,820
I'm sorry I said bitch on your show.

3498
02:54:32,820 --> 02:54:33,820
That's okay.

3499
02:54:33,820 --> 02:54:34,820
It's okay.

3500
02:54:34,820 --> 02:54:37,080
You will get the podcast up again soon, right Bobby?

3501
02:54:37,080 --> 02:54:38,080
I hope so, yeah.

3502
02:54:38,080 --> 02:54:39,080
We miss him.

3503
02:54:39,080 --> 02:54:40,080
All right.

3504
02:54:40,080 --> 02:54:41,080
All right.

3505
02:54:41,080 --> 02:54:42,080
Bobby Black Wolf, everybody.

3506
02:54:42,080 --> 02:54:43,080
Thank you so much for calling in.

3507
02:54:43,080 --> 02:54:44,080
Have a good one.

3508
02:54:44,080 --> 02:54:45,080
Capcom fires you.

3509
02:54:45,080 --> 02:54:46,080
You're fired too.

3510
02:54:46,080 --> 02:54:48,760
No, hire, hire.

3511
02:54:48,760 --> 02:54:49,760
Need to hire.

3512
02:54:49,760 --> 02:54:50,760
You're fired.

3513
02:54:50,760 --> 02:54:51,760
All right.

3514
02:54:51,760 --> 02:54:53,840
Anyhow, all right, we got to wrap it up.

3515
02:54:53,840 --> 02:54:57,960
I know there's some folks that wanted to call and get through, but guys, we have an important

3516
02:54:57,960 --> 02:54:59,160
live thing happening tonight.

3517
02:54:59,160 --> 02:55:01,120
We got to get to it before it's like one in the morning.

3518
02:55:01,120 --> 02:55:02,920
So I got to close up the Skype line.

3519
02:55:02,920 --> 02:55:07,600
If you didn't get through, tweet us, email us, yell at us in all caps and chat.

3520
02:55:07,600 --> 02:55:08,600
No, don't do that.

3521
02:55:08,600 --> 02:55:10,400
But you know ways to get in touch with us.

3522
02:55:10,400 --> 02:55:11,400
Please do.

3523
02:55:11,400 --> 02:55:14,240
We want to know your thoughts and we'll share them next week on the show.

3524
02:55:14,240 --> 02:55:16,520
In the meantime, we've got to wrap things up quickly.

3525
02:55:16,520 --> 02:55:18,480
One more tweet here from Tiger Claw.

3526
02:55:18,480 --> 02:55:21,520
Quickly, quickly read this.

3527
02:55:21,520 --> 02:55:28,440
Robota Vengeance pits robots against genetically modified dinosaurs.

3528
02:55:28,440 --> 02:55:32,840
It was actually created by an Academy Award winner, Doug Chang.

3529
02:55:32,840 --> 02:55:35,600
He was the lead designer on Star Wars episode one and two.

3530
02:55:35,600 --> 02:55:39,160
We'll say what you will about those movies, but at least the special effects were really

3531
02:55:39,160 --> 02:55:40,720
good for their time.

3532
02:55:40,720 --> 02:55:46,120
They want to do it as an iOS game that's a full scale rival to Infinity Blade.

3533
02:55:46,120 --> 02:55:47,120
I guess.

3534
02:55:47,120 --> 02:55:48,120
Oh, here's the deal.

3535
02:55:48,120 --> 02:55:49,120
Here it is.

3536
02:55:49,120 --> 02:55:50,120
It's another Kickstarter.

3537
02:55:50,120 --> 02:55:52,080
They're trying to raise $100,000 to get Robota.

3538
02:55:52,080 --> 02:55:53,440
Oh, boy.

3539
02:55:53,440 --> 02:55:56,240
See, what did I say last week?

3540
02:55:56,240 --> 02:55:58,720
Nora's box has been opened.

3541
02:55:58,720 --> 02:56:01,840
This is going to be interesting, but I will say it does sound pretty cool.

3542
02:56:01,840 --> 02:56:02,840
The little concept.

3543
02:56:02,840 --> 02:56:09,120
Pre-order your game now by securing your vested share in the development of this game.

3544
02:56:09,120 --> 02:56:10,680
That's how it's going to be.

3545
02:56:10,680 --> 02:56:12,080
All right.

3546
02:56:12,080 --> 02:56:14,960
That's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio, but we could not end

3547
02:56:14,960 --> 02:56:19,360
the show if we don't go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

3548
02:56:19,360 --> 02:56:20,760
Dark Sakura, we'll start with you.

3549
02:56:20,760 --> 02:56:21,760
Your final thought tonight.

3550
02:56:21,760 --> 02:56:23,160
I'm going to read a quote from Buddha.

3551
02:56:23,160 --> 02:56:24,160
Please do.

3552
02:56:24,160 --> 02:56:28,120
Give nothing no matter where you read it or who has said it, not even if I have said it

3553
02:56:28,120 --> 02:56:33,880
unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense.

3554
02:56:33,880 --> 02:56:34,880
How deep.

3555
02:56:34,880 --> 02:56:36,200
Loki, your final thought.

3556
02:56:36,200 --> 02:56:37,200
I hate Myspace.

3557
02:56:37,200 --> 02:56:40,040
But they've got a million new users.

3558
02:56:40,040 --> 02:56:41,040
It's noteworthy.

3559
02:56:41,040 --> 02:56:46,720
Dude, I went back to my page because I was looking through some of the songs I had uploaded

3560
02:56:46,720 --> 02:56:50,280
there, and you can't download them anymore even though I had it before where you could

3561
02:56:50,280 --> 02:56:53,280
download them for free because they don't want to give anything away for free.

3562
02:56:53,280 --> 02:56:57,840
You can share it on your blogs and bullshit like that, and then it pulls up like, hey,

3563
02:56:57,840 --> 02:57:02,200
I know you want to listen to your music, but how about some shit from somebody else?

3564
02:57:02,200 --> 02:57:03,280
No.

3565
02:57:03,280 --> 02:57:06,160
You're not fucking Pandora.

3566
02:57:06,160 --> 02:57:07,800
Although maybe you are Pandora.

3567
02:57:07,800 --> 02:57:10,520
Hey, they got to buy it off somebody who's making money.

3568
02:57:10,520 --> 02:57:11,520
All right.

3569
02:57:11,520 --> 02:57:33,120
My final thought of the day, everybody, is listen to O-L-R. It's on right after bopping.

3570
02:57:33,120 --> 02:57:37,720
If you enjoyed what you hear or to hear at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend

3571
02:57:37,720 --> 02:57:38,720
about the show.

3572
02:57:38,720 --> 02:57:40,400
Word of mouth is how we get the word out.

3573
02:57:40,400 --> 02:57:44,080
We don't have a million dollar magazine behind us or website or any of that stuff.

3574
02:57:44,080 --> 02:57:45,480
It's all about word of mouth.

3575
02:57:45,480 --> 02:57:47,200
Help the O-L Army grow.

3576
02:57:47,200 --> 02:57:49,040
