1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,880
Tonight, February 5th, 2012.

2
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,560
Could mature video games soon carry an extra sales tax?

3
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:29,920
Game Gear games are spotted for the 3DS, and a creation kit is set to come for Skyrim.

4
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:36,360
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

5
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,880
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:48,760
It is episode number 444, that's three fours, not four fours, for this February 5th of 2012.

7
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,580
We are live as we are every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, where we

8
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:59,100
tape live 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, although

9
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,520
not tonight, Bobby had the night off, something about a superb owl, he was a superb owl or

10
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,520
something he was doing.

11
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,240
I thought he had to do a stupor or something.

12
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,240
Something like that.

13
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,080
So anyway, my name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with

14
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,080
my co-host.

15
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,540
First off, you already heard her, but it's Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

16
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,280
Maybe it was Super Bowels.

17
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,280
Maybe that was it.

18
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,640
It might have been, I don't know, something like that.

19
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,520
Also say hello, of course, to the one and only Tech Master, Loki.

20
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,520
Hi.

21
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,520
How are you, Loki?

22
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,520
I'm fine.

23
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,480
It's a name that a lot of the live listeners like to play on the show, and that is, you

24
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,400
know, where did Loki get his food tonight?

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,200
Because you like to go to like fast food restaurants, or you go to, you know, whatever restaurant

26
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,640
you take out and you bring it to the show to munch on air, because, you know, we do

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,760
the show at dinner time.

28
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,760
Yeah.

29
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,880
So if we don't eat before or after, we're kind of screwed.

30
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,320
So, but you went to two restaurants tonight, right?

31
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,680
Yeah, well, the KFC got some honey barbecue wings, and then I went to McDonald's and got

32
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,760
some fries.

33
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,840
So you had wings and fries for this superb owl day?

34
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,840
Yeah.

35
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,840
I see.

36
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,840
It's not appropriate.

37
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,360
Well, I wanted to go to someplace else, other than fast food, but the teriyaki place nearby

38
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:11,600
closed, and the fish and chips place nearby, they're closed today, and it's just like all

39
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,120
the other places are closed.

40
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,360
I got to go into Quiznos, I guess, but meh.

41
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,360
Yeah, a lot of places.

42
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,160
Well, we actually, Alan and I went and got sushi real quick before the show, and they

43
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,840
were open, but not very busy at all.

44
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,040
There's like one table in there.

45
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,040
Go figure.

46
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,040
I can't imagine why.

47
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:32,320
I considered stopping by Little Caesars for some really cheap ass pizza, but I figured

48
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,880
that they'd be really busy.

49
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,720
No, not now.

50
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,760
All those pizzas would have been done before the big game started.

51
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,560
I am, of course, talking about the Puppy Bowl.

52
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
I got food too.

53
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,440
Where'd you get food from tonight?

54
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,360
Whole Foods.

55
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,840
How healthy, you damn dirty hippie.

56
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
Yes.

57
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,720
Hey, it was delicious, and it had grapes in it.

58
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,320
All right, so obviously, Pink Elephant in the room.

59
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,120
We are live on a night where usually there's not a lot of stuff going on anywhere, not

60
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,520
on TV, not anywhere, unless you're the network that's carrying the Super Bowl, because we

61
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,520
are up against...

62
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,800
I was going to say, I did hear something big happen today, and that was Madonna said, fuck

63
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
you to everybody.

64
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,360
Yeah, well, that was MIA, I guess.

65
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
Oh, MIA?

66
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,440
Yeah, because she had her own little entourage with her.

67
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,920
Now, Madonna, you know, sashayed and lip synced for her life in front of all those people

68
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,920
and stuff.

69
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
It was interesting.

70
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,480
Of course, I know people that pick their nose and eat it, and that's kind of interesting

71
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,480
too.

72
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,680
Anyway, let's introduce our chat room at chat.orangeloungelaunch...

73
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,680
What?

74
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,560
Can we take like five seconds to judge Madonna?

75
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,560
Sure.

76
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,560
Go ahead.

77
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,400
Okay, I'm done.

78
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,020
Chat.orangelaunchradio.com if you want to join us live in our chat room and talk along

79
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,600
with the program and all that good stuff.

80
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,840
So I got to say, look, I don't want to keep ragging on Madonna, because I do love Madonna.

81
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,840
Like no, seriously.

82
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,840
I'm gay.

83
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,840
I have to love Madonna.

84
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,360
Like it's like a it's like a requirement.

85
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,520
She was pre gaga.

86
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,520
She's been slipping.

87
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,180
Like I don't I don't even want to make a Madonna gaga thing.

88
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,280
Like that's not a thing.

89
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,280
People need to stop making that a thing.

90
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,280
It's not a thing.

91
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
It's not a thing.

92
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,280
What?

93
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,520
It's an evolution of styles.

94
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,720
What's an evolution of music?

95
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,720
Sure.

96
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,920
It was clearly an influence.

97
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,400
Here's the thing about Madonna.

98
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
She's kind of slipping.

99
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,400
And I don't know.

100
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,400
I don't know what it is.

101
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,400
But like that new song.

102
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,400
Not good.

103
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,560
Like it's just not good.

104
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,400
But anyway, huh?

105
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,200
Was there ever a Madonna video game trying to get back on topic?

106
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,640
I don't think there was.

107
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,720
Wasn't Ray of Light in something?

108
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,280
It might have been like in a dance game.

109
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,280
I don't know.

110
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,280
All right.

111
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,400
Look, we do, of course, always invite our live chatters at chat.orangelaungerator.com.

112
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,960
However, we do ask the live chatters, don't talk about the Super Bowl in the chat room.

113
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,380
It's not that we want to like censor you or you know, but it's just as I'm trying to look

114
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,400
through chat room and read comments that are relevant to the show, I don't need to see

115
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,400
a bunch of like woo giants, woo patriots, blah, blah, blah, you know, whatever going

116
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
on in there.

117
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,720
So try to keep the Super Bowl chat out.

118
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,880
However, Puppy Bowl chat is just fine.

119
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,560
If you want to talk about the Puppy Bowl, we'll deal with that.

120
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,920
What about that cute little lab that was drinking from the bowl when we were watching?

121
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,760
Well, this year's Puppy Bowl was all about fumble.

122
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,920
It seemed like the whole time was fumble.

123
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,160
But I was a big fan of Oscar the dash on.

124
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,520
Happy birthday, Tiger Claw.

125
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,520
That's right.

126
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,540
It is Tiger Claw's birthday.

127
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,640
We should take a minute to acknowledge Tiger Claw because he does a lot.

128
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:23,200
You know, the network that we're on, all games dot com like I don't want to like I don't

129
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,740
want to say the wrong thing here, but there's there's really nobody running all games radio

130
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,740
right now.

131
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,460
Like it's kind of like this hive mind, I think that's kind of running the station.

132
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,780
That's not a knock on Scott, who started a long time ago, but his station will be assimilated.

133
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,440
He's got other projects and things and he's not really running things.

134
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,840
He doesn't have a daily show on the network anymore.

135
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,440
So there's really nobody in charge at all games radio.

136
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,860
We're just kind of, you know, trucking along, doing our thing.

137
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:55,160
But Tiger Claw, he has done a damn good job, just kind of like kind of keeping things orderly.

138
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,640
Like I don't want to call him the secretary of all games radio, but he's he's definitely

139
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:04,280
he's the P.A. The personal assistant to director.

140
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,280
OK, he's the one that actually gets the stuff done.

141
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,760
Yes, that's a very good way of putting it.

142
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,860
That's a great way of putting it.

143
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,980
He's the director's assistant or the one that's actually doing all the work because he's,

144
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,780
you know, making sure that all the live shows are up.

145
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:23,060
Like we have been on all games radio so, so, so long that we can do our own live show.

146
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,420
We technically don't need Tiger Claw's help.

147
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,460
We like having him here, of course.

148
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,500
But I know a lot of the other shows on the network, like Tiger Claw helps them get on,

149
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,300
actually set up their show, go live and all that good stuff.

150
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,820
So he does a lot of stuff that you guys probably don't see.

151
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,060
Why?

152
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,380
Because he loves the network.

153
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,180
So or or he's getting money that we don't know about.

154
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,180
I don't know.

155
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,180
I think it's the first one.

156
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,580
So absolutely a special happy birthday to Tiger Claw, because without Tiger Claw, I

157
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,380
don't know if there'd be a network still going right now, because if the power went down,

158
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,340
it probably people would notice till the next live broadcasters like, where's my show?

159
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:04,060
Do you know that that our buddy Brad from Pod Culture just got the first gong of the

160
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,060
year?

161
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,060
Oh, what did Brad do?

162
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:11,180
He said he heard the puppy bowl just went to the dogs.

163
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,180
Nice.

164
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,180
Nice.

165
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,900
I went old school and went with the gong instead of the sad trombone.

166
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,500
All right.

167
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
Okay.

168
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,860
So I want to start since we are, you know, in a we can't ignore the big sports thing

169
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,860
that's going on.

170
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,420
I realize most people this week are probably downloading this via the podcast because I

171
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,780
guess it's I guess it's just an American tradition or something.

172
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,940
Did you know that Paula Deen was in Sacramento like this week?

173
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,940
No, really?

174
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,940
Yeah.

175
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,180
She gave away a lot of ham.

176
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,440
I'm serious.

177
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,440
You're not making this up.

178
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,440
I'm not making this up.

179
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,440
Why were you there?

180
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
I wasn't there.

181
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,660
Um, but my Nellie's friend Colt, you remember Colt?

182
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,660
I do.

183
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,660
Yeah.

184
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,660
He's got some tie.

185
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,520
Well, he works, I think he works at Whole Foods now, but he has some ties to some sort

186
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,500
of charity or something nearby that got Paula Deen to come out here, do a live show and

187
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,860
give away a bunch of ham.

188
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,860
From what I remember.

189
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,340
Her personal ham stash.

190
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,660
From what I remember of him, him being a big fan of Paula Deen.

191
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,660
Is it coated in butter?

192
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,940
Didn't he have like a little southern twang, if I remember right?

193
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,780
He was a big fan of, uh, not Paula Deen.

194
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,900
It was, um, Rachel Ray.

195
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,520
No, it's a country music star.

196
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,940
It's some country female, no, female country music star.

197
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,940
Trisha Yearwood?

198
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,940
No.

199
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,020
I'm trying to think of like the five.

200
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,460
Shania Twain.

201
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,460
Might be Shania Twain.

202
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,460
Okay.

203
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,460
She's Canadian.

204
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,620
Even though she hasn't been around in about 15 years.

205
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,520
No, maybe that's not it.

206
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,500
It's ah, I don't remember.

207
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
Oh, whatever.

208
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,500
That doesn't matter.

209
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
It's not important.

210
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,700
The important thing is that she looks like she's made of plastic.

211
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,700
Yes.

212
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,340
By the way, I have to tell you the sad thing that happened yesterday.

213
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,340
What?

214
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,980
Becky and I were at the Crocker Art Museum for Free Museum Day and we were standing next

215
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:56,660
to this younger couple just looking at a picture and the guy's like, wow, this looks like a

216
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,820
Rush album.

217
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,060
And she's like, what's Rush?

218
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:09,740
Becky and I turned around and in unison with her boyfriend said, what's Rush?

219
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,020
She looked like she wanted to crawl into a corner and die.

220
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,140
At least that didn't happen on 2-1-12 because that would have been a disaster.

221
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,140
Anyway.

222
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,140
All right.

223
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,860
Can we actually talk about video games?

224
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,860
Sure.

225
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,860
Possibly.

226
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,860
I thought that that was worth sharing.

227
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,860
All right.

228
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,860
No, it's fine.

229
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,860
It's fine.

230
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,860
Can we talk about video games?

231
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,860
I played some.

232
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,860
It happens occasionally on this show.

233
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,860
All right.

234
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:37,780
Look, the kickoff topic, her, her, I wanted to do tonight was OK, because a lot of folks

235
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,100
tend to kind of notice that we don't talk a lot about sports games because we don't

236
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,540
really play a lot of sports games these days because I don't know why don't we play sports

237
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,540
games?

238
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,540
Why don't you play Madden?

239
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,540
Because they're ass.

240
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,660
But that's that's not a good enough reason.

241
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,660
I'm sorry.

242
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,900
Like because I hate football.

243
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:59,180
Well, I don't personally I don't hate football like hates a strong word, but I don't know.

244
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,540
Like I think I'm just willing to admit I'm not very good at sports games because I'm

245
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,340
not very knowledgeable about a lot of the sports.

246
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,980
And for me, a lot of these games like Madden and stuff get really like detailed and stuff.

247
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,300
And when I look at all these like, you know, maps of the X's nose and things like that.

248
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,500
And I'm sure like like a lot of football fans, I'm just like the biggest idiot in the world

249
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,500
right now.

250
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,140
But like you have to realize there's some people that don't really watch sports, you

251
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,140
guys.

252
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,980
So I I can't really follow a lot of those new sports games.

253
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:28,020
But I thought that doesn't mean I hate all sports games, because that's certainly not

254
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,020
true.

255
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,100
There are some sports games out there I actually really enjoy.

256
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,060
So I thought we could talk a little bit about sports games that don't suck.

257
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,780
So dark soccer, do you do you I know you say hate football, but are there any sports games

258
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,220
you can think of that you really enjoy?

259
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,420
I like like the only football game I've ever really enjoyed was super high impact on Super

260
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,640
Nintendo.

261
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,300
My brothers and I would play the crap out of that.

262
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,300
And NBA Jam.

263
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,500
And NBA Jam.

264
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:03,660
And that skiing game on the PC that I used to scream at that was on the old no on the

265
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,660
PC.

266
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,660
Yeah.

267
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,660
Whiskey.

268
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,660
Loki, you need to talk into a mic.

269
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,660
Yeah.

270
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,660
Ski free.

271
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,660
Ski free.

272
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,660
That game would piss me off.

273
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,580
Oh, actually, I remember one that I really, really liked Alpine Racer.

274
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,380
I freaking loved Alpine Racer.

275
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,300
And we had one at my arcade.

276
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,220
I played the shit out of that I was super good at it.

277
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:32,360
And I liked it's not really, you know, sports, but I'll count it as prop cycle.

278
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,540
That's stretching it.

279
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,860
That's like saying DDR and taking the easy way out of this question.

280
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,740
I didn't say DDR.

281
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,740
Some sports games that I've enjoyed in the past.

282
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:46,100
I used to play a game on the NES back in the day that I loved.

283
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,860
And I think it was like baseball.

284
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,140
Baseball stars.

285
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,140
Was that it?

286
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,140
You could like manage.

287
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,140
I have that game.

288
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,140
Yes.

289
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,140
That game.

290
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,140
That game.

291
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,780
But they had an NES version of it, right?

292
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,780
I think they did.

293
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,780
Maybe it was RBI Baseball or something.

294
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,780
No, it wasn't RBI Baseball.

295
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,780
It wasn't any other baseball game.

296
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,980
No, I think that Baseball Stars was the...

297
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,260
I think they did a Neo Geo.

298
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,260
That wasn't Neo Geo.

299
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,580
The version of the Neo Geo won.

300
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,040
I think they did one on the NES.

301
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,000
And then like, you know, because the folks that...

302
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,660
They made some games on Nintendo before they spun off to their own thing.

303
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,080
So anyway.

304
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,080
Other stuff I enjoyed.

305
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,060
Blades of Steel will always be one of my favorites.

306
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,460
I had Ice Hockey and Blades of Steel on the NES.

307
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,820
Those are both great games.

308
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,860
I really like a lot of racing games.

309
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,580
If you want to try and get a little more modern.

310
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,580
I do like a lot of...

311
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,580
I like the...

312
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:39,380
Although, I don't know if it's really sports borderline, but I like the Wangan Midnight

313
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,380
Maximum Tune games.

314
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,420
That's not a sport.

315
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,180
Racing is not a sport?

316
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,180
Drifting is not a sport.

317
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,180
Okay.

318
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,060
I mean drifting, they have competitions, but it's not like a sport.

319
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,000
I've played the NASCAR games and I've enjoyed them.

320
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Like in the arcade.

321
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,020
You know, like the big old simulations that you get in there and get into.

322
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,220
I like those.

323
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,220
So those are pretty cool.

324
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,580
I'm trying to think if there's a...

325
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,580
Oh!

326
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,580
You know what?

327
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,740
I really enjoyed, at least in the past, I haven't played a lot of them recently, but

328
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,220
I remember when I was growing up, I used to love on the Commodore 64, because y'all know

329
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,860
I loved my Commodore 64 growing up.

330
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,060
I used to play the shit out of Winter Games and Summer Games 2, which were kind of like

331
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,060
the Olympic...

332
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,060
I mean, there was a Summer Games 1, but we didn't own it.

333
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,420
So I had those other ones.

334
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,940
Those were kind of like their Olympic games where you could do like cycling and, you know,

335
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:30,500
if it was Winter Games, you could do, I don't know, like, I think figure skating and speed

336
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,100
skating and some of the other stuff they have.

337
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,100
So I like the Olympics.

338
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,740
Like, I really do like that as far as sports go anyway.

339
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,500
So I like usually a lot of the Olympic games.

340
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:44,320
I even played the demo for that Mario and Sonic 2012 Olympic game that's coming out

341
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,920
later this year because they have the 3DS demo out right now.

342
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,340
I like the trampoline one because that was the only one where you really notice the 3D.

343
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,740
But the cycling one drove me bonkers.

344
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:57,900
So and some of the ones, Dark Soccer said, I used to play NBA Jam in the arcade all the

345
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,900
time.

346
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,900
I really try.

347
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,380
I really tried to like this new NBA Jam that just came out, but I didn't really care for

348
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,860
it.

349
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,180
The new one that was on, yeah, I downloaded the demo on Fire Edition or whatever.

350
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,180
Didn't care for it.

351
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,180
It wasn't that good.

352
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,180
That sad face.

353
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,180
Yeah, I tried.

354
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,740
You know, um, what was the game?

355
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,740
California games?

356
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,740
Oh, yeah.

357
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,740
California.

358
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,740
Links.

359
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,740
Yeah.

360
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,940
It was, uh, that was originally, um, that was, I would say it was an Amiga game.

361
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,860
I wasn't great at it, but it was okay, but it had the unreal 360.

362
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:34,660
Well, they tried to keep, actually, that's like a spinoff of the summer games and, uh,

363
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,820
winter games because they, you know, they kind of ran out of stuff to do Olympic related

364
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:43,700
720 and well, that was a different series, but yeah, seven to 720 was awesome.

365
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,260
Anyhow, Loki, what about you?

366
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:54,740
Um, I used to play some of the NFL Blitz arcade game back in, I don't know, when I worked

367
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,740
at Roundtable.

368
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,740
That was kind of fun.

369
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:02,740
Um, and then co-op.

370
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,740
It's running.

371
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,740
Um, I don't know, I don't play a lot of sports games.

372
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,740
Okay.

373
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:12,140
I thought of a racing game that ought to count because everybody fucking loved this game

374
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,700
when they were a kid.

375
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:19,140
I mean, Ironman, Ivan Stewart, super off-road racing, every pizza parlor has that, right?

376
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,140
I never played it.

377
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,380
I actually never played that one.

378
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,380
Oh my God.

379
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:27,740
That had an awesome any, I remember when the NES version of that came out or was it, no,

380
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,700
it was regular NES because it was one of the few games that supported the, um, uh, the

381
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,540
ultra tap or whatever it was called.

382
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,540
The multi tap.

383
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,540
Yeah.

384
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,980
Because I mean, if I was going to count a racing game as, you know, included, then I

385
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:47,580
would totally, totally just put in the original Ridge Racer because that was a money sucker

386
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,700
for me.

387
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,420
If I hadn't worked at the damn arcade, I would have been broke.

388
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,420
All right.

389
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,500
Go into our chat room for some comments at chat.

390
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,940
If I got everything for Loki, sorry.

391
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,940
Just want to make sure.

392
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,940
Um, sure.

393
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:04,500
I mean, that's chat that orange lounge, radio.com, uh, Kaijuto says baseball all stars was awesome

394
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,100
and I had it on Nintendo.

395
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:11,540
Um, RDG singe says, OMG, no one mentioned track and field.

396
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,540
That one was okay.

397
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:16,180
You know, they had an Xbox live port of that, um, way back in the beginning when it was

398
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:20,580
a bunch of old eighties, Konami games are being ported over, but it's really, I mean,

399
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,100
it's good, but it's really just button mashing.

400
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,740
I did play track and field, not even like three months ago though, the last time I was

401
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,720
at electronica at Disneyland because they have the whole Flynn's arcade and they had

402
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,720
a track and field machine.

403
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,980
I played it on my, uh, arcade cabinet not too long ago, a few months ago, but it's really

404
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:43,620
just like, you know, but I guess then again, the Commodore 64 games were no better.

405
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,620
So what am I, who am I to judge?

406
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:52,220
So, all right, anyhow, uh, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks.

407
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,120
We usually like to start off the show, talk about the video games that we've been playing

408
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,120
this week.

409
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,120
Dark Sakura.

410
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,120
How was your gaming week?

411
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,120
I played.

412
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,120
Wow.

413
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,120
And something epic happened.

414
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,120
Okay.

415
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,980
I'm going to tell it to you earlier, but I'm going to tell it to me.

416
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:13,580
So this guy named Lich Rage on Blade's Edge Alliance, Human DK, um, I was wondering around,

417
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:18,820
uh, trying to finish the love is in the air crap, you know, for, they do for Valentine's

418
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,820
suck.

419
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:24,180
And, um, there's this thing that you have to throw rose petals on certain, uh, race

420
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,180
and class combinations.

421
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,580
And one of them is a human death knight.

422
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,060
So I just went in trade chat and said, is there a human death knight around?

423
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,140
And there's one said, yeah, 10 gold.

424
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:41,660
So I invited him into my party and targeted him and then left the party and he said, you

425
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,660
lied.

426
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,900
I'm like, you shouldn't have been charging for something that's a free service.

427
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:53,040
And he's like, I've only got 20 gold and I'm like, so go out and earn it like the rest

428
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,040
of us.

429
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,620
Mining and herbalism are your friends.

430
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,620
And he said, suck it.

431
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:02,820
You planning the herbal is, uh, she's like, suck it.

432
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,780
And I was like, ignore, she just put deal with it.

433
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,780
Happy face.

434
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:12,120
Well, I was, I, I wasn't rude to him.

435
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:18,580
You know, I was like, you know, I, when I started off, you swindled them, I didn't swindle

436
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,580
them.

437
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,580
Maybe a little bit, a little bit.

438
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,580
You swindled him.

439
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,260
He thought I swindled him.

440
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:27,020
If you could, you would have had your character show her boobies a little bit, you know, cause

441
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:32,660
my intention was the moment someone said, DK here, I was just going to find their name,

442
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,740
target them and throw the rose petals anyway.

443
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,740
That was the plan.

444
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,340
And he's like, 10 gold.

445
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,340
That's stupid.

446
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,580
You don't, don't do that crap.

447
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,740
You know, go out and earn your own damn money.

448
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,780
No, I can't help it if you keep buying every pet that pops up in the auction house.

449
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,460
So um, addicting.

450
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,460
It kind of is.

451
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,540
I've actually spent lots of money on pets.

452
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:58,340
They should really have like a series of hoarders, you know, where it's people collecting wild

453
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,340
pets.

454
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,340
Like MMO hoarders.

455
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,340
Yeah.

456
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,340
MMO hoarders.

457
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,340
I'm sure that exists somewhere.

458
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,620
But, um, well actually though, um, one of my really good friends who was my roommate

459
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:12,540
in college, uh, joined our server and gave me a pandaren monk.

460
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,540
What a nice gift.

461
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,860
It was very nice of her cause she had the magazine and it gave her an extra pandaren

462
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,860
monk.

463
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,060
When the magazine went away, they gave away all these pets in the game.

464
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,620
It's like an I'm sorry type of thing.

465
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,620
Yeah.

466
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,980
So she gave it to me cause I think she already had it.

467
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:30,060
Um, and then I'm also playing a bust move on my phone.

468
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,060
It's still super fun.

469
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,340
I really enjoy it.

470
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,940
And also I have to make an observation before we move on to Loki.

471
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:41,300
Um, on the can of Arizona diet green tea is a prostitute.

472
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,300
Seriously.

473
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,740
Taiyu.

474
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:49,940
You can tell because her OB is tied in the front and her hair is over elaborate.

475
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,500
That's what I get for studying weight.

476
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,580
No, whoever designed that had no idea.

477
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:58,520
They were just like, we just need to look like a geisha Asian looking on this green

478
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:07,380
tea, but they've put a whore granted a very high class, talented, artistic whore.

479
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:13,740
This writing here probably says I am horse, but, but I mean, I just had to point it out.

480
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,020
It just, I looked at the can and it dawned on me that it's a prostitute.

481
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:22,980
Isn't there some website of like bad Chinese text tattoos where you see people that got

482
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,140
tattoos of Chinese writing and it says like really horrible things.

483
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,900
Of course, I don't know how much of that's legit and how much of it's fake, but yeah.

484
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,020
All right.

485
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,860
If that's it for dark soccer's gaming week, Loki, how was your gaming week?

486
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:37,500
Um, I played Skyrim only a little bit though.

487
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Actually.

488
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:43,820
Um, I mainly this week was working on Grand Theft Auto modding and thank God finished

489
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,980
what I was working on cause it was making my brain explode.

490
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:53,540
Had to go back and learn, uh, or relearn some calculus stuff mainly because during my actual

491
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:58,700
calculus class, well actually pre calculus cause I never took calculus, um, I was too

492
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:04,340
busy programming a Final Fantasy type game on my calculator.

493
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:10,500
So um, but then yeah, it was mainly just like, I'm never going to use any of this and then

494
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,420
sure one time I need something.

495
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:18,100
Obviously there's the internet, um, so yeah, I got that all taken care of.

496
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,100
But yeah.

497
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:28,700
Uh, Skyrim, I'm 123 hours now into the game and um, I'm telling you, I saw some things

498
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,460
how Skyrim's won all these game of the year awards and stuff.

499
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,860
That game is so fucking broken.

500
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,900
It is just ridiculous.

501
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:42,060
I literally have to now keep my iPod with me and pull up the quest as I do them to look

502
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,380
at the bugs section, known bugs for this quest.

503
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,540
So I don't run into them.

504
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:52,620
I ran into two yesterday, um, that were kind, not really game breaking, but it, I mean one

505
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:57,180
of them would have been pretty fucking annoying if it, you know, thankfully I was able to

506
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,620
go back to a save prior to when I started that quest.

507
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:04,940
There was an auto save for that, but man, if I hadn't, that would have sucked.

508
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:14,740
It was, uh, but he VMs calling and um, basically, uh, you're supposed to drag this companion

509
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:19,580
to this altar and you sacrifice him and then you have to go kill some other people or whatever.

510
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,100
Wait, you'd sacrifice one of your companions?

511
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,100
Awesome.

512
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:28,220
It's not, it was when I hired, it was a guy that was like, Hey, I'm a stronger guy here.

513
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,060
I'm like, wait, you die.

514
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,060
Hold on.

515
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,740
You hired a companion so you could sacrifice them.

516
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,740
Yes.

517
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,740
Awesome.

518
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,740
Yes.

519
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:43,180
Um, so anyways, so I did that and one, when she appears though, one of the Daedra appears,

520
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:49,820
um, it's just like, it does this weird screen effect thing that gets all blurry and purple.

521
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,820
Well that never went away.

522
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:56,400
Apparently it's a known glitch and normally it's caused by pulling up any of your, if

523
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,500
you hit pause, if you pull up your inventory, anything while that's going, then it will

524
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,580
stay like that.

525
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,100
I didn't do anything like that.

526
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,140
It just did it for fun.

527
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:10,220
And so I had to restart the whole thing and to get that to go away because I was like,

528
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:14,140
well, is this supposed to be on all the time while I'm on this quest?

529
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:17,100
Because this is really hard to see.

530
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,340
But no, it's not for the record.

531
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,820
The other one was when I was trying to become the Thane of Riften.

532
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:29,140
Apparently if you visit your house, you have to purchase a house in Riften.

533
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:34,140
If you visit the house before you talk to the Jarl, you can never become the Thane of

534
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,140
Riften.

535
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,220
It just breaks the whole quest.

536
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,220
Thanks.

537
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:43,740
Thanks for, there is no fucking way they bug tested this game.

538
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:48,780
I mean, most of the quests they seriously must not have tested at all because there

539
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,000
is no way that this would have been missed.

540
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,700
This is just like completely obvious stuff.

541
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,220
Hey, what would happen if I visited the house first?

542
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,180
Oh, it breaks the fucking quest.

543
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,900
Oh, no, we're not going to test for that.

544
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,900
It's good.

545
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,940
Yeah, it worked the first time I played through it.

546
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:11,500
Oh, and I cheated in, well, not technically cheated.

547
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,700
I exploited a glitch in the game to level my character up to 81 and a half, which is

548
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,700
the cap.

549
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,700
I capped all my skills at a hundred.

550
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,100
Wait, the cap is 81 and a half?

551
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,140
81 and a half.

552
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,140
Okay.

553
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:26,260
It just happens to be that's the amount of leveling you get when you have all your skills

554
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:30,940
at 181 and a half.

555
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,020
It didn't matter anyways.

556
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,740
I'm unkillable anyways, so whatever.

557
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,140
I just didn't want to have to, I wanted to know my perk points right away so I could

558
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,820
like figure out where I wanted them and I actually went back and started doing the actual

559
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:46,900
main quest line and I got to say, man, that thing is short.

560
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,700
It is a really short quest line.

561
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,260
Well, they usually are.

562
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,900
I mean, the game isn't really about the main quest.

563
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,900
The main quest is just kind of there to help you learn about the game.

564
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,900
Yeah.

565
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:03,500
I am looking forward to the 1.4 patch so I can finish Blood on the Ice, but at this point

566
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,820
I'm kind of saying, you know what?

567
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,420
So these quests are breaking, it's no big deal because none of them contribute to my

568
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,220
achievement points on there.

569
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:14,060
So I'm just going to finish all the quests that require, you know, that they need me

570
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:18,380
to do in order to get my achievements and then I'm going to go kill everybody once I'm

571
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,860
done with all that.

572
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,660
Everybody will die in a bloody rage.

573
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:27,180
I did see a video this week, it was great, it was of someone had changed their player

574
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:31,620
model to one of the kids and then they had like some spell on there that was dragon fire

575
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,620
and it was hilarious.

576
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,620
I don't know.

577
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,620
It made me laugh.

578
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:40,260
It was a why kids, why kids can't be killed because they're actually dragons.

579
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,660
All right.

580
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,660
And Call of Duty.

581
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,540
Play more Call of Duty, of course.

582
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,820
All right, anything else?

583
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,900
I think that's it.

584
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,900
Yeah.

585
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,660
All right.

586
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,660
My gaming week.

587
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:58,340
See, I actually played quite a bit of new stuff this week, a few games.

588
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,140
Soul Calibur 5, quickly.

589
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:04,700
I literally played Soul Calibur 5 once, so I don't want to like do a total review on

590
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:09,380
it, but I did spend, you know, about an hour with it the other night when I got it and,

591
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,540
you know, I had a fairly good time.

592
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,900
The fighting's a lot of fun.

593
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,900
Creative character's great.

594
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:18,060
I love creative character and, you know, I was making some fun characters with that and

595
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:22,260
story mode I noticed though right off the bat was kind of weird because like you would

596
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:29,980
have these full cut scenes and then like a storyboard, like you just see like a cartoon

597
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:34,180
storyboard that transitions, like it almost feels like it was like half done, a little

598
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,100
bit rushed.

599
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,300
I guess the bottom line I noticed after, you know, the short amount of time I did play

600
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,780
the game is that although the core fighter game itself, which is what you're paying the

601
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:48,060
money for, is good, I feel like everything kind of on the shell outside of that was a

602
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,700
little bit like rushed or wonky, except, well, creative character's decent.

603
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,940
The only thing that I'm disappointed is that, you know, because it's a game that didn't

604
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,540
really pre-order anything, do you know how they have that pre-order character, that really

605
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,540
weird looking guy?

606
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:04,020
No, because I didn't pre- oh wait, no, I pre-ordered on Amazon, but they didn't give me anything.

607
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,540
Yeah, you're supposed to get this like pre-order character, it's this guy, maybe it's only

608
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:11,860
a GameStop or whatever, it's this guy in like a top hat or something like that that's just

609
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:17,660
really- has some really wacky moves, but that would have been kind of fun to play as.

610
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,660
Interesting.

611
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,500
I think he was from- he may have been from 4.

612
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,100
Or the PSP one maybe, right?

613
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,140
Yeah, he might have been the PSP one.

614
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:30,100
I wish the lost Amel was in this one, because he was awesome in 3, but I like Tyra a lot,

615
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,460
so I have my custom character model off Tyra.

616
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,660
And Ivy.

617
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,020
I love Ivy.

618
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,020
She's so dirty.

619
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,980
I made a male Ivy.

620
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,980
Awesome.

621
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,420
What, like wearing Voldo's gear?

622
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:46,580
No, just wearing like a tight top and leather pants, you know.

623
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,580
Cool.

624
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,580
That's pretty cool.

625
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:53,500
So yeah, Soulcalibur V. I'll tell you more about it when I have more time to play it.

626
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:59,220
Because I've been, on my Playstation 3, mostly been playing and sucked into Final Fantasy

627
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:05,380
XIII II, which came out the same day, and I've sunk a good at least 7 hours if not more

628
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,540
into that at this point.

629
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:12,380
So yeah, I'm really enjoying Final Fantasy XIII II.

630
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:17,020
I'm really surprised at how divided the internet is on this, because there's just some people

631
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,500
that really just fucking hate Final Fantasy XIII.

632
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,580
And I really don't think this game is going to do much to sway your mind.

633
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,980
I mean, it's to the point, like this is how divided it is.

634
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:30,460
You know that Final Fantasy XIII II is one of like, what, less than 20 games to get a

635
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:34,280
perfect 40 from Famitsu magazine, ever, right?

636
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:38,860
And then like, Edge, I think in the UK, gave it a 5 out of 10.

637
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:43,820
Like, that's quite a difference between a perfect, pristine score from Famitsu and a

638
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,820
5.

639
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,140
So, I mean, it's just really interesting.

640
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,960
It's because these fucking reviewers go into this shit very biased.

641
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,340
I mean, they're like judging games on shit that they never judged games on before.

642
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,300
It's like, this game is too linear.

643
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,300
Really?

644
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,300
Really?

645
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,300
All these other RPGs were too linear?

646
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,660
I just, I just want to give the disclaimer.

647
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,140
I didn't read either of those reviews, I'm going off Wikipedia.

648
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,700
I was just really surprised though.

649
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,500
I was like, wow, this is really a diverse, you know, I would expect some, you know, not

650
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,660
everybody's going to like everything, but just usually when it's all over the map like

651
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,660
that, especially when Famitsu gave it such a high score, it just really surprised me.

652
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,860
But anyway, let's not talk about what other people thought of it.

653
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,940
Let's talk about what I thought of it.

654
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,060
Of course, what they're doing is they're trying to fix a lot of what people bitched about

655
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:28,220
with XIII.

656
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:32,020
There's definitely not a linear sense in this game whatsoever now.

657
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:38,280
You have this interesting map, um, the crux that you can travel to all these different

658
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:43,740
time zones feels a little bit chrono-triggery kind of where they're pulling the story from.

659
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:49,180
The story has a lot to do with time travel, like, and it's, it's a bit of a mind fuck

660
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:55,580
because you start creating alternate timelines of the exact same place you just were.

661
00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:00,820
So like I'm at a point in the story where I was at a place 10 years in the future, but

662
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:06,940
then I unlocked alternate timeline 10 years in the future because of something I did 200

663
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,120
years in the future resolving the paradox.

664
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,380
So it's like, it's enough time travel stuff to make your head spin.

665
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,660
That sounds like lots of fun.

666
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,500
That sounds like hanging out with Nordstrom.

667
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,640
It's it's really like an entire season with a doctor.

668
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:24,420
It's really an entire season of Doctor Who squished into a video game or it actually

669
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,960
in some ways it reminds me of Quantum Leap.

670
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,460
Like where in Knoll, Knoll and Sarah going to end up next?

671
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,460
Wah, wah, wah.

672
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:38,460
Um, but, uh, yeah, I mean the, the, the really good thing about 13 too is that the battle

673
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:44,460
system is robust right off the bat and you know, well, maybe you don't really get the

674
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,820
monster character and the monster trapping and all that till episode two, but needless

675
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:55,500
to say in 13, one of the big issues that people had was that it took forever before you even

676
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:59,300
got to like where you can flip paradigms and where the battle system becomes really interesting

677
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,180
when you get the whole paradigm stuff, right?

678
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,540
For the first two chapters, you're pretty much just button mashing.

679
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,900
There's nothing else to do but auto attack.

680
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:10,200
But in 13 too, that paradigm stuff starts battle one, which is good.

681
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:17,180
So, um, towns are back, random conversations, side quests that people want you to do for

682
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,180
them.

683
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,940
Uh, Chocolena, who's now the shop, who's shows up everywhere.

684
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,940
I love Chocolena.

685
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,700
She's like a Vegas showgirl meets, uh, uh, Chocobo.

686
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,700
It's great.

687
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,860
And, um, apparently there's like a casino later on with tons of mini games and all that

688
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,860
stuff.

689
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,140
So I, I'm really enjoying it.

690
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:39,020
You know, the story, although it's kind of confusing, like I hate to make myself sound

691
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:44,500
like stupid, but I'm, the story's like really confusing, but I got to say it is really cool,

692
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:51,980
um, to kind of see characters from 13 years later and they do some neat stuff with that.

693
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,580
So it's cool.

694
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,380
The only thing about the characters that's a little weird is that your party only has

695
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,380
two people and I don't know if that's ever going to change.

696
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:04,900
I kind of think the whole game might be just the two people and the rotating monster that

697
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,380
might turn some people off.

698
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,380
I don't know.

699
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,180
I think there's other stuff through DLC.

700
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:12,220
I think you might be able to get more characters as DLC.

701
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:17,700
That's a little bit side eye and judging square for jumping on that bandwagon because I really

702
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:22,320
don't like when so much stuff is behind DLC.

703
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,340
You know, it's kind of like now games are really costing $90 because it's $60 for what

704
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,340
you wouldn't.

705
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,700
You know, a lot of that costume shit is paid to unlock content.

706
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,540
Oh, of course it is.

707
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,780
Of course it is.

708
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,380
There's nothing to download right now.

709
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:42,740
But I'm told that a bunch of zone areas are unlocked through DLC and I heard that lightning

710
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,440
in a general from the first game are supposed to be DLC at some point.

711
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:52,860
So I have to judge square a little bit for hopping on that bandwagon.

712
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:57,660
You know, especially when the series is a little bit vulnerable right now.

713
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:01,780
I think that, especially when your game only has two characters in it, that's a little

714
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,860
bit judging you.

715
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:11,380
But at least the game that you get for the money you pay for it is a robust experience

716
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,380
and I can think of far worse games to blow $60 on.

717
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,540
I don't think this game is worthy of a $5.

718
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:22,740
I don't know if it's a perfect $40, but it's really good.

719
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,340
But not perfect.

720
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:27,020
So that's what I think about Final Fantasy 13, too.

721
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,980
I think if you liked 13, play it.

722
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:35,980
And don't let that hurdle of, but I never beat 13 stop you.

723
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:40,500
Because yes, the game will tell you what happened at the end of 13 and you can even go through

724
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,780
a mode that will just walk you through the story of Final Fantasy 13.

725
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:48,300
Albeit it's kind of like narrated text, but you get the idea.

726
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,820
I didn't beat 13 and I don't feel like it was really ruined for me.

727
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:58,400
Yes, I will know what happens right at the end of 13, but there's still a lot of stuff

728
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,820
that it takes to get there.

729
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:05,020
So just knowing the ending I don't think is going to totally ruin 13 for me.

730
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,020
Because I will have to go back.

731
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:10,620
Because I was on chapter 12 when I stopped, I got a long way through it.

732
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,900
But yeah, 13, too, is worth your time.

733
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,220
One other game I played this week.

734
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,180
So Tangent for a minute.

735
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:23,720
Orange Launch Radio started, of course, for many years.

736
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:28,940
For about, what, four years, we were a show exclusively about music games.

737
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:33,740
Because DarkSakura, Loki, and myself all met playing DDR at the local arcade and the original

738
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:39,980
concept behind the show was let's make this kind of like show about what we enjoy doing

739
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:43,500
at the arcades every Wednesday or Thursday night, whatever night it was we were going

740
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,860
back then.

741
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:48,920
And we always used to go to Brookfield's, the diner, afterwards and kind of talk shit

742
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,920
about games.

743
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,980
It was kind of like let's do that as like our show.

744
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,820
So for a long time it was about music games.

745
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:57,260
We talked about DDR and the new songs are coming out in DDR.

746
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:01,340
We used to talk about guitar freaks and drum media and keyboard media, Para Para Paradise.

747
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,540
All these games that Konami did.

748
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:07,220
And when they first came out, I think we were right on, I think we changed formats right

749
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:12,020
around the time Guitar Hero was breaking and all that stuff.

750
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:18,260
So the bottom line is we switched from doing a music game only show to a gaming show because

751
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:22,220
there wasn't a lot of stuff in the music game world to talk about anymore, which was ironic

752
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:26,420
because then about a year after we switched, Rock Band and Guitar Hero 2 and all that just

753
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,940
made it huge.

754
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:32,020
But we felt like there was more we could do talking about regular games.

755
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:37,780
I haven't been following the music gaming scene as closely since then, but I do kind

756
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,380
of like, you know, I like to, I check Bamani style once in a while.

757
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:44,100
I checked DDR freak when that was still running, you know, and I would just kind of like keep,

758
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:49,740
I'd like to keep tabs on the music game scene, but I gotta say I haven't really, really enjoyed

759
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,140
a Bamani game in a long time.

760
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,140
I haven't.

761
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:57,620
I haven't really cared for a lot of the music in the newer BeatMania 2DX's.

762
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:02,260
I didn't think Ju-Beat was all that, or U-Beat or whatever they call that game.

763
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,420
I didn't think, what else has come out since then?

764
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:11,260
Pop'n Music, you know, the one they tried here on the Xbox was absolutely awful.

765
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,800
The Wii one was really weird.

766
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:19,660
So I can't say I've really, really, truly enjoyed a Bamani game until I think this week.

767
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:27,060
I downloaded a game on Xbox Live that's out called Rhythm Party, and I have to say it's

768
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,860
actually pretty good.

769
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:35,860
Now, it's not perfect, there are some things wrong with it, but all things considered,

770
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:40,780
Rhythm Party is kind of the game that Dance Masters, the Kinect game that came out last

771
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:48,060
year on Xbox 360, that was like Konami's first, like, let's put a Bamani game with Kinect.

772
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:51,700
Rhythm Party is the game that Dance Masters should have been, I really think.

773
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:57,220
Ironically enough, Dance Masters, or Dance Evolution as it's called in Japan, is an arcade

774
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:00,420
game, or will become an arcade game very soon.

775
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,420
Really?

776
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,420
But Rhythm Party should.

777
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,420
Yeah.

778
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:10,660
Okay, here's the thing about Rhythm Party, like, Konami is setting this game up to fail,

779
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,780
I really think.

780
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,820
Like I kind of think this is just coming out.

781
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:18,400
Like, I went to Bamani's style to see what they were saying about it, there's nothing

782
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,400
on it.

783
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,060
I went to, I put it on Twitter, like Rhythm Party, and like, nobody's talking about it.

784
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,100
I saw like one Major Nelson tweet.

785
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:31,060
The only way I knew about this game was from following Naoki Madaya on Facebook, who is

786
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,980
of course one of the big, you know, guys, and we mentioned it, remember we mentioned

787
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,500
it on the show last week, because we were like, oh, Naoki's teasing this game, and I

788
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,700
remembered that, and so I'm like, oh, I'll download it and check it out, and when I fired

789
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:45,660
it up, I noticed that the menu music was the music from Dance Dance Revolution 5th Mix,

790
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:49,140
and I was like, oh, I loved 5th Mix, I love this music, this is awesome.

791
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:52,820
And then I went into the game, and I was kind of like looking through the songs, I'm like,

792
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:57,280
okay, well, even though it's only 10 songs, this is a decent mix of songs, like there's

793
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:03,560
more stuff that's interesting to me here than there was in all of Dance Masters, so, and

794
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,060
then I fired up the game and played it for a little bit.

795
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,700
So let me tell you where this game's a little bit different.

796
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:13,420
It's not really like, like Dance Masters or Dance Central at all, because you're not trying

797
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:16,580
to mimic a pre-choreographed dance.

798
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:21,580
It's actually a lot more like DDR, or really, Samba de Amigo, because what you're trying

799
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:24,680
to do is you're trying to hit these balls as they fall into the circle.

800
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,700
That's exactly what Samba de Amigo had, right?

801
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,540
But you're trying to hit them with your hands, you're trying to hit them with your feet.

802
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:35,200
So you might hit this ball over here and then kick one with your foot and stuff, and it's

803
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,580
kind of like you get points depending on the timing of when you hit the balls.

804
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:43,500
But you also get extra points as you freestyle.

805
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:47,180
If you jump, you get extra points, if you turn, you get extra points.

806
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:52,460
If you hit balls with hands, you're not supposed to, like you do like crossovers and stuff,

807
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,420
you get extra points.

808
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,820
You know, if you do poses and stuff, you get extra points.

809
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:01,380
So there's really this emphasis on kind of making your own dance out of the balls that

810
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,380
fly in, you know, out of that kind of pattern.

811
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:09,100
And it was, it was entertaining, especially for somebody that kind of really liked DDR

812
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,100
that was all about timing and, you know, hitting the arrows.

813
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:17,300
This is truly a Kinect version of DDR, which I don't think Dance Masters was.

814
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:22,360
Dance Masters unfortunately felt like, hmm, Dance Central did this a little better.

815
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,780
Better music, easier to understand the choreography.

816
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:30,500
Whereas I think this is now a true, okay, it's not about the choreography, it's about,

817
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,300
you know, the more music timing and doing all this.

818
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:40,900
So yeah, the song list, there's only 10 songs, which is a little eh, because two of them

819
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,500
feature Vanilla Ice.

820
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:50,520
But there are some good choices in there, Born This Way, Every Little Step, YMCA.

821
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:56,280
Every song, this is, this is what remind, this is what really reminded me of old DDR.

822
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:02,600
Every song has its own unique background, its own unique video, and its own unique kind

823
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,620
of thing that your character like does or turns into.

824
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,020
Let me explain what I mean.

825
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:10,780
Like when you're playing Born This Way by Lady Gaga, if you do really well, you suddenly

826
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:14,520
turn into like this electric peacock, I don't even know how to explain it.

827
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,540
But the cool thing is, it's still you.

828
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,220
You look like a human pipe organ.

829
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,940
Yeah, it's kind of crazy.

830
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,300
With headlights.

831
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:26,500
That one song with all the anime rabbits and stuff, you turn into like a little butterfly.

832
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,940
There's another one where you slowly turn into an astronaut.

833
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:32,140
It's really cool because at the end of the song, your little astronaut like blasts off

834
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,140
into space.

835
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:36,500
And that reminded me of old DDR because remember like old DDR was like, oh, the backgrounds

836
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,620
and the movies and all the animations.

837
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:44,080
Like every song had its own unique one and Born This Way had the real video, YMCA has

838
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,700
the real video, every little step has the real video.

839
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:51,580
And it's like, everything I used to really like about the DDR games is kind of in this

840
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,060
game.

841
00:40:53,060 --> 00:41:02,900
But what I what I really feel like I'm playing here is the demo for a full retail game.

842
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,380
Like where's the rest of the songs?

843
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,780
Where's multiplayer?

844
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,660
Where's anything?

845
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:13,540
I really feel like they're selling a demo for what could potentially be a really good

846
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,780
retail game.

847
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,980
But I have this bad feeling because nobody knows about it.

848
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:24,440
Like, I really like feel like Konami just kind of, okay, Naoki, we know you have this

849
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,440
idea.

850
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,380
Why don't you throw something together and like, you know, they threw together the demo

851
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:33,640
and you know, Konami was just like, let's just let's just put it out on Xbox Live and

852
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,180
see if it sticks.

853
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,600
And I just had this really bad feeling.

854
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,240
It's not Denno.

855
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,660
There's room for the game to support DLC.

856
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:47,620
I don't know if I trust Konami to handle the DLC appropriately based on other games where

857
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,340
like, you know, two songs ever come out as DLC.

858
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:54,580
I'm going to just cross my fingers and really hope that they get some licensed songs.

859
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:59,300
They get some good stuff in there to really round out the game.

860
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,420
But yeah, I guess I'm going on a long time about this.

861
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,060
But Rhythm Party is really not bad.

862
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:08,740
And if you're listening to this show because you are a fan of Bomani from the yesteryear

863
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:13,100
and so forth, I seriously go check out the demo at least.

864
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:16,700
And tell me if you don't like see a little bit of the old DDR in it.

865
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:21,480
Like I think it's like the closest thing to like a DDR Connect fused experience we're

866
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,660
going to see.

867
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:26,940
And I'll be really bummed if it doesn't go anywhere other than this, because it's not

868
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,940
that bad.

869
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,300
I know, Jamie, you just only got to watch me play it a little bit.

870
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,260
But I think you kind of went into it going, really, Rhythm Party, but you kind of seem

871
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,220
like you're like, oh, this is cute, right?

872
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,220
Yeah.

873
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,220
Yeah.

874
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,220
I want.

875
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,220
Actually, I do want.

876
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,460
Loki, you've always been a vocal critic of Konami.

877
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,140
I know you haven't really played it, but you saw me doing it for a little bit.

878
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,140
It looked okay.

879
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:49,660
I mean, but when I saw them announcing this, I'm like, oh, that's going to suck.

880
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:53,460
I'm just like, I don't even want to look at it.

881
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,380
And it was just all right.

882
00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:01,180
I mean, it's like, I remember my snarky comment on it was like, oh yeah.

883
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:06,500
Or I don't remember what it was, it's like something about like, um, about they're all

884
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,700
you guys excited, you know, pretty blah, blah, blah.

885
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:12,100
I'm like, yeah, like beat and groovy.

886
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,700
Remember how they handled that?

887
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,700
Yeah.

888
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,260
I'm really excited about Rhythm Party.

889
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,260
Exactly.

890
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:20,660
Like it's like, unfortunately, all the missteps that Konami has made with Bimani up until

891
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:23,660
now, like makes everybody like, oh, yay, Rhythm Party's out.

892
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:28,900
But like, no, go like, I don't know what happened behind the scenes, but it is worth your time

893
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:29,900
to check out.

894
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,460
Well, the way they may be treating is like a retail game where they're going to hopefully

895
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:38,540
have a lot of DLC and then it's like, okay, I'm purchasing the, you know, a $60 game or

896
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:41,280
something because of all this $50 or DLC or something.

897
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,500
How much is the game by the way?

898
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,500
Is it 10 bucks?

899
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,500
10 bucks.

900
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,500
Yeah.

901
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,500
That's all right.

902
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,500
I guess.

903
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,500
I don't know.

904
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,500
It seems a little expensive.

905
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,500
It really depends how the DLC goes over.

906
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:55,620
Like I would really think it would be not that hard to just slap together a 10 pack

907
00:43:55,620 --> 00:44:00,020
of, a song, a 10 pack of old DDR classics.

908
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,020
Yeah.

909
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,940
I realize if you're doing custom backgrounds for everything, maybe that takes a little

910
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:08,020
more time and art and so forth, but even they could get away with fudging it a little bit.

911
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:11,220
The old DDR games recycled a few things here and there recycle some art, some of the art

912
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:15,460
assets and just put out like 10 other DDR songs for free.

913
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:18,000
And then this game will have a really enhanced value.

914
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I think it will.

915
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,240
And then put some, like, if you get some decent licenses, like they, they licensed gaga, somebody

916
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:31,660
paid for that, like, you know, but unfortunately it's one modern song and then two retro classics

917
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:39,860
with Bobby Black Wolf or Bobby Black Wolf, Bobby Black Wolf, AKA Vanilla Ice.

918
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:42,260
I actually liked the Vanilla Ice song.

919
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:50,100
Bobby Brown, Bobby, and that clip's going to end up on his show at some point.

920
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,340
Watch, uh, Bobby Brown and, uh, village people.

921
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,340
They're like the retro bigs.

922
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:55,340
That's really it.

923
00:44:55,340 --> 00:45:00,020
And then the rest of the vanilla ice retro yet new, you know what, the songs, they're

924
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,020
not terrible.

925
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,740
They're not terrible.

926
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:06,980
They're not like, I'm going to go run out and buy the CD tomorrow, but they're better

927
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:13,420
than most of the stuff from dance masters, which was very unremarkable.

928
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:17,020
Dance masters was just frustrating and the fact that they're making an arcade game now

929
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,940
it's just, there was no cues whatsoever to what to do.

930
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:26,380
Yeah, and I understand that, you know, par games and stuff like that, you know, that

931
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:30,460
you have to learn the dances and stuff, but come on, Para at least had fucking arrows

932
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:33,380
that would kind of cue you into what to do.

933
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:38,500
Um, or clue you in, I should say cue you in, it's not a word, uh, clue you on what to do.

934
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:42,740
But even like even one of the games had an actual like character doing the actual dance

935
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,820
and stuff, but dance masters had nothing.

936
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:47,460
There was flash every once in a while.

937
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:50,220
It's like, how's it, how am I, how am I going to follow this?

938
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:53,540
The only reason I was ever able to do anything good at dance masters was that I knew the

939
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:54,540
Para Para.

940
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:55,540
Yeah.

941
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:58,460
There's only two, there's really only two Para Para songs in that whole game.

942
00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:59,460
There really are.

943
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,460
There's five.

944
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,180
No, there's two.

945
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:04,180
There's um, yester, no.

946
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,180
Night of fire.

947
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,180
There are two.

948
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,180
Night of fire.

949
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:08,540
Uh, I thought there were two others.

950
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,540
I thought that they did.

951
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,460
Well maybe there's unlocks I never got to.

952
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,460
I don't know.

953
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:13,460
I thought like a virgin was in there.

954
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:14,460
No, I don't think so.

955
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,460
Unless.

956
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:17,500
I don't know, but anyway, whatever.

957
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:21,540
Uh, anyway, I've spent a lot of time talking about that song or that's talking about that

958
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:25,300
game, but uh, you know, just as I've been a fan of music games for so, so long, I was

959
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:30,100
just really surprised at what an unremarkable launch this game has had, but I think it's

960
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,100
worth your attention.

961
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,100
I really do.

962
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:36,620
And if anybody from Konami haha is listening, you might want to consider making rhythm party

963
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:41,020
the arcade game because I think, but maybe it needs a better name.

964
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:43,060
I don't think rhythm party is the best name.

965
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:44,740
You know, they're calling it in Japan.

966
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,920
Boom boom dance.

967
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:47,920
That's a better name.

968
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,740
Which is, but there's no boom, boom dollar in it.

969
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:55,180
And you know, you know why I bet they didn't call it that here because of boom, boom rocket.

970
00:46:55,180 --> 00:47:00,140
Remember boom, boom rocket from EA like, um, God, that was about five years ago now.

971
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:03,300
I was an old ass, the one with little arrows that would come up and you do the fireworks

972
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:08,420
and I was like, okay, it says, I'm looking at here, it says that there's an achievement

973
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:10,340
for playing three Para Para genre songs.

974
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:11,340
Huh?

975
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:14,660
All right, well then maybe, well maybe there's like other songs that weren't in Para Para

976
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:15,660
paradise.

977
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:16,660
I just, I don't know.

978
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:17,660
I think that's what it was.

979
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:18,660
Maybe.

980
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:19,660
All right.

981
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:20,660
Whatever.

982
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:21,660
There are songs that I knew, but they weren't in Para Para paradise.

983
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:22,660
All right.

984
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:23,660
I believe you.

985
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:24,660
It's dance masters.

986
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,700
It wasn't, you know, but anyway, uh, okay.

987
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:28,940
That's it for my gaming week.

988
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,280
I've talked plenty.

989
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:34,660
So housekeeping real quick, follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio, or

990

going to start us off tonight.

992
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:45,620
You got a lot of stuff about one particular company, right?

993
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:50,300
Um, and I also, I was going to say, here's the, the song list for dance masters.

994
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,300
Let's see.

995
00:47:51,300 --> 00:48:01,980
So night of fire was one of, um, uh, yesterday was the other Para song and um, I don't know.

996
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:06,980
It might've been one of these other, uh, there's a lot of songs I don't recognize.

997
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:11,420
Maybe I can't stop falling in love super Euro version because that did have a Para.

998
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:13,220
That wasn't Para Para.

999
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:14,220
Okay.

1000
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,220
That was a Para Para song.

1001
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:16,220
I bet.

1002
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:17,220
That's it then.

1003
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,220
All right.

1004
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:19,220
Mystery solved.

1005
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:20,220
All right.

1006
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:21,220
Fair enough.

1007
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:24,100
If only it was that easy for companies to do well.

1008
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:29,500
Uh, THQ on the other hand has been having a rough, a boom, boom fire of their own.

1009
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:34,460
They've been having a rough, uh, rough year I should say.

1010
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:41,180
Um, first, you know, was it weeks ago with rumors that they've gotten rid of their 2014

1011
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:44,840
line up because of problems?

1012
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:48,580
Maybe they're, maybe this is the smoke to the fire I guess.

1013
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:56,380
Uh, first off, THQ received a, um, stock delisting notice and they basically have 180 calendar

1014
00:48:56,380 --> 00:49:03,460
days until July 23rd, um, to make the stock regain compliance for 10 consecutive business

1015
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:04,460
days.

1016
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:10,820
If the company can't comply, then they get taken off the stock market basically.

1017
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:16,180
And of course, uh, their stock has fallen quite a bit down to about 70 cents a share.

1018
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:19,420
Um, so that's not good.

1019
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:28,020
Also the CEO, um, they've taken a, uh, 50% pay cut and also the, uh, board of directors

1020
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:31,860
has, they've taken pay cuts as well.

1021
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:34,580
Meaning $10 million as opposed to 20.

1022
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:40,780
No, no, no, no, no, um, actually the CEO doesn't make

1023
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:41,780
millions of dollars.

1024
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:44,580
Uh, he does make quite a, you know, six figures.

1025
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:53,460
He dropped his salary from $718,500 a year to $359,250 a year.

1026
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:57,540
How's he going to scrape by is what I want to know, man, that's, that's some tough stuff

1027
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:58,540
right there.

1028
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:01,580
God, that's just disgusting.

1029
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:07,820
Um, and then of course, you know, uh, some of the other, you know, they've cut from three

1030
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:13,340
times the highest bonus to, was it the just as highest bonus ever.

1031
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:17,580
At least he wasn't forced to take the, um, you know, Apple CEO at Steve jobs used to

1032
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:20,020
get a dollar and then a bunch of stock options.

1033
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,020
Yeah.

1034
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:23,160
This guy wasn't forced to take the board.

1035
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:29,940
The board of directors, uh, they've, uh, decided to take 50% less cash compensation for a year.

1036
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:39,860
Um, also unfortunately with all these cuts and delisting threats come layoffs, uh, 240

1037
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:47,580
people, um, were set to be laid off and it would be, uh, I guess cross, uh, nine months.

1038
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:53,500
Um, they said it's, it should be a, let's see, you have time to finish whatever game

1039
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,820
they were working on.

1040
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:55,820
Yeah.

1041
00:50:55,820 --> 00:51:00,620
Uh, no, I don't believe 240, uh, 240 is the correct number.

1042
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:01,620
It's up to 240.

1043
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:05,740
I want to say it was a hundred and like 72 or something like that is what it's supposed

1044
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:06,740
to be.

1045
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:12,420
Um, and they said that this isn't anything that they were trying to hide, that the cuts

1046
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:18,320
were described in their statement last week and that no studios are a part of this.

1047
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:22,460
It's administration and publishing offices worldwide.

1048
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:30,980
And, uh, you know, also, um, it's, you know, do the varying employment guidelines around

1049
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:34,380
the world and internal finance considerations.

1050
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:40,220
The restructuring will be completed by February or I'm not February, September 30th, 2012,

1051
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:43,780
but most affected employees have already been notified.

1052
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:53,460
Um, and then on top of all that, um, you know, they've revealed that they've lost $56 million

1053
00:51:53,460 --> 00:52:01,620
in a quarter three, which, uh, that would, uh, let's see, quarter ending in December

1054
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,660
31st, 2011.

1055
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:06,140
I'm kind of surprised that they lost a lot of money.

1056
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:11,020
I guess they were just in the hole so much, um, that, you know, even though Saints Row

1057
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:21,060
III and WWE 12 did good, um, or, well, I should say, um, it just wasn't enough to kind of

1058
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:23,340
make up for the slump of sales.

1059
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,980
And they actually had a pretty good quarter.

1060
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:29,620
I mean, I think we started off with, I don't remember if Warhammer, no, I don't think Warhammer

1061
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:31,740
was in the, in that quarter.

1062
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:37,580
I think that was Q2, but anyways, regardless of that, one other game did come out in quarter

1063
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:42,060
three for them and that would have been U-Draw and they're not putting out any more of those.

1064
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:47,140
Is all of this like sad trombone stuff for THQ?

1065
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:49,300
Is it all because of U-Draw or is there?

1066
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:53,060
I don't think these, I don't think they could have, I mean, could one peripheral bring down

1067
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:57,620
a company like that or is it because they're, their kiddie games are not doing too well

1068
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:02,280
either, but their kiddie games not doing well, I don't think is a big deal because even this

1069
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:12,140
year they focused more on, um, well, not entirely, more so on, um, kiddie, or less on kiddie

1070
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:13,740
games, more on their core franchises.

1071
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:19,500
However though, they did have a few games come out that were kind of kiddie that did

1072
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,500
not do well.

1073
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:25,740
Like, for example, they had Kung Fu Panda 2, which kind of bombed, and you know what,

1074
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,860
it really is kind of their fault though, it bombed, I mean, let's see.

1075
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:33,900
They had it on the PS3, which no one really buys kids games on the PS3, the Xbox 360 version

1076
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:38,940
was Kinect required, the Wii version was U-Draw required, Wii right there, that is a problem,

1077
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:42,180
see if they had it, you know, kind of, that is a prime audience right there and you're

1078
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:49,060
really limiting it to people that buy your fucking tablet, which no one did, I mean,

1079
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,220
it's just kind of annoying.

1080
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:55,620
Dungeon Buster in our chatroom at chat.orangemanjr.com says Saints Row the Third and WWE 12 did well,

1081
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:58,540
but U-Draw crapped all over the good news for both games.

1082
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:01,260
It's just, it's really shocking to me, like, that U-Draw is...

1083
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:02,260
I don't think it was that.

1084
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:05,420
I don't think that that had a big...

1085
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:11,340
But U-Draw was a huge investment for them, and I mean, nobody bought it.

1086
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:16,780
Like the one on the Wii, that came out what, a year before, a couple years ago, that one

1087
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:21,620
got bought, but didn't they try to put that U-Draw tablet on the PS3?

1088
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:22,620
It was on PS3 and 360.

1089
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,180
That was a huge mistake.

1090
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:25,180
That was a huge mistake.

1091
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:28,220
Yeah, it came out, that was what they were trying to debut and they were trying to debut

1092
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:29,220
some other games.

1093
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:35,060
I would argue, literally, no one bought it on the PlayStation 3.

1094
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,940
I'd say probably close to no one bought it.

1095
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,500
Yeah, obviously, that's what I really mean.

1096
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:44,620
But then also, you know, they had the Penguins of Madagascar game and stuff like that that

1097
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:48,180
came out that no one gave a shit about.

1098
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:54,100
Is it maybe because if you tie into movies that aren't so successful at the box office,

1099
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:58,140
like, wasn't that, or what penguin movie was that?

1100
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:00,780
Well, it wasn't even a movie, it was just Penguins of Madagascar.

1101
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:03,980
It's all the DreamWorks properties is what they had.

1102
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:08,700
They had a SpongeBob game that no one gave a shit about that came out.

1103
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,180
It just, that stuff doesn't do well anymore.

1104
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:17,140
I mean, kind of, it's run its course and no one really cared about Puss in Boots the game.

1105
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:20,860
I mean, it's just like, eh, whatever, you know?

1106
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:23,140
Or the Penguins of Madagascar game, I mean...

1107
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:25,300
Well, if you're five, you might.

1108
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:26,300
Yeah, okay.

1109
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,300
That's really who those games are for.

1110
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,700
You might buy this for me on the Wii.

1111
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,700
Oh, well, it requires U-Draw.

1112
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,420
Well, fuck that, I'm not buying that.

1113
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:32,420
You know, it's...

1114
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:35,900
So I'm not gonna buy a seven-year-old peripheral for your game.

1115
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:43,020
You know what I feel really bad about is Ubisoft with their, what is it, their awesome tablet

1116
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:48,740
or whatever the fuck they called it, the Drawsome tablet, that they came out in December, the

1117
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:51,500
hey, we're gonna get, we're gonna enter in this market, too.

1118
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,700
It seems like they're doing well with that U-Draw.

1119
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,740
We're gonna put ours out.

1120
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,420
Pfft, tanked.

1121
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:01,460
Does that mean we could expect something really awful to come to Ubisoft soon, or do you think

1122
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,460
they had enough to keep them above water?

1123
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:05,020
I don't think that they're gonna release anything else for it.

1124
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:07,820
Luckily, they still have Assassin's Creed and enough things to kinda...

1125
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,900
Oh, well, they actually do quite a bit.

1126
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:10,900
No, no, I know, I know.

1127
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:14,820
A lot less with kid stuff recently, but they do quite a bit in the...

1128
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:19,700
Didn't Rocksmith do a little better than folks thought for like a really niche thing?

1129
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,220
Because, see, I know people on Facebook that are playing it.

1130
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:24,860
I would not have expected to be playing any video games at all.

1131
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:29,540
I think it did okay, um, I mean, it hasn't really been a huge hit.

1132
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:36,820
It did better than, um, was it the Six Strings Rise of, or was it the Rise of the Six Strings

1133
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:37,820
Team?

1134
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:40,820
Oh, yeah, that one kinda disappeared, didn't it?

1135
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:41,820
Yeah.

1136
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:43,900
Yeah, that wasn't very good.

1137
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:44,900
Anyway.

1138
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:47,180
That sounds dreadful.

1139
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:52,500
Well, that's too bad for, um, you know, THQ.

1140
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,060
I hope it doesn't impact Saints Row the 4th.

1141
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:57,220
Oh, no, no, it won't.

1142
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:01,420
I'm sure they're gonna do well, I mean, this year, like, kicking off things, they've got

1143
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:03,940
UFC 3, which will do well for them.

1144
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:05,740
That's in a couple weeks.

1145
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:12,660
They're gonna have, um, you know, Darksiders 2 coming, I think, in like May-ish, um, then

1146
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:18,180
of course, you know, they've got the South Park RPG game coming out later this year.

1147
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:19,580
Well, that'll be good, I hope.

1148
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:27,300
There'll be another WWE game, WWE 13, um, I'm sure there's gonna be some other, you

1149
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:34,140
know, big franchises that they're gonna have, um, I don't think Saints Row the 4th would

1150
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:39,340
be coming out any time soon, I would, I would hope not, I mean, I think it's too soon for

1151
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:43,800
something like that, but they're gonna have DLC for the 3rd coming out, and I think that's

1152
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:51,020
sold well for them, but, I don't know, I wouldn't worry about THQ, they're gonna be fine.

1153
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:52,020
Alright.

1154
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:58,520
But I would say, you know, that it, it really sucks that Nintendo didn't, um, embrace the

1155
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:02,580
whole U-Draw tablet, but you kinda see why they didn't, because of the direction that

1156
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:03,580
they went.

1157
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:06,580
Well, now, yeah, now with the Wii U, they, it's, might do their own thing.

1158
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:12,340
Hey, yeah, Nintendo may make a Mario Paint game for the Wii, or for the, uh, that U-Draw

1159
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:16,720
tablet, or they're gonna hold on to it for a little longer and make a Mario Paint game

1160
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,100
for the Wii U.

1161
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:20,580
That's probably more like it.

1162
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:27,180
Alright, well, speaking of the Wii U, um, Team Ninja has commented on the Wii U, talking

1163
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:32,460
about it, saying that it's pretty easy to develop for, uh, this is from, uh, an interview

1164
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:36,620
with Nintendo Gamer Magazine, where some of the folks from Team Ninja said that they're

1165
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:41,940
finding it very similar to develop for Wii U as for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, which

1166
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:45,740
is no surprise if what, it's true, what we've heard about the hardware in the past, that

1167
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:50,140
it's very similar to, like, just kind of an over, over-drived Xbox, basically, is what

1168
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:51,900
Nintendo Wii U is supposed to be.

1169
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:57,340
Um, they also said that the Wii U hardware keeps changing, uh, that echo statements that

1170
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:04,700
were made by, uh, Yoshinori Ono from Capcom last week, uh, apparently said something very

1171
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:10,780
similar, that the Wii U keeps changing some of the hardware, um, they're asking these

1172
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:15,220
developers from Team Ninja what they want from the hardware, and for feedback, uh, they

1173
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:19,580
keep listening, making changes and so forth, the hardware keeps changing.

1174
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:22,940
What we don't know is, what is changing about the hardware?

1175
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:28,860
Now, my thought is, I wouldn't take the hardware is changing to mean, suddenly, this system

1176
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:33,540
is not gonna have the tablet or any of that stuff, that's, that's here to stay, like,

1177
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:35,100
that isn't going anywhere, right?

1178
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:39,260
I think they're either, they're too well, they're, they've gone all in on that, so,

1179
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:43,100
after last year's E3, they can't suddenly come out and say, well, we decided to scrap

1180
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:46,740
the tablet, ha ha, you know, right?

1181
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:50,060
They're gonna, they're just changing what's inside, because they don't fucking know, I

1182
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:55,500
mean, it's like, they're like, well, we've got this box that represents, just imagine,

1183
00:59:55,500 --> 01:00:00,540
if you will, a console that'll do amazing things, imagine it, because we don't have

1184
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:05,060
one yet, it's just this box that's sitting here that's actually, uh, well, it's about

1185
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:09,660
time to commit, because, in a couple months, they're gonna have to show that to the world,

1186
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:15,260
if they want to get that thing out this year, it's gotta be at E3, and it's gotta be good.

1187
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:18,500
It better be, I'm telling ya.

1188
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:21,780
Although if Team Ninja's developing for, uh, this, that means that, that, you know, where

1189
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:23,500
the next Dead or Alive game's gonna show up.

1190
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:26,140
No, I think it's Ninja Gaiden, they already said that they're gonna have a Ninja Gaiden

1191
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:27,140
game for it.

1192
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:28,140
Oh, that's right, they did.

1193
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:30,020
And it's basically a port of Ninja Gaiden 3, so.

1194
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:33,180
And Team Ninja and Nintendo have a little history, they did, uh, Team Ninja did the

1195
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:36,940
Metroid Other M game, which, you know, although it didn't sell very well, it wasn't a bad

1196
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:38,820
game, by any means, it's pretty neat.

1197
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:39,820
Yeah.

1198
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:40,820
So.

1199
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:41,820
Interesting.

1200
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:42,820
I just...

1201
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:43,820
What?

1202
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:51,860
I hope they don't fuck it up, I'm just saying, I mean, I, I think I'm, I'm hopeful that it'll

1203
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:53,820
be a good system, but...

1204
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:59,060
Just say the HG Mario and HZ Zelda game will be out this Christmas, and it'll, it'll print

1205
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:00,060
money.

1206
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,060
It will.

1207
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:02,060
Keep your fingers crossed.

1208
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:05,620
It has to put those key franchises on it, and that's really what's gonna drive the system.

1209
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:10,400
And if, if you doubt what I'm saying, 3DS.

1210
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,740
That thing did not start selling until they put the Zelda remake on it, and it sold a

1211
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:18,300
little bit, and then when they put Mario Kart 7 and 3D Land on it, boom!

1212
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,940
Now it's selling tons.

1213
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:20,940
And when they dropped the price.

1214
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:21,940
Oh yeah, that too.

1215
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:23,940
That had a little bit to do with it.

1216
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:27,140
That did have a little bit to do with it.

1217
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:30,540
But well, then the price point is certainly important for the Wii U as well, you know,

1218
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:36,860
if they get up on stage and say, Wii U is 599 US dollars, 599, no, no, no, no, no,

1219
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:37,860
no, no.

1220
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:38,860
Ridge Racer!

1221
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:39,860
299.

1222
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:42,020
It, it's gotta be 299, right?

1223
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:43,660
No higher than 299.

1224
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:46,860
It can't be 2, or it can't be higher than 299.

1225
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:47,860
Yeah.

1226
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:48,860
It's...

1227
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:49,860
I...

1228
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:50,860
I...

1229
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:51,860
I...

1230
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:52,860
You don't even want it to be 299.

1231
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:55,220
I don't even see it being 299.

1232
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:59,180
I mean, I don't know.

1233
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:00,180
We'll see.

1234
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:04,380
By the time we get there, I mean, the other consoles could be lower in price, I don't

1235
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:05,380
know.

1236
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:06,380
I'm...

1237
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:07,380
I'm...

1238
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:12,260
I'm gonna be sitting back and watching what happens, cause, I don't know.

1239
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:15,660
Why don't they just say the games will only be 40 bucks, as opposed to 60?

1240
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:17,140
That would go a long way.

1241
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:19,260
It'll go a very long way.

1242
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:21,860
Alright, anyhow.

1243
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:26,540
Brakeman in her chatroom at chat.thatorangelaunchmedia.com says, I hope they change the name from Wii

1244
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:30,380
2 to something else that would be easier for me to make penis jokes for it.

1245
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:33,380
Well, there was some rumors last week that they are gonna change the name.

1246
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:39,540
I don't know how much that will, uh, you know, really come to light.

1247
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:44,820
RDGSinge in our chatroom says, anyway, it's probably three Gamecubes duct taped together.

1248
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:45,820
Alright.

1249
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:49,300
So, you were curious on, uh, Rocksmith sales?

1250
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:50,300
Yeah.

1251
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:58,420
We have 50,000 copies in the US on 360, uh, basically a total of, uh, 610,000 copies.

1252
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:03,540
That's pretty, for what's essentially a really niche title, I really consider that, that's

1253
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:04,940
pretty darn good.

1254
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:05,940
I think.

1255
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:06,940
Yeah.

1256
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:07,940
So.

1257
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:08,940
Alright.

1258
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:10,940
Anyhow.

1259
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:11,940
Let's move on.

1260
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:12,940
DarkSakura.

1261
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:21,180
Well, in other news, there is a proposition to put a one percent tax on violent video

1262
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:22,180
games.

1263
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:23,180
I know.

1264
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:24,180
Stupid.

1265
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:29,260
Um, this is actually coming from Oklahoma, which, it's Oklahoma.

1266
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:31,140
Oh, Oklahoma.

1267
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:37,580
Anyway, it was introduced by state representative William Forekiller.

1268
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:38,580
Great name.

1269
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:44,100
Forekiller, F-O-U-R-K-I-L-L-E-R, that any title that's rated teen, mature, and adult

1270
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:47,460
only would fall under that spectrum.

1271
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:50,780
That's the game that Team Ninja is making for the Wii U, actually, is Forekiller.

1272
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:51,780
Go figure.

1273
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:54,300
But you know what else that would include?

1274
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:59,460
Dance Central 2 and Final Fantasy 13 2.

1275
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:05,300
Oh, because those games are rated T for teen because of, um, what, language and all that

1276
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,300
stuff, right?

1277
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:07,300
I guess.

1278
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:10,540
Um, but he wants to donate- Somebody said Hell in 13 2.

1279
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:12,380
I was like, oh, no she didn't.

1280
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:17,020
But the, um, well, what about all the crap they said in 7?

1281
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:19,660
Yeah, Barrett said shit and- Well, anyway-

1282
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:22,020
Does anyone ever drop the F bomb in a Final Fantasy game?

1283
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:23,260
Final Fantasy fuck?

1284
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:26,500
Can I finish?

1285
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:27,500
No.

1286
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:35,300
Anyway, half of the revenues that, um, would go to, uh, donate the childhood outdoor education

1287
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:42,980
revolving fund, um, which is, uh, basically making kids get outside and play.

1288
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:47,140
And the other half is the bully prevention revolving fund.

1289
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:54,020
So it's, it's got a good heart behind it.

1290
01:04:54,020 --> 01:05:01,420
But I think that it's- Well, okay, actually, here's a good quote on here.

1291
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:06,820
From the senior designer of Mass Effect 3, that's Manveer Hare, Air, I guess.

1292
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:10,180
Oklahoma proposes a 1% tax on violent games.

1293
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:14,820
Can I propose a 1% tax on stupid fucking ideas that are also unconstitutional?

1294
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:15,820
Yeah.

1295
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:18,260
I mean, this is going to be a losing battle.

1296
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:19,900
We've already seen this stuff.

1297
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:24,420
You heard us go off last week on the whole California has to pay the ESA of the Supreme

1298
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:25,420
Court thing.

1299
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:26,660
And I do get what you're saying.

1300
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:30,340
I think it is like, you know, at the core of it, it's nice that he's trying to do something

1301
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:31,340
for charity.

1302
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:32,340
I guess.

1303
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:35,220
But this just speaks- No one's asking him to do anything for charity.

1304
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:36,700
Well, yeah, it's that.

1305
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:42,020
And if you really want to tax violence, put a 1% tax on guns.

1306
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:44,820
You know, put it on something that's across the board.

1307
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:48,240
I do have- I have to say this.

1308
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:54,700
To say that guns cause violence is the same thing that says pencils cause bad spelling.

1309
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:56,960
Then put a 1% tax on pencils.

1310
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,620
But the problem- Put the tax on a gun license.

1311
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:01,120
Okay, fine.

1312
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:04,460
The thing is, at least that's kind of constant.

1313
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:10,860
But to put a 1% tax on a subset of video games strikes me as very odd.

1314
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:14,100
Would you put a 1% tax on R-rated movies?

1315
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:17,740
Would you put a 1% tax on- Well, no, because we're afraid of the MPAA.

1316
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:22,020
Would you put a tax on 1% books that are not for young adults or children?

1317
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:28,100
Like would you put a 1% tax on the, you know, I don't know, you know, entire fiction section

1318
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:29,100
of Barnes and Noble?

1319
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:32,060
We're gonna put a 1% tax on contraceptives.

1320
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:36,860
Would you put a 1% tax on parental advisory labels on CDs?

1321
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:37,860
I mean, no.

1322
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:40,820
This is all- it's ridiculous in practice.

1323
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:44,920
It's just- and it's somebody who does- that just speaks- you know, it's a big surprise.

1324
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:47,700
A politician who doesn't get video games.

1325
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,260
But it just really speaks to somebody.

1326
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:52,540
And then, you know, did he try to use that hole for the children?

1327
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:53,540
It's for the children.

1328
01:06:53,540 --> 01:07:02,180
Yes, pretty much, to combat childhood obesity, to stop bullying, and what I was going to

1329
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:08,600
say about that is that he's basically trying to do the same thing that all these other

1330
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:13,020
places have done to curtail the sale of these video games by making them more expensive

1331
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:17,320
by putting a tax on it and sugarcoating it with a, oh, but this is gonna do all this

1332
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,900
good if this goes by.

1333
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:22,780
He's trying to trick the gullible, which unfortunately most of the public is.

1334
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:23,780
Sorry.

1335
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:27,340
And you know those violent video games, they pack on the pounds.

1336
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:32,220
I'm telling ya, if I'm not, like, you know, killing people in a game, I'm just losing

1337
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:33,220
weight.

1338
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:38,220
Because, um, yeah, I don't understand the argument that, you know, putting a tax on

1339
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:44,160
teen-rated and up games is gonna somehow get kids to be slimmer.

1340
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:48,140
Because they're gonna be like, damn, I can afford that game, but I can't pay that 1%

1341
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:50,140
tax, I better go outside and exercise.

1342
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:53,820
I think you actually missed what I said about that.

1343
01:07:53,820 --> 01:08:00,220
He said that the proceeds were gonna be in half donated to services that get children

1344
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:02,260
to go outside and exercise.

1345
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:08,020
So that's the thing, is it's kinda like, it's indirectly for the children because I'm tying

1346
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:12,180
this nice little charity and all the money's gonna go to good, but, you know.

1347
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:16,220
Why don't you tax them, like, 500%, then they can't afford the games and they'll go out

1348
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:17,220
and exercise.

1349
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:18,780
And then the charities will get a ton of money.

1350
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:24,340
I mean, I don't understand, why do we need a program to get people to go outside, I mean,

1351
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:25,340
is it that bad?

1352
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:26,980
Why don't parents do their fucking job?

1353
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:29,100
End of story.

1354
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:30,100
Parents do your job.

1355
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:32,220
Your kids are fat, send them outside.

1356
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:33,220
The end.

1357
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:35,520
You know what I did when I was bored when I was a kid?

1358
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,820
And I had a Nintendo?

1359
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:38,820
I went and rode my bike.

1360
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:39,820
Uphill.

1361
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:40,820
Twice.

1362
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:41,820
In the snow?

1363
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:42,820
No.

1364
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:43,820
We didn't have snow in Alabama, what are you talking about?

1365
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:45,020
Or even better- In the swamp!

1366
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:46,300
Which is worse than the snow.

1367
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:47,300
Or even better.

1368
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:51,540
Like, stop feeding your kids their sugary foods or whatever, you know, get them to go

1369
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:52,540
outside.

1370
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:53,540
I mean, come on.

1371
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:56,460
There's a lot of contributing factors for people getting overweight.

1372
01:08:56,460 --> 01:09:00,420
It's not because you're just playing video games, it's because you're eating like shit

1373
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:02,180
and you're sitting around doing nothing.

1374
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:03,180
You know what, kids?

1375
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:07,300
If you want to lose weight, you just need to have more unprotected sex.

1376
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:09,820
It's exercise.

1377
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:13,300
Sexercise.

1378
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:14,300
I'm kidding, use a condom.

1379
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:15,300
Please use a condom.

1380
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:20,100
You told children to go have sex, that is so wrong.

1381
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:21,740
But it's exercise?

1382
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:26,660
That's for the public school system to tell our kids to go have sex.

1383
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:28,020
That's where my good money's going.

1384
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:32,140
Alright, now we need to change the topic, Loki.

1385
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:33,460
You sure I don't have another topic?

1386
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,460
Dark Soccer's left the room.

1387
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:40,260
But, but we were just talking about...

1388
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:47,180
So let's talk a little bit about our favorite topic, at least it has been the last few weeks,

1389
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:52,500
and that is online passes.

1390
01:09:52,500 --> 01:10:00,060
And I kind of wonder if they don't understand what the online pass thing means, because

1391
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:05,220
they're putting it on games that don't have online portions to them, they're not putting

1392
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:09,700
it on games that have online portions to them, they're not locking people out with...

1393
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:11,220
I just don't understand.

1394
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:17,820
So first off, SSX, big sports, extreme sports game coming out from EA, it's gonna have an

1395
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:18,820
online pass.

1396
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:21,540
Not a big surprise, because they have a big online portion of it.

1397
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:26,500
What's kind of neat about it though, is that the online pass, if you do not have it, will

1398
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:29,980
not lock people out of playing multiplayer.

1399
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:36,260
You just won't get any of the in-game credits used to unlock content while playing multiplayer.

1400
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:37,260
So that's kind of cool.

1401
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:40,580
You can at least play with your friends still if you have it used.

1402
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:46,220
Wait, you mean to say that some companies find the value in not having an online pass?

1403
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:52,060
Well come on, this is the same company that just put an online pass on an offline game.

1404
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:58,100
And to be fair, that wasn't really an online pass, that was just free DLC that they labeled

1405
01:10:58,100 --> 01:10:59,540
something completely stupid.

1406
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:06,900
It was like, instead of saying, ooh, free gift, it was like, pay money or get raped.

1407
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:10,340
It's like, you know, not...

1408
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:13,100
If you just called it a free gift, it wouldn't have sounded so bad.

1409
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:14,100
Why'd you call it get raped?

1410
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,820
I mean, that doesn't make any sense.

1411
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:17,900
Why would you do that?

1412
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:22,420
So they're doing that for SSX, and so if you don't want to buy the game, or if you rent

1413
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:26,140
it, you can still play it online, you just won't be able to unlock your little tokens

1414
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:32,820
or shit for your download content, or unlocking in-game things, big deal.

1415
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:38,260
However what's kind of weird though is a co-op shooter, Syndicate, also coming out from EA,

1416
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:40,940
is not going to have an online pass at all.

1417
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:42,820
Just, eh, whatever reason.

1418
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:49,460
They say we want little resistance or barriers to entry as possible.

1419
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:53,640
I think a lot of guys say that too.

1420
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:54,640
The co-op...

1421
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,400
I had to come back in the room, didn't I?

1422
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,780
The co-op is equal billing in this.

1423
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:03,060
We wanted everyone who owns a copy of the game to have access to the entire product.

1424
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:07,460
Well now that's fair, if they recognize that like the core element of their game is the

1425
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:12,740
online part, you don't fucking gate it behind a pass, right?

1426
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:20,140
But yet they do, for Battlefield 3, for Madden, for, you know, NBA, well they don't have an

1427
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:24,380
NBA game, but when they do have another NBA game, probably this year, NBA Jam might have

1428
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:25,380
one.

1429
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:29,460
Oh no, because the Xbox 360 and PS3 are already online only.

1430
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:31,460
Yeah, so...

1431
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:35,180
And the Wii online, hahaha.

1432
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:41,860
Need for Speed, I mean, all this shit had these online passes, but I do like the direction

1433
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:45,740
they're going, and I want to fucking have every time that they have a goddamn online

1434
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:50,740
pass that EA says, we stand behind this online pass, I want them to fucking quote what they

1435
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:51,740
said.

1436
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:56,220
Just as little resistance or barriers to entry as possible, because that's really what you're

1437
01:12:56,220 --> 01:13:00,340
doing is you're telling people, eh, we only want you the player games if you have the

1438
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:01,340
money to buy it new.

1439
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:05,260
If not, we don't really give a fuck, we want you to go away, because you cost us too much

1440
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:07,620
money to run our servers.

1441
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:08,620
God.

1442
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:12,500
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1443
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,780
Yeah, I'll come back.

1444
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:19,820
There was something I was going to rant about this week, and I just reminded myself.

1445
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:20,820
Oh goody.

1446
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:24,860
And I think it was something along the lines of this online pass thing.

1447
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:27,620
We'll get to that later.

1448
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:29,900
Alright.

1449
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:31,940
Is there another story coming up later that's going to prompt that?

1450
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:37,740
I don't think so, but it was something I posted on Twitter, and I had to refresh my memory.

1451
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:39,540
Just explode on the rant at a random point in the show.

1452
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:44,020
It was something about how used games steal money from developers, I think it was.

1453
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,020
Oh yes, so it was.

1454
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,620
Alright, look, well moving on.

1455
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:53,140
Old games still give money to the folks that own the rights to them these days, and old

1456
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:57,140
games will suddenly become new again on the 3DS, and the old games are coming from the

1457
01:13:57,140 --> 01:13:58,780
Game Gear.

1458
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:03,340
That's right, apparently virtual console games for a non-Nintendo platform, of course in

1459
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:09,220
this case Sega, have shown up for 3DS release by the good old ESRB, who has spoiled the

1460
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:13,140
releases of Shinobi and Sonic Triple Trouble.

1461
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:15,100
So those games apparently have been spotted.

1462
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:19,820
To be fair, the ESRB, remember that one of the things that they could do, that the publishers

1463
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:23,740
could tell them not to list their stuff on there, so it's the fucking publisher's fault.

1464
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:27,260
Yeah, they might have forgot to check that box in the forum, who knows.

1465
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:32,140
Now it's worth noting that at some point TurboGrafx-16 games were supposed to be available on the

1466
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:36,080
3DS, but who knows if that's really going to happen anymore at some point because there's

1467
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,080
no more Hudson.

1468
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:43,580
Well, doesn't Konami inherently own all their old licenses, or am I wrong?

1469
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:44,580
Couldn't Konami?

1470
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:45,580
I think they do, yeah.

1471
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:46,580
I think they could.

1472
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:47,580
I think they do, so I don't know.

1473
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:52,300
But anyhow, yeah, so Game Gear games are on their way to the 3DS, but let's be real, Dark

1474
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:55,380
Soccer is going to bitch slap me for this, but were there really any that good Game Gear

1475
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:56,380
games?

1476
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:57,380
Yes!

1477
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:58,380
What?

1478
01:14:58,380 --> 01:14:59,380
Gunstar Heroes.

1479
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:03,660
Was that really a Game Gear game?

1480
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:05,980
I bought it for Dan for 30 bucks.

1481
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:06,980
Oh, that's right.

1482
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:07,980
I remember that.

1483
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:09,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1484
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:12,820
There were really good, I think there was Puyo Puyo.

1485
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:15,260
There was Sonic Spinball.

1486
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:18,460
The Lion King game, of all things, was actually really good on Game Gear.

1487
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:22,380
So yeah, there were a lot of really good games.

1488
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:27,180
The Disney games on Genesis and all that stuff were, like Aladdin and shit, were like really

1489
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:28,180
good.

1490
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:32,460
It was like an interesting phase where like Sega and Disney just kind of had this really

1491
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:34,060
great harmony going on.

1492
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:37,580
And if I do recall correctly, I think there were a number of Master System games that

1493
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:40,420
were converted for Game Gear use, so.

1494
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:44,580
All I remember were that those things were so fucking huge and just drained your batteries.

1495
01:15:44,580 --> 01:15:47,620
But now, you know, the 3DS will drain your battery.

1496
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:49,260
It'll be about as fast.

1497
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:53,980
But at least you can recharge your 3DS without having to go buy AA batteries.

1498
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:57,700
So Dark Sakura is going to read us a story and then we're going to get to the release

1499
01:15:57,700 --> 01:15:58,900
dates.

1500
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:04,300
Once upon a time, there was a game called Skyrim, and everyone was like, oh my god,

1501
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:10,780
the menu sucks, so people hacked it and put out little ads for it on PC.

1502
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:16,820
Well, finally, the people at Bethesda were like, I guess people really don't like how

1503
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:19,700
we do this and want different stuff for the game.

1504
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:25,100
So there is a PC creation kit coming out for The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim, and it will be

1505
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:28,860
on Steam on Tuesday.

1506
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:37,100
And it's, uh, you can apparently just download it in the tools tab.

1507
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:39,960
So I guess people will be happy for it.

1508
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:43,700
I'm slowly starting to regret not getting Skyrim on the PC.

1509
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:46,580
I wish a lot of these cool things would come to like the PlayStation 3.

1510
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:48,180
I thought some of it was supposed to.

1511
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:50,220
I could be wrong, though.

1512
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:53,580
But like, I've looked like Alan is he's in there playing Skyrim right now.

1513
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:57,300
He's hacked the shit out of that game, like, you know, well, I mean, like, he's still playing

1514
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:58,300
by the rules.

1515
01:16:58,300 --> 01:16:59,300
Mostly.

1516
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:00,300
I don't think he's really cheated a lot.

1517
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:03,820
But, you know, like his interface doesn't even look right to me.

1518
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:06,220
Like it's all but it's it's really well organized.

1519
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:07,220
I like it.

1520
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:09,420
It's just like he's just done so many hacks to it.

1521
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:12,740
How many of us have wow that look exactly like it did when we first got it?

1522
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:13,740
That's true.

1523
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:14,740
That's true.

1524
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:15,740
But that is something that Blizzard embraces.

1525
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:19,300
And that's part of why it's better than a lot of MMOs, by the way.

1526
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:23,300
But anyway, let's travel around the world and look at release dates and talk about games

1527
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:25,900
that you'll be able to hack soon in a store near you.

1528
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:28,060
Loki, we'll start with the U.S. dates.

1529
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:34,600
There's actually some stuff this week, not really a game, but Connect for Windows came

1530
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,600
out this week.

1531
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,600
So that's neat.

1532
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:43,900
OK, so next week we've got some stuff re-released at Fallout New Vegas, the Ultimate Edition

1533
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:45,520
with all the DLC included.

1534
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:51,580
They have that coming out on all three systems, PS3, 360, and the PC.

1535
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:56,740
The Darkness 2 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC as well.

1536
01:17:56,740 --> 01:18:01,740
The Jak and Daxter Collection for PS3 will be coming out.

1537
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:09,820
Resident Evil Revelations with an extra I, at least on the packaging.

1538
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:14,140
And that's coming out on 3DS only.

1539
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:21,460
Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

1540
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:28,020
We also have the Zumba Fitness Rush on Xbox 360.

1541
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:31,380
That'll be out on Sunday.

1542
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:35,260
And uh, yeah.

1543
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:36,260
That's it.

1544
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:43,620
Oh, oh, and as I remember, remind you, the 3DS Circle Pad Pro will be out in GameStop.

1545
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:45,620
Yay.

1546
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:48,520
Irritated.

1547
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:54,540
Is there any chance if I wait it out it'll come to another retailer?

1548
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:59,360
I guess there's nothing I need it for right now, so I'm just gonna hold my breath.

1549
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:02,140
Let's go to Japan and take a look at what's coming out over in Japan.

1550
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:04,360
Xbox 360's looking a little dry this week.

1551
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:08,520
Just a game getting a price reduction, that's Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition.

1552
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:11,300
It's a price reduction this week on the 9th.

1553
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:15,860
Heading on over to the PlayStation 3 and checking out what's coming there.

1554
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:20,860
Same thing, price reduction there, but there's also a game from Atlus called The Cursed Crusade

1555
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:22,740
comes out from Atlus this week.

1556
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:23,740
The Cursed Crusade?

1557
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:24,740
The Cursed Crusade.

1558
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:26,020
I could see it.

1559
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:27,020
Cursehead though.

1560
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:31,580
Um, I'm trying to see what- That hasn't come out over there yet?

1561
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:32,580
No, I guess not.

1562
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:33,580
I'm surprised.

1563
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:35,180
It came out over here back in October.

1564
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:36,180
I don't think it's a price reduction.

1565
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:37,740
No, it's definitely not a price reduction.

1566
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:41,060
It might be like a localized version for them.

1567
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:42,660
So, interesting.

1568
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:46,100
Uh, so yeah, that's coming out this week.

1569
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:50,340
Well, sometimes they get the games a little later than we do, you know?

1570
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:55,940
Uh, remember the PlayStation Vita Vita Vegemans already out in Japan, so they have some new

1571
01:19:55,940 --> 01:19:56,940
games this week.

1572
01:19:56,940 --> 01:20:02,100
Gravity Days comes out this week, and Sumioni, I think I'm saying that right, comes out this

1573
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:03,100
week on the Vita.

1574
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:07,780
Um, I'm trying to see if this is a game- I'm trying to see if this looks familiar to me.

1575
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:12,900
I'm looking at a little trailer for Sumiomi here in the studio to see if it's one that

1576
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:14,900
I recognized.

1577
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:17,980
I like the art style in this game.

1578
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:22,060
Uh, I've seen the, uh- It looks a little bit like Okami.

1579
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:24,580
Oh, it's an ink game.

1580
01:20:24,580 --> 01:20:27,060
Sumie is a type of drawing with ink.

1581
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:28,180
It looks like the background there.

1582
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:30,860
I saw this when they were talking about, uh, Vita stuff.

1583
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:32,980
I actually saw the video for it.

1584
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:35,620
I don't remember what's being called over here though.

1585
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:39,820
But that game is coming out this week in Japan, because, you know, they already have the Vita

1586
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:41,340
over there.

1587
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:46,580
Uh, looking at the other handheld real quick, I'm just gonna look really quickly at the

1588
01:20:46,580 --> 01:20:48,900
Wii, see if there's anything worth mentioning, no.

1589
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:51,560
Um, how about the 3DS though?

1590
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:52,560
Not really.

1591
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:53,560
Nothing until the 14th.

1592
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:57,820
Nude Love Plus comes out on the 14th, with plenty of art book limited editions if you

1593
01:20:57,820 --> 01:20:58,820
want to check that out.

1594
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:00,500
I thought for a second there you said Nude Love Plus.

1595
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:01,500
I was like- No.

1596
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:03,220
Oh no, that would be a whole different- Well played!

1597
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:05,900
That would be a whole different 3DS game right there.

1598
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:07,860
Alright, that does it for Japanese releases.

1599
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:08,860
Dark Sakura?

1600
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:13,820
On this, um, in the UK on the 7th we have Combat Wings The Great Battles of World War

1601
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:18,260
II, Gotham City Impostors- Sorry.

1602
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:21,620
House of the Dead 3 and The Simpsons Arcade for PS3.

1603
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:26,200
On the 8th of February we have more Gotham City crap.

1604
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:28,280
On the 9th we have Cell Emergence.

1605
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:34,420
On the 10th, Catherine for Xbox 360 and PS3, that game is messed up.

1606
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:40,380
EA Sports Grand Slam Tennis 2, Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning, uh, Mario and Sonic at the

1607
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:46,540
London Olympic Games on 3DS, One Piece Unlimited Cruise Special, and The Darkness 2.

1608
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:48,060
That's it.

1609
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:52,700
Alrighty, just a couple more stories for you guys, then we're gonna get to the classic

1610
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:54,880
game of the week, but first-

1611
01:21:54,880 --> 01:22:03,140
So, there's some talk saying, you know, Iwata is actually interested in doing some, you

1612
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:05,820
know, microtransactions with the Wii U.

1613
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:13,820
One of the pieces of technology that they may be incorporating for the Wii U is near-field

1614
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:20,460
communication, which will allow you to, for example, read credit cards if, you know, those

1615
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:24,440
have like, you know, the pay pass thing, I don't remember what they call them.

1616
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:28,500
I think it's pay pass, it's basically that kind of communication where you touch the

1617
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:33,140
credit card up to the machine and away you go.

1618
01:22:33,140 --> 01:22:38,500
Or you know, like, Skylanders sort of has that, so, but they're saying that, you know,

1619
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:44,620
it can provide a system in which consumers can use e-money, they'll find it much more

1620
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:51,380
easily be able to make payments by then entering credit card numbers or by purchasing Nintendo

1621
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:56,540
prepaid cards at the store.

1622
01:22:56,540 --> 01:23:01,340
You know, of course, they're, you know, trying to support DLC, but they want to do it in

1623
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:05,660
a way that's not, you know, crazy.

1624
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:14,380
Also, they're throwing out the idea that, you know, maybe, maybe Super Mario Land 3D

1625
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:21,220
or Mario Kart may get DLC, which I would be happy with that, I think they should do that.

1626
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:27,500
You know, what if we could provide add-on content through the network, posing the question

1627
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:28,500
there.

1628
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:33,180
As I referred to before, for example, like everyone else does, yeah, this idea of supplying

1629
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:37,740
new stages as Super Mario users who want to play the game more, but have completed the

1630
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:43,760
game and lost interest in existing state or in the, you know, existing stages, this will

1631
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:49,980
not only give us new profits, but then lengthen the life of the product and that it will never

1632
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:55,420
appear to be out of fashion and can keep attracting public attention as long as many people play

1633
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:56,420
it.

1634
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:57,420
No shit!

1635
01:23:57,420 --> 01:24:00,420
People have been doing this for fucking years now, and you just figured this out?

1636
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:02,420
Oh my God.

1637
01:24:02,420 --> 01:24:03,420
That's fantastic.

1638
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:07,300
Yeah, I can't wait to see what breakthrough ideas will come with the Wii U.

1639
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:11,860
Hey, hey guys, we're gonna have this, we're gonna have this thing called online.

1640
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:16,620
People can play without being in the same room.

1641
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:22,580
You have to admit, as behind the times as Nintendo is, there is almost that benefit

1642
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:27,180
to them being behind the times that you don't have this online pass garbage on any of the

1643
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:28,180
Nintendo games.

1644
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:29,180
Yes you do.

1645
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:30,180
Do you?

1646
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:31,180
Yes you do.

1647
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:32,180
Which game?

1648
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:33,180
What?

1649
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:34,180
You have the U-Pass that's on the...

1650
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:35,180
God, really?

1651
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:42,300
And the online passes do apply to the Wii games for Madden, for example, has online

1652
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:46,780
pass, I believe, and it's just a lot of those corgis.

1653
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:48,780
Well then I stand corrected.

1654
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:54,860
Yeah, unfortunately they do have that stuff, they are not exempt from it.

1655
01:24:54,860 --> 01:24:58,020
It's just that there's not a lot of big games that come out, so that's why you don't hear

1656
01:24:58,020 --> 01:24:59,020
a lot of it.

1657
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:05,780
But yeah, I mean, come on, they do these really amazing things sometimes, like the 3D is kind

1658
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:09,700
of cool, you know, the motion controls and stuff like that, and at the same time, say

1659
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:14,400
hey we got this one cool thing, oh but we forgot to like totally update everything else.

1660
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,940
It's just like, oh shit you guys want HD graphics?

1661
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:17,940
Well we didn't fucking do that.

1662
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:18,940
Oh, online?

1663
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:19,940
Nah.

1664
01:25:19,940 --> 01:25:20,940
But hey, you got motion controls?

1665
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:21,940
I mean, isn't that what you wanted?

1666
01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:22,940
Something new?

1667
01:25:22,940 --> 01:25:25,100
Hey, 3D, it's got 3D, that's awesome.

1668
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:26,100
DLC?

1669
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:28,060
Ah fuck, well we just didn't do DLC yet.

1670
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:31,980
We're gonna patch it in later, I'm sure, you know, we will eventually, and we'll support

1671
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:32,980
it someday.

1672
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:39,660
You know, maybe, yeah, we'll put out another system or something, I'll have DLC in there.

1673
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:47,460
Let me rephrase the point I made earlier, since Loki owned me.

1674
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:52,700
Because most of the stuff worth buying on the Wii is from Nintendo themselves, and Nintendo's

1675
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:56,460
buying the times, we don't have any of this online pass garbage.

1676
01:25:56,460 --> 01:25:57,460
Exactly.

1677
01:25:57,460 --> 01:25:59,660
Okay, at least we can agree on that.

1678
01:25:59,660 --> 01:26:05,020
Alright, well, congrats to Nintendo for getting on the DLC train, I guess, I just hope they

1679
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:06,860
don't go overboard with all this.

1680
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:10,660
Now we know how to charge people, yay.

1681
01:26:10,660 --> 01:26:17,900
Alright, sometimes your money just goes to these very interesting places where you just

1682
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:21,660
wish you'd never spent it in the first place, and I think that's what a lot of Mass Effect

1683
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:22,940
fans are feeling this week.

1684
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:25,300
No, I'm not talking about the game, don't worry.

1685
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:27,700
But I am talking about the spinoff book series.

1686
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:31,580
A book came out this, I guess, I don't know if it was last week or about a month ago,

1687
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:33,860
called Mass Effect Deception.

1688
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:38,140
And apparently the book has just got tons and tons of errors.

1689
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:45,180
And I'm talking like the type that, if you're a lore nerd, are just like terribly bad errors.

1690
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:51,060
For example, oh, actually they have put together a document, I guess, online on Google, that's

1691
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:58,740
a pretty neat community idea, that has 80 errors in the book, all together.

1692
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:04,860
I'm trying to actually pull this up right now and see if, they talk about like the Citadel

1693
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:07,340
is the wrong state.

1694
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:12,260
One of the characters kills an alien by slicing into the back of its neck and severing the

1695
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:17,300
spine, but you can't really do that with this type of alien because they're not biologically

1696
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:18,300
set up that way.

1697
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:22,900
So it's like, it's almost like, you know how like when Star Trek kind of gets the canon

1698
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:24,860
wrong and the fans are up in arms?

1699
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:27,340
Like the whole series of Enterprise?

1700
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:34,980
So like 80 different errors they've all put together and stuff and yeah, timeline errors

1701
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:35,980
and things like that.

1702
01:27:35,980 --> 01:27:41,620
So apparently it's gotten to the point where BioWare actually came out and said, the teams

1703
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:46,220
at Delray and BioWare would like to extend our sincerest apologies to the Mass Effect

1704
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:51,940
fans for any errors and oversights made in the recent novel, Mass Effect Deception.

1705
01:27:51,940 --> 01:27:56,380
We are currently working on a number of changes that will appear in future editions of the

1706
01:27:56,380 --> 01:27:57,780
novel.

1707
01:27:57,780 --> 01:28:03,340
I don't know how that, so in other words, they're going to, it was all a dream or, you

1708
01:28:03,340 --> 01:28:05,260
know, alternate timeline.

1709
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:06,980
That whole book was an alternate universe.

1710
01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:07,980
Surprise.

1711
01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:11,780
This is what happens when you write books like you write games.

1712
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:15,240
Can't fucking patch a book.

1713
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:16,700
You cannot patch a book.

1714
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:23,020
Oh, you can, apparently you just, you know, print it later, but, oh yeah, that's not everything.

1715
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:26,900
Like, hey the Wii, can't patch anything, so we better get it right the first time.

1716
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:30,980
Or we'll have to put out, no, because remember what they had to do for the Zelda save games?

1717
01:28:30,980 --> 01:28:36,060
They had to put out the Zelda save game patching channel.

1718
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:41,780
You have to admit that's kind of funny.

1719
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:42,780
Kind of funny.

1720
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:44,660
That's kind of terrible.

1721
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:47,020
Always a hoot and a holler here on the show.

1722
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:52,020
The classic game of the Wii.

1723
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:55,420
Mark Sacker likes to dive into the classic gaming vault every week and pull out a game

1724
01:28:55,420 --> 01:29:00,180
that she thinks, hey, back in my day, you didn't have patches.

1725
01:29:00,180 --> 01:29:02,820
You took your games glitchy and you liked it.

1726
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:03,820
Yeah.

1727
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:07,620
And if they were glitchy, they were collector's items.

1728
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:09,020
Exactly.

1729
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:11,500
So here it is, the classic game of the Wii.

1730
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:12,500
Is it a glitchy title?

1731
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:13,500
Not really.

1732
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:14,500
But it's full of bugs, right?

1733
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:15,500
Full of viruses.

1734
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:18,500
Alright, what's the classic game of the Wii?

1735
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:19,500
Dr. Mario.

1736
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:23,700
It's been a while since I've done a puzzle game, I think, so I had to do Dr. Mario.

1737
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:25,940
And stupid me didn't link the YouTube.

1738
01:29:25,940 --> 01:29:26,940
Fail.

1739
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:27,940
It's alright.

1740
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:28,940
Haha.

1741
01:29:28,940 --> 01:29:33,780
We'll play the QT music and I'll bring in the Dr. Mario music when I can.

1742
01:29:33,780 --> 01:29:34,780
Well, Dr. Mario.

1743
01:29:34,780 --> 01:29:35,780
I need a patch.

1744
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:38,060
Dr. Mario came out in 1990.

1745
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:42,740
It was designed by Gunpei Yokoi and it was produced by Takahiro Harada.

1746
01:29:42,740 --> 01:29:47,540
It came out on the Nintendo Entertainment System and it was super fun.

1747
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:51,180
You got to play as Mario who became a doctor.

1748
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:52,180
Plumber to doctor.

1749
01:29:52,180 --> 01:29:53,180
Go fig.

1750
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:59,180
And his point is to eradicate really, really deadly viruses that look like ugly mofos.

1751
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:03,900
One of them looks like a really retarded rabbit, too.

1752
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:08,700
So it's basically a falling block style game, kind of like how Tetris did.

1753
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:14,220
And you line up the colors matching the corresponding colors of the viruses.

1754
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:19,580
And when you stack three of the same color on top of the virus, then it destroys the

1755
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:20,740
virus.

1756
01:30:20,740 --> 01:30:21,860
And you keep going.

1757
01:30:21,860 --> 01:30:23,940
And oh my god, I was good at this game.

1758
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:25,540
I mean, really good at this game.

1759
01:30:25,540 --> 01:30:26,540
I'm not kidding.

1760
01:30:26,540 --> 01:30:31,580
I would, like, you had a max level of 20 that you could select and then you could just keep

1761
01:30:31,580 --> 01:30:32,780
going from there.

1762
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:37,260
And I could go, like, into the, I was really good at it.

1763
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:38,260
Anyway.

1764
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:39,580
And so humble, too.

1765
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:44,380
I'm not gonna, the game's kind of hard not to be good at, you know?

1766
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:47,700
I mean, unless you just have really awful reflexes.

1767
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:53,940
Anyway, there are all kinds of other versions, different ports and things that have come

1768
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:55,460
out, too.

1769
01:30:55,460 --> 01:31:00,580
It was re-released on the Game Boy Advance as part of the classic NES series.

1770
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:07,180
And there were versions of it that was, there's a minigame in WarioWare Inc., Mega Microgames,

1771
01:31:07,180 --> 01:31:11,900
and Brain Age 2, more training and minutes a day.

1772
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:17,460
But let's see what else that we have with this, because you also have, your playfield

1773
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:19,020
is a bottle.

1774
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:21,340
And so he's throwing it into a bottle.

1775
01:31:21,340 --> 01:31:23,780
And you've got as much space as your bottle allows.

1776
01:31:23,780 --> 01:31:29,180
And honestly, on screen, it's fairly small, especially man on the 13-inch TV that I played

1777
01:31:29,180 --> 01:31:30,180
on.

1778
01:31:30,180 --> 01:31:32,540
Can't go blind playing that thing.

1779
01:31:32,540 --> 01:31:37,060
So let's hear about some of the people that probably had problems that this game was pushing

1780
01:31:37,060 --> 01:31:39,020
pills to kids.

1781
01:31:39,020 --> 01:31:44,020
Because I'm sure I've heard that story somewhere before.

1782
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:49,460
I know you might not have it in front of you, but I know some fucking old ladies club probably

1783
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:50,460
complained.

1784
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:53,740
And Dr. Mario teaches my kids about drugs!

1785
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:56,060
You see how many drugs old people pop?

1786
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:57,060
Hello?

1787
01:31:57,060 --> 01:32:03,860
Anyway, it also did have a multiplayer mode where two players could compete against each

1788
01:32:03,860 --> 01:32:06,900
other to clean their different fields out.

1789
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:10,340
And basically you just had to get rid of your viruses before they got rid of theirs, but

1790
01:32:10,340 --> 01:32:14,900
it had more capsules fall on the opposing side.

1791
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:18,900
My little sister and I would play that hours on end.

1792
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:23,540
There was, of course, it was done by Yokoi, who was the guy that gave us the Game Boy

1793
01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:26,020
and the Game & Watch.

1794
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:33,660
And Takahiro Harada, who was the producer, was the producer on Metroid.

1795
01:32:33,660 --> 01:32:38,380
And a lot of the music actually that ended up, some of the music that ended up in Super

1796
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:46,020
Smash Bros. Brawl, was the guy that did that actually became one of the presence of Creatures

1797
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:52,020
Inc., which owned a third of the copyright regarding Pokemon, just to show that little

1798
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:53,020
correlation.

1799
01:32:53,020 --> 01:32:56,500
Were you gonna say something?

1800
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:59,800
Gotta eradicate them all.

1801
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:02,100
There were lots of different versions and ports.

1802
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:06,900
There was a Nintendo versus system that brought out versus Dr. Mario.

1803
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:09,100
So there was an arcade version.

1804
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:14,180
And like I said, there was a GBA version in 2004 that was part of the classic NES series.

1805
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:17,100
Or in Japan it was called the Famicom miniseries.

1806
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:22,540
And then there was a version in Puzzle League in 2005, it was Dr. Mario in Puzzle League.

1807
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:31,660
2003 there was the release of a Nintendo GameCube preview disc that had, you could download

1808
01:33:31,660 --> 01:33:33,980
the NES version of Dr. Mario to your Game Boy Advance console.

1809
01:33:33,980 --> 01:33:35,300
That was pretty cool.

1810
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:38,940
You see that little cable deal that came out?

1811
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:43,660
There was an enhanced version that came with Tetris on the Super Nintendo, that was Tetris

1812
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:46,540
and Dr. Mario, that came out on December 30th, 1994.

1813
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:51,420
Why not bring it out before then, you know, Christmas, blah.

1814
01:33:51,420 --> 01:33:59,820
It was also re-released in Japan on March 30th, 1997, and was downloadable for the Satellaview.

1815
01:33:59,820 --> 01:34:02,540
It was called Dr. Mario BS Version.

1816
01:34:02,540 --> 01:34:06,220
Because the Satellaview is the BS Satellaview.

1817
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:08,860
Can I play some music for one of the other versions here?

1818
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:09,860
Sure.

1819
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:22,620
We're going to go to the Mario 64 version here.

1820
01:34:22,620 --> 01:34:25,260
Same song but a little souped up.

1821
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:26,260
Yep.

1822
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:33,620
But yeah, it was also downloadable for the Nintendo Power Cartridges in Super Famicom

1823
01:34:33,620 --> 01:34:35,620
and Game Boy.

1824
01:34:35,620 --> 01:34:42,620
And then it's on the 21st anniversary of its release in 2011, the original Game Boy version

1825
01:34:42,620 --> 01:34:48,820
was made available for the 3DS to download.

1826
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:55,260
Basically parents, this is what you were talking about, they said that there was a parent,

1827
01:34:55,260 --> 01:35:03,260
parents had issues about the inclusion of medicine, and there was a review by Ace that

1828
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:10,700
gave it a 510 out of 1000 points because it said it reeked of plagiarism and that it was

1829
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:13,340
worse than the games it was modeled after.

1830
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:15,180
Which is pretty stupid to me.

1831
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:16,180
What?

1832
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:17,180
I know.

1833
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:20,300
I wonder, you know, I'm going to actually check Ace real quick and see if they still

1834
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:21,300
exist.

1835
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:25,700
Ace Games magazine, nope, they were applied by EMAP.

1836
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:29,060
Oh my god, I remember this magazine now.

1837
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:32,620
The Amiga format and ST titles, oh wow.

1838
01:35:32,620 --> 01:35:35,460
So yeah, anyway, keep going.

1839
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:39,500
There were, it was really just a good game.

1840
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:47,540
A lot of people really loved it, you know, it was very simple graphically but it got,

1841
01:35:47,540 --> 01:35:48,540
it made its point.

1842
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:52,580
It was fun and simple to play and that's the point of the game.

1843
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:56,380
It was enough challenging to keep you playing it because I would play this game for hours,

1844
01:35:56,380 --> 01:35:58,500
I can tell you that.

1845
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:03,020
But yeah, like you said, there were other follow ups.

1846
01:36:03,020 --> 01:36:08,060
There was Dr. Mario 64, like we're listening to right now, that had other game modes too

1847
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:15,260
and other characters including Wario, because at the time Wario Land 3 was out.

1848
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:19,620
And it came out in Japan under the Nintendo Puzzle Collection.

1849
01:36:19,620 --> 01:36:23,780
But Wario wasn't a doctor, he was just a nurse practitioner.

1850
01:36:23,780 --> 01:36:31,740
Dr. Mario Online RX, which I guess for prescription, came out in 2008 on the Wii so you could play

1851
01:36:31,740 --> 01:36:34,580
online versus the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.

1852
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:38,100
So I do want to say to AlphaKananagram in our chatroom at chat.orangeslantreo.com who says

1853
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:42,780
Nintendo release Dr. Mario 3DS online, put it on the Nintendo network.

1854
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:44,380
There is the Wii one.

1855
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:47,940
I mean, granted, you might be specifically wanting a handheld, but there is an online

1856
01:36:47,940 --> 01:36:49,100
version available.

1857
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:53,060
And then there was Dr. Mario Express that came out in 2009 for the DSi.

1858
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:54,500
Not multiplayer.

1859
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:55,500
Boo.

1860
01:36:55,500 --> 01:37:04,900
Dr. Mario is a secret character in Smash Brothers Melee and they actually had an attack based

1861
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:09,220
on it in Brawl and it had the chill music from the game.

1862
01:37:09,220 --> 01:37:14,860
So I mean, there's lots of cool stuff and actually that music was arranged by the guy

1863
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:17,620
that did music for Magical Drop.

1864
01:37:17,620 --> 01:37:23,260
There's all kinds of neat little crossovers there, don't you think?

1865
01:37:23,260 --> 01:37:25,260
So that's it.

1866
01:37:25,260 --> 01:37:26,260
Alright.

1867
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:27,260
Dr. Mario.

1868
01:37:27,260 --> 01:37:30,360
There it is, your classic game of the week, Dr. Mario.

1869
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:35,300
For the NES, really, but available on pretty much every Nintendo system since then.

1870
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:36,300
In one way or another.

1871
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:38,860
Including the Game Boy, I saw one there on YouTube.

1872
01:37:38,860 --> 01:37:41,180
I think I owned it on Game Boy, actually.

1873
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:43,780
I don't think I owned it on NES, I owned it on Game Boy.

1874
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:46,140
I want to play the Satellaview version.

1875
01:37:46,140 --> 01:37:48,140
The BS one?

1876
01:37:48,140 --> 01:37:49,140
No.

1877
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:51,580
The BS, yeah.

1878
01:37:51,580 --> 01:37:58,660
But we've actually got like a Satellaview ROM of the Zelda game.

1879
01:37:58,660 --> 01:38:00,340
It's really good.

1880
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:03,820
So I can imagine what the Dr. Mario one looks like.

1881
01:38:03,820 --> 01:38:04,820
Alright.

1882
01:38:04,820 --> 01:38:08,100
Well, that's going to do it for part A of our show tonight, but we're not done yet,

1883
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:09,100
guys.

1884
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:10,100
We've got plenty more to come.

1885
01:38:10,100 --> 01:38:13,060
We're going to talk about some other things when we get back from a quick break here,

1886
01:38:13,060 --> 01:38:19,420
including some Xbox-related announcements and news, Sony possibly in trouble, according

1887
01:38:19,420 --> 01:38:20,420
to somebody.

1888
01:38:20,420 --> 01:38:21,420
So we'll talk a little bit about that.

1889
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:26,580
And then, of course, your Twitter topics at twitter.com slash O-L-R, and your emails at

1890
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:31,300
mailbag at orangelandtrader.com, and, because it is a show where every gamer has a voice,

1891
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:36,380
there's many ways to contact us, the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on

1893
01:38:40,580 --> 01:38:42,100
after a quick break.

1894
01:38:42,100 --> 01:38:43,100
So stay tuned, guys.

1895
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:50,100
We'll be right back.

1896
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:56,540
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live with episode number 444 on this

1897
01:38:56,540 --> 01:38:58,820
February the 5th of 2012.

1898
01:38:58,820 --> 01:39:03,380
You know, there's this football game going on, and Loki was mentioning that he was watching,

1899
01:39:03,380 --> 01:39:08,760
he's catching up now on the good stuff, the commercials, and he just said, what, the Battleship

1900
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:11,260
movie might not be so bad, from what you're looking at?

1901
01:39:11,260 --> 01:39:15,060
No, it's gonna be terrible, but it's just one of those movies that you don't really,

1902
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:18,500
I mean, come on, it's a movie based on Battle...

1903
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:23,980
In name, pretty much only, and there's ships in it, I mean, that's the only way it's even

1904
01:39:23,980 --> 01:39:24,980
remotely related to the Fortnite.

1905
01:39:24,980 --> 01:39:25,980
Who's in that?

1906
01:39:25,980 --> 01:39:26,980
Liam Neeson?

1907
01:39:26,980 --> 01:39:27,980
Liam Neeson.

1908
01:39:27,980 --> 01:39:28,980
I just really want to...

1909
01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:29,980
He dies, though, unfortunately.

1910
01:39:29,980 --> 01:39:30,980
Way to ruin it!

1911
01:39:30,980 --> 01:39:31,980
Way to ruin it!

1912
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:34,860
He's in the trailer, you can fucking tell that he dies, I mean, come on.

1913
01:39:34,860 --> 01:39:37,660
He better not die, if he doesn't fucking die, then that's great.

1914
01:39:37,660 --> 01:39:43,940
I really want that clip of Liam Neeson that's like, E5!

1915
01:39:43,940 --> 01:39:46,500
You sunk my Battleship!

1916
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:50,660
It just looks ridiculous, it's just like, it could be Transformers 4 or whatever, I

1917
01:39:50,660 --> 01:39:55,180
mean, it's just pretty much, I don't know, I'm down with it, cause I mean, come on, look

1918
01:39:55,180 --> 01:39:59,620
back at like, Independence Day, how fucking cheesy was that movie, I mean, it was so cheesy.

1919
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:01,540
I did see Snakes on a Plane.

1920
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:02,540
Yeah?

1921
01:40:02,540 --> 01:40:06,340
In the theater at Disneyland.

1922
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:08,300
Did they get the motherfucking snakes off the motherfucking plane?

1923
01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:16,060
It was me, Kristen, and Megsy, wearing giant plushy snakes wrapped around us in the movie

1924
01:40:16,060 --> 01:40:17,060
theater.

1925
01:40:17,060 --> 01:40:20,700
You dressed up to go see Snakes on a Plane!

1926
01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:25,420
We got the snakes at the, um, Jungle Trader.

1927
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:29,660
We did something similar, we watched it at our work, they had a movie screening in our

1928
01:40:29,660 --> 01:40:35,340
theater, we had rubber snakes that we were throwing during the movie, that was kind of

1929
01:40:35,340 --> 01:40:36,340
fun.

1930
01:40:36,340 --> 01:40:38,340
But yeah, the Avengers trailer's awesome.

1931
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:43,740
I have had it with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane!

1932
01:40:43,740 --> 01:40:45,540
Everybody strap in!

1933
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:49,140
I'm about to open some fucking windows.

1934
01:40:49,140 --> 01:40:50,140
That was a cool scene.

1935
01:40:50,140 --> 01:40:51,140
I love Samuel L. Jackson.

1936
01:40:51,140 --> 01:40:55,940
I like when the giant snake ate that one dude.

1937
01:40:55,940 --> 01:41:00,860
And I gotta admit though, it would be, I would be all for them making a sequel where it takes

1938
01:41:00,860 --> 01:41:05,860
place on a space shuttle with Samuel L. Jackson and Snakes on a Shuttle.

1939
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:10,900
Well you know that someone tried to do a knockoff called Snakes on a Train.

1940
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:12,700
Yeah, yeah, that's the directed video.

1941
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:22,620
Asylum does fucking transmorphers and shit with like, how can we get in one of these

1942
01:41:22,620 --> 01:41:24,860
movies, dammit?

1943
01:41:24,860 --> 01:41:30,580
Don't they have a need for witty radio trio to be eaten alive by snakes or something?

1944
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:36,820
They make so many stupid movies, and the thing is they do it intentional now.

1945
01:41:36,820 --> 01:41:40,980
I mean, I don't know if they do it intentional as far as like, they buy the properties for

1946
01:41:40,980 --> 01:41:44,780
these, and then they put them on like sci-fi channel, or they purposely make them that

1947
01:41:44,780 --> 01:41:46,280
bad.

1948
01:41:46,280 --> 01:41:51,060
I don't know if, it's hard to tell like, are you doing this on purpose, or do you really

1949
01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:52,060
just suck that much?

1950
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:54,060
You know, that's just, I don't know.

1951
01:41:54,060 --> 01:41:57,860
Alright, well before we get into the rapid fire news tonight, Dark Soccer, you mentioned

1952
01:41:57,860 --> 01:41:59,180
you wanted to plug something real quick.

1953
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:00,740
Yes, I do.

1954
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:07,500
One of our fantabulous listeners, Ikuma JP, made an app for the iPhone, and I want to

1955
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:08,860
share it with everybody.

1956
01:42:08,860 --> 01:42:11,480
It's called My Secret Garden.

1957
01:42:11,480 --> 01:42:17,980
It's really beautiful, and it's free, so go get it.

1958
01:42:17,980 --> 01:42:19,180
Rob says he likes free.

1959
01:42:19,180 --> 01:42:25,980
I didn't give Rob enough time, so, but it's more than gorgeous moving pictures.

1960
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:26,980
It's beautiful.

1961
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:30,060
It has nothing to do with the My Secret Garden, like, book series.

1962
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:32,820
No, that wasn't a series, it was one book by the same-

1963
01:42:32,820 --> 01:42:36,020
Well, there was too many fucking books, or, I'm sorry, there's too many fucking movies

1964
01:42:36,020 --> 01:42:37,620
based on that book.

1965
01:42:37,620 --> 01:42:40,800
There was the same lady that wrote A Little Princess.

1966
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:43,100
The more you know- Hey, I've read them both, I love those books.

1967
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:46,780
But the most beautiful part of that sentence was free, so there you go.

1968
01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:47,780
Alright.

1969
01:42:47,780 --> 01:42:49,740
I read that one of our listeners made it.

1970
01:42:49,740 --> 01:42:51,540
Of course, of course.

1971
01:42:51,540 --> 01:42:55,020
So we demand he gets a top 100 ranking immediately.

1972
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:59,860
Alright, let's move on to some rapid-fire news, Loki.

1973
01:42:59,860 --> 01:43:06,020
Yes, let's talk a little bit about movies, I mean, we were just talking about movies,

1974
01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:10,740
but Ace Attorney, a movie I'm sure a lot of people might be interested in checking out,

1975
01:43:10,740 --> 01:43:14,220
is actually going to be localized for worldwide release.

1976
01:43:14,220 --> 01:43:17,820
I'm sure that's going to be a very limited release, but hey, you'll eventually get it

1977
01:43:17,820 --> 01:43:20,740
on DVD and Blu-Ray soon, you know, so.

1978
01:43:20,740 --> 01:43:29,420
As long as Samuel L. Jackson is in it saying, OBJECTION!

1979
01:43:29,420 --> 01:43:30,420
He should be the judge.

1980
01:43:30,420 --> 01:43:34,380
Get these motherfucking ejections out of my motherfucking courtroom.

1981
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:36,980
Jackson is in the courtroom.

1982
01:43:36,980 --> 01:43:38,460
SUSTAIN MOTHERFUCKER!

1983
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:43,300
You can put him really in anything, you know.

1984
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:45,700
Samuel L. Jackson really could just be in anything.

1985
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:48,940
Stance is sitting on the toilet the movie.

1986
01:43:48,940 --> 01:43:53,900
That'll be the movie we get offered to do.

1987
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:55,580
Alright, sorry.

1988
01:43:55,580 --> 01:44:02,220
So and then they're doing a Humble Bundle for Android, which is kind of unique, mainly

1989
01:44:02,220 --> 01:44:06,780
it's been PC, but now you're going to be able to get a few games.

1990
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:15,420
The new Humble Bundle for Android offers Android versions of Anomaly, Warzone, Earth, Osmose,

1991
01:44:15,420 --> 01:44:22,900
and Edge, with a bonus copy of World of Goo, if you exceed the average payment.

1992
01:44:22,900 --> 01:44:23,900
So that's kind of neat.

1993
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:28,620
That's neat that it's coming to mobile phones, so it'll never happen on Apple, but hey, yay

1994
01:44:28,620 --> 01:44:29,620
for Android.

1995
01:44:29,620 --> 01:44:35,660
And I guess these games are cross-platform, so you get them on Android and Windows and

1996
01:44:35,660 --> 01:44:39,140
OS X and Linux.

1997
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:41,780
So that's pretty nice, I guess.

1998
01:44:41,780 --> 01:44:45,860
The problem is, you know, really with a lot of these bundles, it's like if you bought

1999
01:44:45,860 --> 01:44:50,780
one of these bundles, you probably have most of the games already in there anyway, so it's

2000
01:44:50,780 --> 01:44:56,980
like how many fucking copies of VVVV do I need, or World of Goo, I mean it's just really.

2001
01:44:56,980 --> 01:45:01,940
Last but not least, Vita Games, they did mention a while back that Vita Games were going to

2002
01:45:01,940 --> 01:45:08,340
be cheaper if you did buy them online versus a boxed game, however you may consider still

2003
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:13,260
wanting to buy a boxed game because you're only going to be saving 10%, and that's it.

2004
01:45:13,260 --> 01:45:17,980
They're 10% cheaper on the Playstation Network, they will be day and day, so if it's a game

2005
01:45:17,980 --> 01:45:23,060
that maybe you just don't want to go to the store to get it, then you can do it I guess,

2006
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:26,260
but it's only 10%.

2007
01:45:26,260 --> 01:45:30,340
Like two bucks on some of these games.

2008
01:45:30,340 --> 01:45:34,780
That's really interesting, actually, that whole thing.

2009
01:45:34,780 --> 01:45:39,140
Because that's kind of how they're going to try and combat used games, is by making it

2010
01:45:39,140 --> 01:45:44,380
cheaper to buy a new one that you can never sell back.

2011
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:46,740
It's not much cheaper, it's like a few bucks.

2012
01:45:46,740 --> 01:45:52,980
I mean seriously, you're going to make back the difference if you sell a new copy of a

2013
01:45:52,980 --> 01:45:54,740
game used.

2014
01:45:54,740 --> 01:45:56,740
For some people, that's going to make the difference.

2015
01:45:56,740 --> 01:45:59,260
You know it.

2016
01:45:59,260 --> 01:46:01,940
It's 10% folks, I mean come on.

2017
01:46:01,940 --> 01:46:05,980
Now if you want to play devil's advocate, you can say, no it's not really 10%, it's

2018
01:46:05,980 --> 01:46:11,740
going to be that plus tax, but I don't know if they charge tax on these purchases.

2019
01:46:11,740 --> 01:46:13,260
Might depend on the state still.

2020
01:46:13,260 --> 01:46:21,300
Yeah, so you could potentially save upwards to 20%, but once again, you know, you could

2021
01:46:21,300 --> 01:46:24,300
probably buy it used and it'll be cheaper.

2022
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:28,500
I just don't know if there's a real need for you to jump in and get everything digital.

2023
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:32,140
Yeah, that's the way you want to roll, then fine.

2024
01:46:32,140 --> 01:46:37,940
But 10% is, I was hoping it'd be a little bit more significant, like you know, $5 cheaper

2025
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:38,940
or something like that.

2026
01:46:38,940 --> 01:46:46,100
Like if it's a $25 for a $30 game or something, that might be a little bit more swaying, but

2027
01:46:46,100 --> 01:46:49,100
10%, I don't think a lot of people are going to jump on board.

2028
01:46:49,100 --> 01:46:54,160
I'm sure some people will, because yeah, I'm saving some money, but.

2029
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:58,740
And if you're not one to sell back games, then maybe.

2030
01:46:58,740 --> 01:46:59,740
Alright.

2031
01:46:59,740 --> 01:47:05,500
Well moving on, unfortunately misspellings on box art will not result in any type of

2032
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:06,500
price reduction.

2033
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:08,980
In fact, it might make the price of these go up, I don't know.

2034
01:47:08,980 --> 01:47:12,100
But we talked about this a little bit last week, and that's of course Resident Evil

2035
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:18,260
Revelations, or whatever, because the name on the box is actually spelled wrong.

2036
01:47:18,260 --> 01:47:21,380
We already talked about this a little bit last week, but somebody had said, no Rob,

2037
01:47:21,380 --> 01:47:22,700
that's just the review copies.

2038
01:47:22,700 --> 01:47:26,220
And I was like, are you sure, because I thought that came from the first printing.

2039
01:47:26,220 --> 01:47:30,060
Well, sure enough, it has been spotted out in the wild.

2040
01:47:30,060 --> 01:47:37,380
Resident Evil Revelations is actually out there in the wild, misspelled.

2041
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:39,740
So there you go.

2042
01:47:39,740 --> 01:47:44,620
It's missing the I and the T are backwards there, so that's what's wrong.

2043
01:47:44,620 --> 01:47:49,620
But anyway, yeah, so the box art made it out there, so you know, you might actually, if

2044
01:47:49,620 --> 01:47:50,620
you've already picked up a copy.

2045
01:47:50,620 --> 01:47:55,260
Does that stuff get proofed, I mean, yeah, no, we were talking about this last week.

2046
01:47:55,260 --> 01:48:01,900
But anyway, seeing where that is now, I think the designer had very little to do with that.

2047
01:48:01,900 --> 01:48:07,380
So anyhow, Capcom has stated that the initial shipment was sent to retailers in North America

2048
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:09,140
with a spelling error.

2049
01:48:09,140 --> 01:48:14,420
It's being repackaged and will have the corrected spelling, so you can actually order a new

2050
01:48:14,420 --> 01:48:15,780
like slip cover for it.

2051
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:20,500
This is the exact same thing they did when they put out what Okami with the IGN watermark

2052
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:21,500
on it.

2053
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:22,500
Hilarious!

2054
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:26,400
I have like all of the new ones that I didn't even know in the game.

2055
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:31,300
That's even better, is I have a poster that they've made up the box art that has just

2056
01:48:31,300 --> 01:48:36,180
like, it's like, how'd you miss that, I mean, really?

2057
01:48:36,180 --> 01:48:37,740
Somebody approved that.

2058
01:48:37,740 --> 01:48:43,980
All right, well, if Dance Dance Revolution with Just Yourself isn't enough, and DDR in

2059
01:48:43,980 --> 01:48:48,240
the arcades with two people isn't enough, well, I hope you're still in high school because

2060
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:56,160
DDR Classroom Edition is going to be a PC game that allows 48 dance mats all to be linked

2061
01:48:56,160 --> 01:48:58,700
together so that you can all play DDR.

2062
01:48:58,700 --> 01:48:59,700
That's actually kind of cool.

2063
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:03,500
I'm actually, you know, as a gamer nerd who, you know, has been one ever since like high

2064
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:06,940
school where sometimes I was looked at as like the big ol' nerd for being into games,

2065
01:49:06,940 --> 01:49:12,200
this is pretty rad that DDR really has kind of gotten into a lot of different PE programs,

2066
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:17,680
and so this is out there to try and basically get like an official Dance Dance Revolution

2067
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:23,600
classroom game, I mean, DDR, Konami already supports DDR and PE programs, but this is

2068
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:27,380
now just a whole like, 48 people can all play the same game.

2069
01:49:27,380 --> 01:49:32,760
I'm not sure how that works, like, I don't know if it's like, if the majority of people

2070
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:38,780
get it right, then you get points or whatever, but I think it's just kind of a, you know,

2071
01:49:38,780 --> 01:49:39,780
but that would be-

2072
01:49:39,780 --> 01:49:40,780
Individual scoring, maybe?

2073
01:49:40,780 --> 01:49:41,780
Who knows, who knows?

2074
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:44,840
Yeah, if you fail this, you will get an F in PE.

2075
01:49:44,840 --> 01:49:47,720
The time has come for you to dance for your life, no.

2076
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:48,720
Alright.

2077
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:52,400
Now's the time, let's focus on me dance!

2078
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:57,480
Now I couldn't tell you exactly what songs are going to be in this new DDR game, but

2079
01:49:57,480 --> 01:50:02,200
I bet if it's for schools, it's probably not going to be any songs by one particular musician

2080
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:08,240
who's been showing up in a lot of music games lately, and if recent rumors are to be believed,

2081
01:50:08,240 --> 01:50:17,320
Ubisoft, who has made Just Dance, the Black Eyed Peas experience, the ABBA You Can Dance,

2082
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:22,280
the Michael Jackson experience, guess what's supposed to come out for the Wii and the Wii

2083
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:24,280
U later this year?

2084
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:28,800
The Lady Gaga experience!

2085
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:31,240
You know you're gonna get it!

2086
01:50:31,240 --> 01:50:33,240
Praise Gaga!

2087
01:50:33,240 --> 01:50:35,560
Oh my god.

2088
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:42,480
Step aside, bless her pop divas.

2089
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:49,680
You too can experience Amazon discounting your album to 99 cents, your fifth single

2090
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:55,200
not doing so well with a video that you directed, nobody understands, no I'm kidding, look,

2091
01:50:55,200 --> 01:50:59,480
Lady Gaga experience, there'll be plenty of people that'll pick that up, I may or may

2092
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:00,720
not be one of them.

2093
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:01,720
You will be one of them.

2094
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:03,200
I will totally fucking buy this game.

2095
01:51:03,200 --> 01:51:08,040
I am not even gonna try and lie, as long as it has all the songs I really like, I'll get

2096
01:51:08,040 --> 01:51:09,040
it day one.

2097
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:13,880
Lady Gaga the experience though sounds kind of scary, I gotta say that.

2098
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:17,780
I don't want to experience what Lady Gaga goes through.

2099
01:51:17,780 --> 01:51:22,360
Lady Gaga the experience, all will be revealed.

2100
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:24,640
You will experience.

2101
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:26,640
Is she really a man?

2102
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:30,100
No, that was proven when she showed her twat.

2103
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:31,100
When did she show her twat?

2104
01:51:31,100 --> 01:51:32,100
Telephone.

2105
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:33,880
I don't remember that.

2106
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:40,120
And they, she hopped up on the bars and showed her twat to everybody and it was all squared

2107
01:51:40,120 --> 01:51:41,120
out.

2108
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:42,120
Oh yeah.

2109
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:43,120
Yeah.

2110
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:44,120
I remember that.

2111
01:51:44,120 --> 01:51:46,680
Well, they just have the pixel on her penis.

2112
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:48,060
She likes to make fun of it.

2113
01:51:48,060 --> 01:51:52,600
I mean, and you know, if she had a penis, that thing would be like platinum plated and

2114
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:53,600
candy striped.

2115
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:57,160
Don't give her ideas for a new video.

2116
01:51:57,160 --> 01:52:00,640
I've seen her live twice in concert and both times she's joked about the rumors that she

2117
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:01,640
has a penis.

2118
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:02,960
She thinks it's funny.

2119
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:05,760
So she, she, she, she likes the mystery, I guess.

2120
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:09,600
Anyway, can we please stop talking about Lady Gaga's penis and move on to more rapid fire

2121
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:10,600
news?

2122
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:11,600
Tark Sakura.

2123
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:12,600
I guess.

2124
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:17,400
Well, how about Dance Central 2?

2125
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:22,240
Download content is going to have some fun stuff in it if you like the game.

2126
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:26,200
There is a say, Hey, I love you.

2127
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:33,900
And this, Oh, by the way, this is, um, on, uh, February 14th and Milkshake cause that

2128
01:52:33,900 --> 01:52:38,480
song is still, you know, relative.

2129
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:41,920
It still brings all the boys to the yard all these years later.

2130
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:46,960
And LMFAO featuring Lauren Bennett and Goon Rock's Party Rock Anthem.

2131
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:49,440
That might be kind of cool.

2132
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:55,040
Also on January 31st is Forget You or as the version I like, Fuck You.

2133
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:59,160
I just realized, do you even know what song Party Rock Anthem is?

2134
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:00,160
No.

2135
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:02,080
It's just interesting.

2136
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:08,880
I only know because I have to drive my wife's car and she doesn't have an MP3 player and

2137
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:13,500
we listen to, well, let me put this, but you can listen to any station and it's pretty

2138
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:17,480
much like that's one of the 10 songs that they have in rotation.

2139
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:18,480
Yeah.

2140
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:21,520
My favorite was when Alan and I were in the car the other day and we were listening to

2141
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:24,640
one station and Adele came on and we flipped to another station.

2142
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:26,880
They were in the middle of another Adele song.

2143
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:27,880
Go to a third station.

2144
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:30,600
They're in the middle of the song, the Adele song that the first station started playing.

2145
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:34,480
I'm like, this bitch is everywhere.

2146
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:37,080
God, I cannot.

2147
01:53:37,080 --> 01:53:42,640
Um, also if you bought your copy of Dance Central 2 from Best Buy, you will get a code

2148
01:53:42,640 --> 01:53:45,400
to get Party Rock Anthem early.

2149
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:47,880
Just saying whatever the hell song that is.

2150
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:50,660
That's some delayed DLC bonus right there.

2151
01:53:50,660 --> 01:53:55,960
How about Just Dance 3 DLC because you know that game's relevant too.

2152
01:53:55,960 --> 01:53:58,440
It is technically the number one selling game right now.

2153
01:53:58,440 --> 01:54:05,960
You can get The Power by Snap because people still like that song and you can actually

2154
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:14,320
get a Bollywood, um, kati kalandal, I guess, love letters Y O Y and sweet invaders skin

2155
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:15,320
to skin.

2156
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:20,920
So you can get all those 240 Microsoft points a piece.

2157
01:54:20,920 --> 01:54:26,080
And then last but not least, which I kind of think I need to get this, there's going

2158
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:31,260
to be the Pink Pearl 3DS available on February 10th and I want it the same way I wanted my

2159
01:54:31,260 --> 01:54:35,080
pink GBA in a totally ironic way.

2160
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:37,760
I was hipster before everybody else was.

2161
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:42,800
No, seriously, I wanted the pink one because I thought it was hideous and I liked it and

2162
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:46,480
I think I would want this one too because it's equally hideous and I really want it.

2163
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:48,760
Okay, so tell me if you've ever heard this song before.

2164
01:54:48,760 --> 01:54:49,760
Dark soccer.

2165
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:50,760
You ready?

2166
01:54:50,760 --> 01:55:00,160
Oh, this shit.

2167
01:55:00,160 --> 01:55:02,040
I'm like, she's not the girl in the bubble.

2168
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:04,340
She has to have heard it at some point.

2169
01:55:04,340 --> 01:55:06,600
It's like pretty much avoidable.

2170
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:11,960
You can't, you know, you can't avoid that song to the radio in my car, but you go to

2171
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:12,960
Pinkberry.

2172
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:16,560
Yeah, that's probably, I think where I heard it.

2173
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:22,360
You know what song though I think of all these radio dancing songs where you're all glad

2174
01:55:22,360 --> 01:55:26,560
it's not a video show right now because I shake my ass for dark soccer and I just looked

2175
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:27,960
the other way.

2176
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:31,880
You know what song I actually like and they were playing it like, where was it that they

2177
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:32,880
were playing?

2178
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:36,660
I think they were playing it at big lots or some shit, but they played that I'm sexy and

2179
01:55:36,660 --> 01:55:41,400
I know it song, whatever song that was, I think it's really funny and I want that song.

2180
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:42,960
I don't know who does it, but I'm winning.

2181
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:43,960
That's LMFAO.

2182
01:55:43,960 --> 01:55:44,960
It's the same band.

2183
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:45,960
It is.

2184
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:46,960
Yeah.

2185
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:47,960
Okay.

2186
01:55:47,960 --> 01:55:48,960
Yeah.

2187
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:51,000
I think also did that song that, you know, sign waves that, you know, when a cage, that's

2188
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:57,920
who opened for Kesha when my friend went and she said she was going just to see them and

2189
01:55:57,920 --> 01:55:58,920
not Kesha.

2190
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:00,880
I'm surprised she didn't catch the herbs.

2191
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:05,000
The next day when she came into class, she was still had glitter in her hair.

2192
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,520
It was so funny.

2193
01:56:06,520 --> 01:56:07,520
I think Kesha's hilarious.

2194
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:10,680
Um, so yeah, I used to really hate Kesha.

2195
01:56:10,680 --> 01:56:14,500
But she's really grown on me and a lot of that is probably the influence of some of

2196
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:19,320
my friends, but like now it's kind of like that whole, like, it's like a guilty pleasure

2197
01:56:19,320 --> 01:56:20,320
type of thing.

2198
01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:23,060
Like, you know, some days you just feel a little bit trashy.

2199
01:56:23,060 --> 01:56:25,480
Some days you want a trashy girl.

2200
01:56:25,480 --> 01:56:26,480
She's a hot mess.

2201
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:27,480
She is.

2202
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:28,480
But there was more.

2203
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:29,480
Oh, more.

2204
01:56:29,480 --> 01:56:39,640
I was going to say, um, it comes on February 10th for $169.99 and um, this isn't a bundle.

2205
01:56:39,640 --> 01:56:41,920
Also I'm in the UK.

2206
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:46,240
They will get the same thing on February 10th and the ice white model, which we're not getting

2207
01:56:46,240 --> 01:56:47,880
yet.

2208
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:50,880
Just saying.

2209
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:56,080
Can you imagine if Ubisoft put out Kesha, the experience, I'm sexy and I know it would

2210
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:58,620
just come with a gallon of body glitter.

2211
01:56:58,620 --> 01:57:03,920
I know, God, that would just be, that would make my soul hurt.

2212
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:08,160
I would play it a jar full of gonorrhea and a used tampon.

2213
01:57:08,160 --> 01:57:11,800
I would play it, but I would turn back in the gonorrhea.

2214
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:13,440
You can keep this part.

2215
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:15,800
I like my Kesha, bathe that Kesha.

2216
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:16,800
All right.

2217
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:21,760
Anyhow, moving on, let's get into some other news stories and of course the mailbag is

2218
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:22,760
coming up soon too.

2219
01:57:22,760 --> 01:57:28,320
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and the FUs of the week, Twitter topics, Skypline, all

2220
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:29,320
that fun stuff.

2221
01:57:29,320 --> 01:57:31,920
But first, some more stories, Loki.

2222
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:36,360
So yeah, you know the new Xbox and everyone's like, oh yeah, it's going to be announced

2223
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:37,360
this year.

2224
01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:40,360
Microsoft said, nope.

2225
01:57:40,360 --> 01:57:44,600
Apparently the Xbox 360 cycle is not at all finished.

2226
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:51,600
The proof is that we don't see the logic in cutting the prices here.

2227
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:55,360
And you know, E3 is still premature.

2228
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:59,440
What's certain is that there'll be nothing new in 2012.

2229
01:57:59,440 --> 01:58:03,920
So and of course, you know, they put out another statement saying, no, we're always thinking

2230
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:07,960
about the next and you know, what is next and how we can push the boundaries and blah,

2231
01:58:07,960 --> 01:58:08,960
blah, blah, blah.

2232
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:14,520
So yeah, you know, there will be another Xbox, most likely 2014 or holiday 2013.

2233
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:16,400
We're waiting to see what Nintendo does.

2234
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:19,000
I should have just been there lying because everybody would believe that.

2235
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,000
I honestly think...

2236
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
I was going to tell them that for your ringtone.

2237
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:31,360
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, yeah.

2238
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:32,360
I did it.

2239
01:58:32,360 --> 01:58:33,360
Turned it back on.

2240
01:58:33,360 --> 01:58:41,120
Anyways, you know, it's basically, I mean, their new system is going to be graphically,

2241
01:58:41,120 --> 01:58:44,920
the Wii U is going to be graphically capable of what the 360 is right now.

2242
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:47,920
So I don't really think that they have too much to worry about right now, especially

2243
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:54,920
if that whole tablet thing doesn't end up working out to be like this innovative masterpiece.

2244
01:58:54,920 --> 01:58:55,920
I don't know.

2245
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:56,920
I think that they're fine right now.

2246
01:58:56,920 --> 01:59:01,560
They can, they can wait next year for the component prices to come way down and still

2247
01:59:01,560 --> 01:59:07,960
beef up their, you know, what's inside their box and, you know, put out some great games.

2248
01:59:07,960 --> 01:59:08,960
What's in their box?

2249
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:09,960
Yes.

2250
01:59:09,960 --> 01:59:10,960
It's Kesha.

2251
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:13,320
Um, here's the thing though.

2252
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:15,600
What does Microsoft show at E3 this year then?

2253
01:59:15,600 --> 01:59:17,720
Is it just going to be a repeat of last year's E3?

2254
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:18,960
Halo 4.

2255
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:20,280
Which they showed at last E3.

2256
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:22,000
They showed a teaser.

2257
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:23,000
And then what?

2258
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,960
The Tomb Raider game probably won't be out till this holiday, right?

2259
01:59:25,960 --> 01:59:26,960
That was a game.

2260
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:29,280
Tomb Raider's not coming out until holiday.

2261
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:32,160
There's Bioshock Infinite still holiday this year.

2262
01:59:32,160 --> 01:59:38,720
Maybe Grand Theft Auto 5 holiday, another Call of Duty game.

2263
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:40,760
There's going to be a bunch of new IPs.

2264
01:59:40,760 --> 01:59:45,680
How much of Microsoft's keynote is just going to be rehash of last year's stuff?

2265
01:59:45,680 --> 01:59:47,700
I think they may still have a lot of stuff.

2266
01:59:47,700 --> 01:59:49,520
We haven't heard a whole lot.

2267
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:51,440
Maybe they're keeping a lot of it under wraps.

2268
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:55,600
And I don't think they need to come out with a brand new system yet.

2269
01:59:55,600 --> 02:00:02,760
I don't think they do either, but I'm still waiting for, like, that Killer Connect hardcore

2270
02:00:02,760 --> 02:00:03,760
game.

2271
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:09,920
Like, what, didn't we get a glimpse at one that was supposed to be some, like, uh, Greek

2272
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:10,920
fighting thing?

2273
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:11,920
Yes.

2274
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:13,920
There's still the one, that's the one from Crytek.

2275
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:17,720
Which, you know, that could be a big hit or a big miss.

2276
02:00:17,720 --> 02:00:20,160
It's hard to say.

2277
02:00:20,160 --> 02:00:23,960
There's really, that could be a hot mess when that comes out.

2278
02:00:23,960 --> 02:00:25,880
So we'll see.

2279
02:00:25,880 --> 02:00:27,760
Yeah, there's that one.

2280
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:31,000
I don't remember what it's called, but yeah, it's from Crytek.

2281
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:36,460
I don't know, there's a lot of games coming out this year.

2282
02:00:36,460 --> 02:00:40,240
And there's a lot of new IPs, I can't remember all of them.

2283
02:00:40,240 --> 02:00:42,280
But I'm sure there's going to be some stuff that they'll be able to show.

2284
02:00:42,280 --> 02:00:47,120
And obviously, you know, there's a new...

2285
02:00:47,120 --> 02:00:51,360
They're going to show the new Fable game, which I don't give a shit about at all.

2286
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:57,600
If I'm done with that series, and done with Peter Molyneux, like, I think I need to pay

2287
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:58,960
more attention to what he said.

2288
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:01,840
Oh yeah, there was that whole Fable connect, like, it's not on Rails.

2289
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:02,840
It's not on Rails!

2290
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:03,840
It's on Rails.

2291
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:04,840
Read it on the board, it's not on Rails.

2292
02:01:04,840 --> 02:01:09,240
Listen, listen, listen you fucker, I'm not fucking listening to what fucking Peter Molyneux

2293
02:01:09,240 --> 02:01:10,240
says.

2294
02:01:10,240 --> 02:01:12,400
It's not on Rails, it's fucking on Rails, okay?

2295
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:16,560
It will be on goddamn Rails.

2296
02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:20,240
Because anything he promises you is going to be underwhelming, okay?

2297
02:01:20,240 --> 02:01:23,280
It's just the way it is.

2298
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:25,680
He's a snake oil salesman.

2299
02:01:25,680 --> 02:01:27,040
That's what he is, okay?

2300
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:29,340
He's a fucking snake oil salesman.

2301
02:01:29,340 --> 02:01:33,520
He will promise you the world, and it will be fucking Fable all over again.

2302
02:01:33,520 --> 02:01:34,520
And you know what?

2303
02:01:34,520 --> 02:01:37,640
Whether you're a fan of Fable that much, that might be a good thing.

2304
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:40,280
I mean, maybe you're just looking for Fable.

2305
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:44,840
But it's not going to be this thing that's going to revolutionize Fable.

2306
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:46,960
Nothing will revolutionize Fable.

2307
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:51,000
But maybe Kingdom of Amalur, or whatever that game is called.

2308
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:52,880
Which is basically EA's Fable game.

2309
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:55,520
Yeah, it's Fable with God of War fighting.

2310
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:58,280
I mean, which, that's not a bad combo.

2311
02:01:58,280 --> 02:01:59,280
That doesn't sound bad.

2312
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:00,280
It's not a bad combo.

2313
02:02:00,280 --> 02:02:01,680
I mean, it sounds better than the demo.

2314
02:02:01,680 --> 02:02:05,520
Alright, anyhow, big changes going on at Xbox.

2315
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:10,720
This is actually a pretty big change, and I always say this guy's name wrong, so, Steven

2316
02:02:10,720 --> 02:02:11,720
Toulouse?

2317
02:02:11,720 --> 02:02:13,280
That sounds right.

2318
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:15,960
Is one of the big guys at Xbox.

2319
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:19,400
He is the director of Xbox Live policy and enforcement.

2320
02:02:19,400 --> 02:02:21,880
He's been working at Microsoft for quite a long time.

2321
02:02:21,880 --> 02:02:25,040
I think about 17 years he's been working there.

2322
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:28,120
He is no longer going to be working there in a couple weeks.

2323
02:02:28,120 --> 02:02:33,420
He has resigned, effective on February 16th, for no particular reason.

2324
02:02:33,420 --> 02:02:34,420
It's very interesting.

2325
02:02:34,420 --> 02:02:38,680
He's just said, on the 16th, I'm going to head down to Dallas to visit my family.

2326
02:02:38,680 --> 02:02:40,400
I have no other plans beyond that.

2327
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:42,140
I'm a free agent.

2328
02:02:42,140 --> 02:02:43,140
So he's not really saying...

2329
02:02:43,140 --> 02:02:45,840
Is he a free bitch baby?

2330
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:49,460
He's not really saying he's jumped ship to go somewhere else, like some mega company

2331
02:02:49,460 --> 02:02:52,880
or something like that, or what have you.

2332
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:58,080
Microsoft did come out and basically say that, yes, he's leaving the company.

2333
02:02:58,080 --> 02:02:59,240
Thank you for his service.

2334
02:02:59,240 --> 02:03:00,320
Wish all the best.

2335
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:03,500
We don't have any details to share about a potential successor.

2336
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:07,380
We can assure you that the Xbox Live enforcement squad will continue their work to help ensure

2337
02:03:07,380 --> 02:03:09,880
a safer, more secure experience, da da da da da.

2338
02:03:09,880 --> 02:03:14,980
Now, of course, the conclusion that many people have jumped to regarding this little resignation

2339
02:03:14,980 --> 02:03:18,320
is that, oh, it's because of the hacks.

2340
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:22,120
Something's happening with the hacks and he's stepping out because he knows something ugly

2341
02:03:22,120 --> 02:03:25,800
is going to go down and he doesn't want to go down with it, da da da da da, like all the

2342
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:28,100
tinfoil hat people come out.

2343
02:03:28,100 --> 02:03:32,240
And to some extent, I've been one of the harshest critics of Xbox around here and the way they've

2344
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:34,040
handled that whole mess.

2345
02:03:34,040 --> 02:03:36,600
You mean they handled it?

2346
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:38,600
Well, yeah, exactly.

2347
02:03:38,600 --> 02:03:43,280
Rhythm party is like the first time I've turned on my Xbox in a month.

2348
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:47,960
So, you know, I'm just but I don't think at the end of the day, it really has anything

2349
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:55,080
to do with that because his role was more about keeping the Xbox Live environment a

2350
02:03:55,080 --> 02:03:58,480
safe haven, if you are a family friendly environment.

2351
02:03:58,480 --> 02:03:59,480
You know what I mean?

2352
02:03:59,480 --> 02:04:05,600
It's just basically a safe place, I don't know, whatever you want to call it.

2353
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:09,120
It's just very possible that after it's like the Thor of the ban hammer.

2354
02:04:09,120 --> 02:04:10,680
Well, let's be real.

2355
02:04:10,680 --> 02:04:11,680
I don't know this guy.

2356
02:04:11,680 --> 02:04:12,680
I don't know him personally.

2357
02:04:12,680 --> 02:04:13,680
I don't know.

2358
02:04:13,680 --> 02:04:14,680
I read his blogs.

2359
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:15,680
I don't follow him on Twitter, da da da.

2360
02:04:15,680 --> 02:04:19,880
I've heard he's very accessible, but I have not chosen to access him.

2361
02:04:19,880 --> 02:04:26,520
From what I hear is the thing, though, if you've been working at the same job 17 years,

2362
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:29,560
and so he's got to be what, like almost 40.

2363
02:04:29,560 --> 02:04:34,200
He's probably going through what some might call a midlife crisis.

2364
02:04:34,200 --> 02:04:38,960
And I'm not saying I'm not saying it's necessarily a bad thing to buy a Ferrari and drive.

2365
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:40,680
I'm not saying it's necessarily a bad thing.

2366
02:04:40,680 --> 02:04:44,800
It's probably just that moment a lot of people go through where it's like, is this what I

2367
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:46,200
want to do forever?

2368
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:50,000
And maybe he decided I want to spend more time with family or I want to do something

2369
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,000
else.

2370
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:55,560
And, you know, he, as a director, he's probably built up a little bit of a nest egg and he's

2371
02:04:55,560 --> 02:04:57,480
probably okay to do that.

2372
02:04:57,480 --> 02:05:00,760
So what I'm trying to say is that I really don't think this has anything to do with the

2373
02:05:00,760 --> 02:05:05,080
Xbox hacks and just this guy wants to go have a life.

2374
02:05:05,080 --> 02:05:06,280
Hooray!

2375
02:05:06,280 --> 02:05:09,040
Good for him.

2376
02:05:09,040 --> 02:05:11,360
It's great.

2377
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:16,200
So meanwhile, Xbox really does need to do something about the hacking, but I don't think

2378
02:05:16,200 --> 02:05:19,560
this guy has anything to do with that.

2379
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:20,880
Let's move on, shall we?

2380
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:21,880
Why, yes.

2381
02:05:21,880 --> 02:05:24,440
Oh, some comments from our chat room real quick on this.

2382
02:05:24,440 --> 02:05:27,280
Tiger Claw says he was a co-host for Major Nelson's podcast.

2383
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:32,040
I think I've listened to one episode of Major Nelson's podcast and it was many, many years

2384
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:33,040
ago.

2385
02:05:33,040 --> 02:05:35,440
So sadly, I wouldn't know that.

2386
02:05:35,440 --> 02:05:36,680
But that's interesting to know.

2387
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:39,760
So I guess a lot of the community knows him through that, too.

2388
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:44,160
Break Man says he's leaving Xbox Live because he's tired of Xbox Live kids calling him the

2389
02:05:44,160 --> 02:05:48,080
N-word or questioning his sexuality in vulgar ways on a regular basis.

2390
02:05:48,080 --> 02:05:51,440
Kind of like how everybody gets treated on Xbox Live.

2391
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:56,480
Well, you know, if that hasn't been fixed in the past, how long has Xbox Live been around

2392
02:05:56,480 --> 02:05:57,480
now?

2393
02:05:57,480 --> 02:05:58,480
About nine years?

2394
02:05:58,480 --> 02:05:59,960
I don't think it's going to get fixed anytime soon.

2395
02:05:59,960 --> 02:06:00,960
That's it.

2396
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:02,280
All right.

2397
02:06:02,280 --> 02:06:03,880
Not that it makes it right.

2398
02:06:03,880 --> 02:06:05,440
Just saying.

2399
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:13,840
Maybe the Xbox lube or whatever the next Xbox ends up being called will have extreme anti-homophobe,

2400
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:16,040
anti-racist measures in it.

2401
02:06:16,040 --> 02:06:17,920
But I wouldn't hold my breath.

2402
02:06:17,920 --> 02:06:19,920
Let's get to some emails.

2403
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:20,920
Yay.

2404
02:06:20,920 --> 02:06:24,880
Every week you guys email us at mailbagatorangelaunchrader.com.

2405
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:27,240
We read some of our favorite emails on the air.

2406
02:06:27,240 --> 02:06:30,280
And we stop the music now.

2407
02:06:30,280 --> 02:06:34,360
I got one that says don't judge my grammar, but grammar was misspelled.

2408
02:06:34,360 --> 02:06:38,840
I'm not going to say who it was though, because I'm not going to bring attention to that person.

2409
02:06:38,840 --> 02:06:44,800
So I'm grabbing a random email and here's one that actually has fantastic grammar.

2410
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:50,960
I found this great website where you can play Ness Ness, okay, Genesis is misspelled, etc.

2411
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:52,000
Games on your computer.

2412
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:55,040
I'm writing this because I know Dark Sakura is into old games.

2413
02:06:55,040 --> 02:06:56,040
Keep up the good work.

2414
02:06:56,040 --> 02:07:01,120
And here's another 10 great years of Orange Lounge Radio and that's sincerely CD Thunder.

2415
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:05,920
I just want to point out in 10 more years, we'll be as old or if not older than this

2416
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:10,480
guy who just resigned from Microsoft and we'll probably have a midlife crisis.

2417
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:13,240
I would like to point out that he didn't send the link.

2418
02:07:13,240 --> 02:07:14,240
Really?

2419
02:07:14,240 --> 02:07:16,600
He told you, hey, check out this great website.

2420
02:07:16,600 --> 02:07:20,200
It's called Sincerely Me.

2421
02:07:20,200 --> 02:07:22,320
Okay.

2422
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:23,320
Next email.

2423
02:07:23,320 --> 02:07:29,320
This comes from, oh, nevermind.

2424
02:07:29,320 --> 02:07:32,560
This was actually personally for us, so I'm saving it.

2425
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:34,280
Now I really want to see it.

2426
02:07:34,280 --> 02:07:35,280
It's about mics.

2427
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:36,280
Oh yeah.

2428
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:37,280
Oh yeah.

2429
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:38,280
I remember that.

2430
02:07:38,280 --> 02:07:39,280
Yeah.

2431
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:40,280
Yeah.

2432
02:07:40,280 --> 02:07:41,280
This is what you get for not checking the email box.

2433
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:42,280
So I forgot one week.

2434
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:43,280
Good Lord.

2435
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:44,280
One week my butt.

2436
02:07:44,280 --> 02:07:45,280
Okay.

2437
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:46,280
Squawk!

2438
02:07:46,280 --> 02:07:47,280
Greetings, OLR.

2439
02:07:47,280 --> 02:07:48,280
This is your friendly neighborhood turtle.

2440
02:07:48,280 --> 02:07:52,400
Sky, I know you're probably under an NDA with Diablo three beta.

2441
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:55,960
Without breaking that, can you please speak a little about your thoughts on the game and

2442
02:07:55,960 --> 02:07:59,080
some of the recent changes that they've made in the beta?

2443
02:07:59,080 --> 02:08:00,080
I'm under an NDA.

2444
02:08:00,080 --> 02:08:01,080
I don't know.

2445
02:08:01,080 --> 02:08:04,880
Am I going to love this as much as D2, or is there too much hype at this point?

2446
02:08:04,880 --> 02:08:07,200
I don't think I'm under an NDA.

2447
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:08,520
If I am, oops.

2448
02:08:08,520 --> 02:08:10,040
There's so much information out there.

2449
02:08:10,040 --> 02:08:12,320
No, there's like stuff on YouTube, people playing through it.

2450
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:13,880
It can't be under NDA.

2451
02:08:13,880 --> 02:08:17,480
I'm not going to say anything that, I'll tell you what, the last time I played through it

2452
02:08:17,480 --> 02:08:19,240
was in November.

2453
02:08:19,240 --> 02:08:23,340
I probably gave it a more extensive review on one of the shows back then.

2454
02:08:23,340 --> 02:08:24,340
But I enjoyed it.

2455
02:08:24,340 --> 02:08:26,800
You know, I enjoyed the older Diablo games.

2456
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:30,200
Some people call it, oh, it's just a click fest, click, click, click.

2457
02:08:30,200 --> 02:08:31,640
But no, I thought it was fun.

2458
02:08:31,640 --> 02:08:37,600
I had a lot of fun, like Shane, who has sometimes been known as Mikolatov on the show, and he

2459
02:08:37,600 --> 02:08:38,600
was in the beta too.

2460
02:08:38,600 --> 02:08:41,760
And we did some co-op online and we had a lot of fun just kind of playing it together

2461
02:08:41,760 --> 02:08:43,840
and exploring the dungeons.

2462
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:46,980
It's very similar to what you remember in Diablo two.

2463
02:08:46,980 --> 02:08:49,040
There's a few quality of life improvements.

2464
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:52,440
Like I seem to remember, oh God, it's been a few months since I played it now, but I

2465
02:08:52,440 --> 02:08:57,020
seem to remember that, like, you don't have to carry around a bunch of town portal scrolls

2466
02:08:57,020 --> 02:09:00,480
because like there's an item in your inventory that lets you just make one, you know, just

2467
02:09:00,480 --> 02:09:04,280
kind of like little things like that that help it, you know, feel.

2468
02:09:04,280 --> 02:09:06,320
You said quality of life improvements.

2469
02:09:06,320 --> 02:09:08,000
Does it make you sexy and you know it?

2470
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,940
Yes, it does actually.

2471
02:09:09,940 --> 02:09:11,360
And some of the classes were really fun to play.

2472
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:14,960
I really enjoyed Monk, but there was another one I played I didn't like as much.

2473
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:16,320
I think it was the Witch Doctor.

2474
02:09:16,320 --> 02:09:17,320
That was the Chipmunk.

2475
02:09:17,320 --> 02:09:18,320
No, the Witch Doctor.

2476
02:09:18,320 --> 02:09:20,160
I didn't like as much, but I liked the Monk.

2477
02:09:20,160 --> 02:09:21,160
Okay.

2478
02:09:21,160 --> 02:09:24,320
If you're able to continue with the email, any tidbit of info would be appreciated.

2479
02:09:24,320 --> 02:09:25,320
Thanks.

2480
02:09:25,320 --> 02:09:27,480
Your loyal turtle and fairly serious turtle.

2481
02:09:27,480 --> 02:09:28,480
P.S.

2482
02:09:28,480 --> 02:09:31,200
I heard that Loki secretly works for Nintendo.

2483
02:09:31,200 --> 02:09:32,200
Boom.

2484
02:09:32,200 --> 02:09:34,480
I secretly work for Nintendo.

2485
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:35,480
Boom.

2486
02:09:35,480 --> 02:09:36,480
Boom.

2487
02:09:36,480 --> 02:09:37,480
Boom.

2488
02:09:37,480 --> 02:09:38,480
Blocks.

2489
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:39,480
I wish.

2490
02:09:39,480 --> 02:09:42,880
I honestly wish I did because, you know, I'd be getting a lot more money.

2491
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:47,000
If you saw Reggie knew how to kick ass and take names, Loki would be in there just, he

2492
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,840
would just, he'd flip a table the first day.

2493
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:50,840
Okay.

2494
02:09:50,840 --> 02:09:51,840
I wish.

2495
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:53,560
Loki, would you flip a table if you worked for Nintendo?

2496
02:09:53,560 --> 02:09:54,560
Fuck that.

2497
02:09:54,560 --> 02:09:55,560
I'd want to stay employed.

2498
02:09:55,560 --> 02:09:56,560
Okay.

2499
02:09:56,560 --> 02:09:57,560
So, email.

2500
02:09:57,560 --> 02:09:58,560
Last email.

2501
02:09:58,560 --> 02:09:59,560
Yes.

2502
02:09:59,560 --> 02:10:00,560
Dear OLR.

2503
02:10:00,560 --> 02:10:01,560
Okay.

2504
02:10:01,560 --> 02:10:04,680
Recently I purchased a copy of the Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Game of the Year edition.

2505
02:10:04,680 --> 02:10:07,800
Now I'm enjoying it for the most part with the exception of one thing.

2506
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:13,280
The Game of the Year edition has a glitch in which when you're a vampire and you seek,

2507
02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:16,840
and you receive a quest to cure yourself.

2508
02:10:16,840 --> 02:10:18,720
Now granted, I like being a vampire.

2509
02:10:18,720 --> 02:10:22,120
I was strong, fast, didn't sparkle, but it made my character weak to fire and sunlight

2510
02:10:22,120 --> 02:10:23,720
turns me into a crispy critter.

2511
02:10:23,720 --> 02:10:25,840
I'm glad I'm not the only one that uses that term.

2512
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:26,840
Now-

2513
02:10:26,840 --> 02:10:27,840
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2514
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:32,080
You mean an Elder Scrolls game is glitchy?

2515
02:10:32,080 --> 02:10:35,440
Now on that quest you talk to a witch and after running errands for her, she sends you

2516
02:10:35,440 --> 02:10:39,200
out for ingredients for the potion to cure yourself permanently, but one of the ingredients

2517
02:10:39,200 --> 02:10:42,360
will not be accepted now they patched this out of the original game.

2518
02:10:42,360 --> 02:10:47,600
But when they booted out the Knights of the Nine DLC, the glitch re-arose and there's

2519
02:10:47,600 --> 02:10:49,880
no way around that with Game of the Year.

2520
02:10:49,880 --> 02:10:53,920
Now on another note, I've been playing a Japanese PSP demo for Final Fantasy Type O.

2521
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:55,320
I wanna play that!

2522
02:10:55,320 --> 02:10:59,440
I'm wondering if this will ever come into America and how it ties in with the, uh, Fabula

2523
02:10:59,440 --> 02:11:01,200
Nova Crystallis.

2524
02:11:01,200 --> 02:11:03,840
Thank you for reading my email signed Haseo Sumiragawa.

2525
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:07,120
I don't believe it is part of the Fabu-

2526
02:11:07,120 --> 02:11:08,920
It was supposed to be Akido.

2527
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:12,600
It was originally gonna be the mobile phone one, right, but they just totally changed

2528
02:11:12,600 --> 02:11:13,600
it.

2529
02:11:13,600 --> 02:11:14,600
Now it's the PSP one.

2530
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:15,600
This is supposed to be the Akido 13.

2531
02:11:15,600 --> 02:11:16,600
Yeah.

2532
02:11:16,600 --> 02:11:18,240
I, I wanna play it.

2533
02:11:18,240 --> 02:11:19,720
I really wanna play it.

2534
02:11:19,720 --> 02:11:24,120
It's probably gonna, like, kinda feel like the same universe as 13, but it won't be like

2535
02:11:24,120 --> 02:11:25,120
any of the same characters.

2536
02:11:25,120 --> 02:11:29,600
It'll be like Versus, cause Final Fantasy Versus 13 doesn't look like it has shit in

2537
02:11:29,600 --> 02:11:35,120
common with Final Fantasy 13, except I'm assuming it takes place on Cocoon.

2538
02:11:35,120 --> 02:11:36,120
No characters?

2539
02:11:36,120 --> 02:11:37,120
No.

2540
02:11:37,120 --> 02:11:38,120
It's all different people?

2541
02:11:38,120 --> 02:11:39,120
No.

2542
02:11:39,120 --> 02:11:40,120
I don't even think it takes place on Cocoon.

2543
02:11:40,120 --> 02:11:41,120
Yeah, so I don't know what the hell-

2544
02:11:41,120 --> 02:11:42,640
I wanna play it when you're done.

2545
02:11:42,640 --> 02:11:43,640
What?

2546
02:11:43,640 --> 02:11:44,640
I don't have Versus.

2547
02:11:44,640 --> 02:11:45,640
I have 13 too.

2548
02:11:45,640 --> 02:11:49,080
Oh, yeah, you can- if I get it back in less than a year this time-

2549
02:11:49,080 --> 02:11:55,280
Honestly, 13 Versus, it has, like, nothing to do with anything.

2550
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:57,600
13 Versus looks good, though.

2551
02:11:57,600 --> 02:11:58,600
Yeah.

2552
02:11:58,600 --> 02:11:59,600
It looks really good, I gotta say.

2553
02:11:59,600 --> 02:12:00,600
Hey!

2554
02:12:00,600 --> 02:12:03,160
We got an email from PlayStation Network.

2555
02:12:03,160 --> 02:12:04,400
It's probably a hack email, or official email.

2556
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:07,640
It's not a hack email, it's that they're changing the PlayStation Network-

2557
02:12:07,640 --> 02:12:13,120
Info at PlayStation.messages4.com, yeah, that's, that's a-

2558
02:12:13,120 --> 02:12:15,120
I did get one for the PlayStation Network, it's basically-

2559
02:12:15,120 --> 02:12:20,520
Yeah, they're merging PlayStation Network into the Sony Entertainment Network, or whatever.

2560
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:23,240
The Sony Entertainment Network of You Can't Sue Us.

2561
02:12:23,240 --> 02:12:24,240
Yeah.

2562
02:12:24,240 --> 02:12:25,240
Watch us.

2563
02:12:25,240 --> 02:12:30,600
I mean, hey, if they give us no reason for legal action, we're not gonna say anything.

2564
02:12:30,600 --> 02:12:35,400
For the record, I have not updated my system, so therefore I have not accepted the end user

2565
02:12:35,400 --> 02:12:36,720
license agreement yet.

2566
02:12:36,720 --> 02:12:37,720
Ho ho ho.

2567
02:12:37,720 --> 02:12:41,240
I will still sue you if I feel like it.

2568
02:12:41,240 --> 02:12:42,240
If you feel like it.

2569
02:12:42,240 --> 02:12:46,440
This is my Southern lawyer, he was suing me.

2570
02:12:46,440 --> 02:12:47,440
What?

2571
02:12:47,440 --> 02:12:49,800
Okay, can we...visit?

2572
02:12:49,800 --> 02:12:50,960
That's it?

2573
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:51,960
You're done?

2574
02:12:51,960 --> 02:12:52,960
No more emails.

2575
02:12:52,960 --> 02:12:53,960
I'm done, where's the fork?

2576
02:12:53,960 --> 02:12:56,400
All right, let's go to the FUs of the week.

2577
02:12:56,400 --> 02:12:58,840
Every week on this show we like to get angsty.

2578
02:12:58,840 --> 02:12:59,840
Why?

2579
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:18,520
Because we can.

2580
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:27,680
F-U to, um- God, you know, I had it in my head and I forgot what it was, it was somebody-

2581
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:34,040
Oh yeah, the girl outside of Whole Foods today who was trying to get me to sign her petition.

2582
02:13:34,040 --> 02:13:38,120
I normally don't have a problem with that, I'm all for political action, but I don't

2583
02:13:38,120 --> 02:13:42,680
sign those petitions from people that are just standing outside the door because there's

2584
02:13:42,680 --> 02:13:47,200
been a lot of issue lately with people trying to get your information and using it against

2585
02:13:47,200 --> 02:13:48,200
you.

2586
02:13:48,200 --> 02:13:51,880
And I don't really have- I thought she was legit, I mean, I'm not gonna make a judgment

2587
02:13:51,880 --> 02:13:52,880
on her.

2588
02:13:52,880 --> 02:13:56,920
But, um, she's like, do you have- hey, how you doing, do you have time for this?

2589
02:13:56,920 --> 02:14:01,000
Like, I'm sorry, I'm really big in a hurry, she's like, oh, well, are you late for the

2590
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:02,000
game?

2591
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:05,880
Like, don't start a conversation with me when I tell you I am in a hurry.

2592
02:14:05,880 --> 02:14:08,560
I hate football.

2593
02:14:08,560 --> 02:14:11,920
Don't stop me with foot- I mean, she didn't know that, but I was like, I was like, if

2594
02:14:11,920 --> 02:14:17,400
I say I'm in a hurry, the correct response will be, oh, I'm sorry, bye, bye.

2595
02:14:17,400 --> 02:14:19,720
Not trying to start a conversation with me.

2596
02:14:19,720 --> 02:14:21,440
I'm still not gonna sign your shit.

2597
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:24,000
Look at our website when you have a chance.

2598
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:29,800
Yeah, I would sign it through the website- if I had credentials, you know, but that and

2599
02:14:29,800 --> 02:14:34,840
how much my feet hurt yesterday, oh my god, okay, but I had a really good time at museums

2600
02:14:34,840 --> 02:14:35,840
with Becky.

2601
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:36,840
Lots of fun.

2602
02:14:36,840 --> 02:14:37,840
Were they really crowded?

2603
02:14:37,840 --> 02:14:42,440
I haven't heard a lot of people- We went to the Children's Discovery Museum

2604
02:14:42,440 --> 02:14:44,720
with Julian in the morning and it was- We thought about going to that, we're really

2605
02:14:44,720 --> 02:14:45,720
sure.

2606
02:14:45,720 --> 02:14:47,600
Don't do it on the freebie day.

2607
02:14:47,600 --> 02:14:48,600
Just get a membership.

2608
02:14:48,600 --> 02:14:49,600
It's so much easier.

2609
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:55,160
But, I mean, he had a good time, but it was really crowded and then, but when we went

2610
02:14:55,160 --> 02:15:02,400
to the Crocker, we got there right around like, I want to say one something and it was

2611
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:07,960
busy, yeah, but it wasn't prohibitively busy, if you know what I mean.

2612
02:15:07,960 --> 02:15:12,840
We actually still got up close to several of the paintings that they had on display.

2613
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:19,560
There was a display of Italian Baroque art, it was really nice, but yeah, but my feet

2614
02:15:19,560 --> 02:15:26,680
hurt after, you know, walking from J Street to the Crocker, walking around the Crocker

2615
02:15:26,680 --> 02:15:31,000
and walking back and then I had to pee, so, alright, that was it.

2616
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:36,960
And you know what they say, and I'm sure they've stolen this from somebody, if it ain't Baroque,

2617
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:37,960
then don't fix it.

2618
02:15:37,960 --> 02:15:38,960
I've heard that before.

2619
02:15:38,960 --> 02:15:39,960
I don't remember that story.

2620
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:42,160
If it ain't Baroque, it's probably Renaissance.

2621
02:15:42,160 --> 02:15:44,160
It was from Beauty and the Beast.

2622
02:15:44,160 --> 02:15:45,800
Yeah, it was Lumiere.

2623
02:15:45,800 --> 02:15:48,680
Lumiere says, no, Cogsworth says it.

2624
02:15:48,680 --> 02:15:52,360
Cogsworth said it, and Becky even quoted that when we were at the thing with the Baroque

2625
02:15:52,360 --> 02:15:53,360
art.

2626
02:15:53,360 --> 02:15:54,360
You just quoted Beauty and the Beast, Loki.

2627
02:15:54,360 --> 02:15:55,360
Yeah, whatever.

2628
02:15:55,360 --> 02:15:59,160
It's not Baroque, don't fix it.

2629
02:15:59,160 --> 02:16:05,920
Let's be real though, if this program were made up of dancing, you know, housewares,

2630
02:16:05,920 --> 02:16:10,240
Loki would be in the scene as well.

2631
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:17,400
I don't want to be Mrs. Potts, or the cupboard, the wardrobe.

2632
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:18,400
Clearly I'm Lumiere.

2633
02:16:18,400 --> 02:16:19,400
Alright, moving on.

2634
02:16:19,400 --> 02:16:21,400
Because you're so French, Rob.

2635
02:16:21,400 --> 02:16:24,080
I'm on fire.

2636
02:16:24,080 --> 02:16:28,500
This is, I don't even know if this is really an F.U., but I guess it is.

2637
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:33,520
I'm just very sick and tired of the whole argument that used games steal away from developers.

2638
02:16:33,520 --> 02:16:38,440
Okay, let me fucking, I mean, come on, developers, you should know how this fucking works.

2639
02:16:38,440 --> 02:16:39,560
You make a game.

2640
02:16:39,560 --> 02:16:41,440
The game gets pressed.

2641
02:16:41,440 --> 02:16:45,920
The publisher sells the game to the retailer.

2642
02:16:45,920 --> 02:16:48,240
Therefore there is money being exchanged there.

2643
02:16:48,240 --> 02:16:52,540
It is up to the retailer to then sell the game so that they're not out the money that

2644
02:16:52,540 --> 02:16:56,840
they paid for the game, and they make a small profit on top of that.

2645
02:16:56,840 --> 02:17:03,800
Then maybe, as an incentive, you may get, you know, some extra money depending on how

2646
02:17:03,800 --> 02:17:05,900
well the game sells.

2647
02:17:05,900 --> 02:17:11,680
That is the only money that is getting eaten up by used game sales, and it's a very small

2648
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:17,100
fraction of that that you're even, you know, losing out on.

2649
02:17:17,100 --> 02:17:21,080
And the great part is the person that was bitching about this in particular happened

2650
02:17:21,080 --> 02:17:23,520
to be Ian Milham.

2651
02:17:23,520 --> 02:17:28,320
Ian Milham is the creative director at Electronic Arts, art director on Dead Space.

2652
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:33,240
Yes, you of all people should really bitch about how your game is just tanked because

2653
02:17:33,240 --> 02:17:34,400
of used game sales.

2654
02:17:34,400 --> 02:17:37,440
Oh wait, how many millions of copies did it sell?

2655
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:42,080
Yeah, so you can shut the fuck up because you still made your fucking money and used

2656
02:17:42,080 --> 02:17:45,360
games didn't do shit for you guys.

2657
02:17:45,360 --> 02:17:49,280
I'm sorry, it's just a stupid argument, and I always tell people, we're the stupid money

2658
02:17:49,280 --> 02:17:52,640
from the developers if we buy used games.

2659
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:53,640
No!

2660
02:17:53,640 --> 02:17:57,240
It does not fucking steal any money from anybody because those games are already goddamn paid

2661
02:17:57,240 --> 02:17:58,240
for.

2662
02:17:58,240 --> 02:18:02,560
If they all sat on shelves, they don't fucking care, they have their money already.

2663
02:18:02,560 --> 02:18:05,280
That's the whole point.

2664
02:18:05,280 --> 02:18:06,280
That's it.

2665
02:18:06,280 --> 02:18:09,960
Alright, well shit, how am I supposed to follow that?

2666
02:18:09,960 --> 02:18:10,960
Um, F-U-

2667
02:18:10,960 --> 02:18:11,960
It's pudding.

2668
02:18:11,960 --> 02:18:12,960
I want pudding.

2669
02:18:12,960 --> 02:18:16,560
Um, F-U to a lot of the same stuff that was bothering me last week, but I want to say

2670
02:18:16,560 --> 02:18:19,720
thank you to the person who reached out to me on Twitter to talk about that.

2671
02:18:19,720 --> 02:18:22,920
I thought that was very nice, you know who you are.

2672
02:18:22,920 --> 02:18:27,640
And I want to say F-U to the fact that, oh my god, I went to California Pizza Kitchen

2673
02:18:27,640 --> 02:18:31,440
last night, and granted there was a rather large party of us, but it took an hour and

2674
02:18:31,440 --> 02:18:35,380
fifteen minutes to get a table when we were quoted thirty, and then even then they sat

2675
02:18:35,380 --> 02:18:37,400
us at two separate tables.

2676
02:18:37,400 --> 02:18:40,880
And we watched another party right after us get sat at the big long table where there

2677
02:18:40,880 --> 02:18:43,000
was usually like twelve to thirteen of them.

2678
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:46,040
And so I was discriminated against, I'm convinced that's what it was.

2679
02:18:46,040 --> 02:18:48,280
You should have called the manager.

2680
02:18:48,280 --> 02:18:49,280
Uh, my friend did.

2681
02:18:49,280 --> 02:18:51,520
You should have just gone to California Pizza Kitchen, I mean.

2682
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:56,920
I know, but here's the weird thing, F-U to myself, because we went to California Pizza

2683
02:18:56,920 --> 02:18:59,840
Kitchen, and I ordered a salad.

2684
02:18:59,840 --> 02:19:01,160
Actually Becky orders a salad.

2685
02:19:01,160 --> 02:19:04,240
That's why they discriminated against you right there.

2686
02:19:04,240 --> 02:19:05,480
These salads are really good.

2687
02:19:05,480 --> 02:19:09,880
Yeah, they have a whole page dedicated to salads, and they have really good salads.

2688
02:19:09,880 --> 02:19:12,980
Like you wouldn't know it, but- Yeah I would know it.

2689
02:19:12,980 --> 02:19:15,640
It's not California Salad Kitchen, but it could be.

2690
02:19:15,640 --> 02:19:17,320
You know what's funny?

2691
02:19:17,320 --> 02:19:18,320
What?

2692
02:19:18,320 --> 02:19:21,480
Julian calls his bedroom his pizza kitchen.

2693
02:19:21,480 --> 02:19:27,440
Listen, we know your type of fresh choice is down the street, get the fuck out of here.

2694
02:19:27,440 --> 02:19:28,440
That's where I had lunch yesterday.

2695
02:19:28,440 --> 02:19:32,300
You fags are gonna come in here and order salad?

2696
02:19:32,300 --> 02:19:33,300
That's exactly what happened.

2697
02:19:33,300 --> 02:19:34,480
You know what that makes me think of?

2698
02:19:34,480 --> 02:19:35,480
What?

2699
02:19:35,480 --> 02:19:41,080
I ordered a brack, and she ordered something called a salad.

2700
02:19:41,080 --> 02:19:42,640
That to me is love.

2701
02:19:42,640 --> 02:19:49,800
The salt on the wound was watching all these high school kids coming in there all dressed

2702
02:19:49,800 --> 02:19:51,800
up like it's fucking prom or something.

2703
02:19:51,800 --> 02:19:54,120
Is it prom season?

2704
02:19:54,120 --> 02:19:55,120
Maybe hell.

2705
02:19:55,120 --> 02:19:56,120
Winter ball.

2706
02:19:56,120 --> 02:19:57,120
Wait, no.

2707
02:19:57,120 --> 02:19:58,600
Have things been cut back so much that they're gonna graduate next month?

2708
02:19:58,600 --> 02:20:01,120
Winter ball, I guess, because- We never had that shit.

2709
02:20:01,120 --> 02:20:04,560
I don't know, but there was a hell of people all dressed up, and all these kids, and their

2710
02:20:04,560 --> 02:20:09,280
fancy pants dresses, because California Pizza Kitchen's the nice part of town where all

2711
02:20:09,280 --> 02:20:11,280
the rich, spoiled kids live.

2712
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:12,280
What, Arden?

2713
02:20:12,280 --> 02:20:13,280
No.

2714
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:14,280
You went to the other one?

2715
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:18,200
We went to the one where Dave and Buster's is, the Fountains.

2716
02:20:18,200 --> 02:20:19,200
See what I mean?

2717
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:20,200
Go to Arden.

2718
02:20:20,200 --> 02:20:22,560
That's why- Don't give a shit at Arden.

2719
02:20:22,560 --> 02:20:27,600
Go hang out with the poor people like me at Arden.

2720
02:20:27,600 --> 02:20:28,600
Arden don't give a shit.

2721
02:20:28,600 --> 02:20:29,600
You know what?

2722
02:20:29,600 --> 02:20:34,360
If I'm gonna go over there, I'm just gonna go to Mikuni anyway, or Dave and Buster's.

2723
02:20:34,360 --> 02:20:35,360
Like the one or two.

2724
02:20:35,360 --> 02:20:36,360
We had a party in nine, though.

2725
02:20:36,360 --> 02:20:38,680
It's hard to find something everybody likes.

2726
02:20:38,680 --> 02:20:39,680
Yeah.

2727
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:41,120
All right, so we went to California Salad Kitchen.

2728
02:20:41,120 --> 02:20:43,800
We went to Dave and Buster's.

2729
02:20:43,800 --> 02:20:44,800
You know what?

2730
02:20:44,800 --> 02:20:46,800
I suggested Dave and Buster's, but I got shot down.

2731
02:20:46,800 --> 02:20:49,000
They didn't want to do that.

2732
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Let's be real, though.

2733
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,520
The food at Dave and Buster's is kind of mediocre.

2734
02:20:52,520 --> 02:20:55,720
And the night before Super Bowl Sunday, we were kind of afraid it was gonna be a mess.

2735
02:20:55,720 --> 02:20:59,160
Of course, we didn't fare much better at California Pizza Kitchen.

2736
02:20:59,160 --> 02:21:03,140
But anyway, could we please not turn this into a California Pizza Kitchen show and talk

2737
02:21:03,140 --> 02:21:05,760
about more news, Loki?

2738
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:14,160
So you know, not to be out done, I guess, in Monkey See Monkey Do or whatever.

2739
02:21:14,160 --> 02:21:20,760
You know, Sony's pulling another move with the Wii U type controllers.

2740
02:21:20,760 --> 02:21:28,120
Sony has patented their own Wii U-esque device, and it looks like a tablet.

2741
02:21:28,120 --> 02:21:30,540
What more is there to say?

2742
02:21:30,540 --> 02:21:31,540
Tablet with buttons on it.

2743
02:21:31,540 --> 02:21:36,960
Actually, it looks like kind of a cross between a Game Boy and an iPod, and that looks really

2744
02:21:36,960 --> 02:21:37,960
weird.

2745
02:21:37,960 --> 02:21:44,320
It shows some augmented reality thing where this guy looks like his character through

2746
02:21:44,320 --> 02:21:45,320
the tablet.

2747
02:21:45,320 --> 02:21:46,320
That thing looks bizarre.

2748
02:21:46,320 --> 02:21:47,320
Why do they need to do that?

2749
02:21:47,320 --> 02:21:51,480
Didn't they just say, like, two weeks ago that the PlayStation Vita was capable of everything

2750
02:21:51,480 --> 02:21:54,640
that they're saying the whole Wii U will do?

2751
02:21:54,640 --> 02:21:55,640
I don't know.

2752
02:21:55,640 --> 02:21:56,640
It looks weird.

2753
02:21:56,640 --> 02:22:00,560
It looks like it's gonna support multiple tablets, and that it'll almost be some sort

2754
02:22:00,560 --> 02:22:04,720
of augmented reality thing.

2755
02:22:04,720 --> 02:22:13,160
It basically is titled the very generic position-dependent gaming 3D controller and handheld as remote.

2756
02:22:13,160 --> 02:22:19,200
Device would track its own location as input into video game and would render an avatar

2757
02:22:19,200 --> 02:22:29,800
on a mobile device such that it appears to overlay a competing user in the real world.

2758
02:22:29,800 --> 02:22:32,800
I don't know.

2759
02:22:32,800 --> 02:22:37,120
Maybe it's something that they're gonna implement into one of their tablets?

2760
02:22:37,120 --> 02:22:40,640
Maybe it'll be a cheaper option as opposed to getting a Vita, but then, like, why would

2761
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:45,520
you kind of bite the, you know, take away from one to give to the other?

2762
02:22:45,520 --> 02:22:48,120
Like, it just seems a little weird.

2763
02:22:48,120 --> 02:22:49,280
I don't know.

2764
02:22:49,280 --> 02:22:53,920
I do like how the fact that they're a little generic console that they use on there looks

2765
02:22:53,920 --> 02:22:57,820
like the same console that they have rendered in Grand Theft Auto.

2766
02:22:57,820 --> 02:23:01,640
Their, like, generic Xbox PS3 console.

2767
02:23:01,640 --> 02:23:02,640
It's kind of funny.

2768
02:23:02,640 --> 02:23:03,640
All right.

2769
02:23:03,640 --> 02:23:08,600
Well, let's move on and talk about, speaking of the Vita and all that, this is seriously

2770
02:23:08,600 --> 02:23:13,160
the game that might convince me to get a Vita when the Vita's out, which is what, like,

2771
02:23:13,160 --> 02:23:14,600
next week or two weeks, I think?

2772
02:23:14,600 --> 02:23:16,520
The early release is next week, right?

2773
02:23:16,520 --> 02:23:18,020
Yeah, Valentine's Day.

2774
02:23:18,020 --> 02:23:19,020
Two weeks.

2775
02:23:19,020 --> 02:23:20,020
Oh, no.

2776
02:23:20,020 --> 02:23:21,020
They have their Valentine's Day.

2777
02:23:21,020 --> 02:23:23,920
So we're not that far away from the Vita launch over here, and I gotta say, this is the game

2778
02:23:23,920 --> 02:23:27,400
that makes me kind of sorry.

2779
02:23:27,400 --> 02:23:31,520
I get so distracted because there's this giant Gotham City Impostors ad on the page, and

2780
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:33,840
it just makes me think about how this really disturbs Jamie.

2781
02:23:33,840 --> 02:23:38,120
Like, she really doesn't like what this game is doing, even though she's never played it.

2782
02:23:38,120 --> 02:23:39,760
I just don't like the concept.

2783
02:23:39,760 --> 02:23:40,760
I know, I know.

2784
02:23:40,760 --> 02:23:41,760
It'll be fun to me.

2785
02:23:41,760 --> 02:23:44,560
I downloaded the beta, but I just haven't run it yet.

2786
02:23:44,560 --> 02:23:47,640
Anyway, the game of the Vita.

2787
02:23:47,640 --> 02:23:50,520
Luminous Electronic Symphony.

2788
02:23:50,520 --> 02:23:51,520
Yay!

2789
02:23:51,520 --> 02:23:55,020
I gotta say, the song list looks damn impressive.

2790
02:23:55,020 --> 02:24:01,060
There is 34 tracks in it, and a lot of it is really good licensed stuff.

2791
02:24:01,060 --> 02:24:07,840
There's stuff from Cascade, 4AM is in here, Bang Bang Bang, Mark Ronson, Disco Infiltrator

2792
02:24:07,840 --> 02:24:12,560
by LCD Sound System, Allen will like that, Dissolve by the Chemical Brothers, Embracing

2793
02:24:12,560 --> 02:24:18,440
the Future by BT, Flying High by Faithless, Good Girl by Benny Benassi, Hey Boy Hey Girl

2794
02:24:18,440 --> 02:24:26,280
by the Chemical Brothers, an air song, Mylo, Orbital, System F, 808 State, Goldfrap, Aeroplane,

2795
02:24:26,280 --> 02:24:31,200
Deep Dish, Aphex Twin, Pet Shop Boys, this looks fucking great.

2796
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:37,560
Like, I'm really excited about this game, so, and a lot of it sounds really awesome.

2797
02:24:37,560 --> 02:24:42,720
So, yeah, if you haven't seen the song list for this, you probably want to head over to

2798
02:24:42,720 --> 02:24:48,400
the Luminous page on Facebook and check this out, because, yeah, I'm definitely, if I pick

2799
02:24:48,400 --> 02:24:53,680
up a Vita launch day, which is looking very likely, because I did my taxes, and I'm looking

2800
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:57,440
good, so I might be able to get one of these when they come out, so, I'm excited.

2801
02:24:57,440 --> 02:24:59,760
I don't think my wife will let me have one.

2802
02:24:59,760 --> 02:25:01,160
Aw, womp womp.

2803
02:25:01,160 --> 02:25:04,400
I am considering selling my 3DS to get a Vita.

2804
02:25:04,400 --> 02:25:05,400
To me.

2805
02:25:05,400 --> 02:25:06,400
We'll see.

2806
02:25:06,400 --> 02:25:11,720
Thinking about it, huh?

2807
02:25:11,720 --> 02:25:16,480
The only drawback to the whole Luminous thing is that I am still feeling a little bit bitter

2808
02:25:16,480 --> 02:25:21,240
about the fact that I've bought Luminous, like, five times now.

2809
02:25:21,240 --> 02:25:26,080
Like what, there was Luminous, Luminous 2, Luminous PC, Luminous Xbox 360, I never did

2810
02:25:26,080 --> 02:25:29,120
get the PlayStation 3 one, but I seriously thought about it.

2811
02:25:29,120 --> 02:25:33,880
I'm not in a huge hurry to get a Vita, because, like, you know, the launch games are cool,

2812
02:25:33,880 --> 02:25:39,840
and, you know, Konomari might be fun, but, it's not a, like, there's not anything that

2813
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:43,580
I must, must, must, must have on the Vita right now, it's kind of like, well, these

2814
02:25:43,580 --> 02:25:50,800
are the ones I would pick, but, I don't know, it's, I might want to wait, you know, wait

2815
02:25:50,800 --> 02:25:55,920
until fourth quarter or something like that, because really, I mean, I don't play my 3DS,

2816
02:25:55,920 --> 02:26:01,720
I really don't play my 3DS, and, and I'm just kind of like, uhh, is there really something

2817
02:26:01,720 --> 02:26:05,920
gonna come out that I'm gonna play my 3DS for, I mean, am I really gonna want to pick

2818
02:26:05,920 --> 02:26:12,000
up, you know, Kid Icarus, and is it gonna be something that's gonna hold my attention?

2819
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:13,000
Maybe not.

2820
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:14,000
I don't think so.

2821
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,280
And even Mario Kart's kind of just gone away.

2822
02:26:16,280 --> 02:26:20,120
Brakeman in our chat says, I thought Loki was about to say, I'm thinking about selling

2823
02:26:20,120 --> 02:26:22,320
my wife to get it.

2824
02:26:22,320 --> 02:26:23,320
No.

2825
02:26:23,320 --> 02:26:24,320
No.

2826
02:26:24,320 --> 02:26:28,920
Can't do that.

2827
02:26:28,920 --> 02:26:30,680
She'd complain about that.

2828
02:26:30,680 --> 02:26:31,820
She would not like that.

2829
02:26:31,820 --> 02:26:32,820
She would not like that.

2830
02:26:32,820 --> 02:26:35,760
All right, just a few more stories for you guys, then we're gonna get to the Twitter

2831
02:26:35,760 --> 02:26:41,960
topics and the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

2832
02:26:41,960 --> 02:26:43,720
But first, a few more stories.

2833
02:26:43,720 --> 02:26:44,720
Dark Sakura?

2834
02:26:44,720 --> 02:26:48,760
Actually, I have to stop and correct, bones006.

2835
02:26:48,760 --> 02:26:52,720
The letters U-R do not spell anything.

2836
02:26:52,720 --> 02:26:54,440
It spells ur.

2837
02:26:54,440 --> 02:27:04,160
It's Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E. Dear Lord, stop looking ignorant.

2838
02:27:04,160 --> 02:27:08,320
When you have U-R, that's two-thirds of an urn, which Dark Sakura will have you end up

2839
02:27:08,320 --> 02:27:13,520
in if you don't change your ways.

2840
02:27:13,520 --> 02:27:15,360
Be nice to the listeners, Jamie.

2841
02:27:15,360 --> 02:27:16,800
Be nice to the listeners.

2842
02:27:16,800 --> 02:27:17,880
I am being nice.

2843
02:27:17,880 --> 02:27:22,720
I'm doing them a serious favor that will help them get a job and earn the respect of people

2844
02:27:22,720 --> 02:27:24,660
around them.

2845
02:27:24,660 --> 02:27:28,480
So fuck your Yankee blue jeans.

2846
02:27:28,480 --> 02:27:30,640
There was a part where you did video game news.

2847
02:27:30,640 --> 02:27:38,800
Oh yeah, there was a comment by Kaz Hirai, who's going to be going in as CEO of Sony,

2848
02:27:38,800 --> 02:27:42,000
and he thinks that Sony's kind of in trouble.

2849
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:45,680
He spoke with the Wall Street Journal about their financial report.

2850
02:27:45,680 --> 02:27:52,360
As you remember, they lost like 1.3 billion pounds, because I'm going off a British site,

2851
02:27:52,360 --> 02:27:59,600
so, in their last financial quarter, and expect to report a loss of 2.9 billion dollars for

2852
02:27:59,600 --> 02:28:01,480
the full year.

2853
02:28:01,480 --> 02:28:06,920
That's, I think, was it the fourth year that they've been in the red?

2854
02:28:06,920 --> 02:28:08,880
Something like that?

2855
02:28:08,880 --> 02:28:15,040
Anyway, he said, and this is a quote, I thought turning around the PlayStation business was

2856
02:28:15,040 --> 02:28:18,360
going to be the toughest challenge of my career, but I guess it's not.

2857
02:28:18,360 --> 02:28:19,480
It's one issue after another.

2858
02:28:19,480 --> 02:28:23,680
I feel like, holy shit, now what?

2859
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:30,120
And saying that his strategy for recovery basically means we're not going to wrestle

2860
02:28:30,120 --> 02:28:34,820
my laurels anymore, we're going to really push the user experience.

2861
02:28:34,820 --> 02:28:39,560
He says that they need to buckle down and be realistic, but people are coming around

2862
02:28:39,560 --> 02:28:42,080
to the idea even though not everyone's on board.

2863
02:28:42,080 --> 02:28:47,440
If they don't catch up, they're going to die.

2864
02:28:47,440 --> 02:28:52,600
This just strikes me really weird that somebody like that would say, holy shit, now what?

2865
02:28:52,600 --> 02:28:56,400
In an interview, but I mean, I'm looking at the source in the Wall Street Journal right

2866
02:28:56,400 --> 02:28:57,400
here.

2867
02:28:57,400 --> 02:28:58,400
There it is.

2868
02:28:58,400 --> 02:28:59,400
That's, that's just weird.

2869
02:28:59,400 --> 02:29:02,640
This strikes me as odd.

2870
02:29:02,640 --> 02:29:05,840
I mean, we can swear all we want, but we're not CEOs of Sony.

2871
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:06,840
It's just weird.

2872
02:29:06,840 --> 02:29:09,040
And that kid is flipping somebody off.

2873
02:29:09,040 --> 02:29:12,360
Wow, he totally is in this little preview.

2874
02:29:12,360 --> 02:29:13,360
I didn't know.

2875
02:29:13,360 --> 02:29:14,360
Trailer for what?

2876
02:29:14,360 --> 02:29:15,360
Chronicle.

2877
02:29:15,360 --> 02:29:18,720
Isn't that that movie you were talking about a few weeks ago that you really wanted to

2878
02:29:18,720 --> 02:29:19,720
see?

2879
02:29:19,720 --> 02:29:20,720
They came out in theaters this week.

2880
02:29:20,720 --> 02:29:21,720
Did you know that?

2881
02:29:21,720 --> 02:29:23,280
I saw this.

2882
02:29:23,280 --> 02:29:26,680
You don't say, did you go see it or did you see it?

2883
02:29:26,680 --> 02:29:29,480
That just that, that ad makes me think, fuck you clouds.

2884
02:29:29,480 --> 02:29:33,100
I know he's actually look at the clouds.

2885
02:29:33,100 --> 02:29:34,100
They're flipping him off too.

2886
02:29:34,100 --> 02:29:35,100
I don't know.

2887
02:29:35,100 --> 02:29:36,100
Yeah.

2888
02:29:36,100 --> 02:29:37,100
It's the clouds fingers too.

2889
02:29:37,100 --> 02:29:38,100
That's kind of interesting.

2890
02:29:38,100 --> 02:29:42,000
Anyway, so back to the story at hand.

2891
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:47,120
It's weird that Sony, I mean, I feel like Sony's in a better place now so much more

2892
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:49,200
than they were four years ago.

2893
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:53,320
Like they were a hot mess when PlayStation three late first came out, but now things

2894
02:29:53,320 --> 02:29:57,400
are getting a little better, but there are still some big falls that they make.

2895
02:29:57,400 --> 02:30:00,320
Like, I just don't think the move.

2896
02:30:00,320 --> 02:30:06,560
I mean, as nice as the move is, I do think the move feels a lot better than the Wii as

2897
02:30:06,560 --> 02:30:07,560
it should.

2898
02:30:07,560 --> 02:30:11,120
The technology's a little newer, but they never really came out with that must have

2899
02:30:11,120 --> 02:30:12,120
game for it.

2900
02:30:12,120 --> 02:30:13,120
You know what I mean?

2901
02:30:13,120 --> 02:30:15,300
Everything kind of felt like a copycat of the Wii.

2902
02:30:15,300 --> 02:30:17,880
And I think that's part of where a lot of their losses come from.

2903
02:30:17,880 --> 02:30:24,560
But at the same time, I pretty much play games on my PS3 almost exclusively right now, unless

2904
02:30:24,560 --> 02:30:30,120
it's like exclusive on 360 or there's people I know on Xbox 360 that I can play the games

2905
02:30:30,120 --> 02:30:33,520
with, you know, or like a deliberate multiplayer game.

2906
02:30:33,520 --> 02:30:36,200
And all my friends are playing it on 360.

2907
02:30:36,200 --> 02:30:40,400
So it's just interesting that Sony is losing all this money.

2908
02:30:40,400 --> 02:30:48,520
But I guess now, is this considering other arms of Sony too, like not just PSP, but maybe

2909
02:30:48,520 --> 02:30:53,560
like, or excuse me, just not just like PlayStation and that stuff, but like movies?

2910
02:30:53,560 --> 02:30:56,120
I guess turn that around too.

2911
02:30:56,120 --> 02:30:59,320
I think it's mostly non-gaming.

2912
02:30:59,320 --> 02:31:00,840
I think it's more of their electronics.

2913
02:31:00,840 --> 02:31:04,080
Because their electronics are fucking expensive.

2914
02:31:04,080 --> 02:31:07,320
I mean, just insanely expensive.

2915
02:31:07,320 --> 02:31:14,560
We got a, as like a promotion thing, we got a gift card to Sony, and their shit is so

2916
02:31:14,560 --> 02:31:16,120
fucking expensive.

2917
02:31:16,120 --> 02:31:17,120
It's just ridiculous.

2918
02:31:17,120 --> 02:31:21,640
Like for stuff that's just, you know, half the price for something better elsewhere,

2919
02:31:21,640 --> 02:31:26,640
it's just such a markup for the brand.

2920
02:31:26,640 --> 02:31:33,080
Yeah, maybe when they kind of take the JC Penney approach, they'll cut all their prices

2921
02:31:33,080 --> 02:31:34,080
by 40%.

2922
02:31:34,080 --> 02:31:40,280
You know, I mean, not to say that, I mean, Sony stuff's alright, because I have a Sony

2923
02:31:40,280 --> 02:31:46,800
camera, a Sony camcorder, a Sony sound system, a Sony TV, a Sony PlayStation 3, a Sony PSP.

2924
02:31:46,800 --> 02:31:50,120
Of course, most of that stuff was given to me for free.

2925
02:31:50,120 --> 02:31:53,480
But it's not bad.

2926
02:31:53,480 --> 02:31:56,720
It's just really fucking expensive.

2927
02:31:56,720 --> 02:32:05,000
JV Mon in chat says, four years ago, Sony stock was worth double than what it is now.

2928
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,400
After 2009, it's been pretty much downhill since.

2929
02:32:07,400 --> 02:32:11,360
Well, yeah, I mean, I don't know, I guess maybe just from the limited perspective, where

2930
02:32:11,360 --> 02:32:15,440
I think of Sony, I think of PlayStation, I think four years ago, they were a mess.

2931
02:32:15,440 --> 02:32:18,440
And maybe there was excitement about the PlayStation 3 and all that, but they, you know, there

2932
02:32:18,440 --> 02:32:20,760
were some huge missteps there for a couple years.

2933
02:32:20,760 --> 02:32:22,800
Then things got back on the right track.

2934
02:32:22,800 --> 02:32:25,400
And then they just, you know, they had the move happen.

2935
02:32:25,400 --> 02:32:27,720
They had the hack happen.

2936
02:32:27,720 --> 02:32:30,400
And you know, it's like they just kind of keep getting kicked down.

2937
02:32:30,400 --> 02:32:37,040
So they get knocked down, but they get up again.

2938
02:32:37,040 --> 02:32:38,920
All right.

2939
02:32:38,920 --> 02:32:42,700
Anyhow, let's do another story, Loki.

2940
02:32:42,700 --> 02:32:49,880
So let's talk a little bit about sales from a company that's struggling so hard to overcome

2941
02:32:49,880 --> 02:32:52,600
use game sales.

2942
02:32:52,600 --> 02:32:54,200
I feel so bad for these guys.

2943
02:32:54,200 --> 02:32:58,560
I mean, EA has got it so hard, so hard.

2944
02:32:58,560 --> 02:33:00,800
You said so hard.

2945
02:33:00,800 --> 02:33:09,200
FIFA 12 and Battlefield 3 only sold 10 million units, only 10 million units.

2946
02:33:09,200 --> 02:33:11,160
How do they manage?

2947
02:33:11,160 --> 02:33:18,640
Madden, only 5 million units sold since August.

2948
02:33:18,640 --> 02:33:19,780
Poor struggling company.

2949
02:33:19,780 --> 02:33:20,780
I feel so bad.

2950
02:33:20,780 --> 02:33:21,780
I'm going to go buy a new game.

2951
02:33:21,780 --> 02:33:24,240
I'm going to buy all their games brand new tomorrow.

2952
02:33:24,240 --> 02:33:27,640
Just going to go right out and buy all of them.

2953
02:33:27,640 --> 02:33:30,120
Just because I think they're doing such a swell job.

2954
02:33:30,120 --> 02:33:31,120
Or not.

2955
02:33:31,120 --> 02:33:38,160
Um, Star Wars The Old Republic has sold 200 million copies, and they already have...

2956
02:33:38,160 --> 02:33:39,160
No, no.

2957
02:33:39,160 --> 02:33:40,160
I'm sorry.

2958
02:33:40,160 --> 02:33:41,160
Not 200.

2959
02:33:41,160 --> 02:33:42,160
Thank you.

2960
02:33:42,160 --> 02:33:43,160
2 million.

2961
02:33:43,160 --> 02:33:44,160
I'm like, no way.

2962
02:33:44,160 --> 02:33:45,160
Sorry.

2963
02:33:45,160 --> 02:33:52,960
They have 1.7 million households, and 1.7 million are active each day, on average.

2964
02:33:52,960 --> 02:33:53,960
That's not bad.

2965
02:33:53,960 --> 02:33:58,120
I mean, for a user base, especially when they talk like, you know, EA came out with their

2966
02:33:58,120 --> 02:34:03,520
origin numbers where they said they have like 7 million user accounts or something like

2967
02:34:03,520 --> 02:34:04,520
that.

2968
02:34:04,520 --> 02:34:09,680
Which I'm sure a lot lesser than that percentage is active, but 1.7 out of 2 million is not

2969
02:34:09,680 --> 02:34:10,680
bad.

2970
02:34:10,680 --> 02:34:11,680
To be fair, yeah.

2971
02:34:11,680 --> 02:34:16,080
Wow has, what, 10 million active subscribers right now, and at their peak, they had about

2972
02:34:16,080 --> 02:34:17,080
12 million.

2973
02:34:17,080 --> 02:34:19,520
I don't know how many copies of the game they've sold.

2974
02:34:19,520 --> 02:34:20,520
I would guess...

2975
02:34:20,520 --> 02:34:21,520
That's global.

2976
02:34:21,520 --> 02:34:22,520
Probably like, yeah, it is global.

2977
02:34:22,520 --> 02:34:25,440
15 or 20 million, probably at some point.

2978
02:34:25,440 --> 02:34:29,600
And I mean, I mean, everybody can't be on that game every day.

2979
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:32,160
I mean, some people do have, you know, other things they gotta do.

2980
02:34:32,160 --> 02:34:36,920
Well, I am one of those people in the Gap where I bought the game and I cancelled after

2981
02:34:36,920 --> 02:34:37,920
the first month.

2982
02:34:37,920 --> 02:34:40,680
I just didn't really want to keep playing.

2983
02:34:40,680 --> 02:34:46,400
It's alright, I just think the game needs some tweaks and needs some improvements.

2984
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:54,800
And I don't know, some things happen in WoW and I'm playing WoW a lot more.

2985
02:34:54,800 --> 02:35:01,520
And then of course, EA's had the benefit of some DLC sales, and they've done well with

2986
02:35:01,520 --> 02:35:02,840
certain types of DLC.

2987
02:35:02,840 --> 02:35:17,760
In fact, in just three months, FIFA 12's Ultimate Team DLC has generated $39 million in microtransactions.

2988
02:35:17,760 --> 02:35:21,800
That's 69% more than it generated in the same period last year.

2989
02:35:21,800 --> 02:35:22,800
Gee!

2990
02:35:22,800 --> 02:35:23,800
I wonder why.

2991
02:35:23,800 --> 02:35:24,800
Wonder why.

2992
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:29,360
I'm sorry, but when I heard EA gloating that statistic, I was like, that's insulting.

2993
02:35:29,360 --> 02:35:34,000
That is insulting because you know where that money's coming from.

2994
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:39,560
You know, like, I don't know, I kind of feel like in order to justify it, EA needed to

2995
02:35:39,560 --> 02:35:43,520
say, oh, this is subtracting all the, you know, we didn't count the money that, you

2996
02:35:43,520 --> 02:35:46,600
know, we had to give back because, you know, it was stolen or whatever.

2997
02:35:46,600 --> 02:35:50,800
Like it's just, I don't know, like that was a really sore spot.

2998
02:35:50,800 --> 02:35:54,360
Like I realized their need to gloat to appease the shareholders and all that stuff.

2999
02:35:54,360 --> 02:35:57,800
But again, fucking stop denying that there's a problem.

3000
02:35:57,800 --> 02:35:58,800
Stop it.

3001
02:35:58,800 --> 02:36:01,440
Is EA giving back that money or is Microsoft giving back that money?

3002
02:36:01,440 --> 02:36:02,440
It's a thing.

3003
02:36:02,440 --> 02:36:04,440
Who's taking the hit on that?

3004
02:36:04,440 --> 02:36:06,200
I don't know.

3005
02:36:06,200 --> 02:36:07,200
It's all digital, so.

3006
02:36:07,200 --> 02:36:10,120
I would imagine Microsoft takes back the money from EA.

3007
02:36:10,120 --> 02:36:12,360
I mean, I imagine they have to.

3008
02:36:12,360 --> 02:36:21,240
And then of course they're saying, you know, to put, according to the chief financial officer

3009
02:36:21,240 --> 02:36:26,600
Eric Brown, to put some rough numbers on this, if we compare the total digital revenue from

3010
02:36:26,600 --> 02:36:32,920
FIFA 11 Ultimate Team to what we expect from FIFA 12 Ultimate Team this fiscal year, we're

3011
02:36:32,920 --> 02:36:37,000
looking to see a 25% increase franchise to franchise.

3012
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:41,760
Yeah, I wonder where the 25% come from.

3013
02:36:41,760 --> 02:36:46,680
Their overall packaged goods units sold is not increasing by 25%.

3014
02:36:46,680 --> 02:36:47,680
Hmm.

3015
02:36:47,680 --> 02:36:49,240
Gee.

3016
02:36:49,240 --> 02:36:55,320
And so we're expanding by a decent margin the microtransactions, microtransaction revenue

3017
02:36:55,320 --> 02:37:00,560
per user of FIFA.

3018
02:37:00,560 --> 02:37:04,920
And then it's funny because, you know, like the people covering this, it's like, yeah,

3019
02:37:04,920 --> 02:37:08,560
we continue to receive complaints nearly every day of non FIFA players having their accounts

3020
02:37:08,560 --> 02:37:11,360
hacked to purchase Ultimate Team DLC.

3021
02:37:11,360 --> 02:37:18,480
Oh yeah, I still hear about it on Twitter and I hear about it, you know, hacked on Xbox.

3022
02:37:18,480 --> 02:37:22,720
You know, they're still writing down a bunch of, yeah, I forgot about that website.

3023
02:37:22,720 --> 02:37:24,760
I check it all the time because I'm on their Twitter feed.

3024
02:37:24,760 --> 02:37:29,880
I check it and they've got 30 stories on there right now and a lot more that get posted.

3025
02:37:29,880 --> 02:37:33,880
She's kind of running behind on posting all that because she's getting a lot of emails,

3026
02:37:33,880 --> 02:37:34,880
but sure.

3027
02:37:34,880 --> 02:37:40,800
And there's some that I saw that were so ridiculous that like, Oh yeah, you know, we were going

3028
02:37:40,800 --> 02:37:47,040
to re give you back your money, but we're not going to because you put your, like, you

3029
02:37:47,040 --> 02:37:49,000
didn't put your full name on your account.

3030
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:55,420
You just put like, it'd be like, if I didn't put Matthew, I put Matt on my account.

3031
02:37:55,420 --> 02:38:00,000
That's bull because my legal name I don't have on my Xbox and I still got it.

3032
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:03,160
Yeah, but see, they pulled that bullshit.

3033
02:38:03,160 --> 02:38:04,160
Stupid.

3034
02:38:04,160 --> 02:38:05,200
All right.

3035
02:38:05,200 --> 02:38:08,960
I guess I should be thankful that I didn't have quite the nightmare problem a lot of

3036
02:38:08,960 --> 02:38:11,680
people are having, although it did take a month.

3037
02:38:11,680 --> 02:38:15,480
That's the average time, 20 or 25 days is what I've been hearing.

3038
02:38:15,480 --> 02:38:16,480
Ridiculous.

3039
02:38:16,480 --> 02:38:19,080
One more ridiculous story for you guys.

3040
02:38:19,080 --> 02:38:23,160
Remember last week we were talking about the whole Zynga, uh, the rip off artists where

3041
02:38:23,160 --> 02:38:28,320
they were making their own, like was dream Heights, uh, was a complete knockoff of tiny

3042
02:38:28,320 --> 02:38:29,320
tower.

3043
02:38:29,320 --> 02:38:32,360
Well, Zynga finally came out and made a statement on the whole thing.

3044
02:38:32,360 --> 02:38:36,920
Uh, and it went along these lines, Mark Pincus, who's the head of Zynga quote, you should

3045
02:38:36,920 --> 02:38:41,320
be careful not to throw stones when you live in glass houses.

3046
02:38:41,320 --> 02:38:45,580
When you pull the lens back, you saw that their tower game looks similar to five other

3047
02:38:45,580 --> 02:38:57,760
tower games going all the way back to sim tower in the early 1990s bull shit, bull shit.

3048
02:38:57,760 --> 02:39:03,860
That comparison of tiny tower to sim tower is a lazy, ignorant comparison that tells

3049
02:39:03,860 --> 02:39:09,920
me you have never played sim tower in your life because sim tower was way, I mean in

3050
02:39:09,920 --> 02:39:16,000
a way sim tower is a more complex, smarter game than tiny tower.

3051
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:20,200
That's not a knock on tiny tower because the great thing about tiny tower is that it's

3052
02:39:20,200 --> 02:39:24,280
great for a 30, 45 second, one minute fix.

3053
02:39:24,280 --> 02:39:28,720
That's what that game is for, but there is not nearly the level of micromanaging that

3054
02:39:28,720 --> 02:39:30,260
there is in sim tower.

3055
02:39:30,260 --> 02:39:31,820
You know what those games have in common?

3056
02:39:31,820 --> 02:39:33,740
They're both about skyscrapers.

3057
02:39:33,740 --> 02:39:34,740
That's it.

3058
02:39:34,740 --> 02:39:36,040
And they have tower in the name.

3059
02:39:36,040 --> 02:39:39,580
Like you don't really manage the people in sim tower.

3060
02:39:39,580 --> 02:39:44,840
You manage your tower, you manage the escalators, the elevators, what type of businesses you're

3061
02:39:44,840 --> 02:39:45,840
putting in.

3062
02:39:45,840 --> 02:39:53,680
It's just, it's a lazy, lazy comparison, especially when their game is such a blatant, you know,

3063
02:39:53,680 --> 02:39:55,760
rip off of all the mechanics.

3064
02:39:55,760 --> 02:39:59,260
Sim tower is not like tiny tower in that way.

3065
02:39:59,260 --> 02:40:05,480
And then moving on in an internal memo to associates, here's how they justify it.

3066
02:40:05,480 --> 02:40:09,160
Quote, Google didn't create the first search engine.

3067
02:40:09,160 --> 02:40:12,560
Apple didn't create the first MP3 player or tablet.

3068
02:40:12,560 --> 02:40:15,540
And Facebook didn't create the first social network.

3069
02:40:15,540 --> 02:40:19,940
But these companies have evolved products and categories in revolutionary ways.

3070
02:40:19,940 --> 02:40:24,000
They are all internet treasures because they all have specific and broad missions to change

3071
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:25,000
the world.

3072
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:29,600
If that wasn't blowing smoke up their employees ass, I don't know what was.

3073
02:40:29,600 --> 02:40:32,940
Because seriously, how is that the same?

3074
02:40:32,940 --> 02:40:33,940
How is that the same?

3075
02:40:33,940 --> 02:40:34,940
It's not.

3076
02:40:34,940 --> 02:40:37,480
Google didn't create the first search engine.

3077
02:40:37,480 --> 02:40:40,960
That's true, but they created the best search engine.

3078
02:40:40,960 --> 02:40:46,200
Okay, so tiny tower didn't create the first tower game.

3079
02:40:46,200 --> 02:40:49,520
But they created a really good one for iOS systems.

3080
02:40:49,520 --> 02:40:51,800
And you fucking jacked it all and made new art.

3081
02:40:51,800 --> 02:40:52,800
That's it.

3082
02:40:52,800 --> 02:40:57,720
Google didn't copy the code for Yahoo and change the name to Google on it.

3083
02:40:57,720 --> 02:41:03,480
And Google actually has, it's like their whole search process is done by all kinds of different

3084
02:41:03,480 --> 02:41:04,480
calculations, too.

3085
02:41:04,480 --> 02:41:08,800
I mean, it's really complex.

3086
02:41:08,800 --> 02:41:09,800
It's just...

3087
02:41:09,800 --> 02:41:13,600
And then they've taken Google and made a full spectrum product out of it.

3088
02:41:13,600 --> 02:41:14,600
This is their MSC.

3089
02:41:14,600 --> 02:41:21,640
I used to give Gameloft crap for ripping off games like Halo and stuff like that and coming

3090
02:41:21,640 --> 02:41:22,640
up with their own.

3091
02:41:22,640 --> 02:41:23,640
But you know what?

3092
02:41:23,640 --> 02:41:24,640
They came up with their own game.

3093
02:41:24,640 --> 02:41:27,040
Yes, the genre looks exactly the same as Halo.

3094
02:41:27,040 --> 02:41:29,820
It's a futuristic thing, it kind of resembles stuff.

3095
02:41:29,820 --> 02:41:33,760
But it's not a fucking like, oh, we took Halo and we reskinned everything.

3096
02:41:33,760 --> 02:41:40,040
Now it's, you know, Circle or Space Circle.

3097
02:41:40,040 --> 02:41:44,920
Brakeman in our chat room says, Zinga is currently making a podcast called Red Lounge Radio.

3098
02:41:44,920 --> 02:41:47,800
It will be on the More Than All Games Network.

3099
02:41:47,800 --> 02:41:50,200
He actually fooled somebody in chat.

3100
02:41:50,200 --> 02:41:51,200
Really?

3101
02:41:51,200 --> 02:41:55,960
Frisbee says, dear everyone who plays Zinga games, please stop being a person that plays

3102
02:41:55,960 --> 02:41:56,960
Zinga games.

3103
02:41:56,960 --> 02:41:58,200
Love humans everywhere.

3104
02:41:58,200 --> 02:42:05,400
Jvmon brings out the harsh reality, chat.orangelaunchradio.com saying, Zinga's stock doubled after the Facebook

3105
02:42:05,400 --> 02:42:06,400
IPO this week.

3106
02:42:06,400 --> 02:42:09,800
Well, when you see how really dependent they were on each other, as if you didn't already

3107
02:42:09,800 --> 02:42:14,680
know, I mean, Facebook in their filing basically had to say a lot more about the internal workings

3108
02:42:14,680 --> 02:42:15,680
of their company.

3109
02:42:15,680 --> 02:42:20,120
And one of those things is that they kind of fucking rely on Zinga for people to return

3110
02:42:20,120 --> 02:42:22,760
visit to Facebook, just like Zinga fucking relies on Facebook.

3111
02:42:22,760 --> 02:42:25,780
Because didn't Zinga try to make their own portal?

3112
02:42:25,780 --> 02:42:29,500
Like, I remember there was a time where Zinga was like, well, we don't really, like, remember

3113
02:42:29,500 --> 02:42:32,020
when Google Plus was gonna murder everything?

3114
02:42:32,020 --> 02:42:35,000
And Zinga was like, well, we don't really need Facebook.

3115
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:40,520
We're gonna get everybody to come to our Zinga game, you know, Zinga book, or whatever they

3116
02:42:40,520 --> 02:42:41,520
were gonna do.

3117
02:42:41,520 --> 02:42:44,040
Yeah, I could see them doing that shit.

3118
02:42:44,040 --> 02:42:46,480
We'll make our own social network.

3119
02:42:46,480 --> 02:42:47,480
That's right.

3120
02:42:47,480 --> 02:42:54,000
We're just gonna copy paste Facebook, and we're gonna call it Portrait Journal.

3121
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:58,360
Now one final note on this whole story, Nimblebit, who made Tiny Tower, did not let this all

3122
02:42:58,360 --> 02:43:00,680
go by unscathed.

3123
02:43:00,680 --> 02:43:06,320
The co-founder Ian Marsh talked to Touch Arcade and said, quote, it was a smart idea for Mark

3124
02:43:06,320 --> 02:43:10,720
Pincus and Zinga to try and lump all games with the name Tower together as an actual

3125
02:43:10,720 --> 02:43:14,080
genre whose games borrow from each other.

3126
02:43:14,080 --> 02:43:18,400
Sharing a name or a setting does not a genre make.

3127
02:43:18,400 --> 02:43:19,800
Agreed.

3128
02:43:19,800 --> 02:43:26,920
For example, 13 Ghosts may be about a haunted house, but it's not the same kind of movie

3129
02:43:26,920 --> 02:43:30,680
as High Spirits, for example.

3130
02:43:30,680 --> 02:43:34,880
They also, there was another game that was like some sort of bingo game or something

3131
02:43:34,880 --> 02:43:38,720
like that that they were also shown ripping off of, and there was also a poker game that

3132
02:43:38,720 --> 02:43:41,120
they also ripped off of.

3133
02:43:41,120 --> 02:43:42,120
This is their ML.

3134
02:43:42,120 --> 02:43:43,120
This is what they do.

3135
02:43:43,120 --> 02:43:44,120
And you know what?

3136
02:43:44,120 --> 02:43:46,520
No one can really fight them because their change, what they're doing is they're going

3137
02:43:46,520 --> 02:43:52,880
in, they're trying to change as much as they need to, to not get a lawsuit thrown at them.

3138
02:43:52,880 --> 02:44:01,560
Jamie, is that like saying the movie Independence Day isn't really about the 4th of July?

3139
02:44:01,560 --> 02:44:09,480
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, the Skype line is open now.

3140
02:44:09,480 --> 02:44:12,600
Give us a call if you want to talk about anything we've talked about tonight, or maybe there's

3141
02:44:12,600 --> 02:44:17,520
something we missed that you wanted to bring up, or hell, I don't know, just call us if

3142
02:44:17,520 --> 02:44:18,520
you want to say hello.

3143
02:44:18,520 --> 02:44:23,440
We do have a reduced amount of live listeners tonight because of football games and so forth,

3144
02:44:23,440 --> 02:44:28,840
but I do see there are some of you listening there in our chat room, the few, the loyal

3145
02:44:28,840 --> 02:44:29,840
at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

3146
02:44:29,840 --> 02:44:34,680
So go ahead and call us, 1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3147
02:44:34,680 --> 02:44:35,680
All right.

3148
02:44:35,680 --> 02:44:39,960
Meanwhile, we're going to do some tweets, and what, did you have something, Loki, you

3149
02:44:39,960 --> 02:44:40,960
want to add?

3150
02:44:40,960 --> 02:44:41,960
Just real quick.

3151
02:44:41,960 --> 02:44:48,520
Apparently there's a PlayStation Network update that just happened that has blocked users

3152
02:44:48,520 --> 02:44:52,200
from accessing their paid content in the PAL territories.

3153
02:44:52,200 --> 02:44:54,800
Oh, it's like, what?

3154
02:44:54,800 --> 02:45:00,840
Apparently it's those, you know, who have done the update are getting an error labeled

3155
02:45:00,840 --> 02:45:07,200
as 800-231-02, which helpfully informs them that no content was found when the user tries

3156
02:45:07,200 --> 02:45:12,120
to download or re-download PlayStation Network content they've already purchased.

3157
02:45:12,120 --> 02:45:14,200
All right.

3158
02:45:14,200 --> 02:45:17,880
Going to our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

3159
02:45:17,880 --> 02:45:22,100
You know, not a lot of activities on Twitter either, although there were some nice tweets.

3160
02:45:22,100 --> 02:45:24,640
I'll read some of these like nice tweets that are there.

3161
02:45:24,640 --> 02:45:27,000
Breakman says, I might show up later for OLR.

3162
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:30,240
I'll be pretty drunk though, so good luck to them.

3163
02:45:30,240 --> 02:45:36,760
And Curly K. T. K. on Twitter says, putting the Super Bowl on mute to listen to OLR.

3164
02:45:36,760 --> 02:45:37,760
Good job.

3165
02:45:37,760 --> 02:45:38,760
Good job.

3166
02:45:38,760 --> 02:45:39,760
All right.

3167
02:45:39,760 --> 02:45:40,760
We do have some calls coming in.

3168
02:45:40,760 --> 02:45:41,760
So let's go to the phones.

3169
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:42,760
Hi, you're on Orange On The Radio.

3170
02:45:42,760 --> 02:45:43,760
Who's this?

3171
02:45:43,760 --> 02:45:47,520
Hey, it's the guy who's normally CD Thunder and chat, but tonight I'm God of Thunder.

3172
02:45:47,520 --> 02:45:48,520
How are you all doing?

3173
02:45:48,520 --> 02:45:49,520
Good.

3174
02:45:49,520 --> 02:45:50,520
How are you?

3175
02:45:50,520 --> 02:45:51,520
God of Thunder?

3176
02:45:51,520 --> 02:45:52,520
Not too bad.

3177
02:45:52,520 --> 02:45:54,000
I've got a couple of quick things I'd like to talk about.

3178
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:55,000
Yeah.

3179
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,560
What do you want to talk about?

3180
02:45:57,560 --> 02:46:00,880
First off quickly, I'd like to talk about Darkness 2.

3181
02:46:00,880 --> 02:46:02,680
Darkness 2.

3182
02:46:02,680 --> 02:46:04,880
Is this the one that's coming out or is this the one that was out?

3183
02:46:04,880 --> 02:46:06,920
This is the one that's coming out on Tuesday.

3184
02:46:06,920 --> 02:46:07,920
Okay.

3185
02:46:07,920 --> 02:46:10,480
What do you want to talk about Darkness 2?

3186
02:46:10,480 --> 02:46:16,840
Well, from what I've seen in the demo, this game looks completely over the top and gory

3187
02:46:16,840 --> 02:46:21,160
and sick and it just looks really awesome.

3188
02:46:21,160 --> 02:46:25,920
I wish I could actually play it, but yeah, it just looks really awesome.

3189
02:46:25,920 --> 02:46:31,000
This is the game looks over the top and gory and disgusting and I love it.

3190
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:36,600
That's like how I felt after I played the Bayonetta demo.

3191
02:46:36,600 --> 02:46:40,840
So are you going to pre-order your copy of Darkness 2?

3192
02:46:40,840 --> 02:46:47,560
Well, as I said before, I don't actually have the system to play it on, but if I did, I

3193
02:46:47,560 --> 02:46:48,560
would.

3194
02:46:48,560 --> 02:46:49,560
Well, you know what you have to do?

3195
02:46:49,560 --> 02:46:50,560
You're going to have to steal one.

3196
02:46:50,560 --> 02:46:51,560
No, I'm just kidding.

3197
02:46:51,560 --> 02:46:52,560
Don't steal.

3198
02:46:52,560 --> 02:46:53,560
Don't steal.

3199
02:46:53,560 --> 02:46:54,560
No, no, no.

3200
02:46:54,560 --> 02:46:55,560
All right.

3201
02:46:55,560 --> 02:47:00,720
Well, do you have a friend who might buy it?

3202
02:47:00,720 --> 02:47:05,160
Sometimes we have a rich friend who has all that stuff, like growing up, I didn't get

3203
02:47:05,160 --> 02:47:07,920
a Super Nintendo when they first came out, but my rich friend did, so I'd go over to

3204
02:47:07,920 --> 02:47:08,920
his house.

3205
02:47:08,920 --> 02:47:13,600
Well, I don't know if anybody that I know would get it or not.

3206
02:47:13,600 --> 02:47:14,840
I just really don't know.

3207
02:47:14,840 --> 02:47:15,840
All right.

3208
02:47:15,840 --> 02:47:17,280
Well, that's all right.

3209
02:47:17,280 --> 02:47:21,740
But the other thing I'd like to talk about quickly is I was talking to a friend of mine

3210
02:47:21,740 --> 02:47:28,400
today and apparently can actually get a classic Nintendo Entertainment System controller,

3211
02:47:28,400 --> 02:47:35,040
USB, and plug it into your USB port in the computer and use that to play Nintendo Entertainment

3212
02:47:35,040 --> 02:47:39,080
System games on the website that I linked to the chat room a few minutes earlier.

3213
02:47:39,080 --> 02:47:40,080
What was the website?

3214
02:47:40,080 --> 02:47:41,080
Because you sent us the email.

3215
02:47:41,080 --> 02:47:42,080
You're the same guy who sent us the email.

3216
02:47:42,080 --> 02:47:43,080
We didn't get the website.

3217
02:47:43,080 --> 02:47:44,080
What is it?

3218
02:47:44,080 --> 02:47:45,080
It's retrouprising.com.

3219
02:47:45,080 --> 02:47:48,840
Now, is this going to install porn bots on my computer?

3220
02:47:48,840 --> 02:47:54,800
Because you know how some of these emulation sites carry porn bots.

3221
02:47:54,800 --> 02:47:59,760
And you know, one minute I'm playing Super Mario Brothers and the next minute, vagina!

3222
02:47:59,760 --> 02:48:02,400
No, I've tested out some of this stuff.

3223
02:48:02,400 --> 02:48:04,400
A lot of it works.

3224
02:48:04,400 --> 02:48:05,400
Extensively?

3225
02:48:05,400 --> 02:48:06,400
Yeah.

3226
02:48:06,400 --> 02:48:07,400
Okay.

3227
02:48:07,400 --> 02:48:08,400
Just checking.

3228
02:48:08,400 --> 02:48:14,480
Well, what retro games have you rediscovered through the website?

3229
02:48:14,480 --> 02:48:19,840
Well, they have stuff like Ice Climber, Donkey Kong, stuff like that.

3230
02:48:19,840 --> 02:48:25,600
But some of the Super Nintendo games, you actually have to have an emulator, I believe,

3231
02:48:25,600 --> 02:48:30,880
which unfortunately I do not have.

3232
02:48:30,880 --> 02:48:33,880
But you have the internet one, right?

3233
02:48:33,880 --> 02:48:34,880
Through the website?

3234
02:48:34,880 --> 02:48:41,840
Well, I'm able to do the, like, the Sega Genesis and the Nintendo Entertainment System games,

3235
02:48:41,840 --> 02:48:47,480
but for some reason it says it has a bar that shows the emulator is loading, then they get

3236
02:48:47,480 --> 02:48:49,520
a black screen.

3237
02:48:49,520 --> 02:48:53,200
Maybe update Java or try a different browser.

3238
02:48:53,200 --> 02:48:54,200
I don't know.

3239
02:48:54,200 --> 02:48:55,640
That's what I would do.

3240
02:48:55,640 --> 02:48:58,600
Or it's installing vagina all over your computer.

3241
02:48:58,600 --> 02:48:59,600
That could be what's happening.

3242
02:48:59,600 --> 02:49:02,840
I'm just saying, you've got to be very careful about some of these websites.

3243
02:49:02,840 --> 02:49:04,600
You've got an infestation of vagina.

3244
02:49:04,600 --> 02:49:05,600
That's right.

3245
02:49:05,600 --> 02:49:10,960
But yeah, I'll probably get the NES controller and use that to play some of those NES games,

3246
02:49:10,960 --> 02:49:11,960
which are pretty awesome.

3247
02:49:11,960 --> 02:49:15,320
Are you going to get one of those NES controllers that's like just a USB?

3248
02:49:15,320 --> 02:49:16,320
Yeah.

3249
02:49:16,320 --> 02:49:17,320
Gotcha.

3250
02:49:17,320 --> 02:49:18,320
All right.

3251
02:49:18,320 --> 02:49:19,320
Very cool.

3252
02:49:19,320 --> 02:49:20,320
All right.

3253
02:49:20,320 --> 02:49:23,320
Well, any other thoughts before we let you go?

3254
02:49:23,320 --> 02:49:24,320
Hmm.

3255
02:49:24,320 --> 02:49:29,320
Well, I hope you guys continue doing what you're doing for quite a while.

3256
02:49:29,320 --> 02:49:38,720
You guys keep all of us entertaining, me included, and just history of good health and so forth

3257
02:49:38,720 --> 02:49:40,360
and so on, et cetera, et cetera.

3258
02:49:40,360 --> 02:49:41,360
That's pretty much it.

3259
02:49:41,360 --> 02:49:42,960
Well, we appreciate it.

3260
02:49:42,960 --> 02:49:45,640
It's kind comments like that that keep us going because, you know, we don't make any

3261
02:49:45,640 --> 02:49:46,680
money off this show.

3262
02:49:46,680 --> 02:49:49,400
That's why I have to have rich friends.

3263
02:49:49,400 --> 02:49:50,400
All right.

3264
02:49:50,400 --> 02:49:51,400
Have a good one.

3265
02:49:51,400 --> 02:49:52,400
Yeah, you too.

3266
02:49:52,400 --> 02:49:53,400
Later.

3267
02:49:53,400 --> 02:49:54,400
Bye.

3268
02:49:54,400 --> 02:49:55,400
Bye.

3269
02:49:55,400 --> 02:49:57,280
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.

3270
02:49:57,280 --> 02:50:04,000
Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.

3271
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,600
Meanwhile, more Twitter topics.

3272
02:50:06,600 --> 02:50:12,280
Tigerclaw always sending us a few stories that we may have overlooked.

3273
02:50:12,280 --> 02:50:14,360
Tigerclaw on Twitter tweets us this.

3274
02:50:14,360 --> 02:50:19,520
Apple removes several iOS copycat games from one offending developer.

3275
02:50:19,520 --> 02:50:23,480
So finally, this is funny that all the stuff we were talking about last week about the

3276
02:50:23,480 --> 02:50:29,120
whole copycat crap is starting to kind of come to light, and Apple's taken action against

3277
02:50:29,120 --> 02:50:30,120
some of it.

3278
02:50:30,120 --> 02:50:31,120
Let's see.

3279
02:50:31,120 --> 02:50:35,000
A blow is, again, I'm reading this story for the first time because Tigerclaw sent it to

3280
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:36,000
us.

3281
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:37,000
It's from Gamasutra.

3282
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:41,020
It says, Apple struck a blow against video game clones today by removing several offending

3283
02:50:41,020 --> 02:50:44,560
apps from one rather prolific independent developer.

3284
02:50:44,560 --> 02:50:53,360
The games were Plant vs. Zombie, as in the one plant against one zombie, Angry Ninja

3285
02:50:53,360 --> 02:51:00,060
Birds, and Temple Jump, which is a knockoff of a game called Temple Run, which is funny

3286
02:51:00,060 --> 02:51:04,720
because Temple Jump actually was having some success on the app store, and yeah, we actually

3287
02:51:04,720 --> 02:51:07,740
got all the way to the top of the paid app chart.

3288
02:51:07,740 --> 02:51:12,940
The independent developer of the games, Anton Sinakov, and according to a Twitter post from

3289
02:51:12,940 --> 02:51:19,580
another iOS developer, this developer had 68 iOS apps available this morning, and now

3290
02:51:19,580 --> 02:51:21,680
only nine remain.

3291
02:51:21,680 --> 02:51:22,920
Wow.

3292
02:51:22,920 --> 02:51:25,980
Let's see.

3293
02:51:25,980 --> 02:51:32,680
One of the developers who was copied in this case, Imangi, says, we were really happy with

3294
02:51:32,680 --> 02:51:37,200
how quickly Apple responded to the situation and removed Temple Jump.

3295
02:51:37,200 --> 02:51:42,440
The app was clearly a scam that traded entirely on the popularity of Temple Run and was packaged

3296
02:51:42,440 --> 02:51:44,160
to confuse users.

3297
02:51:44,160 --> 02:51:45,160
Booyah.

3298
02:51:45,160 --> 02:51:49,560
A mole cart's gone now, right?

3299
02:51:49,560 --> 02:51:53,200
Now my question is, when are they going to start taking down the Zynga games?

3300
02:51:53,200 --> 02:51:54,200
Probably never.

3301
02:51:54,200 --> 02:51:56,160
But anyway, we're getting another call, so let's go to the phones.

3302
02:51:56,160 --> 02:51:57,600
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

3303
02:51:57,600 --> 02:51:58,600
Who's this?

3304
02:51:58,600 --> 02:51:59,600
Tesler.

3305
02:51:59,600 --> 02:52:05,600
Log in and play.

3306
02:52:05,600 --> 02:52:09,700
Are you calling to harass me to get me to come play WoW when I'm trying to do a show

3307
02:52:09,700 --> 02:52:11,700
on the internets?

3308
02:52:11,700 --> 02:52:13,820
Maybe.

3309
02:52:13,820 --> 02:52:18,080
Who told you how to find my show?

3310
02:52:18,080 --> 02:52:21,920
I don't even have to ask.

3311
02:52:21,920 --> 02:52:22,920
Let me ask you some questions.

3312
02:52:22,920 --> 02:52:25,080
Well, first off, introduce yourself to the listeners.

3313
02:52:25,080 --> 02:52:26,840
Who am I speaking with?

3314
02:52:26,840 --> 02:52:27,840
All right.

3315
02:52:27,840 --> 02:52:34,760
So for all four of you out there who are listening, this is Mel Dool, and I play with your gracious

3316
02:52:34,760 --> 02:52:37,560
host on a game called World of Warcraft.

3317
02:52:37,560 --> 02:52:41,680
So Dark Soccer, this is one of the people that's in that guild I joined over on Proudmoore's

3318
02:52:41,680 --> 02:52:42,680
server.

3319
02:52:42,680 --> 02:52:43,680
You mean the one that I'm in?

3320
02:52:43,680 --> 02:52:44,680
Yes.

3321
02:52:44,680 --> 02:52:45,680
Now?

3322
02:52:45,680 --> 02:52:46,680
Yeah, you just joined not that long ago.

3323
02:52:46,680 --> 02:52:47,680
Yeah.

3324
02:52:47,680 --> 02:52:48,680
Hi.

3325
02:52:48,680 --> 02:52:49,680
So he's calling to harass me.

3326
02:52:49,680 --> 02:52:50,680
Hey, what's going on?

3327
02:52:50,680 --> 02:52:51,680
He says that instead of doing the show, I should be playing WoW with him.

3328
02:52:51,680 --> 02:52:53,680
The show that I've been doing for 10 years.

3329
02:52:53,680 --> 02:52:54,680
Do you need Dungeons Run?

3330
02:52:54,680 --> 02:52:55,680
Do you need Valor Points?

3331
02:52:55,680 --> 02:52:58,680
Do you need LFR?

3332
02:52:58,680 --> 02:53:02,160
I need all those things and a port.

3333
02:53:02,160 --> 02:53:03,160
You need a port.

3334
02:53:03,160 --> 02:53:04,880
He needs a port.

3335
02:53:04,880 --> 02:53:05,880
So I have to sign in.

3336
02:53:05,880 --> 02:53:07,480
Welcome to my life.

3337
02:53:07,480 --> 02:53:08,480
I know.

3338
02:53:08,480 --> 02:53:09,480
Because this is the funny thing.

3339
02:53:09,480 --> 02:53:14,680
Dark Sakura plays an Arcane Mage on Alliance side, and now I have this Arcane Mage on Horde.

3340
02:53:14,680 --> 02:53:15,680
Port please.

3341
02:53:15,680 --> 02:53:16,680
Port please.

3342
02:53:16,680 --> 02:53:17,680
Right?

3343
02:53:17,680 --> 02:53:18,680
5G.

3344
02:53:18,680 --> 02:53:19,680
Right?

3345
02:53:19,680 --> 02:53:20,680
Well, I'll do that since that's like what?

3346
02:53:20,680 --> 02:53:21,680
500% inflation?

3347
02:53:21,680 --> 02:53:22,680
Exactly.

3348
02:53:22,680 --> 02:53:25,840
But now I've learned after your story earlier this evening, I'll never get paid for it.

3349
02:53:25,840 --> 02:53:28,920
People will just swindle me like you did that poor death knight.

3350
02:53:28,920 --> 02:53:31,160
No, you make them pay you and then you open the portal.

3351
02:53:31,160 --> 02:53:32,160
I see.

3352
02:53:32,160 --> 02:53:33,160
Alright.

3353
02:53:33,160 --> 02:53:34,160
Exactly.

3354
02:53:34,160 --> 02:53:37,960
Well, look, Meladoul, do you play any other video games besides WoW?

3355
02:53:37,960 --> 02:53:44,120
I, I, oh wait, I gotta turn myself down here because I can hear myself talking.

3356
02:53:44,120 --> 02:53:47,040
Yeah, it's always a little awkward, especially when there's a huge delay.

3357
02:53:47,040 --> 02:53:48,040
Right.

3358
02:53:48,040 --> 02:53:51,360
Even though I do sound pretty good on the radio, maybe I should have my own radio show.

3359
02:53:51,360 --> 02:53:52,360
Me too.

3360
02:53:52,360 --> 02:53:53,360
Me too.

3361
02:53:53,360 --> 02:53:54,800
That's why I've been doing this so long is I sound great on the radio.

3362
02:53:54,800 --> 02:53:56,400
I'm just like listening to himself talk.

3363
02:53:56,400 --> 02:53:57,400
I do.

3364
02:53:57,400 --> 02:53:58,400
I do.

3365
02:53:58,400 --> 02:54:02,800
Well, hey, at the risk of like completely losing all of my sex life by, by admitting

3366
02:54:02,800 --> 02:54:09,000
these things, um, I will admit to playing a little Final Fantasy, uh, here and there.

3367
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,120
And, uh, I, what else do I play?

3368
02:54:11,120 --> 02:54:17,400
I was a huge, huge EverQuest gamer for a long time before that, uh, the time.

3369
02:54:17,400 --> 02:54:18,400
Oh, gosh, EverQuest.

3370
02:54:18,400 --> 02:54:21,000
That, that's, that's a lot of geek points right there.

3371
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,640
RIP EverQuest, RIP.

3372
02:54:23,640 --> 02:54:26,760
Which Final Fantasy, which Final Fantasy, because there's a lot of them.

3373
02:54:26,760 --> 02:54:31,520
There's one through 13 and now there's 13, two and 10, two and zero.

3374
02:54:31,520 --> 02:54:34,280
I don't even know how to count that high in Roman numerals.

3375
02:54:34,280 --> 02:54:40,280
Like I'm just like Final Fantasy X, X, X porn, X, I.

3376
02:54:40,280 --> 02:54:43,440
There actually was a Final Fuck X in Japan.

3377
02:54:43,440 --> 02:54:44,440
Perfect.

3378
02:54:44,440 --> 02:54:45,440
I have this.

3379
02:54:45,440 --> 02:54:46,620
I can play that.

3380
02:54:46,620 --> 02:54:48,520
It's basically just bad cosplay boinging.

3381
02:54:48,520 --> 02:54:49,520
Yeah.

3382
02:54:49,520 --> 02:54:52,280
It's basically just chicks dressed up as the characters in Final Fantasy 10 and they get

3383
02:54:52,280 --> 02:54:53,280
fucked.

3384
02:54:53,280 --> 02:54:58,280
And the weird thing about Japanese porn is that they have to blur the penetration.

3385
02:54:58,280 --> 02:54:59,280
So yeah.

3386
02:54:59,280 --> 02:55:00,280
Yeah.

3387
02:55:00,280 --> 02:55:01,640
And then the guys aren't dressed up.

3388
02:55:01,640 --> 02:55:03,800
The guys are just like, Hey, I'm here to fuck Yuna.

3389
02:55:03,800 --> 02:55:04,800
Okay.

3390
02:55:04,800 --> 02:55:08,560
Well see, you gotta be careful because you could, if you're not, if you don't blur it,

3391
02:55:08,560 --> 02:55:11,280
you could have an infestation of vagina.

3392
02:55:11,280 --> 02:55:12,280
That's true.

3393
02:55:12,280 --> 02:55:13,280
That's true.

3394
02:55:13,280 --> 02:55:14,280
Just like the last caller.

3395
02:55:14,280 --> 02:55:16,240
If you're on a bad website, you just knock, knock.

3396
02:55:16,240 --> 02:55:17,240
Who's there?

3397
02:55:17,240 --> 02:55:19,560
Too much vagina is never a good thing.

3398
02:55:19,560 --> 02:55:21,560
You want to get moderation.

3399
02:55:21,560 --> 02:55:22,560
Never.

3400
02:55:22,560 --> 02:55:23,560
Never.

3401
02:55:23,560 --> 02:55:24,560
Never.

3402
02:55:24,560 --> 02:55:25,560
So yeah.

3403
02:55:25,560 --> 02:55:26,560
Um, yeah, totally.

3404
02:55:26,560 --> 02:55:29,000
That's, that's, uh, those are the games that I played for a while.

3405
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:30,000
I love tactics.

3406
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:32,160
That was my, that was my big thing.

3407
02:55:32,160 --> 02:55:34,600
Final Fantasy Tactics was a great game.

3408
02:55:34,600 --> 02:55:35,600
It was a great game.

3409
02:55:35,600 --> 02:55:36,600
Final Fantasy Tactics was awesome.

3410
02:55:36,600 --> 02:55:41,840
And then they, what they have the versions on, uh, what systems, uh, Game Boy Advance

3411
02:55:41,840 --> 02:55:44,080
had one and then they ported it.

3412
02:55:44,080 --> 02:55:48,080
Ah, there's another one on, uh, Iniscacy.

3413
02:55:48,080 --> 02:55:49,080
Didn't they make another port?

3414
02:55:49,080 --> 02:55:50,080
It was a PSP.

3415
02:55:50,080 --> 02:55:51,080
It was just a PSP.

3416
02:55:51,080 --> 02:55:52,080
Yeah.

3417
02:55:52,080 --> 02:55:53,080
That was the only one.

3418
02:55:53,080 --> 02:55:54,080
All right.

3419
02:55:54,080 --> 02:56:02,840
Well, I, I, I loved Final Fantasy two with like, you know, the U S version where it was

3420
02:56:02,840 --> 02:56:05,520
like Final Fantasy three or something in Japan.

3421
02:56:05,520 --> 02:56:06,520
They couldn't get it right.

3422
02:56:06,520 --> 02:56:07,520
I don't know.

3423
02:56:07,520 --> 02:56:08,520
Yeah.

3424
02:56:08,520 --> 02:56:09,520
It was, it was awesome.

3425
02:56:09,520 --> 02:56:10,520
But you know what?

3426
02:56:10,520 --> 02:56:13,400
I will, I will stop harassing you and let you get to your radio show.

3427
02:56:13,400 --> 02:56:14,400
All right.

3428
02:56:14,400 --> 02:56:15,400
I appreciate it.

3429
02:56:15,400 --> 02:56:16,400
Totally.

3430
02:56:16,400 --> 02:56:17,400
You know, cut it short.

3431
02:56:17,400 --> 02:56:18,400
I need a port.

3432
02:56:18,400 --> 02:56:19,400
All right.

3433
02:56:19,400 --> 02:56:22,520
Well, you might have to buy one unless you want to wait till about 11 o'clock my time

3434
02:56:22,520 --> 02:56:23,520
when I'll finally sign in.

3435
02:56:23,520 --> 02:56:24,520
Unacceptable.

3436
02:56:24,520 --> 02:56:25,520
All right.

3437
02:56:25,520 --> 02:56:27,520
Have a good one.

3438
02:56:27,520 --> 02:56:31,400
And I'm really sorry that now you're not going to get laid for like six weeks cause you admitted

3439
02:56:31,400 --> 02:56:32,400
things on air.

3440
02:56:32,400 --> 02:56:33,400
All right.

3441
02:56:33,400 --> 02:56:35,400
I'll talk to you later.

3442
02:56:35,400 --> 02:56:36,400
Bye.

3443
02:56:36,400 --> 02:56:41,040
One eight seven seven Game O L R username on Skype is orange lounge radio.

3444
02:56:41,040 --> 02:56:44,400
It's very, uh, amusing.

3445
02:56:44,400 --> 02:56:45,400
Don't let it fool you.

3446
02:56:45,400 --> 02:56:46,400
He's a total asshole.

3447
02:56:46,400 --> 02:56:47,400
No, I'm kidding.

3448
02:56:47,400 --> 02:56:48,400
I'm kidding.

3449
02:56:48,400 --> 02:56:52,240
I've really been, I like everybody in that guild so far.

3450
02:56:52,240 --> 02:56:54,400
We've been pretty, pretty nice people.

3451
02:56:54,400 --> 02:56:56,040
You know, I have that Shane guy.

3452
02:56:56,040 --> 02:56:58,440
Yeah, he's an ass.

3453
02:56:58,440 --> 02:57:03,280
But the first, the first, like I joined that guild because I knew that they were doing

3454
02:57:03,280 --> 02:57:06,480
some rating and that they were just starting and I was like, all right, well, you know,

3455
02:57:06,480 --> 02:57:07,480
cause nothing's happening on Alliance.

3456
02:57:07,480 --> 02:57:08,480
Why not?

3457
02:57:08,480 --> 02:57:10,000
I'm going to try this to work out my heart.

3458
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:15,120
The first night I went on the raid with the group, I was like, this might be a bit of

3459
02:57:15,120 --> 02:57:16,120
a hot mess.

3460
02:57:16,120 --> 02:57:17,120
I don't know.

3461
02:57:17,120 --> 02:57:21,560
But, um, you know, the next week actually we, we rated again last and it was, it was

3462
02:57:21,560 --> 02:57:22,560
really good.

3463
02:57:22,560 --> 02:57:25,720
And I think like, you know, they made some tweaks to the group and it really worked and

3464
02:57:25,720 --> 02:57:27,360
we cleared like five bosses in one night.

3465
02:57:27,360 --> 02:57:28,360
So it's a good time.

3466
02:57:28,360 --> 02:57:29,360
On Firelands?

3467
02:57:29,360 --> 02:57:30,360
Uh, no, the new one.

3468
02:57:30,360 --> 02:57:31,360
Dragon Soul.

3469
02:57:31,360 --> 02:57:32,360
Oh, the new one, Dragon Soul?

3470
02:57:32,360 --> 02:57:33,360
Yeah.

3471
02:57:33,360 --> 02:57:34,360
I got a new belt.

3472
02:57:34,360 --> 02:57:35,360
Yay.

3473
02:57:35,360 --> 02:57:36,360
Leet loots.

3474
02:57:36,360 --> 02:57:42,640
You know what, I actually got, someone just gave me random kudos for having two tier thirteens

3475
02:57:42,640 --> 02:57:46,440
and two tier twelves because you actually get the bonuses from both sets.

3476
02:57:46,440 --> 02:57:47,440
Right.

3477
02:57:47,440 --> 02:57:48,440
Yeah.

3478
02:57:48,440 --> 02:57:49,960
And it's kind of neat having extra haste with a double.

3479
02:57:49,960 --> 02:57:53,260
I want that on my mage because I have the tier 12 bonus, but anyway, sorry.

3480
02:57:53,260 --> 02:57:56,040
We're getting, this discussion is getting a little too Hoard House, which by the way

3481
02:57:56,040 --> 02:58:00,480
is the other Warcraft show I do sometimes, www.hoardhouse.com.

3482
02:58:00,480 --> 02:58:01,480
I'm going to be honest.

3483
02:58:01,480 --> 02:58:02,520
Let's have some real talk for a minute.

3484
02:58:02,520 --> 02:58:05,680
I don't know when there's going to be another episode of Hoard House because like Extifer

3485
02:58:05,680 --> 02:58:10,320
is now like busy on the weekends all the time because I don't, I don't know if I should

3486
02:58:10,320 --> 02:58:14,600
say this, but he's seen, he's got an infestation of a giant.

3487
02:58:14,600 --> 02:58:20,400
He hasn't, he hasn't, we'll put it that way, Extifer has an infestation of a vagina all

3488
02:58:20,400 --> 02:58:21,400
week.

3489
02:58:21,400 --> 02:58:24,040
No, he's, he's, he's seeing a boy and I met the boy the other night and he's really cool.

3490
02:58:24,040 --> 02:58:28,440
So I don't want to, you know, so you know, I don't know what's going to happen.

3491
02:58:28,440 --> 02:58:30,800
So it's going to be really hard for us to kind of like coordinate our schedules and

3492
02:58:30,800 --> 02:58:31,800
so forth.

3493
02:58:31,800 --> 02:58:33,200
And plus he's not playing wow.

3494
02:58:33,200 --> 02:58:36,000
So I know.

3495
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:38,760
So we have to get guests that can fill in the gaps and so forth.

3496
02:58:38,760 --> 02:58:41,280
I'll be more than happy to fill in if you want to record.

3497
02:58:41,280 --> 02:58:42,280
I know.

3498
02:58:42,280 --> 02:58:43,280
I know.

3499
02:58:43,280 --> 02:58:45,600
I don't know what's going to happen now, but it's just, don't expect Horde House every

3500
02:58:45,600 --> 02:58:48,720
week sadly until we get some of this stuff worked out.

3501
02:58:48,720 --> 02:58:52,960
So especially like a common, uh, date and time and all that.

3502
02:58:52,960 --> 02:58:54,400
All right.

3503
02:58:54,400 --> 02:58:57,480
Tiger Claw in chat says, I bet Rob is strict and mean in the Guild.

3504
02:58:57,480 --> 02:59:00,800
When someone underperforms, he'll yell at them like a drill Sergeant.

3505
02:59:00,800 --> 02:59:04,520
I don't yell.

3506
02:59:04,520 --> 02:59:06,660
What are you doing going to that side?

3507
02:59:06,660 --> 02:59:07,660
We said this one.

3508
02:59:07,660 --> 02:59:08,660
No, that's not Rob.

3509
02:59:08,660 --> 02:59:09,660
No, I don't really do that.

3510
02:59:09,660 --> 02:59:14,320
I do, I've, I like to think I'm fair and I'm nice and I'm patient.

3511
02:59:14,320 --> 02:59:16,840
I'm very fucking patient.

3512
02:59:16,840 --> 02:59:21,840
But like I hit the, I get to these moments where I fucking snap.

3513
02:59:21,840 --> 02:59:23,760
This is what Rob sounds like.

3514
02:59:23,760 --> 02:59:29,840
Like I'm going to do the, uh, what was the, the boss in black rock?

3515
02:59:29,840 --> 02:59:30,840
The Faryon.

3516
02:59:30,840 --> 02:59:31,840
Faryon.

3517
02:59:31,840 --> 02:59:32,840
This is Rob on the Faryon.

3518
02:59:32,840 --> 02:59:33,840
Okay.

3519
02:59:33,840 --> 02:59:34,840
Get to the platform.

3520
02:59:34,840 --> 02:59:35,840
Okay.

3521
02:59:35,840 --> 02:59:36,840
Don't forget to interrupt.

3522
02:59:36,840 --> 02:59:37,840
You interrupt.

3523
02:59:37,840 --> 02:59:38,840
You interrupt.

3524
02:59:38,840 --> 02:59:39,840
Are you healing?

3525
02:59:39,840 --> 02:59:40,840
What happened?

3526
02:59:40,840 --> 02:59:41,840
Or what happened to your mana?

3527
02:59:41,840 --> 02:59:44,160
Are you healing?

3528
02:59:44,160 --> 02:59:45,160
What was that?

3529
02:59:45,160 --> 02:59:46,160
Why did we wipe?

3530
02:59:46,160 --> 02:59:47,160
Okay.

3531
02:59:47,160 --> 02:59:48,160
I think we wiped because this, this, this, and this.

3532
02:59:48,160 --> 02:59:49,160
All right.

3533
02:59:49,160 --> 02:59:50,160
Let's try it again.

3534
02:59:50,160 --> 02:59:51,160
Get to the platform.

3535
02:59:51,160 --> 02:59:52,160
That's Rob.

3536
02:59:52,160 --> 02:59:55,920
A little bit, a little bit.

3537
02:59:55,920 --> 02:59:56,920
All right.

3538
02:59:56,920 --> 03:00:03,880
Uh, let's see another story here from the Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R. Tiger Claw

3539
03:00:03,880 --> 03:00:05,960
sends us this link.

3540
03:00:05,960 --> 03:00:10,000
Nintendo zone to feature full episodes of Pokemon.

3541
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:11,000
Yay.

3542
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:16,720
3DS owners get free wifi access at 29,000 Nintendo zone locations.

3543
03:00:16,720 --> 03:00:18,720
Oh, that's that new channel on my 3DS.

3544
03:00:18,720 --> 03:00:20,960
I can't figure out what it's used for.

3545
03:00:20,960 --> 03:00:26,000
Um, Nintendo zone will offer much more content for 3DS owners.

3546
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:29,920
There will be a dedicated Pokemon section that will feature full length episodes of

3547
03:00:29,920 --> 03:00:32,320
the Pokemon TV series.

3548
03:00:32,320 --> 03:00:36,120
And uh, yeah, McDonald's or Starbucks are both Nintendo zone partners.

3549
03:00:36,120 --> 03:00:39,760
That's actually kind of cool, especially if I can get like old school Pokemon episodes.

3550
03:00:39,760 --> 03:00:43,160
Like remember when I had all those Pokemon DVDs, I still do have some of them up there.

3551
03:00:43,160 --> 03:00:44,160
I know.

3552
03:00:44,160 --> 03:00:45,160
Oh, you know what?

3553
03:00:45,160 --> 03:00:46,160
I have Rob.

3554
03:00:46,160 --> 03:00:47,160
What?

3555
03:00:47,160 --> 03:00:56,040
Japanese Digimon DVDs for the record, O L R has a one in three occurrence of vagina.

3556
03:00:56,040 --> 03:00:58,680
Ah, all right.

3557
03:00:58,680 --> 03:01:02,000
Oh, well our Skype line unfortunately isn't ringing anymore.

3558
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:03,000
I guess.

3559
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:10,360
Uh, I guess I guess people just wanted to call and yell at me or talk about old games.

3560
03:01:10,360 --> 03:01:11,360
So that's all right.

3561
03:01:11,360 --> 03:01:12,760
They've come down with the case.

3562
03:01:12,760 --> 03:01:14,880
Our usual callers are at their Superbowl parties.

3563
03:01:14,880 --> 03:01:15,880
It's fine.

3564
03:01:15,880 --> 03:01:16,880
I understand.

3565
03:01:16,880 --> 03:01:19,820
Hey, look, he joined the chat room.

3566
03:01:19,820 --> 03:01:22,080
It's the artist behind every little step.

3567
03:01:22,080 --> 03:01:25,880
Bobby Blackpool speaking of the Superbowl.

3568
03:01:25,880 --> 03:01:26,880
All right.

3569
03:01:26,880 --> 03:01:27,880
Oh, sorry.

3570
03:01:27,880 --> 03:01:28,880
It's super bowels.

3571
03:01:28,880 --> 03:01:29,880
We're going to wrap it up.

3572
03:01:29,880 --> 03:01:30,880
We're getting out of here.

3573
03:01:30,880 --> 03:01:32,480
We're getting out of here for the night.

3574
03:01:32,480 --> 03:01:34,040
Last minute stories.

3575
03:01:34,040 --> 03:01:36,920
Loki, do you have anything you want to share for last minute stories?

3576
03:01:36,920 --> 03:01:42,040
Uh, just one small thing that I noticed that Joyce had posted a little thing about this

3577
03:01:42,040 --> 03:01:43,280
game.

3578
03:01:43,280 --> 03:01:45,120
It's a free indie game.

3579
03:01:45,120 --> 03:01:51,720
Um, and it's a really oddly named game called the cat that got milk or the cat that got

3580
03:01:51,720 --> 03:01:53,800
the milk.

3581
03:01:53,800 --> 03:01:58,040
Not necessarily what it sounds like, but it's a, it's a free game.

3582
03:01:58,040 --> 03:01:59,040
Go check it out.

3583
03:01:59,040 --> 03:02:05,920
Um, it's a pretty short, only 10, 15 minutes, but it's a, the cat that got the milk.com

3584
03:02:05,920 --> 03:02:13,600
and um, it looks pretty awesome based on the trailer.

3585
03:02:13,600 --> 03:02:14,720
All right.

3586
03:02:14,720 --> 03:02:16,640
Let's go around and wrap up the show.

3587
03:02:16,640 --> 03:02:17,840
We're at the end of the show.

3588
03:02:17,840 --> 03:02:18,840
We've done all the stories.

3589
03:02:18,840 --> 03:02:19,840
We've done all the calls.

3590
03:02:19,840 --> 03:02:20,840
We've done all the news.

3591
03:02:20,840 --> 03:02:22,280
We're time to wrap it up.

3592
03:02:22,280 --> 03:02:24,440
So, um, Dark Sakura, we'll start with you.

3593
03:02:24,440 --> 03:02:26,280
Your final thought tonight?

3594
03:02:26,280 --> 03:02:27,960
Vagina.

3595
03:02:27,960 --> 03:02:28,960
How lovely.

3596
03:02:28,960 --> 03:02:29,960
Loki.

3597
03:02:29,960 --> 03:02:30,960
Your final thought tonight?

3598
03:02:30,960 --> 03:02:36,000
Uh, the character that I was talking about earlier at Soul Calibur five is Lord Geo Dom

3599
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:39,900
Pierre, which was a pre-order bonus at Best Buy.

3600
03:02:39,900 --> 03:02:44,400
My final thought is Jigglypuff.

3601
03:02:44,400 --> 03:02:46,800
That's going to do it guys for another episode of orange launch radio.

3602
03:02:46,800 --> 03:02:49,600
Thank you guys so much for downloading and listening to our show.

3603
03:02:49,600 --> 03:02:52,480
Even if it was just to yell at me that you needed a port somewhere.

3604
03:02:52,480 --> 03:02:55,080
Um, we're going to do this all again next week.

3605
03:02:55,080 --> 03:02:58,160
You know what we ask if you've enjoyed what you hear here at orange launch radio.

3606
03:02:58,160 --> 03:03:02,600
Remember, we don't have a big magazine backing us with millions of dollars.

3607
03:03:02,600 --> 03:03:04,200
We don't have all these ads and stuff.

3608
03:03:04,200 --> 03:03:06,440
You know, all we ask, tell a friend about the show.

3609
03:03:06,440 --> 03:03:10,620
Help spread the word of orange lounge radio and we'll come back to do it all again next

3610
03:03:10,620 --> 03:03:11,620
week.

3611
03:03:11,620 --> 03:03:14,860
So, uh, next week I'm hoping to talk a little more in depth about Soul Calibur five after

3612
03:03:14,860 --> 03:03:16,580
I get some more hands on time with it.

3613
03:03:16,580 --> 03:03:18,460
I don't know what my co-host will be playing.

3614
03:03:18,460 --> 03:03:19,460
Hands on.

3615
03:03:19,460 --> 03:03:22,120
Maybe get some time in with Evita if I know anyone that gets one early.

3616
03:03:22,120 --> 03:03:23,120
We'll see.

3617
03:03:23,120 --> 03:03:24,480
I'll have to go find my rich friends.

3618
03:03:24,480 --> 03:03:26,600
But until then, that's going to do it.

3619
03:03:26,600 --> 03:03:30,440
Myself, Dark Soccer and Loki saying, good night.

3620
03:03:30,440 --> 03:03:34,960
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.

3621
03:03:34,960 --> 03:03:44,160
Orange lounge radio is an orange lounge production to join us for a live show visit www.allgames.com

3622
03:03:44,160 --> 03:03:50,360
Sunday nights at 6pm pacific time the views and opinions expressed on orange lounge radio

3623
03:03:50,360 --> 03:03:57,160
do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of orange lounge radio or allgames.com

3624
03:03:57,160 --> 03:04:25,200
but we're probably right anyway see you next week.
