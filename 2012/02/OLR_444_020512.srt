1
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:15,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Tonight, February 5th, 2012.

2
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,992
[SPEAKER_10]: Could mature video games soon carry an extra sales tax?

3
00:00:20,432 --> 00:00:25,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Game Gear games are spotted for the 3DS, and a creation kit is set to come for Skyrim.

4
00:00:32,335 --> 00:00:40,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:40,838 --> 00:00:47,521
[SPEAKER_08]: It is episode number 444, that's three fours, not four fours, for this February the 5th of 2012.

6
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:58,907
[SPEAKER_08]: We are live as we are every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, where we tape live, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

7
00:00:58,947 --> 00:00:59,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Although not tonight.

8
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:00,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby had the night off.

9
00:01:00,548 --> 00:01:01,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Something about a superb owl.

10
00:01:02,089 --> 00:01:04,370
[SPEAKER_08]: He was a superb owl or something he was doing.

11
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,672
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought he had to do a stupor or something.

12
00:01:07,052 --> 00:01:07,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Something like that.

13
00:01:07,592 --> 00:01:11,835
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, my name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host.

14
00:01:11,995 --> 00:01:15,136
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, you already heard her, but it's Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

15
00:01:15,236 --> 00:01:16,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe it was Super Bowels.

16
00:01:17,298 --> 00:01:17,718
Ha ha ha!

17
00:01:18,098 --> 00:01:18,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that was it.

18
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:19,659
[SPEAKER_08]: It might have been.

19
00:01:19,699 --> 00:01:20,060
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

20
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:20,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Something like that.

21
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, say hello, of course, to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

22
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:24,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

23
00:01:25,063 --> 00:01:25,703
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you, Loki?

24
00:01:25,863 --> 00:01:26,344
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm fine.

25
00:01:26,624 --> 00:01:32,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, there's like a game that a lot of the live listeners like to play on the show, and that is, you know, where did Loki get his food tonight?

26
00:01:32,568 --> 00:01:38,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you like to go to like fast food restaurants or you go to, you know, whatever restaurant you take out and you bring it to the show to munch on air.

27
00:01:38,172 --> 00:01:39,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, we do this show at dinnertime.

28
00:01:40,153 --> 00:01:40,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

29
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,855
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we don't eat before or after, we're kind of screwed.

30
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:45,297
[SPEAKER_08]: So but you went to two restaurants tonight, right?

31
00:01:45,317 --> 00:01:45,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

32
00:01:45,777 --> 00:01:50,161
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to KFC and got some honey barbecue wings, and then I went to McDonald's and got some fries.

33
00:01:51,742 --> 00:01:54,764
[SPEAKER_08]: So you had wings and fries for this superb owl day.

34
00:01:55,025 --> 00:01:55,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

35
00:01:55,425 --> 00:01:55,725
[SPEAKER_08]: I see.

36
00:01:56,226 --> 00:01:57,086
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very appropriate.

37
00:01:57,106 --> 00:02:09,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I wanted to go to someplace else other than fast food, but the teriyaki place nearby closed, and the fish and chips place nearby, they're closed today.

38
00:02:10,157 --> 00:02:13,219
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just like all the other places are closed.

39
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:15,281
[SPEAKER_09]: I got one at the Quiznos, I guess, but eh.

40
00:02:15,843 --> 00:02:16,143
[SPEAKER_08]: I got food too

41
00:02:43,089 --> 00:02:44,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Where'd you get food from tonight?

42
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:44,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Whole Foods.

43
00:02:46,293 --> 00:02:47,474
[SPEAKER_08]: How healthy?

44
00:02:47,775 --> 00:02:48,716
[SPEAKER_08]: You damn dirty hippie?

45
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, it was delicious.

46
00:02:50,578 --> 00:02:51,399
[SPEAKER_05]: And it had grapes in it.

47
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:54,230
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so obviously Pink Elephant in the room.

48
00:02:54,290 --> 00:03:09,596
[SPEAKER_08]: We are live on a night where usually there's not a lot of stuff going on anywhere, not on TV, not anywhere, unless you're, you know, the network that's carrying the Super Bowl, because we are up against... I was going to say, I did hear something big happen today, and that was Madonna said, fuck you to everybody.

49
00:03:09,896 --> 00:03:11,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that was MIA, I guess.

50
00:03:11,436 --> 00:03:12,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, MIA?

51
00:03:12,077 --> 00:03:14,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because she had her whole little entourage with her.

52
00:03:14,358 --> 00:03:15,158
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Madonna, you know...

53
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:17,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we take like five seconds to judge Madonna?

54
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:18,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, go ahead.

55
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:36,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm done.

56
00:03:37,132 --> 00:03:45,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to join us live in our chat room and talk along with the program and all that good stuff.

57
00:03:45,557 --> 00:03:50,741
[SPEAKER_08]: So I got to say, look, look, I don't want to keep ragging on Madonna because I do love Madonna.

58
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:52,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, no, seriously, I'm gay.

59
00:03:52,462 --> 00:03:53,463
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to love Madonna.

60
00:03:53,503 --> 00:03:55,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it's like a requirement.

61
00:03:55,324 --> 00:03:56,245
[SPEAKER_08]: She was pre-Gaga.

62
00:03:56,425 --> 00:03:57,185
[SPEAKER_08]: She's been slipping.

63
00:03:57,525 --> 00:04:00,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I don't even want to make a Madonna Gaga thing.

64
00:04:00,147 --> 00:04:01,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, that's not a thing.

65
00:04:01,148 --> 00:04:02,429
[SPEAKER_08]: People need to stop making that a thing.

66
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:03,089
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a thing.

67
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,551
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an evolution of styles.

68
00:04:06,392 --> 00:04:07,533
[SPEAKER_08]: What's an evolution of music?

69
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:08,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

70
00:04:08,173 --> 00:04:10,235
[SPEAKER_05]: It was clearly an influence.

71
00:04:10,795 --> 00:04:11,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the thing about Madonna.

72
00:04:12,317 --> 00:04:13,158
[SPEAKER_08]: She's kind of slipping.

73
00:04:13,298 --> 00:04:16,641
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know what it is, but that new song, not good.

74
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:18,242
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not good.

75
00:04:18,963 --> 00:04:19,423
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway.

76
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:24,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Was there ever a Madonna video game trying to get back on topic?

77
00:04:24,688 --> 00:04:25,509
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think there was.

78
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't Ray of Light in something?

79
00:04:28,734 --> 00:04:30,255
[SPEAKER_08]: It might have been like in a dance game.

80
00:04:30,315 --> 00:04:30,635
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

81
00:04:31,076 --> 00:04:31,316
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

82
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:36,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, we do, of course, always invite our live chatters at chat.orangelounge.com.

83
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:40,781
[SPEAKER_08]: However, we do ask the live chatters, don't talk about the Super Bowl in the chat room.

84
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:51,928
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not that we want to like censor you or, you know, but it's just as I'm trying to look through chat room and read comments that are relevant to the show, I don't need to see a bunch of like woo giants, woo patriots, blah, blah, blah, you know, whatever going on in there.

85
00:04:51,988 --> 00:04:52,448
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.

86
00:04:52,848 --> 00:04:54,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Try to keep the Super Bowl chat out.

87
00:04:54,589 --> 00:04:56,431
[SPEAKER_08]: However, Puppy Bowl chat is just fine.

88
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:58,572
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to talk about the Puppy Bowl, we'll deal with that.

89
00:04:58,592 --> 00:05:02,635
[SPEAKER_05]: What about that cute little lab that was drinking from the bowl when we were watching?

90
00:05:02,695 --> 00:05:05,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this year's Puppy Bowl was all about fumble.

91
00:05:05,717 --> 00:05:06,438
[SPEAKER_08]: It seemed like.

92
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:07,859
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole time was fumble.

93
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,620
[SPEAKER_08]: But I was a big fan of Oscar the Dashun.

94
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy birthday, Tiger Claw.

95
00:05:12,382 --> 00:05:12,842
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

96
00:05:12,882 --> 00:05:14,123
[SPEAKER_08]: It is Tiger Claw's birthday.

97
00:05:14,524 --> 00:05:17,366
[SPEAKER_08]: We should take a minute to acknowledge Tiger Claw because he does a lot.

98
00:05:17,606 --> 00:05:20,548
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the network that we're on, allgames.com, like...

99
00:05:22,344 --> 00:05:23,564
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

100
00:05:43,712 --> 00:05:44,473
[SPEAKER_08]: He's the P.A.

101
00:06:02,543 --> 00:06:04,304
[SPEAKER_05]: The personal assistant to director.

102
00:06:04,404 --> 00:06:04,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

103
00:06:04,725 --> 00:06:06,546
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's the one that actually gets the stuff done.

104
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:07,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

105
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,588
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a very good way of putting it.

106
00:06:09,628 --> 00:06:10,769
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a great way of putting it.

107
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:17,614
[SPEAKER_08]: He's the director's assistant or the one that's actually doing all the work because he's, you know, making sure that all the live shows are up.

108
00:06:17,734 --> 00:06:18,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we...

109
00:06:18,835 --> 00:06:19,536
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

110
00:06:38,394 --> 00:06:38,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

111
00:06:38,754 --> 00:06:40,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Because he loves the network.

112
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:43,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Or he's getting money that we don't know about.

113
00:06:43,275 --> 00:06:43,735
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

114
00:06:43,795 --> 00:06:44,816
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's the first one.

115
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:48,357
[SPEAKER_08]: So absolutely a special happy birthday to Tigerclaw.

116
00:06:48,397 --> 00:06:52,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Because without Tigerclaw, I don't know if there'd be a network still going right now.

117
00:06:53,018 --> 00:06:59,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if the power went down, probably people wouldn't notice until the next live broadcaster's like, where's my show?

118
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:04,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know that our buddy Brad from PodCulture just got the first gong of the year?

119
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:04,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-oh.

120
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:05,781
[SPEAKER_08]: What did Brad do?

121
00:07:06,508 --> 00:07:08,630
[SPEAKER_05]: He said he heard the puppy bull just went to the dogs.

122
00:07:10,991 --> 00:07:11,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

123
00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:15,114
[SPEAKER_05]: I went old school and went with the gong instead of the sad trombone.

124
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:16,876
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

125
00:07:18,177 --> 00:07:31,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so I want to start off, since we can't ignore the big sports thing that's going on, I realize most people this week are probably downloading this via the podcast, because I guess it's just an American tradition or something.

126
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:34,629
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you know that Paula Deen was in Sacramento this week?

127
00:07:35,109 --> 00:07:36,650
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

128
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:02,184
[SPEAKER_08]: From what I remember... Her personal hamstache!

129
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:05,607
[SPEAKER_08]: From what I remember of him, him being a big fan of Paula Deen.

130
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:06,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it coated in butter?

131
00:08:06,828 --> 00:08:09,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't he have like a little southern twang, if I remember right?

132
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,133
[SPEAKER_09]: He was a big fan of... Not Paula Deen.

133
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:13,733
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been like years.

134
00:08:13,813 --> 00:08:14,073
[SPEAKER_09]: It was...

135
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:16,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Rachel Ray?

136
00:08:17,135 --> 00:08:18,917
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's a country music star.

137
00:08:19,177 --> 00:08:23,282
[SPEAKER_09]: It's some country female country music star.

138
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:24,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Trisha Yearwood?

139
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:25,304
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

140
00:08:25,384 --> 00:08:26,706
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to think of the five.

141
00:08:27,126 --> 00:08:27,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Shania Twain.

142
00:08:29,329 --> 00:08:31,031
[SPEAKER_08]: Might be Shania Twain.

143
00:08:31,051 --> 00:08:31,671
[SPEAKER_08]: She's Canadian.

144
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though she hasn't been around in about 15 years.

145
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:35,315
[SPEAKER_09]: No, maybe that's not it.

146
00:08:35,435 --> 00:08:35,556
[SPEAKER_09]: It's...

147
00:08:36,854 --> 00:08:37,435
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember.

148
00:08:37,715 --> 00:08:38,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, whatever.

149
00:08:38,175 --> 00:08:38,675
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't matter.

150
00:08:38,835 --> 00:08:39,676
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not important.

151
00:08:40,136 --> 00:08:42,577
[SPEAKER_09]: The important thing is that she looks like she's made of plastic.

152
00:08:42,997 --> 00:08:43,277
Yes.

153
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:46,919
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, I have to tell you the sad thing that happened yesterday.

154
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:47,439
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

155
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Becky and I were at the Crocker Art Museum for Free Museum Day.

156
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:54,783
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were standing next to this younger couple just looking at a picture.

157
00:08:55,263 --> 00:08:57,444
[SPEAKER_05]: And the guy's like, wow, this looks like a Rush album.

158
00:08:57,784 --> 00:08:59,065
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's like, what's Rush?

159
00:08:59,985 --> 00:09:05,188
[SPEAKER_05]: And Becky and I turned around and in unison with her boyfriend said, what's Rush?

160
00:09:05,408 --> 00:09:05,648
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

161
00:09:09,491 --> 00:09:11,853
[SPEAKER_05]: And she looked like she wanted to crawl into a corner and die.

162
00:09:14,015 --> 00:09:17,678
[SPEAKER_08]: At least that didn't happen on 2-1-12 because that would have been a disaster.

163
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:19,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

164
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, can we actually talk about video games?

165
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:22,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

166
00:09:22,101 --> 00:09:22,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe possibly.

167
00:09:22,642 --> 00:09:24,323
[SPEAKER_08]: But I thought that that was worth sharing.

168
00:09:24,443 --> 00:09:24,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

169
00:09:24,924 --> 00:09:25,544
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's fine.

170
00:09:25,604 --> 00:09:26,025
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine.

171
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:29,590
[SPEAKER_08]: I played some Because they're ass Because I hate football

172
00:09:54,244 --> 00:09:57,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't... Personally, I don't hate football.

173
00:09:57,225 --> 00:09:59,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, hate's a strong word, but I don't know.

174
00:09:59,126 --> 00:10:05,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I think I'm just willing to admit I'm not very good at sports games because I'm not very knowledgeable about a lot of the sports.

175
00:10:06,288 --> 00:10:10,009
[SPEAKER_08]: And for me, a lot of these games like Madden and stuff get really, like, detailed and stuff.

176
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:19,832
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I look at all these, like, you know, maps of the X's and O's and things like that... And I'm sure, like, a lot of football fans, I'm going to sound like the biggest idiot in the world right now, but, like, you have to realize there's some people that don't really watch sports, you guys.

177
00:10:20,592 --> 00:10:40,226
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can't really follow a lot of those new sports games But I thought, that doesn't mean I hate all sports games Because that's certainly not true There's some sports games out there I actually really enjoy So I thought we could talk a little bit about sports games that don't suck So DarkSakura, I know you say you hate football But are there any sports games you can think of that you really enjoy?

178
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:49,633
[SPEAKER_05]: The only football game I've ever really enjoyed was Super High Impact on Super Nintendo My brothers and I would play the crap out of that And NBA Jam

179
00:10:52,177 --> 00:10:54,498
[SPEAKER_05]: and NBA Jam.

180
00:10:54,518 --> 00:10:57,600
[SPEAKER_05]: NBA Jam's pretty damn good.

181
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:03,884
[SPEAKER_05]: That skiing game on the PC that I used to scream at that was on the old... No, on the PC.

182
00:11:05,822 --> 00:11:06,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Whiskey.

183
00:11:06,783 --> 00:11:08,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you need to talk into a mic or they can't hear you.

184
00:11:08,884 --> 00:11:09,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Ski Free.

185
00:11:10,485 --> 00:11:10,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Ski Free.

186
00:11:11,085 --> 00:11:12,206
[SPEAKER_05]: That game would piss me off.

187
00:11:12,586 --> 00:11:14,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, actually, I remember one that I really, really liked.

188
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:16,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Alpine Racer.

189
00:11:17,749 --> 00:11:19,710
[SPEAKER_05]: I freaking loved Alpine Racer.

190
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,311
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had one at my arcade.

191
00:11:22,372 --> 00:11:23,472
[SPEAKER_05]: I played the shit out of that.

192
00:11:23,492 --> 00:11:24,333
[SPEAKER_05]: I was super good at it.

193
00:11:25,093 --> 00:11:30,736
[SPEAKER_05]: And I liked... It's not really, you know, sports, but I'll count it as prop cycle.

194
00:11:31,137 --> 00:11:31,577
Yeah.

195
00:11:32,177 --> 00:11:54,543
[SPEAKER_08]: that's stretching it that's like saying DDR and taking the easy way out of this question I didn't say DDR uh some sports games that I've enjoyed in the past I used to play a game on the NES back in the day that I loved and I think it was like baseball baseball stars was that it you could like manage I have that game yes that game that game was awesome on Neo Geo

196
00:11:55,526 --> 00:11:57,427
[SPEAKER_08]: But they had an NES version of it, right?

197
00:11:57,827 --> 00:11:58,248
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they did.

198
00:11:58,348 --> 00:11:59,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it was RBI Baseball or something.

199
00:11:59,808 --> 00:12:00,889
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it wasn't RBI Baseball.

200
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:01,589
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't any other baseball.

201
00:12:01,609 --> 00:12:07,253
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think that Baseball Stars was the... I think they did a Neo Geo... That wasn't on Neo Geo.

202
00:12:07,273 --> 00:12:08,553
[SPEAKER_05]: The version of the Neo Geo one.

203
00:12:08,674 --> 00:12:10,695
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, like, they did one on the NES.

204
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:18,579
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, like, you know, because that didn't... The folks at Neo... They made some games on Nintendo before they spun off to their own thing.

205
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,820
[SPEAKER_08]: So, anyway...

206
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:23,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Other stuff I enjoy, Blades of Steel will always be one of my favorites.

207
00:12:23,903 --> 00:12:26,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I had Ice Hockey and Blades of Steel on the NES.

208
00:12:26,605 --> 00:12:27,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are both great games.

209
00:12:29,007 --> 00:12:32,449
[SPEAKER_08]: I really like a lot of racing games if you want to try and get a little more modern.

210
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:40,296
[SPEAKER_08]: I do like a lot of, like I like the, although I don't know if it's really sports borderline, but I like the Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune games.

211
00:12:40,336 --> 00:12:41,096
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a sport.

212
00:12:42,177 --> 00:12:43,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Racing is not a sport.

213
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Drifting is not a sport.

214
00:12:45,562 --> 00:12:48,986
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, drifting, they have competitions, but it's not like a sport.

215
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:55,995
[SPEAKER_08]: I've played the NASCAR games and I've enjoyed them, like in the arcade, you know, like the big old simulations that you get in there and get into.

216
00:12:56,095 --> 00:12:56,676
[SPEAKER_08]: I like those.

217
00:12:57,196 --> 00:12:57,977
[SPEAKER_08]: So those are pretty cool.

218
00:12:58,658 --> 00:13:01,422
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to think if there's a... Oh, you know what?

219
00:13:01,442 --> 00:13:01,462
[SPEAKER_08]: I...

220
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:19,638
[SPEAKER_08]: I really enjoyed, at least in the past, I haven't played a lot of them recently, but I remember when I was growing up, I used to love, on the Commodore 64, because you all know I loved my Commodore 64 growing up, I used to play the shit out of Winter Games and Summer Games 2, which were kind of like the Olympic, I mean there was a Summer Games 1, but we didn't own it.

221
00:13:20,038 --> 00:13:46,409
[SPEAKER_08]: so I had those other ones those are kind of like their Olympic games where you could do like cycling and you know if it was winter games you could do I don't know like I think figure skating and speed skating and some of the other stuff they have so I like the Olympics like I really do like that as far as sports go anyway so I like usually a lot of the Olympic games I even played the demo for that Mario and Sonic 2012 Olympic game that's coming out later this year because they have the 3DS demo out right now

222
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:50,351
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the trampoline one because that was the only one where you really noticed the 3D.

223
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:52,892
[SPEAKER_08]: But the cycling one drove me bonkers.

224
00:13:54,753 --> 00:13:56,254
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of the ones DarkSakura said.

225
00:13:56,274 --> 00:13:59,336
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to play NBA Jam in the arcade all the time.

226
00:13:59,576 --> 00:14:03,558
[SPEAKER_08]: I really tried to like this new NBA Jam that just came out, but I didn't really care for it.

227
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,279
[SPEAKER_08]: The new one that was on, yeah.

228
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:08,621
[SPEAKER_08]: I downloaded the demo on Fire Edition or whatever.

229
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:09,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't care for it.

230
00:14:09,941 --> 00:14:10,442
[SPEAKER_08]: It was not good.

231
00:14:10,562 --> 00:14:11,262
[SPEAKER_05]: That sad face.

232
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:12,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I tried.

233
00:14:13,183 --> 00:14:16,546
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, what was the game?

234
00:14:16,726 --> 00:14:17,567
[SPEAKER_05]: California Games.

235
00:14:18,848 --> 00:14:19,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, California Games.

236
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:24,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that was originally an Amiga game.

237
00:14:24,993 --> 00:14:26,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't great at it, but it was okay.

238
00:14:27,195 --> 00:14:28,076
[SPEAKER_05]: But it had the Unreal 360.

239
00:14:29,698 --> 00:14:35,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they tried to keep... Actually, that's like a spinoff of the Summer Games and Winter Games.

240
00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:38,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they kind of ran out of stuff to do Olympic related.

241
00:14:38,846 --> 00:14:38,966
[SPEAKER_05]: 720 and...

242
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:43,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that was a different series, but yeah, 720 was awesome.

243
00:14:44,188 --> 00:14:45,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, Loki, what about you?

244
00:14:46,909 --> 00:14:55,411
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to play some of the NFL Blitz arcade game back in, I don't know, when I worked at Roundtable.

245
00:14:55,591 --> 00:14:56,251
[SPEAKER_09]: That was kind of fun.

246
00:14:58,352 --> 00:15:03,213
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Co-op, it's running.

247
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,854
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, I don't play a lot of sports games.

248
00:15:07,414 --> 00:15:12,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I thought of a racing game that ought to count because everybody fucking loved this game when they were a kid.

249
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:17,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Iron Man, Ivan Stewart's Super Off-Road Racing.

250
00:15:17,706 --> 00:15:19,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Every pizza parlor had that, right?

251
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:19,788
[SPEAKER_05]: I never played it.

252
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:21,390
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually never played that one.

253
00:15:21,511 --> 00:15:22,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god.

254
00:15:22,632 --> 00:15:23,994
[SPEAKER_08]: That had an awesome NES.

255
00:15:24,135 --> 00:15:26,278
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember when the NES version of that came out.

256
00:15:26,298 --> 00:15:26,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Super NES.

257
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:27,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Or was it NES?

258
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:32,648
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it was regular NES because it was one of the few games that supported the... Multitap?

259
00:15:32,688 --> 00:15:34,050
[SPEAKER_08]: The Ultitap or whatever it was called.

260
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,071
[SPEAKER_08]: The Multitap.

261
00:15:36,623 --> 00:15:42,912
[SPEAKER_05]: If I was going to count a racing game as included, then I would totally, totally just put in the original Ridge Racer.

262
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that was a money sucker for me.

263
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,043
[SPEAKER_05]: If I hadn't worked at the damn arcade, I would have been broke.

264
00:15:52,498 --> 00:15:53,980
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, going to our chat room for some comments.

265
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,002
[SPEAKER_08]: If I got everything for Loki, sorry.

266
00:15:56,282 --> 00:15:56,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Just want to make sure.

267
00:15:57,783 --> 00:15:58,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

268
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:05,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com Kaijudo says, Baseball All-Stars was awesome and I had it on Nintendo.

269
00:16:07,013 --> 00:16:10,696
[SPEAKER_08]: RDGSinge says, OMG, no one mentioned track and field.

270
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:12,318
[SPEAKER_08]: That one was okay.

271
00:16:12,378 --> 00:16:18,481
[SPEAKER_08]: You know they had an Xbox Live port of that way back in the beginning when it was a bunch of old 80s Konami games were being ported over.

272
00:16:18,841 --> 00:16:23,003
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's really... I mean, it's good, but it's really just button mashing.

273
00:16:23,223 --> 00:16:32,548
[SPEAKER_08]: I did play Track and Field not even like three months ago, though, the last time I was at Electronica at Disneyland because they have the whole Flynn's Arcade and they had a Track and Field machine.

274
00:16:32,568 --> 00:16:33,369
[SPEAKER_09]: I played it on my...

275
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:35,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Arcade Cabinet not too long ago.

276
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:36,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

277
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:37,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, a few months ago.

278
00:16:37,472 --> 00:16:43,456
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's really just like, you know, but I guess then again, the Commodore 64 games were no better.

279
00:16:43,576 --> 00:16:45,137
[SPEAKER_08]: So what am I, who am I to judge?

280
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:48,600
[SPEAKER_08]: So, all right.

281
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks.

282
00:16:52,203 --> 00:16:55,685
[SPEAKER_08]: We usually like to start off the show, talk about the video games that we've been playing this week.

283
00:16:56,006 --> 00:16:57,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

284
00:16:57,607 --> 00:16:57,727
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

285
00:16:57,907 --> 00:16:58,548
[SPEAKER_05]: I played WoW.

286
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:00,131
[SPEAKER_05]: And something epic happened.

287
00:17:00,832 --> 00:17:01,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I have to tell a story.

288
00:17:01,874 --> 00:17:03,176
[SPEAKER_05]: I told you earlier, but I'm going to tell the newie.

289
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:03,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

290
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:07,945
[SPEAKER_05]: So this guy named LichRage on Blade's Edge Alliance, HumanDK...

291
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:19,089
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wandering around trying to finish the Love is in the Air crap, you know, they do for Valentine's suck.

292
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:27,095
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's this thing that you have to throw rose petals on certain race and class combinations, and one of them is a human death knight.

293
00:17:27,576 --> 00:17:29,897
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just went in trade chat and said, is there a human death knight around?

294
00:17:30,878 --> 00:17:32,900
[SPEAKER_05]: And this one said, yeah, ten gold.

295
00:17:34,101 --> 00:17:36,202
[SPEAKER_05]: So I invited him into my party.

296
00:17:37,283 --> 00:17:37,303
I

297
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:40,044
[SPEAKER_05]: and targeted him and then left the party.

298
00:17:40,364 --> 00:17:41,285
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said, you lied.

299
00:17:42,225 --> 00:17:46,587
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, you shouldn't have been charging for something that's a free service.

300
00:17:47,628 --> 00:17:49,809
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, I've only got 20 gold.

301
00:17:50,229 --> 00:17:51,950
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, so?

302
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Go out and earn it like the rest of us.

303
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Mining and herbalism are your friends.

304
00:17:56,592 --> 00:17:57,672
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said, suck it.

305
00:17:57,692 --> 00:17:59,853
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't do plenty of the herbalism.

306
00:18:00,934 --> 00:18:02,735
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's like, suck it.

307
00:18:02,795 --> 00:18:03,595
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, ignore.

308
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,139
[SPEAKER_08]: You should have just put, deal with it, happy face.

309
00:18:09,258 --> 00:18:11,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I wasn't rude to him.

310
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:17,039
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I was like, you know, when I started off... You swindled him.

311
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't swindle him.

312
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe a little bit.

313
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,460
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit.

314
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,480
[SPEAKER_08]: You swindled him a little bit.

315
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,860
[SPEAKER_05]: He thought I swindled him.

316
00:18:23,261 --> 00:18:26,241
[SPEAKER_08]: If you could, you would have had your character show her boobies a little bit.

317
00:18:26,781 --> 00:18:35,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Because my intention was the moment someone said, DK here, I was just going to find their name, target them, and throw the rose petals anyway.

318
00:18:35,603 --> 00:18:36,403
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the plan.

319
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:38,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Manny's like 10 gold.

320
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:39,964
[SPEAKER_05]: That's stupid.

321
00:18:40,425 --> 00:18:41,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't do that crap.

322
00:18:42,226 --> 00:18:43,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Go out and earn your own damn money.

323
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:47,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't help it if you keep buying every pet that pops up in the auction house.

324
00:18:48,889 --> 00:18:50,209
[SPEAKER_05]: It's addicting.

325
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,030
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of is.

326
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,391
[SPEAKER_05]: I've actually spent lots of money on pets.

327
00:18:53,411 --> 00:18:58,773
[SPEAKER_09]: They should really have a series of hoarders where it's people collecting wild pets.

328
00:18:58,933 --> 00:18:59,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Like MMO hoarders?

329
00:19:00,054 --> 00:19:00,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, MMO hoarders.

330
00:19:01,054 --> 00:19:02,175
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure that exists somewhere.

331
00:19:02,535 --> 00:19:04,037
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

332
00:19:22,396 --> 00:19:24,677
[SPEAKER_05]: So she gave it to me because I think she already had it.

333
00:19:25,477 --> 00:19:28,799
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'm also playing Bust a Move on my phone.

334
00:19:29,979 --> 00:19:30,859
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still super fun.

335
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:31,760
[SPEAKER_05]: I really enjoy it.

336
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,281
[SPEAKER_05]: And also I have to make an observation before we move on to Loki.

337
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:40,283
[SPEAKER_05]: On the can of Arizona Diet Green Tea is a prostitute.

338
00:19:42,164 --> 00:19:42,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

339
00:19:42,584 --> 00:19:43,604
[SPEAKER_05]: A taiyu.

340
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:48,686
[SPEAKER_05]: You can tell because her obi is tied in the front and her hair is over elaborate.

341
00:19:49,778 --> 00:19:51,519
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I get for studying weight.

342
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:53,479
[SPEAKER_08]: You know whoever designed that had no idea.

343
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,840
[SPEAKER_08]: They were just like, we just need to put something.

344
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,540
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like a geisha.

345
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we just need to put something Asian looking on this green tea.

346
00:19:59,021 --> 00:19:59,982
[SPEAKER_05]: But they've put a whore.

347
00:20:01,342 --> 00:20:06,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, a very high class, talented, artistic whore.

348
00:20:07,324 --> 00:20:09,985
[SPEAKER_08]: This writing here probably says, I am horse butt.

349
00:20:12,206 --> 00:20:13,666
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, I just had to point it out.

350
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:17,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked at the can and it dawned on me that it's a prostitute.

351
00:20:18,308 --> 00:20:26,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't there some website of like bad Chinese text tattoos where you see people that got tattoos of Chinese writing and it says like really horrible things?

352
00:20:26,553 --> 00:20:29,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, I don't know how much of that's legit and how much of it's fake, but eh.

353
00:20:30,655 --> 00:20:33,617
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, if that's it for DarkSakura's Gaming Week, Loki, how was your Gaming Week?

354
00:20:34,397 --> 00:20:35,758
[SPEAKER_09]: I played Skyrim.

355
00:20:36,098 --> 00:20:37,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Only a little bit though, actually.

356
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,460
[SPEAKER_09]: I mainly this week was working on Grand Theft Auto modding.

357
00:20:42,361 --> 00:20:46,543
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank God finished what I was working on because it was making my brain explode.

358
00:20:46,943 --> 00:20:50,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Had to go back and learn or relearn some calculus stuff.

359
00:20:51,825 --> 00:21:02,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Mainly because during my actual calculus class, well actually pre-calculus because I never took calculus, I was too busy programming a Final Fantasy type game on my calculator.

360
00:21:04,321 --> 00:21:07,924
[SPEAKER_09]: Skyrim I'm 123 hours now into the game and um

361
00:21:26,463 --> 00:21:31,145
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw some things how Skyrim's won all these Game of the Year awards.

362
00:21:31,385 --> 00:21:33,206
[SPEAKER_09]: That game is so fucking broken.

363
00:21:33,887 --> 00:21:34,867
[SPEAKER_09]: It is just ridiculous.

364
00:21:35,147 --> 00:21:43,311
[SPEAKER_09]: I literally have to now keep my iPod with me and pull up the quests as I do them to look at the bugs section.

365
00:21:43,651 --> 00:21:46,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Known bugs for this quest so I don't run into them.

366
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:54,917
[SPEAKER_09]: I ran into two yesterday that were not really game breaking but one of them would have been pretty fucking annoying if it

367
00:21:55,117 --> 00:21:57,939
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

368
00:22:22,697 --> 00:22:23,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome!

369
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:25,518
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not... It was one I hired.

370
00:22:25,698 --> 00:22:28,198
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a guy that was like, Hey, I'm the strongest guy here!

371
00:22:28,278 --> 00:22:29,578
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, you die!

372
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:30,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on.

373
00:22:30,699 --> 00:22:33,439
[SPEAKER_08]: You hired a companion so you could sacrifice them?

374
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:33,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

375
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:34,999
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

376
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:35,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

377
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,720
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, so I did that.

378
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:48,662
[SPEAKER_09]: And when she appears, when the Daedra appears, it's just like... It does this weird screen effect thing that gets all blurry and purple.

379
00:22:48,682 --> 00:22:49,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

380
00:22:49,642 --> 00:22:50,262
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

381
00:23:17,027 --> 00:23:18,448
[SPEAKER_09]: But no, it's not for the record.

382
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:22,471
[SPEAKER_09]: The other one was when I was trying to become the Thane of Riften.

383
00:23:23,092 --> 00:23:28,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, if you visit your house, you have to purchase a house in Riften.

384
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:34,880
[SPEAKER_09]: If you visit the house before you talk to the Jarl, you can never become the Thane of Riften.

385
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,342
[SPEAKER_09]: It just breaks the whole quest.

386
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:39,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

387
00:23:39,903 --> 00:23:43,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for... There is no fucking way they bug tested this game.

388
00:23:43,906 --> 00:23:48,050
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, most of the quests they seriously must not have tested at all.

389
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there is no way that this would have been missed.

390
00:23:50,932 --> 00:23:54,595
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just like... Completely obvious stuff.

391
00:23:54,896 --> 00:23:57,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, what would happen if I visited the house first?

392
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:58,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it breaks the fucking quest.

393
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no, we're not going to test for that.

394
00:24:01,822 --> 00:24:02,362
[SPEAKER_09]: It's good.

395
00:24:02,462 --> 00:24:04,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it worked the first time I played through it.

396
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:06,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Sigh.

397
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:11,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and I cheated in... Well, not technically cheated.

398
00:24:11,692 --> 00:24:16,115
[SPEAKER_09]: I exploited a glitch in the game to level my character up to 81.5, which is the cap.

399
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:17,375
[SPEAKER_09]: I capped all my skills at 100.

400
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:20,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, the cap is 81.5?

401
00:24:20,237 --> 00:24:20,177
81.5.

402
00:24:21,798 --> 00:24:22,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

403
00:24:22,939 --> 00:24:28,302
[SPEAKER_09]: It just happens to be that's the amount of leveling you get when you have all your skills at 100.

404
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:28,302
81.5.

405
00:24:30,924 --> 00:24:31,604
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't matter anyways.

406
00:24:31,644 --> 00:24:34,246
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm unkillable anyways, so whatever.

407
00:24:34,826 --> 00:24:35,967
[SPEAKER_09]: I just didn't want to have to...

408
00:24:37,468 --> 00:24:40,510
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted all my perk points right away so I could figure out where I wanted them.

409
00:24:41,051 --> 00:24:44,634
[SPEAKER_09]: And I actually went back and started doing the actual main quest line.

410
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,275
[SPEAKER_09]: And I gotta say, man, that thing is short.

411
00:24:46,876 --> 00:24:48,377
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a really short quest line.

412
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:50,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they usually are.

413
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:52,561
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the game isn't really about the main quest.

414
00:24:53,622 --> 00:24:56,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Main quest is just kind of there to help you learn about the game.

415
00:24:58,007 --> 00:25:01,308
[SPEAKER_09]: I am looking forward to the 1.4 patch so I can finish Blood on the Ice.

416
00:25:17,117 --> 00:25:18,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I'm going to go kill everybody once I'm done with all that.

417
00:25:19,578 --> 00:25:21,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody will die in a bloody rage.

418
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:23,980
[SPEAKER_09]: I did see a video this week.

419
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:24,520
[SPEAKER_09]: It was great.

420
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:32,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone had changed their player model to one of the kids and then they had some spell on there that was dragon fire and it was hilarious.

421
00:25:33,043 --> 00:25:33,403
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

422
00:25:33,483 --> 00:25:34,563
[SPEAKER_09]: It made me laugh.

423
00:25:35,824 --> 00:25:39,125
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a why kids can't be killed because they're actually dragons.

424
00:25:41,526 --> 00:25:42,626
[SPEAKER_09]: And Call of Duty.

425
00:25:43,146 --> 00:25:44,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Play more Call of Duty, of course.

426
00:25:46,425 --> 00:25:47,046
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, anything else?

427
00:25:48,406 --> 00:25:51,168
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's it, yeah.

428
00:25:51,769 --> 00:25:52,089
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

429
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,310
[SPEAKER_08]: My gaming week.

430
00:25:54,731 --> 00:25:56,912
[SPEAKER_08]: See, I actually played quite a bit of new stuff this week.

431
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:57,853
[SPEAKER_08]: A few games.

432
00:25:58,273 --> 00:26:00,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Soul Calibur V, quickly.

433
00:26:00,535 --> 00:26:04,718
[SPEAKER_08]: I literally played Soul Calibur V once, so I don't want to do a total review on it.

434
00:26:05,098 --> 00:26:07,800
[SPEAKER_08]: But I did spend about an hour with it the other night when I got it.

435
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,502
[SPEAKER_08]: And I had a fairly good time.

436
00:26:10,522 --> 00:26:11,542
[SPEAKER_08]: The fighting's a lot of fun.

437
00:26:11,662 --> 00:26:12,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Creative character's great.

438
00:26:12,903 --> 00:26:13,784
[SPEAKER_08]: I love creative character.

439
00:26:14,404 --> 00:26:34,926
[SPEAKER_08]: and you know I was making some fun characters with that and story mode I noticed though right off the bat was was kind of weird because like you would have these full cut scenes and then like a storyboard like thing like you just see like a cartoon storyboard that transitions paint like it almost feels like it was like half done a little bit rushed and

440
00:26:36,167 --> 00:27:03,609
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess the bottom line I noticed after you know the short amount of time I did play the game is that although the core fighter game itself which is what you're paying the money for is good I feel like everything kind of on the shell outside of that was a little bit like rushed or wonky except well creative characters decent the only thing that I'm disappointed is that you know because it's a game that didn't really pre-order anything do you know how they have that pre-order character that really weird looking guy no because I didn't pre wait no I pre-ordered on Amazon but they didn't give me anything

441
00:27:03,976 --> 00:27:06,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you're supposed to get this pre-order character.

442
00:27:06,337 --> 00:27:06,958
[SPEAKER_09]: It's this guy.

443
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:08,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it's only a GameStop or whatever.

444
00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:14,682
[SPEAKER_09]: It's this guy in a top hat or something like that that has some really wacky moves.

445
00:27:15,463 --> 00:27:17,224
[SPEAKER_09]: But that would have been kind of fun to play as.

446
00:27:17,984 --> 00:27:18,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

447
00:27:18,585 --> 00:27:19,985
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he may have been from 4.

448
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:21,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Or the PSP one, maybe, right?

449
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:24,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he might have been the PSP one.

450
00:27:24,188 --> 00:27:26,009
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish the Lost Amel was in this one.

451
00:27:26,189 --> 00:27:26,589
[SPEAKER_08]: I made a male Ivy.

452
00:27:26,609 --> 00:27:27,070
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awesome.

453
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:27,951
[SPEAKER_08]: What, like wearing Voldo's gear?

454
00:27:41,613 --> 00:27:46,497
[SPEAKER_08]: No, just wearing like a tight top and leather pants, you know.

455
00:27:46,677 --> 00:27:46,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

456
00:27:47,177 --> 00:27:47,698
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty cool.

457
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:53,122
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, Soul Calibur V. I'll tell you more about it when I have more time to play it.

458
00:27:53,302 --> 00:28:01,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I've been on my PlayStation 3 mostly been playing and sucked into Final Fantasy XIII too, which came out the same day.

459
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:06,451
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've sunk a good at least seven hours, if not more, into that at this point.

460
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:06,752
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

461
00:28:07,592 --> 00:28:11,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm really enjoying Final Fantasy XIII too.

462
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:20,030
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really surprised at how divided the internet is on this because there's just some people that really just fucking hate Final Fantasy XIII.

463
00:28:20,511 --> 00:28:23,074
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really don't think this game is going to do much to sway your mind.

464
00:28:23,695 --> 00:28:25,896
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's to the point, like, this is how divided it is.

465
00:28:25,976 --> 00:28:33,839
[SPEAKER_08]: You know that Final Fantasy XIII too is one of, like, what, less than 20 games to get a perfect 40 from Fumitsu Magazine ever, right?

466
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:37,701
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, like, Edge, I think in the UK, gave it a 5 out of 10.

467
00:28:38,481 --> 00:28:43,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, that's quite a difference between a perfect pristine score from Fumitsu and a 5.

468
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:45,924
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, it's just...

469
00:28:47,064 --> 00:28:50,647
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because these fucking reviewers go into this shit very biased.

470
00:28:51,088 --> 00:28:55,311
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they're like judging games on shit that they never judged games on before.

471
00:28:55,331 --> 00:28:56,992
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, this game is too linear.

472
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:57,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

473
00:28:57,793 --> 00:28:58,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

474
00:28:58,113 --> 00:28:59,995
[SPEAKER_08]: All these other RPGs were too linear?

475
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:01,336
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to give the disclaimer.

476
00:29:01,776 --> 00:29:03,057
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't read either of those reviews.

477
00:29:03,097 --> 00:29:03,978
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going off Wikipedia.

478
00:29:04,298 --> 00:29:05,719
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just really surprised, though.

479
00:29:05,739 --> 00:29:16,547
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, wow, this is really a diverse, you know, I would expect some, you know, not everybody's going to like everything, but just usually when it's all over the map like that, especially when Famitsu gave it such a high score, it just really surprised me.

480
00:29:16,567 --> 00:29:18,768
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, let's not talk about what other people thought of it.

481
00:29:18,788 --> 00:29:19,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk about what I thought of it.

482
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:39,221
[SPEAKER_08]: of course what they're doing is they're trying to fix a lot of what people bitched about with XIII there's definitely not a linear sense in this game whatsoever now you have this interesting map, the Crux, that you can travel to all these different time zones

483
00:29:39,801 --> 00:29:40,421
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

484
00:29:55,509 --> 00:29:56,750
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

485
00:30:15,745 --> 00:30:23,228
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really like an entire season of Doctor Who scratched into a video game.

486
00:30:23,568 --> 00:30:26,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Or actually, in some ways, it reminds me of Quantum Leap.

487
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:30,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, where are Noel and Sarah going to end up next?

488
00:30:30,471 --> 00:30:31,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Wah, wah, wah.

489
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:41,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but, uh, yeah, I mean, the, the, the really good thing about 13.2 is that the battle system is robust right off the bat.

490
00:30:42,436 --> 00:30:49,520
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, well, maybe you don't really get the monster character and the monster trapping and all that till episode two, but needless to say...

491
00:30:50,421 --> 00:31:00,795
[SPEAKER_08]: In 13, one of the big issues that people had was that it took forever before you even got to where you can flip paradigms and where the battle system becomes really interesting when you get the whole paradigm stuff, right?

492
00:31:01,215 --> 00:31:03,518
[SPEAKER_08]: For the first two chapters, you're pretty much just button mashing.

493
00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:04,940
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing else to do but auto-attack.

494
00:31:05,925 --> 00:31:30,431
[SPEAKER_08]: but in 13.2 that paradigm stuff starts battle one which is good so um towns are back random conversations side quests that people want you to do for them uh Chocolina who's now the shop who shows up everywhere I love Chocolina she's like a Vegas show girl meets a Chocobo it's great and um apparently there's like a casino later on with tons of mini games and all that stuff so

495
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,290
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really enjoying it.

496
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:42,296
[SPEAKER_08]: The story, although it's kind of confusing, I hate to make myself sound stupid, but the story is really confusing.

497
00:31:42,816 --> 00:31:49,580
[SPEAKER_08]: But I gotta say, it is really cool to kind of see characters from 13 years later.

498
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,142
[SPEAKER_08]: And they do some neat stuff with that, so it's cool.

499
00:31:53,542 --> 00:31:57,985
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing about the characters that's a little weird is that your party only has two people.

500
00:31:58,566 --> 00:32:00,227
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know if that's ever gonna change.

501
00:32:00,547 --> 00:32:04,510
[SPEAKER_08]: I kinda think the whole game might be just the two people and the rotating monster.

502
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:05,971
[SPEAKER_08]: That might turn some people off.

503
00:32:06,651 --> 00:32:07,011
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

504
00:32:07,352 --> 00:32:09,153
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's other stuff through DLC.

505
00:32:09,213 --> 00:32:11,194
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you might be able to get more characters as DLC.

506
00:32:11,835 --> 00:32:13,155
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a little bit...

507
00:32:14,136 --> 00:32:21,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Side Eye and Judging Square for jumping on that bandwagon because I really don't like when so much stuff is behind DLC.

508
00:32:22,258 --> 00:32:27,739
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's kind of like now games are really costing $90 because it's $60 for what you would.

509
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:31,720
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, a lot of that costume shit is paid to unlock content.

510
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, of course it is.

511
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course it is.

512
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,301
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing to download right now.

513
00:32:37,161 --> 00:33:02,167
[SPEAKER_08]: but I'm told that a bunch of zone areas are unlocked through DLC and I heard that Lightning and a General from the first game are supposed to be DLC at some point so I have to judge Square a little bit for hopping on that bad wagon you know especially when the series is a little bit vulnerable right now I think that especially when your game only has two characters in it that's a little bit...

514
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:11,433
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm judging you, but at least the game that you get for the money you pay for it is a robust experience.

515
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:14,196
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can think of far worse games to blow $60 on.

516
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,957
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think this game is worthy of a 5.

517
00:33:16,597 --> 00:33:20,981
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it's a perfect 40, but it's really good.

518
00:33:22,731 --> 00:33:23,351
[SPEAKER_08]: But not perfect.

519
00:33:24,312 --> 00:33:26,293
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what I think about Final Fantasy XIII too.

520
00:33:27,134 --> 00:33:29,335
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if you like XIII, play it.

521
00:33:29,956 --> 00:33:35,480
[SPEAKER_08]: And don't let that hurdle of, but I never beat XIII, stop you.

522
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:44,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Because yes, the game will tell you what happened at the end of XIII, and you can even go through a mode that just, like it'll just walk you through the story of Final Fantasy XIII.

523
00:33:44,726 --> 00:33:47,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, albeit it's kind of like narrated text, but you get the idea.

524
00:33:48,048 --> 00:33:52,591
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I didn't beat XIII, and I don't feel like it was really ruined for me.

525
00:33:53,011 --> 00:33:55,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I will know what happens right at the end of 13.

526
00:33:56,713 --> 00:33:59,634
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, there's still a lot of stuff that it takes to get there.

527
00:34:00,294 --> 00:34:00,554
[SPEAKER_08]: You know?

528
00:34:00,774 --> 00:34:04,695
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like, just knowing the ending, I don't think it's going to totally ruin 13 for me.

529
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:08,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I will have to go back and... Because I was on like chapter 12 when I stopped.

530
00:34:08,497 --> 00:34:09,497
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a long way through it.

531
00:34:10,558 --> 00:34:12,258
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, 13.2 is worth your time.

532
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:15,600
[SPEAKER_08]: One other game I played this week.

533
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:16,440
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

534
00:34:18,106 --> 00:34:19,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Tangent for a minute.

535
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:23,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio started, of course, for many years.

536
00:34:23,671 --> 00:34:28,195
[SPEAKER_08]: For about, what, four years, we were a show exclusively about music games.

537
00:34:28,675 --> 00:34:32,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Because DarkSakura, Loki, and myself all met playing DDR at the local arcade.

538
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:43,949
[SPEAKER_08]: And the original concept behind the show was, let's make this kind of like show about what we enjoy doing at the arcades every Wednesday or Thursday night, whatever night it was we were going back then.

539
00:34:44,709 --> 00:35:10,568
[SPEAKER_08]: and you know we also always used to go to Brookfield's the diner afterwards and kind of talk shit about games it was kind of like let's let's do that as like our show um so for a long time it was about music games we talked about DDR and the new songs are coming out in DDR we used to talk about guitar freaks and drum media and keyboard media para para paradise all these games that Konami did and when they first came out I think we were right on right I think we changed formats right around the time Guitar Hero was breaking and all that stuff um

540
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:27,181
[SPEAKER_08]: So, the bottom line is, we switched from doing a music game only show to a gaming show because there wasn't a lot of stuff in the music game world to talk about anymore, which was ironic because then about a year after we switched, Rock Band and Guitar Hero 2 and all that just made it huge.

541
00:35:27,782 --> 00:35:31,465
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, we felt like there was more we could do talking about regular games.

542
00:35:32,205 --> 00:35:40,395
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't been following the music gaming scene as closely since then, but I do kind of like, you know, I like to, I check Bomani style once in a while.

543
00:35:40,435 --> 00:35:46,261
[SPEAKER_08]: I checked DDR Freak when that was still running, you know, and I would just kind of like keep, I'd like to keep tabs on the music game scene.

544
00:35:46,642 --> 00:35:51,808
[SPEAKER_08]: But I gotta say, I haven't really, really enjoyed a Bomani game in a long time.

545
00:35:52,228 --> 00:35:52,648
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't.

546
00:35:53,249 --> 00:35:56,570
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't really cared for a lot of the music in the newer Beatmania 2DXs.

547
00:35:57,751 --> 00:36:01,353
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't think Jubeat was all that, or Ubeat, or whatever they call that game.

548
00:36:02,353 --> 00:36:05,115
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't think, what else has come out since then?

549
00:36:05,395 --> 00:36:10,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Poppin' Music, you know, the one they tried here on the Xbox was absolutely awful.

550
00:36:11,258 --> 00:36:12,819
[SPEAKER_08]: The Wii one was really weird.

551
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:16,681
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can't say I've really, really, truly enjoyed a Bomani game.

552
00:36:17,541 --> 00:36:46,480
[SPEAKER_08]: until I think this week I downloaded a game on Xbox Live that's out called Rhythm Party and I have to say it's actually pretty good now it's not perfect there are some things wrong with it but all things considered Rhythm Party is kind of the game that Dance Masters the Kinect game that came out last year on Xbox 360 that was like Konami's first like let's put a Bomani game with Kinect

553
00:36:47,926 --> 00:36:51,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Rhythm Party is the game that Dance Masters should have been, I really think.

554
00:36:51,727 --> 00:37:00,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Ironically enough, Dance Masters, or Dance Evolution as it's called in Japan, is an arcade game, or will become an arcade game very soon.

555
00:37:00,329 --> 00:37:00,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

556
00:37:00,769 --> 00:37:02,869
[SPEAKER_08]: But Rhythm Party should, okay?

557
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:03,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

558
00:37:03,049 --> 00:37:04,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, here's the thing about Rhythm Party.

559
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:07,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sorry.

560
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:11,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Konami is setting this game up to fail, I really think.

561
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,431
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of think this is just coming out.

562
00:37:13,871 --> 00:37:16,572
[SPEAKER_08]: I went to Bomani Style to see what they were saying about it,

563
00:37:17,692 --> 00:37:18,793
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing on it.

564
00:37:19,673 --> 00:37:24,015
[SPEAKER_08]: I put it on Twitter, like Rhythm Party, and nobody's talking about it.

565
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,675
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw one Major Nelson tweet.

566
00:37:26,055 --> 00:37:32,378
[SPEAKER_08]: The only way I knew about this game was from following Naoki Midea on Facebook, who is, of course, one of the big guys.

567
00:37:32,598 --> 00:37:33,278
[SPEAKER_08]: And we mentioned it.

568
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:36,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, we mentioned it on the show last week, because we were like, oh, Naoki's teasing this game.

569
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,721
[SPEAKER_08]: And I remembered that, and so I'm like, oh, I'll download it and check it out.

570
00:37:40,021 --> 00:37:45,143
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I fired it up, I noticed that the menu music was the music from Dance Dance Revolution 5th Mix.

571
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:47,164
[SPEAKER_08]: and I was like, oh, I loved Fifth Mix.

572
00:37:47,204 --> 00:37:47,905
[SPEAKER_08]: I love this music.

573
00:37:47,945 --> 00:37:48,585
[SPEAKER_08]: This is awesome.

574
00:37:49,046 --> 00:37:51,988
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I went into the game and I was kind of like looking through the songs.

575
00:37:52,048 --> 00:37:56,912
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, okay, well, even though it's only 10 songs, this is a decent mix of songs.

576
00:37:56,992 --> 00:38:00,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Like there's more stuff that's interesting to me here than there was in all of Dance Masters.

577
00:38:02,516 --> 00:38:05,959
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and then I fired up the game and played it for a little bit.

578
00:38:05,979 --> 00:38:07,901
[SPEAKER_08]: So let me tell you where this game's a little bit different.

579
00:38:08,582 --> 00:38:15,969
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not really like Dance Masters or Dance Central at all because you're not trying to mimic a pre-choreographed dance.

580
00:38:16,489 --> 00:38:20,212
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually a lot more like DDR or really Samba de Amigo.

581
00:38:20,953 --> 00:38:21,413
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

582
00:38:39,429 --> 00:38:42,750
[SPEAKER_08]: But you also get extra points as you freestyle.

583
00:38:43,471 --> 00:38:45,492
[SPEAKER_08]: If you jump, you get extra points.

584
00:38:45,552 --> 00:38:46,772
[SPEAKER_08]: If you turn, you get extra points.

585
00:38:47,152 --> 00:38:54,595
[SPEAKER_08]: If you hit balls with hands you're not supposed to, like you do crossovers and stuff, you get extra points.

586
00:38:54,635 --> 00:38:56,496
[SPEAKER_08]: If you do poses and stuff, you get extra points.

587
00:38:56,776 --> 00:39:03,559
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's really this emphasis on kind of making your own dance out of the balls that fly in out of that kind of pattern.

588
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:11,624
[SPEAKER_08]: It was entertaining, especially for somebody that really liked DDR, that was all about timing and hitting the arrows.

589
00:39:11,984 --> 00:39:17,068
[SPEAKER_08]: This is truly a Kinect version of DDR, which I don't think Dance Masters was.

590
00:39:17,128 --> 00:39:21,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Dance Masters, unfortunately, felt like Dance Central did this a little better.

591
00:39:22,211 --> 00:39:25,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Better music, easier to understand the choreography.

592
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:33,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas I think this is now a true, okay, it's not about the choreography, it's about the more music timing and doing all this.

593
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:46,999
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, the song list, there's only 10 songs, which is a little eh, because two of them feature Vanilla Ice, but there are some good choices in there, Born This Way, Every Little Step, YMCA

594
00:39:50,316 --> 00:39:55,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Every song, this is what really reminded me of old DDR.

595
00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:05,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Every song has its own unique background, its own unique video, and its own unique kind of thing that your character does or turns into.

596
00:40:05,584 --> 00:40:06,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me explain what I mean.

597
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:12,788
[SPEAKER_08]: When you're playing Born This Way by Lady Gaga, if you do really well, you suddenly turn into this electric peacock.

598
00:40:12,888 --> 00:40:14,149
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know how to explain it.

599
00:40:14,469 --> 00:40:16,670
[SPEAKER_08]: But the cool thing is, it's still you.

600
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:18,151
[SPEAKER_05]: You look like a human pipe organ.

601
00:40:18,351 --> 00:40:18,711
[SPEAKER_08]: YMCA

602
00:40:48,671 --> 00:40:51,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything I used to really like about the DDR games is kind of in this game.

603
00:40:52,815 --> 00:40:59,142
[SPEAKER_08]: But what I really feel like I'm playing here is the demo.

604
00:41:00,754 --> 00:41:02,996
[SPEAKER_08]: for a full retail game.

605
00:41:03,117 --> 00:41:04,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's the rest of the songs?

606
00:41:05,259 --> 00:41:06,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's multiplayer?

607
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's anything?

608
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:14,368
[SPEAKER_08]: I really feel like they're selling a demo for what could potentially be a really good retail game.

609
00:41:14,729 --> 00:41:17,612
[SPEAKER_08]: But I have this bad feeling because nobody knows about it.

610
00:41:17,992 --> 00:41:21,916
[SPEAKER_08]: I really feel like Konami just kind of...

611
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay Naoki, we know you have this idea.

612
00:41:25,161 --> 00:41:26,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you throw something together?

613
00:41:26,721 --> 00:41:34,444
[SPEAKER_08]: And like, you know, they threw together the demo and, you know, Konami was just like, eh, let's just put it out on Xbox Live and see if it sticks.

614
00:41:35,164 --> 00:41:38,766
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just have this really bad feeling it's not gonna.

615
00:41:39,066 --> 00:41:40,907
[SPEAKER_08]: There's room for the game to support DLC.

616
00:41:42,768 --> 00:41:49,858
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I trust Konami to handle the DLC appropriately based on other games where two songs ever come out as DLC.

617
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:56,867
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to just cross my fingers and really hope that they get some licensed songs and they get some good stuff in there to really round out the game.

618
00:41:59,235 --> 00:42:00,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Rhythm Party is really not bad.

619
00:42:22,561 --> 00:42:27,445
[SPEAKER_08]: and I'll be really bummed if it doesn't go anywhere other than this because it's not that bad.

620
00:42:27,785 --> 00:42:32,649
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, Jamie, you just only got to watch me play it a little bit but I think you kind of went into it going, really?

621
00:42:32,729 --> 00:42:33,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Rhythm party?

622
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,592
[SPEAKER_08]: But you kind of seemed like you were like, oh, this is cute, right?

623
00:42:36,172 --> 00:42:36,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

624
00:42:37,213 --> 00:42:39,315
[SPEAKER_05]: I want... Actually, I do want...

625
00:42:40,175 --> 00:42:42,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you've always been a vocal critic of Konami.

626
00:42:42,516 --> 00:42:44,937
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you haven't really played it, but you saw me doing it for a little bit.

627
00:42:45,617 --> 00:42:46,698
[SPEAKER_09]: It looked okay.

628
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,419
[SPEAKER_09]: But when I saw them announcing this, I'm like, oh, that's going to suck.

629
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:51,559
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even want to look at it.

630
00:42:51,779 --> 00:42:53,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?

631
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,341
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was just all right.

632
00:42:56,361 --> 00:43:01,023
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember my snarky comment on it was like, oh, yeah.

633
00:43:01,043 --> 00:43:02,183
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember what it was.

634
00:43:02,263 --> 00:43:03,124
[SPEAKER_09]: It was something about...

635
00:43:05,487 --> 00:43:08,348
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what happened behind the scenes, but it is worth your time to check out.

636
00:43:08,368 --> 00:43:13,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the way they may be treating it is like a retail game where they're gonna...

637
00:43:33,217 --> 00:43:34,017
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'll see you next time.

638
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:59,947
[SPEAKER_08]: slap together a 10-pack of old DDR classics.

639
00:44:00,768 --> 00:44:07,652
[SPEAKER_08]: I realize if you're doing custom backgrounds for everything, maybe that takes a little more time and art and so forth, but they could get away with fudging it a little bit.

640
00:44:08,013 --> 00:44:09,814
[SPEAKER_08]: The old DDR games recycled a few things here and there.

641
00:44:10,134 --> 00:44:17,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Recycle some of the art assets and just put out 10 other DDR songs for free, and then this game will have a really enhanced value.

642
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:18,600
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it will.

643
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:23,661
[SPEAKER_08]: and then put some, like, if you get some decent licenses, like, they license Gaga.

644
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:26,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody paid for that, like, you know?

645
00:44:26,602 --> 00:44:33,644
[SPEAKER_08]: But unfortunately, it's one modern song and then two retro classics with Bobby Blackwolf, or Bobby Blackwolf.

646
00:44:34,824 --> 00:44:37,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby Blackwolf, uh, a.k.a.

647
00:44:37,645 --> 00:44:38,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Vanilla Ice.

648
00:44:39,946 --> 00:44:41,426
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually like the Vanilla Ice song.

649
00:44:42,287 --> 00:44:44,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby Brown, Bobby!

650
00:44:45,547 --> 00:44:45,687
[SPEAKER_08]: And...

651
00:44:48,127 --> 00:44:49,868
[SPEAKER_08]: That clip's going to end up on his show at some point.

652
00:44:49,908 --> 00:44:50,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Watch.

653
00:44:50,629 --> 00:44:54,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby Brown and Village People were like the retro bigs.

654
00:44:54,151 --> 00:44:54,732
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really it.

655
00:44:55,412 --> 00:44:57,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Vanilla Ice, retro yet new.

656
00:44:58,214 --> 00:44:58,514
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

657
00:44:58,954 --> 00:45:00,816
[SPEAKER_08]: The songs, they're not terrible.

658
00:45:01,336 --> 00:45:02,097
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not terrible.

659
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:11,623
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not like, I'm going to go run out and buy the CD tomorrow, but they're better than most of the stuff from Dance Masters, which was very unremarkable.

660
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:14,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Dance Masters was just frustrating.

661
00:45:14,951 --> 00:45:19,759
[SPEAKER_09]: And the fact that they're making an arcade game now, it's just, there's no cues whatsoever to what to do.

662
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:23,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and I understand that, you know, para games and stuff like that,

663
00:45:25,644 --> 00:45:27,505
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

664
00:45:48,126 --> 00:45:49,947
[SPEAKER_09]: How am I going to follow this?

665
00:45:50,188 --> 00:45:55,492
[SPEAKER_05]: The only reason I was ever able to do anything good at Dance Masters was that I knew the Parapara routines.

666
00:45:55,632 --> 00:45:58,194
[SPEAKER_08]: There's really only two Parapara songs in that whole game.

667
00:45:58,694 --> 00:45:59,195
[SPEAKER_08]: There really are.

668
00:45:59,355 --> 00:46:00,015
[SPEAKER_08]: There's five.

669
00:46:00,856 --> 00:46:01,857
[SPEAKER_08]: No, there's two.

670
00:46:01,997 --> 00:46:05,980
[SPEAKER_08]: There's Night of Fire.

671
00:46:07,201 --> 00:46:08,442
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought there were two others.

672
00:46:08,642 --> 00:46:11,424
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that they did Like a Virgin.

673
00:46:11,444 --> 00:46:12,765
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought Like a Virgin was in there.

674
00:46:13,086 --> 00:46:14,226
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't think so.

675
00:46:15,688 --> 00:46:16,068
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway...

676
00:46:17,403 --> 00:46:17,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

677
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:29,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I've spent a lot of time talking about that song, or talking about that game, but, you know, just as I've been a fan of music games for so, so long, I was just really surprised at what an unremarkable launch this game has had.

678
00:46:29,589 --> 00:46:31,430
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think it's worth your attention, I really do.

679
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:37,913
[SPEAKER_08]: And if anybody from Konami, haha, is listening, you might want to consider making Rhythm Party the arcade game, because I think, but...

680
00:46:39,053 --> 00:46:40,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it needs a better name.

681
00:46:41,114 --> 00:46:42,735
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think Rhythm Party is the best name.

682
00:46:42,915 --> 00:46:44,136
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what they're calling it in Japan?

683
00:46:44,596 --> 00:46:45,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Boom Boom Dance.

684
00:46:46,758 --> 00:46:47,498
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a better name.

685
00:46:48,379 --> 00:46:49,900
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's no Boom Boom Dollar in it.

686
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,122
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know why I bet they didn't call it that here?

687
00:46:53,682 --> 00:46:54,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Because of Boom Boom Rocket.

688
00:46:55,003 --> 00:46:57,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember Boom Boom Rocket from EA?

689
00:46:58,725 --> 00:47:00,086
[SPEAKER_08]: God, that was about five years ago now.

690
00:47:00,366 --> 00:47:03,368
[SPEAKER_08]: That was an old-ass one with little arrows that would come up and you'd do the fireworks.

691
00:47:04,469 --> 00:47:04,789
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was...

692
00:47:05,563 --> 00:47:07,204
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking on here.

693
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:10,287
[SPEAKER_05]: It says that there's an achievement for playing three Parapara genre songs.

694
00:47:11,547 --> 00:47:14,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, maybe there's other songs that weren't in Parapara Paradise.

695
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:16,991
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's what it was.

696
00:47:17,351 --> 00:47:21,174
[SPEAKER_05]: There are songs that I knew, but they weren't in Parapara Paradise.

697
00:47:21,765 --> 00:47:22,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I believe you.

698
00:47:23,587 --> 00:47:25,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Dance Masters wasn't, you know.

699
00:47:25,869 --> 00:47:26,209
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway.

700
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:28,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so that's it for my gaming week.

701
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:29,592
[SPEAKER_08]: I've talked plenty.

702
00:47:30,253 --> 00:47:32,034
[SPEAKER_08]: So, housekeeping, real quick.

703
00:47:32,074 --> 00:47:32,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Follow us on Facebook.

704
00:47:32,935 --> 00:47:35,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio or of course there's Twitter.

705
00:47:35,898 --> 00:47:38,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

706
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get into some news.

707
00:47:41,282 --> 00:47:42,864
[SPEAKER_08]: And Loki's going to start us off tonight.

708
00:47:42,884 --> 00:47:45,326
[SPEAKER_08]: You got a lot of stuff about one particular company, right?

709
00:47:46,152 --> 00:47:58,226
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, I was going to say, the song was for Dance Masters, so Night of Fire was one of them, Yesterday was the other Para song, and...

710
00:48:01,613 --> 00:48:06,357
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, it might have been one of these other... There's a lot of songs I don't recognize.

711
00:48:06,837 --> 00:48:09,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe Can't Stop Falling in Love Super Hero version?

712
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:10,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that did have a para.

713
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:13,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that was in para.

714
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:14,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that was a para para song.

715
00:48:15,044 --> 00:48:15,805
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet that's it then.

716
00:48:17,687 --> 00:48:18,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Mystery solved!

717
00:48:19,368 --> 00:48:20,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, fair enough.

718
00:48:20,749 --> 00:48:23,952
[SPEAKER_09]: If only it was that easy for companies to do well.

719
00:48:24,472 --> 00:48:28,896
[SPEAKER_09]: THQ, on the other hand, has been having a rough... A boom boom fire of their own.

720
00:48:31,138 --> 00:48:31,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

721
00:48:49,149 --> 00:48:53,392
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, THQ received a stock delisting notice.

722
00:48:54,213 --> 00:49:03,759
[SPEAKER_09]: And they basically have 180 calendar days until July 23rd to make the stock regain compliance for 10 consecutive business days.

723
00:49:04,259 --> 00:49:09,903
[SPEAKER_09]: If the company can't comply, then they get taken off the stock market, basically.

724
00:49:10,764 --> 00:49:15,847
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, their stock has fallen quite a bit down to about $0.70 a share.

725
00:49:16,988 --> 00:49:17,628
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's not good.

726
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:24,196
[SPEAKER_09]: also the CEO they've taken a 50% pay cut

727
00:49:26,488 --> 00:49:30,650
[SPEAKER_09]: And also the board of directors, they've taken pay cuts as well.

728
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:33,691
[SPEAKER_08]: Meaning $10 million as opposed to $20.

729
00:49:33,811 --> 00:49:35,652
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to see layoffs.

730
00:49:35,812 --> 00:49:36,832
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no.

731
00:49:38,193 --> 00:49:41,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, the CEO doesn't make millions of dollars.

732
00:49:42,274 --> 00:49:44,175
[SPEAKER_09]: He does make six figures.

733
00:49:44,575 --> 00:49:46,036
[SPEAKER_09]: He dropped his salary from $718,500 a year to $359,250 a year.

734
00:49:53,393 --> 00:49:55,875
[SPEAKER_09]: How's he gonna scrape by is what I want to know, man.

735
00:49:55,895 --> 00:49:57,956
[SPEAKER_09]: That's some tough stuff right there.

736
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:01,058
[SPEAKER_09]: God, that's just disgusting.

737
00:50:02,859 --> 00:50:10,364
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, of course, you know, some of the other, you know, they've cut from three times the highest bonus to, was it the...

738
00:50:11,164 --> 00:50:12,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Just as high as bonus ever.

739
00:50:13,326 --> 00:50:19,791
[SPEAKER_08]: At least he wasn't forced to take the, you know, Apple CEO at Steve Jobs used to get a dollar and then a bunch of stock options.

740
00:50:20,391 --> 00:50:22,953
[SPEAKER_08]: At least this guy wasn't forced to take stock.

741
00:50:23,154 --> 00:50:28,237
[SPEAKER_09]: The board of directors, they've decided to take 50% less cash compensation for a year.

742
00:50:29,799 --> 00:50:29,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

743
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:39,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, unfortunately, with all these cuts and delisting threats come layoffs.

744
00:50:39,843 --> 00:50:47,184
[SPEAKER_09]: 240 people were set to be laid off, and it would be, I guess, across nine months.

745
00:50:48,425 --> 00:50:52,185
[SPEAKER_09]: They said it should be, let's see here.

746
00:50:52,225 --> 00:50:54,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Enough time to finish whatever game they were working on.

747
00:50:54,946 --> 00:50:55,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

748
00:50:57,026 --> 00:51:00,407
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't believe 240 is the correct number.

749
00:51:00,587 --> 00:51:01,528
[SPEAKER_09]: It's up to 240.

750
00:51:01,588 --> 00:51:06,149
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to say it was 172 or something like that is what it's supposed to be.

751
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:15,392
[SPEAKER_09]: They said that this isn't anything that they were trying to hide, that the cuts were described in their statement last week.

752
00:51:16,392 --> 00:51:18,215
[SPEAKER_09]: and that no studios are a part of this.

753
00:51:18,295 --> 00:51:21,379
[SPEAKER_09]: It's administration and publishing offices worldwide.

754
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,984
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, also...

755
00:51:28,425 --> 00:51:33,908
[SPEAKER_09]: do the varying employment guidelines around the world and internal finance considerations.

756
00:51:34,388 --> 00:51:43,111
[SPEAKER_09]: The restructuring will be completed by September 30, 2012, but most affected employees have already been notified.

757
00:51:45,212 --> 00:51:52,515
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, on top of all that, they've revealed that they've lost $56 million in quarter three, which...

758
00:51:59,062 --> 00:52:03,666
[SPEAKER_09]: That would, let's see, quarter ending in December 31st, 2011.

759
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:05,708
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of surprised that they lost a lot of money.

760
00:52:05,728 --> 00:52:23,185
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess they were just in the hole so much that, you know, even though Saints Row III and WWE 12 did good, or well, I should say, it just wasn't enough to kind of make up for the slump in sales.

761
00:52:23,305 --> 00:52:25,987
[SPEAKER_09]: And they actually had a pretty good quarter.

762
00:52:26,027 --> 00:52:31,752
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think we started off with, I don't remember if Warhammer, no, I don't think Warhammer was in that quarter.

763
00:52:31,772 --> 00:52:32,913
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that was Q2.

764
00:52:33,034 --> 00:52:41,421
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyways, regardless of that, one other game did come out in quarter three for them, and that would have been UDraw, and they're not putting out any more of those.

765
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:49,640
[SPEAKER_08]: All of this sad trombone stuff for THQ, is it all because of Udraw?

766
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,642
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think they could have invested.

767
00:52:51,662 --> 00:52:53,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Could One Peripheral bring down a company like that?

768
00:52:54,025 --> 00:52:55,027
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.

769
00:52:55,087 --> 00:52:58,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is it because their kiddie games are not doing too well either?

770
00:52:58,291 --> 00:53:24,395
[SPEAKER_09]: but their kiddie games not doing well I don't think is a big deal because even this year they focused more on well not entirely more so on less on kiddie games more on their core franchises however though they did have a few games come out that were kind of kiddie that did not do well like for example they had Kung Fu Panda 2 which kind of bombed

771
00:53:25,015 --> 00:53:46,642
[SPEAKER_09]: and you know what, it really is kind of their fault though, it bombed, I mean, let's see, they had on the PS3, which no one really buys kids games on the PS3, the Xbox 360 version was Kinect required, the Wii version was UDraw required, Wii right there, that is a problem, see, if they had it, you know, kind of, that is a prime audience right there, and you're really limiting it to people that buy your fucking tablet, which no one did...

772
00:53:48,459 --> 00:53:49,939
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's just kind of annoying.

773
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:58,461
[SPEAKER_08]: DungeonBuster in our chatroom at chat.orangesponsorator.com says, Saints Row III and WWE 12 did well, but U-Draw crapped all over the good news for both games.

774
00:53:58,521 --> 00:54:02,242
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, it's really shocking to me, like, that U-Draw's... It wasn't, I don't think it was that.

775
00:54:02,362 --> 00:54:10,664
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that that had a big... But, I mean, U-Draw was a huge investment for them, and I mean, nobody bought it.

776
00:54:11,224 --> 00:54:17,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, the one on the Wii that came out, what, a year before, a couple years ago, that one got bought.

777
00:54:17,766 --> 00:54:20,927
[SPEAKER_08]: But didn't they try to put that UDraw tablet on the PS3?

778
00:54:21,608 --> 00:54:22,428
[SPEAKER_08]: It was on PS3 and 360.

779
00:54:22,528 --> 00:54:23,749
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a huge mistake.

780
00:54:24,129 --> 00:54:25,009
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a huge mistake.

781
00:54:25,249 --> 00:54:25,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it came out.

782
00:54:26,069 --> 00:54:29,010
[SPEAKER_09]: That was what they were trying to debut, and they were trying to debut some other games.

783
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:33,192
[SPEAKER_08]: I would argue, literally, no one bought it on the PlayStation 3.

784
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,541
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd say probably close to no one bought it.

785
00:54:37,361 --> 00:54:38,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, obviously, that's what I really mean.

786
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:47,207
[SPEAKER_09]: But then also, you know, they had the Penguins of Madagascar game and stuff like that that came out that no one gave a shit about.

787
00:54:48,167 --> 00:54:57,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it maybe because if you tie into movies that aren't so successful at the box office, like, wasn't that... What Penguin movie was that?

788
00:54:59,613 --> 00:55:00,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Penguins of Madagascar.

789
00:55:00,734 --> 00:55:03,015
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all the DreamWorks properties is what they had.

790
00:55:03,955 --> 00:55:07,457
[SPEAKER_09]: They had a Spongebob game that no one gave a shit about that came out.

791
00:55:08,698 --> 00:55:11,319
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just that stuff doesn't do well anymore.

792
00:55:11,799 --> 00:55:17,142
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, kind of it's run its course and no one really cared about Puss in Boots the game.

793
00:55:17,202 --> 00:55:19,743
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's just like, eh, whatever, you know.

794
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:22,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Or the Penguins of Madagascar game.

795
00:55:22,545 --> 00:55:22,805
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean...

796
00:55:23,385 --> 00:55:24,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, we're gonna get...

797
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,486
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to enter in this market too.

798
00:55:51,547 --> 00:55:53,455
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems like they're doing well with that U-Draw.

799
00:55:53,676 --> 00:55:54,640
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to put ours out.

800
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:57,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Tanked.

801
00:55:57,330 --> 00:56:00,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that mean we could expect something really awful to come to Ubisoft soon?

802
00:56:00,951 --> 00:56:03,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Or do you think they had enough to keep them above water?

803
00:56:03,112 --> 00:56:04,772
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think they're going to release anything else for it.

804
00:56:04,792 --> 00:56:09,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Luckily, they still have Assassin's Creed and enough things to kind of... Oh, and they actually do quite a bit.

805
00:56:10,293 --> 00:56:10,793
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, I know.

806
00:56:10,814 --> 00:56:14,034
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot less with kid stuff recently, but they do quite a bit.

807
00:56:15,175 --> 00:56:19,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't Rocksmith do a little better than folks thought for a really niche thing?

808
00:56:19,716 --> 00:56:22,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I know people on Facebook that are playing it.

809
00:56:22,256 --> 00:56:24,717
[SPEAKER_08]: I would not have expected to be playing any video games at all.

810
00:56:24,997 --> 00:56:26,118
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it did okay.

811
00:56:26,899 --> 00:56:29,100
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it hasn't really been a huge hit.

812
00:56:29,521 --> 00:56:36,807
[SPEAKER_09]: It did better than, what was it, Six Strings, Rise of the Six Strings.

813
00:56:36,907 --> 00:56:39,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, that one kind of disappeared, didn't it?

814
00:56:39,469 --> 00:56:40,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

815
00:56:41,951 --> 00:56:42,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that wasn't very good.

816
00:56:46,023 --> 00:56:47,223
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds dreadful.

817
00:56:47,664 --> 00:56:52,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's too bad for THQ.

818
00:56:52,565 --> 00:56:54,445
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope it doesn't impact Saints Row IV.

819
00:56:54,565 --> 00:56:55,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no.

820
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:56,666
[SPEAKER_09]: It won't.

821
00:56:57,306 --> 00:56:58,986
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure they're going to do well.

822
00:56:59,266 --> 00:57:03,668
[SPEAKER_09]: This year, kicking off things, they've got UFC 3, which will do well for them.

823
00:57:03,728 --> 00:57:04,848
[SPEAKER_09]: That's in a couple weeks.

824
00:57:05,628 --> 00:57:30,856
[SPEAKER_09]: they're going to have Darksiders 2 coming I think in May-ish then of course they've got the South Park RPG game coming out later this year there'll be another WWE game, WW13 I'm sure there's going to be some other big franchises that they're going to have um

825
00:57:32,236 --> 00:57:35,718
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think Saints Row the 4th would be coming out anytime soon.

826
00:57:35,978 --> 00:57:37,900
[SPEAKER_09]: I would hope not.

827
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:48,926
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think it's too soon for something like that, but they're going to have DLC for the 3rd coming out, and I think that sold well for them, but I wouldn't worry about THQ.

828
00:57:48,946 --> 00:57:49,587
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to be fine.

829
00:57:51,028 --> 00:57:51,328
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

830
00:57:51,877 --> 00:58:02,825
[SPEAKER_09]: But I would say, you know, that it really sucks that Nintendo didn't embrace the whole UDraw tablet, but you kind of see why they didn't because of the direction that they went.

831
00:58:02,845 --> 00:58:05,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, now, yeah, now with the Wii U, they, it's...

832
00:58:14,053 --> 00:58:20,177
[SPEAKER_09]: or they're going to hold on to it for a little longer and make a Mario Paint game for the Wii U. That's probably more like it.

833
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:29,782
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, speaking of the Wii U, Team Ninja has commented on the Wii U, talking about it, saying that it's pretty easy to develop for.

834
00:58:30,822 --> 00:58:45,653
[SPEAKER_08]: This is from an interview with Nintendo Gamer Magazine where some of the folks from Teen Ninja said that they're finding it very similar to develop for Wii U as for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, which is no surprise if it's true what we've heard about the hardware in the past.

835
00:58:45,733 --> 00:58:49,616
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very similar to just kind of an overdrived Xbox, basically.

836
00:58:50,017 --> 00:58:51,238
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what Nintendo Wii U is supposed to be.

837
00:58:52,498 --> 00:58:55,461
[SPEAKER_08]: They also said that the Wii U hardware keeps changing.

838
00:58:56,381 --> 00:59:02,787
[SPEAKER_08]: That echoes statements that were made by Yoshinori Ono from Capcom last week.

839
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:07,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently said something very similar, that the Wii U keeps changing some of the hardware.

840
00:59:09,752 --> 00:59:14,536
[SPEAKER_08]: They're asking these developers from Teen Ninja what they want from the hardware and for feedback.

841
00:59:15,257 --> 00:59:17,759
[SPEAKER_08]: They keep listening, making changes and so forth.

842
00:59:17,779 --> 00:59:19,200
[SPEAKER_08]: The hardware keeps changing.

843
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,763
[SPEAKER_08]: What we don't know is what is changing about the hardware.

844
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:31,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Now my thought is, I wouldn't take the hardware is changing to mean suddenly this system is not going to have the tablet or any of that stuff.

845
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:32,972
[SPEAKER_08]: That's here to stay.

846
00:59:33,352 --> 00:59:35,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Like that isn't going anywhere, right?

847
00:59:35,213 --> 00:59:38,696
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're either... They're too well, they've gone all in on that.

848
00:59:38,877 --> 00:59:44,201
[SPEAKER_08]: So after last year's E3, they can't suddenly come out and say, well, we decided to scrap the tablet, ha ha.

849
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:45,082
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, right?

850
00:59:46,667 --> 00:59:48,450
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just changing what's inside.

851
00:59:48,490 --> 00:59:50,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they don't fucking know.

852
00:59:50,293 --> 00:59:57,886
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like, well, we've got this box that represents... Just imagine, if you will, a console that will do amazing things.

853
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Imagine it because we don't have one yet.

854
01:00:01,301 --> 01:00:03,422
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just this box that's sitting here.

855
01:00:04,442 --> 01:00:09,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's about time to commit because in a couple months they're going to have to show that to the world.

856
01:00:09,664 --> 01:00:13,286
[SPEAKER_08]: If they want to get that thing out this year, it's got to be at E3 and it's got to be good.

857
01:00:15,207 --> 01:00:15,847
[SPEAKER_09]: It better be.

858
01:00:16,267 --> 01:00:16,907
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm telling you.

859
01:00:18,468 --> 01:00:23,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Although if Team Ninja is developing for this, that means that you know where the next Dead or Alive game is going to show up.

860
01:00:23,806 --> 01:00:24,746
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I think it's Ninja Gaiden.

861
01:00:24,766 --> 01:00:26,247
[SPEAKER_09]: They already said they were going to have a Ninja Gaiden.

862
01:00:26,267 --> 01:00:27,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's right.

863
01:00:27,547 --> 01:00:27,887
[SPEAKER_09]: They did.

864
01:00:28,047 --> 01:00:29,508
[SPEAKER_09]: It was basically a port of Ninja Gaiden 3.

865
01:00:30,088 --> 01:00:32,109
[SPEAKER_08]: And Team Ninja and Nintendo have a little history.

866
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:37,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Team Ninja did the Metroid Other M game, which, although it didn't sell very well, it wasn't a bad game by any means.

867
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:38,111
[SPEAKER_08]: It was pretty neat.

868
01:00:38,371 --> 01:00:38,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

869
01:00:41,011 --> 01:00:41,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

870
01:00:44,968 --> 01:00:47,029
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope they all fuck it up, I'm just saying.

871
01:00:47,089 --> 01:00:59,214
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think I'm hopeful that it'll be a good system, but... Just say the HG Mario and HZ Zelda game will be out this Christmas and it'll print money.

872
01:00:59,474 --> 01:00:59,854
[SPEAKER_08]: It will.

873
01:01:00,414 --> 01:01:01,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep our fingers crossed.

874
01:01:01,335 --> 01:01:05,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo just has to put those key franchises on it and that's really what's gonna drive the system.

875
01:01:05,596 --> 01:01:07,397
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you doubt what I'm saying...

876
01:01:08,497 --> 01:01:09,318
[SPEAKER_08]: 3DS.

877
01:01:10,258 --> 01:01:18,182
[SPEAKER_08]: That thing did not start selling until they put the Zelda remake on it and then sold a little bit and then when they put Mario Kart 7 and 3D Land on it, boom!

878
01:01:18,322 --> 01:01:19,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it's selling tons.

879
01:01:19,923 --> 01:01:20,963
[SPEAKER_08]: And when they dropped the price.

880
01:01:21,583 --> 01:01:22,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, that too.

881
01:01:23,404 --> 01:01:23,844
[SPEAKER_07]: That helped.

882
01:01:23,904 --> 01:01:25,085
[SPEAKER_08]: That did have a little bit to do with it.

883
01:01:27,116 --> 01:01:30,339
[SPEAKER_08]: But well, then the price point is certainly important for the Wii U as well.

884
01:01:30,399 --> 01:01:32,561
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if they get up on stage and say, Wii U is $599 US dollars.

885
01:01:32,581 --> 01:01:32,561
$599.

886
01:01:32,601 --> 01:01:33,181
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

887
01:01:33,221 --> 01:01:33,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Ridge Racer.

888
01:01:33,522 --> 01:01:33,502
$299.

889
01:01:33,542 --> 01:01:34,282
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got to be $299, right?

890
01:01:34,302 --> 01:01:34,763
[SPEAKER_08]: No higher than $299.

891
01:01:34,803 --> 01:01:36,224
[SPEAKER_08]: It can't be higher than $299.

892
01:01:36,264 --> 01:01:36,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

893
01:01:36,384 --> 01:01:36,664
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

894
01:01:51,269 --> 01:01:52,149
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't even want it to be $2.99.

895
01:01:52,369 --> 01:01:54,270
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even see it being $2.99.

896
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:57,891
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't know.

897
01:01:59,131 --> 01:01:59,551
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

898
01:01:59,652 --> 01:02:02,653
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, by the time we get there, I mean, the other consoles could be lower.

899
01:02:04,893 --> 01:02:09,515
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to be sitting back and watching what happens because...

900
01:02:11,431 --> 01:02:12,192
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

901
01:02:12,212 --> 01:02:15,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do they just say the games will only be $40 as opposed to $60?

902
01:02:15,574 --> 01:02:16,775
[SPEAKER_08]: That would go a long way.

903
01:02:16,795 --> 01:02:18,756
[SPEAKER_08]: That would go a very long way.

904
01:02:19,877 --> 01:02:20,657
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, anyhow.

905
01:02:21,858 --> 01:02:30,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Breakman in our chatroom at chat.orangelandreda.com says, I hope they change the name from Wii U to something else that would be easier for me to make penis jokes for it.

906
01:02:30,284 --> 01:02:33,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there was some rumors last week that they are going to change the name.

907
01:02:33,466 --> 01:02:36,168
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how much that will, you know,

908
01:02:38,007 --> 01:02:44,469
[SPEAKER_08]: RDG Singenar Chatroom says, Anyway, it's probably three GameCubes duct taped together.

909
01:02:45,309 --> 01:02:49,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so you were curious on Rocksmith sales.

910
01:02:49,310 --> 01:02:50,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

911
01:02:51,251 --> 01:02:52,531
[SPEAKER_09]: 350,000 copies in the US on 360.

912
01:02:53,792 --> 01:02:58,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically a total of 610,000 copies.

913
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:04,395
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty... For what's essentially a really niche title, I really consider that that's pretty darn good.

914
01:03:05,075 --> 01:03:05,415
[SPEAKER_08]: I think.

915
01:03:06,015 --> 01:03:06,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

916
01:03:06,576 --> 01:03:06,756
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

917
01:03:07,916 --> 01:03:11,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, anyhow, let's move on.

918
01:03:12,059 --> 01:03:12,599
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.

919
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:21,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in other news, there is a proposition to put a 1% tax on violent video games.

920
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:23,347
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, stupid.

921
01:03:24,067 --> 01:03:27,970
[SPEAKER_05]: This is actually coming from Oklahoma, which, it's Oklahoma.

922
01:03:29,691 --> 01:03:30,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Oklahoma wins.

923
01:03:32,466 --> 01:03:53,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, it was introduced by State Representative William Forkiller Great name, Forkiller F-O-U-R-K-I-L-L-E-R That any title that's rated teen, mature, and adult only would fall under that spectrum That's the game that Team Ninja is making for the Wii U actually is Forkiller, go figure But you know what else that would include?

924
01:03:54,503 --> 01:03:57,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Dance Central 2 And Final Fantasy XIII 2

925
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:05,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, because those games are rated T for teen because of, um, what, language and all that stuff, right?

926
01:04:05,867 --> 01:04:06,367
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess.

927
01:04:07,488 --> 01:04:10,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but he wants to donate- Somebody said hell in 13.2.

928
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:11,851
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, oh, no, she didn't.

929
01:04:12,291 --> 01:04:16,474
[SPEAKER_05]: But the, um, well, what about all the crap they said in 7?

930
01:04:16,514 --> 01:04:21,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Barret said shit and- Well, anyway- Has anyone ever dropped the F-bomb in a Final Fantasy game?

931
01:04:21,857 --> 01:04:22,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy fuck?

932
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:25,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I finish?

933
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:25,820
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

934
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:26,881
Okay.

935
01:04:28,317 --> 01:04:41,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, half of the revenues would go to donate the Childhood Outdoor Education Revolving Fund, which is basically making kids get outside and play.

936
01:04:42,802 --> 01:04:46,143
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other half is the Bully Prevention Revolving Fund.

937
01:04:49,204 --> 01:04:55,186
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a good heart behind it, but I think that it's...

938
01:04:59,299 --> 01:05:00,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, okay, actually here's a good quote on here.

939
01:05:01,261 --> 01:05:06,227
[SPEAKER_05]: From the senior designer of Mass Effect 3, that's Manvir Hare, I guess.

940
01:05:06,968 --> 01:05:09,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Oklahoma proposes a 1% tax on violent games.

941
01:05:10,132 --> 01:05:14,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I propose a 1% tax on stupid fucking ideas that are also unconstitutional?

942
01:05:15,942 --> 01:05:17,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, this is going to be a losing battle.

943
01:05:18,202 --> 01:05:19,503
[SPEAKER_08]: We've already seen this stuff.

944
01:05:19,863 --> 01:05:24,944
[SPEAKER_08]: You heard us go off last week on the whole California has to pay the ESA of the Supreme Court thing.

945
01:05:25,324 --> 01:05:26,644
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do get what you're saying.

946
01:05:26,704 --> 01:05:31,685
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it is like, you know, at the core of it, it's nice that he's trying to do something for charity, I guess.

947
01:05:32,285 --> 01:05:33,485
[SPEAKER_08]: But this just speaks clearly.

948
01:05:33,505 --> 01:05:35,365
[SPEAKER_09]: No one's asking him to do anything for charity.

949
01:05:35,545 --> 01:05:36,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, it's that.

950
01:05:36,566 --> 01:05:41,286
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you really want to tax violence, put a 1% tax on guns.

951
01:05:41,987 --> 01:05:44,607
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, put it on something that's across the board.

952
01:05:44,927 --> 01:05:47,130
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say this.

953
01:05:48,231 --> 01:05:54,538
[SPEAKER_05]: To say that guns cause violence is the same thing that says pencils cause bad spelling.

954
01:05:54,638 --> 01:05:56,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Then put a 1% tax on pencils.

955
01:05:56,901 --> 01:05:59,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Put the tax on a gun license.

956
01:05:59,924 --> 01:06:00,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, fine.

957
01:06:01,005 --> 01:06:03,446
[SPEAKER_08]: But the thing is, at least that's kind of constant.

958
01:06:04,326 --> 01:06:10,549
[SPEAKER_08]: But to put a 1% tax on a subset of video games strikes me as very odd.

959
01:06:10,749 --> 01:06:13,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you put a 1% tax on R-rated movies?

960
01:06:14,011 --> 01:06:17,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you put a 1% tax on... Well, no, because we're afraid of the MPAA.

961
01:06:17,652 --> 01:06:21,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you put a tax on 1% books that are not for young adults or children?

962
01:06:21,955 --> 01:06:29,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, would you put a 1% tax on the, you know, I don't know, entire fiction section of Barnes & Noble?

963
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:31,939
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to put a 1% tax on contraceptives.

964
01:06:31,979 --> 01:06:36,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you put a 1% tax on parental advisory labels on CDs?

965
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:37,500
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, no.

966
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:40,681
[SPEAKER_08]: This is all – it's ridiculous in practice.

967
01:06:40,761 --> 01:06:49,164
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just – and it's somebody who – that just speaks – it's a big surprise, a politician who doesn't get video games, but it just really speaks to somebody.

968
01:06:49,204 --> 01:06:49,424
[SPEAKER_08]: And then –

969
01:06:50,484 --> 01:06:51,065
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

970
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:23,147
[SPEAKER_05]: he's basically trying to do the same thing that all these other places have done to curtail the sale of these video games by making them more expensive by putting a tax on it and sugarcoating it with the oh but this is going to do all this good if this goes by he's trying to trick the gullible which unfortunately most of the public is sorry

971
01:07:24,447 --> 01:07:43,116
[SPEAKER_09]: and you know those violent video games they pack on the pounds I'm telling you if I'm not like you know killing people in a game I'm just losing weight because um yeah I don't understand the argument that you know putting attacks on teen rated and up games is gonna somehow get kids to be slimmer

972
01:07:45,637 --> 01:07:52,724
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you actually missed what I said about that.

973
01:07:53,825 --> 01:08:01,231
[SPEAKER_05]: He said that the proceeds were going to be in half donated to services that get children to go outside and exercise.

974
01:08:02,202 --> 01:08:03,904
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the thing.

975
01:08:03,964 --> 01:08:11,214
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of like it's indirectly for the children because I'm tying this nice little charity and all the money is going to go to good.

976
01:08:11,354 --> 01:08:13,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you tax them like 500%?

977
01:08:13,557 --> 01:08:16,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Then they can't afford the games and they'll go out and exercise.

978
01:08:16,862 --> 01:08:18,184
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the charities will get a ton of money.

979
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:23,567
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't understand, why do we need a program to get people to go outside?

980
01:08:23,587 --> 01:08:25,107
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, is it that bad?

981
01:08:25,288 --> 01:08:26,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't parents do their fucking job?

982
01:08:27,429 --> 01:08:27,909
[SPEAKER_05]: End of story.

983
01:08:28,809 --> 01:08:29,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Parents, do your job.

984
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:31,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Your kids are fat, send them outside.

985
01:08:32,211 --> 01:08:32,571
[SPEAKER_05]: The end.

986
01:08:32,892 --> 01:08:34,973
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I did when I was bored when I was a kid?

987
01:08:35,493 --> 01:08:36,494
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had a Nintendo?

988
01:08:37,054 --> 01:08:37,894
[SPEAKER_05]: I went and rode my bike.

989
01:08:38,655 --> 01:08:39,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Uphill.

990
01:08:39,355 --> 01:08:39,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Twice.

991
01:08:40,115 --> 01:08:40,596
[SPEAKER_05]: In the snow?

992
01:08:40,976 --> 01:08:41,136
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

993
01:08:41,356 --> 01:08:42,917
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't have snow in Alabama, what are you talking about?

994
01:08:43,717 --> 01:08:44,458
[SPEAKER_05]: In the swamp!

995
01:08:44,958 --> 01:08:46,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is worse than the snow.

996
01:08:46,279 --> 01:08:50,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Or even better, I mean, like, stop feeding your kids their sugary foods or whatever.

997
01:08:50,863 --> 01:08:52,244
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, get them to go outside.

998
01:08:52,284 --> 01:08:52,924
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, come on.

999
01:08:53,405 --> 01:08:56,407
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of contributing factors for people getting overweight.

1000
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:58,288
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not because you're just playing video games.

1001
01:08:58,849 --> 01:09:02,031
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because you're eating like shit and you're sitting around doing nothing.

1002
01:09:02,191 --> 01:09:03,012
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, kids?

1003
01:09:03,172 --> 01:09:06,214
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to lose weight, you just need to have more unprotected sex.

1004
01:09:07,655 --> 01:09:08,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Sexercise.

1005
01:09:09,617 --> 01:09:10,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Sexercise.

1006
01:09:13,345 --> 01:09:14,326
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura's left the room

1007
01:09:36,715 --> 01:09:46,562
[SPEAKER_09]: But we were just talking about... So, let's talk a little bit about our favorite topic, at least it has been the last few weeks.

1008
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:51,985
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is, quote, you know, online passes.

1009
01:09:52,445 --> 01:10:03,130
[SPEAKER_09]: and I kind of wonder if they don't understand what the online pass thing means because they're putting it on games that don't have online portions to them.

1010
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:07,452
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not putting it on games that have online portions to them.

1011
01:10:07,512 --> 01:10:08,932
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not locking people out.

1012
01:10:09,773 --> 01:10:10,613
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't understand.

1013
01:10:11,173 --> 01:10:17,177
[SPEAKER_09]: So first off, SSX, a big extreme sports game coming out from EA.

1014
01:10:17,457 --> 01:10:18,438
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to have an online pass.

1015
01:10:18,498 --> 01:10:21,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a big surprise because they have a big online portion of it.

1016
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:29,566
[SPEAKER_09]: What's kind of neat about it, though, is that the online pass, if you do not have it, will not lock people out of playing multiplayer.

1017
01:10:29,946 --> 01:10:34,589
[SPEAKER_09]: You just won't get any of the in-game credits used to unlock content while playing multiplayer.

1018
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:36,891
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of cool.

1019
01:10:37,091 --> 01:10:39,132
[SPEAKER_09]: You can at least play with your friends still if you have it used.

1020
01:10:39,613 --> 01:10:39,793
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

1021
01:10:42,066 --> 01:10:46,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, you mean to say that some companies find the value in not having an online pass?

1022
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:50,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, come on, this is the same company that just put an online pass on an offline game.

1023
01:10:50,409 --> 01:10:50,670
[SPEAKER_09]: True.

1024
01:10:52,010 --> 01:10:59,493
[SPEAKER_09]: And to be fair, that wasn't really an online pass, that was just, you know, free DLC that they labeled something completely stupid.

1025
01:10:59,553 --> 01:11:02,394
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like, you know, instead of saying, ooh, free gift, it was like...

1026
01:11:03,928 --> 01:11:06,149
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, pay money or get raped.

1027
01:11:06,329 --> 01:11:13,051
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's like, you know, not... If you just called it a free gift, it wouldn't have sounded so bad.

1028
01:11:13,111 --> 01:11:14,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Why'd you call it get raped?

1029
01:11:14,471 --> 01:11:15,772
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that doesn't make any sense.

1030
01:11:15,812 --> 01:11:16,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Why would you do that?

1031
01:11:17,892 --> 01:11:23,734
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're doing that for SSX, and so if you don't want to buy the game, or if you rent it, you can still play online.

1032
01:11:23,754 --> 01:11:30,436
[SPEAKER_09]: You just won't be able to unlock your little tokens or shit for your downloading or unlocking in-game things.

1033
01:11:30,456 --> 01:11:30,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Big deal.

1034
01:11:31,697 --> 01:11:31,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

1035
01:11:32,817 --> 01:11:39,664
[SPEAKER_09]: However, what's kind of weird though is a co-op shooter, Syndicate, also coming out from EA, is not going to have an online pass at all.

1036
01:11:40,866 --> 01:11:42,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Just, eh, whatever reason.

1037
01:11:42,828 --> 01:11:46,512
[SPEAKER_09]: They say we want little resistance or barriers to entry as possible.

1038
01:11:49,557 --> 01:11:55,581
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a lot of guys say that too I had to come back in the room, didn't I?

1039
01:11:56,441 --> 01:12:03,125
[SPEAKER_09]: The co-op is equal billing in this We wanted everyone who owns a copy of the game to have access to the entire product

1040
01:12:03,612 --> 01:12:04,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, now, that's fair.

1041
01:12:04,312 --> 01:12:10,236
[SPEAKER_08]: If they recognize that, like, the core element of their game is the online part, you don't fucking gate it behind a pass.

1042
01:12:11,277 --> 01:12:11,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?

1043
01:12:12,678 --> 01:12:19,362
[SPEAKER_09]: But yet they do for Battlefield 3, for Madden, for, you know, NBA.

1044
01:12:19,622 --> 01:12:20,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they don't have an NBA game.

1045
01:12:20,823 --> 01:12:23,425
[SPEAKER_09]: But when they do have another NBA game, probably this year.

1046
01:12:23,445 --> 01:12:24,465
[SPEAKER_08]: NBA Jam might have one.

1047
01:12:26,046 --> 01:12:29,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, because the Xbox 360 and PS3 are already online only.

1048
01:12:29,489 --> 01:12:30,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so.

1049
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:32,471
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Wii online.

1050
01:12:32,551 --> 01:12:33,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Ha, ha, ha.

1051
01:12:35,137 --> 01:12:36,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Need for Speed.

1052
01:12:36,418 --> 01:12:39,000
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, all this shit had these online passes.

1053
01:12:39,381 --> 01:12:42,323
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do like the direction they're going.

1054
01:12:42,604 --> 01:12:49,029
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to fucking have, every time that they have a goddamn online pass, the EA says, yeah, we stand behind this online pass.

1055
01:12:49,129 --> 01:12:51,011
[SPEAKER_09]: I want them to fucking quote what they said.

1056
01:12:51,331 --> 01:12:53,973
[SPEAKER_09]: We want as little resistance or barriers to entry as possible.

1057
01:12:54,414 --> 01:13:01,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's really what you're doing is you're telling people, yeah, we only watch you, the player games, if you have the money to buy it new.

1058
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:02,941
[SPEAKER_09]: If not, we don't really give a fuck.

1059
01:13:03,461 --> 01:13:06,825
[SPEAKER_09]: We want you to go away because you cost us too much money to run our servers.

1060
01:13:10,668 --> 01:13:11,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1061
01:13:13,111 --> 01:13:14,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'll come back.

1062
01:13:14,712 --> 01:13:18,596
[SPEAKER_09]: There was something I was going to rant about this week.

1063
01:13:18,616 --> 01:13:19,757
[SPEAKER_09]: I just reminded myself.

1064
01:13:19,957 --> 01:13:20,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, goody.

1065
01:13:22,279 --> 01:13:24,681
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it was something along the lines of this online pass thing.

1066
01:13:25,242 --> 01:13:26,243
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get to that later.

1067
01:13:28,132 --> 01:13:32,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, is there another story coming up later that's going to prompt that?

1068
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:37,656
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think so, but it was something I posted on Twitter, and I had to refresh my memory.

1069
01:13:37,676 --> 01:13:39,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Just explode on the rant at a random point in the show.

1070
01:13:39,597 --> 01:13:43,459
[SPEAKER_09]: It was something about how used games steal money from developers, I think it was.

1071
01:13:43,479 --> 01:13:44,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yes, oh yes.

1072
01:13:44,399 --> 01:13:45,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, look, well moving on.

1073
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:52,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Old games still give money to the folks that own the rights to them these days.

1074
01:13:52,742 --> 01:13:55,863
[SPEAKER_08]: And old games will suddenly become new again on the 3DS.

1075
01:13:56,003 --> 01:13:58,164
[SPEAKER_08]: And the old games are coming from the Game Gear.

1076
01:13:58,684 --> 01:13:59,044
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

1077
01:13:59,084 --> 01:14:12,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, virtual console games for a non-Nintendo platform, of course, in this case Sega, have shown up for 3DS release by the good old ESRB, who has spoiled the releases of Shinobi and Sonic Triple Trouble.

1078
01:14:13,128 --> 01:14:14,809
[SPEAKER_08]: So those games apparently have been spotted.

1079
01:14:15,089 --> 01:14:42,056
[SPEAKER_08]: To be fair, the ESRB Remember that one of the things that they could do That the publishers could tell them Not to list their stuff on there So it's the fucking publisher's fault Yeah, they might have forgot to check that box in the forum, who knows Now, it's worth noting that at some point TurboGrafx-16 games Were supposed to be available on the 3DS But who knows if that's really going to happen anymore At some point, because there's no more Hudson Well, doesn't Konami Inherently own all their old licenses Or am I wrong?

1080
01:14:43,559 --> 01:14:49,625
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura is going to bitch slap me for this, but were there really any that good Game Gear games?

1081
01:14:49,645 --> 01:14:49,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1082
01:14:49,765 --> 01:14:49,845
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1083
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:01,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Gunstar Heroes.

1084
01:15:02,221 --> 01:15:03,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that really a Game Gear game?

1085
01:15:03,783 --> 01:15:05,284
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought it for Dan for $30.

1086
01:15:06,125 --> 01:15:07,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's right.

1087
01:15:07,206 --> 01:15:07,727
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember that.

1088
01:15:07,787 --> 01:15:08,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1089
01:15:09,328 --> 01:15:12,271
[SPEAKER_05]: There were really good... I think there was Puyo Puyo.

1090
01:15:12,731 --> 01:15:14,453
[SPEAKER_05]: There was Sonic Spinball.

1091
01:15:15,214 --> 01:15:18,257
[SPEAKER_05]: The Lion King game, of all things, was actually really good on Game Gear.

1092
01:15:19,013 --> 01:15:20,934
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, there were a lot of really good games.

1093
01:15:20,954 --> 01:15:27,698
[SPEAKER_08]: The Disney games on Genesis and all that stuff, like Aladdin and shit, were really good.

1094
01:15:28,519 --> 01:15:33,622
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like an interesting phase where Sega and Disney just kind of had this really great harmony going on.

1095
01:15:33,982 --> 01:15:39,385
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I do recall correctly, I think there were a number of Master System games that were converted for Game Gear use, so...

1096
01:15:40,379 --> 01:15:44,043
[SPEAKER_08]: All I remember are that those things were so fucking huge and just drained your batteries.

1097
01:15:44,504 --> 01:15:47,307
[SPEAKER_08]: But now, you know, the 3DS will drain your battery.

1098
01:15:48,188 --> 01:15:49,129
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be about as fast.

1099
01:15:49,710 --> 01:15:53,134
[SPEAKER_08]: But at least you can recharge your 3DS without having to go buy AA batteries.

1100
01:15:54,736 --> 01:15:57,940
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura is going to read us a story and then we're going to get to the release dates.

1101
01:15:58,846 --> 01:16:11,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Once upon a time, there was a game called Skyrim, and everyone was like, oh my god, the menu sucks, so people hacked it and put out little ads for it on PC.

1102
01:16:11,693 --> 01:16:18,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, finally, the people at Bethesda were like, I guess people really don't like how we do this and want different stuff for the game.

1103
01:16:19,657 --> 01:16:26,961
[SPEAKER_05]: So, there is a PC creation kit coming out for The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim, and it will be on Steam on Tuesday.

1104
01:16:28,683 --> 01:16:39,300
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, it's, uh, you can apparently just download it in the tools tab, so I guess people will be happy for it.

1105
01:16:40,014 --> 01:16:43,276
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm slowly starting to regret not getting Skyrim on the PC.

1106
01:16:43,757 --> 01:16:46,338
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish a lot of these cool things would come to the PlayStation 3.

1107
01:16:46,599 --> 01:16:47,899
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought some of it was supposed to.

1108
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:49,280
[SPEAKER_08]: I could be wrong, though.

1109
01:16:50,141 --> 01:16:53,443
[SPEAKER_08]: But Alan, he's in there playing Skyrim right now.

1110
01:16:53,503 --> 01:16:54,804
[SPEAKER_08]: He's hacked the shit out of that game.

1111
01:16:56,625 --> 01:16:58,647
[SPEAKER_08]: He's still playing by the rules, mostly.

1112
01:16:58,727 --> 01:17:00,088
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think he's really cheated a lot.

1113
01:17:00,448 --> 01:17:03,670
[SPEAKER_08]: But his interface doesn't even look right to me.

1114
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:06,272
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's really well organized.

1115
01:17:06,312 --> 01:17:06,772
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it.

1116
01:17:06,832 --> 01:17:09,294
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like he's done so many hacks to it.

1117
01:17:09,434 --> 01:17:12,516
[SPEAKER_05]: How many of us have WoW that look exactly like it did when we first got it?

1118
01:17:12,656 --> 01:17:13,536
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true, that's true.

1119
01:17:13,576 --> 01:17:18,819
[SPEAKER_08]: But that is something that Blizzard embraces, and that's part of why it's better than a lot of MMOs, by the way.

1120
01:17:19,239 --> 01:17:25,563
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, let's travel around the world and look at release dates and talk about games that you'll be able to hack soon in a store near you.

1121
01:17:26,283 --> 01:17:27,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, we'll start with the US dates.

1122
01:17:28,024 --> 01:17:30,025
[SPEAKER_09]: There's actually some stuff this week.

1123
01:17:30,365 --> 01:17:31,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Not really a...

1124
01:17:32,966 --> 01:17:34,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1125
01:17:51,635 --> 01:17:56,217
[SPEAKER_09]: The Darkness 2 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC as well.

1126
01:17:56,758 --> 01:18:01,081
[SPEAKER_09]: The Jak and Daxter Collection for PS3 will be coming out.

1127
01:18:01,741 --> 01:18:09,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Resident Evil Revelations with an extra I, at least on the packaging.

1128
01:18:09,726 --> 01:18:13,008
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's coming out on 3DS only.

1129
01:18:14,209 --> 01:18:17,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC as

1130
01:18:21,473 --> 01:18:26,975
[SPEAKER_09]: We also have the Zumba Fitness Rush on Xbox 360.

1131
01:18:27,955 --> 01:18:29,575
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll be out on Sunday.

1132
01:18:31,316 --> 01:18:35,537
[SPEAKER_09]: And, yeah, that's it.

1133
01:18:36,097 --> 01:18:42,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and as I remember, remind you, the 3DS Circle Pad Pro will be out in GameStop.

1134
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:46,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

1135
01:18:46,658 --> 01:18:47,279
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm irritated.

1136
01:18:48,541 --> 01:18:51,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any chance if I wait it out it'll come to another retailer?

1137
01:18:54,649 --> 01:18:58,134
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess there's nothing I need it for right now, so I'm just gonna hold my breath.

1138
01:18:59,335 --> 01:18:59,955
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1139
01:19:29,321 --> 01:19:31,463
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to see what... That hasn't come out over there yet?

1140
01:19:32,123 --> 01:19:32,764
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I guess not.

1141
01:19:32,904 --> 01:19:33,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Surprised.

1142
01:19:33,605 --> 01:19:35,026
[SPEAKER_08]: It came out over here back in October.

1143
01:19:35,286 --> 01:19:36,347
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's a price reduction.

1144
01:19:36,767 --> 01:19:37,928
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's definitely not a price reduction.

1145
01:19:37,948 --> 01:19:39,770
[SPEAKER_08]: It might be like a localized version for them.

1146
01:19:41,071 --> 01:19:42,733
[SPEAKER_08]: So, interesting.

1147
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:45,235
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, that's coming out this week.

1148
01:19:47,421 --> 01:19:49,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, sometimes they get the games a little later than we do, you know?

1149
01:19:51,142 --> 01:19:56,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, the PlayStation Vita Vita Vegman's already out in Japan, so they have some new games this week.

1150
01:19:56,825 --> 01:20:02,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Gravity Days comes out this week, and Sumiyomi, I think I'm saying that right, comes out this week on the Vita.

1151
01:20:03,007 --> 01:20:07,789
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to see if this is a game... I'm trying to see if this looks familiar to me.

1152
01:20:07,809 --> 01:20:13,651
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking at a little trailer for Sumiyomi here in the studio to see if it's one that I recognized.

1153
01:20:16,044 --> 01:20:17,345
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the art style in this game.

1154
01:20:18,206 --> 01:20:19,928
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little bit like Okami.

1155
01:20:20,248 --> 01:20:24,412
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen the... Oh, it's an ink game.

1156
01:20:24,512 --> 01:20:26,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Sumie is a type of drawing with ink.

1157
01:20:28,316 --> 01:20:30,919
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw this when they were talking about Vita stuff.

1158
01:20:30,939 --> 01:20:33,021
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually saw the video for it.

1159
01:20:33,041 --> 01:20:35,183
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember what it's being called over here, though.

1160
01:20:36,264 --> 01:20:40,327
[SPEAKER_08]: That game is coming out this week in Japan because they already have the Vita over there.

1161
01:20:42,789 --> 01:20:48,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Looking at the other handheld real quick, I'm just going to look really quickly at the Wii, see if there's anything worth mentioning.

1162
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:48,253
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1163
01:20:49,494 --> 01:20:50,675
[SPEAKER_08]: How about the 3DS though?

1164
01:20:51,476 --> 01:20:51,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really.

1165
01:20:52,256 --> 01:20:53,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing until the 14th.

1166
01:20:53,397 --> 01:20:58,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Nude Love Plus comes out on the 14th with plenty of art book limited editions if you want to check that out.

1167
01:20:58,541 --> 01:21:01,363
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought for a second there you said Nude Love Plus.

1168
01:21:02,044 --> 01:21:02,184
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1169
01:21:02,224 --> 01:21:03,665
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be a whole different 3DS game right there.

1170
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:07,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that does it for Japanese releases.

1171
01:21:07,747 --> 01:21:08,267
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura?

1172
01:21:09,748 --> 01:21:20,930
[SPEAKER_05]: In the UK, on the 7th, we have Combat Wings, The Great Battles of World War II, Gotham City Imposters, House of the Dead 3, and The Simpsons Arcade for PS3.

1173
01:21:21,690 --> 01:21:25,291
[SPEAKER_05]: On the 8th of February, we have more Gotham City crap.

1174
01:21:26,191 --> 01:21:28,072
[SPEAKER_05]: On the 9th, we have Cell Emergence.

1175
01:21:28,272 --> 01:21:31,912
[SPEAKER_05]: On the 10th, Catherine for Xbox 360 and PS3.

1176
01:21:32,473 --> 01:21:34,013
[SPEAKER_05]: That game is messed up.

1177
01:21:34,833 --> 01:21:45,739
[SPEAKER_05]: EA Sports Grand Slam Tennis 2, Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning, Mario and Sonic at the London Olympic Games on 3DS, One Piece Unlimited Crew Special, and The Darkness 2.

1178
01:21:45,959 --> 01:21:48,080
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1179
01:21:49,575 --> 01:21:53,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Alrighty, just a couple more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.

1180
01:21:53,776 --> 01:22:11,542
[SPEAKER_09]: But first... So, there's some talk saying, you know, Iwata is actually interested in doing some, you know, microtransactions with the Wii U. One of the pieces of technology that they may be incorporating for the Wii U is...

1181
01:22:12,302 --> 01:22:13,904
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1182
01:22:33,207 --> 01:22:37,571
[SPEAKER_09]: or Skylanders.

1183
01:22:37,591 --> 01:22:41,193
[SPEAKER_09]: They're saying that it can provide a system in which consumers can use e-money.

1184
01:22:42,174 --> 01:22:53,042
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll find it much more easily to be able to make payments by entering credit card numbers or by purchasing Nintendo prepaid cards at the store.

1185
01:22:54,809 --> 01:23:04,750
[SPEAKER_09]: um you know of course they're you know trying to support DLC but they want to do it in a way that's not you know crazy

1186
01:23:06,288 --> 01:23:18,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, they're throwing out the idea that maybe Super Mario Land 3D or Mario Kart may get DLC, which I would be happy with that.

1187
01:23:18,558 --> 01:23:19,538
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they should do that.

1188
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:25,083
[SPEAKER_09]: What if we could provide add-on content through the network?

1189
01:23:26,023 --> 01:23:31,047
[SPEAKER_09]: As I referred to before, for example... Like everyone else does?

1190
01:23:31,147 --> 01:23:31,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, for example...

1191
01:23:32,268 --> 01:24:01,173
[SPEAKER_09]: this idea of supplying new stages to Super Mario users who want to play the game more but have completed the game and lost interest in existing stages this will not only give us new profits but then lengthen the life of the product and that it will never appear to be out of fashion and can keep attracting public attention as long as many people play no shit people have been doing this for fucking years now and you just figured this out oh my god

1192
01:24:02,293 --> 01:24:03,274
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fantastic.

1193
01:24:03,674 --> 01:24:12,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I can't wait to see what breakthrough ideas will come with the Wii U. Hey, guys, we're going to have this thing called online.

1194
01:24:12,976 --> 01:24:16,737
[SPEAKER_08]: People can play without being in the same room.

1195
01:24:16,777 --> 01:24:27,901
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to admit, as behind the times as Nintendo is, there is almost that benefit to them being behind the times that you don't have this online pass garbage on any of the Nintendo games.

1196
01:24:27,921 --> 01:24:28,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you do.

1197
01:24:28,581 --> 01:24:28,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you?

1198
01:24:28,961 --> 01:24:29,001
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1199
01:24:29,241 --> 01:24:29,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you do.

1200
01:24:29,861 --> 01:24:30,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Which game?

1201
01:24:30,321 --> 01:24:30,561
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1202
01:24:31,241 --> 01:24:34,522
[SPEAKER_09]: You have the U-Pass that's on the... God, really?

1203
01:24:34,702 --> 01:24:43,224
[SPEAKER_09]: And the online passes do apply to the Wii games for Madden, for example, has online pass, I believe.

1204
01:24:43,664 --> 01:24:47,765
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just a lot of those core games don't end up... Well, then I stand corrected.

1205
01:24:47,945 --> 01:24:48,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1206
01:24:48,885 --> 01:24:51,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, they do have that stuff.

1207
01:24:51,465 --> 01:24:52,886
[SPEAKER_09]: They are not exempt from it.

1208
01:24:54,826 --> 01:24:59,328
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just that there's not a lot of big games that come out, so that's why you don't hear a lot of it.

1209
01:25:00,028 --> 01:25:01,528
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I mean, come on.

1210
01:25:01,868 --> 01:25:04,149
[SPEAKER_09]: They do these really amazing things sometimes.

1211
01:25:04,989 --> 01:25:08,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the 3D's kind of cool, and the motion controls and stuff like that.

1212
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:11,071
[SPEAKER_09]: At the same time, say, hey, we got this one cool thing.

1213
01:25:12,052 --> 01:25:14,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, but we forgot to totally update everything else.

1214
01:25:14,372 --> 01:25:16,833
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like, oh, shit, you guys want HD graphics?

1215
01:25:16,873 --> 01:25:17,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we didn't fucking do that.

1216
01:25:17,933 --> 01:25:18,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, online?

1217
01:25:18,494 --> 01:25:18,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Nah.

1218
01:25:19,194 --> 01:25:20,274
[SPEAKER_09]: But hey, you got motion controls.

1219
01:25:21,114 --> 01:25:21,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that what you wanted?

1220
01:25:21,895 --> 01:25:22,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Something new?

1221
01:25:22,975 --> 01:25:38,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey 3D, it's got 3D, that's awesome, DLC, ah fuck, well we just didn't do DLC yet, we're gonna patch it in later, I'm sure, you know, we will eventually, and we'll support it someday, you know, maybe, yeah, we'll put out another system or something that'll have DLC in there.

1222
01:25:41,488 --> 01:25:45,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me rephrase the point I made earlier since Loki owned me.

1223
01:25:47,211 --> 01:25:56,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Because most of the stuff worth buying on the Wii is from Nintendo themselves and Nintendo's buying the times, we don't have any of this online pass garbage.

1224
01:25:56,596 --> 01:25:56,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1225
01:25:57,077 --> 01:25:57,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1226
01:25:57,857 --> 01:25:58,918
[SPEAKER_08]: At least we can agree on that.

1227
01:25:59,978 --> 01:26:00,258
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1228
01:26:01,179 --> 01:26:04,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, congrats to Nintendo for getting on the DLC train, I guess.

1229
01:26:04,661 --> 01:26:06,442
[SPEAKER_08]: I just hope they don't go overboard with all this.

1230
01:26:06,862 --> 01:26:08,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we know how to charge people.

1231
01:26:08,023 --> 01:26:08,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.

1232
01:26:10,031 --> 01:26:19,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, sometimes your money just goes to these very interesting places where you just wish you'd never spent it in the first place.

1233
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:22,863
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's what a lot of Mass Effect fans are feeling this week.

1234
01:26:22,963 --> 01:26:24,905
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not talking about the game, don't worry.

1235
01:26:25,265 --> 01:26:27,387
[SPEAKER_08]: But I am talking about the spinoff book series.

1236
01:26:28,127 --> 01:26:33,251
[SPEAKER_08]: A book came out, I guess, I don't know if it was last week or about a month ago, called Mass Effect Deception.

1237
01:26:33,771 --> 01:26:37,434
[SPEAKER_08]: And apparently the book has just got tons and tons of errors.

1238
01:26:38,054 --> 01:26:43,999
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm talking like the type that, like if you're a lore nerd, are just like terribly bad errors.

1239
01:26:45,119 --> 01:26:50,563
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, oh, actually they have put together a document, I guess, online on Google.

1240
01:26:50,924 --> 01:26:52,325
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a pretty neat community idea.

1241
01:26:52,705 --> 01:26:53,425
[SPEAKER_08]: That has 80 errors.

1242
01:26:57,553 --> 01:26:58,215
[SPEAKER_08]: All together.

1243
01:26:58,736 --> 01:27:00,520
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to actually pull this up right now and see if...

1244
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:06,501
[SPEAKER_08]: They talk about like the Citadel is the wrong state.

1245
01:27:07,341 --> 01:27:18,165
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the characters kills an alien by slicing into the back of its neck and severing the spine, but you can't really do that with this type of alien because they're not biologically set up that way.

1246
01:27:18,225 --> 01:27:24,367
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like, it's almost like, you know how like when Star Trek kind of gets the canon wrong, the fans are up in arms?

1247
01:27:24,827 --> 01:27:26,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the whole series of Enterprise?

1248
01:27:26,628 --> 01:27:26,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1249
01:27:29,582 --> 01:27:56,410
[SPEAKER_08]: so like 80 different errors they've all put together and stuff and yeah timeline errors and things like that so apparently it's gotten to the point where Bioware actually came out and said the teams at Del Rey and Bioware would like to extend our sincerest apologies to the Mass Effect fans for any errors and oversights made in the recent novel Mass Effect Deception we are currently working on a number of changes that will appear in future editions of the novel

1250
01:27:57,867 --> 01:28:07,594
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how... So, in other words, it was all a dream, or alternate timeline, that whole book was an alternate universe, surprise!

1251
01:28:07,614 --> 01:28:10,256
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what happens when you write books like you write games.

1252
01:28:11,677 --> 01:28:12,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't fucking patch a book.

1253
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:16,361
[SPEAKER_09]: You cannot patch a book.

1254
01:28:17,562 --> 01:28:20,264
[SPEAKER_09]: You can, apparently, you just print it later, but...

1255
01:28:22,119 --> 01:28:23,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, that's another thing.

1256
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:26,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, the Wii, can't patch anything, so we better get it right the first time.

1257
01:28:26,884 --> 01:28:30,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Or we'll have to put out, no, because remember what they had to do for the Zelda save games?

1258
01:28:30,948 --> 01:28:34,511
[SPEAKER_08]: They had to put out the Zelda save game patching channel.

1259
01:28:39,636 --> 01:28:40,977
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to admit, that's kind of funny.

1260
01:28:41,638 --> 01:28:42,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of funny.

1261
01:28:42,319 --> 01:28:43,300
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of terrible.

1262
01:28:44,661 --> 01:28:46,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Always a hoot and a holler here on the show.

1263
01:28:48,569 --> 01:28:49,731
[SPEAKER_06]: The classic game of the week.

1264
01:28:51,853 --> 01:28:59,420
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura likes to dive into the classic gaming vault every week and pull out a game that she thinks, hey, back in my day, you didn't have patches.

1265
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:02,122
[SPEAKER_08]: You took your games glitchy and you liked it.

1266
01:29:02,622 --> 01:29:03,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1267
01:29:04,164 --> 01:29:06,546
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they were glitchy, they were collector's items.

1268
01:29:06,626 --> 01:29:07,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1269
01:29:09,008 --> 01:29:11,451
[SPEAKER_08]: So here it is, the classic game of the week.

1270
01:29:11,531 --> 01:29:12,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it a glitchy title?

1271
01:29:13,012 --> 01:29:13,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really.

1272
01:29:14,012 --> 01:29:15,233
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's full of bugs, right?

1273
01:29:15,753 --> 01:29:16,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Full of viruses.

1274
01:29:16,353 --> 01:29:18,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, what's the classic game of the week?

1275
01:29:18,254 --> 01:29:18,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Mario.

1276
01:29:19,974 --> 01:29:21,815
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a while since I've done a puzzle game, I think.

1277
01:29:21,915 --> 01:29:22,995
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had to do Dr. Mario.

1278
01:29:23,576 --> 01:29:25,776
[SPEAKER_08]: And stupid me didn't link the YouTube.

1279
01:29:25,976 --> 01:29:26,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Fail.

1280
01:29:26,957 --> 01:29:29,138
[SPEAKER_05]: It's alright.

1281
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:33,059
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll play the QT music and I'll bring in the Dr. Mario music when I can.

1282
01:29:33,479 --> 01:29:35,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Dr. Mario... I need a patch.

1283
01:29:36,122 --> 01:29:36,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Mario came out in 1990.

1284
01:29:37,043 --> 01:29:42,247
[SPEAKER_05]: It was designed by Gunpei Yokoi, and it was produced by Takahiro Harada.

1285
01:29:42,768 --> 01:29:47,092
[SPEAKER_05]: It came out on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and it was super fun.

1286
01:29:47,532 --> 01:29:50,715
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to play as Mario, who became a doctor.

1287
01:29:51,176 --> 01:29:52,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Plumber to doctor, go fig.

1288
01:29:53,158 --> 01:29:57,482
[SPEAKER_05]: And his point is to eradicate really, really deadly viruses.

1289
01:29:57,842 --> 01:29:58,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1290
01:30:14,049 --> 01:30:39,125
[SPEAKER_05]: and when you stack three of the same color on top of the virus then it destroys the virus and you keep going and oh my god I was good at this game I mean really good at this game I'm not kidding you had a max level of 20 that you could select and then you could just keep going from there and I could go into the I was really good at it and so humble too

1291
01:30:39,805 --> 01:30:43,668
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not gonna... A game's kind of hard not to be good at, you know?

1292
01:30:44,528 --> 01:30:47,410
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, unless you just have really awful reflexes.

1293
01:30:48,371 --> 01:30:54,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, there are all kinds of other versions, different ports and things that have come out, too.

1294
01:30:55,536 --> 01:30:59,518
[SPEAKER_05]: It was re-released on the Game Boy Advance as part of the Classic Nest series.

1295
01:31:00,459 --> 01:31:09,465
[SPEAKER_05]: And there were versions of it that was... There's a minigame in WarioWare Inc., Mega Micro Games, and Brain Age 2, more training in minutes a day.

1296
01:31:11,727 --> 01:31:14,609
[SPEAKER_05]: But let's see what else we have with this.

1297
01:31:14,669 --> 01:31:18,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you also have... Your playfield is a bottle.

1298
01:31:19,033 --> 01:31:20,634
[SPEAKER_05]: And so he's throwing it into a bottle.

1299
01:31:21,315 --> 01:31:23,597
[SPEAKER_05]: And you've got as much space as your bottle allows.

1300
01:31:23,757 --> 01:31:26,419
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, on screen, it's fairly small.

1301
01:31:26,739 --> 01:31:29,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially, man, on the 13-inch TV that I played on...

1302
01:31:31,014 --> 01:31:32,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Go blind playing that thing.

1303
01:31:32,555 --> 01:31:38,177
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's hear about some of the people that probably had problems that this game was pushing pills to kids.

1304
01:31:39,717 --> 01:31:42,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm sure I've heard that story somewhere before.

1305
01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:50,321
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you might not have it in front of you, but I know some fucking old ladies club probably complained.

1306
01:31:51,041 --> 01:31:53,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Mario teaches my kids about drugs.

1307
01:31:53,782 --> 01:31:55,343
[SPEAKER_05]: You see how many drugs will people pop?

1308
01:31:55,523 --> 01:31:55,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello?

1309
01:31:58,287 --> 01:32:05,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, it also did have a multiplayer mode where two players could compete against each other to clean their different fields out.

1310
01:32:07,290 --> 01:32:13,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, you just had to get rid of your viruses before they got rid of theirs, but it had more capsules fall on the opposing side.

1311
01:32:14,892 --> 01:32:19,073
[SPEAKER_05]: My little sister and I would play that hours on end.

1312
01:32:20,173 --> 01:32:24,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, it was done by Yokoi, who was the guy that gave us the Game Boy and the Game & Watch.

1313
01:32:25,855 --> 01:32:39,220
[SPEAKER_05]: and um uh Takehiro Harada who um was the producer was the producer on Metroid so and um a lot of the music actually that ended up um some of the music ended up in Super Smash Brothers Brawl

1314
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:46,343
[SPEAKER_05]: was the guy that did that actually became one of the presidents of Creatures Inc.

1315
01:32:46,583 --> 01:32:49,925
[SPEAKER_05]: which owned a third of the copyright regarding Pokemon.

1316
01:32:51,186 --> 01:32:53,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to show that little correlation.

1317
01:32:54,528 --> 01:32:55,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Were you going to say something?

1318
01:32:56,369 --> 01:32:57,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotta eradicate them all.

1319
01:32:59,710 --> 01:33:00,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Mario in Puzzle League

1320
01:33:22,909 --> 01:33:33,911
[SPEAKER_05]: 2003, there was the release of a Nintendo GameCube preview disc that had you could download the NES version of Dr. Mario to your Game Boy Advance console.

1321
01:33:34,231 --> 01:33:34,871
[SPEAKER_05]: That was pretty cool.

1322
01:33:35,551 --> 01:33:37,652
[SPEAKER_05]: You do that little cable deal that came out.

1323
01:33:38,892 --> 01:33:46,033
[SPEAKER_05]: There was an enhanced version that came with Tetris on the Super Nintendo that was Tetris and Dr. Mario that came out on December 30th, 1994.

1324
01:33:47,533 --> 01:33:49,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not bring it out before then, you know?

1325
01:33:49,254 --> 01:33:50,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Christmas, blah.

1326
01:33:51,474 --> 01:33:58,338
[SPEAKER_05]: It was also re-released in Japan on March 30th, 1997 and was downloadable for the Satellaview.

1327
01:33:59,879 --> 01:34:01,980
[SPEAKER_05]: It was called Dr. Mario BS version.

1328
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the Satellaview is the BS Satellaview.

1329
01:34:07,083 --> 01:34:08,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I play some music for one of the other versions here?

1330
01:34:08,944 --> 01:34:09,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

1331
01:34:09,385 --> 01:34:11,646
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to go to the Mario 64 version here.

1332
01:34:14,027 --> 01:34:14,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of...

1333
01:34:22,478 --> 01:34:26,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Same song, but a little souped up.

1334
01:34:27,479 --> 01:34:34,301
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it was also downloadable for the Nintendo Power Cartridges and Super Famicom and Game Boy.

1335
01:34:35,422 --> 01:34:44,724
[SPEAKER_05]: And then on the 21st anniversary of its release in 2011, the original Game Boy version was made available for the 3DS to download.

1336
01:34:47,274 --> 01:35:12,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, basically, parents, this is what you were talking about, they said that there was a parent, parents had issues about the inclusion of medicine, and there was a review by Ace that gave it a 510 out of 1000 points because it said it reeked of plagiarism, and that it was worse than the games it was modeled after.

1337
01:35:13,308 --> 01:35:14,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Ace Games Magazine E-Map

1338
01:35:29,109 --> 01:35:57,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Amiga format and ST titles oh wow so yeah anyway keep going there were it was really just a good game a lot of people really loved it you know it was very simple graphically but it got it made its point it was fun and simple to play and that's the point of a game it was enough challenging to keep you playing it because I would play this game for hours I can tell you that

1339
01:35:59,834 --> 01:36:02,877
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, like you said, there were other follow-ups.

1340
01:36:02,917 --> 01:36:05,579
[SPEAKER_05]: There was Dr. Mario 64, like we're listening to right now.

1341
01:36:06,220 --> 01:36:07,701
[SPEAKER_05]: That other game modes too.

1342
01:36:08,322 --> 01:36:10,483
[SPEAKER_05]: And other characters, including Wario.

1343
01:36:11,304 --> 01:36:13,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Because at the time, Wario Land 3 was out.

1344
01:36:15,107 --> 01:36:19,211
[SPEAKER_05]: And it came out in Japan under the Nintendo Puzzle Collection.

1345
01:36:19,571 --> 01:36:20,772
[SPEAKER_08]: But Wario wasn't a doctor.

1346
01:36:20,812 --> 01:36:22,053
[SPEAKER_08]: He was just a nurse practitioner.

1347
01:36:24,796 --> 01:36:26,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Mario Online.

1348
01:36:27,762 --> 01:36:34,388
[SPEAKER_05]: RX, which I guess for prescription, came out in 2008 on the Wii, so you could play online versus the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.

1349
01:36:34,528 --> 01:36:41,013
[SPEAKER_08]: So I do want to say to Alpha Cananigram in our chat room at chat.orange.com who says, Nintendo, release Dr. Mario 3DS online.

1350
01:36:41,334 --> 01:36:42,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Put it on the Nintendo Network.

1351
01:36:42,675 --> 01:36:44,376
[SPEAKER_08]: There is the Wii one.

1352
01:36:44,416 --> 01:36:48,680
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, granted, you might be specifically wanting a handheld, but there is an online version available.

1353
01:36:49,048 --> 01:36:52,329
[SPEAKER_05]: and then there was Dr. Mario Express that came out in 2009 for the DSi.

1354
01:36:52,970 --> 01:36:53,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Not multiplayer.

1355
01:36:54,790 --> 01:36:56,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Boo.

1356
01:36:56,551 --> 01:36:59,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Mario is a secret character in Smash Bros.

1357
01:36:59,592 --> 01:37:08,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Melee and they actually had an attack based on it in Brawl and it had the chill music from the game.

1358
01:37:10,196 --> 01:37:16,919
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, just lots of cool stuff and actually that music was arranged by the guy that did music for Magical Drop.

1359
01:37:18,476 --> 01:37:21,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Just all kinds of neat little crossovers there, don't you think?

1360
01:37:22,397 --> 01:37:22,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

1361
01:37:23,218 --> 01:37:23,998
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's it.

1362
01:37:25,178 --> 01:37:25,459
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1363
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:26,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Mario.

1364
01:37:26,619 --> 01:37:29,700
[SPEAKER_08]: There it is, your classic game of the week, Dr. Mario.

1365
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:37,483
[SPEAKER_08]: For the NES, really, but available on pretty much every Nintendo system since then, in one way or another, including the Game Boy.

1366
01:37:37,563 --> 01:37:38,883
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw one there on YouTube.

1367
01:37:39,003 --> 01:37:40,924
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I owned it on Game Boy, actually.

1368
01:37:41,244 --> 01:37:42,425
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think I owned it on NES.

1369
01:37:42,465 --> 01:37:43,165
[SPEAKER_08]: I owned it on Game Boy.

1370
01:37:43,877 --> 01:37:45,538
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to play the Satellaview version.

1371
01:37:46,399 --> 01:37:47,600
[SPEAKER_05]: The BS one?

1372
01:37:48,340 --> 01:37:48,560
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1373
01:37:49,221 --> 01:37:49,981
[SPEAKER_05]: The BS, yeah.

1374
01:37:51,442 --> 01:37:58,287
[SPEAKER_05]: But we've actually got a Satellaview ROM of the Zelda game.

1375
01:37:58,307 --> 01:37:59,888
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really good.

1376
01:38:00,288 --> 01:38:03,270
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can imagine what the Dr. Mario one looks like.

1377
01:38:04,341 --> 01:38:04,661
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1378
01:38:05,041 --> 01:38:08,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's going to do it for part A of our show tonight, but we're not done yet, guys.

1379
01:38:08,342 --> 01:38:09,482
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got plenty more to come.

1380
01:38:09,522 --> 01:38:16,224
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to talk about some other things when we get back from a quick break here, including some Xbox-related announcements and news.

1381
01:38:16,624 --> 01:38:21,326
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Sony possibly in trouble, according to somebody, so we'll talk a little bit about that.

1382
01:38:21,346 --> 01:38:28,768
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, your Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR and your emails at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and...

1383
01:38:29,488 --> 01:38:31,171
[SPEAKER_08]: because it is a show where every gamer has a voice.

1384
01:38:31,211 --> 01:38:32,573
[SPEAKER_08]: There's many ways to contact us.

1385
01:38:32,934 --> 01:38:37,441
[SPEAKER_08]: The Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

1386
01:38:37,461 --> 01:38:41,727
[SPEAKER_08]: We will be taking all of those calls a little later on right after a quick break.

1387
01:38:42,068 --> 01:38:42,869
[SPEAKER_08]: So stay tuned, guys.

1388
01:38:42,889 --> 01:38:43,671
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be right back.

1389
01:38:50,015 --> 01:38:57,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live with episode number 444 on this February the 5th of 2012.

1390
01:38:58,042 --> 01:39:05,869
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there's this football game going on and Loki was mentioning that he was watching, he's catching up now on the good stuff, the commercials.

1391
01:39:07,110 --> 01:39:11,034
[SPEAKER_08]: And you just said, what, the Battleship movie might not be so bad from what you're looking at?

1392
01:39:11,054 --> 01:39:11,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1393
01:39:11,554 --> 01:39:12,194
[SPEAKER_09]: I just really want that.

1394
01:39:29,685 --> 01:39:29,765
E5!

1395
01:39:29,785 --> 01:39:30,907
[SPEAKER_09]: You sunk my battleship!

1396
01:39:46,474 --> 01:39:47,515
[SPEAKER_09]: It just looked ridiculous.

1397
01:39:47,795 --> 01:39:50,396
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like it could be Transformers 4 or whatever.

1398
01:39:50,436 --> 01:39:52,777
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's just pretty much... I don't know.

1399
01:39:53,138 --> 01:39:53,738
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm down with it.

1400
01:39:53,758 --> 01:39:54,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, I mean, come on.

1401
01:39:55,079 --> 01:39:56,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Look back at, like, Independence Day.

1402
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:58,040
[SPEAKER_09]: How fucking cheesy was that movie?

1403
01:39:58,060 --> 01:39:59,221
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it was so cheesy.

1404
01:39:59,761 --> 01:40:00,942
[SPEAKER_05]: I did see snakes on a plane.

1405
01:40:01,482 --> 01:40:01,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah?

1406
01:40:02,543 --> 01:40:03,483
[SPEAKER_05]: In the theater at Disneyland.

1407
01:40:06,285 --> 01:40:08,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Did they get the motherfucking snakes off the motherfucking plane?

1408
01:40:08,346 --> 01:40:10,067
[SPEAKER_05]: It was me, Kristen, and Megzi.

1409
01:40:11,365 --> 01:40:16,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Wearing giant plushy snakes wrapped around us in the movie theater.

1410
01:40:16,589 --> 01:40:18,931
[SPEAKER_08]: You dressed up to go see Snakes on a Plane.

1411
01:40:20,673 --> 01:40:24,936
[SPEAKER_09]: We got the snakes at the Jungle Trader.

1412
01:40:25,257 --> 01:40:26,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we did something similar.

1413
01:40:26,417 --> 01:40:28,199
[SPEAKER_09]: We watched it actually at our work.

1414
01:40:28,459 --> 01:40:30,101
[SPEAKER_09]: They had a movie screening in our theater.

1415
01:40:30,181 --> 01:40:33,383
[SPEAKER_09]: We had rubber snakes that we were throwing during the movie.

1416
01:40:33,523 --> 01:40:34,224
[SPEAKER_09]: That was kind of fun.

1417
01:40:35,725 --> 01:40:37,787
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, the Avengers trailer is awesome.

1418
01:40:39,537 --> 01:40:41,079
That was a cool scene.

1419
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:42,721
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Samuel L. Jackson.

1420
01:40:42,801 --> 01:40:46,786
[SPEAKER_09]: I like when the giant snake ate that one dude.

1421
01:40:55,896 --> 01:41:04,879
[SPEAKER_09]: And I gotta admit though, I would be all for them making a sequel where it takes place on a space shuttle with Samuel Jackson in it.

1422
01:41:04,919 --> 01:41:05,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Snakes on a shuttle.

1423
01:41:06,459 --> 01:41:10,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know that someone tried to do a knockoff called Snakes on a Train.

1424
01:41:11,020 --> 01:41:12,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, that's Asylum.

1425
01:41:12,721 --> 01:41:15,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Asylum does fucking transmorphers and...

1426
01:41:18,303 --> 01:41:23,145
[SPEAKER_08]: I would expect them to do a GoBot scene How can we get in one of these movies?

1427
01:41:23,265 --> 01:41:30,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn it Don't they have a need for witty radio trio to be eaten alive by snakes or something?

1428
01:41:30,588 --> 01:41:31,028
[SPEAKER_09]: They may

1429
01:41:32,949 --> 01:41:53,303
[SPEAKER_09]: so many stupid movies and the thing is they do it intentional now I mean I don't know if they do it intentional as far as like they buy the properties for these and then they put them on like sci-fi channel or they purposely make them that bad I don't know if it's hard to tell like if are you doing this on purpose or you do you really just suck that much you know it's just I don't know

1430
01:41:54,984 --> 01:41:58,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we get into the rapid fire news tonight, DarkSakura, you mentioned you wanted to plug something real quick.

1431
01:41:59,186 --> 01:42:00,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I do.

1432
01:42:00,726 --> 01:42:08,389
[SPEAKER_05]: One of our fantabulous listeners, Ikuma JP, made an app for the iPhone, and I want to share it with everybody.

1433
01:42:08,789 --> 01:42:10,650
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called My Secret Garden.

1434
01:42:11,230 --> 01:42:14,911
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really beautiful, and it's free, so go get it.

1435
01:42:17,850 --> 01:42:18,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob says he likes free.

1436
01:42:19,331 --> 01:42:20,572
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't give Rob enough time.

1437
01:42:21,293 --> 01:42:24,015
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's more than gorgeous moving pictures.

1438
01:42:25,917 --> 01:42:26,497
[SPEAKER_05]: It's beautiful.

1439
01:42:26,817 --> 01:42:30,400
[SPEAKER_09]: It has nothing to do with the My Secret Garden book series.

1440
01:42:30,420 --> 01:42:31,501
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that wasn't a series.

1441
01:42:31,561 --> 01:42:34,184
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one book by the same... Well, there was too many fucking books.

1442
01:42:34,464 --> 01:42:37,026
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, there's too many fucking movies based on that book.

1443
01:42:37,546 --> 01:42:39,408
[SPEAKER_05]: There was the same lady that wrote A Little Princess.

1444
01:42:39,428 --> 01:42:39,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1445
01:42:40,779 --> 01:42:41,439
[SPEAKER_08]: The more you know.

1446
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:42,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I read them both.

1447
01:42:42,740 --> 01:42:43,180
[SPEAKER_05]: I love those books.

1448
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:45,361
[SPEAKER_08]: But the most beautiful part of that sentence was free.

1449
01:42:45,821 --> 01:42:46,401
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you go.

1450
01:42:47,682 --> 01:42:47,942
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1451
01:42:48,002 --> 01:42:49,502
[SPEAKER_05]: And that one of our listeners made him.

1452
01:42:49,562 --> 01:42:50,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, of course.

1453
01:42:51,503 --> 01:42:54,564
[SPEAKER_08]: So we demand he gets a top 100 ranking immediately.

1454
01:42:55,184 --> 01:42:55,465
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1455
01:42:56,625 --> 01:42:59,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on to some rapid fire news, Loki.

1456
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:04,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, let's talk a little bit about movies.

1457
01:43:04,382 --> 01:43:06,083
[SPEAKER_09]: We were just talking about movies.

1458
01:43:06,203 --> 01:43:13,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Ace Attorney, a movie I'm sure a lot of people might be interested in checking out, is actually going to be localized for worldwide release.

1459
01:43:14,327 --> 01:43:18,969
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure that's going to be a very limited release, but hey, you'll eventually get it on DVD and Blu-ray soon.

1460
01:43:20,730 --> 01:43:23,511
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as Samuel L. Jackson isn't saying, OBJECTION!

1461
01:43:29,373 --> 01:43:30,214
[SPEAKER_09]: He should be the judge.

1462
01:43:30,815 --> 01:43:33,538
[SPEAKER_09]: These motherfucking ejections out of my motherfucking courtroom.

1463
01:43:34,379 --> 01:43:35,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Objections in the courtroom.

1464
01:43:36,942 --> 01:43:40,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Sustain, motherfucker!

1465
01:43:41,547 --> 01:43:43,009
[SPEAKER_09]: You can put him really in anything, you know.

1466
01:43:43,029 --> 01:43:45,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Samuel Jackson really could just be in anything.

1467
01:43:45,672 --> 01:43:47,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Stance is sitting on the toilet at the movie.

1468
01:43:51,718 --> 01:43:53,419
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll be the movie we get offered to do.

1469
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:54,400
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1470
01:43:54,740 --> 01:43:55,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1471
01:43:56,681 --> 01:44:01,405
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they're doing a Humble Bundle for Android, which is kind of unique.

1472
01:44:01,965 --> 01:44:03,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Mainly it's been PC.

1473
01:44:04,166 --> 01:44:06,368
[SPEAKER_09]: But now you're going to be able to get a few games.

1474
01:44:06,728 --> 01:44:21,298
[SPEAKER_09]: The new Humble Bundle for Android offers Android versions of Anomaly, Warzone, Earth, Osmos, and Edge with a bonus copy of World of Goo if you exceed the average payment.

1475
01:44:22,098 --> 01:44:23,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so that's kinda neat.

1476
01:44:23,780 --> 01:44:29,003
[SPEAKER_08]: That's neat that it's coming to mobile phones, so it'll never happen on Apple, but hey, yay for Android.

1477
01:44:29,183 --> 01:44:37,009
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess, um, these games are cross-platform, so you get them on Android and Windows and OSX and Linux.

1478
01:44:39,130 --> 01:44:41,332
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it's pretty nice, I guess.

1479
01:44:42,372 --> 01:44:49,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Problem is, you know, really with a lot of these bundles, it's like if you bought one of these bundles, you probably have most of the games already in there anyway, so it's...

1480
01:44:50,994 --> 01:44:53,035
[SPEAKER_09]: How many fucking copies of VVVV do I need?

1481
01:44:53,095 --> 01:44:53,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Or World of Goo?

1482
01:44:53,935 --> 01:44:54,896
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's just really.

1483
01:44:56,817 --> 01:44:58,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Last but not least, Vita Games.

1484
01:44:59,418 --> 01:45:06,602
[SPEAKER_09]: They did mention a while back that Vita Games were going to be cheaper if you did buy them online versus a boxed game.

1485
01:45:06,942 --> 01:45:11,364
[SPEAKER_09]: However, you may consider still wanting to buy a boxed game because you're only going to be saving 10%.

1486
01:45:12,224 --> 01:45:13,085
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's it.

1487
01:45:13,185 --> 01:45:15,446
[SPEAKER_09]: They're 10% cheaper on the PlayStation Network.

1488
01:45:15,486 --> 01:45:16,426
[SPEAKER_09]: They will be day and day.

1489
01:45:16,946 --> 01:45:20,048
[SPEAKER_09]: So if it's a game that maybe you just want to go to the store to get it,

1490
01:45:21,750 --> 01:45:42,357
[SPEAKER_08]: and you can do it I guess but it's only 10% like two bucks on some of these games that's really interesting actually that whole thing because that's kind of how they're gonna try and combat used games is by making it cheaper to buy a new one that you can never sell back

1491
01:45:44,325 --> 01:45:45,366
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not much cheaper.

1492
01:45:45,526 --> 01:45:47,168
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a few bucks.

1493
01:45:47,268 --> 01:45:54,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, you're going to make back the difference if you sell a new copy of a game used.

1494
01:45:54,758 --> 01:45:56,400
[SPEAKER_08]: For some people, that's going to make the difference.

1495
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:57,101
[SPEAKER_09]: You know it.

1496
01:45:59,204 --> 01:46:00,365
[SPEAKER_09]: It's 10%, folks.

1497
01:46:00,425 --> 01:46:01,065
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, come on.

1498
01:46:01,105 --> 01:46:01,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Just saying.

1499
01:46:01,926 --> 01:46:05,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, if you want to play devil's advocate, you could say, no, it's not really 10%.

1500
01:46:05,928 --> 01:46:10,450
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be that plus tax, but I don't know if they charge tax on these purchases.

1501
01:46:11,691 --> 01:46:12,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Might depend on the state still.

1502
01:46:13,152 --> 01:46:13,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1503
01:46:13,912 --> 01:46:23,657
[SPEAKER_09]: So you could potentially save upwards to 20%, but once again, you could probably buy it used and it'll be cheaper.

1504
01:46:24,458 --> 01:46:28,520
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't know if there's a real need for you to jump in and get everything digital.

1505
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:29,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1506
01:46:54,100 --> 01:46:57,602
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you're not one to sell back games, then maybe?

1507
01:46:58,842 --> 01:46:59,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1508
01:46:59,603 --> 01:47:00,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, moving on.

1509
01:47:01,123 --> 01:47:06,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, misspellings on box art will not result in any type of price reduction.

1510
01:47:06,426 --> 01:47:07,907
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, it might make the price of these go up.

1511
01:47:08,007 --> 01:47:08,387
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1512
01:47:08,887 --> 01:47:14,670
[SPEAKER_08]: But we talked about this a little bit last week, and that's, of course, Resident Evil Revelations or whatever.

1513
01:47:15,390 --> 01:47:16,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1514
01:47:39,678 --> 01:47:43,761
[SPEAKER_08]: It's missing the I and the T are backwards there, so that's what's wrong.

1515
01:47:44,581 --> 01:47:51,465
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, yeah, so the box art made it out there, so you might actually, if you've already picked up a copy... Doesn't that stuff get proofed?

1516
01:47:51,545 --> 01:47:53,926
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean... No, we were talking about this last week.

1517
01:47:55,187 --> 01:47:59,089
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway... Seeing where that is now, I think the designer had very little to do with that.

1518
01:48:00,050 --> 01:48:00,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1519
01:48:02,743 --> 01:48:08,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Capcom has stated that the initial shipment was sent to retailers in North America with a spelling error.

1520
01:48:09,085 --> 01:48:15,726
[SPEAKER_08]: It's being repackaged and will have the corrected spelling so you can actually order a new slipcover for it.

1521
01:48:15,926 --> 01:48:20,848
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the exact same thing they did when they put out Okami with the IGN watermark on it.

1522
01:48:21,228 --> 01:48:22,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Hilarious!

1523
01:48:23,388 --> 01:48:25,849
[SPEAKER_05]: I have all of the new ones and I didn't even know the game.

1524
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:30,563
[SPEAKER_09]: That's even better because I have a poster that they've made up the box art.

1525
01:48:31,003 --> 01:48:33,545
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like, how'd you miss that?

1526
01:48:35,906 --> 01:48:37,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody approved that.

1527
01:48:37,748 --> 01:48:38,068
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1528
01:48:38,988 --> 01:48:53,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if Dance Dance Revolution with just yourself isn't enough and DDR in the arcades with two people isn't enough, well, I hope you're still in high school because DDR Classroom Edition is going to be a PC game that allows 48 dance mats.

1529
01:48:55,592 --> 01:48:58,354
[SPEAKER_08]: All to be linked together so that you can all play DDR.

1530
01:48:58,594 --> 01:48:59,554
[SPEAKER_08]: That's actually kind of cool.

1531
01:48:59,695 --> 01:49:06,779
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually, you know, as a gamer nerd who, you know, has been one ever since like high school where sometimes I was looked at as like the big old nerd for being into games.

1532
01:49:07,119 --> 01:49:11,622
[SPEAKER_08]: This is pretty rad that DDR really has kind of gotten into a lot of different PE programs.

1533
01:49:12,182 --> 01:49:19,166
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this is out there to try and basically get like an official Dance Dance Revolution classroom game.

1534
01:49:19,286 --> 01:49:27,212
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Konami already supports DDR and PE programs, but this is now just a whole, like, 48 people can all play the same game.

1535
01:49:27,613 --> 01:49:29,614
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure how that works.

1536
01:49:29,854 --> 01:49:36,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I don't know if it's like, if the majority of people get it right, then you get points or whatever, but I think it's just kind of a, you know...

1537
01:49:38,757 --> 01:49:40,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Individual scorings, maybe?

1538
01:49:40,819 --> 01:49:41,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

1539
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:41,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

1540
01:49:41,640 --> 01:49:43,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, if you fail this, you will get an F in P.E.

1541
01:49:44,844 --> 01:49:46,926
[SPEAKER_08]: The time has come for you to dance for your life.

1542
01:49:47,267 --> 01:49:47,367
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1543
01:49:47,907 --> 01:49:48,128
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1544
01:49:48,188 --> 01:49:49,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Now's the time let's break and swim and dance!

1545
01:49:52,386 --> 01:50:04,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I couldn't tell you exactly what songs are going to be in this new DDR game, but I bet if it's for schools, it's probably not going to be any songs by one particular musician who's been showing up in a lot of music games lately.

1546
01:50:05,135 --> 01:50:13,801
[SPEAKER_08]: And if recent rumors are to be believed, Ubisoft, who has made Just Dance, The Black-Eyed Peas Experience...

1547
01:50:14,641 --> 01:50:37,629
[SPEAKER_08]: The Abba You Can Dance The Michael Jackson Experience Guess what's supposed to come out for the Wii and the Wii U later this year The Lady Gaga Experience You know you're gonna get it Praise Gaga Oh my god Step aside lesser pop divas

1548
01:50:42,455 --> 01:50:47,017
[SPEAKER_08]: You too can experience Amazon discounting your album to 99 cents.

1549
01:50:48,937 --> 01:50:53,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Your fifth single not doing so well with a video that you directed nobody understands.

1550
01:50:53,719 --> 01:50:54,260
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm kidding.

1551
01:50:54,380 --> 01:50:56,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, Lady Gaga experience.

1552
01:50:56,801 --> 01:50:59,082
[SPEAKER_08]: There'll be plenty of people that'll pick that up.

1553
01:50:59,162 --> 01:51:00,202
[SPEAKER_07]: I may or may not be one of them.

1554
01:51:00,662 --> 01:51:01,423
[SPEAKER_07]: You will be one of them.

1555
01:51:01,443 --> 01:51:03,224
[SPEAKER_08]: I will totally fucking buy this game.

1556
01:51:03,304 --> 01:51:04,764
[SPEAKER_08]: I am not even going to try and lie.

1557
01:51:05,645 --> 01:51:08,706
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as it has all the songs I really like, I'll get it day one.

1558
01:51:08,866 --> 01:51:10,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Lady Gaga, the experience, all will be revealed.

1559
01:51:10,747 --> 01:51:11,468
[SPEAKER_09]: You will experience.

1560
01:51:11,488 --> 01:51:12,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Is she really a man?

1561
01:51:12,448 --> 01:51:14,229
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that was proven when she showed her twat.

1562
01:51:14,289 --> 01:51:15,090
[SPEAKER_09]: When did she show her twat?

1563
01:51:15,110 --> 01:51:15,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Telephone.

1564
01:51:32,816 --> 01:51:33,556
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember that.

1565
01:51:34,517 --> 01:51:40,140
[SPEAKER_05]: She hopped up on the bars and showed her twat to everybody and it was all squared out.

1566
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:42,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1567
01:51:42,741 --> 01:51:43,281
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember that.

1568
01:51:43,582 --> 01:51:45,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they just had to pixel out her penis.

1569
01:51:46,623 --> 01:51:47,964
[SPEAKER_08]: She likes to make fun of it.

1570
01:51:48,324 --> 01:51:53,307
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, if she had a penis, that thing would be like platinum plated and candy striped.

1571
01:51:54,608 --> 01:52:09,829
[SPEAKER_08]: when I went to her concert don't give her ideas for a new video I've seen her live twice in concert and both times she's joked about the rumors that she has a penis like she thinks it's funny so she likes the mystery I guess anyway can we please stop talking about Lady Gaga's penis and move on to more rapid fire news

1572
01:52:10,490 --> 01:52:11,071
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.

1573
01:52:11,351 --> 01:52:12,072
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.

1574
01:52:13,473 --> 01:52:15,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, how about Dance Central 2?

1575
01:52:17,056 --> 01:52:21,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Download content is going to have some fun stuff in it if you like the game.

1576
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:24,602
[SPEAKER_05]: There is Say Hey, I Love You.

1577
01:52:24,622 --> 01:52:31,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, by the way, this is on February 14th.

1578
01:52:32,088 --> 01:52:35,491
[SPEAKER_05]: And Milkshake, because that song's still, you know...

1579
01:52:38,483 --> 01:52:58,198
[SPEAKER_05]: It still brings all the boys to the yard All these years later And LMFAO featuring Lauren Bennett and Goon Rock's Party Rock Anthem That might be kind of cool Also on January 31st is Forget You Or as the version I like, Fuck You I just realized, do you even know what song Party Rock Anthem is?

1580
01:52:58,599 --> 01:52:58,719
[SPEAKER_05]: No

1581
01:53:01,335 --> 01:53:02,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1582
01:53:17,868 --> 01:53:24,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, my favorite was when Alan and I were in the car the other day and we were listening to one station and Adele came on and we flipped to another station.

1583
01:53:24,610 --> 01:53:26,570
[SPEAKER_08]: They were in the middle of another Adele song.

1584
01:53:26,850 --> 01:53:30,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to a third station, they're in the middle of the song, the Adele song that the first station started playing.

1585
01:53:30,651 --> 01:53:34,052
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, this bitch is everywhere.

1586
01:53:35,313 --> 01:53:36,213
[SPEAKER_08]: God, I cannot.

1587
01:53:38,322 --> 01:53:44,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, if you bought your copy of Dance Central 2 from Best Buy, you will get a code to get Party Rock Anthem early.

1588
01:53:45,248 --> 01:53:45,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying.

1589
01:53:46,529 --> 01:53:47,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever the hell song that is.

1590
01:53:47,790 --> 01:53:50,412
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a delayed DLC bonus right there.

1591
01:53:50,613 --> 01:53:52,234
[SPEAKER_05]: How about Just Dance 3 DLC?

1592
01:53:52,574 --> 01:53:54,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, that game's relevant too.

1593
01:53:55,957 --> 01:53:58,219
[SPEAKER_09]: It is technically the number one selling game right now.

1594
01:53:58,399 --> 01:54:01,420
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get The Power by Snap.

1595
01:54:02,540 --> 01:54:04,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Because people still like that song.

1596
01:54:05,461 --> 01:54:11,123
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can actually get Bollywood, Kati Kallendal, I guess.

1597
01:54:11,823 --> 01:54:13,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Love Letters, Y.O.Y.

1598
01:54:13,184 --> 01:54:14,864
[SPEAKER_05]: and Sweet Invaders, Skin to Skin.

1599
01:54:16,005 --> 01:54:17,425
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can get all those 240 Microsoft points apiece.

1600
01:54:20,806 --> 01:54:46,191
[SPEAKER_05]: and then last but not least which I kind of think I need to get this there's going to be the Pink Pearl 3DS available on February 10th and I want it the same way I wanted my pink GBA in a totally ironic way I was hipster before everybody else was no seriously I wanted the pink one because I thought it was hideous and I liked it and I think I would want this one too because it's equally hideous and I really want it

1601
01:54:46,601 --> 01:54:49,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so tell me if you've ever heard this song before, DarkSakura.

1602
01:54:50,804 --> 01:54:56,027
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you ready?

1603
01:54:57,148 --> 01:54:58,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this shit.

1604
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:01,951
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, she's not the girl in the bubble.

1605
01:55:02,011 --> 01:55:03,992
[SPEAKER_09]: She has to have heard it at some point.

1606
01:55:04,253 --> 01:55:05,593
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like pretty much avoidable.

1607
01:55:06,554 --> 01:55:09,156
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't, you know, you can't avoid that song at all.

1608
01:55:09,176 --> 01:55:09,756
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like avoiding something.

1609
01:55:09,796 --> 01:55:11,197
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't listen to the radio in my car.

1610
01:55:11,457 --> 01:55:12,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, but you go to Pinkberry.

1611
01:55:12,958 --> 01:55:14,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's probably, I think, where I heard it.

1612
01:55:15,060 --> 01:55:15,260
Shit.

1613
01:55:16,465 --> 01:55:17,045
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1614
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:42,840
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who does it, but I'm winning.

1615
01:55:42,860 --> 01:55:43,601
[SPEAKER_08]: That's LMFAO.

1616
01:55:43,641 --> 01:55:44,121
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same band.

1617
01:55:44,141 --> 01:55:44,321
[SPEAKER_05]: It is?

1618
01:55:44,761 --> 01:55:45,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1619
01:55:45,401 --> 01:55:46,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think that song was hilarious.

1620
01:55:46,782 --> 01:55:50,563
[SPEAKER_09]: They also did that song that, you know, sine waves, you know, won a cage match.

1621
01:55:50,583 --> 01:55:53,023
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's who opened for Kesha when my friend went.

1622
01:55:56,184 --> 01:55:58,425
[SPEAKER_05]: She said she was going just to see them and not Kesha.

1623
01:55:59,059 --> 01:56:00,780
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm surprised she didn't catch the herps.

1624
01:56:00,860 --> 01:56:05,004
[SPEAKER_05]: The next day when she came into class, she still had glitter in her hair.

1625
01:56:05,084 --> 01:56:05,704
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so funny.

1626
01:56:06,585 --> 01:56:07,646
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Kesha's hilarious.

1627
01:56:08,907 --> 01:56:12,210
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to really hate Kesha, but she's really grown on me.

1628
01:56:12,270 --> 01:56:15,152
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of that is probably the influence of some of my friends.

1629
01:56:15,833 --> 01:56:20,917
[SPEAKER_08]: But now it's kind of like that whole guilty pleasure type of thing.

1630
01:56:21,077 --> 01:56:22,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Some days you just feel a little bit trashy.

1631
01:56:22,978 --> 01:56:24,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Some days you want a trashy girl.

1632
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:25,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Shit.

1633
01:56:25,160 --> 01:56:25,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying.

1634
01:56:50,816 --> 01:56:53,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you imagine if Ubisoft put out Kesha the experience?

1635
01:56:54,460 --> 01:56:55,921
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sexy and I know it.

1636
01:56:55,961 --> 01:56:58,123
[SPEAKER_08]: It would just come with a gallon of body glitter.

1637
01:56:58,864 --> 01:56:59,725
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, God.

1638
01:57:00,866 --> 01:57:03,849
[SPEAKER_05]: That would just be... That would make my soul hurt.

1639
01:57:03,989 --> 01:57:04,950
[SPEAKER_05]: I would play it.

1640
01:57:05,030 --> 01:57:08,013
[SPEAKER_08]: A jar full of gonorrhea and a used tampon.

1641
01:57:08,273 --> 01:57:10,475
[SPEAKER_05]: I would play it, but I would turn back in the gonorrhea.

1642
01:57:11,776 --> 01:57:12,857
[SPEAKER_05]: You can keep this part.

1643
01:57:13,578 --> 01:57:14,299
[SPEAKER_05]: I like my Kesha.

1644
01:57:14,599 --> 01:57:15,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Bathe that Kesha.

1645
01:57:16,145 --> 01:57:16,526
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1646
01:57:16,766 --> 01:57:18,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, moving on.

1647
01:57:18,308 --> 01:57:20,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get into some other news stories.

1648
01:57:20,812 --> 01:57:22,695
[SPEAKER_08]: And, of course, the mailbag is coming up soon, too.

1649
01:57:22,755 --> 01:57:24,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1650
01:57:25,719 --> 01:57:26,680
[SPEAKER_08]: And the FUs of the week.

1651
01:57:26,740 --> 01:57:29,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Twitter topics, Skype line, all that fun stuff.

1652
01:57:29,144 --> 01:57:30,966
[SPEAKER_08]: But first, some more stories, Loki.

1653
01:57:31,900 --> 01:57:36,745
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, you know the new Xbox and everyone's like, oh yeah, it's going to be announced this year.

1654
01:57:36,865 --> 01:57:37,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.

1655
01:57:37,745 --> 01:57:38,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Microsoft said nope.

1656
01:57:40,368 --> 01:57:44,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently the Xbox 360 cycle is not at all finished.

1657
01:57:44,592 --> 01:57:48,375
[SPEAKER_09]: The proof is that we don't see the logic in cutting the prices here.

1658
01:57:51,478 --> 01:57:54,381
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, E3 is still premature.

1659
01:57:55,242 --> 01:57:57,023
[SPEAKER_09]: What's certain is that there'll be nothing new in 2012.

1660
01:57:59,352 --> 01:58:08,058
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, and of course, you know, they put out another statement saying, you know, we're always thinking about the next and, you know, what is next and how we can push the boundaries and blah, blah, blah.

1661
01:58:08,438 --> 01:58:14,002
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, you know, there will be another Xbox, most likely 2014 or holiday 2013.

1662
01:58:14,462 --> 01:58:16,263
[SPEAKER_08]: We're waiting to see what Nintendo does.

1663
01:58:17,044 --> 01:58:19,405
[SPEAKER_08]: I should have just been there lying because everybody would have believed that.

1664
01:58:19,425 --> 01:58:23,508
[SPEAKER_05]: I honestly think... I was going to tell them that for your ringtone.

1665
01:58:23,868 --> 01:58:26,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, yeah.

1666
01:58:26,410 --> 01:58:26,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1667
01:58:31,487 --> 01:58:32,687
[SPEAKER_05]: I did and it turned it back on.

1668
01:58:32,707 --> 01:58:44,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, it's basically... I mean, their new system is going to be graphically... The Wii U is going to be graphically capable of what the 360 is right now.

1669
01:58:44,909 --> 01:58:47,450
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't really think that they have too much to worry about right now.

1670
01:58:47,690 --> 01:58:53,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially if that whole tablet thing doesn't end up working out to be this innovative masterpiece.

1671
01:58:55,003 --> 01:58:55,323
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1672
01:58:55,343 --> 01:58:56,505
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that they're fine right now.

1673
01:58:56,985 --> 01:59:07,718
[SPEAKER_09]: They can wait next year for the component prices to come way down and still beef up what's inside their box and put out some great games.

1674
01:59:07,898 --> 01:59:08,819
[SPEAKER_09]: What's in their box?

1675
01:59:09,500 --> 01:59:09,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1676
01:59:10,020 --> 01:59:10,661
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Kesha.

1677
01:59:11,442 --> 01:59:11,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1678
01:59:12,543 --> 01:59:13,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the thing, though.

1679
01:59:13,243 --> 01:59:15,564
[SPEAKER_08]: What does Microsoft show at E3 this year, then?

1680
01:59:15,624 --> 01:59:17,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it just going to be a repeat of last year's E3?

1681
01:59:17,705 --> 01:59:18,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Halo 4.

1682
01:59:18,905 --> 01:59:20,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Which they showed at last E3.

1683
01:59:20,286 --> 01:59:21,706
[SPEAKER_09]: They showed a teaser.

1684
01:59:21,966 --> 01:59:22,607
[SPEAKER_08]: And then what?

1685
01:59:22,687 --> 01:59:26,208
[SPEAKER_08]: The Tomb Raider game probably won't be out until this holiday, right?

1686
01:59:26,508 --> 01:59:28,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Tomb Raider's not coming out until holiday.

1687
01:59:29,109 --> 01:59:32,650
[SPEAKER_09]: There's Bioshock Infinite still holiday this year.

1688
01:59:32,690 --> 01:59:35,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe Grand Theft Auto V holiday.

1689
01:59:36,051 --> 01:59:37,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Another Call of Duty game.

1690
01:59:38,612 --> 01:59:40,753
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going to be a bunch of new IPs.

1691
01:59:40,773 --> 01:59:44,295
[SPEAKER_08]: How much of Microsoft's keynote is just going to be rehashed of last year's stuff?

1692
01:59:45,836 --> 01:59:47,677
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they may still have a lot of stuff.

1693
01:59:47,697 --> 01:59:48,797
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't heard a whole lot.

1694
01:59:49,417 --> 01:59:50,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they're keeping a lot of it under wraps.

1695
01:59:51,418 --> 01:59:54,680
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't think they need to come out with a brand new system yet.

1696
01:59:55,754 --> 02:00:02,858
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think they do either, but I'm still waiting for that Killer Connect hardcore game.

1697
02:00:04,559 --> 02:00:12,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't we get a glimpse at one that was supposed to be some Greek fighting thing?

1698
02:00:12,143 --> 02:00:14,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that's the one from Crytek.

1699
02:00:14,865 --> 02:00:17,206
[SPEAKER_08]: That could be a big hit or a big miss.

1700
02:00:19,347 --> 02:00:20,308
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hard to say.

1701
02:00:21,208 --> 02:00:24,450
[SPEAKER_08]: That could be a hot mess when that comes out, so we'll see.

1702
02:00:26,722 --> 02:00:27,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there's that one.

1703
02:00:28,144 --> 02:00:30,487
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember what it's called, but yeah, it's from Crytek.

1704
02:00:34,051 --> 02:00:34,372
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1705
02:00:34,392 --> 02:00:35,874
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of games coming out this year.

1706
02:00:36,434 --> 02:00:37,716
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a lot of new IPs.

1707
02:00:37,756 --> 02:00:38,717
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't remember all of them.

1708
02:00:40,199 --> 02:00:42,102
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm sure there's going to be some stuff that they'll be able to show.

1709
02:00:42,262 --> 02:00:44,285
[SPEAKER_09]: And obviously, there's a new...

1710
02:00:47,059 --> 02:00:50,962
[SPEAKER_09]: They're gonna show the new Fable game, which I don't give a shit about at all.

1711
02:00:51,142 --> 02:00:54,265
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm done with that series, and done with Peter Molyneux.

1712
02:00:55,265 --> 02:00:58,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I think I paid more attention to what he said.

1713
02:00:59,008 --> 02:01:01,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, there was that whole Fable connect, like, it's not on rails.

1714
02:01:02,030 --> 02:01:02,691
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not on rails!

1715
02:01:02,871 --> 02:01:03,231
[SPEAKER_08]: It's on rails.

1716
02:01:03,251 --> 02:01:04,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Read the board, it's not on rails.

1717
02:01:04,472 --> 02:01:09,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, listen, listen, you fucker, I'm not fucking listening to what fucking Peter Molyneux says.

1718
02:01:09,656 --> 02:01:12,218
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not on rails, it's fucking on rails, okay?

1719
02:01:12,398 --> 02:01:14,300
[SPEAKER_09]: It will be on goddamn rails.

1720
02:01:16,905 --> 02:01:19,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything he promises you is going to be underwhelming.

1721
02:01:20,188 --> 02:01:21,569
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just the way it is.

1722
02:01:21,729 --> 02:01:24,711
[SPEAKER_09]: He's a snake oil salesman.

1723
02:01:25,551 --> 02:01:26,872
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what he is.

1724
02:01:26,892 --> 02:01:28,733
[SPEAKER_09]: He's a fucking snake oil salesman.

1725
02:01:29,334 --> 02:01:33,276
[SPEAKER_09]: He will promise you the world and it will be fucking Fable all over again.

1726
02:01:33,456 --> 02:01:34,037
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what?

1727
02:01:34,337 --> 02:01:37,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether you're a fan of Fable that much, that might be a good thing.

1728
02:01:37,999 --> 02:01:39,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you're just looking for Fable.

1729
02:01:40,201 --> 02:01:43,923
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's not going to be this thing that's going to revolutionize Fable.

1730
02:01:44,644 --> 02:01:46,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing will revolutionize Fable.

1731
02:01:46,705 --> 02:01:50,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Except maybe Kingdom of Amalur or whatever that game is called.

1732
02:01:50,907 --> 02:01:52,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is basically EA's Fable game.

1733
02:01:52,788 --> 02:01:55,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's Fable with God of War fighting.

1734
02:01:56,150 --> 02:01:58,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, that's not a bad combo.

1735
02:01:58,211 --> 02:01:59,292
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't sound bad.

1736
02:01:59,312 --> 02:02:00,012
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a bad combo.

1737
02:02:00,052 --> 02:02:01,193
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds better than the demo.

1738
02:02:01,613 --> 02:02:05,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, big changes going on at Xbox.

1739
02:02:05,435 --> 02:02:06,916
[SPEAKER_08]: This is actually a pretty big change.

1740
02:02:07,436 --> 02:02:09,177
[SPEAKER_08]: I always say this guy's name wrong.

1741
02:02:10,398 --> 02:02:11,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Steven Toulouse?

1742
02:02:11,779 --> 02:02:12,379
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds right.

1743
02:02:13,239 --> 02:02:15,840
[SPEAKER_08]: is one of the big guys at Xbox.

1744
02:02:15,900 --> 02:02:19,221
[SPEAKER_08]: He is the director of Xbox Live Policy and Enforcement.

1745
02:02:19,281 --> 02:02:21,841
[SPEAKER_08]: He's been working at Microsoft for quite a long time.

1746
02:02:21,881 --> 02:02:23,782
[SPEAKER_08]: I think about 17 years he's been working there.

1747
02:02:25,022 --> 02:02:27,903
[SPEAKER_08]: He is no longer going to be working there in a couple weeks.

1748
02:02:28,083 --> 02:02:30,664
[SPEAKER_08]: He has resigned effective on February 16th.

1749
02:02:31,844 --> 02:02:33,266
[SPEAKER_08]: for no particular reason.

1750
02:02:33,326 --> 02:02:34,126
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very interesting.

1751
02:02:34,187 --> 02:02:37,650
[SPEAKER_08]: He's just said, on the 16th, I'm going to head down to Dallas to visit my family.

1752
02:02:38,431 --> 02:02:40,353
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no other plans beyond that.

1753
02:02:40,493 --> 02:02:41,534
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a free agent.

1754
02:02:41,934 --> 02:02:44,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Is he a free bitch baby?

1755
02:02:45,738 --> 02:02:50,263
[SPEAKER_08]: He's not really saying he's jumped ship to go somewhere else, like some mega company or something like that.

1756
02:02:50,823 --> 02:02:52,005
[SPEAKER_08]: or what have you.

1757
02:02:52,845 --> 02:02:57,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft did come out and basically say that yes, he's leaving the company.

1758
02:02:57,891 --> 02:02:58,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for his service.

1759
02:02:59,112 --> 02:02:59,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Wish all the best.

1760
02:03:00,273 --> 02:03:03,096
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have any details to share about a potential successor.

1761
02:03:03,456 --> 02:03:08,742
[SPEAKER_08]: We can assure you that the Xbox Live Enforcement Squad will continue their work to help ensure a safer, more secure experience.

1762
02:03:10,083 --> 02:03:17,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, of course, the conclusion that many people have jumped to regarding this little resignation is that, oh, it's because of the hacks.

1763
02:03:18,025 --> 02:03:24,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Something's happening with the hacks, and he's stepping out because he knows something ugly is going to go down, and he doesn't want to go down with it.

1764
02:03:25,528 --> 02:03:27,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Like all the tinfoil hat people come out.

1765
02:03:27,968 --> 02:03:34,290
[SPEAKER_08]: And to some extent, I've been one of the harshest critics of Xbox around here and the way they've handled that whole mess.

1766
02:03:35,011 --> 02:03:36,071
[SPEAKER_08]: You mean they handled it?

1767
02:03:36,771 --> 02:04:04,521
[SPEAKER_08]: well yeah exactly Rhythm Party is like the first time I've turned on my Xbox in a month so you know I'm just but I don't think at the end of the day it really has anything to do with that because his role was more about keeping the Xbox live environment a safe haven if you will or a family friendly environment you know what I mean it's basically a safe place I don't know whatever you want to call it

1768
02:04:05,501 --> 02:04:08,763
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just very possible that after... It's like the Thor of the Banhammer.

1769
02:04:09,964 --> 02:04:10,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's be real.

1770
02:04:10,784 --> 02:04:11,584
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know this guy.

1771
02:04:11,645 --> 02:04:12,485
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know him personally.

1772
02:04:12,585 --> 02:04:13,706
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't read his blogs.

1773
02:04:13,766 --> 02:04:15,386
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't follow him on Twitter.

1774
02:04:15,567 --> 02:04:19,929
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard he's very accessible, but I have not chosen to access him.

1775
02:04:19,989 --> 02:04:21,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the thing, though.

1776
02:04:22,350 --> 02:04:28,553
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've been working at the same job 17 years, and so he's got to be, what, like almost 40?

1777
02:04:29,474 --> 02:04:33,556
[SPEAKER_08]: He's probably going through what some might call a midlife crisis.

1778
02:04:34,156 --> 02:04:36,678
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not saying it's necessarily a bad thing.

1779
02:04:36,698 --> 02:04:38,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Just tell him to buy a Ferrari and drive.

1780
02:04:39,059 --> 02:04:40,580
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not saying it's necessarily a bad thing.

1781
02:04:40,641 --> 02:04:45,804
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably just that moment a lot of people go through where it's like, is this what I want to do forever?

1782
02:04:46,164 --> 02:04:50,387
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe he decided I want to spend more time with family or I want to do something else.

1783
02:04:50,507 --> 02:04:56,992
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, as a director, he's probably built up a little bit of a nest egg and he's probably okay to do that.

1784
02:04:57,452 --> 02:05:20,263
[SPEAKER_08]: so what I'm trying to say is that I really don't think this has anything to do with the Xbox hacks and just this guy wants to go have a life hooray good for him it's great so meanwhile Xbox really does need to do something about the hacking but I don't think this guy has anything to do with that let's move on shall we

1785
02:05:21,829 --> 02:05:48,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Some comments from our chat room real quick on this TigerClaw says he was a co-host for Major Nelson's podcast I think I've listened to one episode of Major Nelson's podcast and it was many many years ago so sadly I wouldn't know that but that's interesting to know so I guess a lot of the community knows him through that too Breakman says he's leaving Xbox Live because he's tired of Xbox Live kids calling him the n-word or questioning his sexuality in vulgar ways on a regular basis

1786
02:05:48,456 --> 02:05:50,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of like how everybody gets treated on Xbox Live.

1787
02:05:52,659 --> 02:05:56,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, if that hasn't been fixed in the past, how long has Xbox Live been around now?

1788
02:05:56,601 --> 02:05:57,722
[SPEAKER_08]: About nine years?

1789
02:05:58,022 --> 02:06:00,243
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's going to get fixed anytime soon, I'd say.

1790
02:06:01,164 --> 02:06:01,404
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1791
02:06:02,165 --> 02:06:03,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that it makes it right.

1792
02:06:03,746 --> 02:06:04,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Just saying.

1793
02:06:05,267 --> 02:06:15,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe the Xbox lube or whatever the next Xbox ends up being called will have extreme anti-homophobe, anti-racist measures in it.

1794
02:06:15,973 --> 02:06:16,754
[SPEAKER_08]: But I wouldn't hold my breath.

1795
02:06:17,782 --> 02:06:18,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get to some emails!

1796
02:06:19,183 --> 02:06:19,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

1797
02:06:21,144 --> 02:06:26,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Every week you guys email us at mailbag at orangelawntrader.com We read some of our favorite emails on the air.

1798
02:06:27,147 --> 02:06:28,087
[SPEAKER_05]: And we stop the music.

1799
02:06:28,487 --> 02:06:28,627
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1800
02:06:29,888 --> 02:06:33,710
[SPEAKER_05]: I got one that says don't judge my grammar, but grammar was misspelled.

1801
02:06:34,410 --> 02:06:37,672
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to say who it was though because I'm not going to bring attention to that person.

1802
02:06:38,772 --> 02:06:43,595
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm grabbing a random email and here's one that actually has fantastic grammar.

1803
02:06:44,895 --> 02:06:50,578
[SPEAKER_05]: I found this great website where you can play NES, NES, okay Genesis is misspelled, etc.

1804
02:06:50,678 --> 02:06:51,978
[SPEAKER_05]: games on your computer.

1805
02:06:52,058 --> 02:06:54,499
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm writing this because I know DarkSakura is into old games.

1806
02:06:54,920 --> 02:06:59,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep up the good work and here's another 10 great years of Orange Lounge Radio and that's sincerely CD Thunder.

1807
02:07:01,182 --> 02:07:10,106
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to point out in 10 more years we'll be as old or if not older than this guy who just resigned from Microsoft and we'll probably have a midlife crisis.

1808
02:07:10,566 --> 02:07:12,547
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to point out that he didn't send the link.

1809
02:07:13,943 --> 02:07:14,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1810
02:07:14,284 --> 02:07:14,624
[SPEAKER_08]: He told you?

1811
02:07:14,904 --> 02:07:16,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, check out this great website.

1812
02:07:16,546 --> 02:07:19,329
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called Sincerely Me.

1813
02:07:21,010 --> 02:07:21,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1814
02:07:22,352 --> 02:07:23,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Next email.

1815
02:07:23,093 --> 02:07:27,978
[SPEAKER_05]: This comes from... Oh, never mind.

1816
02:07:29,379 --> 02:07:31,942
[SPEAKER_05]: This was actually personally for us, so I'm saving it.

1817
02:07:32,542 --> 02:07:33,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I really want to see it.

1818
02:07:34,224 --> 02:07:34,985
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about mics.

1819
02:07:36,388 --> 02:07:41,329
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm under an NDA, I don't know Am I going to love this as much as D2 or is there too much hype at this point?

1820
02:08:04,992 --> 02:08:06,993
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think I'm under an NDA.

1821
02:08:07,173 --> 02:08:09,794
[SPEAKER_08]: If I am, oops, there's so much information out there.

1822
02:08:09,954 --> 02:08:12,275
[SPEAKER_08]: No, there's stuff on YouTube, people playing through it.

1823
02:08:12,315 --> 02:08:13,215
[SPEAKER_08]: It can't be under NDA.

1824
02:08:13,955 --> 02:08:18,697
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to say anything that... I'll tell you what, the last time I played through it was in November.

1825
02:08:19,297 --> 02:08:22,358
[SPEAKER_08]: I probably gave it a more extensive review on one of the shows back then.

1826
02:08:23,279 --> 02:08:24,239
[SPEAKER_08]: But I enjoyed it.

1827
02:08:24,339 --> 02:08:25,720
[SPEAKER_08]: I enjoyed the older Diablo games.

1828
02:08:26,680 --> 02:08:28,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people call it, oh, it's just a click fest.

1829
02:08:28,380 --> 02:08:29,581
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nothing but click, click, click, click.

1830
02:08:30,051 --> 02:08:59,612
[SPEAKER_08]: but um no I thought it was fun I had a lot of fun like um Shane who has sometimes been known as Mikulatov on the show and I um he was in the beta too and we did some co-op online and we had a lot of fun just kind of playing it together and exploring the dungeons um it's very similar to what you remember in Diablo 2 there's a few quality of life improvements like I seem to remember oh god it's been a few months since I played it now but I seem to remember that like you don't have to carry around a bunch of town portal scrolls because like there's an item in your inventory that lets you just make one

1831
02:09:00,032 --> 02:09:04,114
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, just kind of like little things like that that help it, you know, feel.

1832
02:09:04,254 --> 02:09:05,854
[SPEAKER_05]: You said quality of life improvements?

1833
02:09:06,275 --> 02:09:07,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it make you sexy and you know it?

1834
02:09:08,235 --> 02:09:09,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it does, actually.

1835
02:09:09,876 --> 02:09:11,357
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of the classes were really fun to play.

1836
02:09:11,437 --> 02:09:14,718
[SPEAKER_08]: I really enjoyed Monk, but there was another one I played I didn't like as much.

1837
02:09:15,418 --> 02:09:16,319
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was The Witch Doctor.

1838
02:09:16,339 --> 02:09:17,059
[SPEAKER_05]: That was The Chip Monk.

1839
02:09:17,379 --> 02:09:18,980
[SPEAKER_08]: No, The Witch Doctor I didn't like as much.

1840
02:09:19,200 --> 02:09:19,780
[SPEAKER_08]: But I liked The Monk.

1841
02:09:21,260 --> 02:09:24,065
[SPEAKER_05]: To continue with the email, any tidbit of info would be appreciated.

1842
02:09:24,125 --> 02:09:24,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

1843
02:09:24,847 --> 02:09:26,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Your loyal turtle in Philly, Sirius Turtle.

1844
02:09:27,152 --> 02:09:27,513
[SPEAKER_05]: P.S.

1845
02:09:28,956 --> 02:09:30,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard that Loki secretly works for Nintendo.

1846
02:09:30,980 --> 02:09:31,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom!

1847
02:09:33,041 --> 02:09:34,422
[SPEAKER_09]: I secretly work for Nintendo.

1848
02:09:34,542 --> 02:09:34,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Boom.

1849
02:09:35,263 --> 02:09:35,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Boom.

1850
02:09:35,583 --> 02:09:35,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Boom.

1851
02:09:36,144 --> 02:09:36,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Blocks.

1852
02:09:37,645 --> 02:09:38,286
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish.

1853
02:09:38,606 --> 02:09:42,750
[SPEAKER_09]: I honestly wish I did because I'd be getting a lot more money.

1854
02:09:42,870 --> 02:09:46,493
[SPEAKER_08]: If you thought Reggie knew how to kick ass and take names, Loki would be in there.

1855
02:09:48,114 --> 02:09:49,515
[SPEAKER_08]: He'd flip a table the first day.

1856
02:09:50,736 --> 02:09:51,357
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish.

1857
02:09:51,417 --> 02:09:53,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, would you flip a table if you worked for Nintendo?

1858
02:09:53,699 --> 02:09:54,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck that.

1859
02:09:54,059 --> 02:09:55,200
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd want to stay unemployed.

1860
02:09:55,220 --> 02:09:55,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1861
02:09:56,855 --> 02:09:58,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so email, last email.

1862
02:09:58,876 --> 02:10:04,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear OLR, okay, recently I purchased a copy of The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Game of the Year Edition.

1863
02:10:04,657 --> 02:10:07,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm enjoying it for the most part with the exception of one thing.

1864
02:10:07,778 --> 02:10:15,560
[SPEAKER_05]: The Game of the Year Edition has a glitch in which when you're a vampire and you receive a quest to cure yourself.

1865
02:10:16,800 --> 02:10:18,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, granted, I like being a vampire.

1866
02:10:18,801 --> 02:10:23,322
[SPEAKER_05]: I was strong, fast, didn't sparkle, but it made my character weak to fire and sunlight turns me into a crispy gritter.

1867
02:10:23,922 --> 02:10:25,683
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad I'm not the only one that uses that term.

1868
02:10:26,603 --> 02:10:27,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, wait, wait.

1869
02:10:27,783 --> 02:10:29,464
[SPEAKER_08]: You mean an Elder Scrolls game is glitchy?

1870
02:10:32,065 --> 02:10:38,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Now on that quest, you talk to a witch and after running errands for her, she sends you out for ingredients for the potion to cure yourself permanently.

1871
02:10:38,446 --> 02:10:42,287
[SPEAKER_05]: But one of the ingredients will not be accepted now they patched this out of the original game.

1872
02:10:42,608 --> 02:10:49,349
[SPEAKER_05]: But when they booted out the Knights of the Nine DLC, the glitch re-arose and there's no way around that with Game of the Year.

1873
02:10:49,870 --> 02:10:53,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Now on another note, I've been playing a Japanese PSP demo for Final Fantasy Type-O.

1874
02:10:54,031 --> 02:10:54,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to play that!

1875
02:10:55,411 --> 02:11:00,412
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wondering if this will ever come into America and how it ties in with the Fabula Nova Crystallis.

1876
02:11:01,092 --> 02:11:03,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for reading my email signed Haseo Sumirogawa.

1877
02:11:03,993 --> 02:11:07,174
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't believe it is part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis.

1878
02:11:07,234 --> 02:11:08,734
[SPEAKER_05]: It was supposed to be Akito.

1879
02:11:08,974 --> 02:11:11,335
[SPEAKER_08]: It was originally going to be the mobile phone one, right?

1880
02:11:11,375 --> 02:11:13,676
[SPEAKER_08]: But they just totally changed it and now it's the PSP one.

1881
02:11:13,696 --> 02:11:14,936
[SPEAKER_05]: This is supposed to be the Akito 13.

1882
02:11:15,176 --> 02:11:16,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but it's not now.

1883
02:11:17,316 --> 02:11:18,257
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to play it.

1884
02:11:18,337 --> 02:11:19,257
[SPEAKER_05]: I really want to play it.

1885
02:11:19,665 --> 02:11:24,987
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably going to kind of feel like the same universe as XIII, but it won't be like any of the same characters.

1886
02:11:25,007 --> 02:11:34,850
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be like Versus, because Final Fantasy Versus XIII doesn't look like it has shit in common with Final Fantasy XIII, except I'm assuming it takes place on Cocoon.

1887
02:11:35,130 --> 02:11:35,650
[SPEAKER_05]: No characters?

1888
02:11:36,290 --> 02:11:36,430
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1889
02:11:36,450 --> 02:11:37,090
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all different people?

1890
02:11:37,270 --> 02:11:37,390
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1891
02:11:37,410 --> 02:11:39,171
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even think it takes place on Cocoon.

1892
02:11:40,131 --> 02:11:42,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I don't know what the hell... I want to play it when you're done.

1893
02:11:42,751 --> 02:11:42,911
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1894
02:11:43,011 --> 02:11:43,772
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have Versus.

1895
02:11:43,832 --> 02:11:44,473
[SPEAKER_08]: I have 13 too.

1896
02:11:44,513 --> 02:11:46,315
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I was talking about.

1897
02:11:46,896 --> 02:11:49,159
[SPEAKER_08]: If I get it back in less than a year this time.

1898
02:11:51,281 --> 02:11:55,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, 13 Versus has nothing to do with anything.

1899
02:11:55,406 --> 02:11:56,467
[SPEAKER_09]: 13 Versus looks good though.

1900
02:11:58,390 --> 02:11:59,071
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks really good.

1901
02:11:59,391 --> 02:12:01,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, we got an email from PlayStation Network.

1902
02:12:03,168 --> 02:12:04,409
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably a hack email or a phishing email.

1903
02:12:04,429 --> 02:12:07,691
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a hack email, it's that they're changing the PlayStation Network.

1904
02:12:07,731 --> 02:12:14,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Info at playstation.messages4.com Yeah, that's a... I did get one for the PlayStation Network.

1905
02:12:14,775 --> 02:12:20,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, they're merging PlayStation Network into the Sony Entertainment Network or whatever.

1906
02:12:20,498 --> 02:12:22,639
[SPEAKER_08]: The Sony Entertainment Network of You Can't Sue Us.

1907
02:12:24,120 --> 02:12:24,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Watch us.

1908
02:12:25,241 --> 02:12:29,984
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, hey, if they give us no reason for legal action, we're not going to say anything.

1909
02:12:30,560 --> 02:12:37,262
[SPEAKER_09]: For the record, I have not updated my system, so therefore I have not accepted the end user license agreement yet.

1910
02:12:38,682 --> 02:12:41,143
[SPEAKER_09]: I will still sue you if I feel like it.

1911
02:12:41,463 --> 02:12:43,324
[SPEAKER_09]: But I will get my southern lawyer.

1912
02:12:43,344 --> 02:12:44,444
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1913
02:12:47,997 --> 02:12:49,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we miss it?

1914
02:12:49,679 --> 02:12:50,080
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it?

1915
02:12:50,900 --> 02:12:51,321
[SPEAKER_08]: You're done?

1916
02:12:51,721 --> 02:12:52,342
[SPEAKER_08]: No more emails.

1917
02:12:52,682 --> 02:12:53,103
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm done.

1918
02:12:53,143 --> 02:12:53,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's the fork?

1919
02:12:54,144 --> 02:12:56,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's go to the FUs of the week.

1920
02:12:56,286 --> 02:12:58,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Every week on this show we like to get angsty.

1921
02:12:58,348 --> 02:12:58,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

1922
02:12:59,349 --> 02:13:00,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we can.

1923
02:13:18,516 --> 02:13:20,246
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to...

1924
02:13:24,315 --> 02:13:26,896
[SPEAKER_05]: God, you know, I had it in my head and I forgot what it was.

1925
02:13:26,916 --> 02:13:33,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, the girl outside of Whole Foods today who was trying to get me to sign her petition.

1926
02:13:34,120 --> 02:13:35,580
[SPEAKER_05]: I normally don't have a problem with that.

1927
02:13:35,620 --> 02:13:37,021
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all for political action.

1928
02:13:37,521 --> 02:13:47,266
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't sign those petitions from people that are just standing outside the door because there's been a lot of issue lately with people trying to get your information and using it against you.

1929
02:13:47,946 --> 02:13:50,767
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't really have... I thought she was legit.

1930
02:13:50,807 --> 02:13:52,148
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm not going to make a judgment on her.

1931
02:13:52,768 --> 02:13:53,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate football!

1932
02:14:08,410 --> 02:14:15,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't stop me with- I mean, she didn't know that, but I was like, I was like, if I say I'm in a hurry, the correct response will be, oh, I'm sorry.

1933
02:14:15,511 --> 02:14:15,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

1934
02:14:16,551 --> 02:14:16,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

1935
02:14:17,292 --> 02:14:18,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Not trying to start a conversation with me.

1936
02:14:19,792 --> 02:14:21,232
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still not gonna sign your shit.

1937
02:14:21,352 --> 02:14:22,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at our website when you have a chance.

1938
02:14:24,393 --> 02:14:27,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I would sign it through the website if I had credentials, you know.

1939
02:14:28,234 --> 02:14:32,654
[SPEAKER_05]: But that and how much my feet hurt yesterday, oh my god, okay.

1940
02:14:33,354 --> 02:14:35,275
[SPEAKER_05]: But I had a really good time at museums with Becky.

1941
02:14:36,055 --> 02:14:36,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of fun.

1942
02:14:37,813 --> 02:14:38,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they really crowded?

1943
02:14:40,055 --> 02:14:44,798
[SPEAKER_05]: We went to the Children's Discovery Museum with Julian in the morning.

1944
02:14:45,058 --> 02:14:47,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't do it on the freebie day.

1945
02:14:47,460 --> 02:14:48,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Just get a membership.

1946
02:14:48,380 --> 02:14:49,141
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so much easier.

1947
02:14:51,122 --> 02:14:53,204
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, he had a good time, but it was really crowded.

1948
02:14:54,705 --> 02:15:00,809
[SPEAKER_05]: But when we went to the Crocker, we got there right around like, I want to say one something.

1949
02:15:01,670 --> 02:15:07,314
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was busy, yeah, but it wasn't prohibitively busy, if you know what I mean.

1950
02:15:07,779 --> 02:15:09,100
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1951
02:15:29,137 --> 02:15:31,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, that was it.

1952
02:15:31,239 --> 02:15:34,622
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what they say, and I'm sure they've stolen this from somebody.

1953
02:15:35,523 --> 02:15:37,985
[SPEAKER_09]: If it ain't Baroque, then don't fix it.

1954
02:15:38,025 --> 02:15:39,506
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard that before.

1955
02:15:39,766 --> 02:15:41,688
[SPEAKER_05]: If it ain't Baroque, it's probably Renaissance.

1956
02:15:42,248 --> 02:15:44,030
[SPEAKER_08]: It was from Beauty and the Beast.

1957
02:15:44,550 --> 02:15:45,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was Lumiere.

1958
02:15:45,931 --> 02:15:46,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Lumiere says it.

1959
02:15:47,012 --> 02:15:48,673
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Cogsworth says it.

1960
02:15:48,794 --> 02:15:52,597
[SPEAKER_05]: And Becky even quoted that when we were at the Baroque Art.

1961
02:15:52,637 --> 02:15:54,518
[SPEAKER_08]: You just quoted Beauty and the Beast, Loki.

1962
02:15:54,558 --> 02:15:54,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, whatever.

1963
02:15:59,063 --> 02:16:00,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's be real, though.

1964
02:16:00,204 --> 02:16:07,030
[SPEAKER_08]: If this program were made up of dancing, you know, housewares, Loki would be the scene clock.

1965
02:16:10,333 --> 02:16:12,015
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to be Mrs. Potts.

1966
02:16:13,836 --> 02:16:14,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the cupboard.

1967
02:16:16,659 --> 02:16:17,279
[SPEAKER_05]: The wardrobe.

1968
02:16:17,359 --> 02:16:18,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Clearly, I'm Lumiere.

1969
02:16:18,460 --> 02:16:19,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, moving on.

1970
02:16:20,002 --> 02:16:21,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you're so French, Rob.

1971
02:16:21,963 --> 02:16:22,543
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm on fire.

1972
02:16:23,904 --> 02:16:28,027
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even know if this is really an FU, but I guess it is.

1973
02:16:28,647 --> 02:16:33,430
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just very sick and tired of the whole argument that used games steal away from developers.

1974
02:16:33,671 --> 02:16:37,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, let me fucking... I mean, come on, developers, you should know how this fucking works.

1975
02:16:38,454 --> 02:16:39,254
[SPEAKER_09]: You make a game.

1976
02:16:39,594 --> 02:16:40,795
[SPEAKER_09]: The game gets pressed.

1977
02:16:41,475 --> 02:16:44,858
[SPEAKER_09]: The publisher sells the game to the retailer.

1978
02:16:45,851 --> 02:16:48,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Therefore, there is money being exchanged there.

1979
02:16:48,412 --> 02:16:55,674
[SPEAKER_09]: It is up to the retailer to then sell the game so that they're not out the money that they paid for the game and they make a small profit on top of that.

1980
02:16:56,674 --> 02:17:05,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Then maybe, as an incentive, you may get some extra money depending on how well the game sells.

1981
02:17:05,837 --> 02:17:13,280
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the only money that is getting eaten up by used game sales and it's a very small fraction of that

1982
02:17:13,940 --> 02:17:15,461
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1983
02:17:37,489 --> 02:17:44,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so you can shut the fuck up because you still made your fucking money and used games didn't do shit for you guys.

1984
02:17:45,492 --> 02:17:52,354
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, it's just a stupid argument and I always hear people going, we're stealing money from the developers if we buy used games.

1985
02:17:52,694 --> 02:17:52,934
[SPEAKER_09]: No!

1986
02:17:53,235 --> 02:17:57,516
[SPEAKER_09]: It does not fucking steal any money from anybody because those games are already goddamn paid for.

1987
02:17:57,736 --> 02:18:01,838
[SPEAKER_09]: If they all sat on shelves, they don't fucking care, they have their money already.

1988
02:18:02,478 --> 02:18:03,438
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the whole point.

1989
02:18:05,179 --> 02:18:05,519
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

1990
02:18:07,429 --> 02:18:09,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well, shit, how am I supposed to follow that?

1991
02:18:10,031 --> 02:18:13,133
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to... I want pudding.

1992
02:18:13,393 --> 02:18:19,778
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to a lot of the same stuff that was bothering me last week, but I want to say thank you to the person who reached out to me on Twitter to talk about that.

1993
02:18:19,798 --> 02:18:20,638
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that was very nice.

1994
02:18:20,678 --> 02:18:22,179
[SPEAKER_08]: You know who you are.

1995
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:36,510
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to say F you to the fact that oh my god, I went to California Pizza Kitchen last night, and granted there was a rather large party of us, but it took an hour and 15 minutes to get a table when we were quoted 30, and then even then they sat us at two separate tables.

1996
02:18:37,330 --> 02:18:38,051
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see you next time.

1997
02:18:59,634 --> 02:19:01,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, Becky orders the salads every time we go.

1998
02:19:01,455 --> 02:19:03,316
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why they discriminated against you right there.

1999
02:19:04,157 --> 02:19:05,538
[SPEAKER_08]: The salads are really good.

2000
02:19:05,598 --> 02:19:09,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they have a whole page dedicated to salads, and they have really good salads.

2001
02:19:09,820 --> 02:19:12,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you wouldn't know it, but... Yeah, I wouldn't know it.

2002
02:19:12,922 --> 02:19:15,564
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not California salad kitchen, but it could be.

2003
02:19:15,584 --> 02:19:17,125
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's funny?

2004
02:19:17,205 --> 02:19:17,445
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

2005
02:19:17,785 --> 02:19:19,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Julian calls his bedroom his pizza kitchen.

2006
02:19:22,987 --> 02:19:23,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Listen, we know your type.

2007
02:19:24,028 --> 02:19:25,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Fresh Choice is down the street.

2008
02:19:25,469 --> 02:19:26,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Get the fuck out of here.

2009
02:19:27,291 --> 02:19:28,452
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where I had lunch yesterday.

2010
02:19:28,472 --> 02:19:30,393
[SPEAKER_08]: You fags are going to come in here and order salad?

2011
02:19:32,195 --> 02:19:33,276
[SPEAKER_08]: That's exactly what happened.

2012
02:19:33,296 --> 02:19:34,336
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what that makes me think of?

2013
02:19:34,376 --> 02:19:34,617
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2014
02:19:34,797 --> 02:19:36,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, Brack.

2015
02:19:36,758 --> 02:19:38,980
[SPEAKER_03]: And she orders something called a salad.

2016
02:19:40,900 --> 02:19:42,542
[SPEAKER_03]: That to me is love.

2017
02:19:42,642 --> 02:19:51,671
[SPEAKER_08]: The salt on the wound was watching all these high school kids coming in there all dressed up like it's fucking prom or something.

2018
02:19:51,791 --> 02:19:53,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it prom season?

2019
02:19:53,993 --> 02:19:54,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

2020
02:19:54,474 --> 02:19:54,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Winter ball.

2021
02:19:55,335 --> 02:19:58,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Have things come back so much that they're going to graduate next month?

2022
02:19:58,538 --> 02:20:00,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Winter ball, I guess, because...

2023
02:20:00,980 --> 02:20:11,842
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, but there was a hell of people all dressed up and like all these kids and their fancy pants dresses because California Pizza Kitchen is the nice part of town where all the rich spoiled kids live What, Arden?

2024
02:20:12,582 --> 02:20:12,802
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

2025
02:20:12,922 --> 02:20:13,602
[SPEAKER_08]: You went to the other one?

2026
02:20:13,762 --> 02:20:18,623
[SPEAKER_08]: We went to the one where Dave and Buster's is, the Fountains See what I mean?

2027
02:20:18,703 --> 02:20:28,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to Arden Don't give a shit at Arden Go hang out with the poor people like me at Arden Arden don't give a shit

2028
02:20:29,595 --> 02:20:33,680
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm going to go over there, I'm just going to go to Mikuni, anyway, or Dave & Buster's.

2029
02:20:34,300 --> 02:20:36,923
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a party at 9, though.

2030
02:20:36,943 --> 02:20:38,605
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hard to find something everybody likes.

2031
02:20:39,606 --> 02:20:40,927
[SPEAKER_08]: So we went to California Salad Kitchen.

2032
02:20:41,548 --> 02:20:42,749
[SPEAKER_08]: We went to Dave & Buster's.

2033
02:20:44,671 --> 02:20:46,854
[SPEAKER_08]: I suggested Dave & Buster's, but I got shot down.

2034
02:20:46,874 --> 02:20:47,875
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't want to do that.

2035
02:20:48,900 --> 02:20:49,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's be real, though.

2036
02:20:49,620 --> 02:20:51,483
[SPEAKER_08]: The food at Dave & Buster's is kind of mediocre.

2037
02:20:52,444 --> 02:20:55,508
[SPEAKER_08]: And the night before Super Bowl Sunday, we were kind of afraid it was going to be a mess.

2038
02:20:56,669 --> 02:20:59,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, we didn't fare much better at California Pizza Kitchen.

2039
02:20:59,132 --> 02:21:04,759
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, can we please not turn this into a California Pizza Kitchen show and talk about more news, Loki?

2040
02:21:05,700 --> 02:21:19,753
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, not to be outdone, I guess, in Monkey See, Monkey Do, or whatever, you know, Sony is pulling another move with the Wii U type controllers.

2041
02:21:20,734 --> 02:21:27,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Sony has patented their own Wii U-esque device, and it looks like a tablet.

2042
02:21:27,300 --> 02:21:27,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2043
02:21:28,041 --> 02:21:29,182
[SPEAKER_09]: What more is there to say?

2044
02:21:30,262 --> 02:21:31,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Tablet with buttons on it.

2045
02:21:31,522 --> 02:21:34,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, it looks like kind of a cross between a Game Boy and an iPod.

2046
02:21:36,004 --> 02:21:37,245
[SPEAKER_09]: And that looks really weird.

2047
02:21:38,085 --> 02:21:45,168
[SPEAKER_09]: It shows some augmented reality thing where this guy looks like his character through the tablet.

2048
02:21:45,368 --> 02:21:46,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do they need to do that?

2049
02:21:46,608 --> 02:21:54,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't they just say two weeks ago that the PlayStation Vita was capable of everything that they're saying the whole Wii U will do?

2050
02:21:54,750 --> 02:21:55,170
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2051
02:21:55,310 --> 02:21:55,950
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks weird.

2052
02:21:56,050 --> 02:22:02,072
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like it's going to support multiple tablets and that it'll almost be some sort of augmented reality thing.

2053
02:22:04,813 --> 02:22:11,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, it's titled the very generic position-dependent gaming 3D controller and handheld as remote.

2054
02:22:12,855 --> 02:22:18,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Device would track its own location as input to video game and would render an

2055
02:22:18,817 --> 02:22:24,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Avatar on a mobile device such that it appears to overlay a competing user in the real world.

2056
02:22:29,879 --> 02:22:30,219
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2057
02:22:32,559 --> 02:22:35,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it's something that they're going to implement to other tablets?

2058
02:22:36,920 --> 02:22:45,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it'll be a cheaper option as opposed to getting a Vita, but then why would you kind of bite the, you know, take away from one to give to the other?

2059
02:22:45,762 --> 02:22:46,802
[SPEAKER_08]: It just seems a little weird.

2060
02:22:48,217 --> 02:23:14,362
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know I do like how the fact that they're a little generic console that they use on there looks like the same console that they have rendered in Grand Theft Auto their like generic Xbox PS3 console it's kind of funny alright well let's move on and talk about speaking of the Vita and all that this is seriously the game that might convince me to get a Vita when the Vita's out which is what like next week or two weeks I think

2061
02:23:14,562 --> 02:23:16,148
[SPEAKER_08]: The early release is next week, right?

2062
02:23:17,212 --> 02:23:17,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Valentine's Day.

2063
02:23:17,975 --> 02:23:19,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Day after Valentine's Day.

2064
02:23:20,502 --> 02:23:33,948
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not that far away from the Vita launch over here, and I gotta say, this is the game that makes me... Sorry, I get so distracted because there's this giant Gotham City Imposters ad on the page, and it just makes me think about how this really disturbs Jamie.

2065
02:23:33,988 --> 02:23:37,289
[SPEAKER_08]: She really doesn't like what this game is doing, even though she's never played it.

2066
02:23:38,269 --> 02:23:39,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't like the concept.

2067
02:23:39,910 --> 02:23:40,350
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I know.

2068
02:23:40,370 --> 02:23:40,991
[SPEAKER_04]: It won't be fun to me.

2069
02:23:41,251 --> 02:23:43,712
[SPEAKER_08]: I downloaded the beta, but I just haven't run it yet.

2070
02:23:44,272 --> 02:23:46,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, the game on the Vita...

2071
02:23:48,206 --> 02:24:10,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Luminous, Electronic Symphony I gotta say, the song list looks damn impressive There is 34 tracks in it, and a lot of it is really good licensed stuff There's stuff from Cascade, 4AM is in here, Bang Bang Bang, Mark Ronson Disco Infiltrator by LCD Sound System, Alan will like that

2072
02:24:10,623 --> 02:24:29,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Dissolve by the Chemical Brothers, Embracing the Future by BT, Flying High by Faithless, Good Girl by Benny Benassi, Hey Boy Hey Girl by the Chemical Brothers, an Air Song, Milo, Orbital, System F, 808 State, Gold Frap, Aeroplane, Deep Dish, Apex Twin, Pet Shop Boys.

2073
02:24:29,649 --> 02:24:30,789
[SPEAKER_08]: This looks fucking great.

2074
02:24:31,109 --> 02:24:33,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I'm really excited about this game.

2075
02:24:33,830 --> 02:24:37,291
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and a lot of it sounds really awesome.

2076
02:24:37,351 --> 02:24:37,511
[SPEAKER_08]: So,

2077
02:24:38,391 --> 02:24:44,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, if you haven't seen the song list for this, you probably want to head over to the Luminous page on Facebook and check this out.

2078
02:24:44,813 --> 02:24:54,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, yeah, I'm definitely, if I pick up a Vita launch day, which is looking very likely because I did my taxes, and I'm looking good.

2079
02:24:54,396 --> 02:24:56,557
[SPEAKER_08]: So I might be able to get one of these when they come out.

2080
02:24:56,757 --> 02:24:58,717
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think my wife would let me.

2081
02:24:59,317 --> 02:25:00,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Aw, womp womp.

2082
02:25:01,338 --> 02:25:04,299
[SPEAKER_09]: I am considering selling my 3DS to get a Vita.

2083
02:25:04,359 --> 02:25:04,659
[SPEAKER_03]: To me.

2084
02:25:07,580 --> 02:25:07,880
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

2085
02:25:09,656 --> 02:25:10,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Thinking about it, huh?

2086
02:25:11,697 --> 02:25:20,963
[SPEAKER_08]: The only drawback to the whole Luminous thing is that I am still feeling a little bit bitter about the fact that I've bought Luminous like five times now.

2087
02:25:21,163 --> 02:25:21,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Like what?

2088
02:25:21,443 --> 02:25:24,805
[SPEAKER_08]: There was Luminous, Luminous 2, Luminous PC, Luminous Xbox 360.

2089
02:25:25,105 --> 02:25:28,367
[SPEAKER_08]: I never did get the PlayStation 3 one, but I seriously thought about it.

2090
02:25:28,727 --> 02:25:42,597
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm, I'm not in a huge hurry to get a Vita cause like, you know, the launch games are cool and you know, Konamari might be fun, but it's not a like, there's not anything that I must, must, must, must have on the Vita right now.

2091
02:25:42,657 --> 02:25:47,260
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of like, well, these are the ones I would pick, but I don't know.

2092
02:25:47,540 --> 02:25:52,544
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, I might want to wait, you know, wait until fourth quarter or something like that.

2093
02:25:53,746 --> 02:25:56,087
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought Loki was about to say I'm thinking about selling my wife to get it

2094
02:26:23,507 --> 02:26:23,867
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

2095
02:26:25,488 --> 02:26:25,628
No.

2096
02:26:27,108 --> 02:26:27,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't do that.

2097
02:26:28,849 --> 02:26:29,890
[SPEAKER_08]: She'd complain about that.

2098
02:26:30,590 --> 02:26:31,690
[SPEAKER_08]: She would not like that.

2099
02:26:31,770 --> 02:26:32,571
[SPEAKER_08]: She would not like that.

2100
02:26:33,411 --> 02:26:41,914
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, just a few more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to the Twitter topics and the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2101
02:26:42,274 --> 02:26:43,535
[SPEAKER_08]: But first, a few more stories.

2102
02:26:43,615 --> 02:26:44,135
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura?

2103
02:26:45,596 --> 02:26:47,596
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually have to stop and correct Bones006.

2104
02:26:48,717 --> 02:26:51,338
[SPEAKER_05]: The letters U-R do not spell anything.

2105
02:26:52,697 --> 02:26:53,578
[SPEAKER_05]: It spells er.

2106
02:26:55,178 --> 02:26:59,601
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Y-O-U apostrophe R-E.

2107
02:27:00,261 --> 02:27:02,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear Lord, stop looking ignorant.

2108
02:27:04,084 --> 02:27:10,187
[SPEAKER_08]: When you have U-R, that's two-thirds of an earn, which DarkSakura will have you end up in if you don't change your ways.

2109
02:27:13,509 --> 02:27:30,934
[SPEAKER_05]: be nice to the listeners Jamie, be nice to the listeners I am being nice I'm doing them a serious favor that will help them get a job and earn the respect of people around them so fuck your Yankee Blue Jeans there was a part where you did video game news mmm

2110
02:27:32,054 --> 02:27:41,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, there was a comment by Kaz Harai who's going to be going in as CEO of Sony and he thinks that Sony's kind of in trouble.

2111
02:27:42,042 --> 02:27:45,505
[SPEAKER_05]: He spoke with the Wall Street Journal about their financial report.

2112
02:27:45,525 --> 02:28:00,117
[SPEAKER_05]: As you remember, they lost like 1.3 billion pounds because I'm going off a British site so in their last financial quarter and expect to report a loss of 2.9 billion dollars for the full year.

2113
02:28:03,701 --> 02:28:17,678
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought turning around the PlayStation business was going to be the toughest challenge of my career, but I guess it's not.

2114
02:28:18,338 --> 02:28:19,480
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one issue after another.

2115
02:28:19,620 --> 02:28:21,302
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like, holy shit, now what?

2116
02:28:23,593 --> 02:28:31,078
[SPEAKER_05]: and saying that his strategy for recovery basically means we're not going to rest on our laurels anymore.

2117
02:28:31,138 --> 02:28:33,560
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to really push the user experience.

2118
02:28:34,861 --> 02:28:41,285
[SPEAKER_05]: He says that they need to buckle down and be realistic but people are coming around to the idea even though not everyone's on board.

2119
02:28:42,126 --> 02:28:43,987
[SPEAKER_05]: If they don't catch up, they're going to die.

2120
02:28:47,386 --> 02:28:53,529
[SPEAKER_08]: This just strikes me really weird that somebody like that would say, holy shit, now what, in an interview.

2121
02:28:53,689 --> 02:28:56,691
[SPEAKER_08]: But, I mean, I'm looking at the source in the Wall Street Journal right here.

2122
02:28:56,771 --> 02:28:57,191
[SPEAKER_08]: There it is.

2123
02:28:57,231 --> 02:28:59,032
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just weird.

2124
02:28:59,052 --> 02:29:01,653
[SPEAKER_08]: That strikes me as odd.

2125
02:29:02,753 --> 02:29:06,395
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we can swear all we want, but we're not CEOs of Sony.

2126
02:29:06,655 --> 02:29:08,156
[SPEAKER_05]: And that kid is flipping somebody off.

2127
02:29:10,188 --> 02:29:12,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, he totally is in this little preview.

2128
02:29:12,411 --> 02:29:12,911
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't notice that.

2129
02:29:12,931 --> 02:29:13,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Trailer for what?

2130
02:29:13,892 --> 02:29:14,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Chronicle?

2131
02:29:14,933 --> 02:29:17,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that that movie you were talking about a few weeks ago?

2132
02:29:17,917 --> 02:29:18,577
[SPEAKER_08]: You really wanted to see?

2133
02:29:19,038 --> 02:29:20,059
[SPEAKER_08]: They came out in theaters this week.

2134
02:29:20,079 --> 02:29:20,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you know that?

2135
02:29:20,519 --> 02:29:22,001
[SPEAKER_08]: It was number one at the box office.

2136
02:29:23,263 --> 02:29:23,783
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't say.

2137
02:29:24,684 --> 02:29:26,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you go see it or did you see it?

2138
02:29:27,027 --> 02:29:29,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Just that ad makes me think, fuck you, clouds.

2139
02:29:29,770 --> 02:29:29,990
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

2140
02:29:30,130 --> 02:29:31,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, look at the clouds.

2141
02:29:33,018 --> 02:29:34,038
[SPEAKER_08]: They're flipping him off too?

2142
02:29:34,118 --> 02:29:34,419
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2143
02:29:34,459 --> 02:29:36,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's the cloud's fingers too.

2144
02:29:36,980 --> 02:29:37,740
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of interesting.

2145
02:29:38,340 --> 02:29:40,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, so back to the story at hand.

2146
02:29:41,922 --> 02:29:49,305
[SPEAKER_08]: It's weird that Sony... I mean, I feel like Sony's in a better place now so much more than they were four years ago.

2147
02:29:49,345 --> 02:29:52,146
[SPEAKER_08]: They were a hot mess when PlayStation 3 first came out.

2148
02:29:52,626 --> 02:29:57,308
[SPEAKER_08]: But now things are getting a little better, but there are still some big falls that they make.

2149
02:29:57,448 --> 02:29:58,969
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't think the move...

2150
02:30:00,427 --> 02:30:07,098
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, as nice as the move is, I do think the move feels a lot better than the Wii, as it should.

2151
02:30:07,138 --> 02:30:08,460
[SPEAKER_08]: The technology's a little newer.

2152
02:30:08,901 --> 02:30:12,467
[SPEAKER_08]: But they never really came out with that must-have game for it, you know what I mean?

2153
02:30:12,847 --> 02:30:14,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything kind of felt like a copycat of the Wii.

2154
02:30:15,325 --> 02:30:30,474
[SPEAKER_08]: and I think that's part of where a lot of their losses come from but at the same time I pretty much play games on my PS3 almost exclusively right now unless it's like exclusive on 360 or there's people I know on Xbox 360 that I can play the games with

2155
02:30:30,954 --> 02:30:34,518
[SPEAKER_08]: or a deliberate multiplayer game and all my friends are playing it on 360.

2156
02:30:36,219 --> 02:30:38,902
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just interesting that Sony is losing all this money.

2157
02:30:41,364 --> 02:30:45,788
[SPEAKER_08]: But I guess, now, is this considering other arms of Sony too?

2158
02:30:45,908 --> 02:30:53,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Like not just PSP but maybe like, or excuse me, not just like PlayStation and that stuff but like movies?

2159
02:30:54,496 --> 02:30:55,918
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess turn that around too?

2160
02:30:56,238 --> 02:30:59,319
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's mostly non-gaming.

2161
02:30:59,359 --> 02:31:01,100
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's more of their electronics.

2162
02:31:01,340 --> 02:31:03,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Because their electronics are fucking expensive.

2163
02:31:04,181 --> 02:31:07,303
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, just insanely expensive.

2164
02:31:08,323 --> 02:31:16,026
[SPEAKER_09]: As a promotion thing, we got a gift card to Sony, and their shit is so fucking expensive.

2165
02:31:16,066 --> 02:31:17,827
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just ridiculous.

2166
02:31:17,867 --> 02:31:25,150
[SPEAKER_09]: For stuff that's just half the price for something better elsewhere, it's just such a markup for the brand.

2167
02:31:28,621 --> 02:31:33,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, maybe when they kind of take the JCPenney approach where they'll cut all their prices by 40%.

2168
02:31:33,663 --> 02:31:46,728
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, not to say that, I mean, Sony stuff's all right because I have a Sony camera, a Sony camcorder, a Sony sound system, a Sony TV, a Sony PlayStation 3, a Sony PSP.

2169
02:31:46,748 --> 02:31:49,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, most of that stuff was given to me for free.

2170
02:31:49,949 --> 02:31:53,050
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's not bad.

2171
02:31:53,450 --> 02:31:55,531
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just really fucking expensive.

2172
02:31:59,851 --> 02:32:26,826
[SPEAKER_08]: JV Mon in chat says four years ago Sony stock was worth double than what it is now after 2009 it's been pretty much downhill since well yeah I mean I don't know I guess maybe just from the limited perspective where I think of Sony I think of PlayStation I think four years ago they were a mess and maybe there was excitement about the PlayStation 3 and all that but you know there were some huge missteps there for a couple years then things got back on the right track and then they just you know they had the move happen they had the hack happen

2173
02:32:27,606 --> 02:32:51,402
[SPEAKER_09]: and you know it's like they just kind of keep getting kicked down so mmm they get knocked down but they get up again all right anyhow uh let's do another story Loki um so let's talk a little bit about sales from a company that's struggling so hard to overcome used game sales

2174
02:32:52,643 --> 02:32:54,125
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel so bad for these guys.

2175
02:32:54,245 --> 02:32:57,228
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, EA has got it so hard.

2176
02:32:57,868 --> 02:32:59,490
[SPEAKER_05]: So hard.

2177
02:33:00,691 --> 02:33:05,356
[SPEAKER_09]: FIFA 12 and Battlefield 3 only sold 10 million units.

2178
02:33:05,876 --> 02:33:07,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Only 10 million units!

2179
02:33:09,110 --> 02:33:10,211
[SPEAKER_09]: How do they manage?

2180
02:33:11,092 --> 02:33:15,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Madden, only 5 million units sold since August.

2181
02:33:18,378 --> 02:33:19,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Poor struggling company.

2182
02:33:19,879 --> 02:33:20,740
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel so bad.

2183
02:33:20,760 --> 02:33:21,701
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna go buy a new game.

2184
02:33:21,881 --> 02:33:23,423
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna buy all their games brand new.

2185
02:33:24,003 --> 02:33:24,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Tomorrow.

2186
02:33:24,684 --> 02:33:26,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Just gonna go right out and buy all of them.

2187
02:33:27,466 --> 02:33:29,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Just because I think they're doing such a swell job.

2188
02:33:30,087 --> 02:33:30,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Or not.

2189
02:33:31,667 --> 02:33:36,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Star Wars The Old Republic has sold 200 million copies.

2190
02:33:37,048 --> 02:33:38,788
[SPEAKER_09]: And they already have... No, no.

2191
02:33:39,208 --> 02:33:39,708
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, not 200.

2192
02:33:39,748 --> 02:33:40,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2193
02:33:40,449 --> 02:33:40,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Two million.

2194
02:33:40,929 --> 02:33:42,149
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, no way.

2195
02:33:43,189 --> 02:33:43,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

2196
02:33:44,229 --> 02:33:46,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Two million households.

2197
02:33:46,510 --> 02:33:52,631
[SPEAKER_09]: And 1.7 million are active each day on average per day.

2198
02:33:52,791 --> 02:33:53,451
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not bad.

2199
02:33:53,491 --> 02:34:07,598
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, for user base, you know, especially when they talk like, you know, EA came out with their origin numbers where they said they have like 7 million user or is like 7 million user accounts or something like that, which I'm sure a lot lesser that, you know, than that percentage is active.

2200
02:34:07,698 --> 02:34:10,019
[SPEAKER_09]: But 1.7 out of 2 million is not bad.

2201
02:34:10,179 --> 02:34:10,959
[SPEAKER_08]: To be fair.

2202
02:34:11,079 --> 02:34:11,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2203
02:34:11,640 --> 02:34:12,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow has what?

2204
02:34:12,960 --> 02:34:14,741
[SPEAKER_08]: 10 million active subscribers right now.

2205
02:34:14,781 --> 02:34:16,822
[SPEAKER_08]: And at their peak, they had about 12 million.

2206
02:34:17,322 --> 02:34:19,483
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how many copies of the game they've sold.

2207
02:34:19,603 --> 02:34:20,124
[SPEAKER_08]: I would guess.

2208
02:34:20,164 --> 02:34:20,824
[SPEAKER_05]: That's global.

2209
02:34:20,844 --> 02:34:21,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2210
02:34:21,444 --> 02:34:22,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it is global.

2211
02:34:22,825 --> 02:34:25,587
[SPEAKER_08]: 15 or 20 million, probably at some point.

2212
02:34:25,727 --> 02:34:29,749
[SPEAKER_09]: And I mean, everybody can't be on that game every day.

2213
02:34:29,789 --> 02:34:32,291
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, some people do have other things they gotta do.

2214
02:34:32,311 --> 02:34:37,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I am one of those people in the gap where I bought the game and I canceled after the first month.

2215
02:34:37,854 --> 02:34:39,955
[SPEAKER_08]: I just didn't really want to keep playing.

2216
02:34:41,916 --> 02:34:42,416
[SPEAKER_08]: It's alright.

2217
02:34:42,536 --> 02:34:46,157
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think the game needs some tweaks and needs some improvements.

2218
02:34:46,597 --> 02:34:46,957
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2219
02:34:47,638 --> 02:34:52,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Some things happen in WoW and I'm playing WoW a lot more.

2220
02:34:52,419 --> 02:35:00,640
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, of course, EA's had the benefit of some DLC sales.

2221
02:35:00,740 --> 02:35:02,841
[SPEAKER_09]: And they've done well with certain types of DLC.

2222
02:35:02,881 --> 02:35:07,302
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, in just three months...

2223
02:35:07,862 --> 02:35:16,546
[SPEAKER_09]: FIFA, FIFA 12's ultimate team, DLC, has generated $39 million in microtransactions.

2224
02:35:17,607 --> 02:35:21,289
[SPEAKER_09]: That's 69% more than it generated in the same period last year.

2225
02:35:21,609 --> 02:35:23,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Gee, I wonder why.

2226
02:35:24,730 --> 02:35:28,552
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, but when I heard EA gloating that statistic, I was like, that's insulting.

2227
02:35:29,232 --> 02:35:32,414
[SPEAKER_08]: That is insulting because you know where that money's coming from.

2228
02:35:33,979 --> 02:35:36,941
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like, I don't know.

2229
02:35:37,021 --> 02:35:46,066
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of feel like in order to justify it, EA needed to say, oh, this is subtracting all the, you know, we didn't count the money that, you know, we had to give back because, you know, it was stolen or whatever.

2230
02:35:46,547 --> 02:35:47,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it's just...

2231
02:35:48,570 --> 02:35:49,051
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2232
02:35:49,071 --> 02:35:50,712
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a really sore spot.

2233
02:35:50,932 --> 02:35:57,598
[SPEAKER_08]: I realize their need to gloat to appease the shareholders and all that stuff, but again, fucking stop denying that there's a problem.

2234
02:35:57,638 --> 02:35:58,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop it.

2235
02:35:58,379 --> 02:36:01,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Is EA giving back that money or is Microsoft giving back that money?

2236
02:36:01,362 --> 02:36:01,902
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a thing.

2237
02:36:02,483 --> 02:36:03,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's taking the hit on that?

2238
02:36:04,524 --> 02:36:04,985
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2239
02:36:06,146 --> 02:36:07,227
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all digital.

2240
02:36:07,347 --> 02:36:10,069
[SPEAKER_08]: I would imagine Microsoft takes back the money from EA.

2241
02:36:10,490 --> 02:36:11,330
[SPEAKER_08]: I imagine they have to.

2242
02:36:15,854 --> 02:36:36,820
[SPEAKER_09]: and then of course they're saying according to the Chief Financial Officer Eric Brown to put some rough numbers on this if we compare the total digital revenue from FIFA 11 Ultimate Team to what we expect from FIFA 12 Ultimate Team this fiscal year we're looking to see a 25% increase franchise to franchise

2243
02:36:38,220 --> 02:36:41,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I wonder where the 25% is coming from.

2244
02:36:41,705 --> 02:36:45,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Their overall packaged goods units sold is not increasing by 25%.

2245
02:36:49,194 --> 02:37:10,388
[SPEAKER_09]: and so we're expanding by a decent margin the microtransaction revenue per user of FIFA and then it's funny because you know like the people covering this it's like yeah we continue to receive complaints nearly every day of non-FIFA players having their accounts hacked to purchase Ultimate Team DLC

2246
02:37:14,013 --> 02:37:17,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, I still hear about it on Twitter and I hear about it, you know.

2247
02:37:17,316 --> 02:37:22,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Hacked on Xbox, you know, they're still writing down a bunch of... Oh yeah, I forgot about that website.

2248
02:37:22,921 --> 02:37:24,763
[SPEAKER_09]: I check it all the time because I'm on their Twitter feed.

2249
02:37:24,823 --> 02:37:28,807
[SPEAKER_09]: I check it and they've got 30 stories on there right now and a lot more that get posted.

2250
02:37:29,787 --> 02:37:33,651
[SPEAKER_09]: She's kind of running behind on posting all that because she's getting a lot of emails.

2251
02:37:34,031 --> 02:37:34,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

2252
02:37:35,152 --> 02:37:37,915
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's some that I saw that were so ridiculous that like,

2253
02:37:38,969 --> 02:37:48,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, you know, we were going to give you back your money, but we're not going to because you didn't put your full name on your account.

2254
02:37:49,358 --> 02:37:54,863
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be like if I didn't put Matthew, I put Matt on my account.

2255
02:37:55,223 --> 02:37:59,567
[SPEAKER_08]: That's bull because my legal name I don't have on my Xbox and I still got it.

2256
02:38:00,461 --> 02:38:02,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but see, they pulled that bullshit.

2257
02:38:02,744 --> 02:38:03,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Stupid.

2258
02:38:04,366 --> 02:38:10,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I guess I should be thankful that I didn't have quite the nightmare problem a lot of people are having, although it did take a month.

2259
02:38:11,495 --> 02:38:14,598
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the average time, 25 days is what I've been hearing.

2260
02:38:14,679 --> 02:38:15,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Ridiculous.

2261
02:38:15,540 --> 02:38:15,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway...

2262
02:38:16,901 --> 02:38:18,883
[SPEAKER_08]: One more ridiculous story for you guys.

2263
02:38:19,203 --> 02:38:28,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember last week we were talking about the whole Zynga, the rip-off artist where they were making their own Dream Heights was a complete knock-off of Tiny Tower?

2264
02:38:28,769 --> 02:38:32,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Zynga finally came out and made a statement on the whole thing.

2265
02:38:32,932 --> 02:38:34,353
[SPEAKER_08]: And it went along these lines.

2266
02:38:34,513 --> 02:38:40,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Mark Pincus, who's the head of Zynga, quote, you should be careful not to throw stones when you live in glass houses.

2267
02:38:41,236 --> 02:38:49,259
[SPEAKER_08]: When you pull the lens back, you saw that their tower game looks similar to five other tower games going all the way back to Sim Tower in the early 1990s.

2268
02:38:52,165 --> 02:38:53,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Bullshit.

2269
02:38:54,728 --> 02:38:55,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Bullshit.

2270
02:38:55,208 --> 02:38:56,810
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew they were going to make that comparison.

2271
02:38:57,711 --> 02:39:06,200
[SPEAKER_08]: The comparison of Tiny Tower to SimTower is a lazy, ignorant comparison that tells me you have never played SimTower in your life.

2272
02:39:06,861 --> 02:39:12,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Because SimTower was way... I mean, in a way, SimTower is a more complex...

2273
02:39:13,287 --> 02:39:14,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

2274
02:39:25,751 --> 02:39:29,895
[SPEAKER_08]: But there is not nearly the level of micromanaging that there is in SimTower.

2275
02:39:30,175 --> 02:39:31,676
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what those games have in common?

2276
02:39:31,716 --> 02:39:33,418
[SPEAKER_08]: They're both about skyscrapers.

2277
02:39:33,518 --> 02:39:34,038
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

2278
02:39:34,298 --> 02:39:35,379
[SPEAKER_08]: And they have tower in the name.

2279
02:39:35,900 --> 02:39:39,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you don't really manage the people in SimTower.

2280
02:39:39,503 --> 02:39:40,684
[SPEAKER_08]: You manage your tower.

2281
02:39:41,044 --> 02:39:45,488
[SPEAKER_08]: You manage the escalators, the elevators, what type of businesses you're putting in.

2282
02:39:45,928 --> 02:39:46,489
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just...

2283
02:39:46,949 --> 02:39:48,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Google didn't create the first search engine.

2284
02:39:48,970 --> 02:39:51,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Apple didn't create the first MP3 player or tablet.

2285
02:40:12,612 --> 02:40:14,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook didn't create the first social network.

2286
02:40:15,433 --> 02:40:19,114
[SPEAKER_08]: But these companies have evolved products and categories in revolutionary ways.

2287
02:40:19,874 --> 02:40:24,555
[SPEAKER_08]: They are all internet treasures because they all have specific and broad missions to change the world.

2288
02:40:25,096 --> 02:40:28,337
[SPEAKER_08]: If that wasn't blowing smoke up their employees' ass, I don't know what was.

2289
02:40:29,357 --> 02:40:31,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Because seriously, how is that the same?

2290
02:40:32,858 --> 02:40:33,638
[SPEAKER_08]: How is that the same?

2291
02:40:33,898 --> 02:40:34,298
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not.

2292
02:40:34,558 --> 02:40:36,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Google didn't create the first search engine.

2293
02:40:37,279 --> 02:40:40,521
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true, but they created the best search engine.

2294
02:40:41,362 --> 02:40:49,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so Tiny Tower didn't create the first tower game, but they created a really good one for iOS systems.

2295
02:40:49,447 --> 02:40:51,548
[SPEAKER_08]: And you fucking jacked it all and made new art.

2296
02:40:51,668 --> 02:40:52,128
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

2297
02:40:52,329 --> 02:40:56,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Google didn't copy the code for Yahoo and change the name to Google on it.

2298
02:40:57,603 --> 02:41:05,214
[SPEAKER_05]: And Google actually has, it's like their whole search process is done by all kinds of different calculations too.

2299
02:41:05,715 --> 02:41:07,097
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's really complex.

2300
02:41:09,621 --> 02:41:13,046
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they've taken Google and made a full spectrum product out of it.

2301
02:41:13,530 --> 02:41:14,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

2302
02:41:36,295 --> 02:41:49,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Circle Space Circle Breakman in our chatroom says Zynga is currently making a podcast called Red Lounge Radio It will be on the More Than All Games Network He actually fooled somebody in chat Really?

2303
02:41:51,748 --> 02:41:56,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Frisbee says, Dear everyone who plays Zynga games, please stop being a person that plays Zynga games.

2304
02:41:56,790 --> 02:41:57,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Love humans everywhere.

2305
02:41:58,291 --> 02:42:00,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Jvmon brings out the harsh reality.

2306
02:42:00,792 --> 02:42:06,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Chat.orange.com saying, Zynga's stock doubled after the Facebook IPO this week.

2307
02:42:06,694 --> 02:42:10,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, when you see how really dependent they were on each other, as if you didn't already know.

2308
02:42:10,336 --> 02:42:15,157
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Facebook in their filing basically had to say a lot more about the internal workings of their company.

2309
02:42:15,498 --> 02:42:18,799
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of those things is that they kind of fucking rely on Zynga.

2310
02:42:19,079 --> 02:42:22,680
[SPEAKER_08]: for people to return visit to Facebook, just like Zynga fucking relies on Facebook.

2311
02:42:22,980 --> 02:42:25,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Because didn't Zynga try to make their own portal?

2312
02:42:26,361 --> 02:42:31,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember there was a time where Zynga was like, well, we don't really... Remember when Google Plus was going to murder everything?

2313
02:42:31,962 --> 02:42:34,823
[SPEAKER_08]: And Zynga was like, well, we don't really need Facebook.

2314
02:42:34,963 --> 02:42:41,125
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to get everybody to come to our Zynga game, Zynga book, or whatever they were going to do.

2315
02:42:41,705 --> 02:42:43,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I can see them doing that shit.

2316
02:42:44,689 --> 02:42:46,492
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll make our own social network.

2317
02:42:46,512 --> 02:42:47,093
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

2318
02:42:47,193 --> 02:42:52,240
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just gonna copy-paste Facebook, and we're gonna call it Portrait...

2319
02:42:54,019 --> 02:42:55,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, one final note on this whole story.

2320
02:42:56,020 --> 02:42:59,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Nimblebit, who made Tiny Tower, did not let this all go by unscathed.

2321
02:43:00,662 --> 02:43:13,288
[SPEAKER_08]: The co-founder, Ian Marsh, talked to Touch Arcade and said, quote, It was a smart idea for Mark Pincus and Zynga to try and lump all games with the name Tower together as an actual genre whose games borrow from each other.

2322
02:43:13,928 --> 02:43:17,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Sharing a name or a setting does not a genre make.

2323
02:43:19,651 --> 02:43:19,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Agreed.

2324
02:43:21,550 --> 02:43:28,353
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, 13 Ghosts may be about a haunted house, but it's not the same kind of movie as High Spirits, for example.

2325
02:43:30,629 --> 02:43:33,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, is that like saying the movie Independence Day isn't really about the 4th of July?

2326
02:44:04,791 --> 02:44:28,219
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio The Skype line is open now Give us a call if you want to talk about anything we've talked about tonight Or maybe there's something we missed that you wanted to bring up Or, hell, I don't know Just call us if you want to say hello We do have a reduced amount of live listeners tonight Because of, you know, football games and so forth But I do see there are some of you listening There in our chat room The few, the loyal

2327
02:44:29,059 --> 02:44:30,160
[SPEAKER_08]: at chat.orangelounge.com.

2328
02:44:30,180 --> 02:44:30,880
[SPEAKER_08]: So go ahead and call us.

2329
02:44:30,900 --> 02:44:35,182
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2330
02:44:35,863 --> 02:44:36,183
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2331
02:44:37,143 --> 02:44:38,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Meanwhile, we're going to do some tweets.

2332
02:44:38,964 --> 02:44:39,244
[SPEAKER_08]: And what?

2333
02:44:39,264 --> 02:44:40,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have something, Loki, you want to add?

2334
02:44:40,325 --> 02:44:40,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Just real quick.

2335
02:44:40,885 --> 02:44:41,826
[SPEAKER_09]: I just thought this was funny.

2336
02:44:42,186 --> 02:44:52,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, there's a PlayStation Network update that just happened that has blocked users from accessing their paid content in the PAL territories.

2337
02:44:53,799 --> 02:44:54,019
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

2338
02:44:54,820 --> 02:45:10,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, it's those who have done the update are getting an error labeled as 800-231-02, which helpfully informs them that no content was found when the user tries to download or re-download PlayStation Network content they've already purchased.

2339
02:45:14,053 --> 02:45:17,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

2340
02:45:18,114 --> 02:45:22,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a lot of activities on Twitter either, although there were some nice tweets.

2341
02:45:22,156 --> 02:45:23,996
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll read some of these nice tweets that are there.

2342
02:45:24,656 --> 02:45:26,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Breakman says, I might show up later for OLR.

2343
02:45:27,097 --> 02:45:29,198
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be pretty drunk though, so good luck to them.

2344
02:45:30,179 --> 02:45:36,121
[SPEAKER_08]: And CurlyKTK on Twitter says, putting the Super Bowl on mute to listen to OLR.

2345
02:45:36,701 --> 02:45:37,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job.

2346
02:45:37,661 --> 02:45:38,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job.

2347
02:45:38,682 --> 02:45:40,742
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we do have some calls coming in, so let's go to the phones.

2348
02:45:40,782 --> 02:45:41,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2349
02:45:41,763 --> 02:45:42,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

2350
02:45:43,086 --> 02:45:47,468
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it's the guy who's normally CD Thunder in chat, but tonight I'm God of Thunder.

2351
02:45:47,508 --> 02:45:48,209
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you all doing?

2352
02:45:48,529 --> 02:45:48,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.

2353
02:45:48,829 --> 02:45:49,669
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you, God of Thunder?

2354
02:45:51,110 --> 02:45:51,731
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too bad.

2355
02:45:51,771 --> 02:45:53,912
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple quick things I'd like to talk about.

2356
02:45:54,992 --> 02:45:55,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, what do you want to talk about?

2357
02:45:57,333 --> 02:45:59,615
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, quickly, I'd like to talk about Darkness 2.

2358
02:46:00,715 --> 02:46:01,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Darkness 2.

2359
02:46:02,696 --> 02:46:04,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this the one that's coming out, or is this the one that was out?

2360
02:46:04,877 --> 02:46:07,119
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the one that's coming out on Tuesday.

2361
02:46:07,339 --> 02:46:09,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, what do you want to talk about Darkness 2?

2362
02:46:11,021 --> 02:46:39,338
[SPEAKER_00]: well from what I've seen in the demo this game looks completely over the top and gory and sick and it just looks really awesome I wish I could actually play it but that's a man who thinks like this the game looks over the top and gory and disgusting and I love it that's like how I felt after I played the Bayonetta demo oh so are you going to pre-order your copy of Darkness 2?

2363
02:46:41,249 --> 02:46:47,615
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as I said before, I don't actually have the system to play it on, but if I did, I would.

2364
02:46:47,855 --> 02:46:48,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know what you have to do?

2365
02:46:48,676 --> 02:46:49,696
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to have to steal one.

2366
02:46:50,397 --> 02:46:51,578
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just kidding.

2367
02:46:51,638 --> 02:46:52,099
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't steal.

2368
02:46:52,579 --> 02:46:53,140
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.

2369
02:46:53,620 --> 02:46:53,880
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2370
02:46:56,703 --> 02:47:00,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, maybe, do you have a friend who might buy it?

2371
02:47:00,666 --> 02:47:03,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes we have a rich friend who has all that stuff.

2372
02:47:03,809 --> 02:47:08,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Growing up, I didn't get a Super Nintendo when they first came out, but my rich friend did, so I'd go over to his house.

2373
02:47:09,571 --> 02:47:13,614
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know if anybody that I know would get it or not.

2374
02:47:13,694 --> 02:47:14,595
[SPEAKER_00]: I just really don't know.

2375
02:47:15,095 --> 02:47:15,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, all right.

2376
02:47:15,835 --> 02:47:16,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's all right.

2377
02:47:17,216 --> 02:47:38,862
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing I'd like to talk about quickly is I was talking to a friend of mine today and apparently can actually get a classic Nintendo Entertainment System controller USB and plug it into your USB port in a computer and use that to play Nintendo Entertainment System games on the website I linked to the chat room a few minutes earlier.

2378
02:47:39,002 --> 02:47:39,982
[SPEAKER_08]: What was the website?

2379
02:47:40,002 --> 02:47:41,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you sent us the email.

2380
02:47:41,063 --> 02:47:42,243
[SPEAKER_08]: You're the same guy who sent us the email.

2381
02:47:42,263 --> 02:47:43,083
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't get the website.

2382
02:47:43,123 --> 02:47:43,543
[SPEAKER_08]: What is it?

2383
02:47:43,823 --> 02:47:46,024
[SPEAKER_00]: It's retrouprising.com

2384
02:47:46,644 --> 02:47:48,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, is this going to install porn bots on my computer?

2385
02:47:49,145 --> 02:47:54,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you know how some of these emulation sites are just, they carry porn bots.

2386
02:47:54,667 --> 02:47:58,808
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, one minute I'm playing Super Mario Brothers and the next minute, Vagina!

2387
02:48:00,149 --> 02:48:02,350
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I've tested out some of this stuff.

2388
02:48:02,490 --> 02:48:02,930
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it works.

2389
02:48:02,970 --> 02:48:03,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Extensively?

2390
02:48:05,431 --> 02:48:05,631
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

2391
02:48:05,851 --> 02:48:06,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2392
02:48:06,511 --> 02:48:07,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Just checking.

2393
02:48:08,292 --> 02:48:13,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what retro games have you rediscovered through the websites?

2394
02:48:14,844 --> 02:48:19,607
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they have stuff like Ice Climber, Donkey Kong, stuff like that.

2395
02:48:19,687 --> 02:48:24,811
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the Super Nintendo games, you actually have to have an emulator, I believe.

2396
02:48:25,572 --> 02:48:26,913
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, unfortunately, I do not have.

2397
02:48:30,815 --> 02:48:33,757
[SPEAKER_08]: But you have the internet one, right?

2398
02:48:33,797 --> 02:48:34,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Through the website?

2399
02:48:36,584 --> 02:48:48,348
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm able to do the Sega Genesis and the Nintendo Entertainment System games, but for some reason it says it has a bar that shows the emulator is loading, then they get a black screen.

2400
02:48:49,208 --> 02:48:52,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe update Java or try a different browser?

2401
02:48:53,290 --> 02:48:53,670
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2402
02:48:53,790 --> 02:48:54,510
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I would do.

2403
02:48:55,651 --> 02:48:58,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Or it's installing Vagina all over your computer.

2404
02:48:58,492 --> 02:48:59,652
[SPEAKER_08]: That could be what's happening.

2405
02:48:59,712 --> 02:49:02,973
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying, you've got to be very careful about some of these websites.

2406
02:49:02,993 --> 02:49:04,394
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got an infestation of Vagina.

2407
02:49:04,474 --> 02:49:04,954
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

2408
02:49:06,294 --> 02:49:12,000
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'll probably get the NES controller and use that to play some of those NES games, which are pretty awesome.

2409
02:49:12,420 --> 02:49:14,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you going to get one of those NES controllers that's like just a USB?

2410
02:49:15,763 --> 02:49:15,963
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

2411
02:49:16,424 --> 02:49:16,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotcha.

2412
02:49:17,765 --> 02:49:18,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, very cool.

2413
02:49:19,166 --> 02:49:21,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well, any other thoughts before we let you go?

2414
02:49:23,769 --> 02:49:29,031
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm, well, I hope you guys continue doing what you're doing for quite a while.

2415
02:49:29,531 --> 02:49:40,055
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys keep all of us entertaining, me included, and just history of good health and so forth and so on, et cetera, et cetera.

2416
02:49:40,315 --> 02:49:41,015
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it.

2417
02:49:41,075 --> 02:49:42,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we appreciate it.

2418
02:49:42,916 --> 02:49:46,597
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind comments like that that keep us going because, you know, we don't make any money off this show.

2419
02:49:46,638 --> 02:49:47,838
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I have to have rich friends.

2420
02:49:49,318 --> 02:49:50,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, have a good one.

2421
02:49:50,960 --> 02:49:51,460
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you too.

2422
02:49:51,600 --> 02:49:51,881
[SPEAKER_00]: Later.

2423
02:49:52,021 --> 02:49:52,241
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.

2424
02:49:52,501 --> 02:49:52,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

2425
02:50:04,400 --> 02:50:06,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Meanwhile, more Twitter topics.

2426
02:50:06,562 --> 02:50:11,107
[SPEAKER_08]: TigerClaw, always sending us a few stories that we may have overlooked.

2427
02:50:12,268 --> 02:50:13,949
[SPEAKER_08]: TigerClaw on Twitter tweets us this.

2428
02:50:14,510 --> 02:50:19,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Apple removes several iOS copycat games from one offending developer.

2429
02:50:19,475 --> 02:50:20,295
[SPEAKER_08]: So finally...

2430
02:50:21,236 --> 02:50:30,259
[SPEAKER_08]: This is funny that all the stuff we were talking about last week about the whole copycat crap is starting to kind of come to light and Apple's taking action against some of it.

2431
02:50:30,699 --> 02:50:31,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

2432
02:50:32,580 --> 02:50:35,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, I'm reading this story for the first time because TigerClock sent it to us.

2433
02:50:35,101 --> 02:50:36,081
[SPEAKER_08]: It's from Gamasutra.

2434
02:50:36,721 --> 02:50:43,963
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, Apple struck a blow against video game clones today by removing several offending apps from one rather prolific independent developer.

2435
02:50:44,524 --> 02:50:47,725
[SPEAKER_08]: The games were Plant vs. Zombie.

2436
02:50:47,745 --> 02:50:47,825
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

2437
02:50:49,465 --> 02:51:06,933
[SPEAKER_08]: as in the one plant against one zombie, Angry Ninja Birds, and Temple Jump, which is a knockoff of a game called Temple Run, which is funny because Temple Jump actually was having some success on the App Store, and yeah, we actually got all the way to the top of the paid app chart.

2438
02:51:07,713 --> 02:51:14,316
[SPEAKER_08]: The independent developer of the game is Anton Sinekov, and according to a Twitter post from another iOS developer,

2439
02:51:14,736 --> 02:51:21,619
[SPEAKER_08]: This developer had 68 iOS apps available this morning and now only 9 remain.

2440
02:51:22,879 --> 02:51:23,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

2441
02:51:24,700 --> 02:51:25,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

2442
02:51:25,941 --> 02:51:36,705
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the developers who was copied in this case, Imanji, says we were really happy with how quickly Apple responded to the situation and removed Temple Jump.

2443
02:51:37,185 --> 02:51:43,728
[SPEAKER_08]: The app was clearly a scam that traded entirely on the popularity of Temple Run and was packaged to confuse users.

2444
02:51:45,680 --> 02:51:46,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Booyah.

2445
02:51:47,422 --> 02:51:48,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Mulkart's gone now, right?

2446
02:51:49,523 --> 02:51:52,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, my question is, when are they going to start taking down the Zynga games?

2447
02:51:52,906 --> 02:51:53,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably never.

2448
02:51:53,947 --> 02:51:56,029
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, we're getting another call, so let's go to the phones.

2449
02:51:56,429 --> 02:51:57,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2450
02:51:57,570 --> 02:51:57,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

2451
02:52:00,213 --> 02:52:00,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Tesla.

2452
02:52:01,674 --> 02:52:02,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Log in and play.

2453
02:52:05,618 --> 02:52:10,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you calling to harass me to get me to come play WoW when I'm trying to do a show on the internets?

2454
02:52:13,784 --> 02:52:15,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Who told you how to find my show?

2455
02:52:18,148 --> 02:52:19,409
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even have to ask.

2456
02:52:21,531 --> 02:52:23,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me ask you some questions.

2457
02:52:23,052 --> 02:52:25,054
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, introduce yourself to the listeners.

2458
02:52:25,334 --> 02:52:26,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Who am I speaking with?

2459
02:52:28,157 --> 02:52:31,720
[SPEAKER_02]: For all four of you out there who are listening, this is Melodule.

2460
02:52:32,841 --> 02:52:37,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I play with your gracious host on a game called World of Warcraft.

2461
02:52:37,532 --> 02:52:38,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, I need a port I need all those things and a port

2462
02:53:03,146 --> 02:53:05,848
[SPEAKER_08]: He needs a port, so I have to sign in.

2463
02:53:05,908 --> 02:53:07,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to my life.

2464
02:53:07,529 --> 02:53:09,050
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, because this is the funny thing.

2465
02:53:09,270 --> 02:53:14,172
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura plays an arcane mage on Alliance side, and now I have this arcane mage on Horde.

2466
02:53:14,493 --> 02:53:15,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Port, please.

2467
02:53:15,313 --> 02:53:15,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Port, please.

2468
02:53:16,754 --> 02:53:17,014
[SPEAKER_05]: 5G.

2469
02:53:17,474 --> 02:53:21,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'll do that since that's like, what, 500% inflation?

2470
02:53:22,237 --> 02:53:25,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I've learned after your story earlier this evening, I'll never get paid for it.

2471
02:53:25,598 --> 02:53:28,820
[SPEAKER_08]: People will just swindle me like you did that poor death knight.

2472
02:53:29,040 --> 02:53:30,981
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you make them pay you, and then you open the portal.

2473
02:53:31,282 --> 02:53:31,582
[SPEAKER_08]: I see.

2474
02:53:33,423 --> 02:53:37,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly Well look, Meloduel, do you play any other video games besides WoW?

2475
02:53:39,847 --> 02:53:57,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I, oh wait, I gotta turn myself down here because I didn't hear myself talking Yeah, it's always a little awkward, especially when there's a huge delay Right, even though I do sound pretty good on the radio Maybe I should have my own radio show Me too, me too, that's why I've been doing this so long is I sound great on the radio I'm just like listening to himself talk I do, I do

2476
02:53:58,453 --> 02:54:09,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hey, at the risk of completely losing all of my sex life by admitting these things, I will admit to playing a little Final Fantasy here and there.

2477
02:54:10,347 --> 02:54:11,168
[SPEAKER_02]: What else do I play?

2478
02:54:11,289 --> 02:54:13,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a huge, huge EverQuest.

2479
02:54:13,803 --> 02:54:13,943
[SPEAKER_02]: R.I.P.

2480
02:54:13,963 --> 02:54:15,544
[SPEAKER_02]: EverQuest, R.I.P.

2481
02:54:15,584 --> 02:54:17,505
[SPEAKER_08]: There actually was a Final Fuck X in Japan.

2482
02:54:44,431 --> 02:54:44,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.

2483
02:54:45,251 --> 02:54:46,052
[SPEAKER_06]: I have this.

2484
02:54:46,592 --> 02:54:48,553
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically just bad cosplay boinging.

2485
02:54:48,593 --> 02:54:52,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's basically just chicks dressed up as the characters in Final Fantasy X and they get fucked.

2486
02:54:52,675 --> 02:54:56,877
[SPEAKER_08]: But this weird thing about Japanese porn is that they have to blur the penetration.

2487
02:54:58,537 --> 02:54:59,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

2488
02:55:00,238 --> 02:55:01,539
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the guys aren't dressed up.

2489
02:55:01,639 --> 02:55:03,660
[SPEAKER_08]: The guys are just like, hey, I'm here to fuck Yuna.

2490
02:55:03,820 --> 02:55:04,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2491
02:55:05,341 --> 02:55:10,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, see, you've got to be careful because if you don't blur it, you could have an infestation of a vagina.

2492
02:55:11,124 --> 02:55:11,784
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

2493
02:55:11,904 --> 02:55:12,244
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

2494
02:55:12,264 --> 02:55:13,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like the last caller.

2495
02:55:13,305 --> 02:55:16,205
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're on a bad website, you just, you know, knock, knock.

2496
02:55:16,225 --> 02:55:16,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's there?

2497
02:55:17,046 --> 02:55:18,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Too much vagina is never a good thing.

2498
02:55:19,546 --> 02:55:20,567
[SPEAKER_08]: You want it in moderation.

2499
02:55:20,687 --> 02:55:21,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Never.

2500
02:55:22,187 --> 02:55:22,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Never.

2501
02:55:22,767 --> 02:55:23,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Never.

2502
02:55:23,688 --> 02:55:24,248
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

2503
02:55:25,348 --> 02:55:26,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.

2504
02:55:26,088 --> 02:55:28,529
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's those are the games that I played for a while.

2505
02:55:29,102 --> 02:55:29,882
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved Tactics.

2506
02:55:29,922 --> 02:55:31,883
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my big thing.

2507
02:55:31,963 --> 02:55:34,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy Tactics was a great game.

2508
02:55:34,623 --> 02:55:36,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy Tactics was awesome.

2509
02:55:36,804 --> 02:55:40,725
[SPEAKER_08]: They have the versions on what systems?

2510
02:55:41,245 --> 02:55:43,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Game Boy Advance had one and then they ported it.

2511
02:55:44,586 --> 02:55:47,966
[SPEAKER_08]: There's another one on... It escapes me.

2512
02:55:47,986 --> 02:55:48,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't they make another port?

2513
02:55:49,127 --> 02:55:49,787
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a PSP.

2514
02:55:49,907 --> 02:55:52,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there was a PSP.

2515
02:55:54,388 --> 02:55:55,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was the only one.

2516
02:55:55,728 --> 02:55:55,948
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved...

2517
02:55:58,956 --> 02:56:05,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy 2, the US version where it was like Final Fantasy 3 or something in Japan.

2518
02:56:05,497 --> 02:56:06,197
[SPEAKER_02]: They couldn't get it right.

2519
02:56:06,217 --> 02:56:06,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2520
02:56:07,678 --> 02:56:09,198
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.

2521
02:56:09,218 --> 02:56:09,558
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

2522
02:56:09,678 --> 02:56:13,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I will stop harassing you and let you get to your radio show.

2523
02:56:13,699 --> 02:56:13,979
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2524
02:56:14,279 --> 02:56:14,899
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate it.

2525
02:56:15,319 --> 02:56:17,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally cut it short because I need a port.

2526
02:56:18,080 --> 02:56:18,400
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2527
02:56:19,200 --> 02:56:23,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you might have to buy one unless you want to wait until about 11 o'clock my time when I'll finally sign in.

2528
02:56:25,271 --> 02:56:26,051
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2529
02:56:26,752 --> 02:56:27,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good one.

2530
02:56:27,693 --> 02:56:27,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

2531
02:56:27,793 --> 02:56:32,018
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm really sorry that now you're not going to get laid for like six weeks because you admitted things on air.

2532
02:56:34,933 --> 02:56:37,654
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll talk to you later.

2533
02:56:37,774 --> 02:56:37,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

2534
02:56:37,934 --> 02:56:40,895
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Use the name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio.

2535
02:56:41,235 --> 02:56:44,156
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very amusing.

2536
02:56:44,296 --> 02:56:44,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't let it fool you.

2537
02:56:44,976 --> 02:56:45,896
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a total asshole.

2538
02:56:45,976 --> 02:56:46,536
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm kidding.

2539
02:56:46,576 --> 02:56:46,916
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kidding.

2540
02:56:46,956 --> 02:56:47,437
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kidding.

2541
02:56:47,597 --> 02:56:51,938
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I've actually been... I like everybody in that guild so far.

2542
02:56:52,718 --> 02:56:54,118
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been pretty nice people.

2543
02:56:54,379 --> 02:56:55,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Except for that Shane guy.

2544
02:56:56,299 --> 02:56:56,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he's an ass.

2545
02:56:58,380 --> 02:56:58,980
But the first...

2546
02:56:59,600 --> 02:57:05,044
[SPEAKER_08]: The first, like I joined that guild because I knew that they were doing some raiding and that they were just starting.

2547
02:57:05,064 --> 02:57:07,586
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, all right, well, you know, because nothing's happening on Alliance.

2548
02:57:07,626 --> 02:57:07,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

2549
02:57:07,886 --> 02:57:09,487
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to try this to work out my horde.

2550
02:57:09,987 --> 02:57:15,792
[SPEAKER_08]: The first night I went on the raid with the group, I was like, this might be a bit of a hot mess.

2551
02:57:16,032 --> 02:57:16,492
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2552
02:57:17,293 --> 02:57:22,116
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, the next week, actually, we raided again last and it was really good.

2553
02:57:22,316 --> 02:57:25,598
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think like, you know, they made some tweaks to the group and it really worked.

2554
02:57:25,699 --> 02:57:27,280
[SPEAKER_08]: And we cleared like five bosses in one night.

2555
02:57:27,320 --> 02:57:27,880
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a good time.

2556
02:57:28,400 --> 02:57:29,001
[SPEAKER_08]: On Firelands?

2557
02:57:29,321 --> 02:57:30,061
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2558
02:57:50,051 --> 02:57:52,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I want that on my mage because I have the tier 12 bonus.

2559
02:57:52,153 --> 02:57:53,534
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, sorry.

2560
02:57:53,554 --> 02:57:58,038
[SPEAKER_08]: This discussion is getting a little too Horde House, which by the way is the other Warcraft show I do sometimes.

2561
02:57:58,118 --> 02:57:59,079
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to be on soon.

2562
02:57:59,319 --> 02:58:01,221
[SPEAKER_08]: www.hordehouse.com I'm going to be honest.

2563
02:58:01,261 --> 02:58:02,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's have some real talk for a minute.

2564
02:58:02,622 --> 02:58:04,303
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know when there's going to be another episode of Horde House.

2565
02:58:04,724 --> 02:58:07,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Because like, Extifer is now like busy on the weekends all the time.

2566
02:58:07,947 --> 02:58:09,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I don't...

2567
02:58:09,788 --> 02:58:14,950
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I should say this, but he's seeing... He's got an infestation of vaginas.

2568
02:58:15,870 --> 02:58:20,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, he has an infestation of a vagina all week.

2569
02:58:20,752 --> 02:58:23,953
[SPEAKER_08]: No, he's seeing a boy, and I met the boy the other night, and he's really cool.

2570
02:58:24,013 --> 02:58:28,375
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't want to, you know... So, you know, I don't know what's going to happen.

2571
02:58:28,415 --> 02:58:31,276
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's going to be really hard for us to kind of like coordinate our schedules and so forth.

2572
02:58:31,356 --> 02:58:32,476
[SPEAKER_08]: And plus, he's not playing WoW.

2573
02:58:33,176 --> 02:58:33,376
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

2574
02:58:35,942 --> 02:58:38,745
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have to get guests that can fill in the gaps and so forth.

2575
02:58:38,786 --> 02:58:41,429
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be more than happy to fill in if you want to record soon.

2576
02:58:41,449 --> 02:58:42,230
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I know.

2577
02:58:42,470 --> 02:58:48,217
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll work something out, but it's just don't expect Horde House every week, sadly, until we get some of this stuff worked out.

2578
02:58:49,178 --> 02:58:52,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially like a common date and time and all that.

2579
02:58:53,223 --> 02:58:53,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2580
02:58:54,384 --> 02:58:57,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Tiger Claw in chat says, I bet Rob is strict and mean in the guild.

2581
02:58:57,426 --> 02:59:00,127
[SPEAKER_08]: When someone underperforms, he'll yell at them like a drill sergeant.

2582
02:59:01,488 --> 02:59:02,008
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't yell.

2583
02:59:02,049 --> 02:59:02,589
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.

2584
02:59:04,410 --> 02:59:06,591
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you doing going to that side?

2585
02:59:06,631 --> 02:59:07,632
[SPEAKER_04]: We said this one.

2586
02:59:07,672 --> 02:59:08,492
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's not Rob.

2587
02:59:08,692 --> 02:59:10,273
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't really do that.

2588
02:59:10,814 --> 02:59:14,055
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to think I'm fair and I'm nice and I'm patient.

2589
02:59:14,696 --> 02:59:15,977
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very fucking patient.

2590
02:59:16,617 --> 02:59:20,099
[SPEAKER_08]: But I get to these moments where I fucking snap.

2591
02:59:21,760 --> 02:59:22,860
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what Rob sounds like.

2592
02:59:23,760 --> 02:59:28,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to do the, what was the boss in Blackrock?

2593
02:59:29,783 --> 02:59:30,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Nefarian?

2594
02:59:30,383 --> 02:59:30,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Nefarian.

2595
02:59:31,263 --> 02:59:32,304
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Rob on Nefarian.

2596
02:59:32,584 --> 02:59:33,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, get to the platform.

2597
02:59:34,065 --> 02:59:35,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, don't forget to interrupt.

2598
02:59:36,025 --> 02:59:37,406
[SPEAKER_05]: You interrupt, you interrupt, you interrupt.

2599
02:59:38,526 --> 02:59:39,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, are you healing?

2600
02:59:40,127 --> 02:59:40,587
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened?

2601
02:59:40,607 --> 02:59:41,427
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened to your mana?

2602
02:59:41,788 --> 02:59:42,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you healing?

2603
02:59:44,096 --> 02:59:44,597
[SPEAKER_05]: What was that?

2604
02:59:44,878 --> 02:59:45,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Why did we wipe?

2605
02:59:45,941 --> 02:59:47,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I think we wiped because this, this, this, and this.

2606
02:59:48,347 --> 02:59:49,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's try it again.

2607
02:59:49,771 --> 02:59:50,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Get to the platform!

2608
02:59:52,478 --> 02:59:52,839
[SPEAKER_05]: That's wrong.

2609
02:59:54,127 --> 02:59:54,968
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit, a little bit.

2610
02:59:55,868 --> 02:59:56,189
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2611
02:59:57,830 --> 02:59:58,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

2612
02:59:58,390 --> 03:00:00,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Another story here from the Twitter.

2613
03:00:00,292 --> 03:00:02,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

2614
03:00:02,734 --> 03:00:05,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Tigerclaw sends us this link.

2615
03:00:06,056 --> 03:00:09,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo Zone to feature full episodes of Pokemon.

2616
03:00:10,019 --> 03:00:10,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

2617
03:00:11,820 --> 03:00:16,664
[SPEAKER_08]: 3DS owners get free Wi-Fi access at 29,000 Nintendo Zone locations.

2618
03:00:16,964 --> 03:00:18,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's that new channel on my 3DS.

2619
03:00:18,766 --> 03:00:20,087
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't figure out what it's used for.

2620
03:00:20,107 --> 03:00:20,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2621
03:00:22,128 --> 03:00:25,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo Zone will offer much more content for 3DS owners.

2622
03:00:25,949 --> 03:00:31,431
[SPEAKER_08]: There will be a dedicated Pokemon section that will feature full length episodes of the Pokemon TV series.

2623
03:00:32,251 --> 03:00:35,712
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, McDonald's or Starbucks are both Nintendo Zone partners.

2624
03:00:36,032 --> 03:00:39,393
[SPEAKER_08]: That's actually kind of cool, especially if I can get like old school Pokemon episodes.

2625
03:00:39,693 --> 03:00:41,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Like remember when I had all those Pokemon DVDs?

2626
03:00:41,694 --> 03:00:43,134
[SPEAKER_08]: I still do have some of them up there.

2627
03:00:43,294 --> 03:00:43,594
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

2628
03:00:44,355 --> 03:00:45,155
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I have, Rob?

2629
03:00:45,515 --> 03:00:45,675
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

2630
03:00:46,435 --> 03:00:49,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Japanese Digimon DVDs.

2631
03:00:52,097 --> 03:00:55,138
[SPEAKER_05]: For the record, OLR has a one in three occurrence of vagina.

2632
03:00:56,479 --> 03:00:56,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah.

2633
03:00:58,399 --> 03:00:58,720
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2634
03:00:59,520 --> 03:01:02,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, our Skype line, unfortunately, isn't ringing anymore.

2635
03:01:02,041 --> 03:01:05,162
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess... They've come down with the vagina.

2636
03:01:05,342 --> 03:01:10,044
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess people just wanted to call and yell at me or talk about old games.

2637
03:01:10,324 --> 03:01:11,044
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's all right.

2638
03:01:11,304 --> 03:01:12,685
[SPEAKER_08]: They've come down with the cases.

2639
03:01:12,765 --> 03:01:14,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Our usual callers are at their Super Bowl parties.

2640
03:01:14,806 --> 03:01:15,206
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine.

2641
03:01:15,226 --> 03:01:15,786
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand.

2642
03:01:16,026 --> 03:01:17,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Loki, join the chat room.

2643
03:01:19,750 --> 03:01:22,732
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the artist behind Every Little Step, Bobby Blackpool.

2644
03:01:23,153 --> 03:01:24,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of the stupor bowl.

2645
03:01:25,855 --> 03:01:26,135
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2646
03:01:26,735 --> 03:01:28,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, it's super bowels.

2647
03:01:28,136 --> 03:01:29,037
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to wrap it up.

2648
03:01:29,257 --> 03:01:30,078
[SPEAKER_08]: We're getting out of here.

2649
03:01:30,218 --> 03:01:34,621
[SPEAKER_08]: But before we get out of here for the night, last minute stories.

2650
03:01:34,941 --> 03:01:36,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, do you have anything you want to share for last minute stories?

2651
03:01:37,743 --> 03:01:39,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Just one small thing.

2652
03:01:39,264 --> 03:01:42,605
[SPEAKER_09]: I noticed that Joystick had posted a little thing about this game.

2653
03:01:43,226 --> 03:01:44,586
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a free indie game.

2654
03:01:46,287 --> 03:01:50,009
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a really oddly named game called The Cat That Got Milk.

2655
03:01:51,089 --> 03:01:52,209
[SPEAKER_09]: The Cat That Got The Milk.

2656
03:01:53,630 --> 03:01:57,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Not necessarily what it sounds like, but it's a free game.

2657
03:01:57,992 --> 03:01:58,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Go check it out.

2658
03:02:00,273 --> 03:02:09,718
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty short, only 10-15 minutes, but it's thecatthatgothemilk.com and it looks pretty awesome based on the trailer.

2659
03:02:13,482 --> 03:02:14,743
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is Jigglypuff.

2660
03:02:44,249 --> 03:02:46,610
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to do it, guys, for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

2661
03:02:46,650 --> 03:02:51,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys so much for downloading and listening to our show, even if it was just to yell at me that you needed a port somewhere.

2662
03:02:53,292 --> 03:02:54,893
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to do this all again next week.

2663
03:02:55,013 --> 03:02:55,893
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what we ask.

2664
03:02:55,933 --> 03:03:02,495
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've enjoyed what you hear here at Orange Launch Radio, remember we don't have a big magazine backing us with millions of dollars.

2665
03:03:02,575 --> 03:03:03,876
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have all these ads and stuff.

2666
03:03:04,176 --> 03:03:30,167
[SPEAKER_08]: you know all we ask tell a friend about the show help spread the word of Orange Lounge Radio and we'll come back to do it all again next week so next week I'm hoping to talk a little more in depth about Soul Calibur 5 after I get some more hands on time with it I don't know what my co-hosts will be playing hands on maybe get some time in with Evita if I know anyone that gets one early we'll see I'll have to go find my rich friends but until then that's going to do it myself DarkSakura and Loki saying goodnight

2667
03:03:31,454 --> 03:03:31,934
[SPEAKER_10]: See you next week!
