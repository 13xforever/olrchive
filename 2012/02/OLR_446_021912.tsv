0	19600	Tonight, February 19th, 2012, Capcom makes the same mistake twice.
19600	24480	Sony plans a movie for one of its franchises, and one company is rumored to be working on
24480	31680	a new Ninja Turtles game.
31680	35240	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
35240	39660	where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
39660	47440	We are live on this February 19th, 2012, with episode number 446 of our show.
47440	53440	We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after
53440	57440	the Bobby Black Wolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
57440	62200	My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts here
62200	63260	with me as always.
63260	67000	Say hello first off to the one, the only, dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
67000	68000	Hi.
68000	69000	How are you Jamie?
69000	70000	Caffeinated.
70000	71000	Well caffeinated.
71000	72000	Awake?
72000	73000	Awake.
73000	74000	Well I started falling asleep on the way over here.
74000	75000	Buzzing?
75000	76000	I was bored before I got here.
76000	77000	That's not good.
77000	78000	Falling asleep while you drive, that's not good.
78000	87760	No, but then I was like, Starbucks, I can go there, wow, so yeah.
87760	91640	Alright, also joining us tonight, I don't know if he's caffeinated, but say hello to
91640	92960	Techmaster Loki.
92960	95080	I think I'm caffeinated, this has caffeine in it.
95080	97640	You do have a jumbo little soda, what soda is that?
97640	102600	It's more ice than soda, it's the McDonald's ripoff there.
102600	104400	There you go.
104400	109440	So anyway, join us live, if you are listening live here at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock
109440	112320	Eastern at all games, join our chat room.
112320	116480	Chat.orangeloungeradio.com is where you can interact with us, because of course it is
116480	120320	the show where every gamer has a voice, we do like to read your voices throughout the
120320	124640	show and we'll take your calls later, read your emails and all that good stuff.
124640	128800	Looking in our chat, we see some people are celebrating being able to be here live tonight
128800	132600	because they have tomorrow off, and I totally forgot that it's a three day weekend.
132600	136640	So happy President's Day I suppose, but I don't have tomorrow off.
136640	137640	Me neither.
137640	138640	Isn't that weird?
138640	142040	I have tomorrow off.
142040	143880	Always ruining my party.
143880	144880	Because I'm fun-employed.
144880	148600	You have every day off.
148600	150680	But yeah, what's up with that?
150680	151920	We don't get President's Day off.
151920	153600	I did at my old company too.
153600	157200	Well I think the deal is, unless you're a bank or a school or something, your company
157200	160440	either does Martin Luther King Day in January, which mine does.
160440	161440	I don't get that either.
161440	162440	Really?
162440	163440	You got screwed.
163440	165080	I don't know what to tell you.
165080	169520	One place I was with, we used to get floaters for the major bank holidays.
169520	174080	Yeah, we have what's called a floating holiday too in place of Veterans Day.
174080	178560	We don't get Veterans Day off, but we can take a floating holiday any time during the
178560	182360	year, which I usually use to cover my E3 trip the years I've gone.
182360	186240	I don't know if that'll happen this year, but you know what?
186240	188240	I don't know if E3 will happen this year.
188240	190040	It really depends on a number of factors.
190040	196240	Well, A, I'm probably not going to get in, but B, even like last year, I would go just
196240	201640	to see Bobby and anybody else I know that's going to the event to do a Disney thing, if
201640	202640	they're going.
202640	203640	We need to do D3.
203640	204640	Yeah, yeah.
204640	205640	Seriously.
205640	206640	I'm at the Disney convention.
206640	210600	But I am seriously, seriously... I haven't done this convention in four years, but this
210600	214640	year I really, really, really... Of course, so much of this depends on finances.
214640	219800	I want to do PACS this year, so I'm definitely looking into doing that.
219800	220800	PACS West, of course.
220800	224640	I went to... The last PACS I went to was the first PACS East a couple years ago.
224640	226800	I would love to go if someone would finance me.
226800	229720	She's... Well, we don't have OLR funds anymore.
229720	232340	We could do the Kickstarter thing.
232340	233340	It works for Double Fine.
233340	236760	Kickstarter so I can go to PACS.
236760	239480	Donate $20 and Dark Sakura will sign your butt.
239480	240480	There you go.
240480	241480	At PACS.
241480	242480	At PACS.
242480	243480	All right.
243480	245480	We'll figure something out.
245480	251240	Anyhow, let's talk games, video games, and this week, of course, the big, big story in
251240	252240	gaming.
252240	253240	PlayStation Vita.
253240	254240	No incur.
254240	255240	Come on.
255240	257120	Kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding.
257120	258640	I'm like, are you insane?
258640	259840	You saw that screen, too.
259840	260840	That's a beautiful screen.
260840	263200	It was pretty, but... That's the first time you've seen the Vita,
263200	264200	right?
264200	265200	Mm-hmm.
265200	267320	What I'm referring to, Loki is an early adopter of the Vita.
267320	270400	The Vita early adopter program started this week.
270400	271720	Very strange for a console launch.
271720	275440	I don't remember any console doing this before, but it's the whole like, pay an extra $50
275440	277040	and get it a week early.
277040	281200	Yeah, you get like a case and a crappy game.
281200	283560	And yeah, Little Deviants is not a good game.
283560	284560	Yeah.
284560	285880	It's a terrible game, to be honest.
285880	288280	Yeah, I have not heard a good thing about Little Deviants.
288280	291360	So what made you take the plunge to get the early Vita?
291360	292920	I just wanted... I wanted the Vita.
292920	300000	I decided, you know, I was gonna sell my 3DS, and so I did that, and I bought a Vita, and
300000	301000	I'm glad I did.
301000	305200	I think I'm gonna get a lot more use out of this than I will ever my 3DS.
305200	308440	What is making you think those early signs?
308440	312680	It... there's... with the 3DS, it was just kind of like, ooh, 3D, and then that kind
312680	314840	of wore off really fast.
314840	320800	And then it's like, ooh, it's just a DS with an analog stick, you know.
320800	326280	I just didn't really play anything on there that, you know, I played a couple, you know,
326280	330200	the launch games, which are kind of like, okay, pilot wings, fun.
330200	334760	Or you know, Street Fighter was all right, you know, but it wasn't really kind of something
334760	337360	that I really could get into.
337360	341200	And then the Mario games came out, and I'm like, okay, well, Mario Kart and Super Mario
341200	345280	3D Land, you know, this is gonna be something that like, oh my God, you know, this is gonna
345280	346280	really make it for me.
346280	351400	But... and I played those, and they were okay, but then I was like looking ahead, well,
351400	356160	what games are I'm actually gonna be looking forward to on the 3DS?
356160	362400	And the only thing I could come up with was Kid Icarus, and that's it.
362400	366440	I mean, I was afraid that it was gonna go kind of the way of the Wii.
366440	368680	You just didn't have enough people to swap note with.
368680	369680	That was the problem.
369680	371840	You needed more 3D cats in your life.
371840	374640	I just added like three chatters to my 3DS friends list tonight.
374640	376280	In fact, I need to send them cats.
376280	380880	As soon as I get the confirmation that they've all added me back, 3D cats.
380880	383080	That's why you hang on to the 3DS.
383080	384080	Swap note.
384080	385080	Revolutionary.
385080	386080	I... no.
386080	387080	No.
387080	388080	I'm sorry.
388080	389080	That's not why.
389080	392720	It's like 3D email.
392720	397160	And then the virtual console stuff is kind of cool, but once again it's like, okay, yeah,
397160	398160	neat.
398160	402120	You know, I can play NES games on another system.
402120	405400	But I don't really need to play NES games.
405400	410160	If I really want to play Nintendo games, I can play them on my PC.
410160	411960	I can play them on my Wii.
411960	414360	I can play them on almost anything.
414360	415360	My PSP.
415360	421960	Well, for me, I wanted to hang on to the 3DS mostly because a system is only as good as
421960	422960	the games that are on it.
422960	427920	And I know you are not as invested in the lineup, but remember, I thought Mario 3D Land
427920	429400	was one of the best games that came out last year.
429400	431440	I put it in my top three for the year.
431440	434840	And I think it's a fantastic game, and I don't really want to part with it yet.
434840	441640	And I don't know, Nintendo is getting really good at this whole stealthy launch.
441640	445480	Like I think at E3 there's going to be some more titles that are announced that will be
445480	446480	banged up.
446480	447480	I'm hoping the Smash Brothers game.
447480	448480	But we'll see.
448480	450040	I'm not going to get my hopes up.
450040	455000	I'm not, I'm not really, I'm not worried about the Smash Brothers game.
455000	459080	If I really want a Smash Brothers game like that, I can play it on the Wii or something.
459080	462920	And honestly, Smash Brothers was fun for a while on the Wii, and then I just didn't play
462920	463920	it anymore.
463920	468600	So I'm not, I don't know, I just don't see myself doing that.
468600	473000	However with the Vita, I can see myself, I can definitely see some more of the games
473000	477040	that I would normally play on it coming out for the Vita.
477040	480240	Like Call of Duty is going to be coming out for it.
480240	483840	A Grand Theft Auto is most definitely going to be coming out for it at some point.
483840	486880	You know, probably A Saint's Row the next time around.
486880	489120	That kind of stuff.
489120	494320	Walk us through a little bit of opening up the Vita for the first time, because my understanding
494320	499280	is A, it doesn't function at all like a Playstation, because the cross-media bar's not there.
499280	503560	And B, it has this whole like, welcome park or something it's called that's supposed to
503560	504560	orient you to the system?
504560	507400	I have not even touched that yet, to be honest.
507400	508400	Alright, fine.
508400	510520	But yeah, there's the welcome park thing.
510520	516440	Basically when you, as with most like, systems out there nowadays, when you first get the
516440	519920	Vita, you have to do a system update.
519920	525780	So you perform the system update, and you update to 1.6, and then you set up everything,
525780	529120	your Playstation Network stuff, if you have an account or whatever.
529120	533280	I had to reset the password on mine, because it had been so long since I logged into the
533280	534640	Playstation Network.
534640	539400	I had forgotten my password, although I hadn't really forgotten my password, it was just
539400	544840	forcing me to reset my password, because I apparently haven't, no actually no, I must
544840	550360	have reset my password at one point, because I downloaded those, the sorry we broke the
550360	552000	Playstation Network for a month.
552000	556240	I had trouble recalling my password after that too, because they had so many freaking
556240	562200	rules on the password, I had to think of something that fell into those, because my old password,
562200	567040	without trying to give it away, well I don't use it anymore, but it broke one of the rules.
567040	568600	So I had to really think.
568600	572880	Well, I finally remembered it was, it was just, there was a capital letter in there
572880	575920	somewhere, so I was like, ah okay, I forgot.
575920	581880	So I went ahead and did that, and so I got that all taken care of, and then I, pretty
581880	588520	much what I did, because I actually got it, I got it on Valentine's Day, because I'm cool
588520	594680	like that, and so there wasn't really much on the Playstation Network store to download,
594680	603240	I mean it was, I don't even think any demos were up yet at that time, it was just full
603240	606920	game purchases for the first party stuff.
606920	612280	It wasn't until like midnight, well midnight eastern time, that all the demos started coming
612280	618680	up for Ubisoft games and some of the launch day stuff.
618680	626040	So it's gorgeous, that was the first thing I noticed, you know, the screen's just amazing
626040	629640	looking and the touchscreen stuff works great.
629640	633880	You know, I don't even really care that it's the little bubbles on there, I mean it's,
633880	639440	just the way it functions is really smooth, so that was kinda cool.
639440	645280	The near things neat, although I'm not really sure what the point of it is yet, I mean I
645280	649280	know I unlock some things and I can see some random people around there and I get these
649280	653320	really off the wall random friend requests and I don't even know who these people are.
653320	656880	Is it because you're showing up on the near thing or whatever it's called?
656880	658200	Yeah, I think it is.
658200	659200	Interesting.
659200	660200	I don't know who they are.
660200	663200	Like, someone sent me a message like, okay maybe it's gonna say hey I'm Alyssa or something
663200	670160	and it was like, sup, I'm like that doesn't fucking help, I don't know who you are.
670160	673920	Yeah that's a good point, like if that all random stuff's gonna happen and you wanna
673920	677280	add us on PlayStation Network, you might wanna say you're a listener, so that way we know
677280	683000	like you're not like a random, does that thing show where you live?
683000	684000	It's not gonna give that away, right?
684000	688720	No, it just, it'll say like you're, and it's not even accurate, entirely accurate, it'll
688720	697960	show like, okay, your location is this cross section, you know, this cross street, which
697960	705460	is not entirely accurate to where I'm at, and then it'll say this person is, you know,
705460	706800	this far away from you.
706800	711360	It doesn't show where they're at, it just shows, okay, this person's this far away from
711360	712360	you.
712360	713360	Approximately.
713360	714840	So, that's about it.
714840	718520	So what's the point of that, besides being able to like, add random ass people who are
718520	719720	your neighbors?
719720	725520	Um, you, well you can see like popularity of certain games, like it'll change, you know,
725520	731520	um, like, oh okay, you know, Katamari's, you know, going up, or, I don't know.
731520	736920	What is popular in your town, Orangevale, or whatever, wherever it is you live?
736920	740880	It just shows, seems to show the stuff that I have, like I'm gonna pull it up right now,
740880	743920	we'll see what's popular right here.
743920	748960	Just going to our chatroom at chat.orangevalery.com, Tigerclaw says, heh, sky on swap note now.
748960	752160	Yes, I saw that all the chatters added me, so I sent some cat pictures.
752160	755840	Now, Tigerclaw, cause you were already on my list, you already saw these same notes,
755840	757840	I just, I went back and sent some old notes.
757840	762200	Cause I don't have new 3D cat pictures, but I will get some soon.
762200	763600	So there's your 3D cat update.
763600	764600	Back to the Vita.
764600	770840	Okay, so right now, I'm syncing with the area, and it says I've traveled 21 kilometers today.
770840	773760	Yeah, it's kilometers, it's not miles, even though this.
773760	775880	You gotta be able to change that somewhere, I'm sure.
775880	776880	I don't know.
776880	783640	So, let's see here, out and about is one of the options, and it's showing popularity surge.
783640	786440	There are five people playing Katamari.
786440	792600	Topping the charts, the number of people for Little Deviance.
792600	800120	And topping the charts, 18 people playing Little Deviance, and Katamari, Lumis.
800120	804480	I think it's just showing the stuff I've played, cause that's what it seems like that's happening
804480	805480	there.
805480	811560	And it says also, I've just unlocked another thing, another discovery.
811560	816240	Well, I'm also, I also live in the poorer part of town, so nobody probably has a Vita
816240	817240	here.
817240	821720	Like, I just unlocked a ModNation Racer road trip thing.
821720	825480	I don't even know what it is, Alien 1 is what it is.
825480	830240	A track, it says track part, it's from some, oh, it's from the person I just added, who
830240	835000	I still don't know who the hell they are, Daredevil Onion.
835000	837720	They sent me a track part.
837720	839960	That sounds like what Dark Sakura had for lunch today.
839960	844120	So I will download your track part, but I don't know who that is, so that doesn't really
844120	846120	help me.
846120	853880	Yeah, so, I mean, I don't, I still don't really know what the functionality of this is supposed
853880	854880	to be.
854880	862280	I can see some people that are playing nearby, but I just don't really understand what this
862280	865120	is all about yet.
865120	869880	Oh, here we go, I think I can, units of distance, there we go.
869880	871920	I knew you could get it in miles.
871920	872920	There you go.
872920	873920	Anyways.
873920	874920	So, there's that.
874920	877960	Alright, tell us, tell us a little bit about the games, quickly.
877960	881560	You've played, what, you've played Rayman, you were raving about the graphics in Rayman,
881560	882560	right?
882560	883640	Rayman I actually haven't played too much of yet.
883640	887480	I just like, ooh, pretty graphics, and I went on and played something else.
887480	890040	But yeah, Rayman's really, really gorgeous.
890040	895840	I mean, Rayman Origins on the console looked great, and I'd say it's exactly like the console.
895840	901520	I mean, that level of detail is there, and it's just, it's just jaw-dropping of how gorgeous
901520	902760	the game is.
902760	903760	And it plays great.
903760	905400	It's a great platformer game.
905400	907640	So that one's a good one.
907640	913560	I got Luminous, Luminous is, you know, Luminous, there are some weird things that they've added
913560	916920	to it, like you can tap the back panel, you're supposed to be able to tap it with the music
916920	922240	and you unlock, it helps you unlock your power-up faster, although you can just spam the back
922240	926600	of your system to unlock it as well.
926600	929280	So I don't really know that point of that.
929280	933200	The music in it's alright, although most of it I don't recognize, and most of it isn't
933200	935300	as epic as I thought it would be.
935300	943340	But there's some still, you know, good ones in there, like there's, oh, what was it, Window
943340	946800	Liquor is in there, and that's awesome.
946800	951800	And there's some other, some other songs that I've recognized.
951800	956760	I heard something about a whole new kind of block that will shuffle block colors around
956760	957760	it.
957760	962240	Yeah, there's a block that will shuffle some of the stuff on there, there's also the blocks
962240	968300	that you can drop, well the power-up that you start off with the default avatar allows
968300	975880	you to, it'll break anything of the same color that's touching it, so you can eliminate a
975880	976880	lot of stuff on there.
976880	979160	Which was the old Luminous game, if I remember right.
979160	982200	Yes, I think they have that.
982200	990040	So it's fun, I like the game, and I actually played it one round for a good three hours
990040	991040	I think the other day.
991040	993780	That seems to be getting the best reviews out of all the Vita games, is Luminous, which
993780	994780	doesn't surprise me.
994780	995780	It's a fun-
995780	997160	It's the PSP all over again.
997160	1001080	It's a fun game, but here's the thing, and this was kind of a problem with the original
1001080	1007120	Luminous game, but it's even worse than this one, is some of those skins are so hard to
1007120	1008120	see.
1008120	1011960	Like there'll be some, some of the skins are completely flat, and they have the square
1011960	1015480	blocks and stuff like that, some of them are like rounded or whatever.
1015480	1020200	Some of them though have this weird fish-eye thing to them where it kind of, the screen
1020200	1025500	bends a little bit, and it's just really disorienting.
1025500	1029520	It's frustrating because I don't like, I don't like the look of it.
1029520	1031200	I guess that's part of the challenge, maybe?
1031200	1032200	I don't know.
1032200	1034920	It's not even really a challenge, it's just like, okay, this song has this skin.
1034920	1037080	It's just, it's dumb.
1037080	1041040	But whatever, I mean, it is what it is.
1041040	1042040	So that's Luminous.
1042040	1045800	Honestly, I haven't played Little Deviants at all because I heard it's terrible.
1045800	1049000	My coworker played it and he said, yep, it's terrible.
1049000	1052360	So I haven't gotten to try that yet, so I can't really say if it's actually terrible
1052360	1055600	or not, but I'm not planning on keeping it too long.
1055600	1060280	I'm actually thinking of just trading it in and getting another memory card.
1060280	1068520	And then, of course, I also played Touch My Katamari, which, it must have been a while
1068520	1072600	since I've played other Katamari games because the levels seem new to me, but I hear that
1072600	1073600	they're not.
1073600	1077480	I hear they're just repeats of the old game again, which is kind of disappointing.
1077480	1079920	It's really hard, I've found.
1079920	1085040	I mean, I've been failing levels left and right and usually I breeze right through it.
1085040	1089600	It's almost like it'll give you enough time to do everything.
1089600	1095040	Not even necessarily breezing through, but I can't even get a five star rating after
1095040	1098200	one or two tries.
1098200	1099880	It's almost impossible.
1099880	1104960	I think maybe some of the controls in there, but the way they've done the controls are
1104960	1106400	kind of weird.
1106400	1109600	They have everything mapped to buttons, which is nice because I don't like a lot of the
1109600	1118280	touch screen stuff, like having to use the back panel to flip my Katamari around or jump.
1118280	1121600	That's mapped to the shoulder buttons as well.
1121600	1126920	And then to do the charge, you either have to hold the touch screen on the front or you
1126920	1133560	spin your analog sticks around in a certain direction.
1133560	1140240	And I don't know, neither way seems to work very well and that's kind of sad.
1140240	1141240	It's really bad.
1141240	1145240	And at the same time, it's like, hmm, yeah, that's cool that you mapped that to the analog
1145240	1149720	sticks and yet you have all these face buttons you're not using at all.
1149720	1154240	None of the face buttons are used in the game.
1154240	1157800	Maybe they overdid it from people's complaints about the PSP game, but they could have just
1157800	1158800	okay.
1158800	1162600	They could either had it where you map your own custom buttons or they could have had
1162600	1166760	it where, okay, Dash is now one of the buttons on the face.
1166760	1168320	How hard would that have been?
1168320	1174000	You added multiple stuff for the other buttons in the game, but oh, let's just not map it
1174000	1176240	to the face buttons because that makes sense.
1176240	1181080	Before you get to another game, let me read some comments from chat, chat.orangetonstrader.com.
1181080	1184760	Ahamkara in our chat room says, I find the Vita annoying already.
1184760	1186920	I tried one at an evil G in my area.
1186920	1191480	In some menus you have multiple choices on screen, but you have to touch to choose to
1191480	1192560	proceed.
1192560	1193840	No buttons are used.
1193840	1199340	You know, I had that same problem when I was on or when I went to evil G. Yes, I set foot
1199340	1203400	in one to play it as well as I forgot that it had a touch screen because I associate
1203400	1207360	the touch screen thing with like Apple, Nintendo, like I just forgot and I'm sitting there in
1207360	1208640	the menu for ModNation races.
1208640	1211400	I'm like, why can't I play the God damn game?
1211400	1212400	It's not a big deal.
1212400	1213400	Yeah, I know.
1213400	1215840	Once I figured it out, I'm like, oh yeah, it's actually, it's really nice using the
1215840	1216840	touch screen.
1216840	1221440	A really interesting point that was brought up was that it does add a barrier for access
1221440	1222440	ability.
1222440	1227040	You know, I have a blind friend on Twitter that follows that's like, you know, this is
1227040	1230940	limiting my accessibility cause you know, a blind person can use the buttons and everything,
1230940	1234800	but might not necessarily know where to touch on the screen to use the menus.
1234800	1237960	Well that's, it's going to be actually in the main menus and all that.
1237960	1243040	Well, here's the problem with the main menus too, is that they can be all, all those buttons
1243040	1246720	just like you can on the iOS and stuff, they can all be rearranged.
1246720	1252760	So you know, it may not, and when you get stuff installed, it might not exactly be in
1252760	1256120	the right order that you're thinking it's going to be in.
1256120	1263000	So I don't know, they could easily add a button, you know, or patch it in later on, but it's
1263000	1267440	going to be kind of difficult because icons can get added left and right.
1267440	1271400	I don't know, unless you can change the sound effect that when you select a certain one,
1271400	1272400	it sounds different.
1272400	1273400	I don't know.
1273400	1274400	Well, usually, I mean, think about it.
1274400	1277920	It's really, you know, there's a lot of things that we take for granted sometimes, but I
1277920	1283200	mean, a lot of folks in the blind gaming community, I get the sense they kind of, they're kind
1283200	1287040	of trade ideas and so forth, and they know exactly how many taps one way and how many
1287040	1290040	taps another way to get the result that they want.
1290040	1294360	And you know, sometimes you might have very limited visibility of certain colors and so
1294360	1297100	forth, and it's very, very sound oriented.
1297100	1301700	Like I know fighting games are very popular because you use the sound cues a lot in those
1301700	1302700	games.
1302700	1305560	There's some YouTube out there, some blind guy just fucking regulating on Soulcalibur,
1305560	1308640	I seem to remember, and it's all sound.
1308640	1309640	Maybe.
1309640	1310640	Yeah.
1310640	1316160	But you adapt to what you know, but sometimes the system puts a barrier in place.
1316160	1320280	It does seem a little silly that they can't just, you know, I get, okay, yes, we get it.
1320280	1325000	The Vita has a touch screen, all right, now maybe not everybody wants to whore that out.
1325000	1330060	Like any negative thing I'm hearing about the Vita on like Uncharted or even a game
1330060	1333520	like Little Deviants is that, you know what, or like Uncharted, let's take Uncharted, is
1333520	1338700	like, okay, A, it wasn't developed by Naughty Dog, B, the folks that developed it felt the
1338700	1342240	need to really whore the touch screen and all the new stuff in it.
1342240	1346000	I don't think it's that they felt the need, I think it's Sony felt the need to tell them
1346000	1347000	to do that.
1347000	1348000	Right.
1348000	1352800	You know, it's kind of like, you know, Excite Truck, Excite Truck is an awesome racing game,
1352800	1356160	and then Nintendo felt the need to tell them, hey, you know what, we need to add some mini
1356160	1358160	games in the middle of the race.
1358160	1361080	Makes some fucking sense.
1361080	1364680	The other thing I don't really care for about the Vita is sometimes it's very uncomfortable
1364680	1366080	to hold the system.
1366080	1371040	Like for example, the next game, which I got, which is funny because it's a full game, I
1371040	1377000	didn't anticipate it being a full game, apparently when the system launched they had, like I
1377000	1380840	said, demos that came up, you know, Ubisoft demos and stuff, and one of the games I did
1380840	1384520	want to check out was Michael Jackson and the Experience because it's a rhythm music
1384520	1387680	game on the Vita, and apparently it's, you know, pretty fun to play.
1387680	1392200	So I downloaded that demo, didn't even really get a chance, I downloaded that in Uncharted
1392200	1394000	because I was going to play them the next day.
1394000	1395480	Can you do downloading in the background?
1395480	1396480	Yes.
1396480	1397480	Okay, cool.
1397480	1398480	Yes, you can.
1398480	1401640	And you can pause games too, you can just like totally go out of it, which is great
1401640	1404880	because I use the web browser on there and web browser is awesome.
1404880	1405880	It works great.
1405880	1406880	Really?
1406880	1407880	You can just...
1407880	1408880	Does it do Flash?
1408880	1410960	I don't think so.
1410960	1414560	But you can go to websites and you can just, you know, hit the guide button, boop, go to
1414560	1418440	a website, okay, I need to look up a FAQ on this game, look it up, whatever, and then
1418440	1421560	switch back to your game again and take off.
1421560	1425280	But yeah, Michael Jackson and Experience, actually a pretty fun music game.
1425280	1426980	But here's the ironic part.
1426980	1431000	The demo, originally when they first put it up, was the full game.
1431000	1432500	Oops.
1432500	1441440	So there's a few mix-ups where it was allowing you to download the full game for a few hours.
1441440	1444200	So I have the full game of Michael Jackson and the Experience.
1444200	1447600	I didn't pay for it, I still earn trophies from it, I just can't sync them because I
1447600	1449520	didn't actually purchase the game.
1449520	1450520	But I don't care.
1450520	1453240	Interesting that it knows that.
1453240	1457000	If I rent games from Gamefly or something, will I be able to do my trophies?
1457000	1460800	Yeah, you will be able to because it's the physical cartridge.
1460800	1465880	I have the digital download, so since it doesn't show that I have the actual full game, I don't
1465880	1468540	have whatever it is to sync it.
1468540	1472040	Great question from Tigerclaw in our chatroom at chat.orangesontraday.com, does the Vita
1472040	1474280	have an internet radio player?
1474280	1476660	I don't think so.
1476660	1480900	We had that OLR PSP.com, which technically is still there, it hasn't been updated in
1480900	1482680	a very long time.
1482680	1484840	Yeah, whatever.
1484840	1488760	I tried going to OLR Vita.com.
1488760	1494500	I tried going to the All Games page today, and it did not play the radio player, so.
1494500	1495760	So it might not do HTML5.
1495760	1496760	Yeah, probably not.
1496760	1497960	But no wait, is it Flash?
1497960	1499760	I think All Games.com is Flash.
1499760	1500760	It's HTML5 now.
1500760	1501760	Is it?
1501760	1502760	Yeah.
1502760	1503760	So it doesn't, I don't think it does that.
1503760	1505760	Oh yeah, because it works on my iPhone.
1505760	1508440	I think you can very easily add an app for that.
1508440	1512120	I mean, I haven't really mess, well let's click music.
1512120	1516240	I haven't even really tried the music part yet because I don't have any music on here.
1516240	1517240	But uh.
1517240	1520320	What, you mean you're not downloading episodes of OLR to your phone?
1520320	1521320	Or your PSP?
1521320	1526000	Dude, I have a four gig card, it would fill that thing up really fast.
1526000	1528120	That's true, that's true.
1528120	1529440	So no, I don't have that.
1529440	1534800	No, it doesn't look like it has a radio player in there, which is fine, you know.
1534800	1537840	That could be added later on, easy, I mean.
1537840	1538840	So.
1538840	1542300	Hey, if there's a way to easily get OLR episodes in the PlayStation Vita, though, for those
1542300	1545080	that do have bigger memory cards, I would let, you know, I'm all about, get the show
1545080	1548720	out, get the show out there, however we can do it, you know.
1548720	1549720	I'm all for that.
1549720	1550720	So.
1550720	1555240	Alright, well anyway, we talked about the Vita an awfully long time, so.
1555240	1560720	What do you hope to most see from the system in the future?
1560720	1561720	More games.
1561720	1565240	I mean, there's a lot of games coming out already for it, and a lot of games I'm looking
1565240	1566240	forward to.
1566240	1573680	You know, the new Resistance game, Gravity Rush looks awesome, and I was trying to download
1573680	1579600	the demo for it on my PS3 because I have a Japanese account and a UK account and stuff
1579600	1584600	like that for, you know, getting multi-region demos, but they won't let you put them on
1584600	1589120	the Vita, because you can only download demos for the account that's on the Vita because
1589120	1592560	that's linked, that's stuck to one account, not multiple accounts.
1592560	1596640	If I could put multiple accounts on there, I could have demos from all regions, which
1596640	1600160	would have been awesome, because they also have the Twitter app over there, and the Flickr
1600160	1604200	app already out in Japan, it's just not over here yet until Wednesday.
1604200	1606920	Oh yeah, I forget those things have cameras on them.
1606920	1608760	Yeah, they're not very good.
1608760	1609760	Yeah.
1609760	1610760	It's about as good as the 3DS.
1610760	1616280	I mean, it's, they, I really wish they'd have a bigger camera, but I understand their thing
1616280	1620960	was, it's gameplay first, you know, camera is just like, eh, whatever, but yeah, it has
1620960	1622720	a front and back camera.
1622720	1623720	Weird.
1623720	1628280	And, here's the other thing that kind of sucks about it, the AR games aren't up yet, so they
1628280	1631280	have these cards that don't do anything at the moment.
1631280	1632280	Not yet.
1632280	1638440	But they will, they will on Wednesday, and I'm trying to think what else is kind of cool.
1638440	1642200	Yeah, the Welcome Park stuff, I haven't played it yet, but it's a bunch of little minigames
1642200	1647200	to get you acclimated to the features of the Vita, and you can earn trophies from it, so
1647200	1652000	that's kind of something, and I would recommend if you're thinking about gaining a system
1652000	1656480	and thinking about gaining a memory card, you probably want more than 4 gigs, because
1656480	1663180	I even just, you know, trying out some demos and stuff, it fills up the card really fast.
1663180	1666040	But 8 gigs is probably, probably good.
1666040	1667040	Alright.
1667040	1671040	Well, I know that was extensive, but, you know, new system launch week, what can you
1671040	1672040	do?
1672040	1675280	I will be getting mine Wednesday, I'm really looking forward to it, I've only gotten to
1675280	1679360	play with one a little bit, I'm getting Luminous and Katamari, so I'll tell you my impressions
1679360	1680360	next week.
1680360	1684200	Dark Sakura, I know one's not in the cards for you right away, but you, you were thinking
1684200	1685960	about it a little bit, but you want an iPad more, huh?
1685960	1687760	I really want the iPad 3.
1687760	1689960	Yeah, because you can do more design stuff on that.
1689960	1693760	Yeah, it's more practical for me, in that I can play tons of games on it too.
1693760	1694760	Sure, sure.
1694760	1698840	Alright, well, anyhow, but, but, it's, you gotta admit, it's pretty gorgeous, the screen's
1698840	1699840	pretty gorgeous.
1699840	1700840	Yeah, it's nice.
1700840	1701840	Alright.
1701840	1705040	Uh, let's, let's move on, we always start off the show with How Was Your Gaming Week,
1705040	1708680	which I guess we kind of already did in a sense, but let's open it up to whatever we've
1708680	1709680	been playing.
1709680	1711920	Ladies first, Dark Sakura, How Was Your Gaming Week?
1711920	1715680	Uh, it was pretty eventful, I mean, relatively.
1715680	1718160	Dan and I played a lot of Bubble Bobble this morning.
1718160	1719800	A lot of Bubble Bobble.
1719800	1720800	I suck at it.
1720800	1721800	Old school classic.
1721800	1722800	Yeah.
1722800	1723800	What system, because it was on everything.
1723800	1726080	Not just one collection, but on the RPS3.
1726080	1731400	Oh god, is that the one that came with, uh, it was like Bubble Bobble and it had-
1731400	1733400	Rainbow Islands and the Rainbow Islands Deluxe.
1733400	1736620	Oh, I thought there was another one, no, because that was a Capcom game, what am I thinking?
1736620	1742280	I'm thinking of that game where you shoot the arrow up and it explodes the bubbles and
1742280	1746400	it creates like a chain at the top of the screen and anything that hits it explodes
1746400	1747400	too.
1747400	1748400	Puzzle Bobble?
1748400	1749400	No, no, no, no, no.
1749400	1750400	Best of Move?
1750400	1751400	No, it's Capcom.
1751400	1752400	It was an old arcade game, somebody in chat was yelling it out.
1752400	1753400	Buster Brothers?
1753400	1754400	No.
1754400	1755400	That's it.
1755400	1756400	No.
1756400	1757400	Well, yeah, now I know.
1757400	1759760	I thought, I don't know why I tied those two games together in my mind because they weren't
1759760	1761840	even the same company, but Bubbles.
1761840	1762840	No.
1762840	1768040	We played, um, Bubble Bobble a little bit today and, um, I was very alarmed that my
1768040	1772360	friend who was over there at the time had never ever seen it.
1772360	1773360	And he's my age.
1773360	1774360	And I said-
1774360	1775360	How do you not know the song at least?
1775360	1778160	What planet were you born on?
1778160	1781820	So, um, and I played well.
1781820	1782820	And I played-
1782820	1783820	And you played well at it?
1783820	1789960	A lot of Busta Move on my phone, which I broke down and bought another puzzle pack.
1789960	1791960	Who in the world does not know this song?
1791960	1795960	That's like one of the best ones.
1795960	1798960	Yeah, this is the best one.
1798960	1799960	Sing along.
1799960	1808980	And I would be stuck in your head all day.
1808980	1809980	And the person next to you on the bus is looking at you funny.
1809980	1811840	I was making up lyrics to it.
1811840	1812840	Were you?
1812840	1813840	Yeah.
1813840	1816960	Have you ever watched that if video game themes had lyrics?
1816960	1818720	No, I haven't.
1818720	1819720	I've heard of it though.
1819720	1820720	Those are funny.
1820720	1824440	Um, actually, what's my favorite?
1824440	1832240	They should do a Bubble Bobble like, I was actually just singing Bubble Bobble as the
1832240	1833240	words.
1833240	1838680	Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, yeah.
1838680	1841000	So how was it?
1841000	1847620	You had, you know, games back in the day didn't really have extensive soundtracks, you know?
1847620	1850840	Like they started too late in the NES era, like especially a game like Final Fantasy
1850840	1851840	or something.
1851840	1855360	But a lot of those old games had like one little riff that would play through the whole
1855360	1856360	damn game.
1856360	1857360	So it had to be addicting.
1857360	1860560	Oh, and there's one other game that actually I was looking for that I don't think I have
1860560	1865200	on PC Engine that I want is Son Son 2.
1865200	1868800	Son Son is a fun little side scroller and I was, found myself wishing today that I had
1868800	1871360	a copy, and that's it.
1871360	1872360	Good times.
1872360	1876200	Uh, Loki, I know you've already talked extensively about the Vita, but opening it up to whatever
1876200	1878120	you've been playing this week, is there anything else to share?
1878120	1879600	Call of duty.
1879600	1882120	My coworkers are starting to get really mad at me.
1882120	1884920	Hasn't that been the running theme for how long now?
1884920	1892520	Yeah, well, thankfully my other coworker comes back off of his paternity leave, so at least
1892520	1894520	there'll be someone else to play.
1894520	1897720	But yeah, they're getting mad.
1897720	1903400	They had a conference in a, or they had a little group meeting in the conference room.
1903400	1912040	I'm trying to think of one of the funny, uh, oh yeah, they, of course, you know, they know
1912040	1915880	that there's people that play professional Starcraft in Korea.
1915880	1919880	Of course, they mucked it up when they were doing the install.
1919880	1923560	Why don't you just go, we're just going to send you to Korea to play competitive World
1923560	1924560	of Warcraft.
1924560	1925560	I'm like, okay.
1925560	1931960	Well, if you want to get technical, arena is a big thing they do at Blizzcon.
1931960	1936800	And I don't know if Korea is necessarily the big, I think that's Europe is really like,
1936800	1940600	there's a lot of teams and you're like the biggest rating guilds are all over there.
1940600	1944760	So I mean, it's just, it was just funny.
1944760	1945760	All right.
1945760	1947960	Anything else for your gaming week that you want to share?
1947960	1949600	Um, that's it.
1949600	1950600	All right.
1950600	1956280	So gaming week, um, not a whole, whole, whole lot, but some new stuff I of course been playing.
1956280	1957280	Wow.
1957280	1958280	I'm on a rating team in wow now.
1958280	1961760	So it's a little different, by the way, speaking of Warcraft, Horde house is coming back this
1961760	1962760	week.
1962760	1964560	Um, which is exciting because we've been gone for a month.
1964560	1967600	We've just, we kind of suffered from burnout a little bit.
1967600	1970800	And as you guys know, my cohost is on hiatus from wow.
1970800	1975480	But um, and, and I just want to quell shiny fears, extra for an, I will both be on the
1975480	1976480	new show.
1976480	1977480	So don't worry about that.
1977480	1979960	Nobody got fired or nothing, but it's going to be a little different and you'll have to
1979960	1982120	tune in this week to find out how.
1982120	1985240	But one of the things I'll be able to talk more about is like a legit rating because
1985240	1987440	I've been doing more of that and more PVP.
1987440	1991960	Um, so lots of wow, but I ha I believe it or not have had a life outside of wow.
1991960	1994280	Um, a lot of it centers around the PlayStation three.
1994280	1997960	I decided, and I'm going to get shit for this.
1997960	2001640	I already know it, but I decided to take the plunge and sign up for PlayStation plus this
2001640	2002640	week.
2002640	2006340	Um, and I think the catalyst that did it for me was the fact that the Simpsons arcade game
2006340	2008200	was free with PlayStation plus.
2008200	2013600	And it really made me stop and think, damn, they are giving out free games all the freaking
2013600	2015720	time on PlayStation plus.
2015720	2019480	And especially if I've invested in the Vita and so forth, I'm getting all these minis.
2019480	2020480	Why the heck not?
2020480	2021480	I'm just going to get it now.
2021480	2022480	Yes.
2022480	2024760	Before you guys, I know, I know people are typing it in chat already.
2024760	2029360	I already know if I, if I stopped paying for PlayStation plus, I'm fully aware you lose
2029360	2031020	access to all these games.
2031020	2032600	That's kind of the, the catalyst to it all.
2032600	2039440	But then I was thinking, how many freaking games have I bought on Xbox live arcade hint
2039440	2041980	a lot that I really don't play anymore.
2041980	2046160	That if I lost access to it today, I'd be like, eh, Oh, well, you know, despite the
2046160	2052520	fact that I paid five or $10 and I first got it, you know, so I'm not like, I fully realized
2052520	2056200	that going into this deal that I might lose access to these games later on, but it's giving
2056200	2062360	me the chance to really sample things that otherwise might not be worth a full download.
2062360	2064440	For example, Simpson's arcade game.
2064440	2065440	Okay.
2065440	2066440	Here's the thing.
2066440	2069640	We've all been wanting this game on, on the network, the PlayStation network and Xbox
2069640	2070640	live forever.
2070640	2074520	Like I even want to say we did a listless it's on iPhone a long, long time.
2074520	2076880	Ah, it's a reimagining is on the iPhone.
2076880	2077880	Tricky, tricky.
2077880	2079700	Cause EA has the license now.
2079700	2085640	So the one that's on the iPhone is inspired by the arcade game, but it's not exactly the
2085640	2089400	arcade game, but the one that's on PlayStation network.
2089400	2093720	And I don't know how they worked out the licensing and whatever, but it is the classic arcade
2093720	2094720	game.
2094720	2098560	Uh, the U S ROM and the Japanese ROM and all that stuff, you can play it online.
2098560	2102140	And yeah, I played through it and I was like, Oh man, I used to love this game in the arcades,
2102140	2105760	but now that I've done it, will I do it again next month?
2105760	2108040	Will I play it every week?
2108040	2109440	Probably not.
2109440	2113760	So if I decide not to renew PlayStation plus after three months, yeah, I know, but it's
2113760	2116440	not look, look, the stages and stuff are different.
2116440	2121360	Like it, they, they, they know that people want the Simpsons arcade game on the phone,
2121360	2123360	but EA didn't do the Simpsons arcade game.
2123360	2124360	Konami did.
2124360	2125360	This one's put up.
2125360	2126360	Oh, that's right.
2126360	2127360	Yep.
2127360	2128920	So, and the one that's on network is a Konami.
2128920	2132360	So yeah, JV Mon says the same thing in chat sky.
2132360	2134200	You've bought hundreds of dollars in XBLA games.
2134200	2135840	You've played once.
2135840	2136840	Absolutely right.
2136840	2139920	Uh, Kaijuto says, Rob, if all you wanted was Simpsons arcade game, you could have just
2139920	2141960	bought it for the same price as PSN plus.
2141960	2143280	Yes, that's true.
2143280	2147860	But then I thought, you know, why not get some of the extra other games?
2147860	2150360	And I got two other games too already.
2150360	2155880	Uh, one of them was this kind of basic bitch, uh, monkey ball clone game.
2155880	2160640	It's called hamster ball, but it not only had a monkey ball clone, but it had like a
2160640	2162180	marble madness clone.
2162180	2165840	And I started playing that, like there's two different types of like versions and one of
2165840	2166840	them was a marble madness clone.
2166840	2170880	I was like, okay, this, this is kind of cool because like marble madness is one of those
2170880	2171880	games.
2171880	2174680	I forgot was out there, but I really did love that game.
2174680	2177560	And to be playing this, I was like, what the hell does this remind me of?
2177560	2178560	Oh shit.
2178560	2179560	It's marble madness.
2179560	2180560	And I was like, okay.
2180560	2181560	Okay.
2181560	2182560	Hamster ball.
2182560	2183560	I'm onto you.
2183560	2184560	So that was kind of neat.
2184560	2185560	And I didn't pay for it.
2185560	2191860	Uh, and then I got a game called battle Fantasia, which was a very chibi RPG ish fighting game
2191860	2195520	where you actually have hit points and you know, not a game I probably would have checked
2195520	2199020	out otherwise, but it was, it's neat and I didn't pay anything for it.
2199020	2202880	So, uh, go to our chat at chat.org.com.
2202880	2204480	Uh, where is it?
2204480	2205480	Rama?
2205480	2209480	Rama said PlayStation plus a fool and their money is soon parted.
2209480	2211480	Well, fine.
2211480	2212560	You know, you're welcome to your opinion.
2212560	2213560	You are that fool.
2213560	2214560	Well, hold on though.
2214560	2217280	No, somebody made me thinking of Adam's family.
2217280	2221900	Honestly answer me this, how is Xbox live any better of a deal at this point?
2221900	2223640	Like I'm not trying to sound like a Sony fan boy.
2223640	2227880	I'm really not, but like, you know, go back four years ago in this show when Sony was
2227880	2228880	really struggling.
2228880	2231720	I didn't even hell as much as anyone else did, but I really feel like we've reached
2231720	2236760	this point where outside of connect, I feel like my PlayStation three has more to offer.
2236760	2238840	And that even goes as far as like PlayStation plus and stuff.
2238840	2246240	What does Xbox live give me online gaming, which is on PlayStation network for free anyway,
2246240	2249160	you know, Xbox isn't exactly giving away games or any of this stuff.
2249160	2253040	So, I mean, I really am starting to question why the hell am I hanging onto an Xbox live
2253040	2254040	gold account?
2254040	2258160	I don't play anything on Xbox live right now that isn't a connect game.
2258160	2259160	Don't get me wrong.
2259160	2262200	I love dance central and rhythm party and all that, but I'm hanging on to Xbox live
2262200	2264800	gold because I've already paid for it.
2264800	2268320	Why is Konami made a game called fish kebab?
2268320	2272640	Cause they, they can have weird stuff.
2272640	2273640	Not meaning to derail.
2273640	2275480	I was just looking through it.
2275480	2276480	Okay.
2276480	2281360	So, well I, I'm not going to give you shit because it's your money and you can do what
2281360	2282760	the fuck you want with it.
2282760	2284800	So let me know how it works out.
2284800	2285800	I will.
2285800	2286800	Yeah, that's all.
2286800	2289080	It's neat that you get the minis and all that.
2289080	2291480	And black Wolf and chat says it amuses me to always here.
2291480	2294400	I didn't pay for it when you got access to it by paying for it.
2294400	2295400	Okay.
2295400	2296400	Blah, blah, blah, whatever.
2296400	2297400	Fine.
2297400	2300120	But, but at the same time, I've already probably got more value out of this than I have my
2300120	2301640	year of Xbox live so far.
2301640	2302640	Yeah.
2302640	2303640	Really?
2303640	2306400	Do we get free games each month with Xbox live?
2306400	2307400	No.
2307400	2311960	I mean, we get discounts sometimes and demos.
2311960	2314360	They're not free cause you paid for it.
2314360	2315360	That's true.
2315360	2318080	I have that Castlevania game.
2318080	2319200	I haven't tried it.
2319200	2320200	It's interesting.
2320200	2322000	Castlevania puzzle on core of the night.
2322000	2323000	It's weird.
2323000	2324000	Yeah.
2324000	2325000	All right.
2325000	2326000	Anyhow.
2326000	2327000	So you know what?
2327000	2328040	I did it and if I didn't, you know, it's just, I just did three months.
2328040	2331400	So I was like, you know, if I don't want to do it and I already turned off the auto subscription
2331400	2335400	thing cause it tries to make you turn it on, but you just go in and turn it off and there
2335400	2336400	you go.
2336400	2338680	Which is already a plus, which is already, yeah.
2338680	2340800	Something you can't do on the three 60.
2340800	2350880	So again, without taking a, a, uh, a trip to India via the telephone.
2350880	2351880	So there you go.
2351880	2352880	All right.
2352880	2354480	That's enough of my gaming week.
2354480	2358580	So let's talk housekeeping real quick of which I don't have a whole lot, but I will of course
2358580	2362320	mention the Facebook and the Twitter's facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
2362320	2367320	We're also on Twitter, twitter.com slash orange launch radio or twitter.com slash O L R and
2367320	2369840	we're on Google plus under orange lounge radio.
2369840	2370880	No URL there.
2370880	2371880	Question for you.
2371880	2377160	Since you use your PlayStation three more than I do, um, your PlayStation three, you
2377160	2380760	can set it up to where your trophy stuff gets posted to the Facebook, right?
2380760	2381760	Yeah.
2381760	2382760	Okay.
2382760	2387680	You can do that with the Vita too, but I obviously did not set that up cause I don't want to spend
2387680	2392800	my, well, all somebody has to do is block the application, but I actually kind of enjoy
2392800	2396480	reading it because it tells me like I leave it unblocked and I don't mind people posting
2396480	2401120	those because it tells me what games my friends are playing and a lot of times I'll see so
2401120	2404260	and so is playing this game and I'll be like, is this any good?
2404260	2405520	And I get the same thing.
2405520	2410700	Like I posted trophies from Simpsons arcade game and somebody was like, so is it more
2410700	2412640	nostalgia or is it actually fun?
2412640	2416160	And I was kind of like, well, it's a little bit of both.
2416160	2420840	So you know, I, I, I do actually like the trophy spam, but thank heavens on Facebook
2420840	2425720	you can easily block it and it won't upgrade you to timeline.
2425720	2429440	So, well, upgrade you to timeline.
2429440	2430440	Yeah.
2430440	2431960	Like all these apps want to upgrade you to timeline now.
2431960	2434120	Like you try to use Hulu or Pinterest.
2434120	2438920	It's all, you can install this app, but it'll upgrade you to timeline the whole Facebook
2438920	2439920	timeline.
2439920	2440920	Horrible page.
2440920	2441920	I can't stand it.
2441920	2444080	I don't subscribe to anything anymore on Facebook.
2444080	2445080	Yeah.
2445080	2449040	I already see I was in timeline before I was in timeline back in September.
2449040	2450600	So you're already stuck with it.
2450600	2451600	I hate it.
2451600	2454720	I hate looking at those timeline pages like sums on the left and sums on the right.
2454720	2455720	It's weird.
2455720	2457560	I don't look at my page anymore though.
2457560	2459200	I only look at my feed.
2459200	2463320	So all right, let's move on with some actual gaming news.
2463320	2464320	Loki.
2464320	2467040	So Sony spending a lot of money to promote the Vita, which is kind of funny cause I've
2467040	2470060	yet to see any advertisements for the Vita.
2470060	2476640	So I don't know where this $50 million is going, but I'm assuming that they're gonna
2476640	2481160	start playing commercials after the system comes out, which is a little odd, but okay.
2481160	2489120	And there's a few commercials floating around, I guess, on the internet, but anyways, yeah,
2489120	2498440	part of it's of course the hashtag game changer on Twitter, which I mean, I don't know, whatever.
2498440	2502320	And they have hashtags for everything and like hashtags for people posting comments
2502320	2507840	during the Whitney Houston funeral, which my wife watched by the way, part of it at
2507840	2508840	least.
2508840	2512720	But yeah, I mean, they're used for everything.
2512720	2519160	So yeah, and of course, you know, there's the huge Twitter campaign and I'm assuming
2519160	2523280	lots of TV stuff, like probably like the PlayStation 3 was.
2523280	2524280	So it'll be interesting.
2524280	2526880	They're definitely working that out.
2526880	2532760	And then of course, you know, like some of the first party PlayStation 3 titles, the
2532760	2538240	PlayStation passes are making their way to the Vita as well.
2538240	2544280	Two games that launched that do have an online pass would be Hotshots Golf World Invitational
2544280	2546320	and Wipeout 2048.
2546320	2549240	Why those titles are the only ones that have online passes?
2549240	2553320	Those are the only ones with actually online multiplayer simultaneous.
2553320	2559140	Note, ModNation Racers does not have simultaneous multiplayer.
2559140	2565460	They have this fancy term called asynchronous multiplayer, which means you download someone's
2565460	2567840	ghost run and you race against that.
2567840	2569760	There is no multiplayer in that game.
2569760	2573880	AlphaKananagram in our chatroom says, I've seen ads for the Vita for the US.
2573880	2574880	They suck.
2574880	2580360	Also, one of the US commercials shows 3G gaming when you can't game on 3G.
2580360	2582460	You can.
2582460	2585740	You can game, but you can't game over 3G.
2585740	2589280	Maybe it's showing up on things like maybe it's playing on ESPN or something you don't
2589280	2590280	really watch.
2590280	2591520	Maybe that's where the commercials are.
2591520	2594720	I don't watch a lot of TV either, so it's possible.
2594720	2597040	But I mean, I don't know.
2597040	2601720	I was watching Comedy Central the other day, and I didn't see anything.
2601720	2604400	But then again, I don't watch a lot of TV, so maybe.
2604400	2608080	AlphaKananagram in our chatroom continued to chat that OrangeLaunchRadio.com saying,
2608080	2612080	also, I heard another one showed someone playing it outside with good screen quality, but I
2612080	2616480	think screen can't do that in sunlight IRL, so it's sort of false advertising.
2616480	2617680	How does that thing react in sunlight?
2617680	2618680	I don't know.
2618680	2619680	I haven't played it outside.
2619680	2620680	Go outside!
2620680	2621680	Yeah.
2621680	2624160	There's a whole world out there.
2624160	2625160	There's air.
2625160	2627920	I don't have a vitamin D deficiency.
2627920	2630400	I was outside most of the day today.
2630400	2633120	I just didn't take my game system with me to go walk around.
2633120	2634120	Yeah.
2634120	2635120	See, that was a great thing.
2635120	2638720	They had somebody like walking around in an urban environment, probably New York City
2638720	2643280	or something like that, you know, looking down at the screen playing the Vita, waiting
2643280	2648760	for that guy to get hit by a cab as he crosses the street because some fucking idiot walking
2648760	2653960	around playing a game, you know, looking down, it's just stupid.
2653960	2657080	I could see myself walking outside, taking a walk around the lake, I just fall right
2657080	2658080	in.
2658080	2665440	The other thing I do like about the Vita is the fact that you can actually type on the
2665440	2674480	screen, you know, whereas before you did the crazy, you know, pre-touchscreen era analog,
2674480	2680680	you know, yeah, it's not fun to type on the old PSPs, but, uh, Wipeout!
2680680	2681680	Does PSP have auto-correct?
2681680	2688760	Uh, PSV, excuse me, has suggestions, so you can, you can quickly, uh, tap, so just like
2688760	2695080	PS3 kinda has that, yeah, yeah, um, I do kinda wanna try Wipeout, but I got frustrated the
2695080	2700400	first Wipeout game, it's just not, not my thing, a little, a little too fast and just
2700400	2701400	kind of weird.
2701400	2707200	I want a more traditional racing game, I guess, but, uh, we'll see.
2707200	2711320	And as I mentioned before, Ridge Racer did not make it at launch, it got delayed.
2711320	2712320	Ooh!
2712320	2717640	Oh, and one other thing, um, of course, Super Stardust Delta is gonna be the free 3G Vita
2717640	2719200	game that you get at launch.
2719200	2722920	Not a big surprise since, for, well, pretty much everything up until launch, it was the
2722920	2728160	only 3, only, uh, you know, PlayStation Network download, except they added, you know, the
2728160	2731760	escape plan stuff now and there's gonna be some other stuff coming out later on.
2731760	2739080	Um, and that is, there's a lot of ifs and ands and, you know, uh, asterisks and stuff
2739080	2740080	like that.
2740080	2747400	So basically, you need to, um, sign up with AT&T, not necessarily sign up, but you need
2747400	2756560	to activate your 3G, um, and then I believe the way it works is, um, you pay for a month
2756560	2765640	of 3G, so 250 megs, $15, and then you get a free month of 3G, um, and then once you've
2765640	2769520	done that, you also get Super Stardust Delta for free.
2769520	2775840	And I think it also, um, that's so, that's so low in my opinion, it really strikes me
2775840	2780120	as false advertising, because it's like you're not really getting, you know, because on Amazon
2780120	2785020	it said you get, you get a free network game or whatever, but it's not really free.
2785020	2787460	It's free when you pay for the 3G.
2787460	2788800	Free when you pay more money.
2788800	2792960	It's that whole, that's what somebody just criticized me of saying on PlayStation Plus
2792960	2793960	earlier.
2793960	2797800	And here's the thing about the 3G too, is they will auto renew, um, you know, if you
2797800	2804200	don't cancel it, so that kind of sucks, um, and oh, oh, and I guess it's Super Stardust
2804200	2811240	Delta plus the Blast Pack DLC for free, yeah, the Blast Pack DLC for Super Stardust Delta,
2811240	2817840	which was a pay to unlock thing, for a download game, a pay to unlock thing, another $8 on
2817840	2825000	top of like, the, what is it, $10 or $15 that that costs, just like, come on.
2825000	2826000	Yeah.
2826000	2830640	All right, well, moving on to more Vita news, and this is something that will make Loki
2830640	2835200	very happy, I'm sure, uh, it has been announced that Call of Duty will be coming out on the
2835200	2836200	Vita this fall.
2836200	2837200	Duh.
2837200	2841160	I know, this is really a duh, but it's, it's, because, right, don't, doesn't Call of Duty
2841160	2844760	come out on the frickin' like, Game Boy Color still?
2844760	2846640	They had it on, they poured it everywhere.
2846640	2848000	They had it on the DS.
2848000	2849000	I'm sure they did.
2849000	2852920	I don't know if there was one, no, there was one last year for Modern Warfare 3 on the
2852920	2853920	DS.
2853920	2857680	Of course it's coming out on the Vita, but it is still notable, because obviously this
2857680	2862320	is a huge franchise, and even though it's one I don't usually talk about, it is still
2862320	2863640	a huge selling franchise.
2863640	2866680	I think it would be a system seller, to be honest, for the Vita.
2866680	2867680	You think it's gonna be that good?
2867680	2869920	You don't think it'll just be a port of another title?
2869920	2875520	Um, it may be a port of, um, I think it's gonna be a port of the game that they're gonna
2875520	2880440	be putting out this year, but, I mean, the games look great on there, and if they can
2880440	2883960	get the controls right, which, I mean, it's got most of the controls of a Playstation
2883960	2890920	3, aside from missing the L3, R3, and, you know, L2, R2, but, um, you can kinda work
2890920	2893400	that stuff in, you know, with the touch screen, maybe.
2893400	2897260	Let me get to the exact quote about this release, uh, this is from Vice President Guy Longworth
2897260	2900840	in an interview with Game Trailers, saying, quote, in the autumn, they're really looking
2900840	2904760	forward to Call of Duty on Vita, and we think that's going to be an absolute game changer
2904760	2906760	for the platform.
2906760	2908720	Interesting way of phrasing that.
2908720	2911160	Nice to work in the hashtag in there for their Twitter cam.
2911160	2913600	I think it's gonna be a game changer.
2913600	2918280	Oh, is that, uh, I didn't realize that was a whole tie-in to some weird marketing thing.
2918280	2919280	Eh.
2919280	2920720	But yeah, I think it'll do well.
2920720	2925680	I mean, they'll probably have Call of Duty on the 3DS this year.
2925680	2931480	Well, if it's a unique Vita game with features kinda unique to the system, I'm sure there'll
2931480	2936120	be an audience for it, but I would think it's just gonna be a port, kinda like the DS games
2936120	2937120	are.
2937120	2941480	The DS games are completely different, I mean, that's really limited as far as the system
2941480	2942480	goes.
2942480	2947120	They've had Call of Duty's like really old Call of Duty's on the PSP, but even that was
2947120	2949760	kinda limited because you didn't have a second analog stick and stuff.
2949760	2953760	This I think is gonna be more along the lines of an actual Call of Duty game, and it would
2953760	2958280	be cool if they had like cross-play with like the PS3 and stuff, you could do that.
2958280	2962820	That could be the game changer right there.
2962820	2965360	Play with the PC and the PS3.
2965360	2967360	Alright.
2967360	2971000	DarkSakura, what do you got for us in the news?
2971000	2974600	Sorry, I was describing a bottle of wine.
2974600	2976560	Talking to liquor with our chatters.
2976560	2979240	And my windows have frozen.
2979240	2980760	Oh noes.
2980760	2983200	Deselect motherfucker.
2983200	2984200	Stop it.
2984200	2986520	What kind of laptop should our users not be buying?
2986520	2988520	Hold on.
2988520	2989520	Netbook.
2989520	2990520	Netbook.
2990520	2992760	I guess there's a difference, huh?
2992760	2993760	Or is the mouse dying?
2993760	2995840	No, it's not my mouse.
2995840	3001880	What happens is that it's selected text, and it's not deselecting the text so that I can
3001880	3004700	get to my other window.
3004700	3012480	So yeah, Capcom had another spelling problem on a, what's the Azure watch?
3012480	3013480	Is that the game?
3013480	3014480	Azure's Wrath.
3014480	3015480	Azure's Wrath.
3015480	3016480	Azure's Wrath.
3016480	3017480	Azure's Wrath.
3017480	3018480	Whatever.
3018480	3019480	Yeah, it's Chanelgers.
3019480	3020480	Chanelingers.
3020480	3021480	Chanlingers.
3021480	3022480	Chanlingers.
3022480	3023480	Chanlingers.
3023480	3024480	Chanlingers.
3024480	3025480	Chanlingers.
3025480	3028860	It's apparently even more fail than it was before.
3028860	3030800	So yeah, Capcom's still misspelling words.
3030800	3039040	They really need to get things correct with their, you know, finally I can get to the
3039040	3040040	damn thing.
3040040	3042400	Now that you recalled it from memory, yes.
3042400	3046120	They really need to get their QA really down.
3046120	3050220	Either that or not let the Japanese team do the boxes.
3050220	3054820	Or they need to just invest in Microsoft Word and the little red underline that appears
3054820	3057240	when you spell a word wrong.
3057240	3058560	Because these aren't done in Word.
3058560	3061360	I'm not a designer, but couldn't illustrator or whatever.
3061360	3064080	I have the solution to all of Capcom's problems.
3064080	3065080	Hire me.
3065080	3070080	This shit doesn't happen on anything that I make.
3070080	3071320	Hire me.
3071320	3073400	You should send in a resume.
3073400	3074400	P.S.
3074400	3076920	I don't screw up on the covers to video games.
3076920	3080680	You should make a little YouTube and we can try and get it to go viral and send it to
3080680	3081680	Capcom.
3081680	3082680	Do you want to?
3082680	3083680	I will help you make one if you want.
3083680	3084680	Five.
3084680	3085680	All right.
3085680	3086680	New project for OLR.
3086680	3087680	Get Jamie a job.
3087680	3090920	Unlike your application for the tester, you need to actually go through with this one.
3090920	3093480	You need to actually make, well, I didn't make my video for the tester.
3093480	3094480	That's the only thing I didn't do.
3094480	3097840	And it's just like sort of, I was sort of like, I don't want to move.
3097840	3098840	It's really it.
3098840	3101880	It's like, I don't want to go to LA, but I don't like LA.
3101880	3102880	Capcom's in the Bay, right?
3102880	3103880	They have a big office in the Bay.
3103880	3104880	I think so.
3104880	3105880	I think they do.
3105880	3106880	Santa Clara.
3106880	3109200	Which I would totally telecommute for that.
3109200	3111200	There you go.
3111200	3112600	I would absolutely telecommute.
3112600	3113600	All right.
3113600	3114600	And you, and no spelling mistakes.
3114600	3115600	No spelling mistakes.
3115600	3119280	T E L E C O M M U T E.
3119280	3123440	If anyone from Capcom is listening, remember the dark soccer is a real bitch when it comes
3123440	3125440	to grammar and spelling.
3125440	3126440	I am.
3126440	3127840	You've heard the mailbag segment on this show.
3127840	3129320	She's ruthless.
3129320	3130560	I have no Ruth.
3130560	3132560	None at all.
3132560	3133760	No Ruth anywhere near me.
3133760	3134760	Well, let's be honest.
3134760	3137080	Most people wouldn't notice that that's misspelled anyways.
3137080	3140120	Someone had to it for them to have posted it on.
3140120	3141120	That's pretty bad.
3141120	3142120	You're a gamer.
3142120	3147280	Some people, but I mean, after reading the many forums out there and the level, the level
3147280	3150280	of spelling that is accepted nowadays.
3150280	3151280	Chan-linges.
3151280	3152720	They don't notice.
3152720	3153720	Okay.
3153720	3154720	Seriously.
3154720	3155720	Oh, it's text speak.
3155720	3156720	Chan-linges is text speak.
3156720	3157720	No, it's not even that.
3157720	3158920	It's an extra freaking letter.
3158920	3161920	When I get, when I get my Vita next week, I'm going to send Loki a text message that
3161920	3164600	says I Chan-linge you to a duel in luminous.
3164600	3165600	I spell it.
3165600	3166600	Maybe it's a friend's reference.
3166600	3168760	Maybe it's a friend's reference.
3168760	3176480	It's spelled C H A N L L E N G E S. That's an extra N. Someone got crazy typing fingers
3176480	3178480	and spelled it wrong.
3178480	3182760	And Capcom's like, no one cares for these who maybe they're a fan of Chandler.
3182760	3186200	And so, you know, but there's no D in there to make it Chandler.
3186200	3189880	So your argument is in value is in value is invalid.
3189880	3191440	You just got fired from Capcom.
3191440	3195640	Way to go, listen to me.
3195640	3199600	First of all, I don't normally speak like this when I am at my job.
3199600	3202480	So you can rely on me to be professional.
3202480	3204940	Shut up, Rob.
3204940	3212320	I am a great up and coming designer and I will work for 20 bucks an hour, which is cheaper
3212320	3213680	than a lot of designers will charge you.
3213680	3215880	I'll work for $19 an hour.
3215880	3217280	You can't design shit.
3217280	3218280	Okay.
3218280	3219280	I can't design shit.
3219280	3221360	I can out design anything.
3221360	3224440	To his credit, he did make O L I N S P dot com, which was pretty kick out.
3224440	3228240	I mean that, that was, that was something that like other people that weren't even into
3228240	3232360	video games were looking at us like, wow, this is a great PSP like base.
3232360	3234640	Now I can't a very good job.
3234640	3240320	Now I can't promise that I will continue to update sites, but I can design it the first
3240320	3241320	time.
3241320	3242320	Okay.
3242320	3243320	What is, what is CMYK?
3243320	3248600	Here's CMYNK it's cyan, yellow, magenta, black, except you got the wrong order.
3248600	3249600	I don't give a crap.
3249600	3251480	You asked what it was, what's an ink limit.
3251480	3252480	Shut up.
3252480	3253480	You two both.
3253480	3254480	What's that game?
3254480	3255480	Okay.
3255480	3258360	Here's, here's, I'm just giving you a hard time.
3258360	3260320	Here's the difference between Loki, the designer and dark soccer.
3260320	3263280	The designer Loki is a man in dark soccer as a woman.
3263280	3266360	Therefore Loki starts projects and never finishes them.
3266360	3269040	Then again, you've started a lot of projects that you don't please.
3269040	3271000	Hey, I'm finishing a lot of stuff.
3271000	3272680	I've just keep starting something too.
3272680	3278840	Except my, except I just got paid for my, some of my work, which is, which is good.
3278840	3280560	Being paid for doing design is good.
3280560	3285680	I, it's funny cause I had another idea to start some more projects, but whatever, whatever
3285680	3288600	happened to olrwee.com, whatever happened to that.
3288600	3292080	Brad from Pod Culture says, um, Capcom where spell check doesn't exist.
3292080	3296440	I'll tell you what happened to that is that no one uses the Wii web browser, so that's
3296440	3297960	what happened to that.
3297960	3303840	And tiger claw people would not get all F's because I would just beat them in the face
3303840	3308480	and I would, I would expel anybody, I would expel anybody from my class.
3308480	3315320	It got less than a C. All right, I just wouldn't have class moving on more news, less bickering
3315320	3319240	Loki and you know, tiger claw, I know that you say that anything with spelling errors
3319240	3324320	is going to be a collector's item, but not when they're, when you put out there widespread,
3324320	3327320	what's also really easy to print fakes.
3327320	3330840	I would think, I mean somebody like dark soccer could probably spot a fake.
3330840	3336120	I have, I have to, I have to point out something just for the chat room to clarify.
3336120	3338080	Loki's got natural design talent.
3338080	3345920	If he were, had the schooling to go behind it, he'd be out there making bank.
3345920	3351560	And I will say this offhand, a lot of talent just needs to know how to use the other software
3351560	3353440	that we all have to know how to use.
3353440	3354940	Now you want to know what's hilarious.
3354940	3359920	I have no design talent whatsoever and yet I actually did do design for a short time
3359920	3361560	before I was in insurance.
3361560	3363720	I'll tell you, I'll tell you this too.
3363720	3364800	Isn't that ironic?
3364800	3370400	I um, I just got done, well not just got done, but I read the biography of Joe Simon, who's
3370400	3374200	one of the guys that created Captain America and he was talking about back in the day that
3374200	3381000	it was just natural talent and honing your own talent and he got jobs as designers doing
3381000	3387980	photo touch ups, you know, in the, you know, depression era, but he, you know, back then
3387980	3389960	it was all, what's your raw talent?
3389960	3391040	Can you do this?
3391040	3392420	Do you know how to use the software?
3392420	3395720	And now it's like, they require so much more education.
3395720	3398300	They don't care how well you know how to use everything.
3398300	3401020	They want you to have the degree that says you know how to use it, which doesn't always
3401020	3402280	mean you know how to do shit.
3402280	3405560	Not everybody though, because I will tell you that the publisher I used to work for
3405560	3409780	was very much, you know what, to me, work experience is very, very valuable.
3409780	3412720	So you know, I'll just, I'll just say that there are some, tell that to the places I've
3412720	3413720	been applying at.
3413720	3414960	Some smart publishers out there.
3414960	3419400	Anyhow, um, quickly coming from our chat room, JV Mon in our chat room at chat.onwinsocialmedia.com
3419400	3422300	says, ugh, the Wii browser is terra bad.
3422300	3424840	It's faster using AOL dial up.
3424840	3425840	Yikes.
3425840	3431880	Well, the problem is like no one's really using that anymore.
3431880	3433840	No one's really using the PSP web browser anymore.
3433840	3436820	I mean, there's a few people that are, but you're in the minority.
3436820	3442280	Most everyone's using, you know, some sort of web browser on your phone, on your iPod,
3442280	3443820	iPad, something like that.
3443820	3449200	So to make a site dedicated to like the PSP or even the PlayStation V. And to be honest,
3449200	3453500	you don't really need a website dedicated to the PlayStation Vita because hell, I pulled
3453500	3454500	up our site on there.
3454500	3455500	It looks great.
3455500	3460960	I mean, any website looks great on as long as you don't put flash in there, you know,
3460960	3462640	which God, my, my God.
3462640	3463640	Okay.
3463640	3468280	Why can't they put HTML five in a web browser on this stupid device and why can't they do
3468280	3469280	that?
3469280	3470280	Is it slow?
3470280	3471280	Maybe.
3471280	3472280	I don't know.
3472280	3475480	Slows down memory loss, but it is from what I understand quite a bit more efficient than
3475480	3480320	flashes lately, unless you're just fully putting full animation in something you don't need
3480320	3483680	to have, have flash.
3483680	3485360	So I don't, I don't get it.
3485360	3486640	I can do flash.
3486640	3488880	I don't like flash.
3488880	3490360	I would rather do it in HTML.
3490360	3492520	All right, let's move on Loki.
3492520	3493720	All right.
3493720	3497720	Let's talk a little bit about, um, Nintendo.
3497720	3502900	And uh, this is kind of neat and see I'm have a few speculations on what this could mean,
3502900	3508100	but Nintendo has acquired a video research and a kind of like a video middleware company
3508100	3510480	called Moby Clip.
3510480	3517640	And Moby Clip, uh, mainly they were kind of focused on, uh, video compression for Game
3517640	3520360	Boy Advance DS and 3DS games.
3520360	3524360	Now what I'm thinking this could be used for is a few things.
3524360	3532360	Either A, they're gonna, you know, do some more video streaming stuff to the 3DS or B,
3532360	3537960	it's for working on the Wii U and getting that, you know, video data compressed enough
3537960	3544360	to where they can stream either a higher resolution or something like that to the Wii U's tablet.
3544360	3545360	That's a really good thought.
3545360	3549440	I was actually going in the direction of those, um, movies on the cartridge, you know, uh,
3549440	3552200	for the 3DS because we still don't have the 3D movies.
3552200	3557680	I'm kind of curious if anyone's picked up Tekken, um, Tekken Prime 3D Edition or whatever,
3557680	3564240	or Tekken 3D Prime Edition, um, and how that 3D movie looks on the 3DS would be kind of
3564240	3565240	interesting.
3565240	3566240	I have not.
3566240	3567240	Anybody in chat maybe?
3567240	3568240	We'll see.
3568240	3569240	So.
3569240	3574760	Um, so, I mean, Nintendo was already working with this company anyway, right?
3574760	3578200	So this whole acquisition isn't like gonna change the world, right?
3578200	3579200	No, it's not.
3579200	3581560	It's pro- why would you just bring them in under your wing?
3581560	3584220	Cause you plan on using them a lot, right?
3584220	3589200	They have something that you want and that you don't want anyone else to have.
3589200	3592920	Like, for example, if you think about it, this company say they, they did find a way
3592920	3600880	to a really good algorithm or, you know, some sort of tool that can compress stuff and do
3600880	3604600	like high definition video or, you know, really good video.
3604600	3609000	And for this type of application, they don't want the Vita PS3 having that same technology.
3609000	3614160	They don't want the PS3 pad or the Xbox, you know, tablet thing or whatever they have.
3614160	3615160	If that turns out to be true.
3615160	3616160	Yeah.
3616160	3618320	I mean, they don't want them coming up with something like that and using that kind of
3618320	3619320	technology.
3619320	3621440	For example, same thing with the Kinect.
3621440	3625480	Remember that company that developed the Kinect, Microsoft bought them because they don't want
3625480	3627120	anyone else developing their own Kinect.
3627120	3628120	Oh, that's true.
3628120	3629120	Okay.
3629120	3630120	That makes sense.
3630120	3631120	Yeah.
3631120	3632120	So maybe, maybe they cracked the case.
3632120	3633120	Who knows?
3633120	3634560	But this, this acquisition actually happened a while ago.
3634560	3636560	We're just now seeing the papers filed on it.
3636560	3637560	Yes.
3637560	3638560	That makes it complete.
3638560	3639560	It was back in October.
3639560	3640560	Interesting.
3640560	3641560	All right.
3641560	3644840	So for that gamer, I have some news for you, both of you out there.
3644840	3645840	No, I'm just kidding.
3645840	3646840	I'm kidding.
3646840	3647840	Don't send the hate mail in.
3647840	3653520	Uh, there is some new gaming related stuff coming to OS X Mountain Lion in the way of
3653520	3654520	Game Center.
3654520	3658960	Uh, Game Center is kind of, I don't know, not really there.
3658960	3661000	I mean, yes, it's on the iPhone.
3661000	3663440	You have achievements or what do they call it?
3663440	3666680	Is it just achievements on the iPhone Game Center, iOS?
3666680	3670580	I can't remember, but you do have those, you know, things that you can earn on there and
3670580	3673160	kind of see what your friends are playing and all that, but it doesn't really do that
3673160	3674280	much else.
3674280	3679160	But it is coming, uh, to OS X, uh, with the Mountain Lion update.
3679160	3683280	Uh, apparently it will add some new stuff though.
3683280	3687520	I didn't even know this was in there, but voice chat will make its way.
3687520	3691320	I didn't think that was already in Game Center, but some are saying it is.
3691320	3692320	I didn't think voice chat was.
3692320	3693320	I don't think so.
3693320	3694960	I thought, I didn't know that was there.
3694960	3698480	But it would make, it would make sense if it can kind of interface with the Mac that
3698480	3699480	way.
3699480	3702200	I don't see where they're, why they're doing that because they're trying to, you know,
3702200	3705600	tie in the stuff that's popular on iOS devices into the Mac.
3705600	3711520	Just like say FaceTime, you know, one of the, uh, hideously underused feature of the iOS
3711520	3712520	device.
3712520	3713520	That's awesome.
3713520	3719600	Uh, but you can, you know, kind of cross do that between the iPhone, iPad and the Mac.
3719600	3723800	I think the only reason why people don't use FaceTime is because they're Skype and people
3723800	3725680	use Skype a lot more.
3725680	3726680	On the computer.
3726680	3727680	Yeah.
3727680	3728680	But I like having a phone.
3728680	3730640	There's only only one person that ever Skypes with me.
3730640	3734200	I have a friend in the Bay Area and once in a while she buys something really funny that
3734200	3736880	she wants to like literally show me, so she'll FaceTime me.
3736880	3740820	But otherwise I think FaceTime's biggest drawback is that it doesn't work on 3G.
3740820	3743820	I know there's competitors out there that do work on 3G.
3743820	3747160	I'm aware of that, but Intel Apple kind of officially endorses it.
3747160	3750960	Um, I think that's one of its biggest kind of drawbacks and maybe they're worried about
3750960	3751960	the quality.
3751960	3752960	I don't know, but you're right.
3752960	3756840	Skype will do 3G, but Skype isn't integrated into the fricking phone.
3756840	3758880	You have to download it separately and not everybody does that.
3758880	3763960	You can do it on 3G, but you have to have it jailbroken before you can do that.
3763960	3767440	So well, again, not something that's integrated into it normally.
3767440	3768440	Yeah.
3768440	3772600	So, uh, Black Wolf in our chat room, of course, the man before us at All Games Radio says
3772600	3777320	there are voice chat APIs available to iOS developers as part of game kit.
3777320	3780760	Not many people implement it though, so I guess, I guess, I don't know.
3780760	3783040	It's just not the same type of gaming on the iPhone.
3783040	3786200	Like who would you talk to playing Angry Birds?
3786200	3787640	Well, Angry Birds isn't really-
3787640	3789080	I talk to Angry Birds.
3789080	3790080	I could think maybe-
3790080	3791920	I go, I hate this game!
3791920	3793920	Every time I play it, so.
3793920	3798660	There's a lot of games though, I don't think there's a lot that you play at the same time.
3798660	3803080	Like Words With Friends and stuff like that, it's usually, okay, I'm gonna do my move now
3803080	3805080	and that's it.
3805080	3806600	You just kind of play it on your own time.
3806600	3810400	It's not like, okay, hey, pop out your phone right now, we're gonna play a game of whatever,
3810400	3811400	you know?
3811400	3812400	Right, right.
3812400	3813640	Alright, let's move on.
3813640	3817680	Three states coming up very soon after one more story, DarkSakura.
3817680	3818680	Mantis.
3818680	3820960	Sorry, that's not the story.
3820960	3821960	No.
3821960	3826320	I just found something that was more, that was worse than the frilly dog panties.
3826320	3827320	Mantis.
3827320	3828320	Dear God.
3828320	3829320	What?
3829320	3830320	Mantis are worse than frilly dog panties.
3830320	3833000	We've had this discussion on the show before and I don't want to have it again.
3833000	3836600	So how about something that has absolutely nothing to do with mantis?
3836600	3837600	Please.
3837600	3839600	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!
3839600	3840600	Yay!
3840600	3844720	Heroes and a Manti.
3844720	3846760	Now I'm picturing Michelangelo and a Manti.
3846760	3847760	Don't picture that.
3847760	3850440	I'm gonna have to draw that.
3850440	3851440	No!
3851440	3852960	No, you don't draw that.
3852960	3855520	This is not deviant art.
3855520	3857280	This isn't 4chan.
3857280	3858280	That would be hilarious.
3858280	3862940	Anyway, um, it was actually spotted by Ninja Pizza.
3862940	3869400	There was a poster that was displayed at Toy Fair 2012 that showed a list of activity around
3869400	3874720	the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon series and at the bottom it says cross promotions
3874720	3880720	with key licenses including IDW comic book publisher and Activision.
3880720	3886640	So it could possibly be that Activision is doing a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game.
3886640	3888280	Who knows?
3888280	3892400	They haven't been attached with them before but maybe they will.
3892400	3896520	I like the last one that came up was that horrible Wii game.
3896520	3898080	And Ubisoft do that or something?
3898080	3900040	Yeah, it was another company had it at the time.
3900040	3903800	Yeah, it was published by Ubisoft and then before that was Konami.
3903800	3905200	Well technically there was two Wii games.
3905200	3909160	There was one for the movie, the TMNT thing, then there was also the one that was like
3909160	3910160	Smash Brothers.
3910160	3913920	Yeah, I'm talking about Smash Up.
3913920	3917260	You know how many times that they freaking rebooted the Ninja Turtles?
3917260	3918260	You know what I want them to do?
3918260	3919260	Huh?
3919260	3921880	I want them to go back to the original Ninja Turtles, you know, the ones that were all
3921880	3927560	black and white or the only color they wore was red, and do like a big RPG based off the
3927560	3928560	original Turtles.
3928560	3930700	I want a music game with the Ninja Rap.
3930700	3934680	Go Ninja, go Ninja, go.
3934680	3936440	Come on, it'd be awesome.
3936440	3940840	I had, okay, this, honestly, I had no idea they were doing yet another new cartoon.
3940840	3942280	Like, I was like, really?
3942280	3943280	There's another one?
3943280	3947560	Well, like, the last one that I remembered watching, they had done, okay, they had done
3947560	3952200	like the one that was on in the late 80s and early 90s that, you know, I was watching as
3952200	3955500	a young teenager and my brothers were watching as kids.
3955500	3960160	And then they did another one for a while that was supposed to be pretty much a little
3960160	3962560	bit, you know, a little bit more on the hardcore side.
3962560	3966720	And then, um, the last thing that I watched actually was from that series where they went
3966720	3973720	back into their other universes, and they went back with the original Turtle universe,
3973720	3976600	and they were all like, you guys are bitches.
3976600	3978840	So this is all CGI, it looks like, Tiger Claw Link.
3978840	3981880	It doesn't look like very good CGI either.
3981880	3983020	Was that like Dun and Poser?
3983020	3984020	You know what, though?
3984020	3989200	This, um, could, this looks like it could be easily be a video game.
3989200	3992940	With the technology we have today, I could be looking at screenshots from a video game.
3992940	3994400	I would not know the difference.
3994400	3995400	To be real.
3995400	4000480	That looks like really, I hope those are just preliminary shots because those textures are
4000480	4001480	just horrendous.
4001480	4005440	Maybe it's, well, keep in mind, I think these are pictures of posters, so you're probably
4005440	4006440	losing some detail.
4006440	4008760	I don't think I'm losing anything.
4008760	4014480	But, um, maybe it's all Mashima is what it comes down to.
4014480	4021560	Well at any rate, at any rate, you know, I've, it better be, I just really don't have a whole
4021560	4024640	lot of faith in it being much better.
4024640	4030320	Well, um, one interesting kind of tie in, because you were talking about kind of the
4030320	4034560	license through the days and how Konami had it and, you know, I guess Ubisoft may not
4034560	4041200	have it now looking at this story, but, um, the eight bit Ninja Turtle game that's on
4041200	4044640	virtual console right now is getting pulled or got pulled.
4044640	4048080	I think it's getting pulled soon because it sucks.
4048080	4051680	I like the original game, but that's, I like the arcade game.
4051680	4053520	That's one of those games I see through rose colored glasses.
4053520	4056200	It was awesome when you're nine, but now it's probably crap.
4056200	4057200	Okay.
4057200	4058200	Do the water level without cursing.
4058200	4061200	You know what I'm talking about?
4061200	4067320	Rocket seaweed, but that game is no longer going to be on virtual console.
4067320	4068320	Good.
4068320	4071760	You know, actually, you know, it's funny, you know what virtual console did get this
4071760	4072760	week?
4072760	4076660	Finally, finally, after years and years, it's like the first virtual console game to come
4076660	4078240	out in like nine months.
4078240	4081360	You know what game they got Genesis game?
4081360	4082360	Strider.
4082360	4083360	Yes, that's right.
4083360	4087340	Cause Dan was talking about it and I'm like, you don't need another version of Strider.
4087340	4090240	You really don't need another version of Strider.
4090240	4091880	You already have that version of Strider.
4091880	4093280	We do have that version of Strider.
4093280	4094840	I have beaten that version of Strider.
4094840	4097320	I have not beaten it in the arcade, but I've beaten the Genesis one.
4097320	4100280	All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and what's coming
4100280	4101800	out to a game store near you.
4101800	4105560	Gee, I wonder, I wonder what could be dominating the US releases this week.
4105560	4106560	Loki.
4106560	4108680	Not as many as you would think because most of them will last week.
4108680	4117600	So now this week we've got a Metal Gear Solid 3D Snake Eater on the 3DS of course.
4117600	4123680	We've got Shinobido to Revenge of Zen, which is basically by the guys that do Tenchu.
4123680	4125120	And that's on the Vita.
4125120	4128680	Touch My Katamari on the Vita this week as well.
4128680	4132240	Prevolution Soccer 2012 on the 3DS.
4132240	4137240	Syndicate on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
4137240	4141680	Asura's Wrath on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.
4141680	4143080	Some more Vita titles.
4143080	4146280	Army Corps of Hell on the Vita.
4146280	4152320	Dynasty Warriors Next, Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus on the Vita, of course the Vita system.
4152320	4157400	Both the 3G and the Wi-Fi only version are launching this week as well.
4157400	4163960	Poke Park 2 on the Wii and that's it.
4163960	4167200	All right then let's look at Japan and some of the games coming out in Japan this week.
4167200	4169360	On the Xbox 360, Asura's Wrath.
4169360	4173600	Now no telling if the spelling is wrong in Japanese as well, but it's coming out there
4173600	4175280	so you can let us know.
4175280	4178000	Entaku no Saito, Students of Round.
4178000	4181040	I think that's a price reduction on an existing game.
4181040	4186320	Naruto Shippuden, Narutamite Storm Generation comes out on the 360 this week as well as
4186320	4189840	Darkness 2, and Under Defeat HD.
4189840	4193760	I haven't heard of Under Defeat, it looks like a helicopter game, so kind of like a
4193760	4196200	shooter game on the 360.
4196200	4199260	Going over to the Playstation 3 and checking out what's coming out there.
4199260	4203800	Some of the same stuff, Asura's Wrath there as well, Naruto Shippuden, but some other
4203800	4209400	different games, Galgun comes out in regular and limited flavors this week on the Playstation
4209400	4211200	3.
4211200	4217520	This is the whole, I think shooting pheromones gun, yeah isn't this the whole like making
4217520	4221320	teenage girls fall in love with you by, I think you're fighting them off or something
4221320	4225580	I don't really know what the storyline was but it was it's an on-rails shooter game that
4225580	4231080	uses the Playstation Move controller, let's just say it's not coming out here in the States.
4231080	4237720	But thanks to the region free ability of the Playstation 3, it can be yours if you so wish.
4237720	4243520	Alright, let's see also, totally importing, Fight Night Champion getting a prize reduction.
4243520	4247760	It's actually not that bad of a game, I like the Xbox 360 one, I thought it was fun.
4247760	4253800	Shinken de Watashi no Koi Shinasi R comes out this week on the Playstation 3.
4253800	4257560	This is labeled as an adventure game, it looks like yet another one of those games that's
4257560	4262920	heavy on the dialogue and kind of like simulator games.
4262920	4266240	But it doesn't look like a dating game, it looks like kind of something else, but I don't
4266240	4271200	see any like action screenshots, just all like talking and anime clip scenes and all
4271200	4272200	that.
4272200	4273200	So these...
4273200	4274200	And leaning over with a big bust.
4274200	4276440	Yes, of course, of course.
4276440	4278760	Gotta emphasize dem boobies.
4278760	4280880	Lots of stuff on the Playstation 3 this week.
4280880	4289680	Shadow Master, volume 5, Under Defeat, also on the PS3, Darkness 2, and Tachishio Love
4289680	4292040	Application.
4292040	4295240	I'll just let you decide what that game's all about.
4295240	4297320	Applicate your love.
4297320	4302360	On the Vita this week in Japan, At Field, Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus, and Little Busters
4302360	4310200	Converted Edition come out on the Playstation Vita this week, and quickly checking the 3DS.
4310200	4316200	Bokuju Monogatari Hajimari no Daichi comes out this week from Marvelous on the 3DS.
4316200	4321040	I'm trying to see if this is a version of a game we have here.
4321040	4323760	It looks kind of...
4323760	4329840	God damn it, what's that farming game from Natsume?
4329840	4330840	Harvest Moon?
4330840	4334120	It looks Harvest Moon-y to me, because look, they're growing eggplants there and they're
4334120	4335120	harvesting chickens.
4335120	4337360	It's not Harvest Moon, but it's like a 3D version of that.
4337360	4338360	There's no cows.
4338360	4340160	Yeah, well, she's wearing a cow hat.
4340160	4343800	Nope, there's a cow right there, a cute little fat-ass cow right there.
4343800	4344800	Any sheep?
4344800	4345800	And a sheep.
4345800	4346800	Okay.
4346800	4347800	That is Harvest Moon.
4347800	4353280	This is like a Zynga-type Harvest Moon game coming out in Japan.
4353280	4354280	There you go.
4354280	4355280	That's it for Japanese.
4355280	4357080	It's not Harvest Moon, it's Harvest Noon.
4357080	4359280	You're saying it's Farmville then.
4359280	4361680	Basically, yeah, it's Farmville instead of Farmtown.
4361680	4366960	All right, anyhow, moving on, Dark Sakura, how about Across the Pond?
4366960	4370360	Just assume this is Vita, unless I say differently, okay?
4370360	4371360	Yes.
4371360	4372360	This is on the 22nd.
4372360	4376000	Army Corps of Hell, BlazBlue Continuum, Shift Extend, Dynasty Warriors.
4376000	4383600	Next, Escape Plan, Everybody's Goth, Gravity Rush, Hustle Kings, Little Deviants, Luminous
4383600	4389120	Electronic Symphony, ModRation Nature's... ModNation Rager's...
4389120	4390400	Back, back, back, back up, back up.
4390400	4392400	Did you say a game called Everybody's Goth?
4392400	4393400	Goth?
4393400	4395440	Oh, I thought she said Everybody's Goth.
4395440	4397920	I'm like, is this 1994?
4397920	4406360	Today on Goth Talk, we'll explore, has Hot Topic deceived us?
4406360	4408420	Have they abandoned us?
4408420	4413040	With always my co-host, Azraelibus Prince of Sorrow.
4413040	4416240	You know, I know it sounds like we're making fun, but seriously, that was my crowd in high
4416240	4417240	school, so whatever.
4417240	4418240	Yeah, same here.
4418240	4425640	ModNation Racer's Road Trip, MotorStormRC, Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus, the Vita itself,
4425640	4433520	Reality Fighters, Shinobido II, Revenge of Zen, oh, Shinobido, sorry, I was reading it
4433520	4434520	wrong.
4434520	4440800	Super Stardust Delta, Top Darts, Touch My Katamari Baby, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom
4440800	4446600	3, Uncharted Golden Abyss, Virtual Tennis 4, Wipeout 2048, and on the 24th, we have
4446600	4453960	Binary Domain on the 360 and PS3, and Hyperdimension Neptunia MK2 on PS3, Syndicate on the Xbox
4453960	4456840	360 and Playstation 3, The Last Story on Wii.
4456840	4460640	I'm surprised that they're getting Gravity Rush so early.
4460640	4466080	I may have to import that, if it's in English, which I would assume it is.
4466080	4467080	Mayhaps it may be.
4467080	4469000	Because it's not coming out over here until May.
4469000	4474620	Same day as Resistance, too, so that's a tough one.
4474620	4479640	By the way, completely off the record, well, not off, but having nothing to do with this,
4479640	4484200	I've decided to play through Mother 3, because I hate my life and I want to cry.
4484200	4485200	Have fun with that.
4485200	4486200	It's depressing.
4486200	4488360	Well, maybe you should be playing everybody's goth then.
4488360	4493040	I'm trying to imagine how that game would play.
4493040	4496280	You go around trying to convert the jocks and the cheerleaders.
4496280	4500320	No, you go around trying to avoid the jocks and the cheerleaders.
4500320	4502760	With your goth gun.
4502760	4505560	And yes, it fires bats.
4505560	4514680	And you have to raise the depression level of everyone around you, but maintaining that
4514680	4518300	you have a higher depression level than the rest of them, and being tragic.
4518300	4522760	And you get a cure bar, which basically will allow you to blast Robert Smith for a certain
4522760	4526040	amount of time, that will weaken the enemies.
4526040	4530360	At full blast, you play Fascination Street, you know, when it's very low, it plays Friday
4530360	4532520	I'm in Love.
4532520	4536200	You might get, like, there might be DLC that will change it to the Smiths, you know, or
4536200	4537200	something like that.
4537200	4538200	Yeah, that's what you do.
4538200	4539200	It should progress.
4539200	4541420	Like, the Smiths would be the ultimate in depression.
4541420	4544760	Or no, eventually you get to Bauhaus level.
4544760	4547320	Bella Lugosi is down.
4547320	4551440	Loki, save us.
4551440	4556980	So Sony, seeing that they have a great storyline in the Twisted Metal series, they are going
4556980	4563000	to be, or they have begun preparations for a Twisted Metal movie, which I gotta say,
4563000	4564120	that sounds pretty awesome.
4564120	4566400	Unfortunately it's probably getting pretty lame.
4566400	4570000	But you know, they kind of started that off a little early with the new Twisted Metal
4570000	4575520	game having live action cut scenes, and of course they're expecting to have the same
4575520	4582980	characters from the last Twisted Metal game in this actual movie as well, so neat.
4582980	4590560	It's being developed by, looks like Avi and Ari Arad, who I guess have worked with the
4590560	4602140	Spider-Man series, and yeah, and I guess they signed a deal with the writer and director
4602140	4610440	Brian Taylor, who he did the Crank movies, Jonah Hex, and the last Ghost Rider flick.
4610440	4613080	Well, that doesn't sound like it's gonna suck at all.
4613080	4615880	Well, at least we know he knows how to crash cars.
4615880	4618000	So he is good at crashing cars.
4618000	4619760	He's a car crashing expert.
4619760	4625760	It's too bad David Carradine didn't live long enough to see this.
4625760	4627400	That is too bad.
4627400	4629800	But he did live long enough for Kill Bill.
4629800	4634720	But hey, you know what, and I understand that he may not necessarily be part of the lore
4634720	4637860	for Twisted Metal.
4637860	4643040	There is still Sylvester Stallone, and he could probably come back as Machine Gun Joe.
4643040	4644040	That's true.
4644040	4645040	What's he doing these days?
4645040	4646040	Is he Expendables?
4646040	4647040	Expendables 2.
4647040	4648040	Whoopee!
4648040	4649040	Well, actually, no, he has quite a few movies.
4649040	4653680	He has Expendables 2, he has two more movies with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
4653680	4657740	That's right, Arnold's gone back to acting.
4657740	4661560	He needs to go back to exercising, too, because, whoa!
4661560	4667480	I mean, that's pretty wrong of me saying that, but, you know, that's insane.
4667480	4668480	No, right?
4668480	4674120	Here he was, we've got the man who was elected by Ronald Reagan to be our, you know, the
4674120	4678880	person we attain, you know, we looked for as a role model for fitness, who was, what
4678880	4682400	was it, the president's fitness shit thing?
4682400	4683400	I'm not gonna lie, though.
4683400	4687720	If I'm that fit at that age, I'll be happy.
4687720	4689920	There's a very easy way for you to get that fit.
4689920	4691200	Stop eating that.
4691200	4692200	No.
4692200	4693840	It comes in a needle.
4693840	4695720	It comes with a needle in a little glass.
4695720	4696720	Oh, no.
4696720	4697720	Steroids.
4697720	4699880	Because that's how he did it.
4699880	4701880	Crack his wack, yo.
4701880	4704920	Oh, I see those receipts.
4704920	4706600	I don't believe it.
4706600	4710360	Don't make me get out the Whitney Houston interview, so I might say it's in bad taste.
4710360	4716880	All right, um, actually, I gotta say, I have, I have, I've become a lot more active lately.
4716880	4717880	I really have.
4717880	4720040	I mean, this is only within, like, the past, like, week and a half, so, you know, it's
4720040	4722840	not really a habit yet, which is why I haven't been talking about it a lot, but there's two
4722840	4724440	things to credit with it.
4724440	4726720	One of them would be the site Fitocracy.
4726720	4728680	I don't know how many of you guys know about this website, but-
4728680	4729680	I signed up for it.
4729680	4734080	It helps you kind of like, it turns tracking your fitness into a role-playing game with,
4734080	4738560	like, achievements and everything, and, you know, obviously, a lot of it is on your honor,
4738560	4742240	you know, because sure, I could sit, put in there and say, I did 100 sit-ups today, but,
4742240	4746200	you know, if you didn't do it, then you're only, you're losing, so, you know, it's kind
4746200	4752720	of helped motivate you and so forth, and I gotta say, as crazy as this sounds, and I,
4752720	4758400	I know I'll get called sell-out or whatever, but Rhythm Party got me up and moving and
4758400	4764160	remembering how good it feels to play DER for 30 minutes, again, and I really do credit
4764160	4765760	Rhythm Party, which had DLC this week.
4765760	4768760	I don't even think that comes, comes up in our show tonight, so I'll say it now.
4768760	4771240	They finally put out DLC for Rhythm Party this week.
4771240	4778200	The downside is it's all Konami originals, but the upside is, oh my god, the collaborations
4778200	4779840	are hilarious.
4779840	4782800	Do you know who Naoki collaborated with this time?
4782800	4783800	Tiffany.
4783800	4784800	Awesome.
4784800	4786800	Where does he?
4786800	4793760	I know, and then one of the songs has, um, who are, who are the, the, the sister sledge?
4793760	4794760	You remember sister sledge?
4794760	4800560	We are family, the, the oldest sister sledge, the one that was the vocalist, is in another
4800560	4801560	collaboration.
4801560	4807680	Like, it's all these, like, washed up fucking 80s and 70s vocalists are now in DDR, or Rhythm
4807680	4814720	Party, excuse me, songs, but unfortunately, Rhythm Party's weakest thing is like, okay,
4814720	4821640	it's got Born This Way by Gaga and nothing else contemporary.
4821640	4824840	I'm sorry, Bobby Brown is not contemporary.
4824840	4826080	More contemporary now though.
4826080	4831840	It is now, by sheer luck, but it was not supposed to be contemporary.
4831840	4833840	Um, the songs are decent though.
4833840	4835840	I wasn't, the songs are surprisingly decent.
4835840	4836840	You know, they're not.
4836840	4838880	I, I enjoy it more than Dance Masters.
4838880	4839880	I will stand by that.
4839880	4840880	It's a, it's a way better.
4840880	4843000	Dance Masters theme happens to be part of that.
4843000	4845120	Yeah, that wasn't a download pack too.
4845120	4847120	So anyhow, sorry.
4847120	4848120	See the thing.
4848120	4850040	I didn't mean to get on a tangent, but like I have been on a fitness kick lately.
4850040	4851040	See the thing with nice.
4851040	4855520	The thing with me though is I don't like really allocate myself that much time because you
4855520	4859320	know, when I get home from work, I got to watch the, you know, my son until he goes
4859320	4860320	to bed at eight.
4860320	4866720	So I have a short window between eight o'clock and 11 p.m. to have dinner, relax for a little
4866720	4867720	bit.
4867720	4869080	It's like, okay, where am I going to fit fitness in there?
4869080	4872240	Yes, I could do it, but then again at the same time, that's the only free time I have
4872240	4873240	all day.
4873240	4874360	I got to fit in games in there.
4874360	4878000	I'm going to fit and working on stuff I want to work on, you know, and I understand it's
4878000	4879780	just, I don't prioritize it enough.
4879780	4881320	I'll throw this out there.
4881320	4886160	Um, I, I, it may not work for your situation, but one like kind of goal I made is that I
4886160	4889800	try to walk a mile every day and I do that on my breaks at work.
4889800	4893780	I do it on my break and I have an application on my phone called Runkeeper that helps me
4893780	4896820	and it funny, Runkeeper ties into Fitocracy.
4896820	4901840	So every time I walk it will say on my Fitocracy, you walked 1.2 miles today.
4901840	4903000	And so I do that on my break.
4903000	4904720	I mean that's, that's what I've been trying to do.
4904720	4912000	Well, I'll tell you too, um, when I, cause keep in mind, I was up there a few years ago
4912000	4916900	and that's how I lost all of my weight was by cutting down, way down on sugar and walking
4916900	4919260	every day at work during my lunch break.
4919260	4923760	And that was when I was working off of downtown, off of Alhambra and walking around the house.
4923760	4926000	That big park twice.
4926000	4930120	So yeah, I don't know how, but I ballooned up at the end of last year, so I'm trying
4930120	4931120	to lose it.
4931120	4932120	Yoga.
4932120	4933920	And I'm actually planning on getting the connect yoga.
4933920	4939360	I started taking yoga twice a week and now I do it every day and I have noticed, um,
4939360	4943700	well, I'm, I'm not going to actually say the number or anything, but I've, since I've started
4943700	4950320	taking yoga and cut out all bread, I am now down seven pounds from when I started.
4950320	4951920	So congrats.
4951920	4955880	So yeah, just making little changes and incorporating some activity into your life is amazing.
4955880	4959000	You'll, you'll, you'll find a place to squeeze it in.
4959000	4963320	You know, I would love to, I had lift weights, do sit up, do 25 sit ups before you go to
4963320	4964320	bed.
4964320	4965320	Well, not before you go to bed.
4965320	4966320	Cause then you'll be up all night.
4966320	4968040	Do 25 sit ups right when you get home.
4968040	4970920	I've seriously thought about building new DDR pads.
4970920	4974720	I have sheet metal in my garage dedicated.
4974720	4978880	I can't because of the proximity to my son's room, it would be too loud.
4978880	4979880	Yeah.
4979880	4980880	All right, well moving on.
4980880	4982480	Let's get back into a video game talk.
4982480	4985480	I want to do a follow up to something we were talking about last week, which was the double
4985480	4988100	fine funding that happened through Kickstarter.
4988100	4989520	They're going to break 2 million.
4989520	4992440	I mean there's still 22 days left on that thing and I just checked it earlier today.
4992440	4993800	It was at 1.9 million.
4993800	4996960	So they're going to easily break 2 million, maybe make two and a half.
4996960	4997960	I don't know.
4997960	5002000	Uh, but double fine did, uh, kind of put out their first video that, you know, obviously
5002000	5005440	thanks everybody and so forth and talks about what's going to happen because remember a
5005440	5010200	big part of donating to this was that they were going to make the process transparent.
5010200	5012100	You know, a lot of game companies don't do this.
5012100	5013100	They need secrecy.
5013100	5017640	They don't unveil things till E3, everything is kind of done in a bubble, but this whole,
5017640	5020800	you know, part that, you know, they're trying to appeal to the masses is we're going to
5020800	5024320	have this whole process be transparent and they've already announced that there will
5024320	5031680	be a DRM free, uh, game that will be released on the PC, Mac and Linux when it launches.
5031680	5035320	Uh, there will be a closed beta that's going to happen on steam.
5035320	5040280	Um, and now Tim Schafer said in an interview that went up on YouTube that because they
5040280	5045400	got more money, uh, they're going to also do it on iOS and certain types of Android
5045400	5046400	phones.
5046400	5048320	So they're going to kind of expand to those platforms.
5048320	5051960	But it is important to note if you donate it to the project, you won't be able to get
5051960	5057960	the iOS and Android versions free because of the limitations of those types of distributions.
5057960	5063640	Um, from what I remember of the Apple store, you can get a finite number of codes to give
5063640	5064780	away your product.
5064780	5068440	Like it's gotta be a hundred or less, maybe even like 50 or 20.
5068440	5073240	But um, like, you know, with 30,000 people donating to this and counting, I think it's
5073240	5078600	even more, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm just reading off the lowest tier even, um, they can't generate
5078600	5080040	that kind of codes on iOS.
5080040	5085600	So your, your free one that you get for donating will be the PC, Mac or Linux version.
5085600	5091240	But there will also be now this iOS and Linux one, uh, nothing about consoles yet.
5091240	5092240	So there you go.
5092240	5093240	Kind of the first update.
5093240	5095640	You'll probably see more of this as it gets developed.
5095640	5100320	That'd be funny if they put that on indie games.
5100320	5101320	I guess they could.
5101320	5102320	Yeah.
5102320	5106240	File size is usually the only thing that's holding it back, but, um.
5106240	5107240	You never know though.
5107240	5110560	I mean, Xbox, Xbox is known for making exceptions.
5110560	5112040	So a high profile thing like this.
5112040	5113760	They'd probably put that Xbox library in.
5113760	5114760	Yeah.
5114760	5115760	Might as well.
5115760	5116760	Right.
5116760	5117760	Yeah.
5117760	5120800	So, all right, well, let's take a moment to walk down the halls of gaming's history.
5120800	5121800	You know, there was a time.
5121800	5123920	We didn't know anything.
5123920	5128360	The only stuff we knew about video games was what we read in Nintendo power or electronic
5128360	5129480	gaming monthly.
5129480	5130880	That's what we got to see development.
5130880	5132040	We didn't have the internet.
5132040	5133040	It looked like DOS.
5133040	5134560	It was called AOL.
5134560	5135560	That's right.
5135560	5136560	Or 1.0.
5136560	5139920	Back in my day it was quantum link on the Commodore 64.
5139920	5140920	We had beep.
5140920	5141920	Yes.
5141920	5142920	I had Prodigy.
5142920	5146120	Oh, you know, we call it what the AOL users called it, at least in my group, Buttigy.
5146120	5147120	We really called it.
5147120	5148120	Hey, hey.
5148120	5149120	And CompuSuck.
5149120	5153680	Prodigy was fucking awesome on the old PCs because of the graphics and everything.
5153680	5157680	Anyway, I was just very, I was very loyal to Prodigy for a long time.
5157680	5160560	I remember my old sign in, but anyway, we won't go there.
5160560	5162920	We'll go to the classic game of the week.
5162920	5167240	Dark Sakura is going to jump in the gaming vault and pick out one game she thinks, hey,
5167240	5168320	play it.
5168320	5171760	It is Rainbow Islands, the story of Bubble Bobble 2.
5171760	5173280	You've been on a bobble kick lately.
5173280	5175880	Well, I was inspired.
5175880	5180280	But any, and actually the music that I linked is probably one of the best home versions
5180280	5181520	ever.
5181520	5185800	This one is the PC Engine version, which is pretty much Arcade Perfect.
5185800	5189760	Anyway, Rainbow Islands came out in 1987.
5189760	5191680	It was by Taito.
5191680	5196280	And it was a sequel to, as it says, Bubble Bobble.
5196280	5202440	And the game, it was actually the second in the series.
5202440	5205960	It was followed by Bubble Symphony and Bubble Memories.
5205960	5211480	But it has two sequels, Parasol Stars and Bubble Bobble Part 2.
5211480	5213640	So it's come out on like, darn your everything.
5213640	5214960	It's kind of messed up.
5214960	5220020	But the way that you get through that is you have to, you're on an island that you have
5220020	5222880	to throw rainbows around to get to different platforms.
5222880	5228760	And you can use the rainbows to shoot things, but they will eventually break down.
5228760	5235760	You've also got this thing called the Hidden Depths, where it actually has a bunch of different
5235760	5239840	secrets that you can find, like different levels and power ups and different riddles.
5239840	5245400	And so it makes it, you can beat the game so many different ways.
5245400	5250320	It also has a scoring system that has its own secrets too, so you can get different
5250320	5253640	high scores by finding all the different stuff.
5253640	5258600	So as I said, it's set on islands, ten of them, and they each have their different theme.
5258600	5263080	And you basically move, you know, to the next island in the chain by, you know, going around
5263080	5264080	and passing the levels.
5264080	5265960	And they get progressively more difficult.
5265960	5270720	You have faster enemies, and you can also go on a large map screen where you can see
5270720	5272280	all the different islands.
5272280	5276640	There are three secret islands that are not visible until the seven big diamonds are collected,
5276640	5278840	which are hidden throughout the game.
5278840	5281720	And actually, most home versions lack the secret islands.
5281720	5286440	So you can release these rainbows, and they're weapons and platforms.
5286440	5291320	And when you jump on them, they fall down and hit the enemies below it.
5291320	5296760	And different power ups can make you go faster, increase the speed of the rainbows, and let
5296760	5298760	you spawn, I believe, up to three rainbows.
5298760	5300760	Isn't that right, Rob?
5300760	5301760	Yes.
5301760	5304040	I think it was three was the max you could get.
5304040	5306880	Just so you guys know, I love this game.
5306880	5310960	Like I used to play this at Roseville Golf Land in between while waiting for DDR, because
5310960	5313080	that was back when Ultracade was cool.
5313080	5316020	And I used to play this in the Ultracade machine all the time.
5316020	5319440	And people were like, what is that very homosexual game you are playing where you are literally
5319440	5321480	shooting rainbows?
5321480	5324360	It's Rainbow Islands, and it's awesome, you shut your judging mouth.
5324360	5330720	Well, and the other thing that's good about the little rainbows, too, is that they actually
5330720	5335360	protect you from overhead enemies taking big poops on you.
5335360	5339840	So at any rate- That video finished, so I'm going to do the totally awesome Commodore
5339840	5341840	64 version of the game.
5341840	5342840	Okay.
5342840	5347040	Well, at any rate, if you take too long on the level, then water will rise up from the
5347040	5348040	bottom.
5348040	5352120	The main characters are Bubloon and Bobloon, who are basically Bub and Bob, but they are
5352120	5354360	in human form as Bubby and Bobby.
5354360	5357960	Which, just looking at Bubby makes me laugh, because that's also like the Yiddish word
5357960	5358960	for grandmother.
5358960	5359960	Listen, Bubby.
5359960	5360960	Bubby.
5360960	5363720	And Bobby, Bobby's in this game.
5363720	5364720	Yeah.
5364720	5365720	Bobby's in the game.
5365720	5369520	So they're not bubble dragons, they're, you know, people.
5369520	5374480	And they have to take turns through the level, so Bubby is wearing a green shirt and Bobby
5374480	5376200	is wearing a blue shirt.
5376200	5380280	There's also Rainbow Island's extra version that's a modified version.
5380280	5384400	It has the same thing, except the bosses are in different orders, the enemies are in different
5384400	5387560	order, kind of like Bubble Bobble's super mode.
5387560	5389920	And it came out in limited quantities.
5389920	5395020	Now, just to let you know, it actually was included in the Mega Drive version of Rainbow
5395020	5401600	Islands, and the arcade version was actually licensed to Romstar to come out over in the
5401600	5402600	US.
5402600	5408800	So, the version that I was playing of Bubble Bobble had that version on it, the PS1 collection,
5408800	5410800	Bubble Bobble collection.
5410800	5415520	So all the different versions that came out at home, there was a Commodore 64, which we
5415520	5421200	just heard, the ZX Spectrum, an Amstrad CPC, there was an Amiga and Atari ST, the Mega
5421200	5427880	Drive version, there was the NES version, which was not that great, the European version
5427880	5431320	is also different than the Japanese version, just saying.
5431320	5434760	Sorry, sorry for that little clip in the background that wasn't really from Rainbow Islands, it
5434760	5440040	said it was the loading theme, but I think that was a universal loader thing back in
5440040	5442560	Commodore 64 piracy days, so sorry.
5442560	5445920	That clip was not actually from Rainbow Islands, I apologize.
5445920	5447560	So we'll go to...
5447560	5448560	Can I keep listing?
5448560	5450920	Yeah, but I need to find what system to do now.
5450920	5455480	How about this one, I think this is Arcade, let's hope nobody's doing a voiceover on this
5455480	5456480	one.
5456480	5458480	The Arcade one that I found was really quiet.
5458480	5459480	Yeah.
5459480	5462680	It's alright, it needs to be quiet so you can talk over it.
5462680	5468600	At any rate, we also had PC Engine Turbo Graphics, which was the first one that I linked as a
5468600	5469600	cue card.
5469600	5475320	There was also a PC Sega Saturn and Playstation version that was released as Bubble Bobble
5475320	5477560	featuring Rainbow Islands, that's the one I was playing.
5477560	5484200	There's a WonderSwan version, Game Boy Color, PC, PS2, Xbox that came out as part of Taito
5484200	5485200	Legends.
5485200	5493360	A mobile version and Xbox Live Arcade version got one that was updated with 2.5T graphics.
5493360	5501040	And then the Arcade game, now this is kinda neat, the music was actually based off Over
5501040	5503680	the Rainbow from the Wizard of Oz.
5503680	5510440	And it came on the Mega Drive, PC Engine, and Famicom versions, but when it came out
5510440	5516840	on the Master System, Saturn, all those other ones, they actually changed it so that they
5516840	5520280	wouldn't risk copyright infringement.
5520280	5522040	So yeah, that's the game that we have.
5522040	5525480	Oh, and I do want to mention some regional differences.
5525480	5528940	For the Sega Master System version and the European one, there was a glitch that made
5528940	5532960	the game crash after level 7, so it sent you back to the title screen.
5532960	5539000	If you use the level select code to get to 8, the glitch happens at the end of that level
5539000	5540400	and you can't even see the ending.
5540400	5543560	The Brazilian version, fixed it.
5543560	5549080	And the European version of the NES port is actually a lot more like the Arcade version
5549080	5553800	where the Japanese and North American versions have the original level designs and story
5553800	5554800	versions.
5554800	5555800	That's it.
5555800	5561460	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Rainbow Islands, on pretty much
5561460	5564860	every frickin' console that was out at the time.
5564860	5566520	And a few that weren't out at the time.
5566520	5567520	That's right.
5567520	5568520	There you go.
5568520	5572000	By the way, just to answer some questions from chat, some folks were saying, wasn't
5572000	5573360	that already the game of the week before?
5573360	5574360	No.
5574360	5578400	No, we did check versus the wiki, Parasol Stars, which was kind of a different like
5578400	5580520	bubble bobble sequel the other way.
5580520	5582360	It was one of the official sequels to the game.
5582360	5586840	Right, it was in the past and I'm pretty sure I would have brought up Rainbow Islands because
5586840	5591840	I did genuinely like the game a lot, but I believe, at least according to our wiki, this
5591840	5593920	is the first time that it has officially been the game of the week.
5593920	5597960	I did Parasol Stars like, what, last year, the year before, or something like that?
5597960	5598960	It was a while ago.
5598960	5603080	Well, you gotta remember, we've been doing classic game of the week since episode 250,
5603080	5604080	I believe.
5604080	5605080	Yeah.
5605080	5606080	We're almost to 450.
5606080	5608340	I've named over 200 games.
5608340	5610880	Probably when you count the marathon show and some of the shows where you weren't here
5610880	5613400	and all that, it's probably up to about 200 games.
5613400	5614400	Yeah, so.
5614400	5615400	There's still more to go.
5615400	5616400	I check.
5616400	5620680	I fact check because, dammit, I don't misspell shit like Capcom does.
5620680	5622120	I mean, I love you, Capcom, hire me.
5622120	5624000	But you did duplicate a game once, but just once.
5624000	5625000	Why did I duplicate?
5625000	5626000	Eh, one of the Final Fantasy games.
5626000	5627000	It was in there twice.
5627000	5628480	No, I think that I did a different version of it.
5628480	5629480	Eh.
5629480	5630480	Whatever.
5630480	5632040	I think it was one of those things where when it happened, we were just like, yeah, you
5632040	5633040	know what?
5633040	5634040	Deal with it.
5634040	5635040	Yeah.
5635040	5636040	It's been 200 shows.
5636040	5637040	If that was my only thing, then.
5637040	5638040	This game was doubly classic.
5638040	5639040	Screw it.
5639040	5642020	I'm, what I will, you know, it's going to get to a point where you're like, shit, I've
5642020	5643020	done like everything.
5643020	5644020	I'm going to be like.
5644020	5646520	It's going to be a PCP version as well.
5646520	5647520	I think that's what he heard.
5647520	5650760	Uh, I'm going to get out my Commodore 64 five and a quarter floppies and be all like, just
5650760	5653360	pick one out of the box.
5653360	5655600	My dad still has those in the garage.
5655600	5656600	You think those disks work?
5656600	5659400	Or do you think they've probably melted by now?
5659400	5660400	Let's fire up.
5660400	5661400	Geos.
5661400	5662400	All right.
5662400	5664680	Anyhow, uh, we're gonna take a break guys, but there's still plenty more show to come.
5664680	5665840	Rapid fire news coming up.
5665840	5670800	Of course, your emails at mailbag at orangeonshooter.com, uh, the FUs of the week, Twitter topics, and
5670800	5680800	so much more when we come back with more of orange lounge radio.
5680800	5684000	Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio.
5684000	5691520	We are live with the 446 episode, 446th episode of our show on this February, the 19th of
5691520	5695080	2012 live tonight live only tonight.
5695080	5698680	We're saying goodbye sadly to the OLR after birth at the very end of the show.
5698680	5701560	You know, we used to be live for about 20 minutes after we taped the show.
5701560	5704720	And the reason why we couldn't podcast is because a big central part of that was the
5704720	5707080	cage match where we played copyrighted music.
5707080	5710960	Uh, we've made a very difficult creative decision to end that segment tonight.
5710960	5716180	Um, in the good news is that it'll free up the resources to do other things, but I want
5716180	5717180	to warn everybody.
5717180	5718520	Don't expect that to come right away.
5718520	5721640	Uh, there's still some things that have to happen behind the scenes, but we are going
5721640	5723920	to use the time to work on other projects.
5723920	5727440	Um, so we still appreciate, of course, the live listeners coming out every week, but
5727440	5731080	we hope you'll understand and respect our decision to, um, you know, kind of say, you
5731080	5733840	know what, this, the segments losing steam for us.
5733840	5738480	We need to, we need to kind of put it out to pasture and reinvent with something new.
5738480	5739880	So that'll be ending live tonight.
5739880	5741760	Podcasters, not a damn thing changes for you.
5741760	5745840	If you've never listened to OLR live before, you're not going to notice a lick of difference
5745840	5746840	right now.
5746840	5748840	No, nothing will change.
5748840	5749840	Nothing will change.
5749840	5750840	The show is still fine.
5750840	5751840	All right.
5751840	5753680	Um, still holding it together with chicken wire duct tape.
5753680	5756240	There might be more in the future for you.
5756240	5757240	Who knows?
5757240	5758240	All right.
5758240	5762320	Uh, anyhow, before I give too much away, uh, let's talk, Oh, speaking of spoilers, I wanted
5762320	5766120	to bring this up at some point because, um, last week on the show, we had a very, uh,
5766120	5770520	unexpected surprise during the phone call segment and we made a new friend here at orange
5770520	5776320	launch radio and it was Asuka, Asuka, I always, I always want to say Asuka, but it's Asuka.
5776320	5784720	Keep in mind any, and for most words in Japanese, the U or Su or Ru, the U is really cut short.
5784720	5789760	Well now I've had my lesson, but, um, Asuka was on the show last week and she is from
5789760	5796120	the tester, which is, uh, the Sony, um, download show that you can get reality show that you
5796120	5797400	can only download.
5797400	5801080	And she was on the show last week and she was very candid about the whole thing and
5801080	5802080	it was great.
5802080	5805320	I really love talking to her and you know, I feel like we made a new friend and a new
5805320	5810520	member of the OL army who was very real with us about what was going on on the show.
5810520	5816040	And a spoiler alert, she got kicked off this week, which was the second week of the show,
5816040	5820000	which in some ways, you know, from an OLR perspective is, is funny.
5820000	5823660	I mean, I'm not, obviously I am not happy she got kicked off.
5823660	5824660	I think it's sad.
5824660	5825840	I wish, I really do wish she would have won.
5825840	5829860	She was a great gal, but in the respect of she was on the show, not even three days before
5829860	5835480	she got kicked off on the, the one props to her for keeping that secret.
5835480	5838660	Cause if I was, if that was me, that would have been a really hard thing to keep under
5838660	5844780	my hat is like, no guys, really next week's episode is going to make you so mad.
5844780	5850020	But the only bummer about that episode is, um, it was, it was kind of one of those things
5850020	5852760	where it was like, they definitely did Loki.
5852760	5853760	You saw it, right?
5853760	5855400	You finally watched it or whatever.
5855400	5862280	They definitely went for, it was an episode where you were reminded that it's a TV show
5862280	5867520	and not really a job interview because the decision that they made, you know, Oscar got
5867520	5873060	kicked off in favor of somebody who, you know, was quote unquote more entertaining television.
5873060	5877420	And Oscar knows that's not a dig on her, but this person that they kept was causing drama
5877420	5879960	and dramas ratings and so forth.
5879960	5884180	And Oscar, you know, was, was generally trying to get the job done and so forth.
5884180	5887440	But unfortunately the way that whole challenge was set up, it was going to be her, the other
5887440	5889640	gal and the other gal was starting fights.
5889640	5895700	So she was, excuse me, she had personality or whatever Jaffe said about her.
5895700	5900520	So bummer about Oscar, very sad to hear about that.
5900520	5904040	And um, you know, I get the sense she's kind of bummed out about the edit she got on the
5904040	5905920	show just in reading her Twitter and stuff.
5905920	5910600	But I just want to say, you know what I know, I think what bugs her is that they used a
5910600	5912840	clip of her at the very beginning of the show.
5912840	5913840	I'm just guessing.
5913840	5917420	I don't know, but I'm going to guess if I were her, they used a clip of her at the very
5917420	5920980	beginning of the show where she's dogging on Egoraptor a little bit because Egoraptor
5920980	5925240	got to stay around and this show kind of starts off with her like that's bull that he got
5925240	5927560	to stick around and you know, so forth.
5927560	5931540	Well guys, you know, remember this and the problem is Egoraptor has a very rabid fan
5931540	5936080	base on the internet and I'm sure she's getting, you know, nasty tweets and so forth because
5936080	5940760	of that, which is stupid because people should differentiate, you know, television from the
5940760	5944480	real person we had on the show last week who was a lot of fun.
5944480	5948900	I'm sure every person in the house said it was bullshit that he got to stick around because
5948900	5951660	of course that's one person between you and the prize.
5951660	5956280	They chose to show her probably because they wanted to show her to remind people who she
5956280	5959240	was because it was going to be her week to get kicked off the show.
5959240	5962640	You know, so it was all editing garbage and all this stuff.
5962640	5966180	So you know, it's unfortunate, but I didn't think she looked like a bitch.
5966180	5971240	I think she looked like somebody who was fighting to be there, you know, and that's, that was,
5971240	5972600	that was what it was all about.
5972600	5973840	So best of luck.
5973840	5977220	And if I know she's not in chat tonight, but I think there was a con or something this
5977220	5980820	weekend if we can get her back on the show to really now get the skinny on what went
5980820	5984800	down, she definitely has an open invite to come back any time.
5984800	5990600	Meanwhile, let's move on and talk about other video game news and we'll go with the rapid
5990600	5991600	fire news.
5991600	5992600	Loki.
5992600	5993600	All right.
5993600	5997120	So let's talk a little bit about, this is kind of cool.
5997120	6002720	It's a Vita game I'm definitely looking forward to and that would be Resistance Burning Skies.
6002720	6009560	It has been announced that it is coming out May 29th on the Vita and you know, kind of
6009560	6016320	been a side story to the whole Resistance series and looks pretty awesome.
6016320	6019400	So I'm definitely checking that out.
6019400	6024480	Also, it wasn't part of this, but I believe Gravity Rush is also supposed to be coming
6024480	6032780	out that same day as well, which is another really awesome looking Vita game, which unfortunately
6032780	6037080	due to the fact that you can only have one profile on your Vita system, I am not able
6037080	6043080	to download to my Vita, which is annoying, but yeah.
6043080	6044080	So there's that.
6044080	6050760	And then on top of that, there's also this new arcade game that's coming to Xbox Live
6050760	6051760	Arcade.
6051760	6060040	It's called Jam Live Music Arcade and what it is, is it's kind of like a music creation
6060040	6062960	remix program.
6062960	6070840	You can use your instruments, your Guitar Hero instruments, Rock Band instruments, whatever,
6070840	6072880	with this and you can actually remix some different songs.
6072880	6077800	It includes 30 licensed songs including, I guess, stuff from Modest Mouse, Fall Out Boy,
6077800	6085080	Fat Boy Slim, Rise Against, Atmosphere, and some other artists.
6085080	6088960	And we'll be coming out, I guess, on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network later
6088960	6090320	this year.
6090320	6094880	So that's kind of cool, at least something to maybe dust those instruments off for.
6094880	6101520	And then finally, the next piece of download content has been announced for, well the date
6101520	6106720	has for the, since we're the third game, Gangstas in Space.
6106720	6114560	It continues on kind of one of the endings of the game where you are filming a movie
6114560	6120760	and it's really cheesy, kind of like a parody of old Star Trek episodes or whatever.
6120760	6122920	It's just really, really ridiculous.
6122920	6124880	But there's gonna be that.
6124880	6129040	It's coming out for $6.99 on the 21st.
6129040	6133640	I will probably download it because I like Saints Row, so I don't know why I just didn't
6133640	6135040	get a season pass.
6135040	6140040	I gotta say this though, it better be longer than the last DLC because the last DLC I finished
6140040	6142060	in an hour and that's bullshit.
6142060	6143160	How much was it?
6143160	6144160	Seven dollars.
6144160	6147720	That is absolute bullshit.
6147720	6151960	And I gotta tell you this much, they aren't already starting off on a good note because
6151960	6156600	I thought the whole Gangstas in Space mission at the end won the alternate enemies.
6156600	6159920	It was kind of stupid, but whatever.
6159920	6163640	That's too bad because the first hour of that game I've never laughed so hard in my life.
6163640	6164640	That game is awesome.
6164640	6167400	No, don't get me wrong, that game is awesome.
6167400	6173080	It's just how they're treating the whole download content thing is just really annoying.
6173080	6179920	And trust me, if all three of these pieces of download content are terrible like this,
6179920	6183760	I'm just not gonna buy any download content for you guys anymore.
6183760	6189640	There's still ways I can play this shit without having to buy it, so I have that option, but
6189640	6190640	I'm not taking it.
6190640	6192640	I actually am purchasing download content.
6192640	6193640	Alright.
6193640	6197520	Speaking of DLC, I just want to insert something here because I noticed it's not in the show
6197520	6200120	roll but it's something I read because it sounds interesting to me.
6200120	6202520	Final Fantasy XIII-2 is getting a lot of DLC.
6202520	6205120	This is a very interesting path that Square is going down.
6205120	6209320	I wonder what this is going to do for future Final Fantasy games, but I guess they announced
6209320	6210320	one this week.
6210320	6216920	Not only are they doing another costume, and this one is Sarah with booby-age, but there's
6216920	6222560	going to be a side story mission now that will bring back Saws, who is an awesome character
6222560	6224040	in Final Fantasy XIII.
6224040	6226200	He was the dude with the chocobo and his afro.
6226200	6230520	I guess he's going to have a side mission or a side story thing, and if you beat it,
6230520	6235000	you get to use him as one of the quote-unquote monster companions in the main game.
6235000	6239160	So that could be interesting, but like Loki, I hope it doesn't disappoint in length.
6239160	6243080	I hope it's something that you can, you know, is rewarding.
6243080	6247200	I hope it has the same good storytelling as the rest of the Final Fantasy game does.
6247200	6249240	Meanwhile, other rapid-fire news.
6249240	6253800	Pandora's Tower is going to be coming out in Europe in April.
6253800	6258160	Now this is notable because Pandora's Tower is one of those Operation Rainfall games,
6258160	6261680	you know, one of the games that was big in Japan, and people were like, why aren't these
6261680	6263400	games coming out on the Wii over here?
6263400	6267580	Well, it's coming out in Europe in April, which means English translation.
6267580	6270080	Could it come out in America after that?
6270080	6271840	Maybe by 2013 at this rate.
6271840	6272840	We'll see.
6272840	6275200	Meanwhile, the rest of us will probably have pirated it by then.
6275200	6280200	Not that I endorse piracy, but I'm getting pretty damn sick of why is the game in English
6280200	6283960	and takes nine months to come over here, and then it's exclusive to only one store.
6283960	6291600	Excuse me, April 13th is the day that Pandora's Tower is coming out in Europe.
6291600	6292960	Pretty awesome there.
6292960	6297320	I guess the announcement came out with some Valentine's cards that they did online, which
6297320	6300360	was a very strange tie-in, but whatever.
6300360	6305800	Metal Gear Solid, a little bit of Metal Gear Solid news this week, the Metal Gear 3D demo,
6305800	6306800	by the way, is out.
6306800	6309760	I haven't checked it out myself, but for those of you that are 3DS-ing, you might want to
6309760	6310760	check out that demo.
6310760	6316640	Otherwise, Metal Gear Solid 4 is going to be ending its online portion this summer.
6316640	6320040	You might have already forgot that there was a whole Metal Gear portion online, but it
6320040	6322240	was Metal Gear Online.
6322240	6326120	It is going offline this summer, and it's probably because, well, nobody's really playing
6326120	6327120	it anymore.
6327120	6334360	I guess, oh, no, the shop for Metal Gear Online is closing March 21st, and then in April,
6334360	6339880	you cannot make new characters, and on June 21st, it is all going down.
6339880	6345480	Unfortunately, this is what happens to games that their servers aren't really used anymore
6345480	6349400	is that they take the servers down and use them for other games.
6349400	6354160	One other game announcement of sorts, or I guess it's more like a leaked, Korea's Game
6354160	6358680	Ratings Board has leaked news about Dragon Ball Z Connect.
6358680	6363560	Bondi Namco, who's made all the other Dragon Ball Z games, is making this one as well.
6363560	6365880	Who knows what the hell this game will involve.
6365880	6368080	Let's hope it will involve dancing.
6368080	6372600	Not bad for a show that's been off the air in Japan since 1990-something.
6372600	6373600	Right.
6373600	6377720	But, hey, how many times have they rebooted Ninja Turtles, so...
6377720	6380440	Except they haven't rebooted Dragon Ball Z.
6380440	6384360	GT came out, and that came out while I still lived in Alabama.
6384360	6386300	So there you go.
6386300	6388680	That's my rapid-fire news, Dark Sakura.
6388680	6390520	How about a Capcom-related one?
6390520	6394200	There is a new Dark Stalkers trademark in Europe.
6394200	6395400	Ooh.
6395400	6397620	So maybe there's a surprise game coming out?
6397620	6400440	Maybe they're doing something in the vein of Street Fighter III?
6400440	6401440	Who knows?
6401440	6404540	But that would be really sweet.
6404540	6412140	And we actually have been getting those constant reminders from Ono to have a push on Capcom
6412140	6413600	for more Dark Stalkers.
6413600	6415640	He said this is all up to the readers.
6415640	6416640	They have to create the buzz.
6416640	6417640	They have to tell us.
6417640	6419620	They have to write the condition.
6419620	6422380	They have to send the letters out of plead.
6422380	6425480	I guess that was translated badly.
6425480	6428880	Next up, Hulu Plus is now on Wii!
6428880	6433880	And it is a $7.99 a month subscription.
6433880	6436440	And there will be a 3DS version out later.
6436440	6438920	But no one cares.
6438920	6444120	And in Rock Band News, we do have some Megadeth.
6444120	6452600	The Megadeth pack has Symphony of Destruction and A Total Le Monde and Public Enemy number
6452600	6453600	1.
6453600	6460400	Symphony of Destruction has Pro Guitar and Pro Bass available for an extra buck.
6460400	6463200	But there are...
6463200	6466240	You can get the full albums of Peace Sells, but Who's Buying and Rest in Peace.
6466240	6469320	Because, you know, for me, it's all about playing Sweating Bullets.
6469320	6470320	Done.
6470320	6471320	Alright.
6471320	6472320	Megadeth.
6472320	6475800	You know, I'm gonna say this.
6475800	6478840	Megadeth is not great, but they had some great songs.
6478840	6484720	I mean, freaking Dave Mustaine got kicked out of Metallica for a reason.
6484720	6486040	But I don't know.
6486040	6488680	I think Sweating Bullets is probably their best song.
6488680	6491320	I gotta go back to the Darkstalkers news a little bit here.
6491320	6493720	Obviously, that was some big news.
6493720	6497800	Dungeon Buster in our chatroom at chat.orangelandrater.com says, I'd love another Darkstalkers.
6497800	6499640	Dude, I don't think you're alone.
6499640	6502440	I would really get a kick out of that.
6502440	6504800	And it would make sense for Capcom to go back to that.
6504800	6506800	You know, they've had Street Fighter IV.
6506800	6508680	They're gonna have this whole Street Fighter X Tekken.
6508680	6514320	I wouldn't be surprised at all if Darkstalkers kind of gets that treatment for 2013.
6514320	6516240	It's all about three.
6516240	6518000	One move and two characters.
6518000	6520040	Now, reverse that.
6520040	6523400	Two moves and one character.
6523400	6526280	The Succubus attack.
6526280	6527280	What was it called?
6527280	6529720	The pleasure something?
6529720	6534000	Dimitri's Midnight Bliss, where he turns the character into a female version.
6534000	6536240	Sexy female and then sucks him dry.
6536240	6537240	And then...
6537240	6538320	Nasty.
6538320	6544760	And then Jetta, who is just disgusting with the fetus, the God fetus stage.
6544760	6548600	All right, we're gonna get back into some more news here in the mailbag in just a moment,
6548600	6550560	but I do want to make sure I put out a call.
6550560	6555040	The last call for tweets for tonight, twitter.com slash O-L-R. If you have any statements you
6555040	6558880	want to make on what we've talked about tonight, or if you have any questions for us, we'll
6558880	6563600	take those via Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to add us and tweet at us
6563600	6564600	at O-L-R.
6564600	6568800	Uh, Loki, you got quite a little bit of news about one franchise, don't you?
6568800	6573280	Yeah, Assassin's Creed Revelations done pretty well, so of course it makes sense that they're
6573280	6575120	gonna do another Assassin's Creed game.
6575120	6577280	There's something called Assassin's Creed 3.
6577280	6582240	Yes, that's confusing because it's not the third Assassin's Creed game, but whatever.
6582240	6588320	It's coming out October 30th in North America, so it's, yeah, not too far away.
6588320	6592680	Definitely in time for the fourth quarter rush.
6592680	6597480	And for good reason, of course, Assassin's Creed Revelations shipped nearly 7 million
6597480	6605100	units worldwide, and to make a comparison with another popular franchise, Just Dance
6605100	6609020	shipped 13 million units worldwide.
6609020	6614460	That's in the last year, but if you remember, though, Revelations, though, that came out
6614460	6620720	back in November, so it's had a lot less time to do that, so it's pretty cool.
6620720	6625600	Of course, also, there's gonna be some download content coming to Revelations as well.
6625600	6629640	The new download content's called Assassin's Creed Revelations Lost Archives.
6629640	6637000	It's gonna be $15, and some of the achievements have already leaked out about it, and it's
6637000	6647040	supposed to be a single-player campaign as well, including 10 new achievements, so neat.
6647040	6652720	Lots and lots of Assassin's Creed news, but I guess when your franchise is popular...
6652720	6655600	The whole Assassin's Creed 3 thing doesn't bother me too much, though.
6655600	6659000	Think about how many Mario games there have been that have had all these different numbers,
6659000	6661640	like you had Mario World, then you had a bunch of other Mario games, then they went back
6661640	6663160	and did Mario World 2.
6663160	6668840	So Mario 64 wasn't really the 64th game in the series, although it may have felt like
6668840	6670840	his 64th appearance.
6670840	6675640	Alright, well, I find this next story kind of interesting.
6675640	6678680	It wasn't really like one of the big news stories this week, but I found this whole
6678680	6682160	discussion interesting, and kind of the questions this poses.
6682160	6685760	And I'm gonna mention this story that's on Destructoid.
6685760	6693240	And Destructoid ran an article about this site called Classic FM and the Hall of Fame.
6693240	6698920	Classic FM is a radio station in the UK, and they're trying to do a Hall of Fame contest
6698920	6704480	that has what they consider the most inspirational and worthwhile compositions of the year.
6704480	6706320	The public votes on this.
6706320	6713120	So there's a campaign to try to get Final Fantasy, Aris, Arith, I always want to say
6713120	6719840	Aris, because I grew up that way, but Arith theme for Final Fantasy VII as a song that's
6719840	6720840	recognized.
6720840	6726100	Which, you know, love or hate Final Fantasy VII, you gotta say that's a damn fine composition
6726100	6730940	and fits in well with the classical theme.
6730940	6735880	It's interesting to me kind of how much we've seen the video games kind of dip into classic
6735880	6739240	music just within the past, I don't know, I wanna say like five, six years, whenever
6739240	6741080	they started Dear Friends.
6741080	6746440	Because Dear Friends, there's, you know, of course video games live, which was, I wouldn't
6746440	6751000	really say as a night at the opera, but it definitely brings classical music and rock
6751000	6753400	music together, you know, in a way.
6753400	6756080	But of course Play, the video game orchestra.
6756080	6758560	You know, there have been several of these, and of course there was More Friends, which
6758560	6759800	really was not good.
6759800	6763840	I was there, you guys, it was a mess.
6763840	6768720	But for the most part, now we have what, the Zelda tours happening right now, and all this
6768720	6769720	other stuff.
6769720	6776720	So there's definitely been a push to get people into classic music through, I guess, music
6776720	6779080	and games, which makes sense to me.
6779080	6784940	I mean, we really connect with a lot of these songs and games, especially a lot of the songs
6784940	6786240	in Final Fantasy.
6786240	6790440	Like Dark Sakura, I know you cheered when she died in Final Fantasy VII, but you've
6790440	6791440	got to admit-
6791440	6792440	Oh yes I did!
6792440	6794880	You've got to admit, the music was amazing.
6794880	6797160	That actually wasn't my favorite music in the game, to be honest.
6797160	6798160	Really?
6798160	6802640	My favorite music in the game was the Jenova boss fight music right before that.
6802640	6805040	But see, that's not something that's really classic, you know what I mean?
6805040	6806360	No, but I'm serious.
6806360	6808800	I thought the Erythos scene was actually kind of boring.
6808800	6809800	Really?
6809800	6812200	And it wasn't really musically exciting.
6812200	6818400	I like really challenging and musically complex pieces.
6818400	6821960	So that's why I really liked the Jenova theme.
6821960	6825240	It was- what was that particular Jenova theme?
6825240	6828280	Wait, okay, go ahead and play some of it.
6828280	6831520	Well, I was going to play the Eryth theme because I see a comment in our chat room here
6831520	6832520	at chat.orangelandtrady.com.
6832520	6836720	Kaijuto says, I played Final Fantasy VII three times and I don't remember that theme.
6836720	6837720	I'm like, what?
6837720	6841720	All right, so here- yeah, I know.
6841720	6846400	But you know something- here we go.
6846400	6848880	This is right when she gets killed.
6848880	6855960	And this music is kind of used as an incidental throughout the whole game.
6855960	6856960	But it's sad.
6856960	6863240	It's pretty, but it's just- What it did at the time- this was so fucking
6863240	6865040	revolutionary for video games.
6865040	6866240	You know, it really was.
6866240	6871000	I realize there's seven haters out there, but you've got to recognize there was nothing
6871000	6873160	like this in games until here.
6873160	6878760	Yes, we had characters die in games before, but they didn't die on CD media in an epic
6878760	6879760	RPG.
6879760	6881600	Well, Celes did throw herself off a cliff.
6881600	6885400	Right, but she blinked and disappeared, you know?
6885400	6889760	This was like big, you know?
6889760	6893040	Well, find the Jenova thing.
6893040	6895080	What was the actual name of it?
6895080	6896080	Do you remember?
6896080	6900080	It was, uh, hold on.
6900080	6902520	I think I can get it.
6902520	6903760	Just the Jenova theme?
6903760	6909680	No, it was, uh- no, this wasn't it.
6909680	6919180	It was, uh- because that's- I think it was the Jenova absolute.
6919180	6920180	That's the one I liked.
6920180	6924600	Oh, I remember this, too.
6924600	6927400	Because it was like the play on the fight theme.
6927400	6931240	And you know what, you know, I shouldn't dog this compared to the other one.
6931240	6933240	I mean, it definitely invokes a mood.
6933240	6937560	You know, a lot of the boss music in these games is supposed to get you, like, you know,
6937560	6938800	pumped up, like, you know.
6938800	6939800	But see, that's my thing.
6939800	6944080	When I look for musical pieces, I look for the complexity of the piece.
6944080	6950080	I'm not saying I didn't like the Aerith music even as much as I hate the bitch herself.
6950080	6953720	It's just I thought her theme was a little formulaic.
6953720	6954720	I really did.
6954720	6956660	It- yes, it needs to be recognized.
6956660	6959800	I think this is a much more mature piece of music.
6959800	6960800	Just saying.
6960800	6963840	Well, what's interesting, you know, despite whatever game you're gonna pick from these
6963840	6968180	games, you know, the fact that I don't think this station would otherwise get as many votes
6968180	6974520	as they're gonna get now that there's actually a Facebook campaign trying to get Nobuo Imatsu's
6974520	6975520	theme recognized.
6975520	6980400	And you know what, no matter what song they pick, Nobuo Imatsu himself should be recognized
6980400	6983640	because that man has contributed so much for video game music.
6983640	6986840	Not just Final Fantasy, but some games that get grossly overlooked.
6986840	6987840	I met him.
6987840	6990720	I was- oh yeah, I sat two seats away from him.
6990720	6992040	Do you remember that?
6992040	6993040	When I went to Dear Friends?
6993040	6997160	But I'll tell you, the other person that I met in music gaming who has been inspirational
6997160	7000320	to me was Koji Kondo.
7000320	7005240	But I think Nobuo Imatsu, like, I was just talking with Twitter, or talking on Twitter
7005240	7011160	with somebody about this this week, Lost Odyssey is a grossly overlooked 360 title that also
7011160	7012720	has an amazing soundtrack.
7012720	7014240	But anyhow, I digress.
7014240	7019060	I was trying to get into the whole topic of, does a video game theme deserve to be treated
7019060	7026000	as a classical, you know, nod as a class- and I say yeah, why not?
7026000	7030720	My one thing about this is that now if that was a full- because keep in mind, the versions
7030720	7036320	of the songs of Final Fantasy VII were rendered with the game engine.
7036320	7040440	If they had taken actual- because I mean, they're synthesized.
7040440	7042440	It's clearly synthesizer music.
7042440	7045680	It's very complex synthesizer music, but that's what it is.
7045680	7050080	If it had been, you know, classically recorded with a full orchestra and then presented,
7050080	7053400	I think then maybe it could qualify.
7053400	7056320	But then you'd be looking into, you know, electronic music.
7056320	7062920	There's the Dear Friends version or there was an event in Japan that preceded Dear Friends
7062920	7064040	and inspired it.
7064040	7067200	Was it 2002?
7067200	7069520	It had some type of numberation in it.
7069520	7072440	There was some big concert they did in Japan for the Final Fantasy series.
7072440	7076480	I want to say it was 2-2-2002 that kind of started the whole damn thing.
7076480	7078360	There's a CD out for it and everything.
7078360	7079360	Yeah.
7079360	7080360	So, anyhow.
7080360	7081360	All right.
7081360	7082360	Well, anyhow.
7082360	7084360	I mean, we could also look to the Black Mages CDs too.
7084360	7090560	I don't think this video game music should dominate this whole thing, but I think a tip
7090560	7092160	of the hat would be great.
7092160	7095640	Ooh, good call from RDG Singe in the chat room.
7095640	7096640	Actraiser Suite.
7096640	7097640	True.
7097640	7100320	Oh, man, that was some fucking good music.
7100320	7101320	That was a...
7101320	7102320	Who did that?
7102320	7103320	That was...
7103320	7104320	Oh, God.
7104320	7105320	Why is his name escaping me just now?
7105320	7106960	He was in all the...
7106960	7108600	He did a DDR song that was big.
7108600	7110080	He did all the Wangan music.
7110080	7111080	Oh.
7111080	7112960	Why is his name escaping me right now?
7112960	7114720	He's like one of my favorites.
7114720	7116040	I know who you're talking about.
7116040	7117040	Oh, God.
7117040	7118040	Alzheimer's setting in early.
7118040	7119040	No, Rob.
7119040	7120040	Yuzu Koshiro.
7120040	7121040	Yeah.
7121040	7134760	All right, let's move on.
7134760	7140080	This is the part of the show where we're gonna go to the mailbag and read your emails.
7140080	7145080	Every week, you guys email us at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and Dark Soccer dives
7145080	7147040	into the email bag head first.
7147040	7148200	It's a little sticky.
7148200	7149720	And reads the emails.
7149720	7150720	Sorry.
7150720	7153400	Mailbag, orange laundry, I spilled cranberry juice on it.
7153400	7157800	And this time, I won't bitch about your grammar.
7157800	7161040	Hello, O-O-R. After last week's episode, I felt a little compelled to write an email
7161040	7162040	to you guys again.
7162040	7165960	I wanted to express how much I admire what you three are doing for such a long time.
7165960	7166960	Volunteering isn't always easy.
7166960	7169800	I'd like to tell my own story, if that's okay?
7169800	7170800	I guess.
7170800	7172200	You wrote a long enough email.
7172200	7174640	Hey, every gamer gets a voice.
7174640	7175640	In my voice.
7175640	7178980	10 years ago, we started a team to rebuild the local playground.
7178980	7181880	It really needed a lot of work to be safe and nice again.
7181880	7185720	Of course, we have to raise money, and we organize a festival that lasts three days.
7185720	7190000	More than 60 people helped us, from local youth to older people.
7190000	7193560	People always have a great time during the festival, because just like you, we try to
7193560	7195200	be very down to earth.
7195200	7199040	We don't think that we organize the biggest party ever, because we simply don't.
7199040	7201800	And most importantly, we don't act like it, too.
7201800	7204320	We want our festival to be for everyone.
7204320	7205520	But it is sometimes hard.
7205520	7209400	Some people come and say, wow, that's good money for only three days of work, but we
7209400	7213320	tell them how many hours, days, weeks, months to go into organizing the three days.
7213320	7215160	They say we must be crazy.
7215160	7219000	And yes, sometimes I don't feel like I'm doing anything, and sometimes it feels a little
7219000	7220000	tedious.
7220000	7221000	But you pull through.
7221000	7224160	When in summertime, you hear children play, laugh, scream, and cry in the playground.
7224160	7228240	Their parents read a book, or their grandparents just sit and watch the grandchildren play.
7228240	7231220	It makes it all more than worth it.
7231220	7234960	It feels good to create a little space for people to be themselves and have a good time
7234960	7236920	without having any troubles for a little while.
7236920	7238960	Can I just say, I think that's a great thing.
7238960	7240600	That's volunteer work, essentially.
7240600	7243840	That's volunteering for your community and doing good.
7243840	7247200	A lot of people do that stuff and don't get paid a single dime.
7247200	7249840	So I don't think you're crazy for only getting three days pay or whatever it was.
7249840	7254000	And I think that they're actually raising the money for charity for the sake of keeping
7254000	7255580	the playground upkeep.
7255580	7256580	That's great.
7256580	7257580	I think that's great.
7257580	7259640	OLR does that for its listeners, too, I think.
7259640	7260760	Well, at least for me.
7260760	7262200	You guys are very down to earth, too.
7262200	7265920	You don't go bragging about how fantastic you are or how you are just so outstanding
7265920	7266920	at games.
7266920	7267920	I am.
7267920	7268920	No, I'm kidding.
7268920	7271920	You're just normal, everyday people with the same problems as everyone else.
7271920	7275480	And funny as hell, too, I do miss Rob Bloods.
7275480	7279360	I don't.
7279360	7282880	I'm sorry if this email is a little long, but it really comes from my heart.
7282880	7288680	You are three hours of feel good and a very troublesome time for a lot of people.
7288680	7290180	Thank you for doing this show for so long.
7290180	7293560	I hope it can go on for some time because without it, I'd feel kind of lost.
7293560	7294560	You guys are awesome.
7294560	7296840	Yours truly, Fabrice from Belgium.
7296840	7300960	Aww, big hugs all the way for Belgium.
7300960	7301960	And Rob.
7301960	7303960	What do you want, woman?
7303960	7304960	A cookie.
7304960	7305960	I hate you.
7305960	7306960	No, you don't.
7306960	7307960	You love me.
7307960	7313680	You know what, though?
7313680	7319560	I appreciate that because I actually claim I don't want to be the best at gaming and
7319560	7321760	I don't want you to think I'm the best at gaming.
7321760	7327040	I am just an average gamer, you know, because I think, you know, why would I be stupid enough
7327040	7328040	to make that claim?
7328040	7329800	I know I'm not the best.
7329800	7334360	I fully admitted how much sucking I did on Bubble Bobble today, which is like the easiest
7334360	7335720	freaking game ever.
7335720	7340240	But I do have the number four score in Master Mode on Born This Way and Rhythm Party, so
7340240	7341560	I will kick your ass at Rhythm Party.
7341560	7343920	I am really good at Puzzle Bobble.
7343920	7344920	Just saying.
7344920	7345920	Just saying.
7345920	7346920	We all have our things.
7346920	7347920	Yeah.
7347920	7348920	No, we really appreciate it.
7348920	7352120	I mean, this whole show is kind of a way for us to get together on Sunday nights and just
7352120	7353120	do this.
7353120	7356280	And it really, you know, in some ways it's become a habit.
7356280	7360600	I think we do this show out of habit at this point, but I don't know where I'm going with
7360600	7361600	this.
7361600	7363640	When I have a week off, it feels really nice.
7363640	7364920	I'm not going to lie.
7364920	7366760	Like a week off here and there has been great.
7366760	7371520	But like if I had every week off, I think I'd be going like, I'm really bored.
7371520	7372520	Yeah.
7372520	7378480	I really don't know what to do with my Sundays, you know, without, honestly, without the show.
7378480	7382840	Um, you know, I actually feel, I hate to draw the comparison, I feel the same way about
7382840	7389280	Babysitting Julian too, because I love that kid and I love doing the show and I guess
7389280	7390280	I like you guys.
7390280	7393840	I usually, I come here for Alan really.
7393840	7394840	Alan and the cats.
7394840	7397560	Alan's only been in the picture for a couple of years though.
7397560	7401120	He's only been living here for about, you know, 10 months.
7401120	7407640	But um, no, I, you know, I, there, there would definitely be a void in my life.
7407640	7408640	I, you know, it's funny.
7408640	7412960	I was just talking today about the Oscars, you know, the Oscars are on next week.
7412960	7413960	Oscar shmaskers.
7413960	7418840	I used to be so into like, like a lot of gay man, this is very stereotypical, but we all
7418840	7419840	have our things.
7419840	7424680	I used to be really into the Oscars like, you know, 10 years ago and I was just commenting
7424680	7427440	like, I haven't seen the Oscars in 10 years.
7427440	7429080	Like who, who hosted last year?
7429080	7432840	I forgot, you know, cause I'm like, I do a show Sundays.
7432840	7433840	That's my thing.
7433840	7439180	I don't watch award shows anymore, even though like 10 years ago my friends would throw dinner
7439180	7442400	parties where all the dishes were themed after the best picture nominees.
7442400	7443400	Like how gay is that?
7443400	7444400	Right.
7444400	7445840	But, but it really happened.
7445840	7449600	You know, it's, this has just become a part of my life.
7449600	7450600	We've had scares.
7450600	7454840	Yeah, we've had scares, but, but you know, I'm going to have to say this is that even
7454840	7459760	if the situation has made me move, I would still try to find some way to make it work.
7459760	7462320	I would try everything until there was no other option.
7462320	7467380	I think even if OLR were to, I mean, there is going to come a day where OLR ends, everything
7467380	7468380	comes to an end.
7468380	7469380	Next week.
7469380	7470380	But no, not next week.
7470380	7471380	Stop it.
7471380	7475360	But you know, something will happen or whatever and you know, for whatever reason we'll choose
7475360	7476360	to end it.
7476360	7480160	And, but I just don't see me not podcasting.
7480160	7481160	I'd probably still do something.
7481160	7483520	I just have too big of a mouth.
7483520	7491540	Well, and we've actually, however we're going to make it work, still have a project in mind
7491540	7496360	that kind of got put on the back burner because of stuff and things, but we have stuff planned.
7496360	7497360	Curse that stuff and things.
7497360	7498360	I know.
7498360	7499360	All right, let's move on with emails.
7499360	7500360	Okay.
7500360	7501360	We're getting too sappy.
7501360	7504800	This one comes from Haseo Sumi Ragawa and I'm not going to vag you on your grammar this
7504800	7505800	time.
7505800	7507960	Like I said, I'm being a good girl.
7507960	7510200	She wants to get hired this week.
7510200	7512980	Capcom.
7512980	7513980	You know what?
7513980	7515080	I have to get a job this year.
7515080	7516080	I have to.
7516080	7517100	I know.
7517100	7520580	So all of you out there listening, you want to hire me.
7520580	7522860	I'm really amazing.
7522860	7525240	She doesn't like selling French fries, you guys.
7525240	7527080	I'm not going to work fast food.
7527080	7528920	I know you're not.
7528920	7529920	Dear OLR.
7529920	7530920	Okay.
7530920	7533720	Recently I purchased a copy of the older schools for oblivion game of the year edition.
7533720	7536420	Now I'm enjoying it for the most part with the exception of one thing.
7536420	7540740	The game of the year edition has a glitch in which when you are, oh shoot, he's sent
7540740	7542800	this before.
7542800	7544040	I've read this email before.
7544040	7545040	You have?
7545040	7546040	Yes, I have.
7546040	7547280	Did you send it again?
7547280	7548680	Thanks for reading my email.
7548680	7552600	Yeah, it's the same email.
7552600	7555280	I can pretend like we didn't hear it last week.
7555280	7556280	So did he accidentally send it?
7556280	7557280	Short, short version.
7557280	7558280	Okay.
7558280	7562980	Got turned into a vampire in elder schools for can't get turned back cause he gets burnt.
7562980	7565400	I didn't even know you could be a vampire and I'll just rolls for, and I think I said
7565400	7566400	the same thing.
7566400	7572080	And when this email was read, you meet a witch, she sends you out for stuff, but the ingredients
7572080	7573220	would not be accepted.
7573220	7575440	Now there's a patch.
7575440	7577400	Well, elder scrolls games broken.
7577400	7578720	Go figure.
7578720	7579720	Okay.
7579720	7580720	Last email.
7580720	7581720	Hey guys.
7581720	7582720	Sterlak here.
7582720	7583720	Hi Sterlak.
7583720	7586200	I'm sad to see the cage match ending after so long.
7586200	7587800	I've been listening since 2007.
7587800	7591200	I've discovered some great music, thanks to the cage match, particularly the birthday
7591200	7593480	massacre pendulum and goldfrap.
7593480	7597400	That's all three of us are big picks that we've done.
7597400	7602520	That is interesting because birthday massacre was my thing.
7602520	7605400	Pendulum is a Loki's thing and goldfrap was definitely from you.
7605400	7606400	That is true.
7606400	7607400	That is true though.
7607400	7611400	I'll definitely miss it as it was a big part of my week and something I always looked forward
7611400	7612400	to.
7612400	7617000	Well, maybe, maybe I'll suggest a song for you every week.
7617000	7618000	There'll be something.
7618000	7619000	Yeah.
7619000	7620000	Jamie will start a music advice blog.
7620000	7625160	You know, actually though, I did like the suggestion of post-show turntable.
7625160	7626160	Yes.
7626160	7631280	I love the idea of a post-show turntable FM because I think turntable FM is a great site.
7631280	7634780	It's which I've been grossly neglecting lately.
7634780	7640040	We used to just, what, run heroics, we used to run heroics and listen to, you know, all
7640040	7642160	of our weird stuff.
7642160	7646660	And so, yeah, you know, you actually got me back into a few bands that I used to listen
7646660	7653360	to before, like, um, Lea Andreone and, uh, um, D-Lite.
7653360	7655480	I met her once.
7655480	7656480	Nobody knows who she is.
7656480	7657480	I'm sure.
7657480	7658480	All right.
7658480	7659480	Okay.
7659480	7660480	So the rest of the email.
7660480	7661480	Yes.
7661480	7664520	Um, that being said, however, I do respect your guy's decision to end the segment.
7664520	7665760	It's not fun for you anymore.
7665760	7669120	It's a little silly to continue and you should devote your energy to something fresh and
7669120	7670120	new.
7670120	7673860	I, like many diehard O'Larians, sort of see you guys as family.
7673860	7676880	I eagerly look forward to seeing whatever you come up with next.
7676880	7679880	Also, I have a podcast recommendation for Jamie.
7679880	7680880	Ooh.
7680880	7681880	Okay.
7681880	7684400	You mentioned a week or two that you were into history.
7684400	7686760	Have you ever heard of Dan Carlin's Hardcore History?
7686760	7687960	Yes I have.
7687960	7691960	It's a really great podcast and quite educational as Mr. Carlin researches all his subjects
7691960	7694080	extensively and it really shows.
7694080	7696760	I have listened to hardcore history, but I'm way out of it.
7696760	7698400	I used to listen to it at my old job.
7698400	7701800	Um, he has great radio personality and it's a blast to listen to.
7701800	7706320	I really think you as a history enthusiast will, um, would really enjoy it.
7706320	7707320	Anyway.
7707320	7708320	Guess that's all for now.
7708320	7709320	Keep up the awesome work guys.
7709320	7710320	Thank you, Sterlok.
7710320	7712100	You're such a sweetie.
7712100	7713680	I have the perfect idea.
7713680	7719560	Well, we're going to start a Tumblr that you, me and Loki all have access to and we will
7719560	7721040	post songs we think are cool.
7721040	7722040	Okay.
7722040	7723040	That's it.
7723040	7726880	If you have music recommendations, we'll have a place where you can go look.
7726880	7727880	Okay.
7727880	7731600	And the great thing, unlike cage match, you'll be able to press the stop button.
7731600	7732600	You know what?
7732600	7733600	You know what we should call it?
7733600	7734600	Huh?
7734600	7735600	We should call our new Tumblr.
7735600	7736600	O-L-R cage match.
7736600	7737600	Fuck yeah cage match.
7737600	7738600	Yeah.
7738600	7739600	Fuck yeah cage match.
7739600	7740600	Everything on Tumblr.
7740600	7742760	I swear to God, if one of you registers that now, I'm going to go do it right now.
7742760	7743760	Hurry up.
7743760	7744760	Rob.
7744760	7746960	Well, okay.
7746960	7755320	I am actually, you know, I was actually thinking that, uh, because I've been, I miss doing
7755320	7759400	the comic book podcasts I used to except comics are kind of, they kind of blow now.
7759400	7765880	Um, but I was thinking, you know, what we haven't seen, there's classic gaming podcasts,
7765880	7769720	but there's no real history of gaming podcasts.
7769720	7770720	You know what I mean?
7770720	7771720	So, okay.
7771720	7780680	I just want to throw the idea out there guys who would be interested in a history podcast
7780680	7782960	like history of gaming.
7782960	7786620	I would like to know who is interested in that and just email the mailbag.
7786620	7791320	Also to the people who won master system games, I am sorry.
7791320	7793220	I have had a midterm last week.
7793220	7794760	I have been uber busy.
7794760	7795980	I'm very sorry.
7795980	7797520	Just send me an email.
7797520	7800920	It's my personal email, which I have given you guys because only a few people out there
7800920	7807680	have my real email and I will take care of it as soon as I get paid.
7807680	7808680	Okay.
7808680	7809680	I did it.
7809680	7810680	Fuck.
7810680	7811680	Yeah.
7811680	7812680	Cage match dot tumblr.com.
7812680	7813680	Okay.
7813680	7814680	I got it.
7814680	7815680	You know what song you should put up there first?
7815680	7816680	It should be from both of us.
7816680	7817680	No, I'm going to put the troll a little song up.
7817680	7818680	Okay.
7818680	7819680	Last week.
7819680	7820680	Oh, why would I not?
7820680	7821680	Ooh.
7821680	7822680	10 hours of trouble.
7822680	7823680	What?
7823680	7828400	I want you to put Beth Dito up there.
7828400	7829400	I will.
7829400	7830760	I will start putting good songs on there later.
7830760	7836060	You it's the same password as, as I shouldn't say that as something else.
7836060	7840040	I'm not going to say the same one we use for everything else except for that stuff.
7840040	7841040	Fucking safe.
7841040	7844480	I was being silly as if for everything except for that other stuff.
7844480	7845480	Yes, exactly.
7845480	7850520	God, no one knows what her password is anyway, except for Ron.
7850520	7857560	All right, Lord, anyhow, Rob, you make me ashamed.
7857560	7858560	Why?
7858560	7859560	I'm just kidding.
7859560	7860560	That made me sad.
7860560	7861560	Rob, you should get me some Pinkberry.
7861560	7862560	No.
7862560	7866240	See, that's the reason why we're actually quitting Afterbirth so we can go get Pinkberry
7866240	7867920	after the show.
7867920	7870040	We've decided that Pinkberry is more important.
7870040	7871320	I'm kidding.
7871320	7880400	Um, I actually hearing people being positive about the end of the, uh, the, uh, cage match.
7880400	7884240	It's not really just the cage, but just the whole Afterbirth makes me happy, but you know
7884240	7886160	what makes me pissed off?
7886160	7891600	Rob, not starting the FUs of the Week music.
7891600	7893520	I didn't know that we were done with the mailbag.
7893520	7894520	Mailbag at...
7894520	7895520	We are.
7895520	7896520	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7896520	7897520	Girl.
7897520	7904520	And now the FUs of the Week.
7904520	7916520	Uh, I guess I really don't have an FU.
7916520	7917520	No, I'm kidding.
7917520	7925120	Um, FU to, uh, not having an iPad in my hand hurting, like, a bitch while I was trying
7925120	7930640	to eat, uh, a Mongolian barbecue today and for Rob telling me that my dinner was stinky.
7930640	7933880	It was a little stinky.
7933880	7942000	It was just garlic and onions and lamb and moms and, um, an FU to me not having an awesome
7942000	7943000	job.
7943000	7945360	Capcom!
7945360	7947140	I want to work for you.
7947140	7952440	I would be a proud employee of Capcom, but then I couldn't talk about your games on OLR
7952440	7954980	anymore.
7954980	7957200	That would be a good reason to end OLR though, just saying.
7957200	7958760	Jamie got a job at Capcom.
7958760	7959760	We have to end the show.
7959760	7960760	End DA's.
7960760	7961760	Ending the show.
7961760	7962760	Alright.
7962760	7963880	I would just keep it up.
7963880	7966120	I would just show up as your celebrity guest.
7966120	7967120	It would be weird.
7967120	7968120	No, it would be weird.
7968120	7969120	We'd have to change the name.
7969120	7973480	It would be Rob and Loki on games because it wouldn't be OLR anymore.
7973480	7978760	Yeah, so really though, I mean, honestly, I am kind of in pissy mode about not having
7978760	7991720	a job and also FU to, um, my, uh, girl bits for not growing a small person.
7991720	7994280	I finally gave up and opened my bottle of chocolate wine.
7994280	7995280	My mom was 37.
7995280	7998280	I don't want to be 37.
7998280	7999280	Well.
7999280	8000280	Ever!
8000280	8001280	No, I'm kidding.
8001280	8007840	Um, yeah, uh, I gave up and I opened the bottle of wine I was saving for getting knocked up.
8007840	8008840	So.
8008840	8009840	Done.
8009840	8010840	Then it'll happen.
8010840	8012280	Don't get discouraged.
8012280	8014480	You know what, I have a coworker going through a very similar thing.
8014480	8015960	Oh, no, I'm done.
8015960	8016960	I'm done.
8016960	8018960	Loki, your FU's of the week.
8018960	8024640	I have you the week of eBay for the way they handle their feedback on ship time because
8024640	8029720	that should be something that shouldn't even be reliant upon the person that you ship something
8029720	8036520	to because it's basically the time, you know, that your auction ends versus how much time
8036520	8040220	you say you're going to ship it and when you actually ship your thing, not how long it
8040220	8044600	takes in the mail, but people are educated enough to understand that.
8044600	8047800	And so they're like, well, it took a long time to get to me because you shipped it during
8047800	8053640	Christmas and all the, you know, the weather was bad and it took me weeks to get it something
8053640	8057720	by the slowest ass mail service that I decided to pay for instead of upgrading it.
8057720	8059320	So I'm going to rate you a one.
8059320	8061440	Well, that sticks around for a whole year.
8061440	8068080	And then PayPal holds your money because they're fucking PayPal and they can do that.
8068080	8074260	So fuck you to eBay for even having that as an option of something to feed back on because
8074260	8077960	really they have all that information, they're just being fucking lazy so they can hold your
8077960	8078960	money.
8078960	8084200	All right, my FU of the week, actually all things considered, I've had a, I've had a
8084200	8086360	pretty good week, so I can't complain too much.
8086360	8092340	So I regretfully have to give an FU of the week to Sanrio, who's one of our cats.
8092340	8095360	She decided to claw me this morning when I picked her up because I actually, I banged
8095360	8099360	my head on the door and it scared the shit out of her, so she clawed me and it hurt.
8099360	8101820	So FU'd a cat for clawing me.
8101820	8103680	So there you go.
8103680	8105080	No KT's for you.
8105080	8108840	KT is short for a word I can't say because the cat understands what it means and she
8108840	8109840	will run in here.
8109840	8110840	Yes.
8110840	8117360	It rhymes with Bitty Meats KT, so they actually know what that means and they'll run out here
8117360	8118360	screaming.
8118360	8119840	You know, I actually never have to say the word around Shermie.
8119840	8120840	Really?
8120840	8123400	I just have to say, is it time?
8123400	8128960	And she'll go, they know, they know Shermie loves her greenies.
8128960	8130680	All right.
8130680	8131680	There it is.
8131680	8132680	Your FUs of the week.
8132680	8135120	This segment will not be going anywhere anytime soon, just so you know.
8135120	8138240	I realize it has nothing to do with games, but you know what?
8138240	8139240	We don't care.
8139240	8140240	Sometimes we're mad.
8140240	8141240	Loki!
8141240	8142240	You mad?
8142240	8143240	More gaming news.
8143240	8144240	You mad Rob?
8144240	8145240	You mad?
8145240	8146240	I'm mad.
8146240	8147240	2.0.
8147240	8148240	Heart.
8148240	8153240	All right, so let's talk a little bit about indie games and you know, no one's gonna disagree
8153240	8157800	at the fact that they're kind of hard to find sometimes.
8157800	8164920	Microsoft seems to kind of bury them pretty well within their new dashboard revisions
8164920	8172200	and the like, so of course it's up to the indies to take matters into their own hands
8172200	8178620	and launch their own Xbox Live indie game app for Windows Phone 7.
8178620	8179760	So they have done that.
8179760	8187780	There's actually an app that ties with XboxIndies.com and it gathers different feed data based
8187780	8194960	on that and you can actually search and link to the actual pages where you can buy them
8194960	8202280	and send them to your Xbox using this app and some other features that they're adding
8202280	8209480	that aren't really part of the indie games portion of the dashboard as it is are like
8209480	8215520	some dev picks and recommendations based on that kind of stuff.
8215520	8221400	So that's kind of cool and apparently this is going to be coming to other phone operating
8221400	8227860	systems like Android and iOS later on, but right now it's just Windows Phone 7.
8227860	8232840	But really it's kind of sad that they even have to do this because the fact that it's
8232840	8239080	just so poorly laid out on the current dashboard, but you know, it is what it is.
8239080	8244940	So at least now you can find that if you happen to have a Windows Phone 7, although I don't,
8244940	8249380	so eh, oh well.
8249380	8255200	I find that interesting though that the community is helping to fill in the gaps.
8255200	8261680	It's just sad that they're treating it the way, I mean, it's so under promoted.
8261680	8267560	I mean, so many games get added to that service and granted not a lot of them are great, but
8267560	8273480	there are a lot of them that are really good and good luck finding them because I mean
8273480	8277840	it's just, it's really hard to nail down that stuff.
8277840	8281960	I really wish that Microsoft's web interface was better because you know, you can find
8281960	8289840	all those indie games on Xbox.com or whatever, but it's not easy to navigate that store and
8289840	8293320	I think it'd be really great if they would build something in the web because I think
8293320	8298420	that's a great feature to be able to queue up Xbox downloads from the web.
8298420	8301660	I did that with the DLC I bought this week for Rhythm Party just so I wouldn't forget
8301660	8302660	to do it.
8302660	8306120	But yeah, I think they should use the web more to promote the indie games, they really
8306120	8307120	should.
8307120	8309960	Well that's just my thought.
8309960	8315160	Alright, well speaking of things we can't believe have been implemented by now, I still
8315160	8320700	can't believe that Apple has not put out an official tangible game button device that
8320700	8323280	works with the iPhone and iPad.
8323280	8324280	It's been third party.
8324280	8325600	Yeah, it's always been third party.
8325600	8330440	Well one of the biggest ones is the iCade and I think iCade is kind of getting adopted
8330440	8333880	as like the standard now, like there's games that just frickin' support it and one of the
8333880	8338440	big ones is the Atari's Classics thing will support iCade and more and more games are
8338440	8342800	supporting it so where Apple will not step in, iCade has been.
8342800	8348720	iCade is now putting out a new controller that's called the 8-Biddy.
8348720	8353360	It is basically an NES controller, is totally what they're jacking here, except it has four
8353360	8355860	buttons instead of two.
8355860	8358800	But hey, the NES controller was a great controller.
8358800	8363520	Kinda flimsy looking back on it, but when I was 11 that thing was rock solid.
8363520	8368280	25 bucks if you want this thing on ThinkGeek and it will work on all the games that the
8368280	8370480	iCade cabinet works with.
8370480	8374960	There's a D-pad start select and four buttons, I don't know what they're called but they're
8374960	8375960	there.
8375960	8376960	There you go.
8376960	8381680	And it looks neat, it looks a little Atari to me, which is strange because it's the 8-Biddy,
8381680	8386360	but it looks like it has that wood paneling look on the sides and then kind of that rainbow
8386360	8391360	color, kind of some of the old Atari art had, so it's kind of a mishmash of different video
8391360	8395120	game worlds, which is fine because they don't want to get sued.
8395120	8403920	For me, actually, as much as I like the idea, I wouldn't use it because playing on the controller
8403920	8404920	hurts.
8404920	8405920	Let's imagine you didn't have that though.
8405920	8406920	Good idea, right?
8406920	8408920	Yeah, good idea.
8408920	8411640	Most people don't.
8411640	8414960	When I get an iPad, we actually were going to get an iCade.
8414960	8415960	Nice.
8415960	8418720	All right, things are pretty nice, I got to say.
8418720	8420360	Some day when I have an iPad, we'll see.
8420360	8423480	All right, moving on, DarkSakura, speaking of peripherals, right?
8423480	8424480	Yep.
8424480	8432480	We have some support for Razer, the company Razer, within their lovely peripherals and
8432480	8434440	this is actually from Mass Effect 3.
8434440	8437720	Their download content comes bundled with the peripherals.
8437720	8444400	You actually get the Impertrator gaming mouse, which is 80 bucks.
8444400	8451720	There is the Vespula dual-sided gaming mouse mat, the Black Widow Ultimate gaming keyboard,
8451720	8460560	the Razer Onza Tournament Edition Xbox 360 controller, the Chimera Xbox 360 gaming headset,
8460560	8464960	iPhone 4s protection case, and N7 messenger bag.
8464960	8471120	This is kind of big bucks of stuff, but it's all Mass Effect 3.
8471120	8473920	What do you think?
8473920	8475640	I actually have a Razer mouse now.
8475640	8480280	I got one on Woot, the Tron Razer mouse, that came out for that.
8480280	8482020	I really love that mouse.
8482020	8486120	My only complaint is that I tend to click the side buttons when I don't intend to, so
8486120	8490360	I had to actually just disable them because one of them was set to mouse sensitivity and
8490360	8494560	that would really screw me up mid-raid, but otherwise, I love that mouse.
8494560	8496920	I love that it lights up and plays the Tron music.
8496920	8498520	The geek in me giggles every time.
8498520	8504680	Well, the other thing about this too is that on Razer's website, they're saying that this
8504680	8509400	Mass Effect 3 Collector's Edition peripherals and gear come with a redeemable code to unlock
8509400	8514340	bonus items for Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, including the Deadly Collector assault rifle
8514340	8516400	to give you a leg up on the Reaper invasion.
8516400	8517640	I'm quoting here.
8517640	8520960	If you have already unlocked the Collector assault rifle, this code will strengthen the
8520960	8523280	weapon further.
8523280	8531160	And of course the game comes out in the US on March 9th.
8531160	8535920	That's kind of interesting, bundling the DLC with peripherals, but I guess at one point
8535920	8538180	there was DLC on Pepsi bottles, right?
8538180	8542600	So I guess this isn't anything too new to entice the real fans.
8542600	8545200	Sega needs to get their ass in gear and give us Pepsi, man!
8545200	8548960	But the problem is, here's the thing, I'm not into Mass Effect, but I know a lot of
8548960	8553600	people that are, and if I was into Mass Effect, I wouldn't want that mouse anyway, because
8553600	8556400	I have the Tron mouse now.
8556400	8562160	You can only really have one mouse, maybe two, if you are really feeling spendy and
8562160	8565400	you want one for your laptop as well as your desktop.
8565400	8566400	That's it.
8566400	8567400	I suppose.
8567400	8568400	Yeah.
8568400	8571680	All right, just a couple more news stories for you guys, then the Twitter topics and
8571680	8577840	the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, but first, Loki.
8577840	8585320	All right, I know this is going to come as a shocker to you, so please be prepared, but
8585320	8587840	Activision is making another Call of Duty game.
8587840	8588840	Get out!
8588840	8591040	And it's coming out this fall.
8591040	8592040	Shut the front door!
8592040	8598960	I know, it's just, I cannot believe that kind of news.
8598960	8601320	It just boggles my mind.
8601320	8607760	So yes, anyway, so I don't even know why websites are running this story because it's stupid
8607760	8610560	but there's a French...
8610560	8612000	Here we are reporting on it!
8612000	8613000	Here we are.
8613000	8619760	Yeah, there is a French, there's a few French retailers, I think it may have even been Amazon,
8619760	8622880	that listed Call of Duty Black Ops 2.
8622880	8623880	Well, goodie.
8623880	8632080	Then on top of that, there's also this now developer, not really a developer, but kind
8632080	8637080	of a contract art studio employee.
8637080	8644680	He had listed, one of the pieces that he worked on was Call of Duty Black Ops 2.
8644680	8652920	Of course, now he has that taken, his whole profile is taken off of LinkedIn, but yeah,
8652920	8658000	I mean, come on, if you're surprised of this news, then you're an idiot, I mean, because
8658000	8659000	there is seriously...
8659000	8665460	This is just crazy talk, I mean, what's going to happen next, Loki, Madden 13?
8665460	8668000	There's already Madden 13.
8668000	8670960	I just...
8670960	8672840	My mind is blown.
8672840	8673840	I know, man.
8673840	8676280	I know.
8676280	8679520	I don't know what to tell you, but...
8679520	8683400	You mean there's not going to be a Guitar Hero 6, or wait, there may actually not be
8683400	8685080	a Guitar Hero 6?
8685080	8688000	There's a possibility that there will be, but yeah.
8688000	8689000	Alright.
8689000	8694120	One more news story for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR
8694120	8696240	or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8696240	8700360	Due to the delay, it's probably actually already open by the time you're hearing this.
8700360	8701360	This is a quick story.
8701360	8702880	This is about...
8702880	8709880	This is about the interesting repercussions of the Kickstarter thing, because...
8709880	8714360	And the reason why I say that is because, you know, when the Kickstarter raised a million
8714360	8718800	bucks last week, I'm sure many of us, and I know we here on the show said, how long
8718800	8722920	before everybody else signs up for this, trying to get their game funded.
8722920	8729200	Well, it's been mentioned that possibly this game will.
8729200	8734340	The folks at InXile Entertainment are going to start a Kickstarter, at least they've mentioned
8734340	8736200	their intentions to.
8736200	8739960	They did Hunted the Demons Forge, but the game that they want to use Kickstarter to
8739960	8744880	do is fund a reboot of Wasteland.
8744880	8748900	Brian Fargo, who's the CEO, recently got the rights to this role-playing game that was
8748900	8753920	on the PC back in 98?
8753920	8761080	I guess it's really a cult popular title because fans have been asking for a remake, and it's
8761080	8766200	very early in planning, but after seeing what happened with Double Fine, the CEO Brian Fargo
8766200	8771040	is on board, and they would have to raise a million dollars for that to happen.
8771040	8775840	I've got to be bluntly honest, I played a lot of old school PC games, and especially
8775840	8779120	Commodore 64 growing up, this game did not ring a bell to me.
8779120	8782000	And I'm sure there's fans of the game that are like, Rob, you're stupid, you suck.
8782000	8783800	But I did not know of Wasteland ever.
8783800	8784800	I went and looked it up on Wiki.
8784800	8787800	Yeah, it's apparently what Fallout's based off of.
8787800	8788800	Is it?
8788800	8789800	Okay, well now that makes sense.
8789800	8796160	Yeah, I was looking, even in the little screenshot, there seemed to be some comparisons, but yeah.
8796160	8801840	This series is really old, it goes all the way back to, it was 88, not 98, that's how
8801840	8803640	old this game is.
8803640	8808120	Apple 2 and Commodore 64 and all that, I don't remember playing it on Commodore 64, and god
8808120	8810080	I thought I played everything.
8810080	8817720	So that'll be interesting if that can actually get rebooted, but who knows how many people
8817720	8819840	will be willing to put their money where their mouth is.
8819840	8822320	Dungeon Buster in our chat room says Wasteland is awesome.
8822320	8826000	Yeah, but will you pay 15 bucks to see a new one in advance?
8826000	8827680	We'll see.
8827680	8833520	The Skype line is now open, 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8833520	8837040	Go ahead and give us a call, we're gonna take some calls before we close out the show.
8837040	8841520	In the meantime, we're gonna move to our Twitter, Twitter.com slash OLR.
8841520	8844680	Our first tweet tonight is from Dark Tetsuya.
8844680	8850140	There's an indie game jam type thing I'm going to be partaking in, so wish me luck.
8850140	8856040	And sends us a link to this thing at Glorious Train Wrecks, what in the world is this?
8856040	8859900	Pirate Cart 5, okay you gotta tell me what this is.
8859900	8864260	We're making loads of awesome and or terrible games and taking them to GDC to blow minds
8864260	8865260	with them.
8865260	8868840	Over the weekend of February 25th to 26th, everyone is invited to make as many games
8868840	8871640	as they can and submit them here.
8871640	8875360	After the event is over, we will package the games up into a launcher like we did with
8875360	8876520	previous Pirate Carts.
8876520	8880600	And then this March, we will be showing them off in a kiosk at the Game Developers Conference.
8880600	8882560	And they want everyone to participate.
8882560	8884520	That's kind of interesting.
8884520	8889020	Like please make all these games, we just want to flood.
8889020	8892760	It's almost like, let's throw something against the wall and see what sticks.
8892760	8894480	I don't know how else to phrase that, but we've got a call.
8894480	8896700	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio, who's this?
8896700	8898360	It's me, Swan Tom.
8898360	8899800	Hey, Swan Tom?
8899800	8900800	Yeah.
8900800	8901800	Hey, what's up?
8901800	8902800	Uh, none much.
8902800	8905000	This is my first time calling, obviously.
8905000	8907880	I was going to say, I don't recognize the name, but welcome to the show.
8907880	8911000	Yeah, I've been listening to Five Years now.
8911000	8914120	Holy schmoly, and this is your first time listening live?
8914120	8915120	First time calling in.
8915120	8917720	Oh my god, long time listener, first time caller.
8917720	8924160	Yeah, like, uh, I usually never listen live because I'm always sleeping or I'm doing something.
8924160	8925360	Where do you live?
8925360	8926360	I live in Seattle.
8926360	8928560	But you're, you're on the West Coast.
8928560	8929560	It's not that late.
8929560	8930560	Yeah.
8930560	8931560	But I work night shift.
8931560	8932560	I don't get off work like 4am.
8932560	8933560	All right.
8933560	8934560	You're excused then.
8934560	8935560	All right.
8935560	8939320	And the only reason why I remembered was, um, cause I don't know about you, but on Sundays,
8939320	8945120	like Loki, I usually like eat a big ass burger and like, I think it's cause I'm getting older.
8945120	8951760	I fall asleep after I eat and so it's like, like I get food coma.
8951760	8955480	So like by the time I wake up, it's like nine o'clock and it's like already over.
8955480	8957160	So there's like no point.
8957160	8960240	Yes, I have had similar things going on.
8960240	8961240	It's usually after work.
8961240	8963480	I'll come home from work and it's like nap.
8963480	8966680	I mean, you probably do something similar, but of course you also work the night shift.
8966680	8967680	So there you go.
8967680	8968680	Yeah, it sucks.
8968680	8970080	That's, that's the reason why I'm gaining weight too.
8970080	8971680	I eat and I sleep.
8971680	8974920	Time to start playing rhythm party and walk a mile every day.
8974920	8975920	Yeah.
8975920	8976920	I can't do that though.
8976920	8979000	Cause uh, I get home at four and I live in an apartment.
8979000	8980000	Oh yeah.
8980000	8981000	Yeah.
8981000	8982000	Isn't Seattle, isn't Seattle kind of nice though?
8982000	8983960	Or are there like bad parts?
8983960	8985600	Uh, there's bad parts.
8985600	8986600	All right.
8986600	8987600	I love Seattle for the record.
8987600	8988600	Like Tacoma.
8988600	8989600	I'm kidding.
8989600	8990600	I was just,
8990600	8991600	No, no, no.
8991600	8992600	Tacoma is actually pretty bad and a lot of,
8992600	8994840	I know, but I didn't want to actually say that.
8994840	8998320	We went to PAX obviously a few years ago and then I was in Seattle.
8998320	9003200	I just went for fun January of 2010 I think.
9003200	9004200	I know.
9004200	9006400	Cause you were there for a Martin Luther King.
9006400	9007920	You were going to see a friend or something.
9007920	9008920	Are you a stalker?
9008920	9009920	No.
9009920	9014880	The only reason why I remember that was because, uh, I was like, Oh, sky's coming, but I don't
9014880	9016080	know what you look like.
9016080	9018720	And all three of you went to PAX and I was like, where are they?
9018720	9019720	I don't know what they look like.
9019720	9021080	We were broadcasting in the hall.
9021080	9025680	I took a two hour nap on the beanbag section.
9025680	9029040	I'm watching Wil Wheaton and Jonathan Colton.
9029040	9032380	There's some money questions that have to be answered in my life as I'm sure we all
9032380	9035720	have going on this year, but I swear I'm doing everything I can to come to PAX this year
9035720	9037520	because I miss it.
9037520	9039440	So this year you will know what I look like.
9039440	9043920	But last year for some reason, like the tickets sold out really quick and I couldn't find
9043920	9046000	any tickets for the three day passes.
9046000	9049080	So I had to buy Friday, Saturday and Sunday all separate.
9049080	9050900	Yeah, that sucked.
9050900	9052360	Get in on it early this year.
9052360	9054500	Well, to what, to what do we really owe the call?
9054500	9056020	This call has been five years in the making.
9056020	9057020	What's on your mind?
9057020	9061400	Well, I, like I said, I was reminded that the show was on tonight because I was half
9061400	9066120	asleep and I was watching a movie called, uh, well it's a dumb movie, it's 17 again.
9066120	9067120	It's on Netflix.
9067120	9069200	I actually heard it was really good.
9069200	9073720	Yeah, well for the time, yeah, but anyways, they go into like this club and it's called
9073720	9078200	Orange Lounge and I was like, oh, Orange Lounge is on.
9078200	9081160	So I turned on the computer and here I am.
9081160	9083840	We're going to fucking sue their asses for jacking our name.
9083840	9086680	Yeah, and we'll do that when the Mobo Mogo people get us.
9086680	9087680	Oh yeah, that's right.
9087680	9089360	Konami, Konami could probably get us first.
9089360	9091480	But we're Orange Lounge Radio.
9091480	9093240	Yeah, there you go.
9093240	9094240	There's the radio part.
9094240	9098360	But anyways, my question was, um, why don't you like Terraria?
9098360	9101200	Oh God, I knew it.
9101200	9104440	Rabid, Rabid Minecrafty fans calling in.
9104440	9105840	Why do you hate our game?
9105840	9106840	I don't hate it.
9106840	9109560	I just, I didn't understand it at all.
9109560	9110960	Like I'm trying to play it.
9110960	9112200	Here's the thing.
9112200	9115180	I think you have to be an artistic person to get into those games.
9115180	9119960	And if you ever saw my art, which is ironic because I did the design thing for a little
9119960	9120960	bit.
9120960	9124280	Like, I don't know why I was able to do that, but like my drawing is terrible and just kind
9124280	9127440	of getting into that game, I was like, the hell am I supposed to be doing?
9127440	9134240	It was very weird to me to not have any tutorial, any objective, any anything.
9134240	9138640	And I realized for some people, that's the charm and I respect that.
9138640	9141520	But for me, I was just, I just felt so lost and overwhelmed.
9141520	9143080	I was like back to wow.
9143080	9146680	Yeah, in a way, wow was like that for me too.
9146680	9151000	Like I started, but I played for like two minutes because I was like, I don't know what
9151000	9152000	to do.
9152000	9153320	I don't know where to go.
9153320	9154880	When did you play wow?
9154880	9155880	Huh?
9155880	9157720	When did you play wow?
9157720	9159280	Was it recently or a long time ago?
9159280	9161360	It was like a year and a half ago.
9161360	9162360	They put it out with-
9162360	9163360	That was Cataclysm then.
9163360	9164360	Might've been.
9164360	9166640	With the Cataclysm expansion, they redid the beginner stuff.
9166640	9168640	So it might be a little better now.
9168640	9171080	I hated wow before that and I really like it now.
9171080	9172080	Oh.
9172080	9173080	Yeah.
9173080	9174080	Yeah.
9174080	9175080	And plus I have no friends to talk to.
9175080	9178600	So it's just like, I'm walking around and like, I'll see a character and I'll talk to
9178600	9181600	him or at least I think I'm talking to him anyways.
9181600	9186680	And like, I don't know, I just feel like I'm barging in or like, I'm like a stalker.
9186680	9188200	Like hey, look, there's a person.
9188200	9190520	So I go over there, talk and then they just walk away.
9190520	9193680	I'm like, oh, it's like real life.
9193680	9194680	It's weird.
9194680	9195680	People in wow don't want to talk.
9195680	9196680	Wait a minute.
9196680	9200040	You have no friends in wow, but you've got friends IRL, right?
9200040	9201440	No, not really.
9201440	9202440	No.
9202440	9203440	Well, cause I work night shift.
9203440	9208440	I have friends from school and stuff, but like when I want to hang out, everyone's sleeping.
9208440	9212880	He seems like he's mentally stable, at least from what we're getting in this hall.
9212880	9213880	I'll be your wow buddy.
9213880	9215360	We'll be, we'll be your friend.
9215360	9216680	You can add me on Steam.
9216680	9220520	Yeah, I have Steam too, but like I have no friends on Steam.
9220520	9223080	So it's like, there's no games to play with anyone.
9223080	9227320	Cause like I look on forums and stuff cause there's shows that have forums, but like every
9227320	9230600	now and then I'll look in the forum and there's trolls all the time.
9230600	9231600	And it's just like, wow.
9231600	9232600	No, no, no.
9232600	9235200	There's, there's a safe place on Steam for you.
9235200	9238400	You're going to go to orangelawntradio.com and on the left hand side, there's a little
9238400	9240440	box that says, or no, now it's in the upper right.
9240440	9241440	It says interact with us.
9241440	9243440	I don't even know my own damn site.
9243440	9246720	It's and there's a little picture of the Steam icon and that'll take you to the OLR Steam
9246720	9247720	community.
9247720	9251560	And we have one rule in the OLR Steam community and that is don't be a Dick.
9251560	9252600	Don't be a Dick.
9252600	9256320	So you're not going to get that in the, and if you get it, I want screenshots and you
9256320	9258020	report their asses to me.
9258020	9261720	And I will, Jamie, I will sick Jamie on them.
9261720	9264440	I will slap a bitch.
9264440	9267640	If you want to find me, I'm not there as dark Sakura and there's Kurosabasa.
9267640	9268640	Yeah.
9268640	9269640	So we're, we're there.
9269640	9273440	So, so feel free to add us and add, I'm sure there's folks in chat that'll be like, I like
9273440	9276280	Terraria, so I'll play it with you.
9276280	9277280	I didn't dislike it.
9277280	9278280	I just didn't get into it.
9278280	9279280	Before I let you go.
9279280	9281880	I got to know why do you like Terraria?
9281880	9282880	It's sway me.
9282880	9283880	Why should I be playing this game?
9283880	9285720	Well, the aesthetic is really nice.
9285720	9290520	I'm not really smart when it comes, well, I am smart, but I don't know, I don't understand
9290520	9294320	the whole eight bit and 16 bit, but it's got kind of like that same aesthetic.
9294320	9297560	So that's why I was wondering why you didn't like it because I know you like, you know,
9297560	9301360	older games and it's in two, it's two D, it's not three D. I played Minecraft.
9301360	9306760	I hated Minecraft because it's three D, but the world looks like crap and like you kind
9306760	9311840	of, it's like an RPG almost like you grind as in like mining or, and you can get better
9311840	9315000	pickaxes to pick faster.
9315000	9319280	Later on, if you, uh, if you really want, you don't have to, there are boss battles.
9319280	9322260	There's three boss battles, but they already added a lot more.
9322260	9326760	So there's another boss battle, which adds more bosses later and they added more stuff
9326760	9329480	from previous versions of the game.
9329480	9333520	It's just, they keep adding onto it and it's just something very addictive about it.
9333520	9337540	And like me and my girlfriend, like, uh, sometimes on the weekends we'll play and we'll make
9337540	9338840	our own house together.
9338840	9341080	Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, no, stop, stop.
9341080	9343140	You don't have friends, but you're getting laid.
9343140	9345120	You have a girlfriend, that's why you don't have friends.
9345120	9346120	That's why you don't have friends.
9346120	9349120	This is the woman saying it.
9349120	9350120	No, I'm kidding.
9350120	9351120	I'm kidding.
9351120	9352120	Okay.
9352120	9353120	I'm glad.
9353120	9354120	I'm glad.
9354120	9355120	At least you're getting taken care of.
9355120	9356120	All right.
9356120	9357120	I'm getting taken care of in that way.
9357120	9359840	But you know, after a while when you live with some like two years, we've been together
9359840	9366240	for four, but like after a while you kind of want friends, you know, like, like, okay.
9366240	9368400	I want to go out on a double date once in a while.
9368400	9373080	Yeah, well we're not married, but if we are, is it this how it's going to be?
9373080	9374520	I'm going to tell you something.
9374520	9378900	When I moved out here from Alabama, all I had really was Dan and his friends and actually
9378900	9383000	one of his friends became my best friend, Becky.
9383000	9387680	But I, it wasn't until I actually started venturing out to the arcades when we had good
9387680	9393320	ones and made friends on my own and found other groups that I could get involved with.
9393320	9398440	I am now like three people, like three or four people that I met at school are now really
9398440	9399440	good friends of mine.
9399440	9404360	And I will say this on Jamie's behalf, the best road trips that Jamie and Dan have ever
9404360	9406120	taken have been with me.
9406120	9409320	They really have cause Rob's heard us fight.
9409320	9410640	I will say this though.
9410640	9414160	Every time I go to like say, cause there's game works in Seattle.
9414160	9419300	Every time I go there and I played DDR, there's like this one weird person that like walks
9419300	9423000	up to the DDR machine because I'm pretty good at DDR.
9423000	9428000	I can beat max 300 pretty easily, but like people will just like come up to me, just
9428000	9429000	stare at me.
9429000	9433880	They come on, they're like kind of follow me, you know, and like ask me questions and
9433880	9434880	like cling on.
9434880	9435880	It's kind of weird.
9435880	9437360	So I kind of just stopped with that scene.
9437360	9440960	Did you say they ask you questions and cling on?
9440960	9441960	They cling on.
9441960	9446600	Oh, cause I was going to say you should just reply KA-BLAH.
9446600	9447600	Yeah.
9447600	9449240	Uh, I just get weirded out.
9449240	9450240	That's it.
9450240	9451240	I would get weirded out too.
9451240	9454760	Uh, you know, there's, there's ways to approach people and like stalking them is not one of
9454760	9458960	them, but it's an, you know, every fan scene has their very socially awkward.
9458960	9460520	People in it.
9460520	9464880	And let's be real, DDR has its fair share of socially awkward people.
9464880	9470100	Um, and, and so, you know, I, I don't know if there's an easy way to handle it.
9470100	9474320	Like you can, you can either be nice, you know, if you want to, or you can just be like,
9474320	9477800	okay, you're like violating some kind of code here and you gotta, you gotta like, bro, you
9477800	9478800	gotta go.
9478800	9479800	Yeah.
9479800	9480800	But that's the thing.
9480800	9482040	I don't say that to people cause, um, I'm kind of nice and I don't want to get in those
9482040	9483040	situations.
9483040	9484040	Yeah.
9484040	9487560	You know, if I was in that position, I'd be like, Oh, this guy's a dick.
9487560	9488560	Yeah.
9488560	9489560	I don't really do that.
9489560	9491120	Just like kind of brush them off lightly.
9491120	9494120	Like like I smoke, but I don't smoke that much.
9494120	9498640	So if someone follows me, I know that they don't smoke cause you could tell a smoker
9498640	9499640	from a non-smoker.
9499640	9500640	Sure.
9500640	9501640	So I'll just smoke.
9501640	9507920	It's kind of like my repellent, but like, like bees, it's kind of like smoke.
9507920	9510040	You throw them on bees cause you don't want them to sting you.
9510040	9511040	So they just run away.
9511040	9512040	Wait a minute.
9512040	9513480	You're a smoker and you can beat max 300.
9513480	9514480	Yeah.
9514480	9515480	That's a pretty big achievement.
9515480	9518360	I mean, I gotta say, I'm not going to judge you for the smoking thing cause I smoked for
9518360	9522000	years, but I would have never been able to beat max 300 as a smoker.
9522000	9523920	Well, yeah, it's pretty easy.
9523920	9528200	I mean, like if you smoke and you regularly exercise, it's you get used to it.
9528200	9529200	All right.
9529200	9530200	All right.
9530200	9531200	Well, um, you know what?
9531200	9536560	I gotta let you go so we can get more calls, but, um, I, I will, I will give Terraria a
9536560	9539360	second chance and seriously go to the steam community.
9539360	9541440	And I see people giving out their name and chat right now.
9541440	9542440	All right.
9542440	9544480	You can have people to play Terraria with.
9544480	9545480	All right.
9545480	9546480	All right.
9546480	9551400	So do not quit cause if you quit, I'm going to find you in LA or wherever you are, Sacramento,
9551400	9552400	but that's all you get.
9552400	9554580	All right.
9554580	9556080	It's like Seattle, but less rain.
9556080	9557080	All right.
9557080	9558080	Yeah.
9558080	9559080	All right.
9559080	9560080	Later.
9560080	9561080	Later.
9561080	9562080	That was a fun call.
9562080	9563080	I let it go on a little longer.
9563080	9565280	Usually I try to keep it in five minutes, but Hey, he was a long time listener.
9565280	9566840	I spelled mine out in chat.
9566840	9570880	So one eight seven seven game OLR or username on Skype is orange Laundraido.
9570880	9573760	By the way, I just want to say with that last call, I'm not endorsing smoking.
9573760	9577360	It's just, I'm not going to be that guy that's like, you need to quit smoking right now.
9577360	9578780	Trust me smokers.
9578780	9583060	They know the choice they're making and I've heard the pros and cons and you usually just
9583060	9587080	have to have something happen where you're like, okay, I'm going to quit.
9587080	9590640	So that's what happened to me is finally, I just hit a point where something happened
9590640	9592000	and I was like, you know what?
9592000	9593440	I'm now going to quit.
9593440	9598480	So anyhow, let's move on with more calls higher on orange Laundraido.
9598480	9599480	Who's this?
9599480	9601480	Hey, this is hackdeft.
9601480	9603840	Our favorite Mexican.
9603840	9605160	Yeah.
9605160	9608100	Actually we have two or three Mexicans that listen, so I shouldn't play favorites.
9608100	9613040	So one of our favorite Mexicans, what's on your mind, buddy?
9613040	9618920	Uh, I just wanted to talk about, uh, the article you, uh, you were talking about, uh, video
9618920	9622880	game music being in the hall of fame.
9622880	9623880	Yes.
9623880	9624880	The classic music in the hall of fame.
9624880	9626600	What'd you want to say about it?
9626600	9633400	Well, basically you talk about if, whether it should be recognized as classical music
9633400	9637160	or it should be recognized there in the hall of fame.
9637160	9644240	And I think, and this is a very strong opinion of mine that it should be, uh, uh, recognized
9644240	9648000	as music by everyone.
9648000	9649000	Well absolutely.
9649000	9651360	But what about classical music?
9651360	9653360	That's that's the key thing.
9653360	9655720	Well, that's the thing.
9655720	9664120	I don't consider it, consider it, uh, as classical music at least it, uh, because, well, you're
9664120	9671000	talking about genres and all that and video game music is more, uh, how do you say it?
9671000	9672000	Contemporary?
9672000	9673000	More modern?
9673000	9675740	Yeah, I agree with you.
9675740	9681880	So as classical music, I don't think it should be, uh, well, characterized.
9681880	9689960	So, uh, so like that, I don't think so, but it should definitely be recognized.
9689960	9692120	All right.
9692120	9697280	Well, I mean, it's just, I think there's a lot of like contemporary classical, which
9697280	9702240	is a really weird term, but I guess it's like, you know, um, when you kind of write your
9702240	9705600	music with that classical sound and you're influenced with that.
9705600	9706600	And I don't know, I get that.
9706600	9707600	I get that sense.
9707600	9712360	I think it's very, I think that's why things like Dear Friends work is that they feel like
9712360	9718440	a night out at the orchestra, but it's music I killed monsters to.
9718440	9726680	Well, the thing with me is that classical music is more like Beethoven, Mozart, uh,
9726680	9728480	things like that.
9728480	9735360	And well, while, while some music, like, especially in Final Fantasy, that is heavily orchestrated.
9735360	9740480	Well, it sounds like classical music, but it, but it isn't, it isn't classical.
9740480	9742320	It isn't a classical piece.
9742320	9747440	It's an orchestrated, uh, modern piece, but it isn't classical.
9747440	9748440	Okay.
9748440	9749440	Okay.
9749440	9754520	So maybe they're just, and I'm sure there's a better word to define this genre of music.
9754520	9755960	You know what it makes me think of?
9755960	9758880	It makes me think of fusion, like Vanessa May.
9758880	9759880	Okay.
9759880	9764120	And what, like, if I were to look in a CD store, wouldn't they, that'd be like adult
9764120	9766160	contemporary, but then that makes me think like Celine Dion.
9766160	9767800	It would be under instrumental.
9767800	9768800	Yeah.
9768800	9769800	Okay.
9769800	9770800	Okay.
9770800	9773920	Or, uh, sometimes you find them under world music sometimes.
9773920	9776720	Do you think that if this gets enough votes, Oh, go ahead.
9776720	9778720	I was gonna say one more place you find video game music.
9778720	9782080	There is under soundtrack sections cause I find it all the time at dimple.
9782080	9783080	True.
9783080	9788400	Do you think if there is, Oh, I like this comment from Black Wolf in our chat at chat.orangesoundsradio.com.
9788400	9791920	Classical is a style of music, not an era of music.
9791920	9793300	Maybe a different way of thinking about it.
9793300	9799720	Maybe you're thinking about classical in the, um, era sense, but, um, all this stuff aside,
9799720	9804160	what, what it is or what it isn't, we just know, you know, we like this music.
9804160	9811180	Do you think if it wins the poll, do you think that the UK radio station will ultimately
9811180	9816620	recognize it or do you think they'll reject it as like, Oh, it's these silly gamer fan
9816620	9820160	boys are doing this and we're just going to throw their votes out?
9820160	9826680	Well, they may be recognized it and all because, well, the people voted for it.
9826680	9834520	So I don't think why it shouldn't be, but like I said, and maybe Black Wolf has a point,
9834520	9842200	but like I said, it, it isn't classical in the sense that it, it hasn't like, uh, like
9842200	9844080	I said, it isn't very classical.
9844080	9850880	It isn't something from the 18, 18 hundreds or the 17 hundreds.
9850880	9851880	It's modern.
9851880	9859640	It's something like as of recent and then there's very, and there's other, uh, uh, outside
9859640	9867040	of video games that, that also have, uh, classical pieces or that sound classical, but I don't
9867040	9873360	at least, uh, in my opinion, and I know that Black Wolf is a classic, uh, as a musician
9873360	9876040	and it's trained for that, but this is my opinion.
9876040	9879040	And like I said, it isn't for me.
9879040	9880040	Okay.
9880040	9881040	That's, that's fair.
9881040	9882040	That's fair.
9882040	9885960	Uh, and, uh, JV Mon in our chat room gives a term that should have been fricking obvious,
9885960	9887960	orchestral music.
9887960	9889160	That's a word I should have thought of.
9889160	9890160	All right.
9890160	9892900	Let me take this a completely different direction and then we'll end this call active since
9892900	9896180	you brought up music and all this and what you like and so forth.
9896180	9899560	What is your favorite video game music ever?
9899560	9900560	No.
9900560	9908440	This, that is a very tough question for me, especially since I'll make a little plug here
9908440	9914400	and well, and I love and I love, sorry, I love that song.
9914400	9915400	I love that.
9915400	9918320	The music articles we do for all are right.
9918320	9925100	Me and Dr. Zuya, we try to pick at least in my, in my, um, personal perspective, I tried
9925100	9929440	to pick something that is, that it isn't that recognized.
9929440	9940160	But if I had to pick one soundtrack that I really, really like, it should be, and I think
9940160	9948880	I may, I maybe, uh, maybe I, I will think about another, but in the future, but, uh,
9948880	9955320	I think the Silent Hill 2, uh, soundtrack is like awesome.
9955320	9956320	Interesting direction.
9956320	9957320	No, it's great.
9957320	9958320	It is.
9958320	9959320	That's a great pick.
9959320	9960320	Interesting direction.
9960320	9964440	I, that's not one I usually hear people say is their absolute favorite, but it's really
9964440	9965440	damn good.
9965440	9967440	So I, I'm not surprised to hear that at all.
9967440	9969360	Akira Yamaoka is great.
9969360	9970360	He's a great guy.
9970360	9971360	All right.
9971360	9976760	You know, cause like my, one of my favorite composers, if not the best in video game music
9976760	9978400	and definitely not something I would call classical.
9978400	9979400	All right.
9979400	9980400	Definitely.
9980400	9981400	All right.
9981400	9983800	On the same note, I actually prefer Silent Hill 3, that soundtrack.
9983800	9985440	Yeah, but still it's all, it's all Akira.
9985440	9986440	That's really good.
9986440	9987440	Yeah.
9987440	9988440	All right.
9988440	9990440	We'll have one more call in for the end of the show, but have a great night.
9990440	9991440	Okay.
9991440	9992440	You too.
9992440	9993440	All right.
9993440	9994440	Thanks buddy.
9994440	9995440	Uh, quick, one more quick call.
9995440	9998760	We cannot make time for when it we're running a little long, but we, we took a extended
9998760	10003760	break and then, um, we had a long call there to start, but I'll try to squeeze in one more
10003760	10004760	quick call.

10005760	10007960	O L R or a username on Skype is orange launch radio.

10011120	10014240	I only got through the first one, uh, tiger class and in a couple of quick ones, I'll
10014240	10018240	try to get out here quick, quick BAFTA nominations, which we missed.
10018240	10022400	Talking about on the show, BAFTA is the British Academy film and television arts.
10022400	10027560	They have, uh, released the nominations for the 2012 video game awards, which honors the
10027560	10033160	top games from 2011, the year before, and they've nominated in various categories, action,
10033160	10034160	artistic achievement.
10034160	10039640	I don't really have time to read all of these games, uh, but I will say quickly the game

10053920	10054920	Who's this?
10054920	10056720	Hey, this is Bobby black Wolf.
10056720	10058240	Oh, Hey Bobby.
10058240	10060920	What could you ever be calling in about what's on your mind?
10060920	10067080	So Wikipedia says classical music is the art music produced in or rooted in the traditions
10067080	10070680	of Western liturgical and secular music.
10070680	10075520	So it's all about the style and not necessarily when it was composed because Leonard Bernstein
10075520	10079720	was a great classical composer and he was born this century.
10079720	10085160	So does that mean that like, uh, kabuki theater music would not be considered classical because
10085160	10087160	it's Eastern.
10087160	10091200	There's um, let's see, basically classical is mostly Western music.
10091200	10092200	Yeah.
10092200	10096920	According to this, a lot of the terminology here, it's usually like American or European.
10096920	10098480	Where would you find something like Brian Eno?
10098480	10102080	Is that classical or is that considered like new age?
10102080	10103080	Probably new age.
10103080	10111140	Cause I've played both classical and I play new age music as have I and jazz.
10111140	10112600	So Bobby, what do you say?
10112600	10116040	Of course, Bobby, I gotta, I gotta let you plug your show here, which you're on before
10116040	10118880	us at all games radio, of course, Sunday nights.
10118880	10124600	But um, what do you think about the whole trying to push for video game recognition
10124600	10127800	on a classical music station?
10127800	10132240	I think it's great because I mean, and here's the thing, like everybody's like, Oh, well
10132240	10136080	that, that wasn't even the best song in final fantasy seven and blah, blah, blah.
10136080	10137120	Here's the thing.
10137120	10144160	You need to get the majority to agree with you and to be able to get something recognized
10144160	10145160	on that platform.
10145160	10151560	And you know, yeah, Aerith's theme, you know, was created on a synth and everything, but
10151560	10157960	the more friends CD version, I know the concert sucked, but that CD version, if you play that
10157960	10161320	for somebody who doesn't know it's from a video game, they will think it's one of the
10161320	10165200	most beautiful classical pieces they've heard in a long time.
10165200	10169960	And that's really the testament to that piece.
10169960	10173760	And yes, it's, if somebody doesn't know it's from a video game, they will think it is a
10173760	10175440	classical piece.
10175440	10176440	I agree.
10176440	10180060	You've got to rally the troops behind one thing or it's not going to work.
10180060	10181640	You're going to, you're going to divide it all up.
10181640	10186360	So, you know, I think they just kind of had to say, you know what, this is the song that
10186360	10189680	had a huge moment that was notable in gaming.
10189680	10190680	We're going to go here.
10190680	10195400	You know, I can see that despite how, you know, whatever song from Final Fantasy 7 or
10195400	10197240	even Final Fantasy 6 may be your favorite.
10197240	10201840	Like if it were me picking a Final Fantasy song, I think Terra's theme from Final Fantasy
10201840	10204360	6 is like the greatest Final Fantasy song there ever was.
10204360	10206840	I think the marching version of that is the best.
10206840	10207840	Love it.
10207840	10211640	Well, I actually did, I did a little more digging on this and actually the Aerith's
10211640	10214240	theme that's in Final Fantasy 7 is not eligible.
10214240	10217200	Oh no, why is that?
10217200	10219920	Here's why, because it was made for a synth.
10219920	10220920	Oh.
10220920	10225040	But, you can nominate one of the later versions.
10225040	10230200	So, you know, basically what they're nominating is that it was rearranged for an orchestra.
10230200	10235320	That is also applicable, but also that Facebook fan page is not just concentrating on Aerith's
10235320	10236320	theme.
10236320	10237320	That was the first one.
10237320	10242400	They actually, like every week, they're putting up a new classical piece from video games
10242400	10247600	that you can also put in, like Dragonborn from Skyrim is currently also, they're trying
10247600	10249000	to get people to vote for that.
10249000	10250760	They just want something in there.
10250760	10254360	Aerith's theme is just the one that's going to be the most popular that the most people
10254360	10257080	are going to go into.
10257080	10263920	But they've got several suggestions of pieces that do fit the criteria that Classic FM has
10263920	10264920	set.
10264920	10270760	They actually do have rules and the original PlayStation 1 version of Aerith's theme does
10270760	10271760	not count.
10271760	10275760	I gotta give you credit, Dark Soccer, you kinda were on that track earlier when you
10275760	10276760	were talking about that.
10276760	10277760	So I gotta give you props.
10277760	10278760	Thank you.
10278760	10281520	I thought you brought that up earlier.
10281520	10283360	You know, some great suggestions from our chatroom too.
10283360	10288040	JV Monn says the simple and clean orchestral version is amazing.
10288040	10291520	That was one of the other ones that they had suggested on that same Facebook page.
10291520	10296800	The story that Tommy T. tells about that, and I think he told it on your show and ours
10296800	10300840	about how Disney didn't want to give the rights to the visuals, but then they heard it and
10300840	10305000	not a dry eye in the house.
10305000	10306120	That's a powerful piece of music.
10306120	10307120	It really is.
10307120	10312480	Yeah, so I mean, that's the thing is that, you know, classical music is not just an era.
10312480	10315620	People hear the term classical and think, oh, it's just Bach.
10315620	10318560	It's just, you know, it's just Mozart.
10318560	10326120	All right, Bobby, before we let you go, we can't keep this going all night because we
10326120	10327120	probably could.
10327120	10329560	But before we let you go, I gotta put you on the spot too.
10329560	10334960	What is your favorite video game music of all time, or at least one of them?
10334960	10336960	I should have thought about this before I called in.
10336960	10342720	You know, you might not have heard us ask deafness because I was trying to speed dial
10342720	10343720	in.
10343720	10344720	That's all right.
10344720	10345720	Because we asked him too.
10345720	10348180	What was your one of your favorites?
10348180	10349180	You know what?
10349180	10352640	I mean, and it's going to sound kind of because we've been talking about it because I mean,
10352640	10359440	I've kind of and the reason I'm kind of prepping this up is because one of the 21st century
10359440	10362440	orchestra is what we call ourselves because we don't like the term new age.
10362440	10367360	We've been kicking around a video game concert idea because we used to do movie stuff and
10367360	10371840	we've been kicking around doing video game stuff and they've put me in charge of kind
10371840	10376260	of, you know, putting in what we're going to what we would do in this hypothetical concert
10376260	10379700	that's actually probably not going to happen for years now.
10379700	10383920	And actually the one, the piece that would be the most emotional and the most gratifying
10383920	10388820	to play and to be a part of is actually Aerith's Theme.
10388820	10395760	The actual, specifically the More Friends version from the CD that's the fully orchestral
10395760	10397760	and everything.
10397760	10400880	That's actually the first time I shed a tear in a video game.
10400880	10401880	Me too.
10401880	10402880	No.
10402880	10407680	And so it's very powerful from that aspect and the way it would be phrased in the concert
10407680	10413040	is because I know that Square Enix doesn't let people use their footage in concerts that
10413040	10414040	aren't their own.
10414040	10415280	I know all about that.
10415280	10419600	So it would be kind of phrased around, can a video game make you cry?
10419600	10423520	And basically, you know, we'd be showing like fan art and stuff of Aerith's and of that
10423520	10428320	scene with that piece and that was going to be kind of the emotional high point of this
10428320	10429920	theoretical concert.
10429920	10434360	So I'm really going to go with Aerith's Theme just because of what it means.
10434360	10438540	I don't blame you one bit just because it's, there's a reason why it's newsworthy right
10438540	10439540	now.
10439540	10440540	Absolutely.
10440540	10446240	All right, well Bobby, quick, plug your stuff before we let you go.
10446240	10448280	Contrary to popular belief, I do not hate Act Deft.
10448280	10453800	So if you want to listen to somebody who does not actually hate Act Deft, I'm on, before
10453800	10458000	you guys at 8 p.m. Eastern, 5 p.m. Pacific, you're on All Games Radio and the last 10
10458000	10462240	minutes of my show were actually me, you know, fucking around with OLR.
10462240	10463240	So it's a good time.
10463240	10466400	Oh, you can say the F word on our show.
10466400	10467400	You get to swear.
10467400	10469880	It's a side of Bobby you don't normally get to see.
10469880	10472820	I'm sorry I said bitch on your show.
10472820	10473820	That's okay.
10473820	10474820	It's okay.
10474820	10477080	You will get the podcast up again soon, right Bobby?
10477080	10478080	I hope so, yeah.
10478080	10479080	We miss him.
10479080	10480080	All right.
10480080	10481080	All right.
10481080	10482080	Bobby Black Wolf, everybody.
10482080	10483080	Thank you so much for calling in.
10483080	10484080	Have a good one.
10484080	10485080	Capcom fires you.
10485080	10486080	You're fired too.
10486080	10488760	No, hire, hire.
10488760	10489760	Need to hire.
10489760	10490760	You're fired.
10490760	10491760	All right.
10491760	10493840	Anyhow, all right, we got to wrap it up.
10493840	10497960	I know there's some folks that wanted to call and get through, but guys, we have an important
10497960	10499160	live thing happening tonight.
10499160	10501120	We got to get to it before it's like one in the morning.
10501120	10502920	So I got to close up the Skype line.
10502920	10507600	If you didn't get through, tweet us, email us, yell at us in all caps and chat.
10507600	10508600	No, don't do that.
10508600	10510400	But you know ways to get in touch with us.
10510400	10511400	Please do.
10511400	10514240	We want to know your thoughts and we'll share them next week on the show.
10514240	10516520	In the meantime, we've got to wrap things up quickly.
10516520	10518480	One more tweet here from Tiger Claw.
10518480	10521520	Quickly, quickly read this.
10521520	10528440	Robota Vengeance pits robots against genetically modified dinosaurs.
10528440	10532840	It was actually created by an Academy Award winner, Doug Chang.
10532840	10535600	He was the lead designer on Star Wars episode one and two.
10535600	10539160	We'll say what you will about those movies, but at least the special effects were really
10539160	10540720	good for their time.
10540720	10546120	They want to do it as an iOS game that's a full scale rival to Infinity Blade.
10546120	10547120	I guess.
10547120	10548120	Oh, here's the deal.
10548120	10549120	Here it is.
10549120	10550120	It's another Kickstarter.
10550120	10552080	They're trying to raise $100,000 to get Robota.
10552080	10553440	Oh, boy.
10553440	10556240	See, what did I say last week?
10556240	10558720	Nora's box has been opened.
10558720	10561840	This is going to be interesting, but I will say it does sound pretty cool.
10561840	10562840	The little concept.
10562840	10569120	Pre-order your game now by securing your vested share in the development of this game.
10569120	10570680	That's how it's going to be.
10570680	10572080	All right.
10572080	10574960	That's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio, but we could not end
10574960	10579360	the show if we don't go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10579360	10580760	Dark Sakura, we'll start with you.
10580760	10581760	Your final thought tonight.
10581760	10583160	I'm going to read a quote from Buddha.
10583160	10584160	Please do.
10584160	10588120	Give nothing no matter where you read it or who has said it, not even if I have said it
10588120	10593880	unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense.
10593880	10594880	How deep.
10594880	10596200	Loki, your final thought.
10596200	10597200	I hate Myspace.
10597200	10600040	But they've got a million new users.
10600040	10601040	It's noteworthy.
10601040	10606720	Dude, I went back to my page because I was looking through some of the songs I had uploaded
10606720	10610280	there, and you can't download them anymore even though I had it before where you could
10610280	10613280	download them for free because they don't want to give anything away for free.
10613280	10617840	You can share it on your blogs and bullshit like that, and then it pulls up like, hey,
10617840	10622200	I know you want to listen to your music, but how about some shit from somebody else?
10622200	10623280	No.
10623280	10626160	You're not fucking Pandora.
10626160	10627800	Although maybe you are Pandora.
10627800	10630520	Hey, they got to buy it off somebody who's making money.
10630520	10631520	All right.
10631520	10653120	My final thought of the day, everybody, is listen to O-L-R. It's on right after bopping.
10653120	10657720	If you enjoyed what you hear or to hear at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend
10657720	10658720	about the show.
10658720	10660400	Word of mouth is how we get the word out.
10660400	10664080	We don't have a million dollar magazine behind us or website or any of that stuff.
10664080	10665480	It's all about word of mouth.
10665480	10667200	Help the O-L Army grow.
10667200	10669040	Play Terraria with each other.
10669040	10670040	Don't be a dick.
10670040	10671040	We'll see you next week.
10671040	10673040	Have a wonderful, wonderful night.
10673040	10677000	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
