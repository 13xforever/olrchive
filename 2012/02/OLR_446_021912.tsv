10126	12367	Sky, and Loki.
14068	19169	Tonight, February 19th, 2012, Capcom makes the same mistake twice.
19530	25912	Sony plans a movie for one of its franchises, and one company is rumored to be working on a new Ninja Turtles game.
31653	39134	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
39595	47056	We are live on this February the 19th of 2012 with episode number 446 of our show.
47396	56758	We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
57398	58319	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
85083	86765	Wow!
87005	87305	See ya.
88106	88487	Alright.
88807	92791	Also joining us tonight, I don't know if he's caffeinated, but say hello to Tech Master Loki.
93031	93972	I think I'm caffeinated.
94153	95194	This has caffeine in it.
95214	96515	You do have a jumbo little soda.
96555	97396	What soda is that?
97576	98877	It's more ice and soda.
99778	102141	It's the McDonald's ripoff there.
102523	103043	There you go.
104343	106004	So anyway, join us live.
106524	111765	If you are listening live here at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at all games, join our chat room.
112065	118306	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com is where you can interact with us because, of course, it is the show where every gamer has a voice.
118366	120687	We do like to read your voices throughout the show.
120827	123567	We'll take your calls later, read your emails, and all that good stuff.
124447	130009	Looking at our chat, we see some people are celebrating being able to be here live tonight because they have tomorrow off.
130189	132149	And I totally forgot that it's a three-day weekend.
132549	136495	So happy President's Day, I suppose, but I don't have tomorrow off.
136595	136975	Me neither.
137376	137876	Isn't that weird?
138357	139038	I have tomorrow off.
142020	142981	Always ruining my party.
143621	144782	Because I'm fun employed.
145603	146424	You have every day off.
148445	150567	But yeah, what's up with that?
150627	152148	We don't get President's Day off.
152168	153369	I did at my old company, too.
153509	160315	Well, I think the deal is, unless you're a bank or a school or something, your company either does Martin Luther King Day in January, which mine does.
160495	161175	I don't get that either.
161255	161556	Really?
161916	162957	Well, then you just got screwed.
163137	164878	I don't know what to tell you.
165078	169302	One place I was with, we used to get floaters for the major bank holidays.
169761	173386	Yeah, we have what's called a floating holiday, too, in place of Veterans Day.
174067	181997	We don't get Veterans Day off, but we can take a floating holiday anytime during the year, which I usually use to cover my E3 trip, the years I've gone.
182438	184661	I don't know if that'll happen this year, but you know what I'm...
186363	186383	D3
203800	204641	Yeah, yeah, seriously.
204861	206082	I'm at like the Disney convention.
206302	210266	But I am seriously, seriously, I haven't done this convention in four years.
210346	214770	But this year, I really, really, really, of course, so much of this depends on finances.
215111	216252	I want to do PAX this year.
216892	219555	So I'm definitely looking into doing that.
219715	220676	PAX West, of course.
221156	224639	The last PAX I went to was the first PAX East a couple years ago.
224739	226481	I would love to go if someone would finance me.
228002	229484	Well, we don't have OLR funds anymore.
229724	241697	We could do the Kickstarter thing It works for Double Fine Kickstarter so I can go to PAX Donate $20 and DarkSakura will sign your butt There you go At PAX
243960	245441	All right, we'll figure something out.
245941	252423	Anyhow, let's talk games, video games, and this week, of course, the big, big story in gaming, PlayStation Vita.
253443	253863	No one care.
254563	255524	Why do you, come on.
255544	256524	Kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding.
257284	258625	I'm like, are you insane?
258665	259765	You saw that screen, too.
259785	260685	That's a beautiful screen.
260705	261345	It was pretty, but.
261626	262886	That's the first time you've seen the Vita, right?
264086	267268	What I'm referring to, Loki, is an early adopter of the Vita.
267368	269989	The Vita early adopter program started this week.
270329	271749	Very strange for a console launch.
271769	276611	I don't remember any console doing this before, but it's the whole like, pay an extra $50 and get it a week early.
278152	280833	Yeah, you get like a case and a crappy game.
281133	283194	And yeah, Little Deviants is not a good game.
283394	283574	Yeah.
284394	285995	It's a terrible game, to be honest.
286035	287996	Yeah, I have not heard a good thing about Little Deviants.
288276	290677	So what made you take the plunge to get the early Vita?
290697	290777	Yeah.
291457	292898	I just wanted the Vita.
293078	300985	I decided I was going to sell my 3DS, and so I did that, and I bought a Vita, and I'm glad I did.
301245	304908	I think I'm going to get a lot more use out of this than I will ever my 3DS.
305389	307530	What is making you think those early signs?
309352	311813	With the 3DS, it was just kind of like, ooh, 3D.
312134	314215	And then that kind of wore off really fast.
314755	318978	And then it was like, ooh, it's just a DS with an analog stick.
321019	324101	I just didn't really play anything on there.
324802	329525	I played a couple of the launch games, which are kind of like, okay, Pilotwings, fun.
330265	334988	Or Street Fighter was all right, but it wasn't really kind of something I...
336249	337690	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
362501	366324	I mean, I was afraid that it was going to go kind of the way of the Wii.
366684	368666	You just didn't have enough people to swap note with.
368826	369546	That was the problem.
369646	371548	You needed more 3D cats in your life.
371968	374690	I just added like three chatters to my 3DS friends list tonight.
374710	375911	In fact, I need to send them cats.
376331	380294	As soon as I get the confirmation that they've all added me back, 3D cats.
380694	382415	That's why you hang on to the 3DS.
382876	383516	Swap note.
383997	384757	Revolutionary.
385718	386619	No, no.
387859	388320	I'm sorry.
388800	389581	That's not why.
389681	391122	It's like 3D email.
392705	397726	And then the virtual console stuff is kind of cool, but once again, it's like, okay, yeah, neat.
398566	400867	I can play NES games on another system.
401987	405388	But I don't really need to play NES games.
405448	414990	If I really want to play Nintendo games, I can play them on my PC, I can play them on my Wii, I can play them on almost anything, my PSP.
416090	429486	Well, for me, I wanted to hang on to the 3DS mostly because a system is only as good as the games that are on it, and I know you are not as invested in the lineup, but remember, I thought Mario 3D Land was one of the best games that came out last year.
429506	436113	I put it in my top three for the year, and I think it's a fantastic game, and I don't really want to part with it yet, and I don't know, like I'm...
437014	441698	Nintendo is getting really good at this whole stealthy launch.
441778	445421	I think at E3 there's going to be some more titles that are announced that will be bang up.
445501	446602	I'm hoping the Smash Bros.
446642	446882	game.
448243	448764	But we'll see.
448824	449805	I'm not going to get my hopes up.
450165	454508	I'm not really... I'm not worried about the Smash Bros.
454548	454689	game.
454989	456330	If I really want a Smash Bros.
456350	458692	game like that, I can play it on the Wii U or something.
459032	460073	And honestly, Smash Bros.
460093	463496	was fun for a while on the Wii, and then I just didn't play it anymore.
463716	464777	So I'm not...
466488	468049	I don't know, I just don't see myself doing that.
488986	504637	Walk us through a little bit of opening up the Vita for the first time, because my understanding is, A, it doesn't function at all like a PlayStation, because the cross-media bar's not there, and B, it has this whole, like, welcome park or something it's called that's supposed to orient you to the system?
505037	507378	I have not even touched that yet, to be honest.
507418	508019	All right, fine.
508579	510020	But yeah, there's the welcome park thing.
510160	518646	Basically, as with most, like, systems out there nowadays, when you first get the Vita, you have to do a system update.
519867	523169	So you perform the system update and you update to 1.6.
524229	528812	And then you set up everything, your PlayStation Network stuff, if you have an account or whatever.
529213	534236	I had to reset the password on mine because it had been so long since I logged into the PlayStation Network.
534756	539019	I had forgotten my password, although I hadn't really forgotten my password.
539079	543742	It was just forcing me to reset my password because I apparently haven't.
544102	548885	No, actually, no, I must have reset my password at one point because I downloaded those.
548905	551166	Sorry, we broke the PlayStation Network for a month.
552127	557490	I had trouble recalling my password after that, too, because they had so many freaking rules on the password.
557990	566755	I had to think of something that fell into those because my old password, without trying to give it away, well, I don't use it anymore, but it broke one of the rules.
566995	568376	So I had to really think.
568735	570416	Well, I finally remembered what it was.
570497	573119	It was just, there was a capital letter in there somewhere.
573179	574800	So I was like, ah, okay, I forgot.
575901	577062	So I went ahead and did that.
577302	578904	And so I got that all taken care of.
579504	586090	And then I pretty much, what I did, because I actually got it on Valentine's Day.
586910	588912	Because, you know, I'm cool like that.
589452	594597	And so there wasn't really much on the PlayStation Network store to download.
594837	595638	I mean, it was...
596738	597078	and so on.
621124	621804	It's gorgeous.
622225	623686	That was the first thing I noticed.
623766	628508	You know, the screen's just amazing looking, and the touchscreen stuff works great.
629609	632491	You know, I don't even really care that it's the little bubbles on there.
632511	637654	I mean, it's... Just the way it functions is really smooth, so that's kind of cool.
639455	644958	The near thing's neat, although I'm not really sure what the point of it is yet.
645098	648600	I mean, I know I unlocked some things, and I can see some random people around there, and I get...
648940	653385	I get these really off-the-wall random friend requests and I don't even know who these people are.
653405	656749	Is it because you're showing up on the near thing or whatever it's called?
657050	657971	Yeah, I think it is.
658291	658732	Interesting.
658932	659653	I don't know who they are.
660013	664759	Like, someone sent me a message like, okay, maybe it's gonna say, hey, I'm Alyssa or something and it was like, sup?
665019	666341	I'm like, that doesn't fucking help.
666521	667582	I don't know who you are.
670164	671365	Yeah, that's a good point.
671905	676607	If that whole random stuff's going to happen and you want to add us on PlayStation Network, you might want to say you're a listener.
676647	681930	That way we know you're not a random... Does that thing show where you live?
682970	684111	It's not going to give that away, right?
684151	686472	No, it'll say you're... And it's not even...
686812	687712	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
704961	705821	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
720180	731011	Um, you, well, you can see, like, popularity of certain games, like, it'll change, you know, um, like, oh, okay, you know, Katamari's, you know, going up, or, I don't know.
731031	735595	What, what, what is popular in your town, Orangevale, or whatever?
735655	742562	I don't even know, it, well, it just shows, seems to show the stuff that I have, like, I'm gonna pull it up right now, and we'll see what's popular right here.
744003	748724	Just going to our chatroom at chat.orange.com, Tigerclaw says, Sky on swap note now.
749085	752065	Yes, I saw that all the chatters added me, so I sent some cat pictures.
752206	755867	Now, Tigerclaw, because you were already on my list, you already saw these same notes.
755927	757407	I went back and sent some old notes.
757427	761388	Because I don't have new 3D cat pictures, but I will get some soon.
762168	763469	So there's your 3D cat update.
763549	764049	Back to the Vita.
764568	765409	Thanks for watching!
782010	783551	and showing popularity surge.
783571	785513	There are five people playing Katamari.
786333	791536	Topping the charts, the number of people for Lil Deviants.
792557	799721	And topping the charts, 18 people playing Lil Deviants and Katamari, Luminous.
800182	804545	I think it's just showing the stuff I've played because that's what it seems like that's happening there.
805485	807066	Daredevil Onion
834662	837063	Somebody, they sent me like a track part.
837644	839925	That sounds like what DarkSakura had for lunch today.
839965	844527	So I will download your track part, but I don't know who that is, so that doesn't really help me.
847769	854152	Yeah, so, I mean, I still don't really know what the functionality of this is supposed to be.
854292	863117	I can see some people that are playing nearby, but I just don't really understand what this is all about yet.
865060	865542	Oh, here we go.
865583	867812	I think I can... Units of distance.
867892	868414	There we go.
869950	871551	I knew you could get it in Miles.
871832	872392	There you go.
873293	874213	So, there's that.
875154	877516	Tell us a little bit about the games, quickly.
877876	879777	You've played Rayman.
880078	881599	You were raving about the graphics in Rayman, right?
881619	883560	Rayman I actually haven't played too much of yet.
884101	886983	I just like, ooh, pretty graphics and I went on and played something else.
887403	890025	But yeah, Rayman's really, really gorgeous.
890065	895910	I mean, Rayman Origins on the console looked great and I'd say it's exactly like the console.
895930	898251	I mean, that level of detail is there and it's just...
899612	899912	I got Luminous
920903	926406	Although you can just spam the back of your system to unlock it as well.
926546	928827	So I don't really know that point of that.
929247	930368	The music in it is alright.
930568	932208	Although most of it I don't recognize.
932389	934710	And most of it isn't as epic as I thought it would be.
935250	938631	But there's some still good ones in there.
938671	942673	Like there's... What was it?
943154	944454	Window Licker is in there.
944834	945515	And that's awesome.
946015	947536	And there's some other...
950046	951527	Some other songs that I've recognized.
951687	956792	Yeah, I heard something about a whole new kind of block that will shuffle block colors around it.
957072	961295	Yeah, there's a block that will shuffle some of the stuff on there.
961335	963197	There's also the blocks that you can drop.
963777	973445	Well, the power-up that you start off with the default avatar allows you to... It'll break anything of the same color that's touching it.
973665	974326	So you can...
975026	976648	You know, eliminate a lot of stuff on there.
976668	979271	Which was the old Luminous game, if I remember right.
979291	980292	Yes, I think they have that.
982194	983256	So, I mean, it's fun.
983476	984036	I like the game.
984517	990944	And I actually played it one round for a good three hours, I think, the other day.
990964	994729	That seems to be getting the best reviews out of all the Vita games, is Luminous, which doesn't surprise me.
995429	997011	It's the PSP all over again.
1015371	1036263	some of them though have this weird fish eye thing to them where it kind of the screen bends a little bit and it's just really disorienting it's it's frustrating because i don't like i don't like the look of it i guess it's part of the challenge maybe it's not even really a challenge it's just like okay this song has this skin it's just it's dumb
1036943	1037883	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1060111	1073117	and then of course I also played Touch My Katamari which it must have been a while since I played other Katamari games because the levels seem new to me but I hear that they're not.
1073237	1075378	I hear they're just repeats of the old game again.
1076138	1076578	Thanks for watching!
1098143	1099404	It's almost like impossible.
1099964	1101845	I think maybe some of the controls in there.
1102386	1105807	But the way they've done the controls are kind of weird.
1106368	1110450	They have everything mapped to buttons, which is nice because I don't like a lot of the touchscreen stuff.
1110970	1117634	Like having to use the back panel to flip my Konamari around or jump.
1118154	1120495	That's mapped to the shoulder buttons as well.
1121556	1125318	And then to do the charge, you either have to hold the touchscreen on the front...
1126558	1152519	or you spin your um your analog sticks around in a certain direction and it I don't know neither way seems to work very well and that's kind of sad it's just it's really bad and at the same time it's like hmm yeah that's cool that you mapped that to the analog sticks and yet you have all these face buttons you're not using at all like none of the face buttons are used in the game
1154101	1156943	Maybe they overdid it from people's complaints about the PSP game.
1157163	1165970	But they could have either had it where you map your own custom buttons, or they could have had it where, okay, Dash is now one of the buttons on the face.
1166090	1167952	I mean, how hard would that have been?
1168292	1175438	You added multiple stuff for the other buttons in the game, but, oh, let's just not map it to the face buttons because that makes sense.
1176071	1178974	Before you get to another game, let me read some comments from chat.
1179074	1184760	Ahamkara in our chatroom says, I find the Vita annoying already.
1184860	1186841	I tried one at an Evil G in my area.
1186942	1192126	In some menus, you have multiple choices on screen, but you have to touch to choose to proceed.
1192567	1193768	No buttons are used.
1193828	1195910	You know, I had that same problem once.
1196070	1200254	When I went to Evil G, yes, I set foot in one to play it as well.
1200355	1205400	I forgot that it had a touchscreen because I associate the touchscreen thing with Apple and Nintendo.
1205620	1206341	I just forgot.
1206701	1208703	And I'm sitting there in the menu for Mod Nation Racers.
1208743	1211066	I'm like, why can't I play the goddamn game?
1211306	1212207	It's not a big deal.
1212407	1212727	Yeah, I know.
1212807	1214289	Once I figured it out, I'm like, oh, yeah.
1214469	1216351	It's actually really nice using the touchscreen.
1216491	1222414	A really interesting point that was brought up was that it does add a barrier for accessibility.
1222654	1234099	I have a blind friend on Twitter that follows that's like, this is limiting my accessibility because a blind person can use the buttons and everything but might not necessarily know where to touch on the screen to use the menus.
1235000	1237841	Especially in the main menus and all that.
1238141	1246346	Well, here's the problem with the main menus, too, is that they can be... All those buttons, just like you can on the iOS and stuff, they can all be rearranged.
1246647	1255552	So, you know, it may not... And when you get stuff installed, it might not exactly be in the right order that you're thinking it's going to be in.
1256073	1257153	So, I don't know.
1257233	1259295	They could easily add a button...
1259875	1267427	You know, or patch it in later on, but it's going to be kind of difficult because icons can get added left and right.
1267487	1272375	I don't know, unless you can change the sound effect that when you select a certain one, it sounds different.
1272435	1272755	I don't know.
1272795	1274238	Well, usually, I mean, think about it.
1274398	1275079	It's really...
1275219	1275759	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1295376	1297018	It's very, very sound oriented.
1297058	1301824	Like, I know fighting games are very popular because you use the sound cues a lot in those games.
1301864	1305768	Like, isn't there a YouTube out there of some blind guy just fucking regulating on Soul Calibur?
1306189	1306869	I seem to remember.
1307310	1308151	And it's all sound.
1308948	1309208	Maybe.
1334941	1335442	Thanks for watching!
1358562	1359582	Make some fucking sense.
1361103	1365664	The other thing I don't really care for about the Vita is sometimes it's very uncomfortable to hold the system.
1366065	1370426	Like, for example, the next game, which I got, which is funny because it's a full game.
1370946	1372647	I didn't anticipate it being a full game.
1373207	1380169	Apparently, when the system launched, they had, like I said, demos that came up, Ubisoft demos and stuff.
1380189	1384851	And one of the games I did want to check out was Michael Jackson The Experience because it's a rhythm music game.
1385231	1386092	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1408312	1410114	I don't think so.
1410915	1415200	But you can go to websites and you can just hit the guide button, boof, go to a website.
1415260	1416842	Okay, I need to look up a fact on this game.
1417182	1420727	Look it up, whatever, and then switch back to your game again and take off.
1421548	1424171	But yeah, Michael Jackson Experience, actually a pretty fun music game.
1425252	1426253	But here's the ironic part.
1426994	1429935	The demo, originally when they first put it up, was the full game.
1430755	1431096	Oops!
1432476	1441339	So there was a few mix-ups where it was allowing you to download the full game for a few hours.
1441459	1444160	So I have the full game of Michael Jackson, the experience.
1444280	1445020	I didn't pay for it.
1445080	1446201	I still earned trophies from it.
1446441	1448962	I just can't sync them because I didn't actually purchase the game.
1449442	1450342	But I don't care.
1450402	1452063	Interesting that it knows that.
1453318	1456900	If I rent games from Gamefly or something, will I be able to do my trophies?
1457180	1458281	Yeah, you will be able to.
1458301	1459602	Oh, because I have the physical cartridge.
1459622	1460783	Yeah, you have the physical cartridge.
1461003	1468288	I have the digital download, so since it doesn't show that I have the actual full game, I don't have whatever it is to sync it.
1468468	1471710	Great question from Tigerclaw in our chat room at chat.orange.radio.com.
1471730	1473331	Does the Vita have an internet radio player?
1474572	1475973	Does PSP have one?
1476053	1476813	I don't think so.
1476893	1480115	And we had that olrpsp.com, which technically is still there.
1480155	1481917	It hasn't been updated in a very long time.
1482757	1483537	Yeah, whatever.
1484778	1487058	We need an olrvita.com.
1488999	1493361	I tried going to the All Games page today, and it did not play the radio player.
1493601	1495681	So it might not do HTML5.
1495881	1497302	Yeah, probably not.
1497382	1497982	Is it Flash?
1498082	1499883	I think allgames.com is Flash.
1499943	1500783	It's HTML5 now.
1500823	1501023	Is it?
1501443	1502664	Yeah, so it doesn't.
1502864	1503824	I don't think it does that.
1504404	1506205	Oh yeah, because it works on my iPhone.
1506225	1508427	I think you can very easily add an app for that.
1508547	1511489	I mean, I haven't really messed... Well, let's click music.
1512230	1515552	I haven't even really tried the music part yet because I don't have any music on here.
1516132	1521176	But, uh... What, you mean you're not downloading episodes of OLR to your phone or your PSP?
1521596	1523878	Dude, I have a 4 gig card.
1523958	1525579	It would fill that thing up really fast.
1525599	1526300	That's true, that's true.
1528101	1529242	So, no, I don't have that.
1530002	1533365	No, it doesn't look like it has a radio player in there, which is fine, you know.
1533685	1533785	Um...
1534795	1535816	That could be added later on.
1535956	1536836	Easy.
1538698	1547243	If there's a way to easily get OLR episodes in the PlayStation Vita, though, for those who do have bigger memory cards, I'm all about get the show out there however we can do it.
1548904	1549545	I'm all for that.
1550632	1550852	All right.
1550872	1552774	Well, anyway, we talked about the Vita an awfully long time.
1553614	1558758	So what do you hope to most see from the system in the future?
1560699	1561100	More games.
1561400	1563762	I mean, there's a lot of games coming out already for it.
1564222	1565903	And a lot of games I'm looking forward to.
1565923	1570387	You know, new Resistance game, Gravity Rush looks awesome.
1570807	1570907	And
1572821	1592700	I was trying to download the demo for it on my PS3 because I have a Japanese account and a UK account and stuff like that for getting multi-region demos, but they won't let you put them on the Vita because you can only download demos for the account that's on the Vita because that's stuck to one account, not multiple accounts.
1592760	1594922	If I could put multiple accounts on there, I could have
1595543	1601734	Demos from all regions, which have been awesome because they also have the Twitter app over there and the Flickr app already out in Japan.
1601855	1604420	It's just not over here yet until Wednesday.
1604921	1606564	Oh yeah, I forget those things have cameras on them.
1607333	1608714	Yeah, they're not very good.
1609154	1612255	It's about as good as the 3DS.
1613276	1620059	I really wish they'd have a bigger camera, but I understand their thing was it's gameplay first, you know, camera is just like, eh, whatever.
1620639	1622200	But yeah, it has a front and back camera.
1622760	1622980	Weird.
1624021	1625641	And here's the other thing that kind of sucks about it.
1625962	1627282	The AR games aren't up yet.
1628103	1630604	So they have these cards that don't do anything at the moment.
1631224	1631744	Not yet.
1631824	1632445	But they will.
1632625	1633686	They will on Wednesday.
1634126	1637608	And I'm trying to think what else is kind of cool.
1639329	1646694	Yeah, the Welcome Park stuff, I haven't played it yet, but it's a bunch of little mini-games that get you acclimated to the features of the Vita, and you can earn trophies from it.
1646935	1648115	So that's kind of something.
1648916	1660984	And I would recommend, if you're thinking about getting a system and thinking about getting a memory card, you probably want more than four gigs, because even just trying out some demos and stuff, it fills up the card really fast.
1663045	1689704	but 8 gigs probably probably good alright well I know that was extensive but you know new system launch week what can you do I will be getting mine Wednesday I'm really looking forward to it I've only gotten to play with one a little bit I'm getting Luminous and Katamari so I'll tell you my impressions next week Dark Sakura I know one's not in the cards for you right away but you were thinking about it a little bit but you want an iPad more huh I really want the iPad 3 cause you can do more design stuff on that
1690003	1690704	DarkSakura.com
1712496	1715320	Uh, it was pretty eventful, I mean, relatively.
1715660	1717823	Dan and I played a lot of Bubble Bobble this morning.
1717843	1719746	A lot of Bubble Bobble.
1720066	1720867	I suck at it.
1720907	1721888	Old school classic.
1721928	1722329	What system?
1722349	1723190	Because it was on everything.
1723210	1725853	We played the PS1 collection, but on our PS3.
1726854	1731020	Oh god, is that the one that came with, uh, it was like Bubble Bobble and it had...
1731565	1733586	Rainbow Islands and the Rainbow Islands Deluxe.
1733866	1734807	Oh, I thought there was another one.
1734847	1735967	No, because that was a Capcom game.
1735987	1736587	What am I thinking?
1736707	1746492	I'm thinking of that game where you shoot the arrow up and it explodes the bubbles and it creates like a chain at the top of the screen and anything that hits it explodes too.
1746512	1746992	Puzzle Bobble?
1747192	1747572	No, no, no, no.
1747612	1748153	Buster Move?
1748473	1749373	No, it's Capcom.
1749773	1750794	It was an old arcade game.
1750874	1751674	Somebody in chat would yell it out.
1751694	1752534	Buster Brothers?
1752554	1753495	Buster Brothers, that's it.
1753835	1754015	No.
1755437	1756278	Well, yet now I know.
1756859	1761364	I don't know why I tied those two games together in my mind because they weren't even the same company, but Bubbles.
1762212	1771236	No, we played Bubble Bobble a little bit today, and I was very alarmed that my friend who was over there at the time had never ever seen it.
1772317	1773097	And he's my age.
1773978	1775258	How do you not know the song, at least?
1775278	1777059	What planet were you born on?
1778100	1780861	So, um, and I played WoW.
1781761	1782882	Of course you played WoW, Abby.
1782902	1788464	And I played a lot of Bust a Move on my phone, which I broke down and bought another puzzle pack.
1789945	1791546	Who in the world does not know this song?
1794793	1797154	That's like one of the best ones.
1797174	1799856	Yeah, this is the best one.
1800016	1800556	Sing along!
1800576	1808340	Ah, now it'll be stuck in your head all day.
1808941	1810461	And the person next to you on the bus is looking at you funny.
1810481	1811162	I was making up lyrics to it.
1811782	1812102	Were you?
1812362	1812622	Yeah.
1813703	1816324	Have you ever watched that if video game themes had lyrics?
1817585	1818205	No, I haven't.
1818325	1819466	I've heard of it, though.
1819606	1820367	Those are funny.
1821067	1822828	Actually, what's my favorite?
1824437	1826939	Listen to Orange Lounge Radio on Sunday night.
1827019	1829021	It's on All Games Radio.
1830322	1832344	I was actually just singing Bubble Bobble as the words.
1832884	1837008	Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble.
1837208	1837408	Yeah.
1838629	1840371	So, that was it.
1840951	1847214	You know, games back in the day didn't really have extensive soundtracks, you know?
1847574	1850996	Like, they started to late in the NES era, like, especially a game like Final Fantasy or something.
1851036	1855998	But a lot of those old games had, like, one little riff that would play through the whole damn game.
1856038	1856999	So it had to be addicting.
1857539	1863302	Oh, there's one other game that actually I was looking for that I don't think I have on PC Engine that I want is Son Son 2.
1865146	1869187	Sonsun is a fun little side-scroller, and I found myself wishing today that I had a copy.
1870448	1871128	And that's it.
1871428	1871808	Good times.
1872529	1877811	Loki, I know you've already talked extensively about the Vita, but opening it up to whatever you've been playing this week, is there anything else to share?
1878771	1879211	Call of Duty.
1879571	1881632	My co-workers are starting to get really mad at me.
1882772	1884513	Hasn't that been the running theme for how long now?
1884838	1896783	Yeah, well, thankfully my other co-worker comes back off of his paternity leave, so at least there'll be someone else to play, but yeah, they're getting mad.
1897683	1903086	They had a conference in a, or they had a little group meeting in the conference room.
1903726	1909668	I'm trying to think of one of the funny... Oh, yeah.
1910349	1915751	Of course, they know that there's people that play professional StarCraft in Korea.
1916091	1924254	Of course, they mucked it up when they were doing the... Why don't you just go to... We're just going to send you to Korea to play competitive World of Warcraft.
1924334	1925835	I'm like, okay.
1925995	1926315	Well...
1926855	1930338	If you want to get technical, Arena is a big thing they do at BlizzCon.
1931239	1938124	And I don't know if Korea is necessarily the big... I think that's... Europe is really... There's a lot of teams in Europe.
1938144	1939705	The biggest raiding guilds are all over there.
1940686	1945590	I mean, it's just... It's just funny.
1945950	1947472	Anything else for your gaming week that you want to share?
1949013	1949433	That's it.
1950093	1950334	All right.
1950394	1951074	My gaming week.
1952395	1955077	Not a whole, whole, whole lot, but some new stuff.
1955257	1956578	I, of course, been playing WoW.
1956658	1958719	I'm on a rating team in WoW now, so it's a little different.
1959059	1964383	By the way, speaking of Warcraft, Horde House is coming back this week, which is exciting because we've been gone for a month.
1964463	1967445	We've just, we kind of suffered from burnout a little bit.
1967545	1970167	And as you guys know, my co-host is on hiatus from WoW.
1970587	1973609	But, and I just want to quell Shinny fears.
1973809	1975971	Extifer and I will both be on the new show.
1976011	1976691	So don't worry about that.
1976751	1977772	Nobody got fired or nothing.
1978112	1981557	But it's going to be a little different and you'll have to tune in this week to find out how.
1981977	1987304	But one of the things I'll be able to talk more about is like a legit rating because I've been doing more of that and more PvP.
1988125	1988785	So lots of WoW.
1989106	1991689	But I, believe it or not, have had a life outside of WoW.
1992110	1993912	A lot of it centers around the PlayStation 3.
1994392	1995073	I decided...
1996935	2020293	and I'm gonna get shit for this I already know it but I decided to take the plunge and sign up for PlayStation Plus this week um and I think the catalyst that did it for me was the fact that the Simpsons arcade game was free with PlayStation Plus and it really made me stop and think damn they are giving out free games all the freaking time on PlayStation Plus and especially if I've invested in the Vita and so forth I'm getting all these minis why the heck not
2020413	2021094	I'm just going to get it.
2021214	2024637	Now, yes, before you guys... I know people are typing it in chat already.
2024938	2025478	I already know.
2025658	2030583	If I stop paying for PlayStation Plus, I'm fully aware you lose access to all these games.
2030924	2032565	That's kind of the catalyst to it all.
2032605	2033346	But then I was thinking...
2034674	2038696	How many freaking games have I bought on Xbox Live Arcade?
2039216	2039956	Hint, a lot.
2040576	2041657	That I really don't play anymore.
2041957	2045238	That if I lost access to it today, I'd be like, eh, oh well.
2045658	2048439	You know, despite the fact that I paid five or ten dollars when I first got it.
2048799	2053701	You know, so I'm not, like, I fully realize that going into this deal.
2053741	2055562	That I might lose access to these games later on.
2055882	2061704	But it's giving me the chance to really sample things that otherwise might not be worth a full download.
2062384	2064386	For example, Simpsons arcade game.
2064746	2065287	Okay, here's the thing.
2065947	2070331	We've all been wanting this game on the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live forever.
2070572	2072053	I even want to say we did a list list.
2072153	2072774	It's on iPhone.
2073054	2073755	A long, long time.
2074535	2076737	A reimagining is on the iPhone.
2076777	2077318	Tricky, tricky.
2077558	2079200	Because EA has the license now.
2079720	2086366	So the one that's on the iPhone is inspired by the arcade game, but it's not exactly the arcade game.
2087267	2087967	and I'll see you next time.
2107759	2108459	Probably not.
2109460	2112761	So if I decide not to renew PlayStation Plus after three months, I lose it.
2113301	2118402	Yeah, I know, but it's not... Look, the stages and stuff are different.
2118923	2123104	They know that people want the Simpsons arcade game on the phone, but EA didn't do the Simpsons arcade game.
2123124	2123644	Konami did.
2124284	2125785	This one's put out... Oh, that's right.
2125965	2126105	Yep.
2126605	2128426	And the one that's on Network is Konami.
2130208	2131969	Yeah, Jvmon says the same thing in chat.
2132009	2134970	Sky, you've bought hundreds of dollars in XBLA games you've played once.
2135490	2136170	Absolutely right.
2136770	2141852	Kaijudo says, Rob, if all you wanted was Simpsons Arcade game, you could have just bought it for the same price as PSN+.
2142212	2147734	Yes, that's true, but then I thought, you know, why not get some of the extra other games?
2147854	2150215	And I got two other games, too, already.
2151075	2155836	One of them was this kind of basic bitch monkey ball clone game.
2155876	2156977	It's called Hamster Ball.
2157797	2161999	But it not only had a Monkey Ball clone, but it had a Marble Madness clone.
2162180	2163200	And I started playing that.
2163220	2165121	There's two different types of versions.
2165141	2165541	That's pretty cool.
2165622	2167022	And one of them was a Marble Madness clone.
2167042	2168903	I was like, okay, this is kind of cool.
2169204	2174206	Because Marble Madness is one of those games I kind of forgot was out there, but I really did love that game.
2174607	2177288	And to be playing this, I was like, what the hell does this remind me of?
2177768	2179229	Oh shit, it's Marble Madness.
2179249	2180310	And I was like, okay.
2180590	2181551	Okay, Hamster Ball.
2181971	2182691	I'm on to you.
2183251	2184092	So that was kind of neat.
2184132	2184912	And I didn't pay for it.
2186373	2198519	and then I got a game called Battle Fantasia which was a very chibi RPG-ish fighting game where you actually have hit points and you know, not a game I probably would have checked out otherwise but it's neat and I didn't pay anything for it.
2198979	2204342	So, going to our chat at chat.orangelawstudio.com Where is it?
2204382	2204722	Rama.
2204802	2208704	Rama said, PlayStation Plus, a fool and their money is soon parted.
2209484	2209765	Well...
2210765	2211625	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2234898	2235700	XBOX Live Online Gaming
2242489	2244170	Which is on PlayStation Network for free.
2244370	2249112	Anyway, you know, Xbox isn't exactly giving away games or any of this stuff.
2249172	2253675	So, I mean, I really am starting to question why the hell am I hanging on to an Xbox Live Gold account?
2253755	2256916	I don't play anything on Xbox Live right now that isn't a Kinect game.
2258117	2260838	Don't get me wrong, I love Dance Central and Rhythm Party and all that.
2260978	2264120	I'm hanging on to Xbox Live Gold because I've already paid for it.
2264160	2264540	I know.
2264780	2267021	Why has Konami made a game called Fish Kebab?
2268142	2268602	Because they...
2270884	2272186	I have weird stuff.
2272566	2274509	Not meaning to derail, I was just looking through it.
2274970	2275090	Ugh.
2275931	2276612	Okay, so, well...
2278922	2306589	I'm not going to give you shit because it's your money and you can do what the fuck you want with it so let me know how it works out I will I mean I think it's neat that you get the minis and all that and BlackWolfInChat says it amuses me to always hear I didn't pay for it when you got access to it by paying for it okay blah blah blah whatever fine but again I've already probably got more value out of this than I have my year of Xbox Live so far yeah really do we get free games each month with Xbox Live no
2308809	2310795	I mean, we get discounts sometimes.
2311457	2313703	But they're not free, because you paid for it.
2314104	2314766	That's true.
2317068	2318149	I have that Castlevania game on my iPhone.
2318169	2318809	I haven't tried it.
2319129	2319769	It's interesting.
2319789	2321850	Castlevania Puzzle, Encore of the Night.
2321951	2322431	It's weird.
2323551	2324132	Alright, anyhow.
2324532	2325132	So you know what?
2325212	2326253	I did it.
2326733	2329734	I just did three months, so I was like, you know, if I don't want to do it.
2329755	2335798	And I already turned off the auto-subscription thing, because it tries to make you turn it on, but you just go in and turn it off, and there you go.
2335898	2337358	Which is already a plus.
2337378	2344182	Which is already, yeah, something you can't do on the 360, so again... Without taking a...
2346339	2349541	A trip to India via the telephone.
2350841	2352022	So there you go.
2352082	2353502	All right, that's enough of my gaming week.
2354423	2359985	So let's talk housekeeping real quick, of which I don't have a whole lot, but I will, of course, mention the Facebook and the Twitters.
2360385	2362266	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2362286	2363006	We're also on Twitter.
2363046	2364447	Twitter.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2365347	2369670	Twitter.com slash OLR and we're on Google Plus under Orange Lounge Radio.
2369830	2370530	No URL there.
2370610	2374313	Question for you since you use your PlayStation 3 more than I do.
2375954	2380617	Your PlayStation 3, you can set it up to where your trophy stuff gets posted to Facebook, right?
2381177	2381337	Yeah.
2381597	2381797	Okay.
2382078	2387141	You can do that with the Vita too, but I obviously did not set that up because I don't want to spam my...
2388302	2403433	Well, all somebody has to do is block the application, but I actually kind of enjoy reading it because it tells me, like, I leave it unblocked and I don't mind people posting those because it tells me what games my friends are playing and a lot of times I'll see so-and-so is playing this game and I'll be like, is this any good?
2404214	2405355	And I get the same thing.
2405435	2412680	Like, I posted trophies from Simpsons arcade game and somebody was like, so is it more nostalgia or is it actually fun?
2413060	2414862	And I was kind of like, well, it's a little bit of both.
2416162	2419043	So, you know, I do actually like the trophy spam.
2419384	2421865	But thank heavens on Facebook you can easily block it.
2422665	2424225	And it won't upgrade you to Timeline.
2424866	2425166	Yay.
2427487	2429507	Won't upgrade you to Timeline?
2429587	2431948	Yeah, like all these apps won't upgrade you to Timeline now.
2432248	2436950	Like you try to use Hulu or Pinterest, it's all, you can install this app, but it'll upgrade you to Timeline.
2438111	2441232	The whole Facebook Timeline horrible page, I can't stand it.
2441992	2443933	I don't subscribe to anything anymore on Facebook.
2444724	2445765	Yeah, I already see.
2445845	2447046	I was in Timeline before.
2447106	2448627	I was in Timeline back in September.
2449427	2450428	So you're already stuck with it.
2450728	2451128	I hate it.
2451248	2452649	I hate looking at those Timeline pages.
2452809	2454611	Like, some's on the left and some's on the right.
2454671	2455151	It's weird.
2455471	2457353	I don't look at my page anymore, though.
2457913	2458894	I only look at my feed.
2461255	2461555	All right.
2461655	2463697	Let's move on with some actual gaming news, Loki.
2463877	2469401	So Sony's spending a lot of money to promote the Vita, which is kind of funny because I have yet to see any advertisements for the Vita.
2470041	2470421	So...
2472822	2480575	I don't know where this $50 million is going, but I'm assuming that they're going to start playing commercials after the system comes out, which is a little odd, but okay.
2481116	2484462	And there's a few commercials floating around, I guess, on the internet, but...
2486329	2511080	um so anyways yeah part of it's of course the hashtag uh game changer on twitter which i mean i don't know whatever um and they have hashtags for everything and like hashtags for people posting comments during the Whitney Houston funeral which my wife watched by the way part of it at least so boring but yeah i mean they're used for everything um
2513162	2520306	And of course, there's the huge Twitter campaign and I'm assuming lots of TV stuff.
2521147	2522768	Probably like the PlayStation 3 was.
2523608	2524168	It'll be interesting.
2524188	2526550	They're definitely working that out.
2526790	2529331	And of course, like some of the first party...
2530692	2537858	PlayStation 3 titles, the PlayStation Passes are making their way to the Vita as well.
2538198	2545044	Two games that launched that do have an online pass would be Hot Shots Golf World Invitational and Wipeout 2048.
2545144	2548787	Why those titles are the only ones that have online passes?
2549148	2551610	Those are the only ones that actually have online multiplayer.
2551970	2552751	Simultaneous.
2555133	2558936	Mod Nation Racers does not have simultaneous multiplayer.
2559116	2567620	They have this fancy term called asynchronous multiplayer, which means you download someone's ghost run and you race against that.
2567760	2569221	There is no multiplayer in that game.
2570101	2573743	Alpha Cananagram in our chatroom says, I've seen ads for the Vita for the U.S.
2573863	2574423	They suck.
2575244	2576124	Also, one of the U.S.
2576164	2578986	commercials shows 3G gaming when you can't game on 3G.
2581320	2604274	you can you can game but you can't game over 3G maybe it's showing up on things like maybe it's playing on ESPN or something you don't really watch maybe that's what the commercials are you know I don't watch a lot of TV either so it's possible but I mean I don't know I was watching Comedy Central the other day and I didn't see anything but then again I don't watch a lot of TV so maybe
2604705	2616416	Alpha Cananagram in our chat room continued at chat.orangelunchradio.com saying, Also, I heard another one showed someone playing it outside with good screen quality, but I think screen can't do that in sunlight, IRL, so it's sort of false advertising.
2616456	2617777	How does that thing react in sunlight?
2617797	2618058	I don't know.
2618078	2618858	I haven't played it outside.
2619659	2620300	Go outside!
2623305	2623645	DarkSakura.com
2643052	2652196	Waiting for that guy to get hit by a cab as he crosses the street because some fucking idiot walking around playing a game, you know, looking down.
2652216	2654037	It's just stupid.
2654057	2656478	I could see myself walking outside, taking a walk around the lake.
2656538	2657978	I'd just fall right in.
2658018	2660439	The other thing I do like about the Vita... I've seen you do the phone stumble.
2661480	2661760	Shush.
2662179	2662639	PSP have auto-correct?
2685540	2695829	I do kind of want to try Wipeout, but I got frustrated at the first Wipeout game.
2695869	2697971	It's just not my thing.
2698231	2700934	A little too fast and just kind of weird.
2701354	2705758	I want a more traditional racing game, I guess, but we'll see.
2707179	2709800	And as I mentioned before, Ridge Racer did not make it at launch.
2710360	2711041	It got delayed.
2712662	2713502	Oh, and one other thing.
2713923	2718845	Of course, Super Stardust Delta is going to be the free 3G Vita game that you get at launch.
2719186	2731333	Not a big surprise since for pretty much everything up until launch, it was the only PlayStation Network download except they added the escape plan stuff now and there's going to be some other stuff coming out later on.
2731973	2748746	and that is there's a lot of ifs and ands and you know asterisks and stuff like that basically you need to sign up with AT&T not necessarily sign up but you need to activate your 3G
2751188	2769547	and then I believe the way it works is you pay for a month of 3G so 250 megs $15 and then you get a free month of 3G and then once you've done that you also get Super Stardust Delta for free and
2769827	2775092	And I think it also... That's so low in my opinion.
2775232	2784179	It really strikes me as false advertising because it's like you're not really getting... Because on Amazon it said you get a free network game or whatever, but it's not really free.
2785040	2787002	It's free when you pay for the 3G.
2787022	2788403	It's free when you pay more money.
2788743	2790044	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2811255	2814399	Which was a pay to unlock thing for a download game.
2814599	2815940	A play to unlock thing.
2816942	2818604	Another $8 on top of the $10 or $15 that that cost.
2818624	2819965	Come on.
2820045	2820185	Yeah.
2820205	2820285	Yeah.
2827369	2828150	Call of Duty Game Boy Color
2844788	2846710	They ported it everywhere.
2846730	2847851	They had it on the DS.
2848091	2848912	I'm sure they did.
2849152	2850213	I don't know if there was one.
2850413	2853255	No, there was one last year for Modern Warfare 3 on the DS.
2853335	2859220	So, of course, it's coming out on the Vita, but it is still notable because, obviously, this is a huge franchise.
2859280	2863764	And even though it's one I don't usually talk about, it is still a huge selling franchise.
2863784	2866746	I think it would be a system seller, to be honest, for the Vita.
2866766	2867607	You think it's going to be that good?
2867627	2869749	You don't think it'll just be a port of another title?
2869769	2869809	No.
2870369	2893097	Um, it may be a port of, um, I think it's gonna be a port of the game that they're gonna be putting out this year, but, I mean, the games look great on there, and if they can get the controls right, which, I mean, it's got most of the controls of a PlayStation 3, aside from missing the L3, R3, and, you know, L2, R2, but, um, you can kind of work that stuff in, you know, with the touchscreen, maybe.
2893377	2895358	Let me get to the exact quote about this release.
2895378	2905684	This is from Vice President Guy Longworth in an interview with GameTrailers saying, quote, in the autumn, they're really looking forward to Call of Duty on Vita, and we think that's going to be an absolute game changer for the platform.
2906465	2907645	Interesting way of phrasing that.
2908646	2911167	Nice to work in the hashtag in there for their Twitter cam.
2911407	2913889	I think it's going to be a game changer.
2914049	2918071	Oh, is that... I didn't realize that was a whole tie-in to some weird marketing thing.
2919452	2920733	But yeah, I think it'll do well.
2920813	2921033	I mean...
2923234	2925615	They'll probably have Call of Duty on the 3DS this year.
2925635	2936238	Well, if it's a unique Vita game with features kind of unique to the system, I'm sure there'll be an audience for it, but I would think it's just going to be a port kind of like the DS games are.
2936938	2938839	But the DS games are completely different.
2938859	2941759	I mean, that's really limited as far as the system goes.
2942059	2949642	They've had Call of Duties, like really old Call of Duties on the PSP, but even that was kind of limited because you didn't have a second analog stick and stuff.
2949682	2950542	This, I think, is going to be
2951142	2953224	more along the lines of an actual Call of Duty game.
2953464	2956726	And it would be cool if they had cross-play with the PS3 and stuff.
2956806	2957827	You could do that.
2958148	2960589	That could be the game changer right there.
2962711	2964532	Play with the PC and the PS3.
2965733	2966053	All right.
2968235	2969796	DarkSakura, what do you got for us in the news?
2971958	2974880	Sorry, I was describing a bottle of wine.
2975000	2976181	Talking liquor with our chatters?
2976401	2978483	And my windows are frozen.
2978503	2978583	Okay.
2979068	2979508	Oh noes!
2980689	2982370	Deselect, motherfucker!
2983111	2983531	Stop it!
2983671	2986053	What kind of laptop should our users not be buying?
2986393	2986933	Hold on.
2988795	2989235	Netbook.
2989956	2990396	Netbook.
2990796	2991737	I guess there's a difference, huh?
2992757	2993678	Or is the mouse dying?
2993698	2995199	No, it's not my mouse.
2995800	2997801	What happens is it selected text.
2999944	3002626	and is not deselecting the text so that I can get to my other window.
3003666	3006728	So yeah, Capcom had another spelling problem.
3008149	3011731	It was the Azure Watch.
3012492	3013052	Is that the game?
3013132	3014032	Azure's Wrath.
3014112	3016374	Azure's Wrath, whatever.
3016494	3019996	Yeah, it's Chandlingers.
3021077	3022577	Chandlingers.
3022638	3023438	Chandlingers.
3024038	3024799	Chandlingers.
3024959	3028221	It's apparently even more failed than it was before.
3028781	3030702	So yeah, Capcom's still misspelling words.
3030762	3039647	They really need to get things correct with their, you know... Oh, finally I can get to the damn thing.
3039707	3041048	Now that you recalled it from memory, yes.
3041890	3046112	They really need to get their QA really down.
3046192	3050033	Either that or not let the Japanese team do the boxes.
3050193	3055875	Or they need to just invest in Microsoft Word and the little red underline that appears when you spell a word wrong.
3057015	3058416	Because these aren't done in Word.
3058656	3061217	I'm not a designer, but couldn't illustrate or whatever.
3061497	3063357	I have the solution to all of Capcom's problems.
3063857	3064378	Hire me.
3066178	3068219	This shit doesn't happen on anything that I make.
3069861	3070602	Hire me.
3071262	3072403	You should send in a resume.
3073504	3073905	P.S.
3074065	3076847	I don't screw up on the covers to video games.
3076887	3080931	You should make a little YouTube and we can try and get it to go viral and send it to Capcom.
3080951	3081371	Do you want to?
3082212	3083413	I will help you make one if you want.
3083933	3084213	Five.
3084394	3084774	All right.
3085334	3086475	New project for OLR.
3086495	3087196	Get Jamie a job.
3087216	3091780	Now, unlike your application for the tester, you need to actually go through with this one.
3091920	3093401	Well, I didn't make my video for the tester.
3093421	3094482	That's the only thing I didn't do.
3094522	3097145	I was sort of like, I don't want to move.
3097805	3098606	It's really it.
3098666	3100048	It's like, I don't want to go to L.A.
3100529	3101570	I don't like L.A.
3101670	3102712	Capcom's in the Bay, right?
3102832	3103753	They have a big office in the Bay.
3103773	3104234	I think so.
3104254	3104654	I think they do.
3104674	3105555	They're in Santa Clara.
3105796	3106316	Yeah.
3106877	3109040	Which I would totally telecommute for that.
3109120	3109580	There you go.
3111303	3112644	I would absolutely telecommute.
3112925	3113605	All right.
3113666	3114627	And no spelling mistakes.
3114895	3115596	No spelling mistakes.
3116056	3118758	T-E-L-E-C-O-M-M-U-T-E.
3119278	3124662	If anyone from Capcom is listening, remember that DarkSakura is a real bitch when it comes to grammar and spelling.
3125503	3125883	I am.
3125943	3127705	You've heard the mailbag segment on this show.
3127785	3128505	She's ruthless.
3129506	3130266	I have no Ruth.
3130927	3131447	None at all.
3132528	3133509	No Ruth anywhere near me.
3133729	3134210	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3150307	3151328	Challenges.
3151728	3153129	They don't notice, okay?
3153209	3153449	Seriously.
3153509	3154550	Oh, it's text speak.
3154670	3156050	Challenges is text speak.
3156090	3157331	No, it's not even that.
3157391	3158812	It's an extra freaking letter.
3158872	3164896	When I get my Vita next week, I'm going to send Loki a text message that says, I challenge you to a duel in Luminous.
3164996	3166396	Maybe it's a friend's reference.
3166416	3166817	Why?
3167137	3168618	Maybe it's a friend's reference.
3168698	3172120	It's spelled C-H-A-N-L-L-E-N-G-E-S.
3172400	3173340	That's an extra N.
3174585	3175525	Shut up, Rob Shut up, Rob
3205101	3210359	I am a great up and coming designer and I will work for 20 bucks an hour
3211860	3213660	Which is cheaper than a lot of designers will charge you.
3213720	3215061	I'll work for $19 an hour.
3215121	3217601	You can't design shit, okay?
3217701	3219142	Oh, I can't design shit.
3219222	3220562	I can out-design anything.
3221302	3224883	To his credit, he did make olrpsp.com, which was pretty kick-ass.
3225303	3229444	That was something that other people that weren't even into video games were looking at.
3229464	3233065	It's like, wow, this is a great PSP-based thing.
3233105	3234466	You did a very good job.
3234606	3235126	Now, I can't...
3235566	3240549	I promise that I will continue to update sites, but I can design it the first time.
3240649	3242931	Okay, Loki, what is CMYK?
3243431	3246173	CMYNK is Cyan Yellow Magenta Black.
3246293	3248455	Except you got the wrong order.
3248695	3249475	I don't give a crap.
3249495	3250376	You asked what it was.
3250416	3251116	What's an ink limit?
3251617	3252357	Shut up.
3252417	3253638	You two both shut up.
3253658	3254058	What's .game?
3254279	3256060	Okay.
3257261	3258261	I'm just giving you a hard time.
3258281	3260783	Here's the difference between Loki the designer and DarkSakura the designer.
3261223	3262984	Loki's a man and DarkSakura's a woman.
3263024	3265266	Therefore, Loki starts projects and never finishes them.
3266286	3268548	Then again, you've started a lot of projects that you don't finish.
3285046	3287389	Whatever happened to OLRWee.com?
3288350	3292075	Brad from PodCulture says Capcom where spellcheck doesn't exist.
3292115	3297422	I'll tell you what happened to that is that no one uses the Wii web browser so that's what happened to that.
3297897	3302679	And Tigerclaw people would not get all Fs because I would just beat them in the face.
3303799	3310001	And I would expel anybody from my class that got less than a C. All right.
3310501	3311641	I just wouldn't have class.
3311782	3312622	Moving on.
3313742	3314362	More news.
3314722	3315443	Less bickering.
3315563	3315803	Loki.
3316723	3324165	And, you know, Tiger Claw, I know that you say that anything with spelling errors is going to be a collector's item, but not when they're put out there widespread.
3324185	3327846	Well, it's also really easy to print fakes, I would think.
3327946	3330827	I mean, somebody like DarkSakura could probably spot a fake.
3331287	3335188	I have to point out something, just for the chat room to clarify.
3335928	3337489	Loki's got natural design talent.
3338069	3341890	If he had the schooling to go behind it,
3343849	3345190	It'd be out there making bank.
3345870	3347211	And I will say this offhand.
3348392	3352874	A lot of talent just needs to know how to use the other software that we all have to know how to use.
3353414	3354695	Now, you want to know what's hilarious?
3355075	3361959	I have no design talent whatsoever, and yet I actually did do design for a short time before I was in insurance.
3362079	3363060	I'll tell you this, too.
3363560	3364420	Isn't that ironic?
3365681	3372045	I just got done... Well, not just got done, but I read the biography of Joe Simon, who's one of the guys that created Captain America.
3372065	3372525	Mm-hmm.
3373465	3378068	Back in the day, it was just natural talent and honing your own talent.
3378488	3385833	He got jobs as designers doing photo touch-ups in the Depression era.
3387574	3389835	Back then, it was all, what's your raw talent?
3389875	3390575	Can you do this?
3391036	3392456	Do you know how to use the software?
3392496	3395638	Now, they require so much more education.
3395718	3398020	They don't care how well you know how to use everything.
3398280	3401962	They want you to have the degree that says you know how to use it, which doesn't always mean you know how to do shit.
3402142	3407025	Not everybody, though, because I will tell you that the publisher I used to work for was very much, you know what?
3407165	3409346	To me, work experience is very, very valuable.
3409726	3411067	So, you know, I'll just say that.
3411087	3413408	Tell that to the places I've been applying at.
3413428	3414549	Some smart publishers out there.
3414829	3417190	Anyhow, quickly, a comment from our chat room.
3417230	3422193	JV Mon in our chat room at chat.orange.studio.com says, Ugh, the Wii browser is terabad.
3422233	3424214	It's faster using AOL dial-up.
3426741	3427081	Yikes.
3427862	3431723	Well, the problem is no one's really using that anymore.
3431743	3433964	No one's really using the PSP web browser anymore.
3433984	3436225	I mean, there's a few people that are, but you're in the minority.
3436666	3443689	Most everyone's using some sort of web browser on your phone, on your iPod, iPad, something like that.
3443789	3452153	So to make a site dedicated to the PSP or even the PlayStation Vita... And to be honest, you don't really need a website dedicated to the PlayStation Vita because...
3452953	3454435	Hell, I pulled up our site on there.
3454475	3455096	It looks great.
3455256	3456978	I mean, any website looks great on it.
3456998	3460602	As long as you don't put Flash in there, you know.
3461543	3462504	God, my God.
3462564	3467249	Okay, why can't they put HTML5 in a web browser on this stupid device?
3467510	3468351	Why can't they do that?
3468451	3469292	Slow, maybe?
3469392	3469692	I don't know.
3470133	3471234	Slows down memory loss?
3472489	3482439	But it is, from what I understand, quite a bit more efficient than Flash is lately unless you're just fully putting full animation in something you don't need to have Flash.
3483680	3485382	So I don't get it.
3485802	3486663	I can do Flash.
3486743	3487644	I don't like Flash.
3489006	3490547	I would rather do it in HTML.
3490607	3492069	Alright, let's move on, Loki.
3493291	3496913	Alright, let's talk a little bit about Nintendo.
3497594	3498895	And this is kind of neat.
3499455	3509862	And see, I have a few speculations on what this could mean, but Nintendo has acquired a video research and kind of like a video middleware company called MobiClip.
3510403	3519569	And MobiClip, mainly they were kind of focused on video compression for Game Boy Advance, DS, and 3DS games.
3520349	3524151	Now, what I'm thinking this could be used for is a few things.
3524251	3544061	Either A, they're going to do some more video streaming stuff to the 3DS, or B, it's for working on the Wii U and getting that video data compressed enough to where they can stream either a higher resolution or something like that to the Wii U's tablet devices.
3544261	3545241	That's a really good thought.
3545301	3552043	I was actually going in the direction of those movies on the cartridge for the 3DS because we still don't have the 3D movies.
3552363	3564846	I'm kind of curious if anyone's picked up Tekken Prime 3D Edition or whatever, or Tekken 3D Prime Edition, and how that 3D movie looks on the 3DS would be kind of interesting.
3564966	3565466	I have not.
3565526	3566467	Anybody in chat maybe?
3567367	3567687	We'll see.
3569443	3574688	So, I mean, Nintendo was already working with this company anyway, right?
3574748	3578191	So this whole acquisition isn't going to change the world, right?
3578251	3579492	No, it's not.
3579532	3581334	Why would you just bring them in under your wing?
3581454	3583556	Because you plan on using them a lot, right?
3584237	3588961	They have something that you want and that you don't want anyone else to have.
3589381	3604305	Like, for example, if you think about it, this company say they did find a way to a really good algorithm or, you know, some sort of tool that can compress stuff and do, like, high-definition video or, you know, really good video.
3604545	3608846	And for this type of application... They don't want the Vita PS3 having that same technology.
3608866	3614067	Yeah, they don't want the PS3 pad or the Xbox, you know, tablet thing or whatever they have.
3614187	3614667	If that turns out...
3614667	3615348	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3639947	3640227	All right.
3640527	3644769	Well, anyhow, if you're a Mac gamer, I have some news for you, both of you out there.
3644869	3645429	No, I'm just kidding.
3645449	3645909	I'm kidding.
3645949	3646669	Don't send hate mail in.
3647450	3654372	There is some new gaming-related stuff coming to OSX Mountain Lion in the way of Game Center.
3655292	3657593	Game Center is kind of, I don't know.
3658055	3658255	and so on.
3680683	3683185	It will add some new stuff, though.
3683765	3687467	I didn't even know this was in there, but voice chat will make its way.
3687687	3690649	I didn't think that was already in Game Center, but some are saying it is.
3691450	3692470	I didn't think voice chat was.
3692550	3693591	I don't think so.
3693831	3694672	I didn't know that was there.
3694932	3698674	But it would make sense if it can kind of interface with the Mac that way.
3698774	3701756	Like, you know, I see why they're doing that, because they're trying to, you know...
3702156	3702576	and so on.
3719628	3721230	FaceTime is the biggest drawback because it doesn't work on 3G.
3740891	3743772	I know there's competitors out there that do work on 3G.
3743812	3744412	I'm aware of that.
3744452	3750113	But until Apple kind of officially endorses it, I think that's one of its biggest kind of drawbacks.
3750193	3751494	And maybe they're worried about the quality.
3751554	3751914	I don't know.
3751954	3752394	But you're right.
3752454	3756775	Skype will do 3G, but Skype isn't integrated into the freaking phone.
3756795	3758796	You have to download it separately, and not everybody does that.
3758816	3762717	You can do it on 3G, but you have to have it jailbroken before you can do that.
3762877	3763097	Hmm.
3763877	3767079	So, well, again, not something that's integrated into it normally.
3767259	3767459	Yeah.
3767799	3776804	So, BlackWolf in our chat room, of course, the man before us at All Games Radio, says, there are voice chat APIs available to iOS developers as part of GameKit.
3777164	3778845	Not many people implement it, though.
3779586	3780626	So, I guess, I don't know.
3780686	3782907	It's just not the same type of gaming on the iPhone.
3782947	3784968	Like, who would you talk to playing Angry Birds?
3786449	3788851	Well, Angry Birds isn't really... I talk to Angry Birds.
3789231	3792893	I could think maybe... I go, I hate this game every time I play it, so...
3793776	3800540	There's a lot of games that you play at the same time, like Words with Friends and stuff like that.
3801000	3804722	It's usually, okay, I'm going to do my move now, and that's it.
3804962	3806523	You just kind of play it on your own time.
3806583	3808844	It's not like, okay, hey, pop out your phone right now.
3808864	3810345	We're going to play a game of whatever.
3810845	3811205	Right, right.
3812679	3813419	All right, let's move on.
3813459	3816240	Release dates coming up very soon after one more story.
3816620	3817160	DarkSakura.
3818300	3818700	Mantis.
3819761	3820521	Sorry, that's not the story.
3820881	3821041	No.
3821641	3826042	I just found something that was worse than the frilly dog panties.
3826962	3827402	Mantis.
3827863	3828043	What?
3828323	3829503	Mantis are worse than frilly dog panties.
3829523	3832664	We've had this discussion on the show before, and I don't want to have it again.
3832924	3835984	So how about something that has absolutely nothing to do with mantis?
3836565	3836965	Please.
3837225	3838765	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
3839565	3840906	Yay!
3840966	3841906	Heroes in a Manti?
3844702	3846484	Now I'm picturing Michelangelo.
3846524	3847585	Don't picture that.
3847625	3849887	I'm going to have to draw that.
3850968	3851328	No!
3851608	3852669	No, you don't draw that.
3852970	3853950	This is not DeviantArt.
3855458	3856139	This isn't 4chan.
3856159	3857320	This isn't 4chan.
3880622	3885926	So, it could possibly be that Activision is doing a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game.
3886647	3887007	Who knows?
3888288	3892471	They haven't been attached with them before, but maybe they will.
3892772	3895494	The last one that came up was that horrible Wii game.
3896535	3898136	Didn't Ubisoft do that or something?
3898436	3899957	No, it was another company that had it at the time.
3899997	3903580	Yeah, it was published by Ubisoft, and then before that was Konami.
3903720	3905101	Well, technically there was two Wii games.
3905121	3907483	There was one for the movie, the TMNT thing.
3907764	3910046	Then there was also the one that was like Smash Brothers.
3910106	3911547	Yeah, I'm talking about Smash Up.
3913989	3916492	How many times have they freaking rebooted the Ninja Turtles?
3917216	3918077	You know what I want them to do?
3918857	3920818	I want them to go back to the original Ninja Turtles.
3921038	3924241	You know, the ones that were all black and white or the only color they wore was red.
3925181	3928363	And do like a big RPG based off the original Turtles.
3928623	3930164	I want a music game with a ninja rap.
3930645	3932326	Go ninja, go ninja, go.
3934587	3935548	Come on, it'd be awesome.
3937583	3940966	I had no idea they were doing yet another new cartoon.
3941367	3942148	I was like, really?
3942168	3942848	There's another one?
3943629	3954660	The last one that I remembered watching, they had done the one that was on in the late 80s and early 90s that I was watching as a young teenager and my brothers were watching as kids.
3955420	3975728	and then they did another one for a while that was supposed to be pretty much a little bit more on the hardcore side and then the last thing that I watched actually was from that series where they went back into their other universes and they went back with the original Turtle Universe and they were all like you guys are bitches
3976568	3978049	So this is all CGI it looks like.
3978149	3980891	It doesn't look like very good CGI either.
3981791	3982852	Was that like Dun & Poser?
3982992	3983712	You know what though?
3983892	3988835	This looks like it could easily be a video game.
3989135	3992837	With the technology we have today, I could be looking at screenshots from a video game.
3993058	3993938	I would not know the difference.
3994158	4001783	That looks like really... I hope those are just preliminary shots because those textures are just horrendous.
4001823	4002223	Maybe it's...
4002603	4006545	Well, keep in mind, I think these are pictures of posters, so you're probably losing some detail.
4006565	4007565	I don't think I'm losing anything.
4008565	4013087	But maybe it's all Mashima, is what it comes down to.
4014387	4023471	Well, at any rate, at any rate, you know, it better be, I just really don't have a whole lot of faith in it being much better.
4024147	4044621	Well, one interesting kind of tie-in, because you were talking about kind of the license through the days and how Konami had it, and I guess Ubisoft may not have it now, looking at this story, but the 8-bit Ninja Turtle game that's on virtual console right now is getting pulled, or got pulled.
4044661	4045882	I think it's getting pulled soon.
4046442	4047203	Because it sucks?
4048204	4050085	I like the original game, but that's...
4050345	4051527	I like the arcade game.
4051547	4053630	That's one of those games I see through rose-colored glasses.
4053690	4056013	It was awesome when you're nine, but now it's probably crap.
4056073	4058356	Okay, do the water level without cursing.
4059378	4060519	You know what I'm talking about.
4061100	4062462	Fucking seaweed.
4064912	4078879	but that game is no longer going to be on Virtual Console good you know actually you know what's funny you know what Virtual Console did get this week finally finally after years and years it's like the first Virtual Console game to come out in like nine months you know what game they got?
4079799	4081600	Genesis game Strider
4082335	4083016	Yes, that's right.
4083536	4086418	Because Dan was talking about it, and I'm like, you don't need another version of Strider.
4087299	4089701	You really don't need another version of Strider.
4090181	4091803	You already have that version of Strider.
4091923	4093304	We do have that version of Strider.
4093444	4094865	I have beaten that version of Strider.
4094965	4097127	I have not beaten it in the arcade, but I've beaten the Genesis one.
4097717	4101819	All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and what's coming out to a game store near you.
4101919	4104760	Gee, I wonder what could be dominating the U.S.
4104820	4105841	releases this week, Loki?
4106001	4109823	Not as many as you would think because most of them were last week.
4109843	4116946	This week we've got Metal Gear Solid 3D Snake Eater on the 3DS, of course.
4117546	4124552	We've got Shinobito 2 Revenge of Zen, which is basically by the guys that do Tenchu, and that's on the Vita.
4125132	4128255	Touch My Katamari on the Vita this week as well.
4128635	4129816	Pro Evolution Soccer 2012 on 3DS.

4181059	4189548	Naruto Shippuden, Naruto Storm Generation comes out on the 360 this week as well as Darkness 2 and Under Defeat HD.
4189989	4191290	I haven't heard of Under Defeat.
4191350	4194674	It looks like a helicopter game so kind of like a shooter game on the 360.
4195795	4196636	Gal Gun Shooting Pheromones Gun
4215911	4219793	Yeah, isn't this the whole like making teenage girls fall in love with you by the end of the day?
4219813	4221454	I think you're fighting them off or something.
4221534	4227697	I don't really know what the storyline was, but it's an on-rails shooter game that uses the PlayStation Move controller.
4227717	4229817	Let's just say it's not coming out here in the States.
4230938	4237141	But thanks to the region-free ability of the PlayStation 3, it can be yours if you so wish.
4238424	4243374	Fight Night Champion getting a price reduction.
4243514	4244717	It's actually not that bad of a game.
4244958	4246882	I like the Xbox 360 one.
4246902	4247343	I thought it was fun.
4247657	4252960	Shinken de Watashi no Koi Shinasi R comes out this week on the PlayStation 3.
4253040	4255621	This is labeled as an adventure game.
4255661	4262545	It looks like yet another one of those games that's heavy on the dialogue and kind of like simulator games.
4262925	4264386	But it doesn't look like a dating game.
4264406	4265787	It looks like kind of something else.
4266047	4271269	But I don't see any action screenshots, just all talking and anime clip scenes and all that.
4272610	4273971	And leaning over with a big bust.
4274531	4275753	Yes, of course, of course.
4276373	4277515	Gotta emphasize dem boobies.
4278656	4280538	Lots of stuff on the PlayStation 3 this week.
4280798	4290630	Idolmaster, Volume 5, Under Defeat, also on the PS3, Darkness 2, and Tachishio Love Application.
4292139	4293280	Applicate your love!
4322439	4345923	and kind of um um god damn it what's that farming game from Natsume Harvest Moon it looks Harvest Mooney to me because look they're growing eggplants there and they're harvesting chicken it's not Harvest Moon but it's like a 3D version there's no cows yeah well she's wearing a cow hat oh nope there's a cow right there cute little fat ass cow right there and a sheep okay
4346763	4351806	This is like a Zynga type Harvest Moon game coming out in Japan.
4353187	4353647	There you go.
4354007	4354828	That's it for Japanese.
4354848	4356869	It's not Harvest Moon, it's Harvest Noon.
4356989	4359210	You're saying it's Farmville then.
4359330	4361512	Basically, yeah, it's Farmville instead of Farmtown.
4362432	4368316	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4387169	4390475	Back up, back up.
4390495	4392258	Did you say a game called Everybody's Goth?
4392960	4393340	Goth.
4393661	4395464	Oh, I thought she said Everybody's Goth.
4395765	4396225	I'm like, is this 1994? 1994.
4398976	4405538	Today on Goth Talk, we'll explore, has Hot Topic deceived us?
4406278	4407698	Have they abandoned us?
4408338	4412779	With always my co-host, Asriel Abyss, Prince of Sorrow.
4412999	4416820	You know what, I know it sounds like we're making fun, but seriously, that was my crowd in high school, so whatever.
4416840	4417260	Yeah, same here.
4418141	4426543	Mod Nation Racers Road Trip, MotorStormRC, Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus, The Vita Itself, Reality Fighters,
4427783	4456424	Shinobito 2 Revenge of Zen Shinobito, sorry I was reading it wrong Super Stardust Delta, Top Darts Touch My Katamari Baby Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 Uncharted Golden Abyss Virtual Tennis 4 Wipeout 2048 and on the 24th we have Binary Domain on the 360 and PS3 and Hyperdimension Neptunia MK2 on PS3 Syndicate on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 The Last Story on Wii
4457844	4460465	I'm surprised they're getting Gravity Rush so early.
4461566	4463486	I may have to import that if it's in English.
4464847	4465687	Which I would assume it is.
4466047	4467088	Mayhaps it may be.
4467328	4468809	Because it's not coming out over here until May.
4472082	4474383	Same day as Resistance, too, so that's a tough one.
4474583	4483106	By the way, completely off the record, well, not off, but having nothing to do with this, I've decided to play through Mother 3 because I hate my life and I want to cry.
4484107	4484827	Have fun with that.
4484967	4485567	It's depressing.
4486128	4488028	Maybe you should be playing everybody's goth then.
4489549	4491250	I'm trying to imagine how that game would play.
4492990	4496092	You'll go around trying to convert the jocks and the cheerleaders.
4496972	4500235	No, you go around trying to avoid the jocks and the cheerleaders.
4500275	4501136	With your goth gun.
4502857	4503378	Goth gun.
4503718	4504339	Yes, it's bat.
4504399	4505079	It fires bats.
4505520	4507882	And you have to raise... It fires sorrow.
4510530	4510911	DarkSakura.com
4532472	4536655	You might get, like, there might be DLC that will change it to The Smiths, you know, or something like that.
4536975	4538537	Yeah, that's what it should progress.
4538577	4540498	Like, The Smiths would be the ultimate in depression.
4541419	4543580	Or no, eventually you get to Bauhaus level.
4544721	4546642	Bela Lugosi is dead.
4547523	4548184	Thank you for watching!
4566278	4572160	But they kind of started that off a little early with the new Twisted Metal game having live-action cutscenes.
4573440	4580782	And, of course, they're expecting to have the same characters from the last Twisted Metal game in this actual movie as well.
4580882	4582762	So, neat.
4582882	4591384	It's being developed by Avi and Ari Arad, who I guess have worked with the Spider-Man series.
4592485	4592645	And...
4595945	4596945	Car Crashing Expert
4622810	4625332	It's too bad David Carradine didn't live long enough to see this.
4626573	4627133	That is too bad.
4627934	4629195	He did live long enough for Kill Bill.
4629755	4631196	But hey, you know what?
4631637	4635720	And I understand that he may not necessarily be part of the lore for Twisted Metal.
4637822	4643166	There is still Sylvester Stallone, and he could probably come back as Machine Gun Joe.
4643206	4644267	Not sure, what's he doing these days?
4644307	4644967	The Expendables?
4645127	4645588	Expendables 2.
4646809	4647089	Whoopee!
4647609	4648170	Well, actually, no.
4648190	4648891	He has quite a few movies.
4648911	4649552	He has Expendables 2.
4649773	4652958	He has two more movies with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
4655121	4655522	That's right.
4655582	4656524	Arnold's gone back to acting.
4657782	4661084	He needs to go back to exercising, too, because, whoa.
4662645	4668289	I mean, that's pretty wrong of me saying that, but, you know, it's insane.
4668329	4682098	Well, we've got the man who was, you know, elected by Ronald Reagan to be our, you know, the person we attained, you know, we looked for as a role model for fitness, who was, what was it, the president's fitness shit thing?
4682458	4683118	I'm not going to lie, though.
4683158	4687560	If I'm that fit at that age, I'll be happy.
4687580	4689261	There's a very easy way for you to get that fit.
4689862	4690622	Stop eating that.
4690842	4691022	No.
4691842	4692783	It comes in a needle.
4693823	4695324	It comes with a needle and a little glass.
4695344	4696465	Oh, no.
4697125	4697665	Steroids.
4698886	4699806	Because that's how he did it.
4699866	4700767	Crack is whack, yo.
4703666	4704627	I want to see those receipts.
4705728	4706408	I don't believe it.
4706489	4708090	Don't make me get out the Whitney Houston interview.
4708110	4709351	Some might say it's in bad taste.
4709812	4710072	All right.
4712774	4716818	Actually, I got to say, I've become a lot more active lately.
4716978	4717558	I really have.
4717599	4722303	I mean, this is only within the past week and a half, so it's not really a habit yet, which is why I haven't been talking about it a lot.
4722323	4723864	But there's two things to credit with it.
4724445	4726446	One of them would be the site Fitocracy.
4726787	4728328	I don't know how many of you guys know about this website.
4728809	4729289	I signed up.
4729329	4730010	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4750430	4761712	As crazy as this sounds, and I know I'll get called sellout or whatever, but Rhythm Party got me up and moving and remembering how good it feels to play DER for 30 minutes.
4762293	4762573	Again.
4763253	4765813	And I really do credit Rhythm Party, which had DLC this week.
4765853	4768254	I don't even think that comes up in our show tonight, so I'll say it now.
4768774	4771034	They finally put out DLC for Rhythm Party this week.
4771254	4778336	The downside is it's all Konami originals, but the upside is, oh my god, the collaborations are...
4778536	4782038	are hilarious do you know who Naoki collaborated with this time?
4782698	4789782	Tiffany awesome where does he I know and then one of the songs has um
4791279	4793460	Who are the Sister Sledge?
4793680	4794520	You remember Sister Sledge?
4794640	4796260	We are family.
4797141	4800601	The oldest Sister Sledge, the one that was the vocalist, is in another collaboration.
4800961	4809163	Like it's all these like washed up fucking 80s and 70s vocalists are now in DDR or Rhythm Party, excuse me, songs.
4810664	4819746	But unfortunately, Rhythm Party's weakest thing is like, okay, it's got Born This Way by Gaga and nothing else contemporary.
4821724	4824086	I'm sorry, Bobby Brown is not contemporary.
4824626	4826007	It's more contemporary now, though.
4826107	4826728	It is now!
4827708	4828549	By sheer luck!
4829430	4831231	But it was not supposed to be contemporary.
4833132	4833993	The songs are decent, though.
4834273	4836034	The songs are surprisingly decent.
4836094	4838796	I enjoy it more than Dance Masters.
4838996	4839757	I will stand by that.
4839837	4841298	It's a way better investment than Dance Masters.
4841318	4843339	Which Dance Masters theme happens to be part of that.
4843359	4844540	Yeah, that was in the download pack, too.
4846141	4846842	Anyhow, sorry.
4847142	4850406	I didn't mean to get on a tangent, but I have been on a fitness kick lately.
4850426	4859997	The thing with me, though, is I don't really allocate myself that much time because when I get home from work, I watch my son until he goes to bed at 8.
4860297	4862960	So I have a short window between 8 o'clock and 11 p.m.
4862980	4863020	to...
4864702	4866904	Have dinner, relax for a little bit.
4866964	4868945	It's like, okay, where am I going to fit fitness in there?
4869065	4872688	Yes, I could do it, but then again, at the same time, that's the only free time I have all day.
4873248	4874349	I got to fit in games in there.
4874389	4876551	I'm going to fit in working on stuff I want to work on.
4876571	4877611	And I understand.
4877932	4879673	It's just I don't prioritize it enough.
4880033	4904394	I'll throw this out there um I I it may not work for your situation but one like kind of goal I made is that I try to walk a mile every day and I do that on my breaks at work I do it on my break and I have an application on my phone called RunKeeper that helps me and it funny RunKeeper ties into Fitocracy so every time I walk it will say on my Fitocracy you walked 1.2 miles today and so I do that on my break I mean that's that's what I've been trying to do
4904790	4919177	Well, I'll tell you too, because keep in mind, I was up there a few years ago, and that's how I lost all of my weight, was by cutting way down on sugar and walking every day at work during my lunch break.
4919217	4924900	And that was when I was working off of downtown, off of Alhambra, and walking around that big park twice.
4925981	4926721	So, yeah.
4926901	4930503	I don't know how, but I ballooned up at the end of last year, so I'm trying to lose it.
4930523	4933025	But yoga, and I'm actually planning on getting the Connect Yoga.
4933045	4933145	Okay.
4933985	4936167	I've started taking yoga twice a week and now I do it every day.
4937228	4949860	And I have noticed, well, I'm not going to actually say the number or anything, but since I've started taking yoga and cut out all bread, I am now down seven pounds from when I started.
4950881	4951302	Congrats.
4951902	4955806	So yeah, just making little changes and incorporating some activity into your life is amazing.
4956847	4958048	You'll find a place to squeeze it in.
4958973	4961454	You know, I would love to... Lift weights.
4961494	4961894	Do sit-ups.
4961914	4963314	Do 25 sit-ups before you go to bed.
4963634	4965235	Well, not before you go to bed because then you'll be up all night.
4965255	4967175	Do 25 sit-ups right when you get home.
4967695	4970916	I've seriously thought about building new DDR pads.
4970996	4973096	I have sheet metal in my garage.
4973116	4973496	There you go.
4973516	4974457	Get back into DDR.
4974817	4977477	I can't because of the proximity to my son's room.
4977717	4978458	It would be too loud.
4979158	4979578	Yeah.
4979938	4980659	All right, well, moving on.
4980699	4982480	Let's get back into video game talk.
4982500	4987704	I want to do a follow-up to something we were talking about last week, which was the double fine funding that happened through Kickstarter.
4988004	4989165	They're going to break $2 million.
4989585	4992447	I mean, there's still 22 days left on that thing, and I just checked it earlier today.
4992487	4993748	It was at $1.9 million.
4993768	4996970	So they're going to easily break $2 million, maybe make $2.5 million.
4997051	4997391	I don't know.
4997871	4999633	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5022811	5031598	They've already announced that there will be a DRM-free game that will be released on the PC, Mac, and Linux when it launches.
5032139	5034821	There will be a closed beta that's going to happen on Steam.
5036883	5045830	And now Tim Schafer said in an interview that went up on YouTube that because they got more money, they're going to also do it on iOS and certain types of Android phones.
5045990	5047852	So they're going to kind of expand those platforms.
5048212	5057658	But it is important to note, if you donate it to the project, you won't be able to get the iOS and Android versions free because of the limitations of those types of distributions.
5058538	5066963	From what I remember of the Apple Store, you can get a finite number of codes to give away your product, like it's got to be 100 or less, maybe even like 50 or 20.
5068204	5097610	but like you know with 30,000 people donating to this and counting I think it's even more I'm just reading off the lowest tier even they can't generate that kind of codes on iOS so your free one that you get for donating will be the PC Mac or Linux version but there will also be now this iOS and Linux one nothing about consoles yet so there you go kind of the first update and I guess we're going to probably see more of this as it gets developed that'd be funny if they put that on indie games
5100391	5101131	I guess they could.
5101151	5106836	Yeah, file size is usually the only thing that's holding it back, but... You never know, though.
5106937	5109619	I mean, Xbox is known for making exceptions.
5110480	5113503	So a high-profile thing like this... They probably put that Xbox lever, Kate.
5113923	5114824	It might as well, right?
5115064	5115765	Yeah.
5116185	5120729	All right, well, let's take a moment to walk down the halls of gaming's history.
5120749	5121590	You know, there was a time...
5123051	5123912	We didn't know anything.
5123932	5129196	The only stuff we knew about video games was what we read in Nintendo Power or Electronic Gaming Monthly.
5129396	5130737	That's what we got to see development.
5130897	5132058	We didn't have the internet.
5132098	5133219	It looked like DOS.
5133279	5134340	It was called AOL.
5134480	5135061	That's right.
5135081	5135061	1.0.
5135341	5140305	Back in my day, it was Quantum Link on the Commodore 64.
5140845	5142426	Yes, I had Prodigy.
5142446	5144948	You know what the AOL users called it, at least in my group?
5145368	5145749	Buttigy.
5146149	5146769	We really caught it.
5147930	5148750	And CompuSuck.
5148890	5154573	Prodigy was fucking awesome on the old PCs because of the graphics and everything.
5154633	5157194	Anyway, I was very loyal to Prodigy for a long time.
5157794	5159015	I remember my old sign-in.
5159035	5160496	But anyway, we won't go there.
5160536	5162396	We'll go to the classic game of the week.
5162777	5167479	DarkSakura is going to jump in the gaming vault and pick out one game she thinks, hey, play it.
5168319	5171080	It is Rainbow Islands, the story of Bubble Bobble 2.
5171681	5173021	You've been on a bobble kick lately.
5173382	5174302	Well, I was inspired.
5175862	5180627	At any... And actually the music that I linked is probably one of the best home versions ever.
5181448	5185011	This one is the PC Engine version, which is pretty much arcade perfect.
5186333	5188154	Anyway, Rainbow Islands came out in 1987.
5188214	5190677	It was by Taito.
5191498	5195201	And it was a sequel to, as it says, Bubble Bobble.
5196102	5201845	And the game, it was actually the second in the series.
5202425	5205226	It was followed by Bubble Symphony and Bubble Memories.
5205847	5210169	But it has two sequels, Parasol Stars and Bubble Bobble Part 2.
5211409	5213511	So it's come out on like darn near everything.
5213551	5214852	It's kind of messed up.
5214892	5223137	But the way that you get through that is you're on an island that you have to throw rainbows around to get to different platforms.
5223217	5227981	And you can use the rainbows to shoot things, but they will eventually break down.
5228681	5238946	You've also got this thing called the Hidden Depths, where it actually has a bunch of different secrets that you can find, like different levels and power-ups and different riddles.
5239706	5244869	And so it makes it, you can beat the game so many different ways.
5245409	5252993	It also has a scoring system that has its own secrets too, so you can get different high scores by finding all the different stuff.
5253613	5257515	So as I said, it's set on islands, ten of them, and they each have their different theme.
5258355	5265943	and you basically move to the next island in the chain by going around and passing the levels and they get progressively more difficult.
5266323	5271728	You have faster enemies and you can also go on a large map screen where you can see all the different islands.
5272249	5281417	There are three secret islands that are not visible until the seven big diamonds are collected which are hidden throughout the game and actually most home versions lack the secret islands.
5282538	5285621	So you can release these rainbows, and they're weapons and platforms.
5286402	5290527	And when you jump on them, they fall down and hit the enemies below it.
5291267	5298715	And different power-ups can make you go faster, increase the speed of the rainbows, and let you spawn, I believe, up to three rainbows.
5298775	5299416	Isn't that right, Robb?
5301042	5303563	Yes, I think it was three was the max you could get.
5303923	5306764	Just so you guys know, I love this game.
5306804	5315548	Like, I used to play this at Roseville Golf Land in between while waiting for DDR, because that was back when Altercade was cool, and I used to play this in the Altercade machine all the time.
5316008	5320229	And people were like, what is that very homosexual game you are playing where you are literally shooting rainbows?
5320790	5323991	I said, it's Rainbow Islands and it's awesome, you shut your judging mouth.
5325512	5341037	and the other thing that's good about the little rainbows too is that they actually protect you from overhead enemies taking big poops on you so at any rate that video finished so I'm going to do the totally awesome Commodore 64 version of the game
5341681	5342001	Listen, Bubby
5362473	5363614	Bobby's in this game!
5380305	5384828	It has the same thing, except the bosses are in different orders, the enemies are in different order.
5385248	5386689	Kind of like Bubble Bobble Super Mode.
5387450	5389992	And it came out in limited quantities.
5390312	5395575	Now, just to let you know, it actually was included in the Mega Drive version of Rainbow Islands.
5396456	5401199	And the arcade version was actually licensed to RomStar to come out over in the U.S.
5401859	5409685	So the version that I was playing of Bubble Bobble had that version on it, the PS1 collection, Bubble Bobble collection.
5410806	5413368	So all the different versions that came out at home.
5414288	5418292	There was a Commodore 64, which we just heard the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC.
5418912	5422195	There was Amiga and Atari ST, the Mega Drive version.
5423476	5426198	There was the NES version, which was not that great.
5426758	5431282	The European version is also different than the Japanese version, just saying.
5432115	5434636	Sorry for that little clip in the background that wasn't really from Rainbow Islands.
5434676	5441619	It said it was the loading theme, but I think that was a universal loader thing back in Commodore 64 piracy days.
5441819	5442219	So sorry.
5442479	5444220	That clip was not actually from Rainbow Islands.
5444380	5444960	I apologize.
5445901	5448442	So we'll go to... Can I keep listening?
5448742	5450422	Yeah, but I need to find what system to do now.
5450783	5450963	Just...
5452549	5453029	How about this one?
5453049	5453970	I think this is arcade.
5454010	5455711	Let's hope nobody's doing a voiceover on this one.
5456211	5458292	The arcade one that I found was really quiet.
5459252	5459552	Yeah.
5460473	5460833	It's alright.
5461133	5462534	It needs to be quiet so you can talk over it.
5462654	5468477	At any rate, we also had PC Engine TurboGrafx, which was the first one that I linked.
5468517	5469157	It was on QCard.
5470057	5476261	There was also a PC, Sega Saturn, and PlayStation version that was released as Bubble Bobble featuring Rainbow Islands.
5476281	5477081	That's the one I was playing.
5477461	5491589	There's a WonderSwan version, Game Boy Color, PC, PS2, Xbox that came out as part of Taito Legends, a mobile version, and Xbox Live Arcade version got one that was updated with 2.5D graphics.
5493230	5496992	And then the arcade game, now this is kind of neat,
5498192	5502314	The music was actually based off Over the Rainbow from The Wizard of Oz.
5503555	5507016	And it came on the Mega Drive, PC Engine, and Famicom versions.
5509077	5518622	But when it came out on the Master System Nest, Saturn, all those other ones, they actually changed it so that they wouldn't risk copyright infringement.
5520245	5521986	So yeah, that's the game that we have.
5522126	5525389	Oh, and I do want to mention some regional differences.
5525449	5532054	For the Sega Master System version and the European one, there was a glitch that made the game crash after level 7, so it sent you back to the title screen.
5532955	5540220	If you use the level select code to get to 8, the glitch happens at the end of that level, and you can't even see the ending.
5540380	5542202	The Brazilian version fixed it.
5543342	5554348	and the European version of the NES port is actually a lot more like the arcade version where the Japanese and North American versions have the original level designs and story versions.
5555851	5556151	That's it.
5556311	5559452	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Rainbow Islands.
5560853	5563733	On pretty much every freaking console that was out at the time.
5564754	5566394	And a few that weren't out at the time.
5566414	5566934	That's right.
5567675	5568115	There you go.
5568215	5573336	By the way, just to answer some questions from chat, some folks were saying, wasn't that already the game of the week before?
5573576	5573736	No.
5573816	5580338	No, we did check versus the wiki, Parasol Stars, which was kind of a different, like bubble bobble sequel the other way.
5580358	5582019	It was one of the official sequels to the game.
5582199	5583901	Right, it was in the past.
5583941	5588765	And I'm pretty sure I would have brought up Rainbow Islands because I did genuinely like the game a lot.
5589166	5594170	But I believe, at least according to our wiki, this is the first time that it has officially been the game of the week.
5594190	5597213	I did Parasol Stars like, what, last year or the year before?
5597233	5598034	It was a while ago.
5598094	5603639	Well, you know, you gotta remember, we've been doing Classic Game of the Week since episode 250, I believe.
5603719	5605120	And we're almost to 450.
5605160	5605841	I've named over 200 games.
5608123	5609024	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5626787	5628428	No, I think that I did a different version of it.
5629748	5632369	I think it was one of those things where when it happened, we were just like, yeah, you know what?
5632509	5632869	Deal with it.
5633390	5634490	It's been 200 shows.
5634810	5640012	If that was my only thing, then screw it.
5640332	5642773	It's going to get to a point where you're like, shit, I've done everything.
5642833	5645134	JV1 says there was a PCP version as well.
5645695	5646575	I think that's what he heard.
5647575	5651637	I'm going to get out my Commodore 64 five and a quarter floppies and be all like, just pick one out of the box.
5653328	5655229	My dad still has those in the garage.
5655570	5656730	You think those discs work?
5656770	5658492	Or do you think they've probably melted by now?
5659292	5660273	Let's fire up Geass.
5660673	5664336	All right, anyhow, we're going to take a break, guys, but there's still plenty more show to come.
5664676	5665817	Rapid Fire News coming up.
5665857	5674643	Of course, your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, the FUs of the week, Twitter, topics, and so much more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5680680	5683561	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
5683941	5691502	We are live with the 446th episode of our show on this February the 19th of 2012.
5693382	5698563	Live tonight, live only tonight, we're saying goodbye, sadly, to the OLR afterbirth at the very end of the show.
5698603	5706885	You know, we used to be live for about 20 minutes after we taped the show, and the reason why we couldn't podcast it is because a big central part of that was the cage match where we played copyrighted music.
5707565	5710588	We've made a very difficult creative decision to end that segment tonight.
5712369	5718395	The good news is that it'll free up the resources to do other things, but I want to warn everybody, don't expect that to come right away.
5718995	5723819	There's still some things that have to happen behind the scenes, but we are going to use the time to work on other projects.
5724880	5727923	We still appreciate, of course, the live listeners coming out every week, but we hope you'll
5728323	5733350	Understand and respect our decision to kind of say, you know what, this segment's losing steam for us.
5733790	5737795	We need to kind of put it out to pasture and reinvent with something new.
5738416	5739638	So that'll be ending live tonight.
5739678	5741721	Podcasters, not a damn thing changes for you.
5741761	5746427	If you've never listened to OLR Live before, you're not going to notice a lick of difference right now.
5748246	5748906	No, nothing will change.
5748926	5749387	Nothing will change.
5749527	5750367	The show is still fine.
5750787	5751007	All right.
5751027	5753689	We're still holding it together with chicken wire and duct tape.
5753709	5756070	There might be more in the future for you.
5756190	5756610	Who knows?
5756630	5757150	There might be more.
5757831	5758431	All right.
5758511	5761132	Anyhow, before I give too much away, let's talk.
5761192	5772618	Oh, speaking of spoilers, I wanted to bring this up at some point because last week on the show, we had a very unexpected surprise during the phone call segment and we made a new friend here at Orange Lounge Radio and it was Asuka.
5773178	5773499	Asuka.
5774159	5776000	I always want to say Asuka, but it's Asuka.
5776761	5784571	Keep in mind, for most words in Japanese, the U or Su or Ru, the U is really cut short.
5784711	5785752	Well, now I've had my lesson.
5785832	5792060	But Asuka was on the show last week, and she is from the Tester, which is the Sony...
5793622	5794302	and DarkSakura.com.
5812110	5812551	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5831673	5835115	The one... Props to her for keeping that secret.
5835235	5839078	Because if I was... If that was me, that would have been a really hard thing to keep under my hat.
5839098	5840539	It's like, no, guys, really.
5840579	5842820	Next week's episode is going to make you so mad.
5844621	5853407	But the only bummer about that episode is... It was kind of one of those things where it was like they definitely... Loki, you saw it, right?
5853447	5855128	You finally watched it or whatever?
5855328	5855668	Yeah.
5855688	5857029	They definitely went for...
5858664	5863748	It was an episode where you were reminded that it's a TV show and not really a job interview.
5864388	5872793	Because the decision that they made, Asuka got kicked off in favor of somebody who was quote-unquote more entertaining television.
5872993	5879237	And Asuka knows that's not a dig on her, but this person that they kept was causing drama and drama's ratings and so forth.
5879897	5895955	and Asuka you know was was generally trying to get the job done and so forth but unfortunately the way that whole challenge was set up it was going to be her the other gal and the other gal was starting fights so she was excuse me she had personality or whatever Jaffe said about her so um
5896796	5898257	Bummer about Asuka.
5898578	5900219	Very sad to hear about that.
5900419	5905804	And, you know, I get the sense she's kind of bummed out about the edit she got on the show just in reading her Twitter and stuff.
5905844	5912869	But I just want to say, you know what, I know, I think what bugs her is that they used a clip of her at the very beginning of the show.
5912929	5913570	I'm just guessing.
5913650	5913990	I don't know.
5914030	5915532	But I'm going to guess if I were her.
5916252	5916792	and DarkSakura.com.
5944560	5968999	I'm sure every person in the house said it was bullshit that he got to stick around because of course that's one person between you and the prize they chose to show her probably because they wanted to show her to remind people who she was because it was going to be her week to get kicked off the show you know so it was all editing garbage and all this stuff so you know it's unfortunate but I didn't think she looked like a bitch I think she looked like somebody who was fighting to be there
5970019	5972281	and that was what it was all about.
5973081	5973622	Best of luck.
5973982	5977644	I know she's not in chat tonight, but I think there was a con or something this weekend.
5977904	5983728	If we can get her back on the show to really now get the skinny on what went down, she definitely has an open invite to come back anytime.
5984744	5989186	Meanwhile, let's move on and talk about other video game news.
5989506	5991147	And we'll go with the rapid fire news.
5991247	5991487	Loki.
5992328	5992688	All right.
5992948	5996950	So let's talk a little bit about this is kind of cool.
5997030	5999571	It's a Vita game I'm definitely looking forward to.
5999831	6002792	And that would be Resistance Burning Skies.
6003413	6005494	It has been announced that it is coming out May 29th.
6006774	6013101	on the Vita, and kind of a side story to the whole Resistance series.
6015003	6018206	It looks pretty awesome, so I'm definitely checking that out.
6019267	6030238	Also, it wasn't part of this, but I believe Gravity Rush is also supposed to be coming out that same day as well, which is another really awesome-looking Vita game, which unfortunately
6030478	6039543	Unfortunately, due to the fact that you can only have one profile on your Vita system, I am not able to download to my Vita, which is annoying.
6042225	6043526	But yeah, so there's that.
6044046	6051250	And then on top of that, there's also this new arcade game that's coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
6051910	6054452	It's called Jam Live Music Arcade.
6055192	6056953	And what it is is it's kind of like...
6058534	6062335	A music creation remix program.
6062956	6072879	You can use your instruments, your Guitar Hero instruments, Rock Band instruments, whatever, with this, and you can actually remix some different songs.
6072899	6083483	It includes 30 licensed songs, including, I guess, stuff from Modest Mouse, Fall Out Boy, Fatboy Slim, Rise Against, Atmosphere, and some other artists.
6084995	6107852	and we'll be coming out I guess on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network later this year so that's kind of cool at least something to maybe dust those instruments off for and then finally the next piece of download content has been announced for well the date has for the Saints Row the third game Gangstas in Space it continues on
6110246	6119954	One of the endings of the game where you are filming a movie and it's really cheesy, kind of like a parody of old Star Trek episodes or whatever.
6119974	6122676	It's just really, really ridiculous.
6122816	6124818	But there's going to be that.
6124878	6128180	It's coming out for $6.99 on the 21st.
6129181	6134306	I will probably download it because I like Saints Row, so I don't know why I just didn't get a season pass.
6134326	6134906	Of course.
6135186	6142027	I gotta say this though, it better be longer than the last DLC because the last DLC I finished in an hour and that's bullshit.
6142067	6143228	How much was it?
6143608	6143228	$7.
6144248	6146928	That is absolute bullshit.
6147669	6159331	And I gotta tell you this much, they aren't already starting off on a good note because I thought the whole gangsters in space mission at the end won the alternate endings was kind of stupid, but whatever.
6159827	6163628	That's too bad, because the first hour of that game, I've never laughed so hard in my life.
6163648	6164528	That game is awesome.
6164748	6165429	No, don't get me wrong.
6165449	6166969	That game is awesome.
6167349	6172731	It's just how they're treating the whole download content thing is just really annoying.
6172991	6182754	And trust me, if all three of these pieces of download content are terrible like this, I'm just not going to buy any download content for you guys anymore.
6183663	6187107	There's still ways I can play this shit without having to buy it.
6188248	6190531	I have that option, but I'm not taking it.
6190571	6192353	I actually am purchasing download content.
6194717	6199820	Speaking of DLC, I just want to insert something here because I noticed it's not in the show role, but it's something I read because it sounds interesting to me.
6200180	6202441	Final Fantasy XIII 2 is getting a lot of DLC.
6202481	6204983	This is a very interesting path that Square's going down.
6205043	6207484	I wonder what this is going to do for future Final Fantasy games.
6207984	6210066	But I guess they announced one this week.
6210166	6215929	Not only are they doing another costume, and this one is Sarah with, you know, boobiedge.
6216554	6224060	But there's going to be like a side story mission now that will bring back Saz, who is, you know, an awesome character in Final Fantasy XIII.
6224100	6225942	He was the dude with the chocobo in his afro.
6226322	6229104	I guess he's going to have like a side mission or a side story thing.
6229585	6234969	And if you beat it, you get to use him as one of the quote unquote monster companions in the main game.
6235009	6236390	So that could be interesting.
6236470	6238932	But like Loki, I hope it doesn't disappoint in length.
6239293	6242715	I hope it's something that you can, you know, is rewarding.
6243176	6245778	I hope it has the same good storytelling as the rest of the Final Fantasy series.
6246238	6246638	Game does.
6247479	6249080	Meanwhile, other rapid fire news.
6249160	6253323	Pandora's Tower is going to be coming out in Europe in April.
6253823	6258066	Now, this is notable because Pandora's Tower is one of those Operation Rainfall games.
6258166	6263149	You know, one of the games that was big in Japan and people were like, why aren't these games coming out on the Wii over here?
6263529	6267071	Well, it's coming out in Europe in April, which means English translation.
6267472	6269353	Could it come out in America after that?
6269973	6284802	maybe by 2013 at this rate we'll see meanwhile the rest of us will probably have pirated it by then not that I endorse piracy but I'm getting pretty damn sick of why is the game in English and takes nine months to come over here and then it's exclusive to only one store excuse me
6285662	6289603	April 13th is the day that Pandora's Tower is coming out in Europe.
6291484	6292144	Pretty awesome there.
6293064	6299206	I guess the announcement came out with some Valentine's cards that they did online, which was a very strange tie-in, but whatever.
6300326	6303787	Metal Gear Solid, a little bit of Metal Gear Solid news this week.
6303807	6306468	The Metal Gear 3D demo, by the way, is out.
6306588	6310149	I haven't checked it out myself, but for those of you that are 3DSing, you might want to check out that demo.
6310709	6326639	otherwise Metal Gear Solid 4 is going to be ending its online portion this summer you might have already forgot that there was a whole Metal Gear portion online but it was Metal Gear Online it is going offline this summer and it's probably because well nobody's really playing it anymore
6327539	6339431	I guess the shop for Metal Gear Online is closing March 21st, and then in April you cannot make new characters, and on June 21st it is all going down.
6340072	6347680	Unfortunately, this is what happens to games that their servers aren't really used anymore, is that they take the servers down and use them for other games.
6349341	6352864	One other game announcement of sorts, or I guess it's more like a leaked.
6353224	6358089	Korea's game ratings board has leaked news about Dragon Ball Z Connect.
6358649	6363073	Bandai Namco, who's made all the other Dragon Ball Z games, is making this one as well.
6363493	6365535	Who knows what the hell this game will involve.
6365715	6367677	Let's hope it will involve dancing.
6367977	6372681	Not bad for a show that's been off the air in Japan since 1990-something.
6372921	6373201	Right.
6374923	6376824	But hey, how many times have they rebooted Ninja Turtles?
6377005	6377185	So...
6378772	6379533	How about a Capcom-related one?
6379553	6381276	There is a new Darkstalkers trademark in Europe.
6394665	6397408	Ooh, so maybe there's a surprise game coming out?
6397468	6400151	Maybe they're doing something in the vein of Street Fighter 3?
6400671	6401132	Who knows?
6401672	6403014	But that would be really sweet.
6404415	6409080	And we actually have been getting those constant reminders from Ono to...
6410782	6413104	Have a push on Capcom for more Darkstalkers.
6413564	6415566	He said this is all up to the readers.
6415606	6416447	They have to create the buzz.
6416467	6417127	They have to tell us.
6417147	6419569	They have to write the condition.
6419589	6421891	They have to send the letters out of plead.
6422451	6424033	I guess that was translated badly.
6425134	6429257	Next up, Hulu Plus is now on Wii.
6429317	6433200	And it is a $7.99 a month subscription.
6433801	6436143	And there will be a 3DS version out later.
6437441	6437901	But no one cares.
6438721	6442763	And in rock band news, we do have some Megadeth.
6444083	6452706	The Megadeth pack has Symphony of Destruction and Tout Le Monde and Public Enemy No.
6452726	6452706	1.
6453407	6459009	Symphony of Destruction has pro guitar and pro bass available for an extra buck.
6460269	6487906	but um there are um you can get the full albums of Peace Sells but Who's Buying and Rest in Peace cause you know for me it's all about playing Sweating Bullets done alright Megadeth you know I'm gonna say this Megadeth is not great but they had some great songs I mean freaking Dave Mustaine got kicked out of Metallica for a reason but I don't know I think Sweating Bullets is probably their best song
6488746	6491147	I gotta go back to the Darkstalkers news a little bit here.
6491847	6493148	Obviously, that was some big news.
6493708	6497970	DungeonBuster in our chat room at chat.orange.com says, I'd love another Darkstalkers.
6498370	6500191	Dude, I don't think you're alone.
6500411	6502272	I would really get a kick out of that.
6502392	6504713	And it would make sense for Capcom to go back to that.
6504753	6506674	You know, they've had Street Fighter 4.
6506754	6508535	They're gonna have this whole Street Fighter cross Tekken.
6508855	6512556	I wouldn't be surprised at all if Darkstalkers kind of gets that treatment for 2013.
6513377	6517319	It's all about three, one move and two characters.
6517719	6518099	Mm-hmm.
6518928	6519889	No, reverse that.
6519989	6521029	Two moves in one character.
6522650	6524351	The succubus attack.
6526212	6527053	What was it called?
6527133	6528334	The pleasure something?
6529715	6535238	Dimitri's Midnight Bliss, where he turns the character into a female version, sexy female, and then sucks him dry.
6536178	6537439	And then... Nasty.
6538260	6541221	And then Jetta, who is just disgusting.
6542202	6544764	With the fetus, the god fetus stage.
6545624	6550529	All right, we're going to get back into some more news here in the mailbag in just a moment, but I do want to make sure I put out a call.
6550569	6553552	The last call for tweets for tonight, twitter.com slash OLR.
6553912	6564182	If you have any statements you want to make on what we've talked about tonight or if you have any questions for us, we'll take those via Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR if you want to add us and tweet at us at OLR.
6565162	6568624	Loki, you've got quite a little bit of news about one franchise, don't you?
6568784	6575086	Yeah, Assassin's Creed Revelations has done pretty well, so of course it makes sense that they're going to do another Assassin's Creed game.
6575647	6577027	It's something called Assassin's Creed 3.
6577507	6581489	Yes, that's confusing because it's not the third Assassin's Creed game, but whatever.
6582209	6587391	It's coming out October 30th in North America, so it's not too far away.
6588332	6590993	Definitely in time for the fourth quarter rush.
6592533	6619763	and for good reason of course Assassin's Creed Revelations shipped nearly 7 million units worldwide and to make a comparison with another popular franchise Just Dance shipped 13 million units worldwide that's in the last year but if you remember though Revelations though that came out back in November so it's had a lot less time to do that so it's pretty cool
6620743	6644982	of course also there's going to be some download content coming to Revelations as well the new download content is called Assassin's Creed Revelations Lost Archives it's going to be $15 and some of the achievements have already leaked out about it and it's supposed to be a single player campaign as well including 10 new achievements so, neat
6646900	6652604	Lots and lots of Assassin's Creed news, but I guess when your franchise is popular... Yeah.
6652724	6655366	The whole Assassin's Creed 3 thing doesn't bother me too much, though.
6655386	6659148	I mean, think about how many Mario games there have been that have had all these different numbers.
6659188	6662370	Like, you had Mario World, then you had a bunch of other Mario games, then they went back and did Mario World 2.
6663151	6670236	So, you know, Mario 64 wasn't really the 64th game in the series, although it may have felt like his 64th appearance.
6671637	6671877	All right.
6672277	6675119	Well, I find this next story kind of interesting.
6692972	6721188	Classic FM is a radio station in the UK and they're trying to do a Hall of Fame contest that has what they consider the most inspirational and worthwhile compositions of the year the public votes on this so there's a campaign to try to get Final Fantasy Aerith I always want to say Aerith because I grew up that way but Aerith theme for Final Fantasy 7 as a song that's recognized which you know
6721608	6728296	Love or hate Final Fantasy 7, you gotta say that's a damn fine composition and fits in well with the classical theme
6730891	6740555	It's interesting to me kind of how much we've seen the video games kind of dip into classic music just within the past, I don't know, I want to say like five, six years, whenever they started Dear Friends.
6740936	6753061	Because Dear Friends, there's, you know, of course, Video Games Live, which was, I wouldn't really say as an eye dot the opera, but it definitely brings classical music and rock music together, you know, in a way.
6753681	6757203	But of course, Play, the video game orchestra, you know, there have been several of these.
6757223	6759644	And of course, there was More Friends, which really was not good.
6759944	6771017	I was there you guys, it was a mess but for the most part now we have what, the Zelda tour is happening right now and all this other stuff so there's definitely been a push to
6772099	6774341	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6794815	6796936	That actually wasn't my favorite music in the game, to be honest.
6797036	6797296	Really?
6797476	6802537	My favorite music in the game was the Jenova boss fight music right before that.
6802638	6804318	But see, that's not something that's really classic.
6804438	6804918	You know what I mean?
6805038	6806359	No, but I'm serious.
6806459	6808119	I thought the Aeritha scene was actually kind of boring.
6808419	6808820	Really?
6809360	6812221	And it wasn't really musically exciting.
6812341	6818203	I like really challenging and musically complex pieces.
6818363	6821664	So that's why I really liked the Jenova theme.
6822004	6822284	It was...
6823084	6824685	What was that particular Jenova theme?
6826746	6828246	Okay, go ahead and play some of it.
6828266	6836650	Well, I was going to play the Aerith theme because I see a comment in our chat room here at chat.orangelandredo.com Kaijudo says, I played Final Fantasy VII three times and I don't remember that theme.
6837130	6838010	I'm like, what?
6838030	6841232	All right, so here, yeah, I know.
6841712	6842392	But you know something?
6842612	6843312	Here we go.
6846334	6848034	This is right when she gets killed.
6848875	6852036	And this music is kind of used as an incidental throughout the whole game.
6855970	6856531	But it's sad.
6857111	6864759	It's pretty, but it's just... What it did at the time, though, this was so fucking revolutionary for video games.
6865060	6866121	You know, it really was.
6866641	6872848	I realize there's seven haters out there, but you've got to recognize there was nothing like this in games until here.
6873368	6879833	Yes, we had characters die in games before, but they didn't die on CD media in an epic RPG.
6879933	6881414	Well, Seles did throw herself off a cliff.
6881574	6883936	Right, but she blinked and disappeared, you know?
6885337	6888439	This was, like, big, you know?
6890841	6893423	Well, find the Jenova thing.
6894303	6895144	What was the actual name of it?
6895164	6895524	Do you remember?
6895705	6898907	It was... Hold on.
6901445	6902066	I think I can get it.
6902406	6903307	Just the Jenova theme?
6903828	6909554	No, it was... No, this wasn't it.
6909674	6914900	It was... I think it was the Jenova Absolute.
6919064	6919885	That's the one I liked.
6921487	6922408	Oh, I remember this too.
6924440	6926902	Because it was like the play on the fight theme.
6928283	6928843	And you know what?
6929283	6931284	I shouldn't dog this compared to the other one.
6931324	6932645	I mean, it definitely invokes the mood.
6933205	6937128	You know, a lot of the boss music in these games is supposed to get you pumped up.
6938448	6939629	But see, that's my thing.
6939669	6943751	When I look for musical pieces, I look for the complexity of the piece.
6944192	6948794	I'm not saying I didn't like the Aerith music, even as much as I hate the bitch herself.
6949555	6949695	Okay.
6950035	6953323	It's just, I thought her theme was a little formulaic.
6953824	6954365	I really did.
6955187	6956590	Yes, it needs to be recognized.
6956790	6960258	I think this is a much more mature piece of music, just saying.
6960919	6975749	Well, what's interesting, you know, despite whatever game you're going to pick from these games, you know, the fact that I don't think this station would otherwise get as many votes as they're going to get now that there's actually a Facebook campaign trying to get Nobuo Uematsu's theme recognized.
6975789	6976449	And you know what?
6976469	6983614	No matter what song they pick, Nobuo Uematsu himself should be recognized because that man has contributed so much for video game music.
6983654	6987036	Not just Final Fantasy, but some games that get grossly overlooked.
6987056	6987377	I met him.
6988117	6990499	Oh yeah, I sat two seats away from him.
6991139	6991640	Remember that?
6992000	6993122	When I went to your friends?
6993242	6998569	But I'll tell you, the other person that I met in music gaming who has been inspirational to me was Koji Kondo.
6999031	7004474	I was trying to get into the whole topic of does a video game theme deserve to be treated as a classical nod?
7004594	7005714	I say yeah, why not?
7026016	7035209	My one thing about this is that now if that was a full... Because keep in mind, the versions of the songs of Final Fantasy VII were rendered with the game engine.
7036351	7040296	If they had taken actual... Because, I mean, they're synthesized.
7040416	7041798	It's clearly synthesizer music.
7042399	7045002	It's very complex synthesizer music, but that's what it is.
7045662	7052568	If it had been classically recorded with a full orchestra and then presented, I think then maybe it could qualify.
7053309	7056131	But then you'd be looking into electronic music.
7056171	7058153	There's the Dear Friends version.
7059214	7063738	There was an event in Japan that preceded Dear Friends and inspired it.
7063978	7064319	Was it 2-2-2002?
7064339	7065960	It had some type of numberation in it.
7069443	7070745	Black Mage's CDs Black Mage's CDs
7085899	7086279	Video Game Music
7111267	7112488	Oh, um... Why is his name escaping me right now?
7112928	7113848	He's like one of my favorites.
7114849	7115889	I know who you're talking about.
7115909	7116369	Oh, God.
7116409	7117470	Alzheimer's setting in early.
7118950	7119510	No, Rob.
7120371	7121171	Yuzo Koshiro.
7121391	7121691	Yeah.
7122752	7131715	All right.
7133196	7133816	Let's move on.
7134696	7138558	This is the part of the show where we're going to go to the mailbag and read your emails.
7140020	7146926	Every week you guys email us at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura dives into the email bag head first.
7147026	7147807	It's a little sticky.
7148187	7149308	And reads the emails.
7149448	7150009	Sorry.
7150569	7151690	Mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio.
7151750	7152891	I spilled cranberry juice on it.
7153371	7156074	And this time I won't bitch about your grammar.
7157728	7158648	Hello, OLR.
7158848	7161869	After last week's episode, I felt a little compelled to write an email to you guys again.
7161909	7165150	I wanted to express how much I admire what you three are doing for such a long time.
7165591	7166991	Volunteering isn't always easy.
7167371	7169252	I'd like to tell my own story, if that's okay?
7169912	7170352	I guess.
7170672	7171513	You wrote along enough email.
7172393	7173533	Hey, every gamer gets a voice.
7174674	7175174	In my voice.
7176174	7178636	10 years ago, we started a team to rebuild the local playground.
7178996	7181438	It really needed a lot of work to be safe and nice again.
7181918	7185540	Of course, we have to raise money, and we organized a festival that lasted three days.
7185700	7189042	More than 60 people helped us, from local youth to older people.
7189803	7194646	People always have a great time during the festival because, just like you, we try to be very down-to-earth.
7195126	7195466	DarkSakura.com
7215121	7236958	and yes, sometimes I don't feel like I'm doing anything and sometimes it feels a little tedious but you pull through when in summertime you hear children play, laugh, scream and cry in the playground their parents read a book or their grandparents just sit and watch the grandchildren play it makes it all more than worth it it feels good to create a little space for people to be themselves and have a good time without having any troubles for a little while
7237818	7238578	I think that's a great thing.
7238859	7240519	That's volunteer work, essentially.
7240539	7242860	That's volunteering for your community and doing good.
7243420	7246641	A lot of people do that stuff and don't get paid a single dime.
7247462	7249882	I don't think you're crazy for only getting three days pay or whatever it was.
7249902	7255244	I think that they're actually raising the money for charity for the sake of keeping the playground upkeep.
7255464	7255925	That's great.
7256005	7256585	I think that's great.
7257505	7259687	OLR does that for its listeners too, I think.
7259807	7260627	Well, at least for me.
7260707	7262088	You guys are very down to earth too.
7262188	7266331	You don't go bragging about how fantastic you are or how you are just so outstanding at games.
7266632	7267072	I am.
7267812	7268313	No, I'm kidding.
7268873	7271795	You're just normal everyday people with the same problems as everyone else.
7271895	7274117	And funny as hell too, I do miss Rob Floods.
7275638	7275918	I don't.
7279416	7282337	I'm sorry if this email is a little long but it really comes from my heart.
7282857	7288219	You were three hours of feel good in a very troublesome time for a lot of people.
7288599	7290180	Thank you for doing this show for so long.
7290300	7293181	I hope it can go on for some time because without it I'd feel kind of lost.
7293521	7294321	You guys are awesome.
7294461	7296282	Yours truly, Fabrice from Belgium.
7297462	7298343	Aw, big hugs.
7298643	7298843	Yay.
7298863	7299743	All the way for Belgium.
7300043	7300283	And Rob.
7300303	7301564	What do you want, woman?
7309474	7309894	A cookie.
7310955	7311355	I hate you.
7311735	7312135	No, you don't.
7312175	7312735	You love me.
7313135	7313636	You know what, though?
7314016	7314756	I appreciate that.
7314816	7319498	Because I actually claim I don't want to be the best at gaming.
7319538	7321378	And I don't want you to think I'm the best at gaming.
7321958	7323999	I am just an average gamer.
7324139	7327821	Why would I be stupid enough to make that claim?
7328121	7328981	I know I'm not the best.
7329981	7331323	I am really good at Puzzle Bobble.
7331463	7332164	Just saying.
7345401	7346322	We all have our things.
7347222	7348403	No, we really appreciate it.
7348983	7352545	This whole show is kind of a way for us to get together on Sunday nights and just do this.
7352705	7355126	In some ways, it's become a habit.
7356427	7360789	I think we do this show out of habit at this point, but I don't know where I'm going with this.
7361310	7363611	When I have a week off, it feels really nice.
7363651	7365032	I'm not going to lie.
7365172	7369354	A week off here and there has been great, but if I had every week off, I think I'd be going like,
7370367	7371028	I'm really bored.
7371268	7371588	Yeah.
7372630	7374251	I really don't know what to do with my Sundays.
7374712	7377675	You know, without... Honestly, without the show.
7377695	7379257	Yeah.
7379437	7382221	You know, I actually feel... I hate to draw the comparison.
7382241	7383943	I feel the same way about babysitting Julian, too.
7384844	7385945	Because I love that kid.
7386586	7387467	And I love doing the show.
7388388	7390070	And I guess I like you guys.
7391431	7392892	I come here for Alan, really.
7393932	7394813	Alan and the cats.
7394973	7397594	Alan's only been in the picture for a couple of years, though.
7397614	7404497	He's only been living here for about 10 months.
7406237	7407598	There would definitely be a void in my life.
7407618	7408338	You know what's funny?
7408358	7410919	I was just talking today about the Oscars.
7410959	7412300	You know the Oscars are on next week?
7412720	7413781	Oscar Schmaskers
7435882	7442289	Even though, like, ten years ago, my friends would throw dinner parties where all the dishes were themed after the Best Picture nominees.
7442329	7443330	Like, how gay is that, right?
7444211	7446193	But it really happened, you know?
7446754	7449517	It's... This has just become a part of my life.
7449557	7450177	We've had scares.
7450698	7450898	Yeah.
7450978	7454882	We've had scares, but... But, you know, I'm gonna have to say this, is that even if...
7456544	7457805	The situation's made me move.
7457905	7459766	I would still try to find some way to make it work.
7459826	7462208	I would try everything until there was no other option.
7462408	7466451	I think even if OLR were to end, I mean, there is going to come a day where OLR ends.
7467151	7467972	Everything comes to an end.
7468232	7468592	Next week.
7469253	7469913	No, not next week.
7469933	7470213	Stop it.
7470794	7476678	But something will happen or whatever, and for whatever reason, we'll choose to end it.
7476998	7479300	But I just don't see me not podcasting.
7480280	7481261	I'd probably still do something.
7481281	7482582	I just have too big of a mouth.
7484716	7494005	Well, and we've actually, however we're going to make it work, still have a project in mind that kind of got put on the back burner because of stuff and things.
7494805	7496267	But we have stuff planned.
7496427	7497348	Curse that stuff and things.
7497648	7497908	I know.
7497928	7498969	All right, let's move on with emails.
7499890	7501832	This one comes from Haseo Sumi Ragawa.
7502833	7505155	And I'm not going to rag you on your grammar this time.
7505275	7506616	Like I said, I'm being a good girl.
7507917	7509158	She wants to get hired this week.
7510098	7510798	Capcom!
7512919	7513420	You know what?
7513540	7514620	I have to get a job this year.
7515161	7515661	I have to.
7516521	7516761	I know.
7517061	7519643	So all of you out there listening, you want to hire me.
7520743	7522324	I'm really amazing.
7522824	7524465	She doesn't like selling french fries, you guys.
7525345	7526987	I'm not going to work fast food.
7527167	7527647	I know you're not.
7528888	7533673	Dear OLR, Okay, recently I purchased a copy of The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Game of the Year Edition.
7533693	7535714	Now I'm enjoying it for the most part with the exception of one thing.
7536395	7540419	The Game of the Year Edition has a glitch in which when you are... Oh, shoot.
7540559	7541279	I sent this before.
7542861	7543982	I've read this email before.
7544402	7544702	You have?
7545163	7545683	Yes, I have.
7546144	7546924	Did you send it again?
7547325	7548606	Thanks for reading my email.
7549287	7550548	Yeah, it's the same email.
7552731	7553772	Elder Scrolls games broken, go figure.
7579289	7580410	Okay, last email.
7580450	7581391	Hey guys, Sterlok here.
7581912	7583013	Hi, Sterlok.
7583954	7586196	I'm sad to see the Cage Match ending after so long.
7586236	7586916	I've been listening since 2007.
7587857	7592762	I've discovered some great music thanks to the Cage Match, particularly the Birthday Massacre, Pendulum, and Goldfrapp.
7593323	7597286	That's all three of us, our big picks that we've done.
7597347	7598167	That is interesting.
7598468	7598648	Mm-hmm.
7600089	7602010	Because I, Birthday Massacre was my thing.
7602130	7605311	Pendulum is Loki's thing and Goldfrapp was definitely from you.
7605351	7605791	That is true.
7605811	7606572	I like Goldfrapp though.
7607532	7611534	I'll definitely miss it as it was a big part of my week and something I always looked forward to.
7612394	7616976	Well, maybe, maybe I'll suggest a song for you every week.
7617076	7617936	There'll be something, yeah.
7618437	7619957	Jamie will start a music advice blog.
7620837	7624399	You know, actually though, I did like the suggestion of post-show turntable.
7625583	7627224	D-Light I met her once
7655444	7656524	Nobody knows who she is, I'm sure.
7656885	7657125	All right.
7658005	7659525	Okay, so the rest of the email.
7659966	7660146	Yes.
7661206	7664407	That being said, however, I do respect your guys' decision to end the segment.
7664467	7665648	It's not fun for you anymore.
7665708	7669009	It's a little silly to continue, and you should devote your energy to something fresh and new.
7669649	7673831	I, like many die-hard Olarians, sort of see you guys as family.
7673931	7676611	I eagerly look forward to seeing whatever you come up with next.
7677612	7679553	Also, I have a podcast recommendation for Jamie.
7679733	7680573	Ooh, okay.
7681053	7681754	Thank you for watching!
7709252	7710152	Thank you, Sterlok.
7710192	7711033	You're such a sweetie.
7712173	7713214	I have the perfect idea.
7713734	7713954	What?
7714554	7720817	We're going to start a Tumblr that you, me, and Loki all have access to and we will post songs we think are cool.
7721377	7721577	Okay.
7721597	7721877	That's it.
7722218	7726459	And if people want music recommendations, we'll have a place where you can go look.
7726840	7727060	Okay.
7727640	7731301	And the great thing, unlike Cage Match, you'll be able to press the stop button.
7731582	7732062	You know what?
7732422	7733302	You know what we should call it?
7733662	7733863	Huh?
7734063	7735843	We should call our new Tumblr OLR Cage Match.
7736003	7736924	Fuck yeah, Cage Match.
7736944	7737224	Okay.
7737464	7739326	Yeah, fuck that cage message.
7740027	7742389	I swear to God, if one of you registers that, I'm going to go do it right now.
7742429	7742689	Hurry up.
7743791	7744111	Rob.
7744872	7745853	Well, okay.
7747114	7751719	I am actually... You know, I was actually thinking that...
7754506	7781892	I miss doing the comic book podcast I used to except comics are kind of they kind of blow now but I was thinking you know what we haven't seen there's classic gaming podcasts but there's no real history of gaming podcasts you know what I mean so okay I just want to throw the idea out there guys who would be interested in a history podcast like history of gaming
7783058	7805146	I would like to know who was interested in that and just email the mailbag also to the people who won Master System Games I am sorry I have had a midterm last week I have been uber busy I'm very sorry just send me an email it's my personal email which I have given you guys because only a few people out there have my real email and I will take care of it
7806447	7807268	as soon as I get paid.
7808229	7808849	Okay, I did it.
7808989	7811392	FuckYeahCageMatch.tumblr.com Okay.
7812213	7812593	I got it.
7812653	7813854	You know what song you should put up there first?
7813894	7814695	It should be from both of us.
7815296	7816697	No, I'm going to put the Troll-A-Lol song up first.
7816717	7816837	Okay.
7816857	7817458	The one last week.
7819240	7819880	Ho.
7820201	7820841	Why would I not?
7821102	7823784	Ooh, 10 hours of Troll-A-Lol.
7824565	7825045	What?
7825906	7827368	I want you to put Beth Dito up there.
7828504	7830646	I will start putting good songs on there later.
7831186	7834289	It's the same password as... I shouldn't say that.
7835269	7836770	As something else, I'm not going to say.
7837211	7839673	The same one we use for everything else except for that stuff?
7839693	7840934	Don't fucking say that.
7841674	7842415	I was being silly.
7842455	7844296	I said for everything except for that other stuff?
7844356	7845337	Yes, exactly.
7846358	7847959	God, no one knows what our password is anyway.
7848780	7850101	Except for Ranma.
7850761	7851061	All right.
7853143	7853503	Lord.
7854364	7854624	Anyhow...
7855891	7857332	Rob, you make me ashamed.
7857732	7858013	Why?
7858493	7859073	I'm just kidding.
7859093	7859414	Don't say that.
7859434	7859974	You make me sad.
7860374	7861815	Rob, you should get me some Pinkberry.
7862236	7862476	No.
7862756	7866859	See, that's the reason why we're actually quitting Afterbirth so we can go get Pinkberry after the show.
7867839	7869501	We've decided that Pinkberry is more important.
7869541	7869881	I'm kidding.
7872683	7883571	I actually, hearing people being positive about the end of the cage match, it's not really just the cage match, it's the whole Afterbirth, makes me happy.
7884011	7885332	But you know what makes me pissed off?
7887238	7898538	Rob not starting the FUs of the week music I didn't know that we were done with the mailbag mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com and now the FUs of the week
7914511	7915652	I guess I really don't have an FU.
7916472	7917233	No, I'm kidding.
7918493	7930099	FU to not having an iPad and my hand hurting like a bitch while I was trying to eat a Mongolian barbecue today and for Rob telling me that my dinner was stinky.
7932700	7933541	It was a little stinky.
7933901	7938203	It was just garlic and onions and lamb and moms.
7939204	7942065	And an FU to me not having an awesome job.
7942906	7943486	Capcom!
7945441	7972346	I want to work for you I would be a proud employee of Capcom but then I couldn't talk about your games on OLR anymore that would be a good reason to end OLR though, just saying Jamie got a job at Capcom, we have to end the show MDAs, ending the show you and Loki could keep it up I would just show up as your celebrity guest it would be weird we'd have to change the name it would be Rob and Loki on games because it wouldn't be OLR anymore
7973607	7979189	Yeah, so really though, I mean honestly, I am kind of in pissy mode about not having a job.
7979649	7984271	And also F you to my girl bits.
7986172	7989634	For not growing a small person.
7991794	7994055	I finally gave up and opened my bottle of chocolate wine.
7994275	7994696	My mom was 37.
7996456	7997057	I don't want to be 37.
7999346	7999606	Ever!
8000287	8001748	No, I'm kidding.
8001988	8007371	Yeah, I gave up and I opened the bottle of wine I was saving for getting knocked up.
8008332	8009612	So, done.
8009652	8010233	It'll happen.
8010853	8011554	Don't get discouraged.
8012234	8014255	You know what, I have a co-worker going through a very similar thing.
8015236	8015636	No, I'm done.
8016116	8016677	I'm done.
8017458	8018319	Loki, your FU's of the week.
8041573	8042494	Thanks for watching!
8068087	8078282	So, fuck you to eBay for even having that as an option of something to feed back on because, really, they have all that information, they're just being fucking lazy so they can hold your money.
8080751	8081892	Alright, my FU of the week.
8082092	8085894	Actually, all things considered, I've had a pretty good week, so I can't complain too much.
8086354	8091937	So, I regretfully have to give an FU of the week to Sanrio, who's one of our cats.
8092338	8097641	She decided to claw me this morning when I picked her up because I banged my head on the door and it scared the shit out of her, so she clawed me.
8098401	8098921	And it hurt.
8099362	8101083	So, FU to the cat for clawing me.
8101823	8102724	So, there you go.
8103704	8104745	No KTs for you.
8105225	8108527	KT is short for a word I can't say because the cat understands what it means.
8108707	8109607	And she will run in here.
8109787	8109987	Yes.
8110328	8112789	It rhymes with bitty meats.
8113789	8114370	KT.
8114990	8117531	So they actually know what that means and they'll run out here screaming.
8117832	8119713	You know, I actually never have to say the word around Shermie.
8120193	8120473	Really?
8120913	8122514	I just have to say, is it time?
8123415	8124915	And she'll go, mm.
8124955	8125396	They know.
8125716	8126076	They know.
8126956	8127937	Shermie loves her greenies.
8128985	8132227	Alright, there it is, your FUs of the week.
8132447	8134829	That segment will not be going anywhere anytime soon, just so you know.
8135249	8137110	I realize it has nothing to do with games, but you know what?
8138191	8138571	We don't care.
8138631	8139172	Sometimes we're mad.
8140332	8140993	Loki!
8141033	8141433	You mad?
8141633	8142053	More gaming news.
8142073	8142554	You mad, Rob?
8142574	8142874	You mad?
8143354	8143634	I'm mad.
8143654	8143634	2.0.
8144675	8144855	Heart.
8146676	8150739	Alright, so let's talk a little bit about indie games and, you know...
8151744	8156348	No one's going to disagree with the fact that they're kind of hard to find sometimes.
8157749	8166095	Microsoft seems to kind of bury them pretty well within their new dashboard revisions and the like.
8166575	8177003	So, of course, it's up to the indies to take matters into their own hands and launch their own Xbox Live Indie Game app for Windows Phone 7.
8178545	8179385	So they have done that.
8179505	8188213	There's actually an app that ties with Xboxindies.com and it gathers different feed data based on that.
8189034	8198723	And you can actually search and link to the actual pages where you can buy them and send them to your Xbox using this app.
8200064	8214874	and some other features that they're adding that aren't really part of the indie games portion of the dashboard as it is are like some dev picks and recommendations based on that kind of stuff.
8215434	8227098	So, that's kind of cool, and apparently this is going to be coming to other phone operating systems like Android and iOS later on, but right now it's just Windows Phone 7.
8227678	8237122	But really, it's kind of sad that they even have to do this because the fact that it's just so poorly laid out on the current dashboard, but, you know.
8238162	8246750	It is what it is, so... At least now you can find that if you happen to have a Windows Phone 7, although I don't, so... Oh well.
8249432	8253836	I find that interesting, though, that the community is helping to fill in the gaps.
8255117	8257199	It's just sad that they're treating it the way... I mean...
8259304	8262925	I mean, it's just, it's really hard to nail down that stuff.
8277929	8306424	I really wish that Microsoft's web interface was better because you know you can find all those indie games on Xbox.com or whatever but it's not easy to navigate that store and I think it would be really great if they would build something in the web because I think that's a great feature to be able to queue up Xbox downloads from the web I did that with the DLC I bought this week for Rhythm Party just so I wouldn't forget to do it I think they should use the web more to promote the indie games they really should
8308160	8309482	Well, that's just my thought.
8310983	8323078	Alright, well, speaking of, you know, things we can't believe have been implemented by now, I still can't believe that Apple has not put out an official, tangible game button device that works with the iPhone and iPad.
8323098	8324079	Yeah, it's been third party.
8324319	8325521	Yeah, it's always been third party.
8325561	8327963	Well, one of the biggest ones is the iCade, and...
8328785	8331388	Icade is getting adopted as the standard now
8343326	8347529	IK8 is now putting out a new controller that's called the 8Bitty.
8348630	8350352	It is basically an NES controller.
8350632	8354615	It's totally what they're jacking here, except it has four buttons instead of two.
8355736	8358038	But hey, the NES controller was a great controller.
8358618	8360540	Kind of flimsy looking back on it.
8361200	8363082	But when I was 11, that thing was rock solid.
8364083	8370027	$25 if you want this thing on ThinkGeek, and it will work on all the games that the iCade cabinet works with.
8370368	8373330	There's a D-pad, start, select, and four buttons.
8373590	8375051	I don't know what they're called, but they're there.
8375752	8376132	There you go.
8376392	8377613	And it looks neat.
8377693	8388982	It looks a little Atari to me, which is strange because it's the 8-bitty, but it looks like it has kind of like that wood paneling look on the sides, and then kind of that rainbow color that kind of some of the old Atari art had.
8389063	8391945	So it's kind of a mishmash of different video game worlds.
8392205	8392285	IKAD
8414850	8416251	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8444205	8464135	there is the Vespula dual-sided gaming mouse mat, the Black Widow Ultimate gaming keyboard, the Razer Onza Tournament Edition Xbox 360 controller, the Chimera Xbox 360 gaming headset, iPhone 4S protection case, and N7 messenger bag.
8464696	8467077	So this is kind of big bucks of stuff.
8467597	8470579	But it's all Mass Effect 3.
8472580	8472980	What do you think?
8473982	8475583	I actually have a Razer mouse now.
8475643	8479364	I got one on Woot, the Tron Razer mouse that came out for that.
8480345	8481485	I really love that mouse.
8481966	8492050	My only complaint is that I tend to click the side buttons when I don't intend to, so I had to actually just disable them because one of them was set to mouse sensitivity, and that would really screw me up mid-raid.
8492871	8494231	But otherwise, I love that mouse.
8494411	8496532	I love that it lights up and plays the Tron music.
8496872	8498213	The geek in me giggles every time.
8498755	8516422	Well, the other thing about this, too, is that on Razor's website, they're saying that this Mass Effect 3 Collector's Edition peripherals and gear come with a redeemable code to unlock bonus items for Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, including the Deadly Collector Assault Rifle to give you a leg up on the Reaper invasion.
8516442	8516982	I'm quoting here.
8517562	8521844	If you have already unlocked the Collector Assault Rifle, this code will strengthen the weapon further.
8523124	8525725	And, of course, the game comes out in the U.S.
8526066	8526546	on March 9th.
8531034	8534756	That's kind of interesting, bundling the DLC with peripherals.
8534816	8538057	But I guess, I mean, at one point there was DLC on Pepsi bottles, right?
8538137	8540018	So I guess this isn't anything too new.
8540238	8540939	You know what we need?
8540959	8541979	To entice the real fans.
8542539	8545501	Sega needs to get their ass in gear and give us Pepsi, man.
8545681	8546941	But the problem is, here's the thing.
8547081	8549522	I mean, I'm not into Mass Effect, but I know a lot of people that are.
8549643	8554765	And if I was into Mass Effect, like, I wouldn't want that mouse anyway because I have the Tron mouse now.
8556186	8556446	1-877-GAME-OLR
8577819	8587409	Alright, I know this is going to come as a shocker to you, so please be prepared, but Activision is making another Call of Duty game.
8587670	8588511	Get out.
8588891	8590933	And it's coming out this fall.
8591033	8592075	Shut the front door.
8592255	8593236	I know, it's just...
8594719	8597284	I cannot believe that kind of news.
8598966	8602072	It just boggles my mind.
8603634	8607861	I don't even know why websites are running this story because it's stupid.
8610519	8613141	Here we are reporting on it.
8613201	8613902	Here we are.
8613942	8622210	Yeah, there is a few French retailers, I think it may have even been Amazon, that listed Call of Duty Black Ops 2.
8622790	8624292	Well, goody.
8625313	8632299	Then on top of that, there's also this now developer, not really a developer, but kind of...
8633480	8650238	contract art studio employee he had listed one of the pieces that he worked on was Call of Duty Black Ops 2 of course now he has that taken his whole profile is taken off of LinkedIn but um
8652515	8653556	Yeah, I mean, come on.
8653676	8657099	If you're surprised of this news, then you're an idiot.
8657219	8660401	I mean, because there is seriously... This is just crazy talk.
8660441	8662803	I mean, what's gonna happen next, Loki?
8662883	8663744	Madden 13?
8665365	8666646	There's already Madden 13.
8669169	8671991	I just... My mind is blown.
8672992	8673512	I know, man.
8674012	8674333	I know.
8676414	8678256	I don't know what to tell you, but...
8680336	8682037	I mean, there's not going to be a Guitar Hero 6.
8682498	8684019	There may actually not be a Guitar Hero 6.
8684980	8688223	There's a possibility that there will be, but yeah.
8688443	8688743	All right.
8689904	8691005	One more news story for you guys.
8691025	8696089	Then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8696249	8699452	Due to the delay, it's probably actually already open by the time you're hearing this.
8700373	8701294	This is a quick story.
8701374	8707599	This is about the interesting repercussions of the Kickstarter campaign.
8707879	8709900	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8729171	8735313	The folks at InXile Entertainment are going to start a Kickstarter, at least they've mentioned their intentions to.
8736173	8743296	They did Hunted the Demon's Forge, but the game that they want to use Kickstarter to do is fund a reboot of Wasteland.
8744856	8750818	Brian Fargo, who's the CEO, recently got the rights to this role-playing game that was on the PC back in 98, question mark?
8754159	8781486	I guess it's really a cult popular title because fans have been asking for a remake and it's very early in planning but after seeing what happened with Double Fine the CEO Brian Fargo is on board and they would have to raise a million dollars for that to happen I've got to be bluntly honest I played a lot of old school PC games and especially Commodore 64 growing up this game did not ring a bell to me and I'm sure there's fans of the game that are like Rob you're stupid you suck
8781866	8783787	But I did not know of Wasteland ever.
8783827	8784727	I went and looked it up on Wiki.
8784747	8787589	Yeah, it's apparently what Fallout's based off of.
8788089	8788449	Is it?
8788529	8789510	Okay, well now that makes sense.
8789810	8795753	Yeah, I was looking, even in the little screenshot, there seemed to be some kind of comparisons, but yeah.
8796073	8797314	This series is really old.
8797354	8800675	It goes all the way back to... It was 88, not 98.
8801296	8802676	That's how old this game is.
8803797	8806038	Apple II and Commodore 64 and all that.
8806078	8809139	See, I don't remember playing it on Commodore 64, and God, I thought I'd played everything.
8810040	8810160	So...
8811260	8813101	That'll be interesting if that can actually get rebooted.
8814422	8819685	But who knows how many people will be willing to put their money where their mouth is.
8819845	8822346	Dungeon Buster in our chatroom says, Wasteland is awesome.
8822726	8825548	Yeah, but will you pay 15 bucks to see a new one in advance?
8826368	8826729	We'll see.
8827650	8829092	The Skype line is now open.
8829112	8833397	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8833477	8834358	Go ahead and give us a call.
8834378	8837182	We're going to take some calls before we close out the show.
8837242	8840927	In the meantime, we're going to move to our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
8841527	8843850	Our first tweet tonight is from Dark Tetsuya.
8844491	8849533	There's an indie game jam type thing I'm going to be partaking in, so wish me luck.
8850074	8852955	And sends us a link to this thing at Glorious Train Wrecks.
8853055	8854175	What in the world is this?
8855936	8856597	Pirate Cart 5...
8858638	8859779	Okay, you gotta tell me what this is.
8859819	8864581	We're making loads of awesome and or terrible games and taking them to GDC to blow minds with them.
8864641	8870845	Over the weekend of February 25th to 26th, everyone is invited to make as many games as they can and submit them here.
8871505	8876408	After the event is over, we will package the games up into a launcher like we did with previous Pirate Cards.
8876488	8880130	And then this March, we will be showing them off in a kiosk at the Game Developers Conference.
8880530	8882091	And they want everyone to participate.
8882451	8883591	That's kind of interesting.
8884412	8886353	Like, please, make...
8886693	8888514	All these games, we just want to flood.
8888954	8891755	It's almost like, let's throw something against the wall and see what sticks.
8892816	8894496	I don't know how else to phrase that, but we've got a call.
8894536	8895537	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
8895557	8895957	Who's this?
8896637	8897918	It's me, Swamp Tom.
8898398	8899679	Hey, Swamp Tom?
8900399	8900719	Yeah.
8900979	8901579	Hey, what's up?
8902460	8902960	None much.
8903060	8904881	This is my first time calling, obviously.
8905081	8907482	I was going to say, I don't recognize the name, but welcome to the show.
8908322	8909804	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8927091	8928412	You're on the west coast!
8928492	8929532	It's not that late!
8929572	8930753	Yeah, but I work night shift.
8930813	8932634	I don't get off of work until like 4am.
8933174	8934415	Alright, you're excused then.
8934835	8942278	And the only reason why I remembered was, because I don't know about you, but on Sundays, like Loki, I usually eat a big ass burger.
8942859	8946900	And I think it's because I'm getting older, I fall asleep after I eat.
8949082	8953924	So it's like, I get food coma, so by the time I wake up, it's like 9 o'clock.
8954524	8956325	And it's already over, so there's no point.
8957921	8960123	Yes, I have had similar things going on.
8960183	8961203	It's usually after work.
8961284	8963105	I'll come home from work and it's like, nap.
8963565	8967188	I mean, you probably do something similar, but of course you also work the night shifts, so there you go.
8967228	8967888	Yeah, it sucks.
8967928	8970090	That's the reason why I'm gaining weight, too.
8970150	8971131	I eat and I sleep.
8971731	8974773	Time to start playing Rhythm Party and walk a mile every day.
8974873	8978756	Yeah, I can't do that, though, because I get home at four and I live in an apartment.
8979077	8980057	Oh, yeah.
8980217	8983240	Isn't Seattle kind of nice, though, or are there bad parts?
8983260	8983620	Yeah.
8984754	8985534	There's bad parts.
8986435	8987576	I love Seattle for the record.
8987596	8988357	Like Tacoma.
8988597	8989018	I'm kidding.
8989558	8992381	No, Tacoma is actually pretty bad in a lot of ways.
8993322	8994843	I know, but I didn't want to actually say that.
8994863	8998246	We went to PAX, obviously, a few years ago, and then I was in Seattle.
8998406	9003131	I just went for fun January of 2010, I think.
9003451	9006133	I know, because you were there for Martin Luther King.
9006374	9007875	You were going to see a friend or something.
9007955	9008636	Are you a stalker?
9009076	9010077	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9028633	9054425	there's some money questions that have to be answered in my life as I'm sure we all have going on this year but I swear I'm doing everything I can to come to PAX this year because I miss it so this year you will know what I look like last year for some odd reason the tickets sold out really quick and I couldn't find any tickets for the three day passes so I had to buy Friday, Saturday and Sunday all separate yeah that sucked get in on it early this year to what do we really owe the call?
9054465	9056466	this call's been five years in the making what's on your mind?
9057165	9064993	Well, like I said, I was reminded that the show was on tonight because I was half asleep and I was watching a movie called, well, it's a dumb movie.
9065033	9065894	It's 17 again.
9066094	9066815	It's on Netflix.
9067476	9068977	I've actually heard it was really good.
9069638	9070919	Yeah, well, for the time, yeah.
9070939	9075064	But anyways, they go into like this club and it's called Orange Lounge.
9075664	9078147	And I was like, oh, Orange Lounge is on.
9078187	9079909	So I turned on the computer and here I am.
9081116	9083840	We're going to fucking sue their asses for jacking our name.
9084601	9086764	Yeah, we'll do that when the Moba Moga people get us.
9086784	9087265	Yeah, that's right.
9087305	9089208	Konami could probably get us first.
9089708	9091330	But we're Orange Lounge Radio.
9092252	9093153	Yeah, there you go.
9093173	9094034	There's the radio part.
9094154	9098100	But anyways, my question was, why don't you like Terraria?
9099575	9100255	Oh, God.
9100636	9101116	I knew it.
9101196	9104557	Rabid Minecraft-y fans calling in.
9104597	9105498	Why do you hate our game?
9105978	9106538	I don't hate it.
9106638	9109139	I just didn't understand it at all.
9109560	9110380	Like, I'm trying to play it.
9110900	9111360	Here's the thing.
9112321	9114622	I think you have to be an artistic person to get into those games.
9115162	9120284	And if you ever saw my art, which is ironic because I did the design thing for a little bit.
9120384	9121865	Like, I don't know why I was able to do that.
9122225	9123086	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9143732	9144533	I didn't hate it.
9144733	9146755	In a way, WoW was like that for me too.
9146855	9151378	I started, but I played for like two minutes because I was like, I don't know what to do.
9151739	9152459	I don't know where to go.
9153260	9154100	When did you play WoW?
9155141	9155382	Huh?
9155542	9156362	When did you play WoW?
9157663	9159105	Was it recently or a long time ago?
9159725	9161086	It was like a year and a half ago.
9161607	9163248	That was Cataclysm then.
9163488	9163888	Might have been.
9163908	9168572	With the Cataclysm expansion, they redid the beginner stuff, so it might be a little better now.
9168792	9170494	I hated WoW before that, and I really like it now.
9171429	9172629	Oh, yeah.
9173109	9174730	And plus, I have no friends to talk to.
9175050	9181111	So it's just like I'm walking around and like I'll see a character and I'll talk to him or at least I think I'm talking to him anyways.
9181571	9183132	And like, I don't know.
9183152	9186332	I just feel like I'm barging in or like I'm like a stalker.
9186592	9187832	Like, hey, look, there's a person.
9188153	9190493	So I go over there, talk, and then they just walk away.
9190533	9193434	I'm like, oh, it's like real life.
9193634	9194054	It's weird.
9194134	9195154	People in WoW don't want to talk.
9195174	9195534	Wait a minute.
9195774	9199655	You have no friends in WoW, but you've got friends IRL, right?
9200433	9201154	No, not really.
9202174	9203275	Well, because I work night shift.
9203315	9208139	I have friends from school and stuff, but when I want to hang out, everyone's sleeping.
9208740	9212723	He seems like he's mentally stable, at least from what we're getting in this call.
9212743	9214144	I'll be your well, buddy.
9214204	9214945	We'll be your friend.
9215325	9216466	You can add me on Steam.
9216486	9220029	Yeah, I have Steam too, but I have no friends on Steam.
9220489	9222771	So it's like, there's no games to play with anyone.
9222951	9226594	Because I look on forums and stuff, because there's shows that have forums, but
9227034	9230576	Like every now and then I look in the forum and there's trolls all the time.
9230596	9231736	So it's just like, wow.
9231836	9232477	No, no, no.
9232557	9234678	There's a safe place on Steam for you.
9235098	9240340	You're going to go to orangelaunchradio.com and on the left-hand side there's a little box that says – or no, now it's in the upper right.
9240400	9241461	It says interact with us.
9241661	9242882	I don't even know my own damn site.
9243602	9247164	And there's a little picture of the Steam icon and that will take you to the OLR Steam community.
9247224	9251265	And we have one rule in the OLR Steam community and that is – Don't be a dick.
9251406	9251986	Don't be a dick.
9252526	9253967	So you're not going to get that.
9254307	9261009	And if you get it, I want screenshots and you report their asses to me and I will sick Jamie on them.
9262329	9263050	I will slap a bitch.
9264190	9267391	And if you want to find me, I'm not there as DarkSakura, I'm there as Kurosabasa.
9267651	9269292	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9288268	9292029	I am smart, but I don't understand the whole 8-bit and 16-bit.
9292289	9293950	But it's got kind of like that same aesthetic.
9294270	9298111	So that's why I was wondering why you didn't like it because I know you like older games.
9298151	9299491	And it's 2D.
9299791	9300371	It's not 3D.
9300411	9301332	I played Minecraft.
9301392	9304653	I hated Minecraft because it's 3D, but the world looks like crap.
9305993	9306794	Thank you for watching!
9326827	9353201	from previous versions of the game it's just they keep adding on to it and it's just something very addictive about it and like me and my girlfriend like uh sometimes on the weekends we'll play and we'll make our own house together okay wait a minute wait a minute no stop stop you don't have friends but you're getting laid you have that's why that's why you don't have friends that's why you don't have friends and this is the woman saying it no i'm kidding i'm kidding okay i'm glad i'm glad at least you're getting taken care of all right
9354522	9381036	I'm getting taken care of in that way but you know after a while when you live with someone for like two years we've been together for four but like after a while you kind of want friends you know sure like okay you want to go out on a double date once in a while yeah we're not married but if we are is this how it's going to be I'm going to tell you something when I moved out here from Alabama all I had really was Dan and his friends and actually one of his friends became my best friend Becky
9381916	9393292	Um, but it wasn't until I actually started venturing out to the arcades when we had good ones and made friends on my own and found other groups that I could get involved with.
9393732	9399180	I'm now like three people, like three or four people that I met at school are now really good friends of mine.
9399600	9401961	And I will say this on Jamie's behalf.
9402301	9405642	The best road trips that Jamie and Dan have ever taken have been with me.
9406943	9408823	They really have because Rob's heard us fight.
9409443	9410484	I will say this though.
9410544	9413725	Every time I go to like – because there's GameWorks in Seattle.
9414085	9421908	Every time I go there and I play DDR, there's like this one weird person that like walks up to the DDR machine because I'm pretty good at DDR.
9422008	9422488	And licks it?
9423128	9424289	I can beat Max 300 pretty easily.
9425709	9449394	but like people will just like come up to me just stare at me when i'm done they like kind of follow me you know and like ask me questions and like cling on it's kind of weird so i kind of just stopped with that scene wait did you say they ask you questions and cling on uh they cling on oh because i was gonna say you should just reply yeah uh i just get weirded out that's it
9449574	9449995	Yes.
9450035	9450115	Yes.
9468616	9469977	I don't know if there's an easy way to handle it.
9470217	9477763	You can either be nice if you want to or you can just be like, okay, you're violating some kind of code here and you gotta go.
9477783	9478964	Yeah, but that's the thing.
9479004	9482647	I don't say that to people because I'm kind of nice and I don't want to get in those situations.
9483728	9486390	If I was in that position, I'd be like, oh, this guy's a dick.
9488431	9489192	So I don't really do that.
9489212	9490993	I just kind of brush him off lightly.
9491093	9493795	I smoke, but I don't smoke that much.
9494075	9495997	So if someone follows me, I know that
9496517	9520802	they don't smoke because you can tell a smoker from a non-smoker sure so i'll just smoke you just have to breathe in their face like kind of it's like my repellent like like bees it's kind of like smoke you throw them on bees because you don't want them to sting you so they just run away wait a minute you're a smoker and you can beat max 300 yeah that's a pretty big achievement i mean i gotta say i'm not going to judge you for the smoking thing because i smoked for years but i would have never been able to beat max 300 as a smoker
9522202	9523904	Well, yeah, it's pretty easy.
9523964	9527647	I mean, like if you smoke and you regularly exercise, you get used to it.
9528715	9530936	Alright, well, you know what?
9531056	9537160	I gotta let you go so we can get more calls, but I will give Terraria a second chance.
9537500	9541222	And seriously, go to the Steam community, and I see people giving out their name in chat right now.
9542883	9544323	You can have people to play Terraria with.
9545384	9550186	I love the show, and do not quit, because if you quit, I'm gonna find you in LA or wherever you are.
9550507	9552067	Sacramento, but that's all you get.
9552488	9552748	Alright.
9554525	9555847	It's like Seattle, but less rain.
9556468	9556729	All right.
9556769	9556949	Yeah.
9557470	9557731	All right.
9558111	9558372	Later.
9558933	9559173	Later.
9559774	9560415	That was a fun call.
9561197	9562339	I let it go on a little longer.
9562399	9565404	Usually I try to keep it five minutes, but hey, he was a long time listener for some time.
9565424	9566967	I spelled mine out in chat, so.
9567585	9571188	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Laundry Radio.
9571208	9573570	By the way, I just want to say with that last call, I'm not endorsing smoking.
9573710	9576312	It's just I'm not going to be that guy that's like, you need to quit smoking right now.
9577293	9579735	Trust me, smokers, they know the choice they're making.
9580035	9581356	And I've heard the pros and cons.
9581617	9586281	And you usually just have to have something happen where you're like, okay, I'm going to quit.
9587041	9590664	So that's what happened to me is finally I just hit a point where something happened.
9590684	9592746	And I was like, you know what, I'm now going to quit.
9593387	9594588	So anyhow.
9595751	9601094	I just wanted to talk about the article you were talking about video game music being in the hall of fame
9623320	9624981	Yes, the classic music in the Hall of Fame.
9625001	9625741	What do you want to say about it?
9627062	9637067	Well, basically you talk about whether it should be recognized as classical music or it should be recognized there in the Hall of Fame.
9637127	9645931	And I think, and this is a very strong opinion of mine, that it should be recognized as music by everyone.
9647892	9648832	Well, absolutely.
9648912	9651073	But what about classical music?
9651313	9652314	That's the key thing.
9653666	9655687	Well, that's the thing.
9655887	9660630	I don't consider it as classical music, at least.
9662831	9671515	Because, well, you're talking about genres and all that, and video game music is more, how do you say it, contemporary?
9672376	9673116	More modern?
9673136	9674397	Yeah, I agree with you.
9675720	9681508	So as classical music, I don't think it should be categorized.
9681848	9685914	So like that, I don't think so.
9686014	9689379	But it should definitely be recognized.
9692273	9717288	Alright, well, I mean, it's just, I think there's a lot of like contemporary classical, which is a really weird term, but I guess it's like, you know, when you kind of write your music with that classical sound and you're influenced with that, and I don't know, I get that, I get that sense, like it's very, I think that's why things like Dear Friends work, is that they feel like a night out at the orchestra, but it's music I killed monsters to.
9719576	9727360	Well, the thing with me is that classical music is more like Beethoven, Mozart, things like that.
9728361	9738926	And while some music, especially in Final Fantasy, that is heavily orchestrated, well, it sounds like classical music, but it isn't.
9739346	9741527	It isn't a classical piece.
9742268	9746490	It's an orchestrated modern piece, but it isn't classical.
9748186	9749107	Okay, okay.
9749507	9754432	So maybe they're just, and I'm sure there's a better word to define this genre of music.
9754492	9755593	You know what it makes me think of?
9755974	9758316	It makes me think of fusion, like Vanessa May.
9759797	9760098	Okay.
9760518	9764762	And what, like if I were to look in a CD store, wouldn't that be like adult contemporary?
9764822	9766424	But then that makes me think like Celine Dion or something.
9766464	9767425	It would be under instrumental.
9768706	9768846	Yeah.
9768886	9769647	Okay, okay.
9770894	9772777	or sometimes you find them under world music.
9773037	9773498	Sometimes.
9773938	9781369	Do you think that if this gets enough votes I was going to say one more place you find video game music there is under soundtrack sections because I find it all the time at Dimble.
9781890	9782070	True.
9782762	9787925	Do you think if there is... Oh, I like this comment from Blackwolf in our chat at chat.orange.radio.com.
9787965	9791247	Classical is a style of music, not an era of music.
9791788	9793108	Maybe a different way of thinking about it.
9793148	9796451	Maybe you're thinking about classical in the era sense.
9797171	9802915	But all this stuff aside, what it is or what it isn't, we just know we like this music.
9804135	9819172	do you think if it wins the poll do you think that the UK radio station will ultimately recognize it or do you think they'll reject it as like oh it's these silly gamer fanboys are doing this and we're just gonna throw their votes out
9821158	9840686	well they maybe recognize it and all because well the people bought it for it so I don't think why it shouldn't be but like I said and maybe BlackWool has a point but like I said it isn't classical in the sense that it it hasn't like
9842123	9844044	Like I said, it isn't very classical.
9844084	9849785	It isn't something from the 1800s or the 1700s.
9850765	9851486	It's modern.
9851526	9855447	It's something like... It's recent.
9855567	9863189	And there's other outside of video games that also have...
9864249	9870533	Black Wolf is a musician and is trained for that but this is my opinion and like I said it isn't for me.
9879380	9880221	Video Game Music Ever
9902752	9912415	That is a very tough question for me, especially since I'll make a little plug here.
9913016	9919798	I love that song, I love that music, articles we do for all our, me and Dr. Tsuya.
9920499	9928242	We try to pick, at least in my personal perspective, I try to pick something that it is and that recognized.
9929082	9940583	But if I had to pick one soundtrack that I really, really like, it should be, and I think I may...
9941665	9954850	Maybe I will think of another in the future, but I think the Silent Hill 2 soundtrack is awesome.
9955030	9955750	Interesting direction.
9955810	9956471	No, it's great.
9956631	9956851	It is.
9956891	9957831	That's a great pick.
9958972	9959952	Interesting direction.
9960372	9966955	That's not one I usually hear people say is their absolute favorite, but it's really damn good, so I'm not surprised to hear that at all.
9967995	9968996	Akira Yamaguchi is great.
9969316	9969916	He's a great guy.
9970396	9976619	Yeah, Akira Yamaoka is like my one of my favorite composers if not the best in video game music.
9976699	9978320	And definitely not something I would call classical.
9978620	9978880	Alright.
9979640	9980101	Definitely.
9980921	9982582	On the same note, I actually prefer Silent Hill 3.
9983382	9983922	That soundtrack.
9984023	9985363	Yeah, but still, it's all Akira.
9985443	9986044	That's really good.
9986704	9990306	Alright, Actdeft, I gotta let you go to try and get one more call in before the end of the show, but have a great night, okay?
9990906	9991206	You too.
9991306	9991886	Alright, thanks buddy.
9993607	9996008	Quick, one more quick call we cannot make time for.
9996288	9999350	We're running a little long, but we took an extended break and then...
10000990	10004352	We had a long call there to start, but I'll try to squeeze in one more quick call.
10004372	10008815	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio if you want to give us a call.
10009596	10010156	Twitter topics.
10010176	10011117	I got to get through those real quick.
10011137	10012058	I only got through the first one.
10012698	10014159	Tiger Claw sent in a couple quick ones.
10014199	10015440	I'll try to get out here quick.
10015940	10019283	BAFTA nominations, which we missed talking about on the show.
10019823	10022285	BAFTA is the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.
10022365	10029149	They have released the nominations for the 2012 Video Game Awards, which honors the top games from 2011, the year before, and
10030530	10033974	and they've nominated in various categories, Action, Artistic Achievement.
10034294	10046447	I don't really have time to read all of these games, but I will say quickly the Game Award of the Year, Batman Arkham City, Battlefield 3, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, FIFA 12, L.A.
10046807	10051031	Noire, Minecraft, Portal 2, Elder Scrolls, Skyrim, Legend of Zelda, Skyward Sword and Uncharted 3.
10051372	10051552	Phone.
10052571	10053812	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10053832	10054232	Who's this?
10054952	10056453	Hey, this is Bobby Blackwolf.
10056893	10057793	Oh, hey, Bobby.
10058134	10059554	What could you ever be calling in about?
10059594	10060335	What's on your mind?
10060855	10069659	So Wikipedia says classical music is the art music produced in or rooted in the traditions of Western liturgical and secular music.
10070619	10078663	So it's all about the style and not necessarily when it was composed because Leonard Bernstein was a great classical composer and he was born this century.
10079637	10085682	So does that mean that Kabuki theater music would not be considered classical because it's Eastern?
10088724	10090986	Basically, classical is mostly Western music, yeah.
10091987	10096650	According to a lot of the terminology here, it's usually American or European.
10096810	10098412	Where would you find something like Brian Eno?
10098472	10100573	Is that classical or is that considered New Age?
10101834	10102595	Probably New Age.
10103656	10107639	Because I've played both classical and I play New Age music.
10108779	10110702	as have I and Jazz.
10111102	10112624	So Bobby, what do you think?
10112644	10118211	Of course, Bobby, I got to let you plug your show here, which you're on before us at All Games Radio, of course, on Sunday nights.
10118752	10126421	But what do you think about the whole trying to push for video game recognition on a classical music station?
10127921	10131125	I think it's great because... And here's the thing.
10131165	10135270	Everybody's like, oh, well, that wasn't even the best song in Final Fantasy VII and blah, blah, blah.
10135870	10136691	Here's the thing.
10137052	10144981	You need to get the majority to agree with you and to be able to get something recognized on that platform.
10145201	10147343	And, you know, yeah, Aerith's theme...
10148491	10163952	was created on a synth and everything but the More Friends CD version, I know the concert sucked, but that CD version if you play that for somebody who doesn't know it's from a video game, they will think it's one of the most beautiful classical pieces they've heard in a long time.
10165109	10169152	and that's really the testament to that piece.
10169812	10175256	And yes, if somebody doesn't know it's from a video game, they will think it is a classical piece.
10175856	10176317	I agree.
10176357	10179959	You've got to rally the troops behind one thing or it's not going to work.
10179979	10181520	You're going to divide it all up.
10181600	10184262	So, you know, I think they just kind of had to say, you know what?
10184963	10189626	This is the song that had a huge moment that was notable in gaming.
10189646	10190366	We're going to go here.
10190426	10192508	You know, I can see that despite...
10192828	10197190	How, you know, whatever song from Final Fantasy 7 or even Final Fantasy 6 may be your favorite.
10197210	10204534	Like, if it were me picking a Final Fantasy song, I think Terra's theme from Final Fantasy 6 is like the greatest Final Fantasy song there ever was.
10204554	10206415	I think the marching version of that is the best.
10206795	10207056	Love it.
10207636	10210597	Well, I actually did a little more digging on this.
10210637	10213979	And actually, the Aerith theme that's in Final Fantasy 7 is not eligible.
10214700	10216000	Oh, no.
10216060	10216781	Why is that?
10217161	10217701	Here's why.
10217841	10219222	Because it was made for a synth.
10221272	10245786	but you can nominate one of the later versions so you know basically what they're nominating is that it was rearranged for an orchestra that is also applicable but also that Facebook fan page is not just concentrating on Aerith's scene that was the first one they actually like every week they're putting up a new classical piece from video games that you can also put in like Dragonborn from Skyrim
10246306	10248948	is currently also, they're trying to get people to vote for that.
10248988	10250429	They just want something in there.
10251089	10256413	Earth's Theme is just the one that's going to be the most popular, that most people are going to go into.
10256994	10264159	But they've got several suggestions of pieces that do fit the criteria that Classic FM has set.
10264819	10271384	They actually do have rules, and the original PlayStation 1 version of Earth's Theme does not count.
10271724	10272145	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10287100	10306557	and they actually that was one of the other ones that they had suggested on that same Facebook page the story that Tommy T tells about that and I think he told on your show and ours about how Disney didn't want to give the rights to the visuals but then they heard it and you know not a dry eye in the house that's a powerful piece of music it really is
10307847	10312210	Yeah, so I mean, that's the thing is that, you know, classical music is not just an era.
10312290	10315373	People hear the term classical and think, oh, it's just Bach.
10315553	10317755	It's just, you know, it's just Mozart.
10319416	10319676	All right.
10321157	10326682	Bobby, before we let you go, we can't keep this going all night because we probably could.
10327002	10329404	But before we let you go, I got to put you on the spot too.
10329504	10332266	What is your favorite video game music of all time or at least one of them?
10334983	10337444	I should have thought about this before I called in, shouldn't I?
10337464	10340126	You might not have heard us ask Actdeft this.
10340286	10342787	Yeah, I was trying to speed dial in.
10342907	10345128	That's alright, because we asked him too.
10345268	10347409	What was one of your favorites?
10348149	10348610	You know what?
10349250	10354753	It's going to sound, because we've been talking about it, because I've kind of... The reason I'm kind of...
10355745	10361868	Prepping this up is because one of the 21st Century Orchestra is what we call ourselves because we don't like the term new age.
10362348	10366391	We've been kicking around a video game concert idea because we used to do movie stuff.
10367251	10378157	And we've been kicking around doing video game stuff and they've put me in charge of kind of putting in what we would do in this hypothetical concert that's actually probably not going to happen for years now.
10379560	10387465	and actually the piece that would be the most emotional and the most gratifying to play and to be a part of is actually Aerith's theme.
10389020	10396342	and specifically the More Friends version from the CD that's the fully orchestral and everything.
10397563	10400284	That's actually the first time I shed a tear in a video game.
10400844	10401164	Me too.
10402264	10413608	And so it's very powerful from that aspect and the way it would be phrased in the concert is because I know that Square Enix doesn't let people use their footage in concerts that aren't their own.
10413648	10414688	I know all about that.
10415228	10417849	So it would be kind of phrased around can a video game make you cry?
10419472	10425115	and basically, you know, we'd be showing like fan art and stuff of Eris and of that scene with that piece.
10425155	10429378	And that was going to be kind of the emotional high point of this theoretical concert.
10429878	10434121	So I'm really going to go with Eris theme just because of what it means.
10434481	10438764	I don't blame you one bit just because there's a reason why it's newsworthy right now.
10439984	10440525	Absolutely.
10441085	10441305	All right.
10441345	10444487	Well, Bobby, quick, plug your stuff before we let you go.
10446148	10448449	Contrary to popular belief, I do not hate Actdeft.
10449410	10455793	So if you want to listen to somebody who does not actually hate Actdeft, I'm on before you guys at 8pm Eastern, 5pm Pacific.
10455813	10457434	You're on All Games Radio.
10457454	10461977	The last 10 minutes of my show were actually me fucking around with OLR.
10462297	10464759	Oh, you can say the F word on our show.
10466400	10467220	You get to swear.
10467260	10469041	It's the side of Bobby you don't normally get to see.
10470022	10471763	I'm sorry I said bitch on your show.
10471783	10473284	That's okay.
10474042	10474463	It's okay.
10474863	10476725	You will get the podcast up again soon, right, Bobby?
10477186	10477686	I hope so, yeah.
10477706	10478067	We miss him.
10478267	10478527	All right.
10478968	10479208	All right.
10479509	10480590	Bobby Blackwolf, everybody.
10480630	10481551	Thank you so much for calling in.
10481892	10482392	Have a good one.
10482833	10483634	Capcom fires you.
10484995	10485696	You're fired too.
10485756	10486617	No, hire.
10486818	10487578	Hire.
10488680	10489521	Need to hire.
10490376	10490876	Get fired.
10491317	10491637	All right.
10492017	10492358	Anyhow.
10493018	10493218	All right.
10493259	10493859	We got to wrap it up.
10493999	10499184	I know there's some folks that wanted to call and get through, but guys, we have an important live thing happening tonight.
10499204	10500705	We got to get to before it's like one in the morning.
10501145	10502927	So I got to close up the Skype line.
10502967	10505269	If you didn't get through, tweet us, email us.
10506009	10507571	yell at us in all caps and chat.
10507631	10508131	No, don't do that.
10508431	10510233	But you know ways to get in touch with us.
10510293	10510693	Please do.
10510733	10513376	We want to know your thoughts and we'll share them next week on the show.
10514296	10515898	In the meantime, we've got to wrap things up.
10515978	10518260	Quickly, one more tweet here from Tiger Claw.
10518300	10519421	Quickly, quickly read this.
10520342	10526127	Robata Vengeance pits robots against genetically modified dinosaurs.
10528519	10532201	It was actually created by an Academy Award winner, Doug Chang.
10532902	10535543	He was the lead designer on Star Wars Episode I and II.
10535603	10540086	We'll say what you will about those movies, but at least the special effects were really good for their time.
10540767	10544749	They want to do it as an iOS game that's a full-scale rival to Infinity Blade.
10545309	10545550	Hmm.
10546270	10547571	I guess, oh, here's the deal.
10547611	10547931	Here it is.
10548071	10549112	It's another Kickstarter.
10549332	10550293	They're trying to raise $100,000 to get Robota.
10550313	10550433	Oh, boy.
10550493	10550593	Okay.
10554540	10555841	See, what did I say last week?
10555941	10557423	Pandora's box has been opened.
10558624	10559505	This is going to be interesting.
10560245	10561707	But I will say, it does sound pretty cool.
10562167	10568593	Pre-order your game now by securing your vested share in the development of this game.
10568833	10570034	That's how it's going to be.
10570635	10578202	Alright, that's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio, but we could not end the show if we don't go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10579266	10580647	DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
10580667	10581207	Your final thought tonight.
10581327	10582448	I'm going to read a quote from Buddha.
10583048	10583329	Please do.
10583889	10590773	Believe nothing no matter where you read it or who has said it, not even if I have said it, unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense.
10593834	10594334	How deep.
10595255	10596115	Loki, your final thought.
10596275	10597036	I hate MySpace.
10598517	10599937	But they got a million new users.
10599997	10600678	It's noteworthy again.
10602173	10611076	Dude, I went back to my page because I was looking through some of the songs I had uploaded there, and you can't download them anymore, even though I had it before where you could download them for free.
10611256	10613216	Because they don't want to give anything away for free.
10613236	10615377	You can share it on your blogs and bullshit like that.
10615917	10621599	And then it pulls up like, hey, I know you wanted to listen to your music, but how about some shit from somebody else?
10622299	10622499	No.
10623159	10625079	You're not fucking Pandora.
10626120	10627380	Although maybe you are Pandora.
10628260	10630301	Hey, they got to bite off somebody who's making money.
10630714	10640924	Alright, and my final thought of the day, everybody, is... Do-do-do-do.
10640944	10642726	Do-do-do-do.
10642786	10643967	Do-do-do-do.
10644367	10646389	Listen to O-L-R.
10646810	10649292	It's on right after Bobby.
10653149	10658392	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend about the show.
10658472	10660393	Word of mouth is how we get the word out.
10660433	10664055	We don't have a million dollar magazine behind us or website or any of that stuff.
10664115	10665015	It's all about word of mouth.
10665355	10666796	Help the OL Army grow.
10667096	10668497	Play Terraria with each other.
10668857	10669777	Don't be a dick.
10670058	10671058	We'll see you next week.
10671298	10672959	Have a wonderful, wonderful night.
10676881	10677321	See you next week!
10705144	10706514	Thanks for watching!
