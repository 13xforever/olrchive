Tonight, February 26, 2012, Sony pulls an app from the Vita just days after release, Pokemon has new sequels announced, and big companies team up for a portable console game collaboration.
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
We are live right now, Sunday, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
It is February 26th, episode 447.
I'll be joining you over the next few hours.
My name is Rob Roberts with my co-hosts.
Say hello to Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers.
Hi.
How are you?
All right.
You all right?
Just all right?
Yeah, it's been trying.
But you had salad.
Salad makes it all better.
I did, but I just put balsamic vinegar in, not the kind of dressing I wanted.
All right.
So it didn't turn out all that great, and I'm feeling kind of sick now.
Aw.
Well, I hope the show can cheer you up.
We're going to have a fun few hours tonight talking about video games and stuff with, of course, our other co-hosts.
Say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
Hello.
How are you, Loki?
I'm fine.
All right, starting it off tonight, a popular game we like to play for the show is, what did Loki bring to dinner tonight?
So, Loki, what did you bring to dinner for the show tonight?
I brought Taco Bell, but I actually wasn't that hungry.
I didn't finish it.
Now, and I asked you this before the show, did you try to win another PlayStation Vita at Taco Bell?
What made you decide to go to Taco Bell?
You know, it's funny, because I actually really hate Taco Bell, or at least I used to really hate Taco Bell, and so I just started eating Taco Bell, because I guess I'm less picky on what I'm eating now, so...
I got the steak quesadilla, which is hardly steak, but it's a quesadilla.
All right, look, I don't need the entire play-by-play.
And two crunchy tacos.
The reason why I'm kind of bringing this up is because I remember just before the show, I was reading about the Taco Bell is in a lot of trouble over this Vita promotion.
What is this?
A bunch of people got an email that said they won.
You just won a freaking PlayStation Vita!
Thank you for watching!
DarkSakura.com
So, okay.
So the company that's marketing this for Taco Bell is terrible, apparently.
Fired?
Well, yeah, among other things.
Well, now there's room.
They have a whole Facebook page.
I was reading through that because, you know, I love drama.
So I was reading through their Facebook page and all these, you know, very angry people, which, you know, I can imagine, especially.
I mean, I understand someone may have gamed the game, but I think...
I think there legitimately is probably a lot of people that did actually win that are getting screwed by this.
I don't know, but I didn't do all my research because this literally came up before the show.
They had something else on the local news that was like one of those call Curtis or something like that.
Oh yeah, investigative reports, consumer watchdog.
Yeah, something like that.
They were checking stuff out.
I think, honestly, for anybody that got that page, it says upon verification.
Now, if you have the winning code, I mean, how...
Unless, I mean, unless they actually come out, okay, here's a list of code numbers that were winning codes, you know, which that's not going to come out unless, you know, there's some investigation stuff done during the whole court process.
But, you know, how are you going to be able to prove that you have a winning code?
You can't.
I mean, because it's up to Taco Bell to say, no, no, you didn't.
Yeah, I know you saw that, but it was upon verification, and we verified your code is not a winning code.
But apparently also, I guess the website shows who's won each time there's a winner, and it hasn't updated for a long time.
Well, now because the thing's broken, who knows?
I don't know.
It's all messed up.
It's going to be interesting to see the legal things that come out of this or what the promotion company behind this whole thing is going to have to do.
We'll see.
If anything, they'll probably try to sweep it under the rug, but we'll see.
All right.
Anyhow, I want to give a shout out to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com where folks talk live with us as we do tape, of course, every Sunday night.
chat.orangeloungeradio.com I'll let acidic vampire start us off tonight.
And chat says, hello, people.
Fuck the Oscars.
Because yes, it is Sunday.
And inevitably, there's always freaking something on TV on Sundays, whether it be the Grammys or the Tonys.
And tonight it's the Oscars, which is kind of a big deal for some people.
We need the buddies.
The buddies?
Yeah.
Yeah, we have the, you know, just like a complete, this is what we think of your award show.
Next year we need to have the Schmoskers where we do some type of, you know, video game related Oscar thing on the show, but that would require planning.
Let me think.
Justin Bieber?
No, not Justin Bieber.
Twilight was nominated for Worst Picture, but Adam Sandler got nominated for like three different movies.
And that Jack and Jill, he's nominated for Worst Picture.
That's a winner right there.
There you go.
That is a winner.
That's a winning loser right there.
It's the biggest loser.
And hey, I'm going to go out on a limb here and predict another possible winning.
Well, it's definitely going to be a winner coming soon from Adam Sandler as well.
Candyland.
Candyland.
Oh god, is that the whole, like Battleship and all these board games, apparently Clue's gonna get another movie Hasbro, yeah He's doing Candyland?
Oh, that's kind of disturbing, like, ah, I need bleach Alright, look, we need to move on, games So, before we get into our gaming week, so I guess this might be a little bit about gaming weeks But Vita, okay, everybody's got Vita fever this week because the system officially launched Vita
So we had a lot of people talking about it last week with the pre-launch, whatever.
Now the system officially launched this week.
I got my hot little hands on Evita, and I think a lot of you out there did.
I realize there are some other people that are like, no one care, because, you know, there's always got to be the haters.
And then there's, of course, a lot of other people that I think this is where a lot of people fit into is like, I'll probably get one when the price comes down or when XYZ game comes out.
Speaking of the price coming down, let me start off with this.
You...
We're pretty angry on Twitter this week at a story about the price coming down.
This whole games analysts are analyzing the system two days after it launches.
What was this all about?
Well, they were like going, oh, it's not selling well, or like, oh, it hasn't sold that many copies.
I don't even know where they're getting data yet.
I don't even think they have data.
Now, obviously, they were looking at Japan, but that doesn't mean anything.
I mean, that...
If we're basing our information off of what goes on in Japan, then the Xbox 360 is doomed because it just doesn't sell well in Japan.
But yeah, they're already saying, oh, the price drop needs to happen now.
It's like, dude, it just came out.
How are you coming to this conclusion of what sales are yet?
I mean, it just came out.
You're going to get day one sales and that's it.
I mean, look at the 3DS.
If you were going to look at the 3DS, you know, day one sales or whatever, I'm sure they were terrible.
Well, it also seems like the Vita, you know, I'm really trying to be impartial here and not sound like a Sony fanboy, but I got to be honest, the Vita seems to have a better launch projection over the next few months than the 3DS had.
It seems like they've got some big titles evenly spaced out to keep it interesting.
Like what, Little Big Planets next month?
That's going to be a big deal.
Yeah, Little Big Planets next...
Resistance in a few months.
I have problems.
The Namcom game comes out this coming month.
I mean, the Vita's got a lot of stuff coming for it, whereas the 3DS was hurting.
I mean, there was really... I mean, their biggest launch title was what?
The Street Fighter 4 that was already... Sadly, Ridge Racer is pretty good.
Um...
It was actually... I would think it was a pretty good 3DS game.
No, it was.
It was just funny the way you phrased that.
Sadly, Ridge Racer... Well, I mean, Ridge Racer, to be honest, it doesn't change.
I mean, it hasn't changed in a long time.
So, yeah, I mean, they've got a lot of...
The Vita titles, I mean, there was like a good 30 Vita titles at launch.
That's a lot.
I mean, and there's still... And there's some crap, but there's some, like, little deviants.
Well, yeah.
But there's some really good stuff, too.
You know, like one game I want to talk about, Luminous.
Which is hotness.
Let me put it this way.
I am a huge whore for all things Q Entertainment, and I've been that way on this show for a long, long time.
Luminous, Meteos, Gunpei, Every Extend, all their games.
I freaking defended 99 Nights on this show.
It's not that bad.
It's not that bad.
Did you get the sequel?
I don't want to talk about that alright but Luminous like I bought the original Luminous I bought Luminous 2 I bought Luminous on Xbox I bought Luminous on Steam so yes of course I bought this new Luminous game and I'll tell you what it really is the best freaking one yet and I'm amazed to say that because I will say Luminous has had its weak points I don't think that Xbox Live version of Luminous was very good
and DarkSakura.
But anyway, don't get me excited, Loki.
But no, this Luminous game is so good.
It is this generation's Tetris.
It is that freaking good.
But again, I'm fully admitting, I have been in love with almost everything.
and Tetsuya Mizuguchi's ever done.
You know, all the way back to like Space Channel 5 and all that.
So, you know, of course there's this built-in love for this game but it's really hot on the Vita.
It shows off a lot of the functionality without being ridiculous.
Like you can use the back touchpad but you don't have to.
You can use touch controls but you don't have to.
You know, there's a lot of good stuff to it.
And I like the way it ties into the internet with the big block.
Although there's some serious balancing issues with the XP but whatever.
And the song list is so...
Good.
It is so good.
Like I know Loki and I had a talk on Bobby's show about this.
Yeah, I know he doesn't agree with me totally, but I think the song list is because it's recognizable enough without them having to have shilled out all this money for AAA licenses like they did with Luminous 2.
Because like Luminous 2 had Missy Elliott and Beck and Gwen Stefani, which some of it seemed really oddly out of place.
But this song is that perfect match of, oh, hey, this is a song by Faithless.
I think I heard them before.
Oh,
Goldfrapp!
They're pretty cool.
Here's a song.
There's just enough.
And it's not usually their biggest hit.
That's the other thing I'm noticing.
There's a Benny Benassi song in it, but it's not Satisfaction.
There's a Beloved song in it, but it's not Sweet Harmony.
It's a really neat way they kind of came up with that song list.
And the skins are gorgeous.
The original tracks they've mixed in are good too.
Love, love, love, love.
It's an early contender for my game of the year, honestly and truly.
But again...
I knew I was going to like this game.
Is it your game of February?
It is totally my game of February.
Absolutely.
Well, I played yours.
Yes.
And my review for the Vita is Owl My Hand because of how high up the buttons are on the right side because, again, I had hand surgery.
It's holding my hand in that position actually kind of hurt.
I tried using the touchscreen for Luminous which was actually a little hard.
But...
Luminous was awesome when I plugged in my heavy duty podcasting headphones.
I gotta try that at some point.
Sounds awesome.
Let's see.
Let's go to another question here from Frisbee.
Is the Vita worth the money?
That's an excellent question that I don't think I can answer with a definitive yes or no.
For me, yes.
I like to be on the cutting edge of this type of technology.
Now, my Vita experience has not been without problems.
The Katamari game, which is the other game I picked up at launch besides Luminous, froze my system the other night.
I'm talking it so bad where it would not wake up out of sleep mode.
I tried to hold down the power button.
Here's a tip if you get into this problem.
Put it into a coma?
Yeah, it did.
If you hold down, I mean, the Katamari broke it or rolled it up.
I don't know.
But you hold down the power button for about 10 seconds and you'll get a menu kind of akin to what happens when you hold down one of the function keys when you start Windows where you can do like a hard reset of the Vita.
You can reset all your settings.
I tried to do a hard reset.
Nothing happened.
I ended up erasing all my settings.
Nothing happened.
And I'm like, holy shit, I have a Vita that I'm using to play a lot of Luminous break after 24 hours.
But finally, I just ejected the cartridge of Katamari, woke right up.
and I had to reset everything and I was so mad that I'd done that so if your Vita will not wake up eject the cartridge first thing you'd think it's basic troubleshooting 101 so in other words my point is the Vita is not without its problems especially for this early adoption but what have we said for years and years and years on this program is the golden rule of gaming DarkSakura please remind the listeners a system is only as good as the games that are on it thank you trademark
If there is a game on the Vita or several games on the Vita that you have to have right now, yes, get one.
If you're a big luminous whore like me, you're not going to be disappointed.
If you want to get this new Katamari game, Uncharted.
It's not a Naughty Dog Uncharted, but I'm hearing it's okay except for the fact that they've really shoved all the touch stuff into it.
If you want Marvel vs. Capcom 3 on the go, you can't get that on the 3DS right now.
Then yeah, there might be something here worth your money.
But if you don't think there's something in it for you right now, don't spend the money.
It's really hard to kind of put a price tag on that.
I bought a 3DS when they were still $249.
I don't regret that decision.
But it was kind of a weak launch lineup.
Honestly, I like the Vita, but I have the games that I want on my phone, and I'm really wanting an iPad later.
Because you know what I can do with an iPad?
IK'd.
Let me go to SSJ100 Matt in our chat room.
Is the 3G version really worth it?
I'll say this.
I bought a 3G Vita, and I'm going to answer that with a no.
I kind of think I shouldn't have done that.
And I know some of you tried to call me out on it last week, and I will admit after getting my hands on it and using it, it was a mistake.
And I kind of think they... I would say...
They really pushed it with advertising that Super Stardust Delta or whatever is an included game.
Because it's kind of BS.
The hurdles you have to jump around to get that.
And that's part of the reason I just went for the 3G.
Because I'm like, with all this value, what?
I'm paying $10 for 3G?
Okay, I might use that someday.
I'll go ahead and buy it.
I'm having a little bit of buyer's remorse on that.
However, this is very important.
I have an iPhone.
If I didn't have the iPhone...
Thank you for watching!
But if you already have a 3G device that you're paying for, the games don't play over 3G.
The 3G is for stuff like Nier.
It's for downloading patches.
That's it.
Don't expect to play head-to-head over 3G.
It would be kind of a bad experience anyway.
Yes, 3G is a lot slower than most people realize.
Yeah, I don't think I would ever use the 3G service that much, but here's the way I look at it.
The 3G one, you can make a memory card with it.
Sure, yeah, you could buy that separately and you may save some money, but at the same time, it's nice to have the option that if later on you wanted to use 3G...
or if you are paying for 3G say for example for an iPad you can literally pop that SIM card out of your iPad pop it into your Vita and oh look it works!
and DarkSakura.
I can turn on my PlayStation 3 when I'm lying in my bed with the Vita I can turn on the PlayStation 3 go in there I can play the PS1 games because right now you can't download a PS1 game to your Vita you can't like they don't have that functionality in there yet I'm assuming they're going to add it
But what you can do is if the games are on your PlayStation 3, you fire up Remote Play and you can stream it.
And it's like what they're advertising on the Wii U. You're getting the little game in there.
Now, granted, I have several games.
And I don't think Um Jamma Lammy would be a great idea to play over Remote Play because music game, lag, death, right?
But Final Fantasy V or something that the lag isn't going to be a big deal is great.
and I love the fact and one of the things I was hoping that they would do and they actually did was mapping the extra buttons and before with the PlayStation Portable you had your L2, R2 and stuff mapped to one of the analogs which is really dumb and they have it still where you can do that where you can hold select and then push a directional button or something like that and it does one of those or you can actually map it to your back touchpad which is fantastic.
L2R2, L3R3
with a $200 PlayStation 3 and what is right now a $250 Vita.
That's $450 for this technology.
And I got to say, this Vita, probably a lot better than that tablet controller that Wii U is coming with.
So there is no possible way, there is no possible, possible way that Wii U can get away with charging $450.
And I would argue there is no way that Wii U can get away with charging $400.
and in fact I think the bar needs to go even lower and if they try to blame the technology absolute utter total bullshit we're looking at it right now with the Vita and the PlayStation 3 the Nintendo if they want to win with the Wii U they've got to be able to deliver this technology cheaper and they've got to integrate it a little bit better because right now there is no you know besides what I just mentioned there's not a whole lot to do with remote play
But then again, it just came out a couple days ago.
That's true, and Sony is very good at adding features.
And I gotta say, they saved the PS3 through some of that.
What can I say?
Out of the box, I have a web browser.
I didn't have to wait months for a patch to unlock the web browser function, which that web browser was terrible in the 3DS.
But we have to be fair, and the Vita is missing some things it should have.
Like the whole fact that it doesn't play PS1 games right now when the PSP did it, that's a little like, what?
What?
I mean, you can do it through remote play, but it's a little weird that that's not there.
They probably haven't built a new emulator for it, and they could probably do it emulating the PSP, emulating the PlayStation 1, which would be weird.
But they probably want to see if they can improve upon it, make it, you know, hey, look, the graphics look nicer or something like that.
Mm-hmm.
So anyhow, I'll talk a little more about Vita games when we get to my gaming week.
I want to go around.
We always start off the show with how was your gaming week?
I guess we've kind of already been doing that, but maybe there's stuff not on the Vita.
We'll start with DarkSakura.
Well, I played well.
Addict.
Dealer.
And I made a new friend, so I'd like to give a shout out to Renee, who I asked to listen tonight.
Hi Renee!
Hi!
I was going to play some Portal 2.
I played a lot of being pissed off.
So this is the problem I had.
You know how you have 50 million channels and nothing's on?
I was looking at the collection.
We had some Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, which mostly was Dan playing and screaming at the TV, because Galactus, even on Super Easy, is a cheap bitch.
But I was looking at the games, and I was like, I don't want to play this.
I don't want to play this.
I don't want to play this.
I don't want to play this.
Where is Blue Dragon?
And I could not find Blue Dragon, and I was mad, and I wanted to... Do you want to borrow mine?
I have the game.
Okay.
So then I was like...
So then I was like, I'm going to play BlazBlue.
What?
It's not open?
Crap.
Because I don't like to open things that aren't already open.
So then I was like, I'm going to play Jumping Flash.
And I could not find Jumping Flash, even though it was probably right in front of me.
So I was like, I'm just not going to play anything.
And I took a nap.
I'm just surprised that you couldn't see those old PlayStation 1 cases.
They were the size of a small house.
We have them in the back room, and keep in mind, we have the cases that size also encompass our Sega Saturn collection, encompass the Sega CD collection, and we have a bunch of early PS1 games.
Thanks for watching!
Yeah, I was like, I don't want to open this.
It is pretty tough.
And it's going to get staticky and stick to my hand.
And I was like, I don't want to.
That is the ultimate laziest thing I've ever heard in my entire life.
Congratulations.
You know, I finally opened my copy of... Because it ended with, and then I took a nap.
The shrink wrap monster proved too difficult that I went to go take a nap.
I'm just calling it like I see it.
You know I love you, but damn lazy.
I was tired anyway so bite me but um oh god what else was it that I was it was like I wanted to play certain things and I couldn't find them and I was frustrated so then I was gonna play Project Diva no no no no there's more cause remember I was loaned by one of our lovely listeners um Project Diva oh right right right and I could not find our PSP charger I tore up everything and Dan's like oh it's in the bin actually I think it's at my mom's house
and DarkSakura.com.
Oh, like the old... Yeah, some puzzle game.
I also did play Castlevania the Puzzle.
Freaking sucks on the iPhone.
You cannot... It's like, oh, we're going to show both of the screens at the same time.
No, it doesn't work because you have to move it with your fingers and the little blocks are too small and then, oh, sorry, you're just going to drop the ball.
You know the only good thing about that?
The music.
That's it.
And, you know, Dracula being a pimp.
Techness in our chatroom at chat.orange.com says about your story.
Sounds like a great first world problem, man.
You know, I would like to see an FU comic on Jamie's story.
Shrink wrap.
FU.
Actually, you know how my brain translates that?
What?
I hear it phonetically.
That's how my brain translates that.
You sound like a scary monster.
Don't do that.
Loki, how was your gaming week?
I played some of the Vita stuff, basically.
Call of Duty, more of that.
We got a sixth person in on our games now, so it's more than merry.
I played more Luminous.
Although, see, during the week, I've...
there was more rumors that some of those demos might have been full games so i had to clear some space off um and i accidentally well i deleted my you know how i install some like some stuff for like each game that you pop in there so you have little icons i deleted one of those apparently that also deletes your save for luminous or whatever so i deleted my save for luminous apparently that's because it said oh hey you started playing luminous for the first time like no i haven't i played it before um
If you clear your system settings, the same thing happens where it's all, you just played Luminous for the first time.
Liar!
Even before that, though, I had some weird stuff where it wouldn't get any XP for the stuff that I did, so that was a little funky.
And then, let's see, play more Rayman Origins, which is pretty fun.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Beat, Touch My Katamari, or at least I finished the last level in the game.
I kind of don't want to buy any more Katamari games anymore because it's kind of disappointing because they're never as good as the first few games.
They're whipping that same horse over and over and over again.
Seriously, the last level...
Thanks for watching!
and then I unlocked some of the Eternal stages for those which you get candy for that stuff too so I don't know why you wouldn't do the Eternal stages so I did those and I bought the King of Cosmos some new clothes because he wanted some really flamboyant stuff and
So I made him even more flamboyant, if that's possible.
Yeah, my favorite is that the first thing he asked me for was a bridal cape.
Yes, that's the one I got for him, the bridal cape.
I'm like, okay, everybody has their thing.
I'm not one to judge.
Exactly, it was just really weird.
So I did that, and then...
What else did they play?
I didn't play Little Defiance yet because I really don't want to play that game.
It looks like crap.
I actually played some of the Welcome Park stuff and tried to unlock trophies in that.
Some of those games are actually kind of hard.
The Welcome Park stuff for built-in games is, you know, it's all right.
I've got to ask you, did you try some of those AR games?
I did, and I don't like them
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and I'm not that far away from this stuff I mean I'm maybe like three feet away from the actual cards which I think is pretty reasonable but it just wasn't working and then the fireworks one was kind of neat but the game's kind of dumb and once again I was getting the out of range error even though I could see all the cards through the
you know, the screen, so I don't know what the issue was there, but I mean, I'm sure it's just some bugs that'll get worked out.
And the games are free, so whatever.
But, um...
What else?
Oh, I tried the Unit 13 demo.
That was actually pretty good.
I like that.
Not my type of game, really.
I'm not really huge into the SOCOM.
What is it?
It's like SOCOM.
It's done by the guys at Zipper Interactive.
It's a third-person squad shooter game.
Sure.
And it's okay.
Those tend to sell pretty well.
Yeah, it's all right, but it's not my... I'm not really into that.
Resistance, no, the new Resistance game, I'm definitely going to be picking up probably, but this one was not too big for me.
Gripper01 in our chatroom says the Vita needs a decent pinball game.
Good call.
I don't see why there won't be a pinball FX on it soon enough.
That actually reminds me.
I forgot to mention we sold Lord of the Rings.
Oh.
Bye, Lord of the Rings.
Yep.
Just saying.
The precious is gone.
Thank God.
I mean, I'm tired of that game.
Did you take it to Mount Mordor?
No.
Sauron came and picked it up.
He was really nice, too.
Very personable guy.
One does not simply multi-ball into Mount Mordor.
I will say this, if they do put out Pinball FX on the Vita, I think that would be a great game for the rear touchpad to use the flippers and you could turn it so it's a long screen instead of the wide screen I mean, you know, those guys that designed Pinball FX they've already done games on wide screen televisions and they work fine but imagine with the Vita, you could turn it the other way and that would be a pretty kick-butt screen and there were some import shooters from Japan that
We're using the long screen for the PSP back in the day, so I'd be down for that.
I really do feel like there's more potential to be unlocked with the Vita, but to be fair, the 3DS has done a pretty good job of unlocking more as we go, too.
So it's on now.
So there you go.
What else for your gaming week?
Anything?
That was it.
All right.
Well, Loki already mentioned Touch My Katamari, which was another... One thing, real quick.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
Real quick.
Just one thing I just wanted to mention that was absent from my gaming week, and that was the new download content for Saints Row III because I am not buying into this bullshit download content crap that they're putting out these really terrible pieces of... Ooh, what happened?
Not good?
Well, the last one they put out was really short, and it was $7 for about an hour's worth of content.
And it was just kind of like cheap bullshit.
So I waited.
I waited to hear the reviews on it, and sure enough, someone's like, oh yeah, I beat it in 30 minutes.
$7 still.
Fuck that.
Nope, not doing it.
That's too bad.
Saints Row had a lot going for it when it first came out.
They kind of ruined it.
That's too bad.
All right.
My Game of the Week.
I also play Touch My Katamari.
I feel similarly to where Loki's at, you know, like, oh, yeah, I like Katamari.
It's a good game, but it's been kind of the same damn game.
It's kind of like Sonic the Hedgehog coming out on every platform.
You're like, oh, it's Sonic.
I used to love this game and I'm playing it again.
And again, I'm playing the same game again and nothing's changed.
And now the nostalgia is worn off and I think I'm done now.
I also played Sonic the Hedgehog on PlayStation 3 this week, for real.
It was one of the free PlayStation Plus games.
PlayStation Plus is having this whole Genesis nostalgia fest thing going on, so whatever.
Which is weird, because yes, I have the Sonic Mega Genesis collection, so you might be thinking, why are you wasting the space on your hard drive to download it?
And my answer is...
Trophies.
I must have trophies.
So I tried to unlock some trophies.
And one game I will say I unlocked a shit ton of trophies in is Altered Beast, which I also played this week.
Rise from your grave.
If there isn't a game that we have seen through thicker rose-colored glasses in our lives, it's Altered Beast.
Because I'll tell you what, I remember being a kid thinking that game was badass.
And it was in the arcade.
for 25 cents for a few minute thrill.
But what they decided to port over on the PlayStation 3, which granted is the exact same thing they have on Xbox Live Arcade, was the Genesis version, which at the time was great, but...
Now it looks a lot like Pac-Man on the Atari 2600.
I mean, it's bad.
It's a bad game.
And some of the horrible noises it was making made me think my PlayStation 3 was about to spontaneously combust.
And I ask you, have any of you actually played Altered Beast to Stage 5 all the way to the last stage of the game?
Yes.
What in the fuck are those unicorn tranny monsters?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Look, I'm just... Before you send in the hate mail and say... No, no, no, no.
I'm finding pictures of them for everybody.
I'm telling you, these unicorn monsters are a little funky.
Like, it's just, what is this?
Who designed this?
I can't even.
So, yeah, I played Altered Beast all the way to the end, got my trophy, then promptly deleted it from my hard drive because, damn, that's a bad game.
Um...
Otherwise, more WoW, more Final Fantasy XIII Tube and trying to get a little further in that.
And that's about the extent of my week.
I mean, I did have the Vita.
I literally played Luminous like nothing but Luminous one night.
I thought Stage 5 was the Rhino monsters.
Is there a stage missing in the Genesis version?
It's the Hell level.
And you turn into the exact same monster you were in Level 1.
So...
TigerClaw in our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com says, Altered Beast is in need of a serious reboot.
I'd be down with that.
A serious reboot, yes.
I mean, there's some pretty cool concepts in Altered Beast.
But those levels became laughably easy once you became the beast.
It's just kind of getting there can be a pain in the ass sometimes.
So, all right.
Anyhow.
That's it for my gaming week, so let's talk about housekeeping.
Join us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, or you can join us on Twitter as well, twitter.com slash OLR.
Get in your tweets for tonight's show.
As far as I can tell, we don't have any shows off planned in the next few weeks, so OLR every Sunday for a little while.
Let's get into some gaming news and what is going on in the gaming world this week.
Loki's going to start it off.
Yes, so let's start off by talking about one of the... What was it?
What project did they call that?
It was...
No, not Downpour.
That whole campaign to get those really awesome... Operation Rainfall.
That's right.
I was thinking Downpour.
Project Downpour.
Downpour would be the new Silent Hill title.
Yes, Operation Rainfall.
So, the last story has been confirmed to be coming to North America in 2012.
Well, summer 2012.
Well, June 19th, 2012.
Um...
And it's actually, it's kind of cool.
It's not going to be one of those, oh, you have to buy the GameStop order directly from Nintendo.
It's actually being ported over by Exceed, which is probably going to have the easiest localization job ever because it's going to be going from English to English.
So that's just money handed right to them, basically.
So yeah, that'll be coming out later this year and is a pretty epic RPG for Mistwalker.
We have a date for that?
Well, they're saying summer 2012.
What I've seen from XSEED is June 19th, 2012.
That would be summer.
That would be summer.
And just in time for my birthday.
Yay.
So, I mean, dates can change.
But June 19th.
Downpour, by the way, was a Silent Hill game.
I think you got confused there.
No, I said Downpour is the next Silent Hill game that's coming out.
Just looking at the chat room.
Alan Wake, Silent Hill-ish game.
Exactly.
Alan Hill.
I found the picture, by the way.
Let me see this.
Hold on.
We'll come back to that.
Yes, what are those things?
Explain it to me.
I have no idea.
They're trinicorns.
Get that on the Tumblr so the podcast listeners can refer to this.
I'll give it to Ranma to do it.
Thank you.
Because I want the podcast-y listeners to be able to see this too if they're not live.
Anyhow, where were we?
Vita, Silent Hill.
I didn't know there was an exclusive Silent Hill game on the Vita.
Yeah, Book of Memories.
Really?
DarkSakura.com
I don't have the money to buy all these games.
Maybe you'll have a demo.
There you go.
That'll be fair.
I wanted to say though about the last story.
A,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Freaking nine months to play it.
I love how it's got almost the same font as Final Fantasy.
And it's the last story.
The Final Fantasy.
I mean, come on.
I didn't even think about a title.
The last story.
Yeah, it sounds good.
It kind of reminds me of another game series.
I can't really think of what it is.
If the game is that good, I don't even care.
I don't even care.
They could have called it Dino Dynasty and I'd still play it.
For the record, they're called Dark Unicorns.
But this website refers to them as the Ninja Corn.
Dark and fierce.
The Ninja Corn.
I prefer calling them the Tranny Corn.
Alright, anyhow.
So yeah, I'm looking forward to that.
Interesting that Nintendo's not bringing it out themselves.
This is, you know, with Xenoblade, Nintendo's doing it themselves.
So this is where XSEED is doing it.
And they did what?
They did like Half Minute Hero.
They've been a few...
They've done some pretty good RPGs and stuff.
So I'm glad it's in their hands because what makes me really happy, and I was getting into this on Twitter with somebody, it makes me really happy that XSEED is doing it because this means no stupid retail exclusive agreements like we see happening with Xenoblade.
And I have faith it'll go pretty well.
It really does give me a reason to dust off my Nintendo Wii and check it out.
Especially since you're going to have Xenoblade and then two months later you're going to have...
The last story.
So I'm looking forward to that.
Sergeant Stubby in our chat room, I love that name, wants to know where is the OLR Tumblr?
Where is the OLR Tumblr?
It's orangelounge.tumblr.com.
There you go.
We also have a new one called fuckyacagematch.tumblr.com.
I don't remember if we said that on the podcast last week or if that was during the final Afterbirth segment, but we do have a new Tumblr called fuckyacagematch, which we will be uploading songs for those that were saying...
I don't even have a job and I have to sleep.
What's going on?
All right.
Moving on.
Let's talk about the Wii U a little bit because we mentioned it a little bit earlier in the show.
Some rumors about the Wii U. Apparently this week, Adweek ran a report.
Adweek is one of those magazines about what's going on.
Mentioning that Nintendo is talking to content providers about content for the Wii U. So think something like Comcast because that's one of the companies Nintendo's rumored to be dealing with right now.
Imagine if the whole Comcast on-demand thing,
or basically the exact same thing they're putting on the 360, wink wink, comes over to the Wii U. That's what Nintendo's looking at.
Now I gotta say, where Nintendo does have a leg up on the 360 right now is the fact that that tablet controller, that means I can start watching it and I can see the commercial in my head right now.
That Nintendo commercial in my head right now.
They're gonna be watching something on the TV and then mom comes in and says, change the channel, I have to watch Oprah.
Oprah's not on anymore.
I have to watch Dr. Oz.
and so the kid can take the tablet and continue watching their little show on demand into the bedroom.
As long as that's 30 feet away from the actual console.
Or whatever it is.
You know they're gonna stretch the truth a little bit, whatever it is, right?
So...
I remember my very first E3 was the year they showed the DS for the very first time.
And I still remember that commercial because that was a big moment.
And the commercial for the DS showed a mom and a kid on PictoChat.
And the mom was in the kitchen PictoChatting, it's time to come downstairs for breakfast.
And the kid was like, okay, they're having a conversation on PictoChat.
And I'm like, this is the most unrealistic thing I've ever seen in my life.
Because if that were my house,
Rob!
Dinner's ready!
And I'd hear it upstairs.
That's how it worked.
My mom would not open it.
Please come downstairs.
Or if you're a good parent, you'd have bacon cooking and then you don't need to tell people that there's... You don't even care what kind of, you know, what meal it is.
It's bacon cooking, I'm coming down.
Eh.
In my house, it wouldn't have been anything because my mom lived in another state.
I just fixed my food when I wanted it.
There you go.
I'm hungry.
Time to make my own dinner.
I had those nights too.
Too busy playing Zelda.
No, for me it was too busy playing Kirby's Avalanche.
All right.
Back to the... I don't know how he got to bacon, but leave it to the show.
From Nintendo and Comcast.
This doesn't surprise me at all.
Nintendo seems to be following a very similar path to what Xbox 360's been doing.
and you know this is where video game systems are headed so this is logical I think what's honestly surprising most people in this whole thing is that Nintendo is actually kind of planning ahead for a lot of this stuff and thinking about this that's the most surprising part is that wait Nintendo wants to be taken really seriously here well they would be the huge disadvantage if they have a broken old network like they have right now so yeah they kind of have to broken and old
They kind of break my old heart.
I was trying to find a way for it to work.
Well, Sony had some fail already with the Vita.
Their little Facebook app is gone from the store because it's broken.
If you tried to log into it, you got an error code of NP-13144-3 and it meant you had to close the app.
So they just took it down and said, we're working on it, but as for when it's going to be back up, no one said.
It's only some people I think were getting that error.
That's weird, yeah.
I was able to get into Facebook okay.
In fact, I'm going to load it right now and see if it works.
Yeah, they said that they're going to republish it once it's sorted, but the quote is, currently there is no time scale for this.
We found out that it wasn't stealing enough user data so that we had to tweak it so that it would steal the proper amount of user data that Facebook requires.
If downloading this Vita app upgraded me to Timeline, I'm going to be so fucking pissed.
Because you know how everything on Facebook now is like, we want you to upgrade to Timeline.
Turntable tried to do that to me.
You know what?
I updated Timeline back in September.
I actually like the Timeline.
Because then I can put neat pictures up at the top.
I can't...
I can't read a timeline because there's some shit on the left, some shit on the right.
From a design standpoint, I don't like it.
I'm trying to speak Jamie's language.
I have the cutest picture on mine of Dan and the baby.
Not my baby.
His cousin's baby.
You want to make that very clear.
It's a cute picture.
I'm going to change it back to Thrall though.
I just read about that the other day Now I can tweet that
If I want to.
I can't email the picture to myself, which would be far too obvious.
But anyway, I can tweet it.
Here's another fun fact.
Did you know that your Vita can receive text messages?
I didn't.
Well, you have a 3G one, right?
Yeah.
Yes, it can receive text messages.
You won't get any notifications, I think, but you can't send text messages.
The reason that is because your Vita has a phone number assigned to it because it has a SIM card and SIM cards have phone numbers assigned to them.
So you can actually text your Vita and you'll get a message saying, you know, this is from the operator.
Like the Matrix.
Operator.
I will say this, though.
I do really like the Twitter app.
It's a little bit slow to load some of the tweets compared to the iPhone one.
But I got to say, the way it's designed is great because I love... It's the first one I've really seen that has those little picture previews right there in the bar, like on the side.
So when people post links to pictures or YouTubes, you can see it without having to actually click on it like you do in the web browser and all that.
So...
I just tweeted it.
I put it on my personal account at S-K-I-E on Twitter.
Sky.
That's pretty cool.
That is one thing I do kind of like about the Vita.
You can kind of do those screenshots and do that.
Jamie trying to get her iPhone hovered just the right angle above my screen.
All right.
Anyhow, let's move on.
More news.
Something else that was kind of borked on the PlayStation Vita was that the PlayStation Plus minis that you get actually don't work on the Vita.
And apparently they're working on fixing that problem.
But right now you can't play those free games that you unlock with the PlayStation Plus membership.
So that's got to suck now, right, Rob?
Because you got a PlayStation Plus membership to check out some of those games.
Thanks for watching!
I'm not gonna... For what they are, they're supposed to be basics.
That's why they're minis.
So for what they are, they're not terrible.
But I'm not crying over the fact that I can't play them right now.
Because I know Sony's gonna fix it.
You know, this is part of what happens when you have the early adopter.
Does it make them look a little stupid for having it happen?
Yeah.
But am I gonna throw a fit over it?
No.
I have Luminous and Katamari and the PSP games to keep me busy.
I'll be fine.
So...
All right, going to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
There's some other timeline haters in our chatroom.
Shadow Charlie says, timeline is garbage.
It's going to be mandatory in a few weeks.
Yeah, I keep hearing about that.
I'm not the most enthusiastic Facebook user right now.
Other comments from our chatroom.
Brad from our friends at PodCulture say, Rob, I'm not a fan of the theme of the Twitter app, but the functionality is nice.
Yeah, it would be nice if you could change the colors up a little bit or put your own designs on it.
But maybe in a future version.
Who knows?
It's still early.
It's not like they can't release a new version later.
Bobby Blackwolf says, The only thing I dislike is that the Twitter app won't upload pics to TwitPic only to Twitter's official photo thing.
That's a good point.
You can't really choose your service on the Vita client.
It's all the official one.
So...
I haven't really messed much with that Flickr app either.
That looked a little weird.
I downloaded it and it was really weird.
I don't really use Flickr, but the way it was organized was kind of weird.
I think if I was actually a Flickr user who had a photo stream set up so I could view friends' pictures, it might be a little better, but most of my picture feeds come through Twitter or, I guess, Facebook.
so I don't I'm not really a Flickr person but I have some people that are really into photography to do it but I know like with Flickr man people will upload like 250 photographs at once it's like that would be a lot to have to scroll through you know like here's all my Disneyland pictures womp so Tiger Claw reminds us there's no Skype in the Vita not yet but there's also isn't there that built-in party chat thing they have now
They have where you can group message, and I think you can use the party chat thing.
I think that's voice chat.
I think so.
I think it's supposed to work with PlayStation 3, too.
There are some things where the Vita and the PlayStation 3 play each other.
I think Wipeout's one of them.
Wipeout is one of them, and...
You know what's kind of funny, though, is you know how they have that one cross-play section where you get all the games that support cross-play?
Wipeout's not on there.
Which is like, huh?
Check again, because I was just looking at the store earlier and Wipeout and... It's Hustle Kings and Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
Weird.
Yeah, and Marvel vs. Capcom 3, I thought the only thing you could do on that was cross-play.
Maybe you can fight other people, but I thought it was just playing the game using the Vita as the controller, but I don't know.
I'm sorry, you say cross-play, and I think of cross-dressing cosplay.
Or unicorns and altered beasts?
No, I mean, I actually think of...
All right, anyhow, well, this is something that'll get maybe some cross-play fans and a lot of other people very excited this week.
I know there's a lot of folks in our chat room that are excited about this news.
New Pokemon games, Black 2 and White 2 have been announced.
And a lot of people went, did they run out of colors?
Like, Black 2, what is this?
What is this?
So, yeah, we don't really know exactly what it is.
It's not gray.
That's what a lot of people were thinking it was going to be.
And the other huge thing about this, it's not the 3DS.
It's the DS.
These are not 3DS games.
These appear to be some type of upgrades or sequels to the existing Pokemon Black and White games.
They will be out on the DS regular, which granted the 3DS can play them.
In Japan in June.
Now, there are some North American details, very few, but they're called here.
It's going to be Pokemon Black Version 2 and Pokemon White Version 2.
We'll get details throughout the year.
So that means we probably won't have it in June.
I'd imagine this is something they're going to be targeting for the holidays.
Again, though, very interesting it's not 3DS.
And the fact that it's a direct sequel.
That's...
What does that mean?
Does that mean it's the same world?
How did they add new Pokemon into it?
How does this work?
But of course, I'm not as up and up on my... I used to love Pokemon 10 years ago, but I don't follow it anymore.
Wouldn't it be hilarious if it was a Game of the Year edition with any additional Pokemon that were offered?
No, it seems like it's going to be richer than that.
I saw some forums comparing it to when they upgraded Green to Emerald.
But that was also a system upgrade with that.
Black and white were on the DS, am I right?
Yeah.
So there's no system upgrade.
It would be funny if they weren't on the DS, if they were on the 3DS and then they downgraded them.
No, I mean, black and white, they could have been advanced for all I know, but they weren't.
No, they were DS titles.
I honestly, truly have not bought a Pokemon game since Sapphire, I think was the last one I had.
I had Pearl.
Yeah, so, ugh.
Ranma suggests instead of version 2, just call it V2.
Why couldn't they have just done Pokemon Ebony and Pokemon Ivory?
I mean, they could have just named it something.
Then they could have had that song.
Dan was expecting Pokemon Gray.
I think a lot of people were.
I even heard somebody saying Gray and Gray, like G-R-E and G-R-A.
Why?
Which would have been weird.
Why don't they just do one called Pokemans?
That's it.
Or how about Pokemon Rainbow?
Pokemon 3D.
Done.
Because we have Colosseum.
Would y'all be that tore up if they just ditched the color thing?
Maybe you would.
I don't know.
But you know what?
If there are more Pokemons to be had, there will be people buying these games.
Touch them, love them.
That's right.
Touch them, love them.
And you never know what type of internet things they might try to build into this or whatever.
Where's my Pokemon MMO?
Maybe that's what's happening on the 3DS.
You're right.
Someone tried to do that and they got sued.
Of course they did.
Nintendo, what's your money?
SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom at chat.orange.com says doesn't matter what platform it's on it will make millions Ragenator says no Pokemon Fuchsia?
Pokemon Checkerboard?
It said Pokemon Clear How about Pokemon Peaceful Meadow?
Pokemon Bloody Tampon.
Stop it.
Moving on.
None of them know what we're talking about.
It's for the best.
Good.
Well, how about that Double Fine Adventure thing?
They want it to be 2D.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
If you're going to do a 2D game, typically it has to be pixel based.
If you're going to do something that's going to flow like paint, it's going to have to still have a 3D element to it for that level of animation.
unless it's all vector based and then to do that is a little bit different too because vector graphics are going to need to have a screen capable of displaying mathematically calculated vectors where most games are going to need some type of raster thing to view it, right?
So I don't think that's going to be possible unless they do it some sort of shaded 3D.
but the thing on here and I'm going to read this quote one of the things I missed about 2D graphic adventures is that you would be able to have a great artist expressing themselves directly on screen not having to go through 3D shaders or any of the complicated technology might change or alter their vision
I just don't think it's going to be possible without... For what they're describing, it's not going to be possible to do it in a pixel-based format.
I don't think so.
But for all those people that pre-ordered it, which is what we've been calling Kickstarter on Bobby's show earlier this evening when he was talking to us at the end of the show there.
We were talking about how Kickstarter is basically the new pre-ordering.
They'll get to see the whole journal and if it works or not.
Yeah.
It'll be interesting.
Yeah.
I mean, now, I'm trying to think in terms of pixel graphics at high definition and possibly but it's gonna be a monster for memory it would just be a monster for memory so they would really have to be careful to make it work
Let's travel around the world and check out some games that will be coming out a whole lot sooner than this Double Fine game.
As in this week, Loki.
There's a few things coming out this week.
Poke Park 2 Wonders Beyond for the Nintendo Wii.
Well, there's something for the Pokemon people.
You can have it right now.
What the fuck is PokePark?
PokePark is basically... Do we get to poke them with the Wiimote?
No, it's like kind of a spin-off of the Pokemon series where you play as Pikachu and you go through some crappy adventure with Pokemon.
Sounds like a kid's game.
Yeah.
All right.
Pretty much.
And then also this week, we have Lord of the Rings Online, the Myth Roll Edition, which is a prior re-release there.
Binary Domain on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 from Sega.
Order Up on the PlayStation 3 with Move support from Ignition.
Order Up is kind of like Cooking Mama on the Wii.
Country Dance All-Stars for the Xbox 360 and Kinect.
Yeehaw.
Hyperdimension Neptunia MK2 the game where you play I guess
Game consoles turned into anime chicks.
That's from Tecmo Koei.
And this week, Mortal Kombat The Complete Edition with all the DLC included plus a voucher for the very first Mortal Kombat movie and the soundtrack.
That's on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
Alan secretly wants me to get that.
I was like, why?
I already own Mortal Kombat.
This game looks pretty awesome.
One I'm kind of looking forward to this week, SSX on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
And finally for the Nintendo DS, Shin Megami Tensei Devil Survivor 2.
Let's go to Japan and look at the releases over there.
One Piece, Kaizuko Musou.
I don't think that's somebody actually wearing a One Piece.
This is... Dynasty Warriors of One Piece.
One Piece is not a me.
Aha, so there it is.
Yeah, historical heroes.
It's like a clash.
It's a beat-em-up game.
They're stretchy pirates.
Yeah.
On top of that, there's a bad guy in there who has this spear.
What's it called?
A...
Sling Shot Sling Shot
If you're interested in that style of gameplay, you should really check out the CyberConnect2 stuff, like the Naruto games.
They are gorgeous.
It's like, holy crap, anime live.
You know what's funny?
I have an issue of Shonen Jump from 1992 with the original One Piece and Dragon Ball Z in it.
Old, huh?
Why do I do Japanese releases on this show?
Because I don't know any of this, but I guess that's a funny thing.
You're being ironic, Rob.
That game is big enough where they're releasing a PlayStation 3 themed console slash game included whole thing with that.
Oh yeah, One Piece is big.
DarkSakura.com
which not a lot of people had.
Oh yeah?
I have it too.
That translucent green instead of the black.
We've got like three different versions of the Xbox 360.
Oh yeah, yeah.
Doraemon Nobita, No Kisuke, No Shima
Well, it's even slower in the UK.
On March 2nd, we have Mario Party 9 for the Wii, Mortal Kombat Complete Edition for 360 and PS3 and SSX.
That's it.
All right.
I guess everybody's preoccupied with the Vita or something.
All right, Loki.
They must be.
I can't think of any other thing they could be occupied with.
Here's something interesting.
I think we've talked a little bit about how some of these...
Sony has patented a new...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
players would move in front of and interact with and also it says embodiments of present invention provided real time interactive gaming experiences for users for example users can interact with various computer generated objects in real time that definitely sounds like the Kinect what happened to the move where did that go
I really want them to come out with a controller-less thing and go, you know, with the whole, well, you need buttons.
Buttons are where it's at.
You know, button, button, button.
And then, you know, honestly, I think they should have both.
I think that...
Perhaps the PlayStation Eye camera is just not really good at capturing the rest of your body aside from moving the controller around, the PlayStation Eye or the Move stuff.
So maybe that's what it is.
It's like an upgrade to the PlayStation Eye camera that's going to be used in conjunction with the PlayStation Move stuff so that you have your buttons, you have your controller inputs and stuff like that, plus you have the rest of your body capturing stuff.
I don't know.
PS3, PS4, PS5
What's the next big thing with the PlayStation?
And the one I really want to know about is Microsoft.
What do they got going this year?
I'm going to assume Halo 4 is going to really dominate their press conference, but what else?
It's kind of the question I wanted answered last year.
Now show me how Kinect is really going to change my life.
Well, for like their press conferences go, you're going to probably see something.
I'm going to be willing to bet that they're going to show Call of Duty, whatever new Call of Duty is.
It's going to be a big portion of their thing because they're probably going to have exclusive DLC again or exclusive window on DLC.
I bet you they're going to show something about Grand Theft Auto 5, which they're probably going to have an exclusive DLC on that, much like they did with the 4 franchise.
And then...
Oh, there's a new Assassin's Creed game coming out.
Maybe they'll show something on that.
I think as far as first-party stuff goes, I mean, Gears of War, I don't know if there's going to be a new Gears of War game this year.
I mean, I don't... I'd be really curious at Sony's press conference to see if Final Fantasy XIV returns because we're looking at this very interesting thing that's never happened in gaming before that I can think of where the launch of the game on PC was so fast
I'm very curious to see if they get up there on that stage and say, Final Fantasy XIV is coming out on the PlayStation 3 in an ex-
in a new version developed for the PlayStation 3.
Whatever the fuck they embellish it with.
Because they were so excited when they had it as the exclusive.
Remember a couple years ago?
Not so excited anymore.
Oh shit, we still have to put this game out?
Versus 13 could be a thing, though.
Versus 13 is still, you know.
That could be awesome.
I just, I don't know.
Right now, they've been pretty good about keeping secrets so far.
We've still got a few more months.
That's right.
That's right.
Let the hype begin.
All right, well, speaking of letting the hype begin, this is certainly interesting.
Okay, so Nintendo had the press conference this week where we mentioned a lot of the news.
By the way, I've got to do a quick tangent.
I gotta say, this is pretty clever.
I woke up the other morning and my little swap note button is lit, meaning I have a new message on the 3DS swap note.
And I was like, oh yay, somebody sent me another 3D cat picture, because that's pretty much all I ever get on swap note.
Or fish, now I've been getting fish this week.
So I open it up, and it's a message from Reggie Fils-Aimé on my swap note.
And it even goes, hi, this is Reggie from Nintendo.
Because you can do like a little five-second audio clip.
And it's Reggie's little me.
And it says, join me tomorrow at 6 a.m.
LOL.
For a Nintendo Direct announcement.
And I even showed it to Alan, and we were both kind of like, you know, that is a pretty clever way to spam.
and it even unlocked that stationary for use with other swap note stuff.
So it was like, hey, Nintendo spammed me, but I got something out of it.
I got a new stationary for my next cat picture.
Anyhow, so as part of this whole Nintendo Direct Conference, they, of course, mentioned the last story, which, you know, Loki said they would do at some point, come out.
I think you said they'd do it last year, but they're going to come out and say, No, I thought they were going to do it in E3.
In E3, yeah, well, and then I said PAX.
Wait, are we still missing one?
There's still one game.
There's still Pandora's Tower, but it's coming out in Europe.
We talked last week.
Europe's got a date.
No, it's...
this is happening because the Wii is not even going to get a mention in this year's E3 it's all about the Wii U they have to get people excited for the Wii U they have to
Anyhow, 3DS.
They'll still say some stuff on the 3DS.
And this might be something you see more about at E3 this year.
All we got was a hint this week at the Nintendo Direct Conference.
Capcom, Bandai Namco, and Sega are all working on something.
That's it.
And apparently there's a little teaser site...
I don't know, this is the first time I'm seeing this.
This is a Japanese site.
I apologize in advance if this autoplays music, but I didn't even realize it had its own teaser site.
Because what in the fuck are they going to show?
What is this supposed to be?
Oh, is this like one of those freaking... It's an elevator.
No, it's a... What do they call those games?
Oh... ARG.
ARG.
Oh no.
So they punched in a little code and...
Now we see Steam and we see the three logos.
And Bon Presto up in the corner.
Who knows?
That could be anything.
Maybe they all are also working on the next Super Smash Bros.
and you're going to have Mega Man and Pac-Man and Sonic.
It'll be bad art.
Bad box art.
You don't get it.
A lot of people's minds are going straight to a fighting game, which makes sense.
That's what we've seen a lot of crossover.
Street Fighter X, Tekken X, Dead or Alive.
Was Dead or Alive a Sega game?
No, maybe not.
No, that was Team Ninja.
Virtua Fighter.
Virtua Fighter?
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
Virtua Pack Fighter.
You know what?
Okay, I just want to remind everybody, when Namco and Sega and Nintendo worked together before, that was the F-Zero arcade game.
Just throwing it out there.
Maybe they're going to let Capcom have their share.
I don't know.
A fanboy can dream.
Capcom doesn't have any.
So, okay.
So if you want that, so it's going to be... Exactly.
Capcom doesn't have a racer franchise.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You're wrong.
They do have a racer franchise.
What do they have?
It would be... Here's what it would be.
It would be Daytona cross Ridge Racer cross MotoGP because that's the Capcom franchise.
Just get out.
Get out.
In space!
You get nothing!
You lose!
Good day, sir!
They really need to do a new Excite Truck.
No, let it go.
That would sell me a Wii U, a new Excite Truck.
I'm telling you.
If they announce a new Excite Truck for the 3DS, I will be pissed.
I will be, what the fuck?
They're not.
I understand that.
You're fine.
They're not.
Let Excite Truck go.
They already poo-pooed on that franchise.
Excite Bots, Loki.
That's what you got.
You got Excite Bots.
Rob.
What?
Virtua Calibur.
I really want to slap whoever at Nintendo is like, hey, you know what racing games need?
Mini games in the middle of the fucking race.
That's fantastic.
Yeah, mini games.
Let's go back to a time when games were simpler.
Not this one.
In a segment we call the classic game of the week.
Back when game companies, they didn't work together.
They all hated each other's guts.
In fact, there was a big rivalry between Sierra Online and Lucasfilm Games.
Actually, I don't know if there really was that big of a rivalry.
I just made that up.
What's the classic game of the week, DarkSakura?
Loom.
Which is one of my favorite games.
Excellent pick, by the way.
I'm surprised I hadn't done it before, but I love the music in this game.
At any rate, Loom was put out by Lucasfilm Games, which is now LucasArts.
And it was the fourth game that used the SCUMM engine.
I still like saying the SCUMM engine.
And was led by Brian Moriarty, who was the guy who gave us Wishbringer, Trinity, and Beyond Zork.
Just saying.
Actually, it's on Steam now.
You can play Loom on Steam, and it's like five bucks.
Really?
I didn't know that.
Yeah, I have it on Steam.
Nice.
So it's an adventure game, and it's really different because it's a big fantasy story set in the future, and its interface is actually very different for its time.
So basically with the game is that you play a little guy named Bobbin Threadbear, who has a distaff, and you can play a spell that is musical, like one of them is called Opening, or you have Night Vision, or Sharpening.
It's a different...
Thank you for watching!
Terror, I guess, is calming.
Anyway.
But at first when you only play the game, you only have the notes C, D, and E. And as you get through it, you actually get a full scale on the C scale.
It's like an ocarina.
Except it's a staff.
so basically it actually just followed the LucasArts game design philosophy where a character will never be killed or forced to restart the game and won't have to spend hours typing in synonyms until they get it so basically it has different difficulty levels you have like an easy to an expert level and the expert level actually doesn't have any of the notes marked on the staff you have to play it by ear
but you do have a different graphic sequences that play after that and that's only on the original version but the DOS CD-ROM version has a different graphics to it too
So anyway, the drafts are the same way spells work.
Like I said, you've got different ones that do different things.
And you also have this thing on the island that Bobbin lives on called the Great Loom.
And it's on Loom Island.
And it can echo the last draft that was spun in its presence.
So the only ones that can't are the ones that Bobbin did by himself.
So you can't really forget a draft that you do.
You'll learn everything in the presence of the loom.
So basically, it's got a really in-depth story, too.
This audio play came with it that was...
It was like a cassette that had all of this prequel story leading up to it about how it's in... Let me see if I can find the world.
It's in the future.
It's in 8021.
And basically people have dissolved into different types of guilds and the weavers have decided to form this great loom that controls all of reality.
Except they stopped being able to have kids, so this one woman named Signa Threadbear sneaks past them and actually weaves a gray thread into the great loom, and out of it comes an infant.
And they turn her into a swan.
And this one other woman decides to raise Bobbin.
This is starting to sound like a Bjork video.
It's awesome.
But anyway, the elders are actually named after the three fates of Greek mythology.
They... As things happen, the woman who raises Bobbin... And I'm trying to find her name.
I think it was like Hatch something.
It's been a while.
I'm trying to see if I can find it in the article.
But...
This woman who ends up raising him, oh, Dame Hetchel, that was her name, who was a serving woman.
She ends up teaching Bobbin how to weave drafts, which he wasn't supposed to learn until he turned 17.
And so she gets turned into a swan too.
or no she gets turned into a different kind of bird but as it goes on basically everyone on the island gets turned into a swan and they fly off and the only one left is Bobbin so he's trying to figure out what's going on um
So yeah, the swan appears and casts a spell on all of the villagers.
So all the weavens except Bobbin are turned into swans.
And it turns out that this one, I think, is his mother.
So this cleric actually takes the weaver's distaff to take over the world with an army of undead.
And basically Bobbin gets it and has to go on to fight chaos.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
as uh who was one of uh Bobbin's friends and then um another game called The Fold that was uh Fleece Firmflanks I think that's a funny name Firmflanks um who was gonna work like a character in a John's John Waters movie well he was he's one of the shepherds but he was gonna work with Rusty
and it actually Loom sold a lot of copies but the only reason that the sequels never came out was because basically he wanted to work on other things nobody else wanted to do them so it just sort of fell apart they were ideas as far as getting the game it originally came out on for DOS on an EGA floppy disk
and then it came out to the Amiga, the Atari ST, the Mac and TurboGrafx-16 which actually was a much better version than the other versions.
I did not know the TurboGrafx-16 had one.
Fair Game in Town was selling a copy for $60 and I wanted it so freaking bad.
Wow.
And Dan's like, you already have that game.
Because I have the PC CD and I have it on Steam.
But anyway, like I said, Loon came out later on CD-ROM for the FM Town's computer and it was a VGA enhanced and had a digital soundtrack.
So everything was so much better on it.
It was beautiful.
And then a third version came out on CD-ROM for DOS in 1992 that were really, really souped up.
And it had the talking in it.
Like, we've got some samples of the voice.
Yes, we do.
It had voice acting in it.
Is this just right at the beginning here?
Yeah.
So Bobbin's walking along.
Ouch.
He gets hit by a rabbit.
Bird steals a rabbit.
Destiny shall draw the lightning down from heaven, roll its thunder far across the sea, to where I wait upon the shore of wonder.
On the day the sky is opened and the tree is split asunder.
So you get this when you read different things.
And you've got voice acting in it.
But this actually was the first talking scum game that came out.
And it had a lot of the dialogue was rewritten.
And that's just because they had to edit space.
They needed the space.
So...
They had different solutions to some of the puzzles and different close-ups on the dialogues and different graphics that were included with it.
And this was considered to be the definitive version of Loom.
also there was a rumor that said that Orson Scott Card helped make the original version not true, in fact he even said not true but he did help revise the game's dialogue so he did contribute to the later version of the game, the 1992 version and you can't get the DOS CD-ROM version anymore because of an agreement with Mindscape for licensing, Mindscape is no longer in business by the way
So, the only way that you can play the original versions of it really is by having the SCUMVM virtual machine.
Although, you can't play the FM Towns version.
What about that whole Steam thing?
Let me get to that.
This is like the original discs.
My bad, okay.
Versions.
Now, the voiced CD-ROM version is available on Steam for PC and Mac.
Okay.
And, um, there is a, uh, the, uh, community, actually the Steam community has made a method to play the FM Town version with the Steam version of Loom.
So, it's there.
So, like, as you can hear, some of the music has a search from Swan Lake because of the big swan theme in it.
And the MIDI version was arranged by The Fat Man.
That's what he was called.
Others are full CD versions, they're sequenced versions.
At the time, it really supported all kinds of the different audio processors that were out at the time.
And like I said, with the package, it had an audio tape that had a 30-minute drama that had the nature and the history of the Loom world and about Bobbin being born.
And so the game is a continuation of the story that came on the cassette.
and it had original music that was composed by Jerry Gerber and the actors who were in that reprised their roles for the talkie version most of them did so it really keeps up with that continuity and it was the first commercial cassette that used the Dolby S noise reduction
and it also said that the side A was encoded for Dolby B playback and the side B was the Dolby S playback.
It had an illustrated notebook, the Book of Patterns, which basically all the Apprentice Weavers in the game were given that type of thing.
It had different descriptions in there, had spaces that you could write down what you learned in the game and
because the drafts are random from game to game it said write it in pencil and it also worked as copy protection since the original disc would ask for the order of the notes for your disc for the first spell that you learn and that's how you can prove that your game isn't a copy
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and it was actually appeared in other games.
In The Secret of Monkey Island, there was a guy named Cobb who was in the scum bar and said, wearing a shirt that said, ask me about Loom.
Nice.
and actually in the VGA remake of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade a painting in the vault of the Brunwald Castle reveals a beach that appears as scenery from Loom and in the NES version of Maniac Mansion there's a broken record called The Soundtrack of Loom also in Space Quest 4 there is game parodies there's one called Boom exactly Alan literally just shouted from the other room yes
Yeah.
So that's the game Loom.
You can get it on Steam.
I literally paid... Actually, when I got it, I paid $3 for it because it was on sale.
Totally worth it.
It's an amazing little point and click.
All right.
There it is, your classic game of the week.
You had a lot to say about that one, but it's a... It's a really in-depth kind of game, and I would just be stuck hours playing this game with my friend Marcy.
Good times.
Yeah.
Alright, well that's going to do it for part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere.
We've got plenty more to come when we come back with Orange Lounge Radio.
Another MMO going free to play.
A classic, a classic, classic game from back in the day.
I can't believe I'm calling a Dreamcast game back in the day, but I just did.
Apparently set to come back, so we're going to talk all about that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and saw my 3DS had the blue light on and I was like, oh, Ranma or somebody probably sent me a cat picture.
So I assumed it was Swapnote going off, but it wasn't.
I had suddenly new data.
So you 3DS owners might want to check.
I just suddenly had new data in the Mii Plaza and it told me that the puzzle trading mode, you know, or the picture swap thing, is now available via SpotPass.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
but I thought that was interesting that that just updated right now so those of you the guys with 3DSs that are into that kind of collecting stuff might want to check that out right now because I just got it and I imagine the rest of you probably have it on their way just like the whole Reggie note on swap note earlier so
Project Zero 2 or Fatal Frame 2
It is coming to European regions very soon.
And it's funny because it's like one of those, hey, look, we're translating the English, but you can't have it yet.
You can't have it yet.
You can't have it.
Okay, fine.
You can have it.
No, no, no, you can't.
That's pretty much what they're doing.
So, yes, it's coming to Europe.
When?
When?
No idea.
But the game was actually a remake, I guess, of Project Zero.
Well, fair enough.
I mean, how often does Europe get screwed on having to wait so many months because we got something, you know?
Yeah.
And, of course, they don't specify whether North America will see the release as well, but maybe.
If you beg enough.
This is kind of interesting.
Not really a property that I thought would be getting a game, but apparently it was announced that the Boondock Saints are getting a video game.
And, I mean, absolutely awesome movie.
Kind of curious to see how that would come about, but it is going to be apparently...
They did games on the Godfather.
Those are pretty good.
Yeah, so it happens.
And also Scarface was not bad.
How about a Kill Bill game?
I would see that.
I mean, that would be kind of cool.
That would be fun.
Just, you know, I don't know what exactly it would be.
But that's pretty cool.
So no word exactly what it is, but apparently it's going to be...
I guess part of a panel.
They're going to have Critical Mass Interactive.
They're having a panel about it.
Critical Mass Interactive, they've done outsourced art and design stuff.
They've worked on some of the...
Man, some pretty old games.
Actually, The Outfit, one of the early titles for the Xbox 360, and The Incredible Hulk.
Not sure which Incredible Hulk game that was, but at least this console's generation.
I don't know.
But interesting.
and last but not least I'm very excited about this game one of my must haves of this year Borderlands 2 has been announced that it will be coming to North America September 18th internationally September 21st lots of people excited about that
That game is... Borderlands is awesome.
Have you got a chance to play Borderlands?
I played it a little bit.
Just a little bit.
So not enough to get a full taste of it, but enough to kind of see what people are excited about.
Remember, me and shooters don't always get along.
But I love the... It's a little more Fallout to me.
Yeah, it's a lot of loot dropping.
And they're going to have a lot more loot in this.
And I love how they're kind of self-aware of their own jokes and stuff like...
and of course the trailer had dubstep in it and they promised that they're all 98.6% more wub wub according to the trailer which is great great trailer definitely need to watch it if you haven't also apparently there is an incentive I guess if you pre-order as part of like this premiere club and you'll get a gearbox gun pack a golden key item to unlock some sort of loot chest later on in the game and vault hunters relic and stuff like that
To be honest, the last Borderlands game, that was some really well done DLC right there.
Those expansions were all great.
Every single one of them.
Looking forward to it.
All right well let's talk about Metroid uh yet again another Metroid release don't get too excited it's just the NES classic all over again but I mean the NES game is a true classic but you probably already bought this when it's on when it was on the Wii or heck you have the original cart or maybe you unlocked it with the whole Game Boy Advance cable thing but if you missed somehow although
or if you didn't buy your 3DS early enough that's right oh yeah that's right because the early adopters got this for free well now you'll be able to buy Metroid now keep in mind we're getting this news from Japan but come on inevitably it'll come out here too Japan is getting the Metroid NES release on the 3DS virtual console on February 29th hopefully it's going to be coming here soon after that for those that you know didn't have the early adopter program
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
but I wouldn't get your hopes up because the one that the early adopters have now is not that one and I'm pretty sure all this is is going to be just like the Mario one that came out a couple weeks ago where now you have the more proper save states built in and it's just kind of the quote unquote full release it would have multiplayer except Metroid doesn't use that at all so there you go and price it was I think 600 yen yeah six bucks so a dollar more than it costs on the Wii
So, and, and if you want to put a price tag on your, you know, what you're getting, you know, if you assume like each one's going to be about five bucks and that's a hundred dollars worth of content.
Well, I mean, I was assuming that the Game Boy Advance games would be more expensive, but.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
for all the wrong reasons.
This company called... I don't know what they were.
There was something like Anime Original something.
I don't know.
It was clearly a rip-off company.
Released what's called Pokemon Yellow, right?
The old Game Boy Color?
Or was it Game Boy Regular?
I think it was... Red and blue were regular and then yellow had to be the color one because they added Pikachu because he's popular in the cartoon, right?
I think it actually, no, it was a black and white one.
Was it?
But it had, I think, special coloration available for the Super Game Boy.
That makes sense.
All right, well, anyhow, Pokemon Yellow came out on the iOS App Store, only it wasn't Pokemon.
In fact, it was a dud app.
They were charging 99 cents for this app, and it shot to the top of the charts, apparently on name alone, or some type of insider scheme where they had a bunch of people buy it real fast, so it shot to the top of the charts.
I don't know, but it was garbage.
It wouldn't even boot.
You would launch the app, and it would just die.
and somebody went in there and somehow hacked it, decompiled it and saw that all it was was one of those bullshit apps that's just pictures of Pokemon and maps and Pokemon fan fiction and all this stuff.
I don't know.
It's just a bunch of garbage that they throw into an app and then charge for it.
but because of the fact it was called Pokemon Yellow and they said in the description you know five star just like the original and they made up all these fucking press quotes that weren't attributed anything I mean this whole thing was just a giant ripoff well Apple ended up yanking it from the store but it took them like all weekend to do it and now the question is is Apple gonna refund the money
probably not there is apparently no wait you can't I think you can request the money back yeah if you there's a way that you can uh request it there's some sort of complaint form and you say basically that the app didn't work because it literally didn't work and then they may give you back the money
1,352 reviews.
Let that be a buck lesson that you should do your research on anything you download.
Oh, I didn't buy it.
Well, I meant to anybody that bought it, because it was $1.
Right.
No, if it was a legit release, also look at the company that made it, because a legit release would have come from Nintendo.
And if they had let it out to a third party or something, it would have said the Pokemon company.
But here's the thing, though.
It would have said Licensed Buy.
I understand why they would do that, though.
Well, why people might buy it is because sometimes companies, unscrupulous companies, will take a game and, like, say, port it to the iOS or whatever, you know, through an emulator or something like that, and then it gets yanked and say, ha, it actually was the working version of Pokemon Yellow, but, you know, not licensed or approved or whatever.
Steve Kordek Play More Pinball
How influential?
Well, he's the guy who pretty much thought to do a two-flipper table and kind of designed the modern pinball table.
He gave us drop targets.
Triple action.
Yeah, he also, I guess, later on, he didn't just kind of do triple action that kind of did the standard pinball layout, if you will.
He designed more than 100 tables when he was with Genco and then Williams and Bally.
He did drop targets in Vagabond and Multiball beat the clock in 1963.
So Steve Kordek gave us all those things.
I played that table.
but sadly passed away this week.
It has all the funeral details here.
There's a tribute book available online.
The link is a little lengthy there but I will go ahead and post that link in chat.
I'll leave you with this quote that he mentioned to the Chicago Tribune in 2009 when he had an interview.
I've had more fun in this business than anyone could believe.
Rest in peace.
Well, how about some news that's not quite so sad?
Yes, please.
Topic change.
Yeah.
There's going to be a few 80s stuff coming out.
In fact, specifically, it's a Huey Lewis and the News Pack for a rock band.
There will be Do You Believe in Love, The Heart of Rock and Roll, and I Want a New Drug.
And the latter being one with a pro guitar and bass expansion.
So it's the usual pricing.
440 Microsoft points for the pack.
I want a new drug.
Which, you know, he sued for Ghostbusters for sounding like his little riff in that.
Really?
Yeah.
Also, there is a Best of Just Dance coming out by Ubisoft.
I guess people like Just Dance, so there should be a Best of.
But it's going to be on the Wii in Europe, Middle East, and Asia regions.
Hopefully you'll get some songs from You Can Dance ABBA in there.
Just saying.
Well, the ones listed on here so far are Heya and Firework by Katy Perry, The Only Girl in the World, and Airplanes.
You know, I can't really hate on those games.
They're stupid fun.
If that's what you want to play, go ahead.
And of course, of course, the Kung Fu Fighting.
You can't touch this.
Not the original.
It's by the group Sentry.
And I like to move it.
Move it, move it.
You know what?
It's interesting when these kind of best collections happen.
It's almost like what you see happen in the music world when like, I don't know, who put out a greatest hits CD?
Goldfrapp just last month put out like a greatest hits CD.
So this is kind of like a greatest hits CD of sorts.
But it's not like we haven't seen music games do this before.
Hello, Guitar Hero had a compilation at one point.
DDR, best hits, anybody?
So Konami did it too back in the day.
Back in the day, they still do it.
I was going to say, Best Hits was what?
19, no, probably like 2000 or 2001.
It was a PS1 game.
Well, the last bit on here is it has to do with Star Wars The Old Republic, which I know there are addicts out there that listen to this.
People are averaging four to six hours per gaming session, which according to Greg Zeschuk, who is the...
the head of Bioware Austin says that it's absurd that their sessions are absurd absurd and that uh it's that one more quest one more thing and that uh people are just getting sucked in and he says that Sunday is the busiest day playing um but the average during the average uh work week um you get people playing mid-afternoon because the east coast and uh
Basically, when Europe goes down, North America goes up, so they're getting consistent playtimes, too.
And there are 2 million active subscribers.
So, kind of like WoW.
Yeah.
But with about a fifth of the people for now.
And with more no one care.
I mean... I'm not going to throw shade at Star Wars.
It was a fine month I played the game, but I'll check it out later on once things have leveled out a little more.
Quality life improvements were needed in that game.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I played it when it was in beta.
Well, you may be able to get a chance to play it now because Aeon is going free-to-play.
And apparently, this is coinciding with a 3.0 patch.
One can only hope that a certain other Final Fantasy online game, when it gets its eventual 3.0 patch, will go free-to-play as well.
How in the fuck is XI not free-to-play at this point?
Somebody asked that question on Twitter.
With all these games going free-to-play, how is Final Fantasy XI...
I'm not even going to touch XIV But how is Final Fantasy XI still charging?
But I guess XI does still have its very loyal fanbase They're very attached to that game And it's a fine game It's an MMO It's different, it's not WoW It's very much not WoW I played Ion in the beta, it was a little WoW If XI goes free to play And they pour it to the Vita I may never be seen again That's right, they were talking about XI on the Vita At one point, weren't they?
Imagine if they know that it's going to go free to play soon enough.
Although, if you put XI free to play before Final Fantasy XIV is done, you might as well just shoot it because it's dead.
No one cares.
The reinvention is going to be interesting.
That's all I have to say.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
of 40 and no time limit.
And of course, you know, people who I guess are paying for it, they'll get free activation for 14 days.
And it doesn't say what it's going to cost.
I'm assuming there's going to be some sort of cost thing or some sort of limits for the free to play stuff.
Nope, doesn't say.
So no idea.
I was looking at the specs.
It's like you only get two character slots instead of eight.
Oh, darn.
I know.
Yeah, that's so terrible I'm sure they'll try to nickel and dime you That's what a lot of the free MMOs do I have my Star Trek online, so I'm happy
How is that free?
I've played it twice.
Does it try to nickel and dime you a lot?
Well, I mean, what it did as far as the nickel and dime thing, you have to have cryptic points.
So you actually do have to go in and actively buy a series of points so that you have that.
And now, instead of saying you can unlock this pack and your content is available, it actually puts all of the content on there and lets you know what you have unlocked or not or what you can pay to unlock.
So like for costume packs and extra ships and things.
And it does that like say that you go into the clothing store to change your outfit.
It gives you that option.
DarkSakura,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Actually, I think later tonight or next week.
Better get home.
Well, keep in mind, they're in Scotland.
I'm seven hours behind them.
Right.
So I'm supposed to be meeting up with them either this weekend or next, probably next weekend, to have them get me leveled.
Very cool.
Yeah.
Alright, well, other quick story for you guys.
This is actually really good news.
A lot of people are very excited to hear about this.
Sega put out a teaser trailer this week, 22 seconds, and it revealed that a new Jet Set Radio game, excuse me, not a new game, but a rebirth of the original game is on its way.
Jet Set Radio for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.
If you don't remember, I guess, or is it
is it Jet Grind or Jet Set?
I always get them Jet Grind Japanese version Jet Set American version Jet Grind Jet Grind for us Jet Set Radio Future was the Xbox one Future was the Xbox one that's not the one we're getting we're getting the original one from the Dreamcast
DarkSakura,
Well, but here's the thing, and it's going to be interesting to see how it affects this too, is that while it's really exciting to hear that, and it was a good game, and that was when you skateboarded around and did the graffiti, it was a lot of fun.
It's a cheap-o motto.
Well, that's the whole thing.
The soundtrack.
What happened when Crazy Taxi got re-released?
The, uh, um, fuck was that band?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Offspring.
The Offspring song was gone.
But Bad Religion, wasn't that still the Bad Religion songs?
I think they replaced it with something else.
So it's possible that this game is going to get a different soundtrack.
And that is probably the same thing that's holding up the original Xbox.
The Jet Set Future from coming out is because they can't get the rights to the soundtrack.
They probably only licensed those songs specifically for that.
And so they can't suddenly put it out on 360.
So...
We'll see, because the soundtrack was a huge part of the game.
So it's like, well, they could license equally awesome songs, or they could try and put in generic stuff and see if the game will sell itself on nostalgia alone, which it probably would.
But it's going to be very interesting.
Very interesting to see.
So, anyhow, I'm still excited.
So there.
Also, it is impossible to sing Birthday Cake without doing...
Miho Hattori's accent.
Yes, I'm cooking for my son and his wife.
Extra sugar?
Extra salt?
I love that song.
We actually did get another email in after you checked it, Mr. Rob.
I'm going to read it last, though.
Fine, read it last.
This comes from Haseo Sumirogawa, so maybe it came after I read the last email from him.
Also, if two people shared two PS3 systems for whatever reason, and one bought a new copy of, let's say, Saints Row III with the online pass, and one bought it used without the online pass, could this person download the online pass from the other person's account and be able to play online?
No.
No.
Also, on the note of online passes, can a person without one still update their games and get DLCs?
yes you can get DLC the only thing you can't do is you can't play sadly enough you can't play System Link or whatever they call it LAN and you can't play online co-op well co-op for both of those so you can't play co-op but you can't play well co-op the horde mode as well but the rest of the game you can download DLC you can play single player you can do all that just can't play together
Haseo Sumirogawa
Next email.
Greetings, OLR.
It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
Just wanted to say hi and have a good week.
Your loyal turtle in Philly, Sirius Turtle.
Well, thank you.
Yeah, I guess I'm looking at Amazon.
It's all imports on there.
They want $104 for that Japanese import.
Good lord.
Oh, Chookaboo!
Look at that face!
For the record, Rob.
That is very cute.
It's a mascot cushion.
50 bucks.
I have to tell you something, Rob.
What's that?
Every time I play one of my blood elves and hop on my, um, whatever the crap their peep things are called...
They're striders or whatever.
My brain instantly starts playing the Chocobo music.
And Dan was walking in while I was writing on one, and I was actually humming the Chocobo theme in Undercity.
And he starts going, Chocobo bop!
Chocobo bop!
So it was cute.
Anyway.
Alrighty.
Get down to your Chocobo bop.
Yeah.
TBA for the North American release.
There's no date for this right now.
I could have sworn we had that they had confirmed it was coming here and gave a date, but I guess not.
I would imagine this is an E3 thing.
This is exactly why they're keeping it in their hat.
This is going to be an E3 thing.
Maybe there's a problem with it being on PSP and not PS Vita at this point, too.
But then again...
it came out in Japan with only a couple weeks to go before the Vita came out over there so they could still do it as a download thing they could really push it as a download title here in the US so I don't know someone doesn't have Japanese text installed on this computer yeah I know right well this is the show computer not my personal computer so but anyway I would imagine E3 you gotta hear something on this E3 this is too big of a title to not get released here but we'll see
Okay.
Can I jump in real quick for the chat room?
I want to follow up to something else.
I had several people stating this, is that something to remember about Jet Set Radio is that a lot of the soundtrack was done in-house, so a lot of that will probably stay.
But certainly there was some great licensed music, like the Chibomato comes to mind.
I really hope they're able to get that to stay.
But chatters, you are right.
The original in-house stuff will certainly stay, I'm sure.
Like Space Channel 5 didn't change.
That was all in-house.
Okay.
Dear Orange Lounge, I wanted to write to someone about my recent good experience with Nintendo customer service.
I bought a 3DS the day it came out, two days before the ambassador program began.
I sent my 3DS through the wash.
Now this is understandable if you are maybe 10, but I am 34, so I figured that was the end of that.
Womp womp.
It was my husband who suggested I send the system in for possible repair.
I dragged my heels for several months.
I was sure they would do nothing.
It is $85 to send a system in for repair.
Because my system was less than one year old, I received a $20 discount.
65 days later, I had a shopping label box it up and sent it away.
I explained to them that I sent it through the washer and was expecting to get the broken system back with a not our problem letter.
Wait, wait, $65 later?
because it was $85 to send them, but she had a $20 discount.
Oh, okay.
I thought for a minute, too, you said 65 days later.
I don't know why.
Okay, okay.
I'm good.
Okay.
Nine days later, the box came back, a letter explaining that they could not fix the old system and had replaced it with a brand new one.
My SD card, which I forgot to remove, was taped to the bottom of the cardboard box.
All of my pictures were still on the card.
It included instructions to re-download the lost content at no additional cost.
I had restored all of the games I purchased and was really happy with the new system and the promptness of their response after doing the homework to check the system I found they had signed the replacement system up for the ambassador program all free games were available for me to download squee
I wanted to be able to tell other gamers about this wonderful experience.
Nintendo went above and beyond helping a silly old lady who can't remember to empty her pockets.
Thanks again for your time and your game podcast, Emily.
Well, thank you for the story, Emily.
That's nice.
I guess Mayor Muse.
Well, you know, I think there's something, though, with that ambassador program because I notice you get a little certificate.
Like, I'm looking at my 3DS right now.
There's a little certificate that goes... I have a lot of icons, don't I?
But there's this application there that's just 3DS Ambassador Certificate.
That's all it is, and it sits there.
And when you open it, all it is, if I remember right, is do you want to opt in?
Like, it's just one question.
It says, do you want to opt in for notifications for this title?
Oh, no, no, it's a movie.
That's what it is.
Yeah, they just recently updated it.
Oh, but then they say receive notifications down there.
That's all it is.
So it doesn't really do anything.
But I'm thinking that being on your 3DS is what lets you download all that stuff.
And maybe because, guys, it's inevitable that they're going to come out with another 3DS.
Like they're going to incorporate that second circle pad into a new 3DS at some point.
So I've got to be able to transfer my ambassador shit over there.
So I'm thinking that little guy being there is the key somehow.
This probably ties to my console number somehow.
And Nintendo probably can generate that somehow in-house and did for your, you know, when you sent your 3DS back.
But that's great.
I mean, you're right.
Not a lot of folks would do that.
Oh, hey, my SpotPass notification just went off.
Look at that.
Aww.
That means kitty pictures in 3D.
Oh, Lord.
Yes, it's a swap note.
Oh, squee, I'm going to look that up.
Oh, great.
All right.
Wow, a Rick Santorum portrait made entirely of gay porn.
Talked about that on Horde House already.
Wow, it's made up of a lot of legs.
So, yeah.
That's it for the emails.
All right.
I want to see more good customer service posts.
Messages like that, that makes me feel joyous in my soul.
Bobby is in our chatroom, Bobby Blackwolf, saying, Rob, all that certificate does is let you get spot pass notifications.
Well, yeah, that's what the app does, but I thought, and I could have thought wrong, that somehow that application existing was what kind of enabled my 3DS to get all that.
Because obviously they've got to be looking at the MAC address on my system or something on the back end that tells them.
But, meh.
All right.
TigerClaw saying he sent me a swap note earlier.
Maybe it's finally getting here.
It seems like it takes a couple hours for things to get here.
No, this is Ranma.
Ranma has sent me a cat.
This is Indy.
He purrs like a race car.
Oh, because his name's Indy.
Look at that.
There's Indy.
Sorry, I'm derailing.
I'm derailing this radio show with my 3D pictures.
All right.
Any more emails?
You just made my eyes hurt here.
Sorry.
Alright, then let's get to the FUs.
Dan does that shit to me too with his phone.
Because he has that Android phone that has the 3D pictures.
Oh, really?
Here, let me do this.
There.
Now I'm not looking at it.
I'll close it.
It's fine.
Alright, what an appropriate time to get to the FUs of the week.
My FU of the week, I have a few actually because I've had a pissy week.
Number one, to me and involuntary actions of myself.
Also, FU to misunderstandings and...
Don't be an asshole.
Good advice.
To anybody.
Just because you're a parent doesn't mean you can be an asshole to your kids.
Treat them with respect, too.
That's it.
All right.
Loki.
Fuck you to people that don't know how to put lids on fast food drinks.
I mean, seriously, it's not that hard, people.
It's not hard to snap a lid on there.
If you really don't have that skill set, then you should just jump off a bridge, I think.
My F.U.
of the week isn't that serious because luckily things have been pretty good this week so I can't complain too much but I will give an F.U.
F.U.
to the fact that I forgot I have a doctor's appointment in the morning and I have like this stack of paperwork I have to fill out like I really don't want to do that tonight after the show but I F.U.
But I will say an F.U.
A very serious F.U.
to this amazing dessert I had at BJ's which yes is the name of a restaurant get your mind out of the gutter I had a pizookie
Their flavor right now is red velvet pizookie.
Oh my god!
You bitch.
I haven't been to BJ's in a while.
The last time I was there, they only had the chocolate and the peanut butter.
Yeah, it used to be like Oreo and regular.
Did it still taste like eating granulated sugar?
Kinda, but I didn't even care.
Chocolate chip or chunk or whatever.
But, but, but, but... Red velvet.
Oh my god.
I'm torn because they're putting in a Chick-fil-A in Folsom.
Now, Chick-fil-A openly supports propaganda against the gays in that community and stuff.
But their breakfast sandwiches are so delicious.
It's actually okay in Sacramento because the local franchise owners here in Sacramento actually support pro-LGBT causes.
But is that one the same franchise owner?
You'll have to check.
You'll have to check, but hopefully... The Arden one?
The owners are on the Lavender Chamber of Commerce.
They are on the Rainbow Chamber of Commerce because they are... I thought it was Lavender here.
Well, whatever.
It's gay.
Well, no, the owners... They're a couple.
They just want to offset, you know?
people's images of Chick-fil-A I know the corporate thing still goes towards those big charities but I like to think that their little bit is offsetting that part of what Chick-fil-A does and that the children's programs and everything and the education programs are still good I don't know it's hard to be okay with a service that is preaching hate in one hand yet doing really good things for kids you know, I don't know what to think my brain explodes
JV Mon just had the balls to tell me in chat that Red Velvet is overrated and you know what my response was?
Get out!
All right, he can stay, but don't you ever talk bad about Red Velvet again.
All right, moving on.
So yeah, it looks like you'll be okay to get your breakfast sandwiches, Loki.
The rest of you, you'll have to come to Sacramento to do it.
I probably won't be able to go over there, but they were really, really good.
We went there.
I actually checked into Facebook or something on it, and I had all these replies.
I said, what in the hell are you doing at Chick-fil-A?
Don't you know you're not supposed to go there?
I'm like, no, you guys, it's okay.
This one's okay.
It's not as bad.
and Bacon Maple Donuts are fucking delicious.
All right.
I do have to tell you one thing about Chick-fil-A when I lived in Alabama.
What?
I worked at the mall and the Chick-fil-A there because my friends worked there.
They would always save me the little tiny hash brown things from breakfast so that I could have them anytime during the day.
Nice.
And those things in Polynesian sauce are crack.
Let's move on so we can get to Twitter topics and the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
But not just yet, because we have just a few more stories for you guys.
Loki.
Now this is kind of weird.
They're actually going to be putting out a free-to-play multiplayer version of Killzone 3 on the PlayStation Network.
Now this is the multiplayer portion of Killzone 3.
It's not really anything new, but it's going to be free-to-play.
Thanks for watching!
Most of the people are paying for the multiplayer portion of Call of Duty, not so much the campaign.
You can just kind of skip the pleasantries and just get the multiplayer portion, plus it's free to play.
I mean, it's an interesting experiment that they're trying.
That is, I guess, available soon.
on Tuesday.
Sorry I'm furiously adding people to my 3DS over here because I had somebody ask for cat pics so I needed friend code.
Alright.
I'm trying to think of other cases where this has been done before where they stripped out part of the game and then kind of like put it up on the marketplace just by its own.
Kind of interesting.
We had a story last week about Metal Gear Solid 4's online component was shutting down and it seems strange to me that they didn't try to strip that out at some point and kind of make it a standalone game.
Probably because no one played it.
That's why they shut the servers down.
They're like, well, we'll just disappoint those two people still playing their
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Bionic Commando Rearmed Barcelona Grin
What? !
Wack
You'd hear a little, and, oh, there's all this blood everywhere.
Like, one of those little quick blade things, and then all of a sudden... You mean his cipher?
Yeah, that's a cipher.
Because this totally reminds me of the opening to Cube.
Oh, you got split in half.
Sucks to be that guy.
Well, here's the thing, though.
Capcom worked on, or excuse me, Grin Barcelona worked on that.
Capcom rejected it.
Capcom canceled the project.
Grin was going to do it anyway and just change the IP.
Make it like, you know, Ninja Game, you know, or something a little different.
But after that didn't happen, it got canceled.
They tried to do a Streets of Rage reboot instead.
and Sega and it didn't happen they got shut down so it's very I mean Grin did Bionic Commando they were trying Strider they were doing Final Fantasy they apparently had Streets of Rage
Goddamn, they were working on a lot of classic reboots.
I don't think any of us realized how vested they were in bringing back old shit.
I'm just imagining a Metal Gear Solid-style game with Strider Hero.
In concept, you kind of look at it like Strider was pretty fucking awesome.
So, Metal Gear Rising Revengeance, which Revengeance is such a stupid name.
That's the Capcom Namco Sega project.
Revengeance.
That's a dumb name.
But yeah, there's a bunch of artwork on this Spanish website that you can kind of look at some of the concept art for the Strider thing that got cancelled.
But you don't actually see Strider, just so you know.
They had to change it.
That makes me sad.
That's something they'll probably show at E3 is Melody Rising stuff.
Oh yeah, Metal Gear, I was like, what are you talking about?
Grim got canned in 2009.
Although Capcom really should do Strider because what else do they got?
They're rebooting Devil May Cry, I guess.
I just saw some article on the internet this week too about like it was defending Strider.
Oh no, you posted on Facebook for Dan.
It was a whole thing about Strider on the NES was not that bad.
Thanks for watching!
and he of course he also worked on Strider 2 which is easy but very fun and um but that moon dancer is like basically like a four-player Strider yeah it is it's cool I like that so all right uh there you go just interesting that that studio was working on all that and finally got leaked by
A disgruntled employee Well, we need more I mean, not really So, you know that Oklahoma law that we had actually discussed before about a bill to put a 1% tax on violent video games?
Well, it failed Like we knew it would
Basically, this guy has such an awesomely badass name.
Too bad he's, you know, stupid.
William Forekiller.
Forekiller.
Rawr.
Anyway, he suggested that any game with an ESRB rating of teen or above should have the tax on it, and that the revenue would go to fighting childhood obesity and bullying.
um it was tweaked to focus on creating a task force into the relationship of video games to the two issues and it was voted down by a margin of five to six
and so one of the other representatives Pat Owenby asked why video games why not french fries or rap music or movies and 4killer said we have to start somewhere there's no magic bullet that will solve these issues but I wanted to raise awareness of those two issues and basically everyone said representative Mike Reynolds said it's not a good idea we could have a task force on the multiple reasons of childhood obesity so
Nope.
Basically, it's been failing.
It failed before in New Mexico in 2008.
At least your state won't be spending $1.8 million to defend it in court.
Just saying.
Foo!
Yes, exactly.
Foo, indeed.
All right, anyhow.
Yeah, that's it.
Moving on, Loki.
All right.
So we've kind of seen this type of thing happen before and kind of know where it's going to go, but we'll give them the benefit of the doubt.
Apparently, there's a new game called BandFuse that's going to be coming out, BandFuse Rock Legends.
It uses real guitars to play, learn music, or whatever.
And also, they're having microphones involved in this as well.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
A bunch of big name artists in it as well.
I want to say this is being put out by... Because I saw this a while back and I was like, another music game, another guitar game.
I can't remember who's publishing it.
I want to say it's a really small company like Maximum Family Games or something like that.
So there's going to be no sort of advertising or whatever on it.
But...
Yeah, it'll be coming out this fall and probably will do just about as well as... What was that?
PowerGig.
PowerGig.
Because I was going to say, I think this game already exists like twice.
Well, yeah.
One of them is doing pretty well and the other one not as well.
Rocksmith did okay, but PowerGig tanked.
Right.
I think it's just that whole... Well...
You have to buy a guitar if you don't already have one.
And, I mean, if you have one, you probably have other ways to learn how to play guitar other than buying a $60 game.
Well, you know what, though?
And I think I talked about this a couple weeks ago on the show, is that I don't know anyone who bought Power Gig, but I do know some actual musicians who bought Rocksmith just because it was kind of something that was relevant to their interest, and they're really into it because it's so...
It's actual guitar playing unlike rock band is more the plastic instruments.
Although rock band tried to incorporate it, I guess Rocksmith takes a much better teaching approach to it.
And I think a lot of musicians really appreciate that.
At least that's what I'm seeing.
But does it necessitate three different games?
No.
But then again, we didn't really need Rock Revolution either.
No.
so this I hate to say it but I think this band fuse rock legends is going to end up being the rock revolution of the bunch I mean yeah we'll see we'll see what they do with it who knows so all right anyhow one more story for you guys and then we're going to open up the skype line and I think this is great news an old classic game is coming back to the 3ds Seaman
Yay!
That's right, Seaman.
Get your minds out of the gutter.
Seaman, with an A. Seaman is coming out on the 3DS.
It is a report from a Japanese news outlet named Nikkei.
C-Man is apparently targeted by Nintendo to come back to the 3DS that's the type of thing that Nintendo is targeting but there's no other detail on the update so I don't think we're talking about just like a dump of the Dreamcast game I think we're talking about
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
that would say cute things like mar mar mar and you keep talking to them and eventually they would start talking back and ask you questions and be kind of rude to you and then they would eventually because you had to moderate their temperature in their tank and water level and all of this and eventually they would grow amphibious and you would turn their little tank into a terrarium and then mar mar mar
Dan and I would say that over and over again when we were first playing that game.
And then we got Hey You Pikachu, which was... Which already existed.
Oh, did it?
I believe it did.
It was actually called Pikachu Genkidichu.
And that actually was already out in Japan.
So, what month is your birthday in?
October
You were born in October?
Yes.
Let's try that again.
In what month were you born?
October.
You were born in October?
Yes.
I wonder if people would say you're a trick or a treat.
That's a good one.
Like the spice.
You know, I never noticed that Seaman sounds like George Takei.
Well, you can look, but don't touch.
I don't want to touch you.
What do you want?
To touch you.
I don't know that word.
You just said it.
So, what day is your birthday on?
The 2nd.
The 2nd?
Yes, bitch.
Mahatma Gandhi was also born on October 2nd.
I hope you are as peaceful as he.
I would loathe to be stuck in here with an aggressive human being.
Fuck you.
Listen, I don't know if our relationship can handle this, you know?
Besides, what would the neighbors think?
Fuck them!
Fuck them!
Hey, why all the noise?
Your mama.
What?
Your mama.
Mama.
Nope, I'm just fine.
Wait.
Sorry, I'm busy.
You don't look busy.
I've been thinking about this, and if my calculations are correct, you must be a Libra.
I'll bet you get crushes on people all the time, huh?
Just don't get any ideas about me.
Let's just be friends.
For now.
I'll friend your butt.
Are you coming on to me?
Yes.
Yes!
Put this tongue in that mouth.
Dream on.
No fool for you.
Now go think about what I've said and we'll talk again later.
Apparently that same guy has a bunch of playthroughs on there, but none are as good as I'll Fringe Your Butt.
So there you go.
And that clip is from 2008.
But then again, Seaman was what?
2001?
Something like that.
There you go.
All right.
That does it for the news tonight.
And we're going to open up the Skype line right now at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
There it is.
Did the Oscars finally finish?
Is it over?
I don't know.
I haven't cared.
I've just been looking at Rafferazzi.
That site has been funnier than anything that ever could have been.
I'm assuming the artist won.
Whatever.
Seems like it from Twitter.
All because of the picture of them drinking little bottles of Grey Goose on stage with the hashtag Scorsese.
Scorsese.
Did that chick win an Oscar for pooping in the sink?
What?
That was like her thing in Bridesmaids.
Forget it.
I didn't see that.
All right.
1-877-GAME-OLR.
I see good movies, Rob.
What are you talking about?
Apparently the Bridesmaids was pretty good.
That's what I'm hearing.
All right, moving on.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
It's Ranma.
What's up, everyone?
Hey, how you doing, Ronnie?
I'm doing pretty good.
How about you, Rob?
Good.
I'm just looking at chat room and Bobby saying, I'll Oscar your butt.
Oh, wow.
Well played.
What's on your mind, Ranma?
I went out and got a 3DS.
That's why you were dogging on the Vita in chat, because I was like, man, Ranma's hating on the Vita.
Oh, now it's explained.
You just bought a 3DS.
Actually, no.
I have other reasons for hating on the 3DS.
All right, let's talk about your seething hatred first.
Wait, wait.
You have reasons for hating on 3DS?
No, no, not the 3DS.
No, no, no.
What are your reasons for hating on the Vita?
I still stand by the point of the price of it.
I mean, because I remember when the PSP came out and I was there selling them.
And then it's like that whole week they sold it.
After that, it just dropped.
Nobody wanted one.
It just didn't go anywhere.
I just feel that it's the Vita.
It may have to say the Vita.
And I understand that.
Sony is going to say with the PS3, for a premium system, you have to pay a premium price.
I just think that Nintendo kind of set the price point of where if the portable console is like under $150 or within the $150-$200 range, it's well worth it.
But for $249 for a portable console or $299 for another portable console, you're better off just buying a regular system and hooking it up to your TV.
Alright, I mean, I can see that.
The $299 is for the 3G model, and that'll buy you a PlayStation 3.
So, I can see where the price is hurting people, but...
I don't know.
I'm a sucker for this shit.
What can I say?
I'm not hating.
I want a Vita.
But I will gladly wait until the price comes down.
I just can't see $250 for a portable console, but I could put that towards a system hookup to my TV.
All right, so let's make this a conversation about love instead.
So you bought your 3DS.
Yes.
I'm assuming you like it.
Love it.
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.
Well, what made you decide I'm going to take the plunge and get a 3DS?
Mario Kart 7.
Is that it?
Mario Kart 7 was a good enough game where you were like, that's it, I'm buying it, or is there stuff on the horizon?
Actually, at first, that's what really did it for me, because I love playing the Mario Kart racing games.
But when I went to get my 3DS, they were sold out of it, and I'm looking at whatever games was left, and I found, upon the last copy of Star Fox 64 3DS, and I picked that up.
And those are my games I've been playing back and forth.
All right.
Well, what are you looking forward to in the future from 3DS?
Or is Mario Kart 7 going to last you through 2013?
I don't know if it's going to last through 2013, but I've already... Swap note, Will!
Oh, yeah.
3DS kitties.
I know, I'm glad you liked the kitty.
I did.
Do you like the 3D cats I send you?
Of course.
Now that we have a cat, his name is India, I have to start taking a few more shots and sending them over to everyone.
Right answer.
And then I'll show your cat to my cat, and it'll be awkward because cats can't see the 3D.
But anyway...
and I find it kind of amusing, like you say about Swapnote, because this whole weekend I'm at Manga Next and every time I sit down and pull out my 3DS to play a game, I see the little icon to go over to the Mii Plaza and I'm like going through Find Mii and the puzzle swap and I'm like, at this rate, I will not get a chance to play the games that I want to play.
Oh yeah, cons, you get that stuff crazy fast.
I can't even tell you, last year at E3, keep in mind the price drop hadn't happened yet.
I was sitting there in the E3, oh my god, you would open up your 3DS and 10 characters are there.
You process them all and take them through 5E and then another 5 more have arrived.
It's just crazy.
I've noticed that at 10, it only lets you bring 10 friends in at a time.
Yes.
Tip.
Pro tip.
But now there's Find Me 2 and now there's Puzzle Swaps and been bigger so there's even more to street pass with.
And I will say this since we're kind of talking about the Vita versus the 3DS.
The street passing makes a lot more sense than Nier to me right now.
I don't get Nier.
Nier has no rhyme or reason to it.
It's just free shit the app.
Rob?
You click the button.
There's people near you.
Free shit!
Even when people aren't near me, it's like, free shit!
Yeah, I know.
I get it randomly from people on my friends list.
It's nothing useful.
Blackwolf has sent you Katamari.
Free shit!
Yay!
Nothing useful, though.
He's not near me, so why is Blackwolf showing up in near?
I'm getting a ton of unlocks for games I don't have.
No unlocks for games I do have.
They're trying to get you to buy it.
That's the problem.
Anyhow.
Alright, Rama.
Rob, one thing.
Do you remember... Tell me you remember Sesame Street.
No, I don't remember Sesame Street.
Come on, who the fuck doesn't remember Sesame Street?
I'm sorry, when you said near, that's the first thing that came to mind.
Same here.
Well, keep in mind, I listen to that sketch about once a week because I play it for Julian on my phone.
He goes, go over silly.
So tell us about, since you're like the con king, is there any conventions coming up real soon that we should be paying attention to?
Let's see, we have Springfest in Brooklyn coming up next month, followed by Shocker, PAX East, Anime Boston, same weekend, two different convention centers, made a best con win.
Oh, Boston's going to be a crazy town this week.
That's crazy they still do them on the same weekend.
This is the first time something like this has happened.
Wait, I thought that happened last year.
No, no, no, no.
Last year, the cons were a month apart, and the first year, both conventions were a week apart.
Oh, okay.
All right, so they've been inching closer and closer together.
You could say they've been getting nearer and nearer to each other.
This is your old pal, Grover.
And today, I'm going to talk to you about near and far.
In fact, I, Little Furry Grover, am going to show you near and far.
Okay, here goes.
First, this is near.
This is far!
This is Sparta!
This is near.
That's about the point that he starts giggling madly.
I'm waiting for somebody to take that audio and just superimpose pictures of this is near and then this is far would be pictures of the 3G or something.
I don't know.
Somebody think of something funnier and do that.
Ranma, I gotta let you go so we can get more calls.
No problem.
Alright, have a good one.
You too.
Bye.
He sounded like the minute I started playing Sesame Street Clips, he was ready to get off the phone.
What are you trying to say, Ranma?
You don't like Sesame Street Clips?
Quick, favorite Sesame Street sketch.
I would have to say the Count and Cookie Monster cooperating over counting the plate of cookies.
I would say when the shopkeeper died I'm not trying to be morbid but I thought they handled it very tastefully like you know for kids it's a hard thing to explain to kids
Call us now.
The number is 1-877-GAME-OLLR.
We're waiting for your calls.
Yeah, see, I missed this.
The original theme song.
Because the theme song now is fucked up.
I've heard some pretty, like, screwed up... It's... I don't even know what that shit was anymore.
It's weird.
Sesame Street, New Techno House Mix.
Is this like Dubstep?
No.
Sesame Street?
Dubstep is evil.
It's the Rhythm Party version.
Okay.
Is anybody going to call 1877 Game OLR?
I'll keep the Sesame Street clips coming.
Don't fucking make me do it.
Oh, hey, we should go to the Twitter.
Twitter.com slash OLR.
I just want to thank some folks who gave us some shout-outs tonight.
Orange Wright said he's listening to OLR.
Thank you.
And our good buddy Asuka is back tonight.
I saw her in chat a minute ago.
She must have left because it's probably getting late over there.
But I see a celebrity endorsement on her Twitter right there.
Sadly, I've stopped watching the tester.
Oh yeah, after last week, I was like, I guess I'm done.
Although apparently this week was dramas.
Big drama this week.
Like, the internet's favorite person went home this week.
So now it's going to be interesting to see if anybody watches next week.
So they sent home, what's his name?
I didn't want to spoil it, oops.
But yeah, they sent home what's his name.
And they sent home the cute redhead.
Both redheads gone back to back.
It's a shame.
Don't care anymore.
Redheads and popular people are the only reason I tune into shows.
It's time for a girl to win.
But here's the thing.
After kind of talking to Asuka and watching what played out in that second week episode, I don't really want to form my opinions off these people on what I'm seeing on TV.
If I had the time here on OLR, we'd get them all on.
In fact, we should make all ten of them call in and they'll all have to fight each other for airtime or something.
I don't know.
But if I had to go based off what I've seen on the TV, I like the girl with the tattoos.
I think a girl needs to win.
It's time for some girl power.
And I would like to see that girl with the tattoos.
Seems really cool.
So we'll see, I guess.
Not saying, you know, all the boys are bad, but it's just, you know, we had two boys win already.
It's time for a girl to win.
All right.
Going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
Hitstun asks, I wonder if Sky's watching Cross Assault.
I have never in my life heard of that.
What is that?
I've never heard of Cross Assault.
Other Twitter topics.
I think Cross Assault is a fighting game one that has to do with Street Fighter X Tekken.
Oh, good lord.
Wait, it's a reality show?
I don't remember, but it's something that has to do with Street Fighter X Tekken.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Oh, I do have to say, I have updated my portfolio with the stuff I did for Umlaut.
Well, there you go.
You're going to be on Design Star or whatever.
I wish.
I have always said when they do a reality show for who wants to be a game show host, I am fucking there.
I will cut whatever bitch I have to to host my own game show.
And you know what the prize should be is hosting a revival of Press Your Luck done the right way.
Not that whammy shit they did on GSN a couple years ago.
I'm talking old school Press Your Luck, old school set.
Why not?
It's a Facebook game right now.
It's got a lot of people playing it.
So yes, I want to host the new Press Your Luck and I will do a reality competition to do it if I have to.
Just saying.
There are hits on LinkedIn and chat.
Twitch.tv or www.twitch.tv Oh, Capcom Unity.
So it's a Capcom thing.
Yes, it's Namco cross Capcom.
Cross Sega.
Cross Bandai.
I'm sorry, Street Fighter X Tekken because Tekken had bad box art Mega Man and Pac-Man and all sorts of weird shit
Alright, I'm going to give it one more second to see if anyone's going to call.
Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio or 1-877-GAME-OLR You know, I would expect there's less people listening tonight because of the Oscars and all that stuff, but our chat room's hopping, so I'm surprised there's not more people wanting to call, but if y'all are going to be shy, that's fine.
Going to Twitter, Tigerclaw sent me a lot of links, and get this, we talked about all these things on the show.
Tigerclaw, you forgot, Pac-Man on DVD, we talked about that last week.
That's alright, I sometimes forget the shit we talk about on the show too.
So, there you go.
I will say this.
Actdeft sent me a tweet about another victim of Xbox Live hackings because this shit is still going on and yet still no word from Microsoft.
But I find this interesting.
He sent me a screen grab of a forum post.
I don't know what forum this is.
But he sent me this thing.
And what's interesting about this guy is he's saying that they bought 4,000 points on his account.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Whatever had been licensed to it And that made me think about when my Xbox got hacked some time ago Oh my god, I used to buy like every Xbox Live arcade game that was released That person, if they knew to do it, was probably able to get like 80, 90 I'm serious, I had a problem I looked on Xbox Live for a while Since you mentioned it out of curiosity Went to the hackedonexbox.com site again They have 49 unresolved case stories right now
two that have moved from unresolved to resolved so wow you know and here's the thing is that I know 49 doesn't sound like a lot but that's 49 people who know about this website who are in the gaming you know there's tons of people getting hacked we don't even know about like one of my friends from high school was hacked and you know he wouldn't seek out a gaming community to post it he also hadn't played his Xbox in like six months at least
Alright, TigerClaw said, oh, but I want to get one story in, so how about this one?
I said, okay.
So he sent us this tweet, and I guess I'll close with this because our Skype line is either broken or I don't know.
But this topic from Edge Magazine, he tweeted us, Awada throwing shade at Nikkei, Japanese news outlet Nikkei, which we brought up earlier in the show.
He's saying, quote, gossip magazine techniques.
Apparently this is because Nikkei on the website ran a story which said Nintendo is trying to bring back titles like Seaman.
Oh, so apparently it said that Iwata had a quote that said, unless Nintendo changed its ways as a matter of urgency, it would collapse.
And Iwata went to Twitter and said, this is inaccurate, this continues repeatedly, and it's gossip magazine techniques.
Interesting.
Very similar to another thing I was reading on the internet.
You know, Penny Arcade has their new little press site thing, the PA report, right?
It's a neat concept for a site because it really focuses on features and lets other people handle the news, which I think is a smart way to do it just because it's so hard right now to stay on top of the news and all that.
And there's this article on David Jaffe.
Where he got in a verbal confrontation with one of the guys from Kotaku And the guy from PA Report is there and has it on tape What?
David Jaffe getting in a confrontation with somebody?
And throwing colorful languages in the mix?
I don't believe it That has got to be fake He's not a complete douche or anything No, he would never do that
I'm serious, him and fucking Cliffy B need to get in a fucking argument right there.
That I would pay to see.
Dushov, go!
Alright.
Well, the Skype line ain't working, I guess.
I'm getting private messages from people saying they're trying to call and it's not working, so I... IDK what's up.
But Skype not working, that's gotta be a load of crap.
I know, I know.
Alright, well, I got a private message from Jester Scott saying, I can't get through.
I wanted to call and say thank you for the show and keep up the good work.
Oh, that's nice.
Warm fuzzies, warm fuzzies.
Group hug, red velvet cookies for all.
But I guess Skype fail.
And as other people in the chat room are saying, Ranma broke it.
Alright, I'll accept that reasoning.
Ranma broke it.
Thank you, Ranma.
Loki, any last minute stories you want to get out before we say goodnight tonight?
Yeah, I was reading on something because I subscribed to the Dash Hacks Network thing talking about hacking stuff.
Apparently, you know these new system updates that they keep rolling out from Microsoft's Xbox and how they're fixing color correction problems and stuff.
You know when they're patching something that has to do with color correction.
That's not exactly what they're doing.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Their consoles will be unstoppable.
Basically, there's no way to patch this out.
That sounds like they're pulling a Sony.
Unhackable.
No way to patch.
Well, apparently, I don't know what's involved with it, but this new chip will make it impossible for them to patch it out.
Neat.
Alright, if that's it for the last minute stories, then I'm going to go around and get everybody's final thought.
DarkSakura, we'll start with you ladies first.
I shouldn't have eaten so early because I'm freaking hungry.
And like, with my stressful ass day, I ate no lunch, really.
You want another one of those gingerbread pita chips?
Because they're really good.
No.
It actually had a little bit too much bite for me.
Alright.
Loki, your final thought.
My final thought is I really hope that this game of Luminous I'm Playing actually records because the last four of them that I've done, and yes, I did eventually hit quit so that this, you know, it would record my score or something like that, have not recorded and reset each time, so that's kind of annoying.
Okay.
My final thought for tonight is, you know, we've been doing this thing where we talk about video games in the same room without Skype because, you know, Skype clearly doesn't even want to work half the time as you can see tonight.
We've been doing it this way for going on 10 years this June and, you know, not once have we ever asked for any of your money to keep this going and we plan to keep it that way.
You guys being here in chat is enough reward for us and is the motivation we need to keep doing this show every week for free.
Power to the independents, my friends.
However, I would love... You'll take money if people want to give it to you.
But we're not... Contributions from our listeners, not in the financial sense, but in a little short paragraph sent to the mailbag and title it, Oh Well, Our Memories.
Letting me know what you remember of the show.
What's your strongest memory of the show?
All we ever ask, tell a friend about the show.
We do it for free for you guys and to help grow the family and hear from more intelligent gamers like the ones we have in chat every week.
Say something on a forum, tell your friends on Facebook, share a tweet, leave a nice five-star review on a website.
That's all we ask.
Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio and we'll keep doing this.
as long as we can from this office, also known as the kitchen of my place.
Well, you know, you're not really a professional podcaster unless you have an office.
Clearly.
And I love the fancy sets that they took pictures in with, like, the fancy bar and the cocktails.
Nope, nope, nope.
Take the high road.
We're done.
He said cock.
I guess we're incapable of taking the high road.
I am incapable of taking the high road.
Come on.
Hello, my name is Matt.
Have you just met me?
The high road.
But I am serious.
The day I take the high road, that is time to mention that in the wiki.
The high road probably involves hallucinogenics.
I would say, though, I am serious.
I would like to receive emails from our listeners with their favorite OLR memory.
We are coming up on the 10 year anniversary so it would be great.
Yeah, it's necessary.
There is a total love fest going on in chat right now.
Just a less than three shower happening right now.
Love it.
Less than three you guys.
Have a great week.
Don't be a dick.
Be nice to each other.
Do some good and we'll see you next week to do it all again.
Have a great night.
