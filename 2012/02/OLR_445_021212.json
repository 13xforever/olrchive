{"text": " tonight February 12 2012 Blizzard files suit against Valve Mass Effect gets iOS tie-ins galore and could the next Xbox also have a tablet controller? Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice orange lounge radio we are live with the 445th episode of our show for this February the 12th of 2012 that's 2 12 12 alrighty my name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts first off the one the only dark Sakura Jamie Summers derp herp derp herp it's gonna be like this tonight huh how are you doing I'm actually a little sore you're a little sore in the hand oh in the handle region well you've had the rain and I spent the last three days typing a renaming files for the American River review we got we did our art submissions and I submitted five pieces which this is like you know you're you're you are one of the stars of NBC's community in a sense you're going to community college and you're on yearbook right or what this I'll put it this way this makes a yearbook look like a fanzine in comparison I was in your book in high school but I'm doing have your books in high school yes oh by the way over there tech master Loki how are you Loki they have your books in high school yes they did or not high school out of college sure they could they did because my parents met at a Modesto junior college I'll say it and they there was a yearbook yeah of course they have your books in high school I I I was in yearbook at high school because it's okay wait we got to go back to our Sakura story we derailed the magazine basically it showcases all of the art the culinary the fashion that gets put out through American River College and we win lots of big national awards we beat out four year schools we beat out dedicated art schools and we beat Harvard one year and you won the humility award apparently well now I'm just really proud we put a lot of hard work on it and it's something to be proud of fair enough but this is my last year being able to not for art selection but it's my last year that I'm gonna be working on the design team so and no time for games I've played some games someday though someday though you could totally do designing for instruction manuals or you know I was at best I've been applying for those types of jobs well I know I don't know how much I should say it say on air but there's that company just down the road that makes those strategy guides and I was just at Best Buy the other day and I was really admiring there was a collector's strategy guide for Final Fantasy 13 to I'm not usually the type to get strategy guides because you know you can kind of get it all on game facts but I gotta say if you're a really big fan of a game there's just some beautiful art and design in a lot of those books like they're just they're they're good coffee table books for nerds I mean in this one I was looking at with the collector's edition had like that that big thick kind of pillowy cover almost to it I mean it was not your stand lost books I guess I don't know what the technical name is for it but it was like you know it was like the type that if you threw it on the ground it wouldn't leave any marks because it's like push so they those are done with actually I think foam and embossing mm-hmm so yeah I mean the thing is maybe I should save this for my F use but I'll go ahead and say it right now the problem with a lot of places that hire designers is they want you to have a four-year degree and it doesn't matter really how much experience real-life experience you have and just have an associates hmm it's stupid I've got tons of experience and they knew in a four-year degree man I'm like well tell them to reduce the tuition please do you know that I used to do design work before I worked at my current company which I've been at for ten years this is a long time ago when I was 21 22 I work excuse me I worked for a truck drivers magazine and I was just kind of the dude in the office like we all worked at the publishers office it was it was a great staff was a very small office seven people and I was more like I guess you could say kind of an administrative assistant to the publisher sort of but I really did a lot of just different stuff I helped with subscriptions and one role I ended up taking on when one of the gals left I started designing trade ads for the magazine so I mean that's something I didn't I just fell into it it was weird and I'm not like I had yearbook and in high school but let's be real that's I there's a lot more to it that I'm not up and up on but that's just how the way the the market is right now yeah it's it's crazy and I you know I I would have no problem finishing my four-year degree if tuition was not so stupidly high and now you all know a little fact about me yes it's true I used to work for a truck drivers magazine so but it's I don't know if it's still around I think it is but anyway I got laid off because you know not a lot of truck drivers read magazines they all listen to satellite radio but anyhow let's move on video games techmaster Loki how are you these days fine I gotta say this one of the popular games like to play here at olr before we get into the game talk is what did Loki bring to the show tonight and Loki brought with him Jack in the Box and one of the now Jack in the Box they have almost everywhere in the u.s. right but not not in the Northeast I think they don't have it that's weird yeah it's weird they don't have it like cuz I know friends that live up in like Connecticut and stuff and when they come out here they're like we got to go to Jack in the Box oh my god it's kind of like it's kind of like me and Dunkin Donuts cuz we don't have Dunkin Donuts here in California or Krispy Kreme coffee we do have a Krispy Kreme in Roseville yeah they're still yeah there's a Krispy Kreme where somewhere there's one in Stockton too yeah but where's Roseville where in Roseville though cuz I can swing out that way let me Google that for you anyhow Jack in the Box right now they have the bacon milkshakes right now I don't know why I'm giving them free advertising but whatever it's not on their menu probably for good reason well okay I got to say when Loki came in and said I got a bacon milkshake I'm like alright I have to try it that's why I brought it it's like try that was so fucking repulsive I can't oh my god that was terrible I was I didn't hate it and she's the Jewish one it's not real bacon that's right it's just tastes like it just tastes like hickory and vanilla it did taste a little bit like the cheeses that they have out at the mall with the Swiss ladies at Christmastime was that the hickory farms hickory farms at it it did taste a little bit like like smoked vanilla they made a bacon cheddar milkshake that might be pretty good all right you know what though that has inspired me that you know make my own bacon milkshake because this is it's the careful the grease and milk don't hurdle Eric RPG says I want to go to a psycho donuts I've never heard of that I wonder if that's like if you live in Portland there's a great place called voodoo don't you surely you already know at this place it's legendary up there but voodoo donuts which I had when I was up in Portland and that's where you can get the donuts that look like penises and you can also get the bacon maple bars Loki I've seen that on a I know actually no I've seen in that and and no it wasn't that it was a what the hell it man versus food I saw it on there all right video do weddings there to video games I want to want to get into this off the top of the show Loki you sent out a tweet this week you are parting with one of your video game systems what's going on I just don't play my 3ds so I want to get rid of it and really it came down to just I'm was thinking okay Vita or the 3ds you know normally I would get both but I don't play my 3ds that often so I was like okay what titles coming you know soon or this year or that have been announced or potentially would be announced that I would be looking forward to on the 3ds kid Icarus maybe another Mario title or a paper Mario or something like that confirm a 2d Mario right yeah there well there's one learn another 2d Marba I don't really care and then there's like maybe a paper Mario or something like that but it's just it's a few and far between it's you know I picked up Mario Kart and I picked up the Super Mario 3 land and I played a lot of Mario Kart I didn't really play much of Super Mario 3 land but be tween those I hadn't picked up anything says launch I mean it's a good you know nine months span basically between games and and honestly the next thing I'd probably pick up would be kid Icarus which is in March and beyond that yeah I mean this is not a whole lot whereas the Vita I mean they're porting everything to that there's gonna be a Call of Duty on that there's gonna be probably the grand theft next grant the thought it will be on that I would not be surprised and just I think there's a lot more games on there that I would probably play versus my 3ds and be honest I mean the 3ds it's kind of a letdown a little bit because it's just a DS more or less I mean with some 3d graphics that are just kind of like yeah that's kind of neat but would you think about I mean one I see I'm not quite on the same side issue but I'm also in a situation right now where financially I could get the V because I just did taxes and I had a huge tax refund so I could get the Vita without having to part with my 3ds and I can juggle them both I'm not gonna feel like I'm losing something to gain something else but the more I think about it from your perspective if you do sell your 3ds it's not like you couldn't buy one later and they'll probably have the read is the inevitable redesign that includes that second d-pad and we all know there's going to be some redesign in the future I know that's Alan's thing you know he doesn't want to get a 3ds until the end there there will be there's absolutely going to be a redesigned 3ds at some point and and that's not even really a big deal for me either because it's it's just like even the next console generation I was kind of thinking about it and it's like I'm not gonna I don't think I'm gonna buy all three again you know it was kind of cool with the Wii is like oh I got to try that out because you know that is a completely different type of way to play games and the ps3 I honestly wouldn't have picked up at all but I got one for free so you know I'm not gonna complain there and and really I didn't play too much of my I've played a few games on the ps3 but not a whole lot and I still don't I hardly ever use it for blu-rays I use it for streaming movies but I mean I could do that with my Xbox too I play a lot more Xbox but so interesting because I'm the exact opposite ever since the hacking like I don't know what it is but like I don't touch my xbox 360 unless it's specifically for something I can only play on 360 which lately is connect games rhythm party I talked about last week I'm really into I played that like every day this past week but otherwise the multi console stuff has been all ps3 for me like 13 to have been playing on the ps3 you know I just don't know if I will mainly it was before it was going to be that it was money was going to be the issue where I just wanted to be didn't even then I really want to be there I mean but yeah I do because there's actually some games on there that I'd like to try out I'm going to go crazy and buy like a bunch of launch games like I did you know with you know the 3DS crazy there but I mean it's just that's kind of why I'm going that way it's just I don't have a lot of I mean I don't play Kingdom Hearts so because otherwise Kingdom Hearts is probably a big draw for me for the 3ds I guess but you know they don't have a date for that yet it's still some time is here I don't know I just think there's gonna be a lot of stuff that in that system seems like such a step up versus the DS and the 3ds ds and 3ds I mean they're much the same I mean the graphics dsi you know and even the 3ds in some regards is a step backwards I mean I'm still team 3ds I really like my 3ds I'm not gonna part with it but I will say those dsi XL's I mean when Alan got one of those those screens are gigantic I love it like it's that's the best way to play DS games right now I wish the 3ds screens were that big but I guess they have to save that for the reason something I don't know well maybe it's more expensive because of the technology and those screens I don't know it's a 3ds tablet oh wait that's just a Wii U controller oh yeah all right Vida yeah have you gotten your hands on a Vida yet I finally played one yesterday no I have done I played one at GameStop yesterday which I know yes I walked into a GameStop and I didn't instantly turn to ash but in my defense I was at the mall and we were shopping at some other stores and so we were walking right by and I was like oh there's the Vita right there on the wall damn it let's go in and take a look so I did get my hands on the Vita a little bit and I gotta say I first thing I noticed right away damn that screen is big like for a handheld like that you know it's more like regular TV proportions and I was kind of okay that's that's kind of neat like the analog sticks are tiny though that's that was interesting and they're not thank God they're not like that little nub that's on the PSP that would like hurt my thumb after using it for so long like yeah how was that thing they're like little tiny tiny little nubs tiny little PS nipples that you can use to you know for whatever but then it's like I'm standing there like an idiot like how do I start the damn game I can't and then I remembered oh yeah this thing has a touchscreen I have to touch the screen to get it to do anything but I played um oh what is it the mod nation racers and I played wipeout 2048 or whatever the wipeout game is it's on the Vita and yeah I mean it's it's gorgeous looking the graphics you know when they say it looks like a PlayStation 3 yeah I can kind of see that I mean you know again it's it's a little bit of bait-and-switch because yeah it's really high resolution but on a lower resolution monitor but for handhelds it is it is pretty gorgeous looking I'm still kind of on the fence on if I want one or not and funny enough it's it's kind of what's troubling Loki and that is the games but Loki I got to say you do make a good point most of the big franchises will probably inevitably come over at some point I know I want that Final Fantasy 10 thing that they're gonna do down the line I absolutely like if I were to buy the Vita at launch I'm getting that luminous game absolutely hasn't yet but song list and everything and you know I always have this fanboy boner for Q entertainment you know it was speaking it just I didn't decide I was kind of ironic and funny Ridge racers no longer a launch title I wonder if it didn't sell very well at all in Japan and they went back to fix it and add tracks let's hope but didn't Ninja Gaiden get bumped up like there was kind of a no it's just that the news is too they're they're behind in getting release dates and stuff like that so it's been launched for a while it does kind of concern me a little bit too that there's a lot about the Vita that's still kind of a question mark even though the damn things out in Japan and there's a lot of stuff that ought to be there that's not and I gotta admit one of the things I know a lot of people are like well if you want to just go play your PSP or go hook up your PlayStation 1 the ps1 games not playing on the PlayStation Vita I mean why not I don't understand why that doesn't work if that thing is supposed to be as powerful as a PlayStation 3 why can't it successfully emulate the PlayStation 1 games I'm sure there's a highly technical answer but from a consumer standpoint I'm like damn it I bought like Final Fantasy I would like to play that I've got the emulator to work because they still have full backwards compatibility with the PlayStation portable stuff and they are working on that right it's me when Sony's like implementing all these features as they go but then there's a part of you that watches what happened with Microsoft because remember when the Xbox first came out it was like these handful of titles will be emulatable from the original Xbox and they slowly added more and more to that list and they said we're not gonna stop till they're all emulatable and they stopped about a year you're into it and you still can't play the old DDR ultimate games on 360 at the same time at least they're not shipping that system saying oh hey look internet browser Oh internet browser coming in the future you know patch what yeah I guess okay Nintendo's guilty of the same thing hey look you're right I want to buy a game oops sorry store coming in a future patch all right here I always the second analog see you know that March release day for whatever reason or April what what the hell month did it come out March March all right they sure were married to that date oh yeah the because of the quarter quarter earnings are you're yeah so I mean I get maybe it's the same thing with Sony I mean yeah it's February but it's you know still maybe that's part of the reason why they got to get it out now oh well I'm sure I'll end up getting one inevitably because I really do want that luminous game I really want it and then when the Final Fantasy 10 thing comes out I'm gonna be like I want that too so well and just looking at like some of the other stuff like little big planet on it I'm not you know I don't play enough of little big planet on the ps3 but just showing how easy it is to make stuff using that touchscreen just like okay I want to make a hill and I want to adjust it oh and I'm gonna pinch it to make it a little bit smaller and I'm gonna rotate it and I'm just gonna poke at this stuff and everything works perfectly fine it I mean it's awesome it's just so easy to make stuff with so I'm kind of looking for that spin-offs that they're gonna have let's go to our chat room we always love to be joined by the chat room chat that orange lounge radio calm some comments in the chat room let's see a suka and our chat room says Vita is worthwhile at launch only if you don't own a PSP see I do oh yeah I do own a PSP yet I'm still kind of like and what of one is the other thing too though and I don't know if you've done this yet you remember back when they gave you those free PlayStation Network games and the free PSP games as part of the reparations for you know the network being down for a while I haven't used those PSP games so I actually have ModNation racers waiting for me as soon as I you know get my Vita more comments in our chat room at chat.org.com ahamkara says no HDMI port on the Vita well that's kind of ass what if you want to play your Vita stuff on the TV who cares me I like cooking up the PSP to the TV yeah but who cares you know why because first off who's to say that you're not going to be able to stream that stuff from your Vita to your TV in the first place and whoever fucking uses stupid cable so you actually use the cables hook up to your TV you like being tethered six feet away from your TV was that fun I mean because I actually okay hold on hold on smarty pants when I'm in the bedroom on the TV in there and I'm kind of lying on the bed that six-foot tether is just enough where yes I can lie in bed and play Final Fantasy 4 and have a fat day where I am fat and I am playing PSP in bed on my TV I mean the only one that was actually that would make sense doing that would have been like the PSP go where it actually had you know DualShock 3 Bluetooth support which hey there you go Bluetooth support you know you could maybe do something like that later on but I don't care I've got a big screen in front of me why do I need to hook it up to my TV to have some weird resolution on there I just don't need that if I want to play on my TV I'll use my PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 spazz nator in our chat room says I don't want to get a Vita due to the shit I've gone through with my PlayStation 3 and my digital downloaded videos you know history can burn you and I you know I know spazz nators called into the show before to talk about his his trials and tribulations and I gotta say yeah I can see where he's coming from because it's it's me and Microsoft right now I feel very apprehensive with like I don't want to buy things on Xbox because my wallet will be you know stolen from yet again I'm feeling a little weird about all that stuff whereas I'm sure some people are like Rob you're irrational I don't buy a lot of digital content so it doesn't matter to me I mean especially since they're like hey you get 10% off maybe that's if we decide to discount it because uncharted it's not fucking discounted or at least it wasn't it might be discounted now but still 10% all right let's uh let's move on so Vida so Vida yes for you launch day um hopefully Vida is strong like leaning towards yes but I'm really gonna wait for that first week release thing that's Valentine's Day or whatever and see what the feedback is on that dark soccer I'm pretty sure you said you're a no just due to personal situations but any interest in Vita I want an iPad just wait for an iPad three or whatever they're gonna announce one at the beginning that's true yeah iPad 3 will be all HD and pretty I want one of those two honestly I don't really give a shit about the Vida anymore why is that I mean it would be nice to have one and I'm sure Dan wants to get one yeah are you psyching yourself out of your like I don't want a Vida Vida's are shit because I can't afford it no you know I'm saying I'm saying this I really I'm still playing games on my DS and I can't play for very long before I start to hurt so it's sort of like I play with anything that I want to on my phone I only have to use my thumbs and bust to move is all I need bust to move is all I need all right fair enough let's move on we're gonna talk about our gaming weeks and the video games that we've been playing this week of course you can always join us in the chat room to chat along with us chat orange launch radio.com live on this Sunday evening February the 12th of 2012 if you're listening on the podcast hey just a reminder we do tape live every Sunday night right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at all games radio www.all games calm and a big thanks of course to the chatters for coming out as always it's it what did I say fucking last week when we were up against the Super Bowl we are always against some damn national event on TV on Sunday nights and tonight it's the Grammys but Adele's gonna win everything every star that gets on the stage is gonna say something about Whitney Houston and that'll be pretty much it I don't think I miss much any good performances will be on YouTube so there you go now you can listen to us it'll be more spontaneous let's talk about our gaming weeks dark soccer we'll start with you what types of video games you've been playing this week best to move on my phone which I'm trying to go back through and get all the medals now which I think I have most of them so I can get like the proper ending of the game and I'm play well addict dealer what's new with you in the world of Warcraft what are you been like your goals lately holo dailies that's pretty much it I want pink flamingo it's running around I go look at my pink flamingo and I'm playing my troll who cries in size all the time and I have another horrid tune on Ravencrest to play with other people good times but by the way Rob I did get the name today for the death night alright be Whitney for you so just letting you know I I believe grandpa war crafter as he goes by in our chat room salvellous would be proud because he had what he had our IP Steve Jobs I have our IP Betty white just waiting and I think he rolled he rolled another one when somebody passed away recently I remember who was I'm actually because my one that's on the main server I'm gonna be I'm learning how to tank on that one but this one other ones just gonna be a DPS for lol so I can go in and go haha I begin some emails about a Star Trek online and how they've added some new stuff and have really kind of got behind the free-to-play stuff you've been able to check that out since when FTP um well I haven't checked out the very new stuff I've seen some they they have a really a lot easier way now to get some of the different costumes and goodies and if you've got the cryptic points for it you actually just will select it on the menu with all the rest of everything like if you're changing your outfit and you want a certain piece of an outfit you can just select that piece and pay your points then so I'm probably gonna be getting some cryptic points in the next couple of weeks and really giving it a go because I miss playing with my Scottish buddies but I still love us yo I went around and they fixed a bunch of stuff on DS DS 9 Oh Deep Space 9 is in the game you can actually now go in the office it's been in the game you did there were just parts that were closed off now you can actually go you know in the commander's office and the baseball is sitting there Cisco's baseball because you know he is awesome tastic all right so I've had school and all this other stuff on my plate so I still haven't sent out the game so sorry and we were gonna pick up our lazy I know busy we're gonna pick up our duo today but we just didn't get by there we had we were gonna go by Dan's mom's house but she had to go somewhere else so we didn't get a chance to all right let's go to Loki tech master Loki how was your gaming week I didn't play much I was writing for tutorials this weekend I played very little bit of Skyrim I remember what I did in there but something in Skyrim related I think it was oh yeah I checked out patch 1 4 which sadly to say even though it promised to fix the quest it did not fix the quest I think the quest is too dead for me did they push out the console finally yes it's a console now it was supposed to fix the fire on the ice bro no not firing yes blood on the ice quest and I didn't none of mine it's impossible so me whatever um let's see then some other miscellaneous quests I did I also played the cat that got the milk which was the free game I was talking about the cat that got the milk calm and it's this weird it's like a puzzle game and it gets all kind of artsy and it gets pretty hard actually so it's fun for like a few minutes that's about how long the game is and called you played more Call of Duty and I'm starting to try to teach myself now pronating which is throwing grenades in really specific ways to get them to bounce off shit and hit people very far away from you that's pretty much the only area I could improve upon right now I'm really frustrated how that my co-workers they they really don't like playing with me you're just too good because I because because I will purposefully run up behind them and stab them I have the opportunity that's not a nice or they'll be or they'll be or they'll be standing there or something like that I'm like and I'll sit behind them I'm like okay what's something funny that I could do to kill them hmm something funny so like one of my co-workers is prone under this truck like trying to snipe at people so I went prone to and I crawled up right behind them and they started seeing my gun in their screen because you know I had clipped past their camera no like what is that and then they turned and that shot him in the face god damn it you're sitting there the whole time just kill me I'm so hateful that at your work you can do this like you always just it sounds like you work at a frat house for God's no it's just our 15-minute games we get to 15 minutes and then they ask you know what I do on my 15-minute breaks like a walk yeah I could do that but now where's the fun in that exactly walking for nerds Call of Duty is where it's at well they the whole thing with Call of Duty was we hate getting our asses kicked in Grand Theft Auto we're gonna play Call of Duty because he's probably not good at that so humble so humble I hey I didn't know I was gonna be good at it because honestly I played Call of Duty for once before I'd actually played with them and so I was kind of at the same spot that they were in fact I believe that my boss at least had Call of Duty 4 already and he's been playing online for like a while now so that's why he thought he had the advantage but apparently I'm really good at that game I also read up on everything it's it's good to be educated in what you're playing all right anything else for your gaming week that's it all right my gaming week I get pretty short because I didn't play a lot of new stuff I've been playing when I'm not playing World of Warcraft just like Dark Sakura Final Fantasy 13 to haters stay pressed step off it's great I'm loving Final Fantasy 13 to it's it's so I it's it's such a different story than the last one and kind of the way they they they split it up it's really it's really interesting that you go into one time and then you can go into a parallel timeline that's the same thing with a different result it's interesting and I have to correct one little thing I said in my review last week and that is that you actually do get more than the two characters in your party but they're not really controllable like it's kind of like this extra characters just standing off to the side and kind of fighting with me although I don't really watch their hit points or anything but I just didn't want to be you know corrected in my review last week because I played a lot further into it now I did check out some of the DLC you can download right now the lightning and oh her her guy in charge of the squadron dude I can't remember his name you can play against them and I guess if you're able to beat them you can use lightning as your summon summonable monster in battle but I can't beat them yet because I'm too low a level as I guess I haven't played far enough so I'm still working away at it I finally got to the casino in Final Fantasy 13 too so it was you know kind of fun to see some of the minigames they're bringing back chocobo racing I heard that the case if was in the game as a suitable well it but it's not it's not the Kate Sith it's not the guy in the big moogle that you remember from Final Fantasy 7 but it's a monster called Kate Sith in fact it's probably the first monster that you'll get and probably hang on to hang on to for a long time because it's a healer and it's one of the few healer monsters you get and plus is a kitty and in the little special attack he goes wow and then eats claw claw claw claw claw it's really funny so yeah I'm liking Final Fantasy 13 too and I'm definitely gonna play this to completion that's pretty much where all my gaming hours have gone when I'm not playing Wow or something else I will say I randomly had an urge to play bit trip runner yesterday and try to get further in that game that's the one you know it plays like the chip yeah I know it's hard as hell it's like an older game it's on Steam it's where I play it on PC I think maybe I played cannibal this week cuz I remember yeah don't start Skyrim you'll never finish it um let's see I'm looking in our chat room at chat orange launch rated calm hey Stan Stan says me too loves Final Fantasy 13 to the use of enemies is the third character reminds me of Pokemon mixed with dog fights it's an interesting way to think of that jester Scott says by the way you need lightning I would love to get lightning but I can't beat beat her yet Eric RPG says actually sky it's a 10% drop even at 5 star oh my god I was able to beat lightning and tell her little buddy joined in the fight and then I got wasted so I just I just need to level further and grind and all that those of you that missed grinding in Final Fantasy those of you that bitched about Final Fantasy 13 it's too linear and there's no grinding it's too easy well guess what you got your wish prayers answered enjoy grind grind grind away otherwise gaming a little bit Mario Kart 7 that's really it so let's move on and talk about some housekeeping tonight we actually have some really big news in housekeeping tonight we didn't want to promote this a little bit because not everybody's gonna see this is good news I wish dark soccer was in the room but she's in the restroom right now but that's alright we'll we'll move on anyway she can say her piece afterwards if she needs to but it's it's pretty straightforward this is more of a programming note and it's gonna be kind of a shift in in orange lounge radio it is not going to affect anybody that listens to the podcast at all but it will affect the live listeners the announcement is that we are going to be ending the orange launch radio after birth and it's gonna be ending next week next week will be the final after birth that we're gonna do and it's gonna involve the ultimate cage match and we'll tell you more about that next week why we're doing it I think part of us kind of creatively the the after birth which which if you only are a podcast listener you don't know what it is the orange on radio after birth it's kind of like after we tape the show live for about 20 minutes afterwards we'll usually just kind of sit around and chat and then we do this segment called the cage match where we play three songs and it's more of a indulgence for the live listeners and we do this fortune cookie message of the day and all this stuff and the cage match is a segment that dates back to episode 20 of this program so we're on episode 445 and the cage match dates back to episode 20 so it's it's very old segment and it's something we kind of wanted to keep even after we made the shift to all games radio some years ago but creatively unfortunately I think the after birth has lost a lot of steam those of us here that hosts the show kind of feel like we got a we got to get our cage match song we're stuck in the studio for another 20 minutes and you know it's kind of it's kind of become this necessary thing we have to do every week so and you know when creatively something's not working you say okay we're gonna change it so that's what we're gonna do we're gonna change it so we've decided to and the orange ones radio after birth and next week we are gonna be saying goodbye to the cage match which has been a part of our show for the past 425 weeks give or take a few so you know I realize our live listeners may see this as oh well you don't care about your live audience anymore hey that no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no it's not about that at all think of it this way by doing that and ending the cage match it opens the door for other possibilities and things we could better spend our time with once this show is over more information on that in the coming weeks but for now we hope our live listeners will understand this creative decision and this longtime segment of our show that you know podcast listeners weren't even hearing anyway so all right Kai's you know in chat says I'm gonna read these Kai's you know in chat says just saying you guys are getting lazy after birth is good times I think that comments a little bit unfair because you know it's not a lazy thing to be doing a show for the past 10 years every week but I think too you have to wait to see what the future holds I think we'll prove you wrong hit stun says I think we need an official post show turntable FM party I'd be in support of that I I have not logged on to turntable in quite some time and I love the iPhone app and all that and I am totally in support of that ahamkara in chat says play games after the show and stream it I've been thinking about that as like a side project the whole twitch TV thing and all that good times all right anyone want to chime in on this whole thing I think I said my piece in the chat room but I'll say it aloud fuck you we do this for free we do this as a service and we keep trying to think of new things to make things even better so if we're getting rid of something we're doing it for a very good reason not just because we don't feel like doing it so fuck off but I can see well that's a strong reaction but I can see where the strong reaction comes from in chat too is that you know we've been doing this so long and then we're saying goodbye to it and it's like but wait why that's well that's my initial reaction to uh just an accusation of overt laziness no yeah and on top of that I mean Rob has a full-time job Loki has a full-time job I go to school you know we give up our Sundays for you guys so there's nothing I think wrong at all for us you know trying to think of something new some way to innovate because nothing ever grows without a challenge and without making small changes to it to make it grow so so just but there are no there are some people in our chat that are like Brad from pop culture says understandable and let's see Tiger Claw says so there won't be a post show of any kind I didn't say that let's see active says nobody but one person is complaining so you know I think I think for the most part people get it that creatively sometimes you we don't not ending the show we're not ending the show so don't know about that and there is there is something else coming yeah so just deal with it all right I mean to be honest we don't have to do the show I mean really but we do in the show we like doing the show in the show it free up a lot of Skyrim time you know I've got design work that I'm being paid for that I could be doing tonight but you know what I'm here doing the show all right no worries guys all right let's move on and talk about something a little more in gaming and we're gonna start with Loki with the video game news Loki so we were talking a little bit about the Vita one of the things that they offered in Japan was this cool UMD passport service basically if you owned a PSP and some PSP games like UMD games and you downloaded this application or whatever from the PlayStation Network that allowed you to kind of mark the games that you had so then you could download them for a discount off of the PlayStation Network store and be able to download them onto your Vita so it's not a way to port your games for free from UMD but just a way to kind of offer you a discount or an incentive to do that well that didn't just they just decided hey you know what that's a cool service we're not bringing it over to the United States or North America or Canada or anybody we're just meh you're not gonna have it same with Europe Europe's not getting it either so unfortunately that wonderful service they don't care I think they think that we're gonna abuse it because we're you know the type of people to abuse that kind of thing renting games or whatever I don't know how big rental is over in Japan but I guess it's possible to be honest so not really anyone rents PSP games so oh it's a little disappointing I guess it's disappointing it's you know there's gonna be those people that are like but if you want to play a PSP game then you go get your PSP but well then don't offer the service in Japan and not in other territories there yeah there's that too um and then I'm also like you guys are forgetting that that PSP didn't have digital distribution in the beginning so those of us that were early adopters the PC or at least I'm almost positive it didn't right it didn't for so you know longer than a year yeah it was a while and like there was a lot of games I bought when the PSP first came out like luminous which you know of course I'm always gonna go back to that cuz what probably the greatest puzzle game to come out in a long time and yeah I'd like to be able to have that on my PS Vita but granted the pain is numbed significantly when you consider there's an all-new luminous game coming out so it's gonna with some sounds well yeah I probably won't need the old one as badly as I thought I did but okay what about Final Fantasy 4 the the collection on the complete is great it's the original game and it's it's that PSP graphics which are great and you couldn't download that on the marketplace at first so of course I bought it on UMD and it's like oh damn I'd really love to be able to have that on the Vita but I guess not so I want to buy it again so they guarantee we'll go for the market value that it is right now exactly like you know Final Fantasy 1 & 2 those are pretty awesome games I mean they're like $9 retail now but they're probably gonna be like 15 bucks on the PlayStation that's yeah that's that's kind of a bummer because now the PlayStation Network kind of controls all that and you know hopefully they'll learn something from steam about the deep discounting or maybe the whole PlayStation Plus will throw in I think they already do right don't you get some of those PlayStation do you get full PSP games free I know you get some PSN Network games I don't think PlayStation PlayStation Plus is only on the PlayStation 3 it's not a play oh it'll be it's a Vita thing you're gonna be able to get the discounts on Vita I don't think I don't DLC certainly will be discounted some of it so all right anyhow anything else on the UMD passport system and all that good stuff there's ever a chance there'll be a drive no there won't no they're not gonna make a drive and I don't think they should I mean it's it's ridiculous you don't need to make a UMD drive for a PSP although they did that with the PlayStation 2 memory cards remember they have the memory card adapter that you can now do that before they you know allowed you to use saves one thing that does kind of suck though is the backwards compatibility games Grantha thought it was not one of the games is backwards compatible that is so disappointing but ah but but I hope that that's because that they're gonna go and fix the camera because before there was no camera option it was one analog stick it was very difficult to play but I hope they go back and fix that maybe some HD versions I'd be fine of that I can wait I remember what it was I was gonna say earlier I got distracted by chat for a little bit but I remember what I was gonna say earlier about UMDs notice how in the complaining and the talking and all this stuff no one is talking about the movies remember UMD movies no no one's feeling short change that the movies are not gonna be playable or any of that stuff granted same thing they'll playstation network certainly has its share of movies that they want you to buy download all that well here's a thought how nice your movie's gonna look like on that screen because they already look pretty because they have a lot of digital downloads especially almost all the movies nowadays that come out like on the blu-ray combo packs or whatever they have hey you can download digital copy of the movie it's not bad isn't that all I always thought that was restricted to the iPhone or no no it's usually it's usually iPhone they use that Sony specially had the PSP ones but I think a lot of that they mean mp4s kind of play on everything and they that's the format they usually use I did not think about that so if I haven't cashed in my Tron digital Tron why is the name escaping me right now the new one Tron legacy thank you if I haven't cashed in my Tron legacy digital copy down the back of it because usually it'll say PC you know PC iPod that kind of stuff and you may be able to convert it if because a lot of the portable devices I mean Android phones and so that they don't play you know the iPod stuff let's see I'm so glad we do the show in the house Tron legacy digital copy of future feature film watch it anytime anywhere on your computer and portable device works with iTunes works with Windows Media Player I don't know you might be able to convert it somehow but I mean there's a lot of stuff that you know supports that that's true well Randy said F that UMDs it's all about GBA movie play our carts oh my gosh remember those at e3 yes I do still coming to for the 3ds apparently whatever happened to 3d movies on the 3ds that was a big thing they showed at e3 I'm glad you mentioned that next week shut up really yeah okay there's been like no press about it what 3ds movies just come out next it's not a movie it's a game but it has the movie on it Tekken Tekken Prime or Tekken 3d Prime Edition has the full Tekken animated movie on there in 3d that's weird that's kind of cool though yeah it's just like and the good one too not the crappy live-action Tekken movie hmm so that'll be something for next week that's pretty cool well I just remember at e3 a couple years ago when we first saw the 3ds one of the big things I remember seeing was the tangled trailer because that movie wouldn't out yet and it was on the 3ds and I was like wow this is gonna be a great babysitter system that you know kids and I'm and of course my mind I'm like I want Tron on this thing yeah now haha now you're thinking about that 3ds no I'm still not thinking about the 3ds I have Tron I'm five you have the uber Tron with you know the original Tron on blue-gray and stuff but I don't need three it 3d is cool in a theater 3d is cool maybe on my TV although I don't have a 3d TV so I can't really speak for that I actually have seen our lobby TV has a it's a 3d TV and that was alright but I don't need it 3d on the road I don't need to watch the movie in 3d I mean it adds a little bit it's a little bit more immersive but it's not like oh my god night and day so I'm fine without 3d that's why I like a lot of these 3d games I mean it's cool that the 3ds in there like for the 3ds but I don't necessarily need it it doesn't add like a ton of extra gameplay whereas you know that second analog stick does help quite a bit just saying you know if I were the choose hey guess what we can make a system with a second analog stick we're going to have 3d graphics yeah I'd rather play with the second analog stick because that would be pretty useful all right going to our chat room black will says about the Tron digital card says check to see when it expires they expire after a few months great so I might be screwed it's usually about a year and it's been about a year yeah Brad from pot culture says fuck just torrent the movies well if I'm not able to get my digital distribution that I bought fair and or a digital copy that I bought fair and square I just might have to it is stupid that they expire that is kind of dumb that it expires is that a whole is that like to prevent use bonuses I don't what is the point of that it's them being assholes black will says I can't wait for netflix to have 3d movies so I can actually see them in 3d I mean wouldn't mind a 3d netflix after everything netflix has gone through this past year I think a 3d version would be welcomed alright let's move on with some more news we heard that Verizon is teaming up with I did did you also hear that Disney is implementing the rental window I saw that on your Twitter explain that quickly before we go on the next story what is the rental window so to speak the rental window is basically that they limit all distributors from selling copies to rental customers so blockbuster red box whomever cannot buy copies for rent this is to prevent people it doesn't prevent people because the first sale doctrine you can't prevent people from renting movies out but it's basically to prevent them from having the movie on release date so the people have to go so people go into you know their local video store ago all sad face my neutron movies and I hear I better go buy it brand new instead of you're renting it and so they go out will be not trying to try and you should buy when it comes out but no like okay they don't have ours needs moms all they don't have you know Mars needs moms to mom harder so I guess electric mama Lou so I guess I gotta go buy it brand new so my kid can watch this so and and of course you know the idiots that you make these decisions higher up hey look when we did that look our our sell-through sales have just spiked they're just going through there yeah because everybody's going to retail buying copies and bring it back to the rental store so yes that is going to increase the amount of sales you have in your sell-through copies oh but you forgot all the other copies that you were selling for rental that aren't there anymore so it actually evens out or is less but still that's the decision that they make that's also the decision that Warner made a while back in there now a 60-day rental window I think and that's because they hate people that rent movies all right ahamkara in our chat room says most of the Nintendo channel 3d isn't good you could turn it off and it's no different looking you know that's kind of true like there's a have you ever Loki have you ever watched some of the stuff on the Nintendo download stuff yeah there's some really bad sketch comedy and some stuff on there this is I watch the animated shorts or I used to have it you saw automatically downloaded I was like stop stop I don't I don't want to watch this all right look we got it we we're like 50 minutes into the show we don't one story so let's move on this is a big deal because this is to gain companies people really love me I love both these companies and isn't it rough when you see people you love fighting isn't that hard to watch well that's what's happening now and it's it's a court battle blizzard filed a notice of opposition with the u.s. patent and trademark office what they're trying to do they're trying to block valve from using the term dota now for those that don't know dota defense of the ancients long time ago was a Warcraft 3 mod that was super freaking popular to the extent that it went on to spawn just all these kind of I don't want to say clone games but other types of games in that same vein League of Legends being the huge example of that now what's interesting about dota is that because it was a Warcraft III thing how did it work like there were two guys there was one guy that started dota one guy that continued dota I think that I could guys I so apologize if I'm fucking this up but it's like a soap opera storyline okay I think the guy that continued dota went to go do League of Legends the guy that started dota got hired by valve because that's what valve does they see things out there in the community they hire that's that's where portal came from right the whole nevacular drop yeah hired those guys so valve does that so now valve has dota 2 coming out blizzard because defense of the ancients was a Warcraft 3 mod they're doing their own thing blizzard dota for Starcraft 2 that's coming out at some point most people seem to think it's gonna launch with heart of the swarm or it's gonna require heart of the swarm to give the next Starcraft 2 expansion kind of something that everybody's gonna really want well we've known that this has been the case for almost a year and a half or two years but blizzard is now decided now that dota 2 is in beta testing to take issue which I can kind of you know if you really want to kick them where it counts do it after the games already in beta testing so from that strategical standpoint I assume I can see that but a blizzards case quote by virtue of that use the dota mark has been firmly associated in the mind of consumers with blizzard including to signify a highly popular scenario or variant of one of blizzard best-selling computer games Warcraft 3 a lot of fans are up in arms about this because they're saying blizzard you didn't make the mod yeah and I honestly never heard of the term until a couple days ago but you don't really follow these types of games either to be fair I don't see who wait I'm the lore nerd for Warcraft hold on one sec Matt the dark soccer in your mind go back three days who did you think own dota I was honestly I was I kind of glanced at it and didn't care okay that thought didn't come to your mind fair enough tiger claw on our charm says blizzards version is D OTA with the periods while valve went around that by just calling it dota 2 apparently that wasn't good enough for blizzard valve blizzard doesn't own the I can it was created for one of their games and I can see the whole Association legally I don't know what standing they have I mean I gotta admit legal but I'm not a lawyer also I'm just a sick fanboy the only way legally that blizzard can stand on it is if they had filed a trademark on it also valves game isn't dota it's dota 2 I mean if I want to have a superb owl party can I get away with that are we talking about this last week all right anyhow well and this to me this almost reminds me of monster like monster cable suing monster mini golf because as the word monster in it oh yeah or like I think monster energy drinks does the same thing or they suit monster energy drink I'm sorry but just because a mod was used on your game doesn't mean you have the rights to that and that doesn't work it doesn't work that way unless they use some mod tools that you provided them I don't see how they have the you don't have the rights to that unless they gave you the rights what is this that our pal Bobby black wolf is sending me right now he says this is the link to the dota song by bass hunter you should play this for shits and giggles what is this did end on a job dog on a seat that I haven't a low spell I don't thought we see the heart event and spare money they don't stop I visit the heart event and spare money they don't stop a few lawsuits off dance party instead can we just dance our problems out somebody should sue this guy for being addicting all right that same fucking melodies in like 50 goddamn songs I've heard come out of various European territories moving I'm suing them for that melody damn it dark Sakura save us from dance party I like to move it move it how about some steam stuff speaking of valve yes well you know that whole business with the steam hack it looks like they might have gotten some information for transactions after all that happened between 2004 and 2008 so no incur basically that was announced by Gabe Newell he said that the file had usernames and email addresses and encrypted billing addresses and credit card information but no passwords so I guess maybe your expired card might be in trouble change your passwords anyway and to be perfectly honest it just said he's he suggests using steam guard keep it on and my suggestion is don't put your fucking credit card on steam I use PayPal for a reason the end but it's so easy when you give them your credit card information I'll admit steam has my credit card information so I'm a little nervous but also that credit card expires very soon so yeah and honestly like my last credit card expiration date was like 2010 yeah that's true I mean if they got information from 2008 whatever credit card I was using then long since expired yeah so I mean as long as they can't see what porn I bought on other websites between that time it never hurts to be careful but don't panic in other words hey I like though that they're being very upfront about it I mean the whole steam is awesome situation really sucks but you know I've come to learn that the hacking is one thing and you know PlayStation got hacked and Sony or Sony PlayStation got hacked and then valve got hacked and you know other websites but then the information actually being misused to steal money is another and that's Xbox which totally denies that there has been a hacking of any sort so when choosing between this or this I'd rather go with welp the information was hacked I know that sounds really weird but think about it also use a different password on every website that's really the best practice you have to use a different password on every website you do and it's the only way to keep your information choice a for the love of God your bank account password better be unique please tell me your bank account password is unique and really your email password should be unique too because to reset your password on any other website it usually goes back to your email address so if any thing is going to have unique passwords your banking and your email needs to have unique passwords right and don't have any of your password saved yes and don't name passwords after your kitty and don't be like who was it the president of Syria or whatever they had their password one two three four five don't really that's the same multiple people don't please don't do that but that's the password an idiot would put on his luggage alright moving on Loki so there's a big Kickstarter project featuring double fine they decided to go ahead and put it this project on a Kickstarter to raise money for a classic point-and-click adventure game using modern technology or modern touch technology and it's broken all sorts of records they made their forty thousand or four hundred thousand dollars in less than 24 hours that was the original amount that they were looking to raise and it's already well over a million dollars I believe 1.6 million as of today and they've still got like 30 days to go on this it's just ridiculous it broke you know the records on your Kickstarter and of course they're making quite a bit money off that 5% cut they get kind of nice Kickstarter gets 5% they get 5% oh my gosh hey they got a run they got a run their company yeah I know but I'm just like do people know that 5% of their money goes to I guess they have to when they click accept whether they read it or not yeah so yeah and so obviously this game will be made there's lots of sorry I'm laughing because now I'm thinking about that report I saw on CNN where the people at Kickstarter were watching this double fine thing happening on the televisions and they were like all around and they busted out champagne when it passed the million dollar mark and like oh now I get why cuz they just made two hundred thousand dollars in one fucking day or excuse me twenty thousand dollars it's still really good yeah they've got 29 days to go and I mean you can still if you want to pledge money for this and there's no reason I mean I can't fucking do math 50,000 yeah there's you know you can still pledge money if you want to and they've got you know all the upper tier stuff sold out someone actually pledged $10,000 or more to this there's ten people that pledge $5,000 100 to pledge over $1,000 900 that pledges over 250 this is ridiculous but there's still the bottom tier stuff if you pledge $15 you get a copy of the game and access to the beta and steam as well as access to the video series and private discussion community $30 or more you get HD download of the documentary series with extras digital game soundtrack and all the other stuff before that and then 100 bucks you get the original double fine adventure poster an exclusive campaign special thanks in the games credits and all the previous stuff so you should well check out Kickstarter period cuz they need a lot of neat stuff on there not necessarily just video game stuff but like they had it one time and I almost considered doing it like you could buy a set of Catan tiles that were like etched laser etched on wood nice nice that they're really fucking expensive but uh oh my my favorite one which I've got a I can't remember it's a card game it's just very inappropriate that's I can remember now dark to see you in our time says last I heard they were almost gonna break 2 million 1.6 million when I looked earlier is where they're at now yeah yeah so that fair chunk of money this just in by the way orange launch radio is starting a Kickstarter if you want to save the afterbirth segment I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm kidding but seriously now I'm like what could we give away and we can honestly do that I mean no card against humanity not in it for the money remember guys are not enough for the money cards against humanity is the thing that was a Kickstarter project that it's basically this card game that's really bad it's it's not appropriate for most ages um did you donate to this or did you think about donating this why not I mean I didn't either but we were talking about this with Bobby on his show earlier before we started tonight and he did and so we were kind of talking about the last thing I donated money for was that humble bundle and I've played one of the games out of that I'm not gonna buy another digital game that I'm not gonna fucking play so I do play the games in the humble indie bundle yeah that was a great deal I've played only one of them I still have all the other like but you did good for charity this has nothing to do with charity I understand nothing to do with charity remember that I understand that and and that's the other thing too it's raised money faster than Child's Play did think about it Child's Play did not raise a million dollars in it well I take that back they may have at some point but over the course of three months they raised three million well it was great if I Child's Play then comes up with some cool perks you know to give away and I know the guys behind penny arcade probably could come up with some cool perks and then put a Kickstarter page up I'm sure they can get quite a bit of tension and get money raised that way and I think it's a cool idea crowdsourcing is kind of neat and you know I could think of some ways we could utilize that but it's just I don't know like if we like they had another game there was another one it was by the guys that did I want to say the Tony Hawk game or something like that like one of the Tony Hawk games or something and they were raising money for this really terrible looking Kinect Xbox Live arcade game where you bounce your characters around like some Steve Pachinko looking machine and it was just terrible but they love pitching but they're raising money for that and it's like so you're gonna raise money for this and then you're gonna put on Xbox Live arcade and make more money because you're not investing really any of your money because it's you're making all the money it must be nice I mean hell if I was motivated enough to program games and stuff and I could make a convincing Kickstarter that would be cool hey look I got all my seed money now I'm gonna make some money and all I have to do is provide some people some free codes or some extra tchotchkes then that's it here's my honest concern and I think this is a legitimate concern to have what if the game's bad I mean I realize the whole community is gonna be participating and in talking about this on the forums and you know watching the development and that part's really cool I got to give props to somebody that's willing to lift the curtain a little bit there and show you what's back there but I'm also a little bit like you know some sometimes community isn't always right in their decisions you know sometimes the hardcore gamers alienate the casual gamers and I talked about World of Warcraft did that a little bit with that's the same with like a pre-order though I mean you put money down for a pre-order and you get the game and it could suck mmm thing again I'm not putting $100 down for a game I mean I I could see putting the $15 down which is basically a game purchase and don't get me wrong this day and age so $15 for digital game is kind of kind of expensive so it you know it better be pretty good I beg to differ that's average for a PlayStation or Xbox game most of them these days are 1200 points it's 15 bucks I make it ever I we like them when they're 800 points but let's be real there has not been a 400 points game in like four years so unless you're talking indie games because I think indie games can go as high as 400 points so so we'll see I don't know it's just I just don't see myself you know buying this game I'm well yeah I'll buy it if it if the folks that are watching it say gosh this is looking greater it's a great game or when it actually comes out it's great reviews just like any other game but I don't know like I don't know if I but see as I was you know mentioning on this topic earlier I might not feel that strongly about this double fine thing but if Nintendo came out tomorrow and said hey if we can raise $500,000 on Kickstarter we'll do killer instinct 3 I'll be like take my money take it here you go and you're part of the problem no I'm serious here you're part of the problem then I or Konami says we'll support rhythm rhythm fever if you know no no if they came out and said that shit I say fuck you fuck you fuck you I am NOT paying you a dime for a fucking game you make the game and then I'll buy it if it's good I'm not gonna you know I'm not gonna be like oh well I'm not gonna make games until people pay me money first yeah that must be nice you know I'm not gonna well Konami did that remember it was beat mania 2d x7 style yeah remember they said they were not gonna do it until 10,000 people pre-ordered the game yeah and they're fucking assholes and you see what their car see what that karma did yeah where's your fucking beat mania DDR series now oh that's right where is your god of music now it's in the shitter because you fucking sucked it it's just like you know what you know what the chicken style is awesome you know the cherry on the top for that karma pie was it's a fucking rock revolution rock revolution was just like I'm gonna take a dump on this disc right here here you go I you know what though if you want to ask the question when did Bamani die that would be the best answer now thankful thank thank God Bamani's seemingly making a comeback there's a couple new arcade games I still I still say I don't give two shits what you say Loki that rhythm fever game is actually a lot of fun on connect no don't get me wrong they're on the path they're on the right path but it's just it's still a ways away and I'm sorry they just take a lot of missteps and you know dark gray nope it's flowing down the screen against a black background not the smartest thing to do let's go to the chat room because Bobby black wolf loves to correct me loves to correct me and says there is a 400 spacebucks arcade game a few weeks ago the scrabble plus risk combo coral member coral that I didn't realize that was 400 points I've heard a lot of good things about that game I think I might get it scrabble plus risk dark soccer doesn't that sound pretty cool sounds interesting mm-hmm all right moving on let's talk Mass Effect I know a lot of you kids really love Mass Effect and boy Mass Effect is going to keep on giving you know Bioware has all these studios now I mean hell Sacramento has one where we're at even as a Bioware studio so when there's a big Bioware event man they can get all these properties out everywhere and that's what's happening with Mass Effect 3 there is a Mass Effect 3 tie-in called Mass Effect data pad it's gonna be an iPad app that works with the console or PC version of the game and the reason why I sound sketchy on this is because there's really no details beyond that just some type of iPad interaction that works with the game I don't know if that's like Disney it will take a picture of a something or other on the screen and do something that's pretty much I think what it's gonna do like read QR codes or something like that I like something like that like you at the but I don't know you know a lot of a lot of nerds have that stuff handy so I don't have an iPad but you know on iOS which is the other story so not just the iPad or whatever that is but there's also Mass Effect infiltrator this is gonna be an iPhone iPad iPod touch game it's a third-person shooter it features certain weapon and powers from Mass Effect the whole storyline has to do with freeing prisoners from a hostile base you know typical space sci-fi stuff you get awards for collecting evidence of the crimes that happen that you catch in the mission and I guess it increases your Mass Effect 3 galaxy at war galactic readiness rating so I guess things that you do an infiltrator can actually affect what happens in Mass Effect 3 so that's kind of neat that they'll work together like that I imagine you kind of tie all your accounts together through the EA website and it'll work so that's kind of cool tie your accounts all together through the EA website get FIFA you didn't ask for it so I it's interesting I mean I'm not super huge in Mass Effect but I know people that are and I can't deny that Mass Effect is a huge franchise that a lot of people are really excited about so I gotta admit there are certain games where if they had like the iPad app I'd be like that's pretty awesome so I hope it enhances the experience it isn't just a cheap cash-in I'm not gonna pretend if they had an IS app for like a Grand Theft Auto game or something like that I'm I might have to pick it up or like an iPad Saints Row the third somehow like like you could control your missiles on the iPad no that wouldn't be worth it I don't think so yeah the UAV got they got boring pretty fast it's just much faster to use the other weapons all right release dates coming up right after one more story from Dark Sakura well how about the Xbox the Xbox I've never played an Xbox the lube the ex you the ex you explain yourself woman how about an Xbox tablet instead there in Xbox world for April 2012 there was an announcement for a new Xbox at e3 that has a tablet of course my thought is that this is the April issue hello it's a little early for the April issue I think it says scans of Xbox world for April 2012 actually no because April ones are on the newsstand in March and we're getting towards the end of February so we're getting towards the end of February really this could be so well for the publisher we're approaching the end it's way over there but we're on our way I shut up if I may this may also be someone who happens to be with a publisher or something I don't know it says April 2012 huh huh yeah but that's when Xbox world is okay well it says that there is a matte black media hub that is gonna have a tablet and that it's gonna be I'm trying to see where yes they're anticipating 399 pounds yeah this is British of course but they said that it works as a remote control with your TV as a browser when you're on the internet has extra buttons for playing a game or a portable display when you want to take your game with you so yeah 600 bucks roughly it's it's a rumor I'm thinking it's a troll but it better be a troll because I'm looking at that picture and it shows just a tablet with no tangible buttons and when I see that and see Xbox wants to use this as a controller I'm like nine nine nine nine nine tangible control no no no I think what I think what it sounds like to me is that it's a little bit of an expansion on what they had already talked about with I think you do this window windows phones where basically you can browse your I don't even know what the fuck they call their little dashboard you can browse around they're using your windows phone and you can queue up stuff like that maybe that they add that to a tablet that's running like the windows phone OS or whatever hope they got it they updated to like Android or something and then they can you know have some buttons on there so that you can play like different Xbox Live arcade games or something like that on there I could see an app maybe but isn't it funny that this comes up this story comes up right after we were talking about Mass Effect and how it's kind of tying into tablets well here's the other funny thing to precursor of things to come I have to find it but there was also the same rumor for the PlayStation 3 that they were oh wait no we talked about last week but they're gonna come up with a tablet member oh yeah the whole it had been patented or something like that right yeah but though and then the patent doesn't always mean reality my response to that is you already have some of that with the PSP can tie into the ps3 a little bit and plus the whole god they were showing it at e3 the whole Vita and that dungeon crawler game that hasn't changed its name like three times now the dungeon crawler game that's on the Vita that you know you can that's our game and then pick it up on the ps3 and that's a hunter's alliance I think because I think they're calling it now right yeah so I mean theoretically you can already have that technology if you really want to use it but it's expensive because that means you have to own a $249 Vita and a $299 PlayStation 3 so $299 $200 it has a lot cheaper than it used to be it is but that's that's where it's at now because blu-ray players are very cheap to came down with that technology all right let's move on we're gonna travel around the world and talk about release dates and see what's coming out to a game stop or a Best Buy or Walmart or whatever you like to shop Amazon near you actually earlier this week the Nintendo 3ds pearl pink came out ooh snap those up right away before the new hardware revision comes out Zumba fitness rush came out today that's definitely worthy of a Sunday release that's on Xbox 360 for connect rhythm heaven fever comes out tomorrow on the Nintendo Wii and only $29.99 they did a big push for that Adam there was like a whole launch event in LA and all this stuff yeah I fucking hate rhythm heaven it's a frustrating fucking game it looks interesting but it's not very fun I'm kind of over the Wii the Wii's just kind of sitting sad in the corner B units build it for Nintendo DS see hakuoki demon of the fleeting blossom coming out on PSP I believe that's a visual novel game blaze blue continuum shift extend on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and because this week you are getting the early adopter edition of you know the first run PS PlayStation Vita although they do say PS Vita so Vita it is also now coming out on the Vita as well also on the Vita formula 1 2011 FIFA soccer Virtua Tennis 4 world tour and luminous electronic symphony Rayman origins and that's right Vita games are now going to hit stores because people have those early bundles and to be honest they've already been hitting stores because there's no street dates on the first party games those were already out for a few weeks now interesting nothing you know I'm gonna go take this box home and just read the instruction manual if you have a Japanese system it's useful because they're region free so that's right uh-huh other stuff on other systems we've got of course UFC Undisputed 3 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 tales of the abyss on the 3ds the Sims 3 hidden springs expansion for the PC twisted metal on PlayStation 3 this week which

reality fighters although I thought that was supposed to be next month sledgehammer for the Xbox 360 which is a weird racing game with big rigs Mel you're solid through oh I'm sorry that's the next week getting ahead of myself this is a big week on the Vita in it yes well also there's obviously the first party stuff is missing on there because GameStop and other websites and stores have had it out already but of course you know there's the uncharted game is going to be coming out as well golden abyss little deviants is definitely a launch title mod nation racers and hotshots golf world tour

country really states just a few on the 15th is warp for Xbox 360 on the 16th is Alan Wake for the PC and the 17th is UFC and disputed 3 that's really it Oscar in our chat room asks do the titagotchis live leave did you poop on the screen too remember that on the old time of God cheese used to have to yes push the button to scoop their poop my devi mon not my devi my my yeah it was because I had the digimon ones remember the original digimon that was a direct release from the Tamagotchi I don't know some guys might be into that in 3d and all you never know devi mon was a big shitter alright just a couple more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week Loki so the ps3 did get another firmware update this week it speeds up web browsing apparently according to the notes for the 4.1 update also they change your account from the PlayStation Network account to the Sony Entertainment Network account and other things and improve display speed for the browser and I believe they also added Dropbox support so you can use that for storing images online huh I didn't realize that yeah it's pretty cool some other cool stuff of course there was this whole play memories thing that they were teasing a little bit ago it's a video editing app that's gonna be part of the PlayStation 3 as well as a PC and mobile suite and they've included five gigabytes of storage as well that's going to be on a cloud-based service and it does work with you know iOS and Android devices and apparently you'll be able to you know edit images and videos and stuff like that I can't imagine the image editing on the ps3 be very easy this is the controller right everyone else all right real quickly speaking of Sony things one of the big things that people are looking forward to on the PlayStation Vita or the PlayStation 3 the Final Fantasy 10 re-release now this is interesting because I thought we had a story on this a couple months ago that said Final Fantasy 10 is is a complete redo they're building it from the ground up and all this stuff it is it is a remake but this week it seems like they've gone back on that a little bit let's see this was at a China Final Fantasy event the Taipei game show because they were pushing Final Fantasy 13 to squeamix producer you know we always call Square Enix squeamix here on the show producer Shinji Hashimoto was at answering some fan questions about some of the Final Fantasy games and somebody asked about hey is the PlayStation 3 and Vita re-release of Final Fantasy 10 is it a remake or is it a remaster and Hashimoto said directly it is a remaster so think like the Shadow of the Colossus HD thing that came out not too long ago I wouldn't even say it's well that wouldn't be so bad hopefully it's not like the Melger Solid stuff they look kind of blurry and weird now he also went so far to say that the screen is much prettier than the original but he didn't really elaborate on that whatsoever what can I do for you give me Final Fantasy 7 next how about first that's what all the fans are saying but I I get it though it's easier to do this I mean there was an excellent point that was made is that a lot of the stuff that was in Final Fantasy 7 was still kind of sprite based whereas everything in Final Fantasy 10 was full 3d so it's much easier to take Final Fantasy 10 and just you know assign it to the new resolution give it some higher res textures and you know maybe remake the menu and and go back into some of the things you know I think they'll do some other little things to sweeten the pot I'm sure maybe like a bonus summon or a bonus dungeon or something else you know it's I think it'll I think it'll pay tribute well enough to the original I'm so I like Final Fantasy 10 I know Final Fantasy 10 has a share of haters but I thought it was great it's still still to this day in my opinion has the best summon of all time Shiva of course when she comes out snap great so huh anyhow how about we travel down memory lane a little bit sounds plan later we always on the show let's take a trip down memory lane in a segment we call the classic game of the week where dark soccer is gonna reach into the vault and find a classic game she says hey why don't you remaster this bitches hmm back in my day we didn't have remakes and remasters we played our games ugly ass pixelated and we liked it ugly they were cute all right so dark Sakura what is the classic game of the week this week puzzle bobble yay it came out in America as bust a move but puzzle bobble is great and I've been playing a lot of it lately it came out in 1994 it's about as high as it goes this YouTube I'm streaming things a little quiet I love this game anyway puzzle bobble was a puzzle game that came out for one or two players put out by Taito based off of their 1986 game bubble bubble and it has the characters from that game you play as bub and or Bob and it's cute it's super cute I love the game there were two different versions of the original there was puzzle bobble that came out in Japan only in 1994 on a Taito B system hardware though and it was originally called bubble buster and then down the line there was the neo-geo version of puzzle bobble that was exactly the same except it was in stereo and had a few different sound effects and translated text when it came out in the u.s. it was called a bust a move and had anti-drug and anti-literary messages ooh and the same title was wait a minute puzzle bottle was anti-drug are we talking just an FBI warning in the beginning winners don't use drugs okay and the title was retained for the u.s. Canada and Europe on consoles so basically you have different colored balls for different reason they're bubbles but they you have different colors and you have to turn the crank to launch the balls yes turn the crank to watch the balls that's what they're doing yes at any rate you have a little pointer and yes you does attach to a crank that Bob and Bob move and you can bounce these bubbles little bubbles up to other bubbles and when you get three in a row touching then they pop you may have a bunch of one color already up there in a neat colorful pattern but it gets really complicated trust me I noticed that when they touch the balls together they explode so they go in the direct line along the pointer and as you do though a few more in a row then the ceiling starts to drop down when your bubbles hit the very bottom line then your game over if you don't know this game isn't crawl up from under the rock no dipping your balls below the line I think dark soccer is mad at me anyway which were your favorite balls the blue ones she's trying not to laugh she thinks she's bad she's not shut up you're a bitch at any rate it has really busting your balls there it has a different scoring system it's exponential scoring so for each that you pop in the same color they're worth ten points each but if you drop a bunch that are attached to that one me like say that you've got at the top you have like two yellow one blue one green you know I'll touch the yellow when you break the yellow ones everything that's textural balls it's good balls drop your score actually will go to 20 points and then 40 and then 80 so it's an exponential scoring system if you rub and girls together their maximum is 50,000 points that you get for clearing it within five seconds or less and then it drops down to zero over the next minute you do have two player modes are not around you just each have the arena and the same arrangement but when you get a large clump broken it goes on to the opponent's side kind of the way that uh help you appeal works which is one of another one of my favorites so yeah it's bub and Bob or as they were doing in Japan baboon and baboon and it's their same animation from a bubble bubble actually closer to bubble symphony and it also has all the enemies in it so the red one is and I'll do both names the English name was super socket and Japanese name was invader the yellow one is hello balloon or pull pull there was a green is Willy whistle or drunk blue is bubble buster or Zen Chan purple is beluga or Monsta orange is quietly or Bonnie bow black is incendo or hit a konsu and white is stoner or my death who doesn't want to name their balls so for all the games that came out there are a bunch of them and I will go pretty much in order there was puzzle bobble puzzle bobble 2 which was called best to move again in the u.s. puzzle bobble 2x which I believe is the one that I had on Saturn puzzle bobble 3 in 1986 puzzle bobble for puzzle bottle mini on leogeo pocket color super puzzle bobble in 1999 azumanga puzzle die-o which was based off of azumanga die-o from 2001 super puzzle bobble to super puzzle bobble all-stars puzzle bobble mobile which I am playing on my phone puzzle bobble versus which was for the engage who remembers the engage best move deluxe on PSP ultra best move on Xbox puzzle bobble DS he packed a puzzle bobble which was best to move DS ultra puzzle bobble pocket which was best to move deluxe in the u.s. and best to move ghost in Europe best to move bash on we best move online best to move mobile for the newer mobile phones in 2008 space puzzle bobble which was called space buster move or puzzle bobble galaxy you're a bust a move yes balls in space puzzle bobble plus puzzle bobble live puzzle bobble for iOS which is best to move puzzle bobble 3d which was best to move universe on 3ds new puzzle bobble aka new best to move for iOS and puzzle bobble online came out in 2011 there were clones who remember snood I don't fortunately I have sold snood yeah my friend's mom was hooked on that stupid game play the real thing this frozen bubble and bubble shooter you know which I actually all those crappy Facebook games yeah yeah yeah and like jungle quest was not one of them no jungle well and there's actually even a version of it on that comes built in with Linux there's one on Google Plus to any puzzle they pawn I love puzzle they pawn nothing to do with not like that there are no balls and puzzles upon it's exactly the same thing so anyway that's your game is a Tetris puzzle bobble okay everything one question I want to ask it's very important that we didn't address what in the actual fuck it was this box art on the PlayStation 2 for super bus to move it was redonk I'm gonna I'm gonna post this link in chat it's from Amazon I apologize it's big but that's the only place I need to find the box art for those listening on the podcast just go to your favorite retail site Amazon whatever look for super bus to move on the PlayStation 2 and tell me what in the fuck is that box art it is a baby blowing a bubble and in the sunglasses you see glimpses of what that is Saturn one was freaking creepy looking fucking scary who would buy that no look at the sectors look at the Saturn version let me see the Saturn version ah his face is melting no his eyes are being pinned open going that in the chat room like Taito what kind of crack do you think Americans are on I think that company or whoever they hired for marketing was the same one that launched the PlayStation 3 a shitload of that game on Saturn like I would just sit in front of it for hours and scream at it it's one of those games that you see it in the arcade and if it's 25 cents you can't help but just check it out you know like even to this day I've fucking creepy game even recently fucking creepy all right but it was an awesome game it still is awesome all righty there it is your classic game of the week puzzle bobble or if you want bus to move but not that good the Japanese box art is so much better not that creepy super bus to move look at that that seat that should be what it was in the u.s. instead it was a stupid dude trapped in a bubble with his eyes pinned open that gives me creep nightmares that's that is definitely one of the monsters in Silent Hill on the box there all right that's gonna do it for part a of our show but guess what we are not done yet kids we've got plenty more show to come we got some rapid-fire news coming up some more news your emails

course now they're gonna say this everybody's gonna do this but there wasn't a single person that came in to chat tonight and said hey did you guys hear that Whitney Houston died because I was so waiting for that because inevitably when something big happens in the world that really has nothing to do with video games it'll get brought up anyway it's really been off and on like even on the radio and stuff because like today I was you know driving my wife's car and she has the radio tuned to be like it's not really like oldies but it's like the R&B station or whatever and is it that V 101 or whatever you want to say so I was driving to the park to take Josh to the park it's just you know regular music you know that's fine I'll wait home for the park all Whitney Houston solid Whitney Houston from like it was like three songs all Whitney Houston it was ridiculous obviously it's a tragic loss that it up but they all sound very the same it doesn't have to stop it it doesn't really have anything to do with video games well she to be fair I totally have I want to dance with somebody and sing star so she wasn't seeing star so tip of the hat to a famous seeing star inspiration I guess if you want to say that all right but I will give a big gold star to all our chatters tonight for keeping it on topic you know even despite all of the unfortunate that happened with Miss Houston there's not really a lot of talk about the Grammys either so I know you guys are focused and I appreciate that all right let's move on let's get back into some rapid-fire news we're going to do some quick news stories and then we'll get back into the longer stuff so Loki start us off with some rapid-fire news Microsoft finally or Microsoft or LucasArts I haven't really said who announced this but they've announced the date for connect Star Wars I know let's get excited it's coming in April and it's not joke it's on April 3rd that is probably the closest date they could have added to you know get in there April Fool's Day although actually yeah April April 1st is a Sunday I gotta say that um that can the Xbox it looks like r2d2 looks pretty kick-ass oh yeah so that'll be coming on the same day as well now here's here's the thing and I know we've talked about this before but really really they're gonna have dancing in there I mean that just looks stupid shut up they put dancing in there oh my god that's Star Wars that is connects Star Wars that looks like dance masters yeah exactly is that like cantina dancing or something they're gonna have dancing I see Jabba the Hutt back there it's like you can be one of his sluts dancing there dad's for me slut wasn't that a line that Lucas put back in return of Jedi hey sure yeah so that'll be coming out and of course you are my eyes in our chat room gives us the greatest line from the trailer lightsaber on remember it's all about the voice commands and I'm telling you I played this game and oh my god yeah you played it oh my god no no no no no I think you need to see this as well no make it stop stupid like that that little picture is not helping the rumors about c-3po sexuality because you know that's out there in the fanverse I'm just saying I'm just saying just saying all I gotta say is the one that they had a Disneyland dance-off much better than this shit and you know he's dancing the gaga it's he was programmed this way baby lol ah yeah anyways I just hope that God it's it's way better than than the versions because those were not good but that is supposed to be coming out April 3rd and so yeah some other stuff Super Mario Brothers crossover 2 is now on the Super Mario Brothers crossover is definitely something that's infringing all sorts of copyrights but hey it's a flash game it's been out there for a while and people play it so if you want to check it out it's at exploding rabbit com slash game slash Super dash Mario dash Bros dash crossover I'm sure if you just go explaining rabbit.com they have a link on the front page and basically what version 2 offers you is you know you still get the play as multiple characters including Mario Luigi Link Samus Simon Belmont Megaman base Bill Reiser Ryu and Sophia the third from blaster master yes blaster master and then they all have alternate looks because you can also cycle through the game or they cycle randomly through versions of the levels including NES Super NES and Game Boy styles throughout the game as well also apparently demon returns super demon returns and I guess the Super Mario Brothers style game from the DS's retro game challenge 2 are different versions as well so neat and there's also a picture that shows Dr. Wily in there so I don't know if you could play as him that'd be weird so that's uh that by the way quickly the chatters are asking for the question or asking for the Star Wars dance party pictures see all Lincoln yeah Lincoln and then Rama can get him up on the tumbler for the podcast listeners I want to see it too disturbing it is a little disturbing just a warning don't click and then finally apparently there's a rumor that certain and I mean this is probably gonna be happening certain people that put stuff on the App Store are using bots to automatically download their games and boost their rankings in the App Store to get more people to download it I mean I don't even have to really look into that to know that that's probably true I mean there's people that put artificially high review scores to boost their reviews and stuff so why not now is a great time to mention if you want to leave your totally legitimate five-star reviews for Orange Lounge Radio on the iTunes Store we'd really appreciate it by the way click the subscribe button four or five times while you're there I'm kidding maybe I'm not about the five-star reviews though so all right I I'm not I would not be surprised all by the way looking at some of those games that are in the top 20 like you really look at like how did this get here really this game is beating Angry Birds and where's my water and the stuff you expect to see in the top 10 really interesting speaking of games you expect to see in the top 10 on the iOS store tiny tower look hate on this game all you want but it is really fucking addicting and how many addicts are playing tiny tower 10 million according to a tweet from Ian Marsh the tweeted this week that 10 million folks have downloaded tiny tower that's on iOS that's not counting Android or I think that's it it's only also on Android I believe it has a million daily active users I am no longer an active player this game I finally quit I stopped the crack a few months ago how tall is your tower um I know it pales in comparison years I won't say it was like 82 stories or something like that I still have to get the new shops well actually no I did get the new shops last time I still have the oh that's right there are new shops huh damn you don't say things like that let me look because you asked I'm gonna fire up my tiny tower right look at this I haven't touched this crack in a long time dark soccer did you ever get us sucked into tiny tower for a little yeah I stopped you finally stopped I stopped it a while back good for you let's see my tower is I do not want to get the plant game leave me alone let's see 86 stories tall I was close and my 86th floor for the record is the nerd cave apartments very cool very cool right above the 85th floor volleyball because I don't know who puts volleyball on the 85th floor but there you go huh Bahmani fans are looking forward to a new arcade game called sound voltex booth this is gonna be playable at the AOU 2012 amusement Expo it's kind of a new Bahmani game from Konami and there's some new songs that have been announced for it called Zephyr remix so you might remember Zephyr from one of the old DDR games a red zone remix and this is gonna be very cool a vampire killer remix because as you know vampire killer is one of the big songs from Castlevania so we like it when the Bahmani series kind of jacks music from other Konami games because let's face it Konami music was awesome also making its way to AOU an arcade version of dance evolution a new version of you beat as well and I didn't know this series was still going guitar freaks and drum mania xg3 I had no idea that series is still alive and kicking but there you go lastly from me Nintendo of America has hired a new spokesperson and following in the footsteps of what Carrie Underwood has been a Nintendo spokesperson Beyonce has been a Nintendo spokesperson who could live up to those great great musicians how about Oogie Oogie is a Jack Russell Terrier that's right Nintendo has hired a dog to be their next pose person now to be fair this dog is very famous because this dog appears in the movie the artist which is like you know the movie they all say is gonna win the Oscar right I haven't seen the movie it apparently the dog plays one of those like way too cute roles that you know it's very memorable and what game will he be pimping guesses guesses Nintendogs of course Nintendogs we have something to say about that a second and and and the pearl pink 3ds Oh for the record I found in the Nintendogs plus cats in the clearance Bennett fries nice how much 14 bucks I'm not surprised they need to fucking sell those they probably have like tons on their shelves hey this is just Nintendogs the end there's no cats yeah all right dark Sakura well how about Sonic Sonic and Sega all-stars racing is getting a sequel and it will be out it looks like at the end of the year so hey fun I tried to play it I didn't really care for it and then there is and more racing news little big planet karting that will be coming out and it was actually announced via Twitter I think dark Tetsuya said this in the destination PlayStations where people were at I think our Tetsuya said this in the mod forums but isn't little big planet karting basically mod nation racers it is and they actually do have a poster for it that is on the new games are I think neo gaff forms I think and you know what though yes it is but I think that this will be more fun I you know what as much as like I want to hate on this but I can't be why because little big planet seriously is like the best thing Sony has right now in my opinion I mean I fucking love those games so the last bit of news has to do with rock band and it's the releases that are coming out I believe around Valentine's Day so it's the gold star my heart pack and here is what's on it it's a loan by heart which I freaking want that song I I want that song are you gonna sing it in the privacy of your own home I'll sing it with people around if you want to hear me try to break my voice and there's to be with you by mr. big every rose has its thorn by poison and the rick rollin song wait you mean I finally have an excuse to do this to the listeners yes I've been waiting 10 years 10 freaking years never gonna give you up oh to get trolled by an ad on YouTube oh yeah and for to be with you and every rose has its thorn it's got pro guitar and bass expansions delayed punch line I've noticed that he still looks exactly like that it's amazing what plastic surgery will do it's a vampire Alan just yelled he does Alan has that yet he does look a little bit like our Pat he does look a little bit by the way did you hate that you use that term that is did you know that that was the most requested rock band song ever I don't care about the others I went alone I would play that song I would be off what alone no not alone fucking look I'm talking about fuck you heart is awesome we saw heart I know we did see heart like two songs because we relate to the concert best concert lineup ever heart and journey wait does not get it doesn't matter who opened for heart but what cheep cheep but whatever all right anyhow well there's been a cat sighting all right we're gonna get back into some longer news here join us in our chat room chat about orange lounge radio calm if you are listening live on this Sunday evening I think we finally had cats seen during the show we had a very vocal Oh Alan says they could smell the lunch meat there goes that tail there they go they're on out of here the chatters are talking about the Rick roll Akuma JP says oh this is the end of olr that was the moment we jump we jump the shark when we Rick rolled all the listeners there let's see stand in our chat room says Rob should do a karaoke version of the Rick roll song and use his re-recording as a soundbit for the show when he wants to fuck sound with fuck around with the audience um no act deaf in our chat room says forever alone see what he did there forever alone back to some news Loki all right so the Skyrim creation kit came out this week with the steam packs and stuff they have a high-resolution texture pack and also there is a portal cameo apparently you can download an add-on that creates the space core visiting your game it crashes into it really just goes to show glados makes everything better and and space space core can be used to craft a helmet that looks like one of the cores as well that is so awesome it really should have a thing on the PC where then once you do that quest you get like a costume in portal 2 for the little dudes and co-op you know there's also a rumor thanks to someone that was digging around some of the console commands that there's a quest that's tied to all that too that they haven't unlocked yet that's awesome um some other cool stuff I want to see our eyes I saw on there they had a mod that someone made that it was a giant horse and a bunch of people like you know whacking at it with you know swords and stuff like that and they named you know Bethesda and valve and stuff like that and it was the arrow and the knee thing you know they're beating a dead horse huh Wow okay that's some intellectual humor there right but one of the things so one of the most popular mods that's actually available on this creation kit service is something that removes that arrow in the need line from the game so that you don't have to ever hear that brilliant now the interesting thing about this is that modding was being done a long time before this even came out yeah now it's like you know officially embraced but if I know this because I was playing I was what I wasn't playing I was watching Alan play Skyrim and he zoomed his character out I'm like Alan why is your person not wearing any clothes whatsoever I can see her titties I can see her titties and I can see her butt and Alan's just like no this was legitimately Alan's reaction oh I knew I forgot to put the armor on I am playing possibly one of the sluttiest games of Skyrim ever everyone is modded to be like not naked but just and they're in you know Norway or whatever they all look very cold but yeah everyone's very sexy and it's some of the some of the male armors that I have have the back piece missing so they're just their asses hanging out and I'm like this is hot and they're beating on the dragon like with this ass hanging out yeah but there's a lot of like stuff that you could do but it required you to move files and something that the creation kit kind of simplifies all that with they have a launcher and you basically okay I want this this this this go and that's why they for anyone playing Skyrim on PC you absolutely have to get at least sky UI it's a complete UI an inventory replacer and also I think it's called categorized favorites menu it completely changes the UI which I hated originally and it's like a different game super awesome all right unannounced Alan cameo thank you no don't be don't apologize it's like the minute he heard Skyrim he's like I should come out and make a sandwich I should take a break from Skyrim to go talk about Skyrim right hey I heard you like Skyrim so here's some Skyrim while you're sky rimming I really do wanna I want to get it for my laptop here but I'm playing it on my PC or my PSR no kids read that 360 right now I love that they did the higher resolution textures I wish I wish they had that like you know how the outfield through I understand that for PC oh but I said yeah you know how like battlefield 3 had a thing where you can install high-res textures to your hard drive I wish they have that for like the 360 that would be pretty awesome I understand why they don't but you know Tiger Claw in our chat room says I'm sure the furries are messing around with the Skyrim mods you'd be surprised the stuff you can find and it's not safe for work so basically someone has turned Skyrim in his second life am I understanding this correctly act-def says I want Skyrim so I can mod it with my little pony stuff I you know they have that already as much as I I love having Skyrim on the PlayStation 3 is gonna use my controller and all that I have to admit I am somewhat starting to regret not getting it on PC the minute I saw that macho man dragon mod if you had a J tag you can do that well wasn't the PlayStation supposed to get some of the popular community mods at some point yeah yeah they had that whole steam integration think that they use for one game that was fucking awesome I think though I think but we now that modding is officially embraced and now that things can be officially signed off by Bethesda maybe that's a possibility down the line I don't know maybe not gonna happen I don't know never say never there'll be a fee but never say never and well the other thing I was gonna say is you know I don't know if you saw but like they had a whole a I don't know what they called it was a Bethesda kind of hey team members make whatever you want during a week and then show us what you have for Skyrim so they were able to make whatever mod they want and they came up with a whole bunch of cool shit that they could have could have thrown in there but oh we couldn't give them another week to do what they want you know because that would be you know too awesome they have like Spears they had a giant enemy crab yeah and giant enemy crab all sorts of you know improvements seasonal changes stuff like that it's just amazing Lee there's some silence to one in our chat room says Oda Ving is rainbow bright best mod right there what I guess you can change one of the characters in a rainbow bright why have naked people when you can have 80s cartoon nostalgia why not have both you're sick well I'm not saying rainbow brain has to be naked but you can have naked people and you can have rainbow bright I don't know I don't know I feel awkward this is an awkward covers I want to be able to have all these different dragons like I want to have a macho man dragon I want to have these you know my little pony dragon I want to have I don't know what other dragons they have out there and you know maybe you know maybe a family got Peter Griffin dragon or something like that or I want to have a mod that makes one of my companions Loki and he always just yells he's really like he always gets really irritated like why are you doing that and then it kids like shout and they can shout and knock people away I'd be awesome all right I don't know why Loki didn't have this story because it's more relevant to his interest but I'll read it and then Loki can react to it eat sleep play who is the developer behind twisted metal which you know remember the series was like big back in the day and now it's all nostalgic against I don't even know what they're doing with this game to be honest there's a there's a new one coming out like what this week I do want to get it but we'll see maybe I'll get it well according to the Salt Lake City Tribune David Jaff is not with eat sleep play anymore he left the company and he's off to pursue casual games yes that worked so well the last time he responded and called it highly exaggerated but he didn't deny that he left so apparently there's been reductions and all this stuff David Jaff did confirm that following the release of twisted metal he is going to step away from eat sleep play there have been layoffs these this affects the offices in Utah which is interesting because David Jaff lives in California but he did mention that the directing a game from a distance and all that did take its toll so that's not good when the game I mean well I don't know I it's easy to sit here and say oh that looks bad but at the same time it's also very common in the industry when a game is done for there to be layoffs so but I guess this means they aren't starting work on a sequel right away he said there's gonna be no DLC zero DLC for it interesting I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing I mean part of me is like well doing good it's all on the disc but then I'm like oh wait maybe it's bad because that means they're just putting it out there yeah there's gonna be aside from like I think the pre-order bonus that you can get you know for me a prior in the game aside from that there is going to be no DLC for twisted mill none they're just sticking around long enough to do like any game balancing and bugs that may they've they may not have caught and that's it once that patch is done they're done interesting all right well there's that so we'll see what this game has in store I don't know I'm not hearing good things about it which is kind of disappointing Loki you're still gonna get in on it just because you love the old ones we'll see all right let's go to the email email bag mailbag at orange lounge radio.com is where we invite your emails each and every week we read them on the show dark soccer dives in the mailbag headfirst again that's mailbag at orange lounge radio calm dear llr crew after a long time of not listening and my only other podcast bit the dust I decided to run back to you for my gaming news fix in the college budget where I can no longer afford a subscription to magazines so this is to you my new favorite number one podcast on my PSP I would say iPod but some jackass dumb shit who took an arrow to the knee of their knowledge stole that from me along with my 3ds ds light and FM transmitter the DS I had I marked with my girlfriend's initials taped over with duct tape and had an r4 flash card with all of my DS backups and old old-school ROMs and my 3ds I had a lot of these punctuation please I had a lot of 90s pop and DDR OSTs on the SD card was super glued in and locked in with a flap of duct tape if he or she is listening give me back my stuff you bitch sadly it sounds like someone knew you had all that stuff in your case peace out ds lover so I want to know who we bumped off to become number one ds lover didn't say which podcast I want to know who we bumped off to be number one next email all right yes stop it right now no she's gone to join her career stop it read the next email dear dearlings with the non holiday holiday coming up on Tuesday I was wondering if I could get some Valentine's Day video game recommend recommendations out of you the game I'm looking for should be one of the following a a romantic game a game with a realistic portrayal of romance that is pulled off in a convincing manner not something where the characters are driven by wanting to engage in hot monkey sex rather a game where the characters are motivated by wanting to engage in a truly enriching enriching romantic relationship or be a game to play while drunk a game that is ideal to play while you are drunk drunk drunk drunk drunk not a game to play while blackout drunk rather a game to play while borderline blackout drunk stay black entertainment this message has been apricot hefeweizen from west wasatch beers it's like fruit that gets you drunk sent from my iPad um and I have a game love plus I was gonna say Catherine I was gonna say Catherine actually or a girl gun gal gun if it's true love you can play rock band together all night long get Catherine if it's single love then it's self-love it's self-love then it's gonna be the guy game first oh my god I haven't heard of that game in like six years wasn't that game banned because there was a 17 year old naked it oh yeah we don't know which one metal gear metal gear solid cuz remember love can bloom on the battlefield they can all be under a love is a battlefield no if there's a line snake can love bloom on the battlefield rdg singe in our chat room suggests laser shoot Larry three that's a good suggestion a boy the mansion get Catherine did okay is what was it self love or was it duo love a game with realistic portrayal of romance that is pulled off in a convincing manner really not where the characters are driven by wanting to engage in hot monkey sex I'm trying to think of any like I got to say hot monkey sex a lot there's there's like there's a the Tokimeki games donkey Kong Final Fantasy 8 what can I do for you no just I don't just get Catherine what was that really oh god was it on the PSP Brooktown and if you want to play a game while you're drunk that's just gonna piss you off you'll never be able to find that game no if you want a game that's just gonna piss you off while you're drunk plate irritating stick move next email I like entertainment the get the chatters are kind of agreeing with the Catherine selection okay this is from the ECA put out a call to action to discover state laws relating to EULA they used some of the verbiage from my previous inquiry to Maryland's consumer protection office blows what appears to be another canned response and only the first two sentences seem remotely related to my email what makes this cool is letter I sent to OLR a couple of months which Jamie read was used as a basis for the official ECA letter you see I confirmed that they liked parts of the letter enough to include in their letter this is the first time I ever influenced something so countrywide but also Canada except of course OLR mailbag which is clearly worldwide the goal of this letter-writing campaign is to establish what the current laws for each state are and then maybe we can start talking about changing it I suggest sending the ECA letter to your state legislators as well as the Attorney General of your respective state this may boil down to actually having to hire a business law lawyer to find out and that's from rubber so his email was used in the his letter was basically turned into the form letter for the ECA go you you a celebrity a winner is you you like Whitney I mean stop it right now party fell okay we have two emails left two more emails shut up I'm the one reading them I've been seeing a lot of forum members upset at Sony not bringing the UMD transfer program to North America forgive me if I'm oversimplifying this or misunderstanding something they're upset because they have to pay Sony to repurchase the content they already bought on UMD as Vita digital contact instead of having to pay Sony to repurchase the contact they already bought on UMD as Vita digital content well they wanted the discount I'll be it for slightly less in some cases if the UMD game has a digital version and the publisher is participating as for me I'm not really in the market for another handheld quite yet I did get a PSP for Christmas been on my list for a while mostly to check out games that aren't on ps3 like the Powerstone collection and before that replaced my iPod classic when it's hard drive gave out with a touch so I doubt I'll be getting a Vita or 3ds anytime soon stay staying Robert M all right and last email I have like two UMD games anyways because I sold the rest off I'd have like some of the Grand Theft Auto games I actually have a bunch yeah I have quite a few all my cue entertainment games every extend extra but we also have a PSP so greetings olr it's your friendly neighborhood turtle I have a somewhat odd question please don't take this the wrong way your show is my absolute favorite among video game podcasts hence my question can you mention any other video game podcasts that you like or listen to the caveat I want to know about other shows besides what's on the all games network I used to like Derek but there's way too much cursing for my liking why do I like oh why do I ask all our this question wait a minute though I do like oh alert I know I was gonna say hold on cuz we curse a lot on this show so that I okay okay I need to step it up what the fuck is your problem dude well I'm a carpenter and choose to work by myself all day and need good stuff to listen to which means that every Monday morning I start out my week with olr but by lunch I'm out of video game related material any shows that you'd like I'm sure to like keep up the best podcast on air you guys are a great way to start out each week also being on the right coast I never knew what pinkberry is but after looking at their website I am extremely jealous you guys are awesome your loyal turtle in Philly serious turtle it's sort of God we need to start charging for all the product placement we just give away on this show thank me um well thank you I mean that's that's quite the compliment I don't see that as a negative at all that they're looking at us for recommendations for other shows because I'm looking at my like the ultimate compliment see here's the thing I listen to a lot of stuff that's not video game related whatsoever and the stuff that is video game related is kind of all game shows yeah you mentioned Derek's dead pixel a lot I think that's what he was talking about that because alive I you know that's a good I like it I don't think there's that I like fantastic forum uh-huh I I really like video game outsiders yeah and they they have a they have a rhythm very similar to ours um not so much lately I think they I think they've been challenged because I think the hosts are starting to kind of go their own ways but when they're together it's a good time and John does his best to keep it together I listen to Horde house well Horde house no comment right now but there there's gonna be some things changing I think um let's see other video game podcasts of course Bobby black wolf of course that's just a given we like him but he has an updated podcast feed in a while naughty boy so even if I told you to listen to him you couldn't get his newest shows stuff that's off the all games network there's not a lot of video game podcasts that I've actually see here's the thing are you well I try to listen to others and I don't like them so I don't want to name them but there's one in particular I really tried to listen to and I just and it's an independent show so that's what I really want to support other independent shows but we'll say it's a it was a very slickly produced independent show and the person behind it does a lot of podcasts on iTunes but I just wasn't in um it's a video podcast but I guess so that wouldn't really work but I like occasionally watching episodes of the Ben Heck show well I'll throw on some of the video game YouTube ones when I when I was at work I would check out the angry video game nerd on my phone just by plugging in on YouTube and I like classic game room that was one of my favorites let me give a shout out to a few that I'm subscribed to that I actually whipped out my phone and I'm looking at some others that I'm subscribed to of course I I subscribe to under sedation live yeah which is you know sci-fi and stuff Travis you know that's the show I started on our own Rama has a podcast of course anime jam session if you're into that pod culture I got to give a shout out to my buddy Brad over at pod culture if you like the sci-fi geeky stuff let me put it this way the TARDIS shows up like in nine tenths of the artwork so you know if you're if you're a Doctor Who fan you're gonna love pod culture couple people are saying the bomb cast I haven't tried that one myself I know a lot of folks are big fans of giant bomb though I really love smartest man in the world by Greg Proops yes but if you're not into swearing I think it's still really funny but just just warning you well there's two that I listen to and they're both from I'm gonna have to look at look it up again but one of them is stuff mom never told you that's really just interesting tidbits things that you know you might not know and the other one is it's from how stuff works and one of them is a things you never learned in history class and two others I want to name real quick here of course girls gone Wow the lovely sill out of the UK if since there is you know horde house is on a horde hiatus right now girls gone Wow is a great place to get your fix girl on guy with Aisha Tyler but see I love Aisha Tyler like you know I'm totally gay but Aisha Tyler she's pretty hot and she's really intelligent a total geek so I've met her before did you really yeah what'd you think of her she she's alright was she hot in person I think she's real I think she's really hot she's attractive because she's kind of got the she's got a little bit of the geez oh she's very geeky you know that she plays like Gears of War and all that stuff and if you listen to her podcast she's had some great episodes she had Greg Proops on she had Margaret Cho on she had Chris Hardwick on she she came in pimping some movies she was in I don't remember what it was yeah but she's interesting yeah so I did podcat that's a good idea all right there you go I think we've given you plenty of suggestions we could probably name a million more but I mean that was the ones I named were off my personal iPod I do listen to all those there's one other that I listen to it's not video game but you know me and my history love there is history of the world through a hundred objects that's put out by the BBC and the Museum of History in London actually if you like history that was a really freaking good one and even though the the guy sounds a little too posh for my taste but other than that it's a really good one you know me I listen to all of the informational ones and the stuff that's gonna teach you something that in video game ones so but hopefully this help and that was last email all right anyhow let's move on past the mailbag this is the part of the show where we get angsty sometimes we get a little bit angry here at orange launch radio and we do a segment called the F use of the week so here it is fu to the increased cost of tuition and people who only want you to have a bachelor's degree and fu to all the morons driving with their lights off in the rain and not signaling in the rain stupid not signaling in the rain signaling in the rain low-key your nephews so my a few goes to Jack in the Box for pushing this milkshake that has no bacon in it seriously I mean come on you can't even put like a little you can't sprinkle a little bit of bacon bits on top you know because it is a bacon milkshake and you know whatever it it is what it is I guess I'll have to make my own bacon ice cream wasn't bad so milkshake the work their sandwich looks weak to their like BLT sandwich I'm like yeah lettuce and tomato and pickle and garbage I mean this is a regular burger sorry that the chats a little bit behind you know that's too tense to happen there's a bit of a buffer because you know we send the signal to all games who sends it to all of you and there's time involved with that act after our chat goes blame it on the rain I think that was in response to your F you dark Sakura who just had desk alright you okay dark Sakura alright my a few of the week wait where's the F you music alright my a few the week F you to that noise after all these years I still hate that it's so old like saw the garage all right dead a lot of people I bet we're getting to the point now where people were born after that movie you know it's gonna know what you're talking about all right why she sound like a creaky door I don't get it and no my real if you that do not distract from my real F you of the week because this is serious business my F you the week goes to parking lots I hate them oh so much no dude dude dude dude I went to the mall Arden fair two o'clock yesterday yesterday Saturday that was the dumbest thing I could have ever done in my life that mall was more crowded than it is on Christmas like what is that Black Friday it was more crowded than it was a Black Friday and just stupid people jumping in front of cars driving slowly it got to the point we drove around the parking lot twice couldn't find a place to park went up to the second floor of the parking structure where nobody ever parks every space if there was taken and I said fuck it and went home park across the street that's what I used to do we park at Hooters oh no in that lot where nobody there's like fucking nothing there now huh yep where they used to have the club the nightclub yeah exactly used to park across the street right there next to the sidewalk hit the crosswalk by the time you like cross the street and stuff you'll it seriously I used to go to Virgin over there it was awesome I'm a mega store yeah sad it's urban outfitters now it's all right urban outfit like some of their shirts they sell Michelle's book do you know what you know what I bought huh at that virgin what my activator nice for the Genesis with oh what was that game I used to get import CDs at Virgin that's where I would go there for mm-hmm all right anyhow and then the internet all right let's move on more news and skype line coming up very soon Twitter topics as well tons of fun stuff coming up very very very very soon Loki yeah I was gonna say fuck you to your parking lot too cuz I have a park in like the mill nowhere the hike back to my car if I remember where it is so call duty elite it's pretty popular for Activision they've have 7 million users using the elite service on the 1.5 million have actually paid the you know $60 for or $50 I think it is for all the free well plenty of the paid for the download content so $50 times 100 or 1.5 million times that's a lot of fucking money 75 million dollars and people thought who would want to sign up for this service well to be honest if you're gonna pay for the download content you're actually saving money with that service and if you play a lot of Call of Duty that might be worth it to you I mean the maps don't look bad I just don't play Call of Duty modern warfare 3 so I don't use the service at all now I don't think it ties in with modern warfare so the first one it does it looks like it's doing well for them they made lots of money do you are they gonna do another one of those Expos this year like they did last year they might I don't know this didn't that do really well for him too because there's no BlizzCon this year but there might be the whole Call of Duty con or what did they call that like the I forget the name somebody in shadow yell it out but they did like a day long event remember so I could see them I mean I could see them doing that so because it worked out you know pretty well for them of course there's gonna be another call it yeah I saw yeah they announced that they're gonna make another Call of Duty game you don't even have to put that in the fucking you do not have to announce that at all that it was part of their you know their financial report or something like that that they're making new Call of Duty game of course they're gonna fucking make a new Call of Duty game it's news when they say we're not making the Call of Duty game we're not having a BlizzCon I mean it's just you know you don't even need to report that people just make the assumption that there's gonna be a new Call of Duty game coming out speaking of that Activision Blizzard earnings call that happened this week very surprising that they announced there's no release date still for Diablo 3 which we thought for sure we'd have that by the end of next month but now it's looking like no cute summertime Q2 is what they're saying if America will Starcraft not a Starcraft probably buggy Starcraft I'm in the beta it's great well then I they just hate you clearly Starcraft is you know launched in the end of July so that was kind of an odd time for it I mean less yeah no no date well speaking of Diablo 3 my next story happens to be about Diablo 3 Bashiach who's the community manager over at Blizzard was answering some questions and it wasn't about Warcraft this time it was about Diablo 3 they say Diablo 3 it is still slated for 2012 but now they're saying that Diablo 3 is only going to support up to four players even though there is five classes now that's four player co-op they haven't said anything about a five player mode in the game Bashiach said that Blizzard is not looking into it and they're not going to expand their player cap no idea as to why they did that interesting because in World of Warcraft you have if I'm not mistaken you have 10 classes and raids are 10 people or 25 or you know but most you know the end game content is geared towards that although you would find very very very few raid groups that have one of each class very few Diablo 3 also will not have built-in voice chat at launch Blizzard wants to make sure the voice chat is going to be worth it the wow voice chat leaves a lot to be desired so it turned a lot of people to you know team speak ventrilo mumble so Diablo 3 is going to have to do the same thing they're also one of the thing Diablo 3 is not going to be getting any more visual treatment than what you're already seeing there is no higher resolution textures in the final game that's the official word from Bashiach I still thought the game looked good enough on look in fact to look great on the beta so I don't think they necessarily need to make it that much better you know again part of the charm of Diablo is that you know be able to be played on a variety of systems if you want to be able to find four people to co-op with I'm still really looking forward to Diablo 3 despite all this I just wish it would come out already I get a free copy because I signed the Blizzard blood pact for World of Warcraft because I have problems few more news stories for you guys and then the Twitter topics in the skype line dark soccer well did you ever watching that pac-man show in the 80s I can I do that's where pac-man had legs right yeah yes I do remember that well I also the pac-land game was based off of that too and I used to also watch that in cupid but Hannah Barbara put it out well they're four seasons coming out on DVD it's a two-disc 13 episode collection where it has inky and blinky pinky Clyde and Sue and mesmer on who wants to take over pac-land and has vampire pakula and all kinds of yeah I forgot about pac-land that was a really interesting game it was kind of like a side scroller pac-man I have it yeah no I've it's in those Namco collections like the you know the ones that tend to come out on every system but I used to I also remember the Christmas special where Santa came down they had no idea what a human was yeah nice I had the pac-man board game growing up and it had like a million marbles it was all these fucking marbles that were little pellets I have the bedsheets awesome I bet it had remember miss pac-man was called pepper and there was pac-baby yeah nice I like super pac-man dude the arcade game for super pac-man is awesome anyhow Loki you know it's always great when you start off the story with a sigh it should not be a surprise that they're making another Skylanders game I mean really didn't you say this game was gonna tank yeah it should have tanked I underestimated how stupid the average consumer is my mistake and you know what if you bought this game you have yourself to blame this is why you're gonna get fucking expensive down I do I do not want to hear another fucking thing about oh those map packs are call of duty are too expensive this is your fucking fault for buying Skylanders this is why no more can you complain about DLC costs or the quantity so yes Skylanders Giants because hey how can we make Skylanders better I don't notice make larger figures that we could charge more for sounds like a plan bigger is better people will buy them because they're consumer whores and how so yes Skylanders Giants will be coming out later this year I think also for the Wii U probably at some point and I gotta be honest by looking at the screenshots which this game itself kinda looks like it could have been on the GameCube or the PlayStation 2 I mean pretty cheap I've heard good things about the game itself just the game not all this extra crap at the game itself I've heard decent things as a decent dungeon crawler it looks pretty cheap anyways so you can't go off the only the only thing they're changing is they're adding these giant fucking characters that do stuff and their money but hey guess what they're not going to force you to buy another goddamn portal you can still use your old portal so they're just gonna be twice as many skews I got a fucking set up thank God for that and it's so we're gonna have these giant fucking portal characters that you have to use with your regular Skylanders characters and I'm sure they're gonna have more characters go along with that and yeah so that's fantastic and I want to say they were the number one accessory item for games this month so congrats to you Skylanders for me I'm selling a lot and then of course there's going to be some Toys R Us exclusive items because they have signed a fucking blood pact with Activision to pimp these two children so once again I hope you're happy because you you folks that purchase Skylanders are going to be the downfall of the gaming industry when the inevitable video game crash happens was by the way there's big rumblings we're headed towards another video game crash because think about it if the Wii U and the Vita don't do very well it could lead to another crash and if the Wii U and the Vita don't do well people are just going to buy games the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 oh the world will end but I don't know things I'm reading I don't think anything could ever happen to the extent that it happened with Atari but if you look at the sales dude sales this January were way down compared to a year ago there's nothing coming out in January I'm not surprised they had they had one week of sales because all the game releases for January came out the last still have holdovers and people using their gift cards and all that but see normally January like last year January they had Darksiders which came out like in the first week they had Bayonetta they had actually been under my bed in the year before it was I think I think Bayonetta was a year before okay well one of these January's had Darksiders and Bayonetta and you know Alan was saying to me the other day why haven't they announced a sequel to Bayonetta yet it's a very good question it did well then of course there's a whole a Metal Gear game that now is basically no Metal Gear Bayonetta the Metal Gear game will come out eventually rebooted it totally rebooted it alright so yes Skylander Giants hip hip hooray one more story for you guys here and then we're gonna go to the Skype line and this one is also going to start off with a sigh sorry I gotta interrupt real quick here so yeah remember how I was saying that they're gonna have some exclusive stuff some of the characters they've run out of you know they have the legendary characters which sell for a lot more on eBay that's how you know how they're special and also they have now iridescent blue characters so they're like and we're not even gonna paint this one we're just gonna make it clear plastic and people spend more money for it alright I got one more story for you guys then we're gonna get to the sky plane and your Twitter topics so just a reminder here's your last chance to get those Twitter topics into twitter.com slash o LR this story is about another sigh huge sigh Ubisoft I I can't with this this is the whole DRM thing okay and you know they've gotten a lot of shit about this whole I thought they I thought that Ubisoft got rid of this DRM when the people started being up in arms about it but I guess that was just like moving forward and what I'm talking about is the whole you have to be online to play the game and if you get kicked offline you get kicked out of the game well what happened is that Ubisoft had to do an online server switch this past week and it locked people out of the games now granted they warned people you know this is gonna be happening so you won't be able to play your fucking game for a day the game that you bought it won't work for a day because we were too lazy to have a backup server in place or however these technical things work meaning driver San Francisco and so forth was unable to be signed into however driver San Francisco was not one of the games that Ubisoft originally said you will not be able to play so extra games got taken down on top of what Ubisoft originally said some games were still okay like Just Dance 3 and settlers online via Twitter Ubisoft says we apologize for the inconvenience it seems some of you can't connect to games announced as playable during migration we're on it and we'll keep you posted here in related news those that pirated these games experience no issues I don't think Just Dance would be part of it because that's not I think I think it was after the fact to no one gets to wiggle their but how about Assassin's Creed revelations there you go I think it's only PC tiles yeah so but but am I correct in saying Ubisoft does not not do this anymore right they will they don't care you're still gonna buy the next Assassin's Creed game people you're not gonna remember that they even did this I'm not but then again I hadn't bought by any of the others like does anyone remember the snafu with the whole like PlayStation Network where they they forgot to calculate a date correctly or something like that and so it knocked everything offline for like a day no one remembers that that's true that's true I remember the big fuss people made about that I wonder how many people forgot about the PlayStation hack by now I'm sure a lot of people have already forgotten a whole little PlayStation Network thing all right we are about ready to go to the skype line so go ahead one eight seven seven game OLR or our username on skype is orange lounge radio we're gonna go to the skype line it's already lighting up people are ready to call in and get through so let's go to the phones right now hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this hey this is Oscar what's up hey is it did you say it's a suka what ask us it's Oscar and a suka it's kind of weird but I respond to both it's all good it's a little bit of both well guys you never know what kind of folks are gonna call into orange lounge radio now we've been chatting a little bit this week so I think I think it's really cool that you're actually you're actually listening to the show and calling in tonight yeah it's a good buddy stand if it thanks for that he introduced me to OLR and I'm loving it so far thank you so much thank you Stan now for those that don't know who you are is there a place where folks may or may not have been seeing you this week yes um I actually appeared on the new season of the tester on the PlayStation Network I can't believe it guys after all this okay I I don't know if you know about some of our running jokes if Stan feels you in about the tester but when I originally gave my review on the tester season one way back when I talked about the tester and I actually said the tester is not bad like it's it's it's not like a great freakin show it's not like you know you're gonna be watching The Walking Dead or something but right as far as reality TV goes as far as a lot of the old g4 shows go the tester is not bad but as I'm talking about this Jamie's cat because we were doing the show at her house Shermie took a big dump all over the floor and so I think well there's Shermie's review well actually it's quite fitting because for those that might have seen the first episode Quajimonster gotten some deep shit literally because she started talking about farting and shitting and yeah what works what is up with this okay I gotta say I made a tweet right after I watched the first episode cuz you I look I love video games and I love trashy reality TV so I'm not gonna lie I did watch the tester all right judge me all you want I don't give a fuck all right it's not as bad as being on the tester trust me wow we've got to get into this a little bit but okay okay but here's the thing I'm watching it and I'm like these they all have potty mouths it was like watching there was an episode of South Park called it hits the fan where they hype up in the whole episode dude they're gonna say shit on Chicago hope tonight they're gonna say shit and then like it turns into they say one shit to now it's like mush shit TV and they say the word shit like 200 times and I'm watching the first episode of tester and I hear shit dropped like literally 1520 times during the show my game you hear me go that's bullshit and there's there is an awesome story about that it's in regards to what somebody said so might stop by next week to talk about it it's a good story but yeah there's a lot of shit being dropped left and right Wow but yet they bleep fuck I don't know sorry to the guy who didn't like cursing I'm very sorry but you know it's just look they say it on PlayStation Network all right yeah for real you you were actually on the tester and it's funny because we joked about getting dark soccer to apply next year I applied a little bit of a whim and I actually the reason I decided to go for the tester was way back when sci-fi did WCG ultimate gamer I said why not I'll try I made it to like the final 42 people and didn't make that show because apparently I wasn't like cool enough so screw them and then the tester started applying or started the application process for season three I said why not next I know I'm getting a phone call saying yeah we're flying you out to Los Angeles and you're gonna be on the tester like oh shit you just got picked like there wasn't a lot of like screening and whittling down there's it's the whole process starts in about there started about mid August I want to say and I put up a profile really quickly I said you know I need to think of what what's gonna get me noticed I figured okay how many people are the combination of a chemist plays roller derby and has like a trophy level of 18 not many so I use that and then within a day of putting that up I had a producer calling me say hey you want to do some interviews with you check you out and then the Skype interview had to wait a month of like no contact from them and then all of a sudden mid-october I get a call from the executive producer saying yeah you're still in the running here's a contract sign your life away once to do that we'll do another interview and I found out I was flying to LA about mmm four or five days before filming began so it's a long process but just a lot of interviews and waiting but I get the sense that the whole process of recording the show itself is really quick like you know I know there's a lot of TV magic but you know I could kind of tell that they're probably doing like multiple challenges in a day and the whole no actually no really no it's every episode is literally one day of filming huh it's back to back to back to back about like 15 18 hours worth of filming crammed into one little half hour Wow there's a lot of awesomeness but they try to keep the drama and my case a picture of a cockroach trying to go like ass to mouth to me which was great now because I know Loki and don't start a dark soccer don't watch the tester this week the challenge no no no I saw do you watch I was a night and I had a joke ready too so basically I'm like say be glad that they're just you know you know they're they're doing the analogy where it's you know you have to keep your head in a case of bugs you know because you're squashing bugs or whatever thank God you're not testing for Bethesda where you'd have to jump in a fun swimming pool full of cockroaches well the thing is if you're testing for Bethesda there would be no bugs because apparently they don't see them when they test them they just leave them in the game you know my honest-to-god reaction when I saw that on the show though I said dark soccer would have been first out she would have been first out she put your hand no they had to they had to have their head in this case full of bugs and they're pouring cockroaches because because they wanted to see who can interview under pressure and I was like dark soccer would have been telling that guy off like I put my head no bugs well what's funny is like we have our this one guy Jay Titan he's this big rough-and-tough trash talk and like knows the shit and then as soon as we find out it's the roaches we go back into the loft as they're doing us they're doing each person for the challenge one at a time he starts freaking out back in the loft like scream I quit and he was probably one of the next to last people to go and all of us are coming back oh it's fine you'll be fine he's almost starting to like shake from nervousness he's that terrified of bugs so that would have been me I would have been crying I would have been screaming I would have been threatening calls to my lawyer but then I would have just done it you know I would have been like alright just fucking get in the zone don't think about it don't think about it don't think I'm fucking thinking about it don't think about it like the hardest part was just well for me I the way they fell down my hair started going in my face so I had like at one point almost a dozen roaches just checking out my face like you know I'm gonna sit right in front of her so she can't see anything you know it would freak them out you start munching off actually actually we were totally weren't allowed to eat them ah there was like this roach wrangler or this guy that owned the roaches and they were his like precious little babies and we couldn't do any harm to him what was his name Joe and did he have an apartment I wouldn't be surprised if it's probably him the only one that remembers Joe's apartment I remember Joe's apartment singing roaches so I I have to I I know there's probably tons you want to talk about but of course I I'm gonna steer the conversation but I'm take over I felt bad for the girl they sent home I get oh I shouldn't ruin it for those that watched it my bad but I I like that the person that they sent home seemed I don't agree with that I completely disagree with sending the person they sent home she that person seemed really nice to me and I was like that seemed I'm surprised that person's not listening to OLR cuz like that seemed like the kind of person that would like be like I would be friends with like for real so I kind of felt bad for them she's like she was the one of the coolest cats in the loft I mean like she just the first thing we noticed by her she had this giant like tail that she brought with and okay you're awesome and actually we were aligned or we were getting into the vans to head to the law for filming she originally had on this Voltron t-shirt that they took away from her because you couldn't like have copyrighted material that wasn't first party Sony cuz wah wah wah whatever but I'm just looking at going I like her so we spent a good like our just talking about Voltron and it's I was so sad to see her go and considering it was either like the person that either didn't like wasn't memorable the person that talked about shit the whole time but that's home the person talked about shit that that's just me that's reality TV I'm kind of you know I'm kind of looking at it going you know it sounds like you are the real deal you're legit your intentions I mean am I correct you really did want to work for Sony right like oh my god yeah they're in a later episode you'll see just how much I I would have killed or I did I get my dream job it's like I can't really say which way how or which way it fell but right sure no I understand and listeners please do respect that she's under contract can't say if she wins or got told to sashay away sued so yeah all five people that watch the show I mean I don't know like it's kind of a joke that like no one watches the tester but yet here I am I I I admit I watch it and you know I gotta say all joking aside what they're doing there is interesting because it really is the only show right now that I can think of that's produced exclusively for a gaming console you don't have anything like it on Nintendo you don't have anything like it otherwise on Sony you'd certainly don't have anything like it on Xbox especially since one versus a hundred isn't around anymore which was a different kind of thing anyway right but no it it's I mean like I said they originally did that that the BC ultimate gamer but that kind of flopped after two seasons but even then it wasn't entirely Xbox I think season two had some we crap in it that no one cared about but yeah it's when I tell people that it's exclusively on PlayStation Network you can't download the episodes on your computer via the tester calm or crackle calm but yeah just the fact that it's produced by Sony for Sony promoting Sony it's very unique in that sound so here's a question though Rob is since you mentioned crackle calm crackle they have the actual utility on or the app on the 360 so could you watch a tester on the 360 can actually watch the tester on the 360 I've tried it and it is possible so yeah I kind of got a personal kick a lot of that zenacorn our term is do you have to pay to see the tester no it's it's no we free trust me would you want to pay to see the tester I love that you're deprecated I I don't know I again I know you can't tell me which way but the way you talk about it sometimes makes me think it might not a one just looking at the first episode there it's supposed to be a double elimination but it wasn't a little bit of spoiler there but it was a single elimination and with who was clearly supposed to go home when he or she didn't that pissed me off like throwing a little shade Lee bullshit what happened there so I'm getting I'm getting the sense that maybe you're you're still kind of friends with some of these folks like maybe the person we were talking about earlier who got kicked off before their time but maybe not with yeah I we have this like yes I talked she's actually going to a like a giant world cosplay competition so good luck to her but um yeah we have this secret tester we call it the tester lounge on fake book as I call it because Facebook is but yeah like people from all three seasons Brent go keys in it Meredith Adrian side note Meredith knows her shit about games like it surprised all of us how much she knew about it so that was awesome but yeah we we talk all the time and as a matter of fact once the cast was announced Mo chocolate from season 2 reached out to all of us it's like whoa what's up my mo nice to meet you let's video chat on Skype and I'm just going oh my god you're you were you're Mo chocolate and you're talking to me holy crap and we've become the best of friends since then so it's pretty cool that is that is awesome what sounds like you at the end of the day you know no matter what's happening on the show you you good or bad you had a good experience and you met a lot of great people out of it sounds like so oh my god it I it's something that I could never like forget I mean I never thought I would be doing something like that efforts I'm not the most outgoing person I'm a gamer I'm a little bit shy a little bit of a closet dweller but it just blew my mind in terms of awesomeness and oh my god I look on the TV that I've muted and it's Whitney Houston changing that's why people watch the tester to get away from CNN and the witness that's it we need to hang out I had to catch a predator on and then all of a sudden it became Whitney Houston I'm like I can't see the sake but let's turn on something equally that's what I have you know what's funny and I swear I'm not just I I swear I'm not just saying this because I had no idea that you were gonna read like I know Stan had told me like hey I know someone on the show and I was like okay cool like I didn't I guess you guys must be pretty close because here you are actually listening to orange lounge radio but at first I was like oh neat it's kind of fun to know somebody who got to do you know a rare experience like that but when when I saw you specifically on the show I actually thought I was like that's the girl they have instead of dark Sakura I really did I really think that because you guys kind of strike me as having stuff in common so well maybe I'll do it next year if I don't have a job I had a job or have have had a job as a chemist so they even asked me would you be okay with giving up your current job I said hmm work in a lab or work at Santa Monica let me think yes yes I would be okay with that okay thanks I'm a designer so I was like I can do all of your booklets it's a good way to get your foot in the door as I understand the the guy that won the very first season was only like a tester for like what six months and now he's like in marketing or something and I know that guy isn't the whole six months thing is what they don't tell you is it's for a six month contract mmm it's so like kicking the groin cuz after Meredith like tells about the prize that you could win you're all excited and they cut the scene then this one random crew member comes out and they go alright this is just a reminder the prizes you got the ps3 the money the TV blah blah blah blah and just you know the job as a tester is a six-month contract at which point somebody may or may not keep you okay keep filming all going and the same thing for this season it's like the Santa Monica thing six-month contract and then the cars for two-year lease all right let's see some enthusiasm cars going funny Wow no stand in the chat says I'm sure Rob thought I was making stuff up no I didn't think you were making stuff up I just thought you know some like sometimes like you you might know somebody like oh I knew I went to high school with that person and after the six-month period we're gonna have your memory erased just look into this pen let me put on my sunglasses oh god um let's god what else was I gonna ask I know something escapes me I don't know it was just one episodes aired and I'm sure there's plenty more you've really got to bite your tongue on but we'll well hopefully you'll decide to keep listening to olr and we can get some more dirt on the tester I look we're probably the only podcast that talks about this show there's a few out there actually totally don't want to plug it but kind of have to since Greg Miller was a guest judge this season sure he's actually having all of the cast members as they're booted off the show on the beyond podcast so all right whatever I get kicked off or when I win I'll be on there and I'll I'll see if I can put in a well our show for you guys that's awesome see you know you don't have to say the final thing that kept me from applying really was that I don't want to live in LA except for being close to Disneyland well I figured it would be nice to actually like enjoy non sub zero temperatures like I am right now because I'm in Milwaukee not really the best weather capital of the world so I think it'd be a nice change you live relatively close to good friends of ours yeah you live right by these olr lesbians located in Wisconsin in Madison in that case they should come to my roller derby bouts I actually play for the Brew City Bruisers in Milwaukee so if you guys are listening come to our fucking bouts I have a good a really good friend of mine just recently got into that whole roller derby thing and she's loving it you know actually a friend of mine from one of my classes two semesters ago tried to get me into their league in Sacramento Sacramento League yeah I could see however my bad ankle kind of keeps me from doing it don't oh I I have like horrible ankles I actually tore my PCL on my left knee so I have to wear this like Robo Bryce of death and I still do it it's it sounds like you might make me to make quite the scene you know you could be the Android of the scapes pretty much all right well unfortunately I gotta I gotta wrap things up we've had you on for like 20 minutes it's way longer we have those colors but you're you're special cuz you're you know you got the whole whole tie-in does like something that's going on right now but um please do I hope you're able to listen again and call us with updates so we can dish especially when the whole thing's over then we don't really dish and we can really dish yes I have so many fun stories so I can't wait can't wait I will make it a point to catch the episodes so that it's not just one person now you have a rosie's advance I do every now it's like someone from olr is on I mean in the way it might have happened in the reverse order but so it's it now that she's listening to olr she's she's kind of a member of the oil army here a few minutes out of my week 22 minutes you can do it Rob takes that 20 minutes out of his busy rating schedule okay I know it's like but I with all due respect I watched drag race first then the tester so nice all right good combo you out there all right well Oscar thank you so much for calling in I I hope to hell you win but you know I I yeah I hope to hell you win let's just put it that way yes I will definitely be coming back next week in the week after and you can't get rid of me now I'm sorry awesome she's joining army we've used the olr me duct tape just don't tell him Stan all right all right take care have a good one take care bye you mentioning sure me now I'm gonna have to go home and clean a big pile of crap up off the laundry room floor I cuz sure me has her in bedroom y'all I love that she's so delts like self-deprecating about the whole thing like the I and it sounds to me I mean I could be wrong but it sounds to me based on the whole like Facebook group they've got going on or where fake book as she called it that it sounds like they're all kind of in on the joke like yeah you know it's the tester and that's that's pretty awesome you know they they accept it for what it is so that's awesome but I'll tell you what you know what again I and I do stand by this I said this before and I'll say it now the tester it's not a TV show that's going to change your life it's not the best thing on television but you know what for something in the background it is probably more entertaining than a lot of shows that have been about video gaming in the past so there you go 1 8 7 7 game olr or our username on Skype is orange a lounge radio if you want to give us a call you can go for that right now we've got time to take a couple more calls I know that call went on a long time but we'll get at least one or two more other people on the show in the meantime let's read some Twitter topics at twitter.com slash olr 13x4 ever sent us a tweet this week that says hey olr how about five game music albums for whatever price you wish to pay how about 13 plus albums for $10 or more and he's referring to the game music bundle.com it's another one of those indie bundles you know that whole thing's been very popular lately and yeah you can donate their money and get soundtracks so if you're a game music fan it sounds like they have all different types of games included in that and they add more soundtracks as more people donate so interesting let's go to the phones because we have more people calling in hi you're on orange launch radio who's this yo what up guys it's Zina Korp from the UKC how you doing hey Zina Korp from Oklahoma City unless OKC stands for something else what's up you're pretty worried about money hey by the way just want to say the Thunder losing to the Kings dude dude the Thunder lost to the Kings that's do you watch basketball who the hell the Thunder never mind all right never mind that I'll pay tips of that fucking team they paying me fucking let me just say the Thunder right now is the best team in the league and they fucking lost to the Kings the Sacramento King pretty funny everybody here in Sacramento is just laughing cuz like the Kings suck and you guys anyway I won't make this about basketball what's on your mind Zina Korp that much not much just been playing the hell out of League of Legends for some reason you know it's funny you bring that up Twitter asked us a question here about League of Legends so I can kind of tie this together awesome her sent us a tweet said have you guys ever played League of Legends it's an extremely popular free online game that I've never heard you mention on the show which is funny because we did end up mentioning it at the top of the show during the Dota thing but he's right I I personally have not played League of Legends myself but Zina Korp sounds like you're a fan yeah I've been playing it for a while now finally got my account maxed out so I can actually compete with some of the other characters in the game like the whole thing with the multiplayer online battle arenas at least that's the genre it's been labeled as the MOBAs is it since it's all team based there's a lot of rage in there more so than you might see in the first-person shooter so I can only play it for about an hour and then a little 12 year olds get on my nerves but other than that the game itself is pretty fun I can only imagine like the League of Legends one of those games I think I would enjoy more if I just played it with like only people I know but um one thing I do notice is that it's a hugely popular game to be streamed on those video game streaming websites like twitch TV I always see League of Legends stuff going on on there yeah actually started playing Heroes of Newark just because it looked this looks more polished you know cuz they acted the higher resolutions and all this other stuff your interface was better but I couldn't find any like pro content or even games being played so I could learn how to play it but there's tons of League of Legends stuff so I started watching that here here and there like pro coverage and just some guys casting their games because that's how I got into Starcraft is when everybody was casting it during the beta and I'd started playing it out and once I figured out how it worked it was pretty fun it's the only really competitive game that I play so I'm pretty much done with first-person shooters as far as I'm concerned let me back up a minute because this is the question I should have asked you first like for those that aren't familiar with League of Legends this ossifer kind of insinuates we are in on the Twitter what what is what makes this game addicting what makes you stick it out through the 12 year olds as long as you can for this okay so you're familiar with the interface that Starcraft and them use right so you got your your mouse control you're right-clicking on things moving them around this one you're locked in a one single character alright so you play one character there's about I think just under a hundred if not just a little over a hundred characters to choose from they all have different abilities some yeah think of your standard role-playing game party they have characters that fit each role that's in the game your healer your magic user your Archer sure yeah this one is this street attack damage you have your attack power which are your magical abilities you have your tanks and you have your junglers of the guys who don't sit in the main action of the game running around in the assisting everybody else to sum it up here real quick and you just keep used it's tower defense so you have three lines of towers and a large crystal that you defend if you kill the other guys crystal you win or they can surrender and give up okay it's not hard to learn but it takes patience to learn how to play each character because they're all a little bit different there's like I think right puts out a teaser video on each one of the characters they release that tell you all about how to use their powers and just that any other thing so just if you want to learn one there's plenty of resources to do so you know I gotta admit part of what is scary to me in sorts about League of Legends that I am afraid of of signing on there and that just getting owned by twelve-year olds right off the bat cuz there's no way to practice like is there any type of like practice learning curve like kinda way to ease yourself into this game before you have to play against the hardcore people yeah well you can't really play with the hardcore guys cuz they're mainly doing ranked matches right matches you can't even touch until you max out your account they keeps track of your players skill and how long you've been playing up to level 30 so it'll take you about a good four or five months before you can even touch the rank stuff so you don't have to worry about it and the matching is pretty good so balances the team based off of the level base and how many wins they have okay that's a little better so in the very beginning you'll see rookie stuff happening left and right like when you think about it's like that doesn't make any sense why is it gonna go close to that when he knows he's gonna die because he's a rookie and he doesn't know any better they say exactly why so you'll see that and as you your level goes up the quality of your games will go up as far as who you're matched with and once you reach level 30 you're pretty much like you can pretty much play any role because you've been playing the game enough in order to do so and it's free you don't have to put any money into it whatsoever I like free I do like free let me ask this um what do you think about the whole dota stuff that we were talking about earlier in the show with Blizzard and valve going at each other over dota I mean it seems like you're kind of getting into these games now do you do you have a preference on what you want to see happen with the dota name or well to sum them all up dota and dota 2 and what blizzard I think is trying to do in heroes a new earth follow the original model the original model is not newbie friendly there's a lot of step game is very complex I mean you take just five on five guys in the Starcraft environment fighting each other and you add the crafting system and how you build bigger items you worry about the concepts of feeding other players just running and killing so they get gold because they're killing you off left or right which unbalances the whole game and then everybody's screaming new bet you this that and the other thing there's a lot of craft to remember for the all those but some people like that complexity League of Legends is a lot simpler it's easier to get into and the matches don't potentially don't last as long because there's a level cap during the game your character can only get up to level 18 I think and all the others and go up to 25 30 before they start capping out so the game is forced to a conclusion usually one game will not go any longer than an hour even as a newbie all right so it sounds like there's a lot of even though you know we kind of say these games all have the same roots there's still a lot of mechanic mechanical differences between them so yeah at the core of the same but one is very newbie friendly the other one just let the pros deal with it don't even bother all right xenocore anything else you want to share with listeners for we take another call yeah actually now if you get it uh to go order from the Olive Garden they give you a whole freaking roll of drumstick or breadsticks man that's awesome I got five in the fridge go eat for breakfast I heard you know I heard I heard a random story that that the Olive Garden is having image problems right now I can't imagine why but they're gonna be like they're actually gonna like change their restaurants they're going through like a JC penny crisis right now or they're gonna like totally rebrand the Olive Garden yeah it's weird cuz no one's really going there anymore yeah well the Olive Garden's kind of like become a joke now like a freaking corporate man you can go ahead and see some old Italian dude cooking in the back speaking Italian than half these joints around here so I'd rather go there exactly exactly all right well xenocore enjoy those breadsticks but I gotta let you go so we can take a few more calls and good luck all right your illegal I'm out of here thanks for having me on hey no problem take care buddy all right one eight seven seven game olr our username on skype is orange lounge radio let me get a few more Twitter topics out of the way before the next call comes in let's see we have do do do do do do dark to see you tweets us this is bad news for Loki guess who's working on haptic technology Apple what is the haptic technology I'm oh it's a ready player one reference touching stuff oh he tweets us a story about I guess apples working on this right now good for them Apple is playing around in the space now adding teeth to speculation it may soon launch high-end TV sets with glasses less 3d god all you ever hear about are these Apple TV sets that are all the rumor right now I don't know what an Apple TV interest you in the least Loki no I'm not I'm not one okay listen I'm not your normal Apple consumer that like oh I will release something I go out to the store right now I go bye go bye go bye go bye I mean like that that is that's your usual consumer I I am the other hand have a TV I have two TVs one of which I use one of which I don't use I do not need a third TV all right I gotta wrap it up and go to the phone because we have another call hi you're on orange launch radio is this it's the one and only Rama hey Rama sorry you had to sit there on the line and listen to more of Loki's ranting bad timing you have to I enjoy Loki's ranting about Apple since my new roommate is Apple fanboy so you know well what's up buddy not too much but Rob I have a bone to pick with you again you have a boner to pick with me that's hot okay first we have balls now we have boners okay what's up what's up what's up Rama Rob you're a dick why what I do now talk about balls you are a dick talking about balls man you got some nerve that's what I do here on the show is help it land in the toilet yes but we should leave the talking of balls David Bowie since he fondles them on a regular basis stop that all you really want come on my show make balls jokes no I also want to compliment your hair so you look you look like Riker look we don't have a webcam you don't know what my hair looks like right now I've been napping why do I ask this question can we what hair what since the studio is at your house can we get to all our cam back I've thought about it I've seriously thought about it but it's kind of a pain in the butt to hook up and we're probably gonna be moving in June anyway so probably after that because we'll have a more proper studio set up at that point it's like the studio is like a nomad isn't it maybe for your 10-year present olr listeners because our birthdays in June too it plays Genesis games I have a thing that plays Genesis games it's called a Genesis what am I gonna do with you Rama all right anything else you want to I filthy up the show it tonight how bad the beat is gonna fall flat on its face no now you're throwing some shade this is good this is these are the types of calls I like why is the Vita gonna fall flat on its face Rama I can't as much as I want the system I can't see myself shelling out two hundred and fifty dollars for this thing I just can't I mean Nintendo learned their lesson like pretty quickly with the price drop Sony will just stand there all right just say that it's okay it's a cop it's okay there's nothing wrong with the price for me for a year before it falls if that all right let's look at let's look at the technology with you know the DS and the 3ds I mean if you put those side to side and you know is you give it to somebody like okay why are these the same thing so I mean really all they added with the 3ds is an analog nub and 3d and the 3d is just kind of it and their launch lineup was kind of meh so that's why the 3ds flopped is because they didn't have a good launch lineup didn't have any big franchise I'm sorry Nintendogs fucking porting Nintendogs I'm not even gonna call it a new game and adding cats because some people have cats is not a fucking launch game I mean that's just terrible and pilot wings is kind of ho hum it was three three activities that you could do on woohoo Island that no one gives a shit about woohoo Island is not fucking character Mario is a character link is a character woohoo Island no one gives a shit I want woohoo Island to be a fighter in the next Smash Brothers I would like to see that but that's not gonna happen but um so that's why it tanked is because of that and I know people think it may tank again because it didn't do so well in Japan but Japanese people are fickle they they like some things they don't like some things they like dating sim games we don't like dating sim games I don't know it's just weird so um I think it has a good chance because their launch lineup is fucking awesome I mean they've got a lot of games coming out and it's not like hey look here's our launch lineup and then we have one 3ds game coming out each month I mean we're talking like a lot of games and it's gonna be Vita Vita Vita all I will say PlayStation does seem to have really good third-party support out the gate as opposed to third-party support eventually and and it's also pretty you know powerful technology wise I mean the screen looks nice it's got dual analog sticks which is gonna be great for porting games over or creating you know first-person shooter games and that kind of stuff because you actually have some decent controls there except you know unlike the 3ds where you're gonna force people to use the analog stick and then the touchscreen and oh it's very fucking uncomfortable so let's throw in the stand we're gonna have a kickstand on this fucker that we're gonna put out with this game because it's just not gonna work well yeah that's stupid if you've got to add accessories to your stupid system because oh I forgot to put some buttons on there and oh this is really fucking uncomfortable to hold then then you got a problem all right Rama he's made his case we'll see we'll see a lot a lot of questions to be answered over the next month and see what the numbers look like when the system comes out all right Rama anything else quickly before we let you go I'm kind of floored because I actually agree with Loki on that hmm I mean I do and I understand where he's coming from I mean the Vita is a much more powerful system it it's there but the way I see it is that the consumers can look at like I could do all this look at the price put it down and they can go pick up a 3ds or something like that I think that's what it's coming down to right about now it's all about the price point yeah but people are comfortable in pain that's kinds of price points because people are buying tablets and they're buying all this other electronic garbage that's really expensive well the price point is not that big a deal anymore well I don't know about that most people are buying tablets or iPad users because they're buying because it's an iPad you know people people shell out that type of money but you know but iPads aren't the only tablets out there and there's definitely plenty of them being sold yeah but those are but those tablets cost less or less expensive than the iPad I mean okay between a $500 iPad and a $200 Kindle fire I'll I will drop 200 on the Kindle fire so you'll drop $200 on a Kindle fire but you won't drop $200 on a fucking via I see how it is no no no no you get my words twisted Loki but I respect you for that all right I have to put it into this we got to wrap up the show right all right Rama thank you very much for your call good luck no problem take care later run John all right well he didn't hear that he'll hear it on the air all right so really the Skype was really you gotta buy a system that's less less expensive than the other system that's how it is so I mean that's that's the argument me well you know the iPads $500 so you know spending $250 on this tablet it's not that big a deal wait what doesn't make any sense all right we got to wrap up the show we ran long tonight but that's okay why it was worth it for the phone call with Aska earlier on it was fun so I'm who I've been chatting but I knew you would I need to be braiding each other's hair within minutes this is a matter of time all right hitting each other with pellas on the party all right anyway we got to we got to wrap it up we got to wrap up the show and be on out of here for the night so let's go around and get everybody's oh I didn't do all the tweets damn it damn it damn it quickly because there were some I really wanted to read act deft says beat hazard ultra is now on iOS if you know the beat hazard games which are actually a lot of I do love beat hazard on the PC on via steam so I'm going to definitely check this out now that I know it's on iOS I don't see a price here in the story but I wanted to say I read somewhere it was like $2.99 and it will work with all the stuff that's on your ios device that's pretty cool a couple quick ones from tiger claw I think the sonic and Sega all-stars you mentioned during quickfire news let me read this other one from tiger claw 305 on Twitter twisted metal promotion blows up sweet tooth truck let's see I guess this is a promotion for twisted metal where you get to destroy thing fans can sign up for a chance to remotely fire m249 saw machine guns at the real-life version of the ice cream truck driven by sweet tooth the game's fire haired clown faced antagonists they've hooked guns up to a satellite so you can control them remotely from your computer what you could shoot a real gun with real bullets at a real truck from your computer go to shoot my truck calm for a chance to pull the trigger or it's just a video of that trick it's a dirty trick all right that does it for the tweets tonight thank you guys to the Twitter topics now we're gonna wrap up the show all right we're gonna go around to your base final thoughts oh actually last minute stories I'm sorry Loki I'm sorry I'm not doing your last minute story I think give me your final thought I've got this song for cage match all right it's gonna be awesome can't wait can't wait dark
