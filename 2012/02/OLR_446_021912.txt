Sky, and Loki.
Tonight, February 19th, 2012, Capcom makes the same mistake twice.
Sony plans a movie for one of its franchises, and one company is rumored to be working on a new Ninja Turtles game.
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
We are live on this February the 19th of 2012 with episode number 446 of our show.
We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
Wow!
See ya.
Alright.
Also joining us tonight, I don't know if he's caffeinated, but say hello to Tech Master Loki.
I think I'm caffeinated.
This has caffeine in it.
You do have a jumbo little soda.
What soda is that?
It's more ice and soda.
It's the McDonald's ripoff there.
There you go.
So anyway, join us live.
If you are listening live here at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at all games, join our chat room.
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com is where you can interact with us because, of course, it is the show where every gamer has a voice.
We do like to read your voices throughout the show.
We'll take your calls later, read your emails, and all that good stuff.
Looking at our chat, we see some people are celebrating being able to be here live tonight because they have tomorrow off.
And I totally forgot that it's a three-day weekend.
So happy President's Day, I suppose, but I don't have tomorrow off.
Me neither.
Isn't that weird?
I have tomorrow off.
Always ruining my party.
Because I'm fun employed.
You have every day off.
But yeah, what's up with that?
We don't get President's Day off.
I did at my old company, too.
Well, I think the deal is, unless you're a bank or a school or something, your company either does Martin Luther King Day in January, which mine does.
I don't get that either.
Really?
Well, then you just got screwed.
I don't know what to tell you.
One place I was with, we used to get floaters for the major bank holidays.
Yeah, we have what's called a floating holiday, too, in place of Veterans Day.
We don't get Veterans Day off, but we can take a floating holiday anytime during the year, which I usually use to cover my E3 trip, the years I've gone.
I don't know if that'll happen this year, but you know what I'm...
D3
Yeah, yeah, seriously.
I'm at like the Disney convention.
But I am seriously, seriously, I haven't done this convention in four years.
But this year, I really, really, really, of course, so much of this depends on finances.
I want to do PAX this year.
So I'm definitely looking into doing that.
PAX West, of course.
The last PAX I went to was the first PAX East a couple years ago.
I would love to go if someone would finance me.
Well, we don't have OLR funds anymore.
We could do the Kickstarter thing It works for Double Fine Kickstarter so I can go to PAX Donate $20 and DarkSakura will sign your butt There you go At PAX
All right, we'll figure something out.
Anyhow, let's talk games, video games, and this week, of course, the big, big story in gaming, PlayStation Vita.
No one care.
Why do you, come on.
Kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding.
I'm like, are you insane?
You saw that screen, too.
That's a beautiful screen.
It was pretty, but.
That's the first time you've seen the Vita, right?
What I'm referring to, Loki, is an early adopter of the Vita.
The Vita early adopter program started this week.
Very strange for a console launch.
I don't remember any console doing this before, but it's the whole like, pay an extra $50 and get it a week early.
Yeah, you get like a case and a crappy game.
And yeah, Little Deviants is not a good game.
Yeah.
It's a terrible game, to be honest.
Yeah, I have not heard a good thing about Little Deviants.
So what made you take the plunge to get the early Vita?
Yeah.
I just wanted the Vita.
I decided I was going to sell my 3DS, and so I did that, and I bought a Vita, and I'm glad I did.
I think I'm going to get a lot more use out of this than I will ever my 3DS.
What is making you think those early signs?
With the 3DS, it was just kind of like, ooh, 3D.
And then that kind of wore off really fast.
And then it was like, ooh, it's just a DS with an analog stick.
I just didn't really play anything on there.
I played a couple of the launch games, which are kind of like, okay, Pilotwings, fun.
Or Street Fighter was all right, but it wasn't really kind of something I...
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
I mean, I was afraid that it was going to go kind of the way of the Wii.
You just didn't have enough people to swap note with.
That was the problem.
You needed more 3D cats in your life.
I just added like three chatters to my 3DS friends list tonight.
In fact, I need to send them cats.
As soon as I get the confirmation that they've all added me back, 3D cats.
That's why you hang on to the 3DS.
Swap note.
Revolutionary.
No, no.
I'm sorry.
That's not why.
It's like 3D email.
And then the virtual console stuff is kind of cool, but once again, it's like, okay, yeah, neat.
I can play NES games on another system.
But I don't really need to play NES games.
If I really want to play Nintendo games, I can play them on my PC, I can play them on my Wii, I can play them on almost anything, my PSP.
Well, for me, I wanted to hang on to the 3DS mostly because a system is only as good as the games that are on it, and I know you are not as invested in the lineup, but remember, I thought Mario 3D Land was one of the best games that came out last year.
I put it in my top three for the year, and I think it's a fantastic game, and I don't really want to part with it yet, and I don't know, like I'm...
Nintendo is getting really good at this whole stealthy launch.
I think at E3 there's going to be some more titles that are announced that will be bang up.
I'm hoping the Smash Bros.
game.
But we'll see.
I'm not going to get my hopes up.
I'm not really... I'm not worried about the Smash Bros.
game.
If I really want a Smash Bros.
game like that, I can play it on the Wii U or something.
And honestly, Smash Bros.
was fun for a while on the Wii, and then I just didn't play it anymore.
So I'm not...
I don't know, I just don't see myself doing that.
Walk us through a little bit of opening up the Vita for the first time, because my understanding is, A, it doesn't function at all like a PlayStation, because the cross-media bar's not there, and B, it has this whole, like, welcome park or something it's called that's supposed to orient you to the system?
I have not even touched that yet, to be honest.
All right, fine.
But yeah, there's the welcome park thing.
Basically, as with most, like, systems out there nowadays, when you first get the Vita, you have to do a system update.
So you perform the system update and you update to 1.6.
And then you set up everything, your PlayStation Network stuff, if you have an account or whatever.
I had to reset the password on mine because it had been so long since I logged into the PlayStation Network.
I had forgotten my password, although I hadn't really forgotten my password.
It was just forcing me to reset my password because I apparently haven't.
No, actually, no, I must have reset my password at one point because I downloaded those.
Sorry, we broke the PlayStation Network for a month.
I had trouble recalling my password after that, too, because they had so many freaking rules on the password.
I had to think of something that fell into those because my old password, without trying to give it away, well, I don't use it anymore, but it broke one of the rules.
So I had to really think.
Well, I finally remembered what it was.
It was just, there was a capital letter in there somewhere.
So I was like, ah, okay, I forgot.
So I went ahead and did that.
And so I got that all taken care of.
And then I pretty much, what I did, because I actually got it on Valentine's Day.
Because, you know, I'm cool like that.
And so there wasn't really much on the PlayStation Network store to download.
I mean, it was...
and so on.
It's gorgeous.
That was the first thing I noticed.
You know, the screen's just amazing looking, and the touchscreen stuff works great.
You know, I don't even really care that it's the little bubbles on there.
I mean, it's... Just the way it functions is really smooth, so that's kind of cool.
The near thing's neat, although I'm not really sure what the point of it is yet.
I mean, I know I unlocked some things, and I can see some random people around there, and I get...
I get these really off-the-wall random friend requests and I don't even know who these people are.
Is it because you're showing up on the near thing or whatever it's called?
Yeah, I think it is.
Interesting.
I don't know who they are.
Like, someone sent me a message like, okay, maybe it's gonna say, hey, I'm Alyssa or something and it was like, sup?
I'm like, that doesn't fucking help.
I don't know who you are.
Yeah, that's a good point.
If that whole random stuff's going to happen and you want to add us on PlayStation Network, you might want to say you're a listener.
That way we know you're not a random... Does that thing show where you live?
It's not going to give that away, right?
No, it'll say you're... And it's not even...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Um, you, well, you can see, like, popularity of certain games, like, it'll change, you know, um, like, oh, okay, you know, Katamari's, you know, going up, or, I don't know.
What, what, what is popular in your town, Orangevale, or whatever?
I don't even know, it, well, it just shows, seems to show the stuff that I have, like, I'm gonna pull it up right now, and we'll see what's popular right here.
Just going to our chatroom at chat.orange.com, Tigerclaw says, Sky on swap note now.
Yes, I saw that all the chatters added me, so I sent some cat pictures.
Now, Tigerclaw, because you were already on my list, you already saw these same notes.
I went back and sent some old notes.
Because I don't have new 3D cat pictures, but I will get some soon.
So there's your 3D cat update.
Back to the Vita.
Thanks for watching!
and showing popularity surge.
There are five people playing Katamari.
Topping the charts, the number of people for Lil Deviants.
And topping the charts, 18 people playing Lil Deviants and Katamari, Luminous.
I think it's just showing the stuff I've played because that's what it seems like that's happening there.
Daredevil Onion
Somebody, they sent me like a track part.
That sounds like what DarkSakura had for lunch today.
So I will download your track part, but I don't know who that is, so that doesn't really help me.
Yeah, so, I mean, I still don't really know what the functionality of this is supposed to be.
I can see some people that are playing nearby, but I just don't really understand what this is all about yet.
Oh, here we go.
I think I can... Units of distance.
There we go.
I knew you could get it in Miles.
There you go.
So, there's that.
Tell us a little bit about the games, quickly.
You've played Rayman.
You were raving about the graphics in Rayman, right?
Rayman I actually haven't played too much of yet.
I just like, ooh, pretty graphics and I went on and played something else.
But yeah, Rayman's really, really gorgeous.
I mean, Rayman Origins on the console looked great and I'd say it's exactly like the console.
I mean, that level of detail is there and it's just...
I got Luminous
Although you can just spam the back of your system to unlock it as well.
So I don't really know that point of that.
The music in it is alright.
Although most of it I don't recognize.
And most of it isn't as epic as I thought it would be.
But there's some still good ones in there.
Like there's... What was it?
Window Licker is in there.
And that's awesome.
And there's some other...
Some other songs that I've recognized.
Yeah, I heard something about a whole new kind of block that will shuffle block colors around it.
Yeah, there's a block that will shuffle some of the stuff on there.
There's also the blocks that you can drop.
Well, the power-up that you start off with the default avatar allows you to... It'll break anything of the same color that's touching it.
So you can...
You know, eliminate a lot of stuff on there.
Which was the old Luminous game, if I remember right.
Yes, I think they have that.
So, I mean, it's fun.
I like the game.
And I actually played it one round for a good three hours, I think, the other day.
That seems to be getting the best reviews out of all the Vita games, is Luminous, which doesn't surprise me.
It's the PSP all over again.
some of them though have this weird fish eye thing to them where it kind of the screen bends a little bit and it's just really disorienting it's it's frustrating because i don't like i don't like the look of it i guess it's part of the challenge maybe it's not even really a challenge it's just like okay this song has this skin it's just it's dumb
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and then of course I also played Touch My Katamari which it must have been a while since I played other Katamari games because the levels seem new to me but I hear that they're not.
I hear they're just repeats of the old game again.
Thanks for watching!
It's almost like impossible.
I think maybe some of the controls in there.
But the way they've done the controls are kind of weird.
They have everything mapped to buttons, which is nice because I don't like a lot of the touchscreen stuff.
Like having to use the back panel to flip my Konamari around or jump.
That's mapped to the shoulder buttons as well.
And then to do the charge, you either have to hold the touchscreen on the front...
or you spin your um your analog sticks around in a certain direction and it I don't know neither way seems to work very well and that's kind of sad it's just it's really bad and at the same time it's like hmm yeah that's cool that you mapped that to the analog sticks and yet you have all these face buttons you're not using at all like none of the face buttons are used in the game
Maybe they overdid it from people's complaints about the PSP game.
But they could have either had it where you map your own custom buttons, or they could have had it where, okay, Dash is now one of the buttons on the face.
I mean, how hard would that have been?
You added multiple stuff for the other buttons in the game, but, oh, let's just not map it to the face buttons because that makes sense.
Before you get to another game, let me read some comments from chat.
Ahamkara in our chatroom says, I find the Vita annoying already.
I tried one at an Evil G in my area.
In some menus, you have multiple choices on screen, but you have to touch to choose to proceed.
No buttons are used.
You know, I had that same problem once.
When I went to Evil G, yes, I set foot in one to play it as well.
I forgot that it had a touchscreen because I associate the touchscreen thing with Apple and Nintendo.
I just forgot.
And I'm sitting there in the menu for Mod Nation Racers.
I'm like, why can't I play the goddamn game?
It's not a big deal.
Yeah, I know.
Once I figured it out, I'm like, oh, yeah.
It's actually really nice using the touchscreen.
A really interesting point that was brought up was that it does add a barrier for accessibility.
I have a blind friend on Twitter that follows that's like, this is limiting my accessibility because a blind person can use the buttons and everything but might not necessarily know where to touch on the screen to use the menus.
Especially in the main menus and all that.
Well, here's the problem with the main menus, too, is that they can be... All those buttons, just like you can on the iOS and stuff, they can all be rearranged.
So, you know, it may not... And when you get stuff installed, it might not exactly be in the right order that you're thinking it's going to be in.
So, I don't know.
They could easily add a button...
You know, or patch it in later on, but it's going to be kind of difficult because icons can get added left and right.
I don't know, unless you can change the sound effect that when you select a certain one, it sounds different.
I don't know.
Well, usually, I mean, think about it.
It's really...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
It's very, very sound oriented.
Like, I know fighting games are very popular because you use the sound cues a lot in those games.
Like, isn't there a YouTube out there of some blind guy just fucking regulating on Soul Calibur?
I seem to remember.
And it's all sound.
Maybe.
Thanks for watching!
Make some fucking sense.
The other thing I don't really care for about the Vita is sometimes it's very uncomfortable to hold the system.
Like, for example, the next game, which I got, which is funny because it's a full game.
I didn't anticipate it being a full game.
Apparently, when the system launched, they had, like I said, demos that came up, Ubisoft demos and stuff.
And one of the games I did want to check out was Michael Jackson The Experience because it's a rhythm music game.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't think so.
But you can go to websites and you can just hit the guide button, boof, go to a website.
Okay, I need to look up a fact on this game.
Look it up, whatever, and then switch back to your game again and take off.
But yeah, Michael Jackson Experience, actually a pretty fun music game.
But here's the ironic part.
The demo, originally when they first put it up, was the full game.
Oops!
So there was a few mix-ups where it was allowing you to download the full game for a few hours.
So I have the full game of Michael Jackson, the experience.
I didn't pay for it.
I still earned trophies from it.
I just can't sync them because I didn't actually purchase the game.
But I don't care.
Interesting that it knows that.
If I rent games from Gamefly or something, will I be able to do my trophies?
Yeah, you will be able to.
Oh, because I have the physical cartridge.
Yeah, you have the physical cartridge.
I have the digital download, so since it doesn't show that I have the actual full game, I don't have whatever it is to sync it.
Great question from Tigerclaw in our chat room at chat.orange.radio.com.
Does the Vita have an internet radio player?
Does PSP have one?
I don't think so.
And we had that olrpsp.com, which technically is still there.
It hasn't been updated in a very long time.
Yeah, whatever.
We need an olrvita.com.
I tried going to the All Games page today, and it did not play the radio player.
So it might not do HTML5.
Yeah, probably not.
Is it Flash?
I think allgames.com is Flash.
It's HTML5 now.
Is it?
Yeah, so it doesn't.
I don't think it does that.
Oh yeah, because it works on my iPhone.
I think you can very easily add an app for that.
I mean, I haven't really messed... Well, let's click music.
I haven't even really tried the music part yet because I don't have any music on here.
But, uh... What, you mean you're not downloading episodes of OLR to your phone or your PSP?
Dude, I have a 4 gig card.
It would fill that thing up really fast.
That's true, that's true.
So, no, I don't have that.
No, it doesn't look like it has a radio player in there, which is fine, you know.
Um...
That could be added later on.
Easy.
If there's a way to easily get OLR episodes in the PlayStation Vita, though, for those who do have bigger memory cards, I'm all about get the show out there however we can do it.
I'm all for that.
All right.
Well, anyway, we talked about the Vita an awfully long time.
So what do you hope to most see from the system in the future?
More games.
I mean, there's a lot of games coming out already for it.
And a lot of games I'm looking forward to.
You know, new Resistance game, Gravity Rush looks awesome.
And
I was trying to download the demo for it on my PS3 because I have a Japanese account and a UK account and stuff like that for getting multi-region demos, but they won't let you put them on the Vita because you can only download demos for the account that's on the Vita because that's stuck to one account, not multiple accounts.
If I could put multiple accounts on there, I could have
Demos from all regions, which have been awesome because they also have the Twitter app over there and the Flickr app already out in Japan.
It's just not over here yet until Wednesday.
Oh yeah, I forget those things have cameras on them.
Yeah, they're not very good.
It's about as good as the 3DS.
I really wish they'd have a bigger camera, but I understand their thing was it's gameplay first, you know, camera is just like, eh, whatever.
But yeah, it has a front and back camera.
Weird.
And here's the other thing that kind of sucks about it.
The AR games aren't up yet.
So they have these cards that don't do anything at the moment.
Not yet.
But they will.
They will on Wednesday.
And I'm trying to think what else is kind of cool.
Yeah, the Welcome Park stuff, I haven't played it yet, but it's a bunch of little mini-games that get you acclimated to the features of the Vita, and you can earn trophies from it.
So that's kind of something.
And I would recommend, if you're thinking about getting a system and thinking about getting a memory card, you probably want more than four gigs, because even just trying out some demos and stuff, it fills up the card really fast.
but 8 gigs probably probably good alright well I know that was extensive but you know new system launch week what can you do I will be getting mine Wednesday I'm really looking forward to it I've only gotten to play with one a little bit I'm getting Luminous and Katamari so I'll tell you my impressions next week Dark Sakura I know one's not in the cards for you right away but you were thinking about it a little bit but you want an iPad more huh I really want the iPad 3 cause you can do more design stuff on that
DarkSakura.com
Uh, it was pretty eventful, I mean, relatively.
Dan and I played a lot of Bubble Bobble this morning.
A lot of Bubble Bobble.
I suck at it.
Old school classic.
What system?
Because it was on everything.
We played the PS1 collection, but on our PS3.
Oh god, is that the one that came with, uh, it was like Bubble Bobble and it had...
Rainbow Islands and the Rainbow Islands Deluxe.
Oh, I thought there was another one.
No, because that was a Capcom game.
What am I thinking?
I'm thinking of that game where you shoot the arrow up and it explodes the bubbles and it creates like a chain at the top of the screen and anything that hits it explodes too.
Puzzle Bobble?
No, no, no, no.
Buster Move?
No, it's Capcom.
It was an old arcade game.
Somebody in chat would yell it out.
Buster Brothers?
Buster Brothers, that's it.
No.
Well, yet now I know.
I don't know why I tied those two games together in my mind because they weren't even the same company, but Bubbles.
No, we played Bubble Bobble a little bit today, and I was very alarmed that my friend who was over there at the time had never ever seen it.
And he's my age.
How do you not know the song, at least?
What planet were you born on?
So, um, and I played WoW.
Of course you played WoW, Abby.
And I played a lot of Bust a Move on my phone, which I broke down and bought another puzzle pack.
Who in the world does not know this song?
That's like one of the best ones.
Yeah, this is the best one.
Sing along!
Ah, now it'll be stuck in your head all day.
And the person next to you on the bus is looking at you funny.
I was making up lyrics to it.
Were you?
Yeah.
Have you ever watched that if video game themes had lyrics?
No, I haven't.
I've heard of it, though.
Those are funny.
Actually, what's my favorite?
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio on Sunday night.
It's on All Games Radio.
I was actually just singing Bubble Bobble as the words.
Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble.
Yeah.
So, that was it.
You know, games back in the day didn't really have extensive soundtracks, you know?
Like, they started to late in the NES era, like, especially a game like Final Fantasy or something.
But a lot of those old games had, like, one little riff that would play through the whole damn game.
So it had to be addicting.
Oh, there's one other game that actually I was looking for that I don't think I have on PC Engine that I want is Son Son 2.
Sonsun is a fun little side-scroller, and I found myself wishing today that I had a copy.
And that's it.
Good times.
Loki, I know you've already talked extensively about the Vita, but opening it up to whatever you've been playing this week, is there anything else to share?
Call of Duty.
My co-workers are starting to get really mad at me.
Hasn't that been the running theme for how long now?
Yeah, well, thankfully my other co-worker comes back off of his paternity leave, so at least there'll be someone else to play, but yeah, they're getting mad.
They had a conference in a, or they had a little group meeting in the conference room.
I'm trying to think of one of the funny... Oh, yeah.
Of course, they know that there's people that play professional StarCraft in Korea.
Of course, they mucked it up when they were doing the... Why don't you just go to... We're just going to send you to Korea to play competitive World of Warcraft.
I'm like, okay.
Well...
If you want to get technical, Arena is a big thing they do at BlizzCon.
And I don't know if Korea is necessarily the big... I think that's... Europe is really... There's a lot of teams in Europe.
The biggest raiding guilds are all over there.
I mean, it's just... It's just funny.
Anything else for your gaming week that you want to share?
That's it.
All right.
My gaming week.
Not a whole, whole, whole lot, but some new stuff.
I, of course, been playing WoW.
I'm on a rating team in WoW now, so it's a little different.
By the way, speaking of Warcraft, Horde House is coming back this week, which is exciting because we've been gone for a month.
We've just, we kind of suffered from burnout a little bit.
And as you guys know, my co-host is on hiatus from WoW.
But, and I just want to quell Shinny fears.
Extifer and I will both be on the new show.
So don't worry about that.
Nobody got fired or nothing.
But it's going to be a little different and you'll have to tune in this week to find out how.
But one of the things I'll be able to talk more about is like a legit rating because I've been doing more of that and more PvP.
So lots of WoW.
But I, believe it or not, have had a life outside of WoW.
A lot of it centers around the PlayStation 3.
I decided...
and I'm gonna get shit for this I already know it but I decided to take the plunge and sign up for PlayStation Plus this week um and I think the catalyst that did it for me was the fact that the Simpsons arcade game was free with PlayStation Plus and it really made me stop and think damn they are giving out free games all the freaking time on PlayStation Plus and especially if I've invested in the Vita and so forth I'm getting all these minis why the heck not
I'm just going to get it.
Now, yes, before you guys... I know people are typing it in chat already.
I already know.
If I stop paying for PlayStation Plus, I'm fully aware you lose access to all these games.
That's kind of the catalyst to it all.
But then I was thinking...
How many freaking games have I bought on Xbox Live Arcade?
Hint, a lot.
That I really don't play anymore.
That if I lost access to it today, I'd be like, eh, oh well.
You know, despite the fact that I paid five or ten dollars when I first got it.
You know, so I'm not, like, I fully realize that going into this deal.
That I might lose access to these games later on.
But it's giving me the chance to really sample things that otherwise might not be worth a full download.
For example, Simpsons arcade game.
Okay, here's the thing.
We've all been wanting this game on the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live forever.
I even want to say we did a list list.
It's on iPhone.
A long, long time.
A reimagining is on the iPhone.
Tricky, tricky.
Because EA has the license now.
So the one that's on the iPhone is inspired by the arcade game, but it's not exactly the arcade game.
and I'll see you next time.
Probably not.
So if I decide not to renew PlayStation Plus after three months, I lose it.
Yeah, I know, but it's not... Look, the stages and stuff are different.
They know that people want the Simpsons arcade game on the phone, but EA didn't do the Simpsons arcade game.
Konami did.
This one's put out... Oh, that's right.
Yep.
And the one that's on Network is Konami.
Yeah, Jvmon says the same thing in chat.
Sky, you've bought hundreds of dollars in XBLA games you've played once.
Absolutely right.
Kaijudo says, Rob, if all you wanted was Simpsons Arcade game, you could have just bought it for the same price as PSN+.
Yes, that's true, but then I thought, you know, why not get some of the extra other games?
And I got two other games, too, already.
One of them was this kind of basic bitch monkey ball clone game.
It's called Hamster Ball.
But it not only had a Monkey Ball clone, but it had a Marble Madness clone.
And I started playing that.
There's two different types of versions.
That's pretty cool.
And one of them was a Marble Madness clone.
I was like, okay, this is kind of cool.
Because Marble Madness is one of those games I kind of forgot was out there, but I really did love that game.
And to be playing this, I was like, what the hell does this remind me of?
Oh shit, it's Marble Madness.
And I was like, okay.
Okay, Hamster Ball.
I'm on to you.
So that was kind of neat.
And I didn't pay for it.
and then I got a game called Battle Fantasia which was a very chibi RPG-ish fighting game where you actually have hit points and you know, not a game I probably would have checked out otherwise but it's neat and I didn't pay anything for it.
So, going to our chat at chat.orangelawstudio.com Where is it?
Rama.
Rama said, PlayStation Plus, a fool and their money is soon parted.
Well...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
XBOX Live Online Gaming
Which is on PlayStation Network for free.
Anyway, you know, Xbox isn't exactly giving away games or any of this stuff.
So, I mean, I really am starting to question why the hell am I hanging on to an Xbox Live Gold account?
I don't play anything on Xbox Live right now that isn't a Kinect game.
Don't get me wrong, I love Dance Central and Rhythm Party and all that.
I'm hanging on to Xbox Live Gold because I've already paid for it.
I know.
Why has Konami made a game called Fish Kebab?
Because they...
I have weird stuff.
Not meaning to derail, I was just looking through it.
Ugh.
Okay, so, well...
I'm not going to give you shit because it's your money and you can do what the fuck you want with it so let me know how it works out I will I mean I think it's neat that you get the minis and all that and BlackWolfInChat says it amuses me to always hear I didn't pay for it when you got access to it by paying for it okay blah blah blah whatever fine but again I've already probably got more value out of this than I have my year of Xbox Live so far yeah really do we get free games each month with Xbox Live no
I mean, we get discounts sometimes.
But they're not free, because you paid for it.
That's true.
I have that Castlevania game on my iPhone.
I haven't tried it.
It's interesting.
Castlevania Puzzle, Encore of the Night.
It's weird.
Alright, anyhow.
So you know what?
I did it.
I just did three months, so I was like, you know, if I don't want to do it.
And I already turned off the auto-subscription thing, because it tries to make you turn it on, but you just go in and turn it off, and there you go.
Which is already a plus.
Which is already, yeah, something you can't do on the 360, so again... Without taking a...
A trip to India via the telephone.
So there you go.
All right, that's enough of my gaming week.
So let's talk housekeeping real quick, of which I don't have a whole lot, but I will, of course, mention the Facebook and the Twitters.
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
We're also on Twitter.
Twitter.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
Twitter.com slash OLR and we're on Google Plus under Orange Lounge Radio.
No URL there.
Question for you since you use your PlayStation 3 more than I do.
Your PlayStation 3, you can set it up to where your trophy stuff gets posted to Facebook, right?
Yeah.
Okay.
You can do that with the Vita too, but I obviously did not set that up because I don't want to spam my...
Well, all somebody has to do is block the application, but I actually kind of enjoy reading it because it tells me, like, I leave it unblocked and I don't mind people posting those because it tells me what games my friends are playing and a lot of times I'll see so-and-so is playing this game and I'll be like, is this any good?
And I get the same thing.
Like, I posted trophies from Simpsons arcade game and somebody was like, so is it more nostalgia or is it actually fun?
And I was kind of like, well, it's a little bit of both.
So, you know, I do actually like the trophy spam.
But thank heavens on Facebook you can easily block it.
And it won't upgrade you to Timeline.
Yay.
Won't upgrade you to Timeline?
Yeah, like all these apps won't upgrade you to Timeline now.
Like you try to use Hulu or Pinterest, it's all, you can install this app, but it'll upgrade you to Timeline.
The whole Facebook Timeline horrible page, I can't stand it.
I don't subscribe to anything anymore on Facebook.
Yeah, I already see.
I was in Timeline before.
I was in Timeline back in September.
So you're already stuck with it.
I hate it.
I hate looking at those Timeline pages.
Like, some's on the left and some's on the right.
It's weird.
I don't look at my page anymore, though.
I only look at my feed.
All right.
Let's move on with some actual gaming news, Loki.
So Sony's spending a lot of money to promote the Vita, which is kind of funny because I have yet to see any advertisements for the Vita.
So...
I don't know where this $50 million is going, but I'm assuming that they're going to start playing commercials after the system comes out, which is a little odd, but okay.
And there's a few commercials floating around, I guess, on the internet, but...
um so anyways yeah part of it's of course the hashtag uh game changer on twitter which i mean i don't know whatever um and they have hashtags for everything and like hashtags for people posting comments during the Whitney Houston funeral which my wife watched by the way part of it at least so boring but yeah i mean they're used for everything um
And of course, there's the huge Twitter campaign and I'm assuming lots of TV stuff.
Probably like the PlayStation 3 was.
It'll be interesting.
They're definitely working that out.
And of course, like some of the first party...
PlayStation 3 titles, the PlayStation Passes are making their way to the Vita as well.
Two games that launched that do have an online pass would be Hot Shots Golf World Invitational and Wipeout 2048.
Why those titles are the only ones that have online passes?
Those are the only ones that actually have online multiplayer.
Simultaneous.
Mod Nation Racers does not have simultaneous multiplayer.
They have this fancy term called asynchronous multiplayer, which means you download someone's ghost run and you race against that.
There is no multiplayer in that game.
Alpha Cananagram in our chatroom says, I've seen ads for the Vita for the U.S.
They suck.
Also, one of the U.S.
commercials shows 3G gaming when you can't game on 3G.
you can you can game but you can't game over 3G maybe it's showing up on things like maybe it's playing on ESPN or something you don't really watch maybe that's what the commercials are you know I don't watch a lot of TV either so it's possible but I mean I don't know I was watching Comedy Central the other day and I didn't see anything but then again I don't watch a lot of TV so maybe
Alpha Cananagram in our chat room continued at chat.orangelunchradio.com saying, Also, I heard another one showed someone playing it outside with good screen quality, but I think screen can't do that in sunlight, IRL, so it's sort of false advertising.
How does that thing react in sunlight?
I don't know.
I haven't played it outside.
Go outside!
DarkSakura.com
Waiting for that guy to get hit by a cab as he crosses the street because some fucking idiot walking around playing a game, you know, looking down.
It's just stupid.
I could see myself walking outside, taking a walk around the lake.
I'd just fall right in.
The other thing I do like about the Vita... I've seen you do the phone stumble.
Shush.
PSP have auto-correct?
I do kind of want to try Wipeout, but I got frustrated at the first Wipeout game.
It's just not my thing.
A little too fast and just kind of weird.
I want a more traditional racing game, I guess, but we'll see.
And as I mentioned before, Ridge Racer did not make it at launch.
It got delayed.
Oh, and one other thing.
Of course, Super Stardust Delta is going to be the free 3G Vita game that you get at launch.
Not a big surprise since for pretty much everything up until launch, it was the only PlayStation Network download except they added the escape plan stuff now and there's going to be some other stuff coming out later on.
and that is there's a lot of ifs and ands and you know asterisks and stuff like that basically you need to sign up with AT&T not necessarily sign up but you need to activate your 3G
and then I believe the way it works is you pay for a month of 3G so 250 megs $15 and then you get a free month of 3G and then once you've done that you also get Super Stardust Delta for free and
And I think it also... That's so low in my opinion.
It really strikes me as false advertising because it's like you're not really getting... Because on Amazon it said you get a free network game or whatever, but it's not really free.
It's free when you pay for the 3G.
It's free when you pay more money.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Which was a pay to unlock thing for a download game.
A play to unlock thing.
Another $8 on top of the $10 or $15 that that cost.
Come on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Call of Duty Game Boy Color
They ported it everywhere.
They had it on the DS.
I'm sure they did.
I don't know if there was one.
No, there was one last year for Modern Warfare 3 on the DS.
So, of course, it's coming out on the Vita, but it is still notable because, obviously, this is a huge franchise.
And even though it's one I don't usually talk about, it is still a huge selling franchise.
I think it would be a system seller, to be honest, for the Vita.
You think it's going to be that good?
You don't think it'll just be a port of another title?
No.
Um, it may be a port of, um, I think it's gonna be a port of the game that they're gonna be putting out this year, but, I mean, the games look great on there, and if they can get the controls right, which, I mean, it's got most of the controls of a PlayStation 3, aside from missing the L3, R3, and, you know, L2, R2, but, um, you can kind of work that stuff in, you know, with the touchscreen, maybe.
Let me get to the exact quote about this release.
This is from Vice President Guy Longworth in an interview with GameTrailers saying, quote, in the autumn, they're really looking forward to Call of Duty on Vita, and we think that's going to be an absolute game changer for the platform.
Interesting way of phrasing that.
Nice to work in the hashtag in there for their Twitter cam.
I think it's going to be a game changer.
Oh, is that... I didn't realize that was a whole tie-in to some weird marketing thing.
But yeah, I think it'll do well.
I mean...
They'll probably have Call of Duty on the 3DS this year.
Well, if it's a unique Vita game with features kind of unique to the system, I'm sure there'll be an audience for it, but I would think it's just going to be a port kind of like the DS games are.
But the DS games are completely different.
I mean, that's really limited as far as the system goes.
They've had Call of Duties, like really old Call of Duties on the PSP, but even that was kind of limited because you didn't have a second analog stick and stuff.
This, I think, is going to be
more along the lines of an actual Call of Duty game.
And it would be cool if they had cross-play with the PS3 and stuff.
You could do that.
That could be the game changer right there.
Play with the PC and the PS3.
All right.
DarkSakura, what do you got for us in the news?
Sorry, I was describing a bottle of wine.
Talking liquor with our chatters?
And my windows are frozen.
Okay.
Oh noes!
Deselect, motherfucker!
Stop it!
What kind of laptop should our users not be buying?
Hold on.
Netbook.
Netbook.
I guess there's a difference, huh?
Or is the mouse dying?
No, it's not my mouse.
What happens is it selected text.
and is not deselecting the text so that I can get to my other window.
So yeah, Capcom had another spelling problem.
It was the Azure Watch.
Is that the game?
Azure's Wrath.
Azure's Wrath, whatever.
Yeah, it's Chandlingers.
Chandlingers.
Chandlingers.
Chandlingers.
It's apparently even more failed than it was before.
So yeah, Capcom's still misspelling words.
They really need to get things correct with their, you know... Oh, finally I can get to the damn thing.
Now that you recalled it from memory, yes.
They really need to get their QA really down.
Either that or not let the Japanese team do the boxes.
Or they need to just invest in Microsoft Word and the little red underline that appears when you spell a word wrong.
Because these aren't done in Word.
I'm not a designer, but couldn't illustrate or whatever.
I have the solution to all of Capcom's problems.
Hire me.
This shit doesn't happen on anything that I make.
Hire me.
You should send in a resume.
P.S.
I don't screw up on the covers to video games.
You should make a little YouTube and we can try and get it to go viral and send it to Capcom.
Do you want to?
I will help you make one if you want.
Five.
All right.
New project for OLR.
Get Jamie a job.
Now, unlike your application for the tester, you need to actually go through with this one.
Well, I didn't make my video for the tester.
That's the only thing I didn't do.
I was sort of like, I don't want to move.
It's really it.
It's like, I don't want to go to L.A.
I don't like L.A.
Capcom's in the Bay, right?
They have a big office in the Bay.
I think so.
I think they do.
They're in Santa Clara.
Yeah.
Which I would totally telecommute for that.
There you go.
I would absolutely telecommute.
All right.
And no spelling mistakes.
No spelling mistakes.
T-E-L-E-C-O-M-M-U-T-E.
If anyone from Capcom is listening, remember that DarkSakura is a real bitch when it comes to grammar and spelling.
I am.
You've heard the mailbag segment on this show.
She's ruthless.
I have no Ruth.
None at all.
No Ruth anywhere near me.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Challenges.
They don't notice, okay?
Seriously.
Oh, it's text speak.
Challenges is text speak.
No, it's not even that.
It's an extra freaking letter.
When I get my Vita next week, I'm going to send Loki a text message that says, I challenge you to a duel in Luminous.
Maybe it's a friend's reference.
Why?
Maybe it's a friend's reference.
It's spelled C-H-A-N-L-L-E-N-G-E-S.
That's an extra N.
Shut up, Rob Shut up, Rob
I am a great up and coming designer and I will work for 20 bucks an hour
Which is cheaper than a lot of designers will charge you.
I'll work for $19 an hour.
You can't design shit, okay?
Oh, I can't design shit.
I can out-design anything.
To his credit, he did make olrpsp.com, which was pretty kick-ass.
That was something that other people that weren't even into video games were looking at.
It's like, wow, this is a great PSP-based thing.
You did a very good job.
Now, I can't...
I promise that I will continue to update sites, but I can design it the first time.
Okay, Loki, what is CMYK?
CMYNK is Cyan Yellow Magenta Black.
Except you got the wrong order.
I don't give a crap.
You asked what it was.
What's an ink limit?
Shut up.
You two both shut up.
What's .game?
Okay.
I'm just giving you a hard time.
Here's the difference between Loki the designer and DarkSakura the designer.
Loki's a man and DarkSakura's a woman.
Therefore, Loki starts projects and never finishes them.
Then again, you've started a lot of projects that you don't finish.
Whatever happened to OLRWee.com?
Brad from PodCulture says Capcom where spellcheck doesn't exist.
I'll tell you what happened to that is that no one uses the Wii web browser so that's what happened to that.
And Tigerclaw people would not get all Fs because I would just beat them in the face.
And I would expel anybody from my class that got less than a C. All right.
I just wouldn't have class.
Moving on.
More news.
Less bickering.
Loki.
And, you know, Tiger Claw, I know that you say that anything with spelling errors is going to be a collector's item, but not when they're put out there widespread.
Well, it's also really easy to print fakes, I would think.
I mean, somebody like DarkSakura could probably spot a fake.
I have to point out something, just for the chat room to clarify.
Loki's got natural design talent.
If he had the schooling to go behind it,
It'd be out there making bank.
And I will say this offhand.
A lot of talent just needs to know how to use the other software that we all have to know how to use.
Now, you want to know what's hilarious?
I have no design talent whatsoever, and yet I actually did do design for a short time before I was in insurance.
I'll tell you this, too.
Isn't that ironic?
I just got done... Well, not just got done, but I read the biography of Joe Simon, who's one of the guys that created Captain America.
Mm-hmm.
Back in the day, it was just natural talent and honing your own talent.
He got jobs as designers doing photo touch-ups in the Depression era.
Back then, it was all, what's your raw talent?
Can you do this?
Do you know how to use the software?
Now, they require so much more education.
They don't care how well you know how to use everything.
They want you to have the degree that says you know how to use it, which doesn't always mean you know how to do shit.
Not everybody, though, because I will tell you that the publisher I used to work for was very much, you know what?
To me, work experience is very, very valuable.
So, you know, I'll just say that.
Tell that to the places I've been applying at.
Some smart publishers out there.
Anyhow, quickly, a comment from our chat room.
JV Mon in our chat room at chat.orange.studio.com says, Ugh, the Wii browser is terabad.
It's faster using AOL dial-up.
Yikes.
Well, the problem is no one's really using that anymore.
No one's really using the PSP web browser anymore.
I mean, there's a few people that are, but you're in the minority.
Most everyone's using some sort of web browser on your phone, on your iPod, iPad, something like that.
So to make a site dedicated to the PSP or even the PlayStation Vita... And to be honest, you don't really need a website dedicated to the PlayStation Vita because...
Hell, I pulled up our site on there.
It looks great.
I mean, any website looks great on it.
As long as you don't put Flash in there, you know.
God, my God.
Okay, why can't they put HTML5 in a web browser on this stupid device?
Why can't they do that?
Slow, maybe?
I don't know.
Slows down memory loss?
But it is, from what I understand, quite a bit more efficient than Flash is lately unless you're just fully putting full animation in something you don't need to have Flash.
So I don't get it.
I can do Flash.
I don't like Flash.
I would rather do it in HTML.
Alright, let's move on, Loki.
Alright, let's talk a little bit about Nintendo.
And this is kind of neat.
And see, I have a few speculations on what this could mean, but Nintendo has acquired a video research and kind of like a video middleware company called MobiClip.
And MobiClip, mainly they were kind of focused on video compression for Game Boy Advance, DS, and 3DS games.
Now, what I'm thinking this could be used for is a few things.
Either A, they're going to do some more video streaming stuff to the 3DS, or B, it's for working on the Wii U and getting that video data compressed enough to where they can stream either a higher resolution or something like that to the Wii U's tablet devices.
That's a really good thought.
I was actually going in the direction of those movies on the cartridge for the 3DS because we still don't have the 3D movies.
I'm kind of curious if anyone's picked up Tekken Prime 3D Edition or whatever, or Tekken 3D Prime Edition, and how that 3D movie looks on the 3DS would be kind of interesting.
I have not.
Anybody in chat maybe?
We'll see.
So, I mean, Nintendo was already working with this company anyway, right?
So this whole acquisition isn't going to change the world, right?
No, it's not.
Why would you just bring them in under your wing?
Because you plan on using them a lot, right?
They have something that you want and that you don't want anyone else to have.
Like, for example, if you think about it, this company say they did find a way to a really good algorithm or, you know, some sort of tool that can compress stuff and do, like, high-definition video or, you know, really good video.
And for this type of application... They don't want the Vita PS3 having that same technology.
Yeah, they don't want the PS3 pad or the Xbox, you know, tablet thing or whatever they have.
If that turns out...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
All right.
Well, anyhow, if you're a Mac gamer, I have some news for you, both of you out there.
No, I'm just kidding.
I'm kidding.
Don't send hate mail in.
There is some new gaming-related stuff coming to OSX Mountain Lion in the way of Game Center.
Game Center is kind of, I don't know.
and so on.
It will add some new stuff, though.
I didn't even know this was in there, but voice chat will make its way.
I didn't think that was already in Game Center, but some are saying it is.
I didn't think voice chat was.
I don't think so.
I didn't know that was there.
But it would make sense if it can kind of interface with the Mac that way.
Like, you know, I see why they're doing that, because they're trying to, you know...
and so on.
FaceTime is the biggest drawback because it doesn't work on 3G.
I know there's competitors out there that do work on 3G.
I'm aware of that.
But until Apple kind of officially endorses it, I think that's one of its biggest kind of drawbacks.
And maybe they're worried about the quality.
I don't know.
But you're right.
Skype will do 3G, but Skype isn't integrated into the freaking phone.
You have to download it separately, and not everybody does that.
You can do it on 3G, but you have to have it jailbroken before you can do that.
Hmm.
So, well, again, not something that's integrated into it normally.
Yeah.
So, BlackWolf in our chat room, of course, the man before us at All Games Radio, says, there are voice chat APIs available to iOS developers as part of GameKit.
Not many people implement it, though.
So, I guess, I don't know.
It's just not the same type of gaming on the iPhone.
Like, who would you talk to playing Angry Birds?
Well, Angry Birds isn't really... I talk to Angry Birds.
I could think maybe... I go, I hate this game every time I play it, so...
There's a lot of games that you play at the same time, like Words with Friends and stuff like that.
It's usually, okay, I'm going to do my move now, and that's it.
You just kind of play it on your own time.
It's not like, okay, hey, pop out your phone right now.
We're going to play a game of whatever.
Right, right.
All right, let's move on.
Release dates coming up very soon after one more story.
DarkSakura.
Mantis.
Sorry, that's not the story.
No.
I just found something that was worse than the frilly dog panties.
Mantis.
What?
Mantis are worse than frilly dog panties.
We've had this discussion on the show before, and I don't want to have it again.
So how about something that has absolutely nothing to do with mantis?
Please.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
Yay!
Heroes in a Manti?
Now I'm picturing Michelangelo.
Don't picture that.
I'm going to have to draw that.
No!
No, you don't draw that.
This is not DeviantArt.
This isn't 4chan.
This isn't 4chan.
So, it could possibly be that Activision is doing a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game.
Who knows?
They haven't been attached with them before, but maybe they will.
The last one that came up was that horrible Wii game.
Didn't Ubisoft do that or something?
No, it was another company that had it at the time.
Yeah, it was published by Ubisoft, and then before that was Konami.
Well, technically there was two Wii games.
There was one for the movie, the TMNT thing.
Then there was also the one that was like Smash Brothers.
Yeah, I'm talking about Smash Up.
How many times have they freaking rebooted the Ninja Turtles?
You know what I want them to do?
I want them to go back to the original Ninja Turtles.
You know, the ones that were all black and white or the only color they wore was red.
And do like a big RPG based off the original Turtles.
I want a music game with a ninja rap.
Go ninja, go ninja, go.
Come on, it'd be awesome.
I had no idea they were doing yet another new cartoon.
I was like, really?
There's another one?
The last one that I remembered watching, they had done the one that was on in the late 80s and early 90s that I was watching as a young teenager and my brothers were watching as kids.
and then they did another one for a while that was supposed to be pretty much a little bit more on the hardcore side and then the last thing that I watched actually was from that series where they went back into their other universes and they went back with the original Turtle Universe and they were all like you guys are bitches
So this is all CGI it looks like.
It doesn't look like very good CGI either.
Was that like Dun & Poser?
You know what though?
This looks like it could easily be a video game.
With the technology we have today, I could be looking at screenshots from a video game.
I would not know the difference.
That looks like really... I hope those are just preliminary shots because those textures are just horrendous.
Maybe it's...
Well, keep in mind, I think these are pictures of posters, so you're probably losing some detail.
I don't think I'm losing anything.
But maybe it's all Mashima, is what it comes down to.
Well, at any rate, at any rate, you know, it better be, I just really don't have a whole lot of faith in it being much better.
Well, one interesting kind of tie-in, because you were talking about kind of the license through the days and how Konami had it, and I guess Ubisoft may not have it now, looking at this story, but the 8-bit Ninja Turtle game that's on virtual console right now is getting pulled, or got pulled.
I think it's getting pulled soon.
Because it sucks?
I like the original game, but that's...
I like the arcade game.
That's one of those games I see through rose-colored glasses.
It was awesome when you're nine, but now it's probably crap.
Okay, do the water level without cursing.
You know what I'm talking about.
Fucking seaweed.
but that game is no longer going to be on Virtual Console good you know actually you know what's funny you know what Virtual Console did get this week finally finally after years and years it's like the first Virtual Console game to come out in like nine months you know what game they got?
Genesis game Strider
Yes, that's right.
Because Dan was talking about it, and I'm like, you don't need another version of Strider.
You really don't need another version of Strider.
You already have that version of Strider.
We do have that version of Strider.
I have beaten that version of Strider.
I have not beaten it in the arcade, but I've beaten the Genesis one.
All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and what's coming out to a game store near you.
Gee, I wonder what could be dominating the U.S.
releases this week, Loki?
Not as many as you would think because most of them were last week.
This week we've got Metal Gear Solid 3D Snake Eater on the 3DS, of course.
We've got Shinobito 2 Revenge of Zen, which is basically by the guys that do Tenchu, and that's on the Vita.
Touch My Katamari on the Vita this week as well.
Pro Evolution Soccer 2012 on 3DS.
Syndicate on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
Asura's Wrath on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
Some more Vita titles.
Army Corps of Hell on the Vita.
Dynasty Warriors Next.
Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus on the Vita.
Of course, the Vita system.

Poke Park 2 on the Wii.
And that's it.
Taku no Saito, Students of Round
Naruto Shippuden, Naruto Storm Generation comes out on the 360 this week as well as Darkness 2 and Under Defeat HD.
I haven't heard of Under Defeat.
It looks like a helicopter game so kind of like a shooter game on the 360.
Gal Gun Shooting Pheromones Gun
Yeah, isn't this the whole like making teenage girls fall in love with you by the end of the day?
I think you're fighting them off or something.
I don't really know what the storyline was, but it's an on-rails shooter game that uses the PlayStation Move controller.
Let's just say it's not coming out here in the States.
But thanks to the region-free ability of the PlayStation 3, it can be yours if you so wish.
Fight Night Champion getting a price reduction.
It's actually not that bad of a game.
I like the Xbox 360 one.
I thought it was fun.
Shinken de Watashi no Koi Shinasi R comes out this week on the PlayStation 3.
This is labeled as an adventure game.
It looks like yet another one of those games that's heavy on the dialogue and kind of like simulator games.
But it doesn't look like a dating game.
It looks like kind of something else.
But I don't see any action screenshots, just all talking and anime clip scenes and all that.
And leaning over with a big bust.
Yes, of course, of course.
Gotta emphasize dem boobies.
Lots of stuff on the PlayStation 3 this week.
Idolmaster, Volume 5, Under Defeat, also on the PS3, Darkness 2, and Tachishio Love Application.
Applicate your love!
and kind of um um god damn it what's that farming game from Natsume Harvest Moon it looks Harvest Mooney to me because look they're growing eggplants there and they're harvesting chicken it's not Harvest Moon but it's like a 3D version there's no cows yeah well she's wearing a cow hat oh nope there's a cow right there cute little fat ass cow right there and a sheep okay
This is like a Zynga type Harvest Moon game coming out in Japan.
There you go.
That's it for Japanese.
It's not Harvest Moon, it's Harvest Noon.
You're saying it's Farmville then.
Basically, yeah, it's Farmville instead of Farmtown.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Back up, back up.
Did you say a game called Everybody's Goth?
Goth.
Oh, I thought she said Everybody's Goth.
I'm like, is this 1994? 1994.
Today on Goth Talk, we'll explore, has Hot Topic deceived us?
Have they abandoned us?
With always my co-host, Asriel Abyss, Prince of Sorrow.
You know what, I know it sounds like we're making fun, but seriously, that was my crowd in high school, so whatever.
Yeah, same here.
Mod Nation Racers Road Trip, MotorStormRC, Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus, The Vita Itself, Reality Fighters,
Shinobito 2 Revenge of Zen Shinobito, sorry I was reading it wrong Super Stardust Delta, Top Darts Touch My Katamari Baby Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 Uncharted Golden Abyss Virtual Tennis 4 Wipeout 2048 and on the 24th we have Binary Domain on the 360 and PS3 and Hyperdimension Neptunia MK2 on PS3 Syndicate on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 The Last Story on Wii
I'm surprised they're getting Gravity Rush so early.
I may have to import that if it's in English.
Which I would assume it is.
Mayhaps it may be.
Because it's not coming out over here until May.
Same day as Resistance, too, so that's a tough one.
By the way, completely off the record, well, not off, but having nothing to do with this, I've decided to play through Mother 3 because I hate my life and I want to cry.
Have fun with that.
It's depressing.
Maybe you should be playing everybody's goth then.
I'm trying to imagine how that game would play.
You'll go around trying to convert the jocks and the cheerleaders.
No, you go around trying to avoid the jocks and the cheerleaders.
With your goth gun.
Goth gun.
Yes, it's bat.
It fires bats.
And you have to raise... It fires sorrow.
DarkSakura.com
You might get, like, there might be DLC that will change it to The Smiths, you know, or something like that.
Yeah, that's what it should progress.
Like, The Smiths would be the ultimate in depression.
Or no, eventually you get to Bauhaus level.
Bela Lugosi is dead.
Thank you for watching!
But they kind of started that off a little early with the new Twisted Metal game having live-action cutscenes.
And, of course, they're expecting to have the same characters from the last Twisted Metal game in this actual movie as well.
So, neat.
It's being developed by Avi and Ari Arad, who I guess have worked with the Spider-Man series.
And...
Car Crashing Expert
It's too bad David Carradine didn't live long enough to see this.
That is too bad.
He did live long enough for Kill Bill.
But hey, you know what?
And I understand that he may not necessarily be part of the lore for Twisted Metal.
There is still Sylvester Stallone, and he could probably come back as Machine Gun Joe.
Not sure, what's he doing these days?
The Expendables?
Expendables 2.
Whoopee!
Well, actually, no.
He has quite a few movies.
He has Expendables 2.
He has two more movies with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
That's right.
Arnold's gone back to acting.
He needs to go back to exercising, too, because, whoa.
I mean, that's pretty wrong of me saying that, but, you know, it's insane.
Well, we've got the man who was, you know, elected by Ronald Reagan to be our, you know, the person we attained, you know, we looked for as a role model for fitness, who was, what was it, the president's fitness shit thing?
I'm not going to lie, though.
If I'm that fit at that age, I'll be happy.
There's a very easy way for you to get that fit.
Stop eating that.
No.
It comes in a needle.
It comes with a needle and a little glass.
Oh, no.
Steroids.
Because that's how he did it.
Crack is whack, yo.
I want to see those receipts.
I don't believe it.
Don't make me get out the Whitney Houston interview.
Some might say it's in bad taste.
All right.
Actually, I got to say, I've become a lot more active lately.
I really have.
I mean, this is only within the past week and a half, so it's not really a habit yet, which is why I haven't been talking about it a lot.
But there's two things to credit with it.
One of them would be the site Fitocracy.
I don't know how many of you guys know about this website.
I signed up.
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
As crazy as this sounds, and I know I'll get called sellout or whatever, but Rhythm Party got me up and moving and remembering how good it feels to play DER for 30 minutes.
Again.
And I really do credit Rhythm Party, which had DLC this week.
I don't even think that comes up in our show tonight, so I'll say it now.
They finally put out DLC for Rhythm Party this week.
The downside is it's all Konami originals, but the upside is, oh my god, the collaborations are...
are hilarious do you know who Naoki collaborated with this time?
Tiffany awesome where does he I know and then one of the songs has um
Who are the Sister Sledge?
You remember Sister Sledge?
We are family.
The oldest Sister Sledge, the one that was the vocalist, is in another collaboration.
Like it's all these like washed up fucking 80s and 70s vocalists are now in DDR or Rhythm Party, excuse me, songs.
But unfortunately, Rhythm Party's weakest thing is like, okay, it's got Born This Way by Gaga and nothing else contemporary.
I'm sorry, Bobby Brown is not contemporary.
It's more contemporary now, though.
It is now!
By sheer luck!
But it was not supposed to be contemporary.
The songs are decent, though.
The songs are surprisingly decent.
I enjoy it more than Dance Masters.
I will stand by that.
It's a way better investment than Dance Masters.
Which Dance Masters theme happens to be part of that.
Yeah, that was in the download pack, too.
Anyhow, sorry.
I didn't mean to get on a tangent, but I have been on a fitness kick lately.
The thing with me, though, is I don't really allocate myself that much time because when I get home from work, I watch my son until he goes to bed at 8.
So I have a short window between 8 o'clock and 11 p.m.
to...
Have dinner, relax for a little bit.
It's like, okay, where am I going to fit fitness in there?
Yes, I could do it, but then again, at the same time, that's the only free time I have all day.
I got to fit in games in there.
I'm going to fit in working on stuff I want to work on.
And I understand.
It's just I don't prioritize it enough.
I'll throw this out there um I I it may not work for your situation but one like kind of goal I made is that I try to walk a mile every day and I do that on my breaks at work I do it on my break and I have an application on my phone called RunKeeper that helps me and it funny RunKeeper ties into Fitocracy so every time I walk it will say on my Fitocracy you walked 1.2 miles today and so I do that on my break I mean that's that's what I've been trying to do
Well, I'll tell you too, because keep in mind, I was up there a few years ago, and that's how I lost all of my weight, was by cutting way down on sugar and walking every day at work during my lunch break.
And that was when I was working off of downtown, off of Alhambra, and walking around that big park twice.
So, yeah.
I don't know how, but I ballooned up at the end of last year, so I'm trying to lose it.
But yoga, and I'm actually planning on getting the Connect Yoga.
Okay.
I've started taking yoga twice a week and now I do it every day.
And I have noticed, well, I'm not going to actually say the number or anything, but since I've started taking yoga and cut out all bread, I am now down seven pounds from when I started.
Congrats.
So yeah, just making little changes and incorporating some activity into your life is amazing.
You'll find a place to squeeze it in.
You know, I would love to... Lift weights.
Do sit-ups.
Do 25 sit-ups before you go to bed.
Well, not before you go to bed because then you'll be up all night.
Do 25 sit-ups right when you get home.
I've seriously thought about building new DDR pads.
I have sheet metal in my garage.
There you go.
Get back into DDR.
I can't because of the proximity to my son's room.
It would be too loud.
Yeah.
All right, well, moving on.
Let's get back into video game talk.
I want to do a follow-up to something we were talking about last week, which was the double fine funding that happened through Kickstarter.
They're going to break $2 million.
I mean, there's still 22 days left on that thing, and I just checked it earlier today.
It was at $1.9 million.
So they're going to easily break $2 million, maybe make $2.5 million.
I don't know.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
They've already announced that there will be a DRM-free game that will be released on the PC, Mac, and Linux when it launches.
There will be a closed beta that's going to happen on Steam.
And now Tim Schafer said in an interview that went up on YouTube that because they got more money, they're going to also do it on iOS and certain types of Android phones.
So they're going to kind of expand those platforms.
But it is important to note, if you donate it to the project, you won't be able to get the iOS and Android versions free because of the limitations of those types of distributions.
From what I remember of the Apple Store, you can get a finite number of codes to give away your product, like it's got to be 100 or less, maybe even like 50 or 20.
but like you know with 30,000 people donating to this and counting I think it's even more I'm just reading off the lowest tier even they can't generate that kind of codes on iOS so your free one that you get for donating will be the PC Mac or Linux version but there will also be now this iOS and Linux one nothing about consoles yet so there you go kind of the first update and I guess we're going to probably see more of this as it gets developed that'd be funny if they put that on indie games
I guess they could.
Yeah, file size is usually the only thing that's holding it back, but... You never know, though.
I mean, Xbox is known for making exceptions.
So a high-profile thing like this... They probably put that Xbox lever, Kate.
It might as well, right?
Yeah.
All right, well, let's take a moment to walk down the halls of gaming's history.
You know, there was a time...
We didn't know anything.
The only stuff we knew about video games was what we read in Nintendo Power or Electronic Gaming Monthly.
That's what we got to see development.
We didn't have the internet.
It looked like DOS.
It was called AOL.
That's right.
1.0.
Back in my day, it was Quantum Link on the Commodore 64.
Yes, I had Prodigy.
You know what the AOL users called it, at least in my group?
Buttigy.
We really caught it.
And CompuSuck.
Prodigy was fucking awesome on the old PCs because of the graphics and everything.
Anyway, I was very loyal to Prodigy for a long time.
I remember my old sign-in.
But anyway, we won't go there.
We'll go to the classic game of the week.
DarkSakura is going to jump in the gaming vault and pick out one game she thinks, hey, play it.
It is Rainbow Islands, the story of Bubble Bobble 2.
You've been on a bobble kick lately.
Well, I was inspired.
At any... And actually the music that I linked is probably one of the best home versions ever.
This one is the PC Engine version, which is pretty much arcade perfect.
Anyway, Rainbow Islands came out in 1987.
It was by Taito.
And it was a sequel to, as it says, Bubble Bobble.
And the game, it was actually the second in the series.
It was followed by Bubble Symphony and Bubble Memories.
But it has two sequels, Parasol Stars and Bubble Bobble Part 2.
So it's come out on like darn near everything.
It's kind of messed up.
But the way that you get through that is you're on an island that you have to throw rainbows around to get to different platforms.
And you can use the rainbows to shoot things, but they will eventually break down.
You've also got this thing called the Hidden Depths, where it actually has a bunch of different secrets that you can find, like different levels and power-ups and different riddles.
And so it makes it, you can beat the game so many different ways.
It also has a scoring system that has its own secrets too, so you can get different high scores by finding all the different stuff.
So as I said, it's set on islands, ten of them, and they each have their different theme.
and you basically move to the next island in the chain by going around and passing the levels and they get progressively more difficult.
You have faster enemies and you can also go on a large map screen where you can see all the different islands.
There are three secret islands that are not visible until the seven big diamonds are collected which are hidden throughout the game and actually most home versions lack the secret islands.
So you can release these rainbows, and they're weapons and platforms.
And when you jump on them, they fall down and hit the enemies below it.
And different power-ups can make you go faster, increase the speed of the rainbows, and let you spawn, I believe, up to three rainbows.
Isn't that right, Robb?
Yes, I think it was three was the max you could get.
Just so you guys know, I love this game.
Like, I used to play this at Roseville Golf Land in between while waiting for DDR, because that was back when Altercade was cool, and I used to play this in the Altercade machine all the time.
And people were like, what is that very homosexual game you are playing where you are literally shooting rainbows?
I said, it's Rainbow Islands and it's awesome, you shut your judging mouth.
and the other thing that's good about the little rainbows too is that they actually protect you from overhead enemies taking big poops on you so at any rate that video finished so I'm going to do the totally awesome Commodore 64 version of the game
Listen, Bubby
Bobby's in this game!
It has the same thing, except the bosses are in different orders, the enemies are in different order.
Kind of like Bubble Bobble Super Mode.
And it came out in limited quantities.
Now, just to let you know, it actually was included in the Mega Drive version of Rainbow Islands.
And the arcade version was actually licensed to RomStar to come out over in the U.S.
So the version that I was playing of Bubble Bobble had that version on it, the PS1 collection, Bubble Bobble collection.
So all the different versions that came out at home.
There was a Commodore 64, which we just heard the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC.
There was Amiga and Atari ST, the Mega Drive version.
There was the NES version, which was not that great.
The European version is also different than the Japanese version, just saying.
Sorry for that little clip in the background that wasn't really from Rainbow Islands.
It said it was the loading theme, but I think that was a universal loader thing back in Commodore 64 piracy days.
So sorry.
That clip was not actually from Rainbow Islands.
I apologize.
So we'll go to... Can I keep listening?
Yeah, but I need to find what system to do now.
Just...
How about this one?
I think this is arcade.
Let's hope nobody's doing a voiceover on this one.
The arcade one that I found was really quiet.
Yeah.
It's alright.
It needs to be quiet so you can talk over it.
At any rate, we also had PC Engine TurboGrafx, which was the first one that I linked.
It was on QCard.
There was also a PC, Sega Saturn, and PlayStation version that was released as Bubble Bobble featuring Rainbow Islands.
That's the one I was playing.
There's a WonderSwan version, Game Boy Color, PC, PS2, Xbox that came out as part of Taito Legends, a mobile version, and Xbox Live Arcade version got one that was updated with 2.5D graphics.
And then the arcade game, now this is kind of neat,
The music was actually based off Over the Rainbow from The Wizard of Oz.
And it came on the Mega Drive, PC Engine, and Famicom versions.
But when it came out on the Master System Nest, Saturn, all those other ones, they actually changed it so that they wouldn't risk copyright infringement.
So yeah, that's the game that we have.
Oh, and I do want to mention some regional differences.
For the Sega Master System version and the European one, there was a glitch that made the game crash after level 7, so it sent you back to the title screen.
If you use the level select code to get to 8, the glitch happens at the end of that level, and you can't even see the ending.
The Brazilian version fixed it.
and the European version of the NES port is actually a lot more like the arcade version where the Japanese and North American versions have the original level designs and story versions.
That's it.
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Rainbow Islands.
On pretty much every freaking console that was out at the time.
And a few that weren't out at the time.
That's right.
There you go.
By the way, just to answer some questions from chat, some folks were saying, wasn't that already the game of the week before?
No.
No, we did check versus the wiki, Parasol Stars, which was kind of a different, like bubble bobble sequel the other way.
It was one of the official sequels to the game.
Right, it was in the past.
And I'm pretty sure I would have brought up Rainbow Islands because I did genuinely like the game a lot.
But I believe, at least according to our wiki, this is the first time that it has officially been the game of the week.
I did Parasol Stars like, what, last year or the year before?
It was a while ago.
Well, you know, you gotta remember, we've been doing Classic Game of the Week since episode 250, I believe.
And we're almost to 450.
I've named over 200 games.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
No, I think that I did a different version of it.
I think it was one of those things where when it happened, we were just like, yeah, you know what?
Deal with it.
It's been 200 shows.
If that was my only thing, then screw it.
It's going to get to a point where you're like, shit, I've done everything.
JV1 says there was a PCP version as well.
I think that's what he heard.
I'm going to get out my Commodore 64 five and a quarter floppies and be all like, just pick one out of the box.
My dad still has those in the garage.
You think those discs work?
Or do you think they've probably melted by now?
Let's fire up Geass.
All right, anyhow, we're going to take a break, guys, but there's still plenty more show to come.
Rapid Fire News coming up.
Of course, your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, the FUs of the week, Twitter, topics, and so much more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
We are live with the 446th episode of our show on this February the 19th of 2012.
Live tonight, live only tonight, we're saying goodbye, sadly, to the OLR afterbirth at the very end of the show.
You know, we used to be live for about 20 minutes after we taped the show, and the reason why we couldn't podcast it is because a big central part of that was the cage match where we played copyrighted music.
We've made a very difficult creative decision to end that segment tonight.
The good news is that it'll free up the resources to do other things, but I want to warn everybody, don't expect that to come right away.
There's still some things that have to happen behind the scenes, but we are going to use the time to work on other projects.
We still appreciate, of course, the live listeners coming out every week, but we hope you'll
Understand and respect our decision to kind of say, you know what, this segment's losing steam for us.
We need to kind of put it out to pasture and reinvent with something new.
So that'll be ending live tonight.
Podcasters, not a damn thing changes for you.
If you've never listened to OLR Live before, you're not going to notice a lick of difference right now.
No, nothing will change.
Nothing will change.
The show is still fine.
All right.
We're still holding it together with chicken wire and duct tape.
There might be more in the future for you.
Who knows?
There might be more.
All right.
Anyhow, before I give too much away, let's talk.
Oh, speaking of spoilers, I wanted to bring this up at some point because last week on the show, we had a very unexpected surprise during the phone call segment and we made a new friend here at Orange Lounge Radio and it was Asuka.
Asuka.
I always want to say Asuka, but it's Asuka.
Keep in mind, for most words in Japanese, the U or Su or Ru, the U is really cut short.
Well, now I've had my lesson.
But Asuka was on the show last week, and she is from the Tester, which is the Sony...
and DarkSakura.com.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
The one... Props to her for keeping that secret.
Because if I was... If that was me, that would have been a really hard thing to keep under my hat.
It's like, no, guys, really.
Next week's episode is going to make you so mad.
But the only bummer about that episode is... It was kind of one of those things where it was like they definitely... Loki, you saw it, right?
You finally watched it or whatever?
Yeah.
They definitely went for...
It was an episode where you were reminded that it's a TV show and not really a job interview.
Because the decision that they made, Asuka got kicked off in favor of somebody who was quote-unquote more entertaining television.
And Asuka knows that's not a dig on her, but this person that they kept was causing drama and drama's ratings and so forth.
and Asuka you know was was generally trying to get the job done and so forth but unfortunately the way that whole challenge was set up it was going to be her the other gal and the other gal was starting fights so she was excuse me she had personality or whatever Jaffe said about her so um
Bummer about Asuka.
Very sad to hear about that.
And, you know, I get the sense she's kind of bummed out about the edit she got on the show just in reading her Twitter and stuff.
But I just want to say, you know what, I know, I think what bugs her is that they used a clip of her at the very beginning of the show.
I'm just guessing.
I don't know.
But I'm going to guess if I were her.
and DarkSakura.com.
I'm sure every person in the house said it was bullshit that he got to stick around because of course that's one person between you and the prize they chose to show her probably because they wanted to show her to remind people who she was because it was going to be her week to get kicked off the show you know so it was all editing garbage and all this stuff so you know it's unfortunate but I didn't think she looked like a bitch I think she looked like somebody who was fighting to be there
and that was what it was all about.
Best of luck.
I know she's not in chat tonight, but I think there was a con or something this weekend.
If we can get her back on the show to really now get the skinny on what went down, she definitely has an open invite to come back anytime.
Meanwhile, let's move on and talk about other video game news.
And we'll go with the rapid fire news.
Loki.
All right.
So let's talk a little bit about this is kind of cool.
It's a Vita game I'm definitely looking forward to.
And that would be Resistance Burning Skies.
It has been announced that it is coming out May 29th.
on the Vita, and kind of a side story to the whole Resistance series.
It looks pretty awesome, so I'm definitely checking that out.
Also, it wasn't part of this, but I believe Gravity Rush is also supposed to be coming out that same day as well, which is another really awesome-looking Vita game, which unfortunately
Unfortunately, due to the fact that you can only have one profile on your Vita system, I am not able to download to my Vita, which is annoying.
But yeah, so there's that.
And then on top of that, there's also this new arcade game that's coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
It's called Jam Live Music Arcade.
And what it is is it's kind of like...
A music creation remix program.
You can use your instruments, your Guitar Hero instruments, Rock Band instruments, whatever, with this, and you can actually remix some different songs.
It includes 30 licensed songs, including, I guess, stuff from Modest Mouse, Fall Out Boy, Fatboy Slim, Rise Against, Atmosphere, and some other artists.
and we'll be coming out I guess on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network later this year so that's kind of cool at least something to maybe dust those instruments off for and then finally the next piece of download content has been announced for well the date has for the Saints Row the third game Gangstas in Space it continues on
One of the endings of the game where you are filming a movie and it's really cheesy, kind of like a parody of old Star Trek episodes or whatever.
It's just really, really ridiculous.
But there's going to be that.
It's coming out for $6.99 on the 21st.
I will probably download it because I like Saints Row, so I don't know why I just didn't get a season pass.
Of course.
I gotta say this though, it better be longer than the last DLC because the last DLC I finished in an hour and that's bullshit.
How much was it?
$7.
That is absolute bullshit.
And I gotta tell you this much, they aren't already starting off on a good note because I thought the whole gangsters in space mission at the end won the alternate endings was kind of stupid, but whatever.
That's too bad, because the first hour of that game, I've never laughed so hard in my life.
That game is awesome.
No, don't get me wrong.
That game is awesome.
It's just how they're treating the whole download content thing is just really annoying.
And trust me, if all three of these pieces of download content are terrible like this, I'm just not going to buy any download content for you guys anymore.
There's still ways I can play this shit without having to buy it.
I have that option, but I'm not taking it.
I actually am purchasing download content.
Speaking of DLC, I just want to insert something here because I noticed it's not in the show role, but it's something I read because it sounds interesting to me.
Final Fantasy XIII 2 is getting a lot of DLC.
This is a very interesting path that Square's going down.
I wonder what this is going to do for future Final Fantasy games.
But I guess they announced one this week.
Not only are they doing another costume, and this one is Sarah with, you know, boobiedge.
But there's going to be like a side story mission now that will bring back Saz, who is, you know, an awesome character in Final Fantasy XIII.
He was the dude with the chocobo in his afro.
I guess he's going to have like a side mission or a side story thing.
And if you beat it, you get to use him as one of the quote unquote monster companions in the main game.
So that could be interesting.
But like Loki, I hope it doesn't disappoint in length.
I hope it's something that you can, you know, is rewarding.
I hope it has the same good storytelling as the rest of the Final Fantasy series.
Game does.
Meanwhile, other rapid fire news.
Pandora's Tower is going to be coming out in Europe in April.
Now, this is notable because Pandora's Tower is one of those Operation Rainfall games.
You know, one of the games that was big in Japan and people were like, why aren't these games coming out on the Wii over here?
Well, it's coming out in Europe in April, which means English translation.
Could it come out in America after that?
maybe by 2013 at this rate we'll see meanwhile the rest of us will probably have pirated it by then not that I endorse piracy but I'm getting pretty damn sick of why is the game in English and takes nine months to come over here and then it's exclusive to only one store excuse me
April 13th is the day that Pandora's Tower is coming out in Europe.
Pretty awesome there.
I guess the announcement came out with some Valentine's cards that they did online, which was a very strange tie-in, but whatever.
Metal Gear Solid, a little bit of Metal Gear Solid news this week.
The Metal Gear 3D demo, by the way, is out.
I haven't checked it out myself, but for those of you that are 3DSing, you might want to check out that demo.
otherwise Metal Gear Solid 4 is going to be ending its online portion this summer you might have already forgot that there was a whole Metal Gear portion online but it was Metal Gear Online it is going offline this summer and it's probably because well nobody's really playing it anymore
I guess the shop for Metal Gear Online is closing March 21st, and then in April you cannot make new characters, and on June 21st it is all going down.
Unfortunately, this is what happens to games that their servers aren't really used anymore, is that they take the servers down and use them for other games.
One other game announcement of sorts, or I guess it's more like a leaked.
Korea's game ratings board has leaked news about Dragon Ball Z Connect.
Bandai Namco, who's made all the other Dragon Ball Z games, is making this one as well.
Who knows what the hell this game will involve.
Let's hope it will involve dancing.
Not bad for a show that's been off the air in Japan since 1990-something.
Right.
But hey, how many times have they rebooted Ninja Turtles?
So...
How about a Capcom-related one?
There is a new Darkstalkers trademark in Europe.
Ooh, so maybe there's a surprise game coming out?
Maybe they're doing something in the vein of Street Fighter 3?
Who knows?
But that would be really sweet.
And we actually have been getting those constant reminders from Ono to...
Have a push on Capcom for more Darkstalkers.
He said this is all up to the readers.
They have to create the buzz.
They have to tell us.
They have to write the condition.
They have to send the letters out of plead.
I guess that was translated badly.
Next up, Hulu Plus is now on Wii.
And it is a $7.99 a month subscription.
And there will be a 3DS version out later.
But no one cares.
And in rock band news, we do have some Megadeth.
The Megadeth pack has Symphony of Destruction and Tout Le Monde and Public Enemy No.
1.
Symphony of Destruction has pro guitar and pro bass available for an extra buck.
but um there are um you can get the full albums of Peace Sells but Who's Buying and Rest in Peace cause you know for me it's all about playing Sweating Bullets done alright Megadeth you know I'm gonna say this Megadeth is not great but they had some great songs I mean freaking Dave Mustaine got kicked out of Metallica for a reason but I don't know I think Sweating Bullets is probably their best song
I gotta go back to the Darkstalkers news a little bit here.
Obviously, that was some big news.
DungeonBuster in our chat room at chat.orange.com says, I'd love another Darkstalkers.
Dude, I don't think you're alone.
I would really get a kick out of that.
And it would make sense for Capcom to go back to that.
You know, they've had Street Fighter 4.
They're gonna have this whole Street Fighter cross Tekken.
I wouldn't be surprised at all if Darkstalkers kind of gets that treatment for 2013.
It's all about three, one move and two characters.
Mm-hmm.
No, reverse that.
Two moves in one character.
The succubus attack.
What was it called?
The pleasure something?
Dimitri's Midnight Bliss, where he turns the character into a female version, sexy female, and then sucks him dry.
And then... Nasty.
And then Jetta, who is just disgusting.
With the fetus, the god fetus stage.
All right, we're going to get back into some more news here in the mailbag in just a moment, but I do want to make sure I put out a call.
The last call for tweets for tonight, twitter.com slash OLR.
If you have any statements you want to make on what we've talked about tonight or if you have any questions for us, we'll take those via Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR if you want to add us and tweet at us at OLR.
Loki, you've got quite a little bit of news about one franchise, don't you?
Yeah, Assassin's Creed Revelations has done pretty well, so of course it makes sense that they're going to do another Assassin's Creed game.
It's something called Assassin's Creed 3.
Yes, that's confusing because it's not the third Assassin's Creed game, but whatever.
It's coming out October 30th in North America, so it's not too far away.
Definitely in time for the fourth quarter rush.
and for good reason of course Assassin's Creed Revelations shipped nearly 7 million units worldwide and to make a comparison with another popular franchise Just Dance shipped 13 million units worldwide that's in the last year but if you remember though Revelations though that came out back in November so it's had a lot less time to do that so it's pretty cool
of course also there's going to be some download content coming to Revelations as well the new download content is called Assassin's Creed Revelations Lost Archives it's going to be $15 and some of the achievements have already leaked out about it and it's supposed to be a single player campaign as well including 10 new achievements so, neat
Lots and lots of Assassin's Creed news, but I guess when your franchise is popular... Yeah.
The whole Assassin's Creed 3 thing doesn't bother me too much, though.
I mean, think about how many Mario games there have been that have had all these different numbers.
Like, you had Mario World, then you had a bunch of other Mario games, then they went back and did Mario World 2.
So, you know, Mario 64 wasn't really the 64th game in the series, although it may have felt like his 64th appearance.
All right.
Well, I find this next story kind of interesting.
Classic FM is a radio station in the UK and they're trying to do a Hall of Fame contest that has what they consider the most inspirational and worthwhile compositions of the year the public votes on this so there's a campaign to try to get Final Fantasy Aerith I always want to say Aerith because I grew up that way but Aerith theme for Final Fantasy 7 as a song that's recognized which you know
Love or hate Final Fantasy 7, you gotta say that's a damn fine composition and fits in well with the classical theme
It's interesting to me kind of how much we've seen the video games kind of dip into classic music just within the past, I don't know, I want to say like five, six years, whenever they started Dear Friends.
Because Dear Friends, there's, you know, of course, Video Games Live, which was, I wouldn't really say as an eye dot the opera, but it definitely brings classical music and rock music together, you know, in a way.
But of course, Play, the video game orchestra, you know, there have been several of these.
And of course, there was More Friends, which really was not good.
I was there you guys, it was a mess but for the most part now we have what, the Zelda tour is happening right now and all this other stuff so there's definitely been a push to
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
That actually wasn't my favorite music in the game, to be honest.
Really?
My favorite music in the game was the Jenova boss fight music right before that.
But see, that's not something that's really classic.
You know what I mean?
No, but I'm serious.
I thought the Aeritha scene was actually kind of boring.
Really?
And it wasn't really musically exciting.
I like really challenging and musically complex pieces.
So that's why I really liked the Jenova theme.
It was...
What was that particular Jenova theme?
Okay, go ahead and play some of it.
Well, I was going to play the Aerith theme because I see a comment in our chat room here at chat.orangelandredo.com Kaijudo says, I played Final Fantasy VII three times and I don't remember that theme.
I'm like, what?
All right, so here, yeah, I know.
But you know something?
Here we go.
This is right when she gets killed.
And this music is kind of used as an incidental throughout the whole game.
But it's sad.
It's pretty, but it's just... What it did at the time, though, this was so fucking revolutionary for video games.
You know, it really was.
I realize there's seven haters out there, but you've got to recognize there was nothing like this in games until here.
Yes, we had characters die in games before, but they didn't die on CD media in an epic RPG.
Well, Seles did throw herself off a cliff.
Right, but she blinked and disappeared, you know?
This was, like, big, you know?
Well, find the Jenova thing.
What was the actual name of it?
Do you remember?
It was... Hold on.
I think I can get it.
Just the Jenova theme?
No, it was... No, this wasn't it.
It was... I think it was the Jenova Absolute.
That's the one I liked.
Oh, I remember this too.
Because it was like the play on the fight theme.
And you know what?
I shouldn't dog this compared to the other one.
I mean, it definitely invokes the mood.
You know, a lot of the boss music in these games is supposed to get you pumped up.
But see, that's my thing.
When I look for musical pieces, I look for the complexity of the piece.
I'm not saying I didn't like the Aerith music, even as much as I hate the bitch herself.
Okay.
It's just, I thought her theme was a little formulaic.
I really did.
Yes, it needs to be recognized.
I think this is a much more mature piece of music, just saying.
Well, what's interesting, you know, despite whatever game you're going to pick from these games, you know, the fact that I don't think this station would otherwise get as many votes as they're going to get now that there's actually a Facebook campaign trying to get Nobuo Uematsu's theme recognized.
And you know what?
No matter what song they pick, Nobuo Uematsu himself should be recognized because that man has contributed so much for video game music.
Not just Final Fantasy, but some games that get grossly overlooked.
I met him.
Oh yeah, I sat two seats away from him.
Remember that?
When I went to your friends?
But I'll tell you, the other person that I met in music gaming who has been inspirational to me was Koji Kondo.
I was trying to get into the whole topic of does a video game theme deserve to be treated as a classical nod?
I say yeah, why not?
My one thing about this is that now if that was a full... Because keep in mind, the versions of the songs of Final Fantasy VII were rendered with the game engine.
If they had taken actual... Because, I mean, they're synthesized.
It's clearly synthesizer music.
It's very complex synthesizer music, but that's what it is.
If it had been classically recorded with a full orchestra and then presented, I think then maybe it could qualify.
But then you'd be looking into electronic music.
There's the Dear Friends version.
There was an event in Japan that preceded Dear Friends and inspired it.
Was it 2-2-2002?
It had some type of numberation in it.
Black Mage's CDs Black Mage's CDs
Video Game Music
Oh, um... Why is his name escaping me right now?
He's like one of my favorites.
I know who you're talking about.
Oh, God.
Alzheimer's setting in early.
No, Rob.
Yuzo Koshiro.
Yeah.
All right.
Let's move on.
This is the part of the show where we're going to go to the mailbag and read your emails.
Every week you guys email us at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura dives into the email bag head first.
It's a little sticky.
And reads the emails.
Sorry.
Mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio.
I spilled cranberry juice on it.
And this time I won't bitch about your grammar.
Hello, OLR.
After last week's episode, I felt a little compelled to write an email to you guys again.
I wanted to express how much I admire what you three are doing for such a long time.
Volunteering isn't always easy.
I'd like to tell my own story, if that's okay?
I guess.
You wrote along enough email.
Hey, every gamer gets a voice.
In my voice.
10 years ago, we started a team to rebuild the local playground.
It really needed a lot of work to be safe and nice again.
Of course, we have to raise money, and we organized a festival that lasted three days.
More than 60 people helped us, from local youth to older people.
People always have a great time during the festival because, just like you, we try to be very down-to-earth.
DarkSakura.com
and yes, sometimes I don't feel like I'm doing anything and sometimes it feels a little tedious but you pull through when in summertime you hear children play, laugh, scream and cry in the playground their parents read a book or their grandparents just sit and watch the grandchildren play it makes it all more than worth it it feels good to create a little space for people to be themselves and have a good time without having any troubles for a little while
I think that's a great thing.
That's volunteer work, essentially.
That's volunteering for your community and doing good.
A lot of people do that stuff and don't get paid a single dime.
I don't think you're crazy for only getting three days pay or whatever it was.
I think that they're actually raising the money for charity for the sake of keeping the playground upkeep.
That's great.
I think that's great.
OLR does that for its listeners too, I think.
Well, at least for me.
You guys are very down to earth too.
You don't go bragging about how fantastic you are or how you are just so outstanding at games.
I am.
No, I'm kidding.
You're just normal everyday people with the same problems as everyone else.
And funny as hell too, I do miss Rob Floods.
I don't.
I'm sorry if this email is a little long but it really comes from my heart.
You were three hours of feel good in a very troublesome time for a lot of people.
Thank you for doing this show for so long.
I hope it can go on for some time because without it I'd feel kind of lost.
You guys are awesome.
Yours truly, Fabrice from Belgium.
Aw, big hugs.
Yay.
All the way for Belgium.
And Rob.
What do you want, woman?
A cookie.
I hate you.
No, you don't.
You love me.
You know what, though?
I appreciate that.
Because I actually claim I don't want to be the best at gaming.
And I don't want you to think I'm the best at gaming.
I am just an average gamer.
Why would I be stupid enough to make that claim?
I know I'm not the best.
I am really good at Puzzle Bobble.
Just saying.
We all have our things.
No, we really appreciate it.
This whole show is kind of a way for us to get together on Sunday nights and just do this.
In some ways, it's become a habit.
I think we do this show out of habit at this point, but I don't know where I'm going with this.
When I have a week off, it feels really nice.
I'm not going to lie.
A week off here and there has been great, but if I had every week off, I think I'd be going like,
I'm really bored.
Yeah.
I really don't know what to do with my Sundays.
You know, without... Honestly, without the show.
Yeah.
You know, I actually feel... I hate to draw the comparison.
I feel the same way about babysitting Julian, too.
Because I love that kid.
And I love doing the show.
And I guess I like you guys.
I come here for Alan, really.
Alan and the cats.
Alan's only been in the picture for a couple of years, though.
He's only been living here for about 10 months.
There would definitely be a void in my life.
You know what's funny?
I was just talking today about the Oscars.
You know the Oscars are on next week?
Oscar Schmaskers
Even though, like, ten years ago, my friends would throw dinner parties where all the dishes were themed after the Best Picture nominees.
Like, how gay is that, right?
But it really happened, you know?
It's... This has just become a part of my life.
We've had scares.
Yeah.
We've had scares, but... But, you know, I'm gonna have to say this, is that even if...
The situation's made me move.
I would still try to find some way to make it work.
I would try everything until there was no other option.
I think even if OLR were to end, I mean, there is going to come a day where OLR ends.
Everything comes to an end.
Next week.
No, not next week.
Stop it.
But something will happen or whatever, and for whatever reason, we'll choose to end it.
But I just don't see me not podcasting.
I'd probably still do something.
I just have too big of a mouth.
Well, and we've actually, however we're going to make it work, still have a project in mind that kind of got put on the back burner because of stuff and things.
But we have stuff planned.
Curse that stuff and things.
I know.
All right, let's move on with emails.
This one comes from Haseo Sumi Ragawa.
And I'm not going to rag you on your grammar this time.
Like I said, I'm being a good girl.
She wants to get hired this week.
Capcom!
You know what?
I have to get a job this year.
I have to.
I know.
So all of you out there listening, you want to hire me.
I'm really amazing.
She doesn't like selling french fries, you guys.
I'm not going to work fast food.
I know you're not.
Dear OLR, Okay, recently I purchased a copy of The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Game of the Year Edition.
Now I'm enjoying it for the most part with the exception of one thing.
The Game of the Year Edition has a glitch in which when you are... Oh, shoot.
I sent this before.
I've read this email before.
You have?
Yes, I have.
Did you send it again?
Thanks for reading my email.
Yeah, it's the same email.
Elder Scrolls games broken, go figure.
Okay, last email.
Hey guys, Sterlok here.
Hi, Sterlok.
I'm sad to see the Cage Match ending after so long.
I've been listening since 2007.
I've discovered some great music thanks to the Cage Match, particularly the Birthday Massacre, Pendulum, and Goldfrapp.
That's all three of us, our big picks that we've done.
That is interesting.
Mm-hmm.
Because I, Birthday Massacre was my thing.
Pendulum is Loki's thing and Goldfrapp was definitely from you.
That is true.
I like Goldfrapp though.
I'll definitely miss it as it was a big part of my week and something I always looked forward to.
Well, maybe, maybe I'll suggest a song for you every week.
There'll be something, yeah.
Jamie will start a music advice blog.
You know, actually though, I did like the suggestion of post-show turntable.
D-Light I met her once
Nobody knows who she is, I'm sure.
All right.
Okay, so the rest of the email.
Yes.
That being said, however, I do respect your guys' decision to end the segment.
It's not fun for you anymore.
It's a little silly to continue, and you should devote your energy to something fresh and new.
I, like many die-hard Olarians, sort of see you guys as family.
I eagerly look forward to seeing whatever you come up with next.
Also, I have a podcast recommendation for Jamie.
Ooh, okay.
Thank you for watching!
Thank you, Sterlok.
You're such a sweetie.
I have the perfect idea.
What?
We're going to start a Tumblr that you, me, and Loki all have access to and we will post songs we think are cool.
Okay.
That's it.
And if people want music recommendations, we'll have a place where you can go look.
Okay.
And the great thing, unlike Cage Match, you'll be able to press the stop button.
You know what?
You know what we should call it?
Huh?
We should call our new Tumblr OLR Cage Match.
Fuck yeah, Cage Match.
Okay.
Yeah, fuck that cage message.
I swear to God, if one of you registers that, I'm going to go do it right now.
Hurry up.
Rob.
Well, okay.
I am actually... You know, I was actually thinking that...
I miss doing the comic book podcast I used to except comics are kind of they kind of blow now but I was thinking you know what we haven't seen there's classic gaming podcasts but there's no real history of gaming podcasts you know what I mean so okay I just want to throw the idea out there guys who would be interested in a history podcast like history of gaming
I would like to know who was interested in that and just email the mailbag also to the people who won Master System Games I am sorry I have had a midterm last week I have been uber busy I'm very sorry just send me an email it's my personal email which I have given you guys because only a few people out there have my real email and I will take care of it
as soon as I get paid.
Okay, I did it.
FuckYeahCageMatch.tumblr.com Okay.
I got it.
You know what song you should put up there first?
It should be from both of us.
No, I'm going to put the Troll-A-Lol song up first.
Okay.
The one last week.
Ho.
Why would I not?
Ooh, 10 hours of Troll-A-Lol.
What?
I want you to put Beth Dito up there.
I will start putting good songs on there later.
It's the same password as... I shouldn't say that.
As something else, I'm not going to say.
The same one we use for everything else except for that stuff?
Don't fucking say that.
I was being silly.
I said for everything except for that other stuff?
Yes, exactly.
God, no one knows what our password is anyway.
Except for Ranma.
All right.
Lord.
Anyhow...
Rob, you make me ashamed.
Why?
I'm just kidding.
Don't say that.
You make me sad.
Rob, you should get me some Pinkberry.
No.
See, that's the reason why we're actually quitting Afterbirth so we can go get Pinkberry after the show.
We've decided that Pinkberry is more important.
I'm kidding.
I actually, hearing people being positive about the end of the cage match, it's not really just the cage match, it's the whole Afterbirth, makes me happy.
But you know what makes me pissed off?
Rob not starting the FUs of the week music I didn't know that we were done with the mailbag mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com and now the FUs of the week
I guess I really don't have an FU.
No, I'm kidding.
FU to not having an iPad and my hand hurting like a bitch while I was trying to eat a Mongolian barbecue today and for Rob telling me that my dinner was stinky.
It was a little stinky.
It was just garlic and onions and lamb and moms.
And an FU to me not having an awesome job.
Capcom!
I want to work for you I would be a proud employee of Capcom but then I couldn't talk about your games on OLR anymore that would be a good reason to end OLR though, just saying Jamie got a job at Capcom, we have to end the show MDAs, ending the show you and Loki could keep it up I would just show up as your celebrity guest it would be weird we'd have to change the name it would be Rob and Loki on games because it wouldn't be OLR anymore
Yeah, so really though, I mean honestly, I am kind of in pissy mode about not having a job.
And also F you to my girl bits.
For not growing a small person.
I finally gave up and opened my bottle of chocolate wine.
My mom was 37.
I don't want to be 37.
Ever!
No, I'm kidding.
Yeah, I gave up and I opened the bottle of wine I was saving for getting knocked up.
So, done.
It'll happen.
Don't get discouraged.
You know what, I have a co-worker going through a very similar thing.
No, I'm done.
I'm done.
Loki, your FU's of the week.
Thanks for watching!
So, fuck you to eBay for even having that as an option of something to feed back on because, really, they have all that information, they're just being fucking lazy so they can hold your money.
Alright, my FU of the week.
Actually, all things considered, I've had a pretty good week, so I can't complain too much.
So, I regretfully have to give an FU of the week to Sanrio, who's one of our cats.
She decided to claw me this morning when I picked her up because I banged my head on the door and it scared the shit out of her, so she clawed me.
And it hurt.
So, FU to the cat for clawing me.
So, there you go.
No KTs for you.
KT is short for a word I can't say because the cat understands what it means.
And she will run in here.
Yes.
It rhymes with bitty meats.
KT.
So they actually know what that means and they'll run out here screaming.
You know, I actually never have to say the word around Shermie.
Really?
I just have to say, is it time?
And she'll go, mm.
They know.
They know.
Shermie loves her greenies.
Alright, there it is, your FUs of the week.
That segment will not be going anywhere anytime soon, just so you know.
I realize it has nothing to do with games, but you know what?
We don't care.
Sometimes we're mad.
Loki!
You mad?
More gaming news.
You mad, Rob?
You mad?
I'm mad.
2.0.
Heart.
Alright, so let's talk a little bit about indie games and, you know...
No one's going to disagree with the fact that they're kind of hard to find sometimes.
Microsoft seems to kind of bury them pretty well within their new dashboard revisions and the like.
So, of course, it's up to the indies to take matters into their own hands and launch their own Xbox Live Indie Game app for Windows Phone 7.
So they have done that.
There's actually an app that ties with Xboxindies.com and it gathers different feed data based on that.
And you can actually search and link to the actual pages where you can buy them and send them to your Xbox using this app.
and some other features that they're adding that aren't really part of the indie games portion of the dashboard as it is are like some dev picks and recommendations based on that kind of stuff.
So, that's kind of cool, and apparently this is going to be coming to other phone operating systems like Android and iOS later on, but right now it's just Windows Phone 7.
But really, it's kind of sad that they even have to do this because the fact that it's just so poorly laid out on the current dashboard, but, you know.
It is what it is, so... At least now you can find that if you happen to have a Windows Phone 7, although I don't, so... Oh well.
I find that interesting, though, that the community is helping to fill in the gaps.
It's just sad that they're treating it the way... I mean...
I mean, it's just, it's really hard to nail down that stuff.
I really wish that Microsoft's web interface was better because you know you can find all those indie games on Xbox.com or whatever but it's not easy to navigate that store and I think it would be really great if they would build something in the web because I think that's a great feature to be able to queue up Xbox downloads from the web I did that with the DLC I bought this week for Rhythm Party just so I wouldn't forget to do it I think they should use the web more to promote the indie games they really should
Well, that's just my thought.
Alright, well, speaking of, you know, things we can't believe have been implemented by now, I still can't believe that Apple has not put out an official, tangible game button device that works with the iPhone and iPad.
Yeah, it's been third party.
Yeah, it's always been third party.
Well, one of the biggest ones is the iCade, and...
Icade is getting adopted as the standard now
IK8 is now putting out a new controller that's called the 8Bitty.
It is basically an NES controller.
It's totally what they're jacking here, except it has four buttons instead of two.
But hey, the NES controller was a great controller.
Kind of flimsy looking back on it.
But when I was 11, that thing was rock solid.
$25 if you want this thing on ThinkGeek, and it will work on all the games that the iCade cabinet works with.
There's a D-pad, start, select, and four buttons.
I don't know what they're called, but they're there.
There you go.
And it looks neat.
It looks a little Atari to me, which is strange because it's the 8-bitty, but it looks like it has kind of like that wood paneling look on the sides, and then kind of that rainbow color that kind of some of the old Atari art had.
So it's kind of a mishmash of different video game worlds.
IKAD
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
there is the Vespula dual-sided gaming mouse mat, the Black Widow Ultimate gaming keyboard, the Razer Onza Tournament Edition Xbox 360 controller, the Chimera Xbox 360 gaming headset, iPhone 4S protection case, and N7 messenger bag.
So this is kind of big bucks of stuff.
But it's all Mass Effect 3.
What do you think?
I actually have a Razer mouse now.
I got one on Woot, the Tron Razer mouse that came out for that.
I really love that mouse.
My only complaint is that I tend to click the side buttons when I don't intend to, so I had to actually just disable them because one of them was set to mouse sensitivity, and that would really screw me up mid-raid.
But otherwise, I love that mouse.
I love that it lights up and plays the Tron music.
The geek in me giggles every time.
Well, the other thing about this, too, is that on Razor's website, they're saying that this Mass Effect 3 Collector's Edition peripherals and gear come with a redeemable code to unlock bonus items for Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, including the Deadly Collector Assault Rifle to give you a leg up on the Reaper invasion.
I'm quoting here.
If you have already unlocked the Collector Assault Rifle, this code will strengthen the weapon further.
And, of course, the game comes out in the U.S.
on March 9th.
That's kind of interesting, bundling the DLC with peripherals.
But I guess, I mean, at one point there was DLC on Pepsi bottles, right?
So I guess this isn't anything too new.
You know what we need?
To entice the real fans.
Sega needs to get their ass in gear and give us Pepsi, man.
But the problem is, here's the thing.
I mean, I'm not into Mass Effect, but I know a lot of people that are.
And if I was into Mass Effect, like, I wouldn't want that mouse anyway because I have the Tron mouse now.
1-877-GAME-OLR
Alright, I know this is going to come as a shocker to you, so please be prepared, but Activision is making another Call of Duty game.
Get out.
And it's coming out this fall.
Shut the front door.
I know, it's just...
I cannot believe that kind of news.
It just boggles my mind.
I don't even know why websites are running this story because it's stupid.
Here we are reporting on it.
Here we are.
Yeah, there is a few French retailers, I think it may have even been Amazon, that listed Call of Duty Black Ops 2.
Well, goody.
Then on top of that, there's also this now developer, not really a developer, but kind of...
contract art studio employee he had listed one of the pieces that he worked on was Call of Duty Black Ops 2 of course now he has that taken his whole profile is taken off of LinkedIn but um
Yeah, I mean, come on.
If you're surprised of this news, then you're an idiot.
I mean, because there is seriously... This is just crazy talk.
I mean, what's gonna happen next, Loki?
Madden 13?
There's already Madden 13.
I just... My mind is blown.
I know, man.
I know.
I don't know what to tell you, but...
I mean, there's not going to be a Guitar Hero 6.
There may actually not be a Guitar Hero 6.
There's a possibility that there will be, but yeah.
All right.
One more news story for you guys.
Then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
Due to the delay, it's probably actually already open by the time you're hearing this.
This is a quick story.
This is about the interesting repercussions of the Kickstarter campaign.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
The folks at InXile Entertainment are going to start a Kickstarter, at least they've mentioned their intentions to.
They did Hunted the Demon's Forge, but the game that they want to use Kickstarter to do is fund a reboot of Wasteland.
Brian Fargo, who's the CEO, recently got the rights to this role-playing game that was on the PC back in 98, question mark?
I guess it's really a cult popular title because fans have been asking for a remake and it's very early in planning but after seeing what happened with Double Fine the CEO Brian Fargo is on board and they would have to raise a million dollars for that to happen I've got to be bluntly honest I played a lot of old school PC games and especially Commodore 64 growing up this game did not ring a bell to me and I'm sure there's fans of the game that are like Rob you're stupid you suck
But I did not know of Wasteland ever.
I went and looked it up on Wiki.
Yeah, it's apparently what Fallout's based off of.
Is it?
Okay, well now that makes sense.
Yeah, I was looking, even in the little screenshot, there seemed to be some kind of comparisons, but yeah.
This series is really old.
It goes all the way back to... It was 88, not 98.
That's how old this game is.
Apple II and Commodore 64 and all that.
See, I don't remember playing it on Commodore 64, and God, I thought I'd played everything.
So...
That'll be interesting if that can actually get rebooted.
But who knows how many people will be willing to put their money where their mouth is.
Dungeon Buster in our chatroom says, Wasteland is awesome.
Yeah, but will you pay 15 bucks to see a new one in advance?
We'll see.
The Skype line is now open.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
Go ahead and give us a call.
We're going to take some calls before we close out the show.
In the meantime, we're going to move to our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
Our first tweet tonight is from Dark Tetsuya.
There's an indie game jam type thing I'm going to be partaking in, so wish me luck.
And sends us a link to this thing at Glorious Train Wrecks.
What in the world is this?
Pirate Cart 5...
Okay, you gotta tell me what this is.
We're making loads of awesome and or terrible games and taking them to GDC to blow minds with them.
Over the weekend of February 25th to 26th, everyone is invited to make as many games as they can and submit them here.
After the event is over, we will package the games up into a launcher like we did with previous Pirate Cards.
And then this March, we will be showing them off in a kiosk at the Game Developers Conference.
And they want everyone to participate.
That's kind of interesting.
Like, please, make...
All these games, we just want to flood.
It's almost like, let's throw something against the wall and see what sticks.
I don't know how else to phrase that, but we've got a call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
Who's this?
It's me, Swamp Tom.
Hey, Swamp Tom?
Yeah.
Hey, what's up?
None much.
This is my first time calling, obviously.
I was going to say, I don't recognize the name, but welcome to the show.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You're on the west coast!
It's not that late!
Yeah, but I work night shift.
I don't get off of work until like 4am.
Alright, you're excused then.
And the only reason why I remembered was, because I don't know about you, but on Sundays, like Loki, I usually eat a big ass burger.
And I think it's because I'm getting older, I fall asleep after I eat.
So it's like, I get food coma, so by the time I wake up, it's like 9 o'clock.
And it's already over, so there's no point.
Yes, I have had similar things going on.
It's usually after work.
I'll come home from work and it's like, nap.
I mean, you probably do something similar, but of course you also work the night shifts, so there you go.
Yeah, it sucks.
That's the reason why I'm gaining weight, too.
I eat and I sleep.
Time to start playing Rhythm Party and walk a mile every day.
Yeah, I can't do that, though, because I get home at four and I live in an apartment.
Oh, yeah.
Isn't Seattle kind of nice, though, or are there bad parts?
Yeah.
There's bad parts.
I love Seattle for the record.
Like Tacoma.
I'm kidding.
No, Tacoma is actually pretty bad in a lot of ways.
I know, but I didn't want to actually say that.
We went to PAX, obviously, a few years ago, and then I was in Seattle.
I just went for fun January of 2010, I think.
I know, because you were there for Martin Luther King.
You were going to see a friend or something.
Are you a stalker?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
there's some money questions that have to be answered in my life as I'm sure we all have going on this year but I swear I'm doing everything I can to come to PAX this year because I miss it so this year you will know what I look like last year for some odd reason the tickets sold out really quick and I couldn't find any tickets for the three day passes so I had to buy Friday, Saturday and Sunday all separate yeah that sucked get in on it early this year to what do we really owe the call?
this call's been five years in the making what's on your mind?
Well, like I said, I was reminded that the show was on tonight because I was half asleep and I was watching a movie called, well, it's a dumb movie.
It's 17 again.
It's on Netflix.
I've actually heard it was really good.
Yeah, well, for the time, yeah.
But anyways, they go into like this club and it's called Orange Lounge.
And I was like, oh, Orange Lounge is on.
So I turned on the computer and here I am.
We're going to fucking sue their asses for jacking our name.
Yeah, we'll do that when the Moba Moga people get us.
Yeah, that's right.
Konami could probably get us first.
But we're Orange Lounge Radio.
Yeah, there you go.
There's the radio part.
But anyways, my question was, why don't you like Terraria?
Oh, God.
I knew it.
Rabid Minecraft-y fans calling in.
Why do you hate our game?
I don't hate it.
I just didn't understand it at all.
Like, I'm trying to play it.
Here's the thing.
I think you have to be an artistic person to get into those games.
And if you ever saw my art, which is ironic because I did the design thing for a little bit.
Like, I don't know why I was able to do that.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I didn't hate it.
In a way, WoW was like that for me too.
I started, but I played for like two minutes because I was like, I don't know what to do.
I don't know where to go.
When did you play WoW?
Huh?
When did you play WoW?
Was it recently or a long time ago?
It was like a year and a half ago.
That was Cataclysm then.
Might have been.
With the Cataclysm expansion, they redid the beginner stuff, so it might be a little better now.
I hated WoW before that, and I really like it now.
Oh, yeah.
And plus, I have no friends to talk to.
So it's just like I'm walking around and like I'll see a character and I'll talk to him or at least I think I'm talking to him anyways.
And like, I don't know.
I just feel like I'm barging in or like I'm like a stalker.
Like, hey, look, there's a person.
So I go over there, talk, and then they just walk away.
I'm like, oh, it's like real life.
It's weird.
People in WoW don't want to talk.
Wait a minute.
You have no friends in WoW, but you've got friends IRL, right?
No, not really.
Well, because I work night shift.
I have friends from school and stuff, but when I want to hang out, everyone's sleeping.
He seems like he's mentally stable, at least from what we're getting in this call.
I'll be your well, buddy.
We'll be your friend.
You can add me on Steam.
Yeah, I have Steam too, but I have no friends on Steam.
So it's like, there's no games to play with anyone.
Because I look on forums and stuff, because there's shows that have forums, but
Like every now and then I look in the forum and there's trolls all the time.
So it's just like, wow.
No, no, no.
There's a safe place on Steam for you.
You're going to go to orangelaunchradio.com and on the left-hand side there's a little box that says – or no, now it's in the upper right.
It says interact with us.
I don't even know my own damn site.
And there's a little picture of the Steam icon and that will take you to the OLR Steam community.
And we have one rule in the OLR Steam community and that is – Don't be a dick.
Don't be a dick.
So you're not going to get that.
And if you get it, I want screenshots and you report their asses to me and I will sick Jamie on them.
I will slap a bitch.
And if you want to find me, I'm not there as DarkSakura, I'm there as Kurosabasa.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I am smart, but I don't understand the whole 8-bit and 16-bit.
But it's got kind of like that same aesthetic.
So that's why I was wondering why you didn't like it because I know you like older games.
And it's 2D.
It's not 3D.
I played Minecraft.
I hated Minecraft because it's 3D, but the world looks like crap.
Thank you for watching!
from previous versions of the game it's just they keep adding on to it and it's just something very addictive about it and like me and my girlfriend like uh sometimes on the weekends we'll play and we'll make our own house together okay wait a minute wait a minute no stop stop you don't have friends but you're getting laid you have that's why that's why you don't have friends that's why you don't have friends and this is the woman saying it no i'm kidding i'm kidding okay i'm glad i'm glad at least you're getting taken care of all right
I'm getting taken care of in that way but you know after a while when you live with someone for like two years we've been together for four but like after a while you kind of want friends you know sure like okay you want to go out on a double date once in a while yeah we're not married but if we are is this how it's going to be I'm going to tell you something when I moved out here from Alabama all I had really was Dan and his friends and actually one of his friends became my best friend Becky
Um, but it wasn't until I actually started venturing out to the arcades when we had good ones and made friends on my own and found other groups that I could get involved with.
I'm now like three people, like three or four people that I met at school are now really good friends of mine.
And I will say this on Jamie's behalf.
The best road trips that Jamie and Dan have ever taken have been with me.
They really have because Rob's heard us fight.
I will say this though.
Every time I go to like – because there's GameWorks in Seattle.
Every time I go there and I play DDR, there's like this one weird person that like walks up to the DDR machine because I'm pretty good at DDR.
And licks it?
I can beat Max 300 pretty easily.
but like people will just like come up to me just stare at me when i'm done they like kind of follow me you know and like ask me questions and like cling on it's kind of weird so i kind of just stopped with that scene wait did you say they ask you questions and cling on uh they cling on oh because i was gonna say you should just reply yeah uh i just get weirded out that's it
Yes.
Yes.
I don't know if there's an easy way to handle it.
You can either be nice if you want to or you can just be like, okay, you're violating some kind of code here and you gotta go.
Yeah, but that's the thing.
I don't say that to people because I'm kind of nice and I don't want to get in those situations.
If I was in that position, I'd be like, oh, this guy's a dick.
So I don't really do that.
I just kind of brush him off lightly.
I smoke, but I don't smoke that much.
So if someone follows me, I know that
they don't smoke because you can tell a smoker from a non-smoker sure so i'll just smoke you just have to breathe in their face like kind of it's like my repellent like like bees it's kind of like smoke you throw them on bees because you don't want them to sting you so they just run away wait a minute you're a smoker and you can beat max 300 yeah that's a pretty big achievement i mean i gotta say i'm not going to judge you for the smoking thing because i smoked for years but i would have never been able to beat max 300 as a smoker
Well, yeah, it's pretty easy.
I mean, like if you smoke and you regularly exercise, you get used to it.
Alright, well, you know what?
I gotta let you go so we can get more calls, but I will give Terraria a second chance.
And seriously, go to the Steam community, and I see people giving out their name in chat right now.
You can have people to play Terraria with.
I love the show, and do not quit, because if you quit, I'm gonna find you in LA or wherever you are.
Sacramento, but that's all you get.
Alright.
It's like Seattle, but less rain.
All right.
Yeah.
All right.
Later.
Later.
That was a fun call.
I let it go on a little longer.
Usually I try to keep it five minutes, but hey, he was a long time listener for some time.
I spelled mine out in chat, so.
1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Laundry Radio.
By the way, I just want to say with that last call, I'm not endorsing smoking.
It's just I'm not going to be that guy that's like, you need to quit smoking right now.
Trust me, smokers, they know the choice they're making.
And I've heard the pros and cons.
And you usually just have to have something happen where you're like, okay, I'm going to quit.
So that's what happened to me is finally I just hit a point where something happened.
And I was like, you know what, I'm now going to quit.
So anyhow.
I just wanted to talk about the article you were talking about video game music being in the hall of fame
Yes, the classic music in the Hall of Fame.
What do you want to say about it?
Well, basically you talk about whether it should be recognized as classical music or it should be recognized there in the Hall of Fame.
And I think, and this is a very strong opinion of mine, that it should be recognized as music by everyone.
Well, absolutely.
But what about classical music?
That's the key thing.
Well, that's the thing.
I don't consider it as classical music, at least.
Because, well, you're talking about genres and all that, and video game music is more, how do you say it, contemporary?
More modern?
Yeah, I agree with you.
So as classical music, I don't think it should be categorized.
So like that, I don't think so.
But it should definitely be recognized.
Alright, well, I mean, it's just, I think there's a lot of like contemporary classical, which is a really weird term, but I guess it's like, you know, when you kind of write your music with that classical sound and you're influenced with that, and I don't know, I get that, I get that sense, like it's very, I think that's why things like Dear Friends work, is that they feel like a night out at the orchestra, but it's music I killed monsters to.
Well, the thing with me is that classical music is more like Beethoven, Mozart, things like that.
And while some music, especially in Final Fantasy, that is heavily orchestrated, well, it sounds like classical music, but it isn't.
It isn't a classical piece.
It's an orchestrated modern piece, but it isn't classical.
Okay, okay.
So maybe they're just, and I'm sure there's a better word to define this genre of music.
You know what it makes me think of?
It makes me think of fusion, like Vanessa May.
Okay.
And what, like if I were to look in a CD store, wouldn't that be like adult contemporary?
But then that makes me think like Celine Dion or something.
It would be under instrumental.
Yeah.
Okay, okay.
or sometimes you find them under world music.
Sometimes.
Do you think that if this gets enough votes I was going to say one more place you find video game music there is under soundtrack sections because I find it all the time at Dimble.
True.
Do you think if there is... Oh, I like this comment from Blackwolf in our chat at chat.orange.radio.com.
Classical is a style of music, not an era of music.
Maybe a different way of thinking about it.
Maybe you're thinking about classical in the era sense.
But all this stuff aside, what it is or what it isn't, we just know we like this music.
do you think if it wins the poll do you think that the UK radio station will ultimately recognize it or do you think they'll reject it as like oh it's these silly gamer fanboys are doing this and we're just gonna throw their votes out
well they maybe recognize it and all because well the people bought it for it so I don't think why it shouldn't be but like I said and maybe BlackWool has a point but like I said it isn't classical in the sense that it it hasn't like
Like I said, it isn't very classical.
It isn't something from the 1800s or the 1700s.
It's modern.
It's something like... It's recent.
And there's other outside of video games that also have...
Black Wolf is a musician and is trained for that but this is my opinion and like I said it isn't for me.
Video Game Music Ever
That is a very tough question for me, especially since I'll make a little plug here.
I love that song, I love that music, articles we do for all our, me and Dr. Tsuya.
We try to pick, at least in my personal perspective, I try to pick something that it is and that recognized.
But if I had to pick one soundtrack that I really, really like, it should be, and I think I may...
Maybe I will think of another in the future, but I think the Silent Hill 2 soundtrack is awesome.
Interesting direction.
No, it's great.
It is.
That's a great pick.
Interesting direction.
That's not one I usually hear people say is their absolute favorite, but it's really damn good, so I'm not surprised to hear that at all.
Akira Yamaguchi is great.
He's a great guy.
Yeah, Akira Yamaoka is like my one of my favorite composers if not the best in video game music.
And definitely not something I would call classical.
Alright.
Definitely.
On the same note, I actually prefer Silent Hill 3.
That soundtrack.
Yeah, but still, it's all Akira.
That's really good.
Alright, Actdeft, I gotta let you go to try and get one more call in before the end of the show, but have a great night, okay?
You too.
Alright, thanks buddy.
Quick, one more quick call we cannot make time for.
We're running a little long, but we took an extended break and then...
We had a long call there to start, but I'll try to squeeze in one more quick call.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio if you want to give us a call.
Twitter topics.
I got to get through those real quick.
I only got through the first one.
Tiger Claw sent in a couple quick ones.
I'll try to get out here quick.
BAFTA nominations, which we missed talking about on the show.
BAFTA is the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.
They have released the nominations for the 2012 Video Game Awards, which honors the top games from 2011, the year before, and
and they've nominated in various categories, Action, Artistic Achievement.
I don't really have time to read all of these games, but I will say quickly the Game Award of the Year, Batman Arkham City, Battlefield 3, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, FIFA 12, L.A.
Noire, Minecraft, Portal 2, Elder Scrolls, Skyrim, Legend of Zelda, Skyward Sword and Uncharted 3.
Phone.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, this is Bobby Blackwolf.
Oh, hey, Bobby.
What could you ever be calling in about?
What's on your mind?
So Wikipedia says classical music is the art music produced in or rooted in the traditions of Western liturgical and secular music.
So it's all about the style and not necessarily when it was composed because Leonard Bernstein was a great classical composer and he was born this century.
So does that mean that Kabuki theater music would not be considered classical because it's Eastern?
Basically, classical is mostly Western music, yeah.
According to a lot of the terminology here, it's usually American or European.
Where would you find something like Brian Eno?
Is that classical or is that considered New Age?
Probably New Age.
Because I've played both classical and I play New Age music.
as have I and Jazz.
So Bobby, what do you think?
Of course, Bobby, I got to let you plug your show here, which you're on before us at All Games Radio, of course, on Sunday nights.
But what do you think about the whole trying to push for video game recognition on a classical music station?
I think it's great because... And here's the thing.
Everybody's like, oh, well, that wasn't even the best song in Final Fantasy VII and blah, blah, blah.
Here's the thing.
You need to get the majority to agree with you and to be able to get something recognized on that platform.
And, you know, yeah, Aerith's theme...
was created on a synth and everything but the More Friends CD version, I know the concert sucked, but that CD version if you play that for somebody who doesn't know it's from a video game, they will think it's one of the most beautiful classical pieces they've heard in a long time.
and that's really the testament to that piece.
And yes, if somebody doesn't know it's from a video game, they will think it is a classical piece.
I agree.
You've got to rally the troops behind one thing or it's not going to work.
You're going to divide it all up.
So, you know, I think they just kind of had to say, you know what?
This is the song that had a huge moment that was notable in gaming.
We're going to go here.
You know, I can see that despite...
How, you know, whatever song from Final Fantasy 7 or even Final Fantasy 6 may be your favorite.
Like, if it were me picking a Final Fantasy song, I think Terra's theme from Final Fantasy 6 is like the greatest Final Fantasy song there ever was.
I think the marching version of that is the best.
Love it.
Well, I actually did a little more digging on this.
And actually, the Aerith theme that's in Final Fantasy 7 is not eligible.
Oh, no.
Why is that?
Here's why.
Because it was made for a synth.
but you can nominate one of the later versions so you know basically what they're nominating is that it was rearranged for an orchestra that is also applicable but also that Facebook fan page is not just concentrating on Aerith's scene that was the first one they actually like every week they're putting up a new classical piece from video games that you can also put in like Dragonborn from Skyrim
is currently also, they're trying to get people to vote for that.
They just want something in there.
Earth's Theme is just the one that's going to be the most popular, that most people are going to go into.
But they've got several suggestions of pieces that do fit the criteria that Classic FM has set.
They actually do have rules, and the original PlayStation 1 version of Earth's Theme does not count.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and they actually that was one of the other ones that they had suggested on that same Facebook page the story that Tommy T tells about that and I think he told on your show and ours about how Disney didn't want to give the rights to the visuals but then they heard it and you know not a dry eye in the house that's a powerful piece of music it really is
Yeah, so I mean, that's the thing is that, you know, classical music is not just an era.
People hear the term classical and think, oh, it's just Bach.
It's just, you know, it's just Mozart.
All right.
Bobby, before we let you go, we can't keep this going all night because we probably could.
But before we let you go, I got to put you on the spot too.
What is your favorite video game music of all time or at least one of them?
I should have thought about this before I called in, shouldn't I?
You might not have heard us ask Actdeft this.
Yeah, I was trying to speed dial in.
That's alright, because we asked him too.
What was one of your favorites?
You know what?
It's going to sound, because we've been talking about it, because I've kind of... The reason I'm kind of...
Prepping this up is because one of the 21st Century Orchestra is what we call ourselves because we don't like the term new age.
We've been kicking around a video game concert idea because we used to do movie stuff.
And we've been kicking around doing video game stuff and they've put me in charge of kind of putting in what we would do in this hypothetical concert that's actually probably not going to happen for years now.
and actually the piece that would be the most emotional and the most gratifying to play and to be a part of is actually Aerith's theme.
and specifically the More Friends version from the CD that's the fully orchestral and everything.
That's actually the first time I shed a tear in a video game.
Me too.
And so it's very powerful from that aspect and the way it would be phrased in the concert is because I know that Square Enix doesn't let people use their footage in concerts that aren't their own.
I know all about that.
So it would be kind of phrased around can a video game make you cry?
and basically, you know, we'd be showing like fan art and stuff of Eris and of that scene with that piece.
And that was going to be kind of the emotional high point of this theoretical concert.
So I'm really going to go with Eris theme just because of what it means.
I don't blame you one bit just because there's a reason why it's newsworthy right now.
Absolutely.
All right.
Well, Bobby, quick, plug your stuff before we let you go.
Contrary to popular belief, I do not hate Actdeft.
So if you want to listen to somebody who does not actually hate Actdeft, I'm on before you guys at 8pm Eastern, 5pm Pacific.
You're on All Games Radio.
The last 10 minutes of my show were actually me fucking around with OLR.
Oh, you can say the F word on our show.
You get to swear.
It's the side of Bobby you don't normally get to see.
I'm sorry I said bitch on your show.
That's okay.
It's okay.
You will get the podcast up again soon, right, Bobby?
I hope so, yeah.
We miss him.
All right.
All right.
Bobby Blackwolf, everybody.
Thank you so much for calling in.
Have a good one.
Capcom fires you.
You're fired too.
No, hire.
Hire.
Need to hire.
Get fired.
All right.
Anyhow.
All right.
We got to wrap it up.
I know there's some folks that wanted to call and get through, but guys, we have an important live thing happening tonight.
We got to get to before it's like one in the morning.
So I got to close up the Skype line.
If you didn't get through, tweet us, email us.
yell at us in all caps and chat.
No, don't do that.
But you know ways to get in touch with us.
Please do.
We want to know your thoughts and we'll share them next week on the show.
In the meantime, we've got to wrap things up.
Quickly, one more tweet here from Tiger Claw.
Quickly, quickly read this.
Robata Vengeance pits robots against genetically modified dinosaurs.
It was actually created by an Academy Award winner, Doug Chang.
He was the lead designer on Star Wars Episode I and II.
We'll say what you will about those movies, but at least the special effects were really good for their time.
They want to do it as an iOS game that's a full-scale rival to Infinity Blade.
Hmm.
I guess, oh, here's the deal.
Here it is.
It's another Kickstarter.
They're trying to raise $100,000 to get Robota.
Oh, boy.
Okay.
See, what did I say last week?
Pandora's box has been opened.
This is going to be interesting.
But I will say, it does sound pretty cool.
Pre-order your game now by securing your vested share in the development of this game.
That's how it's going to be.
Alright, that's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio, but we could not end the show if we don't go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
Your final thought tonight.
I'm going to read a quote from Buddha.
Please do.
Believe nothing no matter where you read it or who has said it, not even if I have said it, unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense.
How deep.
Loki, your final thought.
I hate MySpace.
But they got a million new users.
It's noteworthy again.
Dude, I went back to my page because I was looking through some of the songs I had uploaded there, and you can't download them anymore, even though I had it before where you could download them for free.
Because they don't want to give anything away for free.
You can share it on your blogs and bullshit like that.
And then it pulls up like, hey, I know you wanted to listen to your music, but how about some shit from somebody else?
No.
You're not fucking Pandora.
Although maybe you are Pandora.
Hey, they got to bite off somebody who's making money.
Alright, and my final thought of the day, everybody, is... Do-do-do-do.
Do-do-do-do.
Do-do-do-do.
Listen to O-L-R.
It's on right after Bobby.
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend about the show.
Word of mouth is how we get the word out.
We don't have a million dollar magazine behind us or website or any of that stuff.
It's all about word of mouth.
Help the OL Army grow.
Play Terraria with each other.
Don't be a dick.
We'll see you next week.
Have a wonderful, wonderful night.
See you next week!
Thanks for watching!
