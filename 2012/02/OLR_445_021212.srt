1
00:00:14,158 --> 00:00:25,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight, February 12, 2012, Blizzard files suit against Valve, Mass Effect gets iOS tie-ins galore, and could the next Xbox also have a tablet controller?

2
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:32,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Derp

3
00:00:56,721 --> 00:00:57,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Herp?

4
00:00:57,762 --> 00:00:58,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Herp?

5
00:00:58,642 --> 00:00:59,923
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's going to be like this tonight, huh?

6
00:01:00,683 --> 00:01:01,183
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing?

7
00:01:01,703 --> 00:01:02,864
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually a little sore.

8
00:01:03,144 --> 00:01:03,884
[SPEAKER_09]: You're a little sore?

9
00:01:03,984 --> 00:01:04,565
[SPEAKER_09]: In the hand.

10
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:05,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-oh.

11
00:01:05,505 --> 00:01:06,426
[SPEAKER_09]: In the handle region.

12
00:01:06,746 --> 00:01:08,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you've had hand problems.

13
00:01:08,787 --> 00:01:14,169
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because of the rain and I spent the last three days typing, renaming files for the American River Review.

14
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,431
[SPEAKER_09]: We did our art submissions and I submitted five pieces.

15
00:01:19,974 --> 00:01:28,684
[SPEAKER_05]: You are one of the stars of NBC's community, in a sense, where you're going to community college and you're on yearbook, right?

16
00:01:29,185 --> 00:01:30,046
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll put it this way.

17
00:01:30,606 --> 00:01:34,651
[SPEAKER_09]: This makes a yearbook look like a fanzine in comparison to Vogue.

18
00:01:34,691 --> 00:01:35,832
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in yearbook in high school.

19
00:01:35,953 --> 00:01:37,715
[SPEAKER_06]: They have yearbooks in high school?

20
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:38,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

21
00:01:39,137 --> 00:01:41,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, by the way, over there, Techmaster Loki.

22
00:01:41,398 --> 00:01:42,019
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you, Loki?

23
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:43,340
[SPEAKER_05]: They have yearbooks in high school?

24
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they did.

25
00:01:44,141 --> 00:01:45,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Or not high school, college?

26
00:01:46,422 --> 00:01:46,823
[SPEAKER_05]: They could.

27
00:01:47,623 --> 00:01:54,168
[SPEAKER_05]: They did because my parents met at Modesto Junior College, I'll say it, and there was a yearbook.

28
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:55,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, of course they have yearbooks in high school.

29
00:01:56,891 --> 00:01:58,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in yearbook in high school because it's...

30
00:01:58,812 --> 00:01:59,252
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

31
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:18,702
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

32
00:02:31,272 --> 00:02:32,693
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

33
00:02:55,211 --> 00:03:06,385
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not usually the type to get strategy guides because, you know, you can kind of get it all on GameFAQs, but I gotta say, if you're a really big fan of a game, there's just some beautiful art and design in a lot of those books.

34
00:03:06,425 --> 00:03:09,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, they're just, they're good coffee table books for nerds.

35
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:17,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, and this one I was looking at with the collector's edition had like that, that big, thick kind of pillowy cover almost to it.

36
00:03:17,032 --> 00:03:20,093
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was not your standard books, I guess.

37
00:03:20,174 --> 00:03:26,576
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what the technical name is for it, but it was like, you know, it was like the type that if you threw it on the ground, it wouldn't leave any marks because it's like ploosh.

38
00:03:29,157 --> 00:03:32,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, those are done with, actually, I think, foam and embossing.

39
00:03:33,619 --> 00:03:39,602
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, I mean, the thing is, maybe I should save this for my FUs, but I'll go ahead and say it right now.

40
00:03:40,142 --> 00:03:50,547
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem with a lot of places that hire designers is they want you to have a four-year degree, and it doesn't matter really how much real-life experience you have and just have an associate's.

41
00:03:51,488 --> 00:03:51,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

42
00:03:52,168 --> 00:03:52,969
[SPEAKER_09]: It's stupid.

43
00:03:53,069 --> 00:04:00,139
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got tons of experience and... I'm like, well, tell them to reduce the tuition, please.

44
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:06,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know that I used to do design work before I worked at my current company, which I've been at for 10 years.

45
00:04:06,107 --> 00:04:07,088
[SPEAKER_05]: This was a long time ago when I was 21, 22.

46
00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:13,634
[SPEAKER_05]: I worked for a truck driver's magazine.

47
00:04:14,514 --> 00:04:17,396
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was just kind of the dude in the office.

48
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,178
[SPEAKER_05]: We all worked at the publisher's office.

49
00:04:19,538 --> 00:04:20,198
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a great staff.

50
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,619
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a very small office, seven people.

51
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,083
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was more like, I guess you could say kind of an administrative assistant to the publisher, sort of.

52
00:04:26,103 --> 00:04:28,344
[SPEAKER_05]: But I really did a lot of just different stuff.

53
00:04:28,704 --> 00:04:29,705
[SPEAKER_05]: I helped with subscriptions.

54
00:04:30,045 --> 00:04:35,209
[SPEAKER_05]: And one role I ended up taking on when one of the gals left, I started designing trade ads for the magazine.

55
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:35,990
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean...

56
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,673
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something I didn't... I just fell into it.

57
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:40,333
[SPEAKER_05]: It was weird.

58
00:04:40,553 --> 00:04:44,537
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not... I had yearbook in high school, but let's be real.

59
00:04:45,338 --> 00:04:47,559
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot more to it that I'm not up and up on.

60
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,941
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's just how the way the market is right now.

61
00:04:50,142 --> 00:04:50,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

62
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:51,563
[SPEAKER_09]: It's crazy.

63
00:04:51,703 --> 00:04:51,803
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

64
00:04:53,164 --> 00:04:59,147
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have no problem finishing my four-year degree if tuition was not so stupidly high.

65
00:04:59,847 --> 00:05:01,328
[SPEAKER_05]: And now you all know a little fact about me.

66
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:01,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's true.

67
00:05:01,928 --> 00:05:03,729
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to work for a truck driver's magazine.

68
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,210
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know if it's still around.

69
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:06,871
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it is.

70
00:05:07,011 --> 00:05:12,073
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, I got laid off because not a lot of truck drivers read magazines.

71
00:05:12,093 --> 00:05:13,314
[SPEAKER_05]: They all listen to satellite radio.

72
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:15,955
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyhow, let's move on.

73
00:05:16,455 --> 00:05:17,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Video games.

74
00:05:17,136 --> 00:05:19,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Techmaster Loki, how are you these days?

75
00:05:20,217 --> 00:05:20,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine.

76
00:05:20,758 --> 00:05:21,478
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta say this.

77
00:05:21,778 --> 00:05:26,983
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the popular games I like to play here at OLR before we get into the game talk is, what did Loki bring to the show tonight?

78
00:05:27,603 --> 00:05:29,505
[SPEAKER_05]: And Loki brought with him Jack in the Box.

79
00:05:30,586 --> 00:05:34,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, Jack in the Box, they have almost everywhere in the U.S., right?

80
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:35,590
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.

81
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,311
[SPEAKER_05]: But not in the Northeast, I think.

82
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:37,891
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have it.

83
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:38,332
[SPEAKER_05]: That's weird.

84
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:39,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's weird.

85
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:45,020
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have it because I know friends that live up in like Connecticut and stuff and when they come out here, they're like, we got to go to Jack in the Box.

86
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God.

87
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,506
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like, it's kind of like me and Dunkin Donuts because we don't have Dunkin Donuts here in California.

88
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:51,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Krispy Kreme anymore.

89
00:05:51,908 --> 00:05:52,829
[SPEAKER_05]: I need their coffee.

90
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:54,331
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have a Krispy Kreme in Roseville.

91
00:05:54,727 --> 00:05:56,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's still a Krispy Kreme.

92
00:05:56,348 --> 00:05:57,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's a Krispy Kreme.

93
00:05:57,088 --> 00:05:58,549
[SPEAKER_05]: They opened a Krispy Kreme in Roseville.

94
00:05:58,789 --> 00:05:58,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Where?

95
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:00,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Somewhere.

96
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:02,571
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one in Stockton, too.

97
00:06:02,771 --> 00:06:03,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but where's Roseville?

98
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:04,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Where in Roseville, though?

99
00:06:04,552 --> 00:06:06,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I can swing out that way.

100
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:07,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me Google that for you.

101
00:06:09,474 --> 00:06:10,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, Jack in the Box.

102
00:06:11,015 --> 00:06:13,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, they have the bacon milkshakes right now.

103
00:06:13,796 --> 00:06:16,097
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why I'm giving them free advertising, but whatever.

104
00:06:16,357 --> 00:06:18,279
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not on their menu, probably for good reason.

105
00:06:40,002 --> 00:06:46,627
[SPEAKER_05]: It did taste a little bit like the cheeses that they have out at the mall with the Swiss ladies at Christmas time.

106
00:06:46,647 --> 00:06:47,627
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that, the Hickory Farms?

107
00:06:47,767 --> 00:06:48,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Hickory Farms.

108
00:06:48,288 --> 00:06:48,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that it?

109
00:06:49,088 --> 00:06:52,270
[SPEAKER_05]: It did taste a little bit like... Like smoked vanilla.

110
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,191
[SPEAKER_06]: They made a bacon cheddar milkshake.

111
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:55,272
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be pretty good.

112
00:06:57,614 --> 00:06:57,974
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

113
00:06:58,474 --> 00:06:59,035
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, though?

114
00:06:59,055 --> 00:07:05,719
[SPEAKER_06]: That has inspired me to make my own bacon milkshake because this is just meh.

115
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:07,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Be careful the grease and milk don't curdle.

116
00:07:08,757 --> 00:07:11,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Eric RPG says, I want to go to a Psycho Donuts.

117
00:07:11,258 --> 00:07:11,938
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never heard of that.

118
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:16,759
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if that's like, if you live in Portland, there's a great place called Voodoo Donuts.

119
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:18,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Surely you already know this place.

120
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,040
[SPEAKER_05]: It's legendary up there.

121
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,801
[SPEAKER_05]: But Voodoo Donuts, which I had when I was up in Portland.

122
00:07:22,821 --> 00:07:24,902
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where you can get the donuts that look like penises.

123
00:07:25,502 --> 00:07:27,603
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can also get the bacon maple bars, Loki.

124
00:07:28,123 --> 00:07:31,344
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen that on Diner's Drive-Ins and Dives.

125
00:07:31,364 --> 00:07:32,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Food Network, right?

126
00:07:32,224 --> 00:07:33,044
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I've seen it on that.

127
00:07:33,984 --> 00:07:34,645
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it wasn't that.

128
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:35,005
[SPEAKER_06]: It was...

129
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:38,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, what the hell?

130
00:07:38,489 --> 00:07:39,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Man vs. Food.

131
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,330
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw it on there.

132
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,691
[SPEAKER_05]: They do weddings there too.

133
00:07:42,991 --> 00:07:43,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Video games.

134
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,172
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to get into this off the top of the show.

135
00:07:46,392 --> 00:07:48,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, you sent out a tweet this week.

136
00:07:48,613 --> 00:07:50,534
[SPEAKER_05]: You are parting with one of your video game systems.

137
00:07:50,574 --> 00:07:51,054
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on?

138
00:07:52,808 --> 00:07:55,390
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't play my 3DS, so I want to get rid of it.

139
00:07:56,811 --> 00:08:19,326
[SPEAKER_06]: And really, it came down to just, I was thinking, okay, Vita or the 3DS, normally I would get both, but I don't play my 3DS that often, so I was like, okay, what titles coming soon or this year or that have been announced or potentially would be announced that I would be looking forward to on the 3DS?

140
00:08:22,728 --> 00:08:27,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Kid Icarus, maybe another Mario title or Paper Mario or something like that.

141
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,275
[SPEAKER_06]: They did confirm a 2D Mario, right?

142
00:08:29,315 --> 00:08:32,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, there's another 2D Mario, but I don't really care.

143
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:35,482
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's maybe a Paper Mario or something like that.

144
00:08:38,463 --> 00:08:44,209
[SPEAKER_06]: I picked up Mario Kart, Super Mario 3 Land, and I played a lot of Mario Kart.

145
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:51,677
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't really play much of Super Mario 3 Land, but between those, I hadn't picked up anything since launch.

146
00:08:52,177 --> 00:08:58,383
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's a good nine-month span, basically, between games.

147
00:08:58,724 --> 00:08:58,844
[SPEAKER_06]: And

148
00:09:00,605 --> 00:09:04,127
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, the next thing I'd probably pick up would be Kid Icarus, which is in March.

149
00:09:04,588 --> 00:09:08,350
[SPEAKER_06]: And beyond that, I mean, it's just not a whole lot.

150
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:12,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas the Vita, I mean, they're porting everything to that.

151
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:13,574
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be a Call of Duty on that.

152
00:09:13,614 --> 00:09:17,036
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be probably the next Grand Theft Auto will be on that.

153
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,097
[SPEAKER_06]: I would not be surprised.

154
00:09:18,897 --> 00:09:24,421
[SPEAKER_06]: And just I think there's a lot more games on there that I would probably play versus my 3DS.

155
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:28,343
[SPEAKER_06]: And to be honest, I mean, the 3DS, it's kind of a letdown a little bit

156
00:09:29,324 --> 00:09:32,366
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a DS, more or less.

157
00:09:32,426 --> 00:09:36,888
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, with some 3D graphics that are just kind of like, eh, that's kind of neat.

158
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:48,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you think about, I mean, one, see, I'm not quite on the same side issue, but I'm also in a situation right now where financially I could get the V, because I just did taxes and I had a huge tax refund.

159
00:09:48,815 --> 00:09:51,997
[SPEAKER_05]: So I could get the Vita without having to part with my 3DS and I can juggle them both.

160
00:09:52,037 --> 00:09:54,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to feel like I'm losing something to gain something else.

161
00:09:55,079 --> 00:10:09,288
[SPEAKER_05]: But the more I think about it from your perspective, if you do sell your 3DS, it's not like you couldn't buy one later and they'll probably have the inevitable redesign that includes that second D-pad and we all know there's going to be some redesign in the future.

162
00:10:09,628 --> 00:10:11,109
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that's Alan's thing.

163
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,771
[SPEAKER_05]: He doesn't want to get a 3DS until the inevitable redesign.

164
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:14,291
[SPEAKER_06]: There will be.

165
00:10:14,352 --> 00:10:17,073
[SPEAKER_06]: There's absolutely going to be a redesigned 3DS at some point.

166
00:10:17,253 --> 00:10:17,353
[SPEAKER_06]: And

167
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:41,287
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's not even really a big deal for me either because it's it's just like even the next console generation I was kind of thinking about it and it's like I'm not gonna I don't think I'm gonna buy all three again you know it was kind of cool with the Wii it was like oh I gotta try that out because you know that is a completely different type of way to play games and the PS3 I honestly wouldn't have picked up at all but I got one for free so you know I'm not gonna complain there

168
00:10:42,547 --> 00:10:57,415
[SPEAKER_06]: and really I didn't play too much I've played a few games on the PS3 but not a whole lot and I still don't I hardly ever use it for Blu-rays I use it for streaming movies but I mean I could do that with my Xbox too

169
00:10:58,055 --> 00:10:59,535
[SPEAKER_06]: I play a lot more Xbox, but...

170
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:51,310
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't know well mainly it was before it was going to be that it was money was going to be the issue where I kind of just wanted a Vita and even then I was like do I really want a Vita I mean but yeah I do because there's actually some games on there that I would like to try out I'm not going to go crazy and buy like a bunch of launch games like I did with the 3DS I went a little crazy there um

171
00:11:53,450 --> 00:12:09,422
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't play Kingdom Hearts, otherwise Kingdom Hearts would probably be a big draw for me for the 3DS, but they don't have a date for that yet, it's still sometime this year.

172
00:12:12,236 --> 00:12:12,516
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

173
00:12:12,536 --> 00:12:13,858
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think there's going to be a lot of stuff.

174
00:12:13,938 --> 00:12:18,904
[SPEAKER_06]: And that system seems like such a step up versus the DS and the 3DS.

175
00:12:18,924 --> 00:12:21,267
[SPEAKER_06]: DS and 3DS, I mean, they're pretty much the same.

176
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially DSi, you know.

177
00:12:25,252 --> 00:12:28,856
[SPEAKER_05]: And even the 3DS in some regards is a step backwards.

178
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:30,337
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still Team 3DS.

179
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,418
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like my 3DS.

180
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:32,559
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to part with it.

181
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,983
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will say those DSi XLs, when Alan got one of those, those screens are gigantic.

182
00:12:38,043 --> 00:12:38,744
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

183
00:12:39,164 --> 00:12:41,747
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the best way to play DS games right now.

184
00:12:42,447 --> 00:12:46,570
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish the 3DS screens were that big, but I guess they have to save that for the redesign.

185
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:47,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

186
00:12:47,992 --> 00:12:50,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe it's more expensive because of the technology in those screens.

187
00:12:51,034 --> 00:12:51,414
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

188
00:12:52,475 --> 00:12:54,037
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a 3DS tablet.

189
00:12:54,697 --> 00:12:56,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wait, that's just a Wii U controller.

190
00:12:56,518 --> 00:12:56,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

191
00:12:56,638 --> 00:12:58,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

192
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:58,539
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

193
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:01,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Vita, have you gotten your hands on a Vita yet?

194
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I finally played one yesterday.

195
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,601
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I have not.

196
00:13:04,321 --> 00:13:09,943
[SPEAKER_05]: I played one at GameStop yesterday, which I know, yes, I walked into a GameStop and I didn't instantly turn to Ash.

197
00:13:10,343 --> 00:13:13,724
[SPEAKER_05]: But in my defense, I was at the mall and we were shopping at some other stores.

198
00:13:14,865 --> 00:13:18,646
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we were walking right by and I was like, oh, there's the Vita right there on the wall.

199
00:13:18,746 --> 00:13:19,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn it.

200
00:13:19,127 --> 00:13:20,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go in and take a look.

201
00:13:20,587 --> 00:13:22,588
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did get my hands on the Vita a little bit.

202
00:13:22,608 --> 00:13:27,429
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got to say, first thing I noticed right away, damn, that screen is big.

203
00:13:27,729 --> 00:13:31,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Like for a handheld, it's more like regular TV proportions.

204
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:35,491
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was kind of, okay, that's kind of neat.

205
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:37,531
[SPEAKER_05]: The analog sticks are tiny though.

206
00:13:37,591 --> 00:13:38,732
[SPEAKER_05]: That was interesting.

207
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:45,933
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're not, thank God, they're not like that little nub that's on the PSP that would hurt my thumb after using it for so long.

208
00:13:45,973 --> 00:13:46,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what the hell was that thing?

209
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:48,574
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like little tiny...

210
00:13:48,854 --> 00:13:54,682
[SPEAKER_05]: tiny little nubs, tiny little PS nipples that you can use to, you know, for whatever.

211
00:13:54,722 --> 00:13:59,408
[SPEAKER_05]: But then it's like, I'm standing there like an idiot, like, how do I start the damn game?

212
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:02,112
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I remembered, oh yeah, this thing has a touchscreen.

213
00:14:02,673 --> 00:14:04,876
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to touch the screen to get it to do anything.

214
00:14:06,818 --> 00:14:08,859
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

215
00:14:36,178 --> 00:14:38,759
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still kind of on the fence on if I want one or not.

216
00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:42,441
[SPEAKER_05]: And funny enough, it's kind of what's troubling Loki, and that is the games.

217
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:44,562
[SPEAKER_05]: But Loki, I got to say, you do make a good point.

218
00:14:44,822 --> 00:14:48,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the big franchises will probably inevitably come over at some point.

219
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,925
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I want that Final Fantasy X thing that they're going to do down the line.

220
00:14:52,945 --> 00:14:55,406
[SPEAKER_05]: If I were to buy the Vita at launch, I'm getting that Luminous game.

221
00:14:55,806 --> 00:14:56,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

222
00:14:56,306 --> 00:14:57,867
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a kick-butt song list and everything.

223
00:14:57,907 --> 00:15:01,208
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know I always have this fanboy boner for Q Entertainment.

224
00:15:01,228 --> 00:15:01,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

225
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:06,411
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, speaking, I just thought it was kind of ironic and funny.

226
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:09,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Ridge Racer is no longer a launch title.

227
00:15:10,173 --> 00:15:15,475
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if it didn't sell very well at all in Japan and they went back to fix it and add tracks.

228
00:15:15,776 --> 00:15:16,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hope.

229
00:15:16,356 --> 00:15:17,797
[SPEAKER_05]: But didn't Ninja Gaiden get bumped up?

230
00:15:18,037 --> 00:15:18,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there was kind of a...

231
00:15:19,017 --> 00:15:21,339
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's just that the news is too slow.

232
00:15:21,499 --> 00:15:26,422
[SPEAKER_06]: They're behind in getting release dates and stuff like that, so it's been launched for a while.

233
00:15:26,942 --> 00:15:43,634
[SPEAKER_05]: It does kind of concern me a little bit, too, that there's a lot about the Vita that's still kind of a question mark, even though the damn thing's out in Japan, and there's a lot of stuff that ought to be there that's not, and I gotta admit, one of the things, I know a lot of people are like, well, if you want it, just go play your PSP or go hook up your PlayStation 1.

234
00:15:44,214 --> 00:15:46,656
[SPEAKER_05]: The PS1 game's not playing on the PlayStation Vita.

235
00:15:46,796 --> 00:15:48,317
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, why not?

236
00:15:48,957 --> 00:15:50,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't understand why that doesn't work.

237
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:58,041
[SPEAKER_05]: If that thing is supposed to be as powerful as a PlayStation 3, why can't it successfully emulate the PlayStation 1 games?

238
00:15:58,421 --> 00:16:03,903
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there's a highly technical answer, but from a consumer standpoint, I'm like, damn it, I bought Final Fantasy 5.

239
00:16:04,743 --> 00:16:05,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to play that and go.

240
00:16:05,984 --> 00:16:12,226
[SPEAKER_06]: They just have to get the emulator to work because they still don't have full backwards compatibility with the PlayStation portable stuff.

241
00:16:12,526 --> 00:16:13,866
[SPEAKER_05]: And they are working on that, right?

242
00:16:14,286 --> 00:16:17,887
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always weird to me when Sony's implementing all these features as they go.

243
00:16:18,247 --> 00:16:20,808
[SPEAKER_05]: But then there's a part of me that watches what happened with Microsoft.

244
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:29,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Because remember when the Xbox first came out, it was like, these handful of titles will be emulatable from the original Xbox.

245
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:32,170
[SPEAKER_05]: And they slowly added more and more to that list.

246
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:35,090
[SPEAKER_05]: And they said, we're not going to stop until they're all emulatable.

247
00:16:35,751 --> 00:16:37,211
[SPEAKER_05]: And they stopped about a year into it.

248
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,855
[SPEAKER_05]: and you still can't play the old DDR Ultramix games on 360.

249
00:16:41,195 --> 00:16:45,240
[SPEAKER_06]: At the same time, at least they're not shipping that system saying, oh, hey, look, internet browser.

250
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, internet browser coming in the future patch.

251
00:16:50,366 --> 00:16:50,526
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

252
00:16:51,127 --> 00:16:53,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I guess that's... Okay, Nintendo's guilty of the same thing.

253
00:16:53,249 --> 00:16:54,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, look, I want to buy a game.

254
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:55,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sorry.

255
00:16:56,273 --> 00:16:57,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Store coming in the future patch.

256
00:16:59,276 --> 00:17:01,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to use the second analog seat.

257
00:17:01,778 --> 00:17:04,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo was married to that March release date for whatever reason.

258
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:04,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Or April.

259
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,401
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell month did it come out?

260
00:17:06,661 --> 00:17:06,901
[SPEAKER_05]: March.

261
00:17:07,001 --> 00:17:07,481
[SPEAKER_05]: March, alright.

262
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:09,082
[SPEAKER_05]: They sure were married to that date.

263
00:17:09,483 --> 00:17:12,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, because of the quarter earnings, right?

264
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, their fiscal year.

265
00:17:15,186 --> 00:17:36,225
[SPEAKER_05]: so I get maybe it's the same thing with Sony I mean yeah it's February but it's you know still maybe that's part of the reason why they got to get it out now oh well I'm sure I'll end up getting one inevitably because I really do want that Luminous game I really want it and then when the Final Fantasy 10 thing comes out I'm gonna be like I want that too so

266
00:17:37,074 --> 00:17:53,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and just looking at some of the other stuff, like LittleBigPlanet on it, I'm not, you know, I don't play enough of LittleBigPlanet on the PS3, but just showing how easy it is to make stuff using that touchscreen, just like, okay, I want to make a hill, and I want to adjust it.

267
00:17:54,121 --> 00:18:01,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and I'm going to pinch it to make it a little bit smaller, and I'm going to rotate it, and I'm just going to poke at this stuff, and everything works perfectly fine.

268
00:18:01,785 --> 00:18:01,845
[SPEAKER_06]: It...

269
00:18:02,765 --> 00:18:04,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Vita is worthwhile at launch only if you don't own a PSP

270
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:34,412
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I do own a PSP, and I'm still kind of like, sort of want... And here's the other thing, too, though, and I don't know if you've done this yet.

271
00:18:34,952 --> 00:18:47,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember back when they gave you those free PlayStation Network games and the free PSP games as part of the reparations for the network being down for a while?

272
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:54,418
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't used those PSP games, so I actually have ModNation Racers waiting for me as soon as I get my Vita.

273
00:18:55,775 --> 00:19:01,300
[SPEAKER_05]: More comments in our chatroom at chat.org.com Ahamkara says, no HDMI port on the Vita.

274
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's kind of ass.

275
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:04,844
[SPEAKER_05]: What if you want to play your Vita stuff on the TV?

276
00:19:05,324 --> 00:19:06,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?

277
00:19:06,285 --> 00:19:06,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Me!

278
00:19:07,066 --> 00:19:08,647
[SPEAKER_05]: I like hooking up the PSP to the TV.

279
00:19:09,758 --> 00:19:10,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but who cares?

280
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:11,400
[SPEAKER_06]: You know why?

281
00:19:11,861 --> 00:19:18,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, first off, who's to say that you're not going to be able to stream that stuff from your Vita to your TV in the first place?

282
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:27,059
[SPEAKER_06]: And whoever fucking uses stupid cable, so you actually use the cables to hook up to your TV, you like being tethered six feet away from your TV, was that fun?

283
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:27,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

284
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:55,316
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean because I had actually okay hold on hold on smarty pants when I'm in the bedroom on the TV in there and I'm kind of lying on the bed that six foot tether is just enough where yes I can lie in bed and play Final Fantasy 4 and have a fat day where I am fat and I am playing PSP in bed on my TV I mean the only one that was actually that would make sense doing that would have been like the PSP Go where it actually had you know DualShock 3 Bluetooth support

285
00:19:56,056 --> 00:19:57,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, hey, there you go.

286
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:01,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Bluetooth support, you know, you could maybe do something like that later on.

287
00:20:02,344 --> 00:20:03,346
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't care.

288
00:20:03,386 --> 00:20:04,888
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a big screen in front of me.

289
00:20:04,928 --> 00:20:08,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do I need to hook it up to my TV that has some weird resolution on there?

290
00:20:09,554 --> 00:20:10,435
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't need that.

291
00:20:11,596 --> 00:20:15,298
[SPEAKER_06]: If I want to play on my TV, I'll use my PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360.

292
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:21,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Spaznator in our chatroom says, I don't want to get a Vita due to the shit I've gone through with my PlayStation 3 and my digital downloaded videos.

293
00:20:21,881 --> 00:20:23,341
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, history can burn you.

294
00:20:23,942 --> 00:20:28,764
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know Spaznator's called into this show before to talk about his trials and tribulations.

295
00:20:28,804 --> 00:20:33,386
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got to say, yeah, I can see where he's coming from because it's me and Microsoft right now.

296
00:20:33,786 --> 00:20:43,092
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel very apprehensive with, like, I don't want to buy things on Xbox because my wallet will be, you know, stolen from yet again.

297
00:20:43,352 --> 00:20:44,853
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm feeling a little weird about all that stuff.

298
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:47,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas I'm sure some people are like, Rob, you're irrational.

299
00:20:47,575 --> 00:20:49,996
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't buy a lot of digital content, so it doesn't matter to me.

300
00:20:51,537 --> 00:20:54,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, especially since they're like, hey, you get 10% off.

301
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:54,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

302
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,902
[SPEAKER_06]: That's if we decide to discount it because Uncharted's not fucking discounted.

303
00:20:58,122 --> 00:20:58,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Or at least it wasn't.

304
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:00,063
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be discounted now.

305
00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:00,403
[SPEAKER_06]: But still 10%.

306
00:21:00,443 --> 00:21:00,944
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

307
00:21:04,557 --> 00:21:30,389
[SPEAKER_05]: let's uh let's move on so Vita so Vita yes for you launch day um hopefully Vita I is strong like leaning towards yes but I'm really gonna wait for that first week release thing that's Valentine's Day or whatever and see what the feedback is on that DarkSakura I'm pretty sure you said you're a no just due to personal situations but any interest in Vita I want an iPad

308
00:21:32,213 --> 00:21:34,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Just wait for an iPad 3 or whatever.

309
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:35,756
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to announce one at the beginning of March.

310
00:21:35,776 --> 00:21:36,016
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

311
00:21:36,036 --> 00:21:38,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, iPad 3 will be all HD and pretty.

312
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:39,059
[SPEAKER_05]: I want one of those, too.

313
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:43,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, I don't really give a shit about the Vita anymore.

314
00:21:43,782 --> 00:21:44,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Why's that?

315
00:21:44,643 --> 00:21:48,046
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it would be nice to have one, and I'm sure Dan wants to get one.

316
00:21:49,187 --> 00:21:50,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you psyching yourself out?

317
00:21:50,388 --> 00:21:51,829
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, I don't want a Vita.

318
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:54,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Vitas are shit because I can't afford it.

319
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:56,333
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm saying this.

320
00:21:56,893 --> 00:21:57,774
[SPEAKER_09]: I really...

321
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:05,800
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still playing games on my DS and I can't play for very long before I start to hurt.

322
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,401
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's sort of like I play anything that I want to on my phone.

323
00:22:10,441 --> 00:22:13,102
[SPEAKER_09]: I only have to use my thumbs and bust a move is all I need.

324
00:22:17,443 --> 00:22:18,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Bust a move is all I need.

325
00:22:18,724 --> 00:22:19,464
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, fair enough.

326
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:20,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on.

327
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:24,742
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to talk about our gaming weeks and the video games that we've been playing this week.

328
00:22:25,683 --> 00:22:28,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, you can always join us in the chat room to chat along with us.

329

332
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:52,412
[SPEAKER_05]: What did I say fucking last week when we were up against the Super Bowl?

333
00:22:52,452 --> 00:22:54,655
[SPEAKER_05]: We are always against some...

334
00:22:55,396 --> 00:22:57,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn national event on TV on Sunday nights.

335
00:22:58,158 --> 00:22:59,340
[SPEAKER_05]: And tonight it's the Grammys.

336
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,202
[SPEAKER_05]: But Adele's going to win everything.

337
00:23:03,503 --> 00:23:06,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Every star that gets on the stage is going to say something about Whitney Houston.

338
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:08,427
[SPEAKER_05]: And that'll be pretty much it.

339
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:09,128
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I'll miss much.

340
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:10,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Any good performances will be on YouTube.

341
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:11,510
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,251

[SPEAKER_09]: it'll be more spontaneous um let's talk about our gaming weeks DarkSakura we'll start with you what types of video games you've been playing this week best to move on my phone which um i'm trying to go back through and get all the medals now which i think i have most of them um so i can get like the proper ending of the game um and i'm uh play well addict dealer

344
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,991
[SPEAKER_05]: What's new with you in the world of Warcraft?

345
00:23:38,011 --> 00:23:39,212
[SPEAKER_05]: What have you been, like, your goals lately?

346
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:40,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Holidailies.

347
00:23:42,293 --> 00:23:42,974
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty much it.

348
00:23:43,554 --> 00:23:46,896
[SPEAKER_09]: I want a pink flamingo to run around and go, ooh, look at my pink flamingo.

349
00:23:48,437 --> 00:23:49,518
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm playing my troll.

350
00:23:50,945 --> 00:23:52,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Who cries and sighs all the time.

351
00:23:53,926 --> 00:24:00,229
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have another Horde tune on Ravencrest to play with other people.

352
00:24:01,089 --> 00:24:01,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

353
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:05,251
[SPEAKER_09]: But, by the way, Rob, I did get the name today for the Death Knight.

354
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:06,531
[SPEAKER_09]: R.I.P.

355
00:24:06,551 --> 00:24:06,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Whitney.

356
00:24:08,252 --> 00:24:08,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Good for you.

357
00:24:09,652 --> 00:24:10,853
[SPEAKER_05]: So, just letting you know.

358
00:24:11,213 --> 00:24:15,555
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe Grandpa Warcrafter, as he goes by in our chatroom with Salvelos, would be proud.

359
00:24:16,215 --> 00:24:18,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Because he had RIP Steve Jobs.

360
00:24:19,056 --> 00:24:20,337
[SPEAKER_05]: I have RIP Betty White.

361
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:20,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Just waiting.

362
00:24:21,798 --> 00:24:27,781
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think he rolled another one when somebody passed away recently.

363
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:28,641
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember who it was.

364
00:24:28,781 --> 00:24:37,346
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually, because my one that's on the main server, I'm going to be, I'm learning how to tank on that one.

365
00:24:37,386 --> 00:24:39,847
[SPEAKER_09]: But this one, the other one is just going to be DPS for lols.

366
00:24:39,887 --> 00:24:41,188
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can go in and go, ha ha.

367
00:24:42,068 --> 00:24:42,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Star Trek Online F2P

368
00:24:50,437 --> 00:24:52,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I haven't checked out the very new stuff.

369
00:24:52,878 --> 00:24:57,839
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a really a lot easier way now to get some of the different costumes and goodies.

370
00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:03,441
[SPEAKER_09]: If you've got the cryptic points for it, you actually just will select it on the menu with all the rest of everything.

371
00:25:04,021 --> 00:25:09,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Like if you're changing your outfit and you want a certain piece of an outfit, you can just select that piece and pay your points then.

372
00:25:10,503 --> 00:25:18,685
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm probably going to be getting some cryptic points in the next couple of weeks and really giving it a go because I miss playing with my Scottish buddies.

373
00:25:19,805 --> 00:25:21,026
[SPEAKER_09]: But I still love SEO.

374
00:25:21,066 --> 00:25:23,647
[SPEAKER_09]: I went around and they fixed a bunch of stuff on DS9.

375
00:25:25,628 --> 00:25:26,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Deep Space Nine is in the game?

376
00:25:26,788 --> 00:25:28,309
[SPEAKER_09]: You can actually now go in the office.

377
00:25:28,449 --> 00:25:29,230
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been in the game.

378
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,830
[SPEAKER_09]: There were just parts that were closed off.

379
00:25:31,311 --> 00:25:36,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you can actually go in the commander's office and the baseball is sitting there.

380
00:25:36,573 --> 00:25:37,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Cisco's baseball.

381
00:25:37,914 --> 00:25:41,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, he is awesome-tastic.

382
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:42,676
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

383
00:25:44,601 --> 00:25:49,403
[SPEAKER_09]: I've had school and all this other stuff on my plate, so I still haven't sent out the games.

384
00:25:49,543 --> 00:25:49,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

385
00:25:51,263 --> 00:25:53,284
[SPEAKER_09]: And we were going to pick up our... Lazy.

386
00:25:54,044 --> 00:25:54,805
[SPEAKER_09]: No, busy.

387
00:25:55,145 --> 00:25:59,046
[SPEAKER_09]: We were going to pick up our duo today, but we just didn't get by there.

388
00:25:59,126 --> 00:26:05,449
[SPEAKER_09]: We were going to go by Dan's mom's house, but she had to go somewhere else, so we didn't get a chance to.

389
00:26:07,028 --> 00:26:08,349
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's go to Loki.

390
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Techmaster Loki, how was your gaming week?

391
00:26:10,232 --> 00:26:10,852
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't play much.

392
00:26:11,012 --> 00:26:13,635
[SPEAKER_06]: I was writing tutorials this weekend.

393
00:26:15,237 --> 00:26:18,961
[SPEAKER_06]: I played very little bit of Skyrim.

394
00:26:18,981 --> 00:26:22,865
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even remember what I did in there, but something Skyrim related.

395
00:26:23,025 --> 00:26:26,409
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was... Oh, yeah, I checked out Patch 1.4, which...

396
00:26:29,051 --> 00:26:29,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Sadly the same.

397
00:26:30,011 --> 00:26:33,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though it promised to fix the quest, it did not fix the quest.

398
00:26:34,612 --> 00:26:35,932
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the quest is too dead for me.

399
00:26:36,472 --> 00:26:37,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they push that to console finally?

400
00:26:38,153 --> 00:26:39,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it's to console now.

401
00:26:40,753 --> 00:26:44,794
[SPEAKER_06]: It was supposed to fix the Fire on the Ice... No, not Fire on the Ice.

402
00:26:44,994 --> 00:26:50,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Blood on the Ice quest and... No, it didn't.

403
00:26:51,475 --> 00:26:51,875
[SPEAKER_06]: None of mine.

404
00:26:52,255 --> 00:26:52,855
[SPEAKER_06]: It's impossible.

405
00:26:54,335 --> 00:26:55,116
[SPEAKER_06]: So, eh, whatever.

406
00:26:55,776 --> 00:26:55,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

407
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:58,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see then.

408
00:26:59,558 --> 00:27:01,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Some other miscellaneous quests I did.

409
00:27:04,202 --> 00:27:08,626
[SPEAKER_06]: I also played The Cat That Got the Milk, which was the free game I was talking about.

410
00:27:08,967 --> 00:27:14,312
[SPEAKER_06]: CatThatGotTheMilk.com And it's this weird... It's like a puzzle game.

411
00:27:15,012 --> 00:27:16,314
[SPEAKER_06]: And it gets all...

412
00:27:18,427 --> 00:27:19,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Call of Duty

413
00:27:48,868 --> 00:27:51,451
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty much the only area I can improve upon right now.

414
00:27:52,933 --> 00:27:56,738
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really frustrated now that my coworkers, they really don't like playing with me.

415
00:27:58,427 --> 00:27:59,427
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just too good.

416
00:27:59,447 --> 00:28:03,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I will purposefully run up behind them and stab them.

417
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:05,230
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the opportunity.

418
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's not a nice thing to do to your coworkers.

419
00:28:08,411 --> 00:28:10,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Or they'll be standing there or something like that.

420
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:11,693
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll sit behind them.

421
00:28:11,753 --> 00:28:15,934
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, okay, what's something funny that I could do to kill them?

422
00:28:16,175 --> 00:28:17,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm, something funny.

423
00:28:17,675 --> 00:28:20,316
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of my coworkers is prone under this...

424
00:28:21,937 --> 00:28:22,798
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com

425
00:28:39,768 --> 00:28:41,870
[SPEAKER_06]: God damn it, you were sitting there the whole time.

426
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:42,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kill me.

427
00:28:43,352 --> 00:28:45,774
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so hateful that at your work you can do this.

428
00:28:45,994 --> 00:28:49,837
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like you work at a frat house, for God's sake.

429
00:28:49,857 --> 00:28:51,339
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's just our 15-minute games.

430
00:28:51,379 --> 00:28:53,981
[SPEAKER_05]: We get two 15-minute games.

431
00:28:54,021 --> 00:28:55,723
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I do on my 15-minute breaks?

432
00:28:55,963 --> 00:28:56,684
[SPEAKER_06]: I take a walk.

433
00:28:57,504 --> 00:28:58,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I could do that, but no.

434
00:29:01,004 --> 00:29:02,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Call of Duty is where it's at.

435
00:29:16,628 --> 00:29:18,089
[SPEAKER_06]: So humble, so humble.

436
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:26,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I didn't know I was going to be good at it, because honestly, I had played Call of Duty 4 once before I'd actually played with them.

437
00:29:27,417 --> 00:29:30,419
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I was kind of at the same spot that they were.

438
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:38,546
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I believe that my boss, at least, had Call of Duty 4 already, and he's been playing online for like a while now.

439
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:44,891
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why he thought he had the advantage, but apparently I'm really good at that game.

440
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,632
[SPEAKER_06]: I also read up on everything.

441
00:29:50,113 --> 00:29:52,494
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good to be educated in what you're playing.

442
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:54,115
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anything else for your gaming week?

443
00:29:54,515 --> 00:29:54,795
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

444
00:29:54,995 --> 00:29:56,115
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, my gaming week.

445
00:29:56,516 --> 00:29:58,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty short because I didn't play a lot of new stuff.

446
00:29:58,416 --> 00:30:03,698
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing, when I'm not playing World of Warcraft, just like DarkSakura, Final Fantasy XIII 2.

447
00:30:05,139 --> 00:30:06,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Haters, stay pressed.

448
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Step off.

449
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:07,780
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great.

450
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,061
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm loving Final Fantasy XIII 2.

451
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:09,221
[SPEAKER_05]: It's...

452
00:30:14,363 --> 00:30:19,506
[SPEAKER_05]: It's such a different story than the last one in kind of the way they split it up.

453
00:30:19,586 --> 00:30:29,212
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really interesting that you go into one time and then you can go into a parallel timeline that's the same thing with a different result.

454
00:30:29,493 --> 00:30:30,093
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting.

455
00:30:30,273 --> 00:30:40,419
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have to correct one little thing I said in my review last week, and that is that you actually do get more than the two characters in your party, but...

456
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,181
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not really controllable.

457
00:30:43,381 --> 00:30:50,963
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like this extra character is just standing off to the side and kind of fighting with me, although I don't really watch their hit points or anything.

458
00:30:51,043 --> 00:30:56,305
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just didn't want to be corrected in my review last week because I've played a lot further into it now.

459
00:30:56,405 --> 00:30:57,645
[SPEAKER_05]: I did check out some of the DLC.

460
00:30:58,465 --> 00:31:06,568
[SPEAKER_05]: You can download right now the Lightning and her guy in charge of the squadron dude.

461
00:31:06,588 --> 00:31:07,328
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember his name.

462
00:31:08,168 --> 00:31:10,790
[SPEAKER_05]: You can play against them.

463
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:16,653
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess if you're able to beat them, you can use lightning as your summonable monster in battle.

464
00:31:16,713 --> 00:31:18,914
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can't beat them yet because I'm too low a level.

465
00:31:19,274 --> 00:31:20,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I guess I haven't played far enough.

466
00:31:21,555 --> 00:31:23,036
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm still working away at it.

467
00:31:23,216 --> 00:31:26,658
[SPEAKER_05]: I finally got to the casino in Final Fantasy XIII too.

468
00:31:26,758 --> 00:31:29,239
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was kind of fun to see some of the minigames.

469
00:31:29,259 --> 00:31:30,580
[SPEAKER_05]: They're bringing back Chocobo Racing.

470
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,802
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard that the Cait Sith was in the game as a summonable monster.

471
00:31:34,242 --> 00:31:57,784
[SPEAKER_05]: well but it's not it's not the Kate Sith it's not the guy in the big moogle that you remember from Final Fantasy 7 but it's a monster called Kate Sith in fact it's probably the first monster that you'll get and probably hang on to hang on to for a long time because it's a healer and it's one of the few healer monsters you get and plus it's a kitty and and the little special attack he goes wow and then you claw claw claw claw it's really funny so

472
00:31:59,352 --> 00:32:02,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm liking Final Fantasy XIII too, and I'm definitely going to play this to completion.

473
00:32:02,735 --> 00:32:07,140
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty much where all my gaming hours have gone when I'm not playing WoW or something else.

474
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:15,348
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say I randomly had an urge to play Bit.Trip Runner yesterday and try to get further in that game.

475
00:32:16,569 --> 00:32:18,691
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one, you know, it plays like the chiptune music.

476
00:32:18,751 --> 00:32:19,612
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard as hell.

477
00:32:20,012 --> 00:32:20,773
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like an older game.

478
00:32:20,793 --> 00:32:21,333
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on Steam.

479
00:32:21,654 --> 00:32:22,795
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where I play it on PC.

480
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:22,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

481
00:32:23,331 --> 00:32:30,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking maybe I played Cannibal this week because I remember... Don't start Skyrim.

482
00:32:30,847 --> 00:32:31,789
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll never finish it.

483
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:39,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, I'm looking in our chatroom at chat.orangelancerated.com Hey, Stan says, me too.

484
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Loves Final Fantasy XIII too.

485
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:46,109
[SPEAKER_05]: The use of enemies as a third character reminds me of Pokemon mixed with dog fights.

486
00:32:46,609 --> 00:32:47,910
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an interesting way to think of that.

487
00:32:49,291 --> 00:32:51,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Jester Scott says, by the way, you need lightning.

488
00:32:51,913 --> 00:32:55,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to get lightning, but I can't beat her yet.

489
00:32:55,596 --> 00:32:59,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Eric RPG says, actually, Sky, it's a 10% drop even at five star.

490
00:32:59,299 --> 00:32:59,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God.

491
00:33:01,093 --> 00:33:01,894
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

492
00:33:19,363 --> 00:33:31,571
[SPEAKER_05]: you got your wish prayers answered enjoy grind grind grind away um otherwise gaming a little bit Mario Kart 7 that's really it so

493
00:33:33,341 --> 00:33:36,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on and talk about some housekeeping tonight.

494
00:33:37,424 --> 00:33:39,445
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually have some really big news in housekeeping tonight.

495
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:45,870
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't want to promote this a little bit because not everybody's going to see this as good news.

496
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,232
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish DarkSakura was in the room, but she's in the restroom right now.

497
00:33:49,352 --> 00:33:50,272
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's all right.

498
00:33:51,173 --> 00:33:51,953
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll move on anyway.

499
00:33:51,994 --> 00:33:53,975
[SPEAKER_05]: She can say her piece afterwards if she needs to.

500
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:55,396
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

501
00:34:17,433 --> 00:34:31,264
[SPEAKER_05]: next week will be the final afterbirth that we're going to do and it's going to involve the ultimate cage match and we'll tell you more about that next week why we're doing it I think part of us kind of creatively

502
00:34:32,105 --> 00:34:33,386
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

503
00:34:53,527 --> 00:34:54,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

504
00:35:13,562 --> 00:35:17,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Creatively, unfortunately, I think the afterbirth has lost a lot of steam.

505
00:35:18,084 --> 00:35:23,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Those of us here that host the show kind of feel like we got to get our cage match song.

506
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:26,006
[SPEAKER_05]: We're stuck in the studio for another 20 minutes.

507
00:35:26,186 --> 00:35:32,668
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, it's kind of become this necessary thing we have to do every week.

508
00:35:33,489 --> 00:35:37,310
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, when creatively something's not working, you say, okay, we're going to change it.

509
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:38,810
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what we're going to do.

510
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:39,490
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to change it.

511
00:35:40,251 --> 00:35:49,273
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've decided to end the Orange Lounge Radio Afterbirth, and next week we are going to be saying goodbye to the Cage Match, which has been a part of our show for the past 425 weeks, give or take a few.

512
00:35:50,694 --> 00:35:57,015
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I realize our live listeners may see this as, oh, well, you don't care about your live audience anymore.

513
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:59,616
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

514
00:36:00,356 --> 00:36:01,216
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not about that at all.

515
00:36:01,817 --> 00:36:02,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Think of it this way.

516
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:14,152
[SPEAKER_05]: By doing that and ending the cage match, it opens the door for other possibilities and things we could better spend our time with once this show is over.

517
00:36:15,012 --> 00:36:17,613
[SPEAKER_05]: More information on that in the coming weeks.

518
00:36:18,033 --> 00:36:27,537
[SPEAKER_05]: But for now, we hope our live listeners will understand this creative decision to end this long time segment of our show that podcast listeners weren't even hearing anyway.

519
00:36:29,017 --> 00:36:30,237
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

520
00:36:30,317 --> 00:36:32,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Kaijudo in chat says, I'm going to read these.

521
00:36:32,898 --> 00:36:37,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Kaijudo in chat says, just saying you guys are getting lazy after birth is good times.

522
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:44,882
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that comment's a little bit unfair because, you know, it's not a lazy thing to be doing a show for the past 10 years every week.

523
00:36:45,742 --> 00:36:51,004
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think, too, you have to wait to see what the future holds.

524
00:36:52,785 --> 00:36:53,625
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we'll prove you wrong.

525
00:36:54,286 --> 00:36:58,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Hitstun says, I think we need an official post-show Turntable FM party.

526
00:36:58,729 --> 00:36:59,670
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be in support of that.

527
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:02,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not logged on to Turntable in quite some time.

528
00:37:02,992 --> 00:37:04,753
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love the iPhone app and all that.

529
00:37:05,113 --> 00:37:07,675
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am totally in support of that.

530
00:37:08,576 --> 00:37:11,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Ahamkara in chat says, play games after the show and stream it.

531
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:15,521
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been thinking about that as like a side project.

532
00:37:15,881 --> 00:37:17,502
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole Twitch TV thing and all that.

533
00:37:18,062 --> 00:37:18,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

534
00:37:20,024 --> 00:37:20,284
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

535
00:37:21,661 --> 00:37:23,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone want to chime in on this whole thing?

536
00:37:26,045 --> 00:37:27,406
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I said my piece in the chat room.

537
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:28,407
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'll say it aloud.

538
00:37:28,868 --> 00:37:29,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck you.

539
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:31,990
[SPEAKER_09]: We do this for free.

540
00:37:33,243 --> 00:37:37,968
[SPEAKER_09]: We do this as a service and we keep trying to think of new things to make things even better.

541
00:37:38,709 --> 00:37:43,714
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we're getting rid of something, we're doing it for a very good reason, not just because we don't feel like doing it.

542
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:44,775
[SPEAKER_09]: So fuck off.

543
00:37:45,456 --> 00:37:54,526
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can see, well, that's a strong reaction, but I can see where the strong reaction comes from in chat too, is that, you know, we've been doing this so long and then we're saying goodbye to it and it's like, ugh.

544
00:37:55,305 --> 00:37:56,727
[SPEAKER_05]: But wait, why?

545
00:37:59,129 --> 00:38:04,856
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my initial reaction to just an accusation of overt laziness.

546
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:05,516
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

547
00:38:06,478 --> 00:38:09,501
[SPEAKER_09]: And on top of that, I mean, Rob has a full-time job.

548
00:38:09,541 --> 00:38:10,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki has a full-time job.

549
00:38:10,562 --> 00:38:11,263
[SPEAKER_09]: I go to school.

550
00:38:12,725 --> 00:38:15,287
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we give up our Sundays for you guys.

551
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:29,558
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's nothing, I think, wrong at all for us, you know, trying to think of something new, some way to innovate because nothing ever grows without a challenge and without making small changes to it to make it grow.

552
00:38:30,842 --> 00:39:00,116
[SPEAKER_05]: so just chill there are some people in our chat that are like Brad from PodCulture says understandable and let's see TigerClaw says so there won't be a post show of any kind I didn't say that let's see Actdeft says nobody but one person is complaining so you know I think for the most part people get it that creatively sometimes we're not ending the show we're not ending the show so don't worry about that and there is something else coming

553
00:39:00,526 --> 00:39:01,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

554
00:39:01,987 --> 00:39:02,928
[SPEAKER_09]: So just deal with it.

555
00:39:03,328 --> 00:39:03,629
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

556
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:06,551
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, to be honest, we don't have to do the show.

557
00:39:07,292 --> 00:39:07,812
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, really.

558
00:39:09,093 --> 00:39:09,334
[SPEAKER_09]: But we do.

559
00:39:09,354 --> 00:39:10,174
[SPEAKER_09]: But we like doing the show.

560
00:39:10,234 --> 00:39:11,315
[SPEAKER_09]: I like doing the show.

561
00:39:11,375 --> 00:39:13,477
[SPEAKER_06]: I would free up a lot of Skyrim time.

562
00:39:15,118 --> 00:39:18,441
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I've got design work that I'm being paid for that I could be doing tonight.

563
00:39:18,601 --> 00:39:19,362
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know what?

564
00:39:19,502 --> 00:39:20,283
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm here doing the show.

565
00:39:22,145 --> 00:39:23,927
[SPEAKER_05]: The Vita Passport Service

566
00:39:39,646 --> 00:40:02,436
[SPEAKER_06]: If you owned a PSP and some PSP games, like UMD games, and you downloaded this application or whatever from the PlayStation Network that allowed you to mark the games that you had so that you could download them for a discount off of the PlayStation Network store and be able to download them onto your Vita.

567
00:40:02,476 --> 00:40:03,076
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a way...

568
00:40:03,556 --> 00:40:05,477
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

569
00:40:31,212 --> 00:40:31,712
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't care.

570
00:40:32,312 --> 00:40:37,855
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they think that we're going to abuse it because we're the type of people to abuse that kind of thing.

571
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:40,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Renting games or whatever.

572
00:40:40,176 --> 00:40:46,098
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how big rental is over in Japan, but I guess it's possible.

573
00:40:46,418 --> 00:40:49,560
[SPEAKER_06]: To be honest though, not really anyone rents PSP games.

574
00:40:52,821 --> 00:40:54,942
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little disappointing, I guess.

575
00:40:56,215 --> 00:40:58,676
[SPEAKER_05]: It's disappointing.

576
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:03,297
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be those people that are like, but if you want to play a PSP game, then you go get your PSP.

577
00:41:04,618 --> 00:41:08,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then don't offer the service in Japan and not in other territories.

578
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:09,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's that too.

579
00:41:11,321 --> 00:41:18,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then I'm also like, you guys are forgetting that, that PSP didn't have digital distribution in the beginning.

580
00:41:18,584 --> 00:41:22,885
[SPEAKER_05]: So those of us that were early adopters of the PSP, or at least I'm almost positive it didn't, right?

581
00:41:22,945 --> 00:41:24,806
[SPEAKER_05]: When the PSP launched, it didn't for a good year.

582
00:41:25,286 --> 00:41:27,107
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, longer than a year.

583
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:28,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was, it was a while.

584
00:41:28,367 --> 00:41:36,971
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, there was a lot of games I bought when the PSP first came out, like Luminous, which, you know, of course I'm always going to go back to that because it's probably the greatest puzzle game to come out in a long time.

585
00:41:36,991 --> 00:41:37,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and,

586
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:55,023
[SPEAKER_05]: and yeah I'd like to be able to have that on my PS Vita but granted the pain is numbed significantly when you consider there's an all new Luminous game coming out so it's gonna with an awesome soundtrack well yeah I probably won't need the old one as badly as I thought I did but okay what about Final Fantasy 4

587
00:41:55,803 --> 00:42:15,511
[SPEAKER_05]: the collection on PSP which is great it's the original game and it's that PSP graphics which are great and you couldn't download that on the marketplace at first so of course I bought it on UMD and it's like oh damn I'd really love to be able to have that on the Vita but I guess not unless I want to buy it again

588
00:42:17,177 --> 00:42:35,647
[SPEAKER_06]: and I guarantee you we'll go for the market value that it is right now exactly like you know Final Fantasy 1 and 2 those are pretty awesome games I mean they're like $9 retail now but they're probably going to be like $15 on the PlayStation Network store yeah that's kind of a bummer because now the PlayStation Network kind of controls all that and you know

589
00:42:36,923 --> 00:42:36,983
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

590
00:43:06,747 --> 00:43:07,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

591
00:43:08,308 --> 00:43:08,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

592
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:14,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else on the UMD passport system and all that good stuff?

593
00:43:15,773 --> 00:43:17,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Think there's ever a chance there'll be a drive?

594
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:18,255
[SPEAKER_05]: No, there won't.

595
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,316
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they're not going to make a drive.

596
00:43:20,356 --> 00:43:21,357
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think they should.

597
00:43:21,517 --> 00:43:24,059
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's ridiculous.

598
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:27,762
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't need to make a UMD drive for a PSP.

599
00:43:29,043 --> 00:43:33,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Grand Theft Auto is not one of the games that's backwards compatible.

600
00:43:33,947 --> 00:43:34,528
[SPEAKER_06]: That is so disappointing.

601
00:43:52,442 --> 00:43:56,947
[SPEAKER_06]: But I hope that that's because they're going to go and fix the camera.

602
00:43:56,988 --> 00:43:59,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Because before there was no camera option.

603
00:43:59,791 --> 00:44:01,393
[SPEAKER_06]: It was one analog stick.

604
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:03,475
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very difficult to play.

605
00:44:05,478 --> 00:44:05,998
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope they go back

606
00:44:28,885 --> 00:44:33,367
[SPEAKER_05]: No one's feeling shortchanged that the movies are not going to be playable or any of that stuff.

607
00:44:34,388 --> 00:44:35,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, same thing though.

608
00:44:35,588 --> 00:44:39,850
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation Network certainly has its share of movies that they want you to buy, download, and all that.

609
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:40,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's a thought.

610
00:44:41,731 --> 00:44:44,073
[SPEAKER_06]: How nice are movies going to look like on that screen?

611
00:44:44,993 --> 00:44:46,414
[SPEAKER_05]: They already look pretty damn good on the PSP screen.

612
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:52,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they have a lot of digital downloads, especially almost all the movies nowadays that come out on the Blu-ray combo packs or whatever they have.

613
00:44:53,498 --> 00:44:55,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you can download a digital copy of the movie.

614
00:44:56,544 --> 00:44:57,505
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not bad.

615
00:44:58,325 --> 00:45:00,727
[SPEAKER_05]: I always thought that was restricted to the iPhone.

616
00:45:00,908 --> 00:45:01,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

617
00:45:02,109 --> 00:45:03,590
[SPEAKER_06]: It's usually iPhone.

618
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:05,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony especially had the PSP ones.

619
00:45:06,252 --> 00:45:11,276
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think a lot of that... I mean, MP4s kind of play on everything.

620
00:45:11,656 --> 00:45:13,418
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the format they usually use.

621
00:45:13,852 --> 00:45:15,533
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not think about that.

622
00:45:15,753 --> 00:45:21,916
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I haven't cashed in my Tron... Why is the name escaping me right now?

623
00:45:21,956 --> 00:45:22,316
[SPEAKER_05]: The new one.

624
00:45:22,336 --> 00:45:23,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Tron Legacy.

625
00:45:23,797 --> 00:45:24,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

626
00:45:24,517 --> 00:45:35,263
[SPEAKER_06]: If I haven't cashed in my Tron Legacy digital copy download... Just check on the back of it because usually it'll say PC, iPod, that kind of stuff.

627
00:45:36,003 --> 00:45:39,365
[SPEAKER_06]: And you may be able to convert it.

628
00:45:39,885 --> 00:45:46,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Because a lot of the portable devices, I mean Android phones and stuff like that, they don't play the iPod stuff.

629
00:45:46,929 --> 00:45:47,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

630
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:49,490
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so glad we do this show in the house.

631
00:45:50,111 --> 00:45:50,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Tron Legacy.

632
00:45:51,411 --> 00:45:53,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Digital copy of feature film.

633
00:45:53,513 --> 00:45:56,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Watch it anytime, anywhere on your computer and portable device.

634
00:45:56,454 --> 00:45:57,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Works with iTunes.

635
00:45:57,395 --> 00:45:58,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Works with Windows Media Player.

636
00:46:01,437 --> 00:46:01,817
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

637
00:46:02,197 --> 00:46:03,298
[SPEAKER_06]: You might be able to convert it somehow.

638
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:09,883
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean, there's a lot of stuff that supports that.

639
00:46:12,865 --> 00:46:13,225
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

640
00:46:13,526 --> 00:46:17,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, Randy said, F at UMDs, it's all about GBA movie player carts.

641
00:46:17,789 --> 00:46:18,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh.

642
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:19,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember those at E3?

643
00:46:20,411 --> 00:46:21,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I do.

644
00:46:21,232 --> 00:46:23,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are still coming, too, for the 3DS, apparently.

645
00:46:24,295 --> 00:46:26,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever happened to 3D movies on the 3DS?

646
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:28,278
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a big thing they showed at E3.

647
00:46:28,438 --> 00:46:29,559
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad you mentioned that.

648
00:46:29,959 --> 00:46:30,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Next week.

649
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:32,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up, really?

650
00:46:32,521 --> 00:46:32,661
Yeah.

651
00:46:33,442 --> 00:46:35,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, there's been like no press about it.

652
00:46:35,324 --> 00:46:36,985
[SPEAKER_05]: What 3DS movies are supposed to come out next week?

653
00:46:37,005 --> 00:46:37,726
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a movie.

654
00:46:37,806 --> 00:46:40,468
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a game, but it has the movie on it.

655
00:46:40,808 --> 00:46:49,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Tekken 3D Prime Edition has the full Tekken animated movie on there in 3D.

656
00:46:51,337 --> 00:46:52,177
[SPEAKER_06]: That's weird.

657
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:53,178
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of cool though.

658
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's just like, and the good one too, not the crappy live action Tekken movie.

659
00:46:59,533 --> 00:47:01,233
[SPEAKER_06]: So that'll be something for next week.

660
00:47:01,854 --> 00:47:02,374
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty cool.

661
00:47:22,455 --> 00:47:24,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

662
00:47:37,123 --> 00:47:40,865
[SPEAKER_06]: 3D is cool in a theater.

663
00:47:41,365 --> 00:47:45,527
[SPEAKER_06]: 3D is cool maybe on my TV, although I don't have a 3D TV, so I can't really speak for that.

664
00:47:46,427 --> 00:47:49,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I've seen our lobby TV is a 3D TV, and that was all right.

665
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:55,692
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't need 3D on the road.

666
00:47:55,832 --> 00:47:57,372
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need to watch the movie in 3D.

667
00:47:57,412 --> 00:47:58,613
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it adds a little bit.

668
00:47:59,113 --> 00:48:02,295
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bit more immersive, but it's not like, oh, my God, night and day.

669
00:48:03,175 --> 00:48:04,696
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm fine without 3D.

670
00:48:06,246 --> 00:48:08,628
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I like a lot of these 3D games.

671
00:48:08,688 --> 00:48:15,073
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's cool that the 3D's in there, like, for the 3DS, but I don't necessarily need it.

672
00:48:15,213 --> 00:48:17,595
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't add, like, a ton of extra gameplay.

673
00:48:17,855 --> 00:48:20,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas, you know, that second analog stick does help quite a bit.

674
00:48:21,138 --> 00:48:21,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

675
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:24,421
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if I were to choose, hey, guess what?

676
00:48:24,461 --> 00:48:27,843
[SPEAKER_06]: We can make a system with a second analog stick or we're going to have 3D graphics.

677
00:48:28,504 --> 00:48:34,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'd rather play with the second analog stick because that would be pretty useful.

678
00:48:36,641 --> 00:48:37,962
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, going to our chat room.

679
00:48:38,222 --> 00:48:42,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Blackwolf says about the Tron digital card.

680
00:48:42,244 --> 00:48:44,104
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, check to see when it expires.

681
00:48:44,144 --> 00:48:45,845
[SPEAKER_05]: They expire after a few months.

682
00:48:46,486 --> 00:48:47,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, great.

683
00:48:47,066 --> 00:48:47,966
[SPEAKER_05]: So I might be screwed.

684
00:48:48,186 --> 00:48:48,867
[SPEAKER_05]: It's usually about a year.

685
00:48:48,887 --> 00:48:50,227
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

686
00:48:50,287 --> 00:48:51,088
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been about a year.

687
00:48:51,108 --> 00:48:51,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

688
00:48:52,448 --> 00:48:55,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Brad from PodCulture says, fuck, just torrent the movies.

689
00:48:56,390 --> 00:49:02,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if I'm not able to get my digital distribution that I bought, or digital copy that I bought fair and square, I just might have to.

690
00:49:03,939 --> 00:49:08,442
[SPEAKER_05]: BlackWolf says, I can't wait for Netflix to have 3D movies so I can actually see them in 3D.

691
00:49:08,462 --> 00:49:10,543
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I wouldn't mind a 3D Netflix.

692
00:49:10,563 --> 00:49:13,686
[SPEAKER_05]: After everything Netflix has gone through this past year, I think a 3D version would be welcomed.

693
00:49:26,974 --> 00:49:28,235
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on with some more news.

694
00:49:28,655 --> 00:49:31,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you heard that Verizon is teaming up with... I did.

695
00:49:32,657 --> 00:49:35,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you also hear that Disney is implementing the rental window?

696
00:49:36,178 --> 00:49:37,199
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw that on your Twitter.

697
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:39,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Explain that quickly before we go on to the next story.

698
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,720
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the rental window, so to speak?

699
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:48,184
[SPEAKER_06]: The rental window is basically that they limit all distributors from selling copies to rental customers.

700
00:49:49,004 --> 00:49:52,886
[SPEAKER_06]: So Blockbuster, Redbox, whomever...

701
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:56,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

702
00:50:17,686 --> 00:50:20,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Aw, sad face, my new Tron movie's not here.

703
00:50:20,487 --> 00:50:23,669
[SPEAKER_06]: I better go buy it brand new instead of, you know, renting it.

704
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:28,531
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they go out, okay, well, maybe not Tron, because Tron you should buy when it comes out.

705
00:50:28,871 --> 00:50:33,853
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, like, okay, aw, they don't have... Mars needs moms.

706
00:50:34,113 --> 00:50:36,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Aw, they don't have, you know, Mars needs moms too.

707
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:37,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Mom harder.

708
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:38,395
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

709
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:47,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Electric Mama Lou So I guess I gotta go buy it brand new so my kid can watch this.

710
00:50:47,941 --> 00:50:52,548
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, the idiots that make these decisions higher up

711
00:50:53,164 --> 00:50:57,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, look, when we did that, look, our sell-through sales have just spiked.

712
00:50:57,986 --> 00:50:59,226
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just going through the roof.

713
00:50:59,466 --> 00:51:04,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because everybody's going to retail, buying copies and bringing it back to the rental store.

714
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:08,950
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yes, that is going to increase the amount of sales you have in your sell-through copies.

715
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:14,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, but you forgot all the other copies that you were selling for rental that aren't there anymore.

716
00:51:14,212 --> 00:51:16,193
[SPEAKER_06]: So it actually evens out or is less.

717
00:51:17,433 --> 00:51:19,376
[SPEAKER_06]: But still, that's the decision that they make.

718
00:51:19,416 --> 00:51:23,681
[SPEAKER_06]: That's also the decision that Warner made a while back and they're now a 60-day rental window, I think.

719
00:51:24,903 --> 00:51:27,286
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's because they hate people that rent movies.

720
00:51:29,201 --> 00:51:33,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Ahamkara in our chatroom says, most of the Nintendo Channel 3D isn't good.

721
00:51:33,324 --> 00:51:35,046
[SPEAKER_05]: You could turn it off and it's no different looking.

722
00:51:35,446 --> 00:51:36,487
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's kind of true.

723
00:51:36,867 --> 00:51:42,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, have you ever, Loki, have you ever watched some of the stuff on the Nintendo Download stuff?

724
00:51:42,251 --> 00:51:42,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

725
00:51:42,552 --> 00:51:47,155
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some really bad sketch comedy and some stuff on there that's just like, oh, this hurts.

726
00:51:47,195 --> 00:51:48,156
[SPEAKER_06]: I watched some animated shorts.

727
00:51:48,216 --> 00:51:53,140
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to have it, it used to automatically download and I was like, stop, stop, I don't want to watch this.

728
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:53,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

729
00:51:55,602 --> 00:51:58,783
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like 50 minutes into the show and we've done one story, so let's move on.

730
00:51:59,383 --> 00:52:02,705
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a big deal because this is two game companies people really love.

731
00:52:03,605 --> 00:52:05,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Me, I love both these companies.

732
00:52:05,846 --> 00:52:09,468
[SPEAKER_05]: And isn't it rough when you see people you love fighting?

733
00:52:09,848 --> 00:52:10,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that hard to watch?

734
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:12,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's what's happening.

735
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:14,450
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a court battle.

736
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:15,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Blizzard.

737
00:52:15,971 --> 00:52:18,453
[SPEAKER_05]: filed a notice of opposition with the U.S.

738
00:52:18,533 --> 00:52:19,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Patent and Trademark Office.

739
00:52:20,234 --> 00:52:25,037
[SPEAKER_05]: What they're trying to do, they're trying to block Valve from using the term DOTA.

740
00:52:25,877 --> 00:52:41,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, for those that don't know, DOTA, Defense of the Ancients, long time ago was a Warcraft 3 mod that was super freaking popular to the extent that it went on to spawn just all these kind of, I don't want to say clone games, but other types of games in that same vein.

741
00:52:42,268 --> 00:52:51,836
[SPEAKER_05]: League of Legends being the huge example of that now what's interesting about Dota is that because it was a Warcraft 3 thing how did it work?

742
00:52:51,916 --> 00:53:06,489
[SPEAKER_05]: there was one guy that started Dota one guy that continued Dota guys I so apologize if I'm fucking this up but it's like a soap opera storyline I think the guy that continued Dota went to go do League of Legends

743
00:53:06,849 --> 00:53:07,189
[SPEAKER_05]: StarCraft 2

744
00:53:33,638 --> 00:53:34,599
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

745
00:53:58,487 --> 00:54:02,209
[SPEAKER_05]: If you really want to kick them where it counts, do it after the game's already in beta testing.

746
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:05,852
[SPEAKER_05]: So from that strategical standpoint, I can see that.

747
00:54:06,353 --> 00:54:20,743
[SPEAKER_05]: But Blizzard's case, quote, By virtue of that use, the Dota mark has been firmly associated in the mind of consumers with Blizzard, including to signify a highly popular scenario or variant of one of Blizzard's best-selling computer games, Warcraft 3.

748
00:54:21,904 --> 00:54:25,827
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of fans are up in arms about this because they're saying, Blizzard, you didn't make the mod.

749
00:54:26,835 --> 00:54:32,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and I honestly never heard of the term until a couple days ago.

750
00:54:33,522 --> 00:54:35,684
[SPEAKER_05]: But you don't really follow these types of games either, to be fair.

751
00:54:36,025 --> 00:54:39,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see... Wait, I'm the lore nerd for Warcraft.

752
00:54:40,009 --> 00:54:41,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on one sec, Matt.

753
00:54:41,751 --> 00:54:43,533
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, in your mind, go back three days.

754
00:54:43,953 --> 00:54:45,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Who did you think owned Dota?

755
00:54:45,875 --> 00:54:46,316
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking...

756
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:51,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, I kind of glanced at it and didn't care.

757
00:54:52,113 --> 00:54:53,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that thought didn't come to your mind.

758
00:54:56,936 --> 00:54:57,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

759
00:54:57,677 --> 00:55:05,903
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw in our chatroom says, Blizzard's version is D-O-T-A with the periods, while Valve went around that by just calling it Dota 2.

760
00:55:07,044 --> 00:55:09,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, apparently that wasn't good enough for Blizzard.

761
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:11,608
[SPEAKER_05]: But Blizzard doesn't own the...

762
00:55:13,783 --> 00:55:18,845
[SPEAKER_05]: It was created for one of their games and I can see the whole association.

763
00:55:19,025 --> 00:55:20,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Legally, I don't know what standing they have.

764
00:55:20,746 --> 00:55:23,066
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I gotta admit, but I'm not a lawyer also.

765
00:55:23,146 --> 00:55:24,367
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just a sick fanboy.

766
00:55:25,147 --> 00:55:31,689
[SPEAKER_09]: The only way legally that Blizzard can stand on it is if they had filed a trademark on it.

767
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Valve's game isn't Dota.

768
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:34,590
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Dota 2.

769
00:55:36,571 --> 00:55:36,831
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean...

770
00:55:39,426 --> 00:55:42,656
[SPEAKER_05]: If I want to have a superb owl party, can I get away with that?

771
00:55:43,058 --> 00:55:44,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Were we talking about this last week?

772
00:55:44,853 --> 00:55:55,861
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, this almost reminds me of Monster Cable suing Monster Minigolf because it has the word monster in it.

773
00:55:56,061 --> 00:56:00,144
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Monster Energy Drinks does the same thing, or they sued Monster Energy Drinks.

774
00:56:00,544 --> 00:56:07,769
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, but just because a mod was used on your game doesn't mean you have the rights to that.

775
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,210
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't work that way.

776
00:56:10,271 --> 00:56:18,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless they use some mod tools that you provided them, I don't see how they have the, you don't have the rights to that.

777
00:56:19,096 --> 00:56:20,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless they gave you the rights.

778
00:56:20,416 --> 00:56:22,977
[SPEAKER_05]: What is this that our pal Bobby Blackwolf is sending me right now?

779
00:56:23,038 --> 00:56:25,879
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, this is the link to the Dota song by Bass Hunter.

780
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:27,820
[SPEAKER_05]: You should play this for shits and giggles.

781
00:56:29,041 --> 00:56:29,541
[SPEAKER_05]: What is this?

782
00:56:31,102 --> 00:56:32,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear your mod.

783
00:56:43,936 --> 00:56:47,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Lawsuits off.

784
00:56:47,719 --> 00:56:49,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Dance party instead.

785
00:56:49,961 --> 00:56:51,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we just dance our problems out?

786
00:56:51,442 --> 00:56:57,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Pants off, pants off.

787
00:57:04,332 --> 00:57:06,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody should sue this guy for being addicting.

788
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:15,626
[SPEAKER_05]: That same fucking melody is in like 50 goddamn songs I've heard come out of various European territories.

789
00:57:19,609 --> 00:57:19,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

790
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:21,651
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm suing them for that melody.

791
00:57:22,953 --> 00:57:23,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn it.

792
00:57:24,489 --> 00:57:27,471
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, save us from dance party.

793
00:57:28,892 --> 00:57:30,513
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to move it, move it.

794
00:57:31,294 --> 00:57:32,534
[SPEAKER_09]: How about some Steam stuff?

795
00:57:33,255 --> 00:57:34,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of Valve.

796
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:34,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

797
00:57:34,996 --> 00:57:37,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know that whole business with the Steam hack?

798
00:57:38,918 --> 00:57:43,041
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like they might have gotten some information for transactions.

799
00:57:43,281 --> 00:57:45,623
[SPEAKER_09]: After all, that happened between 2004 and 2008.

800
00:57:45,663 --> 00:57:46,003
[SPEAKER_09]: So no one care.

801
00:57:48,271 --> 00:57:50,314
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

802
00:58:08,075 --> 00:58:09,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Change your passwords anyway.

803
00:58:10,879 --> 00:58:16,526
[SPEAKER_09]: And to be perfectly honest, he suggests using Steam Guard.

804
00:58:17,027 --> 00:58:17,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep it on.

805
00:58:18,349 --> 00:58:21,153
[SPEAKER_09]: And my suggestion is don't put your fucking credit card on Steam.

806
00:58:22,274 --> 00:58:23,556
[SPEAKER_09]: I use PayPal for a reason.

807
00:58:23,916 --> 00:58:24,197
[SPEAKER_09]: The end.

808
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:27,156
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

809
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:42,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's true.

810
00:58:42,771 --> 00:58:47,616
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if they got information from 2008, whatever credit card I was using then, long since expired.

811
00:58:47,636 --> 00:58:54,163
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as they can't see what porn I bought on other websites between that time.

812
00:58:54,443 --> 00:58:56,505
[SPEAKER_09]: It never hurts to be careful, but don't panic.

813
00:58:57,306 --> 00:58:57,786
[SPEAKER_09]: In other words.

814
00:58:58,507 --> 00:59:00,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I like, though, that they're being very upfront about it.

815
00:59:00,908 --> 00:59:04,110
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the whole situation really sucks.

816
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:08,732
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I've come to learn that the hacking is one thing.

817
00:59:09,592 --> 00:59:17,476
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, PlayStation got hacked and Sony PlayStation got hacked and then Valve got hacked and, you know, other websites.

818
00:59:17,856 --> 00:59:22,518
[SPEAKER_05]: But then the information actually being misused to steal money is another thing.

819
00:59:23,098 --> 00:59:26,679
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's Xbox which totally denies that there has been a hacking of any sort.

820
00:59:27,159 --> 00:59:32,261
[SPEAKER_05]: So when choosing between this or this I'd rather go with well the information was hacked.

821
00:59:34,102 --> 00:59:36,122
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that sounds really weird but think about it.

822
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:39,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Also use a different password on every website.

823
00:59:39,303 --> 00:59:40,904
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really the best practice.

824
00:59:41,104 --> 00:59:42,665
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to use a different password on every website.

825
00:59:42,845 --> 00:59:43,045
[SPEAKER_05]: You do.

826
00:59:44,585 --> 00:59:46,386
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the only way to keep your information.

827
00:59:46,646 --> 00:59:49,867
[SPEAKER_05]: For the love of God, your bank account password better be unique.

828
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:52,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Please tell me your bank account password is unique.

829
00:59:52,268 --> 00:59:54,869
[SPEAKER_05]: And really, your email password should be unique too.

830
00:59:55,229 --> 00:59:59,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Because to reset your password on any other website, it usually goes back to your email address.

831
00:59:59,511 --> 01:00:05,333
[SPEAKER_05]: So if anything is going to have unique passwords, your banking and your email needs to have unique passwords.

832
01:00:05,713 --> 01:00:05,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

833
01:00:06,653 --> 01:00:08,294
[SPEAKER_09]: And don't have any of your passwords saved.

834
01:00:08,974 --> 01:00:11,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and don't name passwords after your kitty.

835
01:00:11,616 --> 01:00:15,740
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't be like, who was it, the president of Syria or whatever that had their password 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

836
01:00:16,561 --> 01:00:18,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, that's the same.

837
01:00:19,103 --> 01:00:20,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Multiple people have that.

838
01:00:21,425 --> 01:00:22,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Please don't do that.

839
01:00:23,066 --> 01:00:25,008
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the password an idiot would put on his luggage.

840
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:27,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, moving on.

841
01:00:28,171 --> 01:00:28,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

842
01:00:29,331 --> 01:00:35,196
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, there's a big Kickstarter project featuring Double Fine.

843
01:00:35,476 --> 01:00:47,364
[SPEAKER_06]: They decided to go ahead and put this project on Kickstarter to raise money for a classic point-and-click adventure game using modern technology, or modern touch technology.

844
01:00:48,305 --> 01:00:48,865
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um,

845
01:00:51,082 --> 01:00:52,602
[SPEAKER_06]: It's broken all sorts of records.

846
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:58,144
[SPEAKER_06]: They made their $400,000 in less than 24 hours.

847
01:00:58,324 --> 01:01:01,644
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the original amount that they were looking to raise.

848
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:08,446
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's already well over a million dollars, I believe $1.6 million as of today.

849
01:01:09,266 --> 01:01:12,787
[SPEAKER_06]: And they've still got like 30 days to go on this project.

850
01:01:14,318 --> 01:01:14,979
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just ridiculous.

851
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:17,803
[SPEAKER_06]: It broke records on Kickstarter.

852
01:01:18,544 --> 01:01:22,228
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, they're making quite a bit of money off that 5% cut they get.

853
01:01:23,109 --> 01:01:23,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of nice.

854
01:01:24,131 --> 01:01:24,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Kickstarter gets 5%?

855
01:01:25,613 --> 01:01:25,853
[SPEAKER_06]: They get 5%.

856
01:01:26,534 --> 01:01:27,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh.

857
01:01:27,775 --> 01:01:29,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, they got to run their company.

858
01:01:29,838 --> 01:01:36,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know, but I'm just like, do people know that 5% of their money goes to... I guess they have to when they click accept, whether they read it or not.

859
01:01:39,783 --> 01:01:41,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and so obviously this game will be made.

860
01:01:42,245 --> 01:01:53,751
[SPEAKER_05]: There's lots of... Sorry, I'm laughing because now I'm thinking about that report I saw on CNN where the people at Kickstarter were watching this Double Fine thing happening on the televisions and they were like all around...

861
01:01:54,031 --> 01:01:57,034
[SPEAKER_05]: and they busted out champagne when it passed the million dollar mark.

862
01:01:57,074 --> 01:01:59,137
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, oh, now I get why.

863
01:01:59,157 --> 01:02:02,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they just made $200,000 in one fucking day.

864
01:02:04,082 --> 01:02:04,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Or excuse me, $20,000.

865
01:02:04,723 --> 01:02:05,824
[SPEAKER_05]: That's still really good.

866
01:02:06,384 --> 01:02:08,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they've got 29 days to go.

867
01:02:08,326 --> 01:02:12,110
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, you can still, if you want to pledge money for this, and there's no reason.

868
01:02:13,111 --> 01:02:14,052
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't fucking do math. $50,000.

869
01:02:15,416 --> 01:02:20,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's, you know, you can still pledge money if you want to.

870
01:02:21,139 --> 01:02:24,140
[SPEAKER_06]: And they've got, you know, all the upper tier stuff sold out.

871
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:27,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone actually pledged $10,000 or more to this.

872
01:02:27,802 --> 01:02:28,922
[SPEAKER_06]: There's 10 people that pledged $5,000.

873
01:02:29,282 --> 01:02:30,703
[SPEAKER_06]: 100 that pledged over $1,000.

874
01:02:30,763 --> 01:02:31,963
[SPEAKER_06]: 900 that pledged over $250.

875
01:02:35,805 --> 01:02:36,525
[SPEAKER_06]: This is ridiculous.

876
01:02:36,606 --> 01:02:38,467
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's still the bottom tier stuff.

877
01:02:38,487 --> 01:02:46,872
[SPEAKER_06]: If you pledge $15, you get a copy of the game and access to the beta on Steam as well as access to the video series and private discussion community.

878
01:02:47,752 --> 01:02:54,597
[SPEAKER_06]: $30 or more, you get HD download of the documentary series with extras, digital game soundtrack, and all the other stuff before that.

879
01:02:55,397 --> 01:03:04,963
[SPEAKER_06]: And then $100, you get the original Double Fine Adventure poster, an exclusive campaign, special thanks in the game's credits, and all the previous stuff.

880
01:03:06,894 --> 01:03:12,199
[SPEAKER_06]: So you should... Well, check out Kickstarter, period, because they've got a lot of neat stuff on there.

881
01:03:12,519 --> 01:03:17,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Not necessarily just video game stuff, but, like, they had it one time, and I almost considered doing it.

882
01:03:17,724 --> 01:03:25,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you could buy a set of Catan tiles that were, like, laser etched on wood, and they looked nice.

883
01:03:25,371 --> 01:03:25,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

884
01:03:25,531 --> 01:03:27,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Except they're really fucking expensive.

885
01:03:27,754 --> 01:03:28,054
[SPEAKER_06]: But, uh...

886
01:03:29,255 --> 01:03:35,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my favorite one, which I've got a... I can't remember.

887
01:03:35,404 --> 01:03:38,468
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a card game that's just very inappropriate.

888
01:03:38,849 --> 01:03:39,109
[SPEAKER_06]: That's...

889
01:03:41,822 --> 01:03:42,522
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember now.

890
01:03:43,022 --> 01:03:46,163
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura in our chatroom says, last I heard they were almost going to break $2 million.

891
01:03:46,183 --> 01:03:48,524
[SPEAKER_05]: $1.6 million when I looked earlier is where they're at now.

892
01:03:48,704 --> 01:03:49,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

893
01:03:49,724 --> 01:03:51,305
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a fair chunk of money.

894
01:03:52,185 --> 01:03:54,986
[SPEAKER_05]: This just in, by the way, Orange Lounge Radio is starting a Kickstarter.

895
01:03:55,326 --> 01:03:58,927
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to save the afterbirth segment, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

896
01:04:00,608 --> 01:04:03,529
[SPEAKER_05]: But seriously, now I'm like, what could we give away?

897
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:09,011
[SPEAKER_06]: We could honestly do that.

898
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:12,414
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we're not in it for the money.

899
01:04:12,574 --> 01:04:14,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, guys, we're not in it for the money.

900
01:04:14,075 --> 01:04:17,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Cards Against Humanity is the thing that was a Kickstarter project.

901
01:04:18,018 --> 01:04:20,540
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically this card game that's really bad.

902
01:04:22,281 --> 01:04:24,423
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not appropriate for most ages.

903
01:04:28,106 --> 01:04:30,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you donate to this, or did you think about donating to this?

904
01:04:30,587 --> 01:04:30,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

905
01:04:32,109 --> 01:04:33,289
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't either, but...

906
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:39,597
[SPEAKER_05]: We were talking about this with Bobby on his show earlier before we started tonight and he did and so we were kind of talking about this a little bit.

907
01:04:39,638 --> 01:04:48,289
[SPEAKER_06]: The last thing I donated money for was that Humble Bundle and I've played one of the games out of that.

908
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:51,554
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to buy another digital game that I'm not going to fucking play.

909
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:53,756
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, so... No, wait.

910
01:04:54,117 --> 01:04:56,099
[SPEAKER_05]: I do play the games in the Humble Indie Bundle.

911
01:04:56,299 --> 01:04:56,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

912
01:04:56,479 --> 01:04:57,140
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a great deal.

913
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,402
[SPEAKER_06]: But I've played only one of them.

914
01:04:58,442 --> 01:05:00,004
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have all the other, like, ten games.

915
01:05:00,024 --> 01:05:01,385
[SPEAKER_05]: But you did good for charity.

916
01:05:01,485 --> 01:05:02,767
[SPEAKER_05]: This has nothing to do with charity.

917
01:05:02,787 --> 01:05:03,468
[SPEAKER_05]: This Double Fine thing?

918
01:05:03,488 --> 01:05:04,028
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand that.

919
01:05:04,088 --> 01:05:05,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing to do with charity.

920
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:05,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember that.

921
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:06,691
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that.

922
01:05:06,892 --> 01:05:06,992
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

923
01:05:08,502 --> 01:05:36,807
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's the other thing too it's raised money faster than Child's Play did think about it Child's Play did not raise a million dollars in it well I take that back they may have at some point but over the course of three months they raised three million which is great if Child's Play then comes up with some cool perks you know to give away and I know the guys behind Penny Arcade probably could come up with some cool perks and then put a Kickstarter page up I'm sure they can get quite a bit of attention and get money raised that way um

924
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:39,267
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's a cool idea.

925
01:05:39,347 --> 01:05:40,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Crowdsourcing is kind of neat.

926
01:05:41,448 --> 01:05:44,269
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can think of some ways we could utilize that.

927
01:05:44,329 --> 01:05:48,390
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's just, I don't know.

928
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:51,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, they had another game.

929
01:05:51,131 --> 01:05:51,891
[SPEAKER_06]: There was another one.

930
01:05:51,971 --> 01:05:57,513
[SPEAKER_06]: It was by the guys that did, I want to say, the Tony Hawk game or something like that.

931
01:05:57,753 --> 01:05:59,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, one of the Tony Hawk games or something.

932
01:06:00,554 --> 01:06:12,800
[SPEAKER_06]: and they were raising money for this really terrible looking Kinect Xbox Live Arcade game where you bounce your characters around like some stupid pachinko looking machine and it was just terrible.

933
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,140
[SPEAKER_06]: But I love pachinko.

934
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,241
[SPEAKER_06]: But they were raising money for that.

935
01:06:16,801 --> 01:06:18,022
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're going to raise money

936
01:06:18,562 --> 01:06:19,042
[SPEAKER_06]: for this.

937
01:06:19,082 --> 01:06:22,504
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you're going to put it on Xbox Live Arcade and make more money.

938
01:06:22,925 --> 01:06:26,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you're not investing really any of your money because you're making all the money.

939
01:06:27,587 --> 01:06:28,168
[SPEAKER_06]: It must be nice.

940
01:06:28,228 --> 01:06:33,471
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, hell, if I was motivated enough to program games and stuff and I could make a convincing Kickstarter, that would be cool.

941
01:06:33,711 --> 01:06:35,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, look, I got all my seed money and now I'm going to make some money.

942
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:41,836
[SPEAKER_06]: And all I have to do is provide some people some free codes or some extra tchotchkes and that's it.

943
01:06:42,096 --> 01:06:43,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's my honest concern.

944
01:06:43,797 --> 01:06:45,758
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this is a legitimate concern to have.

945
01:06:46,538 --> 01:06:47,459
[SPEAKER_05]: What if the game's bad?

946
01:06:48,809 --> 01:06:55,733
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I realize the whole community is going to be participating and talking about this on the forums and watching the development.

947
01:06:55,773 --> 01:06:56,894
[SPEAKER_05]: And that part's really cool.

948
01:06:57,034 --> 01:07:02,637
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to give props to somebody that's willing to lift the curtain a little bit there and show you what's back there.

949
01:07:03,318 --> 01:07:09,361
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm also a little bit like sometimes community isn't always right in their decisions.

950
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:12,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes the hardcore gamers alienate the casual gamers.

951
01:07:12,203 --> 01:07:14,765
[SPEAKER_05]: And I talked about World of Warcraft did that a little bit.

952
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:17,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's the same with like a pre-order, though.

953
01:07:17,928 --> 01:07:21,010
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you put money down for a pre-order and you get the game and it could suck.

954
01:07:22,151 --> 01:07:23,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Thing again, I'm not putting $100 down for a game.

955
01:07:26,198 --> 01:07:30,361
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I can see putting the $15 down, which is basically a game purchase.

956
01:07:30,481 --> 01:07:36,606
[SPEAKER_06]: And don't get me wrong, this day and age, though, $15 for a digital game is kind of expensive.

957
01:07:36,807 --> 01:07:38,408
[SPEAKER_06]: So it better be pretty good.

958
01:07:38,948 --> 01:07:39,709
[SPEAKER_05]: I beg to differ.

959
01:07:39,729 --> 01:07:40,289
[SPEAKER_05]: That's average.

960
01:07:40,529 --> 01:07:44,112
[SPEAKER_05]: For a PlayStation or Xbox game, most of them these days are 1,200 points.

961
01:07:44,152 --> 01:07:44,292
[SPEAKER_05]: That's $15.

962
01:07:44,353 --> 01:07:45,774
[SPEAKER_05]: I beg to differ.

963
01:07:47,155 --> 01:07:49,717
[SPEAKER_05]: We like them when they're 800 points, but let's be real.

964
01:07:49,777 --> 01:07:53,620
[SPEAKER_05]: There has not been a 400 points game in, like, four years.

965
01:07:58,369 --> 01:08:01,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you're talking indie games, because I think indie games can go as high as 400 points.

966
01:08:01,671 --> 01:08:03,772
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see.

967
01:08:04,153 --> 01:08:04,893
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

968
01:08:08,015 --> 01:08:10,336
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't see myself buying this game.

969
01:08:11,277 --> 01:08:20,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'll buy it if the folks that are watching it say, gosh, this is looking great, or it's a great game, or when it actually comes out, it gets great reviews, just like any other game.

970
01:08:21,502 --> 01:08:22,463
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're part of the problem then.

971
01:08:41,815 --> 01:08:42,656
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm serious.

972
01:08:42,676 --> 01:08:43,756
[SPEAKER_06]: You're part of the problem then.

973
01:08:45,477 --> 01:08:48,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Konami says, we'll support Rhythm Fever.

974
01:08:48,639 --> 01:08:49,179
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

975
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,461
[SPEAKER_06]: If they came out and said that shit, I'd say, fuck you.

976
01:08:53,042 --> 01:08:53,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you.

977
01:08:54,162 --> 01:08:54,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you.

978
01:08:55,063 --> 01:08:58,345
[SPEAKER_06]: I am not paying you a dime for a fucking game.

979
01:08:58,705 --> 01:09:01,887
[SPEAKER_06]: You make the game, and then I'll buy it if it's good.

980
01:09:02,087 --> 01:09:08,831
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to be like, oh, I'm not going to make games until people pay me money first.

981
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:10,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that must be nice.

982
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:12,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami did that.

983
01:09:12,891 --> 01:09:16,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, it was Beatmania 2DX 7th style.

984
01:09:16,393 --> 01:09:20,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, they said they were not going to do it until 10,000 people pre-ordered the game.

985
01:09:20,834 --> 01:09:23,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and they're fucking assholes.

986
01:09:23,815 --> 01:09:25,096
[SPEAKER_06]: See what that karma did?

987
01:09:25,376 --> 01:09:28,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, where's your fucking Beatmania DDR series now?

988
01:09:29,297 --> 01:09:29,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right.

989
01:09:29,857 --> 01:09:31,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Where is your god of music now?

990
01:09:32,658 --> 01:09:35,720
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in the shitter because you fucking sucked it.

991
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:36,740
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like...

992
01:09:38,779 --> 01:09:46,061
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what the cherry on the top for that caramel pie was?

993
01:09:46,401 --> 01:09:48,281
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a fucking rock revolution.

994
01:09:49,422 --> 01:09:55,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Rock revolution was just like, I'm going to take a dump on this disc right here.

995
01:09:57,103 --> 01:09:57,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Here you go.

996
01:09:58,404 --> 01:09:59,164
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, though?

997
01:09:59,644 --> 01:10:02,865
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to ask the question, when did Bomani die?

998
01:10:04,651 --> 01:10:05,892
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be the best answer.

999
01:10:06,212 --> 01:10:10,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, thank God, Bomani's seemingly making a comeback.

1000
01:10:10,035 --> 01:10:11,276
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a couple new arcade games.

1001
01:10:11,797 --> 01:10:15,380
[SPEAKER_05]: I still say, I don't give two shits what you say, Loki.

1002
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:19,203
[SPEAKER_05]: That Rhythm Fever game is actually a lot of fun on Kinect.

1003
01:10:19,243 --> 01:10:20,143
[SPEAKER_06]: No, don't get me wrong.

1004
01:10:20,204 --> 01:10:21,284
[SPEAKER_06]: They're on the path.

1005
01:10:21,745 --> 01:10:22,746
[SPEAKER_06]: They're on the right path.

1006
01:10:22,926 --> 01:10:25,067
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's just, it still weighs away.

1007
01:10:25,208 --> 01:10:25,788
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sorry.

1008
01:10:26,849 --> 01:10:29,471
[SPEAKER_06]: They just take a lot of missteps.

1009
01:10:30,592 --> 01:10:31,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark, gray, nope.

1010
01:10:33,305 --> 01:10:35,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Flowing down the screen against a black background.

1011
01:10:35,446 --> 01:10:36,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Not the smartest thing to do.

1012
01:10:37,006 --> 01:10:41,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to the chat room because Bobby Blackwolf loves to correct me.

1013
01:10:41,687 --> 01:10:42,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Loves to correct me.

1014
01:10:43,908 --> 01:10:47,329
[SPEAKER_05]: And says there is a 400 space bucks arcade game a few weeks ago.

1015
01:10:47,649 --> 01:10:49,830
[SPEAKER_05]: The Scrabble plus Risk combo.

1016
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:50,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Quarrel.

1017
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:51,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember Quarrel?

1018
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:53,291
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't realize it was 400 points.

1019
01:10:53,571 --> 01:10:54,851
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard a lot of good things about that game.

1020
01:10:54,971 --> 01:10:55,751
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I might get it.

1021
01:10:56,332 --> 01:10:57,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Scrabble plus Risk, DarkSakura.

1022
01:10:57,752 --> 01:10:58,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't that sound pretty cool?

1023
01:10:59,292 --> 01:10:59,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds interesting.

1024
01:11:01,193 --> 01:11:01,433
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1025
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:03,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

1026
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:05,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk Mass Effect.

1027
01:11:06,081 --> 01:11:08,021
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of you kids really love Mass Effect.

1028
01:11:08,062 --> 01:11:10,582
[SPEAKER_05]: And boy, Mass Effect's just going to keep on giving.

1029
01:11:11,683 --> 01:11:13,663
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, BioWare has all these studios now.

1030
01:11:13,723 --> 01:11:17,804
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, hell, Sacramento has one where we're at, even as a BioWare studio.

1031
01:11:18,165 --> 01:11:23,186
[SPEAKER_05]: So when there's a big BioWare event, man, they can get all these properties out everywhere.

1032
01:11:23,206 --> 01:11:25,247
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what's happening with Mass Effect 3.

1033
01:11:26,667 --> 01:11:28,888
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a Mass Effect 3 tie-in

1034
01:11:29,608 --> 01:11:34,389
[SPEAKER_05]: It will take a picture of something or other on the screen and do something.

1035
01:11:34,529 --> 01:11:36,990
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty much I think what it's going to do.

1036
01:11:54,295 --> 01:11:55,216
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1037
01:12:09,511 --> 01:12:10,392
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1038
01:12:28,749 --> 01:12:55,722
[SPEAKER_05]: you get awards for collecting evidence of the crimes that happen that you catch in the mission and I guess it increases your Mass Effect 3 Galaxy at War galactic readiness rating so I guess things that you do in Infiltrator can actually affect what happens in Mass Effect 3 so that's kind of neat that they'll work together like that I imagine you kind of tie all your accounts together through the EA website and it'll work so that's kind of cool

1039
01:12:55,950 --> 01:12:57,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Ty, your account's all together through the EA website.

1040
01:12:58,271 --> 01:13:01,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Get FIFA download packs that you didn't ask for.

1041
01:13:01,772 --> 01:13:03,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, damn it.

1042
01:13:05,893 --> 01:13:07,893
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's interesting.

1043
01:13:07,993 --> 01:13:15,595
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm not super huge into Mass Effect, but I know people that are, and I can't deny that Mass Effect's a huge franchise that a lot of people are really excited about.

1044
01:13:15,655 --> 01:13:20,837
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I gotta admit, there are certain games where if they had the iPad app, I'd be like, that's pretty awesome.

1045
01:13:22,117 --> 01:13:25,079
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it enhances the experience and isn't just a cheap cash-in.

1046
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:31,062
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to pretend if they had a SAP for a Grand Theft Auto game or something like that, I might have to pick it up.

1047
01:13:31,162 --> 01:13:33,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Or like an iPad Saints Row the 3rd somehow.

1048
01:13:33,643 --> 01:13:36,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you could control your missiles on the iPad.

1049
01:13:36,925 --> 01:13:38,326
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that wouldn't be worth it.

1050
01:13:38,346 --> 01:13:38,986
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't think so?

1051
01:13:40,887 --> 01:13:44,109
[SPEAKER_06]: The UAV got boring pretty fast.

1052
01:13:45,089 --> 01:13:47,871
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just much faster to use the other weapons.

1053
01:13:48,331 --> 01:13:48,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1054
01:13:49,473 --> 01:13:52,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Release dates coming up right after one more story from DarkSakura.

1055
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:55,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, how about the Xbox

1056
01:13:59,232 --> 01:14:01,653
[SPEAKER_05]: The Xbox... I've never played an Xbox.

1057
01:14:01,973 --> 01:14:02,433
[SPEAKER_06]: The Lube?

1058
01:14:03,074 --> 01:14:03,714
[SPEAKER_09]: The XU.

1059
01:14:04,794 --> 01:14:05,615
[SPEAKER_05]: The XU?

1060
01:14:05,855 --> 01:14:06,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Explain yourself, woman.

1061
01:14:06,755 --> 01:14:08,396
[SPEAKER_09]: How about an Xbox tablet instead?

1062
01:14:09,716 --> 01:14:18,400
[SPEAKER_09]: In Xbox World for April 2012, there was an announcement for a new Xbox at E3 that has a tablet.

1063
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:20,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, my thought is that this is the April issue.

1064
01:14:20,981 --> 01:14:21,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

1065
01:14:22,662 --> 01:14:23,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

1066
01:14:24,235 --> 01:14:26,316
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little early for the April issue, I think.

1067
01:14:27,017 --> 01:14:29,879
[SPEAKER_09]: It says scans of Xbox World for April 2012.

1068
01:14:30,619 --> 01:14:37,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, no, because April ones are on the newsstand in March, and we're getting towards the end of February.

1069
01:14:38,584 --> 01:14:39,945
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting towards the end of February?

1070
01:14:40,085 --> 01:14:40,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

1071
01:14:40,486 --> 01:14:42,247
[SPEAKER_09]: And this could be someone working for the publisher.

1072
01:14:42,507 --> 01:14:42,807
[SPEAKER_09]: It could.

1073
01:14:43,379 --> 01:14:44,760
[SPEAKER_06]: We're approaching the end.

1074
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:47,722
[SPEAKER_06]: It's way over there, but we're on our way.

1075
01:14:47,862 --> 01:14:48,683
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, shut up.

1076
01:14:48,743 --> 01:14:54,487
[SPEAKER_09]: If I may, this may also be someone who happens to be with a publisher or something.

1077
01:14:54,587 --> 01:14:54,928
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1078
01:14:55,308 --> 01:14:56,149
[SPEAKER_09]: It says April 2012.

1079
01:14:56,709 --> 01:14:57,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh?

1080
01:14:57,470 --> 01:14:57,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh?

1081
01:14:58,270 --> 01:15:00,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but that's when Xbox World is, okay?

1082
01:15:01,673 --> 01:15:01,913
Fine.

1083
01:15:04,403 --> 01:15:17,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it says that there is a matte black media hub that is going to have a tablet and that it's going to be... I'm trying to see where... They're anticipating 399 pounds.

1084
01:15:17,667 --> 01:15:19,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, this is British, of course.

1085
01:15:21,768 --> 01:15:29,971
[SPEAKER_09]: But they said that it works as a remote control with your TV, as a browser when you're on the internet, has extra buttons for playing a game, or a portable display when you want to take your game with you.

1086
01:15:29,991 --> 01:15:32,151
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, $600 roughly.

1087
01:15:34,873 --> 01:15:35,353
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a rumor.

1088
01:15:36,114 --> 01:15:37,555
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking it's a troll.

1089
01:15:38,596 --> 01:15:44,522
[SPEAKER_05]: It better be a troll because I'm looking at that picture and it shows just a tablet with no tangible buttons.

1090
01:15:45,002 --> 01:15:48,205
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I see that and see Xbox wants to use this as a controller, I'm like, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9.

1091
01:15:49,126 --> 01:15:51,668
[SPEAKER_05]: You need tangible controls.

1092
01:15:51,748 --> 01:15:52,689
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

1093
01:15:52,789 --> 01:15:58,915
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what it sounds like to me is that it's a little bit of an expansion on what they had already talked about with...

1094
01:15:59,575 --> 01:16:28,023
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you can do this with Windows phones where basically you can browse your I don't even know what the fuck they call it well a dashboard you can browse around there using your Windows phone and you can queue up stuff like that maybe that they add that to a tablet that's running like the Windows phone OS or whatever or hope to god that they update it to like Android or something and then they can you know have some buttons on there so that you can play like different Xbox Live arcade games or something like that on there

1095
01:16:28,402 --> 01:16:29,243
[SPEAKER_09]: I could see an app.

1096
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:30,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

1097
01:16:30,965 --> 01:16:37,114
[SPEAKER_05]: But isn't it funny that this story comes up right after we were talking about Mass Effect and how it's kind of tying into tablets?

1098
01:16:37,514 --> 01:16:39,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the other funny thing, too.

1099
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:40,358
[SPEAKER_05]: A precursor of things to come?

1100
01:16:40,698 --> 01:16:45,625
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to find it, but there was also the same rumor for the PlayStation 3 that they were...

1101
01:16:45,965 --> 01:16:49,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh wait, no, we talked about it last week, where they were going to come up with a tablet, remember?

1102
01:16:49,287 --> 01:16:52,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, the whole, it had been patented or something like that, right?

1103
01:16:52,649 --> 01:16:52,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1104
01:16:53,290 --> 01:16:56,011
[SPEAKER_05]: The patent doesn't always mean reality.

1105
01:16:56,131 --> 01:17:09,780
[SPEAKER_05]: My response to that is, you already have some of that with the PSP can tie into the PS3 a little bit, and plus the whole, god, they were showing it at E3, the whole Vita and that dungeon crawler game, hasn't it changed its name like three times now?

1106
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:14,923
[SPEAKER_05]: The Dungeon Crawler game that's on the Vita that, you know, you can pause your game and then pick it up on the PS3 and all that stuff.

1107
01:17:14,943 --> 01:17:16,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Dungeon Hunters Alliance, I think?

1108
01:17:16,664 --> 01:17:18,245
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what the hell they're calling it now.

1109
01:17:20,546 --> 01:17:21,246
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah.

1110
01:17:22,967 --> 01:17:29,811
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, theoretically, you can already have that technology if you really want to use it, but it's expensive because that means you have to own a $249 Vita and a $299 PlayStation 3, so...

1111
01:17:36,298 --> 01:17:40,459
[SPEAKER_05]: $299!

1112
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:40,459
[SPEAKER_05]: $299!

1113
01:17:36,458 --> 01:17:40,459
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a lot cheaper than it used to be.

1114
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:43,380
[SPEAKER_05]: It is, but that's where it's at now.

1115
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:45,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Blu-ray players are cheap too.

1116
01:17:45,981 --> 01:17:46,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Came down with that technology.

1117
01:17:46,941 --> 01:17:47,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on.

1118
01:17:47,881 --> 01:17:57,564
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to travel around the world and talk about release dates and see what's coming out to a GameStop or a Best Buy or Walmart or whatever you like to shop Amazon near you.

1119
01:17:59,345 --> 01:18:04,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, earlier this week the Nintendo 3DS Pearl Pink came out.

1120
01:18:05,573 --> 01:18:07,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Rhythm Heaven Fever

1121
01:18:25,385 --> 01:18:26,506
[SPEAKER_06]: on the Nintendo Wii.

1122
01:18:27,966 --> 01:18:28,947
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's only $29.99.

1123
01:18:30,107 --> 01:18:31,248
[SPEAKER_05]: They did a big push for that.

1124
01:18:31,488 --> 01:18:34,089
[SPEAKER_05]: There was like a whole launch event in LA and all this stuff.

1125
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:36,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I fucking hate Rhythm Heaven.

1126
01:18:36,811 --> 01:18:37,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

1127
01:18:37,211 --> 01:18:38,832
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a frustrating fucking game.

1128
01:18:39,192 --> 01:18:41,153
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks interesting, but... It's not very fun.

1129
01:18:41,713 --> 01:18:42,734
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of over the Wii.

1130
01:18:42,934 --> 01:18:45,395
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii's just kind of sitting sad in the corner.

1131
01:18:46,336 --> 01:18:49,137
[SPEAKER_06]: B-Units build it for Nintendo DS.

1132
01:18:50,498 --> 01:18:50,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1133
01:18:52,541 --> 01:18:55,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Hakuoki, Demon of the Fleeting Blossom

1134
01:18:58,885 --> 01:19:00,266
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that's a visual novel game.

1135
01:19:00,966 --> 01:19:19,814

1141
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:45,425

[SPEAKER_05]: That Final Fantasy music game that's on the 3DS.

01:24:46,175 --> 01:24:47,375
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a terrible looking game.

1206
01:24:50,956 --> 01:24:53,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Frisbee in our chatroom says, Tidagachi.

1207
01:24:54,217 --> 01:24:55,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Tidagachi.

1208
01:24:56,298 --> 01:24:57,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, what were you going to derail me with, Loki?

1209
01:24:57,998 --> 01:25:05,560
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say that it would be cool if they came up with some sort of tower defense game with all those internet memes thrown in there.

1210
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Like an internet meme tower defense game.

1211
01:25:08,530 --> 01:25:09,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Who owns the right?

1212
01:25:09,832 --> 01:25:13,136
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we were talking about copyright earlier with Dota and this community-made stuff.

1213
01:25:13,436 --> 01:25:16,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Who technically owns the rights to Forever Alone?

1214
01:25:16,460 --> 01:25:17,000
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1215
01:25:17,281 --> 01:25:18,182
[SPEAKER_05]: And Rage Comics.

1216
01:25:18,282 --> 01:25:21,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Nancat Adventure came out in indie games this week.

1217
01:25:22,327 --> 01:25:22,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

[SPEAKER_09]: On the 16th is Alan Wake for the PC.

[SPEAKER_09]: And the 17th is UFC Undisputed 3.

1223
01:26:00,312 --> 01:26:00,912
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really it.

1224
01:26:03,414 --> 01:26:08,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Asuka in our chatroom asks, Do the Tidagotchis leave digipoop on the screen too?

1225
01:26:10,279 --> 01:26:11,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that on the old Tamagotchis?

1226
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:14,101
[SPEAKER_05]: You used to have to push the button to scoop their poop?

1227
01:26:14,321 --> 01:26:14,982
[SPEAKER_09]: My Devimon.

1228
01:26:16,351 --> 01:26:21,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Not my Devimon, my... Yeah, it was a... Because I had the Digimon ones, remember?

1229
01:26:22,193 --> 01:26:23,114
[SPEAKER_09]: The original Digimon.

1230
01:26:24,294 --> 01:26:26,615
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a direct release from the Tamagotchi.

1231
01:26:27,556 --> 01:26:29,957
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, some guys might be into that in 3D and all.

1232
01:26:30,557 --> 01:26:31,057
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know.

1233
01:26:31,077 --> 01:26:32,437
[SPEAKER_09]: My Devimon was a big shitter.

1234
01:26:34,959 --> 01:26:38,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week, Loki.

1235
01:26:39,187 --> 01:26:44,013
[SPEAKER_06]: So the PS3 did get another firmware update this week and it speeds up web browsing.

1236
01:26:45,195 --> 01:26:55,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently according to the notes for the 4.1 update, also they changed your account from the PlayStation Network account to the Sony Entertainment Network account.

1237
01:26:56,209 --> 01:27:09,163
[SPEAKER_06]: and other things, improved display speed for the browser and I believe they also added Dropbox support so you can use that for storing images online.

1238
01:27:09,784 --> 01:27:10,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh, I didn't realize that.

1239
01:27:11,425 --> 01:27:12,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's pretty cool.

1240
01:27:13,828 --> 01:27:14,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Some other cool stuff.

1241
01:27:14,849 --> 01:27:19,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, there was this whole PlayMemories thing that they were teasing a little bit ago.

1242
01:27:19,633 --> 01:27:26,518
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a video editing app that's going to be part of the PlayStation 3 as well as a PC and mobile suite.

1243
01:27:27,799 --> 01:27:35,166
[SPEAKER_06]: And they've included 5 gigabytes of storage as well that's going to be on a cloud-based service.

1244
01:27:36,467 --> 01:27:36,627
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

1245
01:27:38,288 --> 01:27:45,870
[SPEAKER_06]: It does work with iOS and Android devices and apparently you'll be able to edit images and videos and stuff like that.

1246
01:27:46,951 --> 01:27:51,552
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't imagine though image editing on the PS3 would be very easy.

1247
01:27:51,572 --> 01:27:55,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, just the controller or whatever mouse.

1248
01:27:57,574 --> 01:27:57,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1249
01:27:59,015 --> 01:28:05,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Real quickly, speaking of Sony things, one of the big things that people are looking forward to on the PlayStation Vita or the PlayStation 3

1250
01:28:07,202 --> 01:28:09,144
[SPEAKER_05]: The Final Fantasy X re-release.

1251
01:28:23,777 --> 01:28:24,738
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1252
01:28:39,017 --> 01:28:43,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Producer Shinji Hashimoto was answering some fan questions about some of the Final Fantasy games.

1253
01:28:44,422 --> 01:28:51,808
[SPEAKER_05]: And somebody asked about, hey, is the PlayStation 3 and Vita re-release of Final Fantasy X, is it a remake or is it a remaster?

1254
01:28:52,589 --> 01:28:56,452
[SPEAKER_05]: And Hashimoto said directly, it is a remaster.

1255
01:28:57,133 --> 01:29:01,156
[SPEAKER_05]: So think like the Shadow of the Colossus HD thing that came out not too long ago.

1256
01:29:02,077 --> 01:29:04,841
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't even say it's... Well, that wouldn't be so bad.

1257
01:29:05,522 --> 01:29:08,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully it's not like the Metal Gear Solid stuff.

1258
01:29:08,405 --> 01:29:09,907
[SPEAKER_06]: They look kind of blurry and weird.

1259
01:29:10,588 --> 01:29:16,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, he also went so far to say that the screen is much prettier than the original, but he didn't really elaborate on that whatsoever.

1260
01:29:17,357 --> 01:29:18,138
[SPEAKER_09]: What can I do for you?

1261
01:29:21,397 --> 01:29:23,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me Final Fantasy 7 next.

1262
01:29:23,819 --> 01:29:24,840
[SPEAKER_05]: How about first?

1263
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,421
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what all the fans are saying.

1264
01:29:26,441 --> 01:29:27,882
[SPEAKER_05]: But I get it, though.

1265
01:29:27,982 --> 01:29:29,523
[SPEAKER_05]: It's easier to do this.

1266
01:29:29,744 --> 01:29:38,130
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there was an excellent point that was made is that a lot of the stuff that was in Final Fantasy 7 was still kind of sprite-based, whereas everything in Final Fantasy 10 was full 3D.

1267
01:29:38,491 --> 01:29:41,053
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's much easier to take Final Fantasy 10 and just, you know...

1268
01:29:41,853 --> 01:29:50,458
[SPEAKER_05]: assign it to the new resolution, give it some higher res textures, and maybe remake the menu and go back into some of the things.

1269
01:29:50,478 --> 01:29:53,720
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they'll do some other little things to sweeten the pot, I'm sure.

1270
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:57,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe like a bonus summon or a bonus dungeon or something else.

1271
01:29:58,042 --> 01:30:00,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it'll pay tribute well enough to the original.

1272
01:30:00,904 --> 01:30:04,806
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Final Fantasy X. I know Final Fantasy X has its share of haters, but...

1273
01:30:05,806 --> 01:30:06,607
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was great.

1274
01:30:07,287 --> 01:30:10,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Still to this day, in my opinion, has the best summon of all time.

1275
01:30:11,070 --> 01:30:11,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Shiva.

1276
01:30:11,690 --> 01:30:13,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, when she comes out, snap.

1277
01:30:13,492 --> 01:30:14,092
Bing.

1278
01:30:15,033 --> 01:30:15,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

1279
01:30:17,134 --> 01:30:17,335
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

1280
01:30:19,296 --> 01:30:19,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

1281
01:30:21,177 --> 01:30:23,979
[SPEAKER_05]: How about we travel down memory lane a little bit?

1282
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:25,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds plan-like.

1283
01:30:25,541 --> 01:30:27,122
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we always on this show...

1284
01:30:28,450 --> 01:30:28,770
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1285
01:30:45,843 --> 01:30:47,605
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1286
01:31:12,076 --> 01:31:12,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Puzzle Bobble

1287
01:31:32,874 --> 01:31:34,015
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's cute!

1288
01:31:34,115 --> 01:31:35,536
[SPEAKER_09]: It's super cute!

1289
01:31:35,936 --> 01:31:36,637
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the game.

1290
01:31:38,918 --> 01:31:40,840
[SPEAKER_09]: There were two different versions of the original.

1291
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:48,145
[SPEAKER_09]: There was Puzzle Bobble that came out in Japan only in 1994 on a Taito B system hardware.

1292
01:31:48,585 --> 01:31:49,886
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was originally called Bubble Buster.

1293
01:31:50,666 --> 01:31:53,889
[SPEAKER_09]: And then down the line there was the Neo Geo version of Puzzle Bobble.

1294
01:31:54,469 --> 01:31:55,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait a minute.

1295
01:31:55,030 --> 01:31:56,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Puzzle Bobble was anti-drug?

1296
01:31:56,291 --> 01:31:56,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Pfft.

1297
01:32:16,508 --> 01:32:18,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we talking just an FBI warning in the beginning?

1298
01:32:18,610 --> 01:32:19,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Winners don't use drugs?

1299
01:32:20,051 --> 01:32:20,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1300
01:32:20,291 --> 01:32:20,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

1301
01:32:21,351 --> 01:32:27,316
[SPEAKER_09]: And the title was retained for the US, Canada, and Europe on consoles.

1302
01:32:28,336 --> 01:32:33,040
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically, you have different colored balls for different reasons.

1303
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:34,541
[SPEAKER_09]: They're bubbles.

1304
01:32:35,642 --> 01:32:42,767
[SPEAKER_09]: But you have different colors and you have to... Turn the crank to launch the balls.

1305
01:32:43,747 --> 01:32:45,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, turn the crank to launch the balls.

1306
01:32:46,584 --> 01:32:47,324
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they're doing!

1307
01:32:47,545 --> 01:32:47,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1308
01:32:51,427 --> 01:33:06,355
[SPEAKER_09]: At any rate, you have a little pointer, and yes, it's attached to a crank that Bub and Bob move, and you can bounce these little bubbles up to other bubbles, and when you get three in a row touching, then they pop.

1309
01:33:07,176 --> 01:33:12,699
[SPEAKER_09]: You may have a bunch of one color already up there in a neat colorful pattern, but it gets really complicated, trust me.

1310
01:33:12,879 --> 01:33:15,701
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed that when they touch the balls together, they explode.

1311
01:33:19,389 --> 01:33:31,057
[SPEAKER_09]: So they go in a direct line along the pointer, and as you do a few more in a row, then the ceiling starts to drop down.

1312
01:33:31,217 --> 01:33:36,561
[SPEAKER_09]: When your bubbles hit the very bottom line, then you're game over.

1313
01:33:37,642 --> 01:33:40,684
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't know what this game is, then crawl up from under the rock.

1314
01:33:40,804 --> 01:33:42,685
[SPEAKER_05]: No dipping your balls below the line.

1315
01:33:46,812 --> 01:33:48,192
[SPEAKER_05]: I think DarkSakura's mad at me.

1316
01:33:48,332 --> 01:33:51,073
[SPEAKER_05]: I think DarkSakura's mad at me.

1317
01:33:51,413 --> 01:33:54,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, um... Which were your favorite balls?

1318
01:33:54,154 --> 01:33:54,714
[SPEAKER_05]: The blue ones?

1319
01:33:58,655 --> 01:34:00,135
[SPEAKER_05]: She's trying not to laugh.

1320
01:34:00,236 --> 01:34:01,856
[SPEAKER_05]: She thinks she's mad, but she's not.

1321
01:34:02,056 --> 01:34:02,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up.

1322
01:34:03,636 --> 01:34:04,337
[SPEAKER_09]: You're a bitch.

1323
01:34:06,777 --> 01:34:09,398
[SPEAKER_06]: At any rate, it has a different... She's really busting your balls there.

1324
01:34:10,962 --> 01:34:11,903
[SPEAKER_09]: It's good when your balls drop.

1325
01:34:34,056 --> 01:34:38,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Your score actually will go to 20 points and then 40 and then 80.

1326
01:34:38,817 --> 01:34:40,958
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's an exponential scoring system.

1327
01:34:41,278 --> 01:34:44,039
[SPEAKER_02]: If you rub enough balls together, there's exponential growth.

1328
01:34:44,059 --> 01:34:47,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Maximum is 50,000 points that you get for clearing it within five seconds or less.

1329
01:34:48,180 --> 01:34:51,021
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it drops down to zero over the next minute.

1330
01:34:51,841 --> 01:34:53,643
[SPEAKER_09]: You do have two player modes.

1331
01:34:53,663 --> 01:34:54,404
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not in rounds.

1332
01:34:54,444 --> 01:35:09,103
[SPEAKER_09]: You just each have the arena and the same arrangement, but when you get a large clump broken, it goes on to the opponent's side, kind of the way that how Puyo Puyo works, which is another one of my favorites.

1333
01:35:09,525 --> 01:35:14,009
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, it's Bub and Bob, or as they were doing in Japan, Bubloon and Bobloon.

1334
01:35:15,310 --> 01:35:21,074
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's their same animation from Bubble Bobble, actually closer to Bubble Symphony.

1335
01:35:21,995 --> 01:35:24,317
[SPEAKER_09]: And it also has all the enemies in it.

1336
01:35:24,617 --> 01:35:28,660
[SPEAKER_09]: So the red one is... and I'll do both names...

1337
01:35:29,941 --> 01:35:34,786
[SPEAKER_09]: The English name was Super Socket and Japanese name was Invader.

1338
01:35:34,906 --> 01:35:38,149
[SPEAKER_09]: The yellow one is Hullaballoon or Pull Pull.

1339
01:35:39,551 --> 01:35:40,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Green is Willy Whistle or Drunk.

1340
01:35:41,553 --> 01:35:43,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Blue is Bubble Buster or Zen-Chan.

1341
01:35:43,715 --> 01:35:45,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Purple is Beluga or Monsta.

1342
01:35:46,197 --> 01:35:47,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange is Coily or Bonnie Bow.

1343
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:51,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Black is Incendo or Hide Gonsu.

1344
01:35:51,682 --> 01:35:53,344
[SPEAKER_09]: And white is Stoner or Midas.

1345
01:35:54,591 --> 01:35:55,912
[SPEAKER_05]: And who doesn't want to name their balls?

1346
01:35:56,753 --> 01:36:00,696
[SPEAKER_09]: So, for all the games that came out, there are a bunch of them, and I will go pretty much in order.

1347
01:36:01,116 --> 01:36:07,501
[SPEAKER_09]: There was Puzzle Bobble, Puzzle Bobble 2, which was called Best to Move Again in the US.

1348
01:36:08,501 --> 01:36:11,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Puzzle Bobble 2X, which I believe is the one that I had on Saturn.

1349
01:36:12,284 --> 01:36:19,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Puzzle Bobble 3 in 1986, Puzzle Bobble 4, Puzzle Bobble Mini on the Neo Geo Pocket Color, Super Puzzle Bobble in 1999.

1350
01:36:20,450 --> 01:36:35,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Azumanga Puzzle Dio, which was based off of Azumanga Dio from 2001, Super Puzzle Bobble 2, Super Puzzle Bobble All-Stars, Puzzle Bobble Mobile, which I am playing on my phone, Puzzle Bobble Versus, which was for the N-Gage.

1351
01:36:35,999 --> 01:36:37,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Who remembers the N-Gage?

1352
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:41,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Best Move Deluxe on PSP, Ultra Best Move on Xbox, Puzzle Bobble DS, and

1353
01:36:42,522 --> 01:37:06,125

1354
01:37:06,145 --> 01:37:07,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Space Bust a Move?

1355
01:37:07,826 --> 01:37:23,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Balls in Space, Puzzle Bobble Plus, Puzzle Bobble Live, Puzzle Bobble for iOS, which is Busted Move, Puzzle Bobble 3D, which was Busted Move Universe on the 3DS, New Puzzle Bobble, aka New Busted Move for iOS, and Puzzle Bobble Online.

1356
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:25,460
[SPEAKER_09]: That came out in 2011.

1357
01:37:26,601 --> 01:37:27,282
[SPEAKER_09]: There were clones.

1358
01:37:27,522 --> 01:37:28,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Who remembers Snood?

1359
01:37:30,242 --> 01:37:30,542
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't.

1360
01:37:30,662 --> 01:37:32,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Fortunately, I have sold Snood.

1361
01:37:33,164 --> 01:37:36,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, my friend's mom was hooked on that stupid game.

1362
01:37:36,486 --> 01:37:37,666
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, play the real thing!

1363
01:37:38,387 --> 01:37:43,109
[SPEAKER_09]: There's Frozen Bubble and Bubble Shooter, you know, which I actually... All those crappy Facebook games.

1364
01:37:43,470 --> 01:37:43,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1365
01:37:43,790 --> 01:37:44,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

1366
01:37:44,690 --> 01:37:46,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, Jungle Quest was not one of them.

1367
01:37:47,632 --> 01:37:48,232
[SPEAKER_09]: No Jungle.

1368
01:37:49,093 --> 01:37:52,815
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's actually even a version of it that comes built in with Linux.

1369
01:37:53,015 --> 01:37:54,496
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one on Google+, too, I think.

1370
01:37:54,576 --> 01:37:55,836
[SPEAKER_05]: What about Puzzle de Pon?

1371
01:37:56,156 --> 01:37:57,277
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Puzzle de Pon.

1372
01:37:57,297 --> 01:37:59,037
[SPEAKER_05]: That's nothing to do with... Not like that.

1373
01:37:59,457 --> 01:38:00,878
[SPEAKER_05]: There are no balls in Puzzle de Pon.

1374
01:38:00,978 --> 01:38:01,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there are.

1375
01:38:02,258 --> 01:38:03,419
[SPEAKER_05]: It's exactly the same thing.

1376
01:38:03,459 --> 01:38:06,240
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, that's your game is Puzzle Bobble.

1377
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:08,240
[SPEAKER_09]: For everything.

1378
01:38:10,201 --> 01:38:12,902
[SPEAKER_05]: One question I want to ask that's very important that we didn't address.

1379
01:38:13,803 --> 01:38:18,984
[SPEAKER_05]: What in the actual fuck was this box art on the PlayStation 2 for Super Bus to Move?

1380
01:38:19,144 --> 01:38:20,085
[SPEAKER_09]: It was redonk.

1381
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:23,001
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna post this link in chat.

1382
01:38:23,061 --> 01:38:23,802
[SPEAKER_05]: It's from Amazon.

1383
01:38:23,822 --> 01:38:26,784
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize, it's big, but that's the only place I need to find the box art.

1384
01:38:27,104 --> 01:38:37,512
[SPEAKER_05]: For those listening on the podcast, just go to your favorite retail site, Amazon, whatever, look for Super Bust-a-Move on the PlayStation 2 and tell me, what in the fuck is that box art?

1385
01:38:37,792 --> 01:38:44,817
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a baby blowing a bubble, and in the sunglasses you see glimpses of the... It's... What...

1386
01:38:45,097 --> 01:38:47,518
[SPEAKER_09]: The Saturn one was freaking creepy looking.

1387
01:38:47,538 --> 01:38:48,478
[SPEAKER_09]: That is fucking scary.

1388
01:38:48,838 --> 01:38:49,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Who would buy that?

1389
01:38:49,698 --> 01:38:52,139
[SPEAKER_09]: No, look at the Saturn version.

1390
01:38:52,579 --> 01:38:53,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me see the Saturn version.

1391
01:38:55,539 --> 01:38:56,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, his face is melting.

1392
01:38:57,020 --> 01:38:58,620
[SPEAKER_09]: No, his eyes are being pinned open.

1393
01:39:01,801 --> 01:39:05,042
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, Taito, what kind of crack do you think Americans are on?

1394
01:39:05,642 --> 01:39:10,583
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that company or whoever they hired for marketing was the same one that launched the PlayStation 3.

1395
01:39:13,716 --> 01:39:18,660
[SPEAKER_09]: I did, however, play a shitload of that game on Saturn.

1396
01:39:19,501 --> 01:39:23,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I would just sit in front of it for hours and scream at it.

1397
01:39:23,344 --> 01:39:28,228
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of those games that you see it in the arcade, and if it's 25 cents, you can't help but just check it out, you know?

1398
01:39:28,368 --> 01:39:29,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, even to this day.

1399
01:39:29,569 --> 01:39:31,610
[SPEAKER_05]: I've played this game even recently.

1400
01:39:32,030 --> 01:39:32,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking creepy!

1401
01:39:34,112 --> 01:39:35,693
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was an awesome game!

1402
01:39:36,734 --> 01:39:37,755
[SPEAKER_08]: It still is awesome.

1403
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:39,281
[SPEAKER_05]: All righty.

1404
01:39:39,521 --> 01:39:39,841
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is.

1405
01:39:39,861 --> 01:39:40,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Your classic game of the week.

1406
01:39:41,783 --> 01:39:42,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Puzzle Bobble.

1407
01:39:43,105 --> 01:39:44,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, if you want, Bust a Move.

1408
01:39:45,167 --> 01:39:46,048
[SPEAKER_05]: But not that creepy.

1409
01:39:46,068 --> 01:39:47,890
[SPEAKER_05]: The Japanese box art is so much better.

1410
01:39:48,010 --> 01:39:49,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that creepy Super Bust a Move.

1411
01:39:49,452 --> 01:39:49,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at that.

1412
01:39:50,253 --> 01:39:52,115
[SPEAKER_09]: That should be what it was in the U.S.

1413
01:39:52,155 --> 01:39:55,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead it was a stupid dude trapped in a bubble with his eyes pinned open.

1414
01:39:56,039 --> 01:39:57,360
[SPEAKER_09]: That gives me creep nightmares.

1415
01:39:59,035 --> 01:40:01,838
[SPEAKER_05]: That is definitely one of the monsters in Silent Hill on the box there.

1416
01:40:02,418 --> 01:40:02,678
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1417
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:04,760
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to do it for part A of our show.

1418
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:05,381
[SPEAKER_05]: But guess what?

1419
01:40:05,501 --> 01:40:06,842
[SPEAKER_05]: We are not done yet, kids.

1420
01:40:06,882 --> 01:40:08,263
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got plenty more show to come.

1421
01:40:08,283 --> 01:40:10,065
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got some rapid fire news coming up.

1422
01:40:10,125 --> 01:40:10,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Some more news.

1423
01:40:10,805 --> 01:40:11,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Your emails.

[SPEAKER_05]: The FUs of the week.

1425
01:40:12,927 --> 01:40:14,288
[SPEAKER_05]: And Twitter topics.

1426
01:40:14,608 --> 01:40:15,209
[SPEAKER_05]: And no more balls.

1427
01:40:15,549 --> 01:40:15,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter.com.

1428
01:40:16,630 --> 01:40:17,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know about that.

1429
01:40:17,911 --> 01:40:21,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send in your Twitter topics.

1430
01:40:21,572 --> 01:40:25,674
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, and, and, the Skype line will be open very soon.

1431
01:40:25,934 --> 01:40:28,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Skype us at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

1432
01:40:28,455 --> 01:40:28,996
[SPEAKER_05]: But not just yet.

1433
01:40:29,036 --> 01:40:31,677
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all coming up in part B. So stay tuned, everybody.

1434
01:40:37,734 --> 01:40:45,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio with episode number 445 live on this Sunday evening.

1435
01:40:45,261 --> 01:40:48,664
[SPEAKER_05]: 2-12-12 is the date today.

1436
01:40:49,064 --> 01:40:53,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Join us, of course, live via our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

1437
01:40:53,708 --> 01:40:54,589
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got quite a good show.

1438
01:40:54,789 --> 01:40:57,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Considering we're up against the Grammys tonight, got quite a good showing.

1439
01:40:58,112 --> 01:40:59,093
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am very proud.

1440
01:40:59,193 --> 01:40:59,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say this.

1441
01:40:59,994 --> 01:41:01,956
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very proud of the chatters tonight.

1442
01:41:02,356 --> 01:41:23,620
[SPEAKER_05]: because despite everything that's going on in the world right now there wasn't a single person now of course now that I'm gonna say this everybody's gonna do this but there wasn't a single person that came in a chat tonight and said hey did you guys hear that Whitney Houston died because I was so waiting for that because inevitably when something big happens in the world that really has nothing to do with video games it'll get brought up anyway it's

1443
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:24,641
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1444
01:41:46,172 --> 01:41:48,253
[SPEAKER_06]: on the way home from the park, all Whitney Houston.

1445
01:41:48,613 --> 01:41:52,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Solid Whitney Houston from like... And it was like three songs.

1446
01:41:52,895 --> 01:41:53,735
[SPEAKER_06]: All Whitney Houston.

1447
01:41:53,935 --> 01:41:54,836
[SPEAKER_06]: It was ridiculous.

1448
01:41:55,056 --> 01:41:56,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, it's a tragic loss.

1449
01:41:57,037 --> 01:41:58,837
[SPEAKER_05]: And they all sound very the same.

1450
01:41:59,057 --> 01:42:00,178
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have... Oh, stop it.

1451
01:42:00,658 --> 01:42:02,259
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't really have anything to do with video games.

1452
01:42:03,246 --> 01:42:06,647
[SPEAKER_05]: To be fair, I totally have I want to dance with somebody in SingStar.

1453
01:42:06,967 --> 01:42:08,788
[SPEAKER_05]: So she was in SingStar.

1454
01:42:09,048 --> 01:42:16,110
[SPEAKER_05]: So tip of the hat to a famous SingStar inspiration, I guess, if you want to say that.

1455
01:42:16,731 --> 01:42:16,991
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1456
01:42:17,031 --> 01:42:21,892
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will give a big gold star to all our chatters tonight for keeping it on topic.

1457
01:42:22,232 --> 01:42:29,155
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, even despite all of the unfortunate that happened with Miss Houston, there's not really a lot of talk about the Grammys either.

1458
01:42:29,275 --> 01:42:32,496
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know you guys are focused and I appreciate that.

1459
01:42:33,467 --> 01:42:34,268
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on.

1460
01:42:34,308 --> 01:42:37,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get back into some rapid-fire news.

1461
01:42:37,512 --> 01:42:41,896
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna do some quick news stories, and then we'll get back into the longer stuff.

1462
01:42:41,936 --> 01:42:45,220
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Loki, start us off with some rapid-fire news.

1463
01:42:45,881 --> 01:42:50,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft finally, or Microsoft or LucasArts, I haven't really decided who announced this, but...

1464
01:42:50,826 --> 01:42:53,790
[SPEAKER_06]: They've announced the date for Kinect Star Wars.

1465
01:42:54,251 --> 01:42:54,631
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1466
01:42:54,912 --> 01:42:55,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get excited.

1467
01:42:56,934 --> 01:42:58,016
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming in April.

1468
01:42:58,376 --> 01:42:59,137
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a joke.

1469
01:42:59,337 --> 01:43:00,419
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on April 3rd.

1470
01:43:00,999 --> 01:43:06,086
[SPEAKER_06]: That is probably the closest date they could have added to get it near April Fool's Day.

1471
01:43:06,707 --> 01:43:07,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, actually...

1472
01:43:09,542 --> 01:43:13,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because April 1st is a Sunday.

1473
01:43:14,926 --> 01:43:20,009
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to say that the Xbox that looks like R2-D2 looks pretty kick-ass, though.

1474
01:43:20,249 --> 01:43:22,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so that'll be coming out on the same day as well.

1475
01:43:23,171 --> 01:43:30,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, here's the thing, and I know we've talked about this before, but really, really, they're going to have dancing in there?

1476
01:43:30,836 --> 01:43:32,557
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that just looks stupid.

1477
01:43:32,597 --> 01:43:33,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

1478
01:43:33,338 --> 01:43:34,518
[SPEAKER_05]: They put dancing in there?

1479
01:43:35,719 --> 01:43:36,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God.

1480
01:43:38,499 --> 01:43:39,900
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Star Wars?

1481
01:43:40,061 --> 01:43:41,702
[SPEAKER_06]: That is Connect Star Wars.

1482
01:43:41,943 --> 01:43:43,404
[SPEAKER_05]: That looks like Dance Masters.

1483
01:43:43,524 --> 01:43:44,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

1484
01:43:45,286 --> 01:43:47,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that like cantina dancing or something?

1485
01:43:47,608 --> 01:43:48,549
[SPEAKER_06]: They're gonna have dancing.

1486
01:43:48,589 --> 01:43:50,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, I see Jabba the Hutt back there.

1487
01:43:50,211 --> 01:43:53,114
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like you can be one of his sluts dancing there.

1488
01:43:53,314 --> 01:43:54,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Dance for me, slut.

1489
01:43:57,438 --> 01:44:00,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't that a line that Lucas put back in Return of the Jedi?

1490
01:44:00,279 --> 01:44:02,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he should have.

1491
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:04,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so that will be coming out.

1492
01:44:05,341 --> 01:44:12,084
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, on my eyes in our chat room gives us the greatest line from the trailer, lightsaber on.

1493
01:44:13,804 --> 01:44:15,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, it's all about the voice commands.

1494
01:44:16,246 --> 01:44:21,729
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm telling you, I played this game, and, um, oh my god.

1495
01:44:21,749 --> 01:44:22,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you played it.

1496
01:44:22,750 --> 01:44:23,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god.

1497
01:44:23,670 --> 01:44:24,491
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no, no.

1498
01:44:25,111 --> 01:44:26,812
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you need to see this as well.

1499
01:44:26,832 --> 01:44:27,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no.

1500
01:44:28,393 --> 01:44:29,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Make it stop.

1501
01:44:33,476 --> 01:44:34,817
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just stupid, Loki.

1502
01:44:34,837 --> 01:44:40,861
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that little picture is not helping the rumors about C-3PO's sexuality, because you know that's out there in the fanverse.

1503
01:44:40,901 --> 01:44:41,381
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying.

1504
01:44:42,141 --> 01:44:42,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying.

1505
01:44:44,543 --> 01:44:45,003
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying.

1506
01:44:45,791 --> 01:44:50,982
[SPEAKER_06]: All I gotta say is the one that they had at Disneyland to dance off much better than this shit.

1507
01:44:52,345 --> 01:44:53,547
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know he's dancing to Gaga.

1508
01:44:55,985 --> 01:44:57,506
[SPEAKER_05]: He was programmed this way, baby.

1509
01:45:01,168 --> 01:45:07,931
[SPEAKER_06]: I just hope that it's way better than the versions I've played because those were not good.

1510
01:45:08,531 --> 01:45:11,832
[SPEAKER_06]: That is supposed to be coming out April 3rd.

1511
01:45:13,153 --> 01:45:13,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Some other stuff.

1512
01:45:14,374 --> 01:45:15,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Mario Bros.

1513
01:45:15,614 --> 01:45:19,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Crossover 2 is now out.

1514
01:45:19,076 --> 01:45:19,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Mario Bros.

1515
01:45:20,056 --> 01:45:23,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Crossover is definitely something that's infringing on all sorts of copyrights, but

1516
01:45:24,178 --> 01:45:24,498
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

1517
01:45:41,415 --> 01:45:58,582
[SPEAKER_06]: and basically what version 2 offers you is you still get to play as multiple characters including Mario, Luigi, Link, Samus, Simon Belmont, Mega Man, Bass, Bill Riser, Ryu and Sophia the 3rd from Blaster Master.

1518
01:45:58,702 --> 01:45:59,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Blaster Master.

1519
01:46:00,525 --> 01:46:14,254
[SPEAKER_06]: and then they all have alternate looks because you can also cycle through the game or they cycle randomly through versions of the levels including NES, Super NES and Game Boy styles throughout the game as well.

1520
01:46:14,695 --> 01:46:23,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, apparently Demon Returns, Super Demon Returns and I guess the Super Mario Bros.

1521
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:29,705
[SPEAKER_06]: style game from the DS's Retro Game Challenge 2 are different versions as well.

1522
01:46:30,625 --> 01:46:34,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so, uh, neat.

1523
01:46:34,690 --> 01:46:37,734
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's also a picture that shows Dr. Wily in there.

1524
01:46:37,994 --> 01:46:40,237
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know if you can play as him.

1525
01:46:40,257 --> 01:46:41,158
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be weird.

1526
01:46:41,899 --> 01:46:41,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

1527
01:46:43,604 --> 01:46:44,984
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's that.

1528
01:46:45,225 --> 01:46:51,726
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, quickly, the chatters are asking for the Star Wars dance party pictures.

1529
01:46:52,287 --> 01:46:52,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll link them.

1530
01:46:52,767 --> 01:46:56,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, link them and then Ranma can get them up on the Tumblr for the podcast listeners that want to see it too.

1531
01:46:56,608 --> 01:46:57,808
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so disturbing.

1532
01:46:57,868 --> 01:46:58,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it is a little disturbing.

1533
01:46:58,889 --> 01:47:00,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a warning, don't click.

1534
01:47:02,245 --> 01:47:26,026
[SPEAKER_06]: and then uh finally um apparently there's a rumor that certain and i mean this is probably gonna be happening certain um people that put stuff on the app store are using bots to automatically download their games and boost their rankings in the app store to get more people to download it um

1535
01:47:27,842 --> 01:47:32,124
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't even have to really look into that to know that that's probably true.

1536
01:47:32,184 --> 01:47:38,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's people that put artificially high review scores to boost their reviews and stuff, so why not?

1537
01:47:39,368 --> 01:47:46,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Now's a great time to mention if you want to leave your totally legitimate five-star reviews for Orange Lounge Radio on the iTunes Store, we'd really appreciate it.

1538
01:47:46,412 --> 01:47:48,974
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, click the subscribe button four or five times while you're there.

1539
01:47:51,007 --> 01:47:51,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding, maybe.

1540
01:47:52,248 --> 01:47:53,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not about the five-star reviews, though.

1541
01:47:54,489 --> 01:47:55,610
[SPEAKER_05]: So, all right.

1542
01:47:56,691 --> 01:47:57,851
[SPEAKER_05]: I would not be surprised at all, by the way.

1543
01:47:57,871 --> 01:48:01,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking at some of those games that are in the top 20, like, you really look at, like, how did this get here?

1544
01:48:01,894 --> 01:48:02,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1545
01:48:02,294 --> 01:48:06,356
[SPEAKER_05]: This game is beating Angry Birds and Where's My Water and the stuff you expect to see in the top 10?

1546
01:48:06,697 --> 01:48:06,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1547
01:48:08,218 --> 01:48:08,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1548
01:48:09,438 --> 01:48:14,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of games you expect to see in the top 10 on the iOS store, Tiny Tower.

1549
01:48:14,522 --> 01:48:14,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Look.

1550
01:48:14,802 --> 01:48:15,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Look.

1551
01:48:16,202 --> 01:48:19,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Hate on this game all you want, but it is really fucking addicting.

1552
01:48:20,044 --> 01:48:22,225
[SPEAKER_05]: And how many addicts are playing Tiny Tower?

1553
01:48:22,245 --> 01:48:29,549
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 million, according to a tweet from Ian Marsh that tweeted this week that 10 million folks have downloaded Tiny Tower.

1554
01:48:29,589 --> 01:48:30,390
[SPEAKER_05]: That's on iOS.

1555
01:48:30,410 --> 01:48:33,171
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not counting Android or I think that's it.

1556
01:48:33,211 --> 01:48:35,052
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only also on Android, I believe.

1557
01:48:35,492 --> 01:48:38,173
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a million daily active users.

1558
01:48:38,454 --> 01:48:40,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I am no longer an active player of this game.

1559
01:48:40,755 --> 01:48:41,395
[SPEAKER_05]: I finally quit.

1560
01:48:41,895 --> 01:48:43,176
[SPEAKER_05]: I stopped the crack a few months ago.

1561
01:48:43,556 --> 01:48:44,417
[SPEAKER_05]: How tall is your tower?

1562
01:48:46,058 --> 01:48:47,258
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it pales in comparison to yours.

1563
01:48:47,278 --> 01:48:49,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say it was like 82 stories or something like that.

1564
01:48:49,740 --> 01:48:51,081
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have to get the new shops.

1565
01:48:51,221 --> 01:48:53,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, no, I did get the new shops last time.

1566
01:48:54,083 --> 01:48:55,343
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have the... Oh, that's right.

1567
01:48:55,383 --> 01:48:56,444
[SPEAKER_05]: There are new shops, huh?

1568
01:48:56,644 --> 01:48:57,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn you.

1569
01:48:58,145 --> 01:48:59,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't say things like that.

1570
01:49:00,366 --> 01:49:00,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me look.

1571
01:49:01,347 --> 01:49:03,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you asked, I'm going to fire up my tiny tower.

1572
01:49:03,709 --> 01:49:03,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at this.

1573
01:49:04,009 --> 01:49:07,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't touched this crack in a long time.

1574
01:49:07,864 --> 01:49:10,385
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, did you ever get... You got sucked into Tiny Tower for a little bit, didn't you?

1575
01:49:10,405 --> 01:49:11,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I stopped.

1576
01:49:11,165 --> 01:49:11,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you finally stop?

1577
01:49:12,246 --> 01:49:13,146
[SPEAKER_05]: I stopped it a while back.

1578
01:49:14,127 --> 01:49:14,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Good for you.

1579
01:49:15,307 --> 01:49:15,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1580
01:49:15,747 --> 01:49:19,589
[SPEAKER_05]: My tower is... I do not want to get the plant game.

1581
01:49:19,629 --> 01:49:20,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Leave me alone.

1582
01:49:20,930 --> 01:49:21,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1583
01:49:21,330 --> 01:49:23,151
[SPEAKER_05]: 86 stories tall.

1584
01:49:23,571 --> 01:49:24,151
[SPEAKER_05]: I was close.

1585
01:49:25,211 --> 01:49:30,113
[SPEAKER_05]: And my 86th floor, for the record, is the Nerd Cave Apartments.

1586
01:49:30,834 --> 01:49:31,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

1587
01:49:32,517 --> 01:49:35,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Bimani fans are looking forward to a new arcade game called Sound Vortex Booth.

1588
01:49:35,359 --> 01:49:37,340
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be playable at the AOU 2012 Amusement Expo.

1589
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:41,824
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of a new Bimani game.

1590
01:49:52,171 --> 01:49:52,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1591
01:50:13,895 --> 01:50:22,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, also making its way to AOU, an arcade version of Dance Evolution, uh, a new version of Ubeat as well.

1592
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:24,541
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't know this series was still going.

1593
01:50:24,942 --> 01:50:27,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania XG3.

1594
01:50:27,803 --> 01:50:31,345
[SPEAKER_05]: I had no idea that series was still alive and kicking, but there you go.

1595
01:50:32,706 --> 01:50:48,564
[SPEAKER_05]: and lastly from me, Nintendo of America has hired a new spokesperson and following in the footsteps of what Carrie Underwood has been a Nintendo spokesperson, Beyonce has been a Nintendo spokesperson, who could live up to those great, great musicians?

1596
01:50:49,005 --> 01:50:50,807
[SPEAKER_05]: How about Oogie?

1597
01:50:52,540 --> 01:50:54,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Oogie is a Jack Russell Terrier.

1598
01:50:54,460 --> 01:50:54,921
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1599
01:50:54,981 --> 01:50:57,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo has hired a dog to be their next spokesperson.

1600
01:50:58,341 --> 01:51:05,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, to be fair, this dog is very famous because this dog appears in the movie The Artist, which is like, you know, the movie they all say is going to win the Oscar.

1601
01:51:06,063 --> 01:51:06,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1602
01:51:06,563 --> 01:51:07,503
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen the movie.

1603
01:51:07,523 --> 01:51:11,564
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently the dog plays one of those like way too cute roles that, you know, is very memorable.

1604
01:51:12,204 --> 01:51:13,865
[SPEAKER_05]: And what game will he be pimping?

1605
01:51:14,145 --> 01:51:14,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Guesses.

1606
01:51:15,025 --> 01:51:15,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Guesses.

1607
01:51:16,991 --> 01:51:31,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendogs of course Nintendogs plus cats which I have something to say about that in a second and and and the Pearl Pink 3DS aww for the record I found Nintendogs plus cats in the clearance bin at Fry's nice how much?

1608
01:51:31,534 --> 01:51:43,756
[SPEAKER_06]: 14 bucks I'm not surprised they need to fucking sell those they probably have like tons on their shelves people are like hey this is just Nintendogs again there's no cats yeah

1609
01:51:45,795 --> 01:51:50,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, DarkSakura Well, how about Sonic?

1610
01:51:51,619 --> 01:52:04,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing is getting a sequel And it will be out, it looks like, at the end of the year So hey, fun, I tried to play it, I didn't really care for it

01:52:06,228 --> 01:52:17,141
[SPEAKER_09]: and then there is, and more racing news, LittleBigPlanet Karting that will be coming out and it was actually announced via Twitter.

1612
01:52:18,722 --> 01:52:28,050
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya said this in the Mod Forums, but isn't LittleBigPlanet Karting basically Mod Nation Racers?

1613
01:52:28,470 --> 01:52:35,536
[SPEAKER_06]: It is, and they actually do have a poster for it that is on the NeoGAF forums, I think.

1614
01:52:37,257 --> 01:52:52,527
[SPEAKER_05]: and um you know what though yes it is but i think that this will be more fun i you know what as much like i want to hate on this but i can't be why because little big planet seriously is like the best thing sony has right now in my opinion i mean i fucking love those games

1615
01:52:53,847 --> 01:53:00,110
[SPEAKER_09]: The last bit of news has to do with Rock Band and it's the releases that are coming out I believe around Valentine's Day.

1616
01:53:00,950 --> 01:53:05,652
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's the Gold Star My Heart Pack and here is what's on it.

1617
01:53:06,313 --> 01:53:09,514
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Alone by Heart which I freaking want that song.

1618
01:53:11,135 --> 01:53:11,735
[SPEAKER_09]: I want that song.

1619
01:53:12,175 --> 01:53:13,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to sing it in the privacy of your own home?

1620
01:53:14,502 --> 01:53:17,385
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll sing it with people around if you want to hear me try to break my voice.

1621
01:53:18,406 --> 01:53:24,972
[SPEAKER_09]: There's To Be With You by Mr. Big, Every Rose Has Its Thorn by Poison, and the Rick Roland song.

1622
01:53:25,452 --> 01:53:25,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, wait, wait.

1623
01:53:25,913 --> 01:53:28,775
[SPEAKER_05]: You mean I finally have an excuse to do this to the listeners?

1624
01:53:29,316 --> 01:53:29,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1625
01:53:30,357 --> 01:53:32,259
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been waiting 10 years.

1626
01:53:32,919 --> 01:53:33,800
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 freaking years.

1627
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:34,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Never going to give you up.

1628
01:53:35,262 --> 01:53:37,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, to get trolled by an ad on YouTube.

1629
01:53:39,225 --> 01:53:39,865
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I get.

1630
01:53:39,965 --> 01:53:45,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, and for To Be With You and Every Rose Has Its Thorn, it's got pro guitar and bass expansions.

1631
01:53:48,069 --> 01:53:48,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Delayed punchline.

1632
01:53:48,909 --> 01:53:49,530
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

1633
01:53:54,315 --> 01:53:56,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you noticed that he still looks exactly like that?

1634
01:54:24,677 --> 01:54:25,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I would play that song.

1635
01:54:26,198 --> 01:54:26,879
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be awesome.

1636
01:54:26,919 --> 01:54:27,439
[SPEAKER_06]: What, alone?

1637
01:54:27,699 --> 01:54:28,240
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not alone.

1638
01:54:28,300 --> 01:54:28,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck alone.

1639
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:32,022
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm talking about... Fuck you, Heart is awesome.

1640
01:54:33,223 --> 01:54:34,084
[SPEAKER_09]: We saw Heart.

1641
01:54:34,384 --> 01:54:37,586
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we did see Heart, like two songs, because we were late to the concert.

1642
01:54:38,267 --> 01:54:40,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Best concert lineup ever.

1643
01:54:41,609 --> 01:54:43,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Heart and Journey.

1644
01:54:43,831 --> 01:54:44,691
[SPEAKER_05]: It does not get more awesome.

1645
01:54:44,772 --> 01:54:46,313
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter who opened for Heart.

1646
01:54:46,793 --> 01:54:48,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheap trick, but whatever.

1647
01:54:49,315 --> 01:54:49,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyhow.

1648
01:54:52,077 --> 01:54:53,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's been a cat sighting.

1649
01:54:53,478 --> 01:54:56,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we're going to get back into some longer news here.

1650
01:54:57,321 --> 01:55:01,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Join us in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you are listening live on this Sunday evening.

1651
01:55:02,525 --> 01:55:04,827
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we finally had cats seen during the show.

1652
01:55:05,227 --> 01:55:10,592
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a very vocal... Oh, Alan says they could smell the lunch meat.

1653
01:55:11,873 --> 01:55:12,713
[SPEAKER_08]: There goes that tail.

1654
01:55:15,896 --> 01:55:16,496
[SPEAKER_05]: There they go.

1655
01:55:16,656 --> 01:55:17,377
[SPEAKER_05]: They're on out of here.

1656
01:55:18,121 --> 01:55:20,023
[SPEAKER_05]: The chatters are talking about the Rickroll.

1657
01:55:20,323 --> 01:55:22,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Akuma JP says, oh, this is the end of OLR.

1658
01:55:22,965 --> 01:55:26,368
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the moment we jumped the shark when we Rickrolled all the listeners there.

1659
01:55:27,368 --> 01:55:27,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1660
01:55:29,950 --> 01:55:38,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Stan in our chatroom says, Rob should do a karaoke version of the Rickroll song and use his re-recording as a sound bit for the show when he wants to fuck around with the audience.

1661
01:55:39,938 --> 01:55:40,098
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1662
01:55:41,660 --> 01:55:44,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft in our chatroom says, forever alone.

1663
01:55:45,463 --> 01:55:46,023
[SPEAKER_05]: See what he did there?

1664
01:55:46,263 --> 01:55:47,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Forever alone.

1665
01:55:50,181 --> 01:55:51,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to some news, Loki.

1666
01:55:51,922 --> 01:56:00,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so the Skyrim creation kit came out this week with the Steam packs and stuff.

1667
01:56:00,088 --> 01:56:06,293
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a high resolution texture pack and also there is a portal cameo.

1668
01:56:06,373 --> 01:56:15,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently you can download an add-on that creates the space core visiting your game.

1669
01:56:15,259 --> 01:56:16,080
[SPEAKER_06]: It crashes into...

1670
01:56:16,710 --> 01:56:19,312
[SPEAKER_05]: It really just goes to show, GLaDOS makes everything better.

1671
01:56:19,753 --> 01:56:22,715
[SPEAKER_05]: And... Space!

1672
01:56:22,775 --> 01:56:27,659
[SPEAKER_06]: And the space core can be used to craft a helmet that looks like one of the cores as well.

1673
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:29,661
[SPEAKER_05]: That is so awesome.

1674
01:56:31,652 --> 01:56:38,656
[SPEAKER_05]: You really should have a thing on the PC where then once you do that quest you get like a costume in Portal 2 for the little dudes in co-op.

1675
01:56:39,516 --> 01:56:51,462
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's also a rumor, thanks to someone that was digging around some of the console command set, there's a quest that's tied to all that too that they haven't unlocked yet.

1676
01:56:52,763 --> 01:57:14,291
[SPEAKER_06]: that's awesome um some other cool stuff uh i want to see or i saw on there they had a mod that someone made that it was a giant horse and a bunch of people like you know whacking at it with you know swords and stuff like that and they named you know bethesda and valve and stuff like that and it was the arrow in the knee thing you know they're beating a dead horse haha

1677
01:57:16,531 --> 01:57:17,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, okay.

1678
01:57:18,573 --> 01:57:19,874
[SPEAKER_05]: That's some intellectual humor there.

1679
01:57:20,295 --> 01:57:33,127
[SPEAKER_06]: But one of the things, though, one of the most popular mods that's actually available on this creation kit service is something that removes that arrow in the needle line from the game so that you don't have to ever hear that again.

1680
01:57:33,227 --> 01:57:33,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Brilliant.

1681
01:57:34,833 --> 01:57:35,774
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1682
01:57:59,171 --> 01:58:02,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Alan's just like, no, this was legitimately Alan's reaction.

1683
01:58:02,793 --> 01:58:05,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I knew I forgot to put the armor on.

1684
01:58:07,115 --> 01:58:10,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I am playing possibly one of the sluttiest games of Skyrim ever.

1685
01:58:10,217 --> 01:58:16,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone is modded to be like, not naked, but just, and they're in, you know, Norway or whatever.

1686
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:19,481
[SPEAKER_02]: They all look very cold, but yeah, everyone's very sexy.

1687
01:58:21,489 --> 01:58:29,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the male armors that I have have the back piece missing, so their ass is hanging out, and I'm like, this is hot, and they're beating on the dragon with his ass hanging out.

1688
01:58:30,373 --> 01:58:35,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but there's a lot of stuff that you could do, but it required you to move files and stuff like that.

1689
01:58:35,516 --> 01:58:38,057
[SPEAKER_06]: The creation kit kind of simplifies all that.

1690
01:58:38,097 --> 01:58:41,539
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a launcher, and you basically, okay, I want this, this, this, this, go.

1691
01:58:42,379 --> 01:58:44,220
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's all you do.

1692
01:58:45,509 --> 01:59:07,084
[SPEAKER_02]: for anyone playing Skyrim on PC you absolutely have to get at least Sky UI it's a complete UI an inventory replacer and also I think it's called categorized favorites menu it completely changes the UI which I hated originally and it's like a different game super awesome unannounced Alan cameo thank you

1693
01:59:08,573 --> 01:59:09,734
[SPEAKER_05]: No, don't apologize.

1694
01:59:10,575 --> 01:59:13,818
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the minute he heard Skyrim, he's like, I should come out and make a sandwich.

1695
01:59:14,658 --> 01:59:17,360
[SPEAKER_05]: I should take a break from Skyrim to go talk about Skyrim, right?

1696
01:59:17,381 --> 01:59:22,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I heard you like Skyrim, so here's some Skyrim while you're Skyrimming.

1697
01:59:24,614 --> 01:59:53,356
[SPEAKER_06]: I really do want to I want to get it for my laptop here but I'm playing it on my PC or not my PS3 the 360 right now I love that they did the higher resolution textures I wish they had that like you know how Battlefield 3 I understand that for PC but I said you know how like Battlefield 3 had a thing where you can install high res textures to your hard drive I wish they had that for like the 360 that would be pretty awesome I understand why they don't but you know

1698
01:59:53,772 --> 01:59:57,394
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw in our chatroom says, I'm sure the furries are messing around with the Skyrim mods.

1699
01:59:57,414 --> 02:00:00,996
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd be surprised the stuff you can find and it's not safe for work.

1700
02:00:02,583 --> 02:00:04,925
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically someone has turned Skyrim into Second Life.

1701
02:00:05,425 --> 02:00:06,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I understanding this correctly?

1702
02:00:08,147 --> 02:00:11,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft says, I want Skyrim so I can mod it with my little pony stuff.

1703
02:00:13,071 --> 02:00:14,212
[SPEAKER_05]: They have that already.

1704
02:00:14,632 --> 02:00:22,678
[SPEAKER_05]: As much as I love having Skyrim on the PlayStation 3 so I can use my controller and all that, I have to admit I am somewhat starting to regret not getting it on PC.

1705
02:00:23,438 --> 02:00:28,202
[SPEAKER_05]: The minute I saw that Macho Man dragon mod,

1706
02:00:29,517 --> 02:00:32,258
[SPEAKER_06]: If you had a JTAG, you can do that.

1707
02:00:32,618 --> 02:00:37,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, wasn't the PlayStation supposed to get some of the popular community mods at some point down the line?

1708
02:00:37,619 --> 02:00:41,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they had that whole Steam integration thing that they used for one game.

1709
02:00:41,460 --> 02:00:42,681
[SPEAKER_06]: That was fucking awesome.

1710
02:00:42,961 --> 02:00:51,983
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, though, I think now that modding is officially embraced and now that things can be officially signed off by Bethesda, maybe that's a possibility down the line.

1711
02:00:52,523 --> 02:00:52,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1712
02:00:52,963 --> 02:00:53,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

1713
02:00:53,484 --> 02:00:54,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Not gonna happen.

1714
02:00:55,924 --> 02:00:56,224
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1715
02:00:56,264 --> 02:00:56,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Never say never.

1716
02:00:57,345 --> 02:00:58,725
[SPEAKER_05]: There'll be a fee, but never say never.

1717
02:01:00,333 --> 02:01:21,470
[SPEAKER_06]: and well the other thing I was going to say is you know I don't know if you saw but like they had a whole I don't know what they called it it was a Bethesda kind of hey team members make whatever you want during a week and then show us what you have for Skyrim so they were able to make whatever mod they want and

1718
02:01:21,633 --> 02:01:32,500
[SPEAKER_06]: And they came up with a whole bunch of cool shit that they could have thrown in there, but, oh, we couldn't give them another week to do what they want, you know, because that would be, you know, too awesome.

1719
02:01:33,581 --> 02:01:34,942
[SPEAKER_06]: They have, like, spears.

1720
02:01:34,982 --> 02:01:36,723
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a giant enemy crab.

1721
02:01:37,424 --> 02:01:37,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Eh?

1722
02:01:37,824 --> 02:01:37,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Eh?

1723
02:01:38,024 --> 02:01:39,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Giant enemy crab.

1724
02:01:40,145 --> 02:01:44,408
[SPEAKER_06]: All sorts of, you know, improvements, seasonal changes, stuff like that.

1725
02:01:44,428 --> 02:01:46,410
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just amazing.

1726
02:01:46,430 --> 02:01:46,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1727
02:01:46,770 --> 02:01:50,392
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a silence to one in our chatroom says, Odaving is rainbow bright.

1728
02:01:50,492 --> 02:01:51,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Best mod right there.

1729
02:01:55,175 --> 02:01:57,116
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess you can change one of the characters into Rainbow Bright.

1730
02:02:00,238 --> 02:02:03,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Why have naked people when you can have 80s cartoon nostalgia?

1731
02:02:04,020 --> 02:02:05,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not have both?

1732
02:02:08,339 --> 02:02:08,879
[SPEAKER_06]: You're sick.

1733
02:02:09,139 --> 02:02:13,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm not saying Rainbow Brite has to be naked, but you can have naked people and you can have Rainbow Brite.

1734
02:02:13,181 --> 02:02:13,521
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1735
02:02:13,561 --> 02:02:14,501
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how I feel about this.

1736
02:02:14,681 --> 02:02:15,381
[SPEAKER_05]: This is awkward.

1737
02:02:15,421 --> 02:02:16,402
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an awkward conversation.

1738
02:02:16,422 --> 02:02:18,762
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to be able to have all these different dragons.

1739
02:02:18,802 --> 02:02:20,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I want to have a Macho Man dragon.

1740
02:02:20,263 --> 02:02:22,584
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to have these, you know, My Little Pony dragon.

1741
02:02:22,624 --> 02:02:25,144
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to have, I don't know what other dragons they have out there.

1742
02:02:25,164 --> 02:02:29,706
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, maybe, you know, maybe a Family Guy Peter Griffin dragon or something like that or...

1743
02:02:30,014 --> 02:02:32,916
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to have a mod that makes one of my companions Loki.

1744
02:02:34,277 --> 02:02:35,418
[SPEAKER_05]: And he always just yells.

1745
02:02:36,379 --> 02:02:37,620
[SPEAKER_05]: He always gets really irritated.

1746
02:02:37,660 --> 02:02:39,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, why are you doing that?

1747
02:02:39,822 --> 02:02:41,263
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it could shout and knock people away.

1748
02:02:45,246 --> 02:02:45,926
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be awesome.

1749
02:02:47,207 --> 02:02:47,487
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1750
02:02:48,127 --> 02:02:53,068
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why Loki didn't have this story because it's more relevant to his interest, but I'll read it and then Loki can react to it.

1751
02:02:53,968 --> 02:03:01,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Eat, Sleep, Play, who is the developer behind Twisted Metal, which, you know, remember the series was like big back in the day and now it's all nostalgic again.

1752
02:03:01,511 --> 02:03:03,831
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know what they're doing with this game, to be honest.

1753
02:03:03,991 --> 02:03:06,272
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a new one coming out like what, this week?

1754
02:03:07,012 --> 02:03:10,796
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to get it, but we'll see.

1755
02:03:10,816 --> 02:03:11,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'll get it.

1756
02:03:11,757 --> 02:03:16,762
[SPEAKER_05]: According to the Salt Lake City Tribune, David Jaffe is not with Eat Sleep Play anymore.

1757
02:03:16,863 --> 02:03:17,744
[SPEAKER_05]: He left the company.

1758
02:03:18,444 --> 02:03:20,446
[SPEAKER_05]: He's off to pursue casual games.

1759
02:03:22,208 --> 02:03:24,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that worked so well last time.

1760
02:03:24,230 --> 02:03:28,275
[SPEAKER_05]: He responded and called it highly exaggerated, but he didn't deny that he left.

1761
02:03:29,215 --> 02:03:32,077
[SPEAKER_05]: So apparently there's been reductions and all this stuff.

1762
02:03:32,797 --> 02:03:38,460
[SPEAKER_05]: David Jaffe did confirm that following the release of Twisted Metal, he is going to step away from Eat Sleep Play.

1763
02:03:38,760 --> 02:03:39,961
[SPEAKER_05]: There have been layoffs.

1764
02:03:40,761 --> 02:03:45,303
[SPEAKER_05]: This affects the offices in Utah, which is interesting because David Jaffe lives in California.

1765
02:03:45,804 --> 02:03:52,107
[SPEAKER_05]: But he did mention that, that directing a game from a distance and all that did take its toll.

1766
02:03:52,607 --> 02:03:56,609
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's not good when the game... I mean, well, I don't know.

1767
02:03:57,049 --> 02:04:09,428
[SPEAKER_05]: it's easy to sit here and say oh that looks bad but then at the same time it's also very common in the industry when a game is done for there to be layoffs so but I guess this means they aren't starting work on a sequel right away

1768
02:04:10,236 --> 02:04:11,776
[SPEAKER_06]: He said there's going to be no DLC.

1769
02:04:12,356 --> 02:04:14,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Zero DLC for it.

1770
02:04:15,077 --> 02:04:15,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1771
02:04:15,857 --> 02:04:17,137
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.

1772
02:04:17,397 --> 02:04:19,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Part of me is like, good, it's all on the disc.

1773
02:04:19,338 --> 02:04:24,019
[SPEAKER_05]: But then I'm like, oh wait, maybe it's bad because that means they're just putting it out there.

1774
02:04:24,159 --> 02:04:33,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Aside from the pre-order bonus that you can get for pre-ordering the game, aside from that, there's going to be no DLC for Twisted Mill.

1775
02:04:33,861 --> 02:04:34,081
[SPEAKER_06]: None.

1776
02:04:34,341 --> 02:04:35,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

1777
02:04:50,279 --> 02:04:52,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, there's that.

1778
02:04:52,881 --> 02:04:55,682
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see what this game has in store.

1779
02:04:55,782 --> 02:04:59,604
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, I'm not hearing good things about it, which is kind of disappointing.

1780
02:04:59,845 --> 02:05:01,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, you're still going to get in on it?

1781
02:05:01,686 --> 02:05:03,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because you love the old ones?

1782
02:05:03,547 --> 02:05:04,427
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1783
02:05:05,408 --> 02:05:05,768
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1784
02:05:05,788 --> 02:05:08,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's go to the email bag.

1785
02:05:08,129 --> 02:05:12,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is where we invite your emails each and every week.

1786
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:14,260
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1787
02:05:35,857 --> 02:05:45,165
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say iPod, but some jackass dumb shit who took an arrow to the knee of their knowledge stole that from me along with my 3DS, DS Lite, and FM transmitter.

1788
02:05:45,665 --> 02:05:59,237
[SPEAKER_09]: The DS I had I marked with my girlfriend's initials, taped over with duct tape, and had an R4 flash card with all of my DS backups and old school ROMs, and my 3DS I had a lot of...

1789
02:06:01,318 --> 02:06:05,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I had a lot of 90s pop and DDR OSTs on the SD card.

1790
02:06:05,861 --> 02:06:08,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Was super glued in and locked in with a flap of duct tape.

1791
02:06:09,163 --> 02:06:11,944
[SPEAKER_09]: If he or she is listening, give me back my stuff, you bitch.

1792
02:06:12,425 --> 02:06:16,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly, it sounds like someone knew you had all that stuff in your case.

1793
02:06:16,147 --> 02:06:17,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Peace out, DS Lover.

1794
02:06:17,788 --> 02:06:20,930
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I want to know who we bumped off to become number one.

1795
02:06:22,371 --> 02:06:24,132
[SPEAKER_05]: DS Lover didn't say which podcast.

1796
02:06:24,152 --> 02:06:26,093
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to know who we bumped off to be number one.

1797
02:06:26,934 --> 02:06:27,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Next email.

1798
02:06:27,875 --> 02:06:28,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, yes.

1799
02:06:29,557 --> 02:06:30,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop it right now.

1800
02:06:31,058 --> 02:06:32,199
[SPEAKER_09]: No, she's gone to join her career.

1801
02:06:32,279 --> 02:06:32,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop it.

1802
02:06:33,881 --> 02:06:34,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Read the next email.

1803
02:06:34,882 --> 02:06:43,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear Dearlings, With the non-holiday holiday coming up on Tuesday, I was wondering if I could get some Valentine's Day video game recommendations out of you.

1804
02:06:43,370 --> 02:06:45,332
[SPEAKER_09]: The game I'm looking for should be one of the following.

1805
02:06:45,632 --> 02:06:46,833
[SPEAKER_09]: A. A romantic game.

1806
02:06:46,933 --> 02:06:50,317
[SPEAKER_09]: A game with a realistic portrayal of romance that is pulled off in a convincing manner.

1807
02:06:50,877 --> 02:06:54,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Not something where the characters are driven by wanting to engage in hot monkey sex.

1808
02:06:54,659 --> 02:07:00,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Rather a game where the characters are motivated by wanting to engage in a truly enriching romantic relationship.

1809
02:07:01,101 --> 02:07:02,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Or B, a game to play while drunk.

1810
02:07:03,302 --> 02:07:05,883
[SPEAKER_09]: A game that is ideal to play while you are drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk.

1811
02:07:06,403 --> 02:07:06,824
[SPEAKER_09]: and I have a game

1812
02:07:22,711 --> 02:07:23,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Love Plus.

1813
02:07:23,372 --> 02:07:26,854
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say Catherine.

1814
02:07:27,435 --> 02:07:28,816
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say Catherine, actually.

1815
02:07:29,456 --> 02:07:30,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Or Girl Gun.

1816
02:07:32,338 --> 02:07:32,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Gal Gun.

1817
02:07:33,299 --> 02:07:37,242
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's true love, you can play rock band together all night long.

1818
02:07:37,422 --> 02:07:38,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Get Catherine.

1819
02:07:39,023 --> 02:07:46,509
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's single love, then... If it's self love, then it's going to be the guy game.

1820
02:07:46,649 --> 02:07:46,849
[SPEAKER_05]: First...

1821
02:07:49,173 --> 02:07:52,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, I haven't heard of that game in like six years.

1822
02:07:53,854 --> 02:07:57,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't that game banned because there was a 17-year-old naked in it?

1823
02:07:57,575 --> 02:07:58,575
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know which one.

1824
02:07:58,915 --> 02:08:01,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Metal Gear Solid, because remember, love can bloom on the battlefield.

1825
02:08:01,836 --> 02:08:03,056
[SPEAKER_06]: And they can all be underage.

1826
02:08:03,076 --> 02:08:03,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Love is a battlefield?

1827
02:08:04,137 --> 02:08:07,557
[SPEAKER_09]: No, there's a line, Snake, can love bloom on the battlefield?

1828
02:08:09,198 --> 02:08:11,898
[SPEAKER_05]: RDGSinge in our chatroom suggests, Leisure Shoot Larry 3.

1829
02:08:11,958 --> 02:08:13,519
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good suggestion.

1830
02:08:13,539 --> 02:08:14,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Playboy the Mansion.

1831
02:08:15,882 --> 02:08:17,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Get Catherine.

1832
02:08:17,843 --> 02:08:20,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it self-love or was it duo-love?

1833
02:08:21,324 --> 02:08:25,205
[SPEAKER_09]: A game with realistic portrayal of romance that is pulled off in a convincing manner.

1834
02:08:26,006 --> 02:08:29,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Not where the characters are driven by wanting to engage in hot monkey sex.

1835
02:08:31,767 --> 02:08:32,888
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to think of any JRPGs.

1836
02:08:32,988 --> 02:08:35,049
[SPEAKER_09]: I also got to say hot monkey sex a lot.

1837
02:08:38,230 --> 02:08:39,230
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the Tokimeki games.

1838
02:08:42,352 --> 02:08:44,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Donkey Kong Final Fantasy VIII?

1839
02:08:44,233 --> 02:08:44,753
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1840
02:08:45,213 --> 02:08:46,254
[SPEAKER_09]: What can I do for you?

1841
02:08:46,474 --> 02:08:47,735
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1842
02:08:48,795 --> 02:08:51,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Just get Catherine.

1843
02:08:52,517 --> 02:08:53,277
[SPEAKER_05]: What was that really?

1844
02:08:54,458 --> 02:08:55,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it on the PSP?

1845
02:08:55,379 --> 02:08:55,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Brooktown?

1846
02:08:56,219 --> 02:08:59,501
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you want to play a game while you're drunk that's just going to piss you off.

1847
02:09:00,001 --> 02:09:01,602
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll never be able to find that game.

1848
02:09:01,942 --> 02:09:05,344
[SPEAKER_09]: No, if you want a game that's just going to piss you off while you're drunk, play Irritating Stick.

1849
02:09:07,264 --> 02:09:08,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Move next email.

1850
02:09:10,108 --> 02:09:24,212
[SPEAKER_09]: The ECA put out a call to action to discover state laws relating to EULA.

1851
02:09:24,913 --> 02:09:29,554
[SPEAKER_09]: They used some of the verbiage from my previous inquiry to Maryland's Consumer Protection Office.

1852
02:09:30,014 --> 02:09:35,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Blow is what appears to be another canned response, and only the first two sentences seem remotely related to my email.

1853
02:09:36,696 --> 02:09:43,860
[SPEAKER_09]: What makes this cool is the letter I sent to OLR a couple of months, which Jamie read, was used as a basis for the official ECA letter.

1854
02:09:44,280 --> 02:09:47,641
[SPEAKER_09]: ECA confirmed that they liked parts of the letter enough to include in their letter.

1855
02:09:48,062 --> 02:09:54,545
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the first time I ever influenced something so countrywide, but also Canada, except, of course, OLR Mailbag, which is clearly worldwide.

1856
02:09:55,745 --> 02:10:02,228
[SPEAKER_09]: The goal of this letter writing campaign is to establish what the current laws for each state are and then maybe we can start talking about changing it.

1857
02:10:02,648 --> 02:10:09,151
[SPEAKER_09]: I suggest sending the ECA letter to your state legislatures as well as the Attorney General of your respective state.

1858
02:10:09,531 --> 02:10:14,153
[SPEAKER_09]: This may boil down to actually having to hire a business lawyer to find out.

1859
02:10:18,934 --> 02:10:19,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Good idea.

1860
02:10:19,434 --> 02:10:24,736
[SPEAKER_09]: So his email was used in the... His letter was basically turned into the form letter for the ECA.

1861
02:10:24,836 --> 02:10:25,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Go you.

1862
02:10:26,677 --> 02:10:27,557
[SPEAKER_05]: You a celebrity.

1863
02:10:28,777 --> 02:10:29,378
[SPEAKER_05]: A winner is you.

1864
02:10:29,498 --> 02:10:30,038
[SPEAKER_05]: You like Whitney.

1865
02:10:30,158 --> 02:10:32,239
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean... I couldn't help it.

1866
02:10:32,959 --> 02:10:34,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop it right now.

1867
02:10:35,560 --> 02:10:36,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Party foul.

1868
02:10:37,400 --> 02:10:38,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we have two emails left.

1869
02:10:39,441 --> 02:10:40,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Two more emails?

1870
02:10:40,641 --> 02:10:41,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up.

1871
02:10:41,222 --> 02:10:41,922
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the one reading them.

1872
02:10:43,416 --> 02:10:44,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they wanted the discount.

1873
02:11:07,463 --> 02:11:07,763
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1874
02:11:07,843 --> 02:11:08,543
[SPEAKER_09]: And last email.

1875
02:11:37,216 --> 02:11:40,278
[SPEAKER_06]: I only have like two UMD games anyways because I sold the rest off.

1876
02:11:40,318 --> 02:11:42,359
[SPEAKER_06]: I have like some of the Grand Theft Auto games.

1877
02:11:42,379 --> 02:11:43,419
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually have a bunch.

1878
02:11:43,680 --> 02:11:44,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I have quite a few.

1879
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:46,881
[SPEAKER_06]: All my Q Entertainment games.

1880
02:11:46,941 --> 02:11:47,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Every Xtend Extra.

1881
02:11:48,202 --> 02:11:50,864
[SPEAKER_09]: But we also have a PSP, so it doesn't matter.

1882
02:11:52,004 --> 02:11:52,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Greetings, OLR.

1883
02:11:53,345 --> 02:11:54,526
[SPEAKER_09]: It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

1884
02:11:55,046 --> 02:11:56,467
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a somewhat odd question.

1885
02:11:56,647 --> 02:11:57,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Please don't take this the wrong way.

1886
02:11:57,907 --> 02:12:00,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Your show is my absolute favorite among video game podcasts.

1887
02:12:00,909 --> 02:12:01,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Answer my question.

1888
02:12:02,030 --> 02:12:05,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you mention any other video game podcasts that you like or listen to?

1889
02:12:06,473 --> 02:12:17,093
[SPEAKER_09]: The caveat, I want to know about other shows besides what's on the All Games Network I used to like Derek, but there's way too much cursing for my liking Why do I ask OLR this question?

1890
02:12:19,728 --> 02:12:26,091
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to step it up!

1891
02:12:26,691 --> 02:12:29,032
[SPEAKER_05]: What the fuck is your problem, dude?

1892
02:12:29,652 --> 02:12:31,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me read the email!

1893
02:12:31,953 --> 02:12:36,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm a carpenter and choose to work by myself all day and need good stuff to listen to.

1894
02:12:36,675 --> 02:12:41,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Which means that every Monday morning I start out my week with OLR, but by lunch I'm out of video game related material.

1895
02:12:42,478 --> 02:12:44,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Any shows that you like, I'm sure to like.

1896
02:12:44,902 --> 02:12:46,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep up the best podcasts on air.

1897
02:12:46,684 --> 02:12:48,446
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are a great way to start out each week.

1898
02:12:48,867 --> 02:12:53,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, being on the right coast, I never knew what Pinkberry is, but after looking at their website, I am extremely jealous.

1899
02:12:54,515 --> 02:12:55,456
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are awesome.

1900
02:12:55,476 --> 02:12:57,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Your loyal turtle in Philly, Serious Turtle.

1901
02:12:57,799 --> 02:12:58,780
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1902
02:13:13,968 --> 02:13:14,809
[SPEAKER_05]: See, here's the thing.

1903
02:13:15,489 --> 02:13:18,571
[SPEAKER_05]: I listen to a lot of stuff that's not video game related whatsoever.

1904
02:13:18,691 --> 02:13:22,073
[SPEAKER_05]: And the stuff that is video game related is kind of all game shows.

1905
02:13:22,353 --> 02:13:23,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1906
02:13:23,113 --> 02:13:24,674
[SPEAKER_05]: You mentioned Derek's Dead Pixel Live.

1907
02:13:24,694 --> 02:13:25,735
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's what he was talking about.

1908
02:13:25,775 --> 02:13:26,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Dead Pixel Live.

1909
02:13:26,816 --> 02:13:28,136
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's a good... I like it.

1910
02:13:28,256 --> 02:13:30,137
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think there's that much... I like Fantastic Forum.

1911
02:13:32,859 --> 02:13:50,985
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like Video Game Outsiders and they have a rhythm very similar to ours not so much lately I think they've been challenged because I think the hosts are starting to kind of go their own ways but when they're together it's a good time and John does his best to keep it together I listen to Horde House

1912
02:13:52,105 --> 02:13:57,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Horde House, no comment right now, but there's going to be some things changing, I think.

1913
02:13:59,550 --> 02:14:00,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1914
02:14:00,651 --> 02:14:02,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Other video game podcasts.

1915
02:14:02,151 --> 02:14:03,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, Bobby Blackwolf.

1916
02:14:03,452 --> 02:14:04,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.

1917
02:14:04,333 --> 02:14:04,993
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just a given.

1918
02:14:05,994 --> 02:14:06,554
[SPEAKER_05]: We like him.

1919
02:14:06,895 --> 02:14:09,656
[SPEAKER_05]: But he hasn't updated his podcast feed in a while, naughty boy.

1920
02:14:10,597 --> 02:14:13,539
[SPEAKER_05]: So even if I told you to listen to him, you couldn't get his newest shows.

1921
02:14:15,440 --> 02:14:17,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Stuff that's off the All Games Network.

1922
02:14:17,422 --> 02:14:21,465
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not a lot of video game podcasts that I've actually... See, here's the thing.

1923
02:14:22,045 --> 02:14:24,567
[SPEAKER_05]: I've tried to listen to others, and I don't like them.

1924
02:14:24,668 --> 02:14:25,508
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't want to name them.

1925
02:14:25,588 --> 02:14:32,454
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's one in particular I really try to listen to, and I just... And it's an independent show, so I really want to support other independent shows.

1926
02:14:32,874 --> 02:14:33,494
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'll say it's...

1927
02:14:35,076 --> 02:14:44,105
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a very slickly produced independent show, and the person behind it does a lot of podcasts on iTunes, but I just wasn't into it.

1928
02:14:44,505 --> 02:14:54,095
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a video podcast, but I guess that wouldn't really work, but I like occasionally watching episodes of the Ben Heck Show.

1929
02:14:54,725 --> 02:14:58,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'll throw on some of the video game YouTube ones.

1930
02:14:58,988 --> 02:15:06,212
[SPEAKER_09]: When I was at work, I would check out the Angry Video Game Nerd on my phone just by plugging in on YouTube.

1931
02:15:07,213 --> 02:15:09,114
[SPEAKER_09]: And I like Classic Game Room.

1932
02:15:09,734 --> 02:15:10,535
[SPEAKER_09]: That was one of my favorites.

1933
02:15:10,655 --> 02:15:12,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me give a shout out to a few that I'm subscribed to.

1934
02:15:13,016 --> 02:15:16,038
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually whipped out my phone and I'm looking at some others that I'm subscribed to.

1935
02:15:16,659 --> 02:15:23,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, I subscribe to Under Sedation Live, which is sci-fi and stuff.

1936
02:15:23,203 --> 02:15:25,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Travis, that's the show I started on.

1937
02:15:25,604 --> 02:15:26,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Our own Ranma has a podcast.

1938
02:15:27,265 --> 02:15:29,146
[SPEAKER_05]: of course, Anime Jam Session if you're into that.

1939
02:15:29,667 --> 02:15:30,447
[SPEAKER_05]: PodCulture.

1940
02:15:30,787 --> 02:15:35,010
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to give a shout out to my buddy Brad over at PodCulture if you like the sci-fi geeky stuff.

1941
02:15:35,410 --> 02:15:36,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me put it this way.

1942
02:15:37,011 --> 02:15:39,973
[SPEAKER_05]: The TARDIS shows up like in nine-tenths of the artwork.

1943
02:15:40,053 --> 02:15:42,715
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, if you're a Doctor Who fan, you're going to love PodCulture.

1944
02:15:42,735 --> 02:15:44,396
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple people are saying the BombCast.

1945
02:15:46,268 --> 02:15:47,569
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't tried that one myself.

1946
02:15:47,689 --> 02:15:49,849
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of folks are big fans of Giant Bomb, though.

1947
02:15:51,190 --> 02:15:54,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I really love Smartest Man in the World by Greg Proops.

1948
02:15:55,171 --> 02:15:55,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1949
02:15:55,531 --> 02:16:01,893
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're not into swearing, I think it's still really funny, but just warning you.

1950
02:16:02,073 --> 02:16:05,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's two that I listen to, and they're both from...

1951
02:16:07,995 --> 02:16:11,857
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to have to look it up again, but one of them is Stuff Mom Never Told You.

1952
02:16:13,317 --> 02:16:16,798
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really just interesting tidbits, things that you might not know.

1953
02:16:17,378 --> 02:16:22,040
[SPEAKER_09]: And the other one is from How Stuff Works.

1954
02:16:23,020 --> 02:16:27,382
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of them is Things You Never Learned in History Class.

1955
02:16:29,110 --> 02:16:30,691
[SPEAKER_05]: and two others I want to name real quick here.

1956
02:16:31,071 --> 02:16:33,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, Girls Gone Wow, the lovely sill out of the UK.

1957
02:16:34,392 --> 02:16:37,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Since there is, you know, Horde House is on a Horde hiatus right now.

1958
02:16:37,993 --> 02:16:39,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Girls Gone Wow is a great place to get your fix.

1959
02:16:40,514 --> 02:16:41,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Girl on Guy with Aisha Tyler.

1960
02:16:42,555 --> 02:16:43,835
[SPEAKER_05]: But see, I love Aisha Tyler.

1961
02:16:43,955 --> 02:16:49,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, I'm totally gay, but Aisha Tyler, she's pretty hot and she's really intelligent and a total geek.

1962
02:16:50,758 --> 02:16:51,498
[SPEAKER_05]: I've met her before.

1963
02:16:51,898 --> 02:16:52,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you really?

1964
02:16:52,458 --> 02:16:52,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1965
02:16:52,939 --> 02:16:53,479
[SPEAKER_05]: What'd you think of her?

1966
02:16:53,939 --> 02:16:54,840
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1967
02:17:17,540 --> 02:17:21,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, Podcat.

1968
02:17:21,282 --> 02:17:21,942
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good idea.

1969
02:17:22,942 --> 02:17:23,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1970
02:17:24,383 --> 02:17:24,783
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1971
02:17:24,823 --> 02:17:26,344
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we've given you plenty of suggestions.

1972
02:17:27,544 --> 02:17:28,945
[SPEAKER_05]: We could probably name a million more.

1973
02:17:30,285 --> 02:17:32,366
[SPEAKER_05]: The ones I named were off my personal iPod.

1974
02:17:32,406 --> 02:17:33,426
[SPEAKER_05]: I do listen to all those shows.

1975
02:17:33,446 --> 02:17:34,527
[SPEAKER_09]: There's one other that I listen to.

1976
02:17:34,547 --> 02:17:37,088
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a video game, but you know me and my history love.

1977
02:17:37,688 --> 02:17:47,716
[SPEAKER_09]: There is History of the World Through 100 Objects that's put out by the BBC and the Museum of History in London.

1978
02:17:48,797 --> 02:17:52,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, if you like history, that one's a really freaking good one.

1979
02:17:53,061 --> 02:17:56,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though the guy sounds a little too posh for my taste.

1980
02:17:57,324 --> 02:17:58,645
[SPEAKER_09]: But other than that, it's a really good one.

1981
02:17:59,706 --> 02:18:04,130
[SPEAKER_09]: You know me, I listen to all of the informational ones and the...

1982
02:18:07,655 --> 02:18:11,157
[SPEAKER_09]: stuff that's going to teach you something that in video game ones.

1983
02:18:13,698 --> 02:18:14,459
[SPEAKER_09]: But hopefully this helped.

1984
02:18:14,499 --> 02:18:15,339
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was the last email.

1985
02:18:16,840 --> 02:18:17,180
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1986
02:18:18,681 --> 02:18:22,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, let's move on past the mailbag.

1987
02:18:22,383 --> 02:18:24,064
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the part of the show where we get angsty.

1988
02:18:25,024 --> 02:18:29,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes we get a little bit angry here at Orange Lounge Radio and we do a segment called the FUs of the Week.

1989
02:18:29,727 --> 02:18:30,127
[SPEAKER_05]: So here it is.

1990
02:18:46,628 --> 02:18:51,953
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to the increased cost of tuition and people who only want you to have a bachelor's degree.

1991
02:18:53,875 --> 02:19:02,823
[SPEAKER_09]: And F you to all the morons driving with their lights off in the rain and not signaling in the rain.

1992
02:19:04,465 --> 02:19:04,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Stupid.

1993
02:19:05,385 --> 02:19:07,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Not signaling in the rain.

1994
02:19:07,808 --> 02:19:09,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Signaling in the rain.

1995
02:19:09,309 --> 02:19:10,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, you're F yous.

1996
02:19:10,946 --> 02:19:11,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so my F.U.

1997
02:19:11,927 --> 02:19:19,411
[SPEAKER_06]: goes to Jack in the Box for pushing this milkshake that has no bacon in it.

1998
02:19:19,711 --> 02:19:22,333
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously, I mean, come on.

1999
02:19:23,193 --> 02:19:27,215
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't even put like a little, you can't sprinkle a little bit of bacon bits on top.

2000
02:19:27,615 --> 02:19:29,757
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, because it is a bacon milkshake.

2001
02:19:30,717 --> 02:19:31,478
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know...

2002
02:19:32,972 --> 02:19:33,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

2003
02:19:34,575 --> 02:19:35,396
[SPEAKER_06]: It is what it is.

2004
02:19:35,596 --> 02:19:36,738
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I'll have to make my own.

2005
02:19:38,040 --> 02:19:41,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Baking ice cream wasn't bad, so baking milkshake could work.

2006
02:19:43,328 --> 02:19:44,129
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I'll do that.

2007
02:19:46,564 --> 02:19:48,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft in our chat goes, blame it on the rain.

2008
02:19:48,325 --> 02:19:52,127
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was in response to your FU, DarkSakura, who just head-desked.

2009
02:20:18,212 --> 02:20:19,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, you okay, DarkSakura?

2010
02:20:22,652 --> 02:20:23,412
[SPEAKER_05]: My FU of the week.

2011
02:20:23,472 --> 02:20:24,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, where's the FU music?

2012
02:20:26,393 --> 02:20:27,073
[SPEAKER_05]: My FU of the week.

2013
02:20:27,233 --> 02:20:28,073
[SPEAKER_05]: FU to that noise.

2014
02:20:28,573 --> 02:20:29,914
[SPEAKER_05]: After all these years, I still hate that.

2015
02:20:29,994 --> 02:20:30,994
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so old!

2016
02:20:31,274 --> 02:20:32,714
[SPEAKER_05]: No one saw the grudge.

2017
02:20:33,215 --> 02:20:34,675
[SPEAKER_09]: You said dead.

2018
02:20:34,735 --> 02:20:35,515
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people saw it.

2019
02:20:35,755 --> 02:20:38,996
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet we're getting to the point now where people were born after that movie.

2020
02:20:39,056 --> 02:20:41,236
[SPEAKER_06]: No one's going to know what you're talking about.

2021
02:20:41,256 --> 02:20:42,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Why does she sound like a creaking door?

2022
02:20:42,777 --> 02:20:43,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get it.

2023
02:20:45,077 --> 02:20:48,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not distract from my real FU of the week because this is serious business.

2024
02:20:49,398 --> 02:20:52,125
[SPEAKER_05]: My FU of the week goes to Parking Lots

2025
02:20:53,732 --> 02:20:55,493
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate them so much.

2026
02:20:55,593 --> 02:20:59,256
[SPEAKER_05]: No, dude, dude, dude, dude.

2027
02:20:59,496 --> 02:21:04,400
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to the mall, Arden Fair, 2 o'clock yesterday, Saturday.

2028
02:21:04,960 --> 02:21:07,182
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the dumbest thing I could have ever done in my life.

2029
02:21:07,642 --> 02:21:09,884
[SPEAKER_05]: That mall was more crowded than it is on Christmas.

2030
02:21:09,924 --> 02:21:11,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, what is that, Black Friday?

2031
02:21:11,185 --> 02:21:12,686
[SPEAKER_05]: It was more crowded than it was on Black Friday.

2032
02:21:12,786 --> 02:21:16,909
[SPEAKER_05]: And just stupid people jumping in front of cars, driving slowly.

2033
02:21:16,989 --> 02:21:21,693
[SPEAKER_05]: It got to the point we drove around the parking lot twice, couldn't find a place to park.

2034
02:21:22,293 --> 02:21:25,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Went up to the second floor of the parking structure where nobody ever parks.

2035
02:21:25,737 --> 02:21:29,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Every space up there was taken, and I said, fuck it, and went home.

2036
02:21:29,500 --> 02:21:30,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Park across the street.

2037
02:21:31,302 --> 02:21:32,163
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I used to do.

2038
02:21:32,183 --> 02:21:33,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, you park at Hooters?

2039
02:21:33,644 --> 02:21:36,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, in that lot where nobody, there's like fucking nothing there now, huh?

2040
02:21:36,987 --> 02:21:37,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

2041
02:21:37,328 --> 02:21:40,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Where they used to have the nightclub closed.

2042
02:21:40,130 --> 02:21:40,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

2043
02:21:40,651 --> 02:21:44,695
[SPEAKER_06]: You used to park across the street right there next to the sidewalk, hit the crosswalk.

2044
02:21:44,995 --> 02:21:50,139
[SPEAKER_06]: By the time you cross the street and stuff, seriously, I used to go to Virgin over there.

2045
02:21:50,199 --> 02:21:51,220
[SPEAKER_06]: It was awesome.

2046
02:21:51,240 --> 02:21:52,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I remember Virgin Megastore.

2047
02:21:52,762 --> 02:21:54,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's sad.

2048
02:21:54,363 --> 02:21:55,404
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Urban Outfitters now.

2049
02:21:55,684 --> 02:21:56,104
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all right.

2050
02:21:56,204 --> 02:21:56,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Urban Outfitters.

2051
02:21:56,945 --> 02:21:57,786
[SPEAKER_05]: I like some of their shirts.

2052
02:21:59,147 --> 02:22:00,068
[SPEAKER_05]: They sell Michelle's book.

2053
02:22:00,168 --> 02:22:03,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know what I bought at that Virgin?

2054
02:22:03,651 --> 02:22:03,851
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

2055
02:22:04,251 --> 02:22:05,012
[SPEAKER_09]: My activator.

2056
02:22:05,931 --> 02:22:06,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

2057
02:22:06,272 --> 02:22:10,697
[SPEAKER_09]: For the Genesis with... Oh, what was that game?

2058
02:22:10,737 --> 02:22:12,418
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to get import CDs at Virgin.

2059
02:22:13,340 --> 02:22:14,441
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I would go there for.

2060
02:22:15,482 --> 02:22:16,023
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anyhow.

2061
02:22:16,543 --> 02:22:17,464
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the internet.

2062
02:22:17,905 --> 02:22:18,706
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on.

2063
02:22:18,766 --> 02:22:21,028
[SPEAKER_05]: More news and Skypline coming up very soon.

2064
02:22:21,128 --> 02:22:22,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter topics as well.

2065
02:22:22,470 --> 02:22:24,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Tons of fun stuff coming up very, very, very, very soon.

2066
02:22:24,853 --> 02:22:25,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

2067
02:22:25,313 --> 02:22:29,657
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, fuck you to your parking lot too, because I have to park in the middle of nowhere.

2068
02:22:29,677 --> 02:22:32,719
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to hike back to my car if I remember where it is.

2069
02:22:33,280 --> 02:22:36,263
[SPEAKER_06]: So Call of Duty Elite, it's pretty popular for...

2070
02:22:38,050 --> 02:22:38,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Activision.

2071
02:22:38,691 --> 02:22:42,693
[SPEAKER_06]: They have 7 million users using the Elite service.

2072
02:22:44,375 --> 02:22:54,141
[SPEAKER_06]: 1.5 million have actually paid the $60 for, or $50 I think it is, for all the free, well, the paid for the download content.

2073
02:22:54,722 --> 02:22:58,424
[SPEAKER_06]: So $50 times 100, or 1.5 million times.

2074
02:22:58,464 --> 02:23:00,906
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot of fucking money.

2075
02:23:00,926 --> 02:23:01,847
[SPEAKER_06]: $75 million.

2076
02:23:03,748 --> 02:23:06,390
[SPEAKER_05]: And people thought, who would want to sign up for this service?

2077
02:23:06,994 --> 02:23:12,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, to be honest, if you're going to pay for the download content, you're actually saving money with that service.

2078
02:23:12,576 --> 02:23:15,218
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you play a lot of Call of Duty, that might be worth it to you.

2079
02:23:16,098 --> 02:23:17,359
[SPEAKER_06]: And the maps don't look bad.

2080
02:23:17,699 --> 02:23:21,821
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't play Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, so I don't use the service at all.

2081
02:23:21,841 --> 02:23:26,423
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think it ties in with Modern Warfare, so the first one.

2082
02:23:30,544 --> 02:23:31,865
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

2083
02:23:32,125 --> 02:23:33,326
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like it's doing well for them.

2084
02:23:33,346 --> 02:23:34,066
[SPEAKER_06]: They made lots of money.

2085
02:23:34,506 --> 02:23:36,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they going to do another one of those expos this year?

2086
02:23:37,299 --> 02:23:37,539
[SPEAKER_05]: They might.

2087
02:23:37,559 --> 02:23:37,860
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2088
02:23:52,751 --> 02:23:58,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I could see them doing that, because it worked out pretty well for them.

2089
02:23:59,636 --> 02:24:02,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, there's going to be another Call of Duty.

2090
02:24:02,077 --> 02:24:04,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they announced that they're going to make another Call of Duty game.

2091
02:24:04,799 --> 02:24:09,942
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't even have to put that in the fucking... You do not have to announce that at all, that it was part of their...

2092
02:24:13,038 --> 02:24:16,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Their financial report or something like that that they're making a new Call of Duty game.

2093
02:24:16,122 --> 02:24:18,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course they're going to fucking make a new Call of Duty game.

2094
02:24:18,524 --> 02:24:21,287
[SPEAKER_06]: It's news when they say we're not making a Call of Duty game.

2095
02:24:21,427 --> 02:24:22,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Or we're not having a BlizzCon.

2096
02:24:23,249 --> 02:24:26,713
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just, you know, you don't even need to report that.

2097
02:24:26,753 --> 02:24:29,857
[SPEAKER_06]: People just make the assumption that there's going to be a new Call of Duty game coming out.

2098
02:24:30,464 --> 02:24:41,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of that Activision Blizzard earnings call that happened this week, very surprising that they announced there's no release date still for Diablo 3, which we thought for sure we'd have that by the end of next month, but now it's looking like, nope, maybe summertime.

2099
02:24:41,953 --> 02:24:43,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Q2 is what they're saying.

2100
02:24:43,394 --> 02:24:45,175
[SPEAKER_06]: StarCraft... No, I'm in the beta.

2101
02:24:45,195 --> 02:24:45,656
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great.

2102
02:24:50,785 --> 02:24:52,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then they just hate you.

2103
02:24:53,366 --> 02:24:53,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Clearly.

2104
02:24:54,186 --> 02:25:00,088
[SPEAKER_06]: StarCraft launched at the end of July, so that was kind of an odd time for it.

2105
02:25:00,848 --> 02:25:04,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no date.

2106
02:25:04,909 --> 02:25:07,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, speaking of Diablo 3, my next story happens to be about Diablo 3.

2107
02:25:08,270 --> 02:25:14,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Bashyak, who's the community manager over at Blizzard, was answering some questions, and it wasn't about Warcraft this time.

2108
02:25:14,992 --> 02:25:15,952
[SPEAKER_05]: It was about Diablo 3.

2109
02:25:16,832 --> 02:25:18,773
[SPEAKER_05]: They say Diablo 3 is still slated for 2012.

2110
02:25:20,173 --> 02:25:37,900
[SPEAKER_05]: but now they're saying that Diablo 3 is only going to support up to four players even though there is five classes now that's four player co-op they haven't said anything about a five player mode in the game Bashok said that Blizzard is not looking into it and they're not going to expand their player cap no idea as to why they did that

2111
02:25:39,280 --> 02:25:50,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting because in World of Warcraft you have, if I'm not mistaken, you have 10 classes and raids are 10 people or 25 or, you know, but most, you know, the end game content is geared towards that.

2112
02:25:50,482 --> 02:25:54,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Although you would find very, very, very few raid groups that have one of each class.

2113
02:25:55,303 --> 02:25:55,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Very few.

2114
02:25:56,583 --> 02:25:59,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Diablo 3 also will not have built-in voice chat at launch.

2115
02:26:00,824 --> 02:26:03,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Blizzard wants to make sure that the voice chat is going to be worth it.

2116
02:26:04,025 --> 02:26:05,265
[SPEAKER_05]: The WoW voice chat

2117
02:26:05,885 --> 02:26:07,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3

2118
02:26:25,365 --> 02:26:26,867
[SPEAKER_05]: I still thought the game looked good enough.

2119
02:26:28,368 --> 02:26:33,153
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, it looked great on the beta, so I don't think they necessarily need to make it that much better.

2120
02:26:33,173 --> 02:26:39,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, part of the charm of Diablo is that you'll be able to be played on a variety of systems if you want to be able to find four people to co-op with.

2121
02:26:40,019 --> 02:26:42,341
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still really looking forward to Diablo 3 despite all this.

2122
02:26:42,782 --> 02:26:44,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wish it would come out already.

2123
02:26:44,623 --> 02:26:49,228
[SPEAKER_05]: I get a free copy because I signed the Blizzard Blood Pact for World of Warcraft because I have problems.

2124
02:26:51,533 --> 02:26:52,153
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

2125
02:27:11,224 --> 02:27:13,025
[SPEAKER_09]: But Hanna-Barbera put it out well.

2126
02:27:13,366 --> 02:27:15,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Their first season's coming out on DVD.

2127
02:27:16,167 --> 02:27:18,749
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a two-disc, 13-episode collection.

2128
02:27:19,209 --> 02:27:21,991
[SPEAKER_09]: It has Inky, Blinky, Pinky, Clyde, and Sue.

2129
02:27:22,972 --> 02:27:26,534
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mesmeron, who wants to take over Pac-Land.

2130
02:27:27,775 --> 02:27:29,636
[SPEAKER_09]: And has Vampire Pacula.

2131
02:27:30,917 --> 02:27:33,759
[SPEAKER_09]: And all kinds of, yeah.

2132
02:27:33,819 --> 02:27:35,340
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot about Pac-Land.

2133
02:27:35,380 --> 02:27:37,281
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a really interesting game.

2134
02:27:37,301 --> 02:27:39,082
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of like a side-scroller Pac-Man.

2135
02:27:39,323 --> 02:27:39,743
[SPEAKER_09]: I have it.

2136
02:27:41,363 --> 02:27:45,945
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in those Namco collections like the ones that tend to come out on every system.

2137
02:27:47,545 --> 02:27:51,126
[SPEAKER_09]: I also remember the Christmas special where Santa came down and they had no idea what a human was.

2138
02:27:53,287 --> 02:27:53,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2139
02:27:54,307 --> 02:27:54,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

2140
02:27:55,887 --> 02:28:00,389
[SPEAKER_05]: I had the Pac-Man board game growing up and it had like a million marbles.

2141
02:28:00,669 --> 02:28:02,809
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all these fucking marbles that were little pellets.

2142
02:28:03,409 --> 02:28:04,130
[SPEAKER_05]: I had the bed sheets.

2143
02:28:04,950 --> 02:28:05,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

2144
02:28:05,726 --> 02:28:07,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Pac-Man Super Pac-Man

2145
02:28:22,846 --> 02:28:25,227
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always great when you start off the story with a sigh.

2146
02:28:27,288 --> 02:28:32,649
[SPEAKER_06]: It should not be a surprise that they're making another Skylanders game.

2147
02:28:34,389 --> 02:28:36,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't you say this game was going to tank?

2148
02:28:36,890 --> 02:28:38,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it should have tanked.

2149
02:28:39,171 --> 02:28:42,891
[SPEAKER_06]: I underestimated how stupid the average consumer is.

2150
02:28:43,292 --> 02:28:44,232
[SPEAKER_06]: My mistake.

2151
02:28:45,112 --> 02:28:45,773
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?

2152
02:28:46,253 --> 02:28:48,455
[SPEAKER_06]: If you bought this game, you have yourself to blame.

2153
02:28:48,635 --> 02:28:50,997
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why you're going to get fucking expensive.

2154
02:28:51,357 --> 02:28:58,363
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not want to hear another fucking thing about, oh, those map packs for Call of Duty are too expensive.

2155
02:28:59,023 --> 02:29:01,765
[SPEAKER_06]: This is your fucking fault for buying Skylanders.

2156
02:29:02,446 --> 02:29:03,106
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why.

2157
02:29:03,406 --> 02:29:07,049
[SPEAKER_06]: No more can you complain about DLC costs or the quantity.

2158
02:29:08,211 --> 02:29:10,632
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, Skylanders, Giants.

2159
02:29:11,332 --> 02:29:13,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Because hey, how can we make Skylanders better?

2160
02:29:13,794 --> 02:29:14,274
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know!

2161
02:29:14,294 --> 02:29:17,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's make larger figures that we can charge more for.

2162
02:29:17,896 --> 02:29:18,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like a plan.

2163
02:29:18,936 --> 02:29:19,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Bigger is better.

2164
02:29:20,197 --> 02:29:23,478
[SPEAKER_06]: People will buy them because they're consumer whores.

2165
02:29:23,958 --> 02:29:24,499
[SPEAKER_06]: And how.

2166
02:29:25,759 --> 02:29:53,874
[SPEAKER_06]: so yes Skylanders Giants will be coming out later this year I think also for the Wii U probably at some point and I gotta be honest by looking at the screenshots which this game itself kinda looks like it could have been on the Gamecube or the Playstation 2 I mean pretty cheap I've heard good things about the game itself just the game not all this extra crap but the game itself I've heard decent things about it it's a decent dungeon crawler

2167
02:29:54,954 --> 02:29:55,955
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks pretty cheap.

2168
02:29:56,235 --> 02:29:58,877
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't go off books though.

2169
02:29:58,957 --> 02:30:03,419
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing they're changing is they're adding these giant fucking characters that do stuff.

2170
02:30:03,860 --> 02:30:05,221
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're going to cost more money.

2171
02:30:05,461 --> 02:30:06,241
[SPEAKER_06]: But hey, guess what?

2172
02:30:06,401 --> 02:30:08,803
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going to force you to buy another goddamn portal.

2173
02:30:08,883 --> 02:30:10,284
[SPEAKER_06]: You can still use your old portal.

2174
02:30:10,504 --> 02:30:13,145
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's going to be twice as many SKUs I've got to fucking set up.

2175
02:30:14,566 --> 02:30:33,718
[SPEAKER_06]: thank god for that uh and it's so we're gonna have these giant fucking portal characters that you have to use with your regular Skylanders characters and I'm sure they're gonna have more characters to go along with that and yeah so that's fantastic and I want to say they were the number one accessory item for games this month so

2176
02:30:34,418 --> 02:30:40,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Congrats to you, Skylanders, for selling a lot.

2177
02:30:40,604 --> 02:30:48,172
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, there's going to be some Toys R Us exclusive items because they have signed a fucking blood pact with Activision to pimp these to children.

2178
02:30:50,133 --> 02:30:57,681
[SPEAKER_06]: So, once again, I hope you're happy because you folks that purchased Skylanders are going to be the downfall of the gaming industry.

2179
02:30:58,920 --> 02:31:00,822
[SPEAKER_05]: When an inevitable video game crash happens.

2180
02:31:00,842 --> 02:31:04,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, by the way, there's big rumblings that we're headed towards another video game crash.

2181
02:31:04,645 --> 02:31:05,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Because think about it.

2182
02:31:05,306 --> 02:31:09,370
[SPEAKER_05]: If the Wii U and the Vita don't do very well, it could lead to another crash.

2183
02:31:10,331 --> 02:31:15,717
[SPEAKER_06]: If the Wii U and the Vita don't do well, people are just going to have to buy games for the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.

2184
02:31:15,917 --> 02:31:16,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the world will end.

2185
02:31:17,679 --> 02:31:18,199
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

2186
02:31:18,239 --> 02:31:18,540
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just...

2187
02:31:19,020 --> 02:31:23,703
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think anything could ever happen to the extent that it happened with Atari.

2188
02:31:24,183 --> 02:31:28,466
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you look at the sales, dude, sales this January were way down compared to a year ago.

2189
02:31:29,537 --> 02:31:31,038
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing coming out in January.

2190
02:31:31,218 --> 02:31:32,058
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not surprised.

2191
02:31:33,238 --> 02:31:38,180
[SPEAKER_06]: They had one week of sales because all the game releases for January came out the last week.

2192
02:31:38,200 --> 02:31:40,881
[SPEAKER_05]: You still have holdovers and people using their gift cards and all that stuff?

2193
02:31:40,901 --> 02:31:46,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but see, normally January, like last year January, they had Darksiders, which came out like in the first week.

2194
02:31:46,403 --> 02:31:47,404
[SPEAKER_06]: They had Bayonetta.

2195
02:31:48,584 --> 02:31:50,945
[SPEAKER_06]: They had... Actually, Bayonetta might have been the year before.

2196
02:31:50,965 --> 02:31:53,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, I think... I think Bayonetta was the year before.

2197
02:31:53,966 --> 02:31:57,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, one of these Januaries, they had Darksiders and Bayonetta.

2198
02:31:58,868 --> 02:31:59,048
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

2199
02:32:00,694 --> 02:32:01,654
[SPEAKER_06]: What else do they have?

2200
02:32:02,254 --> 02:32:05,516
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Alan was saying to me the other day, why haven't they announced a sequel to Bayonetta yet?

2201
02:32:06,436 --> 02:32:07,336
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a very good question.

2202
02:32:07,356 --> 02:32:08,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it tanked?

2203
02:32:09,537 --> 02:32:09,937
[SPEAKER_05]: It did?

2204
02:32:09,957 --> 02:32:11,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God, I love Bayonetta.

2205
02:32:11,097 --> 02:32:11,637
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't do well.

2206
02:32:11,657 --> 02:32:15,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then, of course, there's that whole Metal Gear game that now is basically Metal Gear Bayonetta.

2207
02:32:16,699 --> 02:32:17,559
[SPEAKER_05]: The Metal Gear game.

2208
02:32:17,619 --> 02:32:18,720
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll come out eventually.

2209
02:32:19,160 --> 02:32:20,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they rebooted it.

2210
02:32:20,920 --> 02:32:22,861
[SPEAKER_06]: They totally rebooted it.

2211
02:32:24,555 --> 02:32:26,037
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yes, Skylander Giants.

2212
02:32:26,637 --> 02:32:27,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Hip, hip, hooray.

2213
02:32:36,133 --> 02:32:39,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I got to interrupt real quick here.

2214
02:32:39,775 --> 02:32:43,576
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, remember how I was saying that they're going to have some exclusive stuff?

2215
02:32:44,056 --> 02:32:49,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the characters they've run out of, you know, they have the legendary characters which sell for a lot more on eBay.

2216
02:32:49,099 --> 02:32:50,319
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how you know how they're special.

2217
02:32:50,919 --> 02:32:54,601
[SPEAKER_06]: And also they have now iridescent blue characters.

2218
02:32:54,701 --> 02:32:57,602
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're like, we're not even going to paint this one.

2219
02:32:57,622 --> 02:33:01,424
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just going to make it clear plastic and people will spend more money for it.

2220
02:33:05,410 --> 02:33:15,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I got one more story for you guys, then we're going to get to the Skyplane and your Twitter topics, so just a reminder, here's your last chance to get those Twitter topics in at twitter.com slash OLR

2221
02:33:18,038 --> 02:33:20,679
[SPEAKER_05]: This story is about another sigh.

2222
02:33:21,360 --> 02:33:22,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Huge sigh.

2223
02:33:23,321 --> 02:33:23,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Ubisoft.

2224
02:33:25,282 --> 02:33:26,142
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't with this.

2225
02:33:26,223 --> 02:33:27,583
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the whole DRM thing.

2226
02:33:28,264 --> 02:33:37,429
[SPEAKER_05]: And they've gotten a lot of shit about this whole... I thought that Ubisoft got rid of this DRM when people started being up in arms about it.

2227
02:33:37,449 --> 02:33:39,110
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess that was just moving forward.

2228
02:33:39,590 --> 02:33:44,753
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I'm talking about is the whole, you have to be online to play the game, and if you get kicked offline, you get kicked out of the game.

2229
02:33:45,600 --> 02:33:46,681
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com.

2230
02:34:07,293 --> 02:34:12,055
[SPEAKER_05]: and so forth was unable to be signed into.

2231
02:34:12,416 --> 02:34:16,838
[SPEAKER_05]: However, Driver San Francisco was not one of the games that Ubisoft originally said you will not be able to play.

2232
02:34:17,418 --> 02:34:21,781
[SPEAKER_05]: So extra games got taken down on top of what Ubisoft originally said.

2233
02:34:22,501 --> 02:34:26,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Some games were still okay, like Just Dance 3 and Settlers Online.

2234
02:34:26,704 --> 02:34:29,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Via Twitter, Ubisoft says, We apologize for the inconvenience.

2235
02:34:29,765 --> 02:34:33,567
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems some of you can't connect to games announced as playable during migration.

2236
02:34:33,948 --> 02:34:35,849
[SPEAKER_05]: We're on it and will keep you posted here.

2237
02:34:36,389 --> 02:34:39,751
[SPEAKER_05]: In related news, those that pirated these games experience no issues.

2238
02:34:43,755 --> 02:34:47,756
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think Just Dance would be part of it because that's not a PC game.

2239
02:34:47,796 --> 02:34:49,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was after the fact too.

2240
02:34:49,957 --> 02:34:51,117
[SPEAKER_09]: No one gets to wiggle their butt.

2241
02:34:51,217 --> 02:34:52,898
[SPEAKER_05]: How about Assassin's Creed Revelations?

2242
02:34:52,938 --> 02:34:53,378
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

2243
02:34:53,938 --> 02:34:55,099
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's only PC titles.

2244
02:34:55,679 --> 02:34:56,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2245
02:34:59,020 --> 02:35:02,301
[SPEAKER_05]: But am I correct in saying Ubisoft does not do this anymore, right?

2246
02:35:03,381 --> 02:35:03,801
[SPEAKER_05]: They will.

2247
02:35:05,202 --> 02:35:05,722
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't care.

2248
02:35:07,102 --> 02:35:09,583
[SPEAKER_06]: You're still going to buy the next Assassin's Creed game, people.

2249
02:35:10,243 --> 02:35:12,044
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not going to remember that they even did this.

2250
02:35:13,058 --> 02:35:15,199
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not, but then again, I hadn't bought any of the others.

2251
02:35:15,419 --> 02:35:25,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anyone remember the snafu with the whole PlayStation Network where they forgot to calculate a date correctly or something like that and so it knocked everything offline for like a day?

2252
02:35:26,824 --> 02:35:27,684
[SPEAKER_06]: No one remembers that.

2253
02:35:30,105 --> 02:35:30,665
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

2254
02:35:31,086 --> 02:35:31,466
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

2255
02:35:31,526 --> 02:35:33,226
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember the big fuss people made about that.

2256
02:35:33,287 --> 02:35:35,708
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder how many people forgot about the PlayStation hack by now.

2257
02:35:36,368 --> 02:35:39,129
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure a lot of people have already forgotten about the whole PlayStation Network thing.

2258
02:35:41,980 --> 02:35:42,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2259
02:35:43,442 --> 02:35:45,944
[SPEAKER_05]: We are about ready to go to the Skype line.

2260
02:35:46,045 --> 02:35:46,845
[SPEAKER_05]: So go ahead.

2261
02:35:46,865 --> 02:35:52,391
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2262
02:35:52,452 --> 02:35:53,853
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to go to the Skype line.

2263
02:35:54,394 --> 02:35:55,455
[SPEAKER_05]: It's already lighting up.

2264
02:35:56,216 --> 02:35:57,757
[SPEAKER_05]: People are ready to call in and get through.

2265
02:35:58,318 --> 02:35:59,940
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's go to the phones right now.

2266
02:36:00,020 --> 02:36:01,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2267
02:36:01,181 --> 02:36:01,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2268
02:36:02,435 --> 02:36:03,616
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, this is Asuka, what's up?

2269
02:36:26,243 --> 02:36:28,726
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a good buddy Stan to thank for that.

2270
02:36:28,766 --> 02:36:31,649
[SPEAKER_00]: He introduced me to OLR and I'm loving it so far.

2271
02:36:31,749 --> 02:36:32,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you so much.

2272
02:36:32,470 --> 02:36:33,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Stan.

2273
02:36:33,591 --> 02:36:38,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, for those that don't know who you are, is there a place where folks may or may not have been seeing you this week?

2274
02:36:39,578 --> 02:36:45,524
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I actually appeared on the new season of The Tester on the PlayStation Network.

2275
02:36:46,705 --> 02:37:13,236
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe it guys after all this okay I I don't know if you know about some of our running jokes if Stan filled you in about the tester but when I originally gave my review on the tester season one way back when I talked about the tester and I actually said the tester is not bad like it's it's it's not like a great freaking show it's not like you know you're gonna be watching The Walking Dead or something but right as far as reality TV goes as far as a lot of the old g4 shows go I

2276
02:37:13,536 --> 02:37:14,757
[SPEAKER_05]: The tester is not bad.

2277
02:37:15,017 --> 02:37:22,024
[SPEAKER_05]: But as I'm talking about this, Jamie's cat, because we were doing the show at her house, Shermie, took a big dump all over the floor.

2278
02:37:23,845 --> 02:37:24,666
[SPEAKER_00]: She did.

2279
02:37:24,866 --> 02:37:26,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's Shermie's review.

2280
02:37:27,949 --> 02:37:39,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, it's quite fitting because for those that might have seen the first episode, a quadra monster got into some deep shit, literally, because she started talking about farting and shitting and...

2281
02:37:40,040 --> 02:37:42,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, what is up with this?

2282
02:37:42,342 --> 02:37:46,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I gotta say, I made a tweet right after I watched the first episode.

2283
02:37:46,966 --> 02:37:50,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, I love video games and I love trashy reality TV, so I'm not gonna lie.

2284
02:37:51,089 --> 02:37:52,470
[SPEAKER_05]: I did watch the tester, alright?

2285
02:37:52,510 --> 02:37:53,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Judge me all you want.

2286
02:37:53,351 --> 02:37:54,131
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't give a fuck.

2287
02:37:54,552 --> 02:37:57,434
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, it's not as bad as being on the tester, trust me.

2288
02:37:58,975 --> 02:37:59,515
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.

2289
02:38:02,620 --> 02:38:03,561
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2290
02:38:21,800 --> 02:38:22,461
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

2291
02:38:38,918 --> 02:38:39,258
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura.com

2292
02:39:06,226 --> 02:39:30,898
[SPEAKER_00]: which I did you should totally do it okay I'll do it for next year I applied on a little bit of a whim and I actually the reason I decided to go for the tester was way back when Sci-Fi did WCG Ultimate Gamer I said eh why not I'll try I made it to like the final 42 people and didn't make that show because apparently I wasn't like cool enough so screw them

2293
02:39:31,698 --> 02:39:34,461
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the tester started the application process for season 3.

2294
02:39:34,621 --> 02:39:35,922
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, eh, why not?

2295
02:39:36,443 --> 02:39:41,247
[SPEAKER_00]: Next thing I know, I'm getting a phone call saying, yeah, we're flying you out to Los Angeles and you're going to be on the tester.

2296
02:39:41,367 --> 02:39:42,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, oh, shit.

2297
02:39:43,069 --> 02:39:44,230
[SPEAKER_05]: You just got picked?

2298
02:39:44,390 --> 02:39:46,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, there wasn't a lot of screening and whittling down?

2299
02:39:47,213 --> 02:39:52,655
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, it's, the whole process starts in about, started about mid-August, I want to say.

2300
02:39:53,295 --> 02:39:55,295
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put up a profile really quickly.

2301
02:39:55,335 --> 02:39:58,796
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, you know, I need to think of what's going to get me noticed.

2302
02:39:58,976 --> 02:40:07,739
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured, okay, how many people are the combination of a chemist, plays roller derby, and has like a trophy level of 18?

2303
02:40:08,359 --> 02:40:08,999
[SPEAKER_00]: Not many.

2304
02:40:09,339 --> 02:40:10,740
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used that and then

2305
02:40:11,480 --> 02:40:16,728
[SPEAKER_00]: Within a day of putting that up, I had a producer calling me saying, hey, I want to do some interviews with you, check you out.

2306
02:40:16,768 --> 02:40:22,036
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Skype interview had to wait a month of no contact from them.

2307
02:40:22,858 --> 02:40:26,223
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden, mid-October, I get a call from the executive producer.

2308
02:40:27,537 --> 02:40:28,278
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.

2309
02:40:45,470 --> 02:40:49,594
[SPEAKER_05]: But I get the sense that the whole process of recording the show itself is really quick.

2310
02:40:49,734 --> 02:40:58,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, I know there's a lot of TV magic, but, you know, I could kind of tell that they're probably doing, like, multiple challenges in a day.

2311
02:40:58,602 --> 02:41:00,004
[SPEAKER_05]: No, actually, no.

2312
02:41:00,244 --> 02:41:00,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

2313
02:41:00,684 --> 02:41:00,924
[SPEAKER_05]: No?

2314
02:41:01,745 --> 02:41:04,788
[SPEAKER_00]: Every episode is literally one day of filming.

2315
02:41:05,228 --> 02:41:08,131
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's back to back to back to back about, like,

2316
02:41:08,456 --> 02:41:11,758
[SPEAKER_00]: 15-18 hours worth of filming crammed into one little half hour.

2317
02:41:11,958 --> 02:41:22,724
[SPEAKER_00]: So you lose a lot of awesomeness, but they try to keep the drama and, in my case, a picture of a cockroach trying to go ass-to-mouth to me, which was great.

2318
02:41:24,005 --> 02:41:30,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know Loki and DarkSakura don't watch the tester, this week, the challenge... Did you watch it?

2319
02:41:31,109 --> 02:41:32,410
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had a joke ready, too.

2320
02:41:33,110 --> 02:41:33,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically...

2321
02:41:34,551 --> 02:41:44,956
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like saying, be glad that they're just, you know, they're doing the analogy where it's, you know, you have to keep your head in a case of bugs, you know, because you're squashing bugs or whatever.

2322
02:41:45,196 --> 02:41:50,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank God you're not testing for Bethesda where you'd have to jump in a fucking swimming pool full of cockroaches.

2323
02:41:51,258 --> 02:41:56,841
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and the thing is, if you're testing for Bethesda, there would be no bugs because apparently they don't see them when they test them.

2324
02:41:57,481 --> 02:41:58,361
[SPEAKER_00]: They just leave them in the game.

2325
02:41:58,602 --> 02:42:03,684
[SPEAKER_05]: You know my honest to God reaction when I saw that on the show though, I said DarkSakura would have been first out.

2326
02:42:03,964 --> 02:42:04,124
[SPEAKER_05]: See,

2327
02:42:05,596 --> 02:42:07,338
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2328
02:42:23,556 --> 02:42:46,741
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's funny is, like, we have our, this one guy, JTitan, he's this big, rough and tough trash talk and, like, knows his shit, and then as soon as we find out it's the roaches, we go back into the loft as they're doing us, um, they're doing each person for the challenge one at a time, he starts freaking out back in the loft, like, screaming, I'm fucking doing this, I'm, no, I quit, I fucking quit, and

2329
02:42:47,481 --> 02:43:11,042
[SPEAKER_05]: he was probably one of the next last people to go and all of us are coming back oh it's fine you'll be fine he's almost starting to like shake from nervousness he's that terrified of bugs so that would have been me I would have been crying I would have been screaming I would have been threatening calls to my lawyer but then I would have just done it you know I would have been like all right just fucking get in the zone don't think about it don't think about it don't think I'm fucking thinking about it don't think about it

2330
02:43:11,598 --> 02:43:12,078
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura.com

2331
02:43:32,887 --> 02:43:33,428
[SPEAKER_00]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2332
02:43:48,602 --> 02:43:50,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember Joe's apartment.

2333
02:43:50,263 --> 02:43:50,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Singing roaches.

2334
02:43:51,643 --> 02:43:55,825
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there's probably tons you want to talk about, but of course I'm going to steer the conversation.

2335
02:43:57,065 --> 02:43:57,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Take over.

2336
02:43:58,026 --> 02:43:59,986
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt bad for the girl they sent home.

2337
02:44:00,787 --> 02:44:03,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I shouldn't ruin it for those that haven't watched it.

2338
02:44:03,187 --> 02:44:03,488
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad.

2339
02:44:04,068 --> 02:44:06,809
[SPEAKER_05]: The person that they sent home seemed...

2340
02:44:07,808 --> 02:44:08,669
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't agree with that.

2341
02:44:08,949 --> 02:44:11,831
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely disagree with sending the person that they sent home.

2342
02:44:12,511 --> 02:44:14,612
[SPEAKER_05]: That person seemed really nice to me.

2343
02:44:15,593 --> 02:44:22,577
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised that person's not listening to OLR because that seemed like the kind of person that I would be friends with for real.

2344
02:44:22,957 --> 02:44:23,918
[SPEAKER_05]: So I kind of felt bad for them.

2345
02:44:24,804 --> 02:44:29,006
[SPEAKER_00]: She was one of the coolest cats in the loft.

2346
02:44:29,026 --> 02:44:34,768
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing we noticed about her was she had this giant tail that she brought with.

2347
02:44:34,788 --> 02:44:36,489
[SPEAKER_00]: We were like, okay, you're awesome.

2348
02:44:37,209 --> 02:44:49,755
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, when we were getting into the vans to head to the loft for filming, she originally had on this Voltron t-shirt that they took away from her because you couldn't have copyrighted material that wasn't first-party Sony because wah-wah-wah, whatever.

2349
02:44:50,655 --> 02:44:52,316
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just looking at her going, I like her.

2350
02:44:52,936 --> 02:44:55,960
[SPEAKER_00]: So we spent a good hour just talking about Voltron.

2351
02:44:57,301 --> 02:44:58,963
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so sad to see her go.

2352
02:44:59,043 --> 02:45:02,346
[SPEAKER_00]: And considering it was either the person that...

2353
02:45:03,359 --> 02:45:07,302
[SPEAKER_00]: either wasn't memorable or a person that talked about shit the whole time.

2354
02:45:08,123 --> 02:45:11,105
[SPEAKER_00]: I would maybe send home the person that talked about shit, but that's just me.

2355
02:45:11,125 --> 02:45:12,506
[SPEAKER_05]: That's reality TV.

2356
02:45:12,606 --> 02:45:17,530
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of looking at it going, you know, it sounds like you are the real deal.

2357
02:45:17,570 --> 02:45:18,171
[SPEAKER_05]: You're legit.

2358
02:45:18,211 --> 02:45:19,311
[SPEAKER_05]: You're intentions.

2359
02:45:19,351 --> 02:45:20,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, am I correct?

2360
02:45:20,372 --> 02:45:22,054
[SPEAKER_05]: You really did want to work for Sony, right?

2361
02:45:22,374 --> 02:45:23,174
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.

2362
02:45:23,355 --> 02:45:23,935
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

2363
02:45:24,015 --> 02:45:31,321
[SPEAKER_00]: In a later episode, you'll see just how much I would have killed or did I get my dream job?

2364
02:45:31,361 --> 02:45:31,641
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like,

2365
02:45:32,452 --> 02:45:36,554
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really say which way it fell, but... Right, sure, no, I understand.

2366
02:45:36,754 --> 02:45:38,355
[SPEAKER_05]: And listeners, please do respect that.

2367
02:45:38,415 --> 02:45:41,537
[SPEAKER_05]: She's under contract, can't say if she wins or got told to sashay away.

2368
02:45:41,557 --> 02:45:42,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm gonna get sued.

2369
02:45:43,698 --> 02:45:45,159
[SPEAKER_00]: All five people that watch the show.

2370
02:45:45,719 --> 02:45:46,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, how...

2371
02:45:48,260 --> 02:45:49,681
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't know.

2372
02:45:50,181 --> 02:45:53,404
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of a joke that no one watches the tester, but yet here I am.

2373
02:45:54,004 --> 02:45:55,025
[SPEAKER_05]: I admit I watch it.

2374
02:45:55,165 --> 02:46:06,913
[SPEAKER_05]: And I gotta say, all joking aside, what they're doing there is interesting because it really is the only show right now that I can think of that's produced exclusively for a gaming console.

2375
02:46:06,933 --> 02:46:08,334
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have anything like it on Nintendo.

2376
02:46:08,654 --> 02:46:10,815
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have anything like it otherwise on Sony.

2377
02:46:11,055 --> 02:46:16,859
[SPEAKER_05]: You certainly don't have anything like it on Xbox, especially since 1 vs. 100 isn't around anymore, which was a different kind of thing anyway.

2378
02:46:17,340 --> 02:46:17,640
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

2379
02:46:20,341 --> 02:46:25,422
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, they originally did that WC Ultimate Gamer, but that kind of flopped after two seasons.

2380
02:46:25,962 --> 02:46:28,503
[SPEAKER_00]: But even then, it wasn't entirely Xbox.

2381
02:46:28,543 --> 02:46:32,524
[SPEAKER_00]: I think season two had some Wii crap in it that no one cared about.

2382
02:46:32,584 --> 02:46:41,906
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, when I tell people that it's exclusively on PlayStation Network, you can download the episodes on your computer via thetester.com or crackle.com.

2383
02:46:43,791 --> 02:46:50,697
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the fact that it's produced by Sony for Sony, promoting Sony, it's very unique in that sense.

2384
02:46:50,837 --> 02:46:52,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a question though, Rob.

2385
02:46:53,419 --> 02:47:01,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Since you mentioned Crackle.com, Crackle, they have the actual utility or the app on the 360, so could you watch a tester on the 360?

2386
02:47:02,126 --> 02:47:04,428
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually watch the tester on the 360.

2387
02:47:05,029 --> 02:47:05,909
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried it and

2388
02:47:06,770 --> 02:47:07,390
[SPEAKER_00]: It is possible.

2389
02:47:07,770 --> 02:47:10,312
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I kind of got a personal kickle out of that.

2390
02:47:10,852 --> 02:47:13,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Xenocor in our chatroom is, do you have to pay to see the tester?

2391
02:47:13,453 --> 02:47:14,653
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's a free show.

2392
02:47:14,673 --> 02:47:15,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely free.

2393
02:47:16,174 --> 02:47:16,514
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me.

2394
02:47:16,654 --> 02:47:17,815
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you want to pay to see the tester?

2395
02:47:19,896 --> 02:47:20,956
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that you're deprecating.

2396
02:47:21,516 --> 02:47:21,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2397
02:47:22,537 --> 02:47:26,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I know you can't tell me which way, but the way you talk about it sometimes makes me think it might not have won.

2398
02:47:29,960 --> 02:47:31,481
[SPEAKER_00]: Just looking at the first episode, they're...

2399
02:47:32,561 --> 02:47:46,805
[SPEAKER_00]: it's supposed to be a double elimination but it wasn't a little bit of a spoiler there but it was a single elimination and with who was clearly supposed to go home when he or she didn't that pissed me off like completely

2400
02:47:48,766 --> 02:47:50,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Bullshit what happened there.

2401
02:47:50,307 --> 02:48:05,799
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm getting the sense that maybe you're still kind of friends with some of these folks, like maybe the person we were talking about earlier who got kicked off before their time, but maybe not with others.

2402
02:48:05,839 --> 02:48:10,783
[SPEAKER_00]: She's actually going to a giant world cosplay competition, so good luck.

2403
02:48:11,750 --> 02:48:11,990
[SPEAKER_00]: to her.

2404
02:48:12,491 --> 02:48:14,693
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we have this secret tester.

2405
02:48:14,733 --> 02:48:26,343
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it the tester lounge on Facebook, as I call it, because Facebook is... But yeah, people from all three seasons, Brent Gokey's in it, Meredith, Adrian.

2406
02:48:27,183 --> 02:48:29,786
[SPEAKER_00]: Side note, Meredith knows her shit about games.

2407
02:48:29,966 --> 02:48:33,349
[SPEAKER_00]: It surprised all of us how much she knew about it, so that was awesome.

2408
02:48:33,389 --> 02:48:35,791
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we talk all the time.

2409
02:48:35,871 --> 02:48:37,612
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a matter of fact, once...

2410
02:48:38,693 --> 02:48:39,794
[SPEAKER_00]: The cast was announced.

2411
02:48:40,114 --> 02:48:42,535
[SPEAKER_00]: Moe Chocolate from season two reached out to all of us.

2412
02:48:42,575 --> 02:48:43,836
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, whoa, what's up?

2413
02:48:43,956 --> 02:48:44,216
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Moe.

2414
02:48:44,236 --> 02:48:44,836
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to meet you.

2415
02:48:44,876 --> 02:48:46,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's video chat on Skype.

2416
02:48:46,717 --> 02:48:51,520
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just going, oh my God, you're Moe Chocolate and you're talking to me?

2417
02:48:51,760 --> 02:48:52,300
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy crap.

2418
02:48:52,360 --> 02:48:54,321
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've become the best of friends since then.

2419
02:48:54,341 --> 02:48:56,522
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty cool.

2420
02:48:56,982 --> 02:48:58,023
[SPEAKER_05]: That is awesome.

2421
02:48:58,043 --> 02:49:05,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it sounds like at the end of the day, no matter what's happening on the show, good or bad, you had a good experience and you met a lot of great people out of it, sounds like.

2422
02:49:05,867 --> 02:49:06,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2423
02:49:06,900 --> 02:49:10,322
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god, it's something that I could never forget.

2424
02:49:10,362 --> 02:49:16,807
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I never thought I would be doing something like that ever, because I'm not the most outgoing person.

2425
02:49:16,847 --> 02:49:17,347
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a gamer.

2426
02:49:17,407 --> 02:49:18,228
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little bit shy.

2427
02:49:18,248 --> 02:49:19,549
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of a closet dweller.

2428
02:49:19,889 --> 02:49:24,672
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just blew my mind in terms of awesomeness.

2429
02:49:24,732 --> 02:49:29,435
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh my god, I look on the TV that I've muted, and it's Whitney Houston.

2430
02:49:29,935 --> 02:49:31,036
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate bringing her up.

2431
02:49:31,116 --> 02:49:32,697
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn it, I need to change channels.

2432
02:49:32,717 --> 02:49:32,978
[SPEAKER_00]: Changing!

2433
02:49:33,838 --> 02:49:34,378
[SPEAKER_00]: Changing!

2434
02:49:35,559 --> 02:49:50,246
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why people watch the tester to get away from CNN and the Whitney Houston that's it we need to hang out well I had to catch a predator on and then all of a sudden it became Whitney Houston I'm like I can't see the seg but let's turn on something

2435
02:49:50,946 --> 02:49:51,927
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2436
02:50:21,340 --> 02:50:21,680
[SPEAKER_05]: I did.

2437
02:50:22,300 --> 02:50:25,922
[SPEAKER_05]: I really did think that because you guys kind of strike me as having stuff in common.

2438
02:50:27,042 --> 02:50:29,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I'll do it next year if I don't have a job.

2439
02:50:33,164 --> 02:50:36,526
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a job or have had a job as a chemist.

2440
02:50:36,606 --> 02:50:40,667
[SPEAKER_00]: So they even asked me, would you be okay with giving up your current job?

2441
02:50:40,727 --> 02:50:45,169
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, hmm, work in a lab or work at Santa Monica.

2442
02:50:46,730 --> 02:50:49,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I would be okay with that.

2443
02:50:49,872 --> 02:50:53,674
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a designer, so I was like, I can do all of your booklets.

2444
02:50:54,755 --> 02:50:55,795
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good way to get your foot in the door.

2445
02:50:55,835 --> 02:51:04,601
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand the guy that won the very first season was only a tester for six months, and now he's in marketing or something.

2446
02:51:04,621 --> 02:51:12,325
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the reason the whole six months thing is what they don't tell you is it's for a six-month contract.

2447
02:51:14,226 --> 02:51:14,887
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so like...

2448
02:51:16,457 --> 02:51:16,797
[SPEAKER_00]: and DarkSakura.

2449
02:51:39,234 --> 02:51:40,495
[SPEAKER_00]: and the same thing for this season.

2450
02:51:40,515 --> 02:51:44,276
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the Santa Monica thing, six month contract and then the car is for two year lease.

2451
02:51:44,596 --> 02:51:46,357
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's see some enthusiasm.

2452
02:51:46,377 --> 02:51:48,037
[SPEAKER_00]: The car is a two year lease?

2453
02:51:49,058 --> 02:51:49,298
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

2454
02:51:50,858 --> 02:51:51,579
[SPEAKER_05]: So funny.

2455
02:51:53,839 --> 02:51:54,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

2456
02:51:54,179 --> 02:51:56,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Now Stan in the chat says, I'm sure Rob thought I was making stuff up.

2457
02:51:56,740 --> 02:51:58,081
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I didn't think you were making stuff up.

2458
02:51:58,121 --> 02:52:01,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I just thought, you know, sometimes you might know somebody.

2459
02:52:01,802 --> 02:52:03,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, oh, I went to high school with that person.

2460
02:52:03,883 --> 02:52:05,984
[SPEAKER_06]: And after the six month period, we're going to have your memory erased.

2461
02:52:07,804 --> 02:52:14,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Just look into this pen, let me put on my sunglasses Oh god, what else was I going to ask?

2462
02:52:15,832 --> 02:52:29,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Something escapes me, I don't know, just one episode's aired and I'm sure there's plenty more you've really got to bite your tongue on Hopefully you'll decide to keep listening to OLR and we can get some more dirt on the tester We're probably the only podcast that talks about this show

2463
02:52:31,515 --> 02:52:32,516
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few out there.

2464
02:52:33,316 --> 02:52:40,981
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually totally don't want to plug it, but kind of have to since Greg Miller was a guest judge this season.

2465
02:52:41,802 --> 02:52:47,045
[SPEAKER_00]: He's actually having all of the cast members as they're booted off the show on the Beyond podcast.

2466
02:52:47,125 --> 02:52:53,429
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever I get kicked off or when I win, I'll be on there and I'll see if I can put in an OLR.

2467
02:52:54,708 --> 02:53:19,817
[SPEAKER_00]: that's awesome you know what I have to say the final thing that kept me from applying really was that I don't want to live in LA except for being close to Disneyland well I figured it would be nice to actually like enjoy non sub zero temperatures like I am right now because I'm in Milwaukee not really the best weather capital of the world so I figured it'd be a nice change

2468
02:53:20,157 --> 02:53:22,160
[SPEAKER_00]: You live relatively close to good friends of ours.

2469
02:53:22,200 --> 02:53:24,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you live right by the OLR Lesbians.

2470
02:53:26,005 --> 02:53:27,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Located in Wisconsin.

2471
02:53:27,467 --> 02:53:28,088
[SPEAKER_00]: In Madison.

2472
02:53:28,308 --> 02:53:31,012
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, they should come to my roller derby bouts.

2473
02:53:31,853 --> 02:53:36,920
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually play for the Brew City Brewers in Milwaukee, so if you guys are listening, come to our fucking bouts!

2474
02:53:38,081 --> 02:53:41,925
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a good, a really good friend of mine just recently got into that whole roller derby thing and she's loving it.

2475
02:53:42,005 --> 02:53:48,911
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, actually, a friend of mine from one of my classes two semesters ago tried to get me into their league, the Sacramento League.

2476
02:53:49,131 --> 02:53:50,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I could see you out there taking some ass.

2477
02:53:50,712 --> 02:53:52,654
[SPEAKER_09]: However, my bad ankle kind of keeps me from doing it.

2478
02:53:52,674 --> 02:53:52,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't.

2479
02:53:53,875 --> 02:53:55,757
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I have horrible ankles.

2480
02:53:55,797 --> 02:54:01,024
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually tore my PCL on my left knee, so I have to wear this robo-brace of death, and I still do it.

2481
02:54:01,644 --> 02:54:04,287
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like you might make quite the scene.

2482
02:54:04,327 --> 02:54:06,390
[SPEAKER_09]: You could be the android of the skates.

2483
02:54:07,792 --> 02:54:08,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much.

2484
02:54:09,153 --> 02:54:29,510
[SPEAKER_05]: well unfortunately I gotta wrap things up we've had you on for like 20 minutes which is way longer than we have most callers but you're special cause you're you know you got the whole tie in to like something that's going on right now but please do I hope you're able to listen again and call us with updates so we can dish especially when the whole thing's over then we can really dish then we can really dish

2485
02:54:30,440 --> 02:54:59,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I have so many fun stories Can't wait I will make it a point to catch the episode so that it's not just one person Now you have a reason to watch Now it's like someone from OLR is on It might have happened in the reverse order but now that she's listening to OLR she's kind of a member of the OLR I can take a few minutes out of my week 22 minutes, you can do it Just fast forward the last 5 minutes and you'll find out who's gone and who stays You're all good

2486
02:55:00,111 --> 02:55:03,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob takes that 20 minutes out of his busy rating schedule.

2487
02:55:03,373 --> 02:55:03,793
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm kidding.

2488
02:55:04,054 --> 02:55:04,314
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

2489
02:55:04,354 --> 02:55:10,118
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like... But with all due respect, I watched Drag Race first, then The Tester.

2490
02:55:10,358 --> 02:55:10,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

2491
02:55:10,838 --> 02:55:11,578
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2492
02:55:12,139 --> 02:55:13,180
[SPEAKER_00]: Good combo you got there.

2493
02:55:14,320 --> 02:55:14,540
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2494
02:55:14,821 --> 02:55:16,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Asuka, thank you so much for calling in.

2495
02:55:17,202 --> 02:55:18,283
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope to hell you win.

2496
02:55:19,023 --> 02:55:22,325
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I... Yeah, I hope to hell you win.

2497
02:55:22,486 --> 02:55:23,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just put it that way.

2498
02:55:24,067 --> 02:55:24,427
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

2499
02:55:24,947 --> 02:55:26,048
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, I will definitely be...

2500
02:55:27,609 --> 02:55:29,010
[SPEAKER_00]: coming back next week and the week after.

2501
02:55:29,110 --> 02:55:30,331
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.

2502
02:55:30,411 --> 02:55:31,152
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get rid of me now.

2503
02:55:31,192 --> 02:55:31,612
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

2504
02:55:31,952 --> 02:55:32,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

2505
02:55:33,013 --> 02:55:34,154
[SPEAKER_05]: She's joined the oil army.

2506
02:55:34,794 --> 02:55:36,415
[SPEAKER_05]: We've used the oil army duct tape.

2507
02:55:36,515 --> 02:55:37,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Just don't tell Sherry.

2508
02:55:37,176 --> 02:55:37,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Blame Stan.

2509
02:55:38,157 --> 02:55:38,457
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2510
02:55:38,877 --> 02:55:39,117
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2511
02:55:39,337 --> 02:55:39,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care.

2512
02:55:39,898 --> 02:55:40,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one.

2513
02:55:41,139 --> 02:55:41,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care.

2514
02:55:41,559 --> 02:55:42,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye, guys.

2515
02:55:42,520 --> 02:55:42,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

2516
02:55:43,220 --> 02:55:44,321
[SPEAKER_09]: You're mentioning Shermie now.

2517
02:55:44,341 --> 02:55:48,423
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to have to go home and clean a big pile of crap up off the laundry room floor.

2518
02:55:48,443 --> 02:55:50,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Because Shermie has her own bedroom, y'all.

2519
02:55:51,145 --> 02:55:55,727
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that she's so self-deprecating about the whole thing.

2520
02:55:56,968 --> 02:56:05,853
[SPEAKER_05]: And it sounds to me, I mean, I could be wrong, but it sounds to me based on the whole Facebook group they've got going on or Fakebook, as she called it, that it sounds like they're all kind of in on the joke.

2521
02:56:05,933 --> 02:56:07,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, yeah, you know, it's the tester.

2522
02:56:08,014 --> 02:56:09,655
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's pretty awesome.

2523
02:56:10,796 --> 02:56:13,037
[SPEAKER_05]: They accept it for what it is.

2524
02:56:13,658 --> 02:56:14,558
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's awesome.

2525
02:56:15,979 --> 02:56:17,100
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll tell you what, you know what?

2526
02:56:17,180 --> 02:56:18,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, and I do stand by this.

2527
02:56:19,021 --> 02:56:20,282
[SPEAKER_05]: I said this before and I'll say it now.

2528
02:56:20,623 --> 02:56:23,445
[SPEAKER_05]: The Tester, it's not a TV show that's going to change your life.

2529
02:56:23,585 --> 02:56:25,026
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the best thing on television.

2530
02:56:25,366 --> 02:56:25,906
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what?

2531
02:56:25,946 --> 02:56:32,551
[SPEAKER_05]: For something in the background, it is probably more entertaining than a lot of shows that have been about video gaming in the past.

2532
02:56:32,731 --> 02:56:33,672
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

2533
02:56:35,052 --> 02:56:38,574
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2534
02:56:38,614 --> 02:56:41,074
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to give us a call, you can go for that right now.

2535
02:56:41,114 --> 02:56:42,535
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got time to take a couple more calls.

2536
02:56:42,575 --> 02:56:46,596
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that call went on a long time, but we'll get at least one or two more other people on the show.

2537
02:56:47,096 --> 02:56:51,298
[SPEAKER_05]: In the meantime, let's read some Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR.

2538
02:56:53,039 --> 02:56:59,503
[SPEAKER_05]: 13xforever sent us a tweet this week that says, Hey, OLR, how about five game music albums for whatever price you wish to pay?

2539
02:56:59,943 --> 02:57:02,865
[SPEAKER_05]: How about 13 plus albums for $10 or more?

2540
02:57:03,205 --> 02:57:06,287
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's referring to the gamemusicbundle.com.

2541
02:57:06,327 --> 02:57:07,708
[SPEAKER_05]: It's another one of those indie bundles.

2542
02:57:07,748 --> 02:57:09,609
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that whole thing's been very popular lately.

2543
02:57:10,209 --> 02:57:15,233
[SPEAKER_05]: and yeah, you can donate their money and get soundtracks.

2544
02:57:15,433 --> 02:57:22,918
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're a game music fan, it sounds like they have all different types of games included in that and they add more soundtracks as more people donate.

2545
02:57:23,099 --> 02:57:23,719
[SPEAKER_05]: So interesting.

2546
02:57:24,079 --> 02:57:25,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to the phones because we have more people calling in.

2547
02:57:26,001 --> 02:57:27,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2548
02:57:27,062 --> 02:57:27,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2549
02:57:28,086 --> 02:57:28,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, what up, guys?

2550
02:57:28,807 --> 02:57:29,968
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Xenacore from the OKC.

2551
02:57:29,988 --> 02:57:30,428
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing?

2552
02:57:30,488 --> 02:57:34,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Xenacore from Oklahoma City, unless OKC stands for something else.

2553
02:57:35,012 --> 02:57:35,212
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?

2554
02:57:35,232 --> 02:57:36,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, you're pretty right on money.

2555
02:57:36,974 --> 02:57:41,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, by the way, just want to say, the Thunder losing to the Kings?

2556
02:57:41,458 --> 02:57:42,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude.

2557
02:57:43,080 --> 02:57:44,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, the Thunder lost to the Kings.

2558
02:57:45,362 --> 02:57:46,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you watch basketball?

2559
02:57:46,703 --> 02:57:47,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Who the hell are the Thunder?

2560
02:57:47,684 --> 02:57:48,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind.

2561
02:57:48,124 --> 02:57:50,286
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

2562
02:57:50,486 --> 02:57:50,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Never mind.

2563
02:57:50,987 --> 02:57:52,428
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, I don't pay attention to that fucking team.

2564
02:57:52,448 --> 02:57:53,028
[SPEAKER_01]: They ain't paying me.

2565
02:57:53,069 --> 02:57:53,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck it.

2566
02:57:54,520 --> 02:57:58,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just say the Thunder right now is the best team in the league and they fucking lost to the Kings.

2567
02:57:58,582 --> 02:57:59,162
[SPEAKER_05]: The Sacramento Kings.

2568
02:57:59,182 --> 02:58:00,042
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty funny.

2569
02:58:00,062 --> 02:58:03,524
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody here in Sacramento is just laughing because we're like, the Kings suck.

2570
02:58:03,564 --> 02:58:04,144
[SPEAKER_05]: And you guys, oh God.

2571
02:58:04,164 --> 02:58:04,864
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anyway.

2572
02:58:05,764 --> 02:58:06,825
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't make this about basketball.

2573
02:58:07,085 --> 02:58:07,985
[SPEAKER_01]: What's on your mind, ZetaCore?

2574
02:58:08,566 --> 02:58:09,366
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much, not much.

2575
02:58:09,446 --> 02:58:11,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Just been playing the hell out of League of Legends for some reason.

2576
02:58:12,577 --> 02:58:13,797
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's funny you bring that up.

2577
02:58:14,378 --> 02:58:19,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter asked us a question here about League of Legends, so I can kind of tie this together.

2578
02:58:19,700 --> 02:58:23,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Ossifer sent us a tweet, said, Have you guys ever played League of Legends?

2579
02:58:23,741 --> 02:58:31,724
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an extremely popular free online game that I've never heard you mention on the show, which is funny because we did end up mentioning it at the top of the show during the Dota thing.

2580
02:58:32,124 --> 02:58:33,044
[SPEAKER_05]: But he's right.

2581
02:58:33,384 --> 02:58:37,626
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally have not played League of Legends myself, but Xenocore sounds like you're a fan.

2582
02:58:38,684 --> 02:58:39,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've been playing it for a while now.

2583
02:58:39,885 --> 02:58:44,769
[SPEAKER_01]: I finally got my account maxed out so I can actually compete with some of the other characters in the game.

2584
02:58:46,591 --> 02:58:57,140
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole thing with the multiplayer online battle arenas, at least that's the genre it's been labeled as, the MOBAs, is since it's all team based, there's a lot of rage in there.

2585
02:58:57,260 --> 02:58:59,462
[SPEAKER_01]: More so than you might see in a first person shooter, so.

2586
02:59:00,598 --> 02:59:03,499
[SPEAKER_01]: I can only play it for about an hour and then the little 12-year-olds get on my nerves.

2587
02:59:03,619 --> 02:59:05,779
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, the game itself is pretty fun.

2588
02:59:05,859 --> 02:59:06,480
[SPEAKER_05]: I can only imagine.

2589
02:59:06,500 --> 02:59:10,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, League of Legends is one of those games I think I would enjoy more if I just played it with, like, only people I know.

2590
02:59:11,381 --> 02:59:18,803
[SPEAKER_05]: But one thing I do notice is that it's a hugely popular game to be streamed on those video game streaming websites like Twitch TV.

2591
02:59:19,123 --> 02:59:21,144
[SPEAKER_05]: I always see League of Legends stuff going on on there.

2592
02:59:21,684 --> 02:59:26,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I actually started playing Heroes of Newer just because it looks more polished.

2593
02:59:27,066 --> 02:59:29,447
[SPEAKER_01]: because they acted at higher resolutions and all this other stuff.

2594
02:59:29,467 --> 02:59:30,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Your interface was better.

2595
02:59:30,788 --> 02:59:35,650
[SPEAKER_01]: But I couldn't find any pro content or even games being played so I could learn how to play it.

2596
02:59:36,150 --> 02:59:47,196
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was tons of League of Legends stuff, so I started watching that here and there, like pro coverage and just some guys casting their games because that's how I got into StarCraft is when everybody was casting it during the beta.

2597
02:59:47,896 --> 02:59:51,438
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started playing it out, and once I figured out how it worked, it was pretty fun.

2598
02:59:51,598 --> 02:59:53,479
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only really competitive game that I play.

2599
02:59:53,779 --> 02:59:56,160
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty much done with first-person shooters as far as I'm concerned.

2600
02:59:56,647 --> 02:59:59,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me back up a minute, because this is the question I should have asked you first.

2601
02:59:59,710 --> 03:00:06,576
[SPEAKER_05]: For those that aren't familiar with League of Legends, as Ossifer kind of insinuates we are on the Twitter, what makes this game addicting?

2602
03:00:06,696 --> 03:00:09,919
[SPEAKER_05]: What makes you stick it out through the 12-year-olds as long as you can for this?

2603
03:00:10,519 --> 03:00:13,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so you're familiar with the interface that StarCraft and them use, right?

2604
03:00:13,982 --> 03:00:17,625
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got your mouse control, you're right-clicking on things and moving them around.

2605
03:00:17,825 --> 03:00:19,687
[SPEAKER_01]: This one, you're locked into one single character.

2606
03:00:20,368 --> 03:00:21,789
[SPEAKER_01]: So you play one character, there's about

2607
03:00:22,423 --> 03:00:26,144
[SPEAKER_01]: I think just under 100, if not just a little over 100 characters to choose from.

2608
03:00:26,424 --> 03:00:27,965
[SPEAKER_01]: They all have different abilities.

2609
03:00:28,785 --> 03:00:32,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of your standard role-playing game party.

2610
03:00:33,127 --> 03:00:35,908
[SPEAKER_01]: They have characters that fit each role that's in the game.

2611
03:00:36,188 --> 03:00:39,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Your healer, your magic user, your archer, sure.

2612
03:00:39,349 --> 03:00:41,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, here's one that does straight attack damage.

2613
03:00:41,470 --> 03:00:44,491
[SPEAKER_01]: You have your attack power, which are your magical abilities.

2614
03:00:44,791 --> 03:00:45,571
[SPEAKER_01]: You have your tanks.

2615
03:00:46,011 --> 03:01:02,727
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have your junglers, the guys who don't sit in the main action of the game running around and assisting everybody else to sum it up real quick and you just keep, it's tower defense so you have three lines of towers and a large crystal that you defend if you kill the other guy's crystal you win or they can surrender and give up

2616
03:01:03,448 --> 03:01:03,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2617
03:01:03,668 --> 03:01:05,470
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like the concept is pretty easy.

2618
03:01:05,550 --> 03:01:11,137
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not hard to learn, but it takes patience to learn how to play each character because they're all a little bit different.

2619
03:01:11,838 --> 03:01:19,587
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Riot puts out a teaser video on each one of the characters they release that tell you all about how to use their powers and this, that, and the other thing.

2620
03:01:19,607 --> 03:01:22,931
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to learn one, there's plenty of resources to do so.

2621
03:01:24,267 --> 03:01:42,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, I got to admit part of what is scary to me in sorts about League of Legends is that I am afraid of signing on there and that just getting owned by 12 year olds right off the bat because there's no way to practice like is there any type of like practice learning curve like kind of way to ease yourself into this game before you have to play against the hardcore people?

2622
03:01:43,123 --> 03:01:47,184
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, you can't really play with the hardcore guys because they're mainly doing rank matches.

2623
03:01:47,264 --> 03:01:50,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Rank matches you can't even touch until you max out your account.

2624
03:01:50,885 --> 03:01:54,006
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps track of your player skill and how long you've been playing up to level 30.

2625
03:01:54,686 --> 03:01:58,887
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll take you about a good four or five months before you can even touch the rank stuff.

2626
03:01:58,907 --> 03:01:59,767
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't have to worry about it.

2627
03:02:00,167 --> 03:02:01,328
[SPEAKER_01]: And the matching is pretty good.

2628
03:02:01,368 --> 03:02:05,829
[SPEAKER_01]: So it balances the team based off of the level base and how many wins they have.

2629
03:02:06,969 --> 03:02:07,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

2630
03:02:22,219 --> 03:02:25,642
[SPEAKER_01]: The quality of your games will go up as far as who you're matched with.

2631
03:02:26,262 --> 03:02:33,087
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you reach level 30, you can pretty much play any role because you've been playing the game enough in order to do so.

2632
03:02:33,288 --> 03:02:33,848
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's free.

2633
03:02:34,068 --> 03:02:35,910
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to put any money into it whatsoever.

2634
03:02:36,150 --> 03:02:36,770
[SPEAKER_05]: I like free.

2635
03:02:37,090 --> 03:02:37,651
[SPEAKER_05]: I do like free.

2636
03:02:37,931 --> 03:02:38,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me ask this.

2637
03:02:39,212 --> 03:02:45,117
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about the whole Dota stuff that we were talking about earlier in the show with Blizzard and Valve going at each other over Dota?

2638
03:02:45,157 --> 03:02:47,619
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it seems like you're kind of getting into these games now.

2639
03:02:48,039 --> 03:02:51,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have a preference on what you want to see happen with the

2640
03:02:52,302 --> 03:03:17,035
[SPEAKER_01]: well to sum them all up dota and dota 2 and what blizzard i think is trying to do in heroes of new earth follow the original model the original model is not newbie friendly there's a lot of that game is very complex i mean you take just five on five guys in the starcraft environment fighting each other and you add the crafting system and how you build bigger items you worry about

2641
03:03:17,635 --> 03:03:27,022
[SPEAKER_01]: The concepts of feeding other players, just running and killing so they get gold because they're killing you off left and right, which unbalances the whole game, and then everybody's screaming noob at you, this, that, and the other thing.

2642
03:03:27,182 --> 03:03:31,144
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of crap to remember for all those, but some people like that complexity.

2643
03:03:31,505 --> 03:03:38,790
[SPEAKER_01]: League of Legends is a lot simpler, it's easier to get into, and the matches potentially don't last as long because there's a level cap during the game.

2644
03:03:39,030 --> 03:03:44,894
[SPEAKER_01]: Your character can only get up to level 18, I think, and all the others can go up to 25, 30 before they start capping out.

2645
03:03:45,474 --> 03:03:47,635
[SPEAKER_01]: So the game is forced to a conclusion.

2646
03:03:47,755 --> 03:03:51,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually one game will not go any longer than an hour, even as a newbie.

2647
03:03:52,218 --> 03:03:52,618
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2648
03:03:53,018 --> 03:04:00,382
[SPEAKER_05]: So it sounds like there's a lot of, even though we kind of say these games all have the same roots, there's still a lot of mechanical differences between them.

2649
03:04:01,742 --> 03:04:04,224
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, at the core they're the same, but one is very newbie friendly.

2650
03:04:04,264 --> 03:04:06,265
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one, just let the pros deal with it.

2651
03:04:06,305 --> 03:04:06,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't even bother.

2652
03:04:07,805 --> 03:04:10,607
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Xenocore, anything else you want to share with listeners before we take another call?

2653
03:04:11,260 --> 03:04:18,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, actually, now if you get a to-go order from the Olive Garden, they give you a whole freaking roll of drumsticks, or breadsticks, man.

2654
03:04:18,550 --> 03:04:19,051
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.

2655
03:04:21,654 --> 03:04:23,296
[SPEAKER_01]: I got five in the fridge, I'm going to eat for breakfast.

2656
03:04:24,697 --> 03:04:30,602
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard a random story that the Olive Garden is having image problems right now.

2657
03:04:30,662 --> 03:04:34,385
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't imagine why, but they're actually going to change their restaurants.

2658
03:04:34,405 --> 03:04:38,848
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going through a JCPenney crisis right now where they're going to totally rebrand the Olive Garden.

2659
03:04:38,888 --> 03:04:40,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's weird because no one's really going there anymore.

2660
03:04:40,729 --> 03:04:42,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, the Olive Garden's kind of become a joke now.

2661
03:04:43,491 --> 03:04:45,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's freaking corporate, man.

2662
03:04:45,093 --> 03:04:50,657
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go in and see some old Italian dude cooking in the back speaking Italian and have these joints around here.

2663
03:04:50,677 --> 03:04:51,818
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd rather go there.

2664
03:04:52,298 --> 03:04:53,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly, exactly.

2665
03:04:53,618 --> 03:04:57,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, Xenocore, enjoy those breadsticks, but I gotta let you go so we can take a few more calls.

2666
03:04:57,563 --> 03:04:58,745
[SPEAKER_05]: And good luck with your League of Legends.

2667
03:04:58,785 --> 03:04:59,326
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm outta here.

2668
03:04:59,446 --> 03:05:00,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me on.

2669
03:05:00,327 --> 03:05:00,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, no problem.

2670
03:05:01,248 --> 03:05:01,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, buddy.

2671
03:05:03,348 --> 03:05:07,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2672
03:05:07,971 --> 03:05:11,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me get a few more Twitter topics out of the way before the next call comes in.

2673
03:05:11,974 --> 03:05:17,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, we have... DarkTesuya tweets us and says, Bad news for Loki.

2674
03:05:18,598 --> 03:05:21,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess who's working on haptic technology?

2675
03:05:21,780 --> 03:05:22,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Apple.

2676
03:05:23,321 --> 03:05:24,922
[SPEAKER_05]: What is haptic technology?

2677
03:05:25,203 --> 03:05:26,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's a Ready Player One reference.

2678
03:05:26,804 --> 03:05:29,425
[SPEAKER_05]: It's touching stuff with a glove.

2679
03:05:29,626 --> 03:05:33,048
[SPEAKER_05]: He tweets us a story about, I guess Apple's working on this right now?

2680
03:05:33,868 --> 03:05:50,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good for them Apple is playing around in this space now adding teeth to speculation it may soon launch high-end TV sets with glasses-less 3D God, all you ever hear about are these Apple TV sets that are all the rumor right now I don't know

2681
03:05:52,031 --> 03:05:54,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Would an Apple TV interest you in the least, Loki?

2682
03:05:54,434 --> 03:05:54,574
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2683
03:05:55,575 --> 03:06:01,923
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not one... Okay, listen, I'm not your normal Apple consumer that like, Oh, Apple released something!

2684
03:06:01,943 --> 03:06:03,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna go out to the store right now and go buy it!

2685
03:06:03,445 --> 03:06:03,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Go buy it!

2686
03:06:03,786 --> 03:06:04,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Go buy it!

2687
03:06:04,086 --> 03:06:04,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Go buy it!

2688
03:06:05,669 --> 03:06:09,070
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like, that is your usual consumer.

2689
03:06:09,090 --> 03:06:11,111
[SPEAKER_06]: I, on the other hand, have a TV.

2690
03:06:11,191 --> 03:06:14,512
[SPEAKER_06]: I have two TVs, one of which I use, one of which I don't use.

2691
03:06:14,852 --> 03:06:16,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not need a third TV.

2692
03:06:16,252 --> 03:06:18,593
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I got to wrap it up and go to the phones because we have another call.

2693
03:06:18,633 --> 03:06:19,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2694
03:06:19,753 --> 03:06:20,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2695
03:06:20,773 --> 03:06:22,214
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the one and only Ranma.

2696
03:06:22,374 --> 03:06:22,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Ranma.

2697
03:06:22,954 --> 03:06:25,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry you had to sit there on the line and listen to more of Loki's ranting.

2698
03:06:25,975 --> 03:06:26,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Bad timing.

2699
03:06:27,105 --> 03:06:33,748
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to understand, I enjoy Loki's ranting about Apple since my new roommate is an Apple fanboy, so you know.

2700
03:06:35,189 --> 03:06:36,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what's up, buddy?

2701
03:06:36,870 --> 03:06:40,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too much, but Rob, I have a bone to pick with you again.

2702
03:06:40,752 --> 03:06:41,952
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a boner to pick with me?

2703
03:06:42,012 --> 03:06:42,492
[SPEAKER_05]: That's hot.

2704
03:06:43,293 --> 03:06:45,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, first we have balls, now we have boners, okay?

2705
03:06:45,954 --> 03:06:47,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, what's up?

2706
03:06:48,035 --> 03:06:48,655
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, Rama?

2707
03:06:49,556 --> 03:06:50,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, you're a dick.

2708
03:06:50,836 --> 03:06:51,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

2709
03:06:51,077 --> 03:06:51,677
[SPEAKER_05]: What do I do now?

2710
03:06:53,483 --> 03:06:54,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about balls.

2711
03:06:55,084 --> 03:06:57,145
[SPEAKER_04]: You are a dick talking about balls, man.

2712
03:06:57,165 --> 03:06:57,885
[SPEAKER_04]: You got some nerve.

2713
03:06:58,786 --> 03:07:01,547
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I do here on the show is help it land in the toilet.

2714
03:07:02,388 --> 03:07:07,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, but we should leave the talking of balls to David Bowie since he fondles them on a regular basis.

2715
03:07:10,992 --> 03:07:11,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop.

2716
03:07:13,293 --> 03:07:14,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that all you really want?

2717
03:07:15,094 --> 03:07:16,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on my show and make balls jokes?

2718
03:07:17,975 --> 03:07:19,476
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I also wanted to compliment your hair.

2719
03:07:19,596 --> 03:07:20,617
[SPEAKER_04]: So you look like Riker.

2720
03:07:23,024 --> 03:07:24,005
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have a webcam.

2721
03:07:24,025 --> 03:07:25,526
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't know what my hair looks like right now.

2722
03:07:25,566 --> 03:07:26,227
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been napping.

2723
03:07:26,747 --> 03:07:29,069
[SPEAKER_04]: I should ask this question.

2724
03:07:29,429 --> 03:07:29,869
[SPEAKER_04]: What hair?

2725
03:07:30,970 --> 03:07:31,190
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

2726
03:07:31,971 --> 03:07:34,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Since the studio's at your house, can we get the OLR cam back?

2727
03:07:35,514 --> 03:07:36,214
[SPEAKER_05]: I've thought about it.

2728
03:07:36,515 --> 03:07:39,337
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seriously thought about it, but it's kind of a pain in the butt to hook up.

2729
03:07:39,837 --> 03:07:44,281
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're probably going to be moving in June anyway, so probably after that.

2730
03:07:44,861 --> 03:07:47,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we'll have a more proper studio set up at that point.

2731
03:07:49,434 --> 03:07:50,976
[SPEAKER_04]: The studio's like a nomad, isn't it?

2732
03:07:51,256 --> 03:07:55,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe for your 10-year present, OLR listeners, because our birthday's in June, too.

2733
03:07:55,440 --> 03:07:56,641
[SPEAKER_05]: It plays Genesis games?

2734
03:07:59,304 --> 03:08:00,945
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a thing that plays Genesis games.

2735
03:08:01,446 --> 03:08:02,186
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called a Genesis.

2736
03:08:03,788 --> 03:08:07,491
[SPEAKER_05]: And a nomad.

2737
03:08:08,553 --> 03:08:09,714
[SPEAKER_05]: What am I going to do with you, Ranma?

2738
03:08:09,774 --> 03:08:12,016
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anything else you want to filthy up the show with tonight?

2739
03:08:12,699 --> 03:08:15,901
[SPEAKER_04]: No, um, how bad the Vita's gonna fall flat on its face.

2740
03:08:16,401 --> 03:08:17,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, now you're throwing some shade.

2741
03:08:17,982 --> 03:08:18,562
[SPEAKER_05]: This is good.

2742
03:08:18,622 --> 03:08:20,123
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the types of calls I like.

2743
03:08:20,543 --> 03:08:22,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is the Vita gonna fall flat on its face, Ranma?

2744
03:08:23,704 --> 03:08:29,687
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't, as much as I want the system, I can't see myself shelling out $250 for this thing.

2745
03:08:30,488 --> 03:08:30,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I just can't.

2746
03:08:31,949 --> 03:08:36,091
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Nintendo learned their lesson, like, pretty quickly with the price drop.

2747
03:08:36,731 --> 03:08:40,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony will just stand there and just say that if

2748
03:08:41,672 --> 03:08:42,072
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay.

2749
03:08:42,172 --> 03:08:43,314
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay.

2750
03:08:43,334 --> 03:08:44,515
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing wrong with the price.

2751
03:08:45,116 --> 03:08:47,499
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll stay at that price for me for a year before it falls.

2752
03:08:48,140 --> 03:08:48,501
[SPEAKER_04]: If that.

2753
03:08:48,781 --> 03:08:52,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's look at the technology with the DS and the 3DS.

2754
03:08:53,347 --> 03:08:55,870
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you put those side to side and you know...

2755
03:08:57,252 --> 03:08:57,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

2756
03:09:22,825 --> 03:09:23,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

2757
03:09:46,457 --> 03:09:47,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

2758
03:10:07,691 --> 03:10:31,677
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it has a good chance because their launch lineup is fucking awesome I mean they've got a lot of games coming out and it's not like hey look here's our launch lineup and then we have one 3DS game coming out each month I mean we're talking like a lot of games and it's gonna be Vita Vita Vita all over the place I will say PlayStation does seem to have really good third party support out the gate as opposed to third party support eventually

2759
03:10:32,177 --> 03:10:35,978
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's also pretty powerful technology-wise.

2760
03:10:35,998 --> 03:10:37,219
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the screen looks nice.

2761
03:10:37,319 --> 03:10:55,465
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got dual analog sticks, which is going to be great for porting games over or creating first-person shooter games and that kind of stuff because you actually have some decent controls there, except unlike the 3DS where you're going to force people to use the analog stick and then the touchscreen.

2762
03:10:55,545 --> 03:10:59,026
[SPEAKER_06]: And, oh, it's very fucking uncomfortable, so let's throw in the stand.

2763
03:10:59,366 --> 03:10:59,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

2764
03:11:18,388 --> 03:11:20,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Ranma, he's made his case.

2765
03:11:20,650 --> 03:11:21,150
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

2766
03:11:21,370 --> 03:11:26,634
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see a lot of questions to be answered over the next month and see what the numbers look like when the system comes out.

2767
03:11:27,214 --> 03:11:29,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Ranma, anything else quickly before we let you go?

2768
03:11:31,017 --> 03:11:34,059
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of floored because I actually agree with Loki on that.

2769
03:11:34,079 --> 03:11:38,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I do and I understand where he's coming from.

2770
03:11:38,141 --> 03:11:40,663
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the Vita is a much more powerful system.

2771
03:11:40,983 --> 03:11:42,945
[SPEAKER_04]: It's there.

2772
03:11:43,445 --> 03:11:44,746
[SPEAKER_04]: But the way I see it is that

2773
03:11:45,762 --> 03:11:52,968
[SPEAKER_04]: The consumer's going to look at it like, oh, I can do all this, look at the price, put it down, and they can go pick up a 3DS or something like that.

2774
03:11:52,988 --> 03:11:55,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's what it's coming down to right about now.

2775
03:11:55,310 --> 03:11:56,591
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about the price point.

2776
03:11:56,831 --> 03:12:04,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but people are comfortable in paying those kinds of price points because people are buying tablets and they're buying all this other electronic garbage that's really expensive.

2777
03:12:05,319 --> 03:12:06,880
[SPEAKER_06]: The price point's not that big a deal anymore.

2778
03:12:07,901 --> 03:12:08,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know about that.

2779
03:12:08,942 --> 03:12:13,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people that are buying tablets are iPad users because they're buying because it's an iPad, you know?

2780
03:12:15,459 --> 03:12:16,021
[SPEAKER_04]: and many more.

2781
03:12:26,465 --> 03:12:26,945
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

2782
03:12:47,133 --> 03:12:48,614
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I have to put an end to this.

2783
03:12:48,634 --> 03:12:49,494
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to wrap up the show.

2784
03:12:49,514 --> 03:12:50,274
[SPEAKER_05]: We're running out of time.

2785
03:12:50,574 --> 03:12:51,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma, thank you very much for your call.

2786
03:12:52,075 --> 03:12:52,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Good luck.

2787
03:12:52,395 --> 03:12:52,935
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem.

2788
03:12:53,095 --> 03:12:53,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care.

2789
03:12:53,916 --> 03:12:54,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Later.

2790
03:12:54,596 --> 03:12:55,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Run, John.

2791
03:12:55,416 --> 03:12:55,676
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2792
03:12:56,156 --> 03:12:56,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, he didn't hear that.

2793
03:12:56,837 --> 03:12:57,697
[SPEAKER_05]: He'll hear it on the air.

2794
03:12:58,117 --> 03:12:59,638
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we've got to close up the Skype line, guys.

2795
03:12:59,658 --> 03:13:03,579
[SPEAKER_06]: So really, you've got to buy a system that's less expensive than the other system.

2796
03:13:03,739 --> 03:13:04,300
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how it is.

2797
03:13:05,400 --> 03:13:07,421
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's the argument he's making.

2798
03:13:07,601 --> 03:13:10,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, the iPad's $500, so spending $250 on this tablet's not that big a deal.

2799
03:13:13,959 --> 03:13:14,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, what?

2800
03:13:14,620 --> 03:13:15,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't make any sense.

2801
03:13:16,441 --> 03:13:16,781
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2802
03:13:17,602 --> 03:13:18,523
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to wrap up the show.

2803
03:13:18,723 --> 03:13:20,264
[SPEAKER_05]: We ran long tonight, but that's okay.

2804
03:13:20,525 --> 03:13:23,647
[SPEAKER_05]: It was worth it for the phone call with Asuka earlier on.

2805
03:13:23,687 --> 03:13:24,848
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun.

2806
03:13:25,329 --> 03:13:26,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Who I've been chatting with.

2807
03:13:27,090 --> 03:13:28,011
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew you would.

2808
03:13:28,031 --> 03:13:30,313
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew you'd be braiding each other's hair within minutes.

2809
03:13:30,333 --> 03:13:31,254
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a matter of time.

2810
03:13:31,294 --> 03:13:31,534
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2811
03:13:32,014 --> 03:13:32,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Hitting each other with pillows.

2812
03:13:32,955 --> 03:13:33,195
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2813
03:13:35,357 --> 03:13:36,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, we got to wrap it up.

2814
03:13:36,998 --> 03:13:40,581
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to wrap up the show and be on out of here for the night.

2815
03:13:40,641 --> 03:13:43,002
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's go around and get everybody's... Oh, I didn't do all the tweets.

2816
03:13:43,082 --> 03:13:43,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn it, damn it, damn it.

2817
03:13:43,723 --> 03:13:43,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Quickly.

2818
03:13:44,343 --> 03:13:45,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there were some I really wanted to read.

2819
03:13:46,885 --> 03:13:50,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft says, Beat Hazard Ultra is now on iOS.

2820
03:13:50,607 --> 03:13:57,932
[SPEAKER_05]: If you know the Beat Hazard games, which are actually a lot of... I do love Beat Hazard on the PC via Steam.

2821
03:13:58,012 --> 03:14:00,814
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to definitely check this out now that I know it's on iOS.

2822
03:14:01,275 --> 03:14:04,176
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see a price here in the story, but I wanted to say I read somewhere it was like $2.99.

2823
03:14:05,277 --> 03:14:09,102
[SPEAKER_05]: and it will work with all the stuff that's on your iOS device.

2824
03:14:09,142 --> 03:14:09,702
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty cool.

2825
03:14:10,123 --> 03:14:12,145
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple quick ones from Tiger Claw.

2826
03:14:12,566 --> 03:14:15,509
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the Sonic and Sega All-Stars you mentioned during Quickfire News.

2827
03:14:15,549 --> 03:14:17,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me read this other one from Tiger Claw.

2828
03:14:17,031 --> 03:14:17,751
[SPEAKER_05]: 305 on Twitter.

2829
03:14:20,074 --> 03:14:23,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Twisted Metal promotion blows up Sweet Tooth's truck.

2830
03:14:23,995 --> 03:14:28,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, I guess this is a promotion for Twisted Metal where you get to destroy things.

2831
03:14:28,736 --> 03:14:40,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Fans can sign up for a chance to remotely fire M249 saw machine guns at the real-life version of the ice cream truck driven by Sweet Tooth, the game's fire-haired, clown-faced antagonist.

2832
03:14:42,198 --> 03:14:46,379
[SPEAKER_05]: They've hooked guns up to a satellite so you can control them remotely from your computer.

2833
03:14:46,519 --> 03:14:46,779
[SPEAKER_05]: What?! !

2834
03:14:47,759 --> 03:14:51,523
[SPEAKER_05]: You can shoot a real gun with real bullets at a real truck from your computer.

2835
03:14:51,843 --> 03:14:55,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to shootmytruck.com for a chance to pull the trigger.

2836
03:14:56,928 --> 03:15:00,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Or it's just a video of that and not actually a real trick.

2837
03:15:00,771 --> 03:15:01,712
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a dirty trick.

2838
03:15:04,110 --> 03:15:05,811
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight

2839
03:15:30,880 --> 03:15:35,442
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought tonight is the only downside to shows running long is no Pinkberry Break.

2840
03:15:35,963 --> 03:15:36,543
[SPEAKER_05]: I know!

2841
03:15:37,584 --> 03:15:38,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh well.

2842
03:15:38,524 --> 03:15:39,205
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get it during the week.

2843
03:15:40,285 --> 03:15:41,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Salted Caramel, you will be mine.

2844
03:15:42,697 --> 03:15:44,839
[SPEAKER_05]: That's gonna do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2845
03:15:44,859 --> 03:15:46,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, if you like what you heard, you know what we say.

2846
03:15:46,620 --> 03:15:48,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Please just tell a couple other people about the show.

2847
03:15:48,882 --> 03:15:50,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

2848
03:15:50,804 --> 03:15:51,785
[SPEAKER_05]: We really appreciate it.

2849
03:15:52,185 --> 03:15:58,731
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we don't have a million dollar magazine backing us up or a website or our own show on the PlayStation Network or anything like that.

2850
03:15:59,071 --> 03:16:03,375
[SPEAKER_05]: So all we ask is tell a friend or two about the show and help grow the OL Army.

2851
03:16:03,675 --> 03:16:05,677
[SPEAKER_05]: like Stan did.

2852
03:16:05,837 --> 03:16:10,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Stan told his buddy who happened to be on this little show that's going on right now to listen to the show and it worked.

2853
03:16:10,640 --> 03:16:12,001
[SPEAKER_05]: So Stan gets a gold star this week.

2854
03:16:12,381 --> 03:16:15,143
[SPEAKER_05]: But you guys definitely everybody else can earn gold stars.

2855
03:16:15,164 --> 03:16:17,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Just tell a friend or two about Orange Lounge Radio.

2856
03:16:17,926 --> 03:16:18,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Really appreciate it.

2857
03:16:18,946 --> 03:16:19,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a great week everybody.

2858
03:16:19,987 --> 03:16:23,149

2859
03:16:23,390 --> 03:16:25,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe some more Vita impressions.

2860
03:16:25,491 --> 03:16:32,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if anyone's getting the early one but have a great Valentine's Day as well whether you're spending it with somebody special or whether you're spending it

2861
03:16:32,416 --> 03:16:33,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Forever alone.

2862
03:16:34,018 --> 03:16:35,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Or whether you're spending it with your hand.

2863
03:16:36,500 --> 03:16:37,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a great week, everybody.

2864
03:16:38,302 --> 03:16:38,903
[SPEAKER_05]: See you next time.

2865
03:16:56,039 --> 03:16:58,543
