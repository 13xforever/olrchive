00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,800
well you've had the rain and I spent the last three days typing a renaming files

five pieces which this is like you know you're you're you are one of the stars

00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:26,360

14
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:32,320
yearbook right or what this I'll put it this way this makes a yearbook look like

15
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,560
a fanzine in comparison I was in your book in high school but I'm doing have

16
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,520
your books in high school yes oh by the way over there tech master Loki how are

17
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,840
you Loki they have your books in high school yes they did or not high school

18
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:51,200
out of college sure they could they did because my parents met at a Modesto

19
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,840
junior college I'll say it and they there was a yearbook yeah of course they

20
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,400
have your books in high school I I I was in yearbook at high school because it's

21
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,760
okay wait we got to go back to our Sakura story we derailed the magazine

22
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,280
basically it showcases all of the art the culinary the fashion that gets put

23
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,600
out through American River College and we win lots of big national awards we

24
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,920
beat out four year schools we beat out dedicated art schools and we beat

25
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,480
Harvard one year and you won the humility award apparently well now I'm

26
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,400
just really proud we put a lot of hard work on it and it's something to be

27
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,240
proud of fair enough but this is my last year being able to not for art selection

28
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,520
but it's my last year that I'm gonna be working on the design team so and no

29
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,520
time for games I've played some games someday though someday though you could

30
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,880
totally do designing for instruction manuals or you know I was at best I've

31
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,600
been applying for those types of jobs well I know I don't know how much I

32
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,560
should say it say on air but there's that company just down the road that

33
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,440
makes those strategy guides and I was just at Best Buy the other day and I was

34
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,360
really admiring there was a collector's strategy guide for Final Fantasy 13 to

35
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,560
I'm not usually the type to get strategy guides because you know you can kind of

36
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,960
get it all on game facts but I gotta say if you're a really big fan of a game

37
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,520
there's just some beautiful art and design in a lot of those books like

38
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,920
they're just they're they're good coffee table books for nerds I mean in this one

39
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,320
I was looking at with the collector's edition had like that that big thick

40
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,480
kind of pillowy cover almost to it I mean it was not your stand lost books I

41
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,040
guess I don't know what the technical name is for it but it was like you know

42
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,400
it was like the type that if you threw it on the ground it wouldn't leave any

43
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:31,440
marks because it's like push so they those are done with actually I think

44
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,160
foam and embossing mm-hmm so yeah I mean the thing is maybe I should save this

45
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,680
for my F use but I'll go ahead and say it right now the problem with a lot of

46
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,120
places that hire designers is they want you to have a four-year degree and it

47
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,880
doesn't matter really how much experience real-life experience you have

48
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,840
and just have an associates hmm it's stupid I've got tons of experience and

49
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,300
they knew in a four-year degree man I'm like well tell them to reduce the

50
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,280
tuition please do you know that I used to do design work before I worked at my

51
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,980
current company which I've been at for ten years this is a long time ago when I

52
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:15,860
was 21 22 I work excuse me I worked for a truck drivers magazine and I was just

53
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,280
kind of the dude in the office like we all worked at the publishers office it

54
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,700
was it was a great staff was a very small office seven people and I was more

55
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,400
like I guess you could say kind of an administrative assistant to the

56
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,120
publisher sort of but I really did a lot of just different stuff I helped with

57
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,680
subscriptions and one role I ended up taking on when one of the gals left I

58
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,360
started designing trade ads for the magazine so I mean that's something I

59
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,280
didn't I just fell into it it was weird and I'm not like I had yearbook and in

60
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,080
high school but let's be real that's I there's a lot more to it that I'm not up

61
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,520
and up on but that's just how the way the the market is right now yeah it's

62
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:57,120
it's crazy and I you know I I would have no problem finishing my four-year degree

63
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,300
if tuition was not so stupidly high and now you all know a little fact about me

64
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,500
yes it's true I used to work for a truck drivers magazine so but it's I don't

65
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,220
know if it's still around I think it is but anyway I got laid off because you

66
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,960
know not a lot of truck drivers read magazines they all listen to satellite

67
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,820
radio but anyhow let's move on video games techmaster Loki how are you these

68
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,980
days fine I gotta say this one of the popular games like to play here at olr

69
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,160
before we get into the game talk is what did Loki bring to the show tonight and

70
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,360
Loki brought with him Jack in the Box and one of the now Jack in the Box they

71
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,480
have almost everywhere in the u.s. right but not not in the Northeast I think they

72
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,180
don't have it that's weird yeah it's weird they don't have it like cuz I know

73
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,800
friends that live up in like Connecticut and stuff and when they come out here

74
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,760
they're like we got to go to Jack in the Box oh my god it's kind of like it's

75
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,920
kind of like me and Dunkin Donuts cuz we don't have Dunkin Donuts here in

76
00:05:49,920 --> 00:06:00,680
California or Krispy Kreme coffee we do have a Krispy Kreme in Roseville yeah they're still yeah there's a Krispy Kreme where somewhere

77
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,360
there's one in Stockton too yeah but where's Roseville where in Roseville

78
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:10,240
though cuz I can swing out that way let me Google that for you anyhow Jack in

79
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,320
the Box right now they have the bacon milkshakes right now I don't know why I'm

80
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,480
giving them free advertising but whatever it's not on their menu probably

81
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,080
for good reason well okay I got to say when Loki came in and said I got a bacon

82
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,760
milkshake I'm like alright I have to try it that's why I brought it it's like try

83
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,160
that was so fucking repulsive I can't oh my god that was terrible I was I didn't

84
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,560
hate it and she's the Jewish one it's not real bacon that's right it's just

85
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:41,520
tastes like it just tastes like hickory and vanilla it did taste a little bit

86
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,000
like the cheeses that they have out at the mall with the Swiss ladies at

87
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,680
Christmastime was that the hickory farms hickory farms at it it did taste a

88
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,480
little bit like like smoked vanilla they made a bacon cheddar milkshake that might

89
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:01,080
be pretty good all right you know what though that has inspired me that you

90
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,680
know make my own bacon milkshake because this is it's the careful the grease and

91
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,600
milk don't hurdle Eric RPG says I want to go to a psycho donuts I've never heard

92
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,840
of that I wonder if that's like if you live in Portland there's a great place

93
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,600
called voodoo don't you surely you already know at this place it's legendary

94
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,000
up there but voodoo donuts which I had when I was up in Portland and that's

95
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,200
where you can get the donuts that look like penises and you can also get the

96
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:32,920
bacon maple bars Loki I've seen that on a I know actually no I've seen in that

97
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:39,800
and and no it wasn't that it was a what the hell it man versus food I saw it on

98
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,560
there all right video do weddings there to video games I want to want to get

99
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,800
into this off the top of the show Loki you sent out a tweet this week you are

100
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,320
parting with one of your video game systems what's going on I just don't

101
00:07:53,320 --> 00:08:01,360
play my 3ds so I want to get rid of it and really it came down to just I'm was

102
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,880
thinking okay Vita or the 3ds you know normally I would get both but I don't

103
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:13,920
play my 3ds that often so I was like okay what titles coming you know soon or

104
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,600
this year or that have been announced or potentially would be announced that I

105
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,560
would be looking forward to on the 3ds

106
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,800
kid Icarus maybe another Mario title or a paper Mario or something like that

107
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,600
confirm a 2d Mario right yeah there well there's one learn another 2d Marba I

108
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,160
don't really care and then there's like maybe a paper Mario or something like

109
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,400
that but it's just it's a few and far between it's you know I picked up Mario

110
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,240
Kart and I picked up the Super Mario 3 land and I played a lot of Mario Kart I

111
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:50,320
didn't really play much of Super Mario 3 land but be tween those I hadn't picked

112
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,520
up anything says launch I mean it's a good you know nine months span basically

113
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:02,840
between games and and honestly the next thing I'd probably pick up would be kid

114
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:08,240
Icarus which is in March and beyond that yeah I mean this is not a whole lot

115
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,560
whereas the Vita I mean they're porting everything to that there's gonna be a

116
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,120
Call of Duty on that there's gonna be probably the grand theft next grant the

117
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,040
thought it will be on that I would not be surprised and just I think there's a

118
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,080
lot more games on there that I would probably play versus my 3ds and be

119
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:30,240
honest I mean the 3ds it's kind of a letdown a little bit because it's just a

120
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,080
DS more or less I mean with some 3d graphics that are just kind of like yeah

121
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,960
that's kind of neat but would you think about I mean one I see I'm not quite on

122
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,880
the same side issue but I'm also in a situation right now where financially I

123
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,120
could get the V because I just did taxes and I had a huge tax refund so I could

124
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,080
get the Vita without having to part with my 3ds and I can juggle them both I'm

125
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,360
not gonna feel like I'm losing something to gain something else but the more I

126
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,120
think about it from your perspective if you do sell your 3ds it's not like you

127
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,240
couldn't buy one later and they'll probably have the read is the inevitable

128
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,240
redesign that includes that second d-pad and we all know there's going to be some

129
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,200
redesign in the future I know that's Alan's thing you know he doesn't want to

130
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,440
get a 3ds until the end there there will be there's absolutely going to be a

131
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,040
redesigned 3ds at some point and and that's not even really a big deal for me

132
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,520
either because it's it's just like even the next console generation I was kind

133
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,120
of thinking about it and it's like I'm not gonna I don't think I'm gonna buy

134
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,440
all three again you know it was kind of cool with the Wii is like oh I got to

135
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,000
try that out because you know that is a completely different type of way to play

136
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,560
games and the ps3 I honestly wouldn't have picked up at all but I got one for

137
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:45,000
free so you know I'm not gonna complain there and and really I didn't play too

138
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,160
much of my I've played a few games on the ps3 but not a whole lot and I still

139
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:55,640
don't I hardly ever use it for blu-rays I use it for streaming movies but I mean

140
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,240
I could do that with my Xbox too I play a lot more Xbox but so interesting

141
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,720
because I'm the exact opposite ever since the hacking like I don't know what

142
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,480
it is but like I don't touch my xbox 360 unless it's specifically for something I

143
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,840
can only play on 360 which lately is connect games rhythm party I talked

144
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:16,120
about last week I'm really into I played that like every day this past week but

145
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,080
otherwise the multi console stuff has been all ps3 for me like 13 to have been

146
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:27,080
playing on the ps3 you know I just don't know if I will mainly it was before it

147
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:33,280
was going to be that it was money was going to be the issue where I just wanted

148
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:39,320
to be didn't even then I really want to be there I mean but yeah I do because

149
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,200
there's actually some games on there that I'd like to try out I'm going to go

150
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,760
crazy and buy like a bunch of launch games like I did you know with you know

151
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:56,920
the 3DS crazy there but I mean it's just that's kind of why I'm going that way

152
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,240
it's just I don't have a lot of I mean I don't play Kingdom Hearts so because

153
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,760
otherwise Kingdom Hearts is probably a big draw for me for the 3ds I guess but

154
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:12,400
you know they don't have a date for that yet it's still some time is here I don't

155
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,680
know I just think there's gonna be a lot of stuff that in that system seems like

156
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,200
such a step up versus the DS and the 3ds ds and 3ds I mean they're much the same

157
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,760
I mean the graphics dsi you know and even the 3ds in some regards is a step

158
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,320
backwards I mean I'm still team 3ds I really like my 3ds I'm not gonna part

159
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,840
with it but I will say those dsi XL's I mean when Alan got one of those those

160
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:41,200
screens are gigantic I love it like it's that's the best way to play DS games

161
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,360
right now I wish the 3ds screens were that big but I guess they have to save

162
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,000
that for the reason something I don't know well maybe it's more expensive

163
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,960
because of the technology and those screens I don't know it's a 3ds tablet

164
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:59,960
oh wait that's just a Wii U controller oh yeah all right Vida yeah have you

165
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,320
gotten your hands on a Vida yet I finally played one yesterday no I have

166
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:08,080
done I played one at GameStop yesterday which I know yes I walked into a

167
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,760
GameStop and I didn't instantly turn to ash but in my defense I was at the mall

168
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,360
and we were shopping at some other stores and so we were walking right by

169
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,520
and I was like oh there's the Vita right there on the wall damn it let's go in

170
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,360
and take a look so I did get my hands on the Vita a little bit and I gotta say I

171
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,560
first thing I noticed right away damn that screen is big like for a handheld

172
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,680
like that you know it's more like regular TV proportions and I was kind of

173
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,680
okay that's that's kind of neat like the analog sticks are tiny though that's

174
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,080
that was interesting and they're not thank God they're not like that little

175
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,840
nub that's on the PSP that would like hurt my thumb after using it for so long

176
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,480
like yeah how was that thing they're like little tiny tiny little nubs tiny

177
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,920
little PS nipples that you can use to you know for whatever but then it's like

178
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,800
I'm standing there like an idiot like how do I start the damn game I can't and

179
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,760
then I remembered oh yeah this thing has a touchscreen I have to touch the screen

180
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:10,440
to get it to do anything but I played um oh what is it the mod nation racers and

181
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:16,520
I played wipeout 2048 or whatever the wipeout game is it's on the Vita and

182
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:21,160
yeah I mean it's it's gorgeous looking the graphics you know when they say it

183
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:26,280
looks like a PlayStation 3 yeah I can kind of see that I mean you know again

184
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,440
it's it's a little bit of bait-and-switch because yeah it's really

185
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,200
high resolution but on a lower resolution monitor but for handhelds it

186
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,880
is it is pretty gorgeous looking I'm still kind of on the fence on if I want

187
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,640
one or not and funny enough it's it's kind of what's troubling Loki and that

188
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,440
is the games but Loki I got to say you do make a good point most of the big

189
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,240
franchises will probably inevitably come over at some point I know I want that

190
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,880
Final Fantasy 10 thing that they're gonna do down the line I absolutely like

191
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,280
if I were to buy the Vita at launch I'm getting that luminous game absolutely

192
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,880
hasn't yet but song list and everything and you know I always have this fanboy

193
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:05,120
boner for Q entertainment you know it was speaking it just I didn't decide

194
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,600
I was kind of ironic and funny Ridge racers no longer a launch title I wonder

195
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,640
if it didn't sell very well at all in Japan and they went back to fix it and

196
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,560
add tracks let's hope but didn't Ninja Gaiden get bumped up like there was kind

197
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,720
of a no it's just that the news is too they're they're behind in getting

198
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,240
release dates and stuff like that so it's been launched for a while it does

199
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,160
kind of concern me a little bit too that there's a lot about the Vita that's

200
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,320
still kind of a question mark even though the damn things out in Japan and

201
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,560
there's a lot of stuff that ought to be there that's not and I gotta admit one

202
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,000
of the things I know a lot of people are like well if you want to just go play

203
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,840
your PSP or go hook up your PlayStation 1 the ps1 games not playing on the

204
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:52,760
PlayStation Vita I mean why not I don't understand why that doesn't work if that

205
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,760
thing is supposed to be as powerful as a PlayStation 3 why can't it successfully

206
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,520
emulate the PlayStation 1 games I'm sure there's a highly technical answer but

207
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,960
from a consumer standpoint I'm like damn it I bought like Final Fantasy I would

208
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,920
like to play that I've got the emulator to work because they still have full

209
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,880
backwards compatibility with the PlayStation portable stuff and they are

210
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,760
working on that right it's me when Sony's like implementing all these

211
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,960
features as they go but then there's a part of you that watches what happened

212
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:25,080
with Microsoft because remember when the Xbox first came out it was like these

213
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:30,360
handful of titles will be emulatable from the original Xbox and they slowly

214
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,840
added more and more to that list and they said we're not gonna stop till

215
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,040
they're all emulatable and they stopped about a year you're into it and you

216
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,080
still can't play the old DDR ultimate games on 360 at the same time at least

217
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,320
they're not shipping that system saying oh hey look internet browser Oh

218
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:52,000
internet browser coming in the future you know patch what yeah I guess okay

219
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,560
Nintendo's guilty of the same thing hey look you're right I want to buy a game

220
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,600
oops sorry store coming in a future patch all right here I always the second

221
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,000
analog see you know that March release day for whatever reason or April what

222
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,200
what the hell month did it come out March March all right they sure were

223
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,760
married to that date oh yeah the because of the quarter quarter earnings are

224
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,800
you're yeah so I mean I get maybe it's the same thing with Sony I mean yeah

225
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,800
it's February but it's you know still maybe that's part of the reason why they

226
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:28,040
got to get it out now oh well I'm sure I'll end up getting one inevitably

227
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,400
because I really do want that luminous game I really want it and then when the

228
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,160
Final Fantasy 10 thing comes out I'm gonna be like I want that too so well

229
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,360
and just looking at like some of the other stuff like little big planet on it

230
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,920
I'm not you know I don't play enough of little big planet on the ps3 but just

231
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:51,160
showing how easy it is to make stuff using that touchscreen just like okay I

232
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,320
want to make a hill and I want to adjust it oh and I'm gonna pinch it to make it

233
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,800
a little bit smaller and I'm gonna rotate it and I'm just gonna poke at

234
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,280
this stuff and everything works perfectly fine it I mean it's awesome

235
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:11,800
it's just so easy to make stuff with so I'm kind of looking for that spin-offs

236
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,560
that they're gonna have let's go to our chat room we always love to be joined by

237
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,800
the chat room chat that orange lounge radio calm some comments in the chat

238
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:24,000
room let's see a suka and our chat room says Vita is worthwhile at launch only

239
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
if you don't own a PSP see I do oh yeah I do own a PSP yet I'm still kind of

240
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,720
like and what of one is the other thing too though and I don't know if you've

241
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,360
done this yet you remember back when they gave you those free PlayStation

242
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:45,740
Network games and the free PSP games as part of the reparations for you know the

243
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,680
network being down for a while I haven't used those PSP games so I actually have

244
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:56,200
ModNation racers waiting for me as soon as I you know get my Vita more comments

245
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,160
in our chat room at chat.org.com ahamkara says no HDMI port on the Vita

246
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,360
well that's kind of ass what if you want to play your Vita stuff on the TV who

247
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,240
cares me I like cooking up the PSP to the TV yeah but who cares you know why

248
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,760
because first off who's to say that you're not going to be able to stream

249
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,120
that stuff from your Vita to your TV in the first place and whoever fucking uses

250
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:24,920
stupid cable so you actually use the cables hook up to your TV you like being

251
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:29,320
tethered six feet away from your TV was that fun I mean because I actually okay

252
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:34,000
hold on hold on smarty pants when I'm in the bedroom on the TV in there and I'm

253
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,240
kind of lying on the bed that six-foot tether is just enough where yes I can

254
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,940
lie in bed and play Final Fantasy 4 and have a fat day where I am fat and I am

255
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:49,040
playing PSP in bed on my TV I mean the only one that was actually that would

256
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:53,000
make sense doing that would have been like the PSP go where it actually had

257
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,880
you know DualShock 3 Bluetooth support which hey there you go Bluetooth support

258
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,440
you know you could maybe do something like that later on but I don't care I've

259
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,760
got a big screen in front of me why do I need to hook it up to my TV to have some

260
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:12,720
weird resolution on there I just don't need that if I want to play on my TV I'll

261
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,120
use my PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 spazz nator in our chat room says I don't want

262
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,160
to get a Vita due to the shit I've gone through with my PlayStation 3 and my

263
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,920
digital downloaded videos you know history can burn you and I you know I

264
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,120
know spazz nators called into the show before to talk about his his trials and

265
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,680
tribulations and I gotta say yeah I can see where he's coming from because it's

266
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:36,120
it's me and Microsoft right now I feel very apprehensive with like I don't want

267
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:42,800
to buy things on Xbox because my wallet will be you know stolen from yet again

268
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,360
I'm feeling a little weird about all that stuff whereas I'm sure some people

269
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,320
are like Rob you're irrational I don't buy a lot of digital content so it

270
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,040
doesn't matter to me I mean especially since they're like hey you get 10% off

271
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,400
maybe that's if we decide to discount it because uncharted it's not fucking

272
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,840
discounted or at least it wasn't it might be discounted now but still 10% all

273
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:12,160
right let's uh let's move on so Vida so Vida yes for you launch day um hopefully

274
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:18,520
Vida is strong like leaning towards yes but I'm really gonna wait for that first

275
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,200
week release thing that's Valentine's Day or whatever and see what the

276
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,160
feedback is on that dark soccer I'm pretty sure you said you're a no just

277
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:32,280
due to personal situations but any interest in Vita I want an iPad just

278
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,280
wait for an iPad three or whatever they're gonna announce one at the

279
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,560
beginning that's true yeah iPad 3 will be all HD and pretty I want one of those

280
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:44,320
two honestly I don't really give a shit about the Vida anymore why is that I

281
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,200
mean it would be nice to have one and I'm sure Dan wants to get one yeah are

282
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,960
you psyching yourself out of your like I don't want a Vida

283
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,080
Vida's are shit because I can't afford it no you know I'm saying I'm saying

284
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:03,880
this I really I'm still playing games on my DS and I can't play for very long

285
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:09,840
before I start to hurt so it's sort of like I play with anything that I want to

286
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:17,720
on my phone I only have to use my thumbs and bust to move is all I need bust to

287
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,640
move is all I need all right fair enough let's move on we're gonna talk about our

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,480
grandpa war crafter as he goes by in our chat room salvellous would be proud

311
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,520

312
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:27,240

313
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,400
recently I remember who was I'm actually because my one that's on the main server

314
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,280
I'm gonna be I'm learning how to tank on that one but this one other ones just

315
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:43,120
gonna be a DPS for lol so I can go in and go haha I begin some emails about a

316
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,880
Star Trek online and how they've added some new stuff and have really kind of

317
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,240
got behind the free-to-play stuff you've been able to check that out since when

318
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,280
FTP um well I haven't checked out the very new stuff I've seen some they they

319
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,480
have a really a lot easier way now to get some of the different costumes and

320
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,040
goodies and if you've got the cryptic points for it you actually just will

321
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,560
select it on the menu with all the rest of everything like if you're changing

322
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:08,120
your outfit and you want a certain piece of an outfit you can just select that

323
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,800
piece and pay your points then so I'm probably gonna be getting some cryptic

324
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,960
points in the next couple of weeks and really giving it a go because I miss

325
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,200
playing with my Scottish buddies but I still love us yo I went around and they

326
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,000
fixed a bunch of stuff on DS DS 9 Oh Deep Space 9 is in the game you can

327
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,880
actually now go in the office it's been in the game you did there were just

328
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,200
parts that were closed off now you can actually go you know in the commander's

329
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:40,400
office and the baseball is sitting there Cisco's baseball because you know he is

330
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:47,000
awesome tastic all right so I've had school and all this other stuff on my

331
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
plate so I still haven't sent out the game so sorry and we were gonna pick up

332
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,800
our lazy I know busy we're gonna pick up our duo today but we just didn't get by

333
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,800
there we had we were gonna go by Dan's mom's house but she had to go somewhere

334
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:09,120
else so we didn't get a chance to all right let's go to Loki tech master Loki

335
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,320
how was your gaming week I didn't play much I was writing for tutorials this

336
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:20,800
weekend I played very little bit of Skyrim I remember what I did in there

337
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:26,680
but something in Skyrim related I think it was oh yeah I checked out patch 1 4

338
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:32,680
which sadly to say even though it promised to fix the quest it did not

339
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:37,120
fix the quest I think the quest is too dead for me did they push out the

340
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:42,400
console finally yes it's a console now it was supposed to fix the fire on the

341
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:52,280
ice bro no not firing yes blood on the ice quest and I didn't none of mine it's

342
00:26:52,280 --> 00:27:00,960
impossible so me whatever um let's see then some other miscellaneous quests I

343
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:08,000
did I also played the cat that got the milk which was the free game I was

344
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,760
talking about the cat that got the milk calm and it's this weird it's like a

345
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:20,680
puzzle game and it gets all kind of artsy and it gets pretty hard actually

346
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:27,360
so it's fun for like a few minutes that's about how long the game is and

347
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:35,960
called you played more Call of Duty and I'm starting to try to teach myself now

348
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:43,160
pronating which is throwing grenades in really specific ways to get them to

349
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:49,480
bounce off shit and hit people very far away from you that's pretty much the

350
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:54,240
only area I could improve upon right now I'm really frustrated how that my

351
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,160
co-workers they they really don't like playing with me you're just too good

352
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,120
because I because because I will purposefully run up behind them and

353
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,920
stab them I have the opportunity that's not a nice or they'll be or they'll be

354
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,880
or they'll be standing there or something like that I'm like and I'll

355
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,440
sit behind them I'm like okay what's something funny that I could do to kill

356
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:22,320
them hmm something funny so like one of my co-workers is prone under this truck

357
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,240
like trying to snipe at people so I went prone to and I crawled up right behind

358
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,360
them and they started seeing my gun in their screen because you know I had

359
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,240
clipped past their camera no like what is that and then they turned and that

360
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:42,600
shot him in the face god damn it you're sitting there the whole time just kill

361
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:47,600
me I'm so hateful that at your work you can do this like you always just it

362
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,200
sounds like you work at a frat house for God's no it's just our 15-minute games

363
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,360
we get to 15 minutes and then they ask you know what I do on my 15-minute

364
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:02,720
breaks like a walk yeah I could do that but now where's the fun in that exactly

365
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:08,120
walking for nerds Call of Duty is where it's at well they the whole thing with

366
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,600
Call of Duty was we hate getting our asses kicked in Grand Theft Auto we're

367
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:17,600
gonna play Call of Duty because he's probably not good at that so humble so

368
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,840
humble I hey I didn't know I was gonna be good at it because honestly I played

369
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:28,760
Call of Duty for once before I'd actually played with them and so I was

370
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:33,560
kind of at the same spot that they were in fact I believe that my boss at least

371
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:39,480
had Call of Duty 4 already and he's been playing online for like a while now so

372
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,920
that's why he thought he had the advantage but apparently I'm really good

373
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:51,080
at that game I also read up on everything it's it's good to be educated

374
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,600
in what you're playing all right anything else for your gaming week that's

375
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,920
it all right my gaming week I get pretty short because I didn't play a lot of new

376
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,720
stuff I've been playing when I'm not playing World of Warcraft just like Dark

377
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:08,320
Sakura Final Fantasy 13 to haters stay pressed step off it's great I'm loving

378
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:16,040
Final Fantasy 13 to it's it's so I it's it's such a different story than the

379
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:21,080
last one and kind of the way they they they split it up it's really it's really

380
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:25,320
interesting that you go into one time and then you can go into a parallel

381
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:30,840
timeline that's the same thing with a different result it's interesting and I

382
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,880
have to correct one little thing I said in my review last week and that is that

383
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:41,640
you actually do get more than the two characters in your party but they're not

384
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,560
really controllable like it's kind of like this extra characters just standing

385
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,600
off to the side and kind of fighting with me although I don't really watch

386
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,600
their hit points or anything but I just didn't want to be you know corrected in

387
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,840
my review last week because I played a lot further into it now I did check out

388
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:05,240
some of the DLC you can download right now the lightning and oh her her guy in

389
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:10,400
charge of the squadron dude I can't remember his name you can play against

390
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,240
them and I guess if you're able to beat them you can use lightning as your

391
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,260
summon summonable monster in battle but I can't beat them yet because I'm too

392
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:22,880
low a level as I guess I haven't played far enough so I'm still working away at

393
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:28,080
it I finally got to the casino in Final Fantasy 13 too so it was you know kind

394
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,680
of fun to see some of the minigames they're bringing back chocobo racing I

395
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:35,160
heard that the case if was in the game as a suitable well it but it's not it's

396
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,320
not the Kate Sith it's not the guy in the big moogle that you remember from

397
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,960
Final Fantasy 7 but it's a monster called Kate Sith in fact it's probably

398
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,980
the first monster that you'll get and probably hang on to hang on to for a

399
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,240
long time because it's a healer and it's one of the few healer monsters you get

400
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,240
and plus is a kitty and in the little special attack he goes wow and then

401
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,120
eats claw claw claw claw claw it's really funny so yeah I'm liking Final

402
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,440
Fantasy 13 too and I'm definitely gonna play this to completion that's pretty

403
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,960
much where all my gaming hours have gone when I'm not playing Wow or something

404
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,800
else I will say I randomly had an urge to play bit trip runner yesterday and

405
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,800
try to get further in that game that's the one you know it plays like the chip

406
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,960
yeah I know it's hard as hell it's like an older game it's on Steam it's where I

407
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:27,520
play it on PC I think maybe I played cannibal this week cuz I remember

408
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:35,120
yeah don't start Skyrim you'll never finish it um let's see I'm looking in

409
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,800
our chat room at chat orange launch rated calm hey Stan Stan says me too

410
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,160
loves Final Fantasy 13 to the use of enemies is the third character reminds

411
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:48,600
me of Pokemon mixed with dog fights it's an interesting way to think of that

412
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:53,440
jester Scott says by the way you need lightning I would love to get lightning

413
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,400
but I can't beat beat her yet Eric RPG says actually sky it's a 10% drop even

414
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:03,640
at 5 star oh my god I was able to beat lightning and tell her little buddy

415
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,260
joined in the fight and then I got wasted so I just I just need to level

416
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:11,080
further and grind and all that those of you that missed grinding in Final

417
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,560
Fantasy those of you that bitched about Final Fantasy 13 it's too linear and

418
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:20,600
there's no grinding it's too easy well guess what you got your wish prayers

419
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:28,600
answered enjoy grind grind grind away otherwise gaming a little bit Mario Kart

420
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:37,480
7 that's really it so let's move on and talk about some housekeeping tonight we

421
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,400
actually have some really big news in housekeeping tonight we didn't want to

422
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,760
promote this a little bit because not everybody's gonna see this is good news

423
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,440
I wish dark soccer was in the room but she's in the restroom right now but

424
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,320
that's alright we'll we'll move on anyway she can say her piece afterwards

425
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:57,040
if she needs to but it's it's pretty straightforward this is more of a

426
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:03,120
programming note and it's gonna be kind of a shift in in orange lounge radio it

427
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:08,080
is not going to affect anybody that listens to the podcast at all but it

428
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:12,360
will affect the live listeners the announcement is that we are going to be

429
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,600
ending the orange launch radio after birth and it's gonna be ending next week

430
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:21,120
next week will be the final after birth that we're gonna do and it's gonna

431
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:26,280
involve the ultimate cage match and we'll tell you more about that next week

432
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:33,520
why we're doing it I think part of us kind of creatively the the after birth

433
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,720
which which if you only are a podcast listener you don't know what it is the

434
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,120
orange on radio after birth it's kind of like after we tape the show live for

435
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:44,000
about 20 minutes afterwards we'll usually just kind of sit around and chat

436
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,520
and then we do this segment called the cage match where we play three songs and

437
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,480
it's more of a indulgence for the live listeners and we do this fortune cookie

438
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,000
message of the day and all this stuff and the cage match is a segment that

439
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,760
dates back to episode 20 of this program so we're on episode 445 and the cage

440
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,360
match dates back to episode 20 so it's it's very old segment and it's something

441
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:11,440
we kind of wanted to keep even after we made the shift to all games radio some

442
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,640
years ago but creatively unfortunately I think the after birth has lost a lot of

443
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:22,320
steam those of us here that hosts the show kind of feel like we got a we got

444
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,240
to get our cage match song we're stuck in the studio for another 20 minutes and

445
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,960
you know it's kind of it's kind of become this necessary thing we have to

446
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:35,280
do every week so and you know when creatively something's not working you

447
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,320
say okay we're gonna change it so that's what we're gonna do we're gonna change

448
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:44,160
it so we've decided to and the orange ones radio after birth and next week we

449
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,960
are gonna be saying goodbye to the cage match which has been a part of our show

450
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:52,800
for the past 425 weeks give or take a few so you know I realize our live

451
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,480
listeners may see this as oh well you don't care about your live audience

452
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,800
anymore hey that no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no it's not about

453
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:07,520
that at all think of it this way by doing that and ending the cage match it

454
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,280
opens the door for other possibilities and things we could better spend our

455
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:17,520
time with once this show is over more information on that in the coming weeks

456
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,200
but for now we hope our live listeners will understand this creative decision

457
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:26,800
and this longtime segment of our show that you know podcast listeners weren't

458
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,560
even hearing anyway so all right Kai's you know in chat says I'm gonna read

459
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,160
these Kai's you know in chat says just saying you guys are getting lazy after

460
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,520
birth is good times I think that comments a little bit unfair because you

461
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:44,640
know it's not a lazy thing to be doing a show for the past 10 years every week

462
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:53,120
but I think too you have to wait to see what the future holds I think we'll

463
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:58,000
prove you wrong hit stun says I think we need an official post show turntable FM

464
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,360
party I'd be in support of that I I have not logged on to turntable in quite some

465
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:07,600
time and I love the iPhone app and all that and I am totally in support of that

466
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:13,320
ahamkara in chat says play games after the show and stream it I've been

467
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,200
thinking about that as like a side project the whole twitch TV thing and

468
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:25,240
all that good times all right anyone want to chime in on this whole thing I

469
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:31,360
think I said my piece in the chat room but I'll say it aloud fuck you we do

470
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:36,360
this for free we do this as a service and we keep trying to think of new

471
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,880
things to make things even better so if we're getting rid of something we're

472
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,200
doing it for a very good reason not just because we don't feel like doing it so

473
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,680
fuck off but I can see well that's a strong reaction but I can see where the

474
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,240
strong reaction comes from in chat too is that you know we've been doing this

475
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:58,600
so long and then we're saying goodbye to it and it's like but wait why that's

476
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:05,400
well that's my initial reaction to uh just an accusation of overt laziness no

477
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,520
yeah and on top of that I mean Rob has a full-time job Loki has a full-time job I

478
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:17,200
go to school you know we give up our Sundays for you guys so there's nothing

479
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,040
I think wrong at all for us you know trying to think of something new some

480
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:27,200
way to innovate because nothing ever grows without a challenge and without

481
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:33,200
making small changes to it to make it grow so so just but there are no there

482
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,560
are some people in our chat that are like Brad from pop culture says

483
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:42,560
understandable and let's see Tiger Claw says so there won't be a post show of

484
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:49,680
any kind I didn't say that let's see active says nobody but one person is

485
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,000
complaining so you know I think I think for the most part people get it that

486
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,840
creatively sometimes you we don't not ending the show we're not ending the

487
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,880
show so don't know about that and there is there is something else coming yeah

488
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:06,720
so just deal with it all right I mean to be honest we don't have to do the show I

489
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,920
mean really but we do in the show we like doing the show in the show it free

490
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:17,200
up a lot of Skyrim time you know I've got design work that I'm being paid for

491
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:22,160
that I could be doing tonight but you know what I'm here doing the show all

492
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:26,120
right no worries guys all right let's move on and talk about something a

493
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:30,800
little more in gaming and we're gonna start with Loki with the video game news

494
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,160
Loki so we were talking a little bit about the Vita one of the things that

495
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:40,440
they offered in Japan was this cool UMD passport service basically if you owned

496
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:48,840
a PSP and some PSP games like UMD games and you downloaded this application or

497
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:53,060
whatever from the PlayStation Network that allowed you to kind of mark the

498
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:58,800
games that you had so then you could download them for a discount off of the

499
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,720
PlayStation Network store and be able to download them onto your Vita so it's not

500
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,720
a way to port your games for free from UMD but just a way to kind of offer you

501
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:14,160
a discount or an incentive to do that well that didn't just they just decided

502
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,880
hey you know what that's a cool service we're not bringing it over to the United

503
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:24,200
States or North America or Canada or anybody we're just meh you're not gonna

504
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,760
have it same with Europe Europe's not getting it either so unfortunately that

505
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:33,920
wonderful service they don't care I think they think that we're gonna abuse

506
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,880
it because we're you know the type of people to abuse that kind of thing

507
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:44,520
renting games or whatever I don't know how big rental is over in Japan but I

508
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:52,880
guess it's possible to be honest so not really anyone rents PSP games so oh it's

509
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:59,040
a little disappointing I guess it's disappointing it's you know there's gonna

510
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,480
be those people that are like but if you want to play a PSP game then you go get

511
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,520
your PSP but well then don't offer the service in Japan and not in other

512
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:13,400
territories there yeah there's that too um and then I'm also like you guys are

513
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:18,640
forgetting that that PSP didn't have digital distribution in the beginning so

514
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,200
those of us that were early adopters the PC or at least I'm almost positive it

515
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:28,200
didn't right it didn't for so you know longer than a year yeah it was a while

516
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,200
and like there was a lot of games I bought when the PSP first came out like

517
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,320
luminous which you know of course I'm always gonna go back to that cuz what

518
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:39,240
probably the greatest puzzle game to come out in a long time and yeah I'd

519
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:45,640
like to be able to have that on my PS Vita but granted the pain is numbed

520
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,880
significantly when you consider there's an all-new luminous game coming out so

521
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,400
it's gonna with some sounds well yeah I probably won't need the old one as badly

522
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,280
as I thought I did but okay what about Final Fantasy 4 the the collection on

523
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,560
the complete is great it's the original game and it's it's that PSP graphics

524
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,200
which are great and you couldn't download that on the marketplace at

525
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:10,480
first so of course I bought it on UMD and it's like oh damn I'd really love to

526
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:17,120
be able to have that on the Vita but I guess not so I want to buy it again so

527
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:21,440
they guarantee we'll go for the market value that it is right now exactly like

528
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:26,040
you know Final Fantasy 1 & 2 those are pretty awesome games I mean they're like

529
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,900
$9 retail now but they're probably gonna be like 15 bucks on the PlayStation

530
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,320
that's yeah that's that's kind of a bummer because now the PlayStation

531
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,400
Network kind of controls all that and you know hopefully they'll learn

532
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,400
something from steam about the deep discounting or maybe the whole

533
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,880
PlayStation Plus will throw in I think they already do right don't you get some

534
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,280
of those PlayStation do you get full PSP games free I know you get some PSN

535
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,640
Network games I don't think PlayStation PlayStation Plus is only on the

536
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,240
PlayStation 3 it's not a play oh it'll be it's a Vita thing you're gonna be

537
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,720
able to get the discounts on Vita I don't think I don't DLC certainly will

538
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:13,120
be discounted some of it so all right anyhow anything else on the UMD passport

539
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:17,760
system and all that good stuff there's ever a chance there'll be a drive no

540
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,480
there won't no they're not gonna make a drive and I don't think they should I

541
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:30,360
mean it's it's ridiculous you don't need to make a UMD drive for a PSP although

542
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:34,200
they did that with the PlayStation 2 memory cards remember they have the

543
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,240
memory card adapter that you can now do that before they you know allowed you

544
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:45,160
to use saves one thing that does kind of suck though is the backwards

545
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:49,320
compatibility games Grantha thought it was not one of the games is backwards

546
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:54,720
compatible that is so disappointing but ah but but I hope that that's because

547
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,600
that they're gonna go and fix the camera because before there was no camera

548
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:05,720
option it was one analog stick it was very difficult to play but I hope they

549
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,680
go back and fix that maybe some HD versions I'd be fine of that I can wait

550
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,520
I remember what it was I was gonna say earlier I got distracted by chat for a

551
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,920
little bit but I remember what I was gonna say earlier about UMDs notice how

552
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,920
in the complaining and the talking and all this stuff no one is talking about

553
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:30,800
the movies remember UMD movies no no one's feeling short change that the

554
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,480
movies are not gonna be playable or any of that stuff granted same thing they'll

555
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:38,680
playstation network certainly has its share of movies that they want you to

556
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,680
buy download all that well here's a thought how nice your movie's gonna look

557
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:47,160
like on that screen because they already look pretty because they have a lot of

558
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,960
digital downloads especially almost all the movies nowadays that come out like

559
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,760
on the blu-ray combo packs or whatever they have hey you can download digital

560
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:59,080
copy of the movie it's not bad isn't that all I always thought that was

561
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:03,720
restricted to the iPhone or no no it's usually it's usually iPhone they use

562
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:09,320
that Sony specially had the PSP ones but I think a lot of that they mean mp4s

563
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:14,120
kind of play on everything and they that's the format they usually use I did

564
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:20,840
not think about that so if I haven't cashed in my Tron digital Tron why is

565
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:24,840
the name escaping me right now the new one Tron legacy thank you if I haven't

566
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:28,600
cashed in my Tron legacy digital copy down the back of it because usually

567
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:39,160
it'll say PC you know PC iPod that kind of stuff and you may be able to convert

568
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:43,520
it if because a lot of the portable devices I mean Android phones and so

569
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:48,880
that they don't play you know the iPod stuff let's see I'm so glad we do the

570
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,840
show in the house Tron legacy digital copy of future feature film watch it

571
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,520
anytime anywhere on your computer and portable device works with iTunes works

572
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:05,160
with Windows Media Player I don't know you might be able to convert it somehow

573
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:13,280
but I mean there's a lot of stuff that you know supports that that's true

574
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:18,040
well Randy said F that UMDs it's all about GBA movie play our carts oh my

575
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:23,560
gosh remember those at e3 yes I do still coming to for the 3ds apparently

576
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:27,960
whatever happened to 3d movies on the 3ds that was a big thing they showed at

577
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:33,920
e3 I'm glad you mentioned that next week shut up really yeah okay there's been

578
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,840
like no press about it what 3ds movies just come out next it's not a movie it's

579
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:44,520
a game but it has the movie on it Tekken Tekken Prime or Tekken 3d Prime Edition

580
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:52,640
has the full Tekken animated movie on there in 3d that's weird that's kind of

581
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,000
cool though yeah it's just like and the good one too not the crappy live-action

582
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,520
Tekken movie hmm so that'll be something for next week that's pretty cool

583
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,800
well I just remember at e3 a couple years ago when we first saw the 3ds one

584
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,480
of the big things I remember seeing was the tangled trailer because that movie

585
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,560
wouldn't out yet and it was on the 3ds and I was like wow this is gonna be a

586
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,840
great babysitter system that you know kids and I'm and of course my mind I'm

587
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:25,520
like I want Tron on this thing yeah now haha now you're thinking about that 3ds

588
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:31,440
no I'm still not thinking about the 3ds I have Tron I'm five you have the

589
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:37,280
uber Tron with you know the original Tron on blue-gray and stuff but I don't

590
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:43,440
need three it 3d is cool in a theater 3d is cool maybe on my TV although I don't

591
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,920
have a 3d TV so I can't really speak for that I actually have seen our lobby TV

592
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:55,800
has a it's a 3d TV and that was alright but I don't need it 3d on the road I

593
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,440
don't need to watch the movie in 3d I mean it adds a little bit it's a little

594
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,600
bit more immersive but it's not like oh my god night and day so I'm fine without

595
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:10,360
3d that's why I like a lot of these 3d games I mean it's cool that the 3ds in

596
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:16,040
there like for the 3ds but I don't necessarily need it it doesn't add like

597
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:20,120
a ton of extra gameplay whereas you know that second analog stick does help quite

598
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:24,800
a bit just saying you know if I were the choose hey guess what we can make a

599
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,760
system with a second analog stick we're going to have 3d graphics yeah I'd

600
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:36,640
rather play with the second analog stick because that would be pretty useful all

601
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:42,440
right going to our chat room black will says about the Tron digital card says

602
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:47,440
check to see when it expires they expire after a few months great so I might be

603
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:52,840
screwed it's usually about a year and it's been about a year yeah Brad from

604
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:57,760
pot culture says fuck just torrent the movies well if I'm not able to get my

605
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,240
digital distribution that I bought fair and or a digital copy that I bought fair

606
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:05,800
and square I just might have to it is stupid that they expire that is kind of

607
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:11,000
dumb that it expires is that a whole is that like to prevent use bonuses I don't

608
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,600
what is the point of that it's them being assholes black will says I can't

609
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:19,480
wait for netflix to have 3d movies so I can actually see them in 3d I mean

610
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:23,880
wouldn't mind a 3d netflix after everything netflix has gone through this

611
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,800
past year I think a 3d version would be welcomed alright let's move on with some

612
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:33,240
more news we heard that Verizon is teaming up with I did did you also hear

613
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:37,040
that Disney is implementing the rental window I saw that on your Twitter

614
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,360
explain that quickly before we go on the next story what is the rental window so

615
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:44,520
to speak the rental window is basically that they limit all distributors from

616
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:55,160
selling copies to rental customers so blockbuster red box whomever cannot buy

617
00:49:55,160 --> 00:50:02,160
copies for rent this is to prevent people it doesn't prevent people because

618
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:06,760
the first sale doctrine you can't prevent people from renting movies out

619
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:12,040
but it's basically to prevent them from having the movie on release date so the

620
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:17,840
people have to go so people go into you know their local video store ago all

621
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:22,800
sad face my neutron movies and I hear I better go buy it brand new instead of

622
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:27,600
you're renting it and so they go out will be not trying to try and you should

623
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:34,360
buy when it comes out but no like okay they don't have ours needs moms all they

624
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:41,320
don't have you know Mars needs moms to mom harder so I guess electric mama Lou

625
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:48,160
so I guess I gotta go buy it brand new so my kid can watch this so and and of

626
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:53,880
course you know the idiots that you make these decisions higher up hey look when

627
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:58,360
we did that look our our sell-through sales have just spiked they're just

628
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:02,080
going through there yeah because everybody's going to retail buying

629
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,920
copies and bring it back to the rental store so yes that is going to increase

630
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,880
the amount of sales you have in your sell-through copies oh but you forgot

631
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:13,400
all the other copies that you were selling for rental that aren't there

632
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:18,960
anymore so it actually evens out or is less but still that's the decision that

633
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,960
they make that's also the decision that Warner made a while back in there now a

634
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:26,880
60-day rental window I think and that's because they hate people that rent

635
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:32,240
movies all right ahamkara in our chat room says most of the Nintendo channel

636
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,600
3d isn't good you could turn it off and it's no different looking you know

637
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:40,240
that's kind of true like there's a have you ever Loki have you ever watched some

638
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:44,320
of the stuff on the Nintendo download stuff yeah there's some really bad sketch

639
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:48,600
comedy and some stuff on there this is I watch the animated shorts or I used to

640
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,280
have it you saw automatically downloaded I was like stop stop I don't I don't

641
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:57,040
want to watch this all right look we got it we we're like 50 minutes into the

642
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,920
show we don't one story so let's move on this is a big deal because this is to

643
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:06,240
gain companies people really love me I love both these companies and isn't it

644
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:11,360
rough when you see people you love fighting isn't that hard to watch well

645
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:16,520
that's what's happening now and it's it's a court battle blizzard filed a

646
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:20,760
notice of opposition with the u.s. patent and trademark office what they're trying

647
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:26,400
to do they're trying to block valve from using the term dota now for those that

648
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:31,720
don't know dota defense of the ancients long time ago was a Warcraft 3 mod that

649
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:37,120
was super freaking popular to the extent that it went on to spawn just all these

650
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:40,920
kind of I don't want to say clone games but other types of games in that same

651
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:46,920
vein League of Legends being the huge example of that now what's interesting

652
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,320
about dota is that because it was a Warcraft III thing how did it work like

653
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:56,100
there were two guys there was one guy that started dota one guy that continued

654
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:00,320
dota I think that I could guys I so apologize if I'm fucking this up but

655
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:04,880
it's like a soap opera storyline okay I think the guy that continued dota went

656
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:10,360
to go do League of Legends the guy that started dota got hired by valve because

657
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,760
that's what valve does they see things out there in the community they hire

658
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,240
that's that's where portal came from right the whole nevacular drop yeah

659
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:24,480
hired those guys so valve does that so now valve has dota 2 coming out blizzard

660
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,720
because defense of the ancients was a Warcraft 3 mod they're doing their own

661
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:35,880
thing blizzard dota for Starcraft 2 that's coming out at some point most

662
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,360
people seem to think it's gonna launch with heart of the swarm or it's gonna

663
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:43,800
require heart of the swarm to give the next Starcraft 2 expansion kind of

664
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:48,720
something that everybody's gonna really want well we've known that this has been

665
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,760
the case for almost a year and a half or two years but blizzard is now decided

666
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:58,400
now that dota 2 is in beta testing to take issue which I can kind of you know

667
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,520
if you really want to kick them where it counts do it after the games already in

668
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:06,480
beta testing so from that strategical standpoint I assume I can see that but a

669
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,720
blizzards case quote by virtue of that use the dota mark has been firmly

670
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:15,520
associated in the mind of consumers with blizzard including to signify a highly

671
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:19,160
popular scenario or variant of one of blizzard best-selling computer games

672
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:24,120
Warcraft 3 a lot of fans are up in arms about this because they're saying

673
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:29,000
blizzard you didn't make the mod yeah and I honestly never heard of the term

674
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:34,880
until a couple days ago but you don't really follow these types of games

675
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:40,200
either to be fair I don't see who wait I'm the lore nerd for Warcraft hold on

676
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:44,360
one sec Matt the dark soccer in your mind go back three days who did you

677
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:51,280
think own dota I was honestly I was I kind of glanced at it and didn't care

678
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:57,480
okay that thought didn't come to your mind fair enough

679
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:03,320
tiger claw on our charm says blizzards version is D OTA with the periods while

680
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:07,960
valve went around that by just calling it dota 2 apparently that wasn't good

681
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:16,280
enough for blizzard valve blizzard doesn't own the I can it was created for

682
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,800
one of their games and I can see the whole Association legally I don't know

683
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,880
what standing they have I mean I gotta admit legal but I'm not a lawyer also

684
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:28,720
I'm just a sick fanboy the only way legally that blizzard can stand on it is

685
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:35,760
if they had filed a trademark on it also valves game isn't dota it's dota 2 I

686
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:43,320
mean if I want to have a superb owl party can I get away with that are we

687
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:47,240
talking about this last week all right anyhow well and this to me this almost

688
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:53,480
reminds me of monster like monster cable suing monster mini golf because as the

689
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:57,760
word monster in it oh yeah or like I think monster energy drinks does the

690
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:03,240
same thing or they suit monster energy drink I'm sorry but just because a mod

691
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:08,360
was used on your game doesn't mean you have the rights to that and that doesn't

692
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:12,000
work it doesn't work that way unless they use some mod tools that you

693
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,760
provided them I don't see how they have the you don't have the rights to that

694
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:22,280
unless they gave you the rights what is this that our pal Bobby black wolf is

695
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:26,400
sending me right now he says this is the link to the dota song by bass hunter you

696
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,560
should play this for shits and giggles what is this

697
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:35,040
did end on a job dog on a seat that I haven't a low spell I don't thought we

698
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:43,440
see the heart event and spare money they don't stop I visit the heart event and

699
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:50,160
spare money they don't stop a few lawsuits off dance party instead can we

700
00:56:50,160 --> 00:57:07,960
just dance our problems out somebody should sue this guy for being addicting

701
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:13,520
all right that same fucking melodies in like 50 goddamn songs I've heard come

702
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:22,080
out of various European territories moving I'm suing them for that melody

703
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:31,320
damn it dark Sakura save us from dance party I like to move it move it how

704
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:36,120
about some steam stuff speaking of valve yes well you know that whole business

705
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:42,320
with the steam hack it looks like they might have gotten some information for

706
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:49,360
transactions after all that happened between 2004 and 2008 so no incur

707
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:53,920
basically that was announced by Gabe Newell he said that the file had

708
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,160
usernames and email addresses and encrypted billing addresses and credit

709
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:06,000
card information but no passwords so I guess maybe your expired card might be

710
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:14,480
in trouble change your passwords anyway and to be perfectly honest it just said

711
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:20,000
he's he suggests using steam guard keep it on and my suggestion is don't put

712
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:26,520
your fucking credit card on steam I use PayPal for a reason the end but it's so

713
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:30,060
easy when you give them your credit card information I'll admit steam has my

714
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:33,040
credit card information so I'm a little nervous but also that credit card

715
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:39,960
expires very soon so yeah and honestly like my last credit card expiration date

716
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:44,880
was like 2010 yeah that's true I mean if they got information from 2008 whatever

717
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:50,920
credit card I was using then long since expired yeah so I mean as long as they

718
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:54,680
can't see what porn I bought on other websites between that time it never

719
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:59,400
hurts to be careful but don't panic in other words hey I like though that

720
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:03,240
they're being very upfront about it I mean the whole steam is awesome situation

721
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:09,360
really sucks but you know I've come to learn that the hacking is one thing and

722
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:15,200
you know PlayStation got hacked and Sony or Sony PlayStation got hacked and then

723
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:19,680
valve got hacked and you know other websites but then the information

724
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:24,880
actually being misused to steal money is another and that's Xbox which totally

725
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:28,880
denies that there has been a hacking of any sort so when choosing between this

726
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:34,400
or this I'd rather go with welp the information was hacked I know that

727
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,800
sounds really weird but think about it also use a different password on every

728
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:42,080
website that's really the best practice you have to use a different password on

729
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:46,320
every website you do and it's the only way to keep your information choice a

730
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:51,000
for the love of God your bank account password better be unique please tell me

731
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,240
your bank account password is unique and really your email password should be

732
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:58,000
unique too because to reset your password on any other website it usually

733
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,680
goes back to your email address so if any thing is going to have unique

734
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:06,640
passwords your banking and your email needs to have unique passwords right and

735
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:10,920
don't have any of your password saved yes and don't name passwords after your

736
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:15,120
kitty and don't be like who was it the president of Syria or whatever they had

737
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:19,680
their password one two three four five don't really that's the same multiple

738
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:24,340
people don't please don't do that but that's the password an idiot would put

739
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:28,160
on his luggage alright moving on

740
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:35,620
Loki so there's a big Kickstarter project featuring double fine they

741
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:40,160
decided to go ahead and put it this project on a Kickstarter to raise money

742
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:46,280
for a classic point-and-click adventure game using modern technology or modern

743
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:53,840
touch technology and it's broken all sorts of records they made their

744
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:58,600
forty thousand or four hundred thousand dollars in less than 24 hours that was

745
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:05,040
the original amount that they were looking to raise and it's already well

746
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:09,880
over a million dollars I believe 1.6 million as of today and they've still

747
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:16,520
got like 30 days to go on this it's just ridiculous it broke you know the records

748
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:20,600
on your Kickstarter and of course they're making quite a bit money off

749
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:26,720
that 5% cut they get kind of nice Kickstarter gets 5% they get 5% oh my

750
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:30,640
gosh hey they got a run they got a run their company yeah I know but I'm just

751
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:34,240
like do people know that 5% of their money goes to I guess they have to when

752
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:40,560
they click accept whether they read it or not yeah so yeah and so obviously

753
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:45,200
this game will be made there's lots of sorry I'm laughing because now I'm

754
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:49,240
thinking about that report I saw on CNN where the people at Kickstarter were

755
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:52,920
watching this double fine thing happening on the televisions and they

756
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:56,480
were like all around and they busted out champagne when it passed the million

757
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,960
dollar mark and like oh now I get why cuz they just made two hundred thousand

758
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:05,360
dollars in one fucking day or excuse me twenty thousand dollars it's still

759
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:09,960
really good yeah they've got 29 days to go and I mean you can still if you want

760
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:13,900
to pledge money for this and there's no reason I mean I can't fucking do math

761
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:21,200
50,000 yeah there's you know you can still pledge money if you want to and

762
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,840
they've got you know all the upper tier stuff sold out someone actually pledged

763
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:31,560
$10,000 or more to this there's ten people that pledge $5,000 100 to pledge

764
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:37,640
over $1,000 900 that pledges over 250 this is ridiculous but there's still the

765
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:42,240
bottom tier stuff if you pledge $15 you get a copy of the game and access to the

766
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:46,320
beta and steam as well as access to the video series and private discussion

767
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:51,080
community $30 or more you get HD download of the documentary series with

768
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:55,960
extras digital game soundtrack and all the other stuff before that and then 100

769
01:02:55,960 --> 01:03:00,520
bucks you get the original double fine adventure poster an exclusive campaign

770
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:07,440
special thanks in the games credits and all the previous stuff so you should

771
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:12,200
well check out Kickstarter period cuz they need a lot of neat stuff on there

772
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:16,680
not necessarily just video game stuff but like they had it one time and I

773
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:21,360
almost considered doing it like you could buy a set of Catan tiles that were

774
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:26,580
like etched laser etched on wood nice nice that they're really fucking

775
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:35,580
expensive but uh oh my my favorite one which I've got a I can't remember it's a

776
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:43,480
card game it's just very inappropriate that's I can remember now dark to see

777
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:46,800
you in our time says last I heard they were almost gonna break 2 million 1.6

778
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:50,280
million when I looked earlier is where they're at now yeah yeah so that fair

779
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:54,360
chunk of money this just in by the way orange launch radio is starting a

780
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:58,140
Kickstarter if you want to save the afterbirth segment I'm kidding I'm

781
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:07,500
kidding I'm kidding but seriously now I'm like what could we give away and we

782
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:12,320
can honestly do that I mean no card against humanity not in it for the money

783
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:16,200
remember guys are not enough for the money cards against humanity is the

784
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,320
thing that was a Kickstarter project that it's basically this card game

785
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:28,320
that's really bad it's it's not appropriate for most ages um did you

786
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:32,400
donate to this or did you think about donating this why not I mean I didn't

787
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:36,560
either but we were talking about this with Bobby on his show earlier before we

788
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:39,960
started tonight and he did and so we were kind of talking about the last

789
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:47,520
thing I donated money for was that humble bundle and I've played one of the

790
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:51,000
games out of that I'm not gonna buy another digital game that I'm not gonna

791
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:56,720
fucking play so I do play the games in the humble indie bundle yeah that was a

792
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,960
great deal I've played only one of them I still have all the other like but you

793
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:04,360
did good for charity this has nothing to do with charity I understand nothing to

794
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:09,000
do with charity remember that I understand that and and that's the other

795
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,640
thing too it's raised money faster than Child's Play did think about it Child's

796
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:16,240
Play did not raise a million dollars in it well I take that back they may have

797
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:20,240
at some point but over the course of three months they raised three million

798
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:24,800
well it was great if I Child's Play then comes up with some cool perks you know

799
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:29,840
to give away and I know the guys behind penny arcade probably could come up with

800
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:32,560
some cool perks and then put a Kickstarter page up I'm sure they can

801
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:38,720
get quite a bit of tension and get money raised that way and I think it's a cool

802
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:43,400
idea crowdsourcing is kind of neat and you know I could think of some ways we

803
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:50,720
could utilize that but it's just I don't know like if we like they had another

804
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:55,360
game there was another one it was by the guys that did I want to say the Tony

805
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:59,840
Hawk game or something like that like one of the Tony Hawk games or something

806
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:05,160
and they were raising money for this really terrible looking Kinect Xbox Live

807
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:09,640
arcade game where you bounce your characters around like some Steve

808
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:14,200
Pachinko looking machine and it was just terrible but they love pitching but

809
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:18,720
they're raising money for that and it's like so you're gonna raise money for

810
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:23,080
this and then you're gonna put on Xbox Live arcade and make more money because

811
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:26,640
you're not investing really any of your money because it's you're making all the

812
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:30,600
money it must be nice I mean hell if I was motivated enough to program games

813
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:34,000
and stuff and I could make a convincing Kickstarter that would be cool hey look

814
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,760
I got all my seed money now I'm gonna make some money and all I have to do is

815
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:41,760
provide some people some free codes or some extra tchotchkes then that's it

816
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:46,600
here's my honest concern and I think this is a legitimate concern to have what

817
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:51,080
if the game's bad I mean I realize the whole community is gonna be

818
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:55,140
participating and in talking about this on the forums and you know watching the

819
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:58,840
development and that part's really cool I got to give props to somebody that's

820
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:03,400
willing to lift the curtain a little bit there and show you what's back there but

821
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:07,640
I'm also a little bit like you know some sometimes community isn't always right

822
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:11,760
in their decisions you know sometimes the hardcore gamers alienate the casual

823
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:15,440
gamers and I talked about World of Warcraft did that a little bit with

824
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:19,120
that's the same with like a pre-order though I mean you put money down for a

825
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:22,960
pre-order and you get the game and it could suck mmm thing again I'm not

826
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:29,360
putting $100 down for a game I mean I I could see putting the $15 down which is

827
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:33,960
basically a game purchase and don't get me wrong this day and age so $15 for

828
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:37,960
digital game is kind of kind of expensive so it you know it better be

829
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:42,200
pretty good I beg to differ that's average for a PlayStation or Xbox game

830
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:47,480
most of them these days are 1200 points it's 15 bucks I make it ever I we like

831
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:51,560
them when they're 800 points but let's be real there has not been a 400 points

832
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:59,640
game in like four years so unless you're talking indie games because I think

833
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:07,240
indie games can go as high as 400 points so so we'll see I don't know it's just I

834
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:12,720
just don't see myself you know buying this game I'm well yeah I'll buy it if

835
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:17,120
it if the folks that are watching it say gosh this is looking greater it's a

836
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:20,120
great game or when it actually comes out it's great reviews just like any other

837
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:24,640
game but I don't know like I don't know if I but see as I was you know

838
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:29,520
mentioning on this topic earlier I might not feel that strongly about this double

839
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:33,240
fine thing but if Nintendo came out tomorrow and said hey if we can raise

840
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:36,920
$500,000 on Kickstarter we'll do killer instinct 3 I'll be like take my money

841
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:42,800
take it here you go and you're part of the problem no I'm serious here you're

842
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:48,120
part of the problem then I or Konami says we'll support rhythm rhythm fever

843
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:53,560
if you know no no if they came out and said that shit I say fuck you fuck you

844
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:59,760
fuck you I am NOT paying you a dime for a fucking game you make the game and

845
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:04,760
then I'll buy it if it's good I'm not gonna you know I'm not gonna be like oh

846
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:09,520
well I'm not gonna make games until people pay me money first yeah that must

847
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:14,400
be nice you know I'm not gonna well Konami did that remember it was beat

848
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:18,360
mania 2d x7 style yeah remember they said they were not gonna do it until

849
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:22,880
10,000 people pre-ordered the game yeah and they're fucking assholes and you see

850
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,840
what their car see what that karma did yeah where's your fucking beat mania

851
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:33,040
DDR series now oh that's right where is your god of music now it's in the

852
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:39,720
shitter because you fucking sucked it it's just like you know what you know

853
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:44,280
what the chicken style is awesome you know the cherry on the top for that

854
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:50,840
karma pie was it's a fucking rock revolution rock revolution was just

855
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:58,840
like I'm gonna take a dump on this disc right here here you go I you know what

856
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:05,200
though if you want to ask the question when did Bamani die that would be the

857
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:09,840
best answer now thankful thank thank God Bamani's seemingly making a comeback

858
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:14,160
there's a couple new arcade games I still I still say I don't give two

859
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:18,760
shits what you say Loki that rhythm fever game is actually a lot of fun on

860
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:23,000
connect no don't get me wrong they're on the path they're on the right path but

861
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:28,720
it's just it's still a ways away and I'm sorry they just take a lot of missteps

862
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:34,640
and you know dark gray nope it's flowing down the screen against a black

863
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:39,320
background not the smartest thing to do let's go to the chat room because Bobby

864
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:45,280
black wolf loves to correct me loves to correct me and says there is a 400

865
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:50,240
spacebucks arcade game a few weeks ago the scrabble plus risk combo coral

866
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:54,080
member coral that I didn't realize that was 400 points I've heard a lot of good

867
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:55,840
things about that game I think I might get it

868
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:59,440
scrabble plus risk dark soccer doesn't that sound pretty cool sounds

869
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:06,400
interesting mm-hmm all right moving on let's talk Mass Effect I know a lot of

870
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:10,680
you kids really love Mass Effect and boy Mass Effect is going to keep on giving

871
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:15,480
you know Bioware has all these studios now I mean hell Sacramento has one where

872
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:19,960
we're at even as a Bioware studio so when there's a big Bioware event man

873
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:23,880
they can get all these properties out everywhere and that's what's happening

874
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:31,600
with Mass Effect 3 there is a Mass Effect 3 tie-in called Mass Effect data

875
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:38,080
pad it's gonna be an iPad app that works with the console or PC version of the

876
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:42,520
game and the reason why I sound sketchy on this is because there's really no

877
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:46,400
details beyond that just some type of iPad interaction that works with the

878
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:49,920
game I don't know if that's like Disney it will take a picture of a something or

879
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:53,400
other on the screen and do something that's pretty much I think what it's

880
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:57,040
gonna do like read QR codes or something like that I like something like that

881
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:02,840
like you at the but I don't know you know a lot of a lot of nerds have that

882
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:08,800
stuff handy so I don't have an iPad but you know on iOS which is the other story

883
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:13,760
so not just the iPad or whatever that is but there's also Mass Effect

884
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:19,120
infiltrator this is gonna be an iPhone iPad iPod touch game it's a third-person

885
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:23,960
shooter it features certain weapon and powers from Mass Effect the whole

886
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:27,080
storyline has to do with freeing prisoners from a hostile base you know

887
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:32,480
typical space sci-fi stuff you get awards for collecting evidence of the

888
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:38,160
crimes that happen that you catch in the mission and I guess it increases your

889
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:43,440
Mass Effect 3 galaxy at war galactic readiness rating so I guess things that

890
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:47,480
you do an infiltrator can actually affect what happens in Mass Effect 3 so

891
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:50,480
that's kind of neat that they'll work together like that I imagine you kind of

892
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:55,280
tie all your accounts together through the EA website and it'll work so that's

893
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:59,760
kind of cool tie your accounts all together through the EA website get FIFA

894
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:09,520
you didn't ask for it so I it's interesting I mean I'm not super huge in

895
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:13,200
Mass Effect but I know people that are and I can't deny that Mass Effect is a

896
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,240
huge franchise that a lot of people are really excited about so I gotta admit

897
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:19,880
there are certain games where if they had like the iPad app I'd be like that's

898
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:25,000
pretty awesome so I hope it enhances the experience it isn't just a cheap cash-in

899
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:29,120
I'm not gonna pretend if they had an IS app for like a Grand Theft Auto game or

900
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:32,400
something like that I'm I might have to pick it up or like an iPad Saints Row

901
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:37,040
the third somehow like like you could control your missiles on the iPad no

902
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:43,320
that wouldn't be worth it I don't think so yeah the UAV got they got boring

903
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:49,720
pretty fast it's just much faster to use the other weapons all right release

904
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:54,120
dates coming up right after one more story from Dark Sakura well how about

905
01:13:54,120 --> 01:14:05,440
the Xbox the Xbox I've never played an Xbox the lube the ex you the ex you

906
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:11,200
explain yourself woman how about an Xbox tablet instead there in Xbox world for

907
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:18,520
April 2012 there was an announcement for a new Xbox at e3 that has a tablet of

908
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:24,840
course my thought is that this is the April issue hello it's a little early

909
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:30,000
for the April issue I think it says scans of Xbox world for April 2012

910
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:36,520
actually no because April ones are on the newsstand in March and we're getting

911
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:39,840
towards the end of February so we're getting towards the end of February

912
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:44,880
really this could be so well for the publisher we're approaching the end it's

913
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:50,760
way over there but we're on our way I shut up if I may this may also be

914
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:55,080
someone who happens to be with a publisher or something I don't know it

915
01:14:55,080 --> 01:15:04,880
says April 2012 huh huh yeah but that's when Xbox world is okay well it says

916
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:11,200
that there is a matte black media hub that is gonna have a tablet and that

917
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:18,560
it's gonna be I'm trying to see where yes they're anticipating 399 pounds yeah

918
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:23,960
this is British of course but they said that it works as a remote control with

919
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:27,280
your TV as a browser when you're on the internet has extra buttons for playing a

920
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:32,640
game or a portable display when you want to take your game with you so yeah 600

921
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:39,520
bucks roughly it's it's a rumor I'm thinking it's a troll but it better be a

922
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,200
troll because I'm looking at that picture and it shows just a tablet with

923
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:47,360
no tangible buttons and when I see that and see Xbox wants to use this as a

924
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:52,840
controller I'm like nine nine nine nine nine tangible control no no no I think

925
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:57,040
what I think what it sounds like to me is that it's a little bit of an

926
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:00,160
expansion on what they had already talked about with I think you do this

927
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:06,120
window windows phones where basically you can browse your I don't even know

928
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:09,120
what the fuck they call their little dashboard you can browse around they're

929
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:12,720
using your windows phone and you can queue up stuff like that maybe that they

930
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:17,320
add that to a tablet that's running like the windows phone OS or whatever hope

931
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:22,760
they got it they updated to like Android or something and then they can you know

932
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:26,640
have some buttons on there so that you can play like different Xbox Live arcade

933
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:31,440
games or something like that on there I could see an app maybe but isn't it

934
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:34,360
funny that this comes up this story comes up right after we were talking

935
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:38,320
about Mass Effect and how it's kind of tying into tablets well here's the other

936
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:42,200
funny thing to precursor of things to come I have to find it but there was

937
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:46,560
also the same rumor for the PlayStation 3 that they were oh wait no we talked

938
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,760
about last week but they're gonna come up with a tablet member oh yeah the

939
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:54,000
whole it had been patented or something like that right yeah but though and then

940
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,320
the patent doesn't always mean reality my response to that is you already have

941
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:04,040
some of that with the PSP can tie into the ps3 a little bit and plus the whole

942
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:08,000
god they were showing it at e3 the whole Vita and that dungeon crawler game that

943
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,240
hasn't changed its name like three times now the dungeon crawler game that's on

944
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:14,400
the Vita that you know you can that's our game and then pick it up on the ps3

945
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:19,640
and that's a hunter's alliance I think because I think they're calling it now

946
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:26,200
right yeah so I mean theoretically you can already have that technology if you

947
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:29,960
really want to use it but it's expensive because that means you have to own a

948
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:39,920
$249 Vita and a $299 PlayStation 3 so $299 $200 it has a lot cheaper than it

949
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:44,840
used to be it is but that's that's where it's at now because blu-ray players are

950
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:47,960
very cheap to came down with that technology all right let's move on we're

951
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:50,440
gonna travel around the world and talk about release dates and see what's

952
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:56,440
coming out to a game stop or a Best Buy or Walmart or whatever you like to shop

953
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:03,880
Amazon near you actually earlier this week the Nintendo 3ds pearl pink came

954

957

959
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:41,720
it's a frustrating fucking game it looks interesting but it's not very fun I'm

960
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:46,840
kind of over the Wii the Wii's just kind of sitting sad in the corner B units

961

build it for Nintendo DS see hakuoki demon of the fleeting blossom coming

962
01:18:55,960 --> 01:19:02,200

963
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:07,480
extend on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and because this week you are getting the

968
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:41,880
hit stores because people have those early bundles and to be honest they've

969
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:44,880
already been hitting stores because there's no street dates on the first

970
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:48,760

971
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:52,800

985
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:12,200

01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:25,320
because I had the digimon ones remember the original digimon that was a direct

1045
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:29,640
release from the Tamagotchi I don't know some guys might be into that in 3d and

1046
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:35,880
all you never know devi mon was a big shitter alright just a couple more news

1047
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:40,280
stories for you guys in the classic game of the week Loki so the ps3 did get

1048
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:45,560
another firmware update this week it speeds up web browsing apparently

1049
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:51,520
according to the notes for the 4.1 update also they change your account

1050
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:55,320
from the PlayStation Network account to the Sony Entertainment Network account

1051
01:26:55,320 --> 01:27:02,560
and other things and improve display speed for the browser and I believe they

1052
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:09,840
also added Dropbox support so you can use that for storing images online huh

1053
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:15,080
I didn't realize that yeah it's pretty cool some other cool stuff of course

1054
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:19,280
there was this whole play memories thing that they were teasing a little bit ago

1055
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:24,680
it's a video editing app that's gonna be part of the PlayStation 3 as well as a

1056
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:32,720
PC and mobile suite and they've included five gigabytes of storage as well that's

1057
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:39,960
going to be on a cloud-based service and it does work with you know iOS and

1058
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:45,040
Android devices and apparently you'll be able to you know edit images and videos

1059
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:51,760
and stuff like that I can't imagine the image editing on the ps3 be very easy

1060
01:27:51,760 --> 01:28:00,680
this is the controller right everyone else all right real quickly speaking of

1061
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:04,200
Sony things one of the big things that people are looking forward to on the

1062
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:10,200
PlayStation Vita or the PlayStation 3 the Final Fantasy 10 re-release now this is

1063
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:15,240
interesting because I thought we had a story on this a couple months ago that

1064
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:19,320
said Final Fantasy 10 is is a complete redo they're building it from the ground

1065
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:24,200
up and all this stuff it is it is a remake but this week it seems like

1066
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:28,840
they've gone back on that a little bit let's see this was at a China Final

1067
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:33,000
Fantasy event the Taipei game show because they were pushing Final Fantasy

1068
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:38,160
13 to squeamix producer you know we always call Square Enix squeamix here on

1069
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:42,600
the show producer Shinji Hashimoto was at answering some fan questions about

1070
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:46,280
some of the Final Fantasy games and somebody asked about hey is the

1071
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:50,920
PlayStation 3 and Vita re-release of Final Fantasy 10 is it a remake or is it

1072
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:58,200
a remaster and Hashimoto said directly it is a remaster so think like the

1073
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:02,440
Shadow of the Colossus HD thing that came out not too long ago I wouldn't

1074
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:06,680
even say it's well that wouldn't be so bad hopefully it's not like the

1075
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:11,440
Melger Solid stuff they look kind of blurry and weird now he also went so far

1076
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:15,120
to say that the screen is much prettier than the original but he didn't really

1077
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:23,040
elaborate on that whatsoever what can I do for you give me Final Fantasy 7 next

1078
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:28,040
how about first that's what all the fans are saying but I I get it though it's

1079
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:31,680
easier to do this I mean there was an excellent point that was made is that a

1080
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:34,680
lot of the stuff that was in Final Fantasy 7 was still kind of sprite based

1081
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:39,600
whereas everything in Final Fantasy 10 was full 3d so it's much easier to take

1082
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:44,720
Final Fantasy 10 and just you know assign it to the new resolution give it

1083
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:49,400
some higher res textures and you know maybe remake the menu and and go back

1084
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:52,520
into some of the things you know I think they'll do some other little things to

1085
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:56,120
sweeten the pot I'm sure maybe like a bonus summon or a bonus dungeon or

1086
01:29:56,120 --> 01:30:00,040
something else you know it's I think it'll I think it'll pay tribute well

1087
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:03,560
enough to the original I'm so I like Final Fantasy 10 I know Final Fantasy 10

1088
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:08,460
has a share of haters but I thought it was great it's still still to this day

1089
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:12,600
in my opinion has the best summon of all time Shiva of course when she comes out

1090
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:24,160
snap great so huh anyhow how about we travel down memory lane a little bit

1091
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:30,120
sounds plan later we always on the show let's take a trip down memory lane in a

1092
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:34,280
segment we call the classic game of the week where dark soccer is gonna reach

1093
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:38,800
into the vault and find a classic game she says hey why don't you remaster this

1094
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:46,120
bitches hmm back in my day we didn't have remakes and remasters we played our

1095
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:51,600
games ugly ass pixelated and we liked it ugly they were cute all right so dark

1096
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:57,720
Sakura what is the classic game of the week this week puzzle bobble yay it came

1097
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:02,900
out in America as bust a move but puzzle bobble is great and I've been playing a

1098
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:13,200
lot of it lately it came out in 1994 it's about as high as it goes this

1099
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:20,920
YouTube I'm streaming things a little quiet I love this game anyway puzzle

1100
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:25,400
bobble was a puzzle game that came out for one or two players put out by Taito

1101
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:29,680
based off of their 1986 game bubble bubble and it has the characters from

1102
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:36,240
that game you play as bub and or Bob and it's cute it's super cute I love the

1103
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:42,440
game there were two different versions of the original there was puzzle bobble

1104
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:48,720
that came out in Japan only in 1994 on a Taito B system hardware though and it

1105
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:52,200
was originally called bubble buster and then down the line there was the neo-geo

1106
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:57,480
version of puzzle bobble that was exactly the same except it was in stereo

1107
01:31:57,480 --> 01:32:03,880
and had a few different sound effects and translated text when it came out in

1108
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:09,280
the u.s. it was called a bust a move and had anti-drug and anti-literary messages

1109
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:16,640
ooh and the same title was wait a minute puzzle bottle was anti-drug are we

1110
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:20,640
talking just an FBI warning in the beginning winners don't use drugs okay

1111
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:28,400
and the title was retained for the u.s. Canada and Europe on consoles so

1112
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:34,000
basically you have different colored balls for different reason they're

1113
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:41,800
bubbles but they you have different colors and you have to turn the crank to

1114
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:50,680
launch the balls yes turn the crank to watch the balls that's what they're doing yes

1115
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:56,400
at any rate you have a little pointer and yes you does attach to a crank that

1116
01:32:56,400 --> 01:33:01,960
Bob and Bob move and you can bounce these bubbles little bubbles up to other

1117
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:07,520
bubbles and when you get three in a row touching then they pop you may have a

1118
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:11,520
bunch of one color already up there in a neat colorful pattern but it gets really

1119
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:15,000
complicated trust me I noticed that when they touch the balls together they

1120
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:26,000
explode so they go in the direct line along the pointer and as you do though a

1121
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:32,520
few more in a row then the ceiling starts to drop down when your bubbles

1122
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:38,840
hit the very bottom line then your game over if you don't know this game isn't

1123
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:47,240
crawl up from under the rock no dipping your balls below the line I think dark

1124
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:58,800
soccer is mad at me anyway which were your favorite balls the blue ones she's

1125
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:06,960
trying not to laugh she thinks she's bad she's not shut up you're a bitch at any

1126
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:12,400
rate it has really busting your balls there it has a different scoring system

1127
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:17,520
it's exponential scoring so for each that you pop in the same color they're

1128
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:21,720
worth ten points each but if you drop a bunch that are attached to that one me

1129
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:27,400
like say that you've got at the top you have like two yellow one blue one green

1130
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:31,000
you know I'll touch the yellow when you break the yellow ones everything that's

1131
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:37,600
textural balls it's good balls drop your score actually will go to 20 points and

1132
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:41,680
then 40 and then 80 so it's an exponential scoring system if you rub

1133
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:46,040
and girls together their maximum is 50,000 points that you get for clearing

1134
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:50,720
it within five seconds or less and then it drops down to zero over the next

1135
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:56,400
minute you do have two player modes are not around you just each have the arena

1136
01:34:56,400 --> 01:35:03,760
and the same arrangement but when you get a large clump broken it goes on to

1137
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:08,160
the opponent's side kind of the way that uh help you appeal works which is one of

1138
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:12,680
another one of my favorites so yeah it's bub and Bob or as they were doing in

1139
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:19,760
Japan baboon and baboon and it's their same animation from a bubble bubble

1140
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:24,840
actually closer to bubble symphony and it also has all the enemies in it so the

1141
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:33,040
red one is and I'll do both names the English name was super socket and

1142
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:39,160
Japanese name was invader the yellow one is hello balloon or pull pull there was

1143
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:44,080
a green is Willy whistle or drunk blue is bubble buster or Zen Chan purple is

1144
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:50,640
beluga or Monsta orange is quietly or Bonnie bow black is incendo or hit a

1145
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:56,840
konsu and white is stoner or my death who doesn't want to name their balls so

1146
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:59,840
for all the games that came out there are a bunch of them and I will go

1147
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:06,000
pretty much in order there was puzzle bobble puzzle bobble 2 which was called

1148
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:10,960
best to move again in the u.s. puzzle bobble 2x which I believe is the one

1149
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:15,960
that I had on Saturn puzzle bobble 3 in 1986 puzzle bobble for puzzle bottle

1205
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:03,280
to say this I'm very proud of the chatters tonight because despite

1206
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:06,800
everything that's going on in the world right now there wasn't a single person

1207
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:09,720
now of course now they're gonna say this everybody's gonna do this but there

1208
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:13,240
wasn't a single person that came in to chat tonight and said hey did you guys

1209
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:17,440
hear that Whitney Houston died because I was so waiting for that because

1210
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:21,400
inevitably when something big happens in the world that really has nothing to do

1211
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:25,080
with video games it'll get brought up anyway it's really been off and on like

1212
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:30,040
even on the radio and stuff because like today I was you know driving my wife's

1213
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:35,080
car and she has the radio tuned to be like it's not really like oldies but

1214
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:39,080
it's like the R&B station or whatever and is it that V 101 or whatever you

1215
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:44,200
want to say so I was driving to the park to take Josh to the park it's just you

1216
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:47,960
know regular music you know that's fine I'll wait home for the park all Whitney

1217
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:53,280
Houston solid Whitney Houston from like it was like three songs all Whitney

1218
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:57,400
Houston it was ridiculous obviously it's a tragic loss that it up but they all

1219
01:41:57,400 --> 01:42:01,400
sound very the same it doesn't have to stop it it doesn't really have anything

1220
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:05,720
to do with video games well she to be fair I totally have I want to dance with

1221
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:11,160
somebody and sing star so she wasn't seeing star so tip of the hat to a

1222
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:17,280
famous seeing star inspiration I guess if you want to say that all right but I

1223
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:21,600
will give a big gold star to all our chatters tonight for keeping it on topic

1224
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:25,880
you know even despite all of the unfortunate that happened with Miss

1225
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:30,080
Houston there's not really a lot of talk about the Grammys either so I know you

1247
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:39,320
little picture is not helping the rumors about c-3po sexuality because you know

1248
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:44,880
that's out there in the fanverse I'm just saying I'm just saying just saying

1249
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:50,440
all I gotta say is the one that they had a Disneyland dance-off much better than

1250
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:57,040
this shit and you know he's dancing the gaga it's he was programmed this way

1251
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:05,040
baby lol ah yeah anyways I just hope that God it's it's way better than than

1252
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:10,000
the versions because those were not good but that is supposed to be coming out

1253
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:18,480
April 3rd and so yeah some other stuff Super Mario Brothers crossover 2 is now

1254
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:22,320
on the Super Mario Brothers crossover is definitely something that's infringing

1255
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:26,040
all sorts of copyrights but hey it's a flash game it's been out there for a

1256
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:30,760
while and people play it so if you want to check it out it's at exploding rabbit

1257
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:38,160
com slash game slash Super dash Mario dash Bros dash crossover I'm sure if you

1258
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:41,880
just go explaining rabbit.com they have a link on the front page and basically

1259
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:47,080
what version 2 offers you is you know you still get the play as multiple

1260
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:53,200
characters including Mario Luigi Link Samus Simon Belmont Megaman base Bill

1261
01:45:53,200 --> 01:46:00,760
Reiser Ryu and Sophia the third from blaster master yes blaster master and

1262
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:04,800
then they all have alternate looks because you can also cycle through the

1263
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:09,960
game or they cycle randomly through versions of the levels including NES

1264
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:15,160
Super NES and Game Boy styles throughout the game as well also

1265
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:23,080
apparently demon returns super demon returns and I guess the Super Mario

1266
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:29,080
Brothers style game from the DS's retro game challenge 2 are different versions

1267
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:38,160
as well so neat and there's also a picture that shows Dr. Wily in there so

1268
01:46:38,160 --> 01:46:45,320
I don't know if you could play as him that'd be weird so that's uh that by the

1269
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:49,760
way quickly the chatters are asking for the question or asking for the Star

1270
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:54,040
Wars dance party pictures see all Lincoln yeah Lincoln and then Rama can

1271
01:46:54,040 --> 01:46:56,600
get him up on the tumbler for the podcast listeners I want to see it too

1272
01:46:56,600 --> 01:47:02,440
disturbing it is a little disturbing just a warning don't click and then

1273
01:47:02,440 --> 01:47:07,600
finally apparently there's a rumor that certain and I mean this is probably

1274
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:15,600
gonna be happening certain people that put stuff on the App Store are using

1275
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:22,120
bots to automatically download their games and boost their rankings in the

1276
01:47:22,120 --> 01:47:29,640
App Store to get more people to download it I mean I don't even have to really

1277
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:33,120
look into that to know that that's probably true I mean there's people that

1278
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:38,680
put artificially high review scores to boost their reviews and stuff so why not

1279
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:41,960
now is a great time to mention if you want to leave your totally legitimate

1280
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:45,480
five-star reviews for Orange Lounge Radio on the iTunes Store we'd really

1281
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:48,480
appreciate it by the way click the subscribe button four or five times

1282
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:53,640
while you're there I'm kidding maybe I'm not about the five-star reviews though

1283
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:58,280
so all right I I'm not I would not be surprised all by the way looking at some

1284
01:47:58,280 --> 01:48:01,000
of those games that are in the top 20 like you really look at like how did

1285
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:04,520
this get here really this game is beating Angry Birds and where's my water

1286
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:10,040
and the stuff you expect to see in the top 10 really interesting speaking of

1287
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:16,520
games you expect to see in the top 10 on the iOS store tiny tower look hate on

1288

1297
01:48:55,280 --> 01:49:01,560

1298
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:04,200
you asked I'm gonna fire up my tiny tower right look at this I haven't

1299
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:09,240
touched this crack in a long time dark soccer did you ever get us sucked into

1300
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:12,880
tiny tower for a little yeah I stopped you finally stopped I stopped it a while

1301
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:19,480
back good for you let's see my tower is I do not want to get the plant game

1302
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:27,080
leave me alone let's see 86 stories tall I was close and my 86th floor for the

1303
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:34,280
record is the nerd cave apartments very cool very cool right above the 85th

1304
01:49:34,280 --> 01:49:37,280
floor volleyball because I don't know who puts volleyball on the 85th floor

1305
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:43,520
but there you go huh Bahmani fans are looking forward to a new arcade game

1306
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:49,720
called sound voltex booth this is gonna be playable at the AOU 2012 amusement

1307
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:54,120
Expo it's kind of a new Bahmani game from Konami and there's some new songs

1308
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:57,880
that have been announced for it called Zephyr remix so you might remember

1309
01:49:57,880 --> 01:50:01,880
Zephyr from one of the old DDR games a red zone remix and this is gonna be very

1310
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:05,400
cool a vampire killer remix because as you know vampire killer is one of the

1311
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:09,760
big songs from Castlevania so we like it when the Bahmani series kind of jacks

1312
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:14,640
music from other Konami games because let's face it Konami music was awesome

1313
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:21,720
also making its way to AOU an arcade version of dance evolution a new version

1314
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:25,240
of you beat as well and I didn't know this series was still going guitar

1315
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:30,800
freaks and drum mania xg3 I had no idea that series is still alive and kicking

1316
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:37,360
but there you go lastly from me Nintendo of America has hired a new spokesperson

1317
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:41,880
and following in the footsteps of what Carrie Underwood has been a Nintendo

1318
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:46,840
spokesperson Beyonce has been a Nintendo spokesperson who could live up to those

1319
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:54,640
great great musicians how about Oogie Oogie is a Jack Russell Terrier that's

1320
01:50:54,640 --> 01:50:59,040
right Nintendo has hired a dog to be their next pose person now to be fair

1321
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:03,400
this dog is very famous because this dog appears in the movie the artist which is

1322
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:07,080
like you know the movie they all say is gonna win the Oscar right I haven't seen

1323
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:10,240
the movie it apparently the dog plays one of those like way too cute roles

1324
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:14,600
that you know it's very memorable and what game will he be pimping guesses

1325
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:20,580
guesses Nintendogs of course Nintendogs we have something to say about that a

1326
01:51:20,580 --> 01:51:28,160
second and and and the pearl pink 3ds Oh for the record I found in the

1327
01:51:28,160 --> 01:51:33,640
Nintendogs plus cats in the clearance Bennett fries nice how much 14 bucks I'm

1328
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:37,760
not surprised they need to fucking sell those they probably have like tons on

1329
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:44,840
their shelves hey this is just Nintendogs the end there's no cats yeah

1330

are I think neo gaff forms I think and you know what though yes it is but I

1339

01:52:45,680 --> 01:52:49,120
on this but I can't be why because little big planet seriously is like the

1341
01:52:49,120 --> 01:52:52,240

meat there goes that tail there they go they're on out of here the chatters are

1368

talking about the Rick roll Akuma JP says oh this is the end of olr that was

1369
01:55:23,200 --> 01:55:26,080
the moment we jump we jump the shark when we Rick rolled all the listeners

1370
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:32,560
there let's see stand in our chat room says Rob should do a karaoke version of

1371
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:35,560
the Rick roll song and use his re-recording as a soundbit for the show

1372
01:55:35,560 --> 01:55:41,680
when he wants to fuck sound with fuck around with the audience um no act

1373
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:50,280
deaf in our chat room says forever alone see what he did there forever alone back

1374
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:56,080
to some news Loki all right so the Skyrim creation kit came out this week

1375
01:55:56,080 --> 01:56:03,960
with the steam packs and stuff they have a high-resolution texture pack and also

1376
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:13,000
there is a portal cameo apparently you can download an add-on that creates the

1377
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:18,320
space core visiting your game it crashes into it really just goes to show glados

1378
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:25,720
makes everything better and and space space core can be used to craft a helmet

1379
01:56:25,720 --> 01:56:32,240
that looks like one of the cores as well that is so awesome it really should have

1380
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:35,560
a thing on the PC where then once you do that quest you get like a costume in

1381
01:56:35,560 --> 01:56:42,880
portal 2 for the little dudes and co-op you know there's also a rumor thanks to

1382
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:46,920
someone that was digging around some of the console commands that there's a

1383
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:53,400
quest that's tied to all that too that they haven't unlocked yet that's awesome

1384
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:59,400
um some other cool stuff I want to see our eyes I saw on there they had a mod

1385
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:04,160
that someone made that it was a giant horse and a bunch of people like you

1386
01:57:04,160 --> 01:57:07,720
know whacking at it with you know swords and stuff like that and they named you

1387
01:57:07,720 --> 01:57:11,760
know Bethesda and valve and stuff like that and it was the arrow and the knee

1388
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:15,640
thing you know they're beating a dead horse huh

1389
01:57:15,640 --> 01:57:22,440
Wow okay that's some intellectual humor there right but one of the things so one

1390
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:26,160
of the most popular mods that's actually available on this creation kit service

1391
01:57:26,160 --> 01:57:31,020
is something that removes that arrow in the need line from the game so that you

1392
01:57:31,020 --> 01:57:36,120
don't have to ever hear that brilliant now the interesting thing about this is

1393
01:57:36,120 --> 01:57:40,360
that modding was being done a long time before this even came out yeah now it's

1394
01:57:40,360 --> 01:57:44,400
like you know officially embraced but if I know this because I was playing I was

1395
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:48,200
what I wasn't playing I was watching Alan play Skyrim and he zoomed his

1396
01:57:48,200 --> 01:57:52,440
character out I'm like Alan why is your person not wearing any clothes

1397
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:56,360
whatsoever I can see her titties I can see her titties and I can see her butt

1398
01:57:56,360 --> 01:58:03,920
and Alan's just like no this was legitimately Alan's reaction oh I knew I

1399
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:09,440
forgot to put the armor on I am playing possibly one of the sluttiest games of

1400
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:15,040
Skyrim ever everyone is modded to be like not naked but just and they're in

1401
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:18,960
you know Norway or whatever they all look very cold but yeah everyone's very

1402
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:24,040
sexy and it's some of the some of the male armors that I have have the back

1403
01:58:24,040 --> 01:58:26,760
piece missing so they're just their asses hanging out and I'm like this is

1404
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:30,680
hot and they're beating on the dragon like with this ass hanging out yeah but

1405
01:58:30,680 --> 01:58:34,520
there's a lot of like stuff that you could do but it required you to move

1406
01:58:34,520 --> 01:58:38,000
files and something that the creation kit kind of simplifies all that with

1407
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:42,120
they have a launcher and you basically okay I want this this this this go and

1408
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:49,520
that's why they for anyone playing Skyrim on PC you absolutely have to get

1409
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:55,840
at least sky UI it's a complete UI an inventory replacer and also I think it's

1410
01:58:55,840 --> 01:59:00,800
called categorized favorites menu it completely changes the UI which I hated

1411
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:04,520
originally and it's like a different game super awesome

1412
01:59:04,520 --> 01:59:10,600
all right unannounced Alan cameo thank you no don't be don't apologize it's

1413
01:59:10,600 --> 01:59:13,360
like the minute he heard Skyrim he's like I should come out and make a

1414
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:19,120
sandwich I should take a break from Skyrim to go talk about Skyrim right hey

1415
01:59:19,120 --> 01:59:24,920
I heard you like Skyrim so here's some Skyrim while you're sky rimming I really

1416
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:30,440
do wanna I want to get it for my laptop here but I'm playing it on my PC or my

1417
01:59:30,440 --> 01:59:34,920
PSR no kids read that 360 right now I love that they did the higher resolution

1418
01:59:34,920 --> 01:59:39,800
textures I wish I wish they had that like you know how the outfield through I

1419
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:44,120
understand that for PC oh but I said yeah you know how like battlefield 3 had

1420
01:59:44,120 --> 01:59:48,240
a thing where you can install high-res textures to your hard drive I wish they

1421
01:59:48,240 --> 01:59:52,320
have that for like the 360 that would be pretty awesome I understand why they

1422
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:55,880
don't but you know Tiger Claw in our chat room says I'm sure the furries are

1423
01:59:55,880 --> 01:59:58,600
messing around with the Skyrim mods you'd be surprised the stuff you can

1424
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:04,280
find and it's not safe for work so basically someone has turned Skyrim in

1425
02:00:04,280 --> 02:00:07,080
his second life am I understanding this correctly

1426
02:00:07,080 --> 02:00:13,200
act-def says I want Skyrim so I can mod it with my little pony stuff I you know

1427
02:00:13,200 --> 02:00:17,560
they have that already as much as I I love having Skyrim on the PlayStation

1428
02:00:17,560 --> 02:00:20,720
3 is gonna use my controller and all that I have to admit I am somewhat

1429
02:00:20,720 --> 02:00:27,780
starting to regret not getting it on PC the minute I saw that macho man dragon

1430
02:00:27,780 --> 02:00:34,640
mod if you had a J tag you can do that well wasn't the PlayStation supposed to

1431
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:38,960
get some of the popular community mods at some point yeah yeah they had that

1432
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:42,280
whole steam integration think that they use for one game that was fucking awesome

1433
02:00:42,280 --> 02:00:47,920
I think though I think but we now that modding is officially embraced and now

1434
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:51,160
that things can be officially signed off by Bethesda maybe that's a possibility

1435
02:00:51,160 --> 02:00:56,580
down the line I don't know maybe not gonna happen I don't know never say

1436
02:00:56,580 --> 02:01:01,800
never there'll be a fee but never say never and well the other thing I was

1437
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:08,560
gonna say is you know I don't know if you saw but like they had a whole a I

1438
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:14,280
don't know what they called it was a Bethesda kind of hey team members make

1439
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:19,400
whatever you want during a week and then show us what you have for Skyrim so they

1440
02:01:19,400 --> 02:01:22,960
were able to make whatever mod they want and they came up with a whole bunch of

1441
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:27,280
cool shit that they could have could have thrown in there but oh we couldn't

1442
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:31,380
give them another week to do what they want you know because that would be you

1443
02:01:31,380 --> 02:01:37,800
know too awesome they have like Spears they had a giant enemy crab yeah and

1444
02:01:37,800 --> 02:01:44,160
giant enemy crab all sorts of you know improvements seasonal changes stuff like

1445
02:01:44,160 --> 02:01:48,080
that it's just amazing Lee there's some silence to one in our

1446
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:55,320
chat room says Oda Ving is rainbow bright best mod right there what I guess

1447
02:01:55,320 --> 02:02:01,120
you can change one of the characters in a rainbow bright why have naked people

1448
02:02:01,120 --> 02:02:09,320
when you can have 80s cartoon nostalgia why not have both you're sick well I'm

1449
02:02:09,320 --> 02:02:12,120
not saying rainbow brain has to be naked but you can have naked people and you

1450
02:02:12,120 --> 02:02:15,640
can have rainbow bright I don't know I don't know I feel awkward this is an

1451
02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:19,160
awkward covers I want to be able to have all these different dragons like I want

1452
02:02:19,160 --> 02:02:22,200
to have a macho man dragon I want to have these you know my little pony

1453
02:02:22,200 --> 02:02:25,280
dragon I want to have I don't know what other dragons they have out there and

1454
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:29,040
you know maybe you know maybe a family got Peter Griffin dragon or something

1455
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:34,480
like that or I want to have a mod that makes one of my companions Loki and he

1456
02:02:34,480 --> 02:02:38,160
always just yells he's really like he always gets really irritated like why

1457
02:02:38,160 --> 02:02:43,240
are you doing that and then it kids like shout and they can shout and knock

1458
02:02:43,240 --> 02:02:49,640
people away I'd be awesome all right I don't know why Loki didn't have this

1459
02:02:49,640 --> 02:02:52,360
story because it's more relevant to his interest but I'll read it and then Loki

1460
02:02:52,360 --> 02:02:57,000
can react to it eat sleep play who is the developer behind twisted metal which

1461
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:00,120
you know remember the series was like big back in the day and now it's all

1462
02:03:00,120 --> 02:03:03,440
nostalgic against I don't even know what they're doing with this game to be honest

1463
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:07,840
there's a there's a new one coming out like what this week I do want to get it

1464
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:13,440
but we'll see maybe I'll get it well according to the Salt Lake City Tribune

1465
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:18,720
David Jaff is not with eat sleep play anymore he left the company and he's off

1466
02:03:18,720 --> 02:03:25,080
to pursue casual games yes that worked so well the last time he responded and

1467
02:03:25,080 --> 02:03:29,800
called it highly exaggerated but he didn't deny that he left so apparently

1468
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:34,120
there's been reductions and all this stuff David Jaff did confirm that

1469
02:03:34,120 --> 02:03:38,000
following the release of twisted metal he is going to step away from eat sleep

1470
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:42,760
play there have been layoffs these this affects the offices in Utah which is

1471
02:03:42,760 --> 02:03:48,760
interesting because David Jaff lives in California but he did mention that the

1472
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:54,240
directing a game from a distance and all that did take its toll so that's not

1473
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:58,640
good when the game I mean well I don't know I it's easy to sit here and say oh

1474
02:03:58,640 --> 02:04:02,680
that looks bad but at the same time it's also very common in the industry when a

1475
02:04:02,680 --> 02:04:07,800
game is done for there to be layoffs so but I guess this means they aren't

1476
02:04:07,800 --> 02:04:13,520
starting work on a sequel right away he said there's gonna be no DLC zero DLC

1477
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:17,160
for it interesting I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing I

1478
02:04:17,160 --> 02:04:19,720
mean part of me is like well doing good it's all on the disc but then I'm like

1479
02:04:19,720 --> 02:04:22,320
oh wait maybe it's bad because that means they're just putting it out there

1480
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:26,400
yeah there's gonna be aside from like I think the pre-order bonus that you can

1481
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:32,120
get you know for me a prior in the game aside from that there is going to be no

1482
02:04:32,120 --> 02:04:37,280
DLC for twisted mill none they're just sticking around long enough to do like

1483
02:04:37,280 --> 02:04:42,400
any game balancing and bugs that may they've they may not have caught and

1484
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:51,520
that's it once that patch is done they're done interesting all right well

1485
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:56,720
there's that so we'll see what this game has in store I don't know I'm not

1486
02:04:56,720 --> 02:05:00,400
hearing good things about it which is kind of disappointing Loki you're still

romance that is pulled off in a convincing manner not something where

1511
02:06:51,520 --> 02:06:55,160
the characters are driven by wanting to engage in hot monkey sex rather a game

1512
02:06:55,160 --> 02:06:58,280
where the characters are motivated by wanting to engage in a truly enriching

1513
02:06:58,280 --> 02:07:03,800
enriching romantic relationship or be a game to play while drunk a game that is

1537
02:09:09,800 --> 02:09:13,880
entertainment the get the chatters are kind of agreeing with the Catherine

1538
02:09:13,880 --> 02:09:22,320
selection okay this is from the ECA put out a call to action to discover state

1539
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:27,920
laws relating to EULA they used some of the verbiage from my previous inquiry to

1540
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:31,720
Maryland's consumer protection office blows what appears to be another canned

1541
02:09:31,720 --> 02:09:35,360
response and only the first two sentences seem remotely related to my

1542
02:09:35,360 --> 02:09:40,260
email what makes this cool is letter I sent to OLR a couple of months which

1543
02:09:40,260 --> 02:09:44,960
Jamie read was used as a basis for the official ECA letter you see I confirmed

1544
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:48,120
that they liked parts of the letter enough to include in their letter this

1545
02:09:48,120 --> 02:09:51,660
is the first time I ever influenced something so countrywide but also Canada

1546
02:09:51,660 --> 02:09:56,400
except of course OLR mailbag which is clearly worldwide the goal of this

1547
02:09:56,400 --> 02:09:59,580
letter-writing campaign is to establish what the current laws for each state are

1548
02:09:59,580 --> 02:10:03,880
and then maybe we can start talking about changing it I suggest sending the

1549
02:10:03,880 --> 02:10:08,400
ECA letter to your state legislators as well as the Attorney General of your

1550
02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:12,480
respective state this may boil down to actually having to hire a business law

1551
02:10:12,480 --> 02:10:21,600
lawyer to find out and that's from rubber so his email was used in the his

1552
02:10:21,600 --> 02:10:26,840
letter was basically turned into the form letter for the ECA go you you a

1553
02:10:26,840 --> 02:10:35,860
celebrity a winner is you you like Whitney I mean stop it right now party

1554
02:10:35,860 --> 02:10:41,840
fell okay we have two emails left two more emails shut up I'm the one reading

1555
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:47,880
them I've been seeing a lot of forum members upset at Sony not bringing the

1556
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:51,760
UMD transfer program to North America forgive me if I'm oversimplifying this

1557
02:10:51,760 --> 02:10:55,680
or misunderstanding something they're upset because they have to pay Sony to

1558
02:10:55,680 --> 02:10:59,720
repurchase the content they already bought on UMD as Vita digital contact

1559
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:02,320
instead of having to pay Sony to repurchase the contact they already

1560
02:11:02,320 --> 02:11:07,800
bought on UMD as Vita digital content well they wanted the discount I'll be it

1561
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:12,840
for slightly less in some cases if the UMD game has a digital version and the

1562
02:11:12,840 --> 02:11:17,320
publisher is participating as for me I'm not really in the market for another

1563
02:11:17,320 --> 02:11:21,240
handheld quite yet I did get a PSP for Christmas been on my list for a while

1564
02:11:21,240 --> 02:11:24,800
mostly to check out games that aren't on ps3 like the Powerstone collection and

1565
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:28,480
before that replaced my iPod classic when it's hard drive gave out with a

1566
02:11:28,480 --> 02:11:33,960
touch so I doubt I'll be getting a Vita or 3ds anytime soon stay staying Robert

1567
02:11:33,960 --> 02:11:39,740
M all right and last email I have like two UMD games anyways because I sold the

1568
02:11:39,740 --> 02:11:43,280

but we also have a PSP so greetings olr it's your friendly neighborhood turtle I

1571
02:11:54,680 --> 02:11:58,160
have a somewhat odd question please don't take this the wrong way your show

1572
02:11:58,160 --> 02:12:02,240
is my absolute favorite among video game podcasts hence my question can you

1573
02:12:02,240 --> 02:12:07,480
mention any other video game podcasts that you like or listen to the caveat I

1574
02:12:07,480 --> 02:12:11,920
want to know about other shows besides what's on the all games network I used

1575
02:12:11,920 --> 02:12:15,400
to like Derek but there's way too much cursing for my liking why do I like oh

1576
02:12:15,400 --> 02:12:19,760
why do I ask all our this question wait a minute though I do like oh alert I know

1577
02:12:19,760 --> 02:12:24,640
I was gonna say hold on cuz we curse a lot on this show so that I okay okay I

1578
02:12:24,640 --> 02:12:33,160
need to step it up what the fuck is your problem dude well I'm a carpenter and

1579
02:12:33,160 --> 02:12:37,000
choose to work by myself all day and need good stuff to listen to which means

1580
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:40,600
that every Monday morning I start out my week with olr but by lunch I'm out of

1581
02:12:40,600 --> 02:12:45,280
video game related material any shows that you'd like I'm sure to like keep up

1582
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:48,880
the best podcast on air you guys are a great way to start out each week also

1583
02:12:48,880 --> 02:12:52,320
being on the right coast I never knew what pinkberry is but after looking at

1584
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:56,720
their website I am extremely jealous you guys are awesome your loyal turtle in

1585
02:12:56,720 --> 02:12:59,720
Philly serious turtle it's sort of God we need to start charging for all the

1586
02:12:59,720 --> 02:13:04,840
product placement we just give away on this show thank me um well thank you I

1587
02:13:04,840 --> 02:13:07,600
mean that's that's quite the compliment I don't see that as a negative at all

1588
02:13:07,600 --> 02:13:10,480
that they're looking at us for recommendations for other shows because

1589
02:13:10,480 --> 02:13:15,880
I'm looking at my like the ultimate compliment see here's the thing I listen

1590
02:13:15,880 --> 02:13:19,400
to a lot of stuff that's not video game related whatsoever and the stuff that is

1591
02:13:19,400 --> 02:13:24,160
video game related is kind of all game shows yeah you mentioned Derek's dead

1592
02:13:24,160 --> 02:13:26,880
pixel a lot I think that's what he was talking about that because alive I you

1593
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:29,960
know that's a good I like it I don't think there's that I like fantastic

1594
02:13:29,960 --> 02:13:36,200
forum uh-huh I I really like video game outsiders yeah and they they have a they

1595
02:13:36,200 --> 02:13:40,720
have a rhythm very similar to ours um not so much lately I think they I think

1596
02:13:40,720 --> 02:13:44,040
they've been challenged because I think the hosts are starting to kind of go

1597
02:13:44,040 --> 02:13:48,320
their own ways but when they're together it's a good time and John does his best

1598
02:13:48,320 --> 02:13:55,240
to keep it together I listen to Horde house well Horde house no comment right

1599
02:13:55,240 --> 02:13:59,880
now but there there's gonna be some things changing I think um let's see

1600
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:04,680
other video game podcasts of course Bobby black wolf of course that's just a

1601
02:14:04,680 --> 02:14:09,040
given we like him but he has an updated podcast feed in a while

1602
02:14:09,040 --> 02:14:12,960
naughty boy so even if I told you to listen to him you couldn't get his

1603
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:19,040
newest shows stuff that's off the all games network there's not a lot of video

1604
02:14:19,040 --> 02:14:22,600
game podcasts that I've actually see here's the thing are you well I try to

1605
02:14:22,600 --> 02:14:25,880
listen to others and I don't like them so I don't want to name them but there's

1606
02:14:25,880 --> 02:14:29,200
one in particular I really tried to listen to and I just and it's an

1607
02:14:29,200 --> 02:14:32,400
independent show so that's what I really want to support other independent shows

1608
02:14:32,400 --> 02:14:38,280
but we'll say it's a it was a very slickly produced independent show and

1609
02:14:38,280 --> 02:14:43,400
the person behind it does a lot of podcasts on iTunes but I just wasn't

1610
02:14:43,400 --> 02:14:49,440
in um it's a video podcast but I guess so that wouldn't really work but I like

1611
02:14:49,440 --> 02:14:56,000
occasionally watching episodes of the Ben Heck show well I'll throw on some of

1612
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:00,920
the video game YouTube ones when I when I was at work I would check out the

1613
02:15:00,920 --> 02:15:08,080
angry video game nerd on my phone just by plugging in on YouTube and I like

1614

history that was a really freaking good one and even though the the guy sounds a

1650
02:17:54,680 --> 02:17:59,760
little too posh for my taste but other than that it's a really good one you

02:21:15,640 --> 02:21:19,560
driving slowly it got to the point we drove around the parking lot twice

1685
02:21:19,560 --> 02:21:23,840
couldn't find a place to park went up to the second floor of the parking

1686

1697
02:22:15,480 --> 02:22:19,400

1698
02:22:19,400 --> 02:22:23,320
skype line coming up very soon Twitter topics as well tons of fun stuff coming

1699
02:22:23,320 --> 02:22:26,680
up very very very very soon Loki yeah I was gonna say fuck you to your parking

1700
02:22:26,680 --> 02:22:31,860
lot too cuz I have a park in like the mill nowhere the hike back to my car if

1701
02:22:31,860 --> 02:22:38,560
I remember where it is so call duty elite it's pretty popular for Activision

1702
02:22:38,560 --> 02:22:45,720
they've have 7 million users using the elite service on the 1.5 million have

1703
02:22:45,720 --> 02:22:52,080
actually paid the you know $60 for or $50 I think it is for all the free well

1704
02:22:52,080 --> 02:22:57,920
plenty of the paid for the download content so $50 times 100 or 1.5 million

1705
02:22:57,920 --> 02:23:04,800
times that's a lot of fucking money 75 million dollars and people thought who

1706
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:08,280
would want to sign up for this service well to be honest if you're gonna pay

1707
02:23:08,280 --> 02:23:12,920
for the download content you're actually saving money with that service and if

1708
02:23:12,920 --> 02:23:16,260
you play a lot of Call of Duty that might be worth it to you I mean the

1709
02:23:16,260 --> 02:23:20,560
maps don't look bad I just don't play Call of Duty modern warfare 3 so I don't

1710
02:23:20,560 --> 02:23:25,920
use the service at all now I don't think it ties in with modern warfare so the

1711
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:33,880
first one it does it looks like it's doing well for them they made lots of

1712
02:23:33,880 --> 02:23:37,400
money do you are they gonna do another one of those Expos this year like they

1713
02:23:37,400 --> 02:23:40,560
did last year they might I don't know this didn't that do really well for him

1714
02:23:40,560 --> 02:23:44,440
too because there's no BlizzCon this year but there might be the whole Call

1715
02:23:44,440 --> 02:23:48,840
of Duty con or what did they call that like the I forget the name somebody in

1716
02:23:48,840 --> 02:23:53,080
shadow yell it out but they did like a day long event remember so I could see

1717
02:23:53,080 --> 02:23:58,240
them I mean I could see them doing that so because it worked out you know pretty

1718
02:23:58,240 --> 02:24:02,520
well for them of course there's gonna be another call it yeah I saw yeah they

1719
02:24:02,520 --> 02:24:05,120
announced that they're gonna make another Call of Duty game you don't even

1720
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:09,040
have to put that in the fucking you do not have to announce that at all that it

1721
02:24:09,040 --> 02:24:14,640
was part of their you know their financial report or something like that

1722
02:24:14,640 --> 02:24:17,200
that they're making new Call of Duty game of course they're gonna fucking

1723
02:24:17,200 --> 02:24:20,720
make a new Call of Duty game it's news when they say we're not making the Call

1724
02:24:20,720 --> 02:24:25,800
of Duty game we're not having a BlizzCon I mean it's just you know you don't even

1725
02:24:25,800 --> 02:24:28,680
need to report that people just make the assumption that there's gonna be a new

1726
02:24:28,680 --> 02:24:32,640
Call of Duty game coming out speaking of that Activision Blizzard earnings call

1727
02:24:32,640 --> 02:24:35,680
that happened this week very surprising that they announced there's no release

1728
02:24:35,680 --> 02:24:39,280
date still for Diablo 3 which we thought for sure we'd have that by the end of

1729
02:24:39,280 --> 02:24:42,960
next month but now it's looking like no cute summertime Q2 is what they're

1730
02:24:42,960 --> 02:24:46,840
saying if America will Starcraft not a Starcraft

1731
02:24:46,840 --> 02:24:52,320
probably buggy Starcraft I'm in the beta it's great well then I they just hate

1732
02:24:52,320 --> 02:24:58,680
you clearly Starcraft is you know launched in the end of July so that was

1733
02:24:58,680 --> 02:25:05,720
kind of an odd time for it I mean less yeah no no date well speaking of Diablo

1734
02:25:05,720 --> 02:25:09,980
3 my next story happens to be about Diablo 3 Bashiach who's the community

1735
02:25:09,980 --> 02:25:14,120
manager over at Blizzard was answering some questions and it wasn't about

1736
02:25:14,120 --> 02:25:18,640
Warcraft this time it was about Diablo 3 they say Diablo 3 it is still slated for

1737
02:25:18,640 --> 02:25:22,720
2012 but now they're saying that Diablo 3 is only going to support up to four

1738
02:25:22,720 --> 02:25:27,160
players even though there is five classes now that's four player co-op

1739
02:25:27,160 --> 02:25:32,680
they haven't said anything about a five player mode in the game Bashiach said

1740
02:25:32,680 --> 02:25:35,520
that Blizzard is not looking into it and they're not going to expand their player

1741
02:25:35,520 --> 02:25:40,680
cap no idea as to why they did that interesting because in World of Warcraft

1742
02:25:40,680 --> 02:25:46,400
you have if I'm not mistaken you have 10 classes and raids are 10 people or 25 or

1743
02:25:46,400 --> 02:25:50,680
you know but most you know the end game content is geared towards that although

1744
02:25:50,680 --> 02:25:55,400
you would find very very very few raid groups that have one of each class very

1745
02:25:55,400 --> 02:26:01,320
few Diablo 3 also will not have built-in voice chat at launch Blizzard wants to

1746
02:26:01,320 --> 02:26:06,360
make sure the voice chat is going to be worth it the wow voice chat leaves a lot

1747
02:26:06,360 --> 02:26:11,200
to be desired so it turned a lot of people to you know team speak ventrilo

1748
02:26:11,200 --> 02:26:15,640
mumble so Diablo 3 is going to have to do the same thing they're also one of

1749
02:26:15,640 --> 02:26:19,120
the thing Diablo 3 is not going to be getting any more visual treatment than

1750
02:26:19,120 --> 02:26:23,040
what you're already seeing there is no higher resolution textures in the final

1751
02:26:23,040 --> 02:26:26,280
game that's the official word from Bashiach I still thought the game looked

1752
02:26:26,280 --> 02:26:30,600
good enough on look in fact to look great on the beta so I don't think they

1753
02:26:30,600 --> 02:26:33,920
necessarily need to make it that much better you know again part of the charm

1754
02:26:33,920 --> 02:26:37,520
of Diablo is that you know be able to be played on a variety of systems if you

1755
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:40,680
want to be able to find four people to co-op with I'm still really looking

1756
02:26:40,680 --> 02:26:44,160
forward to Diablo 3 despite all this I just wish it would come out already I

1757
02:26:44,160 --> 02:26:47,520
get a free copy because I signed the Blizzard blood pact for World of

1758
02:26:47,520 --> 02:26:53,280
Warcraft because I have problems few more news stories for you guys and then

1759
02:26:53,280 --> 02:26:57,360
the Twitter topics in the skype line dark soccer well did you ever watching

1760
02:26:57,360 --> 02:27:03,240
that pac-man show in the 80s I can I do that's where pac-man had legs right yeah

1761
02:27:03,240 --> 02:27:07,560
yes I do remember that well I also the pac-land game was based off of that too

1762
02:27:07,560 --> 02:27:12,880
and I used to also watch that in cupid but Hannah Barbara put it out well

1763
02:27:12,880 --> 02:27:18,680
they're four seasons coming out on DVD it's a two-disc 13 episode collection

1764
02:27:18,680 --> 02:27:25,560
where it has inky and blinky pinky Clyde and Sue and mesmer on who wants to take

1765
02:27:25,560 --> 02:27:34,200
over pac-land and has vampire pakula and all kinds of yeah I forgot about

1766
02:27:34,200 --> 02:27:38,040
pac-land that was a really interesting game it was kind of like a side

1767
02:27:38,040 --> 02:27:43,720
scroller pac-man I have it yeah no I've it's in those Namco collections like the

1768
02:27:43,720 --> 02:27:47,720
you know the ones that tend to come out on every system but I used to I also

1769
02:27:47,720 --> 02:27:50,600
remember the Christmas special where Santa came down they had no idea what a

1770
02:27:50,600 --> 02:27:58,840
human was yeah nice I had the pac-man board game growing up and it had like a

1771
02:27:58,840 --> 02:28:03,520
million marbles it was all these fucking marbles that were little pellets I have

1772
02:28:03,520 --> 02:28:08,080
the bedsheets awesome I bet it had remember miss pac-man was called pepper

1773
02:28:08,080 --> 02:28:15,160
and there was pac-baby yeah nice I like super pac-man dude the arcade game for

1774
02:28:15,160 --> 02:28:23,920
super pac-man is awesome anyhow Loki you know it's always great when you start

1775
02:28:23,920 --> 02:28:30,880
off the story with a sigh it should not be a surprise that they're making

1776
02:28:30,880 --> 02:28:36,080
another Skylanders game I mean really didn't you say this game was gonna tank

1777
02:28:36,080 --> 02:28:41,800
yeah it should have tanked I underestimated how stupid the average

1778
02:28:41,800 --> 02:28:47,440
consumer is my mistake and you know what if you bought this game you have

1779
02:28:47,440 --> 02:28:51,760
yourself to blame this is why you're gonna get fucking expensive down I do I

1780
02:28:51,760 --> 02:28:56,560
do not want to hear another fucking thing about oh those map packs are call

1781
02:28:56,560 --> 02:29:00,880
of duty are too expensive this is your fucking fault for buying

1782
02:29:00,880 --> 02:29:07,320
Skylanders this is why no more can you complain about DLC costs or the quantity

1783
02:29:07,320 --> 02:29:14,080
so yes Skylanders Giants because hey how can we make Skylanders better I don't

1784
02:29:14,080 --> 02:29:19,120
notice make larger figures that we could charge more for sounds like a plan bigger

1785
02:29:19,120 --> 02:29:26,360
is better people will buy them because they're consumer whores and how so yes

1786
02:29:26,360 --> 02:29:31,400
Skylanders Giants will be coming out later this year I think also for the Wii

1787
02:29:31,400 --> 02:29:36,200
U probably at some point and I gotta be honest by looking at the screenshots

1788
02:29:36,200 --> 02:29:42,560
which this game itself kinda looks like it could have been on the GameCube or

1789
02:29:42,560 --> 02:29:48,520
the PlayStation 2 I mean pretty cheap I've heard good things about the game

1790
02:29:48,520 --> 02:29:52,240
itself just the game not all this extra crap at the game itself I've heard

1791
02:29:52,240 --> 02:29:57,200
decent things as a decent dungeon crawler it looks pretty cheap anyways so

1792
02:29:57,200 --> 02:30:01,000
you can't go off the only the only thing they're changing is they're adding these

1793
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:06,280
giant fucking characters that do stuff and their money but hey guess what

1794
02:30:06,280 --> 02:30:09,640
they're not going to force you to buy another goddamn portal you can still use

1795
02:30:09,640 --> 02:30:13,080
your old portal so they're just gonna be twice as many skews I got a fucking set

1796
02:30:13,080 --> 02:30:19,760
up thank God for that and it's so we're gonna have these giant fucking portal

1797
02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:24,160
characters that you have to use with your regular Skylanders characters and

1798
02:30:24,160 --> 02:30:28,240
I'm sure they're gonna have more characters go along with that and yeah

1799
02:30:28,240 --> 02:30:32,320
so that's fantastic and I want to say they were the number one accessory item

1800
02:30:32,320 --> 02:30:40,760
for games this month so congrats to you Skylanders for me I'm selling a lot and

1801
02:30:40,760 --> 02:30:44,440
then of course there's going to be some Toys R Us exclusive items because they

1802
02:30:44,440 --> 02:30:50,240
have signed a fucking blood pact with Activision to pimp these two children so

1803
02:30:50,240 --> 02:30:55,720
once again I hope you're happy because you you folks that purchase Skylanders

1804
02:30:55,720 --> 02:30:59,720
are going to be the downfall of the gaming industry when the inevitable

1805
02:30:59,720 --> 02:31:03,000
video game crash happens was by the way there's big rumblings we're headed

1806
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:06,440
towards another video game crash because think about it if the Wii U and the Vita

1807
02:31:06,440 --> 02:31:11,280
don't do very well it could lead to another crash and if the Wii U and the

1808
02:31:11,280 --> 02:31:14,720
Vita don't do well people are just going to buy games the PlayStation 3 and the

1809
02:31:14,720 --> 02:31:20,600
Xbox 360 oh the world will end but I don't know things I'm reading I don't

1810
02:31:20,600 --> 02:31:24,360
think anything could ever happen to the extent that it happened with Atari but

1811
02:31:24,360 --> 02:31:28,360
if you look at the sales dude sales this January were way down compared to a year

1812
02:31:28,360 --> 02:31:33,880
ago there's nothing coming out in January I'm not surprised they had they

1813
02:31:33,880 --> 02:31:37,960
had one week of sales because all the game releases for January came out the

1814
02:31:37,960 --> 02:31:40,760
last still have holdovers and people using their gift cards and all that

1815
02:31:40,760 --> 02:31:45,080
but see normally January like last year January they had Darksiders which came

1816
02:31:45,080 --> 02:31:50,080
out like in the first week they had Bayonetta they had actually been under

1817
02:31:50,080 --> 02:31:54,120
my bed in the year before it was I think I think Bayonetta was a year before okay

1818
02:31:54,120 --> 02:32:02,400
well one of these January's had Darksiders and Bayonetta and you know

1819
02:32:02,400 --> 02:32:04,880
Alan was saying to me the other day why haven't they announced a sequel to

1820
02:32:04,880 --> 02:32:12,400
Bayonetta yet it's a very good question it did well then of course there's a

1821
02:32:12,400 --> 02:32:16,760
whole a Metal Gear game that now is basically no Metal Gear Bayonetta the

1822
02:32:16,760 --> 02:32:24,520
Metal Gear game will come out eventually rebooted it totally rebooted it alright

1823
02:32:24,520 --> 02:32:30,440
so yes Skylander Giants hip hip hooray one more story for you guys here and

1824
02:32:30,440 --> 02:32:34,120
then we're gonna go to the Skype line and this one is also going to start off

1825
02:32:34,120 --> 02:32:41,080
with a sigh sorry I gotta interrupt real quick here so yeah remember how I was

1826
02:32:41,080 --> 02:32:44,800
saying that they're gonna have some exclusive stuff some of the characters

1827
02:32:44,800 --> 02:32:48,080
they've run out of you know they have the legendary characters which sell for

1828
02:32:48,080 --> 02:32:51,880
a lot more on eBay that's how you know how they're special and also they have

1829
02:32:51,880 --> 02:32:56,840
now iridescent blue characters so they're like and we're not even gonna

1830
02:32:56,840 --> 02:33:00,760
paint this one we're just gonna make it clear plastic and people spend more

1831
02:33:00,760 --> 02:33:07,960
money for it alright I got one more story for you guys then we're gonna get

1832
02:33:07,960 --> 02:33:11,120
to the sky plane and your Twitter topics so just a reminder here's your last

1833
02:33:11,120 --> 02:33:18,560
chance to get those Twitter topics into twitter.com slash o LR this story is

1834
02:33:18,560 --> 02:33:27,200
about another sigh huge sigh Ubisoft I I can't with this this is the whole DRM

1835
02:33:27,200 --> 02:33:31,000
thing okay and you know they've gotten a lot of shit about this whole I thought

1836
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:36,520
they I thought that Ubisoft got rid of this DRM when the people started being

1837
02:33:36,520 --> 02:33:39,880
up in arms about it but I guess that was just like moving forward and what I'm

1838
02:33:39,880 --> 02:33:43,200
talking about is the whole you have to be online to play the game and if you

1839
02:33:43,200 --> 02:33:47,000
get kicked offline you get kicked out of the game well what happened is that

1840
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:51,520
Ubisoft had to do an online server switch this past week and it locked

1841
02:33:51,520 --> 02:33:55,680
people out of the games now granted they warned people you know this is gonna be

1842
02:33:55,680 --> 02:33:59,080
happening so you won't be able to play your fucking game for a day the game

1843
02:33:59,080 --> 02:34:02,840
that you bought it won't work for a day because we were too lazy to have a

1844
02:34:02,840 --> 02:34:07,760
backup server in place or however these technical things work meaning driver

1845
02:34:07,760 --> 02:34:13,160
San Francisco and so forth was unable to be signed into however driver San

1846
02:34:13,160 --> 02:34:16,280
Francisco was not one of the games that Ubisoft originally said you will not be

1847
02:34:16,280 --> 02:34:21,360
able to play so extra games got taken down on top of what Ubisoft originally

1848
02:34:21,360 --> 02:34:26,840
said some games were still okay like Just Dance 3 and settlers online via

1849
02:34:26,840 --> 02:34:30,400
Twitter Ubisoft says we apologize for the inconvenience it seems some of you

1850
02:34:30,400 --> 02:34:34,440
can't connect to games announced as playable during migration we're on it

1851
02:34:34,440 --> 02:34:38,200
and we'll keep you posted here in related news those that pirated these

1852
02:34:38,200 --> 02:34:45,560
games experience no issues I don't think Just Dance would be part of it because

1853
02:34:45,560 --> 02:34:50,840
that's not I think I think it was after the fact to no one gets to wiggle their

1854
02:34:50,840 --> 02:34:54,280
but how about Assassin's Creed revelations there you go I think it's

1855
02:34:54,280 --> 02:35:01,320
only PC tiles yeah so but but am I correct in saying Ubisoft does not not

1856
02:35:01,320 --> 02:35:07,840
do this anymore right they will they don't care you're still gonna buy the

1857
02:35:07,840 --> 02:35:11,840
next Assassin's Creed game people you're not gonna remember that they even did

1858
02:35:11,840 --> 02:35:15,560
this I'm not but then again I hadn't bought by any of the others like does

1859
02:35:15,560 --> 02:35:19,160
anyone remember the snafu with the whole like PlayStation Network where they

1860
02:35:19,160 --> 02:35:23,720
they forgot to calculate a date correctly or something like that and so

1861
02:35:23,720 --> 02:35:30,560
it knocked everything offline for like a day no one remembers that that's true

1862
02:35:30,560 --> 02:35:33,640
that's true I remember the big fuss people made about that I wonder how many

1863
02:35:33,640 --> 02:35:37,200
people forgot about the PlayStation hack by now I'm sure a lot of people have

1864
02:35:37,200 --> 02:35:43,480
already forgotten a whole little PlayStation Network thing all right we

so much thank you Stan now for those that don't know who you are is there a

1877
02:36:36,280 --> 02:36:40,640
place where folks may or may not have been seeing you this week yes um I

1878
02:36:40,640 --> 02:36:46,000
actually appeared on the new season of the tester on the PlayStation Network I

1879
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:50,640
can't believe it guys after all this okay I I don't know if you know about

1880
02:36:50,640 --> 02:36:53,800
some of our running jokes if Stan feels you in about the tester but when I

1881
02:36:53,800 --> 02:36:58,360
originally gave my review on the tester season one way back when I talked about

1882
02:36:58,360 --> 02:37:03,280
the tester and I actually said the tester is not bad like it's it's it's

1883
02:37:03,280 --> 02:37:06,600
not like a great freakin show it's not like you know you're gonna be watching

1884
02:37:06,600 --> 02:37:11,120
The Walking Dead or something but right as far as reality TV goes as far as a

1885
02:37:11,120 --> 02:37:16,600
lot of the old g4 shows go the tester is not bad but as I'm talking about this

1886
02:37:16,600 --> 02:37:20,360
Jamie's cat because we were doing the show at her house Shermie took a big

1887
02:37:20,360 --> 02:37:28,040
dump all over the floor and so I think well there's Shermie's review well

1888
02:37:28,040 --> 02:37:31,600
actually it's quite fitting because for those that might have seen the first

1889
02:37:31,600 --> 02:37:36,880
episode Quajimonster gotten some deep shit literally because she started

1890
02:37:36,880 --> 02:37:42,160
talking about farting and shitting and yeah what works what is up with this

1891
02:37:42,160 --> 02:37:46,360
okay I gotta say I made a tweet right after I watched the first episode cuz

1892
02:37:46,360 --> 02:37:51,040
you I look I love video games and I love trashy reality TV so I'm not gonna lie I

1893
02:37:51,040 --> 02:37:54,560
did watch the tester all right judge me all you want I don't give a fuck all

1894
02:37:54,560 --> 02:38:03,360
right it's not as bad as being on the tester trust me wow we've got to get

1895
02:38:03,360 --> 02:38:07,360
into this a little bit but okay okay but here's the thing I'm watching it and I'm

1896
02:38:07,360 --> 02:38:12,240
like these they all have potty mouths it was like watching there was an episode

1897
02:38:12,240 --> 02:38:18,160
of South Park called it hits the fan where they hype up in the whole episode

1898
02:38:18,160 --> 02:38:22,120
dude they're gonna say shit on Chicago hope tonight they're gonna say shit and

1899
02:38:22,120 --> 02:38:26,960
then like it turns into they say one shit to now it's like mush shit TV and

1900
02:38:26,960 --> 02:38:30,320
they say the word shit like 200 times and I'm watching the first episode of

1901
02:38:30,320 --> 02:38:37,320
tester and I hear shit dropped like literally 1520 times during the show my

1902
02:38:37,320 --> 02:38:42,800
game you hear me go that's bullshit and there's there is an awesome story about

1903
02:38:42,800 --> 02:38:47,480
that it's in regards to what somebody said so might stop by next week to talk

1904
02:38:47,480 --> 02:38:50,720
about it it's a good story but yeah there's a lot of shit being dropped left

1905
02:38:50,720 --> 02:38:55,120
and right Wow but yet they bleep fuck I don't know sorry to the guy who didn't

1906
02:38:55,120 --> 02:38:58,760
like cursing I'm very sorry but you know it's just look they say it on PlayStation

1907
02:38:58,760 --> 02:39:03,360
Network all right yeah for real you you were actually on the tester and it's

1908
02:39:03,360 --> 02:39:13,160
funny because we joked about getting dark soccer to apply next year I applied

1909
02:39:13,160 --> 02:39:17,080
a little bit of a whim and I actually the reason I decided to go for the

1910
02:39:17,080 --> 02:39:24,080
tester was way back when sci-fi did WCG ultimate gamer I said why not I'll try I

1911
02:39:24,080 --> 02:39:28,000
made it to like the final 42 people and didn't make that show because apparently

1912
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:32,960
I wasn't like cool enough so screw them and then the tester started applying or

1913
02:39:32,960 --> 02:39:36,880
started the application process for season three I said why not next I know

1914
02:39:36,880 --> 02:39:40,440
I'm getting a phone call saying yeah we're flying you out to Los Angeles and

1915
02:39:40,440 --> 02:39:44,720
you're gonna be on the tester like oh shit you just got picked like there

1916
02:39:44,720 --> 02:39:48,960
wasn't a lot of like screening and whittling down there's it's the whole

1917
02:39:48,960 --> 02:39:53,720
process starts in about there started about mid August I want to say and I put

1918
02:39:53,720 --> 02:39:57,800
up a profile really quickly I said you know I need to think of what what's

1919
02:39:57,800 --> 02:40:02,360
gonna get me noticed I figured okay how many people are the combination of a

1920
02:40:02,360 --> 02:40:10,120
chemist plays roller derby and has like a trophy level of 18 not many so I use

1921
02:40:10,120 --> 02:40:14,340
that and then within a day of putting that up I had a producer calling me say

1922
02:40:14,340 --> 02:40:18,080
hey you want to do some interviews with you check you out and then the Skype

1923
02:40:18,080 --> 02:40:24,040
interview had to wait a month of like no contact from them and then all of a

1924
02:40:24,040 --> 02:40:28,480
sudden mid-october I get a call from the executive producer saying yeah you're

1925
02:40:28,480 --> 02:40:32,080
still in the running here's a contract sign your life away once to do that

1926
02:40:32,080 --> 02:40:37,980
we'll do another interview and I found out I was flying to LA about mmm four or

1927
02:40:37,980 --> 02:40:43,360
five days before filming began so it's a long process but just a lot of

1928
02:40:43,360 --> 02:40:47,440
interviews and waiting but I get the sense that the whole process of

1929
02:40:47,440 --> 02:40:51,040
recording the show itself is really quick like you know I know there's a lot

1930
02:40:51,040 --> 02:40:56,680
of TV magic but you know I could kind of tell that they're probably doing like

1931
02:40:56,680 --> 02:41:01,160
multiple challenges in a day and the whole no actually no really no it's

1932
02:41:01,160 --> 02:41:06,920
every episode is literally one day of filming huh it's back to back to back

1933
02:41:06,920 --> 02:41:11,320
to back about like 15 18 hours worth of filming crammed into one little half

1934
02:41:11,320 --> 02:41:18,320
hour Wow there's a lot of awesomeness but they try to keep the drama and my

1935
02:41:18,320 --> 02:41:22,080
case a picture of a cockroach trying to go like ass to mouth to me which was

1936
02:41:22,080 --> 02:41:26,640
great now because I know Loki and don't start a dark soccer don't watch the

1937
02:41:26,640 --> 02:41:31,240
tester this week the challenge no no no I saw do you watch I was a night and I

1938
02:41:31,240 --> 02:41:36,960
had a joke ready too so basically I'm like say be glad that they're just you

1939
02:41:36,960 --> 02:41:40,940
know you know they're they're doing the analogy where it's you know you have to

1940
02:41:40,940 --> 02:41:44,560
keep your head in a case of bugs you know because you're squashing bugs or

1941
02:41:44,560 --> 02:41:48,200
whatever thank God you're not testing for Bethesda where you'd have to jump in

1942
02:41:48,200 --> 02:41:53,200
a fun swimming pool full of cockroaches well the thing is if you're testing for

1943
02:41:53,200 --> 02:41:56,300
Bethesda there would be no bugs because apparently they don't see them when they

1944
02:41:56,300 --> 02:42:00,000
test them they just leave them in the game you know my honest-to-god reaction

1945
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:03,280
when I saw that on the show though I said dark soccer would have been first

1946
02:42:03,280 --> 02:42:09,320
out she would have been first out she put your hand no they had to they had to

1947
02:42:09,320 --> 02:42:13,000
have their head in this case full of bugs and they're pouring cockroaches

1948
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:17,440
because because they wanted to see who can interview under pressure and I was

1949
02:42:17,440 --> 02:42:22,640
like dark soccer would have been telling that guy off like I put my head no bugs

1950
02:42:22,640 --> 02:42:28,160
well what's funny is like we have our this one guy Jay Titan he's this big

1951
02:42:28,160 --> 02:42:32,400
rough-and-tough trash talk and like knows the shit and then as soon as we

1952
02:42:32,400 --> 02:42:37,600
find out it's the roaches we go back into the loft as they're doing us they're

1953
02:42:37,600 --> 02:42:42,440
doing each person for the challenge one at a time he starts freaking out back in

1954
02:42:42,440 --> 02:42:49,400
the loft like scream I quit and he was probably one of the next to last people

1955
02:42:49,400 --> 02:42:53,160
to go and all of us are coming back oh it's fine you'll be fine he's almost

1956
02:42:53,160 --> 02:42:58,480
starting to like shake from nervousness he's that terrified of bugs so that

1957
02:42:58,480 --> 02:43:01,200
would have been me I would have been crying I would have been screaming I

1958
02:43:01,200 --> 02:43:04,040
would have been threatening calls to my lawyer but then I would have just done

1959
02:43:04,040 --> 02:43:07,680
it you know I would have been like alright just fucking get in the zone

1960
02:43:07,680 --> 02:43:10,080
don't think about it don't think about it don't think I'm fucking thinking

1961
02:43:10,080 --> 02:43:14,840
about it don't think about it like the hardest part was just well for me I the

1962
02:43:14,840 --> 02:43:18,920
way they fell down my hair started going in my face so I had like at one point

1963
02:43:18,920 --> 02:43:22,400
almost a dozen roaches just checking out my face like you know I'm gonna sit

1964
02:43:22,400 --> 02:43:25,800
right in front of her so she can't see anything you know it would freak them

1965
02:43:25,800 --> 02:43:31,200
out you start munching off actually actually we were totally weren't allowed

1966
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:35,800
to eat them ah there was like this roach wrangler or this guy that owned the

1967
02:43:35,800 --> 02:43:39,680
roaches and they were his like precious little babies and we couldn't do any

1968
02:43:39,680 --> 02:43:43,840
harm to him what was his name Joe and did he have an apartment I wouldn't be

1969
02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:48,400
surprised if it's probably him the only one that remembers Joe's apartment I

1970
02:43:48,400 --> 02:43:52,920
remember Joe's apartment singing roaches so I I have to I I know there's probably

1971
02:43:52,920 --> 02:43:55,240
tons you want to talk about but of course I I'm gonna steer the

1972
02:43:55,240 --> 02:44:00,800
conversation but I'm take over I felt bad for the girl they sent home I get

1973
02:44:00,800 --> 02:44:05,280
oh I shouldn't ruin it for those that watched it my bad but I I like that the

1974
02:44:05,280 --> 02:44:09,680
person that they sent home seemed I don't agree with that I completely

1975
02:44:09,680 --> 02:44:13,320
disagree with sending the person they sent home she that person seemed really

1976
02:44:13,320 --> 02:44:16,640
nice to me and I was like that seemed I'm surprised that person's not

1977
02:44:16,640 --> 02:44:19,640
listening to OLR cuz like that seemed like the kind of person that would like

1978
02:44:19,640 --> 02:44:24,000
be like I would be friends with like for real so I kind of felt bad for them

1979
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:30,320
she's like she was the one of the coolest cats in the loft I mean like she

1980
02:44:30,320 --> 02:44:34,280
just the first thing we noticed by her she had this giant like tail that she

1981
02:44:34,280 --> 02:44:38,480
brought with and okay you're awesome and actually we were aligned or we were

1982
02:44:38,480 --> 02:44:41,960
getting into the vans to head to the law for filming she originally had on this

1983
02:44:41,960 --> 02:44:45,120
Voltron t-shirt that they took away from her because you couldn't like have

1984
02:44:45,120 --> 02:44:50,320
copyrighted material that wasn't first party Sony cuz wah wah wah whatever but

1985
02:44:50,320 --> 02:44:55,080
I'm just looking at going I like her so we spent a good like our just talking

1986
02:44:55,080 --> 02:45:00,000
about Voltron and it's I was so sad to see her go and considering it was either

1987
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:06,000
like the person that either didn't like wasn't memorable the person that talked

1988
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:10,320
about shit the whole time but that's home the person talked about shit that

1989
02:45:10,320 --> 02:45:13,960
that's just me that's reality TV I'm kind of you know I'm kind of looking at

1990
02:45:13,960 --> 02:45:18,360
it going you know it sounds like you are the real deal you're legit your

1991
02:45:18,360 --> 02:45:21,900
intentions I mean am I correct you really did want to work for Sony right

1992
02:45:21,900 --> 02:45:27,280
like oh my god yeah they're in a later episode you'll see just how much I I

1993
02:45:27,280 --> 02:45:32,960
would have killed or I did I get my dream job it's like I can't really say

1994
02:45:32,960 --> 02:45:37,320
which way how or which way it fell but right sure no I understand and listeners

1995
02:45:37,320 --> 02:45:40,440
please do respect that she's under contract can't say if she wins or got

1996
02:45:40,440 --> 02:45:48,720
told to sashay away sued so yeah all five people that watch the show I mean I

1997
02:45:48,720 --> 02:45:52,800
don't know like it's kind of a joke that like no one watches the tester but yet

1998
02:45:52,800 --> 02:45:58,920
here I am I I I admit I watch it and you know I gotta say all joking aside what

1999
02:45:58,920 --> 02:46:03,160
they're doing there is interesting because it really is the only show right

2000
02:46:03,160 --> 02:46:07,000
now that I can think of that's produced exclusively for a gaming console you

2001
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,560
don't have anything like it on Nintendo you don't have anything like it

2002
02:46:09,560 --> 02:46:13,440
otherwise on Sony you'd certainly don't have anything like it on Xbox especially

2003
02:46:13,440 --> 02:46:16,200
since one versus a hundred isn't around anymore which was a different kind of

2004
02:46:16,200 --> 02:46:22,040
thing anyway right but no it it's I mean like I said they originally did that

2005
02:46:22,040 --> 02:46:26,960
that the BC ultimate gamer but that kind of flopped after two seasons but even

2006
02:46:26,960 --> 02:46:31,720
then it wasn't entirely Xbox I think season two had some we crap in it that

2007
02:46:31,720 --> 02:46:36,400
no one cared about but yeah it's when I tell people that it's exclusively on

2008
02:46:36,400 --> 02:46:40,240
PlayStation Network you can't download the episodes on your computer via the

2009
02:46:40,240 --> 02:46:45,800
tester calm or crackle calm but yeah just the fact that it's produced by Sony

2010
02:46:45,800 --> 02:46:51,200
for Sony promoting Sony it's very unique in that sound so here's a question

2011
02:46:51,200 --> 02:46:56,680
though Rob is since you mentioned crackle calm crackle they have the

2012
02:46:56,680 --> 02:47:02,360
actual utility on or the app on the 360 so could you watch a tester on the 360

2013
02:47:02,360 --> 02:47:08,320
can actually watch the tester on the 360 I've tried it and it is possible so yeah

2014
02:47:08,320 --> 02:47:12,320
I kind of got a personal kick a lot of that zenacorn our term is do you have to

2015
02:47:12,320 --> 02:47:17,240
pay to see the tester no it's it's no we free trust me would you want to pay to

2016
02:47:17,240 --> 02:47:22,920
see the tester I love that you're deprecated I I don't know I again I know

2017
02:47:22,920 --> 02:47:25,480
you can't tell me which way but the way you talk about it sometimes makes me

2018
02:47:25,480 --> 02:47:33,040
think it might not a one just looking at the first episode there it's supposed to

2019
02:47:33,040 --> 02:47:37,000
be a double elimination but it wasn't a little bit of spoiler there but it was a

2020
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:42,680
single elimination and with who was clearly supposed to go home when he or

2021
02:47:42,680 --> 02:47:49,280
she didn't that pissed me off like throwing a little shade Lee bullshit

2022
02:47:49,280 --> 02:47:53,360
what happened there so I'm getting I'm getting the sense that maybe you're

2023
02:47:53,360 --> 02:47:57,460
you're still kind of friends with some of these folks like maybe the person we

2024
02:47:57,460 --> 02:47:59,680
were talking about earlier who got kicked off before their time but maybe

2025
02:47:59,680 --> 02:48:08,000
not with yeah I we have this like yes I talked she's actually going to a like a

2026
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:13,480
giant world cosplay competition so good luck to her but um yeah we have this

2027
02:48:13,480 --> 02:48:17,200
secret tester we call it the tester lounge on fake book as I call it because

2028
02:48:17,200 --> 02:48:23,400
Facebook is but yeah like people from all three seasons Brent go keys in it

2029
02:48:23,400 --> 02:48:31,120
Meredith Adrian side note Meredith knows her shit about games like it surprised

2030
02:48:31,120 --> 02:48:35,120
all of us how much she knew about it so that was awesome but yeah we we talk all

2031
02:48:35,120 --> 02:48:40,760
the time and as a matter of fact once the cast was announced Mo chocolate from

2032
02:48:40,760 --> 02:48:44,600
season 2 reached out to all of us it's like whoa what's up my mo nice to meet

2033
02:48:44,600 --> 02:48:49,280
you let's video chat on Skype and I'm just going oh my god you're you were

2034
02:48:49,280 --> 02:48:53,240
you're Mo chocolate and you're talking to me holy crap and we've become the

2035
02:48:53,240 --> 02:48:58,240
best of friends since then so it's pretty cool that is that is awesome what

2036
02:48:58,240 --> 02:49:01,000
sounds like you at the end of the day you know no matter what's happening on

2037
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:04,120
the show you you good or bad you had a good experience and you met a lot of

2038
02:49:04,120 --> 02:49:09,000
great people out of it sounds like so oh my god it I it's something that I could

2039
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:14,120
never like forget I mean I never thought I would be doing something like that

2040
02:49:14,120 --> 02:49:18,400
efforts I'm not the most outgoing person I'm a gamer I'm a little bit shy a

2041
02:49:18,400 --> 02:49:24,040
little bit of a closet dweller but it just blew my mind in terms of

2042
02:49:24,040 --> 02:49:29,000
awesomeness and oh my god I look on the TV that I've muted and it's Whitney

2043
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:39,400
Houston changing that's why people watch the tester to get away from CNN and the

2044
02:49:39,400 --> 02:49:45,520
witness that's it we need to hang out I had to catch a predator on and then all

2045
02:49:45,520 --> 02:49:49,400
of a sudden it became Whitney Houston I'm like I can't see the sake but let's

2046
02:49:49,400 --> 02:49:53,800
turn on something equally that's what I have you know what's funny and I swear

2047
02:49:53,800 --> 02:49:57,560
I'm not just I I swear I'm not just saying this because I had no idea that

2048
02:49:57,560 --> 02:50:00,560
you were gonna read like I know Stan had told me like hey I know someone on the

2049
02:50:00,560 --> 02:50:04,920
show and I was like okay cool like I didn't I guess you guys must be pretty

2050
02:50:04,920 --> 02:50:08,240
close because here you are actually listening to orange lounge radio but at

2051
02:50:08,240 --> 02:50:11,440
first I was like oh neat it's kind of fun to know somebody who got to do you

2052
02:50:11,440 --> 02:50:15,040
know a rare experience like that but when when I saw you specifically on the

2053
02:50:15,040 --> 02:50:18,960
show I actually thought I was like that's the girl they have instead of

2054
02:50:18,960 --> 02:50:24,840
dark Sakura I really did I really think that because you guys kind of strike me

2055
02:50:24,840 --> 02:50:29,400
as having stuff in common so well maybe I'll do it next year if I don't have a

2056
02:50:29,400 --> 02:50:38,360
job I had a job or have have had a job as a chemist so they even asked me would

2057
02:50:38,360 --> 02:50:44,560
you be okay with giving up your current job I said hmm work in a lab or work at

2058
02:50:44,560 --> 02:50:49,560
Santa Monica let me think yes yes I would be okay with that okay thanks I'm

2059
02:50:49,560 --> 02:50:55,240
a designer so I was like I can do all of your booklets it's a good way to get

2060
02:50:55,240 --> 02:50:58,400
your foot in the door as I understand the the guy that won the very first

2061
02:50:58,400 --> 02:51:03,600
season was only like a tester for like what six months and now he's like in

2062
02:51:03,600 --> 02:51:09,040
marketing or something and I know that guy isn't the whole six months thing is

2063
02:51:09,040 --> 02:51:15,480
what they don't tell you is it's for a six month contract mmm it's so like

2064
02:51:15,480 --> 02:51:19,680
kicking the groin cuz after Meredith like tells about the prize that you

2065
02:51:19,680 --> 02:51:23,400
could win you're all excited and they cut the scene then this one random crew

2066
02:51:23,400 --> 02:51:27,160
member comes out and they go alright this is just a reminder the prizes you

2067
02:51:27,160 --> 02:51:32,040
got the ps3 the money the TV blah blah blah blah and just you know the job as a

2068
02:51:32,040 --> 02:51:35,320
tester is a six-month contract at which point somebody may or may not keep you

2069
02:51:35,320 --> 02:51:41,240
okay keep filming all going and the same thing for this season it's like the

2073
02:51:57,320 --> 02:52:00,720
making stuff up I just thought you know some like sometimes like you you might

2074
02:52:00,720 --> 02:52:04,200
know somebody like oh I knew I went to high school with that person and after

2075
02:52:04,200 --> 02:52:08,440

2076
02:52:08,440 --> 02:52:14,160
pen let me put on my sunglasses oh god um let's god what else was I gonna ask

2077
02:52:14,160 --> 02:52:18,480
I know something escapes me I don't know it was just one episodes aired and I'm

2078
02:52:18,480 --> 02:52:21,400
sure there's plenty more you've really got to bite your tongue on but we'll

2079
02:52:21,400 --> 02:52:24,680
well hopefully you'll decide to keep listening to olr and we can get some

2080
02:52:24,680 --> 02:52:28,600
more dirt on the tester I look we're probably the only podcast that talks

2081
02:52:28,600 --> 02:52:36,400
about this show there's a few out there actually totally don't want to plug it

2082
02:52:36,400 --> 02:52:41,880
but kind of have to since Greg Miller was a guest judge this season sure he's

2083
02:52:41,880 --> 02:52:46,040
actually having all of the cast members as they're booted off the show on the

2084
02:52:46,040 --> 02:52:50,960
beyond podcast so all right whatever I get kicked off or when I win I'll be on

2085
02:52:50,960 --> 02:52:54,920
there and I'll I'll see if I can put in a well our show for you guys that's

2086
02:52:54,920 --> 02:52:59,480
awesome see you know you don't have to say the final thing that kept me from

2087
02:52:59,480 --> 02:53:04,280
applying really was that I don't want to live in LA except for being close to

2088
02:53:04,280 --> 02:53:11,840
Disneyland well I figured it would be nice to actually like enjoy non sub

2089
02:53:11,840 --> 02:53:16,040
zero temperatures like I am right now because I'm in Milwaukee not really the

2090
02:53:16,040 --> 02:53:20,400
best weather capital of the world so I think it'd be a nice change you live

2091
02:53:20,400 --> 02:53:24,080
relatively close to good friends of ours yeah you live right by these olr

2092
02:53:24,080 --> 02:53:30,040
lesbians located in Wisconsin in Madison in that case they should come to my

roller derby bouts I actually play for the Brew City Bruisers in Milwaukee so

2094

2095
02:53:38,880 --> 02:53:41,320

2123
02:55:50,080 --> 02:55:54,880
bedroom y'all I love that she's so delts like self-deprecating about the whole

2124
02:55:54,880 --> 02:55:59,520
thing like the I and it sounds to me I mean I could be wrong but it sounds to

2125
02:55:59,520 --> 02:56:02,480
me based on the whole like Facebook group they've got going on or where fake

2126
02:56:02,480 --> 02:56:05,720
book as she called it that it sounds like they're all kind of in on the joke

2127
02:56:05,720 --> 02:56:10,120
like yeah you know it's the tester and that's that's pretty awesome you know

2128
02:56:10,120 --> 02:56:16,560
they they accept it for what it is so that's awesome but I'll tell you what

2129
02:56:16,560 --> 02:56:20,080
you know what again I and I do stand by this I said this before and I'll say it

2130
02:56:20,080 --> 02:56:23,960
now the tester it's not a TV show that's going to change your life it's not the

2131
02:56:23,960 --> 02:56:27,240
best thing on television but you know what for something in the background it

2132
02:56:27,240 --> 02:56:31,720
is probably more entertaining than a lot of shows that have been about video

2133
02:56:31,720 --> 02:56:37,000
gaming in the past so there you go 1 8 7 7 game olr or our username on Skype is

2134
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:40,760
orange a lounge radio if you want to give us a call you can go for that right

2135
02:56:40,760 --> 02:56:43,680
now we've got time to take a couple more calls I know that call went on a long

2136
02:56:43,680 --> 02:56:47,200
time but we'll get at least one or two more other people on the show in the

2137
02:56:47,200 --> 02:56:53,800
meantime let's read some Twitter topics at twitter.com slash olr 13x4 ever sent

2138
02:56:53,800 --> 02:56:58,180
us a tweet this week that says hey olr how about five game music albums for

2139
02:56:58,180 --> 02:57:03,360
whatever price you wish to pay how about 13 plus albums for $10 or more and he's

2140
02:57:03,360 --> 02:57:07,640
referring to the game music bundle.com it's another one of those indie bundles

2141
02:57:07,640 --> 02:57:11,680
you know that whole thing's been very popular lately and yeah you can donate

2142
02:57:11,680 --> 02:57:16,840
their money and get soundtracks so if you're a game music fan it sounds like

2143
02:57:16,840 --> 02:57:20,080
they have all different types of games included in that and they add more

2144
02:57:20,080 --> 02:57:24,680
soundtracks as more people donate so interesting let's go to the phones

2145
02:57:24,680 --> 02:57:27,160
because we have more people calling in hi you're on orange launch radio who's

2148
02:57:35,640 --> 02:57:40,400
worried about money hey by the way just want to say the Thunder losing to the

2149
02:57:40,400 --> 02:57:46,760
Kings dude dude the Thunder lost to the Kings that's do you watch basketball who

2150

02:57:51,800 --> 02:57:55,800
that fucking team they paying me fucking let me just say the Thunder right now is

2152
02:57:55,800 --> 02:57:59,080
the best team in the league and they fucking lost to the Kings the Sacramento

2153
02:57:59,080 --> 02:58:02,560
King pretty funny everybody here in Sacramento is just laughing cuz like the

2154
02:58:02,560 --> 02:58:07,280
Kings suck and you guys anyway I won't make this about basketball what's on

2155
02:58:07,280 --> 02:58:10,720
your mind Zina Korp that much not much just been playing the hell out of League

2156
02:58:10,720 --> 02:58:15,800
of Legends for some reason you know it's funny you bring that up Twitter asked us

2157
02:58:15,800 --> 02:58:19,080
a question here about League of Legends so I can kind of tie this together

2158
02:58:19,080 --> 02:58:23,600
awesome her sent us a tweet said have you guys ever played League of Legends

2159
02:58:23,600 --> 02:58:27,720
it's an extremely popular free online game that I've never heard you mention

2160
02:58:27,720 --> 02:58:30,720
on the show which is funny because we did end up mentioning it at the top of

2161
02:58:30,720 --> 02:58:34,720
the show during the Dota thing but he's right I I personally have not played

2162
02:58:34,720 --> 02:58:39,000
League of Legends myself but Zina Korp sounds like you're a fan yeah I've been

2163
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:42,520
playing it for a while now finally got my account maxed out so I can actually

2164
02:58:42,520 --> 02:58:46,760
compete with some of the other characters in the game like the whole

2165
02:58:46,760 --> 02:58:50,480
thing with the multiplayer online battle arenas at least that's the genre it's

2166
02:58:50,480 --> 02:58:55,800
been labeled as the MOBAs is it since it's all team based there's a lot of

2167
02:58:55,800 --> 02:59:00,760
rage in there more so than you might see in the first-person shooter so I can

2168
02:59:00,760 --> 02:59:03,400
only play it for about an hour and then a little 12 year olds get on my nerves

2169
02:59:03,400 --> 02:59:06,720
but other than that the game itself is pretty fun I can only imagine like the

2170
02:59:06,720 --> 02:59:09,280
League of Legends one of those games I think I would enjoy more if I just

2171
02:59:09,280 --> 02:59:13,480
played it with like only people I know but um one thing I do notice is that

2172
02:59:13,480 --> 02:59:17,560
it's a hugely popular game to be streamed on those video game streaming

2173
02:59:17,560 --> 02:59:20,960
websites like twitch TV I always see League of Legends stuff going on on

2174
02:59:20,960 --> 02:59:24,960
there yeah actually started playing Heroes of Newark just because it looked

2175
02:59:24,960 --> 02:59:28,800
this looks more polished you know cuz they acted the higher resolutions and

2176
02:59:28,800 --> 02:59:32,600
all this other stuff your interface was better but I couldn't find any like pro

2177
02:59:32,600 --> 02:59:36,480
content or even games being played so I could learn how to play it but there's

2178
02:59:36,480 --> 02:59:40,000
tons of League of Legends stuff so I started watching that here here and

2179
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:44,080
there like pro coverage and just some guys casting their games because that's

2180
02:59:44,080 --> 02:59:47,040
how I got into Starcraft is when everybody was casting it during the beta

2181
02:59:47,040 --> 02:59:50,880
and I'd started playing it out and once I figured out how it worked it was

2182
02:59:50,880 --> 02:59:53,820
pretty fun it's the only really competitive game that I play so I'm

2183
02:59:53,820 --> 02:59:56,840
pretty much done with first-person shooters as far as I'm concerned let me

2184
02:59:56,840 --> 02:59:59,280
back up a minute because this is the question I should have asked you first

2185
02:59:59,280 --> 03:00:02,220
like for those that aren't familiar with League of Legends this ossifer kind of

2186
03:00:02,220 --> 03:00:06,520
insinuates we are in on the Twitter what what is what makes this game addicting

2187
03:00:06,520 --> 03:00:09,840
what makes you stick it out through the 12 year olds as long as you can for this

2188
03:00:09,840 --> 03:00:13,620
okay so you're familiar with the interface that Starcraft and them use

2189
03:00:13,620 --> 03:00:17,220
right so you got your your mouse control you're right-clicking on things moving

2190
03:00:17,220 --> 03:00:20,700
them around this one you're locked in a one single character alright so you play

2191
03:00:20,700 --> 03:00:24,520
one character there's about I think just under a hundred if not just a little

2192
03:00:24,520 --> 03:00:27,920
over a hundred characters to choose from they all have different abilities some

2193
03:00:27,920 --> 03:00:34,400
yeah think of your standard role-playing game party they have characters that fit

2194
03:00:34,400 --> 03:00:39,480
each role that's in the game your healer your magic user your Archer sure yeah

2195
03:00:39,480 --> 03:00:43,260
this one is this street attack damage you have your attack power which are

2196
03:00:43,260 --> 03:00:47,240
your magical abilities you have your tanks and you have your junglers of the

2197
03:00:47,240 --> 03:00:50,600
guys who don't sit in the main action of the game running around in the

2198
03:00:50,600 --> 03:00:55,200
assisting everybody else to sum it up here real quick and you just keep used

2199
03:00:55,200 --> 03:00:59,160
it's tower defense so you have three lines of towers and a large crystal that

2200
03:00:59,160 --> 03:01:02,160
you defend if you kill the other guys crystal you win or they can surrender

2201
03:01:02,160 --> 03:01:08,760
and give up okay it's not hard to learn but it takes patience to learn how to

2202
03:01:08,760 --> 03:01:11,920
play each character because they're all a little bit different there's like I

2203
03:01:11,920 --> 03:01:16,540
think right puts out a teaser video on each one of the characters they release

2204
03:01:16,540 --> 03:01:19,720
that tell you all about how to use their powers and just that any other thing so

2205
03:01:19,720 --> 03:01:25,480
just if you want to learn one there's plenty of resources to do so you know I

2206
03:01:25,480 --> 03:01:29,600
gotta admit part of what is scary to me in sorts about League of Legends that I

2207
03:01:29,600 --> 03:01:33,760
am afraid of of signing on there and that just getting owned by twelve-year

2208
03:01:33,760 --> 03:01:36,400
olds right off the bat cuz there's no way to practice like is there any type

2209
03:01:36,400 --> 03:01:40,640
of like practice learning curve like kinda way to ease yourself into this

2210
03:01:40,640 --> 03:01:44,280
game before you have to play against the hardcore people yeah well you can't

2211
03:01:44,280 --> 03:01:47,240
really play with the hardcore guys cuz they're mainly doing ranked matches

2212
03:01:47,240 --> 03:01:51,160
right matches you can't even touch until you max out your account they keeps

2213
03:01:51,160 --> 03:01:54,760
track of your players skill and how long you've been playing up to level 30 so

2214
03:01:54,760 --> 03:01:58,480
it'll take you about a good four or five months before you can even touch the

2215
03:01:58,480 --> 03:02:01,320
rank stuff so you don't have to worry about it and the matching is pretty good

2216
03:02:01,320 --> 03:02:05,880
so balances the team based off of the level base and how many wins they have

2217
03:02:05,880 --> 03:02:09,800
okay that's a little better so in the very beginning you'll see rookie stuff

2218
03:02:09,800 --> 03:02:13,560
happening left and right like when you think about it's like that doesn't make

2219
03:02:13,560 --> 03:02:16,080
any sense why is it gonna go close to that when he knows he's gonna die

2220
03:02:16,080 --> 03:02:19,080
because he's a rookie and he doesn't know any better they say exactly why so

2221
03:02:19,080 --> 03:02:23,520
you'll see that and as you your level goes up the quality of your games will

2222
03:02:23,520 --> 03:02:28,200
go up as far as who you're matched with and once you reach level 30 you're

2223
03:02:28,200 --> 03:02:31,120
pretty much like you can pretty much play any role because you've been

2224
03:02:31,120 --> 03:02:34,640
playing the game enough in order to do so and it's free you don't have to put

2225
03:02:34,640 --> 03:02:39,280
any money into it whatsoever I like free I do like free let me ask this um what

2226
03:02:39,280 --> 03:02:42,120
do you think about the whole dota stuff that we were talking about earlier in

2227
03:02:42,120 --> 03:02:45,560
the show with Blizzard and valve going at each other over dota I mean it seems

2228
03:02:45,560 --> 03:02:48,760
like you're kind of getting into these games now do you do you have a

2229
03:02:48,760 --> 03:02:53,320
preference on what you want to see happen with the dota name or well to

2230
03:02:53,320 --> 03:02:59,000
sum them all up dota and dota 2 and what blizzard I think is trying to do in

2231
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:03,080
heroes a new earth follow the original model the original model is not newbie

2232
03:03:03,080 --> 03:03:08,080
friendly there's a lot of step game is very complex I mean you take just five

2233
03:03:08,080 --> 03:03:12,360
on five guys in the Starcraft environment fighting each other and you

2234
03:03:12,360 --> 03:03:17,720
add the crafting system and how you build bigger items you worry about the

2235
03:03:17,720 --> 03:03:21,160
concepts of feeding other players just running and killing so they get gold

2236
03:03:21,160 --> 03:03:24,680
because they're killing you off left or right which unbalances the whole game

2237
03:03:24,680 --> 03:03:27,040
and then everybody's screaming new bet you this that and the other thing

2238
03:03:27,040 --> 03:03:30,520
there's a lot of craft to remember for the all those but some people like that

2239
03:03:30,520 --> 03:03:34,840
complexity League of Legends is a lot simpler it's easier to get into and the

2240
03:03:34,840 --> 03:03:38,440
matches don't potentially don't last as long because there's a level cap during

2241
03:03:38,440 --> 03:03:41,880
the game your character can only get up to level 18 I think and all the others

2242
03:03:41,880 --> 03:03:47,200
and go up to 25 30 before they start capping out so the game is forced to a

2243
03:03:47,200 --> 03:03:51,080
conclusion usually one game will not go any longer than an hour even as a newbie

2244
03:03:51,080 --> 03:03:56,080
all right so it sounds like there's a lot of even though you know we kind of

2245
03:03:56,080 --> 03:03:58,920
say these games all have the same roots there's still a lot of mechanic

2246
03:03:58,920 --> 03:04:03,440
mechanical differences between them so yeah at the core of the same but one is

2247
03:04:03,440 --> 03:04:06,600
very newbie friendly the other one just let the pros deal with it don't even

2248
03:04:06,600 --> 03:04:09,920
bother all right xenocore anything else you want to share with listeners for we

2292
03:07:30,080 --> 03:07:35,480
what since the studio is at your house can we get to all our cam back I've

2293
03:07:35,480 --> 03:07:38,720
thought about it I've seriously thought about it but it's kind of a pain in the

2294
03:07:38,720 --> 03:07:43,320
butt to hook up and we're probably gonna be moving in June anyway so probably

2295
03:07:43,320 --> 03:07:48,840
after that because we'll have a more proper studio set up at that point it's

2296
03:07:48,840 --> 03:07:53,220
like the studio is like a nomad isn't it maybe for your 10-year present olr

2297
03:07:53,220 --> 03:07:59,480
listeners because our birthdays in June too it plays Genesis games I have a

2298
03:07:59,480 --> 03:08:09,320
thing that plays Genesis games it's called a Genesis what am I gonna do with

2299
03:08:09,320 --> 03:08:13,480
you Rama all right anything else you want to I filthy up the show it tonight

2300
03:08:13,480 --> 03:08:17,480
how bad the beat is gonna fall flat on its face no now you're throwing some

2301
03:08:17,480 --> 03:08:21,120
shade this is good this is these are the types of calls I like why is the Vita

2302
03:08:21,120 --> 03:08:26,560
gonna fall flat on its face Rama I can't as much as I want the system I can't see

2303
03:08:26,560 --> 03:08:30,720
myself shelling out two hundred and fifty dollars for this thing I just

2304
03:08:30,720 --> 03:08:35,440
can't I mean Nintendo learned their lesson like pretty quickly with the

2305
03:08:35,440 --> 03:08:42,240
price drop Sony will just stand there all right just say that it's okay it's

2306
03:08:42,240 --> 03:08:46,880
a cop it's okay there's nothing wrong with the price for me for a year before

2307
03:08:46,880 --> 03:08:51,520
it falls if that all right let's look at let's look at the technology with you

2308
03:08:51,520 --> 03:08:57,240
know the DS and the 3ds I mean if you put those side to side and you know is

2309
03:08:57,240 --> 03:09:02,200
you give it to somebody like okay why are these the same thing so I mean

2310
03:09:02,200 --> 03:09:07,280
really all they added with the 3ds is an analog nub and 3d and the 3d is just

2311
03:09:07,280 --> 03:09:12,560
kind of it and their launch lineup was kind of meh so that's why the 3ds

2312
03:09:12,560 --> 03:09:15,920
flopped is because they didn't have a good launch lineup didn't have any big

2313
03:09:15,920 --> 03:09:20,480
franchise I'm sorry Nintendogs fucking porting Nintendogs I'm not even gonna

2314
03:09:20,480 --> 03:09:24,580
call it a new game and adding cats because some people have cats is not a

2315
03:09:24,580 --> 03:09:29,200
fucking launch game I mean that's just terrible and pilot wings is kind of ho

2316
03:09:29,200 --> 03:09:33,480
hum it was three three activities that you could do on woohoo Island that no

2317
03:09:33,480 --> 03:09:37,360
one gives a shit about woohoo Island is not fucking character Mario is a

2318
03:09:37,360 --> 03:09:41,160
character link is a character woohoo Island no one gives a shit I want woohoo

2319
03:09:41,160 --> 03:09:45,200
Island to be a fighter in the next Smash Brothers I would like to see that but

2320
03:09:45,200 --> 03:09:52,360
that's not gonna happen but um so that's why it tanked is because of that and I

2321
03:09:52,360 --> 03:09:56,160
know people think it may tank again because it didn't do so well in Japan

2322
03:09:56,160 --> 03:10:00,000
but Japanese people are fickle they they like some things they don't like some

2323
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:04,880
things they like dating sim games we don't like dating sim games I don't know

2324
03:10:04,880 --> 03:10:09,960
it's just weird so um I think it has a good chance because their launch lineup

2325
03:10:09,960 --> 03:10:14,120
is fucking awesome I mean they've got a lot of games coming out and it's not

2326
03:10:14,120 --> 03:10:18,600
like hey look here's our launch lineup and then we have one 3ds game coming out

2327
03:10:18,600 --> 03:10:24,000
each month I mean we're talking like a lot of games and it's gonna be Vita Vita

2328
03:10:24,000 --> 03:10:28,200
Vita all I will say PlayStation does seem to have really good third-party

2329
03:10:28,200 --> 03:10:32,440
support out the gate as opposed to third-party support eventually and and

2330
03:10:32,440 --> 03:10:36,800
it's also pretty you know powerful technology wise I mean the screen looks

2331
03:10:36,800 --> 03:10:42,460
nice it's got dual analog sticks which is gonna be great for porting games over

2332
03:10:42,460 --> 03:10:45,040
or creating you know first-person shooter games and that kind of stuff

2333
03:10:45,040 --> 03:10:48,840
because you actually have some decent controls there except you know unlike

2334
03:10:48,840 --> 03:10:53,680
the 3ds where you're gonna force people to use the analog stick and then the

2335
03:10:53,680 --> 03:10:58,360
touchscreen and oh it's very fucking uncomfortable so let's throw in the

2336
03:10:58,360 --> 03:11:02,880
stand we're gonna have a kickstand on this fucker that we're gonna put out

2337
03:11:02,880 --> 03:11:06,800
with this game because it's just not gonna work well yeah that's stupid if

2338
03:11:06,800 --> 03:11:11,400
you've got to add accessories to your stupid system because oh I forgot to put

2339
03:11:11,400 --> 03:11:14,800
some buttons on there and oh this is really fucking uncomfortable to hold

2340
03:11:14,800 --> 03:11:21,480
then then you got a problem all right Rama he's made his case we'll see we'll

2341
03:11:21,480 --> 03:11:24,680
see a lot a lot of questions to be answered over the next month and see

2342
03:11:24,680 --> 03:11:28,840
what the numbers look like when the system comes out all right Rama anything

2343
03:11:28,840 --> 03:11:32,480
else quickly before we let you go I'm kind of floored because I actually

2344
03:11:32,480 --> 03:11:37,800
agree with Loki on that hmm I mean I do and I understand where he's coming from

2345
03:11:37,800 --> 03:11:44,160
I mean the Vita is a much more powerful system it it's there but the way I see

2346
03:11:44,160 --> 03:11:48,260
it is that the consumers can look at like I could do all this look at the

2347
03:11:48,260 --> 03:11:52,940
price put it down and they can go pick up a 3ds or something like that I think

2348
03:11:52,940 --> 03:11:56,480
that's what it's coming down to right about now it's all about the price point

2349
03:11:56,480 --> 03:11:59,760
yeah but people are comfortable in pain that's kinds of price points because

2350
03:11:59,760 --> 03:12:03,960
people are buying tablets and they're buying all this other electronic garbage

2351
03:12:03,960 --> 03:12:07,000
that's really expensive well the price point is not that big a deal anymore

2352
03:12:07,000 --> 03:12:11,560
well I don't know about that most people are buying tablets or iPad users because

2353
03:12:11,560 --> 03:12:16,760
they're buying because it's an iPad you know people people shell out that type

2354
03:12:16,760 --> 03:12:20,200
of money but you know but iPads aren't the only tablets out there and there's

2355
03:12:20,200 --> 03:12:24,560
definitely plenty of them being sold yeah but those are but those tablets

2356
03:12:24,560 --> 03:12:32,080
cost less or less expensive than the iPad I mean okay between a $500 iPad and

2357
03:12:32,080 --> 03:12:37,600
a $200 Kindle fire I'll I will drop 200 on the Kindle fire so you'll drop $200

2358
03:12:37,600 --> 03:12:42,800
on a Kindle fire but you won't drop $200 on a fucking via I see how it is no no

2359
03:12:42,800 --> 03:12:47,880
no no you get my words twisted Loki but I respect you for that all right I have

2360
03:12:47,880 --> 03:12:51,040
to put it into this we got to wrap up the show right all right Rama thank you

2361
03:12:51,040 --> 03:12:55,440
very much for your call good luck no problem take care later run John all

2362
03:12:55,440 --> 03:12:58,920
right well he didn't hear that he'll hear it on the air all right so really

2363
03:12:58,920 --> 03:13:02,760
the Skype was really you gotta buy a system that's less less expensive than

2364
03:13:02,760 --> 03:13:07,700
the other system that's how it is so I mean that's that's the argument me well

2365
03:13:07,700 --> 03:13:12,240
you know the iPads $500 so you know spending $250 on this tablet it's not

2366
03:13:12,240 --> 03:13:18,120
that big a deal wait what doesn't make any sense all right we got to wrap up

2367
03:13:18,120 --> 03:13:21,600
the show we ran long tonight but that's okay why it was worth it for the phone

2368
03:13:21,600 --> 03:13:27,360
call with Aska earlier on it was fun so I'm who I've been chatting but I knew

2369
03:13:27,360 --> 03:13:30,560
you would I need to be braiding each other's hair within minutes this is a
