14020	25624	Tonight, February 26, 2012, Sony pulls an app from the Vita just days after release, Pokemon has new sequels announced, and big companies team up for a portable console game collaboration.
31897	39542	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
39662	49369	We are live right now, Sunday, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
49809	53451	It is February 26th, episode 447.
54252	55713	I'll be joining you over the next few hours.
55753	57674	My name is Rob Roberts with my co-hosts.
57834	60536	Say hello to Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers.
60736	60936	Hi.
61257	61577	How are you?
62237	62537	All right.
62957	63398	You all right?
63498	63998	Just all right?
64578	65818	Yeah, it's been trying.
65838	66559	But you had salad.
67499	68599	Salad makes it all better.
68719	72001	I did, but I just put balsamic vinegar in, not the kind of dressing I wanted.
72021	72901	All right.
73021	75122	So it didn't turn out all that great, and I'm feeling kind of sick now.
75462	75622	Aw.
75722	77102	Well, I hope the show can cheer you up.
77322	81944	We're going to have a fun few hours tonight talking about video games and stuff with, of course, our other co-hosts.
81964	84225	Say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
84485	84886	Hello.
85086	85707	How are you, Loki?
85947	86348	I'm fine.
86649	91797	All right, starting it off tonight, a popular game we like to play for the show is, what did Loki bring to dinner tonight?
91897	94041	So, Loki, what did you bring to dinner for the show tonight?
94061	96926	I brought Taco Bell, but I actually wasn't that hungry.
96966	97707	I didn't finish it.
98251	103114	Now, and I asked you this before the show, did you try to win another PlayStation Vita at Taco Bell?
103154	104895	What made you decide to go to Taco Bell?
105836	118764	You know, it's funny, because I actually really hate Taco Bell, or at least I used to really hate Taco Bell, and so I just started eating Taco Bell, because I guess I'm less picky on what I'm eating now, so...
119589	125195	I got the steak quesadilla, which is hardly steak, but it's a quesadilla.
125936	128598	All right, look, I don't need the entire play-by-play.
129679	130580	And two crunchy tacos.
130941	139970	The reason why I'm kind of bringing this up is because I remember just before the show, I was reading about the Taco Bell is in a lot of trouble over this Vita promotion.
140290	140670	What is this?
140710	143073	A bunch of people got an email that said they won.
143513	144593	You just won a freaking PlayStation Vita!
159299	161020	Thank you for watching!
174505	174925	DarkSakura.com
194103	194964	So, okay.
195064	202149	So the company that's marketing this for Taco Bell is terrible, apparently.
202490	202810	Fired?
203370	204711	Well, yeah, among other things.
204771	205452	Well, now there's room.
205952	207353	They have a whole Facebook page.
207754	209555	I was reading through that because, you know, I love drama.
209835	214599	So I was reading through their Facebook page and all these, you know, very angry people, which, you know, I can imagine, especially.
215079	219002	I mean, I understand someone may have gamed the game, but I think...
220123	226288	I think there legitimately is probably a lot of people that did actually win that are getting screwed by this.
244481	249544	I don't know, but I didn't do all my research because this literally came up before the show.
249564	253926	They had something else on the local news that was like one of those call Curtis or something like that.
254006	257448	Oh yeah, investigative reports, consumer watchdog.
258008	259209	Yeah, something like that.
259229	260730	They were checking stuff out.
262871	269714	I think, honestly, for anybody that got that page, it says upon verification.
269814	272175	Now, if you have the winning code, I mean, how...
273616	287165	Unless, I mean, unless they actually come out, okay, here's a list of code numbers that were winning codes, you know, which that's not going to come out unless, you know, there's some investigation stuff done during the whole court process.
287646	291988	But, you know, how are you going to be able to prove that you have a winning code?
292028	292509	You can't.
293029	295651	I mean, because it's up to Taco Bell to say, no, no, you didn't.
296184	301131	Yeah, I know you saw that, but it was upon verification, and we verified your code is not a winning code.
302093	310164	But apparently also, I guess the website shows who's won each time there's a winner, and it hasn't updated for a long time.
310485	312508	Well, now because the thing's broken, who knows?
312888	313229	I don't know.
313429	315411	It's all messed up.
315751	322519	It's going to be interesting to see the legal things that come out of this or what the promotion company behind this whole thing is going to have to do.
322679	323040	We'll see.
323400	326263	If anything, they'll probably try to sweep it under the rug, but we'll see.
327705	328786	All right.
329006	336451	Anyhow, I want to give a shout out to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com where folks talk live with us as we do tape, of course, every Sunday night.
336751	340114	chat.orangeloungeradio.com I'll let acidic vampire start us off tonight.
340154	341275	And chat says, hello, people.
341775	342636	Fuck the Oscars.
343776	344897	Because yes, it is Sunday.
344957	351021	And inevitably, there's always freaking something on TV on Sundays, whether it be the Grammys or the Tonys.
351081	355224	And tonight it's the Oscars, which is kind of a big deal for some people.
355365	356766	We need the buddies.
356786	357226	The buddies?
357246	357426	Yeah.
357731	363818	Yeah, we have the, you know, just like a complete, this is what we think of your award show.
364499	372428	Next year we need to have the Schmoskers where we do some type of, you know, video game related Oscar thing on the show, but that would require planning.
372868	373428	Let me think.
398081	398761	Justin Bieber?
399081	399962	No, not Justin Bieber.
400242	406824	Twilight was nominated for Worst Picture, but Adam Sandler got nominated for like three different movies.
406904	410185	And that Jack and Jill, he's nominated for Worst Picture.
410205	411245	That's a winner right there.
411325	411805	There you go.
412406	413326	That is a winner.
413566	415307	That's a winning loser right there.
415827	416647	It's the biggest loser.
416987	421409	And hey, I'm going to go out on a limb here and predict another possible winning.
421469	424690	Well, it's definitely going to be a winner coming soon from Adam Sandler as well.
424970	425610	Candyland.
425630	425850	Candyland.
427277	435804	Oh god, is that the whole, like Battleship and all these board games, apparently Clue's gonna get another movie Hasbro, yeah He's doing Candyland?
437125	452417	Oh, that's kind of disturbing, like, ah, I need bleach Alright, look, we need to move on, games So, before we get into our gaming week, so I guess this might be a little bit about gaming weeks But Vita, okay, everybody's got Vita fever this week because the system officially launched Vita
452637	456059	So we had a lot of people talking about it last week with the pre-launch, whatever.
456439	458281	Now the system officially launched this week.
458661	461803	I got my hot little hands on Evita, and I think a lot of you out there did.
461863	466346	I realize there are some other people that are like, no one care, because, you know, there's always got to be the haters.
467266	477032	And then there's, of course, a lot of other people that I think this is where a lot of people fit into is like, I'll probably get one when the price comes down or when XYZ game comes out.
477473	479974	Speaking of the price coming down, let me start off with this.
480154	480375	You...
481135	485498	We're pretty angry on Twitter this week at a story about the price coming down.
485538	489660	This whole games analysts are analyzing the system two days after it launches.
490001	490781	What was this all about?
490981	498926	Well, they were like going, oh, it's not selling well, or like, oh, it hasn't sold that many copies.
498946	500687	I don't even know where they're getting data yet.
500767	502128	I don't even think they have data.
502809	505771	Now, obviously, they were looking at Japan, but that doesn't mean anything.
505811	506151	I mean, that...
506491	513697	If we're basing our information off of what goes on in Japan, then the Xbox 360 is doomed because it just doesn't sell well in Japan.
514297	519461	But yeah, they're already saying, oh, the price drop needs to happen now.
519781	522923	It's like, dude, it just came out.
523504	528848	How are you coming to this conclusion of what sales are yet?
529208	531550	I mean, it just came out.
531610	533572	You're going to get day one sales and that's it.
534632	536853	I mean, look at the 3DS.
537093	541695	If you were going to look at the 3DS, you know, day one sales or whatever, I'm sure they were terrible.
542855	554179	Well, it also seems like the Vita, you know, I'm really trying to be impartial here and not sound like a Sony fanboy, but I got to be honest, the Vita seems to have a better launch projection over the next few months than the 3DS had.
554499	559021	It seems like they've got some big titles evenly spaced out to keep it interesting.
559061	560781	Like what, Little Big Planets next month?
560841	561561	That's going to be a big deal.
561581	562662	Yeah, Little Big Planets next...
563602	565004	Resistance in a few months.
584386	585006	I have problems.
585287	587448	The Namcom game comes out this coming month.
587468	592010	I mean, the Vita's got a lot of stuff coming for it, whereas the 3DS was hurting.
592070	595372	I mean, there was really... I mean, their biggest launch title was what?
595532	601455	The Street Fighter 4 that was already... Sadly, Ridge Racer is pretty good.
601876	602016	Um...
603780	606503	It was actually... I would think it was a pretty good 3DS game.
606543	607044	No, it was.
607124	608465	It was just funny the way you phrased that.
608545	613851	Sadly, Ridge Racer... Well, I mean, Ridge Racer, to be honest, it doesn't change.
614252	616334	I mean, it hasn't changed in a long time.
618657	620298	So, yeah, I mean, they've got a lot of...
621079	625581	The Vita titles, I mean, there was like a good 30 Vita titles at launch.
626402	627983	That's a lot.
628143	631865	I mean, and there's still... And there's some crap, but there's some, like, little deviants.
632245	632645	Well, yeah.
632665	634166	But there's some really good stuff, too.
634606	637428	You know, like one game I want to talk about, Luminous.
638728	639428	Which is hotness.
640008	640629	Let me put it this way.
641429	645750	I am a huge whore for all things Q Entertainment, and I've been that way on this show for a long, long time.
646170	650151	Luminous, Meteos, Gunpei, Every Extend, all their games.
651171	653212	I freaking defended 99 Nights on this show.
653252	654072	It's not that bad.
655072	655892	It's not that bad.
655912	657753	Did you get the sequel?
659645	678832	I don't want to talk about that alright but Luminous like I bought the original Luminous I bought Luminous 2 I bought Luminous on Xbox I bought Luminous on Steam so yes of course I bought this new Luminous game and I'll tell you what it really is the best freaking one yet and I'm amazed to say that because I will say Luminous has had its weak points I don't think that Xbox Live version of Luminous was very good
680427	680807	and DarkSakura.
703073	704474	But anyway, don't get me excited, Loki.
704494	706875	But no, this Luminous game is so good.
706975	710236	It is this generation's Tetris.
710316	712177	It is that freaking good.
712417	718380	But again, I'm fully admitting, I have been in love with almost everything.
719080	720421	and Tetsuya Mizuguchi's ever done.
720662	722923	You know, all the way back to like Space Channel 5 and all that.
722983	727847	So, you know, of course there's this built-in love for this game but it's really hot on the Vita.
728388	731350	It shows off a lot of the functionality without being ridiculous.
731710	734272	Like you can use the back touchpad but you don't have to.
734553	736794	You can use touch controls but you don't have to.
737115	738436	You know, there's a lot of good stuff to it.
738496	740738	And I like the way it ties into the internet with the big block.
741138	743900	Although there's some serious balancing issues with the XP but whatever.
744280	746802	And the song list is so...
747884	748304	Good.
748564	749705	It is so good.
750025	752767	Like I know Loki and I had a talk on Bobby's show about this.
752787	763755	Yeah, I know he doesn't agree with me totally, but I think the song list is because it's recognizable enough without them having to have shilled out all this money for AAA licenses like they did with Luminous 2.
764195	769959	Because like Luminous 2 had Missy Elliott and Beck and Gwen Stefani, which some of it seemed really oddly out of place.
770039	775042	But this song is that perfect match of, oh, hey, this is a song by Faithless.
775062	776003	I think I heard them before.
776023	776063	Oh,
776343	776863	Goldfrapp!
776883	777423	They're pretty cool.
777463	777984	Here's a song.
778624	780004	There's just enough.
780245	781945	And it's not usually their biggest hit.
782025	783266	That's the other thing I'm noticing.
783486	786127	There's a Benny Benassi song in it, but it's not Satisfaction.
786927	789088	There's a Beloved song in it, but it's not Sweet Harmony.
789148	793390	It's a really neat way they kind of came up with that song list.
793790	795491	And the skins are gorgeous.
795531	797291	The original tracks they've mixed in are good too.
797792	799032	Love, love, love, love.
799592	802433	It's an early contender for my game of the year, honestly and truly.
802513	803354	But again...
804884	805684	I knew I was going to like this game.
805704	806825	Is it your game of February?
807085	809025	It is totally my game of February.
809645	810126	Absolutely.
810146	811526	Well, I played yours.
812306	812506	Yes.
813367	823790	And my review for the Vita is Owl My Hand because of how high up the buttons are on the right side because, again, I had hand surgery.
824130	826271	It's holding my hand in that position actually kind of hurt.
827211	831612	I tried using the touchscreen for Luminous which was actually a little hard.
832973	833173	But...
835174	837815	Luminous was awesome when I plugged in my heavy duty podcasting headphones.
853786	855047	I gotta try that at some point.
855788	856489	Sounds awesome.
857350	857670	Let's see.
858091	860213	Let's go to another question here from Frisbee.
860874	862236	Is the Vita worth the money?
862896	866460	That's an excellent question that I don't think I can answer with a definitive yes or no.
866841	868022	For me, yes.
869303	871585	I like to be on the cutting edge of this type of technology.
872786	875729	Now, my Vita experience has not been without problems.
876590	882115	The Katamari game, which is the other game I picked up at launch besides Luminous, froze my system the other night.
882315	885658	I'm talking it so bad where it would not wake up out of sleep mode.
886278	887918	I tried to hold down the power button.
887958	889539	Here's a tip if you get into this problem.
889559	890339	Put it into a coma?
890599	891119	Yeah, it did.
891199	894140	If you hold down, I mean, the Katamari broke it or rolled it up.
894180	894440	I don't know.
894640	906182	But you hold down the power button for about 10 seconds and you'll get a menu kind of akin to what happens when you hold down one of the function keys when you start Windows where you can do like a hard reset of the Vita.
906522	907842	You can reset all your settings.
908323	909563	I tried to do a hard reset.
909783	910383	Nothing happened.
910823	912624	I ended up erasing all my settings.
912904	913544	Nothing happened.
913584	922669	And I'm like, holy shit, I have a Vita that I'm using to play a lot of Luminous break after 24 hours.
923629	928372	But finally, I just ejected the cartridge of Katamari, woke right up.
929652	952477	and I had to reset everything and I was so mad that I'd done that so if your Vita will not wake up eject the cartridge first thing you'd think it's basic troubleshooting 101 so in other words my point is the Vita is not without its problems especially for this early adoption but what have we said for years and years and years on this program is the golden rule of gaming DarkSakura please remind the listeners a system is only as good as the games that are on it thank you trademark
952777	958641	If there is a game on the Vita or several games on the Vita that you have to have right now, yes, get one.
958981	961983	If you're a big luminous whore like me, you're not going to be disappointed.
963544	966645	If you want to get this new Katamari game, Uncharted.
966686	973890	It's not a Naughty Dog Uncharted, but I'm hearing it's okay except for the fact that they've really shoved all the touch stuff into it.
974650	978833	If you want Marvel vs. Capcom 3 on the go, you can't get that on the 3DS right now.
979793	981574	Then yeah, there might be something here worth your money.
982174	987437	But if you don't think there's something in it for you right now, don't spend the money.
988157	990898	It's really hard to kind of put a price tag on that.
991058	992839	I bought a 3DS when they were still $249.
993279	994740	I don't regret that decision.
997041	1000082	But it was kind of a weak launch lineup.
1000689	1008498	Honestly, I like the Vita, but I have the games that I want on my phone, and I'm really wanting an iPad later.
1008938	1010380	Because you know what I can do with an iPad?
1011200	1011561	IK'd.
1013376	1015378	Let me go to SSJ100 Matt in our chat room.
1015578	1017881	Is the 3G version really worth it?
1018542	1019082	I'll say this.
1019283	1021926	I bought a 3G Vita, and I'm going to answer that with a no.
1022486	1025530	I kind of think I shouldn't have done that.
1026330	1031536	And I know some of you tried to call me out on it last week, and I will admit after getting my hands on it and using it, it was a mistake.
1031636	1033719	And I kind of think they... I would say...
1034299	1040843	They really pushed it with advertising that Super Stardust Delta or whatever is an included game.
1040923	1041983	Because it's kind of BS.
1042023	1043704	The hurdles you have to jump around to get that.
1043985	1046446	And that's part of the reason I just went for the 3G.
1046766	1048587	Because I'm like, with all this value, what?
1048627	1050088	I'm paying $10 for 3G?
1050228	1051529	Okay, I might use that someday.
1051869	1052669	I'll go ahead and buy it.
1053130	1055011	I'm having a little bit of buyer's remorse on that.
1055411	1057232	However, this is very important.
1057892	1058773	I have an iPhone.
1060514	1062015	If I didn't have the iPhone...
1063464	1064445	Thank you for watching!
1083687	1090751	But if you already have a 3G device that you're paying for, the games don't play over 3G.
1091331	1092752	The 3G is for stuff like Nier.
1093072	1094513	It's for downloading patches.
1094913	1095693	That's it.
1096194	1098335	Don't expect to play head-to-head over 3G.
1098715	1100516	It would be kind of a bad experience anyway.
1101457	1104640	Yes, 3G is a lot slower than most people realize.
1105981	1111206	Yeah, I don't think I would ever use the 3G service that much, but here's the way I look at it.
1111426	1115450	The 3G one, you can make a memory card with it.
1116291	1123577	Sure, yeah, you could buy that separately and you may save some money, but at the same time, it's nice to have the option that if later on you wanted to use 3G...
1124880	1132656	or if you are paying for 3G say for example for an iPad you can literally pop that SIM card out of your iPad pop it into your Vita and oh look it works!
1133257	1134879	and DarkSakura.
1157479	1173340	I can turn on my PlayStation 3 when I'm lying in my bed with the Vita I can turn on the PlayStation 3 go in there I can play the PS1 games because right now you can't download a PS1 game to your Vita you can't like they don't have that functionality in there yet I'm assuming they're going to add it
1174000	1179603	But what you can do is if the games are on your PlayStation 3, you fire up Remote Play and you can stream it.
1179783	1184446	And it's like what they're advertising on the Wii U. You're getting the little game in there.
1184946	1187207	Now, granted, I have several games.
1187427	1193090	And I don't think Um Jamma Lammy would be a great idea to play over Remote Play because music game, lag, death, right?
1193571	1199174	But Final Fantasy V or something that the lag isn't going to be a big deal is great.
1200514	1226550	and I love the fact and one of the things I was hoping that they would do and they actually did was mapping the extra buttons and before with the PlayStation Portable you had your L2, R2 and stuff mapped to one of the analogs which is really dumb and they have it still where you can do that where you can hold select and then push a directional button or something like that and it does one of those or you can actually map it to your back touchpad which is fantastic.
1227250	1227450	L2R2, L3R3
1244528	1248689	with a $200 PlayStation 3 and what is right now a $250 Vita.
1249149	1251450	That's $450 for this technology.
1251770	1256791	And I got to say, this Vita, probably a lot better than that tablet controller that Wii U is coming with.
1257092	1264694	So there is no possible way, there is no possible, possible way that Wii U can get away with charging $450.
1265074	1268455	And I would argue there is no way that Wii U can get away with charging $400.
1270376	1291128	and in fact I think the bar needs to go even lower and if they try to blame the technology absolute utter total bullshit we're looking at it right now with the Vita and the PlayStation 3 the Nintendo if they want to win with the Wii U they've got to be able to deliver this technology cheaper and they've got to integrate it a little bit better because right now there is no you know besides what I just mentioned there's not a whole lot to do with remote play
1291608	1295829	But then again, it just came out a couple days ago.
1295849	1299430	That's true, and Sony is very good at adding features.
1299750	1303451	And I gotta say, they saved the PS3 through some of that.
1303471	1304051	What can I say?
1304931	1306811	Out of the box, I have a web browser.
1307152	1312973	I didn't have to wait months for a patch to unlock the web browser function, which that web browser was terrible in the 3DS.
1313533	1317894	But we have to be fair, and the Vita is missing some things it should have.
1317934	1322755	Like the whole fact that it doesn't play PS1 games right now when the PSP did it, that's a little like, what?
1323355	1323675	What?
1324335	1328096	I mean, you can do it through remote play, but it's a little weird that that's not there.
1329436	1336578	They probably haven't built a new emulator for it, and they could probably do it emulating the PSP, emulating the PlayStation 1, which would be weird.
1336998	1342799	But they probably want to see if they can improve upon it, make it, you know, hey, look, the graphics look nicer or something like that.
1343159	1343299	Mm-hmm.
1344716	1348157	So anyhow, I'll talk a little more about Vita games when we get to my gaming week.
1348337	1349338	I want to go around.
1349378	1351378	We always start off the show with how was your gaming week?
1351418	1355200	I guess we've kind of already been doing that, but maybe there's stuff not on the Vita.
1355220	1356180	We'll start with DarkSakura.
1356640	1358381	Well, I played well.
1359922	1360142	Addict.
1360922	1361262	Dealer.
1362983	1366584	And I made a new friend, so I'd like to give a shout out to Renee, who I asked to listen tonight.
1367506	1368327	Hi Renee!
1368347	1368968	Hi!
1371691	1374233	I was going to play some Portal 2.
1374474	1375995	I played a lot of being pissed off.
1376916	1378678	So this is the problem I had.
1378718	1381321	You know how you have 50 million channels and nothing's on?
1382402	1384184	I was looking at the collection.
1385445	1393830	We had some Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, which mostly was Dan playing and screaming at the TV, because Galactus, even on Super Easy, is a cheap bitch.
1395991	1399173	But I was looking at the games, and I was like, I don't want to play this.
1399313	1399974	I don't want to play this.
1400054	1400674	I don't want to play this.
1400694	1401254	I don't want to play this.
1401595	1402695	Where is Blue Dragon?
1403656	1408298	And I could not find Blue Dragon, and I was mad, and I wanted to... Do you want to borrow mine?
1408619	1409559	I have the game.
1410039	1410380	Okay.
1411120	1412281	So then I was like...
1415052	1418355	So then I was like, I'm going to play BlazBlue.
1418976	1419196	What?
1419276	1419997	It's not open?
1420998	1421419	Crap.
1421499	1424381	Because I don't like to open things that aren't already open.
1424882	1426544	So then I was like, I'm going to play Jumping Flash.
1427645	1431028	And I could not find Jumping Flash, even though it was probably right in front of me.
1431649	1433691	So I was like, I'm just not going to play anything.
1433731	1434071	And I took a nap.
1434091	1437094	I'm just surprised that you couldn't see those old PlayStation 1 cases.
1437134	1438716	They were the size of a small house.
1439076	1453485	We have them in the back room, and keep in mind, we have the cases that size also encompass our Sega Saturn collection, encompass the Sega CD collection, and we have a bunch of early PS1 games.
1454025	1454826	Thanks for watching!
1469401	1471342	Yeah, I was like, I don't want to open this.
1471362	1471862	It is pretty tough.
1473642	1476003	And it's going to get staticky and stick to my hand.
1476063	1477203	And I was like, I don't want to.
1477483	1480624	That is the ultimate laziest thing I've ever heard in my entire life.
1480664	1481524	Congratulations.
1481744	1485826	You know, I finally opened my copy of... Because it ended with, and then I took a nap.
1488806	1492947	The shrink wrap monster proved too difficult that I went to go take a nap.
1494088	1495828	I'm just calling it like I see it.
1495848	1497289	You know I love you, but damn lazy.
1499110	1527021	I was tired anyway so bite me but um oh god what else was it that I was it was like I wanted to play certain things and I couldn't find them and I was frustrated so then I was gonna play Project Diva no no no no there's more cause remember I was loaned by one of our lovely listeners um Project Diva oh right right right and I could not find our PSP charger I tore up everything and Dan's like oh it's in the bin actually I think it's at my mom's house
1527871	1528311	and DarkSakura.com.
1550852	1553234	Oh, like the old... Yeah, some puzzle game.
1553354	1555556	I also did play Castlevania the Puzzle.
1556417	1557918	Freaking sucks on the iPhone.
1557958	1561321	You cannot... It's like, oh, we're going to show both of the screens at the same time.
1561421	1568106	No, it doesn't work because you have to move it with your fingers and the little blocks are too small and then, oh, sorry, you're just going to drop the ball.
1569507	1570708	You know the only good thing about that?
1571068	1571509	The music.
1572109	1572529	That's it.
1573590	1576953	And, you know, Dracula being a pimp.
1578005	1581147	Techness in our chatroom at chat.orange.com says about your story.
1581548	1583589	Sounds like a great first world problem, man.
1584069	1589073	You know, I would like to see an FU comic on Jamie's story.
1592515	1593116	Shrink wrap.
1593576	1594176	FU.
1594877	1596698	Actually, you know how my brain translates that?
1597099	1597279	What?
1597339	1598159	I hear it phonetically.
1602322	1603703	That's how my brain translates that.
1603783	1605264	You sound like a scary monster.
1605684	1606285	Don't do that.
1608789	1609909	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1612270	1614450	I played some of the Vita stuff, basically.
1616571	1618771	Call of Duty, more of that.
1618811	1624233	We got a sixth person in on our games now, so it's more than merry.
1625533	1627233	I played more Luminous.
1627633	1630414	Although, see, during the week, I've...
1631054	1656367	there was more rumors that some of those demos might have been full games so i had to clear some space off um and i accidentally well i deleted my you know how i install some like some stuff for like each game that you pop in there so you have little icons i deleted one of those apparently that also deletes your save for luminous or whatever so i deleted my save for luminous apparently that's because it said oh hey you started playing luminous for the first time like no i haven't i played it before um
1656647	1661270	If you clear your system settings, the same thing happens where it's all, you just played Luminous for the first time.
1661290	1661670	Liar!
1661930	1671916	Even before that, though, I had some weird stuff where it wouldn't get any XP for the stuff that I did, so that was a little funky.
1673917	1677459	And then, let's see, play more Rayman Origins, which is pretty fun.
1677799	1678980	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1708898	1713862	Beat, Touch My Katamari, or at least I finished the last level in the game.
1716404	1726813	I kind of don't want to buy any more Katamari games anymore because it's kind of disappointing because they're never as good as the first few games.
1726913	1730076	They're whipping that same horse over and over and over again.
1730436	1731778	Seriously, the last level...
1732418	1733198	Thanks for watching!
1754985	1776594	and then I unlocked some of the Eternal stages for those which you get candy for that stuff too so I don't know why you wouldn't do the Eternal stages so I did those and I bought the King of Cosmos some new clothes because he wanted some really flamboyant stuff and
1777134	1779977	So I made him even more flamboyant, if that's possible.
1779997	1783320	Yeah, my favorite is that the first thing he asked me for was a bridal cape.
1783661	1785923	Yes, that's the one I got for him, the bridal cape.
1785983	1789426	I'm like, okay, everybody has their thing.
1791568	1792629	I'm not one to judge.
1793230	1794751	Exactly, it was just really weird.
1795672	1797814	So I did that, and then...
1800034	1800834	What else did they play?
1801014	1804175	I didn't play Little Defiance yet because I really don't want to play that game.
1804195	1805056	It looks like crap.
1805116	1808337	I actually played some of the Welcome Park stuff and tried to unlock trophies in that.
1808617	1810998	Some of those games are actually kind of hard.
1811078	1815719	The Welcome Park stuff for built-in games is, you know, it's all right.
1815839	1818500	I've got to ask you, did you try some of those AR games?
1820826	1823368	I did, and I don't like them
1844207	1845268	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1861247	1881020	and I'm not that far away from this stuff I mean I'm maybe like three feet away from the actual cards which I think is pretty reasonable but it just wasn't working and then the fireworks one was kind of neat but the game's kind of dumb and once again I was getting the out of range error even though I could see all the cards through the
1881567	1887930	you know, the screen, so I don't know what the issue was there, but I mean, I'm sure it's just some bugs that'll get worked out.
1888451	1890952	And the games are free, so whatever.
1892133	1892353	But, um...
1894649	1895030	What else?
1895230	1896891	Oh, I tried the Unit 13 demo.
1897051	1897892	That was actually pretty good.
1898072	1898572	I like that.
1899673	1900934	Not my type of game, really.
1900954	1902475	I'm not really huge into the SOCOM.
1902495	1902856	What is it?
1903156	1903836	It's like SOCOM.
1903876	1905598	It's done by the guys at Zipper Interactive.
1905698	1908300	It's a third-person squad shooter game.
1908340	1908540	Sure.
1909000	1910101	And it's okay.
1910241	1911282	Those tend to sell pretty well.
1911482	1916426	Yeah, it's all right, but it's not my... I'm not really into that.
1916846	1924012	Resistance, no, the new Resistance game, I'm definitely going to be picking up probably, but this one was not too big for me.
1925226	1928429	Gripper01 in our chatroom says the Vita needs a decent pinball game.
1929069	1929770	Good call.
1931411	1934073	I don't see why there won't be a pinball FX on it soon enough.
1934253	1935094	That actually reminds me.
1935834	1938036	I forgot to mention we sold Lord of the Rings.
1939153	1939273	Oh.
1940214	1941294	Bye, Lord of the Rings.
1941634	1941814	Yep.
1942074	1942715	Just saying.
1942995	1944536	The precious is gone.
1944876	1945416	Thank God.
1945656	1947237	I mean, I'm tired of that game.
1947257	1948778	Did you take it to Mount Mordor?
1949598	1949938	No.
1950498	1951619	Sauron came and picked it up.
1951739	1952639	He was really nice, too.
1952719	1953480	Very personable guy.
1953680	1958182	One does not simply multi-ball into Mount Mordor.
1958502	1985847	I will say this, if they do put out Pinball FX on the Vita, I think that would be a great game for the rear touchpad to use the flippers and you could turn it so it's a long screen instead of the wide screen I mean, you know, those guys that designed Pinball FX they've already done games on wide screen televisions and they work fine but imagine with the Vita, you could turn it the other way and that would be a pretty kick-butt screen and there were some import shooters from Japan that
1986227	1992131	We're using the long screen for the PSP back in the day, so I'd be down for that.
1992311	2002397	I really do feel like there's more potential to be unlocked with the Vita, but to be fair, the 3DS has done a pretty good job of unlocking more as we go, too.
2002617	2004458	So it's on now.
2005719	2006239	So there you go.
2007540	2008400	What else for your gaming week?
2008440	2008700	Anything?
2010521	2010901	That was it.
2011321	2011541	All right.
2011581	2015162	Well, Loki already mentioned Touch My Katamari, which was another... One thing, real quick.
2015342	2016343	Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
2016443	2016823	Real quick.
2016983	2029127	Just one thing I just wanted to mention that was absent from my gaming week, and that was the new download content for Saints Row III because I am not buying into this bullshit download content crap that they're putting out these really terrible pieces of... Ooh, what happened?
2029227	2029587	Not good?
2029867	2035452	Well, the last one they put out was really short, and it was $7 for about an hour's worth of content.
2036513	2038534	And it was just kind of like cheap bullshit.
2039595	2040296	So I waited.
2040576	2045460	I waited to hear the reviews on it, and sure enough, someone's like, oh yeah, I beat it in 30 minutes.
2045480	2045741	$7 still.
2046361	2046722	Fuck that.
2047062	2047782	Nope, not doing it.
2048543	2049064	That's too bad.
2049524	2051566	Saints Row had a lot going for it when it first came out.
2051826	2053167	They kind of ruined it.
2053567	2054008	That's too bad.
2054788	2055069	All right.
2056810	2057370	My Game of the Week.
2057410	2058931	I also play Touch My Katamari.
2059431	2064232	I feel similarly to where Loki's at, you know, like, oh, yeah, I like Katamari.
2064272	2067213	It's a good game, but it's been kind of the same damn game.
2067513	2070694	It's kind of like Sonic the Hedgehog coming out on every platform.
2070714	2071914	You're like, oh, it's Sonic.
2071974	2073935	I used to love this game and I'm playing it again.
2074695	2079636	And again, I'm playing the same game again and nothing's changed.
2079736	2082397	And now the nostalgia is worn off and I think I'm done now.
2083853	2087556	I also played Sonic the Hedgehog on PlayStation 3 this week, for real.
2087936	2089758	It was one of the free PlayStation Plus games.
2090038	2096102	PlayStation Plus is having this whole Genesis nostalgia fest thing going on, so whatever.
2096162	2103347	Which is weird, because yes, I have the Sonic Mega Genesis collection, so you might be thinking, why are you wasting the space on your hard drive to download it?
2103387	2104108	And my answer is...
2104648	2105509	Trophies.
2106209	2107590	I must have trophies.
2108751	2109911	So I tried to unlock some trophies.
2110532	2115655	And one game I will say I unlocked a shit ton of trophies in is Altered Beast, which I also played this week.
2116455	2118657	Rise from your grave.
2119457	2126541	If there isn't a game that we have seen through thicker rose-colored glasses in our lives, it's Altered Beast.
2126601	2131124	Because I'll tell you what, I remember being a kid thinking that game was badass.
2131704	2133506	And it was in the arcade.
2134446	2136527	for 25 cents for a few minute thrill.
2137207	2151795	But what they decided to port over on the PlayStation 3, which granted is the exact same thing they have on Xbox Live Arcade, was the Genesis version, which at the time was great, but...
2152455	2155416	Now it looks a lot like Pac-Man on the Atari 2600.
2156016	2157837	I mean, it's bad.
2159037	2160197	It's a bad game.
2160717	2166639	And some of the horrible noises it was making made me think my PlayStation 3 was about to spontaneously combust.
2167459	2175702	And I ask you, have any of you actually played Altered Beast to Stage 5 all the way to the last stage of the game?
2175962	2176282	Yes.
2177182	2180223	What in the fuck are those unicorn tranny monsters?
2182301	2182981	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2203979	2208402	Look, I'm just... Before you send in the hate mail and say... No, no, no, no.
2208462	2210223	I'm finding pictures of them for everybody.
2210804	2215867	I'm telling you, these unicorn monsters are a little funky.
2215967	2217288	Like, it's just, what is this?
2217388	2218148	Who designed this?
2218309	2218909	I can't even.
2219950	2228235	So, yeah, I played Altered Beast all the way to the end, got my trophy, then promptly deleted it from my hard drive because, damn, that's a bad game.
2229256	2229336	Um...
2231013	2237358	Otherwise, more WoW, more Final Fantasy XIII Tube and trying to get a little further in that.
2237759	2239260	And that's about the extent of my week.
2239300	2240221	I mean, I did have the Vita.
2240261	2243003	I literally played Luminous like nothing but Luminous one night.
2243023	2244424	I thought Stage 5 was the Rhino monsters.
2246406	2248347	Is there a stage missing in the Genesis version?
2250028	2250929	It's the Hell level.
2251790	2254012	And you turn into the exact same monster you were in Level 1.
2254052	2254172	So...
2257543	2263066	TigerClaw in our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com says, Altered Beast is in need of a serious reboot.
2263866	2264967	I'd be down with that.
2265227	2267188	A serious reboot, yes.
2267228	2269189	I mean, there's some pretty cool concepts in Altered Beast.
2269850	2272971	But those levels became laughably easy once you became the beast.
2273031	2275893	It's just kind of getting there can be a pain in the ass sometimes.
2276493	2278374	So, all right.
2278414	2278714	Anyhow.
2280035	2283097	That's it for my gaming week, so let's talk about housekeeping.
2283518	2288942	Join us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, or you can join us on Twitter as well, twitter.com slash OLR.
2289282	2290983	Get in your tweets for tonight's show.
2292244	2298009	As far as I can tell, we don't have any shows off planned in the next few weeks, so OLR every Sunday for a little while.
2298649	2302292	Let's get into some gaming news and what is going on in the gaming world this week.
2302432	2303433	Loki's going to start it off.
2303740	2309374	Yes, so let's start off by talking about one of the... What was it?
2309996	2311620	What project did they call that?
2311800	2312081	It was...
2314392	2315293	No, not Downpour.
2316514	2320076	That whole campaign to get those really awesome... Operation Rainfall.
2320116	2320657	That's right.
2320697	2322038	I was thinking Downpour.
2322618	2323499	Project Downpour.
2324220	2326001	Downpour would be the new Silent Hill title.
2326942	2328463	Yes, Operation Rainfall.
2329343	2334267	So, the last story has been confirmed to be coming to North America in 2012.
2334507	2334888	Well, summer 2012.
2334948	2335648	Well, June 19th, 2012.
2336269	2336309	Um...
2342273	2343834	And it's actually, it's kind of cool.
2343894	2348337	It's not going to be one of those, oh, you have to buy the GameStop order directly from Nintendo.
2348357	2356281	It's actually being ported over by Exceed, which is probably going to have the easiest localization job ever because it's going to be going from English to English.
2358543	2361985	So that's just money handed right to them, basically.
2363386	2369189	So yeah, that'll be coming out later this year and is a pretty epic RPG for Mistwalker.
2370543	2371243	We have a date for that?
2372364	2373865	Well, they're saying summer 2012.
2374345	2378667	What I've seen from XSEED is June 19th, 2012.
2378707	2380328	That would be summer.
2380768	2381468	That would be summer.
2381528	2383169	And just in time for my birthday.
2383289	2383809	Yay.
2383889	2385390	So, I mean, dates can change.
2386270	2388271	But June 19th.
2389312	2391193	Downpour, by the way, was a Silent Hill game.
2391513	2392733	I think you got confused there.
2393014	2395855	No, I said Downpour is the next Silent Hill game that's coming out.
2396656	2397797	Just looking at the chat room.
2397877	2399820	Alan Wake, Silent Hill-ish game.
2400140	2400581	Exactly.
2400921	2401923	Alan Hill.
2401983	2405587	I found the picture, by the way.
2407049	2408031	Let me see this.
2408091	2408371	Hold on.
2408411	2409032	We'll come back to that.
2411235	2412935	Yes, what are those things?
2413095	2413876	Explain it to me.
2415416	2416256	I have no idea.
2416896	2417696	They're trinicorns.
2417776	2420777	Get that on the Tumblr so the podcast listeners can refer to this.
2420857	2421957	I'll give it to Ranma to do it.
2421977	2422317	Thank you.
2422858	2426798	Because I want the podcast-y listeners to be able to see this too if they're not live.
2427459	2428519	Anyhow, where were we?
2428679	2429639	Vita, Silent Hill.
2429679	2432140	I didn't know there was an exclusive Silent Hill game on the Vita.
2432280	2433320	Yeah, Book of Memories.
2433340	2433660	Really?
2434278	2434598	DarkSakura.com
2453160	2456184	I don't have the money to buy all these games.
2456224	2457266	Maybe you'll have a demo.
2457306	2457926	There you go.
2457967	2458307	That'll be fair.
2458327	2459609	I wanted to say though about the last story.
2459649	2459669	A,
2468080	2469221	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2487250	2489831	Freaking nine months to play it.
2490172	2494174	I love how it's got almost the same font as Final Fantasy.
2494334	2495915	And it's the last story.
2496315	2497376	The Final Fantasy.
2497536	2498136	I mean, come on.
2498356	2500337	I didn't even think about a title.
2500577	2501338	The last story.
2501378	2502759	Yeah, it sounds good.
2503299	2504600	It kind of reminds me of another game series.
2504620	2505660	I can't really think of what it is.
2506021	2508002	If the game is that good, I don't even care.
2508342	2509142	I don't even care.
2509222	2511784	They could have called it Dino Dynasty and I'd still play it.
2513135	2515396	For the record, they're called Dark Unicorns.
2516076	2518237	But this website refers to them as the Ninja Corn.
2518538	2519618	Dark and fierce.
2521079	2522579	The Ninja Corn.
2522599	2523880	I prefer calling them the Tranny Corn.
2526061	2526681	Alright, anyhow.
2528602	2530103	So yeah, I'm looking forward to that.
2530763	2532824	Interesting that Nintendo's not bringing it out themselves.
2532904	2536566	This is, you know, with Xenoblade, Nintendo's doing it themselves.
2537006	2538827	So this is where XSEED is doing it.
2538947	2539507	And they did what?
2539547	2540608	They did like Half Minute Hero.
2540628	2541148	They've been a few...
2541308	2543250	They've done some pretty good RPGs and stuff.
2543310	2555861	So I'm glad it's in their hands because what makes me really happy, and I was getting into this on Twitter with somebody, it makes me really happy that XSEED is doing it because this means no stupid retail exclusive agreements like we see happening with Xenoblade.
2556361	2557762	And I have faith it'll go pretty well.
2558063	2562066	It really does give me a reason to dust off my Nintendo Wii and check it out.
2562286	2565669	Especially since you're going to have Xenoblade and then two months later you're going to have...
2566950	2568091	The last story.
2569132	2570413	So I'm looking forward to that.
2572294	2576357	Sergeant Stubby in our chat room, I love that name, wants to know where is the OLR Tumblr?
2576577	2577418	Where is the OLR Tumblr?
2577498	2579599	It's orangelounge.tumblr.com.
2579620	2580040	There you go.
2580440	2583662	We also have a new one called fuckyacagematch.tumblr.com.
2583763	2593910	I don't remember if we said that on the podcast last week or if that was during the final Afterbirth segment, but we do have a new Tumblr called fuckyacagematch, which we will be uploading songs for those that were saying...
2594190	2595231	I don't even have a job and I have to sleep.
2595251	2595851	What's going on?
2620939	2621199	All right.
2622780	2623181	Moving on.
2623221	2627223	Let's talk about the Wii U a little bit because we mentioned it a little bit earlier in the show.
2628144	2632587	Some rumors about the Wii U. Apparently this week, Adweek ran a report.
2632687	2635189	Adweek is one of those magazines about what's going on.
2636269	2648037	Mentioning that Nintendo is talking to content providers about content for the Wii U. So think something like Comcast because that's one of the companies Nintendo's rumored to be dealing with right now.
2648497	2650739	Imagine if the whole Comcast on-demand thing,
2651199	2657484	or basically the exact same thing they're putting on the 360, wink wink, comes over to the Wii U. That's what Nintendo's looking at.
2657924	2668712	Now I gotta say, where Nintendo does have a leg up on the 360 right now is the fact that that tablet controller, that means I can start watching it and I can see the commercial in my head right now.
2669073	2670634	That Nintendo commercial in my head right now.
2670974	2677399	They're gonna be watching something on the TV and then mom comes in and says, change the channel, I have to watch Oprah.
2677499	2678359	Oprah's not on anymore.
2678440	2679200	I have to watch Dr. Oz.
2680541	2685629	and so the kid can take the tablet and continue watching their little show on demand into the bedroom.
2685889	2689515	As long as that's 30 feet away from the actual console.
2689575	2690176	Or whatever it is.
2690196	2692820	You know they're gonna stretch the truth a little bit, whatever it is, right?
2693241	2693481	So...
2695674	2701678	I remember my very first E3 was the year they showed the DS for the very first time.
2701758	2704240	And I still remember that commercial because that was a big moment.
2705001	2710164	And the commercial for the DS showed a mom and a kid on PictoChat.
2710905	2716448	And the mom was in the kitchen PictoChatting, it's time to come downstairs for breakfast.
2716828	2720311	And the kid was like, okay, they're having a conversation on PictoChat.
2720331	2723373	And I'm like, this is the most unrealistic thing I've ever seen in my life.
2723693	2724754	Because if that were my house,
2725994	2726474	Rob!
2726975	2727795	Dinner's ready!
2729676	2730716	And I'd hear it upstairs.
2732197	2732957	That's how it worked.
2733677	2735178	My mom would not open it.
2735778	2737558	Please come downstairs.
2739259	2748062	Or if you're a good parent, you'd have bacon cooking and then you don't need to tell people that there's... You don't even care what kind of, you know, what meal it is.
2748162	2750263	It's bacon cooking, I'm coming down.
2751887	2752028	Eh.
2753149	2756916	In my house, it wouldn't have been anything because my mom lived in another state.
2758433	2759754	I just fixed my food when I wanted it.
2759774	2760914	There you go.
2761235	2761815	I'm hungry.
2761875	2762916	Time to make my own dinner.
2764156	2765457	I had those nights too.
2765617	2766718	Too busy playing Zelda.
2767078	2769299	No, for me it was too busy playing Kirby's Avalanche.
2769740	2769980	All right.
2770740	2774522	Back to the... I don't know how he got to bacon, but leave it to the show.
2774863	2776824	From Nintendo and Comcast.
2777204	2778745	This doesn't surprise me at all.
2779085	2783748	Nintendo seems to be following a very similar path to what Xbox 360's been doing.
2784388	2812292	and you know this is where video game systems are headed so this is logical I think what's honestly surprising most people in this whole thing is that Nintendo is actually kind of planning ahead for a lot of this stuff and thinking about this that's the most surprising part is that wait Nintendo wants to be taken really seriously here well they would be the huge disadvantage if they have a broken old network like they have right now so yeah they kind of have to broken and old
2814803	2819187	They kind of break my old heart.
2819247	2820988	I was trying to find a way for it to work.
2821629	2824572	Well, Sony had some fail already with the Vita.
2826213	2830057	Their little Facebook app is gone from the store because it's broken.
2830737	2835281	If you tried to log into it, you got an error code of NP-13144-3 and it meant you had to close the app.
2839628	2844572	So they just took it down and said, we're working on it, but as for when it's going to be back up, no one said.
2844932	2846514	It's only some people I think were getting that error.
2846794	2847354	That's weird, yeah.
2847394	2848876	I was able to get into Facebook okay.
2848936	2851238	In fact, I'm going to load it right now and see if it works.
2852218	2858984	Yeah, they said that they're going to republish it once it's sorted, but the quote is, currently there is no time scale for this.
2859295	2867100	We found out that it wasn't stealing enough user data so that we had to tweak it so that it would steal the proper amount of user data that Facebook requires.
2867441	2871303	If downloading this Vita app upgraded me to Timeline, I'm going to be so fucking pissed.
2872144	2876006	Because you know how everything on Facebook now is like, we want you to upgrade to Timeline.
2876026	2877447	Turntable tried to do that to me.
2877467	2878848	You know what?
2878868	2880649	I updated Timeline back in September.
2880709	2881850	I actually like the Timeline.
2881870	2884412	Because then I can put neat pictures up at the top.
2884632	2885193	I can't...
2886133	2890154	I can't read a timeline because there's some shit on the left, some shit on the right.
2891154	2893935	From a design standpoint, I don't like it.
2895375	2896816	I'm trying to speak Jamie's language.
2897436	2902457	I have the cutest picture on mine of Dan and the baby.
2903557	2904318	Not my baby.
2905778	2906658	His cousin's baby.
2907938	2908979	You want to make that very clear.
2909719	2910479	It's a cute picture.
2910499	2913340	I'm going to change it back to Thrall though.
2914580	2917942	I just read about that the other day Now I can tweet that
2944446	2945166	If I want to.
2945707	2949408	I can't email the picture to myself, which would be far too obvious.
2949468	2951029	But anyway, I can tweet it.
2951069	2952030	Here's another fun fact.
2952070	2954971	Did you know that your Vita can receive text messages?
2956091	2956432	I didn't.
2956592	2958332	Well, you have a 3G one, right?
2958352	2959173	Yeah.
2959753	2961634	Yes, it can receive text messages.
2961694	2965336	You won't get any notifications, I think, but you can't send text messages.
2965636	2975442	The reason that is because your Vita has a phone number assigned to it because it has a SIM card and SIM cards have phone numbers assigned to them.
2975542	2980765	So you can actually text your Vita and you'll get a message saying, you know, this is from the operator.
2982796	2983477	Like the Matrix.
2983737	2984117	Operator.
2985198	2986139	I will say this, though.
2986319	2987980	I do really like the Twitter app.
2988680	2992483	It's a little bit slow to load some of the tweets compared to the iPhone one.
2992904	3001730	But I got to say, the way it's designed is great because I love... It's the first one I've really seen that has those little picture previews right there in the bar, like on the side.
3001750	3007214	So when people post links to pictures or YouTubes, you can see it without having to actually click on it like you do in the web browser and all that.
3007675	3007835	So...
3009760	3010621	I just tweeted it.
3010681	3013062	I put it on my personal account at S-K-I-E on Twitter.
3013242	3013502	Sky.
3014603	3015344	That's pretty cool.
3016524	3018085	That is one thing I do kind of like about the Vita.
3018105	3019626	You can kind of do those screenshots and do that.
3020327	3023929	Jamie trying to get her iPhone hovered just the right angle above my screen.
3025770	3026050	All right.
3026290	3027091	Anyhow, let's move on.
3027111	3027391	More news.
3027682	3036325	Something else that was kind of borked on the PlayStation Vita was that the PlayStation Plus minis that you get actually don't work on the Vita.
3036845	3039586	And apparently they're working on fixing that problem.
3039666	3046668	But right now you can't play those free games that you unlock with the PlayStation Plus membership.
3047268	3050529	So that's got to suck now, right, Rob?
3050589	3055331	Because you got a PlayStation Plus membership to check out some of those games.
3056571	3057953	Thanks for watching!
3075000	3079441	I'm not gonna... For what they are, they're supposed to be basics.
3079541	3080522	That's why they're minis.
3080962	3082822	So for what they are, they're not terrible.
3083223	3086284	But I'm not crying over the fact that I can't play them right now.
3086344	3087744	Because I know Sony's gonna fix it.
3088104	3091145	You know, this is part of what happens when you have the early adopter.
3091465	3093846	Does it make them look a little stupid for having it happen?
3094046	3094406	Yeah.
3094786	3096347	But am I gonna throw a fit over it?
3096487	3096807	No.
3097127	3100528	I have Luminous and Katamari and the PSP games to keep me busy.
3100568	3101788	I'll be fine.
3103109	3103249	So...
3105245	3108447	All right, going to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
3108707	3110668	There's some other timeline haters in our chatroom.
3110688	3112929	Shadow Charlie says, timeline is garbage.
3113309	3115070	It's going to be mandatory in a few weeks.
3115170	3116471	Yeah, I keep hearing about that.
3117171	3119592	I'm not the most enthusiastic Facebook user right now.
3121293	3122434	Other comments from our chatroom.
3122814	3130658	Brad from our friends at PodCulture say, Rob, I'm not a fan of the theme of the Twitter app, but the functionality is nice.
3131328	3135589	Yeah, it would be nice if you could change the colors up a little bit or put your own designs on it.
3135609	3136650	But maybe in a future version.
3136810	3137110	Who knows?
3137150	3137730	It's still early.
3138510	3140031	It's not like they can't release a new version later.
3140951	3148673	Bobby Blackwolf says, The only thing I dislike is that the Twitter app won't upload pics to TwitPic only to Twitter's official photo thing.
3148693	3149373	That's a good point.
3149693	3152454	You can't really choose your service on the Vita client.
3152574	3154675	It's all the official one.
3155175	3155315	So...
3156475	3159197	I haven't really messed much with that Flickr app either.
3159797	3161017	That looked a little weird.
3161117	3164039	I downloaded it and it was really weird.
3164259	3168420	I don't really use Flickr, but the way it was organized was kind of weird.
3168660	3181306	I think if I was actually a Flickr user who had a photo stream set up so I could view friends' pictures, it might be a little better, but most of my picture feeds come through Twitter or, I guess, Facebook.
3181906	3205551	so I don't I'm not really a Flickr person but I have some people that are really into photography to do it but I know like with Flickr man people will upload like 250 photographs at once it's like that would be a lot to have to scroll through you know like here's all my Disneyland pictures womp so Tiger Claw reminds us there's no Skype in the Vita not yet but there's also isn't there that built-in party chat thing they have now
3206089	3210951	They have where you can group message, and I think you can use the party chat thing.
3211431	3212451	I think that's voice chat.
3212651	3212992	I think so.
3213032	3215512	I think it's supposed to work with PlayStation 3, too.
3216293	3219954	There are some things where the Vita and the PlayStation 3 play each other.
3220534	3221615	I think Wipeout's one of them.
3222515	3224496	Wipeout is one of them, and...
3226527	3233869	You know what's kind of funny, though, is you know how they have that one cross-play section where you get all the games that support cross-play?
3235189	3236070	Wipeout's not on there.
3236810	3237790	Which is like, huh?
3238510	3244132	Check again, because I was just looking at the store earlier and Wipeout and... It's Hustle Kings and Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
3244172	3244332	Weird.
3245552	3251596	Yeah, and Marvel vs. Capcom 3, I thought the only thing you could do on that was cross-play.
3251856	3259861	Maybe you can fight other people, but I thought it was just playing the game using the Vita as the controller, but I don't know.
3260461	3263983	I'm sorry, you say cross-play, and I think of cross-dressing cosplay.
3265164	3266385	Or unicorns and altered beasts?
3266545	3268006	No, I mean, I actually think of...
3270396	3277939	All right, anyhow, well, this is something that'll get maybe some cross-play fans and a lot of other people very excited this week.
3277979	3280620	I know there's a lot of folks in our chat room that are excited about this news.
3281140	3285582	New Pokemon games, Black 2 and White 2 have been announced.
3286043	3289064	And a lot of people went, did they run out of colors?
3289284	3291485	Like, Black 2, what is this?
3292105	3292645	What is this?
3293105	3295886	So, yeah, we don't really know exactly what it is.
3295926	3296686	It's not gray.
3297106	3298886	That's what a lot of people were thinking it was going to be.
3299166	3303847	And the other huge thing about this, it's not the 3DS.
3304428	3305288	It's the DS.
3306048	3307508	These are not 3DS games.
3307548	3312609	These appear to be some type of upgrades or sequels to the existing Pokemon Black and White games.
3312929	3316330	They will be out on the DS regular, which granted the 3DS can play them.
3316890	3318671	In Japan in June.
3319111	3323453	Now, there are some North American details, very few, but they're called here.
3323493	3328135	It's going to be Pokemon Black Version 2 and Pokemon White Version 2.
3328815	3330976	We'll get details throughout the year.
3331616	3333297	So that means we probably won't have it in June.
3333437	3335918	I'd imagine this is something they're going to be targeting for the holidays.
3336378	3339020	Again, though, very interesting it's not 3DS.
3339620	3341040	And the fact that it's a direct sequel.
3341261	3341481	That's...
3342461	3343121	What does that mean?
3343161	3344902	Does that mean it's the same world?
3345583	3347383	How did they add new Pokemon into it?
3348524	3349184	How does this work?
3349504	3354507	But of course, I'm not as up and up on my... I used to love Pokemon 10 years ago, but I don't follow it anymore.
3354527	3360170	Wouldn't it be hilarious if it was a Game of the Year edition with any additional Pokemon that were offered?
3360750	3363251	No, it seems like it's going to be richer than that.
3363391	3368774	I saw some forums comparing it to when they upgraded Green to Emerald.
3369654	3372695	But that was also a system upgrade with that.
3373596	3375677	Black and white were on the DS, am I right?
3375797	3375977	Yeah.
3376117	3377457	So there's no system upgrade.
3377477	3381179	It would be funny if they weren't on the DS, if they were on the 3DS and then they downgraded them.
3381779	3385241	No, I mean, black and white, they could have been advanced for all I know, but they weren't.
3385301	3386781	No, they were DS titles.
3386841	3394065	I honestly, truly have not bought a Pokemon game since Sapphire, I think was the last one I had.
3394425	3394925	I had Pearl.
3395245	3397266	Yeah, so, ugh.
3399413	3402577	Ranma suggests instead of version 2, just call it V2.
3403578	3407422	Why couldn't they have just done Pokemon Ebony and Pokemon Ivory?
3407442	3409043	I mean, they could have just named it something.
3409063	3410164	Then they could have had that song.
3410565	3412166	Dan was expecting Pokemon Gray.
3412887	3413808	I think a lot of people were.
3414148	3419554	I even heard somebody saying Gray and Gray, like G-R-E and G-R-A.
3419954	3420175	Why?
3421616	3422337	Which would have been weird.
3423116	3425077	Why don't they just do one called Pokemans?
3425257	3425777	That's it.
3426157	3427878	Or how about Pokemon Rainbow?
3428398	3429779	Pokemon 3D.
3431640	3431920	Done.
3433720	3435801	Because we have Colosseum.
3435841	3438542	Would y'all be that tore up if they just ditched the color thing?
3439483	3440043	Maybe you would.
3440083	3440403	I don't know.
3442253	3442954	But you know what?
3443034	3446817	If there are more Pokemons to be had, there will be people buying these games.
3446857	3447718	Touch them, love them.
3447898	3448359	That's right.
3448679	3449340	Touch them, love them.
3450161	3453283	And you never know what type of internet things they might try to build into this or whatever.
3453324	3454545	Where's my Pokemon MMO?
3454805	3456326	Maybe that's what's happening on the 3DS.
3456667	3457107	You're right.
3458588	3460210	Someone tried to do that and they got sued.
3460270	3460971	Of course they did.
3462116	3463217	Nintendo, what's your money?
3464179	3474771	SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom at chat.orange.com says doesn't matter what platform it's on it will make millions Ragenator says no Pokemon Fuchsia?
3475132	3476113	Pokemon Checkerboard?
3476133	3479237	It said Pokemon Clear How about Pokemon Peaceful Meadow?
3480765	3481867	Pokemon Bloody Tampon.
3482067	3482428	Stop it.
3483049	3483469	Moving on.
3484050	3485272	None of them know what we're talking about.
3485512	3486294	It's for the best.
3486955	3487175	Good.
3489038	3492844	Well, how about that Double Fine Adventure thing?
3494186	3494827	They want it to be 2D.
3496449	3497511	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3515433	3521196	If you're going to do a 2D game, typically it has to be pixel based.
3522596	3530980	If you're going to do something that's going to flow like paint, it's going to have to still have a 3D element to it for that level of animation.
3531440	3553436	unless it's all vector based and then to do that is a little bit different too because vector graphics are going to need to have a screen capable of displaying mathematically calculated vectors where most games are going to need some type of raster thing to view it, right?
3554116	3557198	So I don't think that's going to be possible unless they do it some sort of shaded 3D.
3558820	3573739	but the thing on here and I'm going to read this quote one of the things I missed about 2D graphic adventures is that you would be able to have a great artist expressing themselves directly on screen not having to go through 3D shaders or any of the complicated technology might change or alter their vision
3575220	3583923	I just don't think it's going to be possible without... For what they're describing, it's not going to be possible to do it in a pixel-based format.
3584363	3584903	I don't think so.
3585883	3593445	But for all those people that pre-ordered it, which is what we've been calling Kickstarter on Bobby's show earlier this evening when he was talking to us at the end of the show there.
3593465	3596086	We were talking about how Kickstarter is basically the new pre-ordering.
3597667	3601008	They'll get to see the whole journal and if it works or not.
3601388	3601568	Yeah.
3601748	3602428	It'll be interesting.
3602448	3602548	Yeah.
3602828	3618535	I mean, now, I'm trying to think in terms of pixel graphics at high definition and possibly but it's gonna be a monster for memory it would just be a monster for memory so they would really have to be careful to make it work
3621109	3626011	Let's travel around the world and check out some games that will be coming out a whole lot sooner than this Double Fine game.
3626131	3627592	As in this week, Loki.
3628412	3629813	There's a few things coming out this week.
3629893	3632974	Poke Park 2 Wonders Beyond for the Nintendo Wii.
3633325	3634886	Well, there's something for the Pokemon people.
3634986	3635847	You can have it right now.
3636868	3638049	What the fuck is PokePark?
3638329	3640931	PokePark is basically... Do we get to poke them with the Wiimote?
3640971	3649979	No, it's like kind of a spin-off of the Pokemon series where you play as Pikachu and you go through some crappy adventure with Pokemon.
3650706	3651587	Sounds like a kid's game.
3651967	3652187	Yeah.
3652447	3652668	All right.
3653028	3653368	Pretty much.
3654729	3660233	And then also this week, we have Lord of the Rings Online, the Myth Roll Edition, which is a prior re-release there.
3660754	3664056	Binary Domain on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 from Sega.
3664377	3668960	Order Up on the PlayStation 3 with Move support from Ignition.
3669300	3671042	Order Up is kind of like Cooking Mama on the Wii.
3672283	3676926	Country Dance All-Stars for the Xbox 360 and Kinect.
3677046	3677707	Yeehaw.
3677847	3684074	Hyperdimension Neptunia MK2 the game where you play I guess
3685598	3688380	Game consoles turned into anime chicks.
3689761	3692423	That's from Tecmo Koei.
3693284	3703952	And this week, Mortal Kombat The Complete Edition with all the DLC included plus a voucher for the very first Mortal Kombat movie and the soundtrack.
3704172	3706654	That's on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3706834	3708295	Alan secretly wants me to get that.
3709385	3710447	I was like, why?
3710467	3711748	I already own Mortal Kombat.
3711788	3712729	This game looks pretty awesome.
3713050	3717135	One I'm kind of looking forward to this week, SSX on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3717935	3721219	And finally for the Nintendo DS, Shin Megami Tensei Devil Survivor 2.
3722850	3724812	Let's go to Japan and look at the releases over there.
3740878	3743220	One Piece, Kaizuko Musou.
3743621	3746022	I don't think that's somebody actually wearing a One Piece.
3746863	3748685	This is... Dynasty Warriors of One Piece.
3748745	3749205	One Piece is not a me.
3749926	3751147	Aha, so there it is.
3751347	3752668	Yeah, historical heroes.
3753048	3754029	It's like a clash.
3754129	3755090	It's a beat-em-up game.
3755230	3756371	They're stretchy pirates.
3756491	3756851	Yeah.
3758052	3762015	On top of that, there's a bad guy in there who has this spear.
3763016	3763616	What's it called?
3763636	3763656	A...
3765598	3766839	Sling Shot Sling Shot
3782833	3787660	If you're interested in that style of gameplay, you should really check out the CyberConnect2 stuff, like the Naruto games.
3788140	3790183	They are gorgeous.
3790243	3792286	It's like, holy crap, anime live.
3792667	3793287	You know what's funny?
3793387	3799496	I have an issue of Shonen Jump from 1992 with the original One Piece and Dragon Ball Z in it.
3802359	3802859	Old, huh?
3802899	3805082	Why do I do Japanese releases on this show?
3805102	3808186	Because I don't know any of this, but I guess that's a funny thing.
3808587	3810149	You're being ironic, Rob.
3810209	3819300	That game is big enough where they're releasing a PlayStation 3 themed console slash game included whole thing with that.
3819440	3820301	Oh yeah, One Piece is big.
3840724	3841384	DarkSakura.com
3864488	3865909	which not a lot of people had.
3866310	3866630	Oh yeah?
3866690	3868211	I have it too.
3868411	3869892	That translucent green instead of the black.
3869912	3873515	We've got like three different versions of the Xbox 360.
3874936	3875437	Oh yeah, yeah.
3876755	3877656	Doraemon Nobita, No Kisuke, No Shima
3901564	3903465	Well, it's even slower in the UK.
3904686	3912171	On March 2nd, we have Mario Party 9 for the Wii, Mortal Kombat Complete Edition for 360 and PS3 and SSX.
3914994	3915414	That's it.
3916335	3916675	All right.
3917596	3920137	I guess everybody's preoccupied with the Vita or something.
3920637	3921198	All right, Loki.
3921758	3922358	They must be.
3922738	3926361	I can't think of any other thing they could be occupied with.
3928302	3929402	Here's something interesting.
3929703	3931944	I think we've talked a little bit about how some of these...
3932475	3933296	Sony has patented a new...
3950330	3951051	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3971065	3998682	players would move in front of and interact with and also it says embodiments of present invention provided real time interactive gaming experiences for users for example users can interact with various computer generated objects in real time that definitely sounds like the Kinect what happened to the move where did that go
4002748	4008592	I really want them to come out with a controller-less thing and go, you know, with the whole, well, you need buttons.
4008733	4010174	Buttons are where it's at.
4010314	4011515	You know, button, button, button.
4011755	4016178	And then, you know, honestly, I think they should have both.
4016678	4017399	I think that...
4018900	4032104	Perhaps the PlayStation Eye camera is just not really good at capturing the rest of your body aside from moving the controller around, the PlayStation Eye or the Move stuff.
4032784	4033665	So maybe that's what it is.
4033725	4046849	It's like an upgrade to the PlayStation Eye camera that's going to be used in conjunction with the PlayStation Move stuff so that you have your buttons, you have your controller inputs and stuff like that, plus you have the rest of your body capturing stuff.
4047029	4047289	I don't know.
4049457	4049657	PS3, PS4, PS5
4076263	4077545	What's the next big thing with the PlayStation?
4077565	4080448	And the one I really want to know about is Microsoft.
4081709	4082951	What do they got going this year?
4083972	4091160	I'm going to assume Halo 4 is going to really dominate their press conference, but what else?
4093502	4096145	It's kind of the question I wanted answered last year.
4097126	4101509	Now show me how Kinect is really going to change my life.
4101709	4105031	Well, for like their press conferences go, you're going to probably see something.
4105831	4109773	I'm going to be willing to bet that they're going to show Call of Duty, whatever new Call of Duty is.
4109833	4115857	It's going to be a big portion of their thing because they're probably going to have exclusive DLC again or exclusive window on DLC.
4116457	4127225	I bet you they're going to show something about Grand Theft Auto 5, which they're probably going to have an exclusive DLC on that, much like they did with the 4 franchise.
4127605	4128226	And then...
4132282	4135224	Oh, there's a new Assassin's Creed game coming out.
4135545	4136706	Maybe they'll show something on that.
4137046	4142630	I think as far as first-party stuff goes, I mean, Gears of War, I don't know if there's going to be a new Gears of War game this year.
4142791	4161626	I mean, I don't... I'd be really curious at Sony's press conference to see if Final Fantasy XIV returns because we're looking at this very interesting thing that's never happened in gaming before that I can think of where the launch of the game on PC was so fast
4161806	4168290	I'm very curious to see if they get up there on that stage and say, Final Fantasy XIV is coming out on the PlayStation 3 in an ex-
4185840	4189445	in a new version developed for the PlayStation 3.
4190426	4191928	Whatever the fuck they embellish it with.
4194071	4196555	Because they were so excited when they had it as the exclusive.
4196995	4197977	Remember a couple years ago?
4198077	4199999	Not so excited anymore.
4200160	4201942	Oh shit, we still have to put this game out?
4203644	4205705	Versus 13 could be a thing, though.
4206366	4207847	Versus 13 is still, you know.
4208807	4209648	That could be awesome.
4210908	4212169	I just, I don't know.
4212249	4216352	Right now, they've been pretty good about keeping secrets so far.
4217212	4218353	We've still got a few more months.
4218393	4218933	That's right.
4219553	4219994	That's right.
4220034	4220954	Let the hype begin.
4221455	4224697	All right, well, speaking of letting the hype begin, this is certainly interesting.
4224757	4228539	Okay, so Nintendo had the press conference this week where we mentioned a lot of the news.
4228799	4230320	By the way, I've got to do a quick tangent.
4230953	4232194	I gotta say, this is pretty clever.
4232874	4239499	I woke up the other morning and my little swap note button is lit, meaning I have a new message on the 3DS swap note.
4240119	4244523	And I was like, oh yay, somebody sent me another 3D cat picture, because that's pretty much all I ever get on swap note.
4244563	4246084	Or fish, now I've been getting fish this week.
4247625	4251927	So I open it up, and it's a message from Reggie Fils-Aimé on my swap note.
4252007	4254608	And it even goes, hi, this is Reggie from Nintendo.
4254628	4256529	Because you can do like a little five-second audio clip.
4256869	4258230	And it's Reggie's little me.
4258590	4262132	And it says, join me tomorrow at 6 a.m.
4262952	4263252	LOL.
4263612	4266153	For a Nintendo Direct announcement.
4266233	4270876	And I even showed it to Alan, and we were both kind of like, you know, that is a pretty clever way to spam.
4271616	4276324	and it even unlocked that stationary for use with other swap note stuff.
4276805	4279670	So it was like, hey, Nintendo spammed me, but I got something out of it.
4279750	4282335	I got a new stationary for my next cat picture.
4283743	4291347	Anyhow, so as part of this whole Nintendo Direct Conference, they, of course, mentioned the last story, which, you know, Loki said they would do at some point, come out.
4291607	4295709	I think you said they'd do it last year, but they're going to come out and say, No, I thought they were going to do it in E3.
4296030	4297810	In E3, yeah, well, and then I said PAX.
4297850	4299111	Wait, are we still missing one?
4299591	4300252	There's still one game.
4300272	4302693	There's still Pandora's Tower, but it's coming out in Europe.
4302733	4303433	We talked last week.
4303834	4304554	Europe's got a date.
4306795	4307516	No, it's...
4309258	4317514	this is happening because the Wii is not even going to get a mention in this year's E3 it's all about the Wii U they have to get people excited for the Wii U they have to
4319562	4321644	Anyhow, 3DS.
4321684	4323245	They'll still say some stuff on the 3DS.
4323825	4327048	And this might be something you see more about at E3 this year.
4328049	4330831	All we got was a hint this week at the Nintendo Direct Conference.
4331471	4338637	Capcom, Bandai Namco, and Sega are all working on something.
4339978	4340438	That's it.
4341078	4343020	And apparently there's a little teaser site...
4344437	4345998	I don't know, this is the first time I'm seeing this.
4346018	4346978	This is a Japanese site.
4346998	4351261	I apologize in advance if this autoplays music, but I didn't even realize it had its own teaser site.
4351281	4352822	Because what in the fuck are they going to show?
4354983	4355903	What is this supposed to be?
4358004	4361006	Oh, is this like one of those freaking... It's an elevator.
4361286	4363047	No, it's a... What do they call those games?
4366109	4368710	Oh... ARG.
4368810	4369331	ARG.
4369351	4370151	Oh no.
4371332	4373493	So they punched in a little code and...
4375791	4379395	Now we see Steam and we see the three logos.
4379836	4381097	And Bon Presto up in the corner.
4381177	4381758	Who knows?
4382999	4383700	That could be anything.
4385202	4388446	Maybe they all are also working on the next Super Smash Bros.
4390359	4394760	and you're going to have Mega Man and Pac-Man and Sonic.
4395060	4396181	It'll be bad art.
4396861	4399562	Bad box art.
4399662	4400242	You don't get it.
4400422	4404303	A lot of people's minds are going straight to a fighting game, which makes sense.
4404363	4405364	That's what we've seen a lot of crossover.
4405384	4407584	Street Fighter X, Tekken X, Dead or Alive.
4408525	4409545	Was Dead or Alive a Sega game?
4411033	4411513	No, maybe not.
4411753	4413935	No, that was Team Ninja.
4413995	4414895	Virtua Fighter.
4414955	4415675	Virtua Fighter?
4416236	4417476	I don't think so.
4417856	4418577	I don't think so.
4418617	4419617	Virtua Pack Fighter.
4419677	4420198	You know what?
4421738	4433324	Okay, I just want to remind everybody, when Namco and Sega and Nintendo worked together before, that was the F-Zero arcade game.
4435865	4436746	Just throwing it out there.
4438311	4440853	Maybe they're going to let Capcom have their share.
4441033	4441653	I don't know.
4442013	4442954	A fanboy can dream.
4444315	4446536	Capcom doesn't have any.
4446956	4447396	So, okay.
4447596	4449558	So if you want that, so it's going to be... Exactly.
4449598	4451699	Capcom doesn't have a racer franchise.
4451719	4452359	No, no, no, no, no, no.
4452399	4452859	You're wrong.
4452899	4454140	They do have a racer franchise.
4454160	4454680	What do they have?
4454961	4456542	It would be... Here's what it would be.
4456602	4465066	It would be Daytona cross Ridge Racer cross MotoGP because that's the Capcom franchise.
4465647	4466627	Just get out.
4466848	4467348	Get out.
4469128	4469950	In space!
4472775	4473756	You get nothing!
4474157	4475019	You lose!
4475519	4476701	Good day, sir!
4479960	4481701	They really need to do a new Excite Truck.
4482542	4483783	No, let it go.
4483823	4487926	That would sell me a Wii U, a new Excite Truck.
4489348	4489968	I'm telling you.
4490989	4493831	If they announce a new Excite Truck for the 3DS, I will be pissed.
4495533	4496974	I will be, what the fuck?
4497554	4497954	They're not.
4498495	4499456	I understand that.
4499496	4499876	You're fine.
4500617	4501037	They're not.
4501918	4502618	Let Excite Truck go.
4502638	4504660	They already poo-pooed on that franchise.
4504740	4505721	Excite Bots, Loki.
4505821	4506521	That's what you got.
4506722	4507702	You got Excite Bots.
4508083	4508303	Rob.
4508603	4508803	What?
4508883	4509604	Virtua Calibur.
4511214	4515618	I really want to slap whoever at Nintendo is like, hey, you know what racing games need?
4515799	4517940	Mini games in the middle of the fucking race.
4518021	4519422	That's fantastic.
4520142	4521324	Yeah, mini games.
4523065	4525567	Let's go back to a time when games were simpler.
4527409	4528050	Not this one.
4528250	4530912	In a segment we call the classic game of the week.
4531212	4533214	Back when game companies, they didn't work together.
4533575	4535096	They all hated each other's guts.
4538778	4544602	In fact, there was a big rivalry between Sierra Online and Lucasfilm Games.
4545923	4547884	Actually, I don't know if there really was that big of a rivalry.
4547924	4548605	I just made that up.
4549526	4551107	What's the classic game of the week, DarkSakura?
4551367	4551847	Loom.
4553388	4554709	Which is one of my favorite games.
4555050	4556030	Excellent pick, by the way.
4556571	4560954	I'm surprised I hadn't done it before, but I love the music in this game.
4563632	4568214	At any rate, Loom was put out by Lucasfilm Games, which is now LucasArts.
4569255	4574338	And it was the fourth game that used the SCUMM engine.
4574838	4576559	I still like saying the SCUMM engine.
4577360	4582663	And was led by Brian Moriarty, who was the guy who gave us Wishbringer, Trinity, and Beyond Zork.
4583764	4584364	Just saying.
4586245	4587166	Actually, it's on Steam now.
4587246	4589287	You can play Loom on Steam, and it's like five bucks.
4589447	4589707	Really?
4589767	4590288	I didn't know that.
4590408	4591208	Yeah, I have it on Steam.
4591388	4591669	Nice.
4592809	4603537	So it's an adventure game, and it's really different because it's a big fantasy story set in the future, and its interface is actually very different for its time.
4604377	4619028	So basically with the game is that you play a little guy named Bobbin Threadbear, who has a distaff, and you can play a spell that is musical, like one of them is called Opening, or you have Night Vision, or Sharpening.
4619088	4619668	It's a different...
4621429	4622870	Thank you for watching!
4639717	4641718	Terror, I guess, is calming.
4642118	4643218	Anyway.
4643618	4651241	But at first when you only play the game, you only have the notes C, D, and E. And as you get through it, you actually get a full scale on the C scale.
4651441	4652381	It's like an ocarina.
4653242	4653902	Except it's a staff.
4657313	4685282	so basically it actually just followed the LucasArts game design philosophy where a character will never be killed or forced to restart the game and won't have to spend hours typing in synonyms until they get it so basically it has different difficulty levels you have like an easy to an expert level and the expert level actually doesn't have any of the notes marked on the staff you have to play it by ear
4687483	4700132	but you do have a different graphic sequences that play after that and that's only on the original version but the DOS CD-ROM version has a different graphics to it too
4702328	4704769	So anyway, the drafts are the same way spells work.
4705210	4707771	Like I said, you've got different ones that do different things.
4708691	4715215	And you also have this thing on the island that Bobbin lives on called the Great Loom.
4715595	4716615	And it's on Loom Island.
4717136	4721978	And it can echo the last draft that was spun in its presence.
4723319	4727281	So the only ones that can't are the ones that Bobbin did by himself.
4729159	4731862	So you can't really forget a draft that you do.
4732863	4736608	You'll learn everything in the presence of the loom.
4736628	4740052	So basically, it's got a really in-depth story, too.
4740652	4744917	This audio play came with it that was...
4746937	4757502	It was like a cassette that had all of this prequel story leading up to it about how it's in... Let me see if I can find the world.
4758283	4758943	It's in the future.
4759503	4760824	It's in 8021.
4761904	4771389	And basically people have dissolved into different types of guilds and the weavers have decided to form this great loom that controls all of reality.
4772049	4787798	Except they stopped being able to have kids, so this one woman named Signa Threadbear sneaks past them and actually weaves a gray thread into the great loom, and out of it comes an infant.
4788758	4790199	And they turn her into a swan.
4791820	4795382	And this one other woman decides to raise Bobbin.
4795602	4797223	This is starting to sound like a Bjork video.
4798652	4799153	It's awesome.
4800794	4806199	But anyway, the elders are actually named after the three fates of Greek mythology.
4809642	4816769	They... As things happen, the woman who raises Bobbin... And I'm trying to find her name.
4816789	4818651	I think it was like Hatch something.
4818951	4819652	It's been a while.
4819672	4821093	I'm trying to see if I can find it in the article.
4822254	4822434	But...
4825485	4830227	This woman who ends up raising him, oh, Dame Hetchel, that was her name, who was a serving woman.
4831207	4839150	She ends up teaching Bobbin how to weave drafts, which he wasn't supposed to learn until he turned 17.
4839750	4842091	And so she gets turned into a swan too.
4843671	4856344	or no she gets turned into a different kind of bird but as it goes on basically everyone on the island gets turned into a swan and they fly off and the only one left is Bobbin so he's trying to figure out what's going on um
4859041	4864023	So yeah, the swan appears and casts a spell on all of the villagers.
4864043	4866484	So all the weavens except Bobbin are turned into swans.
4866524	4869205	And it turns out that this one, I think, is his mother.
4870766	4878429	So this cleric actually takes the weaver's distaff to take over the world with an army of undead.
4879669	4884191	And basically Bobbin gets it and has to go on to fight chaos.
4885734	4886955	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4905951	4925046	as uh who was one of uh Bobbin's friends and then um another game called The Fold that was uh Fleece Firmflanks I think that's a funny name Firmflanks um who was gonna work like a character in a John's John Waters movie well he was he's one of the shepherds but he was gonna work with Rusty
4926327	4947420	and it actually Loom sold a lot of copies but the only reason that the sequels never came out was because basically he wanted to work on other things nobody else wanted to do them so it just sort of fell apart they were ideas as far as getting the game it originally came out on for DOS on an EGA floppy disk
4948561	4957799	and then it came out to the Amiga, the Atari ST, the Mac and TurboGrafx-16 which actually was a much better version than the other versions.
4957999	4959762	I did not know the TurboGrafx-16 had one.
4960598	4965683	Fair Game in Town was selling a copy for $60 and I wanted it so freaking bad.
4965783	4966103	Wow.
4966524	4968185	And Dan's like, you already have that game.
4968205	4972169	Because I have the PC CD and I have it on Steam.
4973250	4982758	But anyway, like I said, Loon came out later on CD-ROM for the FM Town's computer and it was a VGA enhanced and had a digital soundtrack.
4983599	4986441	So everything was so much better on it.
4986501	4987182	It was beautiful.
4987522	4995247	And then a third version came out on CD-ROM for DOS in 1992 that were really, really souped up.
4995587	4997588	And it had the talking in it.
4997648	4998909	Like, we've got some samples of the voice.
5000290	5000730	Yes, we do.
5000750	5001771	It had voice acting in it.
5002371	5003932	Is this just right at the beginning here?
5004353	5004573	Yeah.
5006794	5007875	So Bobbin's walking along.
5009195	5009455	Ouch.
5010556	5011397	He gets hit by a rabbit.
5012458	5013418	Bird steals a rabbit.
5016961	5026949	Destiny shall draw the lightning down from heaven, roll its thunder far across the sea, to where I wait upon the shore of wonder.
5027830	5032094	On the day the sky is opened and the tree is split asunder.
5032894	5035316	So you get this when you read different things.
5036277	5040861	And you've got voice acting in it.
5042422	5045165	But this actually was the first talking scum game that came out.
5046206	5050269	And it had a lot of the dialogue was rewritten.
5051610	5054613	And that's just because they had to edit space.
5054793	5055614	They needed the space.
5055634	5056795	So...
5060828	5069782	They had different solutions to some of the puzzles and different close-ups on the dialogues and different graphics that were included with it.
5069842	5072166	And this was considered to be the definitive version of Loom.
5075802	5103359	also there was a rumor that said that Orson Scott Card helped make the original version not true, in fact he even said not true but he did help revise the game's dialogue so he did contribute to the later version of the game, the 1992 version and you can't get the DOS CD-ROM version anymore because of an agreement with Mindscape for licensing, Mindscape is no longer in business by the way
5104780	5111384	So, the only way that you can play the original versions of it really is by having the SCUMVM virtual machine.
5112384	5115486	Although, you can't play the FM Towns version.
5116266	5117347	What about that whole Steam thing?
5118327	5118867	Let me get to that.
5118947	5120628	This is like the original discs.
5120868	5121589	My bad, okay.
5121889	5122229	Versions.
5123750	5130773	Now, the voiced CD-ROM version is available on Steam for PC and Mac.
5130793	5131314	Okay.
5132234	5142282	And, um, there is a, uh, the, uh, community, actually the Steam community has made a method to play the FM Town version with the Steam version of Loom.
5143983	5144944	So, it's there.
5145344	5149847	So, like, as you can hear, some of the music has a search from Swan Lake because of the big swan theme in it.
5150408	5152309	And the MIDI version was arranged by The Fat Man.
5152729	5153370	That's what he was called.
5155529	5159431	Others are full CD versions, they're sequenced versions.
5160312	5168896	At the time, it really supported all kinds of the different audio processors that were out at the time.
5169497	5178882	And like I said, with the package, it had an audio tape that had a 30-minute drama that had the nature and the history of the Loom world and about Bobbin being born.
5178982	5183084	And so the game is a continuation of the story that came on the cassette.
5183884	5199555	and it had original music that was composed by Jerry Gerber and the actors who were in that reprised their roles for the talkie version most of them did so it really keeps up with that continuity and it was the first commercial cassette that used the Dolby S noise reduction
5201423	5211089	and it also said that the side A was encoded for Dolby B playback and the side B was the Dolby S playback.
5212149	5220434	It had an illustrated notebook, the Book of Patterns, which basically all the Apprentice Weavers in the game were given that type of thing.
5220914	5227198	It had different descriptions in there, had spaces that you could write down what you learned in the game and
5230370	5253486	because the drafts are random from game to game it said write it in pencil and it also worked as copy protection since the original disc would ask for the order of the notes for your disc for the first spell that you learn and that's how you can prove that your game isn't a copy
5255279	5257361	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5280079	5282441	and it was actually appeared in other games.
5283142	5294110	In The Secret of Monkey Island, there was a guy named Cobb who was in the scum bar and said, wearing a shirt that said, ask me about Loom.
5295391	5295611	Nice.
5297248	5324644	and actually in the VGA remake of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade a painting in the vault of the Brunwald Castle reveals a beach that appears as scenery from Loom and in the NES version of Maniac Mansion there's a broken record called The Soundtrack of Loom also in Space Quest 4 there is game parodies there's one called Boom exactly Alan literally just shouted from the other room yes
5324924	5325124	Yeah.
5325764	5326664	So that's the game Loom.
5327565	5328645	You can get it on Steam.
5328825	5333686	I literally paid... Actually, when I got it, I paid $3 for it because it was on sale.
5334506	5335286	Totally worth it.
5335326	5337187	It's an amazing little point and click.
5337707	5338027	All right.
5338287	5339347	There it is, your classic game of the week.
5339387	5347029	You had a lot to say about that one, but it's a... It's a really in-depth kind of game, and I would just be stuck hours playing this game with my friend Marcy.
5347689	5348089	Good times.
5348129	5348309	Yeah.
5348956	5352137	Alright, well that's going to do it for part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere.
5352177	5355138	We've got plenty more to come when we come back with Orange Lounge Radio.
5355238	5357019	Another MMO going free to play.
5357739	5360660	A classic, a classic, classic game from back in the day.
5361160	5363661	I can't believe I'm calling a Dreamcast game back in the day, but I just did.
5364561	5369523	Apparently set to come back, so we're going to talk all about that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5375785	5378687	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5396736	5401257	and saw my 3DS had the blue light on and I was like, oh, Ranma or somebody probably sent me a cat picture.
5401657	5404158	So I assumed it was Swapnote going off, but it wasn't.
5404358	5406598	I had suddenly new data.
5406638	5408239	So you 3DS owners might want to check.
5408419	5419541	I just suddenly had new data in the Mii Plaza and it told me that the puzzle trading mode, you know, or the picture swap thing, is now available via SpotPass.
5419941	5420942	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5436082	5452965	but I thought that was interesting that that just updated right now so those of you the guys with 3DSs that are into that kind of collecting stuff might want to check that out right now because I just got it and I imagine the rest of you probably have it on their way just like the whole Reggie note on swap note earlier so
5453906	5455067	Project Zero 2 or Fatal Frame 2
5480206	5484210	It is coming to European regions very soon.
5484790	5490956	And it's funny because it's like one of those, hey, look, we're translating the English, but you can't have it yet.
5491116	5491857	You can't have it yet.
5491917	5492317	You can't have it.
5492357	5492757	Okay, fine.
5492777	5493258	You can have it.
5493438	5494239	No, no, no, you can't.
5495820	5496821	That's pretty much what they're doing.
5497021	5499583	So, yes, it's coming to Europe.
5499603	5500644	When?
5501005	5501225	When?
5503314	5503634	No idea.
5504195	5509598	But the game was actually a remake, I guess, of Project Zero.
5510419	5511099	Well, fair enough.
5511139	5515943	I mean, how often does Europe get screwed on having to wait so many months because we got something, you know?
5516643	5518124	Yeah.
5518404	5523348	And, of course, they don't specify whether North America will see the release as well, but maybe.
5524829	5525849	If you beg enough.
5527691	5528732	This is kind of interesting.
5529532	5537658	Not really a property that I thought would be getting a game, but apparently it was announced that the Boondock Saints are getting a video game.
5538559	5541341	And, I mean, absolutely awesome movie.
5542161	5547245	Kind of curious to see how that would come about, but it is going to be apparently...
5548545	5549926	They did games on the Godfather.
5575154	5576175	Those are pretty good.
5576255	5577336	Yeah, so it happens.
5577656	5579859	And also Scarface was not bad.
5579919	5580879	How about a Kill Bill game?
5583402	5584182	I would see that.
5584283	5585384	I mean, that would be kind of cool.
5585404	5586945	That would be fun.
5587365	5589948	Just, you know, I don't know what exactly it would be.
5592430	5593091	But that's pretty cool.
5593531	5599256	So no word exactly what it is, but apparently it's going to be...
5601879	5603500	I guess part of a panel.
5603520	5609305	They're going to have Critical Mass Interactive.
5610666	5612407	They're having a panel about it.
5613108	5617251	Critical Mass Interactive, they've done outsourced art and design stuff.
5617732	5618872	They've worked on some of the...
5621334	5622475	Man, some pretty old games.
5622555	5629219	Actually, The Outfit, one of the early titles for the Xbox 360, and The Incredible Hulk.
5629299	5635542	Not sure which Incredible Hulk game that was, but at least this console's generation.
5635562	5636442	I don't know.
5637063	5638764	But interesting.
5642281	5658680	and last but not least I'm very excited about this game one of my must haves of this year Borderlands 2 has been announced that it will be coming to North America September 18th internationally September 21st lots of people excited about that
5658860	5660961	That game is... Borderlands is awesome.
5661481	5662761	Have you got a chance to play Borderlands?
5662781	5663981	I played it a little bit.
5664041	5664882	Just a little bit.
5665162	5670163	So not enough to get a full taste of it, but enough to kind of see what people are excited about.
5670263	5672083	Remember, me and shooters don't always get along.
5672443	5675984	But I love the... It's a little more Fallout to me.
5676344	5678305	Yeah, it's a lot of loot dropping.
5679345	5680826	And they're going to have a lot more loot in this.
5681366	5686227	And I love how they're kind of self-aware of their own jokes and stuff like...
5687725	5717212	and of course the trailer had dubstep in it and they promised that they're all 98.6% more wub wub according to the trailer which is great great trailer definitely need to watch it if you haven't also apparently there is an incentive I guess if you pre-order as part of like this premiere club and you'll get a gearbox gun pack a golden key item to unlock some sort of loot chest later on in the game and vault hunters relic and stuff like that
5719226	5726873	To be honest, the last Borderlands game, that was some really well done DLC right there.
5727654	5729315	Those expansions were all great.
5729576	5730356	Every single one of them.
5731617	5732338	Looking forward to it.
5733326	5755924	All right well let's talk about Metroid uh yet again another Metroid release don't get too excited it's just the NES classic all over again but I mean the NES game is a true classic but you probably already bought this when it's on when it was on the Wii or heck you have the original cart or maybe you unlocked it with the whole Game Boy Advance cable thing but if you missed somehow although
5757114	5781421	or if you didn't buy your 3DS early enough that's right oh yeah that's right because the early adopters got this for free well now you'll be able to buy Metroid now keep in mind we're getting this news from Japan but come on inevitably it'll come out here too Japan is getting the Metroid NES release on the 3DS virtual console on February 29th hopefully it's going to be coming here soon after that for those that you know didn't have the early adopter program
5783081	5785422	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5798226	5828028	but I wouldn't get your hopes up because the one that the early adopters have now is not that one and I'm pretty sure all this is is going to be just like the Mario one that came out a couple weeks ago where now you have the more proper save states built in and it's just kind of the quote unquote full release it would have multiplayer except Metroid doesn't use that at all so there you go and price it was I think 600 yen yeah six bucks so a dollar more than it costs on the Wii
5828419	5839471	So, and, and if you want to put a price tag on your, you know, what you're getting, you know, if you assume like each one's going to be about five bucks and that's a hundred dollars worth of content.
5840051	5843535	Well, I mean, I was assuming that the Game Boy Advance games would be more expensive, but.
5844727	5845348	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5861749	5863310	for all the wrong reasons.
5863870	5866271	This company called... I don't know what they were.
5866292	5868993	There was something like Anime Original something.
5869013	5869333	I don't know.
5869353	5870794	It was clearly a rip-off company.
5871594	5873996	Released what's called Pokemon Yellow, right?
5874036	5876237	The old Game Boy Color?
5876257	5877938	Or was it Game Boy Regular?
5878138	5885182	I think it was... Red and blue were regular and then yellow had to be the color one because they added Pikachu because he's popular in the cartoon, right?
5886129	5888052	I think it actually, no, it was a black and white one.
5888413	5888654	Was it?
5888774	5894383	But it had, I think, special coloration available for the Super Game Boy.
5894544	5895105	That makes sense.
5895578	5900680	All right, well, anyhow, Pokemon Yellow came out on the iOS App Store, only it wasn't Pokemon.
5900720	5902121	In fact, it was a dud app.
5902521	5914527	They were charging 99 cents for this app, and it shot to the top of the charts, apparently on name alone, or some type of insider scheme where they had a bunch of people buy it real fast, so it shot to the top of the charts.
5914667	5917728	I don't know, but it was garbage.
5919609	5920850	It wouldn't even boot.
5920870	5922831	You would launch the app, and it would just die.
5923431	5936747	and somebody went in there and somehow hacked it, decompiled it and saw that all it was was one of those bullshit apps that's just pictures of Pokemon and maps and Pokemon fan fiction and all this stuff.
5936787	5937067	I don't know.
5937087	5939871	It's just a bunch of garbage that they throw into an app and then charge for it.
5940471	5959203	but because of the fact it was called Pokemon Yellow and they said in the description you know five star just like the original and they made up all these fucking press quotes that weren't attributed anything I mean this whole thing was just a giant ripoff well Apple ended up yanking it from the store but it took them like all weekend to do it and now the question is is Apple gonna refund the money
5959983	5975497	probably not there is apparently no wait you can't I think you can request the money back yeah if you there's a way that you can uh request it there's some sort of complaint form and you say basically that the app didn't work because it literally didn't work and then they may give you back the money
5977465	5979506	1,352 reviews.
5979586	5983388	Let that be a buck lesson that you should do your research on anything you download.
5983488	5984128	Oh, I didn't buy it.
5984768	5987169	Well, I meant to anybody that bought it, because it was $1.
5987889	5988310	Right.
5989570	5994812	No, if it was a legit release, also look at the company that made it, because a legit release would have come from Nintendo.
5995192	5998854	And if they had let it out to a third party or something, it would have said the Pokemon company.
5998894	6000054	But here's the thing, though.
6000254	6001295	It would have said Licensed Buy.
6001915	6003776	I understand why they would do that, though.
6004236	6024547	Well, why people might buy it is because sometimes companies, unscrupulous companies, will take a game and, like, say, port it to the iOS or whatever, you know, through an emulator or something like that, and then it gets yanked and say, ha, it actually was the working version of Pokemon Yellow, but, you know, not licensed or approved or whatever.
6025993	6026853	Steve Kordek Play More Pinball
6048522	6049523	How influential?
6049623	6055987	Well, he's the guy who pretty much thought to do a two-flipper table and kind of designed the modern pinball table.
6056007	6057688	He gave us drop targets.
6057768	6058449	Triple action.
6058769	6064813	Yeah, he also, I guess, later on, he didn't just kind of do triple action that kind of did the standard pinball layout, if you will.
6065173	6069736	He designed more than 100 tables when he was with Genco and then Williams and Bally.
6070056	6075340	He did drop targets in Vagabond and Multiball beat the clock in 1963.
6076181	6077601	So Steve Kordek gave us all those things.
6077621	6078222	I played that table.
6078782	6080483	but sadly passed away this week.
6081723	6083624	It has all the funeral details here.
6084144	6086785	There's a tribute book available online.
6087325	6090726	The link is a little lengthy there but I will go ahead and post that link in chat.
6091926	6097008	I'll leave you with this quote that he mentioned to the Chicago Tribune in 2009 when he had an interview.
6098108	6101469	I've had more fun in this business than anyone could believe.
6103930	6104410	Rest in peace.
6106192	6109213	Well, how about some news that's not quite so sad?
6110293	6110773	Yes, please.
6110793	6111274	Topic change.
6111594	6111774	Yeah.
6112334	6116455	There's going to be a few 80s stuff coming out.
6116595	6120997	In fact, specifically, it's a Huey Lewis and the News Pack for a rock band.
6122277	6125598	There will be Do You Believe in Love, The Heart of Rock and Roll, and I Want a New Drug.
6126298	6130700	And the latter being one with a pro guitar and bass expansion.
6130860	6133361	So it's the usual pricing.
6133381	6134561	440 Microsoft points for the pack.
6136914	6137654	I want a new drug.
6138274	6144456	Which, you know, he sued for Ghostbusters for sounding like his little riff in that.
6144776	6145077	Really?
6145237	6146937	Yeah.
6148178	6151819	Also, there is a Best of Just Dance coming out by Ubisoft.
6153519	6156400	I guess people like Just Dance, so there should be a Best of.
6156940	6161182	But it's going to be on the Wii in Europe, Middle East, and Asia regions.
6161842	6164763	Hopefully you'll get some songs from You Can Dance ABBA in there.
6164843	6165283	Just saying.
6165848	6174711	Well, the ones listed on here so far are Heya and Firework by Katy Perry, The Only Girl in the World, and Airplanes.
6175831	6177612	You know, I can't really hate on those games.
6177772	6178972	They're stupid fun.
6179432	6182033	If that's what you want to play, go ahead.
6182153	6186575	And of course, of course, the Kung Fu Fighting.
6187475	6188555	You can't touch this.
6189475	6190136	Not the original.
6190276	6191756	It's by the group Sentry.
6192796	6194417	And I like to move it.
6195856	6196496	Move it, move it.
6196577	6196997	You know what?
6197377	6200619	It's interesting when these kind of best collections happen.
6200659	6205302	It's almost like what you see happen in the music world when like, I don't know, who put out a greatest hits CD?
6205322	6207924	Goldfrapp just last month put out like a greatest hits CD.
6208264	6211166	So this is kind of like a greatest hits CD of sorts.
6212026	6215168	But it's not like we haven't seen music games do this before.
6215249	6218050	Hello, Guitar Hero had a compilation at one point.
6218591	6220432	DDR, best hits, anybody?
6220872	6223254	So Konami did it too back in the day.
6224274	6227277	Back in the day, they still do it.
6227297	6229399	I was going to say, Best Hits was what?
6229419	6231401	19, no, probably like 2000 or 2001.
6231861	6232962	It was a PS1 game.
6233122	6239748	Well, the last bit on here is it has to do with Star Wars The Old Republic, which I know there are addicts out there that listen to this.
6240469	6248676	People are averaging four to six hours per gaming session, which according to Greg Zeschuk, who is the...
6252003	6275909	the head of Bioware Austin says that it's absurd that their sessions are absurd absurd and that uh it's that one more quest one more thing and that uh people are just getting sucked in and he says that Sunday is the busiest day playing um but the average during the average uh work week um you get people playing mid-afternoon because the east coast and uh
6278254	6282677	Basically, when Europe goes down, North America goes up, so they're getting consistent playtimes, too.
6283638	6285239	And there are 2 million active subscribers.
6285979	6287560	So, kind of like WoW.
6288181	6288341	Yeah.
6288361	6290422	But with about a fifth of the people for now.
6290462	6291583	And with more no one care.
6291883	6296126	I mean... I'm not going to throw shade at Star Wars.
6296446	6302250	It was a fine month I played the game, but I'll check it out later on once things have leveled out a little more.
6302791	6304812	Quality life improvements were needed in that game.
6307065	6307865	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6333237	6337041	I played it when it was in beta.
6343226	6347668	Well, you may be able to get a chance to play it now because Aeon is going free-to-play.
6349588	6354370	And apparently, this is coinciding with a 3.0 patch.
6354930	6362713	One can only hope that a certain other Final Fantasy online game, when it gets its eventual 3.0 patch, will go free-to-play as well.
6362873	6365134	How in the fuck is XI not free-to-play at this point?
6366394	6367575	Somebody asked that question on Twitter.
6367755	6370036	With all these games going free-to-play, how is Final Fantasy XI...
6371216	6374777	I'm not even going to touch XIV But how is Final Fantasy XI still charging?
6374797	6397886	But I guess XI does still have its very loyal fanbase They're very attached to that game And it's a fine game It's an MMO It's different, it's not WoW It's very much not WoW I played Ion in the beta, it was a little WoW If XI goes free to play And they pour it to the Vita I may never be seen again That's right, they were talking about XI on the Vita At one point, weren't they?
6398747	6403210	Imagine if they know that it's going to go free to play soon enough.
6403671	6410055	Although, if you put XI free to play before Final Fantasy XIV is done, you might as well just shoot it because it's dead.
6411737	6413298	No one cares.
6414098	6416840	The reinvention is going to be interesting.
6416860	6417561	That's all I have to say.
6418061	6418741	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6439347	6441088	of 40 and no time limit.
6441208	6447771	And of course, you know, people who I guess are paying for it, they'll get free activation for 14 days.
6448471	6451753	And it doesn't say what it's going to cost.
6451913	6456815	I'm assuming there's going to be some sort of cost thing or some sort of limits for the free to play stuff.
6458736	6459496	Nope, doesn't say.
6459816	6460937	So no idea.
6461437	6462438	I was looking at the specs.
6462498	6465119	It's like you only get two character slots instead of eight.
6465639	6466560	Oh, darn.
6466740	6467020	I know.
6467600	6475750	Yeah, that's so terrible I'm sure they'll try to nickel and dime you That's what a lot of the free MMOs do I have my Star Trek online, so I'm happy
6476671	6477951	How is that free?
6478031	6479572	I've played it twice.
6480852	6482292	Does it try to nickel and dime you a lot?
6482612	6487993	Well, I mean, what it did as far as the nickel and dime thing, you have to have cryptic points.
6488453	6492774	So you actually do have to go in and actively buy a series of points so that you have that.
6493314	6503776	And now, instead of saying you can unlock this pack and your content is available, it actually puts all of the content on there and lets you know what you have unlocked or not or what you can pay to unlock.
6504978	6507502	So like for costume packs and extra ships and things.
6508283	6513833	And it does that like say that you go into the clothing store to change your outfit.
6514714	6515596	It gives you that option.
6516747	6517047	DarkSakura,
6535718	6536859	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6554518	6556739	Actually, I think later tonight or next week.
6556879	6557399	Better get home.
6558580	6560080	Well, keep in mind, they're in Scotland.
6561101	6562561	I'm seven hours behind them.
6562882	6563102	Right.
6563722	6571345	So I'm supposed to be meeting up with them either this weekend or next, probably next weekend, to have them get me leveled.
6572762	6573162	Very cool.
6573362	6573542	Yeah.
6574222	6576823	Alright, well, other quick story for you guys.
6577764	6580464	This is actually really good news.
6580885	6582585	A lot of people are very excited to hear about this.
6583125	6593689	Sega put out a teaser trailer this week, 22 seconds, and it revealed that a new Jet Set Radio game, excuse me, not a new game, but a rebirth of the original game is on its way.
6593749	6597730	Jet Set Radio for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.
6598110	6600771	If you don't remember, I guess, or is it
6600911	6602292	is it Jet Grind or Jet Set?
6602352	6615520	I always get them Jet Grind Japanese version Jet Set American version Jet Grind Jet Grind for us Jet Set Radio Future was the Xbox one Future was the Xbox one that's not the one we're getting we're getting the original one from the Dreamcast
6615905	6616185	DarkSakura,
6635606	6646136	Well, but here's the thing, and it's going to be interesting to see how it affects this too, is that while it's really exciting to hear that, and it was a good game, and that was when you skateboarded around and did the graffiti, it was a lot of fun.
6646156	6647237	It's a cheap-o motto.
6647657	6649559	Well, that's the whole thing.
6649779	6650580	The soundtrack.
6650961	6653383	What happened when Crazy Taxi got re-released?
6653943	6657186	The, uh, um, fuck was that band?
6657427	6659068	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Offspring.
6659569	6660790	The Offspring song was gone.
6661010	6664111	But Bad Religion, wasn't that still the Bad Religion songs?
6664131	6665432	I think they replaced it with something else.
6666132	6669994	So it's possible that this game is going to get a different soundtrack.
6670054	6673295	And that is probably the same thing that's holding up the original Xbox.
6674596	6678938	The Jet Set Future from coming out is because they can't get the rights to the soundtrack.
6678958	6682239	They probably only licensed those songs specifically for that.
6682279	6683960	And so they can't suddenly put it out on 360.
6684000	6684040	So...
6686221	6689504	We'll see, because the soundtrack was a huge part of the game.
6689604	6699572	So it's like, well, they could license equally awesome songs, or they could try and put in generic stuff and see if the game will sell itself on nostalgia alone, which it probably would.
6700633	6702014	But it's going to be very interesting.
6702535	6703415	Very interesting to see.
6704276	6706438	So, anyhow, I'm still excited.
6708400	6708760	So there.
6708840	6711822	Also, it is impossible to sing Birthday Cake without doing...
6715145	6717267	Miho Hattori's accent.
6718588	6721510	Yes, I'm cooking for my son and his wife.
6721530	6721990	Extra sugar?
6722290	6723031	Extra salt?
6723612	6724233	I love that song.
6748576	6754520	We actually did get another email in after you checked it, Mr. Rob.
6754640	6755420	I'm going to read it last, though.
6756121	6758222	Fine, read it last.
6759623	6764947	This comes from Haseo Sumirogawa, so maybe it came after I read the last email from him.
6765867	6782177	Also, if two people shared two PS3 systems for whatever reason, and one bought a new copy of, let's say, Saints Row III with the online pass, and one bought it used without the online pass, could this person download the online pass from the other person's account and be able to play online?
6782378	6782518	No.
6782858	6782998	No.
6783798	6789462	Also, on the note of online passes, can a person without one still update their games and get DLCs?
6790678	6815628	yes you can get DLC the only thing you can't do is you can't play sadly enough you can't play System Link or whatever they call it LAN and you can't play online co-op well co-op for both of those so you can't play co-op but you can't play well co-op the horde mode as well but the rest of the game you can download DLC you can play single player you can do all that just can't play together
6815976	6816396	Haseo Sumirogawa
6842071	6842591	Next email.
6843191	6843992	Greetings, OLR.
6844052	6845332	It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
6845492	6847092	Just wanted to say hi and have a good week.
6847533	6849253	Your loyal turtle in Philly, Sirius Turtle.
6849433	6850493	Well, thank you.
6851614	6853574	Yeah, I guess I'm looking at Amazon.
6853614	6855095	It's all imports on there.
6855155	6858175	They want $104 for that Japanese import.
6858896	6859896	Good lord.
6862111	6862952	Oh, Chookaboo!
6863432	6864252	Look at that face!
6864892	6865633	For the record, Rob.
6865653	6866393	That is very cute.
6866473	6867834	It's a mascot cushion.
6868394	6868754	50 bucks.
6868975	6870115	I have to tell you something, Rob.
6870195	6870555	What's that?
6870856	6877259	Every time I play one of my blood elves and hop on my, um, whatever the crap their peep things are called...
6878640	6880061	They're striders or whatever.
6881382	6884104	My brain instantly starts playing the Chocobo music.
6884784	6891790	And Dan was walking in while I was writing on one, and I was actually humming the Chocobo theme in Undercity.
6892490	6894872	And he starts going, Chocobo bop!
6894992	6895693	Chocobo bop!
6896353	6896854	So it was cute.
6897074	6897314	Anyway.
6900176	6900657	Alrighty.
6901257	6902698	Get down to your Chocobo bop.
6903539	6903679	Yeah.
6905307	6907068	TBA for the North American release.
6907088	6910309	There's no date for this right now.
6910509	6915831	I could have sworn we had that they had confirmed it was coming here and gave a date, but I guess not.
6916471	6918251	I would imagine this is an E3 thing.
6918551	6920392	This is exactly why they're keeping it in their hat.
6920432	6921432	This is going to be an E3 thing.
6922093	6927975	Maybe there's a problem with it being on PSP and not PS Vita at this point, too.
6928035	6928555	But then again...
6930195	6957348	it came out in Japan with only a couple weeks to go before the Vita came out over there so they could still do it as a download thing they could really push it as a download title here in the US so I don't know someone doesn't have Japanese text installed on this computer yeah I know right well this is the show computer not my personal computer so but anyway I would imagine E3 you gotta hear something on this E3 this is too big of a title to not get released here but we'll see
6957836	6958957	Okay.
6959137	6960999	Can I jump in real quick for the chat room?
6961319	6962400	I want to follow up to something else.
6962440	6972749	I had several people stating this, is that something to remember about Jet Set Radio is that a lot of the soundtrack was done in-house, so a lot of that will probably stay.
6973089	6976572	But certainly there was some great licensed music, like the Chibomato comes to mind.
6976852	6978453	I really hope they're able to get that to stay.
6978513	6979774	But chatters, you are right.
6979855	6982797	The original in-house stuff will certainly stay, I'm sure.
6982977	6984318	Like Space Channel 5 didn't change.
6984619	6985379	That was all in-house.
6986080	6986180	Okay.
6987056	7002282	Dear Orange Lounge, I wanted to write to someone about my recent good experience with Nintendo customer service.
7002923	7006724	I bought a 3DS the day it came out, two days before the ambassador program began.
7007164	7008705	I sent my 3DS through the wash.
7009425	7013967	Now this is understandable if you are maybe 10, but I am 34, so I figured that was the end of that.
7014528	7015148	Womp womp.
7016269	7019550	It was my husband who suggested I send the system in for possible repair.
7020010	7021431	I dragged my heels for several months.
7021571	7022832	I was sure they would do nothing.
7023272	7025593	It is $85 to send a system in for repair.
7025993	7029294	Because my system was less than one year old, I received a $20 discount.
7030334	7034396	65 days later, I had a shopping label box it up and sent it away.
7034576	7039818	I explained to them that I sent it through the washer and was expecting to get the broken system back with a not our problem letter.
7039978	7040518	Wait, wait, $65 later?
7042429	7044971	because it was $85 to send them, but she had a $20 discount.
7045011	7045352	Oh, okay.
7045672	7048054	I thought for a minute, too, you said 65 days later.
7048074	7048515	I don't know why.
7048555	7049035	Okay, okay.
7049255	7049576	I'm good.
7049776	7050016	Okay.
7050777	7056382	Nine days later, the box came back, a letter explaining that they could not fix the old system and had replaced it with a brand new one.
7056842	7060846	My SD card, which I forgot to remove, was taped to the bottom of the cardboard box.
7061406	7063308	All of my pictures were still on the card.
7063668	7067492	It included instructions to re-download the lost content at no additional cost.
7068152	7082647	I had restored all of the games I purchased and was really happy with the new system and the promptness of their response after doing the homework to check the system I found they had signed the replacement system up for the ambassador program all free games were available for me to download squee
7085746	7088991	I wanted to be able to tell other gamers about this wonderful experience.
7089311	7097243	Nintendo went above and beyond helping a silly old lady who can't remember to empty her pockets.
7097643	7100127	Thanks again for your time and your game podcast, Emily.
7100848	7101829	Well, thank you for the story, Emily.
7101849	7102229	That's nice.
7102249	7103050	I guess Mayor Muse.
7103330	7109175	Well, you know, I think there's something, though, with that ambassador program because I notice you get a little certificate.
7109475	7110836	Like, I'm looking at my 3DS right now.
7111156	7115320	There's a little certificate that goes... I have a lot of icons, don't I?
7115640	7119303	But there's this application there that's just 3DS Ambassador Certificate.
7119403	7120804	That's all it is, and it sits there.
7121264	7125548	And when you open it, all it is, if I remember right, is do you want to opt in?
7125588	7126869	Like, it's just one question.
7127069	7129411	It says, do you want to opt in for notifications for this title?
7130086	7131026	Oh, no, no, it's a movie.
7131206	7131747	That's what it is.
7132027	7133627	Yeah, they just recently updated it.
7133667	7136188	Oh, but then they say receive notifications down there.
7136208	7136768	That's all it is.
7137268	7139289	So it doesn't really do anything.
7139889	7145871	But I'm thinking that being on your 3DS is what lets you download all that stuff.
7145991	7151452	And maybe because, guys, it's inevitable that they're going to come out with another 3DS.
7151953	7155974	Like they're going to incorporate that second circle pad into a new 3DS at some point.
7156354	7159355	So I've got to be able to transfer my ambassador shit over there.
7160035	7164598	So I'm thinking that little guy being there is the key somehow.
7164678	7169261	This probably ties to my console number somehow.
7169361	7176446	And Nintendo probably can generate that somehow in-house and did for your, you know, when you sent your 3DS back.
7176786	7177306	But that's great.
7177366	7178167	I mean, you're right.
7178807	7179968	Not a lot of folks would do that.
7180048	7182750	Oh, hey, my SpotPass notification just went off.
7182910	7183270	Look at that.
7184832	7184992	Aww.
7185032	7188054	That means kitty pictures in 3D.
7188734	7189474	Oh, Lord.
7189655	7190755	Yes, it's a swap note.
7190915	7192036	Oh, squee, I'm going to look that up.
7192476	7192916	Oh, great.
7193176	7193456	All right.
7193977	7196898	Wow, a Rick Santorum portrait made entirely of gay porn.
7198239	7199639	Talked about that on Horde House already.
7200900	7202461	Wow, it's made up of a lot of legs.
7203501	7204782	So, yeah.
7206403	7207243	That's it for the emails.
7208143	7208564	All right.
7208684	7211245	I want to see more good customer service posts.
7212515	7216449	Messages like that, that makes me feel joyous in my soul.
7217189	7222751	Bobby is in our chatroom, Bobby Blackwolf, saying, Rob, all that certificate does is let you get spot pass notifications.
7222791	7235636	Well, yeah, that's what the app does, but I thought, and I could have thought wrong, that somehow that application existing was what kind of enabled my 3DS to get all that.
7235676	7242319	Because obviously they've got to be looking at the MAC address on my system or something on the back end that tells them.
7242799	7243439	But, meh.
7244700	7244960	All right.
7246314	7248474	TigerClaw saying he sent me a swap note earlier.
7248535	7249635	Maybe it's finally getting here.
7249675	7251435	It seems like it takes a couple hours for things to get here.
7251495	7252075	No, this is Ranma.
7252415	7253736	Ranma has sent me a cat.
7254816	7255756	This is Indy.
7256156	7257957	He purrs like a race car.
7258257	7259717	Oh, because his name's Indy.
7260097	7260457	Look at that.
7260497	7260977	There's Indy.
7261737	7262398	Sorry, I'm derailing.
7262798	7265198	I'm derailing this radio show with my 3D pictures.
7265698	7265958	All right.
7268459	7269239	Any more emails?
7270759	7272900	You just made my eyes hurt here.
7274269	7274810	Sorry.
7275270	7276592	Alright, then let's get to the FUs.
7276612	7278434	Dan does that shit to me too with his phone.
7279255	7282158	Because he has that Android phone that has the 3D pictures.
7282279	7282679	Oh, really?
7282999	7283720	Here, let me do this.
7284021	7284241	There.
7285182	7285923	Now I'm not looking at it.
7286584	7287104	I'll close it.
7287164	7287545	It's fine.
7288085	7290849	Alright, what an appropriate time to get to the FUs of the week.
7306812	7310653	My FU of the week, I have a few actually because I've had a pissy week.
7311814	7318876	Number one, to me and involuntary actions of myself.
7320177	7326219	Also, FU to misunderstandings and...
7329255	7329955	Don't be an asshole.
7329995	7331176	Good advice.
7358032	7358632	To anybody.
7359153	7361454	Just because you're a parent doesn't mean you can be an asshole to your kids.
7362114	7363235	Treat them with respect, too.
7364995	7365396	That's it.
7365816	7366096	All right.
7366316	7366636	Loki.
7367597	7370998	Fuck you to people that don't know how to put lids on fast food drinks.
7372199	7374720	I mean, seriously, it's not that hard, people.
7374960	7376461	It's not hard to snap a lid on there.
7376561	7382384	If you really don't have that skill set, then you should just jump off a bridge, I think.
7386952	7387412	My F.U.
7387432	7393757	of the week isn't that serious because luckily things have been pretty good this week so I can't complain too much but I will give an F.U.
7394318	7394458	F.U.
7394498	7401363	to the fact that I forgot I have a doctor's appointment in the morning and I have like this stack of paperwork I have to fill out like I really don't want to do that tonight after the show but I F.U.
7402124	7403164	But I will say an F.U.
7403505	7404545	A very serious F.U.
7404605	7414953	to this amazing dessert I had at BJ's which yes is the name of a restaurant get your mind out of the gutter I had a pizookie
7415894	7418736	Their flavor right now is red velvet pizookie.
7420017	7420597	Oh my god!
7420737	7422038	You bitch.
7424040	7425301	I haven't been to BJ's in a while.
7425341	7428403	The last time I was there, they only had the chocolate and the peanut butter.
7428503	7431044	Yeah, it used to be like Oreo and regular.
7431705	7433626	Did it still taste like eating granulated sugar?
7434207	7435808	Kinda, but I didn't even care.
7435928	7438069	Chocolate chip or chunk or whatever.
7439210	7441532	But, but, but, but... Red velvet.
7442833	7443313	Oh my god.
7444409	7449216	I'm torn because they're putting in a Chick-fil-A in Folsom.
7450638	7459751	Now, Chick-fil-A openly supports propaganda against the gays in that community and stuff.
7460151	7462152	But their breakfast sandwiches are so delicious.
7462793	7470218	It's actually okay in Sacramento because the local franchise owners here in Sacramento actually support pro-LGBT causes.
7470238	7472399	But is that one the same franchise owner?
7472559	7473240	You'll have to check.
7473260	7475381	You'll have to check, but hopefully... The Arden one?
7475721	7478383	The owners are on the Lavender Chamber of Commerce.
7478403	7482086	They are on the Rainbow Chamber of Commerce because they are... I thought it was Lavender here.
7482106	7482506	Well, whatever.
7482586	7482966	It's gay.
7484147	7486509	Well, no, the owners... They're a couple.
7486609	7489771	They just want to offset, you know?
7490752	7519394	people's images of Chick-fil-A I know the corporate thing still goes towards those big charities but I like to think that their little bit is offsetting that part of what Chick-fil-A does and that the children's programs and everything and the education programs are still good I don't know it's hard to be okay with a service that is preaching hate in one hand yet doing really good things for kids you know, I don't know what to think my brain explodes
7522185	7527293	JV Mon just had the balls to tell me in chat that Red Velvet is overrated and you know what my response was?
7527874	7528475	Get out!
7531206	7534708	All right, he can stay, but don't you ever talk bad about Red Velvet again.
7535188	7536509	All right, moving on.
7536529	7539931	So yeah, it looks like you'll be okay to get your breakfast sandwiches, Loki.
7540951	7542592	The rest of you, you'll have to come to Sacramento to do it.
7542612	7547095	I probably won't be able to go over there, but they were really, really good.
7548175	7548536	We went there.
7549036	7553058	I actually checked into Facebook or something on it, and I had all these replies.
7553078	7555039	I said, what in the hell are you doing at Chick-fil-A?
7555079	7556280	Don't you know you're not supposed to go there?
7556560	7558081	I'm like, no, you guys, it's okay.
7558321	7559021	This one's okay.
7559141	7559902	It's not as bad.
7560233	7562154	and Bacon Maple Donuts are fucking delicious.
7563214	7563434	All right.
7563474	7565995	I do have to tell you one thing about Chick-fil-A when I lived in Alabama.
7566075	7566235	What?
7566835	7569596	I worked at the mall and the Chick-fil-A there because my friends worked there.
7570056	7576338	They would always save me the little tiny hash brown things from breakfast so that I could have them anytime during the day.
7576718	7577019	Nice.
7579099	7580960	And those things in Polynesian sauce are crack.
7581641	7587384	Let's move on so we can get to Twitter topics and the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7587444	7590506	But not just yet, because we have just a few more stories for you guys.
7590806	7591067	Loki.
7591447	7592768	Now this is kind of weird.
7593368	7601193	They're actually going to be putting out a free-to-play multiplayer version of Killzone 3 on the PlayStation Network.
7601253	7604134	Now this is the multiplayer portion of Killzone 3.
7605215	7608037	It's not really anything new, but it's going to be free-to-play.
7608917	7609417	Thanks for watching!
7626604	7632809	Most of the people are paying for the multiplayer portion of Call of Duty, not so much the campaign.
7634171	7639035	You can just kind of skip the pleasantries and just get the multiplayer portion, plus it's free to play.
7639055	7641677	I mean, it's an interesting experiment that they're trying.
7642198	7644420	That is, I guess, available soon.
7651346	7651827	on Tuesday.
7652789	7658659	Sorry I'm furiously adding people to my 3DS over here because I had somebody ask for cat pics so I needed friend code.
7659020	7659260	Alright.
7663064	7671187	I'm trying to think of other cases where this has been done before where they stripped out part of the game and then kind of like put it up on the marketplace just by its own.
7671468	7672188	Kind of interesting.
7673048	7683092	We had a story last week about Metal Gear Solid 4's online component was shutting down and it seems strange to me that they didn't try to strip that out at some point and kind of make it a standalone game.
7683432	7684813	Probably because no one played it.
7684833	7687494	That's why they shut the servers down.
7687514	7690935	They're like, well, we'll just disappoint those two people still playing their
7691275	7692435	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7715666	7716967	Bionic Commando Rearmed Barcelona Grin
7736425	7736525	What? !
7751440	7751620	Wack
7774840	7780906	You'd hear a little, and, oh, there's all this blood everywhere.
7784168	7788712	Like, one of those little quick blade things, and then all of a sudden... You mean his cipher?
7789193	7790334	Yeah, that's a cipher.
7791495	7794458	Because this totally reminds me of the opening to Cube.
7794718	7798101	Oh, you got split in half.
7798161	7799082	Sucks to be that guy.
7800236	7800976	Well, here's the thing, though.
7800996	7804799	Capcom worked on, or excuse me, Grin Barcelona worked on that.
7804939	7806880	Capcom rejected it.
7806980	7808801	Capcom canceled the project.
7809301	7813003	Grin was going to do it anyway and just change the IP.
7813243	7816305	Make it like, you know, Ninja Game, you know, or something a little different.
7817426	7821388	But after that didn't happen, it got canceled.
7821928	7826051	They tried to do a Streets of Rage reboot instead.
7826920	7838457	and Sega and it didn't happen they got shut down so it's very I mean Grin did Bionic Commando they were trying Strider they were doing Final Fantasy they apparently had Streets of Rage
7840029	7843111	Goddamn, they were working on a lot of classic reboots.
7843371	7847113	I don't think any of us realized how vested they were in bringing back old shit.
7847153	7852717	I'm just imagining a Metal Gear Solid-style game with Strider Hero.
7854077	7856999	In concept, you kind of look at it like Strider was pretty fucking awesome.
7857059	7862322	So, Metal Gear Rising Revengeance, which Revengeance is such a stupid name.
7862382	7865164	That's the Capcom Namco Sega project.
7867296	7868176	Revengeance.
7868937	7870317	That's a dumb name.
7871398	7878141	But yeah, there's a bunch of artwork on this Spanish website that you can kind of look at some of the concept art for the Strider thing that got cancelled.
7878181	7880382	But you don't actually see Strider, just so you know.
7881202	7881902	They had to change it.
7882182	7883083	That makes me sad.
7884243	7888165	That's something they'll probably show at E3 is Melody Rising stuff.
7888453	7891454	Oh yeah, Metal Gear, I was like, what are you talking about?
7891494	7892355	Grim got canned in 2009.
7892395	7896397	Although Capcom really should do Strider because what else do they got?
7896437	7899258	They're rebooting Devil May Cry, I guess.
7899558	7904400	I just saw some article on the internet this week too about like it was defending Strider.
7904540	7906981	Oh no, you posted on Facebook for Dan.
7907382	7910203	It was a whole thing about Strider on the NES was not that bad.
7910612	7911333	Thanks for watching!
7931106	7949416	and he of course he also worked on Strider 2 which is easy but very fun and um but that moon dancer is like basically like a four-player Strider yeah it is it's cool I like that so all right uh there you go just interesting that that studio was working on all that and finally got leaked by
7950174	7963387	A disgruntled employee Well, we need more I mean, not really So, you know that Oklahoma law that we had actually discussed before about a bill to put a 1% tax on violent video games?
7964027	7966470	Well, it failed Like we knew it would
7968271	7972053	Basically, this guy has such an awesomely badass name.
7972454	7975055	Too bad he's, you know, stupid.
7975676	7976857	William Forekiller.
7977697	7978317	Forekiller.
7978938	7979338	Rawr.
7980899	7989785	Anyway, he suggested that any game with an ESRB rating of teen or above should have the tax on it, and that the revenue would go to fighting childhood obesity and bullying.
7990586	8001318	um it was tweaked to focus on creating a task force into the relationship of video games to the two issues and it was voted down by a margin of five to six
8003218	8029791	and so one of the other representatives Pat Owenby asked why video games why not french fries or rap music or movies and 4killer said we have to start somewhere there's no magic bullet that will solve these issues but I wanted to raise awareness of those two issues and basically everyone said representative Mike Reynolds said it's not a good idea we could have a task force on the multiple reasons of childhood obesity so
8030951	8031191	Nope.
8032471	8033512	Basically, it's been failing.
8033572	8034732	It failed before in New Mexico in 2008.
8035672	8039433	At least your state won't be spending $1.8 million to defend it in court.
8039734	8040694	Just saying.
8040714	8043635	Foo!
8043935	8044555	Yes, exactly.
8044615	8045435	Foo, indeed.
8046415	8047076	All right, anyhow.
8047876	8048336	Yeah, that's it.
8049738	8050719	Moving on, Loki.
8051859	8052219	All right.
8053280	8060183	So we've kind of seen this type of thing happen before and kind of know where it's going to go, but we'll give them the benefit of the doubt.
8060883	8065625	Apparently, there's a new game called BandFuse that's going to be coming out, BandFuse Rock Legends.
8065965	8071167	It uses real guitars to play, learn music, or whatever.
8071868	8074649	And also, they're having microphones involved in this as well.
8075029	8075669	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8093838	8097119	A bunch of big name artists in it as well.
8098860	8106242	I want to say this is being put out by... Because I saw this a while back and I was like, another music game, another guitar game.
8106782	8107983	I can't remember who's publishing it.
8108043	8113665	I want to say it's a really small company like Maximum Family Games or something like that.
8114825	8119506	So there's going to be no sort of advertising or whatever on it.
8119587	8119767	But...
8123126	8127888	Yeah, it'll be coming out this fall and probably will do just about as well as... What was that?
8128189	8128709	PowerGig.
8128769	8129409	PowerGig.
8130890	8135412	Because I was going to say, I think this game already exists like twice.
8135592	8136593	Well, yeah.
8136953	8139955	One of them is doing pretty well and the other one not as well.
8140115	8144937	Rocksmith did okay, but PowerGig tanked.
8145357	8145557	Right.
8145978	8148219	I think it's just that whole... Well...
8149761	8152342	You have to buy a guitar if you don't already have one.
8152862	8161425	And, I mean, if you have one, you probably have other ways to learn how to play guitar other than buying a $60 game.
8162846	8163666	Well, you know what, though?
8163946	8175690	And I think I talked about this a couple weeks ago on the show, is that I don't know anyone who bought Power Gig, but I do know some actual musicians who bought Rocksmith just because it was kind of something that was relevant to their interest, and they're really into it because it's so...
8178992	8182855	It's actual guitar playing unlike rock band is more the plastic instruments.
8182995	8189220	Although rock band tried to incorporate it, I guess Rocksmith takes a much better teaching approach to it.
8189940	8191862	And I think a lot of musicians really appreciate that.
8191882	8192883	At least that's what I'm seeing.
8193143	8195685	But does it necessitate three different games?
8196265	8196526	No.
8196646	8199087	But then again, we didn't really need Rock Revolution either.
8200168	8200248	No.
8201289	8228761	so this I hate to say it but I think this band fuse rock legends is going to end up being the rock revolution of the bunch I mean yeah we'll see we'll see what they do with it who knows so all right anyhow one more story for you guys and then we're going to open up the skype line and I think this is great news an old classic game is coming back to the 3ds Seaman
8229781	8230722	Yay!
8230742	8231804	That's right, Seaman.
8231964	8233086	Get your minds out of the gutter.
8233646	8239875	Seaman, with an A. Seaman is coming out on the 3DS.
8240536	8244461	It is a report from a Japanese news outlet named Nikkei.
8246143	8263012	C-Man is apparently targeted by Nintendo to come back to the 3DS that's the type of thing that Nintendo is targeting but there's no other detail on the update so I don't think we're talking about just like a dump of the Dreamcast game I think we're talking about
8264494	8266015	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8293033	8316103	that would say cute things like mar mar mar and you keep talking to them and eventually they would start talking back and ask you questions and be kind of rude to you and then they would eventually because you had to moderate their temperature in their tank and water level and all of this and eventually they would grow amphibious and you would turn their little tank into a terrarium and then mar mar mar
8318017	8320800	Dan and I would say that over and over again when we were first playing that game.
8321180	8325684	And then we got Hey You Pikachu, which was... Which already existed.
8325924	8326284	Oh, did it?
8326485	8327405	I believe it did.
8327485	8330068	It was actually called Pikachu Genkidichu.
8332109	8333611	And that actually was already out in Japan.
8334562	8335902	So, what month is your birthday in?
8335922	8336122	October
8364918	8366519	You were born in October?
8368200	8368501	Yes.
8368741	8370182	Let's try that again.
8371183	8375206	In what month were you born?
8376026	8376827	October.
8378108	8379709	You were born in October?
8380049	8380369	Yes.
8382031	8386034	I wonder if people would say you're a trick or a treat.
8387054	8387875	That's a good one.
8389898	8391039	Like the spice.
8392360	8395142	You know, I never noticed that Seaman sounds like George Takei.
8395162	8398004	Well, you can look, but don't touch.
8399565	8400485	I don't want to touch you.
8404128	8404948	What do you want?
8405909	8406469	To touch you.
8408351	8409712	I don't know that word.
8410752	8411533	You just said it.
8411593	8415095	So, what day is your birthday on?
8416316	8416816	The 2nd.
8418277	8418498	The 2nd?
8419716	8420336	Yes, bitch.
8422037	8425437	Mahatma Gandhi was also born on October 2nd.
8426538	8428418	I hope you are as peaceful as he.
8429458	8434039	I would loathe to be stuck in here with an aggressive human being.
8436240	8436700	Fuck you.
8438901	8445282	Listen, I don't know if our relationship can handle this, you know?
8446602	8448543	Besides, what would the neighbors think?
8449471	8449951	Fuck them!
8452834	8453514	Fuck them!
8455195	8456777	Hey, why all the noise?
8458758	8459219	Your mama.
8461540	8461921	What?
8462661	8463762	Your mama.
8466084	8466424	Mama.
8468526	8469967	Nope, I'm just fine.
8471008	8471268	Wait.
8473429	8474690	Sorry, I'm busy.
8475351	8476272	You don't look busy.
8477347	8483471	I've been thinking about this, and if my calculations are correct, you must be a Libra.
8484492	8488154	I'll bet you get crushes on people all the time, huh?
8488194	8490096	Just don't get any ideas about me.
8491036	8492397	Let's just be friends.
8493338	8493998	For now.
8497240	8498141	I'll friend your butt.
8500182	8501583	Are you coming on to me?
8502344	8502624	Yes.
8504986	8505266	Yes!
8508993	8511273	Put this tongue in that mouth.
8512034	8512734	Dream on.
8514214	8515054	No fool for you.
8515214	8519195	Now go think about what I've said and we'll talk again later.
8538391	8543633	Apparently that same guy has a bunch of playthroughs on there, but none are as good as I'll Fringe Your Butt.
8544553	8545174	So there you go.
8545234	8546834	And that clip is from 2008.
8546994	8550376	But then again, Seaman was what?
8550876	8550376	2001?
8551216	8552036	Something like that.
8552536	8552897	There you go.
8553757	8554197	All right.
8555438	8558339	That does it for the news tonight.
8558419	8562720	And we're going to open up the Skype line right now at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8563121	8565982	Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8566162	8566702	There it is.
8568925	8570867	Did the Oscars finally finish?
8571507	8571928	Is it over?
8573449	8574069	I don't know.
8575170	8575791	I haven't cared.
8575811	8577192	I've just been looking at Rafferazzi.
8578733	8582316	That site has been funnier than anything that ever could have been.
8582917	8584218	I'm assuming the artist won.
8584938	8585319	Whatever.
8587521	8588662	Seems like it from Twitter.
8589022	8595127	All because of the picture of them drinking little bottles of Grey Goose on stage with the hashtag Scorsese.
8599244	8599884	Scorsese.
8600144	8602425	Did that chick win an Oscar for pooping in the sink?
8603225	8603485	What?
8606066	8607526	That was like her thing in Bridesmaids.
8607566	8607906	Forget it.
8607986	8608667	I didn't see that.
8608827	8609127	All right.
8609147	8610627	1-877-GAME-OLR.
8610687	8612428	I see good movies, Rob.
8612468	8613228	What are you talking about?
8613868	8615969	Apparently the Bridesmaids was pretty good.
8615989	8616669	That's what I'm hearing.
8617253	8618093	All right, moving on.
8618854	8620155	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8620175	8620595	Who's this?
8621155	8621735	It's Ranma.
8621755	8622496	What's up, everyone?
8622676	8624197	Hey, how you doing, Ronnie?
8624977	8625938	I'm doing pretty good.
8625978	8626918	How about you, Rob?
8626978	8627258	Good.
8627298	8630880	I'm just looking at chat room and Bobby saying, I'll Oscar your butt.
8632701	8633261	Oh, wow.
8633601	8634362	Well played.
8634602	8635362	What's on your mind, Ranma?
8636683	8637383	I went out and got a 3DS.
8638854	8644455	That's why you were dogging on the Vita in chat, because I was like, man, Ranma's hating on the Vita.
8644636	8645516	Oh, now it's explained.
8645536	8646776	You just bought a 3DS.
8647536	8648416	Actually, no.
8648937	8651017	I have other reasons for hating on the 3DS.
8651037	8653158	All right, let's talk about your seething hatred first.
8653218	8654158	Wait, wait.
8654418	8656018	You have reasons for hating on 3DS?
8656519	8658039	No, no, not the 3DS.
8658279	8659479	No, no, no.
8659739	8661460	What are your reasons for hating on the Vita?
8662829	8666212	I still stand by the point of the price of it.
8666352	8670376	I mean, because I remember when the PSP came out and I was there selling them.
8670816	8673718	And then it's like that whole week they sold it.
8673799	8675440	After that, it just dropped.
8675520	8676501	Nobody wanted one.
8677101	8678943	It just didn't go anywhere.
8679824	8682025	I just feel that it's the Vita.
8682045	8683166	It may have to say the Vita.
8683487	8684768	And I understand that.
8685920	8690344	Sony is going to say with the PS3, for a premium system, you have to pay a premium price.
8691004	8702453	I just think that Nintendo kind of set the price point of where if the portable console is like under $150 or within the $150-$200 range, it's well worth it.
8702814	8711841	But for $249 for a portable console or $299 for another portable console, you're better off just buying a regular system and hooking it up to your TV.
8714201	8716662	Alright, I mean, I can see that.
8716842	8720664	The $299 is for the 3G model, and that'll buy you a PlayStation 3.
8721244	8725386	So, I can see where the price is hurting people, but...
8726644	8727044	I don't know.
8727684	8728825	I'm a sucker for this shit.
8728865	8729605	What can I say?
8730566	8731386	I'm not hating.
8731486	8732466	I want a Vita.
8732846	8736188	But I will gladly wait until the price comes down.
8736228	8743130	I just can't see $250 for a portable console, but I could put that towards a system hookup to my TV.
8745822	8749805	All right, so let's make this a conversation about love instead.
8749885	8750586	So you bought your 3DS.
8750626	8751147	Yes.
8751507	8752668	I'm assuming you like it.
8753348	8753629	Love it.
8754249	8754509	Yeah?
8755130	8755390	Mm-hmm.
8756131	8759554	Well, what made you decide I'm going to take the plunge and get a 3DS?
8760214	8760855	Mario Kart 7.
8765118	8765619	Is that it?
8765779	8770283	Mario Kart 7 was a good enough game where you were like, that's it, I'm buying it, or is there stuff on the horizon?
8771366	8775828	Actually, at first, that's what really did it for me, because I love playing the Mario Kart racing games.
8776229	8786093	But when I went to get my 3DS, they were sold out of it, and I'm looking at whatever games was left, and I found, upon the last copy of Star Fox 64 3DS, and I picked that up.
8786234	8788595	And those are my games I've been playing back and forth.
8791056	8791456	All right.
8791756	8794338	Well, what are you looking forward to in the future from 3DS?
8794598	8796259	Or is Mario Kart 7 going to last you through 2013?
8797731	8801414	I don't know if it's going to last through 2013, but I've already... Swap note, Will!
8802574	8804135	Oh, yeah.
8804156	8804616	3DS kitties.
8805516	8806877	I know, I'm glad you liked the kitty.
8807718	8808098	I did.
8808358	8810440	Do you like the 3D cats I send you?
8810940	8811441	Of course.
8811701	8816604	Now that we have a cat, his name is India, I have to start taking a few more shots and sending them over to everyone.
8816784	8817445	Right answer.
8817485	8821688	And then I'll show your cat to my cat, and it'll be awkward because cats can't see the 3D.
8822248	8822668	But anyway...
8825613	8847434	and I find it kind of amusing, like you say about Swapnote, because this whole weekend I'm at Manga Next and every time I sit down and pull out my 3DS to play a game, I see the little icon to go over to the Mii Plaza and I'm like going through Find Mii and the puzzle swap and I'm like, at this rate, I will not get a chance to play the games that I want to play.
8847714	8851416	Oh yeah, cons, you get that stuff crazy fast.
8852276	8856998	I can't even tell you, last year at E3, keep in mind the price drop hadn't happened yet.
8857038	8863241	I was sitting there in the E3, oh my god, you would open up your 3DS and 10 characters are there.
8863601	8867543	You process them all and take them through 5E and then another 5 more have arrived.
8867903	8868783	It's just crazy.
8869344	8874266	I've noticed that at 10, it only lets you bring 10 friends in at a time.
8874306	8874486	Yes.
8875706	8875926	Tip.
8876347	8876807	Pro tip.
8878648	8885330	But now there's Find Me 2 and now there's Puzzle Swaps and been bigger so there's even more to street pass with.
8885671	8889032	And I will say this since we're kind of talking about the Vita versus the 3DS.
8890112	8893474	The street passing makes a lot more sense than Nier to me right now.
8893534	8894154	I don't get Nier.
8894414	8896155	Nier has no rhyme or reason to it.
8896215	8898096	It's just free shit the app.
8899608	8899768	Rob?
8899788	8900549	You click the button.
8900809	8901770	There's people near you.
8902150	8902830	Free shit!
8903111	8905072	Even when people aren't near me, it's like, free shit!
8905332	8906133	Yeah, I know.
8906413	8908234	I get it randomly from people on my friends list.
8908394	8909115	It's nothing useful.
8909135	8910636	Blackwolf has sent you Katamari.
8910836	8911496	Free shit!
8911536	8912017	Yay!
8912197	8913178	Nothing useful, though.
8913218	8915599	He's not near me, so why is Blackwolf showing up in near?
8915659	8917761	I'm getting a ton of unlocks for games I don't have.
8918161	8919602	No unlocks for games I do have.
8919622	8920923	They're trying to get you to buy it.
8920983	8921704	That's the problem.
8923025	8923285	Anyhow.
8924586	8925246	Alright, Rama.
8925526	8926367	Rob, one thing.
8926587	8928889	Do you remember... Tell me you remember Sesame Street.
8929807	8931167	No, I don't remember Sesame Street.
8931187	8938929	Come on, who the fuck doesn't remember Sesame Street?
8939009	8941630	I'm sorry, when you said near, that's the first thing that came to mind.
8941930	8942410	Same here.
8942470	8946871	Well, keep in mind, I listen to that sketch about once a week because I play it for Julian on my phone.
8949191	8950952	He goes, go over silly.
8954499	8960501	So tell us about, since you're like the con king, is there any conventions coming up real soon that we should be paying attention to?
8963662	8977288	Let's see, we have Springfest in Brooklyn coming up next month, followed by Shocker, PAX East, Anime Boston, same weekend, two different convention centers, made a best con win.
8977908	8980909	Oh, Boston's going to be a crazy town this week.
8981969	8983989	That's crazy they still do them on the same weekend.
8984929	8987230	This is the first time something like this has happened.
8988990	8990350	Wait, I thought that happened last year.
8991430	8992711	No, no, no, no.
8992771	8998592	Last year, the cons were a month apart, and the first year, both conventions were a week apart.
8999392	8999892	Oh, okay.
9000132	9002252	All right, so they've been inching closer and closer together.
9002572	9006673	You could say they've been getting nearer and nearer to each other.
9008862	9012164	This is your old pal, Grover.
9012884	9017267	And today, I'm going to talk to you about near and far.
9017988	9023431	In fact, I, Little Furry Grover, am going to show you near and far.
9024412	9024992	Okay, here goes.
9025973	9027414	First, this is near.
9036092	9038195	This is far!
9039738	9041661	This is Sparta!
9045120	9046901	This is near.
9046921	9049863	That's about the point that he starts giggling madly.
9049983	9060689	I'm waiting for somebody to take that audio and just superimpose pictures of this is near and then this is far would be pictures of the 3G or something.
9060809	9061129	I don't know.
9062030	9063831	Somebody think of something funnier and do that.
9065152	9066693	Ranma, I gotta let you go so we can get more calls.
9067293	9067853	No problem.
9068013	9068954	Alright, have a good one.
9069414	9069814	You too.
9070234	9070614	Bye.
9071534	9075356	He sounded like the minute I started playing Sesame Street Clips, he was ready to get off the phone.
9077897	9078977	What are you trying to say, Ranma?
9078997	9080477	You don't like Sesame Street Clips?
9083458	9085099	Quick, favorite Sesame Street sketch.
9086179	9090921	I would have to say the Count and Cookie Monster cooperating over counting the plate of cookies.
9093334	9100838	I would say when the shopkeeper died I'm not trying to be morbid but I thought they handled it very tastefully like you know for kids it's a hard thing to explain to kids
9109107	9110809	Call us now.
9111049	9113951	The number is 1-877-GAME-OLLR.
9113971	9117314	We're waiting for your calls.
9117354	9118455	Yeah, see, I missed this.
9119697	9120898	The original theme song.
9120958	9122719	Because the theme song now is fucked up.
9128197	9133299	I've heard some pretty, like, screwed up... It's... I don't even know what that shit was anymore.
9133319	9134099	It's weird.
9134159	9136100	Sesame Street, New Techno House Mix.
9136480	9137361	Is this like Dubstep?
9137401	9137641	No.
9137941	9138521	Sesame Street?
9138541	9139521	Dubstep is evil.
9139641	9142963	It's the Rhythm Party version.
9155339	9156540	Okay.
9156560	9159561	Is anybody going to call 1877 Game OLR?
9159821	9161782	I'll keep the Sesame Street clips coming.
9162382	9163483	Don't fucking make me do it.
9163543	9164483	Oh, hey, we should go to the Twitter.
9164863	9166824	Twitter.com slash OLR.
9167104	9169445	I just want to thank some folks who gave us some shout-outs tonight.
9169585	9171866	Orange Wright said he's listening to OLR.
9171926	9172266	Thank you.
9172666	9175328	And our good buddy Asuka is back tonight.
9175848	9177088	I saw her in chat a minute ago.
9177749	9179810	She must have left because it's probably getting late over there.
9179830	9183111	But I see a celebrity endorsement on her Twitter right there.
9183351	9185394	Sadly, I've stopped watching the tester.
9185514	9188438	Oh yeah, after last week, I was like, I guess I'm done.
9188678	9191442	Although apparently this week was dramas.
9192123	9193224	Big drama this week.
9194045	9197110	Like, the internet's favorite person went home this week.
9197190	9199693	So now it's going to be interesting to see if anybody watches next week.
9200327	9201968	So they sent home, what's his name?
9202448	9204149	I didn't want to spoil it, oops.
9204469	9206030	But yeah, they sent home what's his name.
9206070	9208091	And they sent home the cute redhead.
9208351	9209892	Both redheads gone back to back.
9210313	9210793	It's a shame.
9210953	9211813	Don't care anymore.
9213254	9215575	Redheads and popular people are the only reason I tune into shows.
9216716	9219097	It's time for a girl to win.
9219437	9220137	But here's the thing.
9220257	9229319	After kind of talking to Asuka and watching what played out in that second week episode, I don't really want to form my opinions off these people on what I'm seeing on TV.
9229879	9232519	If I had the time here on OLR, we'd get them all on.
9232759	9236980	In fact, we should make all ten of them call in and they'll all have to fight each other for airtime or something.
9237020	9237340	I don't know.
9237881	9244182	But if I had to go based off what I've seen on the TV, I like the girl with the tattoos.
9244562	9245643	I think a girl needs to win.
9246103	9247143	It's time for some girl power.
9247964	9249884	And I would like to see that girl with the tattoos.
9249904	9250525	Seems really cool.
9251005	9252626	So we'll see, I guess.
9254126	9258388	Not saying, you know, all the boys are bad, but it's just, you know, we had two boys win already.
9258428	9259168	It's time for a girl to win.
9261289	9261590	All right.
9263390	9266272	Going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
9266432	9269433	Hitstun asks, I wonder if Sky's watching Cross Assault.
9269533	9271314	I have never in my life heard of that.
9271354	9271714	What is that?
9274181	9275422	I've never heard of Cross Assault.
9278244	9279024	Other Twitter topics.
9279124	9286409	I think Cross Assault is a fighting game one that has to do with Street Fighter X Tekken.
9287250	9287950	Oh, good lord.
9288350	9289511	Wait, it's a reality show?
9289811	9295195	I don't remember, but it's something that has to do with Street Fighter X Tekken.
9295819	9297220	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9321249	9324056	Oh, I do have to say, I have updated my portfolio with the stuff I did for Umlaut.
9331445	9332085	Well, there you go.
9333106	9335327	You're going to be on Design Star or whatever.
9335367	9335787	I wish.
9336507	9341689	I have always said when they do a reality show for who wants to be a game show host, I am fucking there.
9342130	9345111	I will cut whatever bitch I have to to host my own game show.
9345131	9349773	And you know what the prize should be is hosting a revival of Press Your Luck done the right way.
9349853	9352514	Not that whammy shit they did on GSN a couple years ago.
9352554	9355335	I'm talking old school Press Your Luck, old school set.
9355835	9356276	Why not?
9356456	9357516	It's a Facebook game right now.
9358156	9359157	It's got a lot of people playing it.
9360430	9365153	So yes, I want to host the new Press Your Luck and I will do a reality competition to do it if I have to.
9365574	9365994	Just saying.
9366674	9368596	There are hits on LinkedIn and chat.
9368636	9373119	Twitch.tv or www.twitch.tv Oh, Capcom Unity.
9373159	9374179	So it's a Capcom thing.
9374219	9376441	Yes, it's Namco cross Capcom.
9377362	9378102	Cross Sega.
9378422	9379103	Cross Bandai.
9382754	9392391	I'm sorry, Street Fighter X Tekken because Tekken had bad box art Mega Man and Pac-Man and all sorts of weird shit
9392802	9395263	Alright, I'm going to give it one more second to see if anyone's going to call.
9395383	9408870	Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio or 1-877-GAME-OLR You know, I would expect there's less people listening tonight because of the Oscars and all that stuff, but our chat room's hopping, so I'm surprised there's not more people wanting to call, but if y'all are going to be shy, that's fine.
9409130	9413332	Going to Twitter, Tigerclaw sent me a lot of links, and get this, we talked about all these things on the show.
9413493	9416314	Tigerclaw, you forgot, Pac-Man on DVD, we talked about that last week.
9416494	9418735	That's alright, I sometimes forget the shit we talk about on the show too.
9419536	9420096	So, there you go.
9421916	9422477	I will say this.
9422777	9430584	Actdeft sent me a tweet about another victim of Xbox Live hackings because this shit is still going on and yet still no word from Microsoft.
9430924	9431665	But I find this interesting.
9431945	9434067	He sent me a screen grab of a forum post.
9434147	9435649	I don't know what forum this is.
9436169	9438571	But he sent me this thing.
9439172	9444396	And what's interesting about this guy is he's saying that they bought 4,000 points on his account.
9445037	9445678	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9469674	9493317	Whatever had been licensed to it And that made me think about when my Xbox got hacked some time ago Oh my god, I used to buy like every Xbox Live arcade game that was released That person, if they knew to do it, was probably able to get like 80, 90 I'm serious, I had a problem I looked on Xbox Live for a while Since you mentioned it out of curiosity Went to the hackedonexbox.com site again They have 49 unresolved case stories right now
9494277	9519049	two that have moved from unresolved to resolved so wow you know and here's the thing is that I know 49 doesn't sound like a lot but that's 49 people who know about this website who are in the gaming you know there's tons of people getting hacked we don't even know about like one of my friends from high school was hacked and you know he wouldn't seek out a gaming community to post it he also hadn't played his Xbox in like six months at least
9519901	9524204	Alright, TigerClaw said, oh, but I want to get one story in, so how about this one?
9524244	9525025	I said, okay.
9525666	9529849	So he sent us this tweet, and I guess I'll close with this because our Skype line is either broken or I don't know.
9530249	9540277	But this topic from Edge Magazine, he tweeted us, Awada throwing shade at Nikkei, Japanese news outlet Nikkei, which we brought up earlier in the show.
9540817	9543941	He's saying, quote, gossip magazine techniques.
9544422	9550449	Apparently this is because Nikkei on the website ran a story which said Nintendo is trying to bring back titles like Seaman.
9551603	9561531	Oh, so apparently it said that Iwata had a quote that said, unless Nintendo changed its ways as a matter of urgency, it would collapse.
9562271	9569577	And Iwata went to Twitter and said, this is inaccurate, this continues repeatedly, and it's gossip magazine techniques.
9570558	9571158	Interesting.
9572589	9574731	Very similar to another thing I was reading on the internet.
9574951	9578715	You know, Penny Arcade has their new little press site thing, the PA report, right?
9578775	9589725	It's a neat concept for a site because it really focuses on features and lets other people handle the news, which I think is a smart way to do it just because it's so hard right now to stay on top of the news and all that.
9590326	9592328	And there's this article on David Jaffe.
9593268	9601351	Where he got in a verbal confrontation with one of the guys from Kotaku And the guy from PA Report is there and has it on tape What?
9601692	9604413	David Jaffe getting in a confrontation with somebody?
9604893	9607714	And throwing colorful languages in the mix?
9608134	9618298	I don't believe it That has got to be fake He's not a complete douche or anything No, he would never do that
9620598	9624361	I'm serious, him and fucking Cliffy B need to get in a fucking argument right there.
9624601	9625942	That I would pay to see.
9627983	9628584	Dushov, go!
9630025	9630365	Alright.
9631446	9633047	Well, the Skype line ain't working, I guess.
9633427	9639671	I'm getting private messages from people saying they're trying to call and it's not working, so I... IDK what's up.
9639691	9643214	But Skype not working, that's gotta be a load of crap.
9643654	9644595	I know, I know.
9645114	9649516	Alright, well, I got a private message from Jester Scott saying, I can't get through.
9649656	9652438	I wanted to call and say thank you for the show and keep up the good work.
9652518	9653078	Oh, that's nice.
9653558	9654959	Warm fuzzies, warm fuzzies.
9655439	9657360	Group hug, red velvet cookies for all.
9657960	9659001	But I guess Skype fail.
9659241	9662203	And as other people in the chat room are saying, Ranma broke it.
9662923	9664204	Alright, I'll accept that reasoning.
9664284	9664884	Ranma broke it.
9665844	9666705	Thank you, Ranma.
9668286	9670807	Loki, any last minute stories you want to get out before we say goodnight tonight?
9671707	9677728	Yeah, I was reading on something because I subscribed to the Dash Hacks Network thing talking about hacking stuff.
9678068	9687071	Apparently, you know these new system updates that they keep rolling out from Microsoft's Xbox and how they're fixing color correction problems and stuff.
9687091	9689871	You know when they're patching something that has to do with color correction.
9690391	9692132	That's not exactly what they're doing.
9692652	9693893	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9713810	9716352	Their consoles will be unstoppable.
9716572	9718813	Basically, there's no way to patch this out.
9719874	9721595	That sounds like they're pulling a Sony.
9722115	9722715	Unhackable.
9722996	9723616	No way to patch.
9724176	9730580	Well, apparently, I don't know what's involved with it, but this new chip will make it impossible for them to patch it out.
9732361	9732541	Neat.
9735220	9743542	Alright, if that's it for the last minute stories, then I'm going to go around and get everybody's final thought.
9743582	9745082	DarkSakura, we'll start with you ladies first.
9746423	9749284	I shouldn't have eaten so early because I'm freaking hungry.
9750324	9755225	And like, with my stressful ass day, I ate no lunch, really.
9755425	9756965	You want another one of those gingerbread pita chips?
9756985	9757726	Because they're really good.
9757866	9758066	No.
9758926	9760646	It actually had a little bit too much bite for me.
9761166	9761426	Alright.
9762187	9763107	Loki, your final thought.
9764225	9781542	My final thought is I really hope that this game of Luminous I'm Playing actually records because the last four of them that I've done, and yes, I did eventually hit quit so that this, you know, it would record my score or something like that, have not recorded and reset each time, so that's kind of annoying.
9781562	9782903	Okay.
9783563	9793929	My final thought for tonight is, you know, we've been doing this thing where we talk about video games in the same room without Skype because, you know, Skype clearly doesn't even want to work half the time as you can see tonight.
9794069	9806035	We've been doing it this way for going on 10 years this June and, you know, not once have we ever asked for any of your money to keep this going and we plan to keep it that way.
9806916	9812359	You guys being here in chat is enough reward for us and is the motivation we need to keep doing this show every week for free.
9813279	9815320	Power to the independents, my friends.
9816001	9821743	However, I would love... You'll take money if people want to give it to you.
9822284	9836471	But we're not... Contributions from our listeners, not in the financial sense, but in a little short paragraph sent to the mailbag and title it, Oh Well, Our Memories.
9838532	9839852	Letting me know what you remember of the show.
9839892	9841093	What's your strongest memory of the show?
9842017	9844739	All we ever ask, tell a friend about the show.
9845860	9852765	We do it for free for you guys and to help grow the family and hear from more intelligent gamers like the ones we have in chat every week.
9854526	9860891	Say something on a forum, tell your friends on Facebook, share a tweet, leave a nice five-star review on a website.
9860911	9861611	That's all we ask.
9861671	9864313	Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio and we'll keep doing this.
9865274	9872322	as long as we can from this office, also known as the kitchen of my place.
9872362	9876426	Well, you know, you're not really a professional podcaster unless you have an office.
9876526	9876946	Clearly.
9877107	9882392	And I love the fancy sets that they took pictures in with, like, the fancy bar and the cocktails.
9882452	9883273	Nope, nope, nope.
9883914	9884474	Take the high road.
9884675	9884995	We're done.
9886036	9886777	He said cock.
9888775	9890596	I guess we're incapable of taking the high road.
9890696	9892137	I am incapable of taking the high road.
9892177	9892457	Come on.
9892737	9894338	Hello, my name is Matt.
9894398	9895398	Have you just met me?
9897259	9897980	The high road.
9898460	9900861	But I am serious.
9900901	9904863	The day I take the high road, that is time to mention that in the wiki.
9906084	9908105	The high road probably involves hallucinogenics.
9910526	9911827	I would say, though, I am serious.
9911847	9915489	I would like to receive emails from our listeners with their favorite OLR memory.
9915785	9918488	We are coming up on the 10 year anniversary so it would be great.
9918868	9919769	Yeah, it's necessary.
9920089	9922572	There is a total love fest going on in chat right now.
9922612	9925194	Just a less than three shower happening right now.
9925615	9925915	Love it.
9926395	9927316	Less than three you guys.
9927356	9928017	Have a great week.
9928457	9929178	Don't be a dick.
9929498	9930479	Be nice to each other.
9931200	9934323	Do some good and we'll see you next week to do it all again.
9934523	9935544	Have a great night.
