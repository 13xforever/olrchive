0	19880	Tonight, February 26, 2012, Sony pulls an app from the Vita just days after release,
19880	24720	Pokemon has new sequels announced, and big companies team up for a portable console game
24720	31960	collaboration.
31960	35480	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
35480	39680	where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
39680	46100	We are live right now, Sunday, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf
46100	49800	show at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
49800	54120	It is February 26, episode 447.
54120	57880	I'll be joining over the next few hours, my name is Rob Roberts, with my co-hosts, say
57880	60560	hello to Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers.
60560	61560	Hi.
61560	62560	How are you?
62560	63560	I'm alright.
63560	64560	You alright?
64560	65560	Just alright?
65560	66560	Yeah, it's been trying.
66560	67560	But you had salad.
67560	68640	Salad makes it all better.
68640	73400	I did, but I just put balsamic vinegar in, not the kind of dressing I wanted, so it didn't
73400	75440	turn out all that great and I'm feeling kind of sick now.
75440	76440	Aww.
76440	77440	Well, I hope the show can cheer you up.
77440	80760	We're going to have a fun few hours tonight talking about video games and stuff, with
80760	84400	of course our other co-hosts, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.
84400	85400	Hello.
85400	86400	How are you, Loki?
86400	87400	I'm fine.
87400	90480	Alright, starting it off tonight, a popular game we like to play for the show is, what
90480	91920	did Loki bring to dinner tonight?
91920	94080	So, Loki, what did you bring to dinner for the show tonight?
94080	98240	I brought Taco Bell, but I actually wasn't that hungry, I didn't finish it.
98240	102360	Now, and I asked you this before the show, did you try to win another PlayStation Vita
102360	103360	at Taco Bell?
103360	104360	No.
104360	105360	What made you decide to go to Taco Bell?
105360	111440	You know, it's funny, because I actually really hate Taco Bell, or at least I used to really
111440	117560	hate Taco Bell, and so I just started eating Taco Bell, because I guess I'm less picky
117560	124440	on what I'm eating now, so I got the steak quesadilla, which is hardly steak, but it's
124440	125440	a quesadilla.
125440	128760	Alright, look, I don't need the entire play-by-play.
128760	130960	And two crunchy tacos.
130960	135560	The reason why I'm kind of bringing this up is because I remember just before the show
135560	140360	I was reading about that Taco Bell is in a lot of trouble over this Vita promotion, like,
140360	144280	what is this, a bunch of people got an email that said they won, so imagine this, you get
144280	147680	an email that says, you just won a frickin' PlayStation Vita.
147680	148680	Not quite an email.
148680	150000	Here's what basically happened.
150000	157200	They put their codes into a website, and it says, congratulations, you've won a Vita upon
157200	160280	verification and blah blah blah.
160280	165400	But at the same time, they say first off that someone hacked their site, and so for a while
165400	168940	it was showing that to everybody, regardless if you're a winner or not.
168940	171200	And then they said, oh, well someone gamed the system.
171200	175880	Well apparently someone, the reason they think, well, the reason that someone could game the
175880	178560	system was the code was a 12-digit code.
178560	183240	Only the last four numbers actually changed each time, so it's pretty easy to figure out
183240	187920	every single, you know, to at least run down a list to see which codes would work or not.
187920	192720	And then there's also ways to directly link to the winning page and stuff like that.
192720	193720	Wow.
193720	201800	So, okay, so the company that's marketing this for Taco Bell is, you know, terrible
201800	202800	apparently.
202800	203800	Fired.
203800	204800	Well, yeah, among other things.
204800	207680	Well, now there's room, they have a whole Facebook page.
207680	210460	I was reading through that, because, you know, I love drama, so I was reading through their
210460	213800	Facebook page and all these, you know, very angry people, which, you know, I can imagine
213800	214800	especially.
214800	221480	I mean, I understand someone may have gamed the game, but I think, I think there legitimately
221480	226560	is probably a lot of people that did actually win that are getting screwed by this.
226560	227560	Yeah.
227560	231600	So, you know, now they're talking about class-action lawsuit, and that good old lawyer from right
231600	237280	here in Sacramento where OLR's headquartered that, I don't, who did, he suits, he was buying
237280	238280	some other big lawsuit.
238280	243880	I don't remember if it was Taco Bell before or Sony, might have been the Sony class-action
243880	244880	thing.
244880	248680	I don't know, but I didn't, I didn't, I didn't do all my research, because this literally
248680	249680	came up before the show.
249680	252840	They had, they had something else on the local news that was like one of those call Curtis
252840	255680	or something like that, you know, the consumer help thing.
255680	258440	Investigative reports, consumer watchdog, please watch our news broadcast.
258440	259440	Yeah, something like that.
259440	265080	And they were checking stuff out, but, you know, I think honestly for anybody that got
265080	272800	that page, you know, it says upon verification, now if you have the winning code, I mean,
272800	279000	unless, I mean, unless they actually come out, okay, here's the list of code numbers
279000	283560	that were winning codes, you know, which that's not gonna come out unless, you know, there's
283560	289720	some investigation stuff done during the whole court process, but, you know, how are you
289720	292040	gonna be able to prove that you have a winning code?
292040	293040	You can't.
293040	295920	I mean, because it's up to Taco Bell to say, nope, no, you didn't.
295920	299400	Yeah, I know you saw that, but it was upon verification, and we verified your code is
299400	302180	not, not a winning code.
302180	307400	But apparently also, I guess, the website shows, like, who's won, like, each time there's
307400	310120	a winner, and it hasn't updated for a long time.
310120	312760	Well, now, because the thing is broken, who knows?
312760	313760	I don't know.
313760	315840	It's all messed up.
315840	316840	As very messed up.
316840	320680	So it's gonna be interesting to see the legal things that come out of this or what the promotion
320680	322720	company behind this whole thing is gonna have to do.
322720	323720	We'll see.
323720	327720	If anything, they might try, they'll probably try to sweep it under the rug, but we'll see.
327720	328720	All right.
328720	333160	Anyhow, I want to give a shout out to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, where
333160	336840	folks talk live with us, as we do tape, of course, every Sunday night.
336840	337840	Chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
337840	341880	I'll let Acidic Vampire start us off tonight, and chat says, hello, people.
341880	342880	Fuck the Oscars.
342880	348200	Because, yes, it is Sunday, and inevitably, there's always freaking something on TV on
348200	353160	Sundays, whether it be the Grammys or the Tonys, and tonight it's the Oscars, which
353160	355360	is kind of a big deal for some people.
355360	356760	We need the Buddies.
356760	357760	The Buddies?
357760	363480	Yeah, we have the, you know, just, like, a complete, this is what we think of your award
363480	364480	show.
364480	365480	It's butt.
365480	369000	Next year, we need to have the Schmoskers, where we do some type of, you know, video
369000	372520	game-related Oscar thing on the show, but that would require planning.
372520	377880	Plus, I'm a bigger fan of the Razzies, which talks about the worst in cinema, which they've
377880	379220	changed their schedule now.
379220	382720	They used to give out the awards the day before the Oscar, but now they give the nominations
382720	386840	the day before the Oscars, and the ceremony's gonna be on April Fool's Day.
386840	390120	Guess who got 11 nominations at the Razzies this year?
390120	394160	For worst, like, worst actor, worst producer, worst film, worst everything.
394160	398080	Um, let me think.
398080	399080	Justin Bieber?
399080	400160	No, not Justin Bieber.
400160	405280	Twilight was nominated for worst picture, but Adam Sandler got nominated for, like,
405280	410360	for like three different movies, and that Jack and Jill, he's nominated for worst actor.
410360	411360	That's a winner right there.
411360	412580	There you go.
412580	413720	That is a winner.
413720	415840	That's a winning loser right there.
415840	416840	That's the biggest loser.
416840	421840	And, hey, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and predict another possible winning, well,
421840	426920	it's definitely gonna be a winner coming soon from Adam Sandler as well, Candyland.
426920	432040	Is that, oh god, is that the whole, like, Battleship, and all these board games, apparently
432040	433680	Clue's gonna get another movie?
433680	434680	Hasbro, yeah.
434680	436680	He's doing Candyland?
436680	441520	Oh, that's kind of disturbing, like, ugh, I need bleach.
441520	444160	Alright, look, we need to move on, games.
444160	447480	So, before we get into our gaming week, so I guess this might be a little bit about gaming
447480	451720	weeks, but Vita, okay, everybody's got Vita fever this week, because the system officially
451720	456440	launched, so we had a lot of people talking about it last week with the pre-launch, whatever,
456440	460600	now the system officially launched this week, I got my hot little hands on a Vita, and I
460600	463600	think a lot of you out there did, I realize there are some other people that are like,
463600	468120	no one cur, because, you know, there's always gotta be the haters, and then there's of course
468120	472000	a lot of other people that, I think this is where a lot of people fit into, is like, I'll
472000	477440	probably get one when the price comes down, or when XYZ game comes out.
477440	482000	Speaking of the price coming down, let me start off with this, you were pretty angry
482000	487040	on Twitter this week at a story about the price coming down, this whole games analysts
487040	490840	are analyzing the system two days after it launches, what was this all about?
490840	498640	Well, they were like going, oh, it's not selling well, or like, oh, it hasn't sold that many
498640	501960	copies, I don't even know where they're getting data yet, I don't even think they have data,
501960	506560	and now obviously they were looking at Japan, but that doesn't mean anything, I mean, if
506560	512280	you're basing our information off of what goes on in Japan, then the Xbox 360 is doomed,
512280	517440	because it just doesn't sell well in Japan, but yeah, they're already saying, oh, it needs,
517440	523920	the price drop needs to happen now, it's like, dude, it just came out, like, how are you
523920	530720	even, how are you coming to this conclusion of what its sales are yet, I mean, it just
530720	537200	came out, you're going to get day one sales and that's it, I mean, look at the 3DS, if
537200	540920	you're going to look at the 3DS, you know, day one sales or whatever, I'm sure they were
540920	541920	terrible.
541920	547000	Well, it also seems like the Vita, you know, I'm really trying to be impartial here and
547000	550600	not sound like a Sony fanboy, but I got to be honest, the Vita seems to have a better
550600	555440	launch projection over the next few months than the 3DS had, it seems like they've got
555440	560160	some big titles evenly spaced out to keep it interesting, like what, little big planets
560160	566120	next month, that's going to be a big deal, resistance in a few months, the frickin' Capcom
566120	570640	cross Tekken's got what, 12 people on the Vita, which is ridiculous to me, excuse me,
570640	573860	what did I say, Street Fighter cross Tekken, what did I say, Capcom cross, well, that's
573860	577460	more accurate, look at the characters, they just, they already used the Capcom cross Namco
577460	584440	thing or Namcom cross, Namcom, alright fine, it's Namcom, the Namcom game comes out, I
584440	588420	have problems, the Namcom game comes out this coming month, I mean, the Vita's got a lot
588420	593560	of stuff coming for it, whereas the 3DS was hurtin', I mean, there was really, I mean,
593560	600360	their biggest launch title was what, the Street Fighter 4, the Street Fighter, sadly Ridge
600360	606720	Racer was pretty good, it was actually, I think it was a pretty good 3DS game, no it
606720	611560	was, it was just funny the way you phrased that, sadly Ridge Racer, well, I mean, Ridge
611560	618680	Racer, to be honest, it doesn't change, I mean, it hasn't changed in a long time, so
618680	622640	yeah, I mean, they've got a lot of, and the Vita titles, I mean, there was like a good
622640	630360	30 Vita titles at launch, that's a lot, I mean, and there's still, there's some crap,
630360	634640	but there's some, like little deviants, well, but there's some really good stuff too, you
634640	640920	know, like one game I wanna talk about, Luminous, which is hotness, let me put it this way,
640920	644480	I am a huge whore for all things Q Entertainment, and I've been that way on this show for a
644480	650000	long, long time, you know, Luminous, Meteos, Gun Pay, every extend, you know, all their
650000	656040	games, I freakin' defended 99 Nights on this show, it's not that bad, it's not that bad,
656040	663080	alright, but, I don't wanna talk about that, alright, but Luminous, like, I bought the
663080	666320	original Luminous, I bought Luminous 2, I bought Luminous on Xbox, I bought Luminous
666320	669800	on Steam, so yes, of course I bought this new Luminous game, and I'll tell you what,
669800	675280	it really is the best freakin' one yet, and I'm amazed to say that, because I will say,
675280	678280	Luminous has had its weak points, I don't think that Xbox Live version of Luminous was
678280	683380	very good, because there was so much they promised for that that never happened, where
683380	686600	is my Madonna in Luminous, when's that gonna happen?
686600	693120	Hey, real quick, just like, you know, kind of a thought here, wouldn't it be awesome
693120	698600	if they port Child of Eden to the Vita, touch screen, aiming and everything?
698600	703700	Even Rez, heck yeah, like a combo pack would be pretty amazing, but anyway, don't get me
703700	708520	excited, Logie, but like, no, this Luminous game is so good, like, I can't, like, it is
708520	714000	this generation's Tetris, it is that freakin' good, like, but, you know, again, I'm fully
714000	719840	admitting, I also just, I have been in love with almost everything Tetsuya Mizuguchi's
719840	724000	ever done, you know, all the way back to like Space Channel 5 and all that, so, you know,
724000	728440	of course there's the built-in love for this game, but it's really hot on the Vita, it's
728440	732600	shows off a lot of the functionality without being ridiculous, like, you can use the back
732600	737140	touch pad, but you don't have to, you can use touch controls, but you don't have to,
737140	739920	you know, there's a lot of good stuff to it, and I like the way it ties into the internet
739920	743640	with the big block, although there's some serious balancing issues with the XP, but
743640	751360	whatever, and the song list is so good, it is so good, like, I know, Logie and I had
751360	754400	a talk on Bobby's show about this, yeah, I know he doesn't agree with me totally, but
754400	760800	I think the song list is, because it's recognizable enough without them having to have shilled
760800	764920	out all this money for AAA licenses like they did with Luminous 2, because like Luminous
764920	769560	2 had Missy Elliott and Beck and Gwen Stefani, which some of it seemed really oddly out of
769560	775040	place, but this song is that perfect match of, oh, hey, this is a song by Faithless,
775040	778520	I think I heard them before, oh, Goldfrapp, they're pretty cool, here's a song, you know,
778520	782560	like, there's just enough, and it's not usually their biggest hit, that's the other thing
782560	787040	I'm noticing, there's a Benny Benassi song in it, but it's not Satisfaction, you know,
787040	791800	there's a Beloved song in it, but it's not Sweet Harmony, it's a really neat way they
791800	796240	kind of came up with that song list, and so, and the skins are gorgeous, the original tracks
796240	801000	they've mixed in are good too, love, love, love, love, it's an early contender for my
801000	805680	game of the year, honestly and truly, but again, I knew I was gonna like this game.
805680	807160	Is it your game of February?
807160	809680	Is my, is totally my game of February, absolutely.
809680	812000	Well, I played yours.
812000	813520	Yes.
813520	821720	And my review for the Vita is, oh, my hand, because of how high up the buttons are on
821720	825560	the right side, because again, I had hand surgery, it's holding my hand in that position,
825560	830920	it actually kind of hurt, I tried using the touch screen for Luminous, which was actually
830920	838520	a little hard, but it was really pretty, except I got really annoyed at some of the color
838520	842520	change, but you don't even realize when the color's changed until you're like five blocks
842520	844200	in, oh my god, the color's different.
844200	848120	Yeah, the transition effect is much different than it was in the other Luminous games.
848120	851440	Going to our chat room, Black Wolf in our chat room says Luminous was awesome when I
851440	855960	plugged in my heavy duty podcasting headphones, I gotta try that at some point, oh, sounds
855960	857440	awesome.
857440	863040	Let's see, let's go to another question here from Frisbee, is the Vita worth the money?
863040	866280	That's an excellent question that I don't think I can answer with a definitive yes or
866280	867280	no.
867280	873640	For me, yes, but I like to be on the cutting edge of this type of technology, now, my Vita
873640	878320	experience has not been without problems, the Katamari game, which is the other game
878320	882780	I picked up at launch, besides Luminous, froze my system the other night, like I'm talking
882780	887480	it so bad, where it would not wake up out of sleep mode, I tried to hold down the power
887480	891160	button, here's a tip, if you get into this problem, put it into a coma, yeah, it did,
891160	894960	if you hold down, I mean, the Katamari broke it or rolled it up, I don't know, but you
894960	900000	hold down the power button for about 10 seconds, and you'll get a menu kind of akin to what
900000	903960	happens when you hold down one of the function keys when you start Windows, where you can
903960	909080	do like a hard reset of the Vita, you can reset all your settings, I tried to do a hard
909080	913720	reset, nothing happened, I ended up erasing all my settings, nothing happened, and I'm
913720	920160	like holy shit, I have a Luminous, I have a Vita that I'm using to play a lot of Luminous
920160	929720	break after 24 hours, but finally I just ejected the cartridge of Katamari, woke right up,
929720	933920	and I had to reset everything, and I was so mad that I'd done that, so if your Vita will
933920	938840	not wake up, eject the cartridge first thing, you think it's basic troubleshooting 101,
938840	942320	so in other words my point is the Vita is not without its problems, especially for this
942320	946200	early adoption, but what have we said for years and years and years on this program
946200	950040	is the golden rule of gaming, Dark Soccer, please remind the listeners, a system is only
950040	951480	as good as the games that are on it.
951480	952480	Thank you.
952480	953480	Trademark.
953480	957040	If there is a game on the Vita, or several games on the Vita that you have to have right
957040	959000	now, yes, get one.
959000	963560	If you're a big Luminous whore like me, you're not going to be disappointed.
963560	968520	If you want to get this new Katamari game, Uncharted, it's not a Naughty Dog Uncharted,
968520	973480	but I'm hearing it's okay except for the fact that they've really shoved all the touch stuff
973480	974660	into it.
974660	979900	If you want Marvel vs. Capcom 3 on the go, you can't get that on the 3DS right now, then
979900	984440	yeah, there might be something here worth your money, but if you don't think there's
984440	988200	something in it for you right now, don't spend the money.
988200	990920	It's really hard to kind of put a price tag on that.
990920	998800	I bought a 3DS when they were still $249, I don't regret that decision, but it was kind
998800	1000440	of a weak launch lineup.
1000440	1007540	Honestly, I like the Vita, but I have the games that I want on my phone, and I'm really
1007540	1011080	wanting an iPad later, because you know what I can do with an iPad?
1011080	1012080	I cayed.
1012080	1015600	Let me go to SSJ100Matt in our chat room.
1015600	1018440	Is the 3G version really worth it?
1018440	1023040	I'll say this, I bought a 3G Vita, and I'm going to answer that with a no.
1023040	1027640	I kind of think I shouldn't have done that, and I know some of you tried to call me out
1027640	1031660	on it last week, and I will admit after getting my hands on it and using it, it was a mistake,
1031660	1039020	and I would say they really pushed it with advertising that Super Stardust Delta or whatever
1039020	1043280	is an included game, because it's kind of BS, the hurdles you have to jump around to
1043280	1047300	get that, and that's part of the reason I just went for the 3G, because I'm like, with
1047300	1052240	all this value, what, I'm paying $10 for 3G, okay, I might use that someday, I'll go ahead
1052240	1053240	and buy it.
1053240	1055480	I'm having a little bit of buyer's remorse on that.
1055480	1060520	However, this is very important, I have an iPhone.
1060520	1067360	If I didn't have the iPhone, I could see a lot more use in the 3G, so that would be my
1067360	1071320	suggestion for you is that if you don't have some type of, and I realize some of you are
1071320	1076240	Android folks too, if you don't have some type of smart device where you can get the
1076240	1080920	web anywhere, then you might want to look into 3G for the Vita, I think it would be
1080920	1085200	a good thing, because the web browser's pretty nice, I got to say, but if you already have
1085200	1091240	a 3G device that you're paying for, I don't, the games don't play over 3G.
1091240	1096380	The 3G is for stuff like Nier, it's for downloading patches, that's it.
1096380	1098720	Don't expect to play head to head over 3G.
1098720	1101080	It would be kind of a bad experience anyway.
1101080	1105160	Yes, 3G is a lot slower than most people realize.
1105160	1111280	Yeah, I don't think I would ever use 3G service that much, but here's the way I look at it.
1111280	1117320	With a 3G one, you get an 8 gig memory card with it, and sure, yeah, you can buy that
1117320	1121840	separately and you may save some money, but at the same time, it's nice to have the option
1121840	1126880	that if later on you wanted to use 3G, you can, or if you are paying for 3G, say for
1126880	1131120	example for an iPad, you can literally pop that SIM card out of your iPad, pop it into
1131120	1133440	your Vita, and oh look, it works.
1133440	1134440	Nice tip.
1134440	1139680	Yes, and you don't have to worry about paying extra money for it, and who knows what kind
1139680	1142160	of exploits and stuff they'll have for that type of stuff later on.
1142160	1145760	I want to give you another really good tip on the Vita, and that is remote play.
1145760	1150640	Now remote play already existed on the PSP, but now that you're seeing it on the Vita,
1150640	1155360	I really feel like I'm looking at the Wii U technology already with this Vita and the
1155360	1159920	remote play, because over remote play, I can turn on my PlayStation 3 when I'm lying in
1159920	1165240	my bed with the Vita, I can turn on the PlayStation 3, go in there, I can play the PS1 games.
1165240	1170600	Because right now you can't download a PS1 game to your Vita, you can't, like they don't
1170600	1174680	have that functionality in there yet, I'm assuming they're going to add it, but what
1174680	1179600	you can do is if the games are on your PlayStation 3, you fire up remote play, and you can stream
1179600	1184200	it, and it's like what they're advertising on the Wii U, you're getting the little game
1184200	1185200	in there.
1185200	1189860	Now granted, I have several games, and I don't think Umjama Lamy would be a great idea to
1189860	1193720	play over remote play, because music, game, lag, death, right?
1193720	1200560	Final Fantasy 5, or something that, you know, the lag isn't going to be a big deal, is great.
1200560	1203360	And I love the fact, and one of the things I was hoping that they would do, and they
1203360	1208660	actually did, was mapping the extra buttons, and before with the PlayStation Portable,
1208660	1214360	you had your L2, R2, and stuff mapped to one of the analogs, which is really dumb, and
1214360	1218400	they have it still where you can do that, where you can hold select and then push a
1218400	1223120	directional button or something like that, and it does one of those, or you can actually
1223120	1227280	map it to your back touchpad, which is fantastic.
1227280	1228280	It's great.
1228280	1233160	Your L2, R2, and L3, R3 are on there, so it's great.
1233160	1237120	I will put it this way though, I'm going to be really looking at that Wii U price point
1237120	1243480	even closer now, because we can see that the technology is absolutely possible, absolutely
1243480	1249280	possible, with a $200 PlayStation 3, and what is right now a $250 Vita.
1249280	1254880	That's $450 for this technology, and I got to say, this Vita, probably a lot better than
1254880	1257120	that tablet controller that Wii U is coming with.
1257120	1264280	So there is no possible way, there is no possible, possible way that Wii U can get away with
1264280	1268640	charging $450, and I would argue, there is no way that Wii U can get away with charging
1268640	1269640	$400.
1269640	1274000	And in fact, I think the bar needs to go even lower.
1274000	1277440	And if they try to blame the technology, absolute utter total bullshit.
1277440	1280060	We're looking at it right now with the Vita and the PlayStation 3.
1280060	1283320	The Nintendo, if they want to win with the Wii U, they've got to be able to deliver this
1283320	1287080	technology cheaper, and they've got to integrate it a little bit better, because right now
1287080	1290560	there is no, you know, besides what I just mentioned, there's not a whole lot to do with
1290560	1291700	remote play.
1291700	1296020	But then again, it just came out, like, you know, a couple days ago.
1296020	1299780	That's true, and Sony is very good at adding features.
1299780	1300780	And I got to say-
1300780	1303280	They saved the PS3 through some of that.
1303280	1307040	You know, what can I say, you know, out of the box, I have a web browser.
1307040	1311620	I didn't have to wait months for a patch to unlock the web browser function, which that
1311620	1313620	web browser was terrible in the 3DS.
1313620	1317580	But the Vita, but we have to be fair, and the Vita is missing some things it should
1317580	1318580	have.
1318580	1321560	Like, the whole fact that it doesn't play PS1 games right now when the PSP did it, that's
1321560	1324240	a little like, what, what?
1324240	1328360	I mean, you can do it through remote play, but it's a little weird that that's not there.
1328360	1332560	They probably haven't built a new, they probably haven't built a new emulator for it, and they
1332560	1337020	could probably do it emulating the PSP, emulating the PlayStation 1, which would be weird.
1337020	1341200	But they probably want to see if they can improve upon it, make it, you know, hey, look,
1341200	1344700	the graphics look nicer, or something like that.
1344700	1348200	So anyhow, I'll talk a little more about Vita games when we get to my gaming week.
1348200	1351560	I want to go around, we always start off the show with how was your gaming week, I guess
1351560	1353480	we've kind of already been doing that.
1353480	1355240	But maybe there's stuff not on the Vita.
1355240	1356600	We'll start with Dark Sakura.
1356600	1358880	Well, I played well.
1358880	1359880	Addict.
1359880	1360880	Dealer.
1360880	1366320	And I made a new friend, so I'd like to give a shout out to Renee, who I asked to listen
1366320	1367320	to tonight.
1367320	1368320	Hi, Renee.
1368320	1369320	Hi.
1369320	1376960	Um, I, uh, I was gonna play some Portal 2, I played a lot of Being Pissed Off.
1376960	1380680	So like, this is the problem I had, you know how, like, you have 50 million channels and
1380680	1382240	nothing's on?
1382240	1387920	I was looking at the collection, because we had some Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3, which
1387920	1392680	mostly was Dan playing and screaming at the TV, because Galactus, even on Super Easy,
1392680	1393680	is a cheap bitch.
1393680	1399240	So, um, but I was looking at all, at the games, and I was like, I don't want to play this,
1399240	1401720	I don't want to play this, I don't want to play this, I don't want to play this.
1401720	1403680	Where is Blue Dragon?
1403680	1407480	And I could not find Blue Dragon, and I was mad, and I wanted to...
1407480	1408480	Do you want to borrow mine?
1408480	1410480	I have the game.
1410480	1411480	Okay.
1411480	1412480	So then I was like...
1412480	1415100	Haven't touched mine in two years, Steve.
1415100	1418560	So then I was like, I'm gonna play BlazBlue.
1418560	1419560	What?
1419560	1420560	It's not open?
1420560	1424960	Crap, because I don't like to open things that, you know, aren't already open.
1424960	1427680	So then I was like, I'm gonna play Jumping Flash.
1427680	1431720	And I could not find Jumping Flash, even though it was probably right in front of me.
1431720	1434320	So I was like, I'm just not gonna play anything, and I took a nap.
1434320	1437600	I'm just surprised that you couldn't see those old PlayStation 1 cases, they were the size
1437600	1439120	of, like, a small house.
1439120	1445280	We have them in the back room, and keep in mind, we have the cases that size also encompass
1445280	1452320	our Sega Saturn collection, encompass the Sega CD collection, and we have a bunch of
1452320	1453320	early PS1 games.
1453320	1456920	You gotta take me back to this whole, why you didn't want to open BlazBlue, though.
1456920	1460320	I'm not sure I get that, because you guys bought it, so why not open it?
1460320	1462200	You can't take it back to Walmart at this point, can you?
1462200	1466840	No, just because I was like, that means I have to open it, and then I'll have to, you
1466840	1467840	know, try to...
1467840	1468840	Oh, that evil Shrinkrap.
1468840	1471680	Yeah, I was like, I don't want to open this.
1471680	1473680	It is pretty tough.
1473680	1477560	And then it's gonna get staticky and stick to my hand, and I was like, I don't want to.
1477560	1480800	That is the ultimate laziest thing I've ever heard in my entire life.
1480800	1481800	Shut up.
1481800	1482800	Congratulations.
1482800	1483920	You know, I finally opened my copy of...
1483920	1488840	Because it ended with, and then I took a nap.
1488840	1494520	The Shrinkrap monster proved too difficult that I went to go take a nap.
1494520	1495960	I'm just calling it like I see it.
1495960	1497640	You know I love you, but damn you lazy.
1497640	1499120	Rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub,
1499120	1500120	rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub.
1500120	1501120	I was tired anyways to bite me.
1501120	1504520	But, oh God, what else was it that I was...
1504520	1508640	It was like I wanted to play certain things and I couldn't find them and I was frustrated.
1508640	1510560	So then I was gonna play Project Diva.
1510560	1517360	No, no, no, no, there's more, because remember I was loaned by one of our lovely listeners,
1517360	1518360	Project Diva.
1518360	1519520	Oh, right, right, right.
1519520	1522280	And I could not find our PSP charger.
1522280	1525520	I tore up everything and Dan's like, oh, it's in the bin.
1525520	1527920	Actually, I think it's at my mom's house.
1527920	1530120	Would you like to borrow our PSP charger?
1530120	1534880	Because I have one of these now, so I don't know when I'll be using the PSP again.
1534880	1535880	Sure.
1535880	1538440	Or are you gonna take a nap instead?
1538440	1539440	You know what?
1539440	1546000	I had a really bad day, but I also downloaded a new game on my iPhone, but I haven't tried
1546000	1547000	it yet.
1547000	1548000	I downloaded it on Name Alone.
1548000	1550000	It's called Star Mine.
1550000	1552360	Oh, like the old Bimani story game.
1552360	1553360	Yeah, some puzzle game.
1553360	1555960	I also did play Castlevania the Puzzle.
1555960	1557920	Freaking sucks on the iPhone.
1557920	1561560	You cannot, it's like, oh, we're gonna show both of the screens at the same time.
1561560	1565320	No, it doesn't work because you have to move it with your fingers and the little blocks
1565320	1569480	are too small and then, oh, sorry, you're just gonna drop the ball.
1569480	1571040	You know the only good thing about that?
1571040	1572040	The music.
1572040	1573640	That's it.
1573640	1578040	And you know, Dracula being a pimp.
1578040	1582120	Techness in our chatroom at chat.orangesondready.com says about your story, sounds like a great
1582120	1584060	first world problem, ma'am.
1584060	1592160	You know, I would like to see an F.U. comic on Jamie's story.
1592160	1593440	That's not shrink wrap.
1593440	1594440	F.U.
1594440	1597200	Actually, you know how my brain translates that?
1597200	1602380	I hear it phonetically.
1602380	1603740	That's how my brain translates that.
1603740	1605760	You sound like a scary monster.
1605760	1607760	Don't do that.
1607760	1612080	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1612080	1616680	I played some of the beta stuff, basically.
1616680	1618800	Call of Duty, more of that.
1618800	1625360	We got a sixth person in on our games now, so it's more than merry, you know?
1625360	1627600	I played more Luminous.
1627600	1632680	Although, see, during the week, there was more rumors that some of those demos might
1632680	1636200	have been full games, so I had to clear some space off.
1636200	1642760	And I accidentally, well, I deleted my, you know how I installed some stuff for each game
1642760	1644480	that you pop in there so you have little icons of?
1644480	1645480	I deleted one of those.
1645480	1649680	Apparently, that also deletes your save for Luminous or whatever, so I deleted my save
1649680	1650680	for Luminous.
1650680	1653680	Apparently, that's because it said, oh, hey, you started playing Luminous for the first
1653680	1654680	time.
1654680	1655680	I'm like, no, I haven't.
1655680	1656680	I've played it before.
1656680	1659940	If you clear your system settings, the same thing happens where it's all, you just played
1659940	1660940	Luminous for the first time.
1660940	1661940	Liar.
1661940	1669680	Even before that, though, I had some weird stuff where it wouldn't get any XP for the
1669680	1673960	stuff that I did, so that was a little funky.
1673960	1678840	And then, see, played more Rayman Origins, which is pretty fun, but I don't know.
1678840	1682500	I don't have the patience to kind of play through that whole game, because I'm busy
1682500	1684840	with a bunch of other stuff right now.
1684840	1690760	But it looks fun, and I had fun with it for the little bit that I played it.
1690760	1695440	Kind of myself, the completionists on that stuff have to go back and finish all the challenges
1695440	1696440	and everything.
1696440	1699160	They have time challenges, and they've kind of figured out some tricks with that.
1699160	1703400	There's a dash move you can do that makes you move faster, which is kind of cool.
1703400	1711960	And then, and that game still looks really gorgeous, Beat Touch My Katamari, or at least
1711960	1719000	I finished the last level in the game, and I kind of don't want to buy any more Katamari
1719000	1724720	games anymore, because they just all, it's kind of disappointing, because they're not,
1724720	1726920	they're never as good as like the first few games.
1726920	1727920	It's like kind of like-
1727920	1730280	They're whipping that same horse over and over and over again.
1730280	1733560	It's seriously, the last level was kind of terrible.
1733560	1737280	It was kind of like, you know, some of the older games where it's like, okay, you start
1737280	1741600	off really small, and then eventually you're rolling up the continents and like the planets
1741600	1742600	and stuff like that.
1742600	1747320	You know, that was epic, but this was like, okay, and I went to some psycho land that
1747320	1751840	everything's rainbow and I'm starting to roll up some of that stuff, and it was just really
1751840	1756780	weird for a Katamari game even.
1756780	1764320	And then I unlocked some of the Eternal stages for those, which you get candy for that stuff
1764320	1767860	too, so I don't know why you wouldn't do the Eternal stages.
1767860	1775320	So I did those and I bought the King of Cosmos some new clothes, because he wanted some really
1775320	1779880	flamboyant stuff, so I made him even more flamboyant, if that's possible.
1779880	1783560	Yeah, my favorite is that the first thing he asked me for was a bridal cape.
1783560	1785880	Yes, that's the one I got for him, the bridal cape.
1785880	1793000	I'm like, okay, everybody has their thing, I'm not one to judge.
1793000	1795680	Exactly, it was just really weird.
1795680	1800900	So I did that, and then, what else did I play?
1800900	1804280	I didn't play Little Deviants yet, because I really don't want to play that game, looks
1804280	1805280	like crap.
1805280	1808680	I actually played some of the Welcome Park stuff and tried to unlock trophies in that.
1808680	1811040	Some of those games are actually kind of hard.
1811040	1815720	The Welcome Park stuff for built-in games is, you know, it's alright.
1815720	1819640	I gotta ask you, did you try some of those AR games?
1819640	1820640	Not yet.
1820640	1823760	I did, and I don't like them.
1823760	1826640	No, seriously, they don't function well at all.
1826640	1833720	And I mean, okay, let's be honest, your apartment, my house and stuff, maybe playing at night
1833720	1837880	with just lights on, not the best lighting for these games.
1837880	1842040	But it kept getting, especially on the soccer, actually almost all the games, I only played
1842040	1844560	the soccer and the fireworks one.
1844560	1847800	And I didn't even really play the soccer game, because I couldn't get it past building the
1847800	1853760	field and going through the motions of how to play the game, because first off, it wouldn't
1853760	1857440	register my movements well, which kind of sucked.
1857440	1862840	And second, I kept getting this out of range error, and I'm not that far away from this
1862840	1863840	stuff.
1863840	1868240	I mean, I may be like three feet away from the actual cards, which I think is pretty
1868240	1871680	reasonable, but it just wasn't working.
1871680	1876400	And then the fireworks one was kind of neat, but the game's kind of dumb.
1876400	1880520	And once again, I was getting the out of range error, even though I could see all the cards
1880520	1884720	through the screen, so I don't know what the issue was there.
1884720	1888720	But I mean, I'm sure it's just some bugs, they'll get worked out.
1888720	1894760	Even in the hands of the games, they're free, so whatever.
1894760	1895760	What else?
1895760	1899760	Oh, I tried the Unit 13 demo, that was actually pretty good, I like that.
1899760	1903200	Not my type of game, really, I'm not really huge into the SOCOM.
1903200	1908200	It's like SOCOM, it's somebody that does Zipper Interactive, it's a third person squad shooter
1908200	1909440	game.
1909440	1910440	And it's okay.
1910440	1911440	Those tend to sell pretty well.
1911440	1913920	Yeah, it's alright, but it's not my...
1913920	1919320	I'm not really into that, you know, Resistance, no, the new Resistance game, I'm definitely
1919320	1925280	gonna be picking up, probably, but this one was not too big for me.
1925280	1929160	Gripper01 in our chatroom says, the Vita needs a decent pinball game.
1929160	1930860	Good call.
1930860	1934320	I don't see why there won't be a pinball FX on it soon enough.
1934320	1935320	That actually reminds me.
1935320	1936320	Huh.
1936320	1938960	I forgot to mention, we sold Lord of the Rings.
1938960	1939960	Oh.
1939960	1941480	Bye, Lord of the Rings.
1941480	1942480	Yep.
1942480	1943480	Just saying.
1943480	1944480	I mean, it just is gone.
1944480	1945480	Thank God.
1945480	1946480	That's right.
1946480	1947480	I mean, I'm tired of that game.
1947480	1949880	Did you take it to Mount Mordor, or is it...
1949880	1951680	No, Sauron came and picked it up.
1951680	1953840	He was really nice, too, very personable guy.
1953840	1958400	What does not simply multi-ball into, Mel?
1958400	1962400	I will say this, if they do put out pinball FX on the Vita, I think that would be a great
1962400	1969280	game for the rear touchpad, to use the blippers, and you could turn it so it's a long screen
1969280	1970280	instead of the wide screen.
1970280	1976240	I mean, you know, those guys that designed pinball FX, they've already done games on
1976240	1979760	wide screen televisions, and they work fine, but imagine with the Vita, you could turn
1979760	1982320	it the other way, and that'd be a pretty kick butt screen.
1982320	1989640	There were some import shooters from Japan that were using the long screen for the PSP
1989640	1992180	back in the day, so I'd be down for that.
1992180	1997400	I really do feel like there's more potential to be unlocked with the Vita, but to be fair,
1997400	2002680	the 3DS has done a pretty good job of unlocking more as we go, too.
2002680	2007600	So it's on now, so there you go.
2007600	2008600	What else for your gaming week?
2008600	2009600	Anything?
2009600	2010600	That was it.
2010600	2014520	All right, well, Loki already mentioned Touch My Katamari, which was another...
2014520	2018120	One thing real quick, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, real quick, just one thing I just wanted
2018120	2021560	to mention that was absent from my gaming week, and that was the new download content
2021560	2025840	for Saints Row the Third, because I am not buying into this bullshit download content
2025840	2028080	crap that they're putting out these really terrible pieces of...
2028080	2029080	Ooh, what happened?
2029080	2030080	It did not good?
2030080	2034840	Well, the last one they put out was really short, and it was $7 for about an hour's worth
2034840	2039640	of content, and it was just kind of like cheap bullshit.
2039640	2040640	So I waited.
2040640	2043960	I waited to hear the reviews on it, and sure enough, someone's like, oh yeah, I beat it
2043960	2044960	in 30 minutes.
2044960	2045960	$7 still.
2045960	2046960	Yes.
2046960	2047960	Fuck that.
2047960	2048960	No, I'm not doing it.
2048960	2049960	That's too bad.
2049960	2051840	Saints Row had a lot going for it when it first came out.
2051840	2053400	They kind of ruined it, so...
2053400	2054400	That's too bad.
2054400	2056800	All right.
2056800	2057800	My gaming week.
2057800	2059280	I also played Touch My Katamari.
2059280	2064920	I feel similarly to where Loki's at, you know, like, oh yeah, I like Katamari, it's a good
2064920	2067600	game, but it's been kind of the same damn game.
2067600	2070480	It's kind of like Sonic the Hedgehog coming out on every platform.
2070480	2076960	You're like, oh, it's Sonic, I used to love this game, and I'm playing it again, and again,
2076960	2081580	I'm playing the same game again, and nothing's changed, and now the nostalgia's worn off,
2081580	2083080	and I think I'm done now.
2083080	2084080	Yeah.
2084080	2087920	I also played Sonic the Hedgehog on PlayStation 3 this week, for real.
2087920	2090080	It was one of the free PlayStation Plus games.
2090080	2095840	PlayStation Plus is having this whole, like, Genesis nostalgia fest thing going on, so
2095840	2099360	whatever, which is weird, because yes, I have the Sonic Mega Genesis collection, so you
2099360	2103360	might be thinking, why are you wasting the space on your hard drive to download it?
2103360	2106000	And my answer is, trophies.
2106000	2108760	I must have trophies.
2108760	2113080	So I tried to unlock some trophies, and one game I will say I unlocked a shit ton of trophies
2113080	2118400	in is Altered Beast, which I also played this week, but RISE FROM YOUR GRAVE.
2118400	2124600	Okay, if there isn't a game that we have seen through thicker rose-colored glasses in our
2124600	2129260	lives, it's Altered Beast, because I'll tell you what, I remember being a kid thinking
2129260	2137640	that game was badass, and it was in the arcade for 25 cents for a few minute thrill, but
2137640	2142120	what they decided to port over on the, you know, PlayStation 3, which granted is the
2142120	2149760	exact same thing they have on Xbox Live Arcade, was the Genesis version, which, at the time,
2149760	2155880	was great, but now it looks a lot like Pac-Man on the Atari 2600.
2155880	2163200	I mean, it is, it's bad, it's a bad game, and some of the horrible noises it was making
2163200	2169360	made me think my PlayStation 3 was about to spontaneously combust, and I asked you, have
2169360	2175200	any of you actually played Altered Beast to Stage 5 all the way to the last stage of the
2175200	2176200	game?
2176200	2177200	Yes.
2177200	2184080	What in the fuck are those unicorn tranny monsters that beat me with their high heels?
2184080	2189720	I was like, what is this, I can't even, because like most people, let's be real, we remember
2189720	2194640	Altered Beast to Stage 2 before we ran out of quarters.
2194640	2200840	So you're saying unicorn tranny monsters, they're Altered Beasts.
2200840	2208360	Look, I'm just, before you send in the hate mail and say, no, no, no, no.
2208360	2210680	I'm finding pictures of them for everybody.
2210680	2216760	I'm telling you, these unicorn monsters are, are, are a little funky, like it's just, what
2216760	2217760	is this?
2217760	2218760	Who designed this?
2218760	2219760	I can't even.
2219760	2224400	So yeah, I played Altered Beast all the way to the end, got my trophy, then promptly
2224400	2229240	deleted it from my hard drive because damn, that's a bad game.
2229240	2236800	Um, otherwise, more wow, more Final Fantasy 13 tube and trying to get a little further
2236800	2237800	in that.
2237800	2239240	And that's about the extent of my week.
2239240	2240240	I mean, I did have the Vita.
2240240	2242920	I literally played Luminous, like nothing but Luminous one night.
2242920	2246380	I thought Stage 5 was the Rhino monsters.
2246380	2250040	Is there a stage missing in the Genesis version?
2250040	2256280	It's the hell level and you turn into the exact same monster you were in level one.
2256280	2262600	So Tigerclaw in our chatroom at chat.orangelandtranny.com says Altered Beast is in need of a serious
2262600	2263600	reboot.
2263600	2265320	I'd be down with that.
2265320	2266600	A serious reboot.
2266600	2267600	Yes.
2267600	2270920	I mean, there's some pretty cool concepts in Altered Beast, but those levels became
2270920	2273040	laughably easy once you became the Beast.
2273040	2274120	It's just kind of getting there.
2274120	2276480	It can be a pain in the ass sometimes.
2276480	2281020	So all right, anyhow, that's it for my gaming week.
2281020	2283600	So let's talk about housekeeping.
2283600	2287080	Join us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, or you can join us on Twitter
2287080	2288080	as well.
2288080	2289080	Twitter.com slash O.L.R.
2289080	2291320	Get in your tweets for tonight's show.
2291320	2295720	Um, as far as I can tell, we don't have any shows off planned in the next few weeks.
2295720	2298680	So O.L.R. every Sunday for a little while.
2298680	2302560	Let's get into some gaming news and what is going on in the gaming world this week.
2302560	2304040	Loki's going to start it off.
2304040	2305040	Yes.
2305040	2310760	So I'm going to start off by talking about, um, one of the, what was it, what project
2310760	2311760	did they call that?
2311760	2316680	It was, uh, no, not downpour.
2316680	2319400	That whole like campaign to get those really awesome.
2319400	2320400	Operation rainfall.
2320400	2321400	That's right.
2321400	2325760	I was thinking downpour, project downpour, that downpour would be the new Silent Hill
2325760	2326760	title.
2326760	2327760	Uh, yes.
2327760	2328760	Operation rainfall.
2328760	2336280	Um, so the last story has been confirmed to be coming to North America in 2012, well,
2336280	2343940	summer 2012, well, June 19th, 2012, um, and it's actually, it's kind of cool.
2343940	2348360	It's not going to be one of those, oh, you have to buy the GameStop directly from Nintendo.
2348360	2352360	It's actually being ported over by XSeed, um, which is probably going to have the easiest
2352360	2358580	localization job ever because it's going to be going from English to English.
2358580	2362360	So that's just money handed right to them basically.
2362360	2370540	Um, so yeah, that'll be coming out later this year and is a pretty epic RPG from Mistwalker.
2370540	2371960	We have a date for that?
2371960	2375600	Well, they're saying summer 2012.
2375600	2379240	What I've seen from XSeed is June 19th, 2012.
2379240	2380800	That would be summer.
2380800	2381800	That would be summer.
2381800	2383900	And just in time for my birthday, yay!
2383900	2388760	So I mean, dates can change, um, but June 19th.
2388760	2391440	Downpour, by the way, was a Silent Hill game.
2391440	2392920	I think you got confused there, Rain.
2392920	2396720	No, I said downpour is the next Silent Hill game that's coming out.
2396720	2397720	Just looking at the chatroom.
2397720	2399960	Alan Wake's Silent Hill-ish game.
2399960	2400960	Yeah, exactly.
2400960	2401960	Alan Hill.
2401960	2402960	All right.
2402960	2403960	Um, hey, what now?
2403960	2404960	Are you at all interested?
2404960	2405960	I found the picture, by the way.
2405960	2406960	Silent Hill game.
2406960	2410480	Oh, let me see this scary, hold on, we'll come back to that.
2410480	2412000	Yes.
2412000	2413400	What are those things?
2413400	2414400	Chain it to me.
2414400	2415400	Uh.
2415400	2416400	I have no idea.
2416400	2417400	They're trainicorns.
2417400	2420640	Get that on the Tumblr so the podcast listeners can refer to this.
2420640	2422320	I'll give it to Ron Med to do it.
2422320	2423320	Thank you.
2423320	2426360	Because I want the podcasters, er, podcast-y listeners to be able to see this too if they're
2426360	2427360	not live.
2427360	2428720	Anyhow, where were we?
2428720	2432360	Vita, Silent Hill, I didn't know there was an exclusive Silent Hill game on the Vita.
2432360	2433360	Really?
2433360	2434360	Yeah, Book of Memories.
2434360	2436440	Why did I think that was a different game?
2436440	2437440	I don't know.
2437440	2438440	Because there's another one.
2438440	2439440	Because you're hallucinating.
2439440	2442920	No, no, no, because there was, like, Chain of Memory, no, not Chain of Memories, that's
2442920	2444440	the, uh, Kingdom Hearts game.
2444440	2448060	No, there was another, there was another game, though, that was something of Memories that
2448060	2451600	was for Silent Hill, so it's a very similar title to another one.
2451600	2452600	Um.
2452600	2453600	But yeah.
2453600	2455600	So that'll be coming out.
2455600	2457760	Uh, sure, I'll, I'll at least check it out.
2457760	2460240	I think I'm gonna need to rent a lot of these games.
2460240	2461840	I don't have the money to buy all these games.
2461840	2462840	Maybe I'll have a demo.
2462840	2463840	Ah, there you go.
2463840	2464840	That'll be fair.
2464840	2465840	Um.
2465840	2467480	I wanted to say, though, about the last story.
2467480	2471240	A, I'm excited because I think Mistwalker games are pretty good.
2471240	2475200	Um, you know, Blue Dragon was, eh, I know Jamie's more into it than I am.
2475200	2479800	Lost Odyssey was criminally underrated on the 360, so I'm, I'm, you know, the, a happy
2479800	2482240	medium between those would still be pretty good.
2482240	2485240	So I, I'm looking forward to the last story on the Wii, and I'm really excited.
2485240	2489040	I don't have to wait frickin' nine months to play it.
2489040	2494880	That love, I love how it's, it's got almost the same font as Final Fantasy, and it's the
2494880	2496320	last story.
2496320	2500600	The final fan, I mean, come on, it's like, I didn't even think about a title.
2500600	2501600	The last story.
2501600	2502600	Ah, that sounds good.
2502600	2503600	You know what?
2503600	2504600	That reminds me of another game series.
2504600	2506040	I can't really think of what it is, but.
2506040	2508180	If the game is that good, I don't even care.
2508180	2509240	I don't even care.
2509240	2512240	They could have called it Dinal Dynasty, and I'd still play it.
2512240	2513640	Oh, for the record.
2513640	2514640	What?
2514640	2518800	They're called Dark Unicorns, but this website refers to them as the Ninja Corn.
2518800	2521120	Dark and fierce.
2521120	2522120	The Ninja Corn.
2522120	2523120	The Ninja Corn.
2523120	2524120	I like, I prefer calling them the Trainicorn.
2524120	2525120	Alright, anyhow.
2525120	2526120	Um.
2526120	2531080	So yeah, I'm looking forward to that.
2531080	2532960	Interesting that Nintendo's not bringing it out themselves.
2532960	2537040	This is, you know, with Xenoblade, Nintendo's doing it themselves.
2537040	2539000	So this is where XSeed is doing it.
2539000	2540000	And they did what?
2540000	2541000	They did like Half Minute Hero.
2541000	2542000	They've done a few.
2542000	2543340	They've done some pretty good RPGs and stuff.
2543340	2547880	So I'm glad it's in their hands, because what makes me really happy, and I was getting into
2547880	2551360	this on Twitter with somebody, it makes me really happy that XSeed is doing it, because
2551360	2556440	this means no stupid retail exclusive agreements like we see happening with Xenoblade.
2556440	2558080	And I have faith it'll go pretty well.
2558080	2562160	It really does give me a reason to dust off my Nintendo Wii and check it out.
2562160	2565220	Especially since you're going to have Xenoblade, and then like two months later you're going
2565220	2569160	to have, you know, the last story.
2569160	2571280	So I'm looking forward to that.
2571280	2572280	So.
2572280	2576680	Sergeant Stubby in our chat room, I love that name, wants to know where is the OLR Tumblr?
2576680	2577680	Where is the OLR Tumblr?
2577680	2578680	OrangeLoungeRadio.tumblr.com.
2578680	2579680	Radio.tumblr.com.
2579680	2580680	There you go.
2580680	2583640	We also have a new one called FuckYeahCageMatch.tumblr.com.
2583640	2587120	I don't remember if we said that on the podcast last week or if that was during the final
2587120	2591000	Afterbirth segment, but we do have a new Tumblr called FuckYeahCageMatch, which we will be
2591000	2595720	uploading songs for those that were saying, I liked it when you guys would play songs
2595720	2598000	because it helped me learn new music.
2598000	2604560	But we are also doing, some of our listeners have started a turntable.fm room.
2604560	2606040	I love turntable.fm.
2606040	2608320	And we were in there spinning last week.
2608320	2610320	We were up until one o'clock in the morning.
2610320	2611320	Our time.
2611320	2612920	And like freaking East Coast people were still in there.
2612920	2613920	I know.
2613920	2614920	I was impressed.
2614920	2615920	I was like, I have to sleep at some point.
2615920	2618440	I don't even have a job and I have to sleep.
2618440	2620080	What's going on?
2620080	2622920	All right.
2622920	2623920	Moving on.
2623920	2627040	Let's talk about the Wii U a little bit because we mentioned it a little bit earlier in the
2627040	2628040	show.
2628040	2629040	Some rumors about the Wii U.
2629040	2634360	Apparently this week, Adweek ran a report, Adweek is, you know, one of those magazines
2634360	2640080	about what's going on, mentioning that Nintendo is talking to content providers about content
2640080	2641840	for the Wii U.
2641840	2647120	So think something like Comcast, because that's one of the companies Nintendo's rumored to
2647120	2648840	be dealing with right now.
2648840	2652800	Imagine if the whole Comcast on demand thing, or basically the exact same thing they're
2652800	2656380	putting on the 360, wink, wink, comes over to the Wii U.
2656380	2657960	That's what Nintendo's looking at.
2657960	2661920	Now I got to say where Nintendo does have a leg up on the 360 right now is the fact
2661920	2666800	that that tablet controller, that means I can start watching it and you know, I can
2666800	2669160	see the commercial in my head right now.
2669160	2672120	That Nintendo commercial in my head right now, they're going to be watching something
2672120	2673360	on the TV.
2673360	2675880	And then mom comes in and says, change the channel.
2675880	2678360	I have to watch Oprah or Oprah's not on anymore.
2678360	2680560	I have to watch Dr. Oz.
2680560	2685120	And so the kid can take the tablet and continue watching their little show on demand into
2685120	2686120	the bedroom.
2686120	2690720	As long as that's 30 feet away from the actual console, well, you know, they're going to
2690720	2693280	stretch the truth a little bit, whatever it is, right?
2693280	2700560	So I remember, I remember the very, my very first E3 was the year they showed the DS for
2700560	2701560	the very first time.
2701560	2705080	And I still remember that commercial because that was a big moment.
2705080	2711000	And the commercial for the DS showed a mom and a kid on Picto chat.
2711000	2714340	And the mom was in the kitchen Picto chatting.
2714340	2716880	It's time to come downstairs for breakfast.
2716880	2720360	And the kid was like, okay, you know, like they're having a conversation on Picto chat.
2720360	2723840	And I'm like, this is the most unrealistic thing I've ever seen in my life.
2723840	2729720	Because if that were my house, Rob, get us ready!
2729720	2731120	And I'd hear it upstairs.
2731120	2733640	That's how it worked.
2733640	2739280	Or if you're a good parent, please come downstairs.
2739280	2743500	Or if you're a good parent, you'd have bacon cooking and then you don't need to tell people
2743500	2748240	that there's, you don't even care what kind of, you know, what meal it is.
2748240	2749320	It's bacon cooking.
2749320	2753160	I'm coming down.
2753160	2758360	In my house, it wouldn't have been anything because my mom lived in another state.
2758360	2761120	I just fixed my food when I wanted it.
2761120	2762120	I'm hungry.
2762120	2764120	Time to make my own dinner.
2764120	2765640	I had those nights too.
2765640	2766640	Too busy playing Zelda.
2766640	2769760	No, for me, it was too busy playing Kirby's Avalanche.
2769760	2774980	All right, back to the, I don't know how he got to bacon, but leave it to the show from
2774980	2777280	Nintendo and Comcast.
2777280	2779000	This doesn't surprise me at all.
2779000	2784560	Nintendo seems to be following a very similar path to what Xbox 360 has been doing.
2784560	2786800	And you know, this is where video game systems are headed.
2786800	2788240	So this is logical.
2788240	2793260	I think what's honestly surprising most people in this whole thing is that Nintendo is actually
2793260	2797660	kind of planning ahead for a lot of this stuff and thinking about this.
2797660	2801520	That's the most surprising part is that, wait, Nintendo wants to be taken really seriously
2801520	2802520	here.
2802520	2807400	Well, they would be at a huge disadvantage if they have a broken old network like they
2807400	2808780	have right now.
2808780	2811760	So yeah, they kind of have to.
2811760	2814860	Broken and old.
2814860	2816520	They kind of break my old heart.
2816520	2817520	All right.
2817520	2820920	I was trying to find a way for it to work.
2820920	2821920	That's right.
2821920	2826320	Well, Sony had some fail already with the Vita.
2826320	2830320	Their little Facebook app is gone from the store because it's broken.
2830320	2838080	If you tried to log into it, you got an error code of NP-13144-3 and it meant you had to
2838080	2839640	close the app.
2839640	2843040	So they just took it down and said, we're working on it, but as for when it's going
2843040	2844640	to be back up, no one said.
2844640	2846880	It's only some people I think were getting that error.
2846880	2847880	That's weird.
2847880	2848880	Yeah.
2848880	2849880	I was able to get into Facebook.
2849880	2850880	Okay.
2850880	2851880	In fact, I'm going to load it right now.
2851880	2852880	See if it works.
2852880	2853880	Yeah.
2853880	2857480	They said that they're going to republish it once it's sorted, but the quote is, currently
2857480	2859300	there is no timescale for this.
2859300	2863560	We found out that it wasn't stealing enough user data so that we had to tweak it so that
2863560	2867420	it would steal the proper amount of user data that Facebook requires.
2867420	2871280	If downloading this Vita app upgraded me to timeline, I'm going to be so fucking pissed.
2871280	2876120	Because you know how everything on Facebook now is like, we want you to upgrade to timeline.
2876120	2877840	Turntable tried to do that to me.
2877840	2880600	I updated the timeline back in September.
2880600	2885960	I actually like the timeline because then I can put neat pictures up at the top.
2885960	2891240	I can't read a timeline because there's some shit on the left, some shit on the right.
2891240	2895280	From a design standpoint, I don't like it.
2895280	2897320	I'm trying to speak Jamie's language.
2897320	2903660	I have the cutest picture on mine of Dan and the baby.
2903660	2905840	Not my baby.
2905840	2907960	His cousin's baby.
2907960	2909800	You want to make that very clear.
2909800	2910800	It's a cute picture.
2910800	2911800	Alright.
2911800	2917200	I'm going to change it back to Thrall though, because Thrall a pimp.
2917200	2920160	It is interesting that they had to pull that app so quickly after it was out, but then
2920160	2926700	again if it was a security problem, okay, but I guess a login problem, I would, oh,
2926700	2927700	there it is.
2927700	2928700	I got the same error too.
2928700	2929700	I guess I can't log in anymore.
2929700	2930700	Hold on.
2930700	2931700	Take a picture of it.
2931700	2932700	Hold on.
2932700	2933700	Oh, wait.
2933700	2934700	No, you can look at it on the Vita.
2934700	2935700	Watch.
2935700	2936700	No.
2936700	2937700	Watch.
2937700	2938700	Watch.
2938700	2939700	I just took a picture of the screen just like that.
2939700	2940700	You suck.
2940700	2941700	I just read about that the other day.
2941700	2942700	That's pretty cool.
2942700	2945600	Now I can tweet that if I want to.
2945600	2950640	I can't email the picture to myself, which would be far too obvious, but anyway, I can
2950640	2951640	tweet it.
2951640	2952640	Here's another fun fact.
2952640	2956000	Did you know that your Vita can receive text messages?
2956000	2957000	I didn't.
2957000	2959000	Well, you have a 3G one, right?
2959000	2960000	Uh, yeah.
2960000	2961000	Yes.
2961000	2962000	It can receive text messages.
2962000	2965640	You won't get any notifications, I think, but you can't send text messages.
2965640	2972320	The reason that is because your Vita has a phone number assigned to it because it has
2972320	2976520	a SIM card and SIM cards have phone numbers assigned to them, so you can actually text
2976520	2982920	your Vita and you'll get a message saying, you know, this is from the operator, like
2982920	2983920	the matrix.
2983920	2985080	Operator.
2985080	2988760	I will say this though, I do really like the Twitter app.
2988760	2993320	It's a little bit slow to load some of the tweets compared to the iPhone one, but I got
2993320	2997880	to say the way it's designed is great because I love, it's the first one I've really seen
2997880	3001780	that has those little picture previews right there in the bar, like on the side.
3001780	3005160	So when people post links to pictures or YouTube, you can see it without having to actually
3005160	3007700	like click on it like you do in the web browser and all that.
3007700	3010640	So I just tweeted it.
3010640	3014780	I put it on my personal account at SKIE on Twitter, Skye.
3014780	3016600	That's pretty cool.
3016600	3019200	That is one thing I do kind of like about the Vita, you can kind of do those screenshots
3019200	3020200	and do that.
3020200	3024560	Jamie trying to get her iPhone hovered just at the right angle above my screen.
3024560	3027860	All right, anyhow, let's move on, more news.
3027860	3031760	Something else that was kind of borked on the PlayStation Vita was that the PlayStation
3031760	3037800	Plus minis that you get actually don't work on the Vita and apparently they're working
3037800	3044240	on fixing that problem, but right now you can't play those free games that you unlock
3044240	3047320	with the PlayStation Plus membership.
3047320	3050840	So that's got to suck now, right Rob?
3050840	3057160	Because you got a PlayStation Plus membership to check out some of those minis.
3057160	3058640	I'm not missing that much.
3058640	3061320	Okay, I downloaded this one that's free this week.
3061320	3062320	What is it called?
3062320	3064800	Like Hungry Giraffe or something like that?
3064800	3068800	All it is is this big giraffe neck that goes up the screen and you drive it left and right
3068800	3070120	to pick up fruit.
3070120	3075840	And then like those other things, they're very basic, simple, simple games.
3075840	3079640	For what they are, they're supposed to be basics.
3079640	3081000	That's why they're minis.
3081000	3085560	So for what they are, they're not terrible, but I'm not crying over the fact that I can't
3085560	3088160	play them right now because I know Sony's going to fix it.
3088160	3091540	You know, this is part of what happens when you have the early adopter.
3091540	3094240	Does it make them look a little stupid for having it happen?
3094240	3095240	Yeah.
3095240	3096680	But am I going to throw a fit over it?
3096680	3097680	No.
3097680	3101200	I'm going to throw a fit over this and Katamari and the PSP games to keep me busy.
3101200	3102200	I'll be fine.
3102200	3103200	All right.
3103200	3108800	Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
3108800	3110640	There's some other timeline haters in our chatroom.
3110640	3113360	Shadow Charlie says, timeline is garbage.
3113360	3115160	It's going to be mandatory in a few weeks.
3115160	3117120	Yeah, I keep hearing about that.
3117120	3121360	I'm not the most enthusiastic Facebook user right now.
3121360	3122840	Other comments from our chatroom.
3122840	3128480	Brad from our friends at Pod Culture says, Rob, I'm not a fan of the theme of the Twitter
3128480	3130760	app, but the functionality is nice.
3130760	3134760	Yeah, it would be nice if you could like change the colors up a little bit or kind of put
3134760	3135760	your own designs on it.
3135760	3136760	But maybe in a future version.
3136760	3137760	Who knows?
3137760	3138760	It's still early.
3138760	3140960	It's not like they can't release a new version later.
3140960	3145200	Bobby Blackwolf says, the only thing I dislike is that the Twitter app won't upload pics
3145200	3148820	to Twitpik, only to Twitter's official photo thing.
3148820	3149820	That's a good point.
3149820	3152640	You can't really choose your service on the Vita client.
3152640	3155200	It's all the official one.
3155200	3159960	So I haven't really messed much with that Flickr app either.
3159960	3161000	That looked a little weird.
3161000	3164280	I downloaded it and it was really weird.
3164280	3168560	Like I don't really use Flickr, but the way it was organized was kind of weird.
3168560	3173280	I think if I was actually a Flickr user who had a photo stream set up so I could view
3173280	3176440	friends pictures, it might be a little better.
3176440	3181960	But most of my like picture feeds come through Twitter or I guess Facebook.
3181960	3184360	So I'm not really a Flickr person.
3184360	3187020	But I have some people that are really into photography that do it.
3187020	3190680	But I know like with Flickr, man, people will upload like 250 photographs at once.
3190680	3193040	It's like that would be a lot to have to scroll through.
3193040	3196280	You know, like here's all my Disneyland pictures, womp.
3196280	3202280	So Tiger Claw reminds us there's no Skype in the Vita.
3202280	3206120	Not yet, but there's also, isn't there that built in party chat thing they have now?
3206120	3211360	They have where you can group message and I think you can use the party chat thing that
3211360	3212520	I think that's voice chat.
3212520	3213520	I think so.
3213520	3216360	I think it's supposed to work with PlayStation 3, too.
3216360	3220420	There are some things where the Vita and the PlayStation 3 play each other.
3220420	3222560	I think Wipeout's one of them.
3222560	3224480	Wipeout is one of them.
3224480	3231020	And you know, it's kind of funny, though, is you know how they have that one cross-play
3231020	3235320	section where you get all the games that support cross-play?
3235320	3238640	Wipeout's not on there, which is like, huh?
3238640	3242240	Back again, because I was just looking at the store earlier and Wipeout and uh...
3242240	3244840	It's Hustle Kings and Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
3244840	3245840	Weird.
3245840	3246840	Yeah.
3246840	3251440	And Marvel vs. Capcom 3, I thought the only thing you could do on that was cross-play.
3251440	3257760	Maybe you can fight other people, but I thought it was just playing the game using the Vita
3257760	3260400	as the controller, but I don't know.
3260400	3265160	I'm sorry, you say cross-play and I think of cross-dressing cosplay.
3265160	3266480	Or unicorns and altered beasts?
3266480	3268800	No, I mean, I actually think of...
3268800	3269800	Anyway.
3269800	3275720	Alright, anyhow, well, this is something that'll get maybe some cross-play fans and a lot of
3275720	3278000	other people very excited this week.
3278000	3281200	I know there's a lot of folks in our chat room that are excited about this news.
3281200	3286140	New Pokemon games, Black 2 and White 2 have been announced.
3286140	3289400	And a lot of people went, did they run out of colors?
3289400	3291000	Like Black 2?
3291000	3292240	What is this?
3292240	3293240	What is this?
3293240	3296040	So yeah, we don't really know exactly what it is.
3296040	3297280	It's not gray.
3297280	3299320	That's what a lot of people were thinking it was gonna be.
3299320	3304520	And the other huge thing about this, it's not the 3DS.
3304520	3306160	It's the DS.
3306160	3307680	These are not 3DS games.
3307680	3312120	These appear to be some type of upgrades or sequels to the existing Pokemon Black and
3312120	3313120	White games.
3313120	3317840	They will be out on the DS regular, which granted the 3DS can play them, in Japan in
3317840	3318840	June.
3318840	3323560	Now, there are some North American details, very few, but they're called here.
3323560	3328960	It's gonna be Pokemon Black version 2 and Pokemon White version 2.
3328960	3331160	We'll get details throughout the year.
3331160	3333520	So that means we probably won't have it in June.
3333520	3336080	I'd imagine this is something they're gonna be targeting for the holidays.
3336080	3339740	Again, though, very interesting, it's not 3DS.
3339740	3342560	And the fact that it's a direct sequel.
3342560	3343560	What does that mean?
3343560	3345640	Does that mean it's the same world?
3345640	3348560	How did they add new Pokemon into it?
3348560	3349560	How does this work?
3349560	3353600	But of course I'm not as up and up on my Pokemon, I used to love Pokemon 10 years ago, but I
3353600	3354600	don't follow it anymore.
3354600	3359080	Wouldn't it be hilarious if it was a Game of the Year edition with any additional Pokemon
3359080	3360080	that were offered?
3360080	3361080	I don't even...
3361080	3363280	No, it seems like it's gonna be richer than that.
3363280	3370540	I saw some forums comparing it to when they upgraded Green to Emerald, but that was also
3370540	3373560	a system upgrade with that.
3373560	3376160	Black and White were on the DS, am I right?
3376160	3377440	So there's no system upgrade happening there.
3377440	3381080	It would be funny if they weren't on the DS, if they were on the 3DS and then they downgraded
3381080	3382080	them.
3382080	3385880	No, I mean, Black and White, they could have been advanced for all I know, but they weren't.
3385880	3387720	They were DS titles.
3387720	3393640	I honestly truly have not bought a Pokemon game since Sapphire, I think was the last
3393640	3394640	one I had.
3394640	3395640	I had Pearl.
3395640	3396640	Yeah, so...
3396640	3397640	Ugh.
3397640	3403600	Uh, Rama suggests instead of version 2, just call it V2.
3403600	3407720	Why couldn't they have just done Pokemon Ebony and Pokemon Ivory?
3407720	3409000	I mean, they could have just named it something...
3409000	3410680	And then they could have had that song.
3410680	3412160	Dan was expecting Pokemon Gray.
3412160	3414000	I think a lot of people were.
3414000	3421640	I even heard somebody saying Gray and Gray, like G-R-E and G-R-A. Why?
3421640	3422640	Which would have been weird.
3422640	3425440	Why don't they just do one called Pokemans?
3425440	3426440	That's it.
3426440	3427440	Or how about...
3427440	3428440	Pokemon Rainbow!
3428440	3430440	Pokemon 3D!
3430440	3431840	Done.
3431840	3435920	Because we have Colosseum and...
3435920	3439600	Would y'all be that tore up if they just ditched the color thing?
3439600	3442360	Maybe you would, I don't know.
3442360	3446680	But you know what, if there are more Pokemans to be had, there will be people buying these
3446680	3447680	games.
3447680	3448680	Touch them, love them.
3448680	3449680	That's right.
3449680	3450680	Touch them, love them.
3450680	3453000	And you never know what type of, like, internet things they might try to build into this or
3453000	3454000	whatever.
3454000	3455000	Where's my Pokemon MMO?
3455000	3458700	Maybe that's what's happening on the 3DS here, right?
3458700	3460200	Someone tried to do that and they got sued.
3460200	3462040	Of course they did!
3462040	3464040	Nintendo, what's your money?
3464040	3469320	S-H-A-100, Matt in our chatroom at chat.orangetonstrategy.com says, doesn't matter what platform it's on,
3469320	3471800	it will make millions.
3471800	3475480	Raginator says, no Pokemon Fuchsia?
3475480	3476480	Pokemon Checkerboard?
3476480	3477480	It said Pokemon Clear.
3477480	3479960	How about Pokemon Peaceful Meadow?
3479960	3482120	Pokemon Bloody Tampon.
3482120	3483120	Stop it.
3483120	3484120	Moving on.
3484120	3485560	None of them know what we're talking about.
3485560	3487120	It's for the best.
3487120	3488120	Good.
3488120	3494160	Well, how about that Double Fine adventure thing?
3494160	3495520	They want it to be 2D.
3495520	3502760	In fact, there's a quote on here that said they're working with Nathan Stapley, who is
3502760	3504760	a painter.
3504760	3508920	And they said that they wanted to do it sort of a paint style, you know, paint the backgrounds
3508920	3514080	and hand paint the characters and animate them that way.
3514080	3522600	Which, it would be, if you're gonna do a 2D game, typically it has to be pixel based.
3522600	3527620	If you're going to do something that's gonna flow like paint, it's gonna have to still
3527620	3532960	have a 3D element to it for that level of animation, unless it's all vector based.
3532960	3538320	And then to do that is a little bit different too, because vector graphics are gonna need
3538320	3550040	to have a screen capable of displaying mathematically calculated vectors, where most games are gonna
3550040	3554140	need some type of raster thing to view it, right?
3554140	3558920	So I don't think that's gonna be possible unless they do it some sort of shaded 3D.
3558920	3562120	But the thing on here, and I'm gonna read this quote, one of the things I missed about
3562120	3567920	2D graphic adventures is that you would be able to have a great artist expressing themselves
3567920	3572160	directly on screen, not having to go through 3D shaders or any of the complicated technology
3572160	3575160	might change or alter their vision.
3575160	3578960	I just don't think it's gonna be possible without, for what they're describing, it's
3578960	3584320	not gonna be possible to do it in a pixel based format.
3584320	3586000	I don't think so.
3586000	3589360	But for all those people that pre-ordered it, which is, you know, what we've been calling
3589360	3593000	Kickstarter on Bobby's show earlier this evening when he was talking to us at the end of the
3593000	3597760	show there, we were talking about how Kickstarter is basically the new pre-ordering.
3597760	3601120	They'll get to see the whole journal and if it works or not.
3601120	3602120	Yeah.
3602120	3603120	It'll be interesting.
3603120	3609200	I mean, now I'm trying to think in terms of pixel graphics at high definition, and possibly,
3609200	3614360	but it's gonna be a monster for memory.
3614360	3616560	It would just be a monster for memory.
3616560	3621200	So you would really have to be careful to make it work.
3621200	3623800	Let's travel around the world and check out some games that will be coming out a whole
3623800	3626160	lot sooner than this Double Fine game.
3626160	3628540	As in this week, Loki.
3628540	3630120	There's a few things coming out of this week.
3630120	3633400	Poke Park 2 wonders beyond for the Nintendo Wii.
3633400	3635000	Well there's something for the Pokemon, people!
3635000	3636000	You can have it right now!
3636000	3637000	There you go.
3637000	3638000	What the fuck is Poke Park?
3638000	3641040	Yeah, Poke Park is basically- Do we get to poke them with the Wiimote?
3641040	3647760	No, it's like kind of a spinoff of the Pokemon series where you play as Pikachu and you go
3647760	3650880	through some crappy adventure with Pokemon.
3650880	3651880	Sounds like a kid's game.
3651880	3652880	Yeah.
3652880	3653880	Alright.
3653880	3654880	Pretty much.
3654880	3658840	And then, also this week, we have Lord of the Rings Online, the Myth Roll Edition, which
3658840	3660800	is a prior re-release there.
3660800	3664560	Binary Domain on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 from Sega.
3664560	3669440	Order Up on the PlayStation 3 with Move Support from Ignition.
3669440	3672320	Order Up is kind of like cooking mama on the Wii.
3672320	3677880	Country Dance All Stars for the Xbox 360 and Kinect.
3677880	3687440	Hyperdimension Neptunia MK2, the game where you play, I guess, game consoles turned into
3687440	3689920	anime chicks.
3689920	3693440	That's from Tecmo Koei.
3693440	3700120	And this week, Mortal Kombat The Complete Edition with all the DLC included plus a voucher
3700120	3704380	for the very first Mortal Kombat movie and the soundtrack.
3704380	3706680	That's on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3706680	3709840	Alan secretly wants me to get that.
3709840	3710840	This game...
3710840	3711840	Why?
3711840	3712840	I already own Mortal Kombat.
3712840	3713840	This game looks pretty awesome.
3713840	3718200	One I'm kind of looking forward to this week, SSX on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and finally
3718200	3722880	for the Nintendo DS, Shin Megami Tensei Devil Survivor 2.
3722880	3725000	Let's go to Japan and look at the releases over there.
3725000	3730600	On March 1st, UFC Undisputed 3 comes out on the Xbox 360 and that's really the only release
3730600	3733760	on the Xbox 360 of note this week.
3733760	3743560	On the, excuse me, on March 1st on the PlayStation 3, we have One Piece Kaizuko Musou.
3743560	3746940	I don't think that's somebody actually wearing a One Piece.
3746940	3747940	This is...
3747940	3748940	Dynasty Warriors of One Piece.
3748940	3749940	One Piece is an anime.
3749940	3750940	Aha.
3750940	3751940	So there it is.
3751940	3752940	Yeah.
3752940	3753940	Historical Heroes.
3753940	3754940	It's like a clash.
3754940	3755940	It's a beat-em-up game.
3755940	3756940	They're stretchy pirates.
3756940	3757940	Yeah.
3757940	3764160	On top of that, there's a bad guy in there who has like this spear, uh, uh, what's it
3764160	3765160	called?
3765160	3766700	Uh, slingshot.
3766700	3769440	And I just saw a video today of where someone actually made it and it works.
3769440	3770440	I will say this.
3770440	3774280	I'm noticing like, you know, it has kind of a Street Fighter 4-esque art style to it,
3774280	3779160	but I'm noticing like in some shots, the anime characters look really interesting being brought
3779160	3780160	to life.
3780160	3782560	That's exactly what the character looks like in the manga.
3782560	3786120	If you're interested in that style of gameplay, you should really check out the Cyber Connect
3786120	3788160	2 stuff, like the Naruto games.
3788160	3789640	They are gorgeous.
3789640	3792680	They're just like, it's like, holy crap, anime alive.
3792680	3793680	You know what's funny?
3793680	3799320	I have an issue of Shonen Jump from 1992 with the original One Piece and Dragon Ball Z in
3799320	3800320	it.
3800320	3801320	Nice.
3801320	3802320	Old, huh?
3802320	3804960	Why do I do Japanese releases on this show?
3804960	3807640	Because I don't know any of this, but I guess that's a funny thing.
3807640	3808640	All right.
3808640	3809640	I will say that that game...
3809640	3810640	You're being ironic, Rob.
3810640	3818440	The game is big enough where they're releasing a PlayStation 3 themed console slash game included
3818440	3819440	whole thing with that.
3819440	3820440	Oh yeah.
3820440	3821440	One Piece is big.
3821440	3822440	So yeah.
3822440	3823880	And that's actually a pretty sweet looking PlayStation 3.
3823880	3824880	Look at that.
3824880	3829200	It's like this, it's this brown tan, which I know doesn't...
3829200	3830200	Like copper bronze.
3830200	3831200	Copper.
3831200	3832200	I like, yeah, copper.
3832200	3833200	It's more like a copper color.
3833200	3835240	And it has the like artwork on the PS3.
3835240	3836240	What is it?
3836240	3837240	Like Luffy or something?
3837240	3838240	That's pretty sweet, actually.
3838240	3839240	I think it...
3839240	3840240	Isn't that his name?
3840240	3841240	Mm-hmm.
3841240	3842240	Yeah.
3842240	3846360	Like if I was at all interested in having a Japanese PlayStation 3, that would be one
3846360	3847360	of the ones to get.
3847360	3848360	I got...
3848360	3851840	Man, they get some really sweet custom PS3s over there because it seems like every month
3851840	3852840	there's something.
3852840	3853840	I miss the...
3853840	3856760	Remember when they had the Sakura PS2 that was actually kind of a purple color?
3856760	3857760	I do.
3857760	3858760	That was cool.
3858760	3859760	Mm-hmm.
3859760	3860760	I'm sorry.
3860760	3861760	I still...
3861760	3865760	My original Xbox is that Halo Xbox, which not a lot of people had.
3865760	3866760	So is mine.
3866760	3867760	Oh yeah?
3867760	3868760	You guys had it too?
3868760	3869760	I have it too.
3869760	3873640	You know we've got like three different versions of the Xbox 360.
3873640	3876840	Oh yeah, yeah.
3876840	3879440	Because we had to ship them all back because the red rings went off.
3879440	3881000	Anyway, back to the release dates.
3881000	3887000	On Nintendo 3DS, Doraemon has a game, Nobita no Kiseki no Shima.
3887000	3890800	And Mario and Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games comes out in Japan.
3890800	3893280	There's a demo for that on the marketplace right now, at least in America.
3893280	3896400	I'm pretty sure it's on the Japanese one as well.
3896400	3897620	And that's really it.
3897620	3900120	I don't see a whole lot else coming out this week.
3900120	3901280	Kind of a slower week in Japan.
3901280	3904720	Well it's even slower in the UK.
3904720	3911600	On March 2nd, we have Mario Party 9 for the Wii, Mortal Kombat Complete Edition for 360
3911600	3913640	and PS3 and SSX.
3913640	3915560	That's it.
3915560	3917520	All right.
3917520	3920680	I guess everybody's preoccupied with the Vita or something.
3920680	3921680	All right, Loki.
3921680	3922680	They must be.
3922680	3928400	I mean, I can't think of any other thing they could be occupied with.
3928400	3929400	Here's something interesting.
3929400	3934080	And I think we've talked a little bit about how some of these companies like Microsoft
3934080	3940400	and Sony are trying to emulate other companies.
3940400	3943600	Recently it's been kind of these Wii U tablet things.
3943600	3953160	Well a new one is Sony has patented a new Kinect-like PlayStation Eye camera that's
3953160	3957720	going to have some sort of backwards compatibility with the PlayStation Eye stuff right now,
3957720	3958720	which I guess it could.
3958720	3963460	Because I think the PlayStation Eye camera is just pretty much a camera.
3963460	3968080	But they said the filing calls for a real-time, three-dimensional interactive environment
3968080	3971240	using a depth sensing device.
3971240	3975040	Users would move in front of and interact with.
3975040	3981400	And also it says in body minutes of present invention provided real-time interactive gaming
3981400	3983240	experiences for users.
3983240	3990480	For example, users can interact with various computer-generated objects in real time.
3990480	3994340	That definitely sounds like the Kinect.
3994340	3997880	What happened to the move?
3997880	4002640	Where did that go?
4002640	4009040	I really want them to come out with a controller-less thing and go, well you need buttons.
4009040	4010720	Buttons are where it's at.
4010720	4011800	Button button button.
4011800	4016520	And then honestly I think they should have both.
4016520	4025120	I think that perhaps the PlayStation Eye camera is just not really good at capturing the rest
4025120	4032800	of your body aside from moving the controller around, the PlayStation Eye or the move stuff.
4032800	4033800	So maybe that's what it is.
4033800	4038280	It's like an upgrade to the PlayStation Eye camera that's going to be used in conjunction
4038280	4040040	with the PlayStation Move stuff.
4040040	4043880	So that you have your buttons, you have your controller inputs and stuff like that, plus
4043880	4046520	you have the rest of your body capturing stuff.
4046520	4052240	That's all I can figure it is because it doesn't mention anything about upgrading the move
4052240	4053240	stuff.
4053240	4058680	Well you know we're getting at this point in the year where we've got to be asking ourselves,
4058680	4061940	so what's E3 going to look like this year?
4061940	4064200	We know what Nintendo is doing.
4064200	4069120	We can have a pretty good idea that Sony is going to be doing a little more with the Vita
4069120	4072820	and some of its big games for the rest of the year, but what are they going to mention
4072820	4076440	with the PS3?
4076440	4077440	What's the next big thing with the PlayStation?
4077440	4083840	And the one I really want to know about is Microsoft, what do they got going this year?
4083840	4090720	I'm going to assume Halo 4 is going to really dominate their press conference, but what
4090720	4091720	else?
4091720	4096800	What about, you know, it's kind of the question I wanted answered last year.
4096800	4101800	I think what is the, now show me how Kinect is really going to change my life.
4101800	4106080	Well for like their press conferences go, you're going to probably see something, I'm
4106080	4109440	going to be willing to bet that they're going to show Call of Duty, whatever the new Call
4109440	4112720	of Duty is, it's going to be a big portion of their thing, because they're probably going
4112720	4116360	to have exclusive DLC again, or exclusive window on DLC.
4116360	4120400	I bet you they're going to show something about Grand Theft Auto 5, which they're probably
4120400	4127680	going to have exclusive DLC on that, much like they did with the 4 franchise.
4127680	4136320	And then, oh, there's a new Assassin's Creed game coming out, maybe they'll show something
4136320	4137320	on that.
4137320	4140840	I think as far as first party stuff goes, I mean, Gears of War, I don't know if there's
4140840	4144840	going to be a new Gears of War game this year, I mean, I don't.
4144840	4150680	I'd be really curious at Sony's press conference to see if Final Fantasy XIV returns, because
4150680	4156340	we're looking at this very interesting thing that's never happened in gaming before that
4156340	4164280	I can think of, where the launch of the game on PC was so fucked that they have redone
4164280	4168680	the entire game with this whole 2.0 thing, and the version that's supposed to come out
4168680	4171680	on PlayStation 3 is the 2.0 game.
4171680	4176520	They're just going to pretend that 1.0 basically didn't happen, and then the PC and the PS3
4176520	4177840	will be merged together.
4177840	4182000	So I'm very curious to see if they get up there on that stage and say, Final Fantasy
4182000	4189360	XIV is coming out on the PlayStation 3 in a new version developed for the PlayStation
4189360	4194200	3, or whatever the fuck they embellish it with.
4194200	4197680	Because they were so excited when they had it as the exclusive, remember a couple years
4197680	4198680	ago?
4198680	4199680	Not so excited anymore.
4199680	4203960	Oh shit, we still have to put this game out?
4203960	4206580	Versus XIII could be a thing though.
4206580	4208840	Versus XIII is still, you know.
4208840	4210800	That could be awesome.
4210800	4217220	I just, I don't know, right now they've been pretty good about keeping secrets so far.
4217220	4218480	We still got a few more months.
4218480	4219480	That's right.
4219480	4220920	That's right, let the hype begin.
4220920	4224640	Alright, well speaking of letting the hype begin, this is certainly interesting.
4224640	4228800	Ok, so Nintendo had the press conference this week where we mentioned a lot of the news.
4228800	4230880	By the way, I gotta do a quick tangent.
4230880	4232800	I gotta say this is pretty clever.
4232800	4237520	I woke up the other morning and my little swap note button is lit, meaning I have a
4237520	4240140	new message on the 3DS swap note.
4240140	4242680	And I was like, oh yay, somebody sent me another 3D cat picture.
4242680	4244520	Because that's pretty much all I ever get on swap note.
4244520	4245520	Or fish.
4245520	4247640	Now I've been getting fish this week.
4247640	4252020	So I open it up and it's a message from Reggie Fils-Aime on my swap note.
4252020	4254360	And it even goes, hi, this is Reggie from Nintendo.
4254360	4256880	Because you can do like a little five second audio clip.
4256880	4258600	And it's Reggie's little me.
4258600	4266240	And it says, join me tomorrow at 6am, lol, for a Nintendo Direct announcement.
4266240	4270080	And I even showed it to Alan and we were both kind of like, you know, that is a pretty clever
4270080	4271640	way to spam.
4271640	4276820	And it even unlocked that stationary for use with other swap note stuff.
4276820	4279880	So it was like, hey, Nintendo spammed me, but I got something out of it.
4279880	4283160	Got a new stationary for my next cat picture.
4283160	4287120	Anyhow, so as part of this whole Nintendo Direct conference, they of course mentioned
4287120	4291040	the last story, which, you know, Loki said they would do at some point.
4291040	4293880	Come out, you know, I think you said they'd do it last year, but they're going to come
4293880	4294880	out and say...
4294880	4295880	No, I thought they were going to do it in E3.
4295880	4296880	In E3, yeah, well.
4296880	4297880	And then I said PAX.
4297880	4299640	Wait, are we still missing one?
4299640	4300640	There's still one.
4300640	4302720	There's no Pandora's Tower, but it's coming out in Europe.
4302720	4303920	We talked last week.
4303920	4309360	Europe's got a date.
4309360	4312960	This is happening because the Wii's not even going to get a mention of this year's E3.
4312960	4314400	It's all about the Wii U.
4314400	4317040	They have to get people excited for the Wii U.
4317040	4318040	They have to.
4318040	4323920	Anyhow, 3DS, they'll still say some stuff on the 3DS.
4323920	4328040	And this might be something you see more about at E3 this year.
4328040	4331520	All we got was a hint this week at the Nintendo Direct Conference.
4331520	4340160	Capcom, Bandai Namco, and Sega are all working on something.
4340160	4341160	That's it.
4341160	4344320	And apparently there's a little teaser site.
4344320	4345320	I don't know.
4345320	4346320	This is the first time I'm seeing this.
4346320	4347320	This is a Japanese site.
4347320	4350440	I apologize in advance if this auto-plays music, but I didn't even realize it had its
4350440	4351440	own teaser site.
4351440	4355000	Because what in the fuck are they going to show?
4355000	4358240	What is this supposed to be?
4358240	4360240	Oh, is this like one of those frickin' oh, um...
4360240	4361240	It's an elevator.
4361240	4362240	No, it's a...
4362240	4363240	What do they call those games?
4363240	4364240	Oh, uh, um, ARG.
4364240	4365240	ARG.
4365240	4366240	Oh no.
4366240	4379880	So they punched in a little code and now we see Steam and we see the three logos, so...
4379880	4381880	And Bonpresto up in the corner.
4381880	4382880	Who knows?
4382880	4385440	That could be anything.
4385440	4390440	Maybe they all are also working on the next Super Smash Brothers.
4390440	4395120	And you're going to have Mega Man and Pac-Man and Sonic all doing it.
4395120	4398720	It'll be bad art man, bad box art Mega Man.
4398720	4399720	Ha ha ha.
4399720	4400720	You don't get it.
4400720	4403520	A lot of people's minds are going straight to a fighting game.
4403520	4404520	Which makes sense.
4404520	4405520	That's what we've seen a lot of Cross.
4405520	4408560	Street Fighter, Cross, Tekken, Cross, Dead or Alive.
4408560	4411080	Was Dead or Alive a Sega game?
4411080	4412080	No maybe not.
4412080	4413080	Team Ninja.
4413080	4414080	No that's Team Ninja.
4414080	4415080	Uh, Sega.
4415080	4416080	Virtua Fighter.
4416080	4417080	Virtua Fighter?
4417080	4418080	I don't think so.
4418080	4419080	No.
4419080	4420080	I don't think so.
4420080	4421080	Virtua Pac Fighter.
4421080	4422080	You know what?
4422080	4429760	Okay, I just want to remind everybody, Win Namco and Sega and Nintendo worked together
4429760	4430760	before.
4430760	4436000	That was the F-Zero arcade game.
4436000	4438760	Just throwing it out there.
4438760	4440960	Maybe they're going to let Capcom have their share.
4440960	4441960	I don't know.
4441960	4444400	A fanboy can dream.
4444400	4447000	Capcom doesn't have any.
4447000	4448520	So if you want that.
4448520	4449520	So it's going to be.
4449520	4450520	Exactly.
4450520	4451520	Capcom doesn't have a racer franchise.
4451520	4452520	No no no no no.
4452520	4453520	You're wrong.
4453520	4454520	They do have a racer franchise.
4454520	4455520	What do they have?
4455520	4456520	It would be.
4456520	4457520	Here's what it would be.
4457520	4466360	It would be Daytona, Cross, Ridge Racer, Cross, MotoGP because that's the Capcom franchise.
4466360	4467360	Get out.
4467360	4468360	Get out.
4468360	4469360	In space.
4469360	4472800	In space.
4472800	4474200	You get nothing.
4474200	4475480	You lose.
4475480	4480000	Good day sir.
4480000	4481920	They really need to do a new excite truck.
4481920	4482920	No.
4482920	4483920	For an intent.
4483920	4484920	Let it go.
4484920	4485920	That would sell me.
4485920	4486920	That would sell me a Wii U.
4486920	4487920	A new excite truck.
4487920	4488920	I'm telling you.
4488920	4494160	If they announce a new excite truck for the 3DS, I will be pissed.
4494160	4496040	I will be.
4496040	4497640	What the fuck.
4497640	4498640	They're not.
4498640	4499640	You understand.
4499640	4500640	They won't.
4500640	4501640	You're fine.
4501640	4502640	They're fine.
4502640	4503640	They're not.
4503640	4504640	They're not.
4504640	4505640	They're not.
4505640	4506640	They're not.
4506640	4507640	They're already poo poo'd on that franchise.
4507640	4508640	They're not.
4508640	4509640	Excite bots Loki.
4509640	4510640	That's what you got.
4510640	4511640	You got excite bots.
4511640	4512640	What?
4512640	4513640	Virtua caliber.
4513640	4514640	Alright.
4514640	4515640	I really want to slap whoever you know what Nintendo is like, hey you know what racing
4515640	4516640	games need?
4516640	4518640	Mini games in the middle of the fucking race.
4518640	4519820	That's fantastic.
4519820	4520820	Yeah.
4520820	4523160	Mini games.
4523160	4527520	Let's go back to a time when games were simpler.
4527520	4528520	Not this one.
4528520	4534920	We call the classic game of the week back when game companies. They didn't work together. They all hated each other's guts
4537640	4541880	In fact there was a big rivalry between Sierra online and
4543240	4545240	Lucasfilm games
4545640	4548420	Actually, I don't know if there really was that big of a rivalry. I just made that up
4549120	4551760	What's a classic game of the week Dark Sakura Luma?
4551760	4558560	Which is one of my favorite games excellent pick by the way. I have surprised. I hadn't done it before but I
4559480	4561480	Love the music in this game
4563080	4568400	At any rate loom was put out by Lucasfilm games, which is now Lucasarts and
4569200	4574280	It was the fourth game. That was the use the scum engine
4574280	4582240	I still like saying the scum engine and was led by Brian Moriarty who was the guy who gave a swish bringer Trinity and beyond
4582240	4583400	Zork
4583400	4585400	just saying
4585400	4589680	So actually it's on Steam now. You can play the loom on Steam, and it's like five bucks really
4589680	4591680	I didn't know that yeah, I have it on Steam nice
4592360	4593880	So it's an adventure game
4593880	4599680	And it's really different because it's a big fantasy story set in the future
4599680	4605520	And it its interface is actually very different for its time, so basically with the game
4605520	4609640	is that you play a little guy named Bob and thread bear who has a distaff and
4610280	4612280	You can play a spell
4613280	4615080	that it's
4615080	4620400	Musical like one of them is called opening or you have night vision or sharpening. It's different. It's a different
4621240	4624560	type of song that you can play they're called drafts and
4624560	4630600	And you can reverse them by playing them backwards so like for example the dry one
4631040	4637680	Like die sorry like it like the dying thread you play backward it becomes a beach or instead of
4639440	4642280	Terror I guess is calming anyway
4643200	4648520	But at first when you only play the game you only have the note C D and E and as you get through it you
4648520	4652080	Actually get a full scale on the C scale. It's like an ocarina
4652080	4654080	except
4656920	4662360	So basically when it it actually just followed the LucasArts game design philosophy
4662480	4667080	Where a character will never be killed or forced to restart the game and won't have to spend hours
4667760	4672940	Typing in synonyms until they get it so basically has different
4673580	4675580	difficulty levels you have
4675580	4682560	Like an easy to an expert level and the expert level actually doesn't have any of the notes marked on the staff
4682560	4684560	You have to play it by ear
4685560	4692960	But you do have a different graphic sequences that play after that and that's only on the original version
4693960	4698560	But the DOS CD-ROM version has a different graphics to it, too
4698560	4704520	So anyway, the drafts are the same way spells work like I said, you've got different ones that do different things and
4706680	4711720	When you also have this thing on the island that Bobbin lives on called the great loom
4711720	4718440	And it's a loom island and it can echo the last draft that was spun in its presence
4719440	4723600	So the only ones that can't are the ones that Bobbin did by himself
4723600	4726800	So you can't really forget a draft that you do
4727440	4730560	You'll learn everything in the presence of the loom
4730560	4736360	I'm sending so basically it's got like a really in-depth story to this this audio
4737480	4739480	Play came with it. That was
4741000	4745480	It was like a cassette that had all of this
4746680	4752200	Prequel story leading up to it about how the game is going to end and how the game is going to end
4752200	4757280	Prequel story leading up to it about, you know, how it's in. Let me see if I can find the the world
4757800	4761000	It's in the future. It's in 8021 and
4762560	4769760	Basically people have dissolved into different types of guilds and the weavers have decided to form this great loom that
4769960	4771800	controls all of reality
4771800	4776320	Except they stopped being able to have kids. So this one woman named Signe Threadbear
4778080	4780080	Sneaks past them and
4780080	4782080	Actually
4783760	4790360	Weaves a gray thread into the great loom and out of it comes an infant and they turn her into a swan and
4792320	4797120	This one other woman decides to raise Bobbin this is starting to sound like a Bjork video
4798200	4800200	It's awesome
4800360	4806160	But anyway, the the elders are actually named after the three fates of Greek mythology
4806160	4808160	Um
4809200	4810960	They
4810960	4816640	As things happen the the woman who raises Bobbin and I'm trying to find her name
4816640	4821040	I think it was like hat hatch something. It's been a while. I'm trying to see if I can find it in the article
4821840	4823840	but
4825040	4830000	This woman who ends up raising him Oh Dame Hetchel, that was her name who was a serving woman
4830000	4835680	She ends up teaching Bobbin how to weave drafts
4836480	4842040	Which he wasn't supposed to learn until he turned 17. And so she gets turned into a swan, too
4842920	4844920	or no, she gets turned into a
4846480	4848800	Different kind of bird but as it goes on basically
4849240	4853800	Everyone on the island gets turned into a swan and they fly off and the only one left is Bobbin
4854160	4856160	So he's trying to figure out what's going on
4856160	4858160	So
4858840	4864000	Yeah, she gets turned as the swan appears and cast a spell on all of the villagers
4864000	4869080	So all the weavings except Bobbin are turned into swans and it turns out that you know this one I think it's his mother
4870400	4872120	so
4872120	4873460	this
4873460	4878560	cleric actually takes the weavers to staff to take over the world with an army of undead and
4878560	4884040	And basically Bobbin gets it and has to go on to fight chaos
4886840	4891520	With Bobbin coming into the world like it weaved chaos into the world. So it was
4892800	4896160	Like I said a very in-depth story
4896720	4900120	So there were actually sequels that were planned after the game came out
4900280	4904920	one of them was gonna call be called Forge that had starred rusty nail bender as
4904920	4908120	Who was one of
4909120	4915960	Bobbins friends and then another game called the fold that was a fleece firm flanks
4915960	4918160	I think that's a funny name firm flanks
4919120	4923960	Who was gonna work a character in a John John Waters movie? Well, he was he's one of the shepherds
4923960	4925960	but he was gonna work with rusty and
4927120	4931320	It actually loom sold a lot of copies, but
4931320	4936320	The only reason that the sequels never came out was because basically he wanted to work on other things
4936320	4940600	Nobody else wanted to do him. So it just sort of fell apart. They were ideas
4941320	4947640	as far as getting the game it originally came out on for DOS on an EGA floppy disk and
4948280	4951520	then it came out to the Amiga the Atari ST the Mac and
4952360	4953760	TurboGrafx-16
4953760	4959680	Which actually was a much better version than the other versions. I did not know the TurboGrafx-16 had one
4959680	4964840	fair game in town was selling a copy for 60 bucks and I wanted it so
4965360	4970920	Wow, and Dan's like you already have a game because I have the PC CD and I have it on Steam
4972800	4979120	But anyway, like I said Loon came out later on CD-rom for the FM towns computer and it was a VGA
4980200	4982560	Enhanced and had a digital soundtrack
4983200	4984400	so
4984400	4991920	Everything was so much better on it. It was beautiful. And then a third version came out on CD-rom for DOS in 1992 that were
4993600	4998780	Really really souped up and it I had the talking in it like we got some samples of the voice
4999880	5004440	Yes, we do had voice acting in it. Let's go to this is just right at the beginning here. Yeah
5006360	5008360	So Bobin's walking along
5008360	5013400	Ouch. He gets hit by a rabbit. Bird steals a rabbit.
5017060	5023060	Destiny shall draw the lightning down from heaven roll its thunder far across the sea
5023680	5028240	To where I wait upon the shore of wonder on the day
5028240	5032120	The sky is opened and the tree is split asunder
5032520	5035240	So you get like this when you read different things
5035240	5037240	so
5038120	5040120	And you've got voice acting in it, okay
5042000	5045360	But this actually was the first talking scum game that came out and
5046480	5050480	it had though a lot of the dialogue was rewritten and
5051960	5055480	That's just because they had to edit space they needed the space
5058400	5060400	So
5060400	5066020	They had different solutions to some of the puzzles and different close-ups on the dialogues and different
5068400	5072080	Graphics that were included with it and this was considered to be the definitive version of Loom
5075600	5081440	Also, there was a rumor that said that Orson Scott Card helped make of the original version
5082360	5084680	Not true. In fact, he even said not true
5084680	5092280	But he did help revise the game's dialogue. So he did contribute to the later version of the game the 1992 version and
5094400	5097520	You can't get the DOS CD-ROM version anymore
5098040	5103280	Because of an agreement with Mindscape for licensing. Mindscape is no longer in business by the way
5104440	5111300	So the only way that you can play the original versions of it really is by having the scum VM virtual machine
5112200	5113500	although
5113500	5117240	You can't play the FM towns version. What about the whole steam thing?
5117880	5122200	Let me get to that. This is like the original discs my bad. Okay versions
5123320	5125720	Now the voice to CD-ROM version
5126700	5131000	is available for on Steam for PC and Mac and
5132760	5134760	There is a
5134760	5142800	The community actually the steam community has made a method to play the FM town version with the steam version of Loom
5143600	5149520	So it's there so like as you can hear some of the music has a search from Swan Lake because of the big swan theme
5149520	5153320	In it and the MIDI version was arranged by the fat man. That's what he was called
5155240	5159320	Others are there are you know full CD versions they're sequenced versions
5159320	5166320	It was at the time it really supported all kinds of the different graphics not graphics audio processors that came out that were out at the time
5166320	5180320	and like I said with the package it had an audio tape that had a 30 minute drama that had the nature and the history of the Loom world and about Bobin being born and so the game is a continuation of the story that came on the cassette and
5181320	5184320	Had original music that was composed by Jerry Gerber and
5184320	5196320	The actors who were in that reprised their roles for the talkie version most of them did so it really keeps up with that continuity and it was the first commercial cassette that used the Dolby S noise reduction
5197320	5202320	and it also said that the side a was encoded for Dolby B playback and
5202320	5224320	B the side B was the Dolby S playback so it had an illustrated notebook of the book of patterns which you know basically all the apprentice weavers in the game were given that type of thing and had different descriptions in there different had spaces that you could write down your what you learned in the game and
5224320	5247320	because the drafts are random from game to game it said write it in pencil and it also worked as copy protection since the original disc would ask for the order of the notes for your disc for the first spell that you learn and that's how you can prove that your game isn't a copy
5247320	5260320	if you don't enter the correct notes that came with your book it would go back to the DOS boot screen that's pretty clever I think
5260320	5284320	you know basically like you put in your code here it actually was reviewed in dragon magazine number 159 and it was given a 5 out of 5 stars and overall had a 75% review and it was actually appeared in other games in the secret of monkey island there was a guy named Cobb who was in the scum bar and he was a
5284320	5304320	wearing a shirt that said ask me about Loom nice and actually in the VGA remake of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade a painting in the vault of the Brunwell Castle reveals a beach that appears as scenery from Loom and in the NES version of Maniac Mansion there's a broken record called the soundtrack of Loom also in Space Quest
5304320	5327320	4 there is a game parodies called there's one called boom exactly like a Allen literally just shouted from the other room yes yeah so that's the game Loom you can get it on steam I literally paid actually when I got it I paid $3 for it because it was on sale
5327320	5350320	totally worth it it's an amazing little point and click alright there it is your classic game of the week you had a lot to say about that one but it's a you know it's a really in-depth kind of game and I would just be stuck hours playing this game with my friend Marcy good times yeah alright well that's gonna do it for part a of orange launch radio but don't go anywhere we've got plenty more to come when we come back with orange launch radio another MMO going free to play
5350320	5366320	a classic a classic classic game from back in the day I can't believe I'm calling a dreamcast game back in the day but I just did apparently set to come back so we're gonna talk all about that we come back with more of orange lounge radio
5366320	5393320	welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio we're starting the second half of our show live here at all games radio it is February the 26th of 2012 and we are live with the 447th episode of our show we're about to get into some rapid fire news but I guess I have a interesting breaking news thing or whatever I win the other room
5393320	5421320	and saw my 3ds had the blue light on and I was like oh Rama or somebody probably sent me a cat picture so I assumed it was swap note going off but it wasn't I had suddenly new data so you 3ds owners might want to check I just suddenly had new data in the mee plaza and it told me that that the puzzle trading mode you know like or the picture the picture swap thing is now available via spot pass which is the internet not just the walking by spot pass which is the internet
5421320	5449320	not just the walking by somebody which I think they call street pass right street pass and spot pass so and then it gave me a piece of a brand new puzzle from kid Icarus uprising so you know which obviously the Nintendo stuff is to promote their own products I'm sure but I thought that was interesting that that just updated right now so those of you the guys with 3ds that are into that kind of collecting stuff might want to check that out right now because I just got it and I imagine the rest of you probably have it on their way just like the whole
5449320	5468320	Reggie note on swap note earlier so I guess not to be outdone by the Vita Nintendo still needs a little attention this week hence their press conference on the day of the Vita launch and now some of this little stuff going on alright let's talk about some rapid fire news just some brief news we want to talk to you a little bit about Loki
5468320	5497320	so one game that's still kind of teasing people over here in North America that they haven't gotten it yet is project 02 or Fatal Frame 2 it is coming to European regions very soon and it's funny because it's like one of those hey look we're translating the English but you can't have it yet you can't have it yet you can't okay fine you can have it no no you can't hahaha that's pretty much what they're doing so
5498320	5523320	yes it's coming to Europe when no idea but the game was actually it was a remake I guess of project zero well fair enough I mean how often does Europe get screwed on having to wait so many months because we got something you know so yeah and of course they don't specify whether North America will see the release as well but maybe
5523320	5546320	if you beg enough this is kind of interesting not really a property that I thought would be getting a game but apparently it was announced that the boondocks saints are getting a video game and I mean absolutely awesome movie kind of curious to see how that would come about but it is going to be apparently
5546320	5571320	a movie or not a movie a video game based off the movie little while after the movie scenes that came out in 1999 but hey you know what the Warriors game was fucking awesome I was going to say that game on the Warriors that was a movie the first Warriors game was fucking awesome not necessarily the second one that they released on Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation
5571320	5599320	or the original one they didn't games on the Godfather years and years later pretty good yeah so it happens and also Scarface was not bad how to kill Bill game I would see that I mean that would be kind of cool be fun just you know I don't know what exactly it would be but that's pretty cool so no word exactly what it is but apparently it's gonna be
5599320	5619320	I guess part of a panel they're gonna have this it's Chris or critical mass interactive they're having a panel about it and I guess critical mass interactive they've done like outsource art and design stuff and they've been they've worked on some of the
5619320	5648320	and some pretty old games actually the outfit one of the early titles for the Xbox 360 and the Incredible Hulk not sure which Incredible Hulk game that was but at least this console generation you know but interesting to say the least and last but not least I'm very excited about this game one of my must haves
5649320	5675320	of this year Borderlands 2 has been announced that it'll be coming to North America September 18 internationally September 24 lots of people excited about that game is Borderlands is awesome have you got a chance to play border I played it a little bit just a little bit so I not enough to get a full taste of it but enough to kind of see what people are excited about remember me and shooters don't always get along but I love the it's a little more fallout to me
5675320	5694320	yeah it's a lot of loot dropping and they're gonna have a lot more loot in this and I love how there is kind of self-aware you know of their own jokes and stuff like you know of course the trailer had dubstep in it and they promised that they're all ninety eight point six percent more wub wub
5694320	5723320	according to the trailer this is great great trailer definitely need to watch it if you have it also apparently there is an incentive I guess if you pre-order is par like this premier club and you'll get a gearbox gun pack a golden key item to unlock some sort of loot chests later on in the game and vault hunters relic and stuff like that and you know to be honest the last Borderlands game that was some really well
5724320	5732320	done dlc right there I mean there was just those expansions were all great every single one of them so looking forward to it
5732320	5757320	alright well let's talk about Metroid yet again another Metroid release don't get too excited it's just the NES classic all over again but the NES game is a true classic but you probably already bought this when it was on the Wii or heck you have the original cart or maybe you unlocked it with the whole Gameboy Advance cable thing but if you miss somehow all those ways to play classic
5757320	5770320	well if you didn't buy your 3DS early enough that's right oh yeah that's right cause the early adopters got this for free well now you'll be able to buy Metroid now keep in mind we're getting this news from Japan but come on inevitably it'll come out here too
5771320	5782320	Japan is getting the Metroid NES release on the 3DS virtual console on February 29th hopefully it's going to be coming here soon after that for those that you know didn't have the early adopter program
5782320	5793320	you know Dark Tetsuya in our little thread where we post all the stories we want to talk about this week he had an interesting prediction guessing that it's the Famicar or the Famidisc version which actually had the better music to it
5793320	5813320	I think that's a great thought or a wish but I wouldn't get your hopes up because the one that the early adopters have now is not that one and I'm pretty sure all this is is going to be just like the Mario one that came out a couple weeks ago where now you have the more proper save states built in and it's just kind of the quote unquote full release
5814320	5819320	it would have multiplayer except Metroid doesn't use that at all so there you go
5819320	5823320	and price it was I think 600 yen?
5824320	5828320	yeah 6 bucks so a dollar more than it costs on the Wii
5829320	5839320	and if you want to put a price tag on your you know what you're getting you know if you assume like each one's going to be about 5 bucks then that's a hundred dollars worth of content
5840320	5843320	well I mean I would assume that the Game Boy Advance games would be more expensive but
5843320	5848320	who knows but they're not going to put those out apparently or at least they say they're not
5849320	5850320	yeah they will
5851320	5855320	or they'll be on the Wii U well we said we wouldn't put them out on the 3DS
5856320	5863320	we had a Pokemon story earlier and you know what Pokemon was all the rage this week on iPhone but for all the wrong reasons
5863320	5873320	this company called I don't know what they were there was something like anime original something I don't know it was clearly a ripoff company released what's called Pokemon yellow right
5874320	5877320	the old Game Boy color or was it Game Boy regular?
5878320	5885320	I think it was red and blue are regular and then yellow had to be the color one because they added Pikachu because he's popular in the cartoon right?
5885320	5894320	I think I'd actually know it was a black and white one was it but you it had like I think special coloration available for the Super Game Boy
5895320	5901320	that makes sense all right well anyhow Pokemon yellow came out on the iOS app store only it wasn't Pokemon in fact it was it was a dud app
5901320	5914320	they were charging 99 cents for this app and it shot to the top of the charts apparently on name alone or you know some type of insider scheme where they had a bunch of people buy it real fast so it shot to the top of the charts I don't know
5915320	5922320	but it was garbage they somebody actually it wouldn't even boot like you would launch the app and it would just die
5922320	5932320	and somebody went in there and somehow hacked it decompiled it and saw that all it was was one of those bullshit apps that's just pictures of Pokemon and maps
5933320	5939320	and Pokemon fan fiction and all this stuff I don't know it's just a bunch of garbage that they throw into an app and then charge for it
5940320	5949320	but because of the fact it was called Pokemon yellow and they said in the description you know five star just like the original and they made up all these fucking press quotes that weren't attributed to anything
5949320	5956320	I mean this whole thing was just a giant rip off well Apple ended up yanking it from the store but it took them like all weekend to do it
5957320	5963320	and now the question is is Apple going to refund the money probably not there is apparently no wait you can't I think you can request the money back
5964320	5975320	yeah if you there's a way that you can request it there's some sort of complaint form and you say basically that the app didn't work because it literally didn't work and then they may give you back the money
5975320	5982320	one thousand three hundred let that be abused let that be a buck lesson that you should do your research on anything you download
5983320	5987320	oh I didn't buy it well I meant to anybody that bought it because it was one dollar right
5988320	5997320	no if it was a legit release also look at the company that made it because the legit release would have come from Nintendo and if they had let it out to a third party or something it would have said
5997320	6012320	but here's the thing though but I understand why they would do that though well why people might buy is because sometimes companies unscrupulous companies will take a game and like say port it to the iOS or whatever
6013320	6024320	you know through an emulator or something like that and it gets yanked and say hi it actually was the working version of Pokemon yellow but you know not licensed or approved or whatever
6024320	6034320	alright well one other story I have for you guys and this is of course sad news because it's about somebody passing Steve Kordek passed away on Sunday
6035320	6042320	but he was a hundred years old so you know you can't say he didn't live a nice full long life I think that's a number we all want to get to
6043320	6052320	if you don't know the name Steve Kordek play more pinball he was highly influential in the pinball world how influential well he's the guy who pretty much thought to do a two flipper table
6052320	6064320	and kind of designed the modern pinball table he gave us drop targets triple action yeah he also I guess later on he didn't just kind of do triple action that kind of did the standard pinball layout if you will
6065320	6075320	he designed more than a hundred tables when he was with Genco and then Williams and Bally he did drop targets in Vagabond and multiball beat the clock 1963
6075320	6083320	so Steve Kordek gave us all those things I played that table but sadly passed away this week they're doing I mean it has all the funeral details here
6084320	6090320	there's a tribute book available online the link is a little lengthy there but I will go ahead and post that link in chat
6091320	6096320	I'll leave you with this quote that he mentioned to the Chicago Tribune in 2009 when he had an interview
6097320	6101320	I've had more fun in this business than anyone could believe
6101320	6104320	rest in peace
6105320	6109320	well how about some news that's not quite so sad
6110320	6111320	yes please topic change
6112320	6120320	yeah there's going to be a few 80s stuff coming out in fact specifically it's a Huey Lewis and the news pack for a rock band
6121320	6125320	there will be do you believe in love the heart of rock and roll and I want a new drug
6125320	6131320	and the letter being one with a pro guitar and bass expansion so it's the usual pricing
6132320	6134320	440 Microsoft points for the pack
6135320	6144320	I want a new drug which you know what he sued for Ghostbusters for sounding like like his little riff in that
6144320	6155320	really yeah also there is a best of Just Dance coming up by Ubisoft I guess people like Just Dance so there should be a best of
6156320	6160320	but it's going to be on the Wii in Europe Middle East and Asia regions
6161320	6165320	hopefully you'll get some songs from You Can Dance ABBA in there just saying
6166320	6171320	well the ones listed on here so far are Hey Ya and Firework by Katy Perry
6171320	6174320	the only girl in the world and airplanes
6175320	6181320	you know I can't really hate on those games they're they're stupid fun if that's what you want to play go ahead
6182320	6191320	and of course of course the Kung Fu fighting you can't touch this not the original it's by the Groove Century
6191320	6200320	and I like to move it move it move it you know what it's interesting when these kind of best collections happen
6201320	6204320	it's almost like what you see happen in the music world when like I don't know who put out a greatest hits CD
6205320	6210320	Goldfrapp just last month put out like a greatest hits CD so this is kind of like a greatest hits CD of sorts
6211320	6217320	but it's not like we haven't seen music games do this before hello guitar hero had a compilation at one point
6217320	6223320	DDR best hits anybody so Konami did it too back in the day
6224320	6232320	well and back in the day they still do it I was going to say best hits was what 19 no probably like 2000 or 2001 it was a PS1 game
6233320	6239320	well the last bit on here is it has to do with Star Wars the Old Republic which I know there are addicts out there that listen to this
6239320	6253320	people are averaging 4-6 hours per gaming session which according to Greg Zestchuk who is the head of Bioware Austin
6254320	6260320	says that it's absurd that their sessions are absurd and that it's that one more quest one more thing
6261320	6265320	and that people are just getting sucked in and he says that Sunday is the busiest day playing
6265320	6274320	but the average during the average work week you get people playing mid afternoon because the East Coast
6275320	6282320	and basically when Europe goes down North America goes up so they're getting consistent play times too
6283320	6289320	and there are 2 million active subscribers so kind of like wow you know with about a fifth of the people
6289320	6297320	and with more no one car I mean I'm I'm not gonna throw shade at Star Wars it was a fine month I played the game
6298320	6304320	but I'm I'll check it out later on once things have leveled out a little more quality life improvements were needed in that game
6305320	6314320	that's it all right anyhow we're gonna get back into some longer set news here this is usually a little part of the show where I have for an interlude
6314320	6320320	but I didn't really have anything tonight so I don't know I heard the Muppets won the Oscar for whatever they were nominated for
6321320	6326320	the songwriter won and apparently Miss Piggy stole it and Matt Smith is on top gear
6327320	6331320	well there you go Doctor Who? Who? Who? Exactly
6331320	6343320	Loki so Aeon a definitely an MMO I haven't played because I don't play MMOs anymore I played it when it was in beta
6344320	6354320	well you may be able to get a chance to play it now because Aeon is going free play and apparently this is coinciding with a 3.0 patch
6354320	6362320	one can only hope that a certain other Final Fantasy Online game when it gets its eventual 3.0 patch will go free to play as well
6363320	6367320	how in the fuck is 11 not free to play at this point that's what I'm somebody asked that question on Twitter
6368320	6372320	like with all these games going free to play how is Final Fantasy 11 I'm not even gonna touch 14
6373320	6377320	but how is Final Fantasy 11 still charging but I guess you know 11 does still have its very loyal fan base
6377320	6385320	you know they're very attached to that game and it's a fine game it's an MMO it's different it's not wow it's very much not wow
6386320	6388320	I played Aeon in the beta it was a little wow
6389320	6393320	if 11 goes free to play and they port to the Vita I may never be seen again
6394320	6397320	that's right they were talking about 11 on the Vita at one point weren't they
6398320	6401320	can you imagine if they know that it's gonna go free to play soon enough
6401320	6409320	although you know if you put 11 free to play before Final Fantasy 14 is done you might as well just shoot it because it's dead
6410320	6412320	I mean it's no one cares
6413320	6417320	the reinvention is gonna be interesting that's all I have to say
6418320	6422320	but anyways one can dream but for right now though Aeon is gonna be going free to play
6423320	6425320	and the 3.0 patch is right around the corner
6426320	6429320	they're saying that they're going to be adding some new zones
6429320	6433320	6 new instances they're gonna increase the level cap up to 60 as well as other tweaks
6434320	6440320	they're gonna have an extended trial with the level cap of 40 and no time limit
6441320	6447320	and of course you know people who I guess are paying for it they'll get free activation for 14 days
6448320	6456320	and doesn't say what it's gonna cost I'm assuming there's gonna be some sort of cost thing or some sort of limits for the free to play stuff
6456320	6459320	nope doesn't say so no idea
6460320	6464320	I was looking at the specs it's like you only get two character slots instead of eight
6465320	6466320	oh darn I know
6467320	6469320	yeah that's so terrible
6470320	6473320	I'm sure they'll try to nickel and dime you that's what a lot of the free MMOs do
6474320	6475320	I have my Star Trek online so I'm happy
6476320	6477320	how is that free have you tried it?
6478320	6479320	I've played it twice
6480320	6481320	does it try to nickel and dime you a lot?
6481320	6487320	well I mean what it did as far as the nickel and dime thing you have to have cryptic points
6488320	6492320	so you actually do have to go in and actively buy a series of points so that you have that
6493320	6497320	and now instead of saying you can unlock this pack and your content is available
6498320	6503320	it actually puts all of the content on there and lets you know what you have unlocked or not or what you can pay to unlock
6504320	6507320	so like for costume packs and extra ships and things
6507320	6513320	and it does that like say that you go into the clothing store to change your outfit
6514320	6519320	it gives you that option while you're in there so I actually really like how that's integrated
6520320	6523320	because you can see what they look like on your character and it lets you know whether or not you want to buy it
6524320	6525320	that's a really good thing
6526320	6529320	so far gameplay wise I haven't really noticed anything different
6530320	6534320	keep in mind when I quit playing I was I think a vice admiral
6534320	6541320	no I was rear admiral and so I've still got my freaking Defiant with all of its badass stuff on it
6542320	6546320	and because I bought content on it I have the medium level account
6547320	6550320	so I haven't noticed any difference
6551320	6553320	I'm supposed to be meeting up with my fleet
6554320	6556320	actually I think later tonight or next week
6557320	6558320	better get home
6559320	6560320	well keep in mind they're in Scotland
6561320	6562320	I'm seven hours behind them
6562320	6563320	right
6564320	6567320	so I'm supposed to be meeting up with them either this weekend or next
6568320	6571320	probably next weekend to have them get me leveled
6572320	6573320	very cool
6574320	6576320	alright well other quick story for you guys
6577320	6580320	this is actually really good news
6581320	6582320	a lot of people are very excited to hear about this
6583320	6586320	Sega put out a teaser trailer this week, 22 seconds
6587320	6589320	and it revealed that a new Jet Set Radio game
6589320	6593320	excuse me not a new game but a rebirth of the original game is on its way
6594320	6597320	Jet Set Radio for Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network
6598320	6599320	if you don't remember
6600320	6601320	is it Jet Grind or Jet Set?
6602320	6603320	Jet Grind
6604320	6605320	Japanese version Jet Set
6606320	6607320	American version Jet Grind
6608320	6609320	Jet Grind for us
6610320	6611320	Jet Set Radio Future was the Xbox one
6612320	6613320	Future was the Xbox one that's not the one we're getting
6614320	6615320	we're getting the original one from the Dreamcast
6616320	6617320	which makes sense we've had half the other Dreamcast games
6617320	6619320	the big ones like Space Channel
6620320	6624320	although I would be surprised or wouldn't be surprised if they re-released it
6625320	6627320	for like you know the Xbox what do they call that
6628320	6629320	the ones where you can download the full games
6630320	6633320	if it's not already because they have that was a backwards compatible title
6634320	6635320	oh that's a good point
6636320	6638320	well but here's the thing and it's gonna be interesting to see how it affects this too
6639320	6642320	is that while it's really exciting to hear that and it was a good game
6643320	6645320	and that was what you skateboarded around into the graffiti it was a lot of fun
6645320	6646320	it's a cheap amato
6647320	6649320	what's well that's the whole thing the soundtrack
6650320	6652320	what happened when Crazy Taxi got re-released
6653320	6656320	the fuck was that band
6657320	6658320	yeah yeah yeah offspring
6659320	6660320	the offspring song was gone
6661320	6662320	but Bad Religion wasn't that still
6663320	6664320	I think they replaced it with something else
6665320	6669320	so it's possible that this game is gonna get a different soundtrack
6670320	6672320	and that is probably the same thing that's holding up the original Xbox
6672320	6678320	the Jet Set Future from coming out is because they can't get the rights to the soundtrack
6679320	6681320	they probably only licensed those songs specifically for that
6682320	6684320	and so they can't suddenly put it out on 360
6685320	6689320	so we'll see because the soundtrack was a huge part of the game
6690320	6693320	so it's like well they could license equally awesome songs
6694320	6698320	or they could try and put in generic stuff and see if the game will sell itself on nostalgia alone
6699320	6700320	which it probably would
6700320	6701320	but it's gonna be very interesting
6702320	6703320	very interesting to see
6704320	6706320	so anyhow I'm still excited
6707320	6708320	so there
6709320	6711320	also it is impossible to sing birthday cake without doing
6712320	6713320	shut up Penny me
6714320	6717320	Miho Hattori's accent
6718320	6720320	yes I'm cooking for my son and his wife
6721320	6722320	extra sugar extra salt
6723320	6724320	I love that song anyhow
6725320	6726320	I love this song too
6727320	6728320	because it means it's time for the mailbag
6728320	6729320	mailbag
6730320	6731320	mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
6732320	6735320	again the email address is mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
6736320	6737320	and that's where you can send us some email
6738320	6739320	that we will read here on the show
6740320	6743320	and I'm saying that email address one more time because more of you need to use it
6744320	6746320	mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
6747320	6748320	girl
6749320	6750320	we actually did get another email in
6751320	6752320	well yay
6753320	6754320	after you checked it Mr. Rob
6755320	6756320	I'm gonna read it last though
6756320	6757320	okay
6759320	6760320	this comes from Haseo Sumirogawa
6761320	6764320	so maybe it came after I read the last email from him
6765320	6768320	also if two people shared two PS3 systems for whatever reason
6769320	6774320	and one bought a new copy of let's say Saints Row the Third with the online pass
6775320	6777320	and one bought it used without the online pass
6778320	6780320	could this person download the online pass from the other person's account
6781320	6782320	and be able to play online?
6783320	6784320	no
6784320	6785320	on the note of online passes
6786320	6789320	can a person without one still update their games and get DLC?
6790320	6791320	yes you can get DLC
6792320	6793320	the only thing you can't do is you can't play
6794320	6798320	sadly enough you can't play SystemLink or whatever they call it
6799320	6803320	and you can't play online co-op
6804320	6805320	well co-op for both of those
6806320	6807320	so you can't play co-op but you can't play
6808320	6810320	well co-op the horde mode as well
6811320	6812320	but the rest of the game you can download the DLC
6812320	6813320	you can play single player you can do all that
6814320	6815320	you just can't play together
6816320	6820320	now on another note I've been playing a Japanese PSP demo for Final Fantasy Type 0
6821320	6823320	now I'm wondering if this is ever going to come to America
6824320	6826320	and now it ties into the Fabula Nova Crystallis
6827320	6828320	it was supposed to be Agito 13
6829320	6832320	right I thought it was coming out here or did come out here
6833320	6834320	I wish
6835320	6836320	hopefully it will
6837320	6840320	but anyways thanks for reading my email signed Haseo Sumirogawa
6840320	6841320	next email
6842320	6844320	greetings OLR it's your friendly neighborhood turtle
6845320	6846320	just wanted to say hi and have a good week
6847320	6848320	your loyal turtle in Philly, serious turtle
6849320	6850320	well thank you
6851320	6854320	yeah I guess I'm looking at Amazon it's all imports on there
6855320	6857320	they want 104 bucks for that Japanese import
6858320	6859320	good lord
6861320	6862320	oh chukaboo
6863320	6864320	look at that face
6865320	6866320	for the record Rob
6867320	6868320	that is very cute it's a mascot cushion 50 bucks
6868320	6869320	I have to tell you something Rob
6870320	6870320	what's that
6871320	6872320	every time I play one of my blood elves
6873320	6876320	and hop on my whatever the crap their peep things are called
6877320	6879320	their striders or whatever
6880320	6883320	my brain instantly starts playing the chocobo music
6884320	6885320	and Dan was walking in
6886320	6887320	while I was writing on one
6888320	6889320	and I was actually humming the chocobo theme
6890320	6891320	in under city
6892320	6893320	and he starts going
6894320	6895320	chocobo bop chocobo bop
6895320	6897320	chocobo bop so it was cute anyway
6899320	6900320	alrighty
6901320	6902320	get down to your chocobo bop
6903320	6904320	I
6905320	6906320	TBA for the North American release
6907320	6908320	there's no date for this right now
6909320	6911320	that's surprise I could have sworn we had
6912320	6914320	that they had confirmed it was coming here and gave a date
6915320	6916320	but I guess not
6917320	6918320	I would imagine this is an E3 thing
6919320	6920320	this is exactly why they're keeping it in their hat
6921320	6922320	this is going to be an E3 thing
6922320	6924320	maybe there's a problem with it being on PSP
6925320	6927320	and not PS Vita at this point too
6928320	6929320	but then again
6930320	6931320	it came out in Japan with only a couple weeks to go
6932320	6933320	before the Vita came out over there
6934320	6935320	so they could still do it as a download thing
6936320	6938320	they could really push it as a download title here in the US
6939320	6940320	so I don't know
6941320	6943320	someone doesn't have Japanese text installed on this computer
6944320	6945320	yeah I know right
6946320	6947320	well this is the show computer not my personal computer
6948320	6949320	so but anyway
6949320	6951320	I would imagine E3
6952320	6953320	you got to hear something on this E3
6954320	6956320	this is too big of a title to not get released here
6957320	6958320	but we'll see
6959320	6960320	can I jump in real quick
6961320	6962320	for the chat room
6963320	6964320	I wanted to follow up to something else
6965320	6966320	I had several people stating this
6967320	6968320	something to remember about Jet Set Radio
6969320	6970320	is that a lot of the soundtrack was done in house
6971320	6972320	so a lot of that will probably stay
6973320	6974320	but certainly there was some great licensed music
6975320	6976320	like the Chibomato comes to mind
6976320	6978320	I really hope they're able to get that to stay
6979320	6980320	but chatters you are right
6981320	6982320	the original in house stuff will certainly stay
6983320	6984320	I'm sure like Space Channel 5 didn't change
6985320	6986320	that was all in house
6987320	6988320	I mean and also you got to think
6989320	6990320	you know the Mexican flyer is now in public domain
6991320	6992320	right
6993320	6994320	so because that's classic big band
6995320	6996320	um
6997320	6998320	Dear Orange Lounge
6999320	7000320	I wanted to write to someone about my recent good experience
7001320	7002320	with Nintendo customer service
7003320	7004320	I bought a 3DS the day it came out
7004320	7005320	two days before the ambassador program began
7006320	7007320	I sent my 3DS through the wash
7008320	7009320	now this is understandable if you are maybe 10
7010320	7011320	but I am 34
7012320	7013320	so I figured that was the end of that
7014320	7015320	womp womp
7016320	7017320	it was my husband who suggested I send the system in
7018320	7019320	for possible repair
7020320	7021320	I dragged my heels for several months
7022320	7023320	I was sure they would do nothing
7024320	7025320	it is $85 to send a system in for repair
7026320	7027320	because my system was less than one year old
7028320	7029320	I received a $20 discount
7030320	7031320	65 days later I had a shopping label
7031320	7034320	boxed it up and sent it away
7035320	7036320	I explained to them that I sent it through the washer
7037320	7038320	and was expecting to get the broken system back
7039320	7040320	with a not our problem letter
7041320	7042320	wait wait $65 later
7043320	7044320	because it was $85 to send them
7045320	7046320	but she had a $20 discount
7047320	7048320	oh ok I thought for a minute too you said 65 days later
7049320	7050320	I don't know why ok ok I'm good
7051320	7052320	9 days later the box came back
7053320	7054320	a letter explaining that they could not fix the old system
7055320	7056320	and had replaced it with a brand new one
7057320	7058320	my SD card which I forgot to remove
7058320	7060320	was taped to the bottom of the cardboard box
7061320	7062320	all of my pictures were still on the card
7063320	7064320	it included instructions to redownload the lost content
7065320	7066320	at no additional cost
7067320	7068320	I had restored all of the games I purchased
7069320	7070320	and was really happy with the new system
7071320	7072320	and the promptness of their response
7073320	7074320	after doing the homework to check the system
7075320	7076320	I found they had signed the replacement system
7077320	7078320	up for the ambassador program
7079320	7080320	all free games were available for me to download
7081320	7082320	squeeee
7083320	7084320	nice
7085320	7086320	I wanted to be able to tell other gamers
7086320	7087320	about this wonderful experience
7088320	7089320	Nintendo went above and beyond helping a silly old
7090320	7091320	don't call yourself old because seriously
7092320	7093320	you're younger than me
7094320	7095320	silly old lady who can't remember to empty her pockets
7096320	7097320	thanks again for your time and your game podcast Emily
7099320	7100320	well thank you for the story Emily
7101320	7102320	I guess Mayor Muse
7103320	7104320	well you know I think there's something though
7105320	7106320	with that ambassador program
7107320	7108320	because I notice you get a little certificate
7109320	7110320	like I'm looking at my 3DS right now
7111320	7112320	there's a little certificate that goes
7113320	7114320	I have a lot of icons don't I
7114320	7115320	but there's this application there that's just
7116320	7117320	3DS ambassador certificate
7118320	7119320	that's all it is and it sits there
7120320	7121320	and when you open it
7122320	7123320	all it is if I remember right is
7124320	7125320	do you want to opt it like it's just one question
7126320	7127320	it says do you want to opt in for notifications
7128320	7128320	for this title
7129320	7130320	oh no no it's a movie that's what it is
7131320	7132320	they just yeah they just recently
7133320	7134320	oh but then they say receive notifications
7135320	7136320	down there it's all it is
7137320	7138320	so it like doesn't really do anything
7139320	7142320	but I'm thinking that being on your 3DS
7142320	7143320	is what lets you download all that stuff
7144320	7145320	and maybe because
7146320	7147320	guys it's inevitable that they're gonna
7148320	7149320	come out with another 3DS
7150320	7151320	like they're gonna incorporate
7152320	7153320	that second circle pad into a new 3DS
7154320	7155320	at some point so I've got to be able
7156320	7157320	to transfer my ambassador shit over there
7158320	7159320	so I'm thinking that little guy being
7161320	7162320	there is the key somehow
7163320	7164320	this probably ties to my console
7166320	7167320	number somehow and Nintendo probably
7169320	7170320	can generate that somehow in-house
7170320	7171320	and did for your
7172320	7173320	you know when you sent your 3DS back
7174320	7175320	but that's great I mean you're right
7176320	7177320	not a lot of folks would do that
7178320	7179320	oh hey my spot pass notification
7180320	7181320	just went off look at that
7182320	7183320	oh that means kitty pictures
7184320	7185320	in 3D oh lord
7187320	7188320	yes it's a swap note
7189320	7190320	oh squee I'm gonna look that up
7191320	7192320	oh great all right
7193320	7194320	well a Rick Santorum portrait made
7195320	7196320	entirely of gay porn
7197320	7198320	talked about that on Horde house already
7198320	7199320	wow it's made up of a lot of legs
7200320	7201320	um so yeah
7203320	7204320	that's it for the emails
7205320	7206320	I want to see more good
7207320	7208320	customer service
7209320	7210320	messages like that
7211320	7212320	that makes me feel
7213320	7214320	joyous in my soul
7215320	7216320	Bobby is in our chat room
7217320	7218320	by black wolf saying Rob
7219320	7220320	all that certificate does is let
7221320	7222320	you get spot pass notifications
7223320	7224320	well yeah that's what the app does
7225320	7226320	but I thought and I could have
7226320	7227320	thought wrong that somehow that
7228320	7229320	application existing
7230320	7231320	was what kind of enabled my 3DS
7233320	7234320	to get all that
7235320	7236320	because obviously they've got to be
7237320	7238320	looking at the MAC address
7239320	7240320	on my system or something on the
7241320	7242320	back end that tells them
7243320	7244320	but all right
7245320	7246320	Tigerclaw saying he sent me a swap
7247320	7248320	note earlier maybe it's finally
7249320	7250320	getting here it seems like it takes
7251320	7252320	a couple hours for things to get here
7253320	7254320	no this is wrong Rama has sent me a cat
7254320	7255320	this is Indy
7256320	7257320	he purrs like a race car
7258320	7259320	oh because his name's Indy
7260320	7261320	look at that there's Indy
7262320	7263320	sorry I'm derailing I'm derailing
7264320	7265320	this radio show with my 3D pictures
7266320	7267320	all right
7268320	7269320	any more emails
7270320	7271320	you just made my eyes hurt
7272320	7273320	here
7274320	7275320	sorry
7276320	7277320	all right then let's get to the F user
7278320	7279320	Sam does that shit to me too with his phone
7280320	7281320	because he has that Android phone
7281320	7283320	he has that 3D pictures oh really here
7284320	7285320	let me do this there all right now I'm
7286320	7287320	not looking at it I'll close it it's
7288320	7289320	fine all right let's get what an
7290320	7291320	appropriate time to get to the FUs of
7292320	7293320	the week
7306320	7308320	my FU of the week I have a few actually
7308320	7311320	because I've had a pissy week number one
7312320	7318320	to me and involuntary actions of myself
7319320	7325320	also FU to misunderstandings and
7328320	7330320	fundamental things and then the last one
7331320	7335320	goes to people being complete assholes to
7335320	7338320	their family members you know you got to
7339320	7341320	think about when kids are little the
7342320	7344320	stuff that you're doing to them you know
7345320	7346320	you can do stuff that's gonna scar them
7347320	7348320	for life you can be too hard too pushy
7349320	7350320	you never know how it's gonna affect
7351320	7352320	somebody so be careful and don't be an
7353320	7356320	asshole don't be an asshole good advice
7357320	7358320	to anybody just because you're a parent
7359320	7360320	doesn't mean you can be an asshole your
7360320	7364320	kids treat them with respect too that's
7365320	7367320	it all right Loki like you the people
7368320	7369320	that don't know how to put lids on fast
7370320	7372320	food drinks I mean seriously it's not
7373320	7375320	that hard people it's not hard to snap a
7376320	7377320	lid on there you really don't have that
7378320	7380320	skill set then you should just jump off a
7381320	7387320	bridge I think my FU of the week isn't
7387320	7389320	that serious because luckily things have
7390320	7391320	been pretty good this week so I can't
7392320	7393320	complain too much but I will give an FU
7394320	7395320	FU to the fact that I forgot I have a
7396320	7397320	doctor's appointment in the morning and
7398320	7399320	I have like this stack of paperwork I
7400320	7401320	have to fill out like I really don't want
7402320	7403320	to do that tonight after the show but I
7404320	7405320	have to but I will say an FU a very
7406320	7408320	serious FU to this amazing dessert I had
7409320	7410320	at BJ's which yes is the name of a
7411320	7412320	restaurant get your mind out of the
7412320	7416320	gutter it I had a pizookie their flavor
7417320	7419320	right now is red velvet pizookie oh my
7420320	7423320	god you bitch it is so I thought I
7424320	7425320	haven't been to BJ's in a while the last
7426320	7427320	time I was there they only had like the
7428320	7430320	chocolate and the peanut butter Oreo and
7431320	7432320	regular juice did it still taste like
7433320	7434320	eating granulated sugar kinda but I
7435320	7437320	didn't even care chocolate chip or chunk
7437320	7441320	or whatever but but but but red velvet
7442320	7445320	oh my god so I'm torn because they're
7446320	7448320	they're putting in a chick-fil-a and
7449320	7452320	Folsom now your chick-fil-a openly
7453320	7456320	supports you propaganda against you know
7457320	7459320	the gays and that community and stuff
7460320	7461320	but their breakfast sandwiches are so
7462320	7463320	delicious it if it's it's actually okay
7464320	7465320	in Sacramento because the local
7465320	7467320	franchise owners here in Sacramento
7468320	7470320	actually support pro-lgbt but is that one
7471320	7472320	the same franchise or that's it don't
7473320	7474320	have to check you'll have to check but
7475320	7476320	hopefully but the Arden one the owners
7477320	7478320	are on the lavender team they are on the
7479320	7480320	Rainbow Chamber of Commerce because they
7481320	7482320	are lavender here well whatever it's
7483320	7484320	whatever it's gay but one of the owners
7485320	7486320	they're just no they're a couple they
7487320	7490320	just want to they've offset you know I
7491320	7492320	mean animals images of chick-fil-a I
7492320	7494320	know the corporate thing still goes
7495320	7499320	towards those big charities but I like
7500320	7501320	to think that they're a little bit is
7502320	7503320	offsetting that part of what chick-fil-a
7504320	7505320	does and that you know the children's
7506320	7507320	programs and everything and the
7508320	7509320	education programs are still good I
7510320	7511320	don't know it's hard to be okay with a
7512320	7513320	service that is preaching hate in one
7514320	7515320	hand yet doing really good things for
7516320	7517320	kids you know I don't I don't know what
7517320	7522320	to think my brain explodes JV Mon just
7522320	7524320	had the balls to tell me in chat that
7525320	7526320	red velvet is overrated you know what my
7527320	7531320	response was get out all right he can
7532320	7533320	stay but don't you ever talk bad about
7534320	7536320	red velvet again all right moving on so
7537320	7538320	yeah it looks like you'll be okay to get
7539320	7540320	your breakfast sandwiches Loki the rest
7541320	7542320	of you I won't be able to go there but
7542320	7546320	it's so there they were really really
7547320	7549320	good we went there I actually put I
7550320	7551320	checked into Facebook or something on it
7552320	7553320	and I had like all these replies so what
7554320	7555320	the hell are you doing it chick-fil-a
7556320	7557320	like don't you know you're not supposed
7558320	7559320	to go there I'm like no you guys it's
7560320	7561320	okay this one's okay it's not as bad and
7562320	7563320	bacon maple doughnuts are fucking
7564320	7565320	delicious all right I do have to tell
7566320	7567320	you one thing about chick-fil-a when I
7568320	7569320	lived in Alabama but I worked in the mall
7569320	7571320	I worked there they would always save me
7572320	7573320	the little tiny hash brown things from
7574320	7575320	breakfast so that I could have them any
7576320	7579320	time during the day nice and those things
7580320	7581320	in Polynesian sauce are crack let's move
7582320	7584320	on so we can get to Twitter topics in
7585320	7586320	the skype line at one eight seven seven
7587320	7588320	game olr but not just yet because we have
7589320	7590320	just a few more stories for you guys
7591320	7593320	Loki now this is kind of weird they're
7594320	7596320	actually gonna be putting out a free to
7596320	7599320	play multiplayer version of Killzone 3
7600320	7601320	on the PlayStation now this is the
7602320	7605320	multiplayer portion of Killzone 3 it's
7606320	7607320	not really anything new but it's gonna
7608320	7609320	be free to play up to a level cap of
7610320	7612320	course you're gonna have a certain level
7613320	7614320	cap and you can play up to that if you
7615320	7616320	want to continue leveling up you'll have
7617320	7618320	to pay $14.99 for the full experience but
7619320	7620320	kind of got me thinking I mean that's
7621320	7622320	kind of interesting that they do that I
7623320	7624320	mean imagine like if Activision that with
7624320	7626320	Call of Duty because you got a minute
7627320	7628320	most of the people are paying for the
7629320	7631320	multiplayer portion of Call of Duty not
7632320	7634320	so much the campaign you could just kind
7635320	7636320	of skip the pleasantries and just get the
7637320	7638320	multiplayer portion plus it's free to
7639320	7640320	play I mean it's an interesting
7641320	7642320	experiment that they're trying that is I
7643320	7650320	guess available available soon on
7650320	7653320	Tuesday sorry I'm furiously adding
7654320	7655320	people to my 3ds over yours I had
7656320	7657320	somebody asked for cat pics so I needed
7658320	7662320	a friend code all right I'm trying to
7663320	7664320	think of other cases where this has been
7665320	7666320	done before where they stripped out part
7667320	7667320	of the game and then kind of like put it
7668320	7669320	up on the marketplace just I don't really
7670320	7671320	have by its own this is kind of new kind
7672320	7674320	of interesting um we have a story last
7675320	7677320	week about Metal Gear Solid 4's online
7677320	7679320	component was shutting down yeah and it
7680320	7681320	seems strange to me they didn't try to
7682320	7683320	strip that out at some point kind of
7684320	7685320	make it a standalone game hmm because no
7686320	7687320	one played it that's why they shut
7688320	7689320	servers and they're like well we'll just
7690320	7691320	disappoint those two people still playing
7692320	7693320	there more people playing Killzone than
7694320	7695320	Metal Gear Solid I guess I don't think
7696320	7697320	there's probably that many people playing
7698320	7699320	Killzone that I think maybe they get
7700320	7701320	more it's a good experiment we'll see
7702320	7705320	what happens all right all right so um
7705320	7706320	Dark Sakura listen up because this is a
7707320	7710320	relevant interest to you grin was a big
7711320	7712320	studio that shut down a couple years ago
7713320	7715320	what year did they shut down was 2009 it
7716320	7717320	was right after bionic commander which is
7718320	7719320	sad that game was not bad I know the
7720320	7721320	internet disagrees with you bionic
7722320	7723320	commander rearmed was awesome but grin
7724320	7725320	did kind of meet an untimely fate and
7726320	7728320	they were working on a lot of shit like
7729320	7730320	they had that Final Fantasy fortress
7731320	7732320	game right or whatever that was we'll
7732320	7736320	get this apparently Barcelona grin their
7737320	7738320	studio there was working on these
7739320	7740320	projects this grin Barcelona closed
7741320	7742320	first they were like the first shoe
7743320	7744320	dropping and then grin mean closing was
7745320	7747320	the other shoe but grin Barcelona was
7748320	7750320	apparently working on a Strider reboot
7751320	7753320	that's what that's what they were working
7754320	7755320	on they had and there's even this teaser
7756320	7757320	video that goes with it and all it is
7758320	7759320	it's pretty badass actually it's uh this
7759320	7761320	you know it's just this little like Russian
7762320	7763320	spy looking dude like if you remember the
7764320	7765320	movie spies like us he looks like that
7766320	7767320	he's just kind of standing there he's
7768320	7769320	putting up a little poster and then all
7770320	7771320	of a sudden see here's the little thing
7772320	7774320	and then just out of nowhere whack you
7775320	7778320	hear a little freak and oh there's all
7779320	7785320	this blood everywhere like a little one
7786320	7787320	of those little quick blade things and
7787320	7788320	then all of a sudden you mean the cipher
7789320	7792320	yeah that's a ciphering because this
7793320	7794320	totally reminds me the opening the cube
7795320	7798320	oh you got something happen sucks to be
7799320	7800320	that guy well here's the thing though
7801320	7803320	Capcom worked or excuse me grin Barcelona
7804320	7807320	worked on that Capcom rejected it Capcom
7808320	7809320	canceled the project grin was gonna do
7810320	7813320	it anyway and just change the IP make it
7814320	7815320	like you know ninja game you know or
7815320	7817320	something a little different but after
7818320	7821320	that didn't happen it got canceled they
7822320	7824320	tried to do a Streets of Rage reboot
7825320	7827320	instead and Sega it didn't happen they
7828320	7830320	got shut down so it's very I mean grin
7831320	7833320	did bionic commando they were trying
7834320	7836320	Strider they were doing Final Fantasy
7837320	7839320	they apparently had Streets of Rage
7840320	7841320	goddamn they were working on a lot of
7842320	7843320	like classic reboots I don't think any
7843320	7845320	of us realize like how vested they were
7846320	7848320	in bringing back I'm just imagining a
7849320	7851320	Metal Gear Solid style game with Strider
7852320	7854320	hear you mm-hmm in concept you kind of
7855320	7858320	look at it so Metal Gear Rising
7859320	7861320	revengeance which revengeance is such a
7862320	7864320	stupid name that's the Capcom Namco Sega
7865320	7870320	project okay maybe not it's a dumb name
7870320	7872320	but yeah there's a bunch of artwork on
7873320	7874320	this Spanish website that you can you
7875320	7876320	know kind of look at some of the concept
7877320	7878320	art for the Strider thing that got
7879320	7880320	canceled you know I don't actually see
7881320	7882320	Strider just you know cuz they had to
7883320	7884320	change it that makes me sad so that's
7885320	7886320	something they'll probably show at e3 is
7887320	7889320	no rising stuff oh yeah Metal Gear I was
7890320	7892320	like what are you talking about grin got
7893320	7894320	canned in 2009 though Capcom really
7895320	7896320	should do Strider because what else do
7897320	7898320	they got they were the rebooting Devil
7898320	7900320	Gear I guess and I just saw some article
7901320	7902320	on the internet this week too about like
7903320	7905320	it was defending Strider only you posted
7906320	7907320	on Facebook for Dan it was the whole
7908320	7909320	thing about Strider on the NES was not
7910320	7911320	that bad yeah it was actually based off
7912320	7913320	the Strider manga and I was reading and
7914320	7915320	I was going I agree I love Strider on the
7916320	7917320	NES like it was awesome that's how I
7918320	7919320	remember Strider because I didn't own any
7920320	7921320	Sega stuff growing up it wasn't till the
7922320	7923320	dreamcast well also though if you were a
7924320	7925320	big fan though of the arcade Strider
7925320	7927320	games that's what that moon dancer is
7928320	7929320	actually by the guy that made the first
7930320	7932320	Strider arcade game and he of course he
7933320	7935320	also worked on Strider 2 which is easy
7936320	7938320	but very fun and but that moon dancer is
7939320	7940320	like basically like a four player Strider
7941320	7943320	yeah it is it's cool I like that so all
7944320	7946320	right there you go just interesting that
7947320	7948320	that studio was working on all that and
7949320	7951320	finally got leaked by a disgruntled
7951320	7954320	community well we need more describe I
7955320	7957320	mean not really so um you know that
7958320	7959320	Oklahoma law that we had actually
7960320	7961320	discussed before about a bill to put a
7962320	7964320	1% tax on violent video games well it
7965320	7968320	failed like we knew it would basically
7969320	7971320	um god this guy has such an awesomely
7972320	7975320	badass name too bad he's you know stupid
7975320	7980320	william fourkiller fourkiller rawr anyway
7981320	7983320	he suggested that any game with an ESRB
7984320	7985320	rating of teen or above should have the
7986320	7987320	tax on it and that the revenue would go
7988320	7989320	to fighting childhood obesity and
7990320	7992320	bullying it was tweaked to focus on
7993320	7995320	creating a task force into the
7996320	7997320	relationship of video games to the two
7998320	8000320	issues and it was voted down by a margin
8000320	8004320	of five to six and so one of the other
8005320	8007320	representatives Pat OMB asked why video
8008320	8009320	games why not french fries or rap music
8010320	8011320	or movies and fourkiller said we have to
8012320	8013320	start somewhere there's no magic bullet
8014320	8015320	that will solve these issues but I
8016320	8017320	wanted to raise awareness of those two
8018320	8020320	issues and basically everyone said
8021320	8023320	representative Mike Reynolds said it's
8024320	8025320	not a good idea we could have a task
8026320	8027320	force on the multiple reasons of
8027320	8032320	childhood obesity so nope basically it's
8033320	8034320	been failing it failed before in New
8035320	8036320	Mexico in 2008 at least your state won't
8037320	8038320	be spending 1.8 million dollars to
8039320	8043320	defend it in court saying yes exactly
8044320	8047320	flu indeed all right anyhow yeah that's
8048320	8053320	it moving on Loki all right so we've
8054320	8055320	kind of seen this type of thing happen
8055320	8057320	before and kind of know where it's gonna
8058320	8059320	go but we'll give them the benefit of
8060320	8061320	the doubt apparently there's a new game
8062320	8063320	called band fuse that's going to be
8064320	8065320	coming out band fuse rock legends it
8066320	8070320	uses real guitars to play learn music or
8071320	8072320	whatever and also they're having
8073320	8074320	microphones involved in this as well so
8075320	8078320	they're singing and guitars the kind of
8079320	8080320	unique thing about it is actually it's
8081320	8083320	real guitar for guitar tabs that are
8083320	8086320	gonna be kind of streaming across there
8087320	8088320	so it actually shows what frets to use
8089320	8091320	and stuff really weird layout there but
8092320	8095320	they've got you know a bunch of big name
8096320	8099320	artists in it as well I want to say this
8100320	8102320	is being put out by because I saw this a
8103320	8104320	while back and I was like I good another
8105320	8106320	music game the guitar game I can't
8107320	8108320	remember who's publishing it I want to
8109320	8110320	say it's like a really small company like
8110320	8112320	maximum family games or something like
8113320	8116320	that so it's gonna be like no sort of
8117320	8122320	advertising or whatever on it but yeah
8123320	8124320	and we coming out this fall and probably
8125320	8126320	will do just about as well as what was
8127320	8130320	that our gig power gig because I was
8131320	8133320	gonna say um I think this game already
8134320	8136320	exists like twice well yeah right one of
8137320	8138320	one of them is doing pretty well and the
8138320	8141320	other one not as well rocksmith did okay
8142320	8145320	but power gig tanked right I think it's
8146320	8149320	just that whole well you have to buy a
8150320	8152320	guitar if you don't already have one and
8153320	8156320	I mean if you have one you probably you
8157320	8158320	probably have other ways to learn how to
8159320	8161320	play guitar other than buying a $60 game
8162320	8163320	I well you know what though I think I
8164320	8165320	talked about this a couple weeks ago on
8165320	8167320	the show is that I know I don't know
8168320	8169320	anyone who bought power gig but I do know
8170320	8171320	some actual musicians who bought
8172320	8173320	rocksmith just you know because it was
8174320	8175320	kind of something that was relevant to
8176320	8177320	their interest and they're really into it
8178320	8179320	because it's it's it's so it's it's it's
8180320	8181320	actual guitar playing unlike you know
8182320	8183320	rock band is where the plastic
8184320	8185320	instruments although rock band tried to
8186320	8187320	incorporate it I guess rocksmith takes a
8188320	8190320	much better teaching approach to it you
8191320	8192320	know and I think a lot of musicians
8192320	8194320	that's what I'm seeing but is it does it
8195320	8196320	necessitate three different games no but
8197320	8198320	then again we didn't really need rock
8199320	8203320	revolution either so this I hate to say
8204320	8205320	it but I think this band fuse rock
8206320	8207320	legends is gonna end up being the rock
8208320	8209320	revolution of the bunch I mean yeah we'll
8210320	8211320	see we'll see what they do with it who
8212320	8216320	knows so yeah all right anyhow one more
8217320	8218320	story for you guys then we're gonna open
8219320	8220320	up the skype line and I think this is
8220320	8225320	great news an old classic game is coming
8226320	8230320	back to the 3ds c-man yay that's right
8231320	8232320	c-man get your minds out of the gutter
8233320	8238320	c-man with an a c-man is coming out on
8239320	8241320	the 3ds it is a report from a japanese
8242320	8246320	news outlet named Nick Nick a c-man is
8246320	8249320	apparently targeted by Nintendo to come
8250320	8253320	back to the 3ds that's the type of thing
8254320	8255320	that Nintendo is targeting but there's
8256320	8257320	no other detail on the update so I don't
8258320	8259320	think we're talking about just like a
8260320	8261320	dump of the Dreamcast game I think we're
8262320	8265320	talking about like a new reimagining of
8266320	8267320	the game which you know is cool because
8268320	8269320	they're thinking kind of outside the box
8270320	8271320	a little bit with not just a game but
8272320	8273320	more of the simulation Jamie you know
8273320	8275320	more about this game than the rest of us
8276320	8277320	what was c-man like how can you describe
8278320	8281320	this game weird um basically you started
8282320	8283320	off listening to Leonard Nimoy's voice
8284320	8286320	and you got these little eggs and you
8287320	8288320	would take care of your little baby
8289320	8290320	spores and raise them and they would
8291320	8292320	eventually turn into little fishy people
8293320	8295320	that would say cute things like marmar
8296320	8297320	and you keep talking to them and
8298320	8299320	eventually they would start talking back
8300320	8301320	and ask you questions and be kind of rude
8301320	8302320	to you and then they would eventually
8303320	8304320	because you had to moderate their
8305320	8307320	temperature in their tank and water level
8308320	8309320	and all of this and eventually they would
8310320	8311320	grow amphibious and you would turn their
8312320	8313320	little thing into a terrarium and then
8314320	8318320	marmar mar. Dan and I would say that over
8319320	8320320	and over again when we were first playing
8321320	8322320	that game and then then we got hey you
8323320	8325320	pikachu which was which already existed
8326320	8327320	oh did it oh I believe it did it was
8328320	8329320	actually called Pikachu Genki de Chu
8329320	8332320	um and that actually was already out in
8333320	8335320	Japan but then it brought us one of the
8336320	8338320	best youtubes we've ever played on OLR
8339320	8340320	and I'm so excited we have an excuse to
8341320	8342320	play this again all credit goes to the
8343320	8344320	YouTube user Ebola world isn't that such

8590320	8591320	picture of them drinking little bottles

8617320	8619320	moving on hi you're on orange launch
8620320	8621320	radio who's this it's Rana what's up
8622320	8624320	everyone hey how you doing Ronnie I'm
8625320	8626320	doing pretty good how about you bro good
8627320	8628320	I'm just looking at chat room and Bobby
8629320	8632320	saying I'll Oscar your butt wow well
8633320	8635320	played what's on your mind Rama I went
8635320	8638320	out and got a 3ds that's why you were
8639320	8641320	dogging on the Vita and chat cuz I was
8642320	8644320	like man Ron was hating on the Vita oh
8645320	8646320	now it's explained you just bought a 3ds
8647320	8649320	actually no I have other reasons for
8650320	8651320	hating on 3ds all right let's talk about
8652320	8653320	your seething hatred first why wait wait
8654320	8655320	you have reasons for hating on 3ds not
8656320	8659320	no no not the 3ds okay oh what are your
8660320	8662320	reasons from hating on the Vita I still
8662320	8665320	stand by the point of the price of it I
8666320	8668320	mean cuz I remember when the PSP came
8669320	8670320	out and I was there selling them and
8671320	8673320	then it's like that whole week they sold
8674320	8675320	it after that it just dropped nobody
8676320	8678320	wanted one there were it just didn't go
8679320	8681320	anywhere I just feel that it's the Vita
8682320	8683320	may have to say that with the Vita and I
8684320	8686320	understand that Sony's going to stand
8687320	8688320	with the ps3 for premium system you have
8688320	8691320	to pay a premium price I just think that
8692320	8694320	Nintendo kind of set the price point of
8695320	8696320	where if the comp if the portable
8697320	8699320	consoles like under 150 bucks or within
8700320	8702320	the 150 $200 range it's well worth it but
8703320	8705320	for 249 for a portable console or 299 for
8706320	8708320	a full for another portable console you
8709320	8710320	better off just buying a regular system
8711320	8714320	hooking it up to your TV all right I
8715320	8716320	mean I can say that you know I can see
8716320	8718320	that the 299 is for the you know 3g model
8719320	8721320	and that'll buy a PlayStation 3 so I I
8722320	8724320	can see where the price is is hurting
8725320	8727320	people but I don't know I'm a sucker for
8728320	8730320	this shit what can I say I'm not hating
8731320	8733320	I'm saying I want a Vita but I will I
8734320	8735320	will gladly wait till the price comes
8736320	8737320	down you know I just I just can't see you
8738320	8739320	know 250 for a portable console but I
8740320	8742320	could put that towards a system hook up
8742320	8745320	to my TV you know it's you know all
8746320	8747320	right so let's let's let's let's make
8748320	8749320	this a conversation about love instead
8750320	8751320	so you bought your 3ds yeah I'm assuming
8752320	8755320	you like it love it yeah mm-hmm well
8756320	8757320	what what made you what made you decide
8758320	8759320	I'm gonna take the plunge and get a 3ds
8760320	8765320	Mario Kart 7 is that it Mario Kart 7 was
8766320	8767320	a good enough game where you were like
8768320	8769320	that's it I'm buying it or is there stuff
8769320	8771320	on the horizon actually at first that's
8772320	8773320	what that really did it because I love
8774320	8775320	playing a Mario Kart racing games and
8776320	8777320	but when I would get my 3ds they were
8778320	8779320	sold out of it I'm looking at whatever
8780320	8782320	games was left and I found upon the last
8783320	8785320	copy of Star Fox 64 3ds I picked that up
8786320	8787320	and those are my games I've been playing
8788320	8791320	back and forth all right well what are
8792320	8793320	you looking forward to in the future from
8794320	8795320	3ds or is Mario Kart 7 gonna last you
8796320	8797320	through 2013 I don't know it's gonna last
8797320	8800320	through 2013 but I've already swap note
8801320	8804320	will oh oh yeah 3ds kitties I know I'm
8805320	8807320	glad you like the kitty I did do you
8808320	8809320	like do you like the 3d cats I send you
8810320	8812320	of course now that we have now we have a
8813320	8814320	cat his name is India I have to start
8815320	8816320	taking a few more shots and sending them
8817320	8818320	over to everyone right answer and then
8819320	8820320	I'll show your cat to my cat and it'll be
8821320	8822320	awkward because cats can't see the 3d but
8822320	8826320	anyway yeah I find it kind of amusing
8827320	8828320	like you like you say about swap note
8829320	8830320	because this whole weekend I'm at manga
8831320	8834320	next and as I sit down pull up my 3ds to
8835320	8837320	play a game I see the little icon to go
8838320	8839320	to the meat Plaza and I'm like going
8840320	8842320	through all find me and the puzzle swap
8843320	8844320	and I'm like at this rate I will not get
8845320	8846320	a chance to play the games that I want
8847320	8849320	to play oh yeah it's the cons you get
8849320	8851320	that stuff crazy fast like you know I
8852320	8854320	can't even tell you last year at e3 keep
8855320	8856320	in mind the price drop hadn't happened
8857320	8858320	yet I was sitting there in the e3 oh my
8859320	8860320	god I just like you would open up your
8861320	8862320	3ds and 10 characters are there you
8863320	8864320	process them all and good take them
8865320	8866320	through find me and then another five
8867320	8868320	more have arrived like it's crazy I've
8869320	8870320	noticed that at 10 that's it only lets
8871320	8872320	you it only lets you to bring 10 friends
8873320	8878320	in at a time yes tip and pro tip so but
8878320	8880320	now there's find me too and now there's
8881320	8883320	puzzle swaps and been bigger so there's
8884320	8885320	even more to StreetPass with and I will
8886320	8887320	say this since we kind of talking about
8888320	8890320	the Vita versus the 3ds the street
8891320	8892320	passing makes a lot more sense than near
8893320	8894320	to me right now I don't get near near
8895320	8896320	has no rhyme or reason to it it's just
8897320	8900320	free shit the app Rob click the button
8901320	8902320	there's people near you I like shit even
8903320	8904320	when people aren't near me it's like free
8905320	8906320	shit yeah I know even I get it randomly
8906320	8907320	from people on my friends list it's

8910320	8912320	free shit yay nothing useful though he's

9241320	9243320	I've seen on the TV I like the girl with

9404320	9405320	and all that stuff but our chat rooms
9406320	9407320	hopping so I'm surprised there's not more
9408320	9409320	people wanting to call but if you all
9410320	9411320	are gonna be shy that's fine going to
9412320	9413320	Twitter Tiger Claw sent me a lot of links
9414320	9415320	and get this we talked about all these
9416320	9417320	things on the show Tiger Claw you forgot
9418320	9419320	pac-man on DVD we talked about that last
9420320	9421320	week that's all right I sometimes forget
9421320	9423320	that I will say this act-def sent me a
9424320	9426320	tweet about another victim of Xbox Live
9427320	9428320	hackings because you know this shit is
9429320	9430320	still going on and yet still no word from
9431320	9432320	Microsoft but I found this interesting he
9433320	9434320	sent me a screen grab of a forum post I
9435320	9436320	don't know what forum this is but he sent
9437320	9439320	me this thing and what's interesting
9440320	9441320	about this guy is he's saying that they
9442320	9443320	bought four thousand points on his
9444320	9446320	account but not with his credit card he
9447320	9448320	never had linked his credit card to the
9448320	9450320	accounts they bought four thousand point
9451320	9452320	they they took his account linked it to
9453320	9454320	another count and then bought four
9455320	9456320	thousand points with somebody else's
9457320	9458320	credit card which was probably stolen
9459320	9460320	let's be real sad to know and I guess he
9461320	9462320	called and got off the phone or whatever
9463320	9464320	apparently the tech people thought they
9465320	9466320	wanted to access an idle account so they
9467320	9468320	could download whatever was on it already
9469320	9470320	you know whatever had been licensed to it
9471320	9472320	and that made me think about when my
9473320	9474320	Xbox got hacked some time ago oh my god I
9475320	9476320	used to buy like every Xbox Live arcade
9476320	9477320	game that was released that person if
9478320	9479320	they were if they knew to do it was
9480320	9481320	probably able to get like 80 90 get I'm
9482320	9483320	serious I had a problem I looked on a
9484320	9485320	slide for a while since you mentioned it
9486320	9487320	out of curiosity went to the hacked on
9488320	9491320	xbox.com site again they have 49 unresolved
9492320	9493320	case stories right now two that have
9494320	9496320	moved from unresolved to resolved so wow
9497320	9499320	you know and here's the thing is that I
9500320	9501320	know 49 doesn't sound like a lot but
9502320	9504320	that's 49 people who know about this
9504320	9507320	website who are in the gaming you know
9508320	9509320	there's tons of people getting hacked we
9510320	9511320	don't even know about like one of my
9512320	9513320	friends from high school was hacked and
9514320	9515320	you know he wouldn't seek out a gaming
9516320	9517320	community to post it he also hadn't
9518320	9519320	played his Xbox in like six months at
9520320	9521320	least all right I will Tiger Claw said
9522320	9523320	oh but I want to get one story and so
9524320	9525320	how about this one I said okay so he
9526320	9527320	sent us this tweet and I guess I'll close
9528320	9529320	with this because our skype line is
9530320	9531320	either broken or I don't know but this
9531320	9533320	topic from Edge magazine he tweeted us
9534320	9537320	Awada throwing shade at Nikkei Japanese
9538320	9539320	news outlet Nikkei which we brought up
9540320	9541320	earlier in the show he's saying quote
9542320	9544320	gossip magazine techniques apparently
9545320	9546320	this is because Nikkei on the website
9547320	9548320	ran a story which said Nintendo is trying
9549320	9552320	to bring back titles like C-man oh so
9553320	9556320	apparently it said that Awada had a quote
9557320	9558320	that said unless Nintendo changed its
9558320	9560320	ways as a matter of urgency it would
9561320	9563320	collapse and Awada went to Twitter and
9564320	9565320	said this is inaccurate this continues
9566320	9568320	repeatedly and it's gossip magazine
9569320	9572320	techniques interesting very similar to
9573320	9574320	another thing I was reading on the
9575320	9576320	internet you know penny arcade has their
9577320	9578320	new little press site thing the PA report
9579320	9580320	right which is it's it's a neat concept
9581320	9582320	for a site because it really focuses on
9583320	9584320	features and lets other people handle
9585320	9586320	the news which I think is a smart way to
9586320	9588320	do this because it's so hard right now to
9589320	9590320	stay on top of the news and all that and
9591320	9593320	there's this article on David Jaff where
9594320	9595320	he got in a verbal confrontation one of
9596320	9597320	the one of the guys from Kotaku what and
9598320	9599320	the guy from PA report is there and has
9600320	9602320	it on tape and it's what David Jaff
9603320	9604320	getting in a confrontation with somebody
9605320	9607320	and throwing throwing colorful languages
9608320	9610320	in the mix I don't believe it that is
9611320	9614320	gotta be fake he's not a like a complete
9614320	9617320	douche or anything no he would never do
9618320	9621320	that I'm serious him and fucking cliffy
9622320	9623320	bean even get the fucking argument right
9624320	9627320	there that I would pay to see douche off
9628320	9631320	go all right well the skype line ain't
9632320	9633320	working I guess I'm getting private
9634320	9635320	messages from people saying they're
9636320	9637320	trying to call and it's not working so I
9638320	9641320	IDK what skype not working that's got to
9641320	9644320	be a load of crap I know I know all right
9645320	9646320	well well I got a private message from
9647320	9648320	Jester Scott saying I can't get through
9649320	9650320	I wanted to call and say thank you for
9651320	9652320	the show and keep up the good work oh
9653320	9654320	it's nice warm fuzzies warm fuzzies
9655320	9657320	group hug red velvet cookies for all but
9658320	9659320	I guess Skype fail and as other people
9660320	9661320	in the chat room are saying Rama broke
9662320	9663320	it all right I'll accept that reasoning
9664320	9667320	Rama broke it thank you Rama Loki any
9668320	9669320	last-minute stories you want to get out
9669320	9671320	for we say goodnight tonight uh yeah I
9672320	9673320	was reading on some stuff because I
9674320	9676320	subscribe to the dash hack network thing
9677320	9678320	talking about hacking stuff apparently
9679320	9680320	you know these new system updates that
9681320	9682320	they keep rolling out from Microsoft's
9683320	9685320	Xbox and how they're you know fixing
9686320	9687320	color correction problems of you know
9688320	9689320	when they're patching something that has
9690320	9691320	to do color correction that kind of stuff
9692320	9693320	that's not exactly what they're doing
9694320	9695320	there of course patching out the reset
9696320	9697320	glitch hacks which basically allows you
9697320	9700320	to j-tag any console out there however
9701320	9703320	team executor one of the hack groups
9704320	9705320	behind a lot of the tools are available
9706320	9707320	out there they have a new device coming
9708320	9709320	out called the executor demon which with
9710320	9711320	a new technique that they figured out how
9712320	9714320	to reset glitch hacks their consoles will
9715320	9716320	be unstoppable it's basically there's no
9717320	9720320	way to patch this out so that sounds like
9721320	9722320	they're pulling a Sony unhackable no way
9723320	9725320	to patch well apparently it I don't know
9725320	9727320	what's involved with it but this new chip
9728320	9729320	it will make it impossible for them to
9730320	9735320	patch it out so neat all right if that's
9736320	9740320	it for the last minute stories then I'm
9741320	9742320	gonna go around and get everybody's final
9743320	9744320	thought dark soccer will start with you
9745320	9747320	ladies first um I shouldn't have eaten so
9748320	9749320	early because I'm freaking hungry and
9750320	9753320	like with my stressful ass day I ate no
9753320	9755320	lunch really you want another one of those
9756320	9757320	gingerbread pita chips because they're
9758320	9759320	really good no it actually had a little
9760320	9762320	bit too much bite for me all right Loki
9763320	9765320	your final thought my final thought is I
9766320	9768320	really hope that this game of luminous I'm
9769320	9770320	playing actually records because the last
9771320	9772320	four of them that I've done and yes I did
9773320	9775320	eventually hit quit so that this you know
9776320	9777320	it would record my score or something like
9778320	9780320	that have not recorded and reset each
9780320	9783320	time so it's kind of annoying my final
9784320	9785320	thought for tonight is you know we've
9786320	9787320	been doing this thing where we talk about
9788320	9789320	video games in the same room without
9790320	9791320	Skype because you know Skype clearly
9792320	9793320	doesn't even want to work half the time
9794320	9795320	as you can see tonight we've been doing
9796320	9797320	it this way for going on 10 years this
9798320	9800320	June and you know not once have we ever
9801320	9802320	asked for any of your money to keep this
9803320	9805320	going and we plan to keep it that way
9806320	9808320	you guys being here in chat is enough
9808320	9809320	reward for us and is the motivation we
9810320	9811320	need to keep doing this show every week

9815320	9819320	friends however hmm I would love you'll
