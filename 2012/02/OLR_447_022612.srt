00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,880
Tonight, February 26, 2012, Sony pulls an app from the Vita just days after release,

2
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,720
Pokemon has new sequels announced, and big companies team up for a portable console game

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,960
collaboration.

4
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,480
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

5
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,680
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,100
We are live right now, Sunday, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf

7
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,800
show at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,120
It is February 26, episode 447.

9
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,880
I'll be joining over the next few hours, my name is Rob Roberts, with my co-hosts, say

10
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,560
hello to Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers.

11
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,560
Hi.

12
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,560
How are you?

13
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,560
I'm alright.

14
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,560
You alright?

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,560
Just alright?

16
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,560
Yeah, it's been trying.

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,560
But you had salad.

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,640
Salad makes it all better.

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,400
I did, but I just put balsamic vinegar in, not the kind of dressing I wanted, so it didn't

20
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,440
turn out all that great and I'm feeling kind of sick now.

21
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,440
Aww.

22
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,440
Well, I hope the show can cheer you up.

23
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,760
We're going to have a fun few hours tonight talking about video games and stuff, with

24
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,400
of course our other co-hosts, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,400
Hello.

26
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,400
How are you, Loki?

27
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,400
I'm fine.

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,480
Alright, starting it off tonight, a popular game we like to play for the show is, what

29
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,920
did Loki bring to dinner tonight?

30
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,080
So, Loki, what did you bring to dinner for the show tonight?

31
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,240
I brought Taco Bell, but I actually wasn't that hungry, I didn't finish it.

32
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,360
Now, and I asked you this before the show, did you try to win another PlayStation Vita

33
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,360
at Taco Bell?

34
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,360
No.

35
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,360
What made you decide to go to Taco Bell?

36
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,440
You know, it's funny, because I actually really hate Taco Bell, or at least I used to really

37
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:57,560
hate Taco Bell, and so I just started eating Taco Bell, because I guess I'm less picky

38
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:04,440
on what I'm eating now, so I got the steak quesadilla, which is hardly steak, but it's

39
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,440
a quesadilla.

40
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,760
Alright, look, I don't need the entire play-by-play.

41
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,960
And two crunchy tacos.

42
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,560
The reason why I'm kind of bringing this up is because I remember just before the show

43
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,360
I was reading about that Taco Bell is in a lot of trouble over this Vita promotion, like,

44
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,280
what is this, a bunch of people got an email that said they won, so imagine this, you get

45
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,680
an email that says, you just won a frickin' PlayStation Vita.

46
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,680
Not quite an email.

47
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,000
Here's what basically happened.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,200
They put their codes into a website, and it says, congratulations, you've won a Vita upon

49
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,280
verification and blah blah blah.

50
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,400
But at the same time, they say first off that someone hacked their site, and so for a while

51
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,940
it was showing that to everybody, regardless if you're a winner or not.

52
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,200
And then they said, oh, well someone gamed the system.

53
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,880
Well apparently someone, the reason they think, well, the reason that someone could game the

54
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,560
system was the code was a 12-digit code.

55
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,240
Only the last four numbers actually changed each time, so it's pretty easy to figure out

56
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,920
every single, you know, to at least run down a list to see which codes would work or not.

57
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,720
And then there's also ways to directly link to the winning page and stuff like that.

58
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
Wow.

59
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:21,800
So, okay, so the company that's marketing this for Taco Bell is, you know, terrible

60
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
apparently.

61
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
Fired.

62
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Well, yeah, among other things.

63
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,680
Well, now there's room, they have a whole Facebook page.

64
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,460
I was reading through that, because, you know, I love drama, so I was reading through their

65
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,800
Facebook page and all these, you know, very angry people, which, you know, I can imagine

66
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,800
especially.

67
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:41,480
I mean, I understand someone may have gamed the game, but I think, I think there legitimately

68
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,560
is probably a lot of people that did actually win that are getting screwed by this.

69
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,560
Yeah.

70
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,600
So, you know, now they're talking about class-action lawsuit, and that good old lawyer from right

71
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:57,280
here in Sacramento where OLR's headquartered that, I don't, who did, he suits, he was buying

72
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,280
some other big lawsuit.

73
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,880
I don't remember if it was Taco Bell before or Sony, might have been the Sony class-action

74
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,880
thing.

75
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,680
I don't know, but I didn't, I didn't, I didn't do all my research, because this literally

76
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
came up before the show.

77
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,840
They had, they had something else on the local news that was like one of those call Curtis

78
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,680
or something like that, you know, the consumer help thing.

79
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,440
Investigative reports, consumer watchdog, please watch our news broadcast.

80
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,440
Yeah, something like that.

81
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,080
And they were checking stuff out, but, you know, I think honestly for anybody that got

82
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:32,800
that page, you know, it says upon verification, now if you have the winning code, I mean,

83
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:39,000
unless, I mean, unless they actually come out, okay, here's the list of code numbers

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,560
that were winning codes, you know, which that's not gonna come out unless, you know, there's

85
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,720
some investigation stuff done during the whole court process, but, you know, how are you

86
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,040
gonna be able to prove that you have a winning code?

87
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,040
You can't.

88
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,920
I mean, because it's up to Taco Bell to say, nope, no, you didn't.

89
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,400
Yeah, I know you saw that, but it was upon verification, and we verified your code is

90
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,180
not, not a winning code.

91
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:07,400
But apparently also, I guess, the website shows, like, who's won, like, each time there's

92
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,120
a winner, and it hasn't updated for a long time.

93
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,760
Well, now, because the thing is broken, who knows?

94
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,760
I don't know.

95
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,840
It's all messed up.

96
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,840
As very messed up.

97
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,680
So it's gonna be interesting to see the legal things that come out of this or what the promotion

98
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,720
company behind this whole thing is gonna have to do.

99
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,720
We'll see.

100
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,720
If anything, they might try, they'll probably try to sweep it under the rug, but we'll see.

101
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,720
All right.

102
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,160
Anyhow, I want to give a shout out to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, where

103
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,840
folks talk live with us, as we do tape, of course, every Sunday night.

104
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,840
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

105
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,880
I'll let Acidic Vampire start us off tonight, and chat says, hello, people.

106
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
Fuck the Oscars.

107
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,200
Because, yes, it is Sunday, and inevitably, there's always freaking something on TV on

108
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,160
Sundays, whether it be the Grammys or the Tonys, and tonight it's the Oscars, which

109
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,360
is kind of a big deal for some people.

110
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,760
We need the Buddies.

111
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,760
The Buddies?

112
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,480
Yeah, we have the, you know, just, like, a complete, this is what we think of your award

113
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,480
show.

114
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,480
It's butt.

115
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,000
Next year, we need to have the Schmoskers, where we do some type of, you know, video

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,520
game-related Oscar thing on the show, but that would require planning.

117
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,880
Plus, I'm a bigger fan of the Razzies, which talks about the worst in cinema, which they've

118
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,220
changed their schedule now.

119
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,720
They used to give out the awards the day before the Oscar, but now they give the nominations

120
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,840
the day before the Oscars, and the ceremony's gonna be on April Fool's Day.

121
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,120
Guess who got 11 nominations at the Razzies this year?

122
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,160
For worst, like, worst actor, worst producer, worst film, worst everything.

123
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,080
Um, let me think.

124
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,080
Justin Bieber?

125
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,160
No, not Justin Bieber.

126
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,280
Twilight was nominated for worst picture, but Adam Sandler got nominated for, like,

127
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,360
for like three different movies, and that Jack and Jill, he's nominated for worst actor.

128
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,360
That's a winner right there.

129
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,580
There you go.

130
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,720
That is a winner.

131
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,840
That's a winning loser right there.

132
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,840
That's the biggest loser.

133
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,840
And, hey, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and predict another possible winning, well,

134
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,920
it's definitely gonna be a winner coming soon from Adam Sandler as well, Candyland.

135
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:12,040
Is that, oh god, is that the whole, like, Battleship, and all these board games, apparently

136
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,680
Clue's gonna get another movie?

137
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,680
Hasbro, yeah.

138
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,680
He's doing Candyland?

139
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,520
Oh, that's kind of disturbing, like, ugh, I need bleach.

140
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,160
Alright, look, we need to move on, games.

141
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,480
So, before we get into our gaming week, so I guess this might be a little bit about gaming

142
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,720
weeks, but Vita, okay, everybody's got Vita fever this week, because the system officially

143
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,440
launched, so we had a lot of people talking about it last week with the pre-launch, whatever,

144
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,600
now the system officially launched this week, I got my hot little hands on a Vita, and I

145
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,600
think a lot of you out there did, I realize there are some other people that are like,

146
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,120
no one cur, because, you know, there's always gotta be the haters, and then there's of course

147
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,000
a lot of other people that, I think this is where a lot of people fit into, is like, I'll

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,440
probably get one when the price comes down, or when XYZ game comes out.

149
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,000
Speaking of the price coming down, let me start off with this, you were pretty angry

150
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,040
on Twitter this week at a story about the price coming down, this whole games analysts

151
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,840
are analyzing the system two days after it launches, what was this all about?

152
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:18,640
Well, they were like going, oh, it's not selling well, or like, oh, it hasn't sold that many

153
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,960
copies, I don't even know where they're getting data yet, I don't even think they have data,

154
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,560
and now obviously they were looking at Japan, but that doesn't mean anything, I mean, if

155
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,280
you're basing our information off of what goes on in Japan, then the Xbox 360 is doomed,

156
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:37,440
because it just doesn't sell well in Japan, but yeah, they're already saying, oh, it needs,

157
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,920
the price drop needs to happen now, it's like, dude, it just came out, like, how are you

158
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:50,720
even, how are you coming to this conclusion of what its sales are yet, I mean, it just

159
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,200
came out, you're going to get day one sales and that's it, I mean, look at the 3DS, if

160
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,920
you're going to look at the 3DS, you know, day one sales or whatever, I'm sure they were

161
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,920
terrible.

162
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,000
Well, it also seems like the Vita, you know, I'm really trying to be impartial here and

163
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,600
not sound like a Sony fanboy, but I got to be honest, the Vita seems to have a better

164
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,440
launch projection over the next few months than the 3DS had, it seems like they've got

165
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,160
some big titles evenly spaced out to keep it interesting, like what, little big planets

166
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,120
next month, that's going to be a big deal, resistance in a few months, the frickin' Capcom

167
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,640
cross Tekken's got what, 12 people on the Vita, which is ridiculous to me, excuse me,

168
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,860
what did I say, Street Fighter cross Tekken, what did I say, Capcom cross, well, that's

169
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,460
more accurate, look at the characters, they just, they already used the Capcom cross Namco

170
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:44,440
thing or Namcom cross, Namcom, alright fine, it's Namcom, the Namcom game comes out, I

171
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,420
have problems, the Namcom game comes out this coming month, I mean, the Vita's got a lot

172
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:53,560
of stuff coming for it, whereas the 3DS was hurtin', I mean, there was really, I mean,

173
00:09:53,560 --> 00:10:00,360
their biggest launch title was what, the Street Fighter 4, the Street Fighter, sadly Ridge

174
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,720
Racer was pretty good, it was actually, I think it was a pretty good 3DS game, no it

175
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,560
was, it was just funny the way you phrased that, sadly Ridge Racer, well, I mean, Ridge

176
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:18,680
Racer, to be honest, it doesn't change, I mean, it hasn't changed in a long time, so

177
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,640
yeah, I mean, they've got a lot of, and the Vita titles, I mean, there was like a good

178
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:30,360
30 Vita titles at launch, that's a lot, I mean, and there's still, there's some crap,

179
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,640
but there's some, like little deviants, well, but there's some really good stuff too, you

180
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,920
know, like one game I wanna talk about, Luminous, which is hotness, let me put it this way,

181
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,480
I am a huge whore for all things Q Entertainment, and I've been that way on this show for a

182
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,000
long, long time, you know, Luminous, Meteos, Gun Pay, every extend, you know, all their

183
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,040
games, I freakin' defended 99 Nights on this show, it's not that bad, it's not that bad,

184
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:03,080
alright, but, I don't wanna talk about that, alright, but Luminous, like, I bought the

185
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,320
original Luminous, I bought Luminous 2, I bought Luminous on Xbox, I bought Luminous

186
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,800
on Steam, so yes, of course I bought this new Luminous game, and I'll tell you what,

187
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:15,280
it really is the best freakin' one yet, and I'm amazed to say that, because I will say,

188
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,280
Luminous has had its weak points, I don't think that Xbox Live version of Luminous was

189
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,380
very good, because there was so much they promised for that that never happened, where

190
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,600
is my Madonna in Luminous, when's that gonna happen?

191
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:33,120
Hey, real quick, just like, you know, kind of a thought here, wouldn't it be awesome

192
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,600
if they port Child of Eden to the Vita, touch screen, aiming and everything?

193
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,700
Even Rez, heck yeah, like a combo pack would be pretty amazing, but anyway, don't get me

194
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,520
excited, Logie, but like, no, this Luminous game is so good, like, I can't, like, it is

195
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:54,000
this generation's Tetris, it is that freakin' good, like, but, you know, again, I'm fully

196
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,840
admitting, I also just, I have been in love with almost everything Tetsuya Mizuguchi's

197
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,000
ever done, you know, all the way back to like Space Channel 5 and all that, so, you know,

198
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,440
of course there's the built-in love for this game, but it's really hot on the Vita, it's

199
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,600
shows off a lot of the functionality without being ridiculous, like, you can use the back

200
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,140
touch pad, but you don't have to, you can use touch controls, but you don't have to,

201
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,920
you know, there's a lot of good stuff to it, and I like the way it ties into the internet

202
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,640
with the big block, although there's some serious balancing issues with the XP, but

203
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:31,360
whatever, and the song list is so good, it is so good, like, I know, Logie and I had

204
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,400
a talk on Bobby's show about this, yeah, I know he doesn't agree with me totally, but

205
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:40,800
I think the song list is, because it's recognizable enough without them having to have shilled

206
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,920
out all this money for AAA licenses like they did with Luminous 2, because like Luminous

207
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,560
2 had Missy Elliott and Beck and Gwen Stefani, which some of it seemed really oddly out of

208
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:55,040
place, but this song is that perfect match of, oh, hey, this is a song by Faithless,

209
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,520
I think I heard them before, oh, Goldfrapp, they're pretty cool, here's a song, you know,

210
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,560
like, there's just enough, and it's not usually their biggest hit, that's the other thing

211
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,040
I'm noticing, there's a Benny Benassi song in it, but it's not Satisfaction, you know,

212
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,800
there's a Beloved song in it, but it's not Sweet Harmony, it's a really neat way they

213
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,240
kind of came up with that song list, and so, and the skins are gorgeous, the original tracks

214
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,000
they've mixed in are good too, love, love, love, love, it's an early contender for my

215
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,680
game of the year, honestly and truly, but again, I knew I was gonna like this game.

216
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,160
Is it your game of February?

217
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,680
Is my, is totally my game of February, absolutely.

218
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,000
Well, I played yours.

219
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,520
Yes.

220
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:41,720
And my review for the Vita is, oh, my hand, because of how high up the buttons are on

221
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,560
the right side, because again, I had hand surgery, it's holding my hand in that position,

222
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,920
it actually kind of hurt, I tried using the touch screen for Luminous, which was actually

223
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:58,520
a little hard, but it was really pretty, except I got really annoyed at some of the color

224
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,520
change, but you don't even realize when the color's changed until you're like five blocks

225
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,200
in, oh my god, the color's different.

226
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,120
Yeah, the transition effect is much different than it was in the other Luminous games.

227
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,440
Going to our chat room, Black Wolf in our chat room says Luminous was awesome when I

228
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,960
plugged in my heavy duty podcasting headphones, I gotta try that at some point, oh, sounds

229
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,440
awesome.

230
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,040
Let's see, let's go to another question here from Frisbee, is the Vita worth the money?

231
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,280
That's an excellent question that I don't think I can answer with a definitive yes or

232
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,280
no.

233
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:33,640
For me, yes, but I like to be on the cutting edge of this type of technology, now, my Vita

234
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:38,320
experience has not been without problems, the Katamari game, which is the other game

235
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,780
I picked up at launch, besides Luminous, froze my system the other night, like I'm talking

236
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:47,480
it so bad, where it would not wake up out of sleep mode, I tried to hold down the power

237
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,160
button, here's a tip, if you get into this problem, put it into a coma, yeah, it did,

238
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,960
if you hold down, I mean, the Katamari broke it or rolled it up, I don't know, but you

239
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:00,000
hold down the power button for about 10 seconds, and you'll get a menu kind of akin to what

240
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,960
happens when you hold down one of the function keys when you start Windows, where you can

241
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:09,080
do like a hard reset of the Vita, you can reset all your settings, I tried to do a hard

242
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:13,720
reset, nothing happened, I ended up erasing all my settings, nothing happened, and I'm

243
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:20,160
like holy shit, I have a Luminous, I have a Vita that I'm using to play a lot of Luminous

244
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:29,720
break after 24 hours, but finally I just ejected the cartridge of Katamari, woke right up,

245
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,920
and I had to reset everything, and I was so mad that I'd done that, so if your Vita will

246
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,840
not wake up, eject the cartridge first thing, you think it's basic troubleshooting 101,

247
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,320
so in other words my point is the Vita is not without its problems, especially for this

248
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,200
early adoption, but what have we said for years and years and years on this program

249
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,040
is the golden rule of gaming, Dark Soccer, please remind the listeners, a system is only

250
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,480
as good as the games that are on it.

251
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,480
Thank you.

252
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,480
Trademark.

253
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,040
If there is a game on the Vita, or several games on the Vita that you have to have right

254
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,000
now, yes, get one.

255
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,560
If you're a big Luminous whore like me, you're not going to be disappointed.

256
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,520
If you want to get this new Katamari game, Uncharted, it's not a Naughty Dog Uncharted,

257
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,480
but I'm hearing it's okay except for the fact that they've really shoved all the touch stuff

258
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,660
into it.

259
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:19,900
If you want Marvel vs. Capcom 3 on the go, you can't get that on the 3DS right now, then

260
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:24,440
yeah, there might be something here worth your money, but if you don't think there's

261
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,200
something in it for you right now, don't spend the money.

262
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,920
It's really hard to kind of put a price tag on that.

263
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:38,800
I bought a 3DS when they were still $249, I don't regret that decision, but it was kind

264
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,440
of a weak launch lineup.

265
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:47,540
Honestly, I like the Vita, but I have the games that I want on my phone, and I'm really

266
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,080
wanting an iPad later, because you know what I can do with an iPad?

267
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,080
I cayed.

268
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,600
Let me go to SSJ100Matt in our chat room.

269
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,440
Is the 3G version really worth it?

270
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,040
I'll say this, I bought a 3G Vita, and I'm going to answer that with a no.

271
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,640
I kind of think I shouldn't have done that, and I know some of you tried to call me out

272
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,660
on it last week, and I will admit after getting my hands on it and using it, it was a mistake,

273
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:19,020
and I would say they really pushed it with advertising that Super Stardust Delta or whatever

274
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:23,280
is an included game, because it's kind of BS, the hurdles you have to jump around to

275
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,300
get that, and that's part of the reason I just went for the 3G, because I'm like, with

276
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:32,240
all this value, what, I'm paying $10 for 3G, okay, I might use that someday, I'll go ahead

277
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,240
and buy it.

278
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,480
I'm having a little bit of buyer's remorse on that.

279
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,520
However, this is very important, I have an iPhone.

280
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:47,360
If I didn't have the iPhone, I could see a lot more use in the 3G, so that would be my

281
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,320
suggestion for you is that if you don't have some type of, and I realize some of you are

282
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:56,240
Android folks too, if you don't have some type of smart device where you can get the

283
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,920
web anywhere, then you might want to look into 3G for the Vita, I think it would be

284
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,200
a good thing, because the web browser's pretty nice, I got to say, but if you already have

285
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,240
a 3G device that you're paying for, I don't, the games don't play over 3G.

286
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,380
The 3G is for stuff like Nier, it's for downloading patches, that's it.

287
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,720
Don't expect to play head to head over 3G.

288
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,080
It would be kind of a bad experience anyway.

289
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,160
Yes, 3G is a lot slower than most people realize.

290
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:31,280
Yeah, I don't think I would ever use 3G service that much, but here's the way I look at it.

291
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:37,320
With a 3G one, you get an 8 gig memory card with it, and sure, yeah, you can buy that

292
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,840
separately and you may save some money, but at the same time, it's nice to have the option

293
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,880
that if later on you wanted to use 3G, you can, or if you are paying for 3G, say for

294
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,120
example for an iPad, you can literally pop that SIM card out of your iPad, pop it into

295
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,440
your Vita, and oh look, it works.

296
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,440
Nice tip.

297
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,680
Yes, and you don't have to worry about paying extra money for it, and who knows what kind

298
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,160
of exploits and stuff they'll have for that type of stuff later on.

299
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,760
I want to give you another really good tip on the Vita, and that is remote play.

300
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,640
Now remote play already existed on the PSP, but now that you're seeing it on the Vita,

301
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,360
I really feel like I'm looking at the Wii U technology already with this Vita and the

302
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,920
remote play, because over remote play, I can turn on my PlayStation 3 when I'm lying in

303
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:25,240
my bed with the Vita, I can turn on the PlayStation 3, go in there, I can play the PS1 games.

304
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,600
Because right now you can't download a PS1 game to your Vita, you can't, like they don't

305
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,680
have that functionality in there yet, I'm assuming they're going to add it, but what

306
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,600
you can do is if the games are on your PlayStation 3, you fire up remote play, and you can stream

307
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,200
it, and it's like what they're advertising on the Wii U, you're getting the little game

308
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,200
in there.

309
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,860
Now granted, I have several games, and I don't think Umjama Lamy would be a great idea to

310
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,720
play over remote play, because music, game, lag, death, right?

311
00:19:53,720 --> 00:20:00,560
Final Fantasy 5, or something that, you know, the lag isn't going to be a big deal, is great.

312
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,360
And I love the fact, and one of the things I was hoping that they would do, and they

313
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,660
actually did, was mapping the extra buttons, and before with the PlayStation Portable,

314
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:14,360
you had your L2, R2, and stuff mapped to one of the analogs, which is really dumb, and

315
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,400
they have it still where you can do that, where you can hold select and then push a

316
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,120
directional button or something like that, and it does one of those, or you can actually

317
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,280
map it to your back touchpad, which is fantastic.

318
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,280
It's great.

319
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:33,160
Your L2, R2, and L3, R3 are on there, so it's great.

320
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,120
I will put it this way though, I'm going to be really looking at that Wii U price point

321
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:43,480
even closer now, because we can see that the technology is absolutely possible, absolutely

322
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:49,280
possible, with a $200 PlayStation 3, and what is right now a $250 Vita.

323
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,880
That's $450 for this technology, and I got to say, this Vita, probably a lot better than

324
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,120
that tablet controller that Wii U is coming with.

325
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:04,280
So there is no possible way, there is no possible, possible way that Wii U can get away with

326
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,640
charging $450, and I would argue, there is no way that Wii U can get away with charging

327
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,640
$400.

328
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,000
And in fact, I think the bar needs to go even lower.

329
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,440
And if they try to blame the technology, absolute utter total bullshit.

330
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,060
We're looking at it right now with the Vita and the PlayStation 3.

331
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,320
The Nintendo, if they want to win with the Wii U, they've got to be able to deliver this

332
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,080
technology cheaper, and they've got to integrate it a little bit better, because right now

333
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,560
there is no, you know, besides what I just mentioned, there's not a whole lot to do with

334
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,700
remote play.

335
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:36,020
But then again, it just came out, like, you know, a couple days ago.

336
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,780
That's true, and Sony is very good at adding features.

337
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,780
And I got to say-

338
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,280
They saved the PS3 through some of that.

339
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,040
You know, what can I say, you know, out of the box, I have a web browser.

340
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,620
I didn't have to wait months for a patch to unlock the web browser function, which that

341
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,620
web browser was terrible in the 3DS.

342
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,580
But the Vita, but we have to be fair, and the Vita is missing some things it should

343
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,580
have.

344
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,560
Like, the whole fact that it doesn't play PS1 games right now when the PSP did it, that's

345
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,240
a little like, what, what?

346
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,360
I mean, you can do it through remote play, but it's a little weird that that's not there.

347
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,560
They probably haven't built a new, they probably haven't built a new emulator for it, and they

348
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:17,020
could probably do it emulating the PSP, emulating the PlayStation 1, which would be weird.

349
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,200
But they probably want to see if they can improve upon it, make it, you know, hey, look,

350
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,700
the graphics look nicer, or something like that.

351
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,200
So anyhow, I'll talk a little more about Vita games when we get to my gaming week.

352
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,560
I want to go around, we always start off the show with how was your gaming week, I guess

353
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,480
we've kind of already been doing that.

354
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,240
But maybe there's stuff not on the Vita.

355
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,600
We'll start with Dark Sakura.

356
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,880
Well, I played well.

357
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,880
Addict.

358
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,880
Dealer.

359
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,320
And I made a new friend, so I'd like to give a shout out to Renee, who I asked to listen

360
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,320
to tonight.

361
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,320
Hi, Renee.

362
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,320
Hi.

363
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:56,960
Um, I, uh, I was gonna play some Portal 2, I played a lot of Being Pissed Off.

364
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,680
So like, this is the problem I had, you know how, like, you have 50 million channels and

365
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,240
nothing's on?

366
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,920
I was looking at the collection, because we had some Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3, which

367
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,680
mostly was Dan playing and screaming at the TV, because Galactus, even on Super Easy,

368
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,680
is a cheap bitch.

369
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:19,240
So, um, but I was looking at all, at the games, and I was like, I don't want to play this,

370
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,720
I don't want to play this, I don't want to play this, I don't want to play this.

371
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,680
Where is Blue Dragon?

372
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,480
And I could not find Blue Dragon, and I was mad, and I wanted to...

373
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,480
Do you want to borrow mine?

374
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
I have the game.

375
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,480
Okay.

376
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,480
So then I was like...

377
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,100
Haven't touched mine in two years, Steve.

378
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,560
So then I was like, I'm gonna play BlazBlue.

379
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,560
What?

380
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,560
It's not open?

381
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,960
Crap, because I don't like to open things that, you know, aren't already open.

382
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,680
So then I was like, I'm gonna play Jumping Flash.

383
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,720
And I could not find Jumping Flash, even though it was probably right in front of me.

384
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,320
So I was like, I'm just not gonna play anything, and I took a nap.

385
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,600
I'm just surprised that you couldn't see those old PlayStation 1 cases, they were the size

386
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,120
of, like, a small house.

387
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:05,280
We have them in the back room, and keep in mind, we have the cases that size also encompass

388
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:12,320
our Sega Saturn collection, encompass the Sega CD collection, and we have a bunch of

389
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,320
early PS1 games.

390
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,920
You gotta take me back to this whole, why you didn't want to open BlazBlue, though.

391
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,320
I'm not sure I get that, because you guys bought it, so why not open it?

392
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,200
You can't take it back to Walmart at this point, can you?

393
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,840
No, just because I was like, that means I have to open it, and then I'll have to, you

394
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,840
know, try to...

395
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,840
Oh, that evil Shrinkrap.

396
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,680
Yeah, I was like, I don't want to open this.

397
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,680
It is pretty tough.

398
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,560
And then it's gonna get staticky and stick to my hand, and I was like, I don't want to.

399
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,800
That is the ultimate laziest thing I've ever heard in my entire life.

400
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Shut up.

401
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,800
Congratulations.

402
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,920
You know, I finally opened my copy of...

403
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:48,840
Because it ended with, and then I took a nap.

404
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:54,520
The Shrinkrap monster proved too difficult that I went to go take a nap.

405
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,960
I'm just calling it like I see it.

406
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,640
You know I love you, but damn you lazy.

407
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,120
Rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub,

408
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub.

409
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,120
I was tired anyways to bite me.

410
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,520
But, oh God, what else was it that I was...

411
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,640
It was like I wanted to play certain things and I couldn't find them and I was frustrated.

412
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,560
So then I was gonna play Project Diva.

413
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:17,360
No, no, no, no, there's more, because remember I was loaned by one of our lovely listeners,

414
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,360
Project Diva.

415
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,520
Oh, right, right, right.

416
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,280
And I could not find our PSP charger.

417
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,520
I tore up everything and Dan's like, oh, it's in the bin.

418
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,920
Actually, I think it's at my mom's house.

419
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,120
Would you like to borrow our PSP charger?

420
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,880
Because I have one of these now, so I don't know when I'll be using the PSP again.

421
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,880
Sure.

422
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,440
Or are you gonna take a nap instead?

423
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,440
You know what?

424
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:46,000
I had a really bad day, but I also downloaded a new game on my iPhone, but I haven't tried

425
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
it yet.

426
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I downloaded it on Name Alone.

427
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It's called Star Mine.

428
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,360
Oh, like the old Bimani story game.

429
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,360
Yeah, some puzzle game.

430
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,960
I also did play Castlevania the Puzzle.

431
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,920
Freaking sucks on the iPhone.

432
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,560
You cannot, it's like, oh, we're gonna show both of the screens at the same time.

433
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,320
No, it doesn't work because you have to move it with your fingers and the little blocks

434
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,480
are too small and then, oh, sorry, you're just gonna drop the ball.

435
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,040
You know the only good thing about that?

436
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,040
The music.

437
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,640
That's it.

438
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,040
And you know, Dracula being a pimp.

439
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,120
Techness in our chatroom at chat.orangesondready.com says about your story, sounds like a great

440
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,060
first world problem, ma'am.

441
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:32,160
You know, I would like to see an F.U. comic on Jamie's story.

442
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,440
That's not shrink wrap.

443
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,440
F.U.

444
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,200
Actually, you know how my brain translates that?

445
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,380
I hear it phonetically.

446
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,740
That's how my brain translates that.

447
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,760
You sound like a scary monster.

448
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,760
Don't do that.

449
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,080
Loki, how was your gaming week?

450
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,680
I played some of the beta stuff, basically.

451
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,800
Call of Duty, more of that.

452
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:05,360
We got a sixth person in on our games now, so it's more than merry, you know?

453
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,600
I played more Luminous.

454
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,680
Although, see, during the week, there was more rumors that some of those demos might

455
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,200
have been full games, so I had to clear some space off.

456
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:22,760
And I accidentally, well, I deleted my, you know how I installed some stuff for each game

457
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,480
that you pop in there so you have little icons of?

458
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,480
I deleted one of those.

459
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,680
Apparently, that also deletes your save for Luminous or whatever, so I deleted my save

460
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,680
for Luminous.

461
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,680
Apparently, that's because it said, oh, hey, you started playing Luminous for the first

462
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,680
time.

463
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,680
I'm like, no, I haven't.

464
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,680
I've played it before.

465
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,940
If you clear your system settings, the same thing happens where it's all, you just played

466
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,940
Luminous for the first time.

467
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,940
Liar.

468
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:49,680
Even before that, though, I had some weird stuff where it wouldn't get any XP for the

469
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,960
stuff that I did, so that was a little funky.

470
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:58,840
And then, see, played more Rayman Origins, which is pretty fun, but I don't know.

471
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,500
I don't have the patience to kind of play through that whole game, because I'm busy

472
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,840
with a bunch of other stuff right now.

473
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:10,760
But it looks fun, and I had fun with it for the little bit that I played it.

474
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:15,440
Kind of myself, the completionists on that stuff have to go back and finish all the challenges

475
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,440
and everything.

476
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,160
They have time challenges, and they've kind of figured out some tricks with that.

477
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,400
There's a dash move you can do that makes you move faster, which is kind of cool.

478
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:31,960
And then, and that game still looks really gorgeous, Beat Touch My Katamari, or at least

479
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:39,000
I finished the last level in the game, and I kind of don't want to buy any more Katamari

480
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,720
games anymore, because they just all, it's kind of disappointing, because they're not,

481
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,920
they're never as good as like the first few games.

482
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,920
It's like kind of like-

483
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,280
They're whipping that same horse over and over and over again.

484
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,560
It's seriously, the last level was kind of terrible.

485
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,280
It was kind of like, you know, some of the older games where it's like, okay, you start

486
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,600
off really small, and then eventually you're rolling up the continents and like the planets

487
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,600
and stuff like that.

488
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,320
You know, that was epic, but this was like, okay, and I went to some psycho land that

489
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,840
everything's rainbow and I'm starting to roll up some of that stuff, and it was just really

490
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,780
weird for a Katamari game even.

491
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:24,320
And then I unlocked some of the Eternal stages for those, which you get candy for that stuff

492
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,860
too, so I don't know why you wouldn't do the Eternal stages.

493
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:35,320
So I did those and I bought the King of Cosmos some new clothes, because he wanted some really

494
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:39,880
flamboyant stuff, so I made him even more flamboyant, if that's possible.

495
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,560
Yeah, my favorite is that the first thing he asked me for was a bridal cape.

496
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,880
Yes, that's the one I got for him, the bridal cape.

497
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:53,000
I'm like, okay, everybody has their thing, I'm not one to judge.

498
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,680
Exactly, it was just really weird.

499
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:00,900
So I did that, and then, what else did I play?

500
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,280
I didn't play Little Deviants yet, because I really don't want to play that game, looks

501
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,280
like crap.

502
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,680
I actually played some of the Welcome Park stuff and tried to unlock trophies in that.

503
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,040
Some of those games are actually kind of hard.

504
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,720
The Welcome Park stuff for built-in games is, you know, it's alright.

505
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,640
I gotta ask you, did you try some of those AR games?

506
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,640
Not yet.

507
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,760
I did, and I don't like them.

508
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,640
No, seriously, they don't function well at all.

509
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:33,720
And I mean, okay, let's be honest, your apartment, my house and stuff, maybe playing at night

510
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,880
with just lights on, not the best lighting for these games.

511
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:42,040
But it kept getting, especially on the soccer, actually almost all the games, I only played

512
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,560
the soccer and the fireworks one.

513
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,800
And I didn't even really play the soccer game, because I couldn't get it past building the

514
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:53,760
field and going through the motions of how to play the game, because first off, it wouldn't

515
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,440
register my movements well, which kind of sucked.

516
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,840
And second, I kept getting this out of range error, and I'm not that far away from this

517
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,840
stuff.

518
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,240
I mean, I may be like three feet away from the actual cards, which I think is pretty

519
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,680
reasonable, but it just wasn't working.

520
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,400
And then the fireworks one was kind of neat, but the game's kind of dumb.

521
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,520
And once again, I was getting the out of range error, even though I could see all the cards

522
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,720
through the screen, so I don't know what the issue was there.

523
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,720
But I mean, I'm sure it's just some bugs, they'll get worked out.

524
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,760
Even in the hands of the games, they're free, so whatever.

525
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,760
What else?

526
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,760
Oh, I tried the Unit 13 demo, that was actually pretty good, I like that.

527
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,200
Not my type of game, really, I'm not really huge into the SOCOM.

528
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,200
It's like SOCOM, it's somebody that does Zipper Interactive, it's a third person squad shooter

529
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,440
game.

530
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,440
And it's okay.

531
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,440
Those tend to sell pretty well.

532
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,920
Yeah, it's alright, but it's not my...

533
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:59,320
I'm not really into that, you know, Resistance, no, the new Resistance game, I'm definitely

534
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:05,280
gonna be picking up, probably, but this one was not too big for me.

535
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,160
Gripper01 in our chatroom says, the Vita needs a decent pinball game.

536
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,860
Good call.

537
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:14,320
I don't see why there won't be a pinball FX on it soon enough.

538
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,320
That actually reminds me.

539
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,320
Huh.

540
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,960
I forgot to mention, we sold Lord of the Rings.

541
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,960
Oh.

542
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,480
Bye, Lord of the Rings.

543
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,480
Yep.

544
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,480
Just saying.

545
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,480
I mean, it just is gone.

546
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,480
Thank God.

547
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,480
That's right.

548
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,480
I mean, I'm tired of that game.

549
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,880
Did you take it to Mount Mordor, or is it...

550
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,680
No, Sauron came and picked it up.

551
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,840
He was really nice, too, very personable guy.

552
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,400
What does not simply multi-ball into, Mel?

553
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,400
I will say this, if they do put out pinball FX on the Vita, I think that would be a great

554
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:49,280
game for the rear touchpad, to use the blippers, and you could turn it so it's a long screen

555
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,280
instead of the wide screen.

556
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:56,240
I mean, you know, those guys that designed pinball FX, they've already done games on

557
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,760
wide screen televisions, and they work fine, but imagine with the Vita, you could turn

558
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,320
it the other way, and that'd be a pretty kick butt screen.

559
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:09,640
There were some import shooters from Japan that were using the long screen for the PSP

560
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,180
back in the day, so I'd be down for that.

561
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:17,400
I really do feel like there's more potential to be unlocked with the Vita, but to be fair,

562
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:22,680
the 3DS has done a pretty good job of unlocking more as we go, too.

563
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:27,600
So it's on now, so there you go.

564
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,600
What else for your gaming week?

565
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,600
Anything?

566
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,600
That was it.

567
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,520
All right, well, Loki already mentioned Touch My Katamari, which was another...

568
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,120
One thing real quick, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, real quick, just one thing I just wanted

569
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,560
to mention that was absent from my gaming week, and that was the new download content

570
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,840
for Saints Row the Third, because I am not buying into this bullshit download content

571
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,080
crap that they're putting out these really terrible pieces of...

572
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,080
Ooh, what happened?

573
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,080
It did not good?

574
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,840
Well, the last one they put out was really short, and it was $7 for about an hour's worth

575
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:59,640
of content, and it was just kind of like cheap bullshit.

576
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,640
So I waited.

577
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,960
I waited to hear the reviews on it, and sure enough, someone's like, oh yeah, I beat it

578
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,960
in 30 minutes.

579
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,960
$7 still.

580
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,960
Yes.

581
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,960
Fuck that.

582
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,960
No, I'm not doing it.

583
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,960
That's too bad.

584
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,840
Saints Row had a lot going for it when it first came out.

585
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,400
They kind of ruined it, so...

586
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,400
That's too bad.

587
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,800
All right.

588
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,800
My gaming week.

589
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,280
I also played Touch My Katamari.

590
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,920
I feel similarly to where Loki's at, you know, like, oh yeah, I like Katamari, it's a good

591
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,600
game, but it's been kind of the same damn game.

592
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,480
It's kind of like Sonic the Hedgehog coming out on every platform.

593
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,960
You're like, oh, it's Sonic, I used to love this game, and I'm playing it again, and again,

594
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,580
I'm playing the same game again, and nothing's changed, and now the nostalgia's worn off,

595
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,080
and I think I'm done now.

596
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,080
Yeah.

597
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,920
I also played Sonic the Hedgehog on PlayStation 3 this week, for real.

598
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,080
It was one of the free PlayStation Plus games.

599
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:55,840
PlayStation Plus is having this whole, like, Genesis nostalgia fest thing going on, so

600
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,360
whatever, which is weird, because yes, I have the Sonic Mega Genesis collection, so you

601
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,360
might be thinking, why are you wasting the space on your hard drive to download it?

602
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,000
And my answer is, trophies.

603
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,760
I must have trophies.

604
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,080
So I tried to unlock some trophies, and one game I will say I unlocked a shit ton of trophies

605
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:18,400
in is Altered Beast, which I also played this week, but RISE FROM YOUR GRAVE.

606
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,600
Okay, if there isn't a game that we have seen through thicker rose-colored glasses in our

607
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:29,260
lives, it's Altered Beast, because I'll tell you what, I remember being a kid thinking

608
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:37,640
that game was badass, and it was in the arcade for 25 cents for a few minute thrill, but

609
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:42,120
what they decided to port over on the, you know, PlayStation 3, which granted is the

610
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:49,760
exact same thing they have on Xbox Live Arcade, was the Genesis version, which, at the time,

611
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,880
was great, but now it looks a lot like Pac-Man on the Atari 2600.

612
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:03,200
I mean, it is, it's bad, it's a bad game, and some of the horrible noises it was making

613
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:09,360
made me think my PlayStation 3 was about to spontaneously combust, and I asked you, have

614
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:15,200
any of you actually played Altered Beast to Stage 5 all the way to the last stage of the

615
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,200
game?

616
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,200
Yes.

617
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:24,080
What in the fuck are those unicorn tranny monsters that beat me with their high heels?

618
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:29,720
I was like, what is this, I can't even, because like most people, let's be real, we remember

619
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:34,640
Altered Beast to Stage 2 before we ran out of quarters.

620
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:40,840
So you're saying unicorn tranny monsters, they're Altered Beasts.

621
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:48,360
Look, I'm just, before you send in the hate mail and say, no, no, no, no.

622
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,680
I'm finding pictures of them for everybody.

623
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:56,760
I'm telling you, these unicorn monsters are, are, are a little funky, like it's just, what

624
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,760
is this?

625
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,760
Who designed this?

626
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,760
I can't even.

627
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,400
So yeah, I played Altered Beast all the way to the end, got my trophy, then promptly

628
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,240
deleted it from my hard drive because damn, that's a bad game.

629
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:16,800
Um, otherwise, more wow, more Final Fantasy 13 tube and trying to get a little further

630
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,800
in that.

631
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,240
And that's about the extent of my week.

632
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,240
I mean, I did have the Vita.

633
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,920
I literally played Luminous, like nothing but Luminous one night.

634
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,380
I thought Stage 5 was the Rhino monsters.

635
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:30,040
Is there a stage missing in the Genesis version?

636
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:36,280
It's the hell level and you turn into the exact same monster you were in level one.

637
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:42,600
So Tigerclaw in our chatroom at chat.orangelandtranny.com says Altered Beast is in need of a serious

638
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,600
reboot.

639
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,320
I'd be down with that.

640
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,600
A serious reboot.

641
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,600
Yes.

642
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,920
I mean, there's some pretty cool concepts in Altered Beast, but those levels became

643
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,040
laughably easy once you became the Beast.

644
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,120
It's just kind of getting there.

645
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,480
It can be a pain in the ass sometimes.

646
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,020
So all right, anyhow, that's it for my gaming week.

647
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,600
So let's talk about housekeeping.

648
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,080
Join us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, or you can join us on Twitter

649
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,080
as well.

650
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,080
Twitter.com slash O.L.R.

651
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,320
Get in your tweets for tonight's show.

652
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,720
Um, as far as I can tell, we don't have any shows off planned in the next few weeks.

653
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,680
So O.L.R. every Sunday for a little while.

654
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,560
Let's get into some gaming news and what is going on in the gaming world this week.

655
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,040
Loki's going to start it off.

656
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,040
Yes.

657
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,760
So I'm going to start off by talking about, um, one of the, what was it, what project

658
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,760
did they call that?

659
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,680
It was, uh, no, not downpour.

660
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,400
That whole like campaign to get those really awesome.

661
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,400
Operation rainfall.

662
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,400
That's right.

663
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,760
I was thinking downpour, project downpour, that downpour would be the new Silent Hill

664
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,760
title.

665
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,760
Uh, yes.

666
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,760
Operation rainfall.

667
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:56,280
Um, so the last story has been confirmed to be coming to North America in 2012, well,

668
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:03,940
summer 2012, well, June 19th, 2012, um, and it's actually, it's kind of cool.

669
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:08,360
It's not going to be one of those, oh, you have to buy the GameStop directly from Nintendo.

670
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:12,360
It's actually being ported over by XSeed, um, which is probably going to have the easiest

671
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:18,580
localization job ever because it's going to be going from English to English.

672
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:22,360
So that's just money handed right to them basically.

673
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:30,540
Um, so yeah, that'll be coming out later this year and is a pretty epic RPG from Mistwalker.

674
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,960
We have a date for that?

675
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,600
Well, they're saying summer 2012.

676
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,240
What I've seen from XSeed is June 19th, 2012.

677
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,800
That would be summer.

678
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,800
That would be summer.

679
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,900
And just in time for my birthday, yay!

680
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:48,760
So I mean, dates can change, um, but June 19th.

681
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,440
Downpour, by the way, was a Silent Hill game.

682
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,920
I think you got confused there, Rain.

683
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,720
No, I said downpour is the next Silent Hill game that's coming out.

684
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,720
Just looking at the chatroom.

685
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,960
Alan Wake's Silent Hill-ish game.

686
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,960
Yeah, exactly.

687
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,960
Alan Hill.

688
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,960
All right.

689
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,960
Um, hey, what now?

690
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,960
Are you at all interested?

691
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,960
I found the picture, by the way.

692
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,960
Silent Hill game.

693
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,480
Oh, let me see this scary, hold on, we'll come back to that.

694
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,000
Yes.

695
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,400
What are those things?

696
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,400
Chain it to me.

697
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,400
Uh.

698
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,400
I have no idea.

699
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,400
They're trainicorns.

700
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,640
Get that on the Tumblr so the podcast listeners can refer to this.

701
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,320
I'll give it to Ron Med to do it.

702
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,320
Thank you.

703
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,360
Because I want the podcasters, er, podcast-y listeners to be able to see this too if they're

704
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,360
not live.

705
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,720
Anyhow, where were we?

706
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,360
Vita, Silent Hill, I didn't know there was an exclusive Silent Hill game on the Vita.

707
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,360
Really?

708
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,360
Yeah, Book of Memories.

709
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,440
Why did I think that was a different game?

710
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,440
I don't know.

711
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,440
Because there's another one.

712
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,440
Because you're hallucinating.

713
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,920
No, no, no, because there was, like, Chain of Memory, no, not Chain of Memories, that's

714
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,440
the, uh, Kingdom Hearts game.

715
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,060
No, there was another, there was another game, though, that was something of Memories that

716
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:51,600
was for Silent Hill, so it's a very similar title to another one.

717
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,600
Um.

718
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,600
But yeah.

719
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,600
So that'll be coming out.

720
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,760
Uh, sure, I'll, I'll at least check it out.

721
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,240
I think I'm gonna need to rent a lot of these games.

722
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,840
I don't have the money to buy all these games.

723
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,840
Maybe I'll have a demo.

724
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,840
Ah, there you go.

725
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,840
That'll be fair.

726
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,840
Um.

727
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,480
I wanted to say, though, about the last story.

728
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,240
A, I'm excited because I think Mistwalker games are pretty good.

729
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,200
Um, you know, Blue Dragon was, eh, I know Jamie's more into it than I am.

730
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,800
Lost Odyssey was criminally underrated on the 360, so I'm, I'm, you know, the, a happy

731
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,240
medium between those would still be pretty good.

732
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,240
So I, I'm looking forward to the last story on the Wii, and I'm really excited.

733
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:29,040
I don't have to wait frickin' nine months to play it.

734
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:34,880
That love, I love how it's, it's got almost the same font as Final Fantasy, and it's the

735
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,320
last story.

736
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,600
The final fan, I mean, come on, it's like, I didn't even think about a title.

737
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,600
The last story.

738
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,600
Ah, that sounds good.

739
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
You know what?

740
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,600
That reminds me of another game series.

741
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,040
I can't really think of what it is, but.

742
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,180
If the game is that good, I don't even care.

743
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,240
I don't even care.

744
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,240
They could have called it Dinal Dynasty, and I'd still play it.

745
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,640
Oh, for the record.

746
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,640
What?

747
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,800
They're called Dark Unicorns, but this website refers to them as the Ninja Corn.

748
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,120
Dark and fierce.

749
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,120
The Ninja Corn.

750
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,120
The Ninja Corn.

751
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,120
I like, I prefer calling them the Trainicorn.

752
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,120
Alright, anyhow.

753
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,120
Um.

754
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:11,080
So yeah, I'm looking forward to that.

755
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,960
Interesting that Nintendo's not bringing it out themselves.

756
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,040
This is, you know, with Xenoblade, Nintendo's doing it themselves.

757
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,000
So this is where XSeed is doing it.

758
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
And they did what?

759
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
They did like Half Minute Hero.

760
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
They've done a few.

761
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,340
They've done some pretty good RPGs and stuff.

762
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:27,880
So I'm glad it's in their hands, because what makes me really happy, and I was getting into

763
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,360
this on Twitter with somebody, it makes me really happy that XSeed is doing it, because

764
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:36,440
this means no stupid retail exclusive agreements like we see happening with Xenoblade.

765
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,080
And I have faith it'll go pretty well.

766
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:42,160
It really does give me a reason to dust off my Nintendo Wii and check it out.

767
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,220
Especially since you're going to have Xenoblade, and then like two months later you're going

768
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:49,160
to have, you know, the last story.

769
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,280
So I'm looking forward to that.

770
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,280
So.

771
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,680
Sergeant Stubby in our chat room, I love that name, wants to know where is the OLR Tumblr?

772
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,680
Where is the OLR Tumblr?

773
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,680
OrangeLoungeRadio.tumblr.com.

774
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,680
Radio.tumblr.com.

775
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,680
There you go.

776
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,640
We also have a new one called FuckYeahCageMatch.tumblr.com.

777
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:07,120
I don't remember if we said that on the podcast last week or if that was during the final

778
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:11,000
Afterbirth segment, but we do have a new Tumblr called FuckYeahCageMatch, which we will be

779
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,720
uploading songs for those that were saying, I liked it when you guys would play songs

780
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,000
because it helped me learn new music.

781
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,560
But we are also doing, some of our listeners have started a turntable.fm room.

782
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,040
I love turntable.fm.

783
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,320
And we were in there spinning last week.

784
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,320
We were up until one o'clock in the morning.

785
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,320
Our time.

786
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,920
And like freaking East Coast people were still in there.

787
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:33,920
I know.

788
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,920
I was impressed.

789
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:35,920
I was like, I have to sleep at some point.

790
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,440
I don't even have a job and I have to sleep.

791
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,080
What's going on?

792
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,920
All right.

793
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,920
Moving on.

794
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,040
Let's talk about the Wii U a little bit because we mentioned it a little bit earlier in the

795
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,040
show.

796
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,040
Some rumors about the Wii U.

797
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:54,360
Apparently this week, Adweek ran a report, Adweek is, you know, one of those magazines

798
00:43:54,360 --> 00:44:00,080
about what's going on, mentioning that Nintendo is talking to content providers about content

799
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,840
for the Wii U.

800
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:07,120
So think something like Comcast, because that's one of the companies Nintendo's rumored to

801
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,840
be dealing with right now.

802
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:12,800
Imagine if the whole Comcast on demand thing, or basically the exact same thing they're

803
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,380
putting on the 360, wink, wink, comes over to the Wii U.

804
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,960
That's what Nintendo's looking at.

805
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:21,920
Now I got to say where Nintendo does have a leg up on the 360 right now is the fact

806
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,800
that that tablet controller, that means I can start watching it and you know, I can

807
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,160
see the commercial in my head right now.

808
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,120
That Nintendo commercial in my head right now, they're going to be watching something

809
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,360
on the TV.

810
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,880
And then mom comes in and says, change the channel.

811
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,360
I have to watch Oprah or Oprah's not on anymore.

812
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,560
I have to watch Dr. Oz.

813
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:45,120
And so the kid can take the tablet and continue watching their little show on demand into

814
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,120
the bedroom.

815
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:50,720
As long as that's 30 feet away from the actual console, well, you know, they're going to

816
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,280
stretch the truth a little bit, whatever it is, right?

817
00:44:53,280 --> 00:45:00,560
So I remember, I remember the very, my very first E3 was the year they showed the DS for

818
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,560
the very first time.

819
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:05,080
And I still remember that commercial because that was a big moment.

820
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:11,000
And the commercial for the DS showed a mom and a kid on Picto chat.

821
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,340
And the mom was in the kitchen Picto chatting.

822
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,880
It's time to come downstairs for breakfast.

823
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,360
And the kid was like, okay, you know, like they're having a conversation on Picto chat.

824
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,840
And I'm like, this is the most unrealistic thing I've ever seen in my life.

825
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:29,720
Because if that were my house, Rob, get us ready!

826
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,120
And I'd hear it upstairs.

827
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,640
That's how it worked.

828
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:39,280
Or if you're a good parent, please come downstairs.

829
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,500
Or if you're a good parent, you'd have bacon cooking and then you don't need to tell people

830
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:48,240
that there's, you don't even care what kind of, you know, what meal it is.

831
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,320
It's bacon cooking.

832
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:53,160
I'm coming down.

833
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:58,360
In my house, it wouldn't have been anything because my mom lived in another state.

834
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,120
I just fixed my food when I wanted it.

835
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,120
I'm hungry.

836
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,120
Time to make my own dinner.

837
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,640
I had those nights too.

838
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,640
Too busy playing Zelda.

839
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,760
No, for me, it was too busy playing Kirby's Avalanche.

840
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,980
All right, back to the, I don't know how he got to bacon, but leave it to the show from

841
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,280
Nintendo and Comcast.

842
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,000
This doesn't surprise me at all.

843
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,560
Nintendo seems to be following a very similar path to what Xbox 360 has been doing.

844
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,800
And you know, this is where video game systems are headed.

845
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,240
So this is logical.

846
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:33,260
I think what's honestly surprising most people in this whole thing is that Nintendo is actually

847
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:37,660
kind of planning ahead for a lot of this stuff and thinking about this.

848
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:41,520
That's the most surprising part is that, wait, Nintendo wants to be taken really seriously

849
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,520
here.

850
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:47,400
Well, they would be at a huge disadvantage if they have a broken old network like they

851
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,780
have right now.

852
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,760
So yeah, they kind of have to.

853
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,860
Broken and old.

854
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:56,520
They kind of break my old heart.

855
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,520
All right.

856
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,920
I was trying to find a way for it to work.

857
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:01,920
That's right.

858
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,320
Well, Sony had some fail already with the Vita.

859
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:10,320
Their little Facebook app is gone from the store because it's broken.

860
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:18,080
If you tried to log into it, you got an error code of NP-13144-3 and it meant you had to

861
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,640
close the app.

862
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:23,040
So they just took it down and said, we're working on it, but as for when it's going

863
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,640
to be back up, no one said.

864
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,880
It's only some people I think were getting that error.

865
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,880
That's weird.

866
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:28,880
Yeah.

867
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:29,880
I was able to get into Facebook.

868
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:30,880
Okay.

869
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,880
In fact, I'm going to load it right now.

870
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,880
See if it works.

871
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,880
Yeah.

872
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,480
They said that they're going to republish it once it's sorted, but the quote is, currently

873
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,300
there is no timescale for this.

874
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:43,560
We found out that it wasn't stealing enough user data so that we had to tweak it so that

875
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:47,420
it would steal the proper amount of user data that Facebook requires.

876
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:51,280
If downloading this Vita app upgraded me to timeline, I'm going to be so fucking pissed.

877
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:56,120
Because you know how everything on Facebook now is like, we want you to upgrade to timeline.

878
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,840
Turntable tried to do that to me.

879
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,600
I updated the timeline back in September.

880
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:05,960
I actually like the timeline because then I can put neat pictures up at the top.

881
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:11,240
I can't read a timeline because there's some shit on the left, some shit on the right.

882
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:15,280
From a design standpoint, I don't like it.

883
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,320
I'm trying to speak Jamie's language.

884
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:23,660
I have the cutest picture on mine of Dan and the baby.

885
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:25,840
Not my baby.

886
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,960
His cousin's baby.

887
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,800
You want to make that very clear.

888
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,800
It's a cute picture.

889
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,800
Alright.

890
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:37,200
I'm going to change it back to Thrall though, because Thrall a pimp.

891
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,160
It is interesting that they had to pull that app so quickly after it was out, but then

892
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:46,700
again if it was a security problem, okay, but I guess a login problem, I would, oh,

893
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:47,700
there it is.

894
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:48,700
I got the same error too.

895
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:49,700
I guess I can't log in anymore.

896
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:50,700
Hold on.

897
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:51,700
Take a picture of it.

898
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:52,700
Hold on.

899
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:53,700
Oh, wait.

900
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:54,700
No, you can look at it on the Vita.

901
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:55,700
Watch.

902
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:56,700
No.

903
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:57,700
Watch.

904
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,700
Watch.

905
00:48:58,700 --> 00:48:59,700
I just took a picture of the screen just like that.

906
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:00,700
You suck.

907
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:01,700
I just read about that the other day.

908
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:02,700
That's pretty cool.

909
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,600
Now I can tweet that if I want to.

910
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:10,640
I can't email the picture to myself, which would be far too obvious, but anyway, I can

911
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:11,640
tweet it.

912
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,640
Here's another fun fact.

913
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,000
Did you know that your Vita can receive text messages?

914
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I didn't.

915
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Well, you have a 3G one, right?

916
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Uh, yeah.

917
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Yes.

918
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
It can receive text messages.

919
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,640
You won't get any notifications, I think, but you can't send text messages.

920
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:32,320
The reason that is because your Vita has a phone number assigned to it because it has

921
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:36,520
a SIM card and SIM cards have phone numbers assigned to them, so you can actually text

922
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:42,920
your Vita and you'll get a message saying, you know, this is from the operator, like

923
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:43,920
the matrix.

924
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,080
Operator.

925
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,760
I will say this though, I do really like the Twitter app.

926
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:53,320
It's a little bit slow to load some of the tweets compared to the iPhone one, but I got

927
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:57,880
to say the way it's designed is great because I love, it's the first one I've really seen

928
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:01,780
that has those little picture previews right there in the bar, like on the side.

929
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:05,160
So when people post links to pictures or YouTube, you can see it without having to actually

930
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,700
like click on it like you do in the web browser and all that.

931
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:10,640
So I just tweeted it.

932
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,780
I put it on my personal account at SKIE on Twitter, Skye.

933
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:16,600
That's pretty cool.

934
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,200
That is one thing I do kind of like about the Vita, you can kind of do those screenshots

935
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,200
and do that.

936
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:24,560
Jamie trying to get her iPhone hovered just at the right angle above my screen.

937
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:27,860
All right, anyhow, let's move on, more news.

938
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:31,760
Something else that was kind of borked on the PlayStation Vita was that the PlayStation

939
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:37,800
Plus minis that you get actually don't work on the Vita and apparently they're working

940
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:44,240
on fixing that problem, but right now you can't play those free games that you unlock

941
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,320
with the PlayStation Plus membership.

942
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,840
So that's got to suck now, right Rob?

943
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:57,160
Because you got a PlayStation Plus membership to check out some of those minis.

944
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,640
I'm not missing that much.

945
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,320
Okay, I downloaded this one that's free this week.

946
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,320
What is it called?

947
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,800
Like Hungry Giraffe or something like that?

948
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,800
All it is is this big giraffe neck that goes up the screen and you drive it left and right

949
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,120
to pick up fruit.

950
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:15,840
And then like those other things, they're very basic, simple, simple games.

951
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:19,640
For what they are, they're supposed to be basics.

952
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,000
That's why they're minis.

953
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,560
So for what they are, they're not terrible, but I'm not crying over the fact that I can't

954
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,160
play them right now because I know Sony's going to fix it.

955
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,540
You know, this is part of what happens when you have the early adopter.

956
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:34,240
Does it make them look a little stupid for having it happen?

957
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,240
Yeah.

958
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,680
But am I going to throw a fit over it?

959
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,680
No.

960
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,200
I'm going to throw a fit over this and Katamari and the PSP games to keep me busy.

961
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,200
I'll be fine.

962
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,200
All right.

963
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:48,800
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

964
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,640
There's some other timeline haters in our chatroom.

965
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,360
Shadow Charlie says, timeline is garbage.

966
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,160
It's going to be mandatory in a few weeks.

967
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,120
Yeah, I keep hearing about that.

968
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:01,360
I'm not the most enthusiastic Facebook user right now.

969
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,840
Other comments from our chatroom.

970
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:08,480
Brad from our friends at Pod Culture says, Rob, I'm not a fan of the theme of the Twitter

971
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,760
app, but the functionality is nice.

972
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,760
Yeah, it would be nice if you could like change the colors up a little bit or kind of put

973
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,760
your own designs on it.

974
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:16,760
But maybe in a future version.

975
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:17,760
Who knows?

976
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,760
It's still early.

977
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,960
It's not like they can't release a new version later.

978
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:25,200
Bobby Blackwolf says, the only thing I dislike is that the Twitter app won't upload pics

979
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,820
to Twitpik, only to Twitter's official photo thing.

980
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:29,820
That's a good point.

981
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:32,640
You can't really choose your service on the Vita client.

982
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,200
It's all the official one.

983
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:39,960
So I haven't really messed much with that Flickr app either.

984
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,000
That looked a little weird.

985
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,280
I downloaded it and it was really weird.

986
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:48,560
Like I don't really use Flickr, but the way it was organized was kind of weird.

987
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:53,280
I think if I was actually a Flickr user who had a photo stream set up so I could view

988
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,440
friends pictures, it might be a little better.

989
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:01,960
But most of my like picture feeds come through Twitter or I guess Facebook.

990
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,360
So I'm not really a Flickr person.

991
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,020
But I have some people that are really into photography that do it.

992
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:10,680
But I know like with Flickr, man, people will upload like 250 photographs at once.

993
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,040
It's like that would be a lot to have to scroll through.

994
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,280
You know, like here's all my Disneyland pictures, womp.

995
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:22,280
So Tiger Claw reminds us there's no Skype in the Vita.

996
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:26,120
Not yet, but there's also, isn't there that built in party chat thing they have now?

997
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:31,360
They have where you can group message and I think you can use the party chat thing that

998
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,520
I think that's voice chat.

999
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,520
I think so.

1000
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,360
I think it's supposed to work with PlayStation 3, too.

1001
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:40,420
There are some things where the Vita and the PlayStation 3 play each other.

1002
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:42,560
I think Wipeout's one of them.

1003
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,480
Wipeout is one of them.

1004
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:51,020
And you know, it's kind of funny, though, is you know how they have that one cross-play

1005
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:55,320
section where you get all the games that support cross-play?

1006
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:58,640
Wipeout's not on there, which is like, huh?

1007
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,240
Back again, because I was just looking at the store earlier and Wipeout and uh...

1008
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,840
It's Hustle Kings and Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

1009
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,840
Weird.

1010
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,840
Yeah.

1011
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:11,440
And Marvel vs. Capcom 3, I thought the only thing you could do on that was cross-play.

1012
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:17,760
Maybe you can fight other people, but I thought it was just playing the game using the Vita

1013
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,400
as the controller, but I don't know.

1014
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:25,160
I'm sorry, you say cross-play and I think of cross-dressing cosplay.

1015
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,480
Or unicorns and altered beasts?

1016
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,800
No, I mean, I actually think of...

1017
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,800
Anyway.

1018
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:35,720
Alright, anyhow, well, this is something that'll get maybe some cross-play fans and a lot of

1019
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,000
other people very excited this week.

1020
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,200
I know there's a lot of folks in our chat room that are excited about this news.

1021
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:46,140
New Pokemon games, Black 2 and White 2 have been announced.

1022
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:49,400
And a lot of people went, did they run out of colors?

1023
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,000
Like Black 2?

1024
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,240
What is this?

1025
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,240
What is this?

1026
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:56,040
So yeah, we don't really know exactly what it is.

1027
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,280
It's not gray.

1028
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,320
That's what a lot of people were thinking it was gonna be.

1029
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:04,520
And the other huge thing about this, it's not the 3DS.

1030
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,160
It's the DS.

1031
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,680
These are not 3DS games.

1032
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:12,120
These appear to be some type of upgrades or sequels to the existing Pokemon Black and

1033
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,120
White games.

1034
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:17,840
They will be out on the DS regular, which granted the 3DS can play them, in Japan in

1035
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:18,840
June.

1036
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:23,560
Now, there are some North American details, very few, but they're called here.

1037
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:28,960
It's gonna be Pokemon Black version 2 and Pokemon White version 2.

1038
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,160
We'll get details throughout the year.

1039
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,520
So that means we probably won't have it in June.

1040
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,080
I'd imagine this is something they're gonna be targeting for the holidays.

1041
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,740
Again, though, very interesting, it's not 3DS.

1042
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:42,560
And the fact that it's a direct sequel.

1043
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,560
What does that mean?

1044
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,640
Does that mean it's the same world?

1045
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,560
How did they add new Pokemon into it?

1046
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:49,560
How does this work?

1047
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:53,600
But of course I'm not as up and up on my Pokemon, I used to love Pokemon 10 years ago, but I

1048
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,600
don't follow it anymore.

1049
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:59,080
Wouldn't it be hilarious if it was a Game of the Year edition with any additional Pokemon

1050
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,080
that were offered?

1051
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,080
I don't even...

1052
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,280
No, it seems like it's gonna be richer than that.

1053
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:10,540
I saw some forums comparing it to when they upgraded Green to Emerald, but that was also

1054
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:13,560
a system upgrade with that.

1055
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,160
Black and White were on the DS, am I right?

1056
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,440
So there's no system upgrade happening there.

1057
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,080
It would be funny if they weren't on the DS, if they were on the 3DS and then they downgraded

1058
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,080
them.

1059
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:25,880
No, I mean, Black and White, they could have been advanced for all I know, but they weren't.

1060
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,720
They were DS titles.

1061
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:33,640
I honestly truly have not bought a Pokemon game since Sapphire, I think was the last

1062
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,640
one I had.

1063
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,640
I had Pearl.

1064
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,640
Yeah, so...

1065
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,640
Ugh.

1066
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:43,600
Uh, Rama suggests instead of version 2, just call it V2.

1067
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,720
Why couldn't they have just done Pokemon Ebony and Pokemon Ivory?

1068
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,000
I mean, they could have just named it something...

1069
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,680
And then they could have had that song.

1070
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,160
Dan was expecting Pokemon Gray.

1071
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,000
I think a lot of people were.

1072
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:01,640
I even heard somebody saying Gray and Gray, like G-R-E and G-R-A. Why?

1073
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:02,640
Which would have been weird.

1074
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,440
Why don't they just do one called Pokemans?

1075
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,440
That's it.

1076
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,440
Or how about...

1077
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,440
Pokemon Rainbow!

1078
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,440
Pokemon 3D!

1079
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,840
Done.

1080
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:15,920
Because we have Colosseum and...

1081
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,600
Would y'all be that tore up if they just ditched the color thing?

1082
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,360
Maybe you would, I don't know.

1083
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:26,680
But you know what, if there are more Pokemans to be had, there will be people buying these

1084
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:27,680
games.

1085
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:28,680
Touch them, love them.

1086
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:29,680
That's right.

1087
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,680
Touch them, love them.

1088
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,000
And you never know what type of, like, internet things they might try to build into this or

1089
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
whatever.

1090
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Where's my Pokemon MMO?

1091
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,700
Maybe that's what's happening on the 3DS here, right?

1092
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,200
Someone tried to do that and they got sued.

1093
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,040
Of course they did!

1094
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,040
Nintendo, what's your money?

1095
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:49,320
S-H-A-100, Matt in our chatroom at chat.orangetonstrategy.com says, doesn't matter what platform it's on,

1096
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,800
it will make millions.

1097
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:55,480
Raginator says, no Pokemon Fuchsia?

1098
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,480
Pokemon Checkerboard?

1099
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,480
It said Pokemon Clear.

1100
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,960
How about Pokemon Peaceful Meadow?

1101
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,120
Pokemon Bloody Tampon.

1102
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,120
Stop it.

1103
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,120
Moving on.

1104
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,560
None of them know what we're talking about.

1105
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,120
It's for the best.

1106
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,120
Good.

1107
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:14,160
Well, how about that Double Fine adventure thing?

1108
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,520
They want it to be 2D.

1109
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:22,760
In fact, there's a quote on here that said they're working with Nathan Stapley, who is

1110
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,760
a painter.

1111
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:28,920
And they said that they wanted to do it sort of a paint style, you know, paint the backgrounds

1112
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:34,080
and hand paint the characters and animate them that way.

1113
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:42,600
Which, it would be, if you're gonna do a 2D game, typically it has to be pixel based.

1114
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:47,620
If you're going to do something that's gonna flow like paint, it's gonna have to still

1115
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:52,960
have a 3D element to it for that level of animation, unless it's all vector based.

1116
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:58,320
And then to do that is a little bit different too, because vector graphics are gonna need

1117
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:10,040
to have a screen capable of displaying mathematically calculated vectors, where most games are gonna

1118
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:14,140
need some type of raster thing to view it, right?

1119
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:18,920
So I don't think that's gonna be possible unless they do it some sort of shaded 3D.

1120
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:22,120
But the thing on here, and I'm gonna read this quote, one of the things I missed about

1121
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:27,920
2D graphic adventures is that you would be able to have a great artist expressing themselves

1122
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,160
directly on screen, not having to go through 3D shaders or any of the complicated technology

1123
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,160
might change or alter their vision.

1124
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:38,960
I just don't think it's gonna be possible without, for what they're describing, it's

1125
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:44,320
not gonna be possible to do it in a pixel based format.

1126
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,000
I don't think so.

1127
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,360
But for all those people that pre-ordered it, which is, you know, what we've been calling

1128
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:53,000
Kickstarter on Bobby's show earlier this evening when he was talking to us at the end of the

1129
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,760
show there, we were talking about how Kickstarter is basically the new pre-ordering.

1130
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,120
They'll get to see the whole journal and if it works or not.

1131
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,120
Yeah.

1132
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,120
It'll be interesting.

1133
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:09,200
I mean, now I'm trying to think in terms of pixel graphics at high definition, and possibly,

1134
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:14,360
but it's gonna be a monster for memory.

1135
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,560
It would just be a monster for memory.

1136
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:21,200
So you would really have to be careful to make it work.

1137
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,800
Let's travel around the world and check out some games that will be coming out a whole

1138
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,160
lot sooner than this Double Fine game.

1139
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,540
As in this week, Loki.

1140
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:30,120
There's a few things coming out of this week.

1141
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:33,400
Poke Park 2 wonders beyond for the Nintendo Wii.

1142
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,000
Well there's something for the Pokemon, people!

1143
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
You can have it right now!

1144
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
There you go.

1145
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
What the fuck is Poke Park?

1146
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,040
Yeah, Poke Park is basically- Do we get to poke them with the Wiimote?

1147
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:47,760
No, it's like kind of a spinoff of the Pokemon series where you play as Pikachu and you go

1148
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,880
through some crappy adventure with Pokemon.

1149
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:51,880
Sounds like a kid's game.

1150
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:52,880
Yeah.

1151
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:53,880
Alright.

1152
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:54,880
Pretty much.

1153
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,840
And then, also this week, we have Lord of the Rings Online, the Myth Roll Edition, which

1154
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,800
is a prior re-release there.

1155
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,560
Binary Domain on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 from Sega.

1156
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:09,440
Order Up on the PlayStation 3 with Move Support from Ignition.

1157
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,320
Order Up is kind of like cooking mama on the Wii.

1158
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:17,880
Country Dance All Stars for the Xbox 360 and Kinect.

1159
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:27,440
Hyperdimension Neptunia MK2, the game where you play, I guess, game consoles turned into

1160
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,920
anime chicks.

1161
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:33,440
That's from Tecmo Koei.

1162
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:40,120
And this week, Mortal Kombat The Complete Edition with all the DLC included plus a voucher

1163
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:44,380
for the very first Mortal Kombat movie and the soundtrack.

1164
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:46,680
That's on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1165
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:49,840
Alan secretly wants me to get that.

1166
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:50,840
This game...

1167
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:51,840
Why?

1168
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:52,840
I already own Mortal Kombat.

1169
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:53,840
This game looks pretty awesome.

1170
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:58,200
One I'm kind of looking forward to this week, SSX on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and finally

1171
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:02,880
for the Nintendo DS, Shin Megami Tensei Devil Survivor 2.

1172
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,000
Let's go to Japan and look at the releases over there.

1173
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:10,600
On March 1st, UFC Undisputed 3 comes out on the Xbox 360 and that's really the only release

1174
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:13,760
on the Xbox 360 of note this week.

1175
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:23,560
On the, excuse me, on March 1st on the PlayStation 3, we have One Piece Kaizuko Musou.

1176
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:26,940
I don't think that's somebody actually wearing a One Piece.

1177
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:27,940
This is...

1178
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:28,940
Dynasty Warriors of One Piece.

1179
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:29,940
One Piece is an anime.

1180
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:30,940
Aha.

1181
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:31,940
So there it is.

1182
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:32,940
Yeah.

1183
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:33,940
Historical Heroes.

1184
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:34,940
It's like a clash.

1185
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:35,940
It's a beat-em-up game.

1186
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:36,940
They're stretchy pirates.

1187
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:37,940
Yeah.

1188
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:44,160
On top of that, there's a bad guy in there who has like this spear, uh, uh, what's it

1189
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,160
called?

1190
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:46,700
Uh, slingshot.

1191
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:49,440
And I just saw a video today of where someone actually made it and it works.

1192
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,440
I will say this.

1193
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:54,280
I'm noticing like, you know, it has kind of a Street Fighter 4-esque art style to it,

1194
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:59,160
but I'm noticing like in some shots, the anime characters look really interesting being brought

1195
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,160
to life.

1196
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,560
That's exactly what the character looks like in the manga.

1197
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:06,120
If you're interested in that style of gameplay, you should really check out the Cyber Connect

1198
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,160
2 stuff, like the Naruto games.

1199
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,640
They are gorgeous.

1200
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:12,680
They're just like, it's like, holy crap, anime alive.

1201
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:13,680
You know what's funny?

1202
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:19,320
I have an issue of Shonen Jump from 1992 with the original One Piece and Dragon Ball Z in

1203
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:20,320
it.

1204
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,320
Nice.

1205
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:22,320
Old, huh?

1206
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:24,960
Why do I do Japanese releases on this show?

1207
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,640
Because I don't know any of this, but I guess that's a funny thing.

1208
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:28,640
All right.

1209
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:29,640
I will say that that game...

1210
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,640
You're being ironic, Rob.

1211
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:38,440
The game is big enough where they're releasing a PlayStation 3 themed console slash game included

1212
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:39,440
whole thing with that.

1213
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,440
Oh yeah.

1214
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,440
One Piece is big.

1215
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:42,440
So yeah.

1216
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:43,880
And that's actually a pretty sweet looking PlayStation 3.

1217
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:44,880
Look at that.

1218
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:49,200
It's like this, it's this brown tan, which I know doesn't...

1219
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,200
Like copper bronze.

1220
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,200
Copper.

1221
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,200
I like, yeah, copper.

1222
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,200
It's more like a copper color.

1223
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,240
And it has the like artwork on the PS3.

1224
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:56,240
What is it?

1225
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:57,240
Like Luffy or something?

1226
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:58,240
That's pretty sweet, actually.

1227
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,240
I think it...

1228
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:00,240
Isn't that his name?

1229
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,240
Mm-hmm.

1230
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:02,240
Yeah.

1231
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:06,360
Like if I was at all interested in having a Japanese PlayStation 3, that would be one

1232
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,360
of the ones to get.

1233
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:08,360
I got...

1234
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:11,840
Man, they get some really sweet custom PS3s over there because it seems like every month

1235
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:12,840
there's something.

1236
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:13,840
I miss the...

1237
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:16,760
Remember when they had the Sakura PS2 that was actually kind of a purple color?

1238
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:17,760
I do.

1239
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:18,760
That was cool.

1240
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:19,760
Mm-hmm.

1241
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:20,760
I'm sorry.

1242
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:21,760
I still...

1243
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:25,760
My original Xbox is that Halo Xbox, which not a lot of people had.

1244
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,760
So is mine.

1245
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:27,760
Oh yeah?

1246
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:28,760
You guys had it too?

1247
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:29,760
I have it too.

1248
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:33,640
You know we've got like three different versions of the Xbox 360.

1249
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:36,840
Oh yeah, yeah.

1250
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,440
Because we had to ship them all back because the red rings went off.

1251
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,000
Anyway, back to the release dates.

1252
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:47,000
On Nintendo 3DS, Doraemon has a game, Nobita no Kiseki no Shima.

1253
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,800
And Mario and Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games comes out in Japan.

1254
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,280
There's a demo for that on the marketplace right now, at least in America.

1255
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,400
I'm pretty sure it's on the Japanese one as well.

1256
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,620
And that's really it.

1257
01:04:57,620 --> 01:05:00,120
I don't see a whole lot else coming out this week.

1258
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,280
Kind of a slower week in Japan.

1259
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,720
Well it's even slower in the UK.

1260
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:11,600
On March 2nd, we have Mario Party 9 for the Wii, Mortal Kombat Complete Edition for 360

1261
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,640
and PS3 and SSX.

1262
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,560
That's it.

1263
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:17,520
All right.

1264
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:20,680
I guess everybody's preoccupied with the Vita or something.

1265
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:21,680
All right, Loki.

1266
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:22,680
They must be.

1267
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:28,400
I mean, I can't think of any other thing they could be occupied with.

1268
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,400
Here's something interesting.

1269
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:34,080
And I think we've talked a little bit about how some of these companies like Microsoft

1270
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:40,400
and Sony are trying to emulate other companies.

1271
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,600
Recently it's been kind of these Wii U tablet things.

1272
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:53,160
Well a new one is Sony has patented a new Kinect-like PlayStation Eye camera that's

1273
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:57,720
going to have some sort of backwards compatibility with the PlayStation Eye stuff right now,

1274
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:58,720
which I guess it could.

1275
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:03,460
Because I think the PlayStation Eye camera is just pretty much a camera.

1276
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:08,080
But they said the filing calls for a real-time, three-dimensional interactive environment

1277
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:11,240
using a depth sensing device.

1278
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:15,040
Users would move in front of and interact with.

1279
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:21,400
And also it says in body minutes of present invention provided real-time interactive gaming

1280
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,240
experiences for users.

1281
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:30,480
For example, users can interact with various computer-generated objects in real time.

1282
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:34,340
That definitely sounds like the Kinect.

1283
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:37,880
What happened to the move?

1284
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:42,640
Where did that go?

1285
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:49,040
I really want them to come out with a controller-less thing and go, well you need buttons.

1286
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:50,720
Buttons are where it's at.

1287
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:51,800
Button button button.

1288
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:56,520
And then honestly I think they should have both.

1289
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:05,120
I think that perhaps the PlayStation Eye camera is just not really good at capturing the rest

1290
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:12,800
of your body aside from moving the controller around, the PlayStation Eye or the move stuff.

1291
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:13,800
So maybe that's what it is.

1292
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:18,280
It's like an upgrade to the PlayStation Eye camera that's going to be used in conjunction

1293
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,040
with the PlayStation Move stuff.

1294
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:23,880
So that you have your buttons, you have your controller inputs and stuff like that, plus

1295
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:26,520
you have the rest of your body capturing stuff.

1296
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:32,240
That's all I can figure it is because it doesn't mention anything about upgrading the move

1297
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,240
stuff.

1298
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:38,680
Well you know we're getting at this point in the year where we've got to be asking ourselves,

1299
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:41,940
so what's E3 going to look like this year?

1300
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:44,200
We know what Nintendo is doing.

1301
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:49,120
We can have a pretty good idea that Sony is going to be doing a little more with the Vita

1302
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:52,820
and some of its big games for the rest of the year, but what are they going to mention

1303
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:56,440
with the PS3?

1304
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:57,440
What's the next big thing with the PlayStation?

1305
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:03,840
And the one I really want to know about is Microsoft, what do they got going this year?

1306
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:10,720
I'm going to assume Halo 4 is going to really dominate their press conference, but what

1307
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:11,720
else?

1308
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:16,800
What about, you know, it's kind of the question I wanted answered last year.

1309
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:21,800
I think what is the, now show me how Kinect is really going to change my life.

1310
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:26,080
Well for like their press conferences go, you're going to probably see something, I'm

1311
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:29,440
going to be willing to bet that they're going to show Call of Duty, whatever the new Call

1312
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:32,720
of Duty is, it's going to be a big portion of their thing, because they're probably going

1313
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:36,360
to have exclusive DLC again, or exclusive window on DLC.

1314
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:40,400
I bet you they're going to show something about Grand Theft Auto 5, which they're probably

1315
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:47,680
going to have exclusive DLC on that, much like they did with the 4 franchise.

1316
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:56,320
And then, oh, there's a new Assassin's Creed game coming out, maybe they'll show something

1317
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:57,320
on that.

1318
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:00,840
I think as far as first party stuff goes, I mean, Gears of War, I don't know if there's

1319
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:04,840
going to be a new Gears of War game this year, I mean, I don't.

1320
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:10,680
I'd be really curious at Sony's press conference to see if Final Fantasy XIV returns, because

1321
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:16,340
we're looking at this very interesting thing that's never happened in gaming before that

1322
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:24,280
I can think of, where the launch of the game on PC was so fucked that they have redone

1323
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:28,680
the entire game with this whole 2.0 thing, and the version that's supposed to come out

1324
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:31,680
on PlayStation 3 is the 2.0 game.

1325
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:36,520
They're just going to pretend that 1.0 basically didn't happen, and then the PC and the PS3

1326
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:37,840
will be merged together.

1327
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:42,000
So I'm very curious to see if they get up there on that stage and say, Final Fantasy

1328
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:49,360
XIV is coming out on the PlayStation 3 in a new version developed for the PlayStation

1329
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:54,200
3, or whatever the fuck they embellish it with.

1330
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:57,680
Because they were so excited when they had it as the exclusive, remember a couple years

1331
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:58,680
ago?

1332
01:09:58,680 --> 01:09:59,680
Not so excited anymore.

1333
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:03,960
Oh shit, we still have to put this game out?

1334
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:06,580
Versus XIII could be a thing though.

1335
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:08,840
Versus XIII is still, you know.

1336
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:10,800
That could be awesome.

1337
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:17,220
I just, I don't know, right now they've been pretty good about keeping secrets so far.

1338
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:18,480
We still got a few more months.

1339
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,480
That's right.

1340
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:20,920
That's right, let the hype begin.

1341
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:24,640
Alright, well speaking of letting the hype begin, this is certainly interesting.

1342
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:28,800
Ok, so Nintendo had the press conference this week where we mentioned a lot of the news.

1343
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,880
By the way, I gotta do a quick tangent.

1344
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,800
I gotta say this is pretty clever.

1345
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:37,520
I woke up the other morning and my little swap note button is lit, meaning I have a

1346
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:40,140
new message on the 3DS swap note.

1347
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:42,680
And I was like, oh yay, somebody sent me another 3D cat picture.

1348
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:44,520
Because that's pretty much all I ever get on swap note.

1349
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:45,520
Or fish.

1350
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:47,640
Now I've been getting fish this week.

1351
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:52,020
So I open it up and it's a message from Reggie Fils-Aime on my swap note.

1352
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:54,360
And it even goes, hi, this is Reggie from Nintendo.

1353
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:56,880
Because you can do like a little five second audio clip.

1354
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,600
And it's Reggie's little me.

1355
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:06,240
And it says, join me tomorrow at 6am, lol, for a Nintendo Direct announcement.

1356
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:10,080
And I even showed it to Alan and we were both kind of like, you know, that is a pretty clever

1357
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,640
way to spam.

1358
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:16,820
And it even unlocked that stationary for use with other swap note stuff.

1359
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:19,880
So it was like, hey, Nintendo spammed me, but I got something out of it.

1360
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:23,160
Got a new stationary for my next cat picture.

1361
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:27,120
Anyhow, so as part of this whole Nintendo Direct conference, they of course mentioned

1362
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:31,040
the last story, which, you know, Loki said they would do at some point.

1363
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,880
Come out, you know, I think you said they'd do it last year, but they're going to come

1364
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:34,880
out and say...

1365
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:35,880
No, I thought they were going to do it in E3.

1366
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:36,880
In E3, yeah, well.

1367
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:37,880
And then I said PAX.

1368
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:39,640
Wait, are we still missing one?

1369
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:40,640
There's still one.

1370
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,720
There's no Pandora's Tower, but it's coming out in Europe.

1371
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:43,920
We talked last week.

1372
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:49,360
Europe's got a date.

1373
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:52,960
This is happening because the Wii's not even going to get a mention of this year's E3.

1374
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,400
It's all about the Wii U.

1375
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:57,040
They have to get people excited for the Wii U.

1376
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,040
They have to.

1377
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:03,920
Anyhow, 3DS, they'll still say some stuff on the 3DS.

1378
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:08,040
And this might be something you see more about at E3 this year.

1379
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:11,520
All we got was a hint this week at the Nintendo Direct Conference.

1380
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:20,160
Capcom, Bandai Namco, and Sega are all working on something.

1381
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:21,160
That's it.

1382
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:24,320
And apparently there's a little teaser site.

1383
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:25,320
I don't know.

1384
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:26,320
This is the first time I'm seeing this.

1385
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:27,320
This is a Japanese site.

1386
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:30,440
I apologize in advance if this auto-plays music, but I didn't even realize it had its

1387
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:31,440
own teaser site.

1388
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:35,000
Because what in the fuck are they going to show?

1389
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,240
What is this supposed to be?

1390
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:40,240
Oh, is this like one of those frickin' oh, um...

1391
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:41,240
It's an elevator.

1392
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:42,240
No, it's a...

1393
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:43,240
What do they call those games?

1394
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:44,240
Oh, uh, um, ARG.

1395
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:45,240
ARG.

1396
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:46,240
Oh no.

1397
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:59,880
So they punched in a little code and now we see Steam and we see the three logos, so...

1398
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:01,880
And Bonpresto up in the corner.

1399
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:02,880
Who knows?

1400
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,440
That could be anything.

1401
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:10,440
Maybe they all are also working on the next Super Smash Brothers.

1402
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:15,120
And you're going to have Mega Man and Pac-Man and Sonic all doing it.

1403
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:18,720
It'll be bad art man, bad box art Mega Man.

1404
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:19,720
Ha ha ha.

1405
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:20,720
You don't get it.

1406
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:23,520
A lot of people's minds are going straight to a fighting game.

1407
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:24,520
Which makes sense.

1408
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:25,520
That's what we've seen a lot of Cross.

1409
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,560
Street Fighter, Cross, Tekken, Cross, Dead or Alive.

1410
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,080
Was Dead or Alive a Sega game?

1411
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,080
No maybe not.

1412
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,080
Team Ninja.

1413
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,080
No that's Team Ninja.

1414
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,080
Uh, Sega.

1415
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,080
Virtua Fighter.

1416
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:37,080
Virtua Fighter?

1417
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,080
I don't think so.

1418
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,080
No.

1419
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:40,080
I don't think so.

1420
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,080
Virtua Pac Fighter.

1421
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,080
You know what?

1422
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:49,760
Okay, I just want to remind everybody, Win Namco and Sega and Nintendo worked together

1423
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:50,760
before.

1424
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:56,000
That was the F-Zero arcade game.

1425
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,760
Just throwing it out there.

1426
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,960
Maybe they're going to let Capcom have their share.

1427
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:01,960
I don't know.

1428
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:04,400
A fanboy can dream.

1429
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,000
Capcom doesn't have any.

1430
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,520
So if you want that.

1431
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:09,520
So it's going to be.

1432
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:10,520
Exactly.

1433
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:11,520
Capcom doesn't have a racer franchise.

1434
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:12,520
No no no no no.

1435
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:13,520
You're wrong.

1436
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:14,520
They do have a racer franchise.

1437
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:15,520
What do they have?

1438
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:16,520
It would be.

1439
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:17,520
Here's what it would be.

1440
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:26,360
It would be Daytona, Cross, Ridge Racer, Cross, MotoGP because that's the Capcom franchise.

1441
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:27,360
Get out.

1442
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,360
Get out.

1443
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:29,360
In space.

1444
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:32,800
In space.

1445
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,200
You get nothing.

1446
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,480
You lose.

1447
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:40,000
Good day sir.

1448
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,920
They really need to do a new excite truck.

1449
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:42,920
No.

1450
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:43,920
For an intent.

1451
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:44,920
Let it go.

1452
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:45,920
That would sell me.

1453
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:46,920
That would sell me a Wii U.

1454
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:47,920
A new excite truck.

1455
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:48,920
I'm telling you.

1456
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:54,160
If they announce a new excite truck for the 3DS, I will be pissed.

1457
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,040
I will be.

1458
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:57,640
What the fuck.

1459
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:58,640
They're not.

1460
01:14:58,640 --> 01:14:59,640
You understand.

1461
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:00,640
They won't.

1462
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:01,640
You're fine.

1463
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:02,640
They're fine.

1464
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:03,640
They're not.

1465
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:04,640
They're not.

1466
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:05,640
They're not.

1467
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:06,640
They're not.

1468
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:07,640
They're already poo poo'd on that franchise.

1469
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:08,640
They're not.

1470
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:09,640
Excite bots Loki.

1471
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:10,640
That's what you got.

1472
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:11,640
You got excite bots.

1473
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:12,640
What?

1474
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:13,640
Virtua caliber.

1475
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:14,640
Alright.

1476
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:15,640
I really want to slap whoever you know what Nintendo is like, hey you know what racing

1477
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:16,640
games need?

1478
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,640
Mini games in the middle of the fucking race.

1479
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:19,820
That's fantastic.

1480
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:20,820
Yeah.

1481
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:23,160
Mini games.

1482
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:27,520
Let's go back to a time when games were simpler.

1483
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:28,520
Not this one.

1484
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:34,920
We call the classic game of the week back when game companies. They didn't work together. They all hated each other's guts

1485
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:41,880
In fact there was a big rivalry between Sierra online and

1486
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:45,240
Lucasfilm games

1487
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:48,420
Actually, I don't know if there really was that big of a rivalry. I just made that up

1488
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,760
What's a classic game of the week Dark Sakura Luma?

1489
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:58,560
Which is one of my favorite games excellent pick by the way. I have surprised. I hadn't done it before but I

1490
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:01,480
Love the music in this game

1491
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:08,400
At any rate loom was put out by Lucasfilm games, which is now Lucasarts and

1492
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:14,280
It was the fourth game. That was the use the scum engine

1493
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:22,240
I still like saying the scum engine and was led by Brian Moriarty who was the guy who gave a swish bringer Trinity and beyond

1494
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:23,400
Zork

1495
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,400
just saying

1496
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:29,680
So actually it's on Steam now. You can play the loom on Steam, and it's like five bucks really

1497
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:31,680
I didn't know that yeah, I have it on Steam nice

1498
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:33,880
So it's an adventure game

1499
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:39,680
And it's really different because it's a big fantasy story set in the future

1500
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:45,520
And it its interface is actually very different for its time, so basically with the game

1501
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:49,640
is that you play a little guy named Bob and thread bear who has a distaff and

1502
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,280
You can play a spell

1503
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:55,080
that it's

1504
01:16:55,080 --> 01:17:00,400
Musical like one of them is called opening or you have night vision or sharpening. It's different. It's a different

1505
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:04,560
type of song that you can play they're called drafts and

1506
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:10,600
And you can reverse them by playing them backwards so like for example the dry one

1507
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:17,680
Like die sorry like it like the dying thread you play backward it becomes a beach or instead of

1508
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:22,280
Terror I guess is calming anyway

1509
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:28,520
But at first when you only play the game you only have the note C D and E and as you get through it you

1510
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:32,080
Actually get a full scale on the C scale. It's like an ocarina

1511
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,080
except

1512
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:42,360
So basically when it it actually just followed the LucasArts game design philosophy

1513
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:47,080
Where a character will never be killed or forced to restart the game and won't have to spend hours

1514
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:52,940
Typing in synonyms until they get it so basically has different

1515
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:55,580
difficulty levels you have

1516
01:17:55,580 --> 01:18:02,560
Like an easy to an expert level and the expert level actually doesn't have any of the notes marked on the staff

1517
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:04,560
You have to play it by ear

1518
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:12,960
But you do have a different graphic sequences that play after that and that's only on the original version

1519
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:18,560
But the DOS CD-ROM version has a different graphics to it, too

1520
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:24,520
So anyway, the drafts are the same way spells work like I said, you've got different ones that do different things and

1521
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:31,720
When you also have this thing on the island that Bobbin lives on called the great loom

1522
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:38,440
And it's a loom island and it can echo the last draft that was spun in its presence

1523
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:43,600
So the only ones that can't are the ones that Bobbin did by himself

1524
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,800
So you can't really forget a draft that you do

1525
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:50,560
You'll learn everything in the presence of the loom

1526
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:56,360
I'm sending so basically it's got like a really in-depth story to this this audio

1527
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:59,480
Play came with it. That was

1528
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,480
It was like a cassette that had all of this

1529
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:12,200
Prequel story leading up to it about how the game is going to end and how the game is going to end

1530
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:17,280
Prequel story leading up to it about, you know, how it's in. Let me see if I can find the the world

1531
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:21,000
It's in the future. It's in 8021 and

1532
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:29,760
Basically people have dissolved into different types of guilds and the weavers have decided to form this great loom that

1533
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,800
controls all of reality

1534
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:36,320
Except they stopped being able to have kids. So this one woman named Signe Threadbear

1535
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:40,080
Sneaks past them and

1536
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,080
Actually

1537
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:50,360
Weaves a gray thread into the great loom and out of it comes an infant and they turn her into a swan and

1538
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:57,120
This one other woman decides to raise Bobbin this is starting to sound like a Bjork video

1539
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:00,200
It's awesome

1540
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:06,160
But anyway, the the elders are actually named after the three fates of Greek mythology

1541
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:08,160
Um

1542
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,960
They

1543
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:16,640
As things happen the the woman who raises Bobbin and I'm trying to find her name

1544
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:21,040
I think it was like hat hatch something. It's been a while. I'm trying to see if I can find it in the article

1545
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,840
but

1546
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:30,000
This woman who ends up raising him Oh Dame Hetchel, that was her name who was a serving woman

1547
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:35,680
She ends up teaching Bobbin how to weave drafts

1548
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:42,040
Which he wasn't supposed to learn until he turned 17. And so she gets turned into a swan, too

1549
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:44,920
or no, she gets turned into a

1550
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,800
Different kind of bird but as it goes on basically

1551
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:53,800
Everyone on the island gets turned into a swan and they fly off and the only one left is Bobbin

1552
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:56,160
So he's trying to figure out what's going on

1553
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:58,160
So

1554
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:04,000
Yeah, she gets turned as the swan appears and cast a spell on all of the villagers

1555
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:09,080
So all the weavings except Bobbin are turned into swans and it turns out that you know this one I think it's his mother

1556
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,120
so

1557
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:13,460
this

1558
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:18,560
cleric actually takes the weavers to staff to take over the world with an army of undead and

1559
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:24,040
And basically Bobbin gets it and has to go on to fight chaos

1560
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:31,520
With Bobbin coming into the world like it weaved chaos into the world. So it was

1561
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:36,160
Like I said a very in-depth story

1562
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:40,120
So there were actually sequels that were planned after the game came out

1563
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:44,920
one of them was gonna call be called Forge that had starred rusty nail bender as

1564
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:48,120
Who was one of

1565
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:55,960
Bobbins friends and then another game called the fold that was a fleece firm flanks

1566
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:58,160
I think that's a funny name firm flanks

1567
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:03,960
Who was gonna work a character in a John John Waters movie? Well, he was he's one of the shepherds

1568
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,960
but he was gonna work with rusty and

1569
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:11,320
It actually loom sold a lot of copies, but

1570
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:16,320
The only reason that the sequels never came out was because basically he wanted to work on other things

1571
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:20,600
Nobody else wanted to do him. So it just sort of fell apart. They were ideas

1572
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:27,640
as far as getting the game it originally came out on for DOS on an EGA floppy disk and

1573
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:31,520
then it came out to the Amiga the Atari ST the Mac and

1574
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:33,760
TurboGrafx-16

1575
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:39,680
Which actually was a much better version than the other versions. I did not know the TurboGrafx-16 had one

1576
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:44,840
fair game in town was selling a copy for 60 bucks and I wanted it so

1577
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:50,920
Wow, and Dan's like you already have a game because I have the PC CD and I have it on Steam

1578
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:59,120
But anyway, like I said Loon came out later on CD-rom for the FM towns computer and it was a VGA

1579
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:02,560
Enhanced and had a digital soundtrack

1580
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:04,400
so

1581
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:11,920
Everything was so much better on it. It was beautiful. And then a third version came out on CD-rom for DOS in 1992 that were

1582
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:18,780
Really really souped up and it I had the talking in it like we got some samples of the voice

1583
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:24,440
Yes, we do had voice acting in it. Let's go to this is just right at the beginning here. Yeah

1584
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:28,360
So Bobin's walking along

1585
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:33,400
Ouch. He gets hit by a rabbit. Bird steals a rabbit.

1586
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:43,060
Destiny shall draw the lightning down from heaven roll its thunder far across the sea

1587
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:48,240
To where I wait upon the shore of wonder on the day

1588
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:52,120
The sky is opened and the tree is split asunder

1589
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:55,240
So you get like this when you read different things

1590
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:57,240
so

1591
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:00,120
And you've got voice acting in it, okay

1592
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,360
But this actually was the first talking scum game that came out and

1593
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:10,480
it had though a lot of the dialogue was rewritten and

1594
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:15,480
That's just because they had to edit space they needed the space

1595
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:20,400
So

1596
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:26,020
They had different solutions to some of the puzzles and different close-ups on the dialogues and different

1597
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:32,080
Graphics that were included with it and this was considered to be the definitive version of Loom

1598
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:41,440
Also, there was a rumor that said that Orson Scott Card helped make of the original version

1599
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:44,680
Not true. In fact, he even said not true

1600
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:52,280
But he did help revise the game's dialogue. So he did contribute to the later version of the game the 1992 version and

1601
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:57,520
You can't get the DOS CD-ROM version anymore

1602
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:03,280
Because of an agreement with Mindscape for licensing. Mindscape is no longer in business by the way

1603
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:11,300
So the only way that you can play the original versions of it really is by having the scum VM virtual machine

1604
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:13,500
although

1605
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:17,240
You can't play the FM towns version. What about the whole steam thing?

1606
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:22,200
Let me get to that. This is like the original discs my bad. Okay versions

1607
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:25,720
Now the voice to CD-ROM version

1608
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:31,000
is available for on Steam for PC and Mac and

1609
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,760
There is a

1610
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:42,800
The community actually the steam community has made a method to play the FM town version with the steam version of Loom

1611
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:49,520
So it's there so like as you can hear some of the music has a search from Swan Lake because of the big swan theme

1612
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:53,320
In it and the MIDI version was arranged by the fat man. That's what he was called

1613
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:59,320
Others are there are you know full CD versions they're sequenced versions

1614
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:06,320
It was at the time it really supported all kinds of the different graphics not graphics audio processors that came out that were out at the time

1615
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:20,320
and like I said with the package it had an audio tape that had a 30 minute drama that had the nature and the history of the Loom world and about Bobin being born and so the game is a continuation of the story that came on the cassette and

1616
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:24,320
Had original music that was composed by Jerry Gerber and

1617
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:36,320
The actors who were in that reprised their roles for the talkie version most of them did so it really keeps up with that continuity and it was the first commercial cassette that used the Dolby S noise reduction

1618
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:42,320
and it also said that the side a was encoded for Dolby B playback and

1619
01:26:42,320 --> 01:27:04,320
B the side B was the Dolby S playback so it had an illustrated notebook of the book of patterns which you know basically all the apprentice weavers in the game were given that type of thing and had different descriptions in there different had spaces that you could write down your what you learned in the game and

1620
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:27,320
because the drafts are random from game to game it said write it in pencil and it also worked as copy protection since the original disc would ask for the order of the notes for your disc for the first spell that you learn and that's how you can prove that your game isn't a copy

1621
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:40,320
if you don't enter the correct notes that came with your book it would go back to the DOS boot screen that's pretty clever I think

1622
01:27:40,320 --> 01:28:04,320
you know basically like you put in your code here it actually was reviewed in dragon magazine number 159 and it was given a 5 out of 5 stars and overall had a 75% review and it was actually appeared in other games in the secret of monkey island there was a guy named Cobb who was in the scum bar and he was a

1623
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:24,320
wearing a shirt that said ask me about Loom nice and actually in the VGA remake of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade a painting in the vault of the Brunwell Castle reveals a beach that appears as scenery from Loom and in the NES version of Maniac Mansion there's a broken record called the soundtrack of Loom also in Space Quest

1624
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:47,320
4 there is a game parodies called there's one called boom exactly like a Allen literally just shouted from the other room yes yeah so that's the game Loom you can get it on steam I literally paid actually when I got it I paid $3 for it because it was on sale

1625
01:28:47,320 --> 01:29:10,320
totally worth it it's an amazing little point and click alright there it is your classic game of the week you had a lot to say about that one but it's a you know it's a really in-depth kind of game and I would just be stuck hours playing this game with my friend Marcy good times yeah alright well that's gonna do it for part a of orange launch radio but don't go anywhere we've got plenty more to come when we come back with orange launch radio another MMO going free to play

1626
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:26,320
a classic a classic classic game from back in the day I can't believe I'm calling a dreamcast game back in the day but I just did apparently set to come back so we're gonna talk all about that we come back with more of orange lounge radio

1627
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:53,320
welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio we're starting the second half of our show live here at all games radio it is February the 26th of 2012 and we are live with the 447th episode of our show we're about to get into some rapid fire news but I guess I have a interesting breaking news thing or whatever I win the other room

1628
01:29:53,320 --> 01:30:21,320
and saw my 3ds had the blue light on and I was like oh Rama or somebody probably sent me a cat picture so I assumed it was swap note going off but it wasn't I had suddenly new data so you 3ds owners might want to check I just suddenly had new data in the mee plaza and it told me that that the puzzle trading mode you know like or the picture the picture swap thing is now available via spot pass which is the internet not just the walking by spot pass which is the internet

1629
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:49,320
not just the walking by somebody which I think they call street pass right street pass and spot pass so and then it gave me a piece of a brand new puzzle from kid Icarus uprising so you know which obviously the Nintendo stuff is to promote their own products I'm sure but I thought that was interesting that that just updated right now so those of you the guys with 3ds that are into that kind of collecting stuff might want to check that out right now because I just got it and I imagine the rest of you probably have it on their way just like the whole

1630
01:30:49,320 --> 01:31:08,320
Reggie note on swap note earlier so I guess not to be outdone by the Vita Nintendo still needs a little attention this week hence their press conference on the day of the Vita launch and now some of this little stuff going on alright let's talk about some rapid fire news just some brief news we want to talk to you a little bit about Loki

1631
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:37,320
so one game that's still kind of teasing people over here in North America that they haven't gotten it yet is project 02 or Fatal Frame 2 it is coming to European regions very soon and it's funny because it's like one of those hey look we're translating the English but you can't have it yet you can't have it yet you can't okay fine you can have it no no you can't hahaha that's pretty much what they're doing so

1632
01:31:38,320 --> 01:32:03,320
yes it's coming to Europe when no idea but the game was actually it was a remake I guess of project zero well fair enough I mean how often does Europe get screwed on having to wait so many months because we got something you know so yeah and of course they don't specify whether North America will see the release as well but maybe

1633
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:26,320
if you beg enough this is kind of interesting not really a property that I thought would be getting a game but apparently it was announced that the boondocks saints are getting a video game and I mean absolutely awesome movie kind of curious to see how that would come about but it is going to be apparently

1634
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:51,320
a movie or not a movie a video game based off the movie little while after the movie scenes that came out in 1999 but hey you know what the Warriors game was fucking awesome I was going to say that game on the Warriors that was a movie the first Warriors game was fucking awesome not necessarily the second one that they released on Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation

1635
01:32:51,320 --> 01:33:19,320
or the original one they didn't games on the Godfather years and years later pretty good yeah so it happens and also Scarface was not bad how to kill Bill game I would see that I mean that would be kind of cool be fun just you know I don't know what exactly it would be but that's pretty cool so no word exactly what it is but apparently it's gonna be

1636
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:39,320
I guess part of a panel they're gonna have this it's Chris or critical mass interactive they're having a panel about it and I guess critical mass interactive they've done like outsource art and design stuff and they've been they've worked on some of the

1637
01:33:39,320 --> 01:34:08,320
and some pretty old games actually the outfit one of the early titles for the Xbox 360 and the Incredible Hulk not sure which Incredible Hulk game that was but at least this console generation you know but interesting to say the least and last but not least I'm very excited about this game one of my must haves

1638
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:35,320
of this year Borderlands 2 has been announced that it'll be coming to North America September 18 internationally September 24 lots of people excited about that game is Borderlands is awesome have you got a chance to play border I played it a little bit just a little bit so I not enough to get a full taste of it but enough to kind of see what people are excited about remember me and shooters don't always get along but I love the it's a little more fallout to me

1639
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:54,320
yeah it's a lot of loot dropping and they're gonna have a lot more loot in this and I love how there is kind of self-aware you know of their own jokes and stuff like you know of course the trailer had dubstep in it and they promised that they're all ninety eight point six percent more wub wub

1640
01:34:54,320 --> 01:35:23,320
according to the trailer this is great great trailer definitely need to watch it if you have it also apparently there is an incentive I guess if you pre-order is par like this premier club and you'll get a gearbox gun pack a golden key item to unlock some sort of loot chests later on in the game and vault hunters relic and stuff like that and you know to be honest the last Borderlands game that was some really well

1641
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:32,320
done dlc right there I mean there was just those expansions were all great every single one of them so looking forward to it

1642
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:57,320
alright well let's talk about Metroid yet again another Metroid release don't get too excited it's just the NES classic all over again but the NES game is a true classic but you probably already bought this when it was on the Wii or heck you have the original cart or maybe you unlocked it with the whole Gameboy Advance cable thing but if you miss somehow all those ways to play classic

1643
01:35:57,320 --> 01:36:10,320
well if you didn't buy your 3DS early enough that's right oh yeah that's right cause the early adopters got this for free well now you'll be able to buy Metroid now keep in mind we're getting this news from Japan but come on inevitably it'll come out here too

1644
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:22,320
Japan is getting the Metroid NES release on the 3DS virtual console on February 29th hopefully it's going to be coming here soon after that for those that you know didn't have the early adopter program

1645
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:33,320
you know Dark Tetsuya in our little thread where we post all the stories we want to talk about this week he had an interesting prediction guessing that it's the Famicar or the Famidisc version which actually had the better music to it

1646
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:53,320
I think that's a great thought or a wish but I wouldn't get your hopes up because the one that the early adopters have now is not that one and I'm pretty sure all this is is going to be just like the Mario one that came out a couple weeks ago where now you have the more proper save states built in and it's just kind of the quote unquote full release

1647
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:59,320
it would have multiplayer except Metroid doesn't use that at all so there you go

1648
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:03,320
and price it was I think 600 yen?

1649
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:08,320
yeah 6 bucks so a dollar more than it costs on the Wii

1650
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:19,320
and if you want to put a price tag on your you know what you're getting you know if you assume like each one's going to be about 5 bucks then that's a hundred dollars worth of content

1651
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:23,320
well I mean I would assume that the Game Boy Advance games would be more expensive but

1652
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:28,320
who knows but they're not going to put those out apparently or at least they say they're not

1653
01:37:29,320 --> 01:37:30,320
yeah they will

1654
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:35,320
or they'll be on the Wii U well we said we wouldn't put them out on the 3DS

1655
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:43,320
we had a Pokemon story earlier and you know what Pokemon was all the rage this week on iPhone but for all the wrong reasons

1656
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:53,320
this company called I don't know what they were there was something like anime original something I don't know it was clearly a ripoff company released what's called Pokemon yellow right

1657
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:57,320
the old Game Boy color or was it Game Boy regular?

1658
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:05,320
I think it was red and blue are regular and then yellow had to be the color one because they added Pikachu because he's popular in the cartoon right?

1659
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:14,320
I think I'd actually know it was a black and white one was it but you it had like I think special coloration available for the Super Game Boy

1660
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:21,320
that makes sense all right well anyhow Pokemon yellow came out on the iOS app store only it wasn't Pokemon in fact it was it was a dud app

1661
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:34,320
they were charging 99 cents for this app and it shot to the top of the charts apparently on name alone or you know some type of insider scheme where they had a bunch of people buy it real fast so it shot to the top of the charts I don't know

1662
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:42,320
but it was garbage they somebody actually it wouldn't even boot like you would launch the app and it would just die

1663
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:52,320
and somebody went in there and somehow hacked it decompiled it and saw that all it was was one of those bullshit apps that's just pictures of Pokemon and maps

1664
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:59,320
and Pokemon fan fiction and all this stuff I don't know it's just a bunch of garbage that they throw into an app and then charge for it

1665
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:09,320
but because of the fact it was called Pokemon yellow and they said in the description you know five star just like the original and they made up all these fucking press quotes that weren't attributed to anything

1666
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:16,320
I mean this whole thing was just a giant rip off well Apple ended up yanking it from the store but it took them like all weekend to do it

1667
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:23,320
and now the question is is Apple going to refund the money probably not there is apparently no wait you can't I think you can request the money back

1668
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:35,320
yeah if you there's a way that you can request it there's some sort of complaint form and you say basically that the app didn't work because it literally didn't work and then they may give you back the money

1669
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:42,320
one thousand three hundred let that be abused let that be a buck lesson that you should do your research on anything you download

1670
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:47,320
oh I didn't buy it well I meant to anybody that bought it because it was one dollar right

1671
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:57,320
no if it was a legit release also look at the company that made it because the legit release would have come from Nintendo and if they had let it out to a third party or something it would have said

1672
01:39:57,320 --> 01:40:12,320
but here's the thing though but I understand why they would do that though well why people might buy is because sometimes companies unscrupulous companies will take a game and like say port it to the iOS or whatever

1673
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:24,320
you know through an emulator or something like that and it gets yanked and say hi it actually was the working version of Pokemon yellow but you know not licensed or approved or whatever

1674
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:34,320
alright well one other story I have for you guys and this is of course sad news because it's about somebody passing Steve Kordek passed away on Sunday

1675
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:42,320
but he was a hundred years old so you know you can't say he didn't live a nice full long life I think that's a number we all want to get to

1676
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:52,320
if you don't know the name Steve Kordek play more pinball he was highly influential in the pinball world how influential well he's the guy who pretty much thought to do a two flipper table

1677
01:40:52,320 --> 01:41:04,320
and kind of designed the modern pinball table he gave us drop targets triple action yeah he also I guess later on he didn't just kind of do triple action that kind of did the standard pinball layout if you will

1678
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:15,320
he designed more than a hundred tables when he was with Genco and then Williams and Bally he did drop targets in Vagabond and multiball beat the clock 1963

1679
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:23,320
so Steve Kordek gave us all those things I played that table but sadly passed away this week they're doing I mean it has all the funeral details here

1680
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:30,320
there's a tribute book available online the link is a little lengthy there but I will go ahead and post that link in chat

1681
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:36,320
I'll leave you with this quote that he mentioned to the Chicago Tribune in 2009 when he had an interview

1682
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:41,320
I've had more fun in this business than anyone could believe

1683
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:44,320
rest in peace

1684
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:49,320
well how about some news that's not quite so sad

1685
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:51,320
yes please topic change

1686
01:41:52,320 --> 01:42:00,320
yeah there's going to be a few 80s stuff coming out in fact specifically it's a Huey Lewis and the news pack for a rock band

1687
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:05,320
there will be do you believe in love the heart of rock and roll and I want a new drug

1688
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:11,320
and the letter being one with a pro guitar and bass expansion so it's the usual pricing

1689
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:14,320
440 Microsoft points for the pack

1690
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:24,320
I want a new drug which you know what he sued for Ghostbusters for sounding like like his little riff in that

1691
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:35,320
really yeah also there is a best of Just Dance coming up by Ubisoft I guess people like Just Dance so there should be a best of

1692
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:40,320
but it's going to be on the Wii in Europe Middle East and Asia regions

1693
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:45,320
hopefully you'll get some songs from You Can Dance ABBA in there just saying

1694
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:51,320
well the ones listed on here so far are Hey Ya and Firework by Katy Perry

1695
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:54,320
the only girl in the world and airplanes

1696
01:42:55,320 --> 01:43:01,320
you know I can't really hate on those games they're they're stupid fun if that's what you want to play go ahead

1697
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:11,320
and of course of course the Kung Fu fighting you can't touch this not the original it's by the Groove Century

1698
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:20,320
and I like to move it move it move it you know what it's interesting when these kind of best collections happen

1699
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:24,320
it's almost like what you see happen in the music world when like I don't know who put out a greatest hits CD

1700
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:30,320
Goldfrapp just last month put out like a greatest hits CD so this is kind of like a greatest hits CD of sorts

1701
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:37,320
but it's not like we haven't seen music games do this before hello guitar hero had a compilation at one point

1702
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:43,320
DDR best hits anybody so Konami did it too back in the day

1703
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:52,320
well and back in the day they still do it I was going to say best hits was what 19 no probably like 2000 or 2001 it was a PS1 game

1704
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:59,320
well the last bit on here is it has to do with Star Wars the Old Republic which I know there are addicts out there that listen to this

1705
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:13,320
people are averaging 4-6 hours per gaming session which according to Greg Zestchuk who is the head of Bioware Austin

1706
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:20,320
says that it's absurd that their sessions are absurd and that it's that one more quest one more thing

1707
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:25,320
and that people are just getting sucked in and he says that Sunday is the busiest day playing

1708
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:34,320
but the average during the average work week you get people playing mid afternoon because the East Coast

1709
01:44:35,320 --> 01:44:42,320
and basically when Europe goes down North America goes up so they're getting consistent play times too

1710
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:49,320
and there are 2 million active subscribers so kind of like wow you know with about a fifth of the people

1711
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:57,320
and with more no one car I mean I'm I'm not gonna throw shade at Star Wars it was a fine month I played the game

1712
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:04,320
but I'm I'll check it out later on once things have leveled out a little more quality life improvements were needed in that game

1713
01:45:05,320 --> 01:45:14,320
that's it all right anyhow we're gonna get back into some longer set news here this is usually a little part of the show where I have for an interlude

1714
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:20,320
but I didn't really have anything tonight so I don't know I heard the Muppets won the Oscar for whatever they were nominated for

1715
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:26,320
the songwriter won and apparently Miss Piggy stole it and Matt Smith is on top gear

1716
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:31,320
well there you go Doctor Who? Who? Who? Exactly

1717
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:43,320
Loki so Aeon a definitely an MMO I haven't played because I don't play MMOs anymore I played it when it was in beta

1718
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:54,320
well you may be able to get a chance to play it now because Aeon is going free play and apparently this is coinciding with a 3.0 patch

1719
01:45:54,320 --> 01:46:02,320
one can only hope that a certain other Final Fantasy Online game when it gets its eventual 3.0 patch will go free to play as well

1720
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:07,320
how in the fuck is 11 not free to play at this point that's what I'm somebody asked that question on Twitter

1721
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:12,320
like with all these games going free to play how is Final Fantasy 11 I'm not even gonna touch 14

1722
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:17,320
but how is Final Fantasy 11 still charging but I guess you know 11 does still have its very loyal fan base

1723
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:25,320
you know they're very attached to that game and it's a fine game it's an MMO it's different it's not wow it's very much not wow

1724
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:28,320
I played Aeon in the beta it was a little wow

1725
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:33,320
if 11 goes free to play and they port to the Vita I may never be seen again

1726
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:37,320
that's right they were talking about 11 on the Vita at one point weren't they

1727
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:41,320
can you imagine if they know that it's gonna go free to play soon enough

1728
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:49,320
although you know if you put 11 free to play before Final Fantasy 14 is done you might as well just shoot it because it's dead

1729
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:52,320
I mean it's no one cares

1730
01:46:53,320 --> 01:46:57,320
the reinvention is gonna be interesting that's all I have to say

1731
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:02,320
but anyways one can dream but for right now though Aeon is gonna be going free to play

1732
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:05,320
and the 3.0 patch is right around the corner

1733
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:09,320
they're saying that they're going to be adding some new zones

1734
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:13,320
6 new instances they're gonna increase the level cap up to 60 as well as other tweaks

1735
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:20,320
they're gonna have an extended trial with the level cap of 40 and no time limit

1736
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:27,320
and of course you know people who I guess are paying for it they'll get free activation for 14 days

1737
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:36,320
and doesn't say what it's gonna cost I'm assuming there's gonna be some sort of cost thing or some sort of limits for the free to play stuff

1738
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:39,320
nope doesn't say so no idea

1739
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:44,320
I was looking at the specs it's like you only get two character slots instead of eight

1740
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:46,320
oh darn I know

1741
01:47:47,320 --> 01:47:49,320
yeah that's so terrible

1742
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:53,320
I'm sure they'll try to nickel and dime you that's what a lot of the free MMOs do

1743
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:55,320
I have my Star Trek online so I'm happy

1744
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:57,320
how is that free have you tried it?

1745
01:47:58,320 --> 01:47:59,320
I've played it twice

1746
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:01,320
does it try to nickel and dime you a lot?

1747
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:07,320
well I mean what it did as far as the nickel and dime thing you have to have cryptic points

1748
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:12,320
so you actually do have to go in and actively buy a series of points so that you have that

1749
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:17,320
and now instead of saying you can unlock this pack and your content is available

1750
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:23,320
it actually puts all of the content on there and lets you know what you have unlocked or not or what you can pay to unlock

1751
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:27,320
so like for costume packs and extra ships and things

1752
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:33,320
and it does that like say that you go into the clothing store to change your outfit

1753
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:39,320
it gives you that option while you're in there so I actually really like how that's integrated

1754
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:43,320
because you can see what they look like on your character and it lets you know whether or not you want to buy it

1755
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:45,320
that's a really good thing

1756
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:49,320
so far gameplay wise I haven't really noticed anything different

1757
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:54,320
keep in mind when I quit playing I was I think a vice admiral

1758
01:48:54,320 --> 01:49:01,320
no I was rear admiral and so I've still got my freaking Defiant with all of its badass stuff on it

1759
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:06,320
and because I bought content on it I have the medium level account

1760
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:10,320
so I haven't noticed any difference

1761
01:49:11,320 --> 01:49:13,320
I'm supposed to be meeting up with my fleet

1762
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:16,320
actually I think later tonight or next week

1763
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:18,320
better get home

1764
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:20,320
well keep in mind they're in Scotland

1765
01:49:21,320 --> 01:49:22,320
I'm seven hours behind them

1766
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:23,320
right

1767
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:27,320
so I'm supposed to be meeting up with them either this weekend or next

1768
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:31,320
probably next weekend to have them get me leveled

1769
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:33,320
very cool

1770
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:36,320
alright well other quick story for you guys

1771
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:40,320
this is actually really good news

1772
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:42,320
a lot of people are very excited to hear about this

1773
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:46,320
Sega put out a teaser trailer this week, 22 seconds

1774
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:49,320
and it revealed that a new Jet Set Radio game

1775
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:53,320
excuse me not a new game but a rebirth of the original game is on its way

1776
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:57,320
Jet Set Radio for Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network

1777
01:49:58,320 --> 01:49:59,320
if you don't remember

1778
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:01,320
is it Jet Grind or Jet Set?

1779
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:03,320
Jet Grind

1780
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:05,320
Japanese version Jet Set

1781
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:07,320
American version Jet Grind

1782
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:09,320
Jet Grind for us

1783
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:11,320
Jet Set Radio Future was the Xbox one

1784
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:13,320
Future was the Xbox one that's not the one we're getting

1785
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:15,320
we're getting the original one from the Dreamcast

1786
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,320
which makes sense we've had half the other Dreamcast games

1787
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:19,320
the big ones like Space Channel

1788
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:24,320
although I would be surprised or wouldn't be surprised if they re-released it

1789
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:27,320
for like you know the Xbox what do they call that

1790
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:29,320
the ones where you can download the full games

1791
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:33,320
if it's not already because they have that was a backwards compatible title

1792
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:35,320
oh that's a good point

1793
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:38,320
well but here's the thing and it's gonna be interesting to see how it affects this too

1794
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:42,320
is that while it's really exciting to hear that and it was a good game

1795
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:45,320
and that was what you skateboarded around into the graffiti it was a lot of fun

1796
01:50:45,320 --> 01:50:46,320
it's a cheap amato

1797
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:49,320
what's well that's the whole thing the soundtrack

1798
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:52,320
what happened when Crazy Taxi got re-released

1799
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:56,320
the fuck was that band

1800
01:50:57,320 --> 01:50:58,320
yeah yeah yeah offspring

1801
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:00,320
the offspring song was gone

1802
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:02,320
but Bad Religion wasn't that still

1803
01:51:03,320 --> 01:51:04,320
I think they replaced it with something else

1804
01:51:05,320 --> 01:51:09,320
so it's possible that this game is gonna get a different soundtrack

1805
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:12,320
and that is probably the same thing that's holding up the original Xbox

1806
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:18,320
the Jet Set Future from coming out is because they can't get the rights to the soundtrack

1807
01:51:19,320 --> 01:51:21,320
they probably only licensed those songs specifically for that

1808
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:24,320
and so they can't suddenly put it out on 360

1809
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:29,320
so we'll see because the soundtrack was a huge part of the game

1810
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:33,320
so it's like well they could license equally awesome songs

1811
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:38,320
or they could try and put in generic stuff and see if the game will sell itself on nostalgia alone

1812
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:40,320
which it probably would

1813
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:41,320
but it's gonna be very interesting

1814
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:43,320
very interesting to see

1815
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:46,320
so anyhow I'm still excited

1816
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:48,320
so there

1817
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:51,320
also it is impossible to sing birthday cake without doing

1818
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:53,320
shut up Penny me

1819
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:57,320
Miho Hattori's accent

1820
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:00,320
yes I'm cooking for my son and his wife

1821
01:52:01,320 --> 01:52:02,320
extra sugar extra salt

1822
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:04,320
I love that song anyhow

1823
01:52:05,320 --> 01:52:06,320
I love this song too

1824
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:08,320
because it means it's time for the mailbag

1825
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:09,320
mailbag

1826
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:11,320
mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

1827
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:15,320
again the email address is mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

1828
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:17,320
and that's where you can send us some email

1829
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:19,320
that we will read here on the show

1830
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:23,320
and I'm saying that email address one more time because more of you need to use it

1831
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:26,320
mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

1832
01:52:27,320 --> 01:52:28,320
girl

1833
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:30,320
we actually did get another email in

1834
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:32,320
well yay

1835
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:34,320
after you checked it Mr. Rob

1836
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:36,320
I'm gonna read it last though

1837
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:37,320
okay

1838
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:40,320
this comes from Haseo Sumirogawa

1839
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:44,320
so maybe it came after I read the last email from him

1840
01:52:45,320 --> 01:52:48,320
also if two people shared two PS3 systems for whatever reason

1841
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:54,320
and one bought a new copy of let's say Saints Row the Third with the online pass

1842
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:57,320
and one bought it used without the online pass

1843
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:00,320
could this person download the online pass from the other person's account

1844
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:02,320
and be able to play online?

1845
01:53:03,320 --> 01:53:04,320
no

1846
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:05,320
on the note of online passes

1847
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:09,320
can a person without one still update their games and get DLC?

1848
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:11,320
yes you can get DLC

1849
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:13,320
the only thing you can't do is you can't play

1850
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:18,320
sadly enough you can't play SystemLink or whatever they call it

1851
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:23,320
and you can't play online co-op

1852
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:25,320
well co-op for both of those

1853
01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:27,320
so you can't play co-op but you can't play

1854
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:30,320
well co-op the horde mode as well

1855
01:53:31,320 --> 01:53:32,320
but the rest of the game you can download the DLC

1856
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:33,320
you can play single player you can do all that

1857
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:35,320
you just can't play together

1858
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:40,320
now on another note I've been playing a Japanese PSP demo for Final Fantasy Type 0

1859
01:53:41,320 --> 01:53:43,320
now I'm wondering if this is ever going to come to America

1860
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:46,320
and now it ties into the Fabula Nova Crystallis

1861
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:48,320
it was supposed to be Agito 13

1862
01:53:49,320 --> 01:53:52,320
right I thought it was coming out here or did come out here

1863
01:53:53,320 --> 01:53:54,320
I wish

1864
01:53:55,320 --> 01:53:56,320
hopefully it will

1865
01:53:57,320 --> 01:54:00,320
but anyways thanks for reading my email signed Haseo Sumirogawa

1866
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:01,320
next email

1867
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:04,320
greetings OLR it's your friendly neighborhood turtle

1868
01:54:05,320 --> 01:54:06,320
just wanted to say hi and have a good week

1869
01:54:07,320 --> 01:54:08,320
your loyal turtle in Philly, serious turtle

1870
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:10,320
well thank you

1871
01:54:11,320 --> 01:54:14,320
yeah I guess I'm looking at Amazon it's all imports on there

1872
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:17,320
they want 104 bucks for that Japanese import

1873
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:19,320
good lord

1874
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:22,320
oh chukaboo

1875
01:54:23,320 --> 01:54:24,320
look at that face

1876
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:26,320
for the record Rob

1877
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:28,320
that is very cute it's a mascot cushion 50 bucks

1878
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:29,320
I have to tell you something Rob

1879
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:30,320
what's that

1880
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:32,320
every time I play one of my blood elves

1881
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:36,320
and hop on my whatever the crap their peep things are called

1882
01:54:37,320 --> 01:54:39,320
their striders or whatever

1883
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:43,320
my brain instantly starts playing the chocobo music

1884
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:45,320
and Dan was walking in

1885
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:47,320
while I was writing on one

1886
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:49,320
and I was actually humming the chocobo theme

1887
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:51,320
in under city

1888
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:53,320
and he starts going

1889
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:55,320
chocobo bop chocobo bop

1890
01:54:55,320 --> 01:54:57,320
chocobo bop so it was cute anyway

1891
01:54:59,320 --> 01:55:00,320
alrighty

1892
01:55:01,320 --> 01:55:02,320
get down to your chocobo bop

1893
01:55:03,320 --> 01:55:04,320
I

1894
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:06,320
TBA for the North American release

1895
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:08,320
there's no date for this right now

1896
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:11,320
that's surprise I could have sworn we had

1897
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:14,320
that they had confirmed it was coming here and gave a date

1898
01:55:15,320 --> 01:55:16,320
but I guess not

1899
01:55:17,320 --> 01:55:18,320
I would imagine this is an E3 thing

1900
01:55:19,320 --> 01:55:20,320
this is exactly why they're keeping it in their hat

1901
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:22,320
this is going to be an E3 thing

1902
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:24,320
maybe there's a problem with it being on PSP

1903
01:55:25,320 --> 01:55:27,320
and not PS Vita at this point too

1904
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:29,320
but then again

1905
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:31,320
it came out in Japan with only a couple weeks to go

1906
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:33,320
before the Vita came out over there

1907
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:35,320
so they could still do it as a download thing

1908
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:38,320
they could really push it as a download title here in the US

1909
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:40,320
so I don't know

1910
01:55:41,320 --> 01:55:43,320
someone doesn't have Japanese text installed on this computer

1911
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:45,320
yeah I know right

1912
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:47,320
well this is the show computer not my personal computer

1913
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:49,320
so but anyway

1914
01:55:49,320 --> 01:55:51,320
I would imagine E3

1915
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:53,320
you got to hear something on this E3

1916
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:56,320
this is too big of a title to not get released here

1917
01:55:57,320 --> 01:55:58,320
but we'll see

1918
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:00,320
can I jump in real quick

1919
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:02,320
for the chat room

1920
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:04,320
I wanted to follow up to something else

1921
01:56:05,320 --> 01:56:06,320
I had several people stating this

1922
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:08,320
something to remember about Jet Set Radio

1923
01:56:09,320 --> 01:56:10,320
is that a lot of the soundtrack was done in house

1924
01:56:11,320 --> 01:56:12,320
so a lot of that will probably stay

1925
01:56:13,320 --> 01:56:14,320
but certainly there was some great licensed music

1926
01:56:15,320 --> 01:56:16,320
like the Chibomato comes to mind

1927
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:18,320
I really hope they're able to get that to stay

1928
01:56:19,320 --> 01:56:20,320
but chatters you are right

1929
01:56:21,320 --> 01:56:22,320
the original in house stuff will certainly stay

1930
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:24,320
I'm sure like Space Channel 5 didn't change

1931
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:26,320
that was all in house

1932
01:56:27,320 --> 01:56:28,320
I mean and also you got to think

1933
01:56:29,320 --> 01:56:30,320
you know the Mexican flyer is now in public domain

1934
01:56:31,320 --> 01:56:32,320
right

1935
01:56:33,320 --> 01:56:34,320
so because that's classic big band

1936
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:36,320
um

1937
01:56:37,320 --> 01:56:38,320
Dear Orange Lounge

1938
01:56:39,320 --> 01:56:40,320
I wanted to write to someone about my recent good experience

1939
01:56:41,320 --> 01:56:42,320
with Nintendo customer service

1940
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:44,320
I bought a 3DS the day it came out

1941
01:56:44,320 --> 01:56:45,320
two days before the ambassador program began

1942
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:47,320
I sent my 3DS through the wash

1943
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:49,320
now this is understandable if you are maybe 10

1944
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:51,320
but I am 34

1945
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:53,320
so I figured that was the end of that

1946
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:55,320
womp womp

1947
01:56:56,320 --> 01:56:57,320
it was my husband who suggested I send the system in

1948
01:56:58,320 --> 01:56:59,320
for possible repair

1949
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:01,320
I dragged my heels for several months

1950
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:03,320
I was sure they would do nothing

1951
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:05,320
it is $85 to send a system in for repair

1952
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:07,320
because my system was less than one year old

1953
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:09,320
I received a $20 discount

1954
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:11,320
65 days later I had a shopping label

1955
01:57:11,320 --> 01:57:14,320
boxed it up and sent it away

1956
01:57:15,320 --> 01:57:16,320
I explained to them that I sent it through the washer

1957
01:57:17,320 --> 01:57:18,320
and was expecting to get the broken system back

1958
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:20,320
with a not our problem letter

1959
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:22,320
wait wait $65 later

1960
01:57:23,320 --> 01:57:24,320
because it was $85 to send them

1961
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:26,320
but she had a $20 discount

1962
01:57:27,320 --> 01:57:28,320
oh ok I thought for a minute too you said 65 days later

1963
01:57:29,320 --> 01:57:30,320
I don't know why ok ok I'm good

1964
01:57:31,320 --> 01:57:32,320
9 days later the box came back

1965
01:57:33,320 --> 01:57:34,320
a letter explaining that they could not fix the old system

1966
01:57:35,320 --> 01:57:36,320
and had replaced it with a brand new one

1967
01:57:37,320 --> 01:57:38,320
my SD card which I forgot to remove

1968
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:40,320
was taped to the bottom of the cardboard box

1969
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:42,320
all of my pictures were still on the card

1970
01:57:43,320 --> 01:57:44,320
it included instructions to redownload the lost content

1971
01:57:45,320 --> 01:57:46,320
at no additional cost

1972
01:57:47,320 --> 01:57:48,320
I had restored all of the games I purchased

1973
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:50,320
and was really happy with the new system

1974
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:52,320
and the promptness of their response

1975
01:57:53,320 --> 01:57:54,320
after doing the homework to check the system

1976
01:57:55,320 --> 01:57:56,320
I found they had signed the replacement system

1977
01:57:57,320 --> 01:57:58,320
up for the ambassador program

1978
01:57:59,320 --> 01:58:00,320
all free games were available for me to download

1979
01:58:01,320 --> 01:58:02,320
squeeee

1980
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:04,320
nice

1981
01:58:05,320 --> 01:58:06,320
I wanted to be able to tell other gamers

1982
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:07,320
about this wonderful experience

1983
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:09,320
Nintendo went above and beyond helping a silly old

1984
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:11,320
don't call yourself old because seriously

1985
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:13,320
you're younger than me

1986
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:15,320
silly old lady who can't remember to empty her pockets

1987
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:17,320
thanks again for your time and your game podcast Emily

1988
01:58:19,320 --> 01:58:20,320
well thank you for the story Emily

1989
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:22,320
I guess Mayor Muse

1990
01:58:23,320 --> 01:58:24,320
well you know I think there's something though

1991
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:26,320
with that ambassador program

1992
01:58:27,320 --> 01:58:28,320
because I notice you get a little certificate

1993
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:30,320
like I'm looking at my 3DS right now

1994
01:58:31,320 --> 01:58:32,320
there's a little certificate that goes

1995
01:58:33,320 --> 01:58:34,320
I have a lot of icons don't I

1996
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:35,320
but there's this application there that's just

1997
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:37,320
3DS ambassador certificate

1998
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:39,320
that's all it is and it sits there

1999
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:41,320
and when you open it

2000
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:43,320
all it is if I remember right is

2001
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:45,320
do you want to opt it like it's just one question

2002
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:47,320
it says do you want to opt in for notifications

2003
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:48,320
for this title

2004
01:58:49,320 --> 01:58:50,320
oh no no it's a movie that's what it is

2005
01:58:51,320 --> 01:58:52,320
they just yeah they just recently

2006
01:58:53,320 --> 01:58:54,320
oh but then they say receive notifications

2007
01:58:55,320 --> 01:58:56,320
down there it's all it is

2008
01:58:57,320 --> 01:58:58,320
so it like doesn't really do anything

2009
01:58:59,320 --> 01:59:02,320
but I'm thinking that being on your 3DS

2010
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:03,320
is what lets you download all that stuff

2011
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:05,320
and maybe because

2012
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:07,320
guys it's inevitable that they're gonna

2013
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:09,320
come out with another 3DS

2014
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:11,320
like they're gonna incorporate

2015
01:59:12,320 --> 01:59:13,320
that second circle pad into a new 3DS

2016
01:59:14,320 --> 01:59:15,320
at some point so I've got to be able

2017
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:17,320
to transfer my ambassador shit over there

2018
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:19,320
so I'm thinking that little guy being

2019
01:59:21,320 --> 01:59:22,320
there is the key somehow

2020
01:59:23,320 --> 01:59:24,320
this probably ties to my console

2021
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:27,320
number somehow and Nintendo probably

2022
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:30,320
can generate that somehow in-house

2023
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:31,320
and did for your

2024
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:33,320
you know when you sent your 3DS back

2025
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:35,320
but that's great I mean you're right

2026
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:37,320
not a lot of folks would do that

2027
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:39,320
oh hey my spot pass notification

2028
01:59:40,320 --> 01:59:41,320
just went off look at that

2029
01:59:42,320 --> 01:59:43,320
oh that means kitty pictures

2030
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:45,320
in 3D oh lord

2031
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:48,320
yes it's a swap note

2032
01:59:49,320 --> 01:59:50,320
oh squee I'm gonna look that up

2033
01:59:51,320 --> 01:59:52,320
oh great all right

2034
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:54,320
well a Rick Santorum portrait made

2035
01:59:55,320 --> 01:59:56,320
entirely of gay porn

2036
01:59:57,320 --> 01:59:58,320
talked about that on Horde house already

2037
01:59:58,320 --> 01:59:59,320
wow it's made up of a lot of legs

2038
02:00:00,320 --> 02:00:01,320
um so yeah

2039
02:00:03,320 --> 02:00:04,320
that's it for the emails

2040
02:00:05,320 --> 02:00:06,320
I want to see more good

2041
02:00:07,320 --> 02:00:08,320
customer service

2042
02:00:09,320 --> 02:00:10,320
messages like that

2043
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:12,320
that makes me feel

2044
02:00:13,320 --> 02:00:14,320
joyous in my soul

2045
02:00:15,320 --> 02:00:16,320
Bobby is in our chat room

2046
02:00:17,320 --> 02:00:18,320
by black wolf saying Rob

2047
02:00:19,320 --> 02:00:20,320
all that certificate does is let

2048
02:00:21,320 --> 02:00:22,320
you get spot pass notifications

2049
02:00:23,320 --> 02:00:24,320
well yeah that's what the app does

2050
02:00:25,320 --> 02:00:26,320
but I thought and I could have

2051
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:27,320
thought wrong that somehow that

2052
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:29,320
application existing

2053
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:31,320
was what kind of enabled my 3DS

2054
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:34,320
to get all that

2055
02:00:35,320 --> 02:00:36,320
because obviously they've got to be

2056
02:00:37,320 --> 02:00:38,320
looking at the MAC address

2057
02:00:39,320 --> 02:00:40,320
on my system or something on the

2058
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:42,320
back end that tells them

2059
02:00:43,320 --> 02:00:44,320
but all right

2060
02:00:45,320 --> 02:00:46,320
Tigerclaw saying he sent me a swap

2061
02:00:47,320 --> 02:00:48,320
note earlier maybe it's finally

2062
02:00:49,320 --> 02:00:50,320
getting here it seems like it takes

2063
02:00:51,320 --> 02:00:52,320
a couple hours for things to get here

2064
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:54,320
no this is wrong Rama has sent me a cat

2065
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:55,320
this is Indy

2066
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:57,320
he purrs like a race car

2067
02:00:58,320 --> 02:00:59,320
oh because his name's Indy

2068
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:01,320
look at that there's Indy

2069
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:03,320
sorry I'm derailing I'm derailing

2070
02:01:04,320 --> 02:01:05,320
this radio show with my 3D pictures

2071
02:01:06,320 --> 02:01:07,320
all right

2072
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:09,320
any more emails

2073
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:11,320
you just made my eyes hurt

2074
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:13,320
here

2075
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:15,320
sorry

2076
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:17,320
all right then let's get to the F user

2077
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:19,320
Sam does that shit to me too with his phone

2078
02:01:20,320 --> 02:01:21,320
because he has that Android phone

2079
02:01:21,320 --> 02:01:23,320
he has that 3D pictures oh really here

2080
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:25,320
let me do this there all right now I'm

2081
02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:27,320
not looking at it I'll close it it's

2082
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:29,320
fine all right let's get what an

2083
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:31,320
appropriate time to get to the FUs of

2084
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:33,320
the week

2085
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:48,320
my FU of the week I have a few actually

2086
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:51,320
because I've had a pissy week number one

2087
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:58,320
to me and involuntary actions of myself

2088
02:01:59,320 --> 02:02:05,320
also FU to misunderstandings and

2089
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:10,320
fundamental things and then the last one

2090
02:02:11,320 --> 02:02:15,320
goes to people being complete assholes to

2091
02:02:15,320 --> 02:02:18,320
their family members you know you got to

2092
02:02:19,320 --> 02:02:21,320
think about when kids are little the

2093
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:24,320
stuff that you're doing to them you know

2094
02:02:25,320 --> 02:02:26,320
you can do stuff that's gonna scar them

2095
02:02:27,320 --> 02:02:28,320
for life you can be too hard too pushy

2096
02:02:29,320 --> 02:02:30,320
you never know how it's gonna affect

2097
02:02:31,320 --> 02:02:32,320
somebody so be careful and don't be an

2098
02:02:33,320 --> 02:02:36,320
asshole don't be an asshole good advice

2099
02:02:37,320 --> 02:02:38,320
to anybody just because you're a parent

2100
02:02:39,320 --> 02:02:40,320
doesn't mean you can be an asshole your

2101
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:44,320
kids treat them with respect too that's

2102
02:02:45,320 --> 02:02:47,320
it all right Loki like you the people

2103
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:49,320
that don't know how to put lids on fast

2104
02:02:50,320 --> 02:02:52,320
food drinks I mean seriously it's not

2105
02:02:53,320 --> 02:02:55,320
that hard people it's not hard to snap a

2106
02:02:56,320 --> 02:02:57,320
lid on there you really don't have that

2107
02:02:58,320 --> 02:03:00,320
skill set then you should just jump off a

2108
02:03:01,320 --> 02:03:07,320
bridge I think my FU of the week isn't

2109
02:03:07,320 --> 02:03:09,320
that serious because luckily things have

2110
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:11,320
been pretty good this week so I can't

2111
02:03:12,320 --> 02:03:13,320
complain too much but I will give an FU

2112
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:15,320
FU to the fact that I forgot I have a

2113
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:17,320
doctor's appointment in the morning and

2114
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:19,320
I have like this stack of paperwork I

2115
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:21,320
have to fill out like I really don't want

2116
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:23,320
to do that tonight after the show but I

2117
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:25,320
have to but I will say an FU a very

2118
02:03:26,320 --> 02:03:28,320
serious FU to this amazing dessert I had

2119
02:03:29,320 --> 02:03:30,320
at BJ's which yes is the name of a

2120
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:32,320
restaurant get your mind out of the

2121
02:03:32,320 --> 02:03:36,320
gutter it I had a pizookie their flavor

2122
02:03:37,320 --> 02:03:39,320
right now is red velvet pizookie oh my

2123
02:03:40,320 --> 02:03:43,320
god you bitch it is so I thought I

2124
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:45,320
haven't been to BJ's in a while the last

2125
02:03:46,320 --> 02:03:47,320
time I was there they only had like the

2126
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:50,320
chocolate and the peanut butter Oreo and

2127
02:03:51,320 --> 02:03:52,320
regular juice did it still taste like

2128
02:03:53,320 --> 02:03:54,320
eating granulated sugar kinda but I

2129
02:03:55,320 --> 02:03:57,320
didn't even care chocolate chip or chunk

2130
02:03:57,320 --> 02:04:01,320
or whatever but but but but red velvet

2131
02:04:02,320 --> 02:04:05,320
oh my god so I'm torn because they're

2132
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:08,320
they're putting in a chick-fil-a and

2133
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:12,320
Folsom now your chick-fil-a openly

2134
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:16,320
supports you propaganda against you know

2135
02:04:17,320 --> 02:04:19,320
the gays and that community and stuff

2136
02:04:20,320 --> 02:04:21,320
but their breakfast sandwiches are so

2137
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:23,320
delicious it if it's it's actually okay

2138
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:25,320
in Sacramento because the local

2139
02:04:25,320 --> 02:04:27,320
franchise owners here in Sacramento

2140
02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:30,320
actually support pro-lgbt but is that one

2141
02:04:31,320 --> 02:04:32,320
the same franchise or that's it don't

2142
02:04:33,320 --> 02:04:34,320
have to check you'll have to check but

2143
02:04:35,320 --> 02:04:36,320
hopefully but the Arden one the owners

2144
02:04:37,320 --> 02:04:38,320
are on the lavender team they are on the

2145
02:04:39,320 --> 02:04:40,320
Rainbow Chamber of Commerce because they

2146
02:04:41,320 --> 02:04:42,320
are lavender here well whatever it's

2147
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:44,320
whatever it's gay but one of the owners

2148
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:46,320
they're just no they're a couple they

2149
02:04:47,320 --> 02:04:50,320
just want to they've offset you know I

2150
02:04:51,320 --> 02:04:52,320
mean animals images of chick-fil-a I

2151
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:54,320
know the corporate thing still goes

2152
02:04:55,320 --> 02:04:59,320
towards those big charities but I like

2153
02:05:00,320 --> 02:05:01,320
to think that they're a little bit is

2154
02:05:02,320 --> 02:05:03,320
offsetting that part of what chick-fil-a

2155
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:05,320
does and that you know the children's

2156
02:05:06,320 --> 02:05:07,320
programs and everything and the

2157
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:09,320
education programs are still good I

2158
02:05:10,320 --> 02:05:11,320
don't know it's hard to be okay with a

2159
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:13,320
service that is preaching hate in one

2160
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:15,320
hand yet doing really good things for

2161
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:17,320
kids you know I don't I don't know what

2162
02:05:17,320 --> 02:05:22,320
to think my brain explodes JV Mon just

2163
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:24,320

02:05:25,320 --> 02:05:26,320

02:06:06,320 --> 02:06:07,320
you one thing about chick-fil-a when I

2182
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:09,320
lived in Alabama but I worked in the mall

2183
02:06:09,320 --> 02:06:11,320
I worked there they would always save me

2184
02:06:12,320 --> 02:06:13,320
the little tiny hash brown things from

2185
02:06:14,320 --> 02:06:15,320
breakfast so that I could have them any

2186
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:19,320
time during the day nice and those things

2187
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:21,320
in Polynesian sauce are crack let's move

2188
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:24,320
on so we can get to Twitter topics in

2189
02:06:25,320 --> 02:06:26,320
the skype line at one eight seven seven

2190
02:06:27,320 --> 02:06:28,320
game olr but not just yet because we have

2191
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:30,320
just a few more stories for you guys

2192
02:06:31,320 --> 02:06:33,320
Loki now this is kind of weird they're

2193
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:36,320
actually gonna be putting out a free to

2194
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:39,320
play multiplayer version of Killzone 3

2195
02:06:40,320 --> 02:06:41,320
on the PlayStation now this is the

2196
02:06:42,320 --> 02:06:45,320
multiplayer portion of Killzone 3 it's

2197
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:47,320
not really anything new but it's gonna

2198
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:49,320
be free to play up to a level cap of

2199
02:06:50,320 --> 02:06:52,320
course you're gonna have a certain level

2200
02:06:53,320 --> 02:06:54,320
cap and you can play up to that if you

2201
02:06:55,320 --> 02:06:56,320
want to continue leveling up you'll have

2202
02:06:57,320 --> 02:06:58,320
to pay $14.99 for the full experience but

2203
02:06:59,320 --> 02:07:00,320
kind of got me thinking I mean that's

2204
02:07:01,320 --> 02:07:02,320
kind of interesting that they do that I

2205
02:07:03,320 --> 02:07:04,320
mean imagine like if Activision that with

2206
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:06,320
Call of Duty because you got a minute

2207
02:07:07,320 --> 02:07:08,320
most of the people are paying for the

2208
02:07:09,320 --> 02:07:11,320
multiplayer portion of Call of Duty not

2209
02:07:12,320 --> 02:07:14,320
so much the campaign you could just kind

2210
02:07:15,320 --> 02:07:16,320
of skip the pleasantries and just get the

2211
02:07:17,320 --> 02:07:18,320
multiplayer portion plus it's free to

2212
02:07:19,320 --> 02:07:20,320
play I mean it's an interesting

2213
02:07:21,320 --> 02:07:22,320
experiment that they're trying that is I

2214
02:07:23,320 --> 02:07:30,320
guess available available soon on

2215
02:07:30,320 --> 02:07:33,320
Tuesday sorry I'm furiously adding

2216
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:35,320
people to my 3ds over yours I had

2217
02:07:36,320 --> 02:07:37,320
somebody asked for cat pics so I needed

2218
02:07:38,320 --> 02:07:42,320
a friend code all right I'm trying to

2219
02:07:43,320 --> 02:07:44,320
think of other cases where this has been

2220
02:07:45,320 --> 02:07:46,320
done before where they stripped out part

2221
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:47,320
of the game and then kind of like put it

2222
02:07:48,320 --> 02:07:49,320
up on the marketplace just I don't really

2223
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:51,320
have by its own this is kind of new kind

2224
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:54,320
of interesting um we have a story last

2225
02:07:55,320 --> 02:07:57,320
week about Metal Gear Solid 4's online

2226
02:07:57,320 --> 02:07:59,320
component was shutting down yeah and it

2227
02:08:00,320 --> 02:08:01,320
seems strange to me they didn't try to

2228
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:03,320
strip that out at some point kind of

2229
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:05,320
make it a standalone game hmm because no

2230
02:08:06,320 --> 02:08:07,320
one played it that's why they shut

2231
02:08:08,320 --> 02:08:09,320
servers and they're like well we'll just

2232
02:08:10,320 --> 02:08:11,320
disappoint those two people still playing

2233
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:13,320
there more people playing Killzone than

2234
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:15,320
Metal Gear Solid I guess I don't think

2235
02:08:16,320 --> 02:08:17,320
there's probably that many people playing

2236
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:19,320
Killzone that I think maybe they get

2237
02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:21,320
more it's a good experiment we'll see

2238
02:08:22,320 --> 02:08:25,320
what happens all right all right so um

2239
02:08:25,320 --> 02:08:26,320
Dark Sakura listen up because this is a

2240
02:08:27,320 --> 02:08:30,320
relevant interest to you grin was a big

2241
02:08:31,320 --> 02:08:32,320
studio that shut down a couple years ago

2242
02:08:33,320 --> 02:08:35,320
what year did they shut down was 2009 it

2243
02:08:36,320 --> 02:08:37,320
was right after bionic commander which is

2244
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:39,320
sad that game was not bad I know the

2245
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:41,320
internet disagrees with you bionic

2246
02:08:42,320 --> 02:08:43,320
commander rearmed was awesome but grin

2247
02:08:44,320 --> 02:08:45,320
did kind of meet an untimely fate and

2248
02:08:46,320 --> 02:08:48,320
they were working on a lot of shit like

2249
02:08:49,320 --> 02:08:50,320
they had that Final Fantasy fortress

2250
02:08:51,320 --> 02:08:52,320
game right or whatever that was we'll

2251
02:08:52,320 --> 02:08:56,320
get this apparently Barcelona grin their

2252
02:08:57,320 --> 02:08:58,320
studio there was working on these

2253
02:08:59,320 --> 02:09:00,320
projects this grin Barcelona closed

2254
02:09:01,320 --> 02:09:02,320
first they were like the first shoe

2255
02:09:03,320 --> 02:09:04,320
dropping and then grin mean closing was

2256
02:09:05,320 --> 02:09:07,320
the other shoe but grin Barcelona was

2257
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:10,320
apparently working on a Strider reboot

2258
02:09:11,320 --> 02:09:13,320
that's what that's what they were working

2259
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:15,320
on they had and there's even this teaser

2260
02:09:16,320 --> 02:09:17,320
video that goes with it and all it is

2261
02:09:18,320 --> 02:09:19,320
it's pretty badass actually it's uh this

2262
02:09:19,320 --> 02:09:21,320
you know it's just this little like Russian

2263
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:23,320
spy looking dude like if you remember the

2264
02:09:24,320 --> 02:09:25,320
movie spies like us he looks like that

2265
02:09:26,320 --> 02:09:27,320
he's just kind of standing there he's

2266
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:29,320
putting up a little poster and then all

2267
02:09:30,320 --> 02:09:31,320
of a sudden see here's the little thing

2268
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:34,320
and then just out of nowhere whack you

2269
02:09:35,320 --> 02:09:38,320
hear a little freak and oh there's all

2270
02:09:39,320 --> 02:09:45,320
this blood everywhere like a little one

2271
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:47,320
of those little quick blade things and

2272
02:09:47,320 --> 02:09:48,320
then all of a sudden you mean the cipher

2273
02:09:49,320 --> 02:09:52,320
yeah that's a ciphering because this

2274
02:09:53,320 --> 02:09:54,320
totally reminds me the opening the cube

2275
02:09:55,320 --> 02:09:58,320
oh you got something happen sucks to be

2276
02:09:59,320 --> 02:10:00,320
that guy well here's the thing though

2277
02:10:01,320 --> 02:10:03,320
Capcom worked or excuse me grin Barcelona

2278
02:10:04,320 --> 02:10:07,320
worked on that Capcom rejected it Capcom

2279
02:10:08,320 --> 02:10:09,320
canceled the project grin was gonna do

2280
02:10:10,320 --> 02:10:13,320
it anyway and just change the IP make it

2281
02:10:14,320 --> 02:10:15,320
like you know ninja game you know or

2282
02:10:15,320 --> 02:10:17,320
something a little different but after

2283
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:21,320
that didn't happen it got canceled they

2284
02:10:22,320 --> 02:10:24,320
tried to do a Streets of Rage reboot

2285
02:10:25,320 --> 02:10:27,320
instead and Sega it didn't happen they

2286
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:30,320
got shut down so it's very I mean grin

2287
02:10:31,320 --> 02:10:33,320
did bionic commando they were trying

2288
02:10:34,320 --> 02:10:36,320
Strider they were doing Final Fantasy

2289
02:10:37,320 --> 02:10:39,320
they apparently had Streets of Rage

2290
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:41,320
goddamn they were working on a lot of

2291
02:10:42,320 --> 02:10:43,320
like classic reboots I don't think any

2292
02:10:43,320 --> 02:10:45,320
of us realize like how vested they were

2293
02:10:46,320 --> 02:10:48,320
in bringing back I'm just imagining a

2294
02:10:49,320 --> 02:10:51,320
Metal Gear Solid style game with Strider

2295
02:10:52,320 --> 02:10:54,320
hear you mm-hmm in concept you kind of

2296
02:10:55,320 --> 02:10:58,320
look at it so Metal Gear Rising

2297
02:10:59,320 --> 02:11:01,320
revengeance which revengeance is such a

2298
02:11:02,320 --> 02:11:04,320
stupid name that's the Capcom Namco Sega

2299
02:11:05,320 --> 02:11:10,320
project okay maybe not it's a dumb name

2300
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:12,320
but yeah there's a bunch of artwork on

2301
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:14,320
this Spanish website that you can you

2302
02:11:15,320 --> 02:11:16,320
know kind of look at some of the concept

2303
02:11:17,320 --> 02:11:18,320
art for the Strider thing that got

2304
02:11:19,320 --> 02:11:20,320
canceled you know I don't actually see

2305
02:11:21,320 --> 02:11:22,320
Strider just you know cuz they had to

2306
02:11:23,320 --> 02:11:24,320
change it that makes me sad so that's

2307
02:11:25,320 --> 02:11:26,320
something they'll probably show at e3 is

2308
02:11:27,320 --> 02:11:29,320
no rising stuff oh yeah Metal Gear I was

2309
02:11:30,320 --> 02:11:32,320
like what are you talking about grin got

2310
02:11:33,320 --> 02:11:34,320
canned in 2009 though Capcom really

2311
02:11:35,320 --> 02:11:36,320
should do Strider because what else do

2312
02:11:37,320 --> 02:11:38,320
they got they were the rebooting Devil

2313
02:11:38,320 --> 02:11:40,320
Gear I guess and I just saw some article

2314
02:11:41,320 --> 02:11:42,320
on the internet this week too about like

2315
02:11:43,320 --> 02:11:45,320
it was defending Strider only you posted

2316
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:47,320
on Facebook for Dan it was the whole

2317
02:11:48,320 --> 02:11:49,320
thing about Strider on the NES was not

2318
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:51,320
that bad yeah it was actually based off

2319
02:11:52,320 --> 02:11:53,320
the Strider manga and I was reading and

2320
02:11:54,320 --> 02:11:55,320
I was going I agree I love Strider on the

2321
02:11:56,320 --> 02:11:57,320
NES like it was awesome that's how I

2322
02:11:58,320 --> 02:11:59,320
remember Strider because I didn't own any

2323
02:12:00,320 --> 02:12:01,320
Sega stuff growing up it wasn't till the

2324
02:12:02,320 --> 02:12:03,320
dreamcast well also though if you were a

2325
02:12:04,320 --> 02:12:05,320
big fan though of the arcade Strider

2326
02:12:05,320 --> 02:12:07,320
games that's what that moon dancer is

2327
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:09,320
actually by the guy that made the first

2328
02:12:10,320 --> 02:12:12,320
Strider arcade game and he of course he

2329
02:12:13,320 --> 02:12:15,320
also worked on Strider 2 which is easy

2330
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:18,320
but very fun and but that moon dancer is

2331
02:12:19,320 --> 02:12:20,320
like basically like a four player Strider

2332
02:12:21,320 --> 02:12:23,320
yeah it is it's cool I like that so all

2333
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:26,320
right there you go just interesting that

2334
02:12:27,320 --> 02:12:28,320
that studio was working on all that and

2335
02:12:29,320 --> 02:12:31,320
finally got leaked by a disgruntled

2336
02:12:31,320 --> 02:12:34,320
community well we need more describe I

2337
02:12:35,320 --> 02:12:37,320
mean not really so um you know that

2338
02:12:38,320 --> 02:12:39,320
Oklahoma law that we had actually

2339
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:41,320
discussed before about a bill to put a

2340
02:12:42,320 --> 02:12:44,320
1% tax on violent video games well it

2341
02:12:45,320 --> 02:12:48,320
failed like we knew it would basically

2342
02:12:49,320 --> 02:12:51,320
um god this guy has such an awesomely

2343
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:55,320
badass name too bad he's you know stupid

2344
02:12:55,320 --> 02:13:00,320
william fourkiller fourkiller rawr anyway

2345
02:13:01,320 --> 02:13:03,320
he suggested that any game with an ESRB

2346
02:13:04,320 --> 02:13:05,320
rating of teen or above should have the

2347
02:13:06,320 --> 02:13:07,320
tax on it and that the revenue would go

2348
02:13:08,320 --> 02:13:09,320
to fighting childhood obesity and

2349
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:12,320
bullying it was tweaked to focus on

2350
02:13:13,320 --> 02:13:15,320
creating a task force into the

2351
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:17,320
relationship of video games to the two

2352
02:13:18,320 --> 02:13:20,320
issues and it was voted down by a margin

2353
02:13:20,320 --> 02:13:24,320
of five to six and so one of the other

2354
02:13:25,320 --> 02:13:27,320
representatives Pat OMB asked why video

2355
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:29,320
games why not french fries or rap music

2356
02:13:30,320 --> 02:13:31,320
or movies and fourkiller said we have to

2357
02:13:32,320 --> 02:13:33,320
start somewhere there's no magic bullet

2358
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:35,320
that will solve these issues but I

2359
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:37,320
wanted to raise awareness of those two

2360
02:13:38,320 --> 02:13:40,320
issues and basically everyone said

2361
02:13:41,320 --> 02:13:43,320
representative Mike Reynolds said it's

2362
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:45,320
not a good idea we could have a task

2363
02:13:46,320 --> 02:13:47,320
force on the multiple reasons of

2364
02:13:47,320 --> 02:13:52,320
childhood obesity so nope basically it's

2365
02:13:53,320 --> 02:13:54,320
been failing it failed before in New

2366
02:13:55,320 --> 02:13:56,320
Mexico in 2008 at least your state won't

2367
02:13:57,320 --> 02:13:58,320
be spending 1.8 million dollars to

2368
02:13:59,320 --> 02:14:03,320
defend it in court saying yes exactly

2369
02:14:04,320 --> 02:14:07,320
flu indeed all right anyhow yeah that's

2370
02:14:08,320 --> 02:14:13,320
it moving on Loki all right so we've

2371
02:14:14,320 --> 02:14:15,320
kind of seen this type of thing happen

2372
02:14:15,320 --> 02:14:17,320
before and kind of know where it's gonna

2373
02:14:18,320 --> 02:14:19,320
go but we'll give them the benefit of

2374
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:21,320
the doubt apparently there's a new game

2375
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:23,320
called band fuse that's going to be

2376
02:14:24,320 --> 02:14:25,320
coming out band fuse rock legends it

2377
02:14:26,320 --> 02:14:30,320
uses real guitars to play learn music or

2378
02:14:31,320 --> 02:14:32,320
whatever and also they're having

2379
02:14:33,320 --> 02:14:34,320
microphones involved in this as well so

2380
02:14:35,320 --> 02:14:38,320
they're singing and guitars the kind of

2381
02:14:39,320 --> 02:14:40,320
unique thing about it is actually it's

2382
02:14:41,320 --> 02:14:43,320
real guitar for guitar tabs that are

2383
02:14:43,320 --> 02:14:46,320
gonna be kind of streaming across there

2384
02:14:47,320 --> 02:14:48,320
so it actually shows what frets to use

2385
02:14:49,320 --> 02:14:51,320
and stuff really weird layout there but

2386
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:55,320
they've got you know a bunch of big name

2387
02:14:56,320 --> 02:14:59,320
artists in it as well I want to say this

2388
02:15:00,320 --> 02:15:02,320
is being put out by because I saw this a

2389
02:15:03,320 --> 02:15:04,320
while back and I was like I good another

2390
02:15:05,320 --> 02:15:06,320
music game the guitar game I can't

2391
02:15:07,320 --> 02:15:08,320
remember who's publishing it I want to

2392
02:15:09,320 --> 02:15:10,320
say it's like a really small company like

2393
02:15:10,320 --> 02:15:12,320
maximum family games or something like

2394
02:15:13,320 --> 02:15:16,320
that so it's gonna be like no sort of

2395
02:15:17,320 --> 02:15:22,320
advertising or whatever on it but yeah

2396
02:15:23,320 --> 02:15:24,320
and we coming out this fall and probably

2397
02:15:25,320 --> 02:15:26,320
will do just about as well as what was

2398
02:15:27,320 --> 02:15:30,320
that our gig power gig because I was

2399
02:15:31,320 --> 02:15:33,320
gonna say um I think this game already

2400
02:15:34,320 --> 02:15:36,320
exists like twice well yeah right one of

2401
02:15:37,320 --> 02:15:38,320
one of them is doing pretty well and the

2402
02:15:38,320 --> 02:15:41,320
other one not as well rocksmith did okay

2403
02:15:42,320 --> 02:15:45,320
but power gig tanked right I think it's

2404
02:15:46,320 --> 02:15:49,320
just that whole well you have to buy a

2405
02:15:50,320 --> 02:15:52,320
guitar if you don't already have one and

2406
02:15:53,320 --> 02:15:56,320
I mean if you have one you probably you

2407
02:15:57,320 --> 02:15:58,320
probably have other ways to learn how to

2408
02:15:59,320 --> 02:16:01,320
play guitar other than buying a $60 game

2409
02:16:02,320 --> 02:16:03,320
I well you know what though I think I

2410
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:05,320
talked about this a couple weeks ago on

2411
02:16:05,320 --> 02:16:07,320
the show is that I know I don't know

2412
02:16:08,320 --> 02:16:09,320
anyone who bought power gig but I do know

2413
02:16:10,320 --> 02:16:11,320
some actual musicians who bought

2414
02:16:12,320 --> 02:16:13,320
rocksmith just you know because it was

2415
02:16:14,320 --> 02:16:15,320
kind of something that was relevant to

2416
02:16:16,320 --> 02:16:17,320
their interest and they're really into it

2417
02:16:18,320 --> 02:16:19,320
because it's it's it's so it's it's it's

2418
02:16:20,320 --> 02:16:21,320
actual guitar playing unlike you know

2419
02:16:22,320 --> 02:16:23,320
rock band is where the plastic

2420
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:25,320
instruments although rock band tried to

2421
02:16:26,320 --> 02:16:27,320
incorporate it I guess rocksmith takes a

2422
02:16:28,320 --> 02:16:30,320
much better teaching approach to it you

2423
02:16:31,320 --> 02:16:32,320
know and I think a lot of musicians

2424
02:16:32,320 --> 02:16:34,320
that's what I'm seeing but is it does it

2425
02:16:35,320 --> 02:16:36,320
necessitate three different games no but

2426
02:16:37,320 --> 02:16:38,320
then again we didn't really need rock

2427
02:16:39,320 --> 02:16:43,320
revolution either so this I hate to say

2428
02:16:44,320 --> 02:16:45,320
it but I think this band fuse rock

2429
02:16:46,320 --> 02:16:47,320
legends is gonna end up being the rock

2430
02:16:48,320 --> 02:16:49,320
revolution of the bunch I mean yeah we'll

2431
02:16:50,320 --> 02:16:51,320
see we'll see what they do with it who

2432
02:16:52,320 --> 02:16:56,320
knows so yeah all right anyhow one more

2433
02:16:57,320 --> 02:16:58,320
story for you guys then we're gonna open

2434
02:16:59,320 --> 02:17:00,320
up the skype line and I think this is

2435
02:17:00,320 --> 02:17:05,320
great news an old classic game is coming

2436
02:17:06,320 --> 02:17:10,320
back to the 3ds c-man yay that's right

2437
02:17:11,320 --> 02:17:12,320
c-man get your minds out of the gutter

2438
02:17:13,320 --> 02:17:18,320
c-man with an a c-man is coming out on

2439
02:17:19,320 --> 02:17:21,320
the 3ds it is a report from a japanese

2440
02:17:22,320 --> 02:17:26,320
news outlet named Nick Nick a c-man is

2441
02:17:26,320 --> 02:17:29,320
apparently targeted by Nintendo to come

2442
02:17:30,320 --> 02:17:33,320
back to the 3ds that's the type of thing

2443
02:17:34,320 --> 02:17:35,320
that Nintendo is targeting but there's

2444
02:17:36,320 --> 02:17:37,320
no other detail on the update so I don't

2445
02:17:38,320 --> 02:17:39,320
think we're talking about just like a

2446
02:17:40,320 --> 02:17:41,320
dump of the Dreamcast game I think we're

2447
02:17:42,320 --> 02:17:45,320
talking about like a new reimagining of

2448
02:17:46,320 --> 02:17:47,320
the game which you know is cool because

2449
02:17:48,320 --> 02:17:49,320
they're thinking kind of outside the box

2450
02:17:50,320 --> 02:17:51,320
a little bit with not just a game but

2451
02:17:52,320 --> 02:17:53,320
more of the simulation Jamie you know

2452
02:17:53,320 --> 02:17:55,320
more about this game than the rest of us

2453
02:17:56,320 --> 02:17:57,320
what was c-man like how can you describe

2454
02:17:58,320 --> 02:18:01,320
this game weird um basically you started

2455
02:18:02,320 --> 02:18:03,320
off listening to Leonard Nimoy's voice

2456
02:18:04,320 --> 02:18:06,320
and you got these little eggs and you

2457
02:18:07,320 --> 02:18:08,320
would take care of your little baby

2458
02:18:09,320 --> 02:18:10,320
spores and raise them and they would

2459
02:18:11,320 --> 02:18:12,320
eventually turn into little fishy people

2460
02:18:13,320 --> 02:18:15,320
that would say cute things like marmar

2461
02:18:16,320 --> 02:18:17,320
and you keep talking to them and

2462
02:18:18,320 --> 02:18:19,320
eventually they would start talking back

2463
02:18:20,320 --> 02:18:21,320
and ask you questions and be kind of rude

2464
02:18:21,320 --> 02:18:22,320
to you and then they would eventually

2465
02:18:23,320 --> 02:18:24,320
because you had to moderate their

2466
02:18:25,320 --> 02:18:27,320
temperature in their tank and water level

2467
02:18:28,320 --> 02:18:29,320
and all of this and eventually they would

2468
02:18:30,320 --> 02:18:31,320
grow amphibious and you would turn their

2469
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:33,320
little thing into a terrarium and then

2470
02:18:34,320 --> 02:18:38,320
marmar mar. Dan and I would say that over

2471
02:18:39,320 --> 02:18:40,320
and over again when we were first playing

2472
02:18:41,320 --> 02:18:42,320
that game and then then we got hey you

2473
02:18:43,320 --> 02:18:45,320
pikachu which was which already existed

2474
02:18:46,320 --> 02:18:47,320
oh did it oh I believe it did it was

2475
02:18:48,320 --> 02:18:49,320
actually called Pikachu Genki de Chu

2476
02:18:49,320 --> 02:18:52,320
um and that actually was already out in

2477
02:18:53,320 --> 02:18:55,320
Japan but then it brought us one of the

2478
02:18:56,320 --> 02:18:58,320
best youtubes we've ever played on OLR

2479
02:18:59,320 --> 02:19:00,320
and I'm so excited we have an excuse to

2480
02:19:01,320 --> 02:19:02,320
play this again all credit goes to the

2481
02:19:03,320 --> 02:19:04,320

2482
02:19:05,320 --> 02:19:08,320

played what's on your mind Rama I went

2555
02:23:55,320 --> 02:23:58,320
out and got a 3ds that's why you were

2556
02:23:59,320 --> 02:24:01,320
dogging on the Vita and chat cuz I was

2557
02:24:02,320 --> 02:24:04,320
like man Ron was hating on the Vita oh

2558
02:24:05,320 --> 02:24:06,320
now it's explained you just bought a 3ds

2559
02:24:07,320 --> 02:24:09,320
actually no I have other reasons for

2560
02:24:10,320 --> 02:24:11,320
hating on 3ds all right let's talk about

2561
02:24:12,320 --> 02:24:13,320
your seething hatred first why wait wait

2562
02:24:14,320 --> 02:24:15,320
you have reasons for hating on 3ds not

2563
02:24:16,320 --> 02:24:19,320
no no not the 3ds okay oh what are your

2564
02:24:20,320 --> 02:24:22,320
reasons from hating on the Vita I still

2565
02:24:22,320 --> 02:24:25,320
stand by the point of the price of it I

2566
02:24:26,320 --> 02:24:28,320
mean cuz I remember when the PSP came

2567
02:24:29,320 --> 02:24:30,320
out and I was there selling them and

2568
02:24:31,320 --> 02:24:33,320
then it's like that whole week they sold

2569
02:24:34,320 --> 02:24:35,320
it after that it just dropped nobody

2570
02:24:36,320 --> 02:24:38,320
wanted one there were it just didn't go

2571
02:24:39,320 --> 02:24:41,320
anywhere I just feel that it's the Vita

2572
02:24:42,320 --> 02:24:43,320
may have to say that with the Vita and I

2573
02:24:44,320 --> 02:24:46,320
understand that Sony's going to stand

2574
02:24:47,320 --> 02:24:48,320
with the ps3 for premium system you have

2575
02:24:48,320 --> 02:24:51,320
to pay a premium price I just think that

2576
02:24:52,320 --> 02:24:54,320
Nintendo kind of set the price point of

2577
02:24:55,320 --> 02:24:56,320
where if the comp if the portable

2578
02:24:57,320 --> 02:24:59,320
consoles like under 150 bucks or within

2579
02:25:00,320 --> 02:25:02,320
the 150 $200 range it's well worth it but

2580
02:25:03,320 --> 02:25:05,320
for 249 for a portable console or 299 for

2581
02:25:06,320 --> 02:25:08,320
a full for another portable console you

2582
02:25:09,320 --> 02:25:10,320
better off just buying a regular system

2583
02:25:11,320 --> 02:25:14,320
hooking it up to your TV all right I

2584
02:25:15,320 --> 02:25:16,320
mean I can say that you know I can see

2585
02:25:16,320 --> 02:25:18,320
that the 299 is for the you know 3g model

2586
02:25:19,320 --> 02:25:21,320
and that'll buy a PlayStation 3 so I I

2587
02:25:22,320 --> 02:25:24,320
can see where the price is is hurting

2588
02:25:25,320 --> 02:25:27,320
people but I don't know I'm a sucker for

2589
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:30,320
this shit what can I say I'm not hating

2590
02:25:31,320 --> 02:25:33,320
I'm saying I want a Vita but I will I

2591
02:25:34,320 --> 02:25:35,320
will gladly wait till the price comes

2592
02:25:36,320 --> 02:25:37,320
down you know I just I just can't see you

2593
02:25:38,320 --> 02:25:39,320
know 250 for a portable console but I

2594
02:25:40,320 --> 02:25:42,320
could put that towards a system hook up

2595
02:25:42,320 --> 02:25:45,320
to my TV you know it's you know all

2596
02:25:46,320 --> 02:25:47,320
right so let's let's let's let's make

2597
02:25:48,320 --> 02:25:49,320
this a conversation about love instead

2598
02:25:50,320 --> 02:25:51,320
so you bought your 3ds yeah I'm assuming

2599
02:25:52,320 --> 02:25:55,320
you like it love it yeah mm-hmm well

2600
02:25:56,320 --> 02:25:57,320
what what made you what made you decide

2601
02:25:58,320 --> 02:25:59,320
I'm gonna take the plunge and get a 3ds

2602
02:26:00,320 --> 02:26:05,320
Mario Kart 7 is that it Mario Kart 7 was

2603
02:26:06,320 --> 02:26:07,320
a good enough game where you were like

2604
02:26:08,320 --> 02:26:09,320
that's it I'm buying it or is there stuff

2605
02:26:09,320 --> 02:26:11,320
on the horizon actually at first that's

2606
02:26:12,320 --> 02:26:13,320
what that really did it because I love

2607
02:26:14,320 --> 02:26:15,320
playing a Mario Kart racing games and

2608
02:26:16,320 --> 02:26:17,320
but when I would get my 3ds they were

2609
02:26:18,320 --> 02:26:19,320
sold out of it I'm looking at whatever

2610
02:26:20,320 --> 02:26:22,320
games was left and I found upon the last

2611
02:26:23,320 --> 02:26:25,320
copy of Star Fox 64 3ds I picked that up

2612
02:26:26,320 --> 02:26:27,320
and those are my games I've been playing

2613
02:26:28,320 --> 02:26:31,320
back and forth all right well what are

2614
02:26:32,320 --> 02:26:33,320
you looking forward to in the future from

2615
02:26:34,320 --> 02:26:35,320
3ds or is Mario Kart 7 gonna last you

2616
02:26:36,320 --> 02:26:37,320
through 2013 I don't know it's gonna last

2617
02:26:37,320 --> 02:26:40,320
through 2013 but I've already swap note

2618
02:26:41,320 --> 02:26:44,320
will oh oh yeah 3ds kitties I know I'm

2619
02:26:45,320 --> 02:26:47,320
glad you like the kitty I did do you

2620
02:26:48,320 --> 02:26:49,320
like do you like the 3d cats I send you

2621
02:26:50,320 --> 02:26:52,320
of course now that we have now we have a

2622
02:26:53,320 --> 02:26:54,320
cat his name is India I have to start

2623
02:26:55,320 --> 02:26:56,320
taking a few more shots and sending them

2624
02:26:57,320 --> 02:26:58,320
over to everyone right answer and then

2625
02:26:59,320 --> 02:27:00,320
I'll show your cat to my cat and it'll be

2626
02:27:01,320 --> 02:27:02,320
awkward because cats can't see the 3d but

2627
02:27:02,320 --> 02:27:06,320
anyway yeah I find it kind of amusing

2628
02:27:07,320 --> 02:27:08,320
like you like you say about swap note

2629
02:27:09,320 --> 02:27:10,320
because this whole weekend I'm at manga

2630
02:27:11,320 --> 02:27:14,320
next and as I sit down pull up my 3ds to

2631
02:27:15,320 --> 02:27:17,320
play a game I see the little icon to go

2632
02:27:18,320 --> 02:27:19,320
to the meat Plaza and I'm like going

2633
02:27:20,320 --> 02:27:22,320
through all find me and the puzzle swap

2634
02:27:23,320 --> 02:27:24,320
and I'm like at this rate I will not get

2635
02:27:25,320 --> 02:27:26,320
a chance to play the games that I want

2636
02:27:27,320 --> 02:27:29,320
to play oh yeah it's the cons you get

2637
02:27:29,320 --> 02:27:31,320
that stuff crazy fast like you know I

2638
02:27:32,320 --> 02:27:34,320
can't even tell you last year at e3 keep

2639
02:27:35,320 --> 02:27:36,320
in mind the price drop hadn't happened

2640
02:27:37,320 --> 02:27:38,320
yet I was sitting there in the e3 oh my

2641
02:27:39,320 --> 02:27:40,320
god I just like you would open up your

2642
02:27:41,320 --> 02:27:42,320
3ds and 10 characters are there you

2643
02:27:43,320 --> 02:27:44,320
process them all and good take them

2644
02:27:45,320 --> 02:27:46,320
through find me and then another five

2645
02:27:47,320 --> 02:27:48,320
more have arrived like it's crazy I've

2646
02:27:49,320 --> 02:27:50,320
noticed that at 10 that's it only lets

2647
02:27:51,320 --> 02:27:52,320
you it only lets you to bring 10 friends

2648
02:27:53,320 --> 02:27:58,320
in at a time yes tip and pro tip so but

2649
02:27:58,320 --> 02:28:00,320
now there's find me too and now there's

2650
02:28:01,320 --> 02:28:03,320
puzzle swaps and been bigger so there's

2651
02:28:04,320 --> 02:28:05,320
even more to StreetPass with and I will

2652
02:28:06,320 --> 02:28:07,320
say this since we kind of talking about

2653
02:28:08,320 --> 02:28:10,320
the Vita versus the 3ds the street

2654
02:28:11,320 --> 02:28:12,320
passing makes a lot more sense than near

2655
02:28:13,320 --> 02:28:14,320
to me right now I don't get near near

2656
02:28:15,320 --> 02:28:16,320

2657
02:28:17,320 --> 02:28:20,320
free shit the app Rob click the button

2658
02:28:21,320 --> 02:28:22,320

2774
02:34:01,320 --> 02:34:03,320
I've seen on the TV I like the girl with

2775
02:34:04,320 --> 02:34:05,320

2776
02:34:06,320 --> 02:34:07,320
it's time for some girl power and I want

2777
02:34:08,320 --> 02:34:09,320

listening tonight because of the Oscars

2840
02:36:44,320 --> 02:36:45,320
and all that stuff but our chat rooms

2841
02:36:46,320 --> 02:36:47,320
hopping so I'm surprised there's not more

2842
02:36:48,320 --> 02:36:49,320
people wanting to call but if you all

2843
02:36:50,320 --> 02:36:51,320
are gonna be shy that's fine going to

2844
02:36:52,320 --> 02:36:53,320
Twitter Tiger Claw sent me a lot of links

2845
02:36:54,320 --> 02:36:55,320
and get this we talked about all these

2846
02:36:56,320 --> 02:36:57,320
things on the show Tiger Claw you forgot

2847
02:36:58,320 --> 02:36:59,320
pac-man on DVD we talked about that last

2848
02:37:00,320 --> 02:37:01,320
week that's all right I sometimes forget

2849
02:37:01,320 --> 02:37:03,320
that I will say this act-def sent me a

2850
02:37:04,320 --> 02:37:06,320
tweet about another victim of Xbox Live

2851
02:37:07,320 --> 02:37:08,320
hackings because you know this shit is

2852
02:37:09,320 --> 02:37:10,320
still going on and yet still no word from

2853
02:37:11,320 --> 02:37:12,320
Microsoft but I found this interesting he

2854
02:37:13,320 --> 02:37:14,320
sent me a screen grab of a forum post I

2855
02:37:15,320 --> 02:37:16,320
don't know what forum this is but he sent

2856
02:37:17,320 --> 02:37:19,320
me this thing and what's interesting

2857
02:37:20,320 --> 02:37:21,320
about this guy is he's saying that they

2858
02:37:22,320 --> 02:37:23,320
bought four thousand points on his

2859
02:37:24,320 --> 02:37:26,320
account but not with his credit card he

2860
02:37:27,320 --> 02:37:28,320
never had linked his credit card to the

2861
02:37:28,320 --> 02:37:30,320
accounts they bought four thousand point

2862
02:37:31,320 --> 02:37:32,320
they they took his account linked it to

2863
02:37:33,320 --> 02:37:34,320
another count and then bought four

2864
02:37:35,320 --> 02:37:36,320
thousand points with somebody else's

2865
02:37:37,320 --> 02:37:38,320
credit card which was probably stolen

2866
02:37:39,320 --> 02:37:40,320
let's be real sad to know and I guess he

2867
02:37:41,320 --> 02:37:42,320
called and got off the phone or whatever

2868
02:37:43,320 --> 02:37:44,320
apparently the tech people thought they

2869
02:37:45,320 --> 02:37:46,320
wanted to access an idle account so they

2870
02:37:47,320 --> 02:37:48,320
could download whatever was on it already

2871
02:37:49,320 --> 02:37:50,320
you know whatever had been licensed to it

2872
02:37:51,320 --> 02:37:52,320
and that made me think about when my

2873
02:37:53,320 --> 02:37:54,320
Xbox got hacked some time ago oh my god I

2874
02:37:55,320 --> 02:37:56,320
used to buy like every Xbox Live arcade

2875
02:37:56,320 --> 02:37:57,320
game that was released that person if

2876
02:37:58,320 --> 02:37:59,320
they were if they knew to do it was

2877
02:38:00,320 --> 02:38:01,320
probably able to get like 80 90 get I'm

2878
02:38:02,320 --> 02:38:03,320
serious I had a problem I looked on a

2879
02:38:04,320 --> 02:38:05,320
slide for a while since you mentioned it

2880
02:38:06,320 --> 02:38:07,320
out of curiosity went to the hacked on

2881
02:38:08,320 --> 02:38:11,320
xbox.com site again they have 49 unresolved

2882
02:38:12,320 --> 02:38:13,320
case stories right now two that have

2883
02:38:14,320 --> 02:38:16,320
moved from unresolved to resolved so wow

2884
02:38:17,320 --> 02:38:19,320
you know and here's the thing is that I

2885
02:38:20,320 --> 02:38:21,320
know 49 doesn't sound like a lot but

2886
02:38:22,320 --> 02:38:24,320
that's 49 people who know about this

2887
02:38:24,320 --> 02:38:27,320
website who are in the gaming you know

2888
02:38:28,320 --> 02:38:29,320
there's tons of people getting hacked we

2889
02:38:30,320 --> 02:38:31,320
don't even know about like one of my

2890
02:38:32,320 --> 02:38:33,320
friends from high school was hacked and

2891
02:38:34,320 --> 02:38:35,320
you know he wouldn't seek out a gaming

2892
02:38:36,320 --> 02:38:37,320
community to post it he also hadn't

2893
02:38:38,320 --> 02:38:39,320
played his Xbox in like six months at

2894
02:38:40,320 --> 02:38:41,320
least all right I will Tiger Claw said

2895
02:38:42,320 --> 02:38:43,320
oh but I want to get one story and so

2896
02:38:44,320 --> 02:38:45,320
how about this one I said okay so he

2897
02:38:46,320 --> 02:38:47,320
sent us this tweet and I guess I'll close

2898
02:38:48,320 --> 02:38:49,320
with this because our skype line is

2899
02:38:50,320 --> 02:38:51,320
either broken or I don't know but this

2900
02:38:51,320 --> 02:38:53,320
topic from Edge magazine he tweeted us

2901
02:38:54,320 --> 02:38:57,320
Awada throwing shade at Nikkei Japanese

2902
02:38:58,320 --> 02:38:59,320
news outlet Nikkei which we brought up

2903
02:39:00,320 --> 02:39:01,320
earlier in the show he's saying quote

2904
02:39:02,320 --> 02:39:04,320
gossip magazine techniques apparently

2905
02:39:05,320 --> 02:39:06,320
this is because Nikkei on the website

2906
02:39:07,320 --> 02:39:08,320
ran a story which said Nintendo is trying

2907
02:39:09,320 --> 02:39:12,320
to bring back titles like C-man oh so

2908
02:39:13,320 --> 02:39:16,320
apparently it said that Awada had a quote

2909
02:39:17,320 --> 02:39:18,320
that said unless Nintendo changed its

2910
02:39:18,320 --> 02:39:20,320
ways as a matter of urgency it would

2911
02:39:21,320 --> 02:39:23,320
collapse and Awada went to Twitter and

2912
02:39:24,320 --> 02:39:25,320
said this is inaccurate this continues

2913
02:39:26,320 --> 02:39:28,320
repeatedly and it's gossip magazine

2914
02:39:29,320 --> 02:39:32,320
techniques interesting very similar to

2915
02:39:33,320 --> 02:39:34,320
another thing I was reading on the

2916
02:39:35,320 --> 02:39:36,320
internet you know penny arcade has their

2917
02:39:37,320 --> 02:39:38,320
new little press site thing the PA report

2918
02:39:39,320 --> 02:39:40,320
right which is it's it's a neat concept

2919
02:39:41,320 --> 02:39:42,320
for a site because it really focuses on

2920
02:39:43,320 --> 02:39:44,320
features and lets other people handle

2921
02:39:45,320 --> 02:39:46,320
the news which I think is a smart way to

2922
02:39:46,320 --> 02:39:48,320
do this because it's so hard right now to

2923
02:39:49,320 --> 02:39:50,320
stay on top of the news and all that and

2924
02:39:51,320 --> 02:39:53,320
there's this article on David Jaff where

2925
02:39:54,320 --> 02:39:55,320
he got in a verbal confrontation one of

2926
02:39:56,320 --> 02:39:57,320
the one of the guys from Kotaku what and

2927
02:39:58,320 --> 02:39:59,320
the guy from PA report is there and has

2928
02:40:00,320 --> 02:40:02,320
it on tape and it's what David Jaff

2929
02:40:03,320 --> 02:40:04,320
getting in a confrontation with somebody

2930
02:40:05,320 --> 02:40:07,320
and throwing throwing colorful languages

2931
02:40:08,320 --> 02:40:10,320
in the mix I don't believe it that is

2932
02:40:11,320 --> 02:40:14,320
gotta be fake he's not a like a complete

2933
02:40:14,320 --> 02:40:17,320
douche or anything no he would never do

2934
02:40:18,320 --> 02:40:21,320
that I'm serious him and fucking cliffy

2935
02:40:22,320 --> 02:40:23,320
bean even get the fucking argument right

2936
02:40:24,320 --> 02:40:27,320
there that I would pay to see douche off

2937
02:40:28,320 --> 02:40:31,320
go all right well the skype line ain't

2938
02:40:32,320 --> 02:40:33,320
working I guess I'm getting private

2939
02:40:34,320 --> 02:40:35,320
messages from people saying they're

2940
02:40:36,320 --> 02:40:37,320
trying to call and it's not working so I

2941
02:40:38,320 --> 02:40:41,320
IDK what skype not working that's got to

2942
02:40:41,320 --> 02:40:44,320
be a load of crap I know I know all right

2943
02:40:45,320 --> 02:40:46,320
well well I got a private message from

2944
02:40:47,320 --> 02:40:48,320
Jester Scott saying I can't get through

2945
02:40:49,320 --> 02:40:50,320
I wanted to call and say thank you for

2946
02:40:51,320 --> 02:40:52,320
the show and keep up the good work oh

2947
02:40:53,320 --> 02:40:54,320
it's nice warm fuzzies warm fuzzies

2948
02:40:55,320 --> 02:40:57,320
group hug red velvet cookies for all but

2949
02:40:58,320 --> 02:40:59,320
I guess Skype fail and as other people

2950
02:41:00,320 --> 02:41:01,320
in the chat room are saying Rama broke

2951
02:41:02,320 --> 02:41:03,320
it all right I'll accept that reasoning

2952
02:41:04,320 --> 02:41:07,320
Rama broke it thank you Rama Loki any

2953
02:41:08,320 --> 02:41:09,320
last-minute stories you want to get out

2954
02:41:09,320 --> 02:41:11,320
for we say goodnight tonight uh yeah I

2955
02:41:12,320 --> 02:41:13,320
was reading on some stuff because I

2956
02:41:14,320 --> 02:41:16,320
subscribe to the dash hack network thing

2957
02:41:17,320 --> 02:41:18,320
talking about hacking stuff apparently

2958
02:41:19,320 --> 02:41:20,320
you know these new system updates that

2959
02:41:21,320 --> 02:41:22,320
they keep rolling out from Microsoft's

2960
02:41:23,320 --> 02:41:25,320
Xbox and how they're you know fixing

2961
02:41:26,320 --> 02:41:27,320
color correction problems of you know

2962
02:41:28,320 --> 02:41:29,320
when they're patching something that has

2963
02:41:30,320 --> 02:41:31,320
to do color correction that kind of stuff

2964
02:41:32,320 --> 02:41:33,320
that's not exactly what they're doing

2965
02:41:34,320 --> 02:41:35,320
there of course patching out the reset

2966
02:41:36,320 --> 02:41:37,320
glitch hacks which basically allows you

2967
02:41:37,320 --> 02:41:40,320
to j-tag any console out there however

2968
02:41:41,320 --> 02:41:43,320
team executor one of the hack groups

2969
02:41:44,320 --> 02:41:45,320
behind a lot of the tools are available

2970
02:41:46,320 --> 02:41:47,320
out there they have a new device coming

2971
02:41:48,320 --> 02:41:49,320
out called the executor demon which with

2972
02:41:50,320 --> 02:41:51,320
a new technique that they figured out how

2973
02:41:52,320 --> 02:41:54,320
to reset glitch hacks their consoles will

2974
02:41:55,320 --> 02:41:56,320
be unstoppable it's basically there's no

2975
02:41:57,320 --> 02:42:00,320
way to patch this out so that sounds like

2976
02:42:01,320 --> 02:42:02,320
they're pulling a Sony unhackable no way

2977
02:42:03,320 --> 02:42:05,320
to patch well apparently it I don't know

2978
02:42:05,320 --> 02:42:07,320
what's involved with it but this new chip

2979
02:42:08,320 --> 02:42:09,320
it will make it impossible for them to

2980
02:42:10,320 --> 02:42:15,320
patch it out so neat all right if that's

2981
02:42:16,320 --> 02:42:20,320
it for the last minute stories then I'm

2982
02:42:21,320 --> 02:42:22,320
gonna go around and get everybody's final

2983
02:42:23,320 --> 02:42:24,320
thought dark soccer will start with you

2984
02:42:25,320 --> 02:42:27,320
ladies first um I shouldn't have eaten so

2985
02:42:28,320 --> 02:42:29,320
early because I'm freaking hungry and

2986
02:42:30,320 --> 02:42:33,320
like with my stressful ass day I ate no

2987
02:42:33,320 --> 02:42:35,320
lunch really you want another one of those

2988
02:42:36,320 --> 02:42:37,320
gingerbread pita chips because they're

2989
02:42:38,320 --> 02:42:39,320
really good no it actually had a little

2990
02:42:40,320 --> 02:42:42,320
bit too much bite for me all right Loki

2991
02:42:43,320 --> 02:42:45,320
your final thought my final thought is I

2992
02:42:46,320 --> 02:42:48,320
really hope that this game of luminous I'm

2993
02:42:49,320 --> 02:42:50,320
playing actually records because the last

2994
02:42:51,320 --> 02:42:52,320
four of them that I've done and yes I did

2995
02:42:53,320 --> 02:42:55,320
eventually hit quit so that this you know

2996
02:42:56,320 --> 02:42:57,320
it would record my score or something like

2997
02:42:58,320 --> 02:43:00,320
that have not recorded and reset each

2998
02:43:00,320 --> 02:43:03,320
time so it's kind of annoying my final

2999
02:43:04,320 --> 02:43:05,320
thought for tonight is you know we've

3000
02:43:06,320 --> 02:43:07,320
been doing this thing where we talk about

3001
02:43:08,320 --> 02:43:09,320
video games in the same room without

3002
02:43:10,320 --> 02:43:11,320
Skype because you know Skype clearly

3003
02:43:12,320 --> 02:43:13,320
doesn't even want to work half the time

3004
02:43:14,320 --> 02:43:15,320
as you can see tonight we've been doing

3005
02:43:16,320 --> 02:43:17,320
it this way for going on 10 years this

3006
02:43:18,320 --> 02:43:20,320
June and you know not once have we ever

3007
02:43:21,320 --> 02:43:22,320
asked for any of your money to keep this

3008
02:43:23,320 --> 02:43:25,320
going and we plan to keep it that way

3009
02:43:26,320 --> 02:43:28,320
you guys being here in chat is enough

3010
02:43:28,320 --> 02:43:29,320
reward for us and is the motivation we

3011
02:43:30,320 --> 02:43:31,320
