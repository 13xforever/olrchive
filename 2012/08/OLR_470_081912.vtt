WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.960
Tonight, August 19th, 2012, we run down the news from Gamescom, the 3DS XL is released,

00:20.960 --> 00:31.680
and the Neo Geo console is set to be released all over again.

00:31.680 --> 00:35.320
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.320 --> 00:37.400
where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.400 --> 00:43.220
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, for this

00:43.220 --> 00:49.820
August 19th, 2012, with the 470th episode of our program.

00:49.820 --> 00:53.480
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about everything

00:53.480 --> 00:57.200
going on in the world of gaming, and then some, with my co-hosts.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.760
First off, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

00:59.760 --> 01:00.760
Hi.

01:00.760 --> 01:01.760
How are you ma'am?

01:01.760 --> 01:02.760
I'm sore.

01:02.760 --> 01:03.760
Sore?

01:03.760 --> 01:04.760
Yes.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.960
What have you been doing that's made you sore?

01:06.960 --> 01:07.960
Well, hey!

01:07.960 --> 01:09.880
What kind of girl do you think I am?

01:09.880 --> 01:11.080
A DDR playing girl?

01:11.080 --> 01:12.080
Yes, actually.

01:12.080 --> 01:13.080
Oh, okay.

01:13.080 --> 01:14.480
We'll touch on that in a minute.

01:14.480 --> 01:15.480
Alright, fair enough.

01:15.480 --> 01:16.680
Say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.

01:16.680 --> 01:17.680
Hi.

01:17.680 --> 01:18.680
How are you doing, Loki?

01:18.680 --> 01:19.680
Doing good.

01:19.680 --> 01:24.400
What food won the, for those that play the home game of betting on what you bring in

01:24.400 --> 01:26.400
for food every week, what won this week?

01:26.400 --> 01:30.440
The Double Western at Carl's Jr., or Hardee's on the East Coast.

01:30.440 --> 01:31.440
There you go.

01:31.440 --> 01:35.760
Alright, oh, of course, the always present fourth guest on our show is you guys at our

01:35.760 --> 01:41.520
chat room, live.vognetwork.com, and we'll be reading some of the comments from our chat

01:41.520 --> 01:45.320
room throughout the night, so be sure to get in there so you can participate with us.

01:45.320 --> 01:48.080
Just the three of us in studio, this is the first show in a little while, it seems like,

01:48.080 --> 01:49.080
with no guests.

01:49.080 --> 01:50.080
It's a little lonely.

01:50.080 --> 01:53.040
It's a little lonely and sad in here tonight, and I don't know how we're going to top last

01:53.040 --> 01:54.040
week's episode.

01:54.040 --> 01:57.420
That was a pretty good episode, so we'll try though.

01:57.420 --> 01:59.920
We'll bring our best C game tonight.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.160
No, you know what?

02:01.160 --> 02:02.960
We actually have some awesome things tonight that are-

02:02.960 --> 02:06.320
We could point a webcam at my boobs or something, I don't know.

02:06.320 --> 02:08.880
Oh, the webcam's in the other, no, you took the webcam, didn't you?

02:08.880 --> 02:10.820
I did take it, and it works.

02:10.820 --> 02:13.880
You confiscated it, so no booby cam tonight.

02:13.880 --> 02:14.880
No booby cam.

02:14.880 --> 02:17.960
Well, it's so unfortunate that your Dell million doesn't have a webcam built into it.

02:17.960 --> 02:18.960
Oh, wait, it does.

02:18.960 --> 02:19.960
That's true.

02:19.960 --> 02:20.960
I do have my iPad.

02:20.960 --> 02:21.960
No.

02:21.960 --> 02:23.360
And the Ustream app on the iPad.

02:23.360 --> 02:29.080
And I've made sure that the webcam stuff is disabled on my laptop, because I deleted all

02:29.080 --> 02:31.400
the Windows shit and have the Linux shit, so.

02:31.400 --> 02:35.640
All right, in all seriousness, we have some fun stuff going on tonight.

02:35.640 --> 02:41.000
We have a soundtrack preview going on tonight, which is pretty cool, from the Darksiders

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
to Soundtrack.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.920
And this is going to be both for the podcast listeners and the live listeners, thanks to

02:45.920 --> 02:50.920
Something Music, S-U-M, Thing, but I'll talk more about that later on, but there's all

02:50.920 --> 02:55.640
sorts of information on where you can get the soundtrack at our website, vognetwork.com.

02:55.640 --> 03:00.720
Of course, the Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com is the website where we tape our show live

03:00.720 --> 03:06.040
for you kids every Sunday night at 6 p.m. Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after our

03:06.040 --> 03:11.040
pal Bobby Black Wolf with his show, The Bobby Black Wolf Show, at 5 Pacific, 8 Eastern,

03:11.040 --> 03:12.040
every Sunday.

03:12.040 --> 03:15.360
And lots of other great shows at the Voice of Geeks Network as well.

03:15.360 --> 03:19.760
Not just gaming shows, but shows about TV talk, like Critical Myth, and they do some

03:19.760 --> 03:24.280
movies as well, British Invaders, kind of a similar thing, but with a very British twist.

03:24.280 --> 03:28.440
Pod Culture is awesome, and Pod Culture's got something special tomorrow.

03:28.440 --> 03:31.960
They're back with an all-new episode, they've been off for a couple weeks, but they are

03:31.960 --> 03:38.000
talking to somebody who's publishing a series of books, and I'm not sure if I'm supposed

03:38.000 --> 03:42.120
to give, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to say this, so a little preview, they're actually

03:42.120 --> 03:47.640
doing a giveaway, so be sure to tune in and check that out at Pod Culture.

03:47.640 --> 03:48.640
Lots of other great shows too.

03:48.640 --> 03:54.240
Anime Jam Session, Girls Gone Wild, Hoard House, Hoard House is okay, but the rest of

03:54.240 --> 03:55.240
the shows are great.

03:55.240 --> 04:00.640
All right, let's see, we usually start off the show talking about our gaming weeks, but

04:00.640 --> 04:04.880
we usually have a kick-off topic, and I thought I'd bring up something that's a little bit

04:04.880 --> 04:05.880
recurring.

04:05.880 --> 04:06.880
Crack!

04:06.880 --> 04:09.560
What was the first time we talked about crack on the show?

04:09.560 --> 04:10.560
No, no.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.240
Two drugs, kids, drugs are bad.

04:12.240 --> 04:17.200
So okay, y'all know we have a little bit of a history with Kickstarter, and kind of like

04:17.200 --> 04:21.440
talking about that site, and we're not always a fan of a lot of the things we see on Kickstarter,

04:21.440 --> 04:25.240
or at least I should say, I'm not always a fan of a lot of the stuff I see on Kickstarter.

04:25.240 --> 04:28.600
Dark Soccer has not always been a fan of the stuff she sees on Kickstarter.

04:28.600 --> 04:32.040
Loki has contributed way too many Kickstarters.

04:32.040 --> 04:33.800
It wasn't that many.

04:33.800 --> 04:34.800
How many?

04:34.800 --> 04:35.800
How many?

04:35.800 --> 04:36.800
How many's not that many?

04:36.800 --> 04:39.800
It's at least five, right?

04:39.800 --> 04:40.800
Six.

04:40.800 --> 04:41.800
See?

04:41.800 --> 04:42.800
Seven, I'm sorry.

04:42.800 --> 04:45.520
All right, well here's the point.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.440
I donated to a Kickstarter this week.

04:47.440 --> 04:50.440
I actually finally joined the website.

04:50.440 --> 04:52.720
I signed up for Kickstarter.

04:52.720 --> 04:54.760
It was to expand the Mantis website.

04:54.760 --> 04:55.760
No, no.

04:55.760 --> 04:56.760
Heck no.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.760
Oh, make that nine.

04:58.760 --> 04:59.760
Sorry.

04:59.760 --> 05:00.760
Nine Kickstarters?

05:00.760 --> 05:01.760
Suddenly, this week...

05:01.760 --> 05:04.800
You know, you can just take that money and give it to me, and I'll put it to better use.

05:04.800 --> 05:07.760
This week from maybe five to nine?

05:07.760 --> 05:09.200
Well, there was some I forgot.

05:09.200 --> 05:12.880
I forgot, you know, I forgot about those playing cards.

05:12.880 --> 05:13.880
And they're awesome.

05:13.880 --> 05:14.880
They are.

05:14.880 --> 05:15.880
Dan was like, wow, that's cool.

05:15.880 --> 05:19.040
I forgot about the Megran thing, which I'm still waiting on.

05:19.040 --> 05:23.240
There's apparently the comic coming too, but you know, it's still coming, and then Shadowrun

05:23.240 --> 05:24.240
Returns.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.240
Shadowrun Returns would be awesome.

05:25.240 --> 05:26.800
Can't wait for that.

05:26.800 --> 05:31.920
But yeah, so I actually donated to a Kickstarter this week.

05:31.920 --> 05:40.560
I even went so far as to donate $180 to this Kickstarter, $180 to this Kickstarter.

05:40.560 --> 05:45.000
Cue dramatic chipmunk or prairie dog.

05:45.000 --> 05:52.160
There's nothing like a meme from five years ago to lighten the mood.

05:52.160 --> 05:59.580
I gave 180 bucks to the GamerCon Kickstarter, the G-A-Y GamerCon Kickstarter.

05:59.580 --> 06:04.840
I think it's a great idea, and I can totally see where being a startup event, they really

06:04.840 --> 06:09.480
need the money to be able to reserve the venue and do something big, and it's been great

06:09.480 --> 06:10.600
promotion for them.

06:10.600 --> 06:14.240
And you know, as somebody who's a gamer myself, it's something I want to support.

06:14.240 --> 06:18.860
So Alan kind of made it known that he wouldn't mind going, and I wouldn't mind going.

06:18.860 --> 06:22.080
So if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do it big.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.820
I don't do anything half-assed.

06:23.820 --> 06:27.840
So I threw down for VIP passes for both Alan and I, which sent me back 180 bucks.

06:27.840 --> 06:29.780
So yeah, there you go.

06:29.780 --> 06:30.780
I donated to a Kickstarter.

06:30.780 --> 06:33.360
You going to judge me, anybody?

06:33.360 --> 06:34.600
Dark Soccer, you want to judge me?

06:34.600 --> 06:38.300
I'm totally not judging you, but that means I can start my Kickstarters to support me

06:38.300 --> 06:40.000
while I write a book.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.320
I'll give you 50 cents.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.320
What will that get me?

06:44.320 --> 06:46.320
It'll get you a fart.

06:46.320 --> 06:51.320
No, but I know there's a lot of people that are like, why does there have to be a GamerCon?

06:51.320 --> 06:56.240
Does that mean there's going to be a StraightmerCon, and you know, just kind of all this.

06:56.240 --> 06:59.200
Well Straightmer doesn't have the same ring to it, whereas gamer sounds like-

06:59.200 --> 07:02.600
Heterocon or whatever it is.

07:02.600 --> 07:03.600
It's not that-

07:03.600 --> 07:07.660
If I can get the boobies in there, that'd be kind of cool.

07:07.660 --> 07:08.660
Here's the thing-

07:08.660 --> 07:09.660
I bet there is a BoobCon.

07:09.660 --> 07:10.660
I'm going to look for it.

07:10.660 --> 07:11.660
Here's the thing.

07:11.660 --> 07:16.720
Okay, BoobCon is every other gaming convention, and there'll probably be some BoobCon at GamerCon.

07:16.720 --> 07:18.280
Let's not forget the lesbians.

07:18.280 --> 07:20.560
There is a BoobCon.

07:20.560 --> 07:21.560
I think that's-

07:21.560 --> 07:24.100
Oh, it's a Facebook utility.

07:24.100 --> 07:30.940
The whole thing is, is that, you know, I like the idea of having this event and to bring

07:30.940 --> 07:34.120
gay gamers together, because I've met a lot of really cool people.

07:34.120 --> 07:38.720
One of my really good friends I met at a gay gamer event in the Bay Area, and we're friends

07:38.720 --> 07:39.720
to this day.

07:39.720 --> 07:43.720
My friend Spike, who is one of the co-hosts on the Game Buoy, we met at like one of those

07:43.720 --> 07:49.280
gay gamer parties, and you know, it's not that straight people are forbidden from coming.

07:49.280 --> 07:54.320
In fact, I'm sure DarkSakura is going to pre-order as soon as she's got them, as soon as she

07:54.320 --> 07:57.520
has her Kickstarter funded, she's going to pre-order a ticket to GamerCon, right?

07:57.520 --> 07:58.520
I'd go.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.520
Yeah.

07:59.520 --> 08:02.340
I don't know that I'd be able to afford, you know, $90 tickets.

08:02.340 --> 08:05.400
You're not going to be shunned because you have boobies, and you're not going to be shunned-

08:05.400 --> 08:10.160
I'll just wear a shirt that says HAG.

08:10.160 --> 08:17.800
But here's the other thing, is that, you know, obviously, I don't know how far I want to

08:17.800 --> 08:24.040
go with this controversial topic or whatever, but in the gaming culture, you know, a lot

08:24.040 --> 08:30.600
of times gay guys and ladies have to put up with all this garbage we hear on Xbox Live

08:30.600 --> 08:35.980
and, you know, FAG, FAG, FAG, and it's not like we're alone, there's a lot of like racist

08:35.980 --> 08:40.020
stuff that happens, there's a lot of like really, really bad things that happen on Xbox

08:40.020 --> 08:41.020
Live.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.020
Why do you think I only play with you guys?

08:42.020 --> 08:46.800
And everything negative usually has some type of connotation to like, oh so-and-so's a fag,

08:46.800 --> 08:47.800
ugh.

08:47.800 --> 08:50.840
It's because the people that play on Xbox Live, and actually just a lot of people that

08:50.840 --> 08:55.600
play games nowadays online, are very unintelligent and young.

08:55.600 --> 08:59.320
I know that for a fact from the modding community, that I talk to these people directly, and

08:59.320 --> 09:04.360
it's like, can you guys compose an actual sentence without sounding stup- or like, seriously,

09:04.360 --> 09:09.000
can you compose a sentence that actually makes sense, that doesn't have like any sort of

09:09.000 --> 09:11.880
complete misspellings of everything?

09:11.880 --> 09:16.360
But here's, here's the other part that I think a lot of people ignore.

09:16.360 --> 09:21.680
And that is that, as a gay guy, there's a lot of judgment that happens in gay culture

09:21.680 --> 09:22.680
as well.

09:22.680 --> 09:26.560
I know, that might be shocking to you, but sometimes as a gay gamer, I don't wanna s-

09:26.560 --> 09:30.960
I don't wanna sound like, oh poor me, or I've had a tragic life, no, I've had a great life.

09:30.960 --> 09:37.280
But I have faced sometimes, you know, in the gay culture even, people like, oh, you s-

09:37.280 --> 09:39.160
play video games all day?

09:39.160 --> 09:42.040
You mean you don't like, you don't like to, uh-

09:42.040 --> 09:43.040
Accessorize?

09:43.040 --> 09:47.840
You don't like to go to concerts, or you don't listen to such and such artists, or you don't

09:47.840 --> 09:51.480
read such and such blogs, or you know, a lot of those types of things.

09:51.480 --> 09:52.480
Shun!

09:52.480 --> 09:53.480
Exactly!

09:53.480 --> 09:57.480
I ha- I, I know this might be a thing I'm not supposed to say, but it's true.

09:57.480 --> 10:00.080
I have faced some of that in the gay culture.

10:00.080 --> 10:03.500
So it's tough sometimes, because you don't feel like you fit in column A, you don't feel

10:03.500 --> 10:08.960
like you fit in column B. So, I think there- it's, it's really awesome that there's a lot

10:08.960 --> 10:13.460
of people raising their voice, thanks to, you know, the internet, that feel like they

10:13.460 --> 10:18.160
kind of don't fit in these columns, and having a convention to just celebrate.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.160
We're here!

10:19.160 --> 10:23.560
And it, there's- I don't, I don't think the, the con exists to make a statement, or the

10:23.560 --> 10:27.280
con exists to, uh, further the cause, or whatever.

10:27.280 --> 10:31.440
I think the con exists to have fun, and that's what I plan to do.

10:31.440 --> 10:35.560
I'm just gonna have, I'm gonna have a gay old time, and gay isn't happy.

10:35.560 --> 10:36.560
I'm gonna have a gay old time.

10:36.560 --> 10:39.400
It's gonna be a good time.

10:39.400 --> 10:44.560
Well, I mean, the only other equivalent is YowieCon, really.

10:44.560 --> 10:45.560
And YowieCon exists.

10:45.560 --> 10:49.840
And that's more for girls.

10:49.840 --> 10:53.960
I think GamerCon is just for, for anybody that just wants to have fun.

10:53.960 --> 10:56.280
Sounds- In a supportive environment.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.280
Great.

10:57.280 --> 10:59.680
And besides that, you were talking about columns?

10:59.680 --> 11:00.680
Fuck columns.

11:00.680 --> 11:01.680
That game was shit.

11:01.680 --> 11:02.680
No.

11:02.680 --> 11:03.680
No, no, no.

11:03.680 --> 11:09.240
I, I think that the moment we can move past labels and pointing fingers is why, you know,

11:09.240 --> 11:15.080
when anyone says, well, I have this, or I am this, I'm like, um, you look like you're

11:15.080 --> 11:17.440
a human being to me.

11:17.440 --> 11:18.440
Act like it?

11:18.440 --> 11:19.440
Mm-hmm.

11:19.440 --> 11:20.440
So, yeah.

11:20.440 --> 11:21.440
So.

11:21.440 --> 11:22.440
Anyhow.

11:22.440 --> 11:23.440
I mean, this is what I'm just talki- oh, sorry.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.440
No, go ahead.

11:24.440 --> 11:25.880
I was gonna go to some chat comments, but go ahead.

11:25.880 --> 11:29.080
This is what I was talking about, about people that can't fucking complete sentences.

11:29.080 --> 11:32.640
Okay, this is the guy that I'm talking to right now, I'm working on some Grand Theft

11:32.640 --> 11:34.920
Auto mods, okay?

11:34.920 --> 11:38.560
Did you, you know, just let her you get it to work, okay, that makes sense.

11:38.560 --> 11:40.120
How about this one?

11:40.120 --> 11:42.360
Should we take thing away?

11:42.360 --> 11:51.760
Um, okay, just let me know, because trying to get it by today, um, okay, that is fine,

11:51.760 --> 11:55.040
what do you thi- what do you think it is?

11:55.040 --> 12:00.120
And just let me know when you get it to work.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.520
Oh my fucking god.

12:01.520 --> 12:03.640
How is Babbie formed?

12:03.640 --> 12:09.040
It's like, seriously, it, ugh.

12:09.040 --> 12:13.200
Let me go to some comments from our chat room at, uh, live.vognetwork.com, where we have

12:13.200 --> 12:15.680
plenty of folks in chat participating live with us tonight.

12:15.680 --> 12:18.660
JV Mon wants to know, where is GamerCon anyway?

12:18.660 --> 12:22.280
They haven't picked a venue yet, it's gonna be in San Francisco, they've said that much,

12:22.280 --> 12:25.080
but we don't know what venue, I mean, that could be a lot of different places, that could

12:25.080 --> 12:28.360
be a hotel, they could do it at the Hilton, they could do it at the Moscone Center if

12:28.360 --> 12:32.400
they get enough money, I don't know where they're gonna have it yet, um, so, more to

12:32.400 --> 12:36.920
come on that, but it will be in San Francisco somewhere, uh, Acidic Vamp- which is another

12:36.920 --> 12:41.320
reason why I wanted to go, is that, you know, San Francisco's only a two-hour drive for

12:41.320 --> 12:44.600
me, I could drive in and out every day if I wanted to, but I have some friends in the

12:44.600 --> 12:48.960
city, like Grandpa from Hoard House I could stay with if I wanted to, um, Acidic Vampire

12:48.960 --> 12:54.240
in chat says, to find more gamers, because- G-A-Y-mers, because it's like a needle in

12:54.240 --> 12:55.680
a haystack sometimes.

12:55.680 --> 13:01.200
Uh, Raginator says, sadly enough, when someone proclaims that they're a gamer to someone,

13:01.200 --> 13:05.280
the other person immediately pictures a fat, balding, middle-aged slob eating Cheetos in

13:05.280 --> 13:07.800
their mom's basement and never goes outside.

13:07.800 --> 13:10.480
Hey, I like Cheetos, just for the record.

13:10.480 --> 13:11.480
Ew!

13:11.480 --> 13:14.160
But ex- but no, I mean, exactly the point, is that, you know, there's kind of these,

13:14.160 --> 13:18.280
like, stereotypes, and it- it's throughout all of our cultures, so.

13:18.280 --> 13:21.000
And speaking of Cheetos, you know what's wrong with Cheetos?

13:21.000 --> 13:22.320
Is they have those giant Cheetos.

13:22.320 --> 13:28.160
I mean, really, the Chee- the cheese powder to whatever else Cheetos are made out of ratio

13:28.160 --> 13:31.760
is just fucked up by that, I mean.

13:31.760 --> 13:34.440
So Loki, any chance that you would go to gamercon?

13:34.440 --> 13:37.880
Probably not, because I'm not really allowed to travel right now, you know.

13:37.880 --> 13:39.800
So- But what if you told- what if you told the

13:39.800 --> 13:42.080
wife it was a gay gamer convention?

13:42.080 --> 13:43.400
She'd laugh, she would get a kick out of that.

13:43.400 --> 13:47.200
Yeah, she'd probably laugh at that, because- We should- we should try to get a panel, I

13:47.200 --> 13:48.200
would love that.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.520
Would she let you go if we had a panel?

13:50.520 --> 13:51.520
Perhaps, yeah.

13:51.520 --> 13:52.520
I think we should.

13:52.520 --> 13:53.520
Totally get us a panel.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.320
We'll see what we can do, I don't know.

13:55.320 --> 13:57.320
And free tickets.

13:57.320 --> 13:59.600
Alright, moving on.

13:59.600 --> 14:02.380
Let's talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week, and how

14:02.380 --> 14:03.380
was your gaming week?

14:03.380 --> 14:05.120
Dark soccer, you hinted at this a minute ago?

14:05.120 --> 14:07.260
I played the ditter.

14:07.260 --> 14:09.040
My leg- okay, this is what happened.

14:09.040 --> 14:10.040
Alright.

14:10.040 --> 14:12.000
That's dance dance revolution for the uninformed.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Yes.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.920
I, um, was working at this place, and everyone knows I got laid off, but, you know, it was

14:17.920 --> 14:21.640
very, uh, it was an amicable break-up, amicable break-up.

14:21.640 --> 14:26.960
Um, I still got to go to the company picnic, which was at Goffland, on like some corporate

14:26.960 --> 14:27.960
picnic day.

14:27.960 --> 14:32.200
So, yeah, there were still a bunch of annoying teenagers, but it was okay.

14:32.200 --> 14:36.480
Um, but, you got one of those little bracelets that let you get go-karts and a laser tag,

14:36.480 --> 14:41.840
which I didn't do either, um, and get in the water park, which I didn't do either.

14:41.840 --> 14:47.000
Um, but, uh, we just went in and had a good time, but, um, while we were waiting for lunch

14:47.000 --> 14:51.200
to be served, I went inside to go play some DDR, because we also got 20 credits on one

14:51.200 --> 14:52.200
of those little cards.

14:52.200 --> 14:58.320
Um, well, there were already three credits in the DDR, so I'm like, I'll play them all.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.240
It was on four songs.

15:00.240 --> 15:04.480
So I played 12 songs back to back and decided that I'm going to finish out with Superstar,

15:04.480 --> 15:09.080
because I- dammit, I'm not old, I can still do it, although I did fail Cowgirl, which

15:09.080 --> 15:11.400
is very sad, because that used to be, like, one of my best ones.

15:11.400 --> 15:12.400
Bang badoo bang.

15:12.400 --> 15:13.400
I know.

15:13.400 --> 15:16.600
But, and I made it through that, and by the time I got done, I felt like I needed to throw

15:16.600 --> 15:22.680
up, because I was hot, and I hadn't done anything strenuous like that in a while.

15:22.680 --> 15:27.760
And that's the point where you realized, I was in my DDR Prime 10 years ago.

15:27.760 --> 15:33.200
When I weighed 30 pounds more than I do now, which is sad.

15:33.200 --> 15:38.120
So anyway, I was- I went and had a good time at lunch, and I felt better once I ate something,

15:38.120 --> 15:43.440
and, you know, had a good time, and my BFF Forever's Becky was there with the boy and

15:43.440 --> 15:44.440
her hubby.

15:44.440 --> 15:45.440
Hi, they're listening.

15:45.440 --> 15:46.440
Hi, Ro.

15:46.440 --> 15:47.440
Hi, Ro.

15:47.440 --> 15:51.920
And it was, you know, we had a really good time, and Dan and I played copious amounts

15:51.920 --> 15:54.920
of Tank Tank Tank, and there's this other game, too, that I-

15:54.920 --> 15:57.200
Are you guys going to pick that up on Wii U?

15:57.200 --> 15:58.200
Is it coming out?

15:58.200 --> 15:59.200
Yeah, Tank Tank Tank's going to be one of the launch games for Wii U.

15:59.200 --> 16:02.640
I don't know that we're getting a Wii U, but I fucking want that game, so maybe we will.

16:02.640 --> 16:05.120
Okay, I'm trying to find the name of this game.

16:05.120 --> 16:11.640
Okay, it's a Sega game called Let's Go Island, Lost on the Island of Tropics, and it's a

16:11.640 --> 16:15.760
shooter game where you're on a- Oh, I saw that, yeah.

16:15.760 --> 16:20.020
Yeah, where you're on a boat, and it's one of those quirky little Sega games, of course

16:20.020 --> 16:27.600
I loved it immediately, and you play as this girl and the tour guide, and all of a sudden

16:27.600 --> 16:30.880
terrorists are on your boat, and they're shooting sharks and everything, and then they get eaten

16:30.880 --> 16:33.520
by the sharks, and then you're underwater being drug along by the-

16:33.520 --> 16:35.760
You're on a boat, and you're fighting terrorists and sharks?

16:35.760 --> 16:37.320
This game has everything.

16:37.320 --> 16:38.320
It's great.

16:38.320 --> 16:44.040
When you finish each, the boss of the first level is this huge manga squid, and you also

16:44.040 --> 16:47.160
have to jerk your controller in a certain way to get past these little cut scenes.

16:47.160 --> 16:49.940
It's pretty cute, but-

16:49.940 --> 16:55.640
That sounds all sorts of like, how was that game called?

16:55.640 --> 16:58.800
Yeah, well, I totally interrupted that.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.360
It's one of their gun shooting games that was really awesome that I loved that was on

17:01.360 --> 17:03.120
the Wii, and also in the arcade.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.120
Freaking Sega, of course.

17:05.120 --> 17:13.600
Anyway, so when you finish the level, though, it does a compatibility meter to see how compatible

17:13.600 --> 17:20.200
you are, and Dan and I were 60%, but it's also funny when you shoot the same things,

17:20.200 --> 17:24.640
it gives you this twin bonus, and you get little hearts and everything flowing out of

17:24.640 --> 17:29.360
it, but I died at the second stage, and so Dan continued, and he made it a little bit

17:29.360 --> 17:36.640
further, and then when you get less than 10% compatibility, it says you wouldn't sit next

17:36.640 --> 17:37.640
to him on the bus.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.520
I was like, wow, that's kind of cold.

17:39.520 --> 17:45.320
And then I played more DDR, and Dan played with me, and he's like, I forgot how to play.

17:45.320 --> 17:46.960
I never, ever saw Dan play DDR.

17:46.960 --> 17:48.720
Dan used to play my Dreamcast one with me.

17:48.720 --> 17:49.720
Fun.

17:49.720 --> 17:52.720
He could, the hardest he could do was Dynamite Rave.

17:52.720 --> 17:55.240
Dan was one of those guys who didn't want to admit he played DDR.

17:55.240 --> 18:00.480
But the hardest thing that he could do was Dynamite Rave Easy.

18:00.480 --> 18:04.640
So I picked that as the last one, because he wanted to play all the old stuff, except

18:04.640 --> 18:07.000
for Burning Heat, which, you know, Gradius.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.920
So we played all the fun stuff, and I kept him alive, and it was just really, we had

18:11.920 --> 18:17.400
a good time, but by the time I got out of the car after we got home, my legs had started

18:17.400 --> 18:18.400
to cramp up.

18:18.400 --> 18:21.400
I was like, wow, how much jumping and running was I doing?

18:21.400 --> 18:23.440
So I was like, I'm out of practice.

18:23.440 --> 18:26.060
So we actually discussed this.

18:26.060 --> 18:30.640
We're going to hook back up our JPS2 and start playing our DDR games again, because I've

18:30.640 --> 18:36.280
got those dance pads that I got at the thrift store that were like three for six bucks,

18:36.280 --> 18:37.840
and like one of them didn't work.

18:37.840 --> 18:39.100
The other two did.

18:39.100 --> 18:41.840
So we're going to start playing DDR getting home.

18:41.840 --> 18:42.840
Good luck.

18:42.840 --> 18:43.840
Thanks.

18:43.840 --> 18:44.840
It's all part of the plan.

18:44.840 --> 18:49.140
Now, I got to say, when I went to Golf Land a couple weeks ago, I was, I was depressed.

18:49.140 --> 18:53.620
Everything was, everything was broken, too many people, hot, gross, not fun.

18:53.620 --> 18:55.400
It was clean, shiny, and extra air conditioned.

18:55.400 --> 18:58.440
The only thing I got a kick out of was the gigantic Tetris game.

18:58.440 --> 18:59.440
I love that.

18:59.440 --> 19:02.360
You can play the giant balls.

19:02.360 --> 19:09.840
I also played more games, more games, because I'm still playing through Mass Effect 2 for

19:09.840 --> 19:17.320
Becky with a Para Themshep and Garrus, totally Garrus.

19:17.320 --> 19:21.760
I'm still playing through Mass Effect 3, which I'm still at the same part that I am, and

19:21.760 --> 19:24.880
every time I load it up, I just get depressed and turn it back off, and I want to play more

19:24.880 --> 19:25.880
multiplayer next week.

19:25.880 --> 19:26.880
Does it involve Mordin?

19:26.880 --> 19:27.880
No.

19:27.880 --> 19:28.880
Oh, okay.

19:28.880 --> 19:30.880
No, um, um, um, I already passed that.

19:30.880 --> 19:31.880
I'm on Thessia.

19:31.880 --> 19:32.880
Oh, okay.

19:32.880 --> 19:33.880
Oh yeah.

19:33.880 --> 19:34.880
That part.

19:34.880 --> 19:35.880
But this time I'm taking Javok with me and not Garrus.

19:35.880 --> 19:39.960
Garrus gets to stay home and not be depressed.

19:39.960 --> 19:41.200
How considerate of you.

19:41.200 --> 19:46.720
I'm very, very considerate of Turians and their sensitive natures.

19:46.720 --> 19:50.280
Um, I have my fourth 85 in WoW.

19:50.280 --> 19:51.280
Addict.

19:51.280 --> 19:52.280
Dealer.

19:52.280 --> 19:53.280
How many do you have?

19:53.280 --> 19:54.920
I got my fifth this week.

19:54.920 --> 19:57.040
Well, I got my four in last time.

19:57.040 --> 19:59.480
I now have two druids at 85.

19:59.480 --> 20:06.760
I'm on my way to my second druid, but so now that means I have, uh, in order, Arissa, the

20:06.760 --> 20:13.220
mage, Rebecca Black, the paladin, Garrus, the shadow priest, and Sakurina.

20:13.220 --> 20:19.840
So next in line is probably going to be, um, uh, the troll, a city vampire in our chat

20:19.840 --> 20:21.720
room reminds us Leviathan is coming.

20:21.720 --> 20:22.720
The DLC for mass.

20:22.720 --> 20:25.520
I know someone's excited.

20:25.520 --> 20:26.520
Yeah.

20:26.520 --> 20:27.520
Yeah.

20:27.520 --> 20:28.520
I can't wait to check it out.

20:28.520 --> 20:31.720
It's just, why does this all have to hit the same day?

20:31.720 --> 20:36.280
Leviathan Guild Wars two and the big wow patch all hit the same day.

20:36.280 --> 20:38.040
I think that probably 10 bucks.

20:38.040 --> 20:41.040
I think the Vita patch is that day too.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.040
I don't know.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.040
We have a story on it later.

20:43.040 --> 20:45.520
I'm not playing Guild Wars.

20:45.520 --> 20:48.560
I want to check it out, but I, at least there's no monthly fee.

20:48.560 --> 20:50.960
I know Guild Wars and one of those things I can kind of look at anytime.

20:50.960 --> 20:51.960
Yeah.

20:51.960 --> 20:57.000
But I mean, I've still got a, I'm probably, to be honest, not going to get, um, the well

20:57.000 --> 21:02.240
thing right away, except, um, if I ever get paid for one of my projects, maybe I'll buy

21:02.240 --> 21:05.760
it, you know, as a treat to myself.

21:05.760 --> 21:09.880
It's just like while I still got other, other tunes to work on, like what's the point, you

21:09.880 --> 21:10.880
know?

21:10.880 --> 21:11.880
Yeah.

21:11.880 --> 21:15.000
The thing that I'm excited about for a while is that I know this isn't courthouse, but

21:15.000 --> 21:20.600
I'm excited that, um, all of the races are going to be available, like from the get go

21:20.600 --> 21:21.600
for everybody.

21:21.600 --> 21:22.600
Yeah.

21:22.600 --> 21:23.600
That was, uh, yeah.

21:23.600 --> 21:24.600
And that's not in our news role tonight.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.820
Cause I was going to save that for courthouse, which is fine.

21:26.820 --> 21:33.520
But yeah, the, the big news about, uh, anybody can play any race except don't expect to play

21:33.520 --> 21:35.520
a Panda next Tuesday.

21:35.520 --> 21:37.560
Pandas will unlock with Pandaria.

21:37.560 --> 21:42.480
However, you don't have to have Mr. Pandaria to roll a Panda, but you will need to go past

21:42.480 --> 21:43.480
level 85.

21:43.480 --> 21:44.480
Yeah.

21:44.480 --> 21:50.560
So, but I mean, it's still, I'm probably, cause I mean, I did temp work.

21:50.560 --> 21:55.440
I have enough to buy the game and I'm sure I'll probably get it cause I'm still paying

21:55.440 --> 21:59.760
for the shit till March, uh, tiger claw in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says

21:59.760 --> 22:02.520
speaking of wow, I saw that Mr. Pandaria trailer.

22:02.520 --> 22:06.240
The first thing that came on my mind after watching it, a bad-ass version of Kung Fu

22:06.240 --> 22:07.240
Panda.

22:07.240 --> 22:10.840
The trailer was released this week out of games com, the new world of Warcraft trailer.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.280
It looked great.

22:12.280 --> 22:16.340
The, the CGI was beautiful and you know, with all this talk about a world of Warcraft movie

22:16.340 --> 22:20.760
and all this, it's like, just do that for 90 minutes would be great.

22:20.760 --> 22:24.600
Although I have to say overall, I was a little disappointed in the trailer.

22:24.600 --> 22:30.120
The reason why is that I would hope that the cinematic trailer for it would show like a

22:30.120 --> 22:31.680
little bit of everything.

22:31.680 --> 22:36.160
And there's so much beauty in this expansion in the realm of Pandaria and some of these

22:36.160 --> 22:37.160
new five mans.

22:37.160 --> 22:38.600
They don't really show any of that.

22:38.600 --> 22:42.020
Like I wanted to see a rendered version of the temple, the Jade serpent and some of that

22:42.020 --> 22:43.020
gorgeous stuff.

22:43.020 --> 22:47.880
Well, I've just been looking at, um, at, uh, data dumps.

22:47.880 --> 22:53.260
So for some of the, the internal stuff, you know, basically people just doing run throughs

22:53.260 --> 22:55.940
of the empty temples and the dungeons and everything.

22:55.940 --> 22:56.940
So this looks pretty neat.

22:56.940 --> 22:57.940
Nice.

22:57.940 --> 22:58.940
All right.

22:58.940 --> 23:00.680
Before we turn into an episode of Horde House, let's let you finish up.

23:00.680 --> 23:01.680
We'll move on to Loki.

23:01.680 --> 23:05.640
Well, um, I'm also very pissed off at all the people nudging me on words with friends

23:05.640 --> 23:07.240
and I'm about ready to delete it.

23:07.240 --> 23:08.240
Yeah.

23:08.240 --> 23:09.240
I'm getting that with song pop.

23:09.240 --> 23:10.240
I'm kind of over song pop now.

23:10.240 --> 23:13.720
Like it was fun for two weeks, but now, now I've moved on to another game.

23:13.720 --> 23:17.360
I, and I can't help it and I'm glad I didn't pay for the game and I'm not paying for any

23:17.360 --> 23:21.160
of it, but I still like draw something.

23:21.160 --> 23:24.160
And the only reason I'm still playing is because I haven't paid for it and I'm not looking

23:24.160 --> 23:25.160
at any ads.

23:25.160 --> 23:27.380
So I'm all cool.

23:27.380 --> 23:30.240
I have drawn some perverted shit in that game.

23:30.240 --> 23:31.800
All right.

23:31.800 --> 23:32.800
Loki.

23:32.800 --> 23:34.640
Um, let's see.

23:34.640 --> 23:42.240
I played Call of Duty, modern warfare three, a little bit of that and Minecraft, a whole

23:42.240 --> 23:46.000
lot of Minecraft, um, getting bored with it again.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.080
It's just like, I think the problem is I don't have a lot of people to play with and that's

23:50.080 --> 23:53.920
really odd considering there's like so many people that bought the game, but, um, none

23:53.920 --> 23:58.560
of my friends seem to be playing games that, you know, we can join in or whatever.

23:58.560 --> 24:02.440
So I'm playing with my coworker and we're just like the map that we're on, we've kind

24:02.440 --> 24:03.440
of explored everything.

24:03.440 --> 24:05.500
I got to the point where I'm like, okay, fuck it.

24:05.500 --> 24:09.360
I'm going to go ahead and start duping again because there's still a way you can do stuff.

24:09.360 --> 24:14.840
So I duped a bunch of dynamite and just create a hole and I was like, wow, create a crater

24:14.840 --> 24:15.840
board still.

24:15.840 --> 24:18.840
It's like, may I interject one thing?

24:18.840 --> 24:19.840
Yeah.

24:19.840 --> 24:22.000
I saw one thing that made me love Minecraft.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.200
It was this video that someone did and lined up explosives, everything that says I love

24:26.200 --> 24:32.000
and when it exploded it said, but that's so mature.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.360
I love it.

24:33.360 --> 24:34.360
I love that.

24:34.360 --> 24:37.440
That might be cause you know, dark soccer, if you've been listening to previous episodes,

24:37.440 --> 24:41.000
she's not very, she kind of frowns on Minecraft, but I love that.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.720
I love, butts may have cracked the door open a little bit to dark soccer getting on the

24:45.720 --> 24:46.720
right crap.

24:46.720 --> 24:47.720
It cracked the door.

24:47.720 --> 24:55.680
I'm not saying it made me like the game, but it made me laugh like my ass off, like and

24:55.680 --> 25:00.200
that and seeing people making giant pigs and like goombas and Mario and shit.

25:00.200 --> 25:01.200
That was pretty funny.

25:01.200 --> 25:04.760
You do realize I have a giant pig in my map that I have made.

25:04.760 --> 25:07.680
I was talking about your giant pig.

25:07.680 --> 25:12.600
Anyways, moving on.

25:12.600 --> 25:16.120
I did happen to see like, for example, like something that was more structured to be kind

25:16.120 --> 25:21.640
of fun, like with other people, I watched a kind of a, one of those, we play things

25:21.640 --> 25:26.360
it was with the, machinima, I think they do that.

25:26.360 --> 25:32.600
And it was a bunch of people playing, it's like a, like a survival type game where they

25:32.600 --> 25:34.920
had to go out the store and survive.

25:34.920 --> 25:39.920
They had three torches, a wooden sword, and a couple pork chops.

25:39.920 --> 25:44.960
And just like, okay, last man standing, whoever gets back, you know, the last person to live

25:44.960 --> 25:47.680
has to get back to the, you know, the safe house.

25:47.680 --> 25:51.500
And then, you know, we'll score a point and it's the first person in the seven.

25:51.500 --> 25:53.040
And that was really hilarious.

25:53.040 --> 25:54.600
Like the Minecraft hunger games.

25:54.600 --> 25:55.600
Certainly.

25:55.600 --> 25:56.600
They have that.

25:56.600 --> 25:57.600
They have that too.

25:57.600 --> 25:59.720
But this is like, it was sort of like that.

25:59.720 --> 26:00.720
But that looked like fun.

26:00.720 --> 26:04.880
See, more of the structured stuff with like a lot of people, sounds like a lot of fun

26:04.880 --> 26:05.880
with Minecraft.

26:05.880 --> 26:10.160
In fact, when we first started playing, when it was like you, me and Bobby and then like

26:10.160 --> 26:12.980
other people joining in, that was fun.

26:12.980 --> 26:18.680
But now when it's just like myself and no one comes in, you know, to these worlds and

26:18.680 --> 26:20.960
stuff, it just gets pretty boring.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.240
I don't know.

26:22.240 --> 26:25.780
I think that's why I kind of turned away from Minecraft in the first time.

26:25.780 --> 26:29.560
I kind of checked it out.

26:29.560 --> 26:36.440
Ironically though, I did also check out another Minecraft-esque game because it was cheap

26:36.440 --> 26:39.740
and it was featured in an article I read.

26:39.740 --> 26:42.200
It was Castle Builder Z.

26:42.200 --> 26:46.040
And Castle Builder Z is on the Xbox Live Indie Games.

26:46.040 --> 26:48.280
It is only a dollar.

26:48.280 --> 26:50.080
Eighty Microsoft points.

26:50.080 --> 26:54.300
So worth checking out for that kind of amount of money.

26:54.300 --> 27:00.400
It's like Minecraft with your avatars, with really crappy looking graphics, I mean even

27:00.400 --> 27:02.000
like crappier than...

27:02.000 --> 27:06.440
I was like, Minecraft isn't exactly known for its, you know, graphical finesse.

27:06.440 --> 27:08.600
It's like, you know, they made their own textures.

27:08.600 --> 27:12.120
It looks like a bad texture pack on Minecraft.

27:12.120 --> 27:16.960
But you have guns and you can craft weapons and stuff like that.

27:16.960 --> 27:19.080
And it's zombies.

27:19.080 --> 27:21.840
Would guns make you more interested in Minecraft?

27:21.840 --> 27:23.600
Maybe.

27:23.600 --> 27:24.600
And there's zombies.

27:24.600 --> 27:28.500
Yeah, I understand there's zombies normally in Minecraft, but these aren't the zombies

27:28.500 --> 27:30.160
that are in the regular Minecraft.

27:30.160 --> 27:34.360
These are like, I'm gonna run at you at full speed and jump in the air and try to kill

27:34.360 --> 27:37.680
you zombies.

27:37.680 --> 27:40.320
And there's a dragon that tries to kill you as well.

27:40.320 --> 27:44.880
It pretty much the whole game is like, very, very...

27:44.880 --> 27:45.880
It's not...

27:45.880 --> 27:46.880
I don't know.

27:46.880 --> 27:47.880
It's kinda scary.

27:47.880 --> 27:52.640
The sound that they have in there kinda sounds like one of those Halloween tapes or CDs and

27:52.640 --> 27:55.320
stuff with all the Halloween spooky sounds.

27:55.320 --> 27:56.320
But that's pretty much it.

27:56.320 --> 28:04.240
And it's just like, I ended up barricading myself into a cave or something because the

28:04.240 --> 28:09.880
first time out I was like, okay crap, you know, this looks like night all the time.

28:09.880 --> 28:14.880
I mean, when it's daytime it's gloomy and lightning outside and when it's nighttime

28:14.880 --> 28:18.800
it's dark but there's tons of shit running at you.

28:18.800 --> 28:23.400
And so the first time I made the mistake of, oh, I forgot to get wood.

28:23.400 --> 28:24.400
Crap.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.200
You know, so I'm like waiting in there.

28:26.200 --> 28:30.120
I'm like, okay, I better go outside and go try to punch a tree real quick and get some

28:30.120 --> 28:31.120
wood.

28:31.120 --> 28:32.120
Go punch a tree.

28:32.120 --> 28:33.120
Only in Minecraft.

28:33.120 --> 28:36.960
So I did that and then all of a sudden I get bum-rushed by a bunch of fucking zombies.

28:36.960 --> 28:40.860
Or like, I don't even know, they were just something that was snarling and sounding like

28:40.860 --> 28:45.280
a tiger or something but it looked like some sort of monster thing that ran at me.

28:45.280 --> 28:48.960
And so I started firing a pistol at it and I didn't really do anything because I got

28:48.960 --> 28:51.640
rushed from a few other sides at the same time.

28:51.640 --> 28:55.000
And then it's like, okay, that was plain non-normal.

28:55.000 --> 28:59.220
And then when you respawn it kind of respawned me close to where I was and immediately all

28:59.220 --> 29:03.000
those mobsters, all the monsters that were right there just like crushed at me and I

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
died again.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.480
I was like, crap, okay, so I got to do this differently.

29:07.480 --> 29:11.280
Anyways, so I finally got it to where I'm like in a cave now and I've mined some stuff

29:11.280 --> 29:15.800
and you start building weapons because you don't really have a whole lot you can build

29:15.800 --> 29:20.440
in it because it is kind of a knockoff of Minecraft but you don't have like beds, you

29:20.440 --> 29:22.160
can't sleep or anything.

29:22.160 --> 29:25.760
And then there's, it always sounds like there's monsters trying to dig their way into your

29:25.760 --> 29:30.400
tunnel and sometimes they somehow manage to get in there and I think on higher difficulties

29:30.400 --> 29:33.320
they can dig through the tunnel and get to you.

29:33.320 --> 29:34.320
Yeah.

29:34.320 --> 29:36.440
Yeah, it's like, it's fucking creepy.

29:36.440 --> 29:41.880
And they're like really silent too until they get up, like I was digging into the wall and

29:41.880 --> 29:45.380
all of a sudden, like I noticed my screen turned red and there's a fucking skeleton

29:45.380 --> 29:46.380
behind me.

29:46.380 --> 29:49.400
It's just like, it's loud everywhere else but then I would have cried and throw out

29:49.400 --> 29:50.980
the controller.

29:50.980 --> 29:53.960
It's pretty, I think it'd be kind of interesting to check it out.

29:53.960 --> 29:58.560
But yeah, 80 Microsoft points, I mean, it's a buck, come on and just try it.

29:58.560 --> 30:02.760
If you want to try it, you know, if you play Minecraft, it's kind of fun, you know, you'll

30:02.760 --> 30:04.880
get a dollar's worth of entertainment out of it.

30:04.880 --> 30:07.900
And in general, don't forget about indie games.

30:07.900 --> 30:09.160
Don't forget about Xbox indie game.

30:09.160 --> 30:10.560
There's a lot of fun stuff on there.

30:10.560 --> 30:11.560
It's not bad.

30:11.560 --> 30:15.000
I mean, Castle Miner was one of those series, it was one of like two or three series that

30:15.000 --> 30:20.880
were on indie games that were kind of mimicking Minecraft for a long time before Minecraft

30:20.880 --> 30:23.520
came out and they still do and they still sell all right.

30:23.520 --> 30:31.220
But they're fun in their own right and it's four player co-op and you can play, you know,

30:31.220 --> 30:32.320
online and stuff like that.

30:32.320 --> 30:36.640
So it's worth it for like, I mean, come on, you probably have 80 Microsoft points sitting

30:36.640 --> 30:40.600
in your account that's just leftover from rock band purchases or something like that.

30:40.600 --> 30:41.760
So definitely worth checking out.

30:41.760 --> 30:44.860
I mean, there's tons of indie games on there that we're checking out, but that it was kind

30:44.860 --> 30:45.860
of fun.

30:45.860 --> 30:46.860
All right.

30:46.860 --> 30:49.600
Well, if you're done with your gaming week, I'll do mine real quick.

30:49.600 --> 30:50.720
Not a lot of new stuff this week.

30:50.720 --> 30:54.800
A lot of the stuff from last week, like sound shapes and World of Warcraft and so forth.

30:54.800 --> 30:56.960
But I did play two new games.

30:56.960 --> 30:58.280
One of them's a little herpy derpy.

30:58.280 --> 30:59.640
I'll talk about this real quick.

30:59.640 --> 31:00.640
It's an iOS game.

31:00.640 --> 31:02.480
I've been playing it mostly on my iPad.

31:02.480 --> 31:07.460
It's called Puzzle Craft, which might make you think it's Minecraft, but like puzzle,

31:07.460 --> 31:08.460
but it's not.

31:08.460 --> 31:09.720
It's actually nothing like that.

31:09.720 --> 31:12.240
It's one of those free to, well, no, it's not even free to play.

31:12.240 --> 31:13.340
It's 99 cents.

31:13.340 --> 31:17.600
But then of course they charge you for all these upgrades in the game, like extra coins

31:17.600 --> 31:18.600
and stuff.

31:18.600 --> 31:20.280
You don't really have to do it.

31:20.280 --> 31:25.360
The crux of the game is that you're building this town and you get all the materials to

31:25.360 --> 31:32.920
either get food or get materials to build things in your town in this whole little match

31:32.920 --> 31:36.880
game where you, like they call it match three in the description, but it's not bejeweled

31:36.880 --> 31:37.880
at all.

31:37.880 --> 31:42.940
It's like trace the consecutive line of like all the little pieces of grain in the puzzle.

31:42.940 --> 31:47.120
Like try to trace it and then they all disappear and new stuff falls and kind of goes like

31:47.120 --> 31:48.120
that over and over.

31:48.120 --> 31:52.200
And it's one of those things that's just like so stupid that I'm playing this, but it's

31:52.200 --> 31:53.200
addicting.

31:53.200 --> 31:56.520
It's just cute and you have this little town of villagers and some of them wear chicken

31:56.520 --> 31:57.520
outfits.

31:57.520 --> 31:58.520
It's really cute.

31:58.520 --> 31:59.520
So whatever.

31:59.520 --> 32:00.520
There's that.

32:00.520 --> 32:03.640
The other game I've been playing a little bit, just a little bit because it just came

32:03.640 --> 32:07.880
out today is New Super Mario Brothers 2 on the 3DS.

32:07.880 --> 32:09.800
I did pick that up today.

32:09.800 --> 32:12.800
It just came out today, so I haven't had a lot of time to play it, so I can't give it

32:12.800 --> 32:13.800
a full review.

32:13.800 --> 32:17.040
I'll post something more in depth on vognetwork.com later this week.

32:17.040 --> 32:18.040
Plug plug.

32:18.040 --> 32:22.160
But how similar is it to New Super Mario Brothers?

32:22.160 --> 32:26.800
It's pretty much the same damn game, but is that such a bad thing?

32:26.800 --> 32:32.200
Well no, but at the same time it kind of feels a little bit like they didn't put a lot of

32:32.200 --> 32:35.080
effort into it if it's pretty similar.

32:35.080 --> 32:37.160
Well I mean there are some new stuff.

32:37.160 --> 32:42.080
I mean especially with this I kind of think the whole like Mario's after coins.

32:42.080 --> 32:45.920
I think it's it's a little bit corny, but some of the power-ups are neat.

32:45.920 --> 32:48.600
Like I love the one that turns you into giant, although I guess that was in the previous

32:48.600 --> 32:51.640
games too, but I was like ooh giant Mario.

32:51.640 --> 32:55.920
And then you know the ones that have the gold coins where you can kick and it leaves like

32:55.920 --> 33:00.960
a trail of coins and the fireball that makes all the blocks turn into coins.

33:00.960 --> 33:02.600
It was kind of neat.

33:02.600 --> 33:06.600
Really where the game shines, as it usually does, is level design.

33:06.600 --> 33:11.120
I've played a lot of really well designed levels.

33:11.120 --> 33:16.600
Halfway into world one you can, if you find it in the fortress, there's a, I'll give you

33:16.600 --> 33:17.600
a hint.

33:17.600 --> 33:22.000
You don't want a spoiler, mute your thing for 30 seconds, but here's a hint.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.440
In the very first fortress there's a room that you go in with these green blocks that

33:26.440 --> 33:27.720
spin around.

33:27.720 --> 33:30.680
Look for an exit in that room that's not the main exit.

33:30.680 --> 33:31.840
I'll give you that hint.

33:31.840 --> 33:36.440
And you'll find yourself in the world mushroom world or whatever, which is kind of like I

33:36.440 --> 33:38.200
guess like the secret world.

33:38.200 --> 33:42.360
And the stages get a little harder, but like one of them was like really neat design because

33:42.360 --> 33:48.080
the way the blocks were, you had to figure out like how you could fall through the blocks

33:48.080 --> 33:50.160
to get all the coins.

33:50.160 --> 33:53.240
It's kind of hard for me to explain without like showing you a visual, but just like the

33:53.240 --> 33:58.240
way the blocks were, it looked like one solid block, but it's got all these lines in it.

33:58.240 --> 34:00.600
So you had to, I don't know.

34:00.600 --> 34:02.880
3D doesn't really add anything to the game, but that's okay.

34:02.880 --> 34:06.680
I'm totally okay with 3DS games not whoring the crap out of 3D.

34:06.680 --> 34:12.000
If you want the 3D stuff, go play Mario 3D Land, which you know did it very well.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.880
But yeah, I liked it so far.

34:15.880 --> 34:21.400
You know, I'll probably play it to completion and it's got some interesting street pass

34:21.400 --> 34:26.760
things where you can play a sequence of three random stages and try to get as many coins

34:26.760 --> 34:27.920
as possible.

34:27.920 --> 34:31.520
And then you street pass to somebody else and you get their records, so you can try

34:31.520 --> 34:35.240
to play the same three stages they did, even though it was randomized.

34:35.240 --> 34:39.200
So it's kind of like, I don't know, kind of has that Mario Kart-esque competitive element,

34:39.200 --> 34:41.960
which wasn't in any other Mario game so far.

34:41.960 --> 34:42.960
So that is something new.

34:42.960 --> 34:43.960
I'll give it that.

34:43.960 --> 34:45.600
Kind of a little different.

34:45.600 --> 34:47.200
I will get into this in the show a little later.

34:47.200 --> 34:52.060
They're promising the DLC will be worth it, essentially.

34:52.060 --> 34:56.360
So I'm curious about that, because again, level design is where these games tend to

34:56.360 --> 34:57.360
shine.

34:57.360 --> 35:02.280
Well, this is all they really need to do since the engine was done a few times.

35:02.280 --> 35:03.280
Yeah.

35:03.280 --> 35:05.260
I mean, I'll be honest in that regard.

35:05.260 --> 35:09.820
If I'm going to razz the game, it's that it's really the first Mario game I've played in

35:09.820 --> 35:15.640
a long time where I go, this really isn't original, which I know is weird because Mario

35:15.640 --> 35:17.600
games are essentially all the same mechanic.

35:17.600 --> 35:18.600
But think about it.

35:18.600 --> 35:20.880
You know, in the original Super Mario Bros. and then there's Mario Brothers 2.

35:20.880 --> 35:22.680
It's like, holy shit, this is totally different.

35:22.680 --> 35:25.760
And then Mario Brothers 3 kind of went back more towards the first one.

35:25.760 --> 35:28.400
But you know, Mario, if it ain't fixed, don't break it.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.440
Mario World was like completely modes.

35:30.440 --> 35:31.440
Yeah.

35:31.440 --> 35:32.440
Yoshi and all this.

35:32.440 --> 35:33.440
Then Mario 64.

35:33.440 --> 35:34.440
Oh my God.

35:34.440 --> 35:35.440
3D.

35:35.440 --> 35:36.440
Mario Galaxy.

35:36.440 --> 35:37.440
Oh my God.

35:37.440 --> 35:38.440
The planets and everything is just different.

35:38.440 --> 35:40.760
It's like the first one in a long time I've played where I'm like, yeah, okay.

35:40.760 --> 35:45.320
It's pretty much the same thing as the last game with some coin grabbing elements.

35:45.320 --> 35:47.720
That's the one bad thing I could really say about it.

35:47.720 --> 35:49.280
Otherwise it's a Mario game.

35:49.280 --> 35:53.260
Like what Super Mario Brothers game has been bad.

35:53.260 --> 35:54.680
I'm not talking about spinoff game.

35:54.680 --> 35:58.100
I'm not talking about like Mario is missing and all these like spinoff games.

35:58.100 --> 36:01.560
What core Mario Brothers game has been bad?

36:01.560 --> 36:02.560
Just straight up bad.

36:02.560 --> 36:05.480
I don't even think Mario Sunshine you could say was a bad game.

36:05.480 --> 36:07.480
I still think Mario Sunshine was great.

36:07.480 --> 36:08.480
Mario Sunshine.

36:08.480 --> 36:14.480
I mean, yes, it's a formula, but it's a solid fucking formula.

36:14.480 --> 36:16.440
Go with it.

36:16.440 --> 36:17.440
There you go.

36:17.440 --> 36:22.440
I should go to the chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

36:22.440 --> 36:23.440
Let's see.

36:23.440 --> 36:26.480
Shayna Linko's in chat saying, I'm at a bit over 30K coins so far.

36:26.480 --> 36:28.000
It gives me incentive to keep playing.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.960
Yeah, the back of the box says something about getting a million coins and I guess you get

36:31.960 --> 36:32.960
something special.

36:32.960 --> 36:33.960
I don't know.

36:33.960 --> 36:37.040
It's probably just all the levels backwards or something.

36:37.040 --> 36:39.320
StartUpG says the raccoon power up is back.

36:39.320 --> 36:40.460
That is true.

36:40.460 --> 36:45.780
It's not Tanooki Mario anymore like it was in the Wii one or the last, no, the Mario

36:45.780 --> 36:46.780
3D Land at the doogie.

36:46.780 --> 36:50.940
It's just straight up raccoon Mario, just like you remember it in Mario three.

36:50.940 --> 36:55.800
In fact, there's a lot here that's just like you remember it in Mario three.

36:55.800 --> 36:57.880
Like you go to world two.

36:57.880 --> 36:59.040
It's a desert world.

36:59.040 --> 37:00.040
What a shock.

37:00.040 --> 37:02.800
It's kind of a lot of the same formula.

37:02.800 --> 37:07.560
Well it is the third new Super Mario Brothers game, so maybe it's new Super Mario Brothers.

37:07.560 --> 37:08.560
Maybe it's not that new.

37:08.560 --> 37:12.240
They should just call it well polished Mario Brothers.

37:12.240 --> 37:16.360
Isn't that a little something, you know, it's like really you couldn't have come up with

37:16.360 --> 37:22.100
a better name for the series other than, yeah, it's a new Super Mario Brothers game.

37:22.100 --> 37:23.600
Interesting point from Dark Tetsuya.

37:23.600 --> 37:28.800
Ironically, Mario two's original version, meaning the Japanese version, lost levels

37:28.800 --> 37:30.080
here, right?

37:30.080 --> 37:32.560
Wasn't too different from Super Mario Brothers one.

37:32.560 --> 37:36.720
Just the level layouts and some of the little things they added cranked up the difficulty.

37:36.720 --> 37:38.080
That's a great comparison.

37:38.080 --> 37:43.400
You know, lost levels or Mario two in Japan really wasn't that different from Mario one.

37:43.400 --> 37:46.640
Different graphics, a little different mechanic with Luigi's jumping.

37:46.640 --> 37:50.600
Well, and Mario two that we got wasn't even a Mario game originally.

37:50.600 --> 37:51.600
Right.

37:51.600 --> 37:52.600
But I'm not talking about that.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.840
I'm not talking about the whole, that whole thing I'm talking about.

37:54.840 --> 37:55.840
Yeah.

37:55.840 --> 37:57.560
Where they say, Oh, how innovative, how different.

37:57.560 --> 37:58.840
It wasn't even a Mario game.

37:58.840 --> 37:59.840
True, true.

37:59.840 --> 38:03.640
But I mean, go back to the loss levels or Japanese two and one.

38:03.640 --> 38:06.380
That's a very, I mean, I don't think loss levels is a bad game.

38:06.380 --> 38:09.320
It's a really, it's a challenging asshole game.

38:09.320 --> 38:10.580
It is.

38:10.580 --> 38:13.400
And there's some asshole stages in this that I've played so far when you get into those

38:13.400 --> 38:14.400
special worlds.

38:14.400 --> 38:17.120
So let's see.

38:17.120 --> 38:24.060
Tiger claw says the next version would be new, new Super Mario Brothers.

38:24.060 --> 38:27.320
Very new Mario Brothers 2015.

38:27.320 --> 38:32.480
Well, you know, what's funny here could be a band themed one because new Super Mario

38:32.480 --> 38:34.720
Brothers, you too, you know, Oh yeah.

38:34.720 --> 38:35.720
What up?

38:35.720 --> 38:36.720
G reminds us.

38:36.720 --> 38:37.720
Mario two had the poison mushrooms.

38:37.720 --> 38:38.720
That was a little different too.

38:38.720 --> 38:39.720
Okay.

38:39.720 --> 38:42.840
But here's, here's the one tiny concern I have.

38:42.840 --> 38:46.920
If I'm already looking at this game going, all right, it's cool, but it's not very, it's

38:46.920 --> 38:47.920
not that original.

38:47.920 --> 38:52.340
It's not as original as Nintendo wants you to think it is, but what's going to happen

38:52.340 --> 38:57.020
when that Wii U Mario game comes out because these games are not coming out with a lot

38:57.020 --> 38:58.680
of time apart between them.

38:58.680 --> 39:01.720
What's that Wii U Mario going to bring to the table?

39:01.720 --> 39:03.960
Isn't that going to be the same damn thing again?

39:03.960 --> 39:04.960
It's the same thing.

39:04.960 --> 39:09.200
But now with the gimmick that, Hey, look, a fifth person, because I don't know about

39:09.200 --> 39:12.640
you, but I always have about five people in my living room wanting to play the Wii.

39:12.640 --> 39:14.800
Oh wait, no one wants to play the Wii.

39:14.800 --> 39:15.800
Okay.

39:15.800 --> 39:20.280
So five people supposedly in this room playing the Wii U and one person is gonna be like,

39:20.280 --> 39:21.880
Hey, I'm moving the platforms.

39:21.880 --> 39:26.080
Look, I'm, I'm, I'm like, you know, I'm contributing.

39:26.080 --> 39:28.920
It's like almost like that dumb person that you have in your room.

39:28.920 --> 39:30.800
Well, it's like, you know what?

39:30.800 --> 39:32.940
Billy's not going to play the game because he's too stupid.

39:32.940 --> 39:34.000
He's going to keep dying.

39:34.000 --> 39:39.480
So we're going to let him move the platforms up and down because that's all he can handle.

39:39.480 --> 39:42.000
So five people to play this to its full potential.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
Yes.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.720
This game is going to sell like crazy in Utah.

39:44.720 --> 39:46.640
Go figure.

39:46.640 --> 39:53.900
So it's just, I, if someone even made it, I had to laugh because there was a comment.

39:53.900 --> 39:58.800
It was a developer actually, uh, for those get trying stuff on the Wii U.

39:58.800 --> 40:03.880
And they were saying, all Nintendo is trying to do is sell a, uh, TV size DS.

40:03.880 --> 40:06.680
I'm like, we've been, he's like, why isn't anybody in the games pressing?

40:06.680 --> 40:09.600
And they're like, we've been fucking saying that for months.

40:09.600 --> 40:13.020
That's all the Wii U is going to be is just a giant DS.

40:13.020 --> 40:19.640
He's all, you know, basically the D or the Wii U game pad works well at a demo kiosk.

40:19.640 --> 40:23.140
But when you actually back it away from the TV, then you have to constantly look down

40:23.140 --> 40:25.520
at your controller and stuff like that too.

40:25.520 --> 40:27.400
It just doesn't really flow well.

40:27.400 --> 40:29.700
Uh, alpha Kananagram in our chat room says sky.

40:29.700 --> 40:32.920
It's going to bring in H fucking D. Okay.

40:32.920 --> 40:37.120
I can respect that and all like I'm, you know, Mario and HD will be fine and all, but let's

40:37.120 --> 40:38.120
be real.

40:38.120 --> 40:41.120
New Super Mario Brothers is not the game I want to see in HD.

40:41.120 --> 40:44.560
F fucking zero is the game I want to see in HD.

40:44.560 --> 40:45.560
Hello.

40:45.560 --> 40:48.840
Or even a new like 3d Mario game would be pretty awesome.

40:48.840 --> 40:49.840
That would be awesome.

40:49.840 --> 40:50.840
Yeah.

40:50.840 --> 40:52.360
I'm like, that's, it's not exactly the greatest starting point.

40:52.360 --> 40:59.120
Can you imagine a Metroid prime in HD imagine like a super Mario world esque game in 3d

40:59.120 --> 41:03.040
like kind of like Zelda ish, you know, big adventure type game.

41:03.040 --> 41:04.640
That would be fucking awesome.

41:04.640 --> 41:06.120
Not new Super Mario Brothers.

41:06.120 --> 41:07.120
You.

41:07.120 --> 41:08.120
All right.

41:08.120 --> 41:09.520
Last comment from chat and then we're going to move on with the show.

41:09.520 --> 41:13.120
Tiger claw says, but by the way, new Super Mario Brothers two, does it take advantage

41:13.120 --> 41:14.160
of the 3d?

41:14.160 --> 41:15.960
How does the 3d look on a 2d plane?

41:15.960 --> 41:20.000
I think I said this a little bit before, but it doesn't really use the 3d a lot.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.280
I mean, it's pretty much the backgrounds on one layer.

41:22.280 --> 41:27.320
I mean, there, there are some subtle effects, but, but that's okay.

41:27.320 --> 41:28.960
I want to, I want to point this out.

41:28.960 --> 41:32.760
Not every 3ds game has to whore the 3d like crazy.

41:32.760 --> 41:35.000
I think this is a good thing.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.920
It's the 3d is subtle and is not a game changer.

41:37.920 --> 41:41.860
If you want a game that whores the 3d, but does it very, very, very well, go play the

41:41.860 --> 41:48.120
Mario 3d land, because that was an original Mario game, despite the fact that certainly

41:48.120 --> 41:53.160
it has a lot in common with Mario 64 and all that because the 3d brought some awesome elements

41:53.160 --> 41:54.160
into it.

41:54.160 --> 41:59.560
That game felt very original, despite the fact it was a formula at the end of the day.

41:59.560 --> 42:04.960
So go figure maybe, maybe sitting next to Mario 3d land.

42:04.960 --> 42:07.600
This game feels a little bit like a step backwards.

42:07.600 --> 42:08.600
I don't know.

42:08.600 --> 42:09.600
That sounds like a very harsh thing to say.

42:09.600 --> 42:14.120
It makes it sound like I don't like gamers, but you know, cause three land was actually

42:14.120 --> 42:18.520
pretty innovative and it was a pretty awesome game.

42:18.520 --> 42:19.520
I don't know.

42:19.520 --> 42:23.160
New Super Mario Bros, the first one was a pretty awesome game, but it's just, you've

42:23.160 --> 42:29.920
done it now three times and you're going to do it again one more time and you haven't

42:29.920 --> 42:33.160
really changed it up that much.

42:33.160 --> 42:37.600
I mean, it's basically like, cause even before it was like, Hey, look, we created this tech

42:37.600 --> 42:42.120
demo of the, the Miis running around in like this New Super Mario Brothers thing.

42:42.120 --> 42:44.080
And that's, that was the Wii U tech demo.

42:44.080 --> 42:48.680
And I'm like, that's just New Super Mario Brothers, but they have, you know, it was

42:48.680 --> 42:49.800
just a tech demo.

42:49.800 --> 42:50.800
And then guess what they did?

42:50.800 --> 42:52.760
Cause they did this with all their fucking tech demos.

42:52.760 --> 42:54.120
They turned it into a game.

42:54.120 --> 42:57.640
It's like, Oh my fucking God, you didn't do anything.

42:57.640 --> 43:03.280
You just, you just have four, you have four people running around in this game, just like

43:03.280 --> 43:04.680
you can on the Wii version.

43:04.680 --> 43:08.480
Oh, but there's a fifth person that can do shit for some reason.

43:08.480 --> 43:12.120
I'll probably still get a Wii U.

43:12.120 --> 43:14.480
I got problems.

43:14.480 --> 43:15.600
I got problems.

43:15.600 --> 43:16.880
Don't get it at launch.

43:16.880 --> 43:18.000
We'll see.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.320
We'll see.

43:19.320 --> 43:21.080
There's nothing coming.

43:21.080 --> 43:22.080
There's nothing.

43:22.080 --> 43:25.920
Despite everything I'm saying, despite I look, I'm just going to admit it.

43:25.920 --> 43:28.920
Despite everything I'm saying here and now about originality and all that.

43:28.920 --> 43:33.720
The first time I play that New Super Mario Brothers Wii U or whatever in HD, I'm going

43:33.720 --> 43:36.440
to be like, Oh, I want it.

43:36.440 --> 43:39.280
And I'll have it cause I want it.

43:39.280 --> 43:42.560
I'm not planning, I'm not planning on buying one.

43:42.560 --> 43:44.040
I don't, I don't need that system.

43:44.040 --> 43:45.240
I don't play the Wii enough.

43:45.240 --> 43:48.000
I'm no.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.800
All right, let's move on with some gaming news.

43:50.800 --> 43:57.360
Oh wait, housekeeping, uh, visit us at twitter.com slash O L R or on Facebook, facebook.com

43:57.360 --> 43:58.840
slash orange lounge radio.

43:58.840 --> 44:03.800
And of course visit our network that we are affiliated, affiliated with and tape live

44:03.800 --> 44:08.940
at the voice of geeks network or vog network.com I wrote a review of sound shapes so you can

44:08.940 --> 44:09.940
check out.

44:09.940 --> 44:10.940
That's there.

44:10.940 --> 44:13.800
And there's some other, a book review went up last week of Stargate by a, the guy from

44:13.800 --> 44:16.640
critical myth and lots of good stuff on the site.

44:16.640 --> 44:17.640
So check that out.

44:17.640 --> 44:21.960
Vogue network.com let's get into some gaming news.

44:21.960 --> 44:25.640
Loki just, I guess tons of Sony shit coming out of games com.

44:25.640 --> 44:29.120
Well there's like 20 stories and I'm like, you know what?

44:29.120 --> 44:30.120
This is do them all.

44:30.120 --> 44:31.120
Let's do them all.

44:31.120 --> 44:32.120
Here you go.

44:32.120 --> 44:33.120
All kind of tied to each other.

44:33.120 --> 44:34.520
Well it's some non Sony stuff real quick.

44:34.520 --> 44:38.080
Um, there was a game that Capcom kind of brought out of nowhere.

44:38.080 --> 44:42.080
They're calling it kind of the, um, you know, the game of games com.

44:42.080 --> 44:45.080
It was remember me, which was kind of cool.

44:45.080 --> 44:48.000
It had a little bit of like you hack into people's memories.

44:48.000 --> 44:52.920
Um, I always think of that fucking terrible movie with Robert Pattinson that had that

44:52.920 --> 44:53.920
twist ending.

44:53.920 --> 44:56.480
You remember that it was called remember me?

44:56.480 --> 44:58.940
No cause I never saw it.

44:58.940 --> 45:00.160
So I don't remember it.

45:00.160 --> 45:01.160
It's terrible.

45:01.160 --> 45:02.480
The twist ending is terrible too.

45:02.480 --> 45:03.480
Yeah.

45:03.480 --> 45:05.280
So it was like the watchdogs of game con.

45:05.280 --> 45:06.280
It looked pretty awesome.

45:06.280 --> 45:07.280
Okay.

45:07.280 --> 45:11.120
So it's nice to see there's going to be some of these really big games coming out next

45:11.120 --> 45:12.120
year.

45:12.120 --> 45:13.120
That are original.

45:13.120 --> 45:14.120
Our original.

45:14.120 --> 45:15.120
Yes.

45:15.120 --> 45:16.120
Exactly.

45:16.120 --> 45:19.840
But Sony, Sony was kind of shocking cause they had a press conference during games con

45:19.840 --> 45:24.960
and they actually had like a lot of new IPs that they brought out.

45:24.960 --> 45:28.400
Um, just like, wow, you know, this is amazing.

45:28.400 --> 45:34.820
So one of the games that they showed off was a puppeteer and puppeteer, um, I guess is

45:34.820 --> 45:41.560
coming from Sony on or I guess, uh, yeah, Sony online entertainment and it's a new platformer

45:41.560 --> 45:50.840
from a Sony Japan studios and it's very, it reminded me of, um, like clockwork night.

45:50.840 --> 45:55.140
If you remember that from the Sega Saturn, at least that's what it reminded me of.

45:55.140 --> 46:00.220
But it was very unique looking game, like kind of a platformer with this like puppet

46:00.220 --> 46:04.440
looking animation, two different things, but it was pretty cool.

46:04.440 --> 46:05.760
So they have that come out.

46:05.760 --> 46:11.000
Um, another game they had was rain, which kind of reminded me a little bit of limbo.

46:11.000 --> 46:16.360
Um, or even that one game, a loss in shadow that came out from Konami.

46:16.360 --> 46:20.840
It's basically a PlayStation network game that's going to be coming out that features

46:20.840 --> 46:26.520
these invisible, like an invisible boy who, um, can only be seen in rain.

46:26.520 --> 46:32.800
Um, so you're wandering around this environment and stuff and solving puzzles based on, uh,

46:32.800 --> 46:37.160
you know, this kind of invisible character, which is a kind of neat.

46:37.160 --> 46:41.040
And then I don't know what I should think about this one, but until dawn, it's going

46:41.040 --> 46:45.400
to be a teen horror movie style game that utilizes the move.

46:45.400 --> 46:47.440
That actually sounds kind of awesome.

46:47.440 --> 46:51.680
I hope, I hope this is night trap bad.

46:51.680 --> 46:52.680
That would be awesome.

46:52.680 --> 46:57.800
I think, I think the industry needs a good team, like the annoying parts of night trap,

46:57.800 --> 46:59.120
like the watching the monitors.

46:59.120 --> 47:00.120
Yeah.

47:00.120 --> 47:02.520
The industry needs a game like night trap again.

47:02.520 --> 47:03.520
Let's be real.

47:03.520 --> 47:04.520
Time to resurrect.

47:04.520 --> 47:05.520
Dana Plato.

47:05.520 --> 47:11.640
Apparently you play as seven, um, different teenagers facing unspecified horrors in the

47:11.640 --> 47:17.360
woods, you know, cause that's pretty much every horror movie, um, at least recently.

47:17.360 --> 47:23.360
And then, um, one other thing they showed off wonder book again, and I've got to say

47:23.360 --> 47:27.240
this presentation of wonder book was way better than the one that they did at E3.

47:27.240 --> 47:31.140
It was shorter and they showed some new stuff, including not only are they going to have

47:31.140 --> 47:35.720
the whole, you know, uh, book of spells thing, which looked okay in the new trailer, but

47:35.720 --> 47:41.000
they have this new, um, they got a licensing with BBC's walking with dinosaurs, which looks

47:41.000 --> 47:42.520
pretty awesome.

47:42.520 --> 47:48.640
And digs night crawler, which is kind of a noir fairy tale type game.

47:48.640 --> 47:54.440
You play this worm who's a detective solving fairy tale crimes, kind of sounds almost like

47:54.440 --> 47:55.440
it could be a book.

47:55.440 --> 47:59.700
You know, I think it might even be a book series, but, um, those will be coming out

47:59.700 --> 48:00.700
later on.

48:00.700 --> 48:04.840
Uh, I think right now wonder book is launching with books of spells and that's it.

48:04.840 --> 48:05.840
Wait.

48:05.840 --> 48:09.440
So does this mean you have, you have come full circle, full circle and you are a fan

48:09.440 --> 48:10.440
of wonder book now?

48:10.440 --> 48:11.440
I'm not a fan of it.

48:11.440 --> 48:14.860
No, but it looks, it looks interesting for people that might be into that stuff.

48:14.860 --> 48:20.640
Like I was thinking for, uh, the accounts I deal with, like ideal library chain or you

48:20.640 --> 48:27.880
know, the old libraries in the U S and obviously this type of stuff would be good for them

48:27.880 --> 48:29.340
or people that sell books.

48:29.340 --> 48:32.280
But no, for me personally, no.

48:32.280 --> 48:36.120
You know, what's making a comeback though that ain't got sh or that wonder book ain't

48:36.120 --> 48:37.480
got shit on.

48:37.480 --> 48:38.480
You know what?

48:38.480 --> 48:39.720
You know, what's making a huge comeback.

48:39.720 --> 48:42.400
Brace yourself for it.

48:42.400 --> 48:48.840
Fucking reading rainbow is back.

48:48.840 --> 48:49.840
Seriously?

48:49.840 --> 48:50.840
Yeah.

48:50.840 --> 48:54.940
It's like, I think it's like an iOS type thing now.

48:54.940 --> 48:59.320
Like they're making apps out of it where it's not like a show, but it's like, cause LeVar

48:59.320 --> 49:03.440
Burton pimping books better how LeVar Burton associated with it.

49:03.440 --> 49:05.480
Like, okay, here's the thing.

49:05.480 --> 49:10.200
Imagine if wonder book instead had been called reading rainbow, we would all be losing our

49:10.200 --> 49:11.200
shit over it.

49:11.200 --> 49:15.280
All they had to do is get LeVar Burton out on stage going, it's the shit guys.

49:15.280 --> 49:24.520
We would have been like, take my money, take it, take it of the intro to this show.

49:24.520 --> 49:27.000
I love that old logo too.

49:27.000 --> 49:28.960
It's so eighties and gorgeous.

49:28.960 --> 49:33.020
The only thing that pissed me off about reading rainbow is that the books were always checked

49:33.020 --> 49:34.160
out at the library.

49:34.160 --> 49:35.320
You try to go find the books.

49:35.320 --> 49:36.320
They were always gone.

49:36.320 --> 49:42.340
No one in Alabama reads.

49:42.340 --> 49:48.080
Some other cool stuff, um, before all that they were showing media molecules new game

49:48.080 --> 49:53.300
and it's just fantastically and it's a game called tear away.

49:53.300 --> 49:57.760
It's on the Vita and basically the whole world kind of looks like paper.

49:57.760 --> 50:01.360
And so a lot of the stuff you can do in there, you can actually interact with the game.

50:01.360 --> 50:05.360
So like you can push your finger up on the back of the touch panel and you'll actually

50:05.360 --> 50:11.640
see your finger coming through the screen, which is kind of weird.

50:11.640 --> 50:15.200
Um, you can literally finger your Vita.

50:15.200 --> 50:18.960
You can literally finger your via, yes.

50:18.960 --> 50:24.720
Um, but it's going to utilize the camera in different motion based stuff and it looks

50:24.720 --> 50:28.120
fantastic cause it's meeting molecule.

50:28.120 --> 50:29.120
I mean, come on.

50:29.120 --> 50:30.120
I'm sorry.

50:30.120 --> 50:34.920
I'm just so glad the Vita's finally found a use for that back touch pad.

50:34.920 --> 50:37.720
Now you can watch your finger go up the Vita.

50:37.720 --> 50:38.720
Yep.

50:38.720 --> 50:39.720
Yep.

50:39.720 --> 50:40.720
You can.

50:40.720 --> 50:44.760
Uh, they showed off a kill zone mercenary, which is going to be a new first person shooter

50:44.760 --> 50:45.760
on the Vita.

50:45.760 --> 50:47.480
Uh, look kind of cool.

50:47.480 --> 50:53.840
They also showed call of duty black ops declassified, which I was very interested in picking it

50:53.840 --> 51:00.000
up until I realized that it's the guys that made the last resistance game, burning skies

51:00.000 --> 51:01.320
and that game sucked.

51:01.320 --> 51:03.960
So probably not going to pick up this call of duty game.

51:03.960 --> 51:06.880
Can we go back to the fingering thing for a minute?

51:06.880 --> 51:11.720
A sitting vampire in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says someone's going to put their Dick on

51:11.720 --> 51:12.720
it.

51:12.720 --> 51:15.960
So what would happen if you put something besides it?

51:15.960 --> 51:20.720
Stances like someone hasn't already, what would happen if you put like something else

51:20.720 --> 51:21.720
on the back touch?

51:21.720 --> 51:22.720
Here's the thing.

51:22.720 --> 51:26.920
I don't really understand how it works because they're going to have, it actually is an image

51:26.920 --> 51:27.920
of your finger.

51:27.920 --> 51:28.920
It like utilizes the camera.

51:28.920 --> 51:30.000
Like it captures that.

51:30.000 --> 51:34.320
So yes, you would see a penis coming up through the back of the screen.

51:34.320 --> 51:37.000
If you were somehow, or would your penis turn into a finger?

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
I don't know.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
All right.

51:39.000 --> 51:42.200
Well, I'm assuming it's not, I'm, that's a really big finger.

51:42.200 --> 51:43.200
I don't know.

51:43.200 --> 51:44.200
For some people maybe really small.

51:44.200 --> 51:46.200
Is that your thumb?

51:46.200 --> 51:50.760
Cause there's no way for the camera to capture the image of your finger, you know, on that

51:50.760 --> 51:51.760
back touch panel.

51:51.760 --> 51:57.120
It just doesn't, it's out of the scope of the lens, but I don't know.

51:57.120 --> 52:02.120
I mean, let's say have you capture your finger, but I think that yes, that is your finger

52:02.120 --> 52:05.760
look like a sea cucumber.

52:05.760 --> 52:10.240
This is one of the great mysteries.

52:10.240 --> 52:17.820
What will happen when you put your Dick on the rear touch pad?

52:17.820 --> 52:20.600
Find out on the next OLR.

52:20.600 --> 52:27.840
You'll make it, you'll make a mess.

52:27.840 --> 52:30.200
I don't want to have that trade in system.

52:30.200 --> 52:31.200
Yeah.

52:31.200 --> 52:39.000
I played a lot of tear away alone at night.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.560
There's too much penis.

52:40.560 --> 52:46.680
Speaking of, uh, into windows, I guess ratchet and clank full frontal assault is coming to

52:46.680 --> 52:53.720
the Vita as well.

52:53.720 --> 52:58.200
You did that on purpose.

52:58.200 --> 52:59.920
Rob's red.

52:59.920 --> 53:02.560
Um, full frontal assault.

53:02.560 --> 53:03.560
Yeah.

53:03.560 --> 53:07.400
Not only will it be a full frontal assault on the Vita, but also on your PS3 and it's

53:07.400 --> 53:10.840
going to be one of these games that utilizes this brand new thing to be announced, which

53:10.840 --> 53:15.940
is the PlayStation cross by, which is awesome.

53:15.940 --> 53:16.940
Cross by.

53:16.940 --> 53:21.120
Basically you purchase a game on the PS3, you get the Vita version for free.

53:21.120 --> 53:22.120
Fuck.

53:22.120 --> 53:23.120
Yeah.

53:23.120 --> 53:24.120
That's the way you do it.

53:24.120 --> 53:25.120
I like, this is a great trend.

53:25.120 --> 53:26.120
That sound shape started.

53:26.120 --> 53:27.120
Exactly.

53:27.120 --> 53:31.000
Um, another game that's got feature that I hope though, because this was a good point

53:31.000 --> 53:34.520
that came up when Bobby was talking about this earlier on his show, I want it to not

53:34.520 --> 53:35.640
just be digital.

53:35.640 --> 53:38.800
That's my concern is that that would only be the deal if you get it digitally.

53:38.800 --> 53:39.800
It's going to be digital.

53:39.800 --> 53:42.760
I thought, Oh, but I'm running out of room on the PS3 and then I'm going to buy a bigger

53:42.760 --> 53:48.680
hardware memory card, that's, that's the trick is that those stinking Vita memory cards are

53:48.680 --> 53:49.680
so expensive.

53:49.680 --> 53:53.800
They're not that expensive, but did they come down to price finally when they released the,

53:53.800 --> 53:55.240
the prices of those aren't that expensive.

53:55.240 --> 54:00.220
I thought it was, no, um, uh, another game that's going to support that as well is going

54:00.220 --> 54:02.080
to be PlayStation all stars.

54:02.080 --> 54:05.160
JV Mon reminds us in chat play pinball arcade on the Vita.

54:05.160 --> 54:06.160
Does that too?

54:06.160 --> 54:08.160
I have it on my phone.

54:08.160 --> 54:09.160
On my phone.

54:09.160 --> 54:11.160
I don't need a Vita.

54:11.160 --> 54:15.840
Um, also another, um, game that's going to support that little big planet.

54:15.840 --> 54:18.280
The DLC is also cross platform.

54:18.280 --> 54:23.120
So if you buy, you know, any DLC you have now for a little big planet one and two, we'll

54:23.120 --> 54:26.540
work with a little big planet Vita and little big planet carding.

54:26.540 --> 54:27.720
So that's kind of cool.

54:27.720 --> 54:28.720
That's awesome.

54:28.720 --> 54:29.720
Yeah.

54:29.720 --> 54:31.420
A little big planet carding I hope is one of those games too.

54:31.420 --> 54:35.200
I think it is one of the cross buying games, so that's pretty sweet.

54:35.200 --> 54:39.920
And then, um, PlayStation plus coming to the Vita as well and they're upping the cloud

54:39.920 --> 54:42.000
storage to one gigabyte.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.120
So, um, that's pretty sweet.

54:44.120 --> 54:49.120
Also announced that, um, I guess Europe is going to be getting Red Dead Redemption, um,

54:49.120 --> 54:50.120
free in September.

54:50.120 --> 54:52.000
So that's pretty sweet.

54:52.000 --> 54:55.200
Um, and then also PlayStation mobile.

54:55.200 --> 54:58.520
They talked a little bit about that and talked about some of the launch games and there was

54:58.520 --> 55:00.640
a big old trailer on there.

55:00.640 --> 55:04.920
And one of the things I saw, I remember was Lemmings and I'm like, Holy shit, Lemmings.

55:04.920 --> 55:06.520
But uh, that's going to be one of the games.

55:06.520 --> 55:12.800
Uh, also they mentioned that, uh, PlayStation mobile will be compatible with, uh, Sony Xperia

55:12.800 --> 55:15.680
phones, uh, also Vitas.

55:15.680 --> 55:20.600
And then they revealed that, uh, the ACES and Wiki pad tablets are going to be getting,

55:20.600 --> 55:22.960
um, PlayStation mobile as well.

55:22.960 --> 55:26.800
And they're going to be adding stuff or different devices to that as well.

55:26.800 --> 55:29.680
So that's pretty cool.

55:29.680 --> 55:30.680
That's everything.

55:30.680 --> 55:34.200
That's a lot of news coming out of Gamescom, but that makes sense because Sony has a pretty

55:34.200 --> 55:35.320
big presence in Europe.

55:35.320 --> 55:38.400
They've always done pretty well there ever since the original PlayStation.

55:38.400 --> 55:39.840
So it's kind of exciting.

55:39.840 --> 55:42.640
And then I'm assuming there'll be even more Tokyo game show.

55:42.640 --> 55:43.640
Right?

55:43.640 --> 55:46.000
Uh, probably that's pretty cool.

55:46.000 --> 55:49.960
I'm really excited about the whole Vita PlayStation three crossover.

55:49.960 --> 55:53.560
I'm glad that I'm like, I'm glad that I'll be able to do something with my Vita cause

55:53.560 --> 55:58.800
I haven't really, I'm telling you sound shapes, sound shapes is a great, they should be pushing

55:58.800 --> 55:59.800
it more.

55:59.800 --> 56:03.040
It's, it's a great holdover game until they get some more stuff.

56:03.040 --> 56:07.760
I wonder if that final fantasy 10 remake is going to be, um, buy one, get both because

56:07.760 --> 56:10.400
they were pimping it for both systems.

56:10.400 --> 56:12.280
Well it's right now.

56:12.280 --> 56:14.160
It's been first party that's been doing that.

56:14.160 --> 56:15.160
Oh yeah.

56:15.160 --> 56:16.160
Yeah.

56:16.160 --> 56:17.160
Technically it's pretty cool.

56:17.160 --> 56:21.320
I mean that might get me the, by the PS three version of black ops two, maybe if it was

56:21.320 --> 56:22.320
like that.

56:22.320 --> 56:26.560
Although, like I said, black ops class of declassified, the fact that it's being done

56:26.560 --> 56:31.280
by the guys that the resistance brings guys and the trailer just didn't look that great.

56:31.280 --> 56:34.240
I was just, uh, made me sad.

56:34.240 --> 56:35.240
All right.

56:35.240 --> 56:42.000
Well in case you haven't heard the 3ds XL did release today, the suggested retail price

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
$199.99.

56:43.000 --> 56:46.120
Although there are some deals out there, like I know Fry's electronics was selling it today

56:46.120 --> 56:47.120
for $179.99.

56:47.120 --> 56:51.480
Uh, so, you know, look around on the internet and all that stuff to see where you can get

56:51.480 --> 56:52.480
the best deal.

56:52.480 --> 56:57.320
Sadly, we don't get the Pikachu version here, uh, but we do get the red version.

56:57.320 --> 56:59.960
I think there's a red and a blue one that came out here.

56:59.960 --> 57:03.480
And of course new super Mario brothers two also released today as I already talked about,

57:03.480 --> 57:06.460
uh, it's kind of the kickoff game for that console.

57:06.460 --> 57:08.440
So there you go with the 3ds XL.

57:08.440 --> 57:09.440
Just a reminder.

57:09.440 --> 57:10.440
It is out.

57:10.440 --> 57:12.920
Get the red one, put a Charmander sticker on it.

57:12.920 --> 57:17.360
My big like concern about getting one of these right now is that again, I think I mentioned

57:17.360 --> 57:20.920
this last week, they'll just turn around and release like a really beautiful color.

57:20.920 --> 57:23.920
Like that purple, that purple 3ds is so gorgeous.

57:23.920 --> 57:28.080
Like I wish that had been the launch color that they would have never had to do another

57:28.080 --> 57:29.080
color.

57:29.080 --> 57:30.080
That'd be great.

57:30.080 --> 57:32.200
So I'm, I'm curious about the XL.

57:32.200 --> 57:37.600
I've heard it's a good system, but at the same time, like I, do I want to pay 200 bucks

57:37.600 --> 57:39.160
for a new one when I already have one?

57:39.160 --> 57:40.160
I know.

57:40.160 --> 57:41.700
I don't think I can justify that really.

57:41.700 --> 57:43.120
So we'll see.

57:43.120 --> 57:44.120
But it's out.

57:44.120 --> 57:45.120
Dark Sakura.

57:45.120 --> 57:49.600
Well, we do have some news on the corporate front.

57:49.600 --> 57:52.360
I'll say, I'll, I'll put it in those words.

57:52.360 --> 57:55.160
Who remembers on live?

57:55.160 --> 58:00.280
I remember their big booth at E3 and nobody, like nobody thought on live was going to work.

58:00.280 --> 58:03.160
And then they showed up at E3 and they were like, this works.

58:03.160 --> 58:05.960
And everybody's like, holy shit, it does work.

58:05.960 --> 58:11.480
Well, um, right now they're actually, uh, there was something going around about a sort

58:11.480 --> 58:13.640
of bankruptcy going on.

58:13.640 --> 58:17.180
And honestly, this article is really hard to read because all the texts has crossed

58:17.180 --> 58:18.920
over and the HTML is screwed up.

58:18.920 --> 58:21.640
Well there was so much and there was so much back and forth on this this week.

58:21.640 --> 58:24.680
Like nobody really has a clear understanding what's going on.

58:24.680 --> 58:25.680
Totally.

58:25.680 --> 58:26.680
The coding on this is awful.

58:26.680 --> 58:28.340
Just saying.

58:28.340 --> 58:32.840
So anyway, basically they were saying that there was an acquisition of their assets by

58:32.840 --> 58:35.260
a company as a sale.

58:35.260 --> 58:38.720
Instead it has to do with like, um, bankruptcy protection.

58:38.720 --> 58:44.240
They have, I believe, been acquired, but in, in kind of a different deal.

58:44.240 --> 58:46.080
Well, you know what's different about it.

58:46.080 --> 58:47.080
They won't say who.

58:47.080 --> 58:48.080
Yeah.

58:48.080 --> 58:49.080
That's the big thing.

58:49.080 --> 58:50.080
It's not weird.

58:50.080 --> 58:53.600
It sounded to me that they created their, like their own company, like they created

58:53.600 --> 58:54.600
another company.

58:54.600 --> 58:55.600
I call this OnLive2.

58:55.600 --> 58:56.600
Off Dead.

58:56.600 --> 58:57.600
Off Dead.

58:57.600 --> 58:58.600
Let her finish.

58:58.600 --> 58:59.600
Let her finish.

58:59.600 --> 59:00.600
Cause I want to get into this a little bit.

59:00.600 --> 59:02.280
Well, here's what the, what the official quote is.

59:02.280 --> 59:06.640
It's like, we can now confirm the assets of OnLive Incorporated have been acquired into

59:06.640 --> 59:11.960
a newly formed company and is backed by substantial funding and will continue to operate the online

59:11.960 --> 59:16.600
game and desktop service, blah, blah, blah, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

59:16.600 --> 59:24.320
They are releasing the OnLive employees, um, and I think have put out a call to rehire

59:24.320 --> 59:28.440
them with the new company, which I mean basically how this worked with the company that I worked

59:28.440 --> 59:34.440
for before when we were sold is that, yeah, we were released from the previous corporation,

59:34.440 --> 59:40.040
but we were hired quote by the new company as, and we know with all of our tenure and

59:40.040 --> 59:41.520
everything intact.

59:41.520 --> 59:47.400
So I think that what it's looking like is either they have fully released them or they

59:47.400 --> 59:50.440
are sending the note out there that, yeah, we want you here.

59:50.440 --> 59:54.920
We want to keep you around, you know, just maybe trying to get them to reapply through

59:54.920 --> 59:56.440
different hiring channels or something.

59:56.440 --> 01:00:03.560
I mean, maybe you want to bring them all and see, you know, if they're loyal to the product.

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:04.560
I don't know.

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.560
The whole thing is a little weird.

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:08.200
You know, it was very, like, this is super bizarre.

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:09.500
You should have seen this play out.

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:13.220
You should have seen this playing out on Twitter because like, you know, you know, at first

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:15.960
it was OnLive has completely shut down.

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:16.960
They're bankrupt.

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:17.960
They're gone.

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:23.560
You know, and the OnLive Twitter, they've yet to really say anything officially.

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:26.240
And it was at the point where, like, people were reporting, yeah, we drove down to the

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:30.180
OnLive offices and we see people are walking out of here with boxes and all this stuff.

01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:33.560
So clearly the company's not going to hire some people back.

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:38.040
And I think everything's just in this big state of flux right now.

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:43.720
You know, and it's never good news when people lose their jobs in the gaming industry, and

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:45.920
this is always tough to talk about.

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:54.040
But I do have to ask the hard question, OnLive kind of, I mean, as a service, it was bringing

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:57.080
a lot of great things to the table, but the one thing that was really missing was like

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.080
games.

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:02.560
Like, a lot of the games that it launched with when launching is your first impression

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.620
were years old and kind of old news.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.960
And sure, they tried to add to that.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:11.080
And they did some cool things with the service, like the replays and some of that other stuff

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:12.080
they were doing.

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:16.720
And the desk, I'm sorry, the TV top systems and all that they were doing, they had some

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:17.720
great ideas.

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:21.480
But it's like, they just didn't have the games to back it up, and they didn't have the deals

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:23.160
to back it up like Steam did.

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:27.180
The coolest thing they had going for it were the hour-long demos that you didn't really

01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:28.180
have to download anything.

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:30.080
You just did it through the cloud.

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:35.400
But it wasn't, like, they weren't really getting exclusives or, you know, it was tricky.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:36.400
It was tricky.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:40.360
And I can see where the company's hurting when they're, you know, I think the report

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:44.360
had come out that only several thousand people out of the millions that had signed up were

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.320
only ever on the service at any one time.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:47.320
Yeah.

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:49.600
Sixteen hundred and they had eight thousand servers.

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:54.000
So that was a lot of unused servers that had to be maintained.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:01.960
So I'm just really, I mean, they clearly, someone believes in the product.

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:07.600
I just want to look at Sony bought their biggest competitor, Gaikai, which was a very similar

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:08.600
sort of thing.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:12.560
But Gaikai was kind of doing, they had the whole stuff in the browsers and they were

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:16.080
getting some deals where the demos were streamed to them like they were kind of trying to push

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:17.400
the envelope a little more.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.720
And, you know, now Sony acquired them.

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:20.720
Yeah.

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:24.400
Here's the other thing that kind of sucks, too, is basically some of the people were

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:28.000
offered, you know, consulting arrangements also.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.840
They said that, you know, they had they asked some of the employees to help smooth the transition

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.080
to the new startup.

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:39.000
And those people were offered stock options in the new company.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:45.040
However, that's those stock are basically worthless unless the company at some point

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:50.960
becomes profitable and, you know, basically it's sold or goes public.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:03:00.880
So you get an IOU, maybe we'll fulfill that money if if we are successful.

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:04.600
Well, best of luck to the folks that find themselves displaced this week with a whole

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:05.840
on live stuff.

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:11.120
I hope they're able to land work quickly somewhere else, as we usually feel in these types of

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.120
situations.

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:13.120
So.

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.120
All right.

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:16.120
Anyhow, if that's it.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:17.120
Yeah.

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:18.120
Let's move on.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:23.800
So speaking of other cloud services, GameStop, they have a cloud streaming service that's

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:29.080
going to be coming to PCs, tablets and Internet TVs.

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:34.320
Of course, you know, you may remember that they acquired Spawn Labs and Impulse last

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:35.320
year.

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:41.120
And basically it said based on consumer feedback, our success in selling mobile devices and

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:48.680
imminent launch of new consoles, we have decided to move our technology to PC based model.

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:55.560
And, you know, they're going to be only offering it to those devices not going to be coming

01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:00.240
to any sort of game consoles in the future, probably because I would be willing to bet

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:03.920
that those other companies have their own streaming ideas in place.

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:06.360
Like we know Sony clearly Sony does.

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:09.760
So maybe Microsoft's kind of going that similar route.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:14.060
So it's not that yes, we're not going to put our stuff on those consoles.

01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:19.120
More like those console developers don't want us to put our stuff on their consoles.

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:24.180
So, you know, one of the first rumors I read was that Microsoft bought on live, which would

01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:27.000
seem like, no, it's just that's not what happened.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.460
You know, because sometimes Microsoft buys companies.

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:35.120
But I think in this case, they'll try to just reinvent it and make it better and put their

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:36.120
own name on it.

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.120
You know what I mean?

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:38.120
Yeah.

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:41.880
I don't think if it was like bought by Microsoft, they'd be more, you know, more open about

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:42.880
it.

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:43.880
Fair about it.

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:44.880
Yeah.

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:45.880
We're going to lay everybody off.

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:46.880
But that was one of the first early.

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:49.340
You know, you know how Twitter goes, people.

01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:52.520
Everybody's everybody's a skeptic and everybody's an analyst.

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:55.840
So yeah.

01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:01.640
So yeah, they're saying, you know, I guess GameStop had proposed a scenario before where

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:04.740
they were saying that users would need to own a retail copy of a particular game they

01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:06.400
wish to stream from cloud.

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:10.480
Although now that's not necessarily going to be the case, because if it's not going

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:14.280
to tie into consoles, then what are they going to own?

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:15.620
So I don't know.

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:16.880
It's an interesting idea.

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:21.880
And I know how they're selling their own tablets and stuff, but it seems like it's such a crowded

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:24.080
market space out there.

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:29.040
I mean, I know you can trade in games for like these tablets and phones and stuff, but

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:31.280
why would I want to buy?

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:33.000
Why would I want to stream games from them?

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000
That just doesn't.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
I don't know.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000
It just doesn't seem appealing to me at all.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000
I like the idea of being able to like stream demos and things like that without having

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.440
to download like, like that whole secret world.

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:49.780
I talked about that a couple of weeks ago, this MMO that I tried out the secret world.

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:53.600
I had to download a 15 gig thing to try that just to figure out that, you know what, I

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:54.760
don't really have time for this right now.

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:58.480
It would have been a lot nicer if I could have just streamed it through something like

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:01.080
this and to make my opinion.

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:03.040
And there are other MMOs that allow you to do this.

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:07.120
I'm sorry to be so MMO centric, but you know, it's kind of what comes to mind is it's a

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:11.640
great, that's a great use for the streaming technology is, is the demos, of course.

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:14.760
Are you getting your full graphical potential of the game that way?

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:17.320
I don't know, but yeah, that's another thing.

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:22.560
And then also, you know, with some of these devices, um, you know, not everybody's upgraded

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:26.720
their wireless network, so you may be running wireless G and that's going to throttle you

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:32.360
a little bit and, um, or you know, you have to be connected to the wifi for the stuff

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:33.360
to work.

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:39.760
Uh, for most part, I just, I, my tablet has a weird tendency to cut in and out of the

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:40.760
wifi too.

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:44.840
Like I'll be connected to wifi and then like once every 15 minutes, it just drops for 15

01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:45.840
seconds.

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:46.840
And that'll kill your game.

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:51.960
If I'm trying to stream gamings off that don't like dealing with GameStop is kind of where

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:52.960
it's at there.

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:53.960
Yeah, that's a good point.

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:57.640
They will find a way to take the shrink wrap off those digital downloads before I purchase

01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:58.640
them.

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:04.020
I, I just know it's going to happen, but all right, well, this is a game that, uh, maybe

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:08.120
some of you will be streaming through a console later unconfirmed, but I don't know.

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:09.120
It's a big game.

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:14.040
Uh, Tekken tag tournament two, uh, you excited about this?

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:18.240
There's some more information that came out about this from game com, uh, games com, excuse

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:23.560
me, Tekken tag tournament two, it will support 3d so you can have, you know, 3d fighting

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:26.040
and kicking and all that 3d can be switched on or off.

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:29.560
The depth can be adjusted to whatever it is that you like on there.

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:33.840
There's also something called Tekken tunes where you can make your own custom soundtrack

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:36.860
by importing your own CDs or MP3s or whatever.

01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:41.440
There's also fight lab, which is a way that beginners can learn the play mechanics.

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:46.280
There's a robot fighter named combat and you will practice your techniques on that in order

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:47.880
to get through the fight lab.

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:51.380
I also noticed there's like a design, a character mode, like they have a little kitty girl here

01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:55.840
that's been made in the fighter mode, which seems to be a big thing in the Namco games

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:56.840
lately.

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:57.840
I like that's what soul caliber is all about.

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:01.880
Now I want the ability to make a Tekken three gin.

01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:05.460
Um, yeah, so there you go.

01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:08.480
Some of the new stuff coming in Tekken tag tournament two, I'm sure you're going to be

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:09.480
picking this up right there.

01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:15.120
Well, if I have money now, I'm the one who's not working at this table.

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:18.400
Some moves, just, you know, some moves in this whole create a mode thing.

01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:21.080
They have to be unlocked in the game.

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:26.920
So like if you want to, uh, get an, uh, if you want to get the Phoenix smash from Paul,

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:29.600
you have to get an S rank in order to get that.

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:33.920
So interesting or cheap or cheap.

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:39.240
So Tekken tag tournament two coming soon, dark soccer.

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:41.680
Well in other news, you know what?

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:45.980
I kind of want to play the sad trombone for this Rob, because this is how I feel looking

01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:46.980
this over.

01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:52.720
Oh, we can arrange that, but well, you know, and you're, you're, you're going to know why

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:53.720
I went at the moment.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:09:04.840
I say the game, final fantasy 14, well, um, basically they're, uh, they have this thing

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:10.520
called a realm reborn, which is, uh, the relaunch of final fantasy 14.

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:17.280
Um, and, uh, there's an interview with, um, Naoki Yoshida, um, who is saying that losing

01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:22.800
your fans trust is an easy thing to do and regaining it is very hard.

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:27.880
They, um, really think that they're going to be able to, uh, regain the fans trust by

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.140
rebuilding final fantasy 14.

01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:33.760
And they want that to be where they launch it from, say, Hey, this is great.

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:38.060
What's 15 and 16 going to be like, well, first of all, I'm like, stop numbering them.

01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:39.920
They won't be online MMOs.

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:40.920
Let's hope.

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:45.840
Um, he's quoted as saying over a long time, we'll try to regain their trust, but it is

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:51.440
something we as a company must put effort into long term, but they, they're admitting

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:55.000
that they're probably not going to get it back with just the one game.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:02.080
So right now, um, a realm reborn is in, uh, alpha it's a beta testing is going to be going

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:08.440
on later in the year and the PlayStation three group will be invited to join in on the beta.

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:12.760
So, um, another thing that he pointed out is that in the entire history of the final

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:18.720
fantasy, uh, series, there has not been one that failed, which is why they're not giving

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:19.920
up on 14.

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:25.360
You know, there's a lot of people that respond to that by saying, what about 13, but 13 wasn't,

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:29.160
why would they wouldn't have made 13 two if 13 was a failure.

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:33.440
Some people just straight up didn't like 13, which, you know, I can get the reasons why

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:34.760
people weren't into 13.

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:35.960
I liked it an awful lot.

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:38.200
If you didn't like it, it doesn't mean something failed.

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:39.200
Exactly.

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:40.360
Very good point.

01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:41.360
Very good point, internet.

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:43.400
It just means that you don't like it.

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:46.560
Other people do shut up, get over it, but don't take it.

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:47.560
This is okay.

01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:49.000
I have to read a minute.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.960
It pisses me off when I say I don't like something and someone else immediately says, Oh, well

01:10:53.960 --> 01:11:00.680
I do, you're wrong or will I do as if I'm wrong or vice versa.

01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:06.200
One person liking something or disliking something that you do not is not a personal reflection

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.200
on you.

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:14.600
Oh, person of very small willpower and self-worth, you know, end of rant.

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:17.560
But we can all agree final fantasy 14 was bad, right?

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:18.560
We can, we can all agree on that.

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:19.560
I didn't play it.

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:20.560
I actually can't tell you if it was bad or not.

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:21.560
It probably was.

01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:25.560
I haven't played it, but from what I heard, I'm just trying to make a joke.

01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:27.520
Obviously somebody's paying for it out there.

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:28.840
They wouldn't have any servers running.

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:31.800
I mean, I'm sure there's people that probably like it.

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:34.360
There are people who are like, I don't have anything else better to do.

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:39.200
I feel like our chat room at live.vognetwork.com has suddenly become a support group.

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:42.360
Break Man says some of us like Final Fantasy 13.

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:44.360
JV Mon says, I like 13.

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:46.200
Stan says, Hey, I liked 13.

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:47.280
I didn't like 12.

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:48.520
I liked what I played of it.

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:49.520
I just got a little bored.

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:53.000
Dungeon Buster says 13 was still commercially successful.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.200
Kitsune says, I liked Final Fantasy 13 too.

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:59.760
Didn't like dash two as much just because of that ending.

01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:07.280
But I mean, it's, it's the whole thing where it's like, I really don't know why people

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:08.280
do this.

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:12.040
I mean, it's probably a little shortsighted of me to say it's because someone has low

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:17.640
self esteem or thinks that everything that people are talking about is about them.

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:20.200
Maybe a little ego instead, who knows?

01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:25.880
But just because someone doesn't like something that you do, don't take it as a personal offense

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:26.880
the other way around.

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:29.880
It has no reflection on you as a person.

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:35.960
Uh, JV Mon in chat says, I dislike Final Fantasy seven, but respect other people's opinions

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:38.080
who differ from my own.

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:39.440
A model citizen.

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:40.440
Yes.

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:45.560
Uh, RDG Singe says, I like Duke Nukem forever.

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:48.380
You were entitled to like it.

01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:49.680
You were entitled to like it.

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:54.480
I personally think that it was, um, what's a good description?

01:12:54.480 --> 01:13:03.280
A festering pile of shit, but, um, I love 10 and 10 too.

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:04.280
I'm sorry.

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:07.320
Breakman says, stop talking about my low self esteem.

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:08.320
How dare you?

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:09.380
Wait, what are we talking about?

01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:14.240
It's just, I don't know what it is.

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:19.200
It's a big internet thing, definitely, but it's also a human thing for people to want

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:23.360
everyone to like the same things that they do or hate the same things that they do and

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:29.280
poopoo anybody else who doesn't think the way I do, dammit politics, which is a little

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:33.720
bit more important, but it's video games are the most important thing.

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:36.800
What are you talking about?

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:43.520
But it's at the same time as like, okay, fun, fun of fantasy 14.

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:47.300
They're looking at it as a failure fiscally.

01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:48.560
It's probably a failure for them.

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:51.340
It's probably pulling in just enough money to keep a couple of servers up.

01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:52.340
It is.

01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:55.640
It is a little bit unprecedented when it, no matter what your personal opinion is on

01:13:55.640 --> 01:14:00.000
14, if you think we're too hard on it or what it is, it is unprecedented for a game company

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.600
to come out and apologize for a game.

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:04.600
Yes.

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:07.360
And they are taking steps to fix it.

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:11.740
They clearly believe that there's something with that product that's worth salvaging.

01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:14.880
And for all the people out there, like what brought me to this point, regardless in that

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:20.760
say 13 was a failure fiscally, financially, I'm sorry, that's what I mean.

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:21.760
Was it a failure?

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:25.900
No, it made them buckets of money.

01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:30.880
Game guru in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, for example, I don't like F zero, but

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.480
I respect that it is a great game.

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:33.480
Just not a racing game.

01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:35.880
I like, well, you are entitled to your wrong opinion.

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:37.480
Shut up.

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:38.480
Now go sit in the corner.

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:39.520
Well, here's me.

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:42.440
I don't like strategy games.

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:44.320
Couldn't sit through Warcraft to play it.

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:46.040
Love World of Warcraft.

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:54.480
It's just the third time, fourth, fourth, fourth because I played with each expansion

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:55.960
until I liked it.

01:14:55.960 --> 01:15:02.360
Um, but I mean, I love the universe, hate the first series of games, you know, it's

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:05.280
just has to personal preference.

01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:09.340
I notoriously can't stand Final Fantasy eight and it's not the story that bothers me.

01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:10.340
It's fucking boring.

01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:11.880
It's that fucking fighting system ruined.

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:12.880
I know.

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:17.760
Well, I love the story so much by the time I got to the third disc, bore for reals, but

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:23.600
the whole point is, is that take personal opinion out of the equation and look at it

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:24.600
for what it is.

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:25.820
How much money did it make?

01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:28.240
How big of a player base does it have?

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:30.420
That determines in the terms.

01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:32.280
That's what the stockholders are looking at.

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:33.280
Exactly.

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:38.400
That determines right there if something is a failure as a product or not.

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:42.080
Now for everyone who bought Final Fantasy 13 and hate it, they still got the money.

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:43.080
They, they like it.

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:44.080
Sorry.

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:48.320
They still got your money at one and the story, but when you've got an ongoing product that

01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:53.200
people are going to play, play, pay a subscription for, that's a different story and for that

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:55.200
you have to deliver month after month.

01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:59.140
All right, well let's travel around the world and check out what possibly controversial

01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:01.320
new releases are coming out this week.

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:03.760
I don't really know if there's anything controversial, but we'll see.

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:07.800
Let's start in the U S Loki is going to be short.

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:11.720
There's fall of Cybertron, PS3 and 360.

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:12.720
That's it.

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:13.720
Dang.

01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:18.180
Well, we did just have a system launch today and a big Nintendo game, so it's not technically

01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:19.180
new system.

01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:23.480
It's about as new as like, say, you know, new Super Mario brothers two.

01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:25.780
There's some big PC games in a couple of weeks too.

01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:29.520
So that's, that's, that's that.

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:30.520
All right.

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:31.520
Uh, let's go to Japan.

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:36.080
Uh, Japan's looking a little bit empty this week as well on the Xbox 360 there is the

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:39.320
Witcher two assassins of Kings enhanced edition.

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:42.740
I don't know what's enhanced about that, but that's on the 360 this week.

01:16:42.740 --> 01:16:46.160
That's the only thing on the, um, 360 in Japan.

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:49.000
Otherwise on the PlayStation three, no more heroes.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.560
Red zone edition gets the best treatments.

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:53.200
That means a price reduction.

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:54.360
Also I don't know what this is.

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:55.760
It's a, a hybrid disc.

01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:58.000
I think this is a game and an anime.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:04.160
It's Rene no Lagrange, Kamogawa days, and it's the game and the anime.

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:05.160
Yeah.

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:06.160
Cool.

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:07.600
And that's kind of something we see on the PlayStation three happened a little bit is

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:11.960
that you have the game slash movie or whatever it was a PlayStation network game in the movie.

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:12.960
Yeah.

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:16.200
So, uh, seeing that a little bit more and more, the VITA has got a little bit going

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:17.240
on this week in Japan.

01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:19.040
We have next revolution.

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:20.260
There's a couple of different versions.

01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:25.360
There's talk and she can, and then Joe who a security specialist, she can, and then another

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:30.640
game coming out on the VITA as well called Tokushu Hodobu comes out.

01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:32.000
That is all on the 23rd of August.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.040
Now, I will say this next week, cause a lot of people are going to be excited about this

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.440
on the VITA.

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:40.560
Maybe dark soccer, even I don't have a VITA.

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:46.120
Maybe you'll have to go on for Hatsune Miku project diva F. You're not a project diva

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:47.120
fan.

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.120
I thought you were.

01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:49.360
I am, but I don't have a VITA.

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:50.360
So what does it matter?

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:56.000
Well, you can get in Japan on the 30th, you can get a VITA Hatsune Miku limited edition.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:02.720
Well, let the people who actually have jobs and money get one for me.

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:06.880
You should sell Etsy's to fund your VITA.

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:11.320
What the fuck would I make on Etsy?

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:12.320
Anger.

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:13.960
I'm selling my rage.

01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:18.560
You get an MP3 of me going fuck.

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:21.240
You can record people's voicemail messages.

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:24.020
Yeah, you could set up, you could set up their voicemail.

01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:25.600
Hi, this is dark soccer.

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:31.000

has ever talked about and I don't care

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:26.920
anymore

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:29.560
all right just a couple new stories away

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:32.120
from the classic game of the week and

01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:33.520
dark soccer picked an obscure one

01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:35.600
tonight I think I think super obscure

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:37.640
plays a little bit here it's a good game

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:39.800
I just need another copy of it sometimes

01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:42.560
it's about finding the hidden gems there

01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:43.920
you go all right first though a couple

01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:46.080
more stories for you guys Loki all right

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:49.520
so there was some announcements regarding

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:53.480
origin it's coming to Mac because you

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:55.600
know they have games on the Mac so of

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:58.120
course it would so of course Peter Moore

01:20:58.120 --> 01:20:59.840
announced that you know during gamescom

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:01.800
it's going to be coming to a few

01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:04.160
different platforms including smart TVs

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:08.560
the Mac Android and Facebook and they're

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:11.640
also going to be you know adding some

01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:13.520
new features including free-to-play

01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:15.960
gaming which is I think where the

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:19.080
Facebook and Android comes into play and

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:25.800
achievements hoorah hooray now you can

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:27.760
play broken games of Mass Effect 3 on

01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:29.520
the Mac I guess it doesn't necessarily

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:30.960
mean the games are coming out on those

01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:33.440
systems but origin will be there you

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:36.200
know origin cannot I this this boggles

01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:39.080
my mind if Alan and I want to play our

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:41.480
two friends at the same house in the Bay

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:44.040
Area we can't do it origin can't handle

01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:46.040
two people in one place versus two in

01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:48.280
another place we can do two on one or

01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:50.680
them two against what we can't do two

01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:52.720
on two it is not possible in origin

01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:58.000
setup really really I bet steam can

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.480
handle that it probably to be fair we

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:02.360
haven't tried but I don't see why it

01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:04.640
wouldn't work I've played some I I've

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:06.880
never really had a game that failed

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.520
miserably playing it through steam like

01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:10.840
I had a great sieve five match not that

01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:13.480
long ago borderlands is through game spy

01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:15.400
so that's a little different I don't I

01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:18.360
wouldn't measure that so whatever all

01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:21.560
right well speaking of underappreciated

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:24.920
classics the neo geo remember the neo

01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:26.880
geo yeah I've looked at one the other

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:28.680
day you've got one in your house right

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:31.160
to actually those others are expensive

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:32.960
have a neo geo and a neo see you know

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:35.080
how Dan got his neo geo huh he traded a

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:38.360
Sega CD for it wow well you might have

01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:40.000
to make room on the shelf for this it's

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.920
the neo geo X gold that's right it's a

01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:47.080
new system is in now there were rumors

01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:48.560
about this before that this is coming

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:51.200
but it is confirmed the neo geo X gold

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:56.880
is a thing it's a $200 thing hey neo

01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:58.320
geos were never known for being cheap

01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:01.040
right now the cool thing is though even

01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:02.600
for being a $200 system it does come

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:03.840
with a bunch of pre-installed games

01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:06.880
these games used to be like $200 apiece

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:10.280
if you remember such classics like art

01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:12.840
of fighting to magician Lord metal slug

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:15.560
baseball stars to fatal fury and fatal

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:18.480
fury special king of fighters 95 samurai

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:20.640
showdown 2 king of the monsters all this

01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:22.160
is built in so it's pretty those games

01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:23.920
already there's a lot of I mean and I'm

01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:25.560
only reading part of the list so there's

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:27.640
a good looks like about 20 games or so

01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:30.400
that are installed I noticed though I

01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:32.600
don't see bust a move on this list I

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:34.440
don't see or you know puzzle these

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:36.800
everyone to call these are all SNK games

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:39.080
that was tied oh good point good point

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:42.360
well anyhow there is also this I guess

01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:45.680
here's the weird thing it is a handheld

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:48.240
so it's like it's a handheld system but

01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:51.840
it's also I guess you can plug it into a

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:54.160
docking station and then it's a TV thing

01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:56.760
too that's kind of cool I got to say

01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:58.320
yeah it's a docking station that's a

01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:01.680
video out that's pretty cool that my

01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:04.800
dingoo does the same thing and was a

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:09.840
whole hell lot cheaper and yeah I I

01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:11.600
think it's kind of cool but I don't

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:13.280
$200 is a steep price to pay for

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:15.720
nostalgia especially you can purchase

01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:18.560
like one of those like 48 and 160 and

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:23.720
one neo geo used by the games on your

01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:26.120
geo arcade carts and get super gun for

01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:28.320
way fucking cheaper that I have a super

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:30.000
gun it's like an all-in-one card thing

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.560
that literally plugs into neo geo

01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:36.240
controllers it's pinned out for that and

01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:41.240
I have a 16 one cart so nope not gonna

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:45.600
buy yeah I don't know I this thing would

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:47.280
have to be really something special in

01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:48.520
order to get me to buy I will say though

01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:51.400
they the the little joystick they have

01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:53.880
with it is like a mock replica those you

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:55.440
know those things are rock-solid those

01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:57.120
controllers of the four buttons so it's

01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:59.320
it's a nice controller I will say that

01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:03.400
your love that I love them honestly

01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:05.640
made playing all these games because

01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:07.840
it's the arcade experience yeah I'll

01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:11.920
give it that that's pretty cool to

01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:13.600
register participation for this week's

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:15.680
episode of orange lounge radio on vog

01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:17.840
network comm use the passphrase

milkshake all right let's take it let's

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:23.680
take a trip back down memory lane to a

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:25.560
time when the neo geo was you know more

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:27.240
relevant although I do I don't you did

01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:28.840
not pick a neo geo game tonight did you

01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:31.360
I did not oh well that's okay we're

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.560
gonna go down the archives of classic

01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:35.080
gaming and dark soccer is going to jump

01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:36.680
into the vault and find a game that she

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:38.880
thinks hey even though you might not be

01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:41.040
able to find it you kids should play

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:43.560
this game right now dark soccer oh what

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.440
is the classic game of the week

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:48.360
troubleshooter anyone remember this

01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:55.160
game no it came out on the Sega Genesis

01:25:55.160 --> 01:26:00.520
it has awesome music play a little bit

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:03.680
you

01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:06.680
assassination

01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:11.680
anyway in Japan it was known as battle

01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:13.560
mania and it's a scrolling shooter by

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:18.440
Victor hi that came out in 1992 and the

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:20.920
only reason I really I had I can say I

01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:22.680
played this game is I had a friend who

01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:25.240
had a copy so just we'll leave that there

01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:27.840
because I didn't have a genesis when I

01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:32.240
was in high school and the game is a real

01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:34.440
basically just makes fun of itself the

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:36.600
whole time you play as a girl named

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:38.960
Madison who is a combat operative who

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:40.720
has to rescue a prince that has been

01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:43.120
taken hostage and she goes around with

01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:48.520
her partner crystal now basically you

01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:50.760
play as Madison and Chris was kind of

01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:53.560
attached to her but it's really way I

01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:56.640
can describe their positioning and

01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:59.400
crystal always points backwards but you

01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:02.720
can flip her to point in the front and

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:05.120
she's invulnerable to enemy fire the

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:08.360
only one who has the hitbox is Madison

01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:11.960
here playing as and crystal is only if

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:15.360
affected if Madison dies so basically

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:17.120
you have a special weapon that helps you

01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:19.640
during combat and like I said you can

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:21.800
flip back and forth we can flip your

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:23.320
partner back and forth that you are

01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:27.680
always facing to the right and you've

01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:29.240
got different power-ups and it's funny

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:32.200
when when you get a power-up she goes

01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:35.680
thank you like that and they make a

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:36.840
little noises when they get hurt and

01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:38.680
everything a little bubble comes up this

01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:41.920
is ouch it's so cute but it didn't

01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:44.680
really have like a life system you

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:46.840
stocked at hit points by getting life up

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:51.520
icons and now it often had a sequel in

01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:55.000
Japan called battle mania a diagonal now

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.920
we're going to move forward into what

01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:58.800
makes this game special and I'm talking

01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:04.000
more about battle mania is that it's

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:09.200
kind of slow-paced it has this sort of

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:11.120
like I said the weird play you know

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:15.040
playing style in it but basically Owen

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.400
in Japan they were called mania and

01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:20.280
Maria sorry they basically go down and

01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:24.880
shoot weird machines and it had some

01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:31.480
really fun stuff thrown in like they had

01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:34.880
an issue in the game now this was

01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:39.280
because the group they were working with

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:42.520
which which was a studio Uchuu Tetsujin

01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:44.920
which is also called studio space iron

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:47.960
man did not like that Victor Kai worked

01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:50.560
with Super Famicom so they had an

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:52.520
interesting little easter egg through

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:56.120
into the game where if you press start

01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:58.120
right and see on the second controller

01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:01.000
the two heroines in the game will shoot

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.200
past the Sega logo and you will see

01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:05.160
Madison jumping up and down on the Super

01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:09.640
Famicom just bounce bounce bounce bounce

01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:16.480
when the U.S. does what Nintendo yeah it's

01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:21.680
not in the English version so uh so

01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:26.640
basically as things went along this was

01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:28.120
you know going into the sequel the

01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:32.880
battle mania die angel it had mushrooms

01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:38.920
come out that were part of the power-ups

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:43.760
and it had a fleet of well guys it looked

01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:46.440
like Cape Mario that you had to shoot

01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:53.080
down there was also just a bunch of

01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:54.560
stuff that was going on with this it was

01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:58.160
and there's a an official picture that

01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:02.840
came out where it shows the girls

01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:07.880
playing volleyball with a super with a

01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:12.200
Super Famicom and a hammer and then in

01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:15.200
the game say gaga you remember that one

01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:17.200
right we have to basically you're trying

01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:20.840
to save Sega from financial ruin well

01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:22.320
they get helped in the end of the game

01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:23.640
by a bunch of characters from their

01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:28.760
games and outcome the two ladies from

01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:33.040
battle mania so definitely the game

01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:36.480
itself is definitely a big poop on

01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:39.720
Nintendo but also it's just really fun I

01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:42.560
mean it's a fun little shooter so this

01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:44.160
is a game that I would love to have a

01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:46.600
copy of either the u.s. one of the

01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:50.960
Japanese one so I would just be giddy if

01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:54.640
I had this game unfortunately I haven't

01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:57.800
seen it since I was in high school

01:30:57.800 --> 01:31:00.440

01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:04.600

Darksiders to soundtrack with the

01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:05.160
corruption you're participating with

01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:06.560
orange launch radio at the voice of

01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:10.840

470 I lost count for a minute there for

01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:22.280
this august 19th 2012 and that was

01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:25.160
awesome thanks again to something

01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:27.300
something music for letting us play that

01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:28.600
during the break there that was great

01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:32.700
again that was the corruption from the

01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:34.940
Darksiders to soundtrack by Jesper Kidd

01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:36.240
that was really cool hope you guys like

01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:38.000
that too I liked it yeah it's nice and

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.560
some folks in chat there dungeon buster

01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:43.160
says at live.vognetwork.com says I

01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:44.600
thought Kidd did a great job in the

01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:46.680
Darksiders to stuff there's a base theme

01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:48.560
in this that runs in this one that runs

01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:50.800
into other pieces so there you go so

01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:53.160
alright we're going to get back into the

01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:55.800
show with some rapid-fire news some

01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:58.200
quick news stories here and we'll start

01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:01.840
it off with Loki alright so the Vita is

01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:05.280
getting some new firmware soon version

01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:08.400
1.8 and this is kind of cool because one

01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:10.600
of the complaints about the Vita before

01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:13.520
were with the visually impaired having

01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:15.960
trouble accessing stuff on the Vita

01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:18.120
because there was no button controls on

01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:19.600
the home screen well that's going to

01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:22.020
change now that there will be button

01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:23.640
controls on the home screen ability use

01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:25.200
the directional pad and stuff to

01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:29.520
navigate those screens and no longer we

01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:31.640
have to use just the touchpad and then

01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:34.280
also they're going to add I guess some

01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:36.960
different options for video including

01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:40.000
fast rewind fast forward and variable

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.400
speeds also you can import playlists

01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:46.760
from PlayStation 3 or iTunes for playing

01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:49.520
music and the web browser now supports

01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:51.200
rear touch for scrolling and zooming

01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:56.120
also I guess there's going to be a new

01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:59.520
cross controller icon in the remote play

01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:02.320
for the cross controller supporting

01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:08.200
games and then other tweaks I'm sure so

01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:10.080
that's pretty cool and then black ops

01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:12.200
2 some more details came out during

01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:14.280
gamescom which actually makes me pretty

01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:17.320
excited about first things first they're

01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:20.440
going to be adding some new customization

01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:22.960
options as opposed to the way they've

01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:25.120
kind of done things for the last god I

01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:26.600
don't even know how many games as far as

01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:28.360
custom classes go you basically get you

01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:30.720
know primary weapon secondary weapon you

01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:33.440
know your three perks and you know a

01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:35.840
lethal grenade and support grenade and

01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:39.680
stuff like that killstreaks now it's

01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:41.760
going to basically be you get ten points

01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:43.320
you get to spend those ten points

01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:45.200
however you want so if you want to go in

01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:47.800
and say fuck it I want to run into with

01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:49.800
just a knife you can do that you can

01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:52.040
have like five perks or hey I want to

01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:55.240
have you know a ton of ammo and you know

01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:57.120
no perks or I want to have this and that

01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:59.000
you can change it however you want that's

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.480
kind of cool so that's something that

01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:02.680
they're adding in there also league play

01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:05.720
is going to be added in as well as the

01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:09.720
option to do live streams of your

01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:11.120
gameplay so you can have live streams

01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:14.200
and you can also do shoutcasts of like

01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:16.280
commentary so you can have commentary

01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:17.680
going over the whole thing as well that's

01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:19.440
built into the goddamn game that's

01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:21.640
interesting yes some people harnessing

01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:23.080
the types of things we see on like you

01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:24.480
stream and twitch TV and all that

01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:26.840
interesting yes so that's pretty cool and

01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:29.280
then there's also a rumor that black ops

01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:31.760
twos heading to the Wii U according to a

01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:36.720
QA testers resume who was on LinkedIn I'm

01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:38.000
just going to make it easy for you it's

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.320
not a fucking rumor it's coming on the

01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:41.200
wheel I mean I've been seeing it for

01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:43.560
weeks now so it is coming on the wheel I

01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:47.960
know because I've seen the UPC and other

01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:51.040
things but yes it duh I mean come on it's

01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:52.600
gonna be a simple port of the other

01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:55.160
games and you know Treyarch supports the

01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:57.880
Wii so why not come out well speaking of

01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:00.160
the Wii U spot pass is apparently going

01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:01.840
to be a feature of the Wii U this again

01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:04.360
really strikes me as a type of duh but

01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:05.600
it is going around the internet this

01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:07.200
week that I guess it's kind of the new

01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:09.480
version of Wii Connect 24 which you know

01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:11.520
remember that was a thing that your Wii

01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:13.120
was always on but it's not really it's

01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:15.560
not used as well as it could be spot

01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:17.760
pass a little better on the DS so

01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:19.200
hopefully they're gonna implement that

01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:20.360
more and more through the Nintendo

01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:22.680
platforms this is all coming from a

01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:24.960
photo of a Wii U development kit that

01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:26.280
the Wii U will have the spot pass

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:28.680
feature I mean come on of course and it

01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:31.200
if they're smart they'll do a lot of the

01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:33.520
stuff between the 3ds and the Wii U that

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:35.100
was happening between the DS and the Wii

01:41:35.100 --> 01:41:36.520
with the demos and so of course they're

01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:38.560
gonna have spot pass I mean it is a it

01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:43.520
is a DS right now on the TV screen

01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:46.280
essentially alright well other Nintendo

01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:48.200
news Team Ninja I remember they made

01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:50.720
Metroid other M which you know was kind

01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:52.520
of met with mixed mixed reaction not

01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:53.880
everybody was into it I thought it was

01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:55.600
pretty I thought it was pretty good but

01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:57.720
you know not nothing is yet to top Super

01:41:57.720 --> 01:41:59.240
Metroid for me you know nothing's even

01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:00.840
really come close honestly what about a

01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:05.420
fusion um close but still doesn't top it

01:42:05.420 --> 01:42:07.560
the closest thing I would say would be

01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:10.240
the Metroid zero zero mission was

01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:11.160
probably the close that's what I'm

01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:12.040
thinking of how's on the Game Boy

01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:14.880
Advance you were thinking of the other

01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:16.920
Game Boy Advance one was Metroid fusion

01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:21.120
ah anyway team ninjas yosuke hayashi

01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:23.200
says that they are still close to

01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:24.840
Nintendo and the designer Yoshio

01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:27.000
Sakamoto apparently they are both

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.880
director they were both directors of

01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:31.400
Metroid other M on the Wii and according

01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:34.100
to Hayashi team ninja wants to work with

01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:36.520
Nintendo on another Metroid title here's

01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:38.920
a quote unfortunately Metroid is kind of

01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:41.560
out of our meaning team ninjas league as

01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:43.360
it's Nintendo's game but we're still in

01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:44.920
close touch with so co-creator

01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:46.840
Sakamoto-san so we want to do something

01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:48.680
with him moving forward definitely it

01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:50.200
really depends on what he wants to do

01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:52.440
with the game first so you know kind of

01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:54.800
like a peace offering there I mean but

01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:56.520
again at the end of the day if Metroid

01:42:56.520 --> 01:42:57.840
other M didn't sell which I don't

01:42:57.840 --> 01:42:59.720
believe it did sell up to expectations I

01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:01.560
don't know what the future is going to

01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:03.400
hold for Metroid but I can't they

01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:04.720
totally screwed up with Samus in that

01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:06.720
game I I wouldn't believe though that

01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:08.320
they would just let Metroid go away but

01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:09.760
then again stranger things have happened

01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:13.880
I hope not I hope not the full track

01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:16.840
list for just dance for coming out on

01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:19.920

because you know they had the first

01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:49.500

01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:02.200

grandmother George decay is my gay daddy

01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:55.400
I haven't decided who my other gay daddy

01:50:55.400 --> 01:51:01.160
is all right let's move on with more

01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:05.840
rapid-fire news dark Sakura well um

01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:08.760
we've got a fan project that's called

01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:12.400
Megaman day in the limelight to sorry

01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:14.640
there's apparently a sequel it's done by

01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:16.000
the people that did mushroom kingdom

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:17.920
fusion it's a rearranged version of

01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:21.960
Megaman 3 but instead of playing what

01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:24.760
tiger class as searching for car alarm

01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:54.680
dubstep I found this okay so anyway

01:51:54.680 --> 01:51:56.560
you play through on the stages of Megaman

01:51:56.560 --> 01:51:58.640
3 but you play as the robot masters for

01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:01.920
Megaman 2 so it looks like it's pretty

01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:03.440
fun and I think I'm going to be grabbing

01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:10.280
this no thank you let's not fuck Rob the

01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:12.920

01:52:12.920 --> 01:52:15.120
chatters it was tiger claw it's all

01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:18.680

man nana nana nana with extra n versus

01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:29.520
machine so it's six players against

01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:31.800
doppelgangers so you have to fight the

01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:34.000
robot versions of them and you get

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:39.000
incredible loot it's not as cool as fog

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.600
loot no and then last but never least

01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:45.600
steam the big picture mode is going to

01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:48.220
launch in beta in September so you can

01:52:48.220 --> 01:52:52.520
basically play steam on your TV but not

01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:57.640

remember there's an accessory in

01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:28.560
Borderlands that allows you to make a

01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:30.760
sniper rifle that sets enemies on fire

01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:32.800
seeing people flare up and run around

01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:34.880
from a great distance always put a smile

01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:38.720

himself says the red shell in Mario Kart

01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:57.280
unless it's aimed at me let's see Ben R

01:54:57.280 --> 01:54:59.280
says the mushroom in Mario Kart where

01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:01.160
you can just jam the item button as much

01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:02.520
as possible for a certain amount of

01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:04.240
seconds and keep boosting the golden

01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:07.680
mushroom Matt J says I always love the

01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:10.040
grappling hook from Super Metroid and

01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:12.520
later in Metroid Prime I felt like a

01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:14.640
total badass swinging back and forth on

01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:17.360
those hooks the space jump comes in as a

01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:19.200
close second though mostly because the

01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:23.200
animation looking cool Nick Nick M says

01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:25.520
the gravity gun from half-life 2 was

used the collector rifle use it and

01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:36.080
you'll never use anything else there was

01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:41.080
oh in the issue of Fornax um as far as

01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:44.640
others that I really really like I like

01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:49.040
the bells in Proteus that I like the

01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:51.720
word blaster where I have no idea what

01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:53.280
it's saying I can only read like some of

01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:55.240
it but it's like I don't know what you're

01:57:55.240 --> 01:57:57.840
saying but die I love I love the

01:57:57.840 --> 01:58:04.160
Proteus power-ups a whole bunch and oh

01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:07.160
yeah cotton where she gets the willow

01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:10.160
she goes we know just I just like it

01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:13.880
because that's all she says so Loki um

01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:17.120
well there's a few I have some actually

01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:18.680
from games I haven't played a couple

01:58:18.680 --> 01:58:20.880
from red faction they had mr. toots which

01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:23.560
was a unicorn that fired rainbows out of

01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:26.200
its ass that amazing it was a weapon in

01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:28.720
the game oh there was that showed up in

01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:31.320
like videos online too right yeah they

01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:33.160
did a viral video Freddie Wong I remember

01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:34.240
you covering that yeah I was a Freddie

01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:36.640
Wong thing yeah anyways then the ostrich

01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:39.920
hammer from red faction also and then

01:58:39.920 --> 01:58:43.000
for stuff that I actually have played

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:46.920
fuzzy from you know Super Mario World 2

01:58:46.920 --> 01:58:49.280
that wasn't really a power-up but that's

01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:51.160
actually a good answer I like that

01:58:51.160 --> 01:58:54.720
memorable and then actually a sort of a

01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:59.000
power-up from it was actually in a bunch

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.120
of Capcom games but like one I remember

01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:02.880
is Captain Commando where you would hop

01:59:02.880 --> 01:59:05.360
into like the mechs and like you know

01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:07.600
punch and blow things up and catch

01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:10.080
things on fire remember how all the old

01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:12.320
Capcom games had that little symbol that

01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:13.640
like showed up in every game that was

01:59:13.640 --> 01:59:15.160
always like an uber power-up like it was

01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:16.480
in every game I can't remember what was

01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:18.200
called you remember that little symbol

01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:22.640
like a little mm-hmm somebody I do

01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:24.440
also they'll have to second the purple

01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:26.000
laser and riding because it's always

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.280
what I use was a purple laser anything

01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:30.480
else lucky that's it oh there's one more

01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:34.240
I can add huh actually your your shield

01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:39.000
thing in our type the added on option

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:40.200
that you could shoot either from your

01:59:40.200 --> 01:59:42.760
butt or from the front that was always a

01:59:42.760 --> 01:59:45.840
cool thing I'm gonna go super duper old

01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:47.680
school I think one of the best power-ups

01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:49.520
ever was the hammer in Donkey Kong

01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:53.600
because the little song the little

01:59:53.600 --> 01:59:55.040
animation of the hammer going up and

01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:57.040
down was really funny to me so I always

01:59:57.040 --> 01:59:58.400
love the hammer in the original Donkey

01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:01.280
Kong and then the power brick in Mario

02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:03.800
Brothers because I love I'm not talking

02:00:03.800 --> 02:00:05.000
Super Mario Brothers but an old-school

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:06.720
Mario Brothers I loved that game I still

02:00:06.720 --> 02:00:09.080
do it's one of my favorite like everyone

02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:11.040
that's one of it yeah you just knock

02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:12.680
everyone on their ass and it was it is

02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:14.120
cool to the power bricks kind of come

02:00:14.120 --> 02:00:15.720
back in the later Mario would be awesome

02:00:15.720 --> 02:00:17.800
hmm is you know how we have Smash

02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:19.680
Brothers guess Smash Brothers of old

02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:22.280
retro arcade games like all that would

02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:23.840
be those characters that would be very

02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:27.400
cool I slightly old-school but like the

02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:28.600
first thing that came to my mind

02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:32.000
honestly the ripple gun from life force

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:35.000
yes that was the best one I love that

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:36.600
power-up like sometimes I even though

02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:38.000
it wasn't that great of a gun like I

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:39.680
would get it just cuz it's cool I'm team

02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:41.720
laser over here and exactly the laser

02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:43.640
was the the more effective power-up at

02:00:43.640 --> 02:00:45.880
the ripple was just cool and I really

02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:48.440
think the best power-up like ever were

02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:50.520
the options in the Gradius games in any

02:00:50.520 --> 02:00:52.840
of those option yeah those are great

02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:54.560
power-ups you have too much speed up

02:00:54.560 --> 02:00:56.800
though and you'd be dead right um you

02:00:56.800 --> 02:00:58.520
know well another one actually since I

02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:01.080
mentioned our type is the I don't know

02:01:01.080 --> 02:01:02.280
if it's called the ripple gun in our

02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:04.480
type but it's like a dual red and blue

02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:07.400
that forms this big swirl as it goes

02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:08.920
across you've got or something yeah some

02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:10.160
kind of wave gun but that's just thought

02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:12.160
that one was pretty triggers in our

02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:13.920
chat room says a street can I don't know

02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:15.240
if that was the name of it that thing

02:01:15.240 --> 02:01:18.240
I'm trying to think of where that's a

02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:20.120
capcom thing that was in the like it

02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:22.360
was in 1942 and it was in bionic commando

02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:26.480
and which um one other one I would name

02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:28.680
power-up that was awesome you know I'm

02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:30.560
gonna go to Super Metroid right I'm

02:01:30.560 --> 02:01:32.480
gonna say the very end of the game when

02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:34.240
you have that laser that just blows

02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:35.600
through everything like the rainbow

02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:36.880
laser that just cuts through everything

02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:38.440
there was just something really epic

02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:40.000
about that moment when you had that beam

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:41.600
as you were fighting mother brain and

02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:43.240
there's awesome there is one other thing

02:01:43.240 --> 02:01:45.320
okay I know it's a game I've actually

02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:48.200

pretty cool yeah even even in general

02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:36.160
the hadoken kind of changed gaming in a

02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:37.280
way like I don't know if you'd call that

02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:40.040
a power-up so much as a power move but

02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:42.280
think about it reuse fireball in

02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:45.000

following people are trying to go pro

02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:38.680
and win a million dollars in a

02:03:38.680 --> 02:03:40.800
tournament it makes sense things are

02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:42.320
going this way when that whole indie

02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:44.360
game the movie did I'm assuming it did

02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:46.280
fairly well on steam I saw people

02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:47.920
talking about it and I would imagine

02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:50.080
they did sort of have a documentary in

02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:54.400
iPad form with the portal to the final

02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:56.240
days oh yeah did it wasn't wasn't that

02:03:56.240 --> 02:03:58.000
like a contracted thing though where

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.160
yeah because like Jeff Keeley put that

02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:01.800
all together at least supervised it I'm

02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:03.600
sure he didn't do it all himself but you

02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:05.800
know supervised that whole thing where

02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:07.240
yeah because they did they did the

02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:09.200
portal but wasn't there one that was the

02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:12.040
last days of all there was another game

02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:15.400
that had one was it another valve game

02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:16.800
actually didn't they do one for Mass

02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:19.720
Effect 3 they did they did do last days

02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:21.440
of Mass Effect 3 and last days of portal

02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:22.760
and I there was one other I don't care I

02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:24.440
just want to see an animated team

02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:26.520
fortress 2 movie that would be fucking

02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:28.880
amazing fans can make them now well I

02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:31.280
didn't market them through steam it'd be

02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:34.360
crazy I still want to see if let's see a

02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:36.160
future-length animated movie because

02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:38.120
their shit is pretty awesome well there

02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:40.920
you got record Ralph coming I doubt team

02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:43.440
fortress characters are in it but they

02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:47.760
should be why not all right moving on to

02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:49.440
Nintendo I reference this a little bit

02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:51.560
earlier in the show but I wanted to go

02:04:51.560 --> 02:04:52.720
into depth on this a little bit because

02:04:52.720 --> 02:04:54.120
I'm sure Loki will have an opinion on

02:04:54.120 --> 02:04:56.520
this Nintendo is promising that their

02:04:56.520 --> 02:04:59.680
DLC will not leave users feel cheated

02:04:59.680 --> 02:05:02.560
or deceived this is a crew according to

02:05:02.560 --> 02:05:04.360
Satoru Iwata of course is Nintendo

02:05:04.360 --> 02:05:06.040
present the president of Nintendo

02:05:06.040 --> 02:05:07.600
because you know Nintendo is just now

02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:12.120
getting into DLC what it's 2012 and DLC

02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:13.600
has been prevalent since what about oh

02:05:13.600 --> 02:05:15.280
six oh seven when well they're just now

02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:18.160
getting an HD to some mean Nintendo is

02:05:18.160 --> 02:05:21.320
finally getting into DLC and here's what

02:05:21.320 --> 02:05:23.640
they said and one thing into excuse me

02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:25.440
what he said and one thing Nintendo is

02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:27.640
determined as a company policy what we

02:05:27.640 --> 02:05:29.360
are not going to do is create a full

02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:31.200
game and then say let's hold this back

02:05:31.200 --> 02:05:34.160
for DLC that's not our plan we're

02:05:34.160 --> 02:05:35.920
definitely not doing that it's an

02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:37.600
extreme example but I think there are

02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:39.240
examples of games where you get that

02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:41.600
initial purchase the very core part of

02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:43.440
the game and everything else around it

02:05:43.440 --> 02:05:45.120
is all DLC that's all a matter of

02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:46.920
opinion that's some subtle Capcom

02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:49.120
shading that that's all that well that

02:05:49.120 --> 02:05:50.760
is but that's also a matter of opinion

02:05:50.760 --> 02:05:52.280
because Capcom I'm sure in their defense

02:05:52.280 --> 02:05:54.420
would say that Street Fighter cross

02:05:54.420 --> 02:05:56.040
Tekken was a full game and that these

02:05:56.040 --> 02:05:58.160
additional characters are you know that

02:05:58.160 --> 02:05:59.800
just that they're additional but the

02:05:59.800 --> 02:06:01.200
rest of the internet called them out on

02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:03.160
that bullshit yeah it's on it's on disk

02:06:03.160 --> 02:06:05.320
it's paid unlock content and there's

02:06:05.320 --> 02:06:06.880
even like there's one story I didn't

02:06:06.880 --> 02:06:09.160
talk about it was sleeping dogs how they

02:06:09.160 --> 02:06:10.600
oh yeah we have six months planned of

02:06:10.600 --> 02:06:13.080
DLC it's all paid unlock stuff but to be

02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:15.640
fair that is a game where you don't

02:06:15.640 --> 02:06:17.160
really need that stuff it's just

02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:19.320
costumes and I don't think there's any

02:06:19.320 --> 02:06:21.280
additional missions or maybe but it's

02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:23.200
mostly costumes one quick other

02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:25.000
statement here so our goal is to create

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.040
DLC in such a way the consumers do not

02:06:27.040 --> 02:06:28.720
feel they have been cheated or deceived

02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:30.400
now I believe there are people out there

02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:33.400
readers who have are worried about that

02:06:33.400 --> 02:06:34.880
I think it's a weird translation there

02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:36.640
and we just want to ensure them that we

02:06:36.640 --> 02:06:38.640
have in mind and want them to know that

02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:41.280
that's not what we are planning on doing

02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:44.080
so Nintendo planning and doing are two

02:06:44.080 --> 02:06:47.400
different things we're not sorry I'm

02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:51.440
doing it but you know it well you know

02:06:51.440 --> 02:06:53.200
it's not just a water that said this

02:06:53.200 --> 02:06:54.960
because I remember distinctly in that

02:06:54.960 --> 02:06:56.920
3ds little press conference thing not

02:06:56.920 --> 02:06:58.320
the one for me three but the one that

02:06:58.320 --> 02:06:59.680
came out a little later where they

02:06:59.680 --> 02:07:01.120
spotlighted the games again it was like

02:07:01.120 --> 02:07:02.560
a one of those Nintendo Direct things

02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:03.880
that had Reggie and some of those guys

02:07:03.880 --> 02:07:07.320
from Nintendo in it he specifically said

02:07:07.320 --> 02:07:10.320
we're gonna have DLC for New Super Mario

02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:11.520
Brothers 2 but I want to assure

02:07:11.520 --> 02:07:14.960
everybody it's additional content we

02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:16.800
have a finished game first I mean they

02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:18.200
they really went out of their way to

02:07:18.200 --> 02:07:21.840
stress it's not something like that

02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:23.520
you're gonna have to have it is truly

02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:25.200
something extra the designers are

02:07:25.200 --> 02:07:29.760
working on we'll see what do you think

02:07:29.760 --> 02:07:32.360
Nintendo DLC I don't really know what

02:07:32.360 --> 02:07:33.560
the thing yeah cuz we haven't seen any

02:07:33.560 --> 02:07:36.440
examples yet I just think that New Super

02:07:36.440 --> 02:07:37.560
Mario Bros 2 is gonna be the first

02:07:37.560 --> 02:07:41.480
example of first party DLC anyway I just

02:07:41.480 --> 02:07:43.440
don't know if it's gonna I mean I would

02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:45.840
be I was always hoping that like you

02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:48.960
know excite truck you know hey all we

02:07:48.960 --> 02:07:50.800
need is DLC with new levels that's it

02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:54.680
just add new levels in I'll be happy of

02:07:54.680 --> 02:07:56.080
course that never happened and then we

02:07:56.080 --> 02:07:58.520
got a crappy sequel but you know the

02:07:58.520 --> 02:08:00.240
Mario Kart same thing people with that

02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:02.280
just add new level my problem with Mario

02:08:02.280 --> 02:08:04.440
Kart and this has been the case with it

02:08:04.440 --> 02:08:06.560
will be all old levels a lot of yes

02:08:06.560 --> 02:08:09.280
seriously that's the thing is you've

02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:11.280
released these old levels in every

02:08:11.280 --> 02:08:13.320
single Mario Kart it was cool the first

02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:14.560
time that you did it it's like hey

02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:16.320
that's kind of neat you know this this

02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:19.120
old Mario Kart levels in 3d now or it's

02:08:19.120 --> 02:08:21.320
in like you know the polygons and stuff

02:08:21.320 --> 02:08:24.200
now it's getting a little old it's it's

02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:27.040
getting a little tiresome just maybe do

02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:28.500
a Mario Kart game that didn't have the

02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:31.440
old tracks in it just a thought maybe

02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:34.080
instead of coming out with four circuits

02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:36.480
you just don't have the retro search I

02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:38.200
don't mind I don't mind the half half

02:08:38.200 --> 02:08:40.120
new half returning stuff I don't mind it

02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:42.040
but it's for me here it is it's all

02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:44.340
about this the price is right it is all

02:08:44.340 --> 02:08:46.760
about the cost because like what do you

02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:48.400
think would be a fair price to charge

02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:51.360
for let's say Nintendo were to put out

02:08:51.360 --> 02:08:53.880
five new tracks like a new circuit of

02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:56.120
five new tracks what would that be worth

02:08:56.120 --> 02:08:57.920
to you as DLC what would you pay for

02:08:57.920 --> 02:08:59.520
that depends what sir I mean if it's old

02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:01.440
really say all new let's say it's all new

02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:05.320
I'd say like five bucks really yeah I

02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:06.960
wouldn't want to see it more than $2.99

02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:08.960
maybe I'm just a few really good tracks

02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:10.880
it just it would all depend on me you

02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:14.480
know but or like Mario Mario 2 coin rush

02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:16.440
levels three stages that I wouldn't buy

02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:18.320
yeah I don't know I don't know like it's

02:09:18.320 --> 02:09:20.640
really about the price is Nintendo gonna

02:09:20.640 --> 02:09:24.620
get the price right I don't know we'll

02:09:24.620 --> 02:09:26.760
see

02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:29.080
chiggers in our chat room at live dog

02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:31.040
network com says Mario Kart level editor

02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:33.440
and share please but then they wouldn't

02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:34.840
be able to charge you for DLC if they do

02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:37.800
that they have a Mario Kart level editor

02:09:37.800 --> 02:09:40.560
now on the Wii and there is some not

02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:42.340
official though is it now but there's

02:09:42.340 --> 02:09:43.840
some way you can do it with SD cards

02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:45.280
where you can load custom tracks on

02:09:45.280 --> 02:09:48.920
there same with the 3ds or not the 3ds

02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:51.400
yeah was it New Super Mario Rose on the

02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:52.700
Wii same thing with that you can do

02:09:52.700 --> 02:09:54.700
custom levels in that somehow I should

02:09:54.700 --> 02:09:57.120
say this though you know because some

02:09:57.120 --> 02:09:59.240
people say well if Mario Kart added that

02:09:59.240 --> 02:10:00.500
in then they wouldn't be able to sell

02:10:00.500 --> 02:10:02.600
DLC not necessarily the case look at

02:10:02.600 --> 02:10:03.860
something like little big planet does

02:10:03.860 --> 02:10:05.600
this very well you know big planet does

02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:08.560
great that reminds me there was a ROM

02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:10.720
hack for New Super Mario Brothers on the

02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:12.960
DS that was New Super Mario Bros 3 and

02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:14.680
it had a lot of really cool levels and

02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:16.560
stuff in it that would be kind of cool

02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:18.040
to compare that to the New Super Mario

02:10:18.040 --> 02:10:23.680
Brothers 2 now to see you know how you

02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:26.720
know how better one is than the other

02:10:26.720 --> 02:10:28.400
because I think that one had some really

02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:30.560
unique ideas that they do with it I

02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:32.920
don't know if we're gonna see that in a

02:10:32.920 --> 02:10:34.480
level design you know I don't know if a

02:10:34.480 --> 02:10:35.840
lot of those people are thinking that

02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:38.160
far outside the box like some of the ROM

02:10:38.160 --> 02:10:41.880
hackers do we shall see let's move on

02:10:41.880 --> 02:10:44.440
for now Dark Sakura with some more news

02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:48.580
well we do have something else from

02:10:48.580 --> 02:10:51.920
valve well I'm sure you're familiar with

02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:54.160
the perpetual testing initiative that

02:10:54.160 --> 02:10:56.800
was the in-game portal to editor I play

02:10:56.800 --> 02:10:58.000
a few other things someone's actually

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.720
even gone and tried to recreate the

02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:03.360
entire first portal using nothing but at

02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:05.160
least the puzzles and everything using

02:11:05.160 --> 02:11:08.560
nothing but the in-game editor well now

02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:10.880
they have a patch that's going to be an

02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:14.320
update for that to let you do co-op that

02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:17.240
the co-op test chambers and you also

02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:19.400
have another option that's a quick play

02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:21.520
feature so that you can see the top

02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:25.400
rated user maps for each category it's

02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:27.640
gonna like I said free and it's also

02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:31.440
gonna come with a 75% off portal to

02:11:31.440 --> 02:11:33.440
vouchers that you can share the game

02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:37.640
with friend not bad huh no it's not bad

02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:41.880
at all I love you steam I love you so I

02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:44.700
can get a friend portal to whether they

02:11:44.700 --> 02:11:47.960
want it or not they want it they want it

02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:49.640
who wouldn't want portal to it's great I

02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:50.920
would think everybody should have it by

02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:53.560
now with all them steam sales I know

02:11:53.560 --> 02:11:57.640
right so this is kind of shocking during

02:11:57.640 --> 02:12:01.440
gamescom apparently some early builds of

02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:04.280
the game divinity were stolen out of the

02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:06.760
booth they literally picked up pcs and

02:12:06.760 --> 02:12:10.200
ran out of the building and somehow not

02:12:10.200 --> 02:12:14.960
didn't get caught how does that trend

02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:16.880
because how does that even happen we've

02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:18.280
heard about this happening at PAX and

02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:21.040
everything it's like I could see I could

02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:22.560
see it like if it was for whatever

02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:25.760
reason on like a a disc or something you

02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:27.200
know popping the disc out point in your

02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:28.880
pocket and run out of the well something

02:12:28.880 --> 02:12:29.920
like that happened at the last packs

02:12:29.920 --> 02:12:31.480
didn't it do we do we report on that or

02:12:31.480 --> 02:12:33.440
somebody had got it on like copied it to

02:12:33.440 --> 02:12:35.600
a USB drive or something and ran yeah I

02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:38.400
was it was I forget what game was but

02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:41.800
yeah I do remember that hmm but anyways

02:12:41.800 --> 02:12:45.160
so apparently the two games divinity

02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:47.640
dragon commander and divinity original

02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:51.400
sin have been stolen from Larry learning

02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:54.960
studios and they've actually posted a

02:12:54.960 --> 02:12:58.080
reward of $5,000 for anybody that can

02:12:58.080 --> 02:13:02.240
you know point fingers at who took them

02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:05.240
it was breach was the game that was

02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:11.480
stolen at PAX oh I'm sorry yeah it's just

02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:15.480
weird I'm surprised apparently you know

02:13:15.480 --> 02:13:17.280
they were using backup PC so there's no

02:13:17.280 --> 02:13:19.040
issues with new actual code being so

02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:20.680
yeah only make sense you back up that

02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:23.120
stuff is the only copy of the code that

02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:24.640
we have here yeah wouldn't be too ah

02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:28.280
shit but still still shitty that they

02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:30.840
have to you know plan that well I mean

02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:32.600
I mean back which is but it's shitty if

02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:34.040
somebody stole in the first place shit I

02:13:34.040 --> 02:13:35.720
mean come on it's gotta be on security

02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:37.720
cameras you're gonna notice someone hug

02:13:37.720 --> 02:13:41.000
you know how do you not notice first I

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:44.080
do it's a PC don't they have to like

02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:46.760
unplug a bunch of shit and you know pull

02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:48.080
it out of there and I mean you're

02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:50.880
hauling this giant PC with you I mean

02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:52.760
doesn't that look at a little bit

02:13:52.760 --> 02:13:54.760
suspicious I mean when somebody going

02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:57.480
through the car going hey why is that

02:13:57.480 --> 02:13:59.720
guy got a PC with him I mean that that

02:13:59.720 --> 02:14:01.680
seems a little suspicious to me game

02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:02.960
grew in our chat room with the

02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:05.080
inappropriate joke guest appearance by

02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:09.320
Carmen San Diego yeah yeah when whomp

02:14:09.320 --> 02:14:13.600
whomp all right let's move on one more

02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:15.000
story before the mailbag for you guys

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.040
this is also out of Gamescom something a

02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:20.280
little better than stolen things a little

02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:22.680
seminar about how to pitch your indie

02:14:22.680 --> 02:14:24.560
game to Sony oh excuse me this is not

02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:26.160
excuse me this is not out of Gamescom

02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:29.360
but close it's another Europe convention

02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:31.320
I sound like such an ignorant American

02:14:31.320 --> 02:14:32.960
right now my apologies it's game

02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:34.960
developers conference Europe GDC Europe

02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:36.800
also happened last week you may or not

02:14:36.800 --> 02:14:39.720
have heard but yeah there was a seminar

02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:42.440
by Pete Smith who is the Sony cross dev

02:14:42.440 --> 02:14:44.880
director of product development talking

02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:47.240
about basically what you should and you

02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:50.000
shouldn't do when you pitch your indie

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.920
game he said quote I'm sick of sitting

02:14:52.920 --> 02:14:56.240
through crap development pitches hmm

02:14:56.240 --> 02:15:00.200
dark soccer let's play a game word let's

02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:01.920
see if you can guess what would be some

02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:03.760
of the do's and some of the don'ts if

02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:06.280
you're gonna pitch your indie game what

02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:07.640
are some of the do's and some of the

02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:11.160
don'ts what would be your guess Loki if

02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:12.320
you haven't spoiled this for yourself

02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:15.000
already you can play too well no cheating

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.240
what to do when you're pitching it and

02:15:17.240 --> 02:15:18.920
what not to do yeah what would you do to

02:15:18.920 --> 02:15:20.480
pitch it and what what's what makes a

02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:21.600
good pitch and what doesn't make a good

02:15:21.600 --> 02:15:23.960
pitch well with a good pitch you want to

02:15:23.960 --> 02:15:25.400
definitely have some presentation

02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:28.360
materials like concept art something

02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:30.560
that's gonna be solid you want to have

02:15:30.560 --> 02:15:32.880
something well written out spelled

02:15:32.880 --> 02:15:37.080
correctly ding ding ding we have have

02:15:37.080 --> 02:15:39.640
assets this these include a one-page

02:15:39.640 --> 02:15:41.640
overview screenshots or video all on a

02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:43.240
USB stick for the publisher to keep

02:15:43.240 --> 02:15:45.840
don't waste time or money on swag good

02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:50.560
yeah I mean it's nice to have something

02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:52.160
kind of neat to throw in it but no one's

02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:54.040
gonna invest any money if they don't

02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:57.320
have at least an appetizer instead of

02:15:57.320 --> 02:15:58.680
the meat and potatoes you know they need

02:15:58.680 --> 02:16:02.000
to see what the vision is need to have a

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.880
projection need to see you know have a

02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:06.680
financial comparison to see if there's

02:16:06.680 --> 02:16:08.840
other games of a similar genre what

02:16:08.840 --> 02:16:10.520
they're making money with and how this

02:16:10.520 --> 02:16:12.040
is going to compare to them you know

02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:14.920
financial presentation what not to do is

02:16:14.920 --> 02:16:16.280
just say oh I've got an idea for a game

02:16:16.280 --> 02:16:20.600
we give me money not to harass them with

02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:23.480
phone calls you send the first email you

02:16:23.480 --> 02:16:25.520
send them the test product you send a

02:16:25.520 --> 02:16:29.040
follow-up you wait for a response you

02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:30.360
know those aren't neither one that's not

02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:32.200
really on the list per se but I still

02:16:32.200 --> 02:16:33.640
think that's good advice I don't think

02:16:33.640 --> 02:16:36.600
that's necessarily wrong similar answers

02:16:36.600 --> 02:16:38.480
are there Loki did you cheat I didn't

02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:40.640
cheat all right what would you guess a

02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:47.000
pitch features tits and ass I you know

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.040
what I will give that credit because on

02:16:49.040 --> 02:16:52.960
the do not list is be boring so certainly

02:16:52.960 --> 02:16:55.720
that is the opposite of boring be boring

02:16:55.720 --> 02:16:59.600
is on the do not list I don't think that

02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:02.520
they want it try to stay away from like

02:17:02.520 --> 02:17:05.360
graphs and charts maybe I'll make more

02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:08.240
just quick summaries of like here's

02:17:08.240 --> 02:17:10.800
here's my story here's you know the

02:17:10.800 --> 02:17:12.960
concept that type of thing again the

02:17:12.960 --> 02:17:15.440
opposite is true so D need that on the

02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:17.360
do list keep your visuals simple and

02:17:17.360 --> 02:17:21.040
bold basically so yeah so any house on

02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:24.280
the do list know what your game is be

02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:26.920
able to pitch it in 30 seconds yeah keep

02:17:26.920 --> 02:17:28.720
your visuals simple and bold you don't

02:17:28.720 --> 02:17:30.480
have to you want it you want to show off

02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:33.080
gameplay not graphics exactly you want

02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:37.440
to be succinct research focus don't ask

02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:42.280
them what a Vita is really if you're

02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:44.040
gonna pitch to Sony don't ask them what

02:17:44.040 --> 02:17:46.520
a Vita is really really I have something

02:17:46.520 --> 02:17:51.240
for your Vita system I have a vital game

02:17:51.240 --> 02:17:53.320
for the Vita well actually there's

02:17:53.320 --> 02:17:54.680
something else that occurred to me and I

02:17:54.680 --> 02:17:56.920
didn't look look at your screen that's

02:17:56.920 --> 02:17:59.240
haven't seen anything sure you want to

02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:01.160
make sure that the person making the

02:18:01.160 --> 02:18:03.280
pitch knows how to speak in front of

02:18:03.280 --> 02:18:07.600
people and then enunciate mm-hmm and has

02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:10.400
presence practice your pitch and choose

02:18:10.400 --> 02:18:13.560
the right person yeah or both there for

02:18:13.560 --> 02:18:15.440
real huh practice your pitch and choose

02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:17.360
the right person for the pitch someone

02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:19.000
who can talk about the game to a room of

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.640
suits with ease exactly and who the

02:18:21.640 --> 02:18:23.120
average person does not know corporate

02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:25.360
speak sorry let's see also on the list

02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:28.240
here be able to adapt because some games

02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:30.760
often don't end up what their pitch

02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:34.040
manage your expectations Sony isn't

02:18:34.040 --> 02:18:35.680
gonna back a game unless it benefits them

02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:37.720
as well as you so be prepared to

02:18:37.720 --> 02:18:40.080
negotiate that IP I think that's a very

02:18:40.080 --> 02:18:42.760
realistic answer there let's see I think

02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:43.880
we hit on some of these other sell

02:18:43.880 --> 02:18:45.840
yourself as a company and as individuals

02:18:45.840 --> 02:18:47.280
I think that's very interesting because

02:18:47.280 --> 02:18:49.400
they say that you have to be able to

02:18:49.400 --> 02:18:52.280
work with the people not just the idea

02:18:52.280 --> 02:18:55.480
very interesting they say media molecule

02:18:55.480 --> 02:18:57.480
was a great example of this Sony wanted

02:18:57.480 --> 02:18:59.360
to work with the people they followed

02:18:59.360 --> 02:19:00.800
through media molecule probably brought

02:19:00.800 --> 02:19:02.360
us one of the greatest Sony games ever

02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:06.320
period little big planet show passion if

02:19:06.320 --> 02:19:11.400
you don't care why will they hi I'm Ben

02:19:11.400 --> 02:19:13.880
Stein and here's my game all right

02:19:13.880 --> 02:19:15.240
lastly on the do not list then we'll

02:19:15.240 --> 02:19:18.320
move on don't be boring don't bitch and

02:19:18.320 --> 02:19:20.120
whine about other developers or

02:19:20.120 --> 02:19:22.200
publishers I think that's great advice

02:19:22.200 --> 02:19:23.920
don't burn your bridges and they just

02:19:23.920 --> 02:19:27.040
say it's a small industry very true

02:19:27.040 --> 02:19:29.320
don't spend the entire time on your

02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:31.000
pitch because you want room for Q&A

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:37.760
don't bullshit I you know there's

02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:39.680
already a million bullshit terms that

02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:41.200
though the people have used to fool the

02:19:41.200 --> 02:19:44.200
public like remember blast processing

02:19:44.200 --> 02:19:46.440
yeah that's true yeah you know what all

02:19:46.440 --> 02:19:48.600
that was that was the only thing the

02:19:48.600 --> 02:19:50.040
Genesis did better than the Super

02:19:50.040 --> 02:19:54.760
Nintendo just saying you know or like

02:19:54.760 --> 02:19:56.440
look at these graphics blah blah blah no

02:19:56.440 --> 02:19:59.440
substance you know that's bullshitting

tell people this really first Dave do do

02:20:25.840 --> 02:20:28.160
not tell the publisher how to do their

02:20:28.160 --> 02:20:30.760
job don't tell Sony why they're a bad

02:20:30.760 --> 02:20:38.360

really yep really food for thought they

02:21:05.200 --> 02:21:07.560
suggest that you know you have the rest

02:21:07.560 --> 02:21:09.080
of your life to drink so that if you

02:21:09.080 --> 02:21:11.060
have a presentation the next day maybe

02:21:11.060 --> 02:21:12.560
you just shouldn't party the night

02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:14.480
before and not everyone has my mutant

02:21:14.480 --> 02:21:17.080

02:23:04.480 --> 02:23:06.840
don't believe that I was ever it'll be

02:23:06.840 --> 02:23:09.760
like Loki saw drugs or violence saw off

02:23:09.760 --> 02:23:14.040

contest I think I would have won but

02:23:36.800 --> 02:23:40.320
anyway would have won for people who

02:23:40.320 --> 02:23:43.320

02:23:43.320 --> 02:23:45.400
out would have should have would have

02:23:45.400 --> 02:23:50.600
the V actually is from half saying hi

02:23:50.600 --> 02:23:53.240
okay hey all our people this is honey

02:23:53.240 --> 02:23:54.720
but I knew honey badger was gonna email

02:23:54.720 --> 02:23:57.080
cuz honey badger told me an email aka

02:23:57.080 --> 02:24:00.080
blade 3 aka Sam call me whatever either

02:24:00.080 --> 02:24:01.640
way I just wanted to tell a little story

02:24:01.640 --> 02:24:05.000
about a funny experience with EA EA has

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.120
been distinguished as being the world's

02:24:07.120 --> 02:24:09.280
shittiest company about two copies of

02:24:09.280 --> 02:24:11.680
the same game via origin basically a

02:24:11.680 --> 02:24:13.240
friend and I were looking for a way to

02:24:13.240 --> 02:24:15.520
play mercenaries two together because it

02:24:15.520 --> 02:24:18.520
was a cheap sale for it so I bought it

02:24:18.520 --> 02:24:20.280
with my origin account for me and then

02:24:20.280 --> 02:24:23.800
for him but wait origin does not have

02:24:23.800 --> 02:24:25.600
the feature to let you gift a copy of a

02:24:25.600 --> 02:24:27.520
game so I told my friend I would log in

02:24:27.520 --> 02:24:29.540
as him and buy it for him and I did my

02:24:29.540 --> 02:24:31.580
next move was contact EA to refund one

02:24:31.580 --> 02:24:33.360
of the games and after all I never

02:24:33.360 --> 02:24:35.540
access the download a game in any way

02:24:35.540 --> 02:24:37.960
and so why would there be a problem

02:24:37.960 --> 02:24:40.080
there so I pulled up EA live chat the

02:24:40.080 --> 02:24:43.360
rep I spoke to knew about one sentence

02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:45.880
of English so that was great I told the

02:24:45.880 --> 02:24:47.920
rep I want an American customer support

02:24:47.920 --> 02:24:49.200
number and he gave it to me of course I

02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:50.480
had to wait till business hours to call

02:24:50.480 --> 02:24:52.920
which I did and I told the American rep

02:24:52.920 --> 02:24:54.600
about my problem and he gladly refunded

02:24:54.600 --> 02:24:56.720
me no harm no foul we then had a

02:24:56.720 --> 02:24:58.400
conversation in which he told me origin

02:24:58.400 --> 02:25:00.400
and the entire EA digital game system is

02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:03.120
a travesty and is complete garbage I

02:25:03.120 --> 02:25:04.880
thought that says a lot when your own

02:25:04.880 --> 02:25:07.360
employees tell customers that they agree

02:25:07.360 --> 02:25:09.400
that their system is shit so that's all

02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:12.480
I just thought I so that's all just

02:25:12.480 --> 02:25:13.960
thought it was funny keep up the good

02:25:13.960 --> 02:25:17.080
work Sam there's really truly only one

02:25:17.080 --> 02:25:25.400
thing I can say about all of that what

02:25:25.400 --> 02:25:26.880
I'm gonna say there's hostile employees

02:25:26.880 --> 02:25:29.320
at every workplace so that's true this

02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:31.800
company sucks I ain't working here

02:25:31.800 --> 02:25:35.120
they're always the best because they'll

02:25:35.120 --> 02:25:36.280
give you the most stuff because they

02:25:36.280 --> 02:25:39.280
hate their job okay PS upon trying to

02:25:39.280 --> 02:25:42.080
play to place Mercs 2 online we found

02:25:42.080 --> 02:25:43.960
out EA no longer ran servers for the

02:25:43.960 --> 02:25:46.840
game and did not release a dedicated

02:25:46.840 --> 02:25:49.680
server for people to play overland PSS

02:25:49.680 --> 02:25:52.240
what's even better is that the copy of

02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:54.040
Mercs 2 I was refunded for still works

02:25:54.040 --> 02:25:57.360
and I got my money revenge woo a winner

02:25:57.360 --> 02:26:00.960
is you way to work this system okay

02:26:00.960 --> 02:26:03.480
it's because you got the employee who

02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:06.320
who checked out years ago this comes

02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:11.040
from Sam another Sam hi Sam dark soccer

02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:12.480
never ceases to bring up important

02:26:12.480 --> 02:26:13.760
points why thank you because I know I'm

02:26:13.760 --> 02:26:16.400
awesome dark soccer has me wondering if

02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:18.120
the next PlayStation and Xbox will have

02:26:18.120 --> 02:26:19.640
the same controllers as the current

02:26:19.640 --> 02:26:22.080
systems or will they be redesigned what

02:26:22.080 --> 02:26:23.840
do you all think I'll be redesigned

02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:25.440
there there's always a some type of

02:26:25.440 --> 02:26:28.560
redesign but think about this remember I

02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:30.080
don't I mean I don't know the marine

02:26:30.080 --> 02:26:31.840
controls is exactly what I was gonna say

02:26:31.840 --> 02:26:32.840
I don't know how long Sam's been

02:26:32.840 --> 02:26:34.560
following video game news but remember

02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:36.280
when the PlayStation 3 was first revealed

02:26:36.280 --> 02:26:37.960
they had that boomerang controller and

02:26:37.960 --> 02:26:39.440
everything what's this uncomfortable

02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:41.440
looking shit literally the internet all

02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:45.000
in unison went lol what and so they went

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:46.840
back to a controller that kind of looked

02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:49.000
like the DualShock 2 except they looked

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:50.920
exactly like the DualShock 2 but it had

02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:54.200
six axis remember was the big six axis

02:26:54.200 --> 02:26:56.120
because we can't put DualShock in it

02:26:56.120 --> 02:26:57.720
anymore because the lawsuit although

02:26:57.720 --> 02:26:59.200
that finally worked itself out and they

02:26:59.200 --> 02:27:00.760
put it back in there but you don't need

02:27:00.760 --> 02:27:04.600
rumble rumble was so last-gen and I need

02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:07.880
rumble anybody rumble was so last-gen

02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:10.800
Ridge Racers gonna use six axis so

02:27:10.800 --> 02:27:12.760
here's the deal which is pile of crap

02:27:12.760 --> 02:27:15.840
PlayStation 4 probably not gonna buck

02:27:15.840 --> 02:27:18.200
the trend too much I mean I would think

02:27:18.200 --> 02:27:20.200
maybe one thing they're gonna try to do

02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:22.440
I don't I don't know why I'm just

02:27:22.440 --> 02:27:24.320
putting my little light little tinfoil

02:27:24.320 --> 02:27:25.880
hat I think it'll kind of look like a

02:27:25.880 --> 02:27:27.240
ps3 controller but they're gonna try to

02:27:27.240 --> 02:27:29.320
push that rear touch thing on those

02:27:29.320 --> 02:27:30.600
controllers it's gonna be a little

02:27:30.600 --> 02:27:32.800
ridiculous but that's just what I think

02:27:32.800 --> 02:27:34.120
I can see that but I think the basic

02:27:34.120 --> 02:27:36.760
design isn't gonna change Xbox will

02:27:36.760 --> 02:27:38.680
change somewhat I think even the

02:27:38.680 --> 02:27:40.400
controller the controller design changed

02:27:40.400 --> 02:27:43.480
within that first as deep remember the

02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:46.040
remember the first Xbox was gigantic

02:27:46.040 --> 02:27:47.960
those gigantic Xbox controls and they

02:27:47.960 --> 02:27:50.320
scaled them down and then the Xbox 360

02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:52.440
controller was relatively similar enough

02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:55.440
you know well and if now looking at

02:27:55.440 --> 02:27:56.840
other systems I think Nintendo is gonna

02:27:56.840 --> 02:27:57.800
have a different controller every

02:27:57.800 --> 02:27:59.760
second time yeah I mean that that's the

02:27:59.760 --> 02:28:01.520
one that is radically different every

02:28:01.520 --> 02:28:03.400
time that never looked really much

02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:06.560
difference was the well even when they

02:28:06.560 --> 02:28:07.800
brought out the top loading nest they

02:28:07.800 --> 02:28:10.360
had this nest style controller kind of

02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:12.520
but there was still a basic paddle and

02:28:12.520 --> 02:28:15.720
button layout you know now the ones that

02:28:15.720 --> 02:28:18.880
I as far as logical redesigns have gone

02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:22.800
as if you take the Sega systems gone for

02:28:22.800 --> 02:28:24.200
the master system gone to the Genesis

02:28:24.200 --> 02:28:25.360
gone to the six button Genesis

02:28:25.360 --> 02:28:27.120
controller to the Saturn that had a

02:28:27.120 --> 02:28:30.080
similar controller to the Genesis to the

02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:32.080
dual analog controller which I was I

02:28:32.080 --> 02:28:34.000
will stand on this to this day best

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.640
controller ever then the Dreamcast

02:28:36.640 --> 02:28:41.320
carry the similar style to the the I

02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:43.280
just said it the dual analog controller

02:28:43.280 --> 02:28:46.040
because it made sense it was comfortable

02:28:46.040 --> 02:28:48.040
it looks hard but it's super comfortable

02:28:48.040 --> 02:28:50.320
10 to 64 what the fuck was Nintendo

02:28:50.320 --> 02:28:54.520
thinking but I mean I think that using

02:28:54.520 --> 02:28:58.040
the those examples I think that the

02:28:58.040 --> 02:29:01.200
company's the the powers that be except

02:29:01.200 --> 02:29:03.320
for Nintendo have learned their lesson

02:29:03.320 --> 02:29:06.360
for making too many variables in you

02:29:06.360 --> 02:29:08.640
know when it comes to controller

02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:10.720
progression and are sticking with the

02:29:10.720 --> 02:29:14.440
tried-and-true shape this I mean I may

02:29:14.440 --> 02:29:16.760
not be the biggest Sony fan but I have

02:29:16.760 --> 02:29:18.840
to say that the controller has always

02:29:18.840 --> 02:29:21.120
had an ergonomically comfortable shape

02:29:21.120 --> 02:29:24.520
I do find it easier to hold it than I do

02:29:24.520 --> 02:29:27.360
an Xbox controller even though I tend to

02:29:27.360 --> 02:29:30.400
like games better on Xbox the PlayStation

02:29:30.400 --> 02:29:31.600
controller is easier to hold I think

02:29:31.600 --> 02:29:33.560
they'll stick with it one thing to keep

02:29:33.560 --> 02:29:34.920
in mind to free move on to the next

02:29:34.920 --> 02:29:38.240
email is that keep in mind the next Xbox

02:29:38.240 --> 02:29:40.560
is going to be very heavy on this whole

02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:42.600
whatever the new Kinect is whatever this

02:29:42.600 --> 02:29:45.040
advanced Kinect is Microsoft wants

02:29:45.040 --> 02:29:46.920
Kinect to happen I mean I guess Kinect

02:29:46.920 --> 02:29:48.280
already has happened but they want it to

02:29:48.280 --> 02:29:50.120
be more than a fad they're gonna shove

02:29:50.120 --> 02:29:51.920
this thing down your throat in the next

02:29:51.920 --> 02:29:55.120
Xbox so even though yes there will be a

02:29:55.120 --> 02:29:56.800
tangible controller there has to be for

02:29:56.800 --> 02:29:59.080
the halo games expect that Microsoft

02:29:59.080 --> 02:30:00.560
will make a big deal out of the whole

02:30:00.560 --> 02:30:03.320
hands free now you can control it with

02:30:03.320 --> 02:30:05.440
your fingers because it's so precise you

02:30:05.440 --> 02:30:07.080
can just use your little finger better

02:30:07.080 --> 02:30:09.080
be things you're gonna use little fingers

02:30:09.080 --> 02:30:11.320
to point at things that's awesome expect

02:30:11.320 --> 02:30:13.160
that play the controller as much as I

02:30:13.160 --> 02:30:17.440
want to like that concept I think that

02:30:17.440 --> 02:30:20.880
you're dealing with to the the bulk of

02:30:20.880 --> 02:30:24.640
gamers at least that have the money to

02:30:24.640 --> 02:30:26.600
afford any of this are going to be in our

02:30:26.600 --> 02:30:28.640
age group people who have grown up with

02:30:28.640 --> 02:30:30.240
a controller in their hand and they've

02:30:30.240 --> 02:30:31.920
tried this before with like remember the

02:30:31.920 --> 02:30:35.320
u-force oh that was crap or the

02:30:35.320 --> 02:30:37.760
activator they've tried hands-free

02:30:37.760 --> 02:30:39.880
controllers before and true the

02:30:39.880 --> 02:30:41.520
technology wasn't what it is today I

02:30:41.520 --> 02:30:43.840
mean definitely Kinect is I'd have to

02:30:43.840 --> 02:30:45.840
say up at the best of it but the very

02:30:45.840 --> 02:30:47.680
least with Nintendo and with the move

02:30:47.680 --> 02:30:49.840
you've still got something tangible that

02:30:49.840 --> 02:30:51.520
you can hold people like that tactile

02:30:51.520 --> 02:30:54.880
experience and you remember that thing

02:30:54.880 --> 02:30:57.120
that they were making for so you could

02:30:57.120 --> 02:30:58.680
feel the textures of things and games

02:30:58.680 --> 02:31:00.880
yeah how it was that thing was kind of

02:31:00.880 --> 02:31:02.760
cool the haptic stuff yeah that was

02:31:02.760 --> 02:31:04.840
pretty cool but I mean everybody said

02:31:04.840 --> 02:31:08.320
it was going to be in the next iPad so

02:31:08.320 --> 02:31:11.640
good okay now your iPad will touch you

02:31:11.640 --> 02:31:16.320
oh baby no but the whole point like I

02:31:16.320 --> 02:31:19.360
said oh you put your dick on it people

02:31:19.360 --> 02:31:22.040
like a tactile experience I bet they do

02:31:22.040 --> 02:31:25.720
that's what I'm talking about you guys

02:31:25.720 --> 02:31:30.760
are children seriously but logically

02:31:30.760 --> 02:31:33.400
take away the five-year-old laughing at

02:31:33.400 --> 02:31:35.840
everything am I right would do you

02:31:35.840 --> 02:31:37.400
prefer to have something in your hand

02:31:37.400 --> 02:31:40.080
while you play or do you like waving

02:31:40.080 --> 02:31:41.160
your hands in the air unless you're

02:31:41.160 --> 02:31:42.880
playing para para the yeah it's

02:31:42.880 --> 02:31:44.840
acceptable if I'm playing dance central

02:31:44.840 --> 02:31:46.800
that's really the only game and and it's

02:31:46.800 --> 02:31:48.800
clones those those dancing games are

02:31:48.800 --> 02:31:50.000
really the only ones that have really

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:51.720
been a great experience dancing even the

02:31:51.720 --> 02:31:53.840
fitness stuff if that actually works you

02:31:53.840 --> 02:31:55.560
know mm-hmm yeah when the fitness games

02:31:55.560 --> 02:31:57.600
work yeah yeah I'll agree with that same

02:31:57.600 --> 02:31:59.080
thing same thing with the we you know

02:31:59.080 --> 02:32:01.120
and all that but um like for I just

02:32:01.120 --> 02:32:02.360
bitched about this last week of the week

02:32:02.360 --> 02:32:04.640
before that Disneyland Connect I want to

02:32:04.640 --> 02:32:06.400
pick up a controller and play it yeah

02:32:06.400 --> 02:32:09.520
oh and especially when you're dealing

02:32:09.520 --> 02:32:12.160
it's like they're trying to retrain an

02:32:12.160 --> 02:32:14.640
entire generation of gamers they want

02:32:14.640 --> 02:32:17.880
all the newer ones coming in to have a

02:32:17.880 --> 02:32:20.080
different experience and we did where

02:32:20.080 --> 02:32:22.120
I'm sorry we're the ones with the money

02:32:22.120 --> 02:32:24.320
and there's nothing wrong with having a

02:32:24.320 --> 02:32:27.360
controller you know now the only

02:32:27.360 --> 02:32:29.200
advantage like I said I can see for

02:32:29.200 --> 02:32:30.680
having some of this is like if someone's

02:32:30.680 --> 02:32:33.080
got my you know horrific hand problems

02:32:33.080 --> 02:32:34.880
but what did I do I stopped playing on

02:32:34.880 --> 02:32:36.120
the consoles and started playing on my

02:32:36.120 --> 02:32:38.680
PC well I think also that they want to

02:32:38.680 --> 02:32:39.800
get rid of the controller because a lot

02:32:39.800 --> 02:32:42.720
of elderly and older people think that

02:32:42.720 --> 02:32:44.640
controllers are too confusing and so

02:32:44.640 --> 02:32:45.920
it's like all you have to do is wave

02:32:45.920 --> 02:32:48.200
your hands oh I can do that I wave my

02:32:48.200 --> 02:32:50.160
hands at old random strangers all the

02:32:50.160 --> 02:32:53.480
time so I'm totally used to this my hand

02:32:53.480 --> 02:32:55.680
to get kids off my lawn I can use I can

02:32:55.680 --> 02:32:58.720
use this as another kind of analogy here

02:32:58.720 --> 02:33:02.080
I would I was in band and Rob you know

02:33:02.080 --> 02:33:03.680
this you were in band what you play

02:33:03.680 --> 02:33:07.440
clarinet yes okay well I put clarinet

02:33:07.440 --> 02:33:10.880
too so hush but anyone who's a musician

02:33:10.880 --> 02:33:12.000
also knows that when you play an

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.200
instrument it's not necessarily that

02:33:14.200 --> 02:33:15.720
your brain learns it is that your

02:33:15.720 --> 02:33:19.520
fingers learn what to do you know you

02:33:19.520 --> 02:33:21.720
can I bet you anything that if I picked

02:33:21.720 --> 02:33:23.040
up my saxophone I could still play

02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:25.760
through any number of scales and not

02:33:25.760 --> 02:33:27.720
think about it because my fingers have

02:33:27.720 --> 02:33:29.320
been trained to do this my reflex is

02:33:29.320 --> 02:33:30.960
trained the same goes with playing a

02:33:30.960 --> 02:33:33.600
game after a while it's that your

02:33:33.600 --> 02:33:36.360
fingers your thumbs become accustomed to

02:33:36.360 --> 02:33:38.160
doing certain things you're not actively

02:33:38.160 --> 02:33:40.160
thinking that you're doing it you just

02:33:40.160 --> 02:33:42.240
make a decision and you do it you know

02:33:42.240 --> 02:33:46.000
it's instinct it becomes was it motor

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:47.640
response isn't that what it's called

02:33:47.640 --> 02:33:50.840
motor memory or something yeah and so I

02:33:50.840 --> 02:33:52.640
think that's the other thing too is that

02:33:52.640 --> 02:33:56.520
if you look at the people who are worse

02:33:56.520 --> 02:34:00.320
with with being coordinated like actual

02:34:00.320 --> 02:34:02.520
dancing and everything I can't dance for

02:34:02.520 --> 02:34:05.600
crap but I can you know I can play a

02:34:05.600 --> 02:34:07.720
game I can you are like a son of a bitch

02:34:07.720 --> 02:34:10.440
exactly well exactly because that has to

02:34:10.440 --> 02:34:12.480
do more with the same thing that's you

02:34:12.480 --> 02:34:15.400
know it's a different type of your it's

02:34:15.400 --> 02:34:17.400
and you have your hand eye coordination

02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:19.000
going but you don't have something

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:20.880
that's going to be an abstract movement

02:34:20.880 --> 02:34:22.720
as something that has attacked our

02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:24.680
response so anyway

02:34:24.680 --> 02:34:28.120
fair enough next email I forgot what I

02:34:28.120 --> 02:34:31.280
was saying oh yeah hi olr just wanted to

02:34:31.280 --> 02:34:33.040
type you a small email and let you know

02:34:33.040 --> 02:34:37.960
the last week show for wait for 69 was

02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:41.760
awesome nice job I also wanted to say

02:34:41.760 --> 02:34:43.480
that Shane was right about sound shapes

02:34:43.480 --> 02:34:46.080
and Rob your review was excellent it is

02:34:46.080 --> 02:34:47.840
truly a great game in a breath of fresh

02:34:47.840 --> 02:34:50.320
air for the Vita Loki I know you were an

02:34:50.320 --> 02:34:53.920
FPS fan are you going to get into CS go

02:34:56.160 --> 02:34:58.560
into counter strike go thank you I was

02:34:58.560 --> 02:34:59.920
like what that he's like I'm on the beta

02:34:59.920 --> 02:35:02.040
now it's pretty to play one yeah it's a

02:35:02.040 --> 02:35:03.920
free to play one but I never played I

02:35:03.920 --> 02:35:05.480
never really played counter strike so

02:35:05.480 --> 02:35:09.400
well he says I'm on the beta now it's

02:35:09.400 --> 02:35:11.240

it's just nothing but compliments really

02:35:19.240 --> 02:35:20.800

02:35:20.800 --> 02:35:23.280
my second my second place genre of

02:35:23.280 --> 02:35:25.800
choice you know whereas you like bugs I

02:35:25.800 --> 02:35:29.800
like sans sandbox games yes I do need to

02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:33.080
go back to play she do or more sleeping

02:35:33.080 --> 02:35:34.760
dogs because that's pretty awesome but

02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:37.600
I'm really it's just all killing time

02:35:37.600 --> 02:35:39.400
before granted the five comes out and

02:35:39.400 --> 02:35:41.480
then it's just that's all it's gonna be

02:35:41.480 --> 02:35:44.280
that and also maybe a quick you know

02:35:44.280 --> 02:35:46.120
excursion to at the fence force on the

02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:47.320
Vita when that comes out the end of

02:35:47.320 --> 02:35:51.240
September in Japan can't wait all right

02:35:51.240 --> 02:35:52.920

calm if you want to send us an email in

02:35:58.720 --> 02:36:00.200
the future in the meantime let's get

02:36:00.200 --> 02:36:14.720
angsty

02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:20.400
if use the week time dark Sakura this is

02:36:20.400 --> 02:36:25.040
going to be difficult for me to say but

02:36:25.040 --> 02:36:26.480
I did say it on my facebook and got into

02:36:26.480 --> 02:36:28.640
an argument with my mother of course I

02:36:28.640 --> 02:36:29.760
can see anything on Facebook about

02:36:29.760 --> 02:36:31.160
getting into argue with my mother fuck

02:36:31.160 --> 02:36:36.680
that I would like to say a current fu to

02:36:36.680 --> 02:36:38.640
the Republican Party and their choice of

02:36:38.640 --> 02:36:41.720
who's running and his running mate I

02:36:41.720 --> 02:36:44.640
don't think that I and I really am trying

02:36:44.640 --> 02:36:47.080
not to be judgmental I mean okay I'm a

02:36:47.080 --> 02:36:48.200
judgmental bitch anyway but it doesn't

02:36:48.200 --> 02:36:52.600
matter but anyone who supports that

02:36:52.600 --> 02:36:56.720
level of evil I don't know that I would

02:36:56.720 --> 02:36:58.360
be able to look them in the eye so fuck

02:36:58.360 --> 02:37:02.720
that level of evil and then

02:37:02.720 --> 02:37:08.520
see I guess if you to

02:37:08.520 --> 02:37:13.160
I don't know be burnt out at work

02:37:13.160 --> 02:37:17.520
I hear ya I would say it's kind of a

02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:19.400
similar f you not that I like nothing

02:37:19.400 --> 02:37:20.840
like I'm burned out on work as I really

02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:22.360
do like my job but just f you to the

02:37:22.360 --> 02:37:25.240
fact that I'm starting a class next week

02:37:25.240 --> 02:37:26.760
it's like oh god it's at my first class

02:37:26.760 --> 02:37:29.280
like nine months and it's gonna be the

02:37:29.280 --> 02:37:31.400
long hours again and prepare to get no

02:37:31.400 --> 02:37:33.200
sleep and all that stuff I'm just like f

02:37:33.200 --> 02:37:34.800
you do the toll it's about to take on my

02:37:34.800 --> 02:37:37.580
body and more importantly and f you to a

02:37:37.580 --> 02:37:40.280
real toll on my body f you to myself for

02:37:40.280 --> 02:37:42.120
overdoing it at the gym Monday because

02:37:42.120 --> 02:37:44.300
like I really hurt my leg by I guess I

02:37:44.300 --> 02:37:45.760
didn't stretch good enough beforehand

02:37:45.760 --> 02:37:48.640
or I did too much resistance and on the

02:37:48.640 --> 02:37:50.440
bike because I do a lot of cardio and

02:37:50.440 --> 02:37:52.200
yeah I was paying for it for like five

02:37:52.200 --> 02:37:53.640
days I couldn't go back to the gym I

02:37:53.640 --> 02:37:55.760
really wanted to go if I may hmm and

02:37:55.760 --> 02:37:57.680
this is what has been drilled into my

02:37:57.680 --> 02:38:00.480
head by all of I used to be really good

02:38:00.480 --> 02:38:03.680
friends with one of my gym the ladies

02:38:03.680 --> 02:38:05.840
that talk classes at my gym and you're

02:38:05.840 --> 02:38:07.560
supposed to do a five-minute light warm

02:38:07.560 --> 02:38:10.560
up then stretch then do your stuff oh I

02:38:10.560 --> 02:38:12.840
didn't do that I mean I do I do the

02:38:12.840 --> 02:38:14.600
light never stretch your muscles hold

02:38:14.600 --> 02:38:16.840
just go right in there high resistance

02:38:16.840 --> 02:38:18.840
obviously I tried to do the up down like

02:38:18.840 --> 02:38:20.360
the little you know up and down like

02:38:20.360 --> 02:38:24.080
type of thing but circuit style I guess

02:38:24.080 --> 02:38:26.000
but I don't like circuit implies to me

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:27.840
you do five minutes on every machine I'm

02:38:27.840 --> 02:38:29.680
not at that level yet you know I just I

02:38:29.680 --> 02:38:32.360
it's if I can get my fat ass on a bike

02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:34.520
and roll around on it for an hour that

02:38:34.520 --> 02:38:37.160
is an accomplishment for me so but um

02:38:37.160 --> 02:38:40.460
it's you never want to work out with

02:38:40.460 --> 02:38:43.480
muscles that are cold you always want

02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:44.880
like Dan you should just go sit in a

02:38:44.880 --> 02:38:46.480
sauna before he did anything anything

02:38:46.480 --> 02:38:48.120
but honestly you actually want to work

02:38:48.120 --> 02:38:50.080
and then stretch and then work hmm

02:38:50.080 --> 02:38:52.440
interesting yeah just learning something

02:38:52.440 --> 02:38:55.200
we fit didn't tell me that or maybe it

02:38:55.200 --> 02:38:57.840
didn't I wasn't like I said you know all

02:38:57.840 --> 02:38:59.640
the time I used to spend working out so

02:38:59.640 --> 02:39:01.080
all right just a couple more news

02:39:01.080 --> 02:39:02.120
stories for you guys and then the

02:39:02.120 --> 02:39:05.360
skype line at 1 8 7 7 game olr as well

02:39:05.360 --> 02:39:06.840
as the Twitter topics have to get out my

02:39:06.840 --> 02:39:09.080
iPad and see if there are any and any

02:39:09.080 --> 02:39:11.520
last-minute stories Loki might have but

02:39:11.520 --> 02:39:13.480
first two final stories for you guys

02:39:13.480 --> 02:39:16.240
Loki all right so one of the games I

02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:17.400
mentioned that played this week was

02:39:17.400 --> 02:39:22.000
castle miner Z which is sold 900,000

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:23.680
copies and apparently is one of the

02:39:23.680 --> 02:39:25.520
fastest-selling Xbox live indie games

02:39:25.520 --> 02:39:28.000
not sure if it's the fastest selling one

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:29.920
but I know because I know I made a

02:39:29.920 --> 02:39:33.440
zombie games in it all right look sorry

02:39:33.440 --> 02:39:35.720
about that game with zombies in it sold

02:39:35.720 --> 02:39:38.280
quite a bit and then I'm sure there's

02:39:38.280 --> 02:39:40.480
been some other ones that have done

02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:42.920
well as a part of the indie games

02:39:42.920 --> 02:39:44.960
program but it's definitely one of the

02:39:44.960 --> 02:39:48.000
most recent ones according to the

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:52.920
developer and then also I guess it is at

02:39:52.920 --> 02:39:55.080
the top of the daily best-selling area

02:39:55.080 --> 02:39:57.840
of xbox.com right now and it's only 80

02:39:57.840 --> 02:39:59.240
microsoft points so if you want to check

02:39:59.240 --> 02:40:01.120
it out I'm sure there's also a lot of

02:40:01.120 --> 02:40:03.120
other good games for 80 microsoft points

02:40:03.120 --> 02:40:05.840
on the indie games as well and another

02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:09.760
unrelated news minecraft 7 million

02:40:09.760 --> 02:40:12.240
copies sold on PC so that's pretty cool

02:40:12.240 --> 02:40:14.880
so that genre of game seems to be doing

02:40:14.880 --> 02:40:18.320
pretty well it just won't die the

02:40:18.320 --> 02:40:21.720
phenomenon will not stop well something

02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:24.160
that has stopped a guitar hero or at

02:40:24.160 --> 02:40:25.800
least it's on ice for a little while and

02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:29.200
now the lawsuits can begin they of

02:40:29.200 --> 02:40:31.760
course started some time ago but uh you

02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:33.320
know we talked about no doubts lawsuit

02:40:33.320 --> 02:40:34.440
well they're not the only ones that are

02:40:34.440 --> 02:40:36.120
suing Activision over the whole guitar

02:40:36.120 --> 02:40:38.960
hero and band hero stuff axle rose

02:40:38.960 --> 02:40:45.240
remember Guns N' Roses well axle rose had

02:40:45.240 --> 02:40:46.960
a preliminary hearing about the guitar

02:40:46.960 --> 02:40:49.320
hero 3 lawsuit apparently there is a

02:40:49.320 --> 02:40:52.400
tentative court date in February 2013

02:40:52.400 --> 02:40:55.200
axle rose is pissed about the game which

02:40:55.200 --> 02:40:58.640
came out in late 2007 as a reminder and

02:40:58.640 --> 02:41:02.000
it will finally go to court in 2013

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:05.320
apparently it unlawfully associated Guns

02:41:05.320 --> 02:41:09.200
N' Roses music with slash who as you

02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:11.680
know was formerly with good Guns N'

02:41:11.680 --> 02:41:14.440
Roses and him and axle rose they don't

02:41:14.440 --> 02:41:17.000
get along so axle rose was pissed about

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:18.360
that basically saying slash was

02:41:18.360 --> 02:41:20.000
associated with these songs but they're

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:24.040
not his song so fuck all y'all right well

02:41:24.040 --> 02:41:26.240
the judge during the preliminary hearing

02:41:26.240 --> 02:41:28.920
wanted to toss out the claim of fraud

02:41:28.920 --> 02:41:31.280
because the statute of limitations has

02:41:31.280 --> 02:41:36.000
expired however let's see it came up

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.320
here quote the reason I did not file a

02:41:38.320 --> 02:41:40.320
lawsuit because Activision through my

02:41:40.320 --> 02:41:42.120
managers and representatives offered me

02:41:42.120 --> 02:41:44.920
a separate video game and other business

02:41:44.920 --> 02:41:47.160
proposals worth millions of dollars to

02:41:47.160 --> 02:41:49.400
resolve and settle my claims relating to

02:41:49.400 --> 02:41:52.680
guitar hero 3 from December 2007 through

02:41:52.680 --> 02:41:55.280
November 2010 Activision was offering me

02:41:55.280 --> 02:41:57.680
a Guns N' Roses dedicated video game a

02:41:57.680 --> 02:42:00.080
game dedicated to music from the Chinese

02:42:00.080 --> 02:42:03.160
democracy album and other proposals

02:42:03.160 --> 02:42:06.280
interesting so the judge did dismiss the

02:42:06.280 --> 02:42:07.680
claim of fraud but the breach of

02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:09.560
contract it is moving forward for

02:42:09.560 --> 02:42:13.240
February 1st 2013 so that's why it took

02:42:13.240 --> 02:42:14.960
axle rose three years to file a lawsuit

02:42:14.960 --> 02:42:17.240
because they were basically cock teasing

02:42:17.240 --> 02:42:18.960
him about his own game or so he claims

02:42:18.960 --> 02:42:22.080
allegedly all that good stuff but it

02:42:22.080 --> 02:42:23.960
makes sense why they decided not to do

02:42:23.960 --> 02:42:26.320
it because when guitar hero Van Halen

02:42:26.320 --> 02:42:28.000
and band hero and all that kind of

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.520
oversaturated the market you know I

02:42:30.520 --> 02:42:32.760
don't those artists centric video games

02:42:32.760 --> 02:42:34.640
none of them really did very well the

02:42:34.640 --> 02:42:36.920
only one that did marginally good was

02:42:36.920 --> 02:42:38.800
the Beatles and when the Beatles can

02:42:38.800 --> 02:42:41.360
only do marginally successful it's not

02:42:41.360 --> 02:42:43.560
good enough you know the Green Day one

02:42:43.560 --> 02:42:45.960
didn't do so hot Van Halen not so great

02:42:45.960 --> 02:42:47.360
what was the other one there was one

02:42:47.360 --> 02:42:51.120
more guitar hero italica allah oh god

02:42:51.120 --> 02:42:54.960
that was not just not a good game so

02:42:54.960 --> 02:42:57.680
raman our chat room says a dedicated

02:42:57.680 --> 02:42:59.840
actual rose game and Aerosmith does it

02:42:59.840 --> 02:43:01.880
come complete with heroin does it come

02:43:01.880 --> 02:43:03.840
with shame and a bottle of vodka oh I

02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:09.480
like his better welcome to unemployment

02:43:09.480 --> 02:43:13.880
all right you know what what I need to

02:43:13.880 --> 02:43:15.040
find something different for the fortune

02:43:15.040 --> 02:43:16.480

02:43:38.960 --> 02:43:40.320
sent us a tweet and I think I already

02:43:40.320 --> 02:43:41.800
know what this is without going to it

02:43:41.800 --> 02:43:43.680
but he says it's a tweet that says this

02:43:43.680 --> 02:43:46.480
is how China gets rid of outlawed arcade

02:43:46.480 --> 02:43:48.960
machines or what they call gambling

02:43:48.960 --> 02:43:50.600
machines and he sends us a link to a

02:43:50.600 --> 02:43:53.320
story from arcade heroes calm yep I had

02:43:53.320 --> 02:43:55.520
a feeling look at all these arcade

02:43:55.520 --> 02:43:57.960
machines on fire they just set them on

02:43:57.960 --> 02:44:00.920
fire burn it with fire burn it with fire

02:44:00.920 --> 02:44:04.640
and there they go Loki do you have any

02:44:04.640 --> 02:44:07.360
last-minute stories for us no I forgot

02:44:07.360 --> 02:44:09.220
to mention it as part of my gaming week

02:44:09.220 --> 02:44:12.400
I actually played mega zooks that's

02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:16.640
right the old ZZT type game actually

02:44:16.640 --> 02:44:18.640
booted that up I was like oh hey I'll

02:44:18.640 --> 02:44:20.040
make something in this and then I

02:44:20.040 --> 02:44:23.160
realized how out of practice and making

02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:26.000
stuff with mega zooks I was so I said

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.120
that fuck it don't care anymore I

02:44:28.120 --> 02:44:29.920
remember mega zooks that's awesome it

02:44:29.920 --> 02:44:32.560
was awesome good times all right let's

02:44:32.560 --> 02:44:35.600
go to some tweets from Tiger claw heavy

02:44:35.600 --> 02:44:37.600
rain director tells game industry it's

02:44:37.600 --> 02:44:40.440
time to grow up before I even get into

02:44:40.440 --> 02:44:41.720
the article what do you guys think is it

02:44:41.720 --> 02:44:44.160
time for the games industry to grow up

02:44:44.160 --> 02:44:47.280
here's we mean by grow up here's here's

02:44:47.280 --> 02:44:49.000
the one goes to one corner the other

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:50.600
goes to another corner here's the pole

02:44:50.600 --> 02:44:52.920
here's the pole quote from gamasutra

02:44:52.920 --> 02:44:55.040
which Tiger claw linked us to on Twitter

02:44:55.040 --> 02:44:57.680
at twitter.com slash olr I mean how many

02:44:57.680 --> 02:44:59.440
first-person shooters can you make

02:44:59.440 --> 02:45:01.480
there's a moment where we need to grow

02:45:01.480 --> 02:45:04.360
up and that's David cage who is the

02:45:04.360 --> 02:45:06.320
director of beyond two souls you know

02:45:06.320 --> 02:45:09.680
I'm sorry it sounds like he needs a grow

02:45:09.680 --> 02:45:11.120
up because he's just it sounds like he's

02:45:11.120 --> 02:45:12.800
whining that heavy rain didn't sell as

02:45:12.800 --> 02:45:14.440
well you know what they're making games

02:45:14.440 --> 02:45:16.480
that sell well hold on though because I

02:45:16.480 --> 02:45:18.680
do agree with this you know that pole

02:45:18.680 --> 02:45:20.440
quote is a little sensational but let's

02:45:20.440 --> 02:45:21.800
get into the full quote here now I'm in

02:45:21.800 --> 02:45:24.120
the article quote I think we should have

02:45:24.120 --> 02:45:26.000
more courage in our industry and take

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.360
more risks because I think this is what

02:45:28.360 --> 02:45:29.880
the industry needs now I mean how many

02:45:29.880 --> 02:45:31.600
first-person shooters can you make how

02:45:31.600 --> 02:45:33.440
many monsters alien zombies can you

02:45:33.440 --> 02:45:35.300
killing games there's a moment where we

02:45:35.300 --> 02:45:37.080
need to grow up we need to grow up I

02:45:37.080 --> 02:45:39.440
think I often think the industry suffers

02:45:39.440 --> 02:45:41.200
at the Peter Pan syndrome it's the fact

02:45:41.200 --> 02:45:42.700
that we don't want to grow up so we stay

02:45:42.700 --> 02:45:44.600
kids but there is a moment where you

02:45:44.600 --> 02:45:45.960
need to grow up as an industry and you

02:45:45.960 --> 02:45:47.320
cannot keep up with the Peter Pan

02:45:47.320 --> 02:45:49.060
syndrome you need to grow and I think

02:45:49.060 --> 02:45:50.840
this is the right time maybe I don't

02:45:50.840 --> 02:45:52.120
agree so much with the second part of

02:45:52.120 --> 02:45:53.640
that but the first part about they need

02:45:53.640 --> 02:45:55.640
some different shit I kind of agree with

02:45:55.640 --> 02:45:59.120
it like you know who isn't sick of sequel

02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:01.920
sequel sequel sequel I mean granted I

02:46:01.920 --> 02:46:03.880
guess in some ways we support it but I

02:46:03.880 --> 02:46:07.320
do like a lot of the new ideas you know

02:46:07.320 --> 02:46:09.480
if we did never experimented with new

02:46:09.480 --> 02:46:11.560
ideas we wouldn't have recent hits like

02:46:11.560 --> 02:46:14.120
Mass Effect or Little Big Planet or

02:46:14.120 --> 02:46:15.520
which granted all spawn their own

02:46:15.520 --> 02:46:18.720
sequels but you know good games even on

02:46:18.720 --> 02:46:21.080
the indie side braid limbo Mass Effect

02:46:21.080 --> 02:46:22.920
kind of turned into just a shooter with

02:46:22.920 --> 02:46:27.860
this story but I'm just I think that the

02:46:27.860 --> 02:46:29.320
reason why they're not taking risks

02:46:29.320 --> 02:46:30.560
right now because whenever they seem to

02:46:30.560 --> 02:46:33.320
try to take risks they end up not selling

02:46:33.320 --> 02:46:35.760
well those games and you know some of

02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:37.760
these companies are in trouble like THQ

02:46:37.760 --> 02:46:39.900
for example they took a risk with you

02:46:39.900 --> 02:46:43.560
know making that whole you know tablet

02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:45.400
drawing pad thing because everyone's

02:46:45.400 --> 02:46:47.880
like oh hey cool it's like you know like

02:46:47.880 --> 02:46:50.240
Mario Paint and then no one bought it

02:46:50.240 --> 02:46:53.000
and then you know they're they're out a

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:54.760
lot of money because that franchise

02:46:54.760 --> 02:46:57.480
never took off or you know Tony Hawk

02:46:57.480 --> 02:46:59.360
they made you know the stupid game with

02:46:59.360 --> 02:47:01.520
the skateboard and that was taking risks

02:47:01.520 --> 02:47:03.260
and no one bought it and then they did

02:47:03.260 --> 02:47:05.480
you know DJ hero and that was kind of

02:47:05.480 --> 02:47:07.160
taking risks as well in the music genre

02:47:07.160 --> 02:47:08.240
and I thought it's a pretty cool game

02:47:08.240 --> 02:47:10.520
but not that many people bought it so

02:47:10.520 --> 02:47:13.080
this is what you get pretty ourselves

02:47:13.080 --> 02:47:15.280
mad mad world there's another example of

02:47:15.280 --> 02:47:17.040
a game that took risks on the Wii no one

02:47:17.040 --> 02:47:20.240
bought it um conduit pretty awesome

02:47:20.240 --> 02:47:21.960
first-person shooter game on the Wii no

02:47:21.960 --> 02:47:24.000
one bought it so that's where your risk

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:25.920
come back left act Epton chat says I

02:47:25.920 --> 02:47:28.400
bought Mario Paint well yeah you bought

02:47:28.400 --> 02:47:29.720
Mario Paint but you didn't buy the

02:47:29.720 --> 02:47:32.400
tablet that thq put out or the one that

02:47:32.400 --> 02:47:34.800
Ubisoft put out I am I am woefully

02:47:34.800 --> 02:47:36.520

the expert of it so okay so there is it

02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:10.120
there was a 2dx tournament today there

02:48:10.120 --> 02:48:11.760
was the kings of the coast at 8 on the

02:48:11.760 --> 02:48:15.120
break so and you you you now you you've

02:48:15.120 --> 02:48:16.800
been called in you've been calling in on

02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:18.240
the show for a long time to talk about

02:48:18.240 --> 02:48:19.920
bimani games odd stuff and you know I

02:48:19.920 --> 02:48:21.520
know you I know you love your your old

02:48:21.520 --> 02:48:23.040
school games and so forth but am I

02:48:23.040 --> 02:48:24.960
hearing it right that now you have to

02:48:24.960 --> 02:48:26.520
say you you you turned your back on

02:48:26.520 --> 02:48:28.240
bimani today so you could get laid is

02:48:28.240 --> 02:48:30.920
that what I'm hearing that and what and

02:48:30.920 --> 02:48:33.640
and watching expendables too with her

02:48:33.640 --> 02:48:36.440
which she actually like enjoyed like

02:48:36.440 --> 02:48:38.080
even though she was kind of hesitant at

02:48:38.080 --> 02:48:40.520
first she actually enjoyed watching old

02:48:40.520 --> 02:48:43.760
man like shoot guns and kill people well

02:48:43.760 --> 02:48:46.960
she's a keeper I think that's amazing

02:48:46.960 --> 02:48:50.280
that finally it's the Zaku is now

02:48:50.280 --> 02:48:52.520
officially over bimani everybody and

02:48:52.520 --> 02:48:54.880
not really girls are going for today

02:48:54.880 --> 02:48:57.960
only for that day I mean I might compete

02:48:57.960 --> 02:49:00.480
next year if I'm more prepared but right

02:49:00.480 --> 02:49:03.040
now it's like I didn't want to bother

02:49:03.040 --> 02:49:05.440
this year because I said we already like

02:49:05.440 --> 02:49:07.400
been dating for for a little over six

02:49:07.400 --> 02:49:10.280
months now so it's like it makes sense

02:49:10.280 --> 02:49:12.400
to just skip this this path and try the

02:49:12.400 --> 02:49:14.960
next one mm-hmm there will definitely be

02:49:14.960 --> 02:49:16.360
another Kings of the Coast next year

02:49:16.360 --> 02:49:18.120
given the fact that it was like it was

02:49:18.120 --> 02:49:21.640
packed last it was packed yesterday and

02:49:21.640 --> 02:49:23.120
a lot of people entered I think they're

02:49:23.120 --> 02:49:25.120
about they're almost wrapping up the

02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:27.000
doubles tournament right now as we speak

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:28.640
what version of 2dx do they have out

02:49:28.640 --> 02:49:32.200
there in Jersey link oh wow they have

02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:34.440
out not far from me and Queens nice

02:49:34.440 --> 02:49:36.360
that's not you know what though it's not

02:49:36.360 --> 02:49:37.840
hard to pack eight on the break I seem

02:49:37.840 --> 02:49:39.520
to remember it was kind of a small place

02:49:39.520 --> 02:49:40.880
is it well because the arcade machines

02:49:40.880 --> 02:49:42.360
took up a lot of room it would be hard

02:49:42.360 --> 02:49:44.240
to pack that joint and I say the same

02:49:44.240 --> 02:49:46.880
thing about SVGL what is similar I mean

02:49:46.880 --> 02:49:48.520
it's it's not hard to pack that place

02:49:48.520 --> 02:49:50.440
because there's not a lot of space

02:49:50.440 --> 02:49:54.120
anyways speaking or let's digress a

02:49:54.120 --> 02:49:56.240
little bit sure I'm gonna like post up a

02:49:56.240 --> 02:49:57.600
link to an article that you probably

02:49:57.600 --> 02:50:00.360
like already discussed in uh probably

02:50:00.360 --> 02:50:02.800
earlier before I got on maybe about the

02:50:02.800 --> 02:50:05.400
Assassin's Creed 3 director basically

02:50:05.400 --> 02:50:09.960
chiding Japanese games and playing the

02:50:09.960 --> 02:50:11.320
race card because they're basically

02:50:11.320 --> 02:50:14.040
getting a free pass actually we didn't

02:50:14.040 --> 02:50:16.080
bring this up earlier so I'm glad you

02:50:16.080 --> 02:50:17.560
are go ahead and tell us a little bit

02:50:17.560 --> 02:50:19.560
about this all right long story short

02:50:19.560 --> 02:50:21.920
the director of the creative director of

02:50:21.920 --> 02:50:24.240
Assassin's Creed 3 Alex Hutchinson he

02:50:24.240 --> 02:50:26.560
basically went on a rant earlier last

02:50:26.560 --> 02:50:29.800
earlier last weekend and in deriding why

02:50:29.800 --> 02:50:32.320
like a certain like Japanese games are

02:50:32.320 --> 02:50:34.680
getting like free passes like something

02:50:34.680 --> 02:50:38.360
about me I saying stuff about like

02:50:38.360 --> 02:50:41.280
Japanese just how many Japanese games

02:50:41.280 --> 02:50:43.120
are released where the stories are

02:50:43.120 --> 02:50:45.080
literally gibberish literally gibberish

02:50:45.080 --> 02:50:47.160
there's no way you could write it with a

02:50:47.160 --> 02:50:49.200
straight face and you're gonna say oh

02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:51.520
really yeah let me let me let me read

02:50:51.520 --> 02:50:52.760
this quote here and this is what you're

02:50:52.760 --> 02:50:54.080
going off of here and this is in an

02:50:54.080 --> 02:50:57.960
interview with CVG he said just think

02:50:57.960 --> 02:50:59.200
about how many Japanese games are

02:50:59.200 --> 02:51:00.300
released where their stories are

02:51:00.300 --> 02:51:02.240
literally literally gibberish literally

02:51:02.240 --> 02:51:03.640
gibberish there's no way you could write

02:51:03.640 --> 02:51:05.000
it with a straight face and journalists

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.680
say oh it's brilliant then Gears of War

02:51:07.680 --> 02:51:09.040
comes out and apparently it's the worst

02:51:09.040 --> 02:51:10.640
written narrative in a game ever I'll

02:51:10.640 --> 02:51:12.580
take Gears of War over Bayonetta every

02:51:12.580 --> 02:51:15.240
any time it's patronizing to say oh

02:51:15.240 --> 02:51:17.040
those Japanese stories they don't really

02:51:17.040 --> 02:51:19.320
mean what they're doing I don't get why

02:51:19.320 --> 02:51:21.920
critics didn't like Gears of War that's

02:51:21.920 --> 02:51:24.240
news to me and I don't like better game

02:51:24.240 --> 02:51:25.960
when he talks about the whole deal but

02:51:25.960 --> 02:51:28.880
the real kicker is like the his first

02:51:28.880 --> 02:51:31.320
response you want my real answer I think

02:51:31.320 --> 02:51:33.760
there's a subtle racism in the business

02:51:33.760 --> 02:51:35.120
especially on the journalist side where

02:51:35.120 --> 02:51:37.120
Japanese developers are forgiven for

02:51:37.120 --> 02:51:38.520
doing what they do I think it's

02:51:38.520 --> 02:51:41.200
condescending to do this so he really

02:51:41.200 --> 02:51:43.160
like goes off the bat he really like

02:51:43.160 --> 02:51:44.800
goes through the juggler on the first on

02:51:44.800 --> 02:51:47.040
the first sentence I just I think he's I

02:51:47.040 --> 02:51:48.960
mean what about we just talked I'll tell

02:51:48.960 --> 02:51:50.160
you what we did talk about earlier in

02:51:50.160 --> 02:51:52.920
the show Final Fantasy you know the

02:51:52.920 --> 02:51:55.480
Final Fantasy 13 did get hazed for a lot

02:51:55.480 --> 02:51:57.240
of that stuff and being too linear in a

02:51:57.240 --> 02:51:59.120
way and then of course 14 got right

02:51:59.120 --> 02:52:02.400
through the damn coals so well 14 was an

02:52:02.400 --> 02:52:04.240
abomination because it was poorly

02:52:04.240 --> 02:52:06.840
executed and the fact that so many like

02:52:06.840 --> 02:52:09.320
gaps and in the beginning and then to

02:52:09.320 --> 02:52:12.000
the point where they had actually you

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:13.880
know the creative director and the

02:52:13.880 --> 02:52:15.480
producers had to like hand in the

02:52:15.480 --> 02:52:19.000
resignations it was just a cluster

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.360
whereas if you I mean if you look at

02:52:21.360 --> 02:52:23.520
other American RPGs like Skyrim which

02:52:23.520 --> 02:52:24.680
I'm actually going through right now

02:52:24.680 --> 02:52:27.520
thank you steam sale of last month but

02:52:27.520 --> 02:52:30.240
you see how how how verse that game is

02:52:30.240 --> 02:52:31.920
like it's getting to the point where

02:52:31.920 --> 02:52:34.640
I'm like putting at least two hours a

02:52:34.640 --> 02:52:37.040
night right now just on Skyrim alone

02:52:37.040 --> 02:52:38.840
because it's like so much so many things

02:52:38.840 --> 02:52:41.280
to do you can level up your character if

02:52:41.280 --> 02:52:43.160
you wanted to continue on the side on

02:52:43.160 --> 02:52:45.480
the main quest do some side quests try

02:52:45.480 --> 02:52:47.920
your luck in killing Giants and so it's

02:52:47.920 --> 02:52:50.000
also but it's almost like a GTA but with

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:53.000
actual like goals towards like beefing

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:56.560
up your character stats and I think

02:52:56.560 --> 02:52:59.360
what goes wrong with a with Japanese

02:52:59.360 --> 02:53:02.040
games like Final Fantasy it only sticks

02:53:02.040 --> 02:53:03.960
to I mean there is an open world there

02:53:03.960 --> 02:53:05.920
is a concept of an open world but

02:53:05.920 --> 02:53:08.000
everything is pretty much linear in the

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:10.080
sense that you have to do x mission y

02:53:10.080 --> 02:53:13.040
mission side quests and obviously we did

02:53:13.040 --> 02:53:14.760
the occasional grinding there's no like

02:53:14.760 --> 02:53:16.840
there's no retribution where you could

02:53:16.840 --> 02:53:18.840
attack freely any other type of enemy

02:53:18.840 --> 02:53:21.280
because the combat system is so like

02:53:21.280 --> 02:53:24.760
it's so rigid in the sense that you

02:53:24.760 --> 02:53:26.400
randomly encounter enemies you have to

02:53:26.400 --> 02:53:29.240
fight within within that realm of your

02:53:29.240 --> 02:53:32.040
enemy versus your characters I mean I'm

02:53:32.040 --> 02:53:33.880
going I'm using Final Fantasy 7 as a

02:53:33.880 --> 02:53:35.560
frame of reference but you get the idea

02:53:35.560 --> 02:53:39.200
that the way like but that's the like it

02:53:39.200 --> 02:53:41.880
you know I'll do like Squeenix was just

02:53:41.880 --> 02:53:43.760
thinking outside the box and applying

02:53:43.760 --> 02:53:45.720
what they've already done best why can't

02:53:45.720 --> 02:53:47.520
people just like what they like let's

02:53:47.520 --> 02:53:49.360
just like what we like and leave people

02:53:49.360 --> 02:53:51.720
alone well I mean I don't understand why

02:53:51.720 --> 02:53:53.680
he's got it you know some people like

02:53:53.680 --> 02:53:56.480
the Japanese stuff and let it be but I

02:53:56.480 --> 02:53:57.600
don't think just because you like one

02:53:57.600 --> 02:53:59.280
Japanese game means you love them all or

02:53:59.280 --> 02:54:01.000
just because you love Jeff all Japanese

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:02.400
games there's gonna be a few you hate

02:54:02.400 --> 02:54:04.520
you know I don't know just it's just way

02:54:04.520 --> 02:54:06.240
too broad of a statement and I'm hoping

02:54:06.240 --> 02:54:08.000
this is just media sensationalism here

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:09.720
that we're only perpetuating with this

02:54:09.720 --> 02:54:12.320
call because I I would really just hope

02:54:12.320 --> 02:54:16.600
that he's not that narrow-minded I don't

02:54:16.600 --> 02:54:19.400
know so all right Zaku I gotta wrap up

02:54:19.400 --> 02:54:20.800

simple like it's so like it was a little

02:57:11.200 --> 02:57:13.600
bit they say it's just point-and-click

02:57:13.600 --> 02:57:15.480
but there is a bit of a quick time to it

02:57:15.480 --> 02:57:17.160

02:57:17.160 --> 02:57:19.200

02:57:22.960 --> 02:57:25.120

walk away from the studio for a minute

02:57:57.600 --> 02:58:00.840
but what's up listen listen Rob hmm

02:58:00.840 --> 02:58:04.960

and stuff man for the show I gave like I

02:58:22.360 --> 02:58:24.400
gave Jim Sally a name for his show

02:58:24.400 --> 02:58:26.760
because Jim Sally suggested he be the

02:58:26.760 --> 02:58:29.000
opener for the opener like he could open

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:31.200
for Bobby which I don't consider Bobby an

02:58:31.200 --> 02:58:32.920
opener I consider him a cohead liner but

02:58:32.920 --> 02:58:34.660
since he calls himself an opener I'll go

02:58:34.660 --> 02:58:36.580
with that Jim Sally said he could be the

02:58:36.580 --> 02:58:38.160
opener for the opener but I said well

02:58:38.160 --> 02:58:39.780
Jim I think you would be better as the

02:58:39.780 --> 02:58:41.760
closer and you could be pillow talk with

02:58:41.760 --> 02:58:43.760
Jim Sally like right as we go off the

02:58:43.760 --> 02:58:45.340

02:58:45.340 --> 02:58:48.720
time story now go the fuck to sleep

02:58:48.720 --> 02:58:51.240

02:59:00.760 --> 02:59:02.760
for you Jim or for anybody out there in

02:59:02.760 --> 02:59:04.040
the in the universe listening to this

02:59:04.040 --> 02:59:06.400
show vog network we are very interested

02:59:06.400 --> 02:59:10.300
in getting some movie podcast would be

02:59:10.300 --> 02:59:12.960
great book podcast is like at the top of

02:59:12.960 --> 02:59:14.920
my want list right now be it manga

02:59:14.920 --> 02:59:18.240
comic or written book and bugging my

02:59:18.240 --> 02:59:21.840
wife also wrote I I would love to see

02:59:21.840 --> 02:59:24.360
like a role play bit like an old-school

02:59:24.360 --> 02:59:27.400
tabletop gaming and it could be larping

02:59:27.400 --> 02:59:29.800
Dungeons & Dragons and I love love love

02:59:29.800 --> 02:59:33.440
so do this I love love love the idea of

02:59:33.440 --> 02:59:37.160
a game that is podcast like somebody

02:59:37.160 --> 02:59:39.040
who's not sure that would be difficult

02:59:39.040 --> 02:59:40.600
somebody who's actually running a game

02:59:40.600 --> 02:59:42.560
to be podcast it's done everyone at the

02:59:42.560 --> 02:59:45.720
table would need a microphone now I get

02:59:45.720 --> 02:59:48.600
some good food mics well that or and

02:59:48.600 --> 02:59:51.960
you'd have to have the die cam you see

02:59:51.960 --> 02:59:53.280
them rolling and see who's cheating at

02:59:53.280 --> 02:59:55.280
the table oh and I didn't nudge that

02:59:55.280 --> 02:59:58.640
that was I sneezed Jamie just rolled a

02:59:58.640 --> 03:00:02.520
seven on the 20-sided die so this means

03:00:02.520 --> 03:00:04.360
that she has failed her intelligence

03:00:04.360 --> 03:00:13.760
check please which would be really sad given that you know if I failed an

03:00:13.760 --> 03:00:17.840
intelligence check with a seven given that I know okay that's really giving it

03:00:17.840 --> 03:00:19.840
away but but for real although I will say

03:00:19.840 --> 03:00:21.840
this as much as I am teasing Jim Sally

03:00:21.840 --> 03:00:22.940
with the idea of starting his own show

03:00:22.940 --> 03:00:24.840
involved we do like to look for

03:00:24.840 --> 03:00:27.280
established shows we we want something

03:00:27.280 --> 03:00:29.320
to kind of go off of like we need a

03:00:29.320 --> 03:00:30.800
couple episodes under your belt so we

03:00:30.800 --> 03:00:32.320
know you're serious about it because we

03:00:32.320 --> 03:00:33.760
are not looking for shows that are gonna

03:00:33.760 --> 03:00:35.920
do it for two weeks and then quit that

03:00:35.920 --> 03:00:38.280
would be the problem so anyhow anyhow

03:00:38.280 --> 03:00:40.160
why don't you leave the microphone on

03:00:40.160 --> 03:00:41.760
today when you leave but I'll go do some

03:00:41.760 --> 03:00:44.680

the ones with the gigantic splash screen

03:03:09.640 --> 03:03:11.240
so obviously tiger claw linked me to a

03:03:11.240 --> 03:03:13.160
game spot article oh but there's a call

03:03:13.160 --> 03:03:14.400
coming in so you'll just have to wait

03:03:14.400 --> 03:03:16.360
and see what it's about

03:03:16.360 --> 03:03:18.300

03:03:25.040 --> 03:03:31.000
up stir luck not too much I don't know

03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:34.560
if you talked about the Vita firmware

03:03:34.560 --> 03:03:37.560
update in part a I kind of missed a lot

03:03:37.560 --> 03:03:39.480
of it briefly it let off our rapid-fire

03:03:39.480 --> 03:03:42.200
news tonight but go ahead it was we talk

03:03:42.200 --> 03:03:43.560
quickly about it so what do you want to

03:03:43.560 --> 03:03:46.600
say about it um well it kind of makes me

03:03:46.600 --> 03:03:49.480
want a Vita now what what a firmware

03:03:49.480 --> 03:03:51.120
update makes you want a Vita what is it

03:03:51.120 --> 03:03:52.360
about the firmware update that makes you

03:03:52.360 --> 03:03:54.960
want it because they added a feature

03:03:54.960 --> 03:03:57.160
that should have been in there from the

03:03:57.160 --> 03:04:01.680
beginning which is use of the buttons in

03:04:01.680 --> 03:04:04.640
the home screen which you would think

03:04:04.640 --> 03:04:06.640
would have been in there by default but

03:04:06.640 --> 03:04:08.880
I don't know what the hell so he was

03:04:08.880 --> 03:04:10.760
thinking now something the listeners may

03:04:10.760 --> 03:04:12.480
not remember about you from previous

03:04:12.480 --> 03:04:14.080
phone calls to the show but you're blind

03:04:14.080 --> 03:04:16.720
right yep so this is something that is

03:04:16.720 --> 03:04:19.080
kind of important if you're trying to

03:04:19.080 --> 03:04:22.760
navigate that was literally I was pretty

03:04:22.760 --> 03:04:24.280
stoked for the Vita when I heard about

03:04:24.280 --> 03:04:26.040
some of the games that were coming to it

03:04:26.040 --> 03:04:31.160
especially like Mortal Kombat something

03:04:31.160 --> 03:04:34.240
like sound shapes too is awesome you know

03:04:34.240 --> 03:04:36.560
I think I think even being you know with

03:04:36.560 --> 03:04:38.560
blind the way you kind of interact with

03:04:38.560 --> 03:04:40.120
the sounds and the fact that the sounds

03:04:40.120 --> 03:04:41.800
kind of drive the stage a little bit I

03:04:41.800 --> 03:04:44.320
think you'd get a kick out of it um okay

03:04:44.320 --> 03:04:48.280
to have um how prevalent is the

03:04:48.280 --> 03:04:49.720
touchscreen and sound chips I don't

03:04:49.720 --> 03:04:51.280
really done a lot of research into it or

03:04:51.280 --> 03:04:52.800
is it all button-based you don't have to

03:04:52.800 --> 03:04:54.480
use it at all if you want to design

03:04:54.480 --> 03:04:56.360
stages you have to use it a little bit

03:04:56.360 --> 03:04:58.840
but if you interesting when I have to

03:04:58.840 --> 03:05:00.640
check that one out I think I think you

03:05:00.640 --> 03:05:02.440
get a kick out of it I'm also a big fan

03:05:02.440 --> 03:05:05.720
of the Riven rhythm heaven slash Tengoku

03:05:05.720 --> 03:05:12.560
series on the GBA and DS and we most

03:05:12.560 --> 03:05:14.600
recently those are pretty awesome do you

03:05:14.600 --> 03:05:17.360
think that maybe Sony realized you know

03:05:17.360 --> 03:05:19.440
oops we're not really being

03:05:19.440 --> 03:05:22.080
accommodating all people I know some

03:05:22.080 --> 03:05:24.760
people that did send letters to them

03:05:24.760 --> 03:05:28.880
about it and not all of them being blind

03:05:28.880 --> 03:05:31.200
I've heard even a lot of sighted people

03:05:31.200 --> 03:05:35.160
bitching so it's it's not just a blind

03:05:35.160 --> 03:05:37.280
thing it's a convenience thing also it is

03:05:37.280 --> 03:05:39.480
true like sometimes you don't like you

03:05:39.480 --> 03:05:42.000
don't need to be all touchy-feely with

03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:44.120
the game system like sometimes it's it's

03:05:44.120 --> 03:05:46.800
fine to let me put it this way I like my

03:05:46.800 --> 03:05:49.000
buttons one of the bitches I had about

03:05:49.000 --> 03:05:51.240
sound shapes on the Vita was that it

03:05:51.240 --> 03:05:54.280
wasn't nearly as precise on the Vita in

03:05:54.280 --> 03:05:56.600
in the design phase the game phase is

03:05:56.600 --> 03:05:58.360
fine but the design phase isn't nearly

03:05:58.360 --> 03:05:59.840
as precise on the Vita because you have

03:05:59.840 --> 03:06:01.920
to use like that back touch panel to

03:06:01.920 --> 03:06:03.920
like stretch things and you know put

03:06:03.920 --> 03:06:05.720
them where you want and stuff and it

03:06:05.720 --> 03:06:07.640
kind of stinks but when you play on the

03:06:07.640 --> 03:06:09.760
PlayStation 3 you can use the controller

03:06:09.760 --> 03:06:12.040
and you get that precision much more

03:06:12.040 --> 03:06:14.480
with the analog sticks yeah yeah it's

03:06:14.480 --> 03:06:17.040
much better so that was you know pretty

03:06:17.040 --> 03:06:20.520
awesome a bitch of mine so yeah all

03:06:20.520 --> 03:06:22.160
right well stir lock anything else you

03:06:22.160 --> 03:06:25.000
want to share a listeners tonight um I

03:06:25.000 --> 03:06:27.440
don't know I was just having random

03:06:27.440 --> 03:06:30.760
thoughts actually I don't remember where

03:06:30.760 --> 03:06:33.160
I found it now but Jim Sally was talking

03:06:33.160 --> 03:06:36.440
about like D&D sessions and like podcast

03:06:36.440 --> 03:06:38.320
worm I've seen that done before and it's

03:06:38.320 --> 03:06:40.040
pretty awesome it is it is I would love

03:06:40.040 --> 03:06:42.280
to get a show like that on that would be

03:06:42.280 --> 03:06:45.160
funny though like doing the whole you

03:06:45.160 --> 03:06:47.720
know World Series of Poker style

03:06:47.720 --> 03:06:50.000
commentary like Dark Sakura has deployed

03:06:50.000 --> 03:06:53.560
her 20-sided die she's currently

03:06:53.560 --> 03:06:58.400
attempting her saving throw I was low

03:06:58.400 --> 03:07:02.680
and she didn't quite make it I would

03:07:02.680 --> 03:07:04.560
love it but you know we'll have to we'll

03:07:04.560 --> 03:07:05.720
have to see what's out there because you

03:07:05.720 --> 03:07:07.560
know as Bobby's emphasizing in chat we

03:07:07.560 --> 03:07:09.220
are kind of looking for shows that are

03:07:09.220 --> 03:07:11.640
already you know because we don't really

03:07:11.640 --> 03:07:13.240
want to bring on show again it's all

03:07:13.240 --> 03:07:14.680
about you know people might have an idea

03:07:14.680 --> 03:07:16.320
and like oh I want to do this I want to

03:07:16.320 --> 03:07:18.240
do this but then they don't realize how

03:07:18.240 --> 03:07:20.400
hard it really is there's a lot of work

03:07:20.400 --> 03:07:23.240
that goes into it is doing something I

03:07:23.240 --> 03:07:27.640
mean I do a I do a little shameless plug

03:07:27.640 --> 03:07:32.320

was a little light on the call tonight I

03:08:42.120 --> 03:08:43.760

03:08:43.760 --> 03:08:45.360

an email mailbag at orange lounge radio

03:08:49.640 --> 03:08:51.880
calm let me get back real quick to that

03:08:51.880 --> 03:08:54.120
tweet that I mentioned from Tiger claw

03:08:54.120 --> 03:08:56.480
will close out with this tonight dice

03:08:56.480 --> 03:08:59.560
the battlefield developer afraid to

03:08:59.560 --> 03:09:03.040
release battlefield 3 mod tools they

03:09:03.040 --> 03:09:06.840
said at GDC Europe that apparently the

03:09:06.840 --> 03:09:09.120
studio was fearful of the implications

03:09:09.120 --> 03:09:12.200
of releasing the mod tools let's see they

03:09:12.200 --> 03:09:14.160
were quote and this is a quote from

03:09:14.160 --> 03:09:17.360
Magnus Trudson who is the general

03:09:17.360 --> 03:09:21.160
manager of dice said quote afraid of all

03:09:21.160 --> 03:09:23.400
the things that can come with releasing

03:09:23.400 --> 03:09:26.640
the code quote if we do mod support we

03:09:26.640 --> 03:09:28.880
want to do it really really well we are

03:09:28.880 --> 03:09:32.120
not ready to do this yet interesting I

03:09:32.120 --> 03:09:34.520
guess oh and also that if the mods come

03:09:34.520 --> 03:09:37.120
out they want console players in two I

03:09:37.120 --> 03:09:38.800
think that part's kind of interesting as

03:09:38.800 --> 03:09:40.120
well is that they don't want to just

03:09:40.120 --> 03:09:42.560
just let it be for PC they want console

03:09:42.560 --> 03:09:44.480
players to get in on the fun that's kind

03:09:44.480 --> 03:09:48.720
of nice pretty cool all right I have a

03:09:48.720 --> 03:09:50.840
couple I have a couple last-minute

03:09:50.840 --> 03:09:52.720

03:09:52.720 --> 03:09:54.840
them there's a couple tweets here from

03:09:54.840 --> 03:09:57.680
ratchet 1785 on Twitter they literally

03:09:57.680 --> 03:09:59.240
came in one minute ago so I'll go ahead

03:09:59.240 --> 03:10:01.720

03:10:06.360 --> 03:10:08.080
best three-year listener well howdy

you there live dot vog network calm are

03:10:14.120 --> 03:10:15.720
you guys excited about Borderlands 2 I

03:10:15.720 --> 03:10:19.480
don't even have to ask Loki I I don't

03:10:19.480 --> 03:10:21.040
know if excited is the right word but

03:10:21.040 --> 03:10:23.280
I'm highly curious about Borderlands 2

03:10:23.280 --> 03:10:24.840
because I liked what I played of

03:10:24.840 --> 03:10:27.400
Borderlands 1 I really need to play more

03:10:27.400 --> 03:10:31.520
of it so yeah I'm I will check it out

03:10:31.520 --> 03:10:33.280
and I like some of the things they're

03:10:33.280 --> 03:10:35.240
doing with it I don't like that whole

03:10:35.240 --> 03:10:36.960
mess earlier this week about the whole

03:10:36.960 --> 03:10:38.840
girlfriend mode and all that crap that

03:10:38.840 --> 03:10:40.480
was going around but I'm just gonna

03:10:40.480 --> 03:10:43.720
chalk a lot of that up to the media and

03:10:43.720 --> 03:10:45.640
Twitter and the internet kind of

03:10:45.640 --> 03:10:47.160
latching on to one thing and then

03:10:47.160 --> 03:10:49.000
running with it and it's not going to

03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:50.600
affect the quality of the game I think

03:10:50.600 --> 03:10:52.400
at the end of the day the way that

03:10:52.400 --> 03:10:54.200
they're doing like an easy mode tree

03:10:54.200 --> 03:10:56.500
that sounds great to me that's not a

03:10:56.500 --> 03:10:58.880

03:12:07.120 --> 03:12:09.960
that I tweeted about evil lot they're

03:12:09.960 --> 03:12:12.000
having a contest on their site and

03:12:12.000 --> 03:12:13.640
whoever gets the most retweets gets a

03:12:13.640 --> 03:12:16.040
picture drawn by one of the artists and

03:12:16.040 --> 03:12:18.560
she does really kick-ass art so I would

03:12:18.560 --> 03:12:20.920
like I would like a picture because she

03:12:20.920 --> 03:12:22.440
