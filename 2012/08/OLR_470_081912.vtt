WEBVTT

00:11.129 --> 00:12.310
[SPEAKER_04]: and Loki.

00:14.072 --> 00:24.260
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight, August 19, 2012, we run down the news from Gamescom, the 3DS XL is released and the Neo Geo console is set to be released all over again.

00:31.604 --> 00:37.346
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.406 --> 00:49.291
[SPEAKER_03]: It is Orange Lounge Radio live at the Voice of Geeks Network, VOGnetwork.com for this August 19th, 2012 with the 470th episode of our program.

00:49.791 --> 00:50.672
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts.

00:50.692 --> 00:56.794
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about everything going on in the world of gaming and then some with my co-hosts.

00:56.994 --> 00:59.535
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

00:59.735 --> 01:00.055
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

01:00.256 --> 01:00.816
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you, ma'am?

01:01.696 --> 01:02.977
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sore.

01:03.377 --> 01:03.737
[SPEAKER_07]: Sore?

01:04.518 --> 01:04.778
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

01:05.218 --> 01:06.799
[SPEAKER_03]: What have you been doing that's made you sore?

01:06.959 --> 01:09.581
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, hey, what kind of girl do you think I am?

01:09.981 --> 01:10.982
[SPEAKER_03]: A DDR playing girl?

01:11.062 --> 01:11.742
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, actually.

01:11.882 --> 01:12.883
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:13.383 --> 01:14.224
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll touch on that in a minute.

01:14.344 --> 01:14.964
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, fair enough.

01:15.284 --> 01:16.765
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello as well to Tech Master Loki.

01:17.186 --> 01:17.346
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

01:17.586 --> 01:18.226
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing, Loki?

01:18.386 --> 01:18.766
[SPEAKER_11]: Doing good.

01:19.147 --> 01:19.467
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

01:19.507 --> 01:26.091
[SPEAKER_03]: So what food won the, for those that play the home game of betting on what you bring in for food every week, what won this week?

01:26.400 --> 01:27.921
[SPEAKER_11]: The Double Western at Carl's Jr.

01:28.081 --> 01:29.362
[SPEAKER_11]: or Hardee's on the East Coast.

01:30.383 --> 01:30.824
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

01:31.404 --> 01:31.724
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:32.545 --> 01:39.130
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, the always present fourth guest on our show is you guys at our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

01:39.170 --> 01:42.413
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll be reading some of the comments from our chat room throughout the night.

01:42.753 --> 01:44.615
[SPEAKER_03]: So be sure to get in there so you can participate with us.

01:45.195 --> 01:46.416
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the three of us in studio.

01:46.436 --> 01:48.676
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first show in a little while, it seems like, with no guests.

01:49.136 --> 01:49.837
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little lonely.

01:49.857 --> 01:51.437
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little lonely and sad in here tonight.

01:51.877 --> 01:53.638
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know how we're going to top last week's episode.

01:53.658 --> 01:54.598
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a pretty good episode.

01:54.878 --> 01:56.479
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll try, though.

01:57.359 --> 01:59.340
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll bring our best C game tonight.

02:00.520 --> 02:01.121
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you know what?

02:01.141 --> 02:06.664
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually have some awesome things tonight that are... We could point a webcam at my boobs or something, I don't know.

02:06.684 --> 02:08.826
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the webcam's in the other... No, you took the webcam, didn't you?

02:08.846 --> 02:09.306
[SPEAKER_03]: I did take it.

02:09.586 --> 02:10.587
[SPEAKER_03]: And it works.

02:10.787 --> 02:13.909
[SPEAKER_03]: You confiscated it, so no booby cam tonight.

02:13.929 --> 02:17.892
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's so unfortunate that your Dell Millie doesn't have a webcam built into it.

02:18.012 --> 02:18.812
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wait, it does!

02:18.912 --> 02:20.773
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true, I do have my iPad.

02:21.274 --> 02:21.554
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

02:21.754 --> 02:23.095
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Ustream app on the iPad.

02:23.235 --> 02:27.298
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've made sure that the webcam stuff is disabled on my laptop.

02:28.178 --> 02:30.840
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I deleted all the Windows shit and have the Linux shit.

02:31.721 --> 02:31.941
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:31.981 --> 02:34.863
[SPEAKER_03]: In all seriousness, we have some fun stuff going on tonight.

02:35.624 --> 02:39.987
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a soundtrack preview going on tonight, which is pretty cool.

02:40.247 --> 02:42.248
[SPEAKER_03]: From the Darksiders 2 soundtrack.

02:42.729 --> 02:45.291
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is going to be both for the podcast listeners and the live listeners.

02:45.631 --> 02:48.253
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks to Something Music, S-U-M thing.

02:48.533 --> 02:50.074
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll talk more about that later on.

02:50.134 --> 02:54.858
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's all sorts of information on where you can get the soundtrack at our website, vognetwork.com.

02:55.638 --> 03:03.805
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, the Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com is the website where we tape our show live for you kids every Sunday night at 6 p.m.

03:03.845 --> 03:11.511
[SPEAKER_03]: Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after our pal Bobby Blackwolf with his show, The Bobby Blackwolf Show, at 5 Pacific, 8 Eastern, every Sunday.

03:11.831 --> 03:14.974
[SPEAKER_03]: And lots of other great shows at the Voice of Geeks Network as well.

03:15.254 --> 03:19.416
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just gaming shows, but shows about TV talk, like Critical Myth.

03:19.436 --> 03:20.617
[SPEAKER_03]: They do some movies as well.

03:20.897 --> 03:23.919
[SPEAKER_03]: British Invaders, kind of a similar thing, but with a very British twist.

03:24.219 --> 03:26.500
[SPEAKER_03]: PodCulture is awesome.

03:26.560 --> 03:28.341
[SPEAKER_03]: And PodCulture's got something special tomorrow.

03:28.361 --> 03:29.702
[SPEAKER_03]: They're back with an all-new episode.

03:29.722 --> 03:30.823
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been off for a couple weeks.

03:31.483 --> 03:35.425
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are talking to somebody who's publishing a series of books.

03:36.146 --> 03:41.269
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not sure if I'm supposed to say this, so a little preview.

03:41.649 --> 03:43.010
[SPEAKER_03]: They're actually doing a giveaway.

03:43.030 --> 03:43.290
[SPEAKER_03]: Oop.

03:44.650 --> 03:47.191
[SPEAKER_03]: Be sure to tune in and check that out at PodCulture.

03:47.511 --> 03:48.391
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of other great shows too.

03:48.411 --> 03:50.332
[SPEAKER_03]: Anime Jam Session, Girls Gone Wild, Horde House.

03:50.952 --> 03:51.692
[SPEAKER_03]: Horde House is okay.

03:53.713 --> 03:55.833
[SPEAKER_03]: But the rest of the shows are great.

03:56.693 --> 03:56.993
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

03:57.774 --> 04:01.875
[SPEAKER_03]: We usually start off the show talking about our gaming weeks, but we usually have a kickoff topic.

04:03.155 --> 04:05.395
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought I'd bring up something that's a little bit recurring.

04:05.595 --> 04:05.936
[SPEAKER_03]: Crack!

04:07.256 --> 04:09.836
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the first time we talked about crack on the show?

04:10.397 --> 04:11.157
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do drugs, kids.

04:11.177 --> 04:11.597
[SPEAKER_03]: Drugs are bad.

04:12.197 --> 04:18.560
[SPEAKER_03]: So, okay, y'all know we have a little bit of a history with Kickstarter and kind of like talking about that site.

04:18.640 --> 04:21.602
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're not always a fan of a lot of the things we see on Kickstarter.

04:21.642 --> 04:24.843
[SPEAKER_03]: At least I should say, I'm not always a fan of a lot of the stuff I see on Kickstarter.

04:25.124 --> 04:28.185
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura has not always been a fan of the stuff she sees on Kickstarter.

04:28.565 --> 04:31.427
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki has contributed way too many Kickstarters.

04:32.087 --> 04:32.807
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't that many.

04:33.788 --> 04:34.188
[SPEAKER_03]: How many?

04:34.628 --> 04:34.989
[SPEAKER_03]: How many?

04:35.049 --> 04:35.909
[SPEAKER_03]: How many is not that many?

04:35.949 --> 04:37.790
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at least five, right?

04:40.009 --> 04:40.450
[SPEAKER_11]: See?

04:41.591 --> 04:41.851
[SPEAKER_11]: See?

04:42.091 --> 04:42.812
[SPEAKER_11]: Seven, I'm sorry.

04:43.012 --> 04:44.193
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, here's the point.

04:45.655 --> 04:47.317
[SPEAKER_03]: I donated to a Kickstarter this week.

04:47.597 --> 04:49.679
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually finally joined the website.

04:50.540 --> 04:51.821
[SPEAKER_03]: I signed up for Kickstarter.

04:52.722 --> 04:54.464
[SPEAKER_03]: It was to expand the Mantis website.

04:54.484 --> 04:54.785
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

04:54.805 --> 04:55.665
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

04:56.426 --> 04:57.087
[SPEAKER_03]: Heck no.

04:57.667 --> 04:58.528
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, make that nine.

04:58.748 --> 04:59.448
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

04:59.528 --> 05:00.609
[SPEAKER_03]: Nine Kickstarters?

05:01.009 --> 05:04.431
[SPEAKER_06]: Suddenly this week... You know, you can just take that money and give it to me and I'll put it to better use.

05:04.692 --> 05:07.794
[SPEAKER_03]: This week from maybe five to nine?

05:08.054 --> 05:09.175
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there's some I forgot.

05:09.255 --> 05:11.957
[SPEAKER_11]: I forgot about those playing cards.

05:12.537 --> 05:14.018
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are awesome.

05:14.178 --> 05:15.719
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan was like, wow, that's cool.

05:15.799 --> 05:18.881
[SPEAKER_11]: I forgot about the Megaran thing, which I'm still waiting on.

05:18.941 --> 05:20.642
[SPEAKER_11]: There's apparently the comic coming too.

05:20.802 --> 05:23.824
[SPEAKER_11]: And then Shadowrun Returns.

05:24.145 --> 05:25.425
[SPEAKER_11]: Shadowrun Returns would be awesome.

05:25.526 --> 05:26.046
[SPEAKER_11]: Can't wait for that.

05:26.606 --> 05:31.391
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so I actually donated to a Kickstarter this week.

05:32.091 --> 05:38.337
[SPEAKER_03]: I even went so far as to donate $180 to this Kickstarter.

05:38.457 --> 05:39.858
[SPEAKER_03]: $180 to this Kickstarter.

05:40.379 --> 05:42.100
[SPEAKER_03]: Cue dramatic chipmunk.

05:42.741 --> 05:43.422
[SPEAKER_03]: Or prairie dog.

05:43.442 --> 05:43.722
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

05:47.978 --> 05:51.019
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing like a meme from five years ago to lighten the mood.

05:52.239 --> 05:55.040
[SPEAKER_03]: I gave $180 to the GamerCon Kickstarter.

05:55.521 --> 05:57.721
[SPEAKER_03]: The G-A-Y GamerCon Kickstarter.

05:59.702 --> 06:00.742
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a great idea.

06:00.922 --> 06:08.625
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can totally see where being a startup event, they really need the money to be able to reserve the venue and do something big.

06:08.845 --> 06:10.446
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been great promotion for them.

06:10.526 --> 06:13.847
[SPEAKER_03]: And as somebody who's a gamer myself, it's something I want to support.

06:14.207 --> 06:17.328
[SPEAKER_03]: So Alan kind of made it known that he wouldn't mind going and

06:17.848 --> 06:18.709
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't mind going.

06:20.170 --> 06:21.871
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm going to do this, I'm going to do it big.

06:22.211 --> 06:23.492
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't do anything half-assed.

06:23.772 --> 06:26.554
[SPEAKER_03]: So I threw down for VIP passes for both Alan and I. It sent me back $180.

06:27.795 --> 06:29.637
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, there you go.

06:29.897 --> 06:31.098
[SPEAKER_03]: I donated to a Kickstarter.

06:31.991 --> 06:32.271
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

07:02.491 --> 07:07.494
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not that... If I can get the boobies in there, that'd be kind of cool.

07:07.514 --> 07:08.034
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing.

07:08.054 --> 07:09.035
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet there is a boob con.

07:09.055 --> 07:09.695
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to look for it.

07:09.815 --> 07:10.616
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing.

07:10.816 --> 07:16.138
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, boob con is every other gaming convention, and there'll probably be some boob con at GamerCon.

07:16.539 --> 07:18.120
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's not forget the lesbians.

07:18.220 --> 07:19.400
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a boob con.

07:20.621 --> 07:22.802
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's... Oh, it's a Facebook utility.

07:24.083 --> 07:25.423
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole thing is that...

07:28.292 --> 07:33.994
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the idea of having this event and to bring gay gamers together because I've met a lot of really cool people.

07:34.074 --> 07:39.196
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my really good friends I met at a gay gamer event in the Bay Area, and we're friends to this day.

07:39.256 --> 07:44.638
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend Spike, who is one of the co-hosts on Game Boy, we met at one of those gay gamer parties.

07:45.258 --> 07:49.259
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not that straight people are forbidden from coming.

07:49.619 --> 07:53.701
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I'm sure Dark Sakura is going to pre-order as soon as she's got them.

07:54.021 --> 07:57.522
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as she has her Kickstarter funded, she's going to pre-order a ticket to GamerCon, right?

07:57.802 --> 07:58.082
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd go.

07:58.383 --> 07:58.583
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

07:58.903 --> 08:02.247
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know that I'd be able to afford, you know, $90 tickets.

08:02.267 --> 08:05.431
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to be shunned because you have boobies and you're not going to be shunned.

08:05.451 --> 08:06.813
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just wear a shirt that says hag.

08:10.037 --> 08:15.724
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the other thing is that, you know, obviously...

08:16.861 --> 08:31.409
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how far I want to go with this like this controversial topic or whatever but in the gaming culture you know a lot of times gay guys and ladies have to put up with all this garbage we hear on Xbox Live and you know

08:32.009 --> 08:33.511
[SPEAKER_03]: Fag, fag, fag.

08:33.772 --> 08:34.793
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not like we're alone.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.716
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of racist stuff that happens.

08:36.736 --> 08:40.342
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of really bad things that happen on Xbox Live.

08:40.362 --> 08:41.704
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you think I only play with you guys?

08:41.804 --> 08:46.691
[SPEAKER_03]: And everything negative usually has some type of connotation to like, oh, so-and-so's a fag.

08:47.560 --> 08:55.263
[SPEAKER_11]: It's because the people that play on Xbox Live and actually just a lot of people that play games nowadays online are very unintelligent and young.

08:55.723 --> 09:03.285
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that for a fact from the modding community that I talk to these people directly and it's like, can you guys compose an actual sentence without sounding stupid?

09:03.745 --> 09:11.228
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, can you compose a sentence that actually makes sense that doesn't have any sort of complete misspellings of everything?

09:11.823 --> 09:12.243
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

09:34.045 --> 09:38.951
[SPEAKER_03]: In the gay culture, even, people are like, oh, you play video games all day?

09:39.132 --> 09:43.077
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean you don't like to... Accessorize?

09:43.898 --> 09:50.767
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't like to go to concerts, or you don't listen to such and such artist, or you don't read such and such blogs, or a lot of those types of things.

09:51.588 --> 09:52.648
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

09:54.069 --> 09:57.212
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this might be a thing I'm not supposed to say, but it's true.

09:57.612 --> 09:59.634
[SPEAKER_03]: I have faced some of that in the gay culture.

10:00.034 --> 10:17.188
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's tough sometimes because you don't feel like you fit in column A. You don't feel like you fit in column B. So I think it's really awesome that there's a lot of people raising their voice thanks to the internet that feel like they kind of don't fit in these columns and having a convention to just celebrate

10:18.072 --> 10:18.512
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here.

10:18.972 --> 10:27.216
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think the con exists to make a statement or the con exists to further the cause or whatever.

10:27.336 --> 10:29.537
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the con exists to have fun.

10:30.097 --> 10:31.158
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I plan to do.

10:31.598 --> 10:35.240
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have a gay old time and gay isn't happy.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.620
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have a gay old time.

10:37.701 --> 10:38.501
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a good time.

10:40.082 --> 10:40.502
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean...

10:42.259 --> 10:44.600
[SPEAKER_06]: The only other equivalent is YaoiCon, really.

10:45.101 --> 10:45.661
[SPEAKER_03]: And YaoiCon exists.

10:45.721 --> 10:46.862
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's more for girls.

10:49.963 --> 10:57.468
[SPEAKER_03]: I think GamerCon is just for anybody that just wants to have fun in a supportive environment.

10:57.608 --> 10:59.489
[SPEAKER_06]: And besides that, you were talking about Columns.

10:59.569 --> 11:00.189
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck Columns.

11:00.429 --> 11:01.150
[SPEAKER_06]: That game was shit.

11:02.498 --> 11:02.859
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

11:03.219 --> 11:13.634
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that the moment we can move past labels and pointing fingers is why, you know, when anyone says, well, I have this or I am this.

11:13.714 --> 11:16.538
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, you look like you're a human being to me.

11:17.381 --> 11:17.762
[SPEAKER_06]: Actlikeit

11:34.740 --> 11:37.501
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you, just letter you, get it to work?

11:37.561 --> 11:38.521
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, that makes sense.

11:38.881 --> 11:39.341
[SPEAKER_11]: How about this one?

11:39.961 --> 11:41.542
[SPEAKER_11]: Should we take thing away?

11:43.322 --> 11:48.644
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, just let me know because trying to get it by today.

11:49.844 --> 11:51.365
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, that is fine.

11:51.645 --> 11:53.665
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think it is?

11:54.886 --> 11:59.867
[SPEAKER_11]: And just let me know when you get it to work.

12:00.587 --> 12:01.728
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my fucking god.

12:01.768 --> 12:02.950
[SPEAKER_11]: How is Babi formed?

12:03.630 --> 12:04.771
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, seriously.

12:05.632 --> 12:05.712
[SPEAKER_11]: It...

12:09.039 --> 12:15.765
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me go to some comments from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com where we have plenty of folks in chat participating live with us tonight.

12:15.825 --> 12:18.347
[SPEAKER_03]: JV Mon wants to know, where is GamerCon anyway?

12:18.688 --> 12:19.829
[SPEAKER_03]: They haven't picked a venue yet.

12:19.929 --> 12:21.090
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be in San Francisco.

12:21.150 --> 12:23.352
[SPEAKER_03]: They've said that much, but we don't know what venue.

12:23.372 --> 12:24.873
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that could be a lot of different places.

12:24.933 --> 12:26.094
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be a hotel.

12:26.154 --> 12:26.875
[SPEAKER_03]: They could do it at the Hilton.

12:27.115 --> 12:29.097
[SPEAKER_03]: They could do it at the Moscone Center if they get enough money.

12:29.537 --> 12:31.399
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where they're going to have it yet.

12:31.939 --> 12:35.042
[SPEAKER_03]: So more to come on that, but it will be in San Francisco somewhere.

12:35.722 --> 12:36.543
[SPEAKER_03]: ACIDICVAMPIRE in chat says...

12:56.140 --> 13:07.337
[SPEAKER_03]: Ragenator says sadly enough when someone proclaims that they're a gamer to someone the other person immediately pictures a fat balding middle-aged slob eating Cheetos in their mom's basement and never goes outside

13:08.598 --> 13:10.198
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I like Cheetos, just for the record.

13:11.439 --> 13:17.821
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, I mean, exactly the point is that, you know, there's kind of these, like, stereotypes, and it's throughout all of our cultures.

13:18.941 --> 13:20.701
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of Cheetos, you know what's wrong with Cheetos?

13:20.961 --> 13:22.382
[SPEAKER_11]: Is they have those giant Cheetos.

13:22.702 --> 13:29.924
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, really, the cheese powder to whatever else Cheetos are made out of ratio is just fucked up by that.

13:29.944 --> 13:30.064
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean...

13:31.710 --> 13:34.011
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Loki, any chance that you would go to GamerCon?

13:34.231 --> 13:36.692
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably not, because I'm not really allowed to travel right now.

13:38.573 --> 13:41.955
[SPEAKER_11]: But what if you told the wife it was a gay gamer convention?

13:42.015 --> 13:42.475
[SPEAKER_03]: She'd laugh.

13:42.515 --> 13:43.275
[SPEAKER_03]: She would get a kick out of that.

13:43.295 --> 13:47.077
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, she'd probably laugh at that, because... We should try to get a panel.

13:47.157 --> 13:47.777
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love that.

13:48.578 --> 13:49.818
[SPEAKER_03]: Would she let you go if we had a panel?

13:50.038 --> 13:51.319
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps, yeah.

13:51.619 --> 13:51.959
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

13:51.999 --> 13:52.759
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally get us a panel.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.140
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what we can do.

13:54.220 --> 13:54.560
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

13:55.261 --> 13:55.901
[SPEAKER_06]: And free tickets.

13:58.007 --> 13:59.228
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, moving on.

13:59.488 --> 14:03.312
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week, and how was your gaming week?

14:03.392 --> 14:05.073
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, you hinted at this a minute ago.

14:05.093 --> 14:05.974
[SPEAKER_06]: I played The Ditter.

14:07.896 --> 14:08.776
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, this is what happened.

14:09.437 --> 14:11.379
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Dance Dance Revolution for the uninformed.

14:11.439 --> 14:11.639
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

14:12.840 --> 14:20.146
[SPEAKER_06]: I was working at this place, and everyone knows I got laid off, but it was an amicable breakup.

14:20.306 --> 14:20.967
[SPEAKER_06]: Amicable breakup.

14:22.284 --> 14:27.506
[SPEAKER_06]: I still got to go to the company picnic, which was at Golfland on some corporate picnic day.

14:28.227 --> 14:32.788
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, there were still a bunch of annoying teenagers, but it was okay.

14:32.948 --> 14:37.650
[SPEAKER_06]: But you got one of those little bracelets that let you get go-karts and a laser tag, which I didn't do either.

14:39.091 --> 14:41.712
[SPEAKER_06]: And get in the water park, which I didn't do either.

14:41.732 --> 14:41.792
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

14:44.733 --> 14:45.613
[SPEAKER_06]: We just went in and had a good time.

14:45.633 --> 14:49.374
[SPEAKER_06]: But while we were waiting for lunch to be served, I went inside to go play some DDR.

14:49.714 --> 14:51.794
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we also got 20 credits on one of those little cards.

14:53.255 --> 14:55.275
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there were already three credits in the DDR.

14:55.295 --> 14:57.736
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm like, I'll play them all.

14:58.296 --> 14:59.396
[SPEAKER_06]: It was on four songs.

15:00.216 --> 15:04.537
[SPEAKER_06]: So I played 12 songs back to back and decided that I'm going to finish out with Superstar.

15:04.557 --> 15:06.478
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, damn it, I'm not old.

15:06.538 --> 15:07.058
[SPEAKER_06]: I can still do it.

15:07.078 --> 15:09.678
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I did fail Cowgirl, which is very sad.

15:09.698 --> 15:11.099
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that used to be one of my best ones.

15:11.319 --> 15:12.239
[SPEAKER_06]: Bang, ba-doo, bang.

15:12.479 --> 15:12.759
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

15:13.899 --> 15:31.174
[SPEAKER_06]: and I've made it through that and by the time I got done I felt like I needed to throw up because I was hot and I hadn't done anything strenuous like that in a while and that's the point where you realized I was in my DDR prime 10 years ago when I weighed 30 pounds more than I do now which is sad

15:33.155 --> 15:39.961
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, I went and had a good time at lunch and I felt better once I ate something and had a good time.

15:39.981 --> 15:43.904
[SPEAKER_06]: And my BFF forever, Specky, was there with the boy and her hubby.

15:44.324 --> 15:45.145
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, they're listening.

15:46.326 --> 15:46.746
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Ro.

15:47.206 --> 15:47.567
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Ro.

15:48.047 --> 15:52.711
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had a really good time and Dan and I played copious amounts of Tank Tank Tank.

15:53.251 --> 15:56.313
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's this other game too that I... Are you guys going to pick that up on Wii U?

15:57.194 --> 15:57.895
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it coming out?

15:58.015 --> 16:02.417
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Tank Tank Tank is going to be one of the launch games for Wii U. I don't know if we're getting a Wii U, but I fucking want that game, so maybe we will.

16:03.058 --> 16:05.439
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'm trying to find the name of this game.

16:05.599 --> 16:08.261
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, it's a Sega game called Let's Go Island.

16:09.122 --> 16:10.783
[SPEAKER_06]: Lost on the Island of Tropics.

16:11.463 --> 16:13.624
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a shooter game where you're on a...

16:14.645 --> 16:16.226
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

16:37.253 --> 16:49.041
[SPEAKER_06]: it's great and then like when you finish each like the last like the boss of the first level is this huge mungus squid and you also have to jerk your controller in a certain way to get past these little cut scenes it's pretty cute but um

16:49.810 --> 16:56.457
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds all sorts of like... How was that game called?

16:57.118 --> 16:58.359
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, well, they totally interrupted that.

16:58.719 --> 16:59.901
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of their gun shooting games.

16:59.961 --> 17:00.621
[SPEAKER_11]: It was really awesome.

17:00.641 --> 17:02.764
[SPEAKER_11]: I love that it was on the Wii and also in the arcade.

17:02.844 --> 17:04.125
[SPEAKER_06]: Freaking Sega, of course.

17:05.166 --> 17:08.670
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, it... What was I saying?

17:08.710 --> 17:08.910
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

17:09.230 --> 17:12.113
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you finish the level, though, it does a compatibility meter.

17:12.734 --> 17:13.955
[SPEAKER_06]: to see how compatible you are.

17:13.975 --> 17:15.315
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dan and I were 60%.

17:17.456 --> 17:24.679
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's also funny when you shoot the same things, it gives you this like twin bonus and you get little hearts and everything flowing out of it.

17:25.140 --> 17:29.622
[SPEAKER_06]: But like I died at the second stage and so Dan continued and he made it a little bit further.

17:30.082 --> 17:37.345
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it's like when you get like less than 10% compatibility, it says you wouldn't sit next to him on the bus.

17:38.025 --> 17:39.146
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, wow, that's kind of cold.

17:39.466 --> 17:45.149
[SPEAKER_06]: and then I played more DDR and Dan played with me and he's like, I forgot how to play.

17:45.429 --> 17:46.990
[SPEAKER_03]: I never ever saw Dan play DDR.

17:47.010 --> 17:48.510
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan used to play my Dreamcast one with me.

17:48.810 --> 17:48.991
[SPEAKER_03]: Fun.

17:49.031 --> 17:52.692
[SPEAKER_06]: He like, you know, he could, like the hardest he could do was like Dynamite Rave.

17:52.772 --> 17:55.033
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan was one of those guys who didn't want to admit he played DDR.

17:55.914 --> 17:56.294
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

17:56.758 --> 17:57.559
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

18:21.336 --> 18:44.703
[SPEAKER_06]: so I was like I'm out of practice so we actually discussed this we're gonna hook back up our JPS2 and start playing our DDR games again because I've got those dance pads that I got at the thrift store that were like three for six bucks and like one of them didn't work the other two did so we're gonna start playing DDR again at home good luck thanks it's all part of the plan

18:45.595 --> 18:46.355
[SPEAKER_03]: I also played more games.

19:03.959 --> 19:26.789
[SPEAKER_06]: more more games alrighty because I'm still playing through Mass Effect Mass Effect 2 for Becky with a Para FemShep and Garrus totally Garrus I'm still playing through Mass Effect 3 which I'm still at the same part that I am and every time I load it up I just get depressed and turn it back off and I want to play more multiplayer next week does it involve Morden?

19:27.770 --> 19:32.892
[SPEAKER_06]: no oh okay no I'm I already passed that I'm not Thessia oh okay oh yeah that part

19:33.712 --> 19:35.513
[SPEAKER_06]: But this time I'm taking Javik with me and not Garrus.

19:35.533 --> 19:37.294
[SPEAKER_06]: Garrus gets to stay home and not be depressed.

19:39.896 --> 19:40.777
[SPEAKER_03]: How considerate of you.

19:41.337 --> 19:44.419
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very, very considerate of Turians and their sensitive natures.

19:46.501 --> 19:49.122
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have my fourth 85 in WoW.

19:50.183 --> 19:50.443
[SPEAKER_03]: Addict.

19:51.424 --> 19:52.464
[SPEAKER_03]: Dealer, how many do you have?

19:53.045 --> 19:54.586
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my fifth this week.

19:55.747 --> 19:57.108
[SPEAKER_06]: I got my four in last time.

19:57.128 --> 19:58.609
[SPEAKER_03]: I now have two Druids at 85.

19:59.485 --> 20:02.207
[SPEAKER_06]: Leviathan is coming, the DLC for Mass Effect I know!

20:02.267 --> 20:03.147
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone's excited I am!

20:27.512 --> 20:28.613
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to check it out.

20:28.913 --> 20:30.675
[SPEAKER_03]: Why does this all have to hit the same day?

20:31.135 --> 20:35.298
[SPEAKER_03]: Leviathan, Guild Wars 2, and the big WoW patch all hit the same day.

20:35.318 --> 20:36.999
[SPEAKER_03]: How much is Leviathan going to be?

20:37.159 --> 20:37.419
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably $10.

20:38.260 --> 20:41.062
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the Vita patch is that day too.

20:41.402 --> 20:42.283
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a story on it later.

20:42.343 --> 20:42.843
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?

20:43.244 --> 20:44.284
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not playing Guild Wars.

20:45.605 --> 20:48.547
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to check it out, but at least there's no monthly fee.

20:48.567 --> 20:50.929
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Guild Wars is one of those things I can kind of look at any time.

20:51.320 --> 20:57.745
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but I mean, I've still got a... I'm probably, to be honest, not going to get the WoW thing right away.

20:58.745 --> 21:03.389
[SPEAKER_06]: Except if I ever get paid for one of my projects, maybe I'll buy it, you know, as a treat to myself.

21:05.690 --> 21:09.133
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like, while I've still got other tunes to work on, like, what's the point?

21:09.773 --> 21:10.033
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?

21:10.253 --> 21:10.494
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

21:11.394 --> 21:18.319
[SPEAKER_06]: But the thing I'm excited about for WoW is that... I know this isn't Horde House, but I'm excited that all of the races are going to be available soon.

21:20.152 --> 21:21.233
[SPEAKER_06]: from the get-go for everybody.

21:21.913 --> 21:26.435
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and that's not in our news roll tonight because I was going to save that for Horde House, which is fine.

21:26.775 --> 21:35.078
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, the big news about anybody can play any race except don't expect to play a panda next Tuesday.

21:35.219 --> 21:37.500
[SPEAKER_03]: Pandas will unlock with Pandaria.

21:38.020 --> 21:40.561
[SPEAKER_03]: However, you don't have to have Mr. Pandaria to roll a panda.

21:40.921 --> 21:42.742
[SPEAKER_03]: But you will need to go past level 85.

21:43.402 --> 21:47.705
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says...

22:06.658 --> 22:10.480
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that trailer was released this week out of Gamescom, the new World of Warcraft trailer.

22:10.781 --> 22:11.861
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked great.

22:12.462 --> 22:13.963
[SPEAKER_03]: The CGI was beautiful.

22:14.203 --> 22:19.646
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, with all this talk about a World of Warcraft movie and all this, it's like, just do that for 90 minutes.

22:19.706 --> 22:20.226
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be great.

22:20.707 --> 22:22.368
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, I have to say, overall...

22:22.728 --> 22:24.149
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a little disappointed in the trailer.

22:24.529 --> 22:31.234
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason why is that I would hope that the cinematic trailer would show a little bit of everything.

22:31.595 --> 22:37.039
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's so much beauty in this expansion in the realm of Pandaria and some of these new five mans.

22:37.059 --> 22:38.520
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't really show any of that.

22:38.720 --> 22:43.003
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to see a rendered version of the Temple of the Jade Serpent and some of that gorgeous stuff.

22:43.585 --> 22:51.508
[SPEAKER_06]: I've just been looking at data dumps for some of the internal stuff.

22:52.028 --> 22:57.570
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically people just doing run-throughs of the empty temples and the empty dungeons and everything, so this looks pretty neat.

22:58.030 --> 23:00.651
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we turn into an episode of Horde House, let's let you finish up.

23:00.671 --> 23:01.271
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll move on to Loki.

23:01.789 --> 23:29.124
[SPEAKER_06]: well I'm also very pissed off at all the people nudging me on words with friends and I'm about ready to delete it yeah I'm getting that with song pop I'm kind of over song pop now like it was fun for two weeks but now now I've moved on to another game and I can't help it and I'm glad I didn't pay for the game and I'm not paying for any of it but I still like draw something and the only reason I'm still playing is because I haven't paid for it and I'm not looking at any ads so I'm all cool I've drawn some perverted shit in that game

23:31.050 --> 23:31.931
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Loki.

23:33.792 --> 23:34.172
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

23:34.792 --> 23:43.838
[SPEAKER_11]: I played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, a little bit of that, and Minecraft, a whole lot of Minecraft.

23:44.338 --> 23:45.719
[SPEAKER_11]: Getting bored with it again.

23:46.339 --> 23:52.763
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the problem is I don't have a lot of people to play with, and that's really odd considering there's so many people that bought the game.

23:53.844 --> 23:58.728
[SPEAKER_11]: None of my friends seem to be playing games that we can join in or whatever.

23:58.868 --> 24:03.432
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm playing with my coworker and we're just like... The map that we're on, we've kind of explored everything.

24:03.452 --> 24:05.554
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to the point where I'm like, okay, fuck it.

24:05.574 --> 24:09.337
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to go ahead and start duping again because there's still a way you can dupe stuff.

24:09.357 --> 24:11.259
[SPEAKER_11]: So I duped a bunch of dynamite and just create a hole.

24:12.300 --> 24:14.082
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I was like, wow, create a crater.

24:14.882 --> 24:15.703
[SPEAKER_11]: Bored still.

24:16.023 --> 24:16.384
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like...

24:17.748 --> 24:18.729
[SPEAKER_06]: May I interject one thing?

24:18.949 --> 24:21.390
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah I saw one thing that made me love Minecraft What?

24:22.011 --> 24:27.794
[SPEAKER_06]: It was this video that someone did and lined up explosives and everything that says I love and when it exploded it said but

24:31.189 --> 24:32.450
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so mature, I love it.

24:33.491 --> 24:46.239
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that that might be, because you know, DarkSakura, if you've been listening to previous episodes, she's not very, she kind of frowns on Minecraft, but I love that I Love Butts may have cracked the door open a little bit to DarkSakura getting on the Minecraft tour.

24:46.279 --> 24:46.820
[SPEAKER_03]: Cracked the door open.

24:47.060 --> 24:48.601
[SPEAKER_03]: It cracked the door open.

24:49.021 --> 24:53.884
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm not saying it made me like the game, but it made me laugh like my ass off, like on my ass.

24:55.485 --> 25:00.769
[SPEAKER_06]: And that and seeing people making giant pigs and like Goombas and Mario and shit, that was pretty funny.

25:01.451 --> 25:05.968
[SPEAKER_11]: you do realize I have a giant pig in my map I was talking about your giant pig

25:09.406 --> 25:11.026
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, moving on.

25:12.707 --> 25:17.228
[SPEAKER_11]: I did happen to see, for example, something that was more structured to be kind of fun with other people.

25:17.548 --> 25:21.469
[SPEAKER_11]: I watched one of those Wii Play things.

25:21.749 --> 25:25.770
[SPEAKER_11]: It was with the Machinima, I think they do that.

25:26.190 --> 25:32.052
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was a bunch of people playing a survival type game where...

25:32.532 --> 25:33.113
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

25:51.388 --> 25:52.708
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was really hilarious.

25:52.728 --> 25:54.549
[SPEAKER_11]: This is like the Minecraft Hunger Games.

25:54.789 --> 25:55.909
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they have that.

25:55.949 --> 25:56.729
[SPEAKER_11]: They have that too.

25:57.570 --> 25:59.270
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is like, it was sort of like that.

25:59.690 --> 26:00.630
[SPEAKER_11]: But that looked like fun.

26:00.710 --> 26:03.231
[SPEAKER_11]: See, more of the structured stuff with like a lot of people.

26:04.071 --> 26:05.831
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds like a lot of fun with Minecraft.

26:06.132 --> 26:11.293
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, when we first started playing, it was like you, me and Bobby, and then like other people joining in.

26:12.193 --> 26:13.314
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

26:29.670 --> 26:38.292
[SPEAKER_11]: Ironically, though, I did also check out another Minecraft-esque game because it was cheap and it was featured in an article I read.

26:39.773 --> 26:45.474
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Castle Builder Z. Castle Builder Z is on the Xbox Live Indie Games.

26:46.034 --> 26:53.636
[SPEAKER_11]: It is only $1, 80 Microsoft points, so worth checking out for that kind of amount of money.

26:54.216 --> 26:59.058
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like Minecraft with your avatars, with really crappy looking graphics.

26:59.258 --> 27:05.960
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, even crappier than... I was like, Minecraft isn't exactly known for its graphical finesse.

27:06.380 --> 27:08.481
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like they made their own textures.

27:08.601 --> 27:11.022
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like a bad texture pack on Minecraft.

27:12.062 --> 27:15.664
[SPEAKER_11]: But you have guns, and you can craft weapons and stuff like that.

27:16.824 --> 27:18.725
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's zombies.

27:19.005 --> 27:21.026
[SPEAKER_03]: Would guns make you more interested in Minecraft?

27:21.846 --> 27:22.226
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

27:22.246 --> 27:22.346
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

27:23.534 --> 27:24.715
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's zombies.

27:24.795 --> 27:30.038
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I understand there's zombies normally in Minecraft, but these aren't the zombies that are in the regular Minecraft.

27:30.078 --> 27:35.562
[SPEAKER_11]: These are like, I'm going to run at you at full speed and jump in the air and try to kill you zombies.

27:37.603 --> 27:39.764
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a dragon that tries to kill you as well.

27:40.545 --> 27:41.966
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty much the whole game is like...

27:42.666 --> 27:45.968
[SPEAKER_11]: Very, very... It's not... I don't know.

27:45.988 --> 27:46.809
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of scary.

27:46.869 --> 27:54.655
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the ambience, the sound that they have in there kind of sounds like one of those Halloween tapes or CDs and stuff with all the Halloween spooky sounds.

27:55.275 --> 27:56.116
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's pretty much it.

27:56.296 --> 27:56.876
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like...

27:58.337 --> 28:09.759
[SPEAKER_11]: I ended up barricading myself into a cave or something because the first time out, I was like, okay, crap, this looks like night all the time.

28:09.979 --> 28:13.660
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, when it's daytime, it's gloomy and lightning outside.

28:13.740 --> 28:17.721
[SPEAKER_11]: And when it's nighttime, it's dark, but there's tons of shit running at you.

28:18.661 --> 28:22.702
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the first time I made the mistake of, oh, I forgot to get wood.

28:23.602 --> 28:23.942
[SPEAKER_11]: Crap.

28:24.803 --> 28:26.143
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm waiting in there.

28:26.183 --> 28:30.165
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, okay, I better go outside and go try to punch a tree real quick and get some wood.

28:30.545 --> 28:31.545
[SPEAKER_11]: Go punch a tree.

28:31.866 --> 28:32.726
[SPEAKER_11]: Only in Minecraft.

28:32.786 --> 28:37.108
[SPEAKER_11]: So I did that, and then all of a sudden I get bum-rushed by a bunch of fucking zombies.

28:37.128 --> 28:38.448
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even know what they were.

28:38.468 --> 28:44.891
[SPEAKER_11]: Just something that was snarling and sounding like a tiger or something, but it looked like some sort of monster thing that ran at me.

28:45.371 --> 28:51.154
[SPEAKER_11]: So I started firing a pistol at it, and that didn't really do anything because I got rushed from a few other sides at the same time.

28:51.534 --> 28:52.616
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

29:07.454 --> 29:33.008
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, so I finally got it to where I'm like in a cave now and I've mined some stuff and you start building weapons because you don't really have a whole lot you can build in it because it is kind of a knockoff of Minecraft but you don't have like beds, you can't sleep or anything and then there's, it always sounds like there's monsters trying to dig their way into your tunnel and sometimes they somehow manage to get in there and I think on higher difficulties they can dig through the tunnel and get to you.

29:33.248 --> 29:34.288
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

29:50.913 --> 29:53.994
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty, I think it'd be kind of interesting to check it out.

29:54.014 --> 29:57.155
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, 80 Microsoft points, I mean, it's a buck, come on.

29:57.375 --> 29:58.535
[SPEAKER_11]: Just try it.

29:58.575 --> 30:01.756
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to try it, if you play Minecraft, it's kind of fun.

30:02.697 --> 30:04.777
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll get a dollar's worth of entertainment out of it.

30:04.837 --> 30:06.918
[SPEAKER_03]: And in general, don't forget about indie games.

30:07.739 --> 30:09.060
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget about Xbox Indie Game.

30:09.080 --> 30:10.362
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of fun stuff on there.

30:10.502 --> 30:10.963
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not bad.

30:11.003 --> 30:12.925
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, Castle Miner was one of those series.

30:12.985 --> 30:21.276
[SPEAKER_11]: It was one of, like, two or three series that were on Indie Games that were kind of mimicking Minecraft for a long time before Minecraft came out.

30:21.316 --> 30:23.559
[SPEAKER_11]: And they still do, and they still sell all right, but...

30:25.161 --> 30:39.773
[SPEAKER_11]: They're fun in their own right, and it's four-player co-op, and you can play online and stuff like that, so it's worth it for like... I mean, come on, you probably have 80 Microsoft points sitting in your account that's just... Yeah, leftover from Rock Band purchases or something.

30:39.793 --> 30:41.815
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, or something like that, so definitely worth checking out.

30:41.835 --> 30:45.177
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there's tons of indie games on there that are worth checking out, but it was kind of fun.

30:45.477 --> 30:48.540
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, if you're done with your gaming week, I'll do mine real quick.

30:49.517 --> 30:50.738
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a lot of new stuff this week.

30:50.758 --> 30:54.801
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the stuff from last week, like Sound Shapes and World of Warcraft and so forth.

30:54.821 --> 30:56.362
[SPEAKER_03]: But I did play two new games.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.263
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them's a little herpy derpy.

30:58.303 --> 30:59.564
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk about this real quick.

30:59.604 --> 31:00.564
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an iOS game.

31:00.584 --> 31:02.386
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing it mostly on my iPad.

31:02.426 --> 31:08.009
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Puzzle Craft, which might make you think it's Minecraft, but like puzzle, but it's not.

31:08.170 --> 31:09.250
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually nothing like that.

31:09.671 --> 31:12.172
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those free to, well, no, it's not even free to play.

31:12.212 --> 31:13.193
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 99 cents.

31:13.293 --> 31:18.116
[SPEAKER_03]: But then of course they charge you for all these upgrades in the game, like extra coins and stuff.

31:18.136 --> 31:19.137
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't really have to do it.

31:19.697 --> 31:48.124
[SPEAKER_03]: um the crux of the game is that you're building this town and you get all the materials to either get food or get materials to build things in your town in this whole little match game where you like they call it match three in the description but it's not bejeweled at all it's like trace the consecutive line of like all the little pieces of grain in the puzzle like try to trace it and then they all disappear and new stuff falls and kind of goes like that over and over and

31:48.564 --> 31:52.866
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those things that's just like so stupid that I'm playing this, but it's addicting.

31:52.926 --> 31:53.727
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cute.

31:53.847 --> 31:56.868
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have this little town of villagers, and some of them wear chicken outfits.

31:56.948 --> 31:57.549
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cute.

31:57.609 --> 31:58.649
[SPEAKER_03]: So whatever.

31:59.450 --> 31:59.870
[SPEAKER_03]: There's that.

32:00.390 --> 32:05.953
[SPEAKER_03]: The other game I've been playing a little bit, just a little bit because it just came out today, is New Super Mario Bros.

32:06.293 --> 32:07.154
[SPEAKER_03]: 2 on the 3DS.

32:07.994 --> 32:09.235
[SPEAKER_03]: I did pick that up today.

32:10.135 --> 32:12.196
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it just came out today, so I haven't had a lot of time to play it.

32:12.256 --> 32:13.637
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't give it a full review yet.

32:13.977 --> 32:16.942
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll post something more in depth on VOGnetwork.com later this week.

32:17.022 --> 32:17.503
[SPEAKER_03]: Plug, plug.

32:17.523 --> 32:20.087
[SPEAKER_11]: But how similar is its new Super Mario Brothers?

32:20.929 --> 32:25.516
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's pretty much the same damn game, but is that such a bad thing?

32:26.678 --> 32:26.919
[SPEAKER_11]: Well...

32:27.794 --> 32:34.740
[SPEAKER_11]: No, but at the same time, it kind of feels a little bit like they didn't put a lot of effort into it, if it's pretty similar.

32:34.900 --> 32:37.102
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, there are some new stuff.

32:37.262 --> 32:38.323
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, especially with this one.

32:38.603 --> 32:44.028
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of think the whole, like, Mario's after coins, I think it's a little bit corny.

32:44.388 --> 32:45.830
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of the power-ups are neat.

32:45.870 --> 32:47.651
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I love the one that turns you into giant.

32:47.671 --> 32:49.173
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, I guess that was in the previous games, too.

32:49.253 --> 32:50.514
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was like, ooh, giant Mario.

32:51.594 --> 33:09.084
[SPEAKER_03]: and then you know the ones that have the gold coins where you can kick and it leaves like a trail of coins and the fireball that makes all the blocks turn into coins it was kind of neat and it really where the game shines as it usually does is level design I've played a lot of really well designed levels

33:10.899 --> 33:12.500
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

33:31.758 --> 33:59.150
[SPEAKER_03]: and you'll find yourself in the world mushroom world or whatever which is kind of like I guess like the secret world and the stages get a little harder but like one of them was like really neat design because the way the blocks were you had to figure out like how you could fall through the blocks to get all the coins it's kind of hard for me to explain without like showing you a visual but just like the way the blocks were it looked like one solid block but it's got all these lines in it so you had to I don't know

34:00.590 --> 34:02.712
[SPEAKER_03]: 3D doesn't really add anything to the game, but that's okay.

34:02.992 --> 34:06.275
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm totally okay with 3DS games not whoring the crap out of 3D.

34:06.675 --> 34:10.839
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want the 3D stuff, go play Mario 3D Land, which did it very well.

34:11.879 --> 34:13.761
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I liked it so far.

34:16.763 --> 34:34.818
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll probably play it to completion and it's got some interesting street pass things where you can play a sequence of three random stages and try to get as many coins as possible and then you street pass to somebody else and you get their record so you can try to play the same three stages they did even though it was randomized.

34:35.198 --> 34:41.503
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of like, I don't know, kind of has that Mario Kart-esque competitive element which wasn't in any other Mario game so far.

34:41.924 --> 34:42.904
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is something new.

34:43.205 --> 34:43.765
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give it that.

34:44.125 --> 34:44.826
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of a little different.

34:45.326 --> 34:47.127
[SPEAKER_03]: I will get into this in the show a little later.

34:47.167 --> 34:51.671
[SPEAKER_03]: They're promising the DLC will be worth it, essentially.

34:52.031 --> 34:56.694
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm curious about that because, again, level design is where these games tend to shine.

34:57.935 --> 35:02.238
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's all they really need to do since the engine was done a few times.

35:02.538 --> 35:05.220
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I'll be honest in that regard.

35:05.260 --> 35:13.185
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm going to razz the game, it's that it's really the first Mario game I've played in a long time where I go, this really isn't original.

35:13.205 --> 35:13.706
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

35:14.326 --> 35:39.772
[SPEAKER_03]: which I know is weird because Mario games are essentially all the same mechanic but think about it you know in the original Super Mario Bros and then there's Mario Bros 2 it's like holy shit this is totally different and then Mario Bros 3 kind of went back more towards the first one but you know if it ain't fixed don't break it Mario World was like completely Yoshi and all this then Mario 64 oh my god 3D Mario Galaxy oh my god the planets and everything is just different this is the first one in a long time I've played where I'm like

35:40.182 --> 35:40.923
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

36:01.460 --> 36:02.281
[SPEAKER_03]: Just straight up bad.

36:02.621 --> 36:05.284
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even think Mario Sunshine, you could say, was a bad game.

36:05.845 --> 36:08.848
[SPEAKER_03]: I still think Mario Sunshine was great.

36:08.868 --> 36:09.428
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Mario Sunshine.

36:10.209 --> 36:13.973
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yes, it's a formula, but it's a solid fucking formula.

36:14.433 --> 36:14.874
[SPEAKER_03]: Go with it.

36:16.343 --> 36:16.763
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

36:17.944 --> 36:18.964
[SPEAKER_03]: I should go to the chat room.

36:19.604 --> 36:22.585
[SPEAKER_03]: Live.VogNetwork.com Let's see.

36:22.626 --> 36:26.347
[SPEAKER_03]: Shayna Link goes in chat saying, I'm at a bit over 30k coins so far.

36:26.447 --> 36:27.948
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives me incentive to keep playing.

36:28.268 --> 36:32.790
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the back of the box says something about getting a million coins and I guess you get something special.

36:32.990 --> 36:33.350
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

36:33.730 --> 36:35.971
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably just all the levels backwards or something.

36:36.931 --> 36:39.132
[SPEAKER_03]: WhatUpG says the Raccoon power-up is back.

36:39.192 --> 36:39.812
[SPEAKER_03]: That is true.

36:40.352 --> 36:46.673
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not Tanooki Mario anymore like it was in the Wii one or the last... No, the Mario 3D Land of the Doogie.

36:46.713 --> 36:50.494
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just straight-up Raccoon Mario just like you remember it in Mario 3.

36:50.914 --> 36:54.575
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, there's a lot here that's just like you remember it in Mario 3.

36:55.635 --> 36:57.295
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you go to World 2.

36:57.775 --> 36:58.876
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a desert world.

36:58.936 --> 36:59.596
[SPEAKER_03]: What a shock.

37:00.476 --> 37:02.657
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a lot of the same formula.

37:02.677 --> 37:04.819
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it is the third new Super Mario Bros.

37:04.879 --> 37:07.240
[SPEAKER_11]: game, so maybe it's new Super Mario Bros.

37:07.440 --> 37:08.581
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's not that new.

37:08.861 --> 37:12.743
[SPEAKER_03]: They should just call it Well-Polished Mario Bros.

37:12.763 --> 37:12.743
2.

37:12.863 --> 37:14.024
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't that a little something?

37:14.464 --> 37:20.788
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, really, you couldn't have come up with a better name for the series other than, yeah, it's a new Super Mario Bros.

37:20.848 --> 37:21.088
[SPEAKER_11]: game.

37:21.849 --> 37:23.229
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting point from Dark Tetsuya.

37:23.809 --> 37:31.751
[SPEAKER_03]: Ironically, Mario 2's original version, meaning the Japanese version, Lost Levels here, right, wasn't too different from Super Mario Bros.

37:32.131 --> 37:31.751
1.

37:32.432 --> 37:36.373
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the level layouts and some of the little things they added cranked up the difficulty.

37:36.633 --> 37:37.673
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great comparison.

37:38.073 --> 37:42.774
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Lost Levels or Mario 2 in Japan really wasn't that different from Mario 1.

37:43.194 --> 37:46.595
[SPEAKER_03]: Different graphics, a little different mechanic with Luigi's jumping.

37:46.974 --> 37:50.737
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and Mario 2 that we got wasn't even a Mario game originally.

37:51.177 --> 37:52.358
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, but I'm not talking about that.

37:52.398 --> 37:53.940
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not talking about that whole thing.

37:54.060 --> 37:58.523
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, where they say, oh, how innovative, how different, it wasn't even a Mario game.

37:58.904 --> 37:59.444
[SPEAKER_02]: True, true.

37:59.744 --> 38:02.927
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, go back to the Lost Levels or Japanese 2 and 1.

38:03.527 --> 38:06.090
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very... I mean, I don't think Lost Levels is a bad game.

38:06.330 --> 38:08.391
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really... It's a challenging-ass Mario game.

38:08.411 --> 38:09.092
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an asshole game.

38:09.312 --> 38:09.672
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

38:10.533 --> 38:14.136
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's some asshole stages in this that I've played so far when you get into those special worlds.

38:14.336 --> 38:14.496
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

38:16.741 --> 38:20.190
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, Tigerclaw says the next version would be New New Super Mario Bros.

38:23.846 --> 38:24.607
[SPEAKER_03]: Very new.

38:25.487 --> 38:26.188
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario Bros.

38:26.208 --> 38:26.188
2015.

38:26.348 --> 38:32.832
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it could be a band-themed one because new Super Mario Bros.

38:33.192 --> 38:33.272
[SPEAKER_11]: U2.

38:33.552 --> 38:36.974
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, WhatUpG reminds us Mario 2 had the poison mushrooms.

38:37.014 --> 38:37.715
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a little different too.

38:37.955 --> 38:41.918
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, but here's the one tiny concern I have.

38:42.818 --> 38:47.661
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm already looking at this game going, all right, it's cool, but it's not that original.

38:47.701 --> 38:49.662
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as original as Nintendo wants you to think it is.

38:50.183 --> 38:50.383
Hmm.

38:50.603 --> 38:54.425
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's going to happen when that Wii U Mario game comes out?

38:54.525 --> 38:58.146
[SPEAKER_03]: Because these games are not coming out with a lot of time apart between them.

38:58.527 --> 39:00.888
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that Wii U Mario going to bring to the table?

39:01.588 --> 39:03.429
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't that going to be the same damn thing again?

39:03.889 --> 39:12.413
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the same thing, but now with the gimmick that, hey, look, a fifth person, because I don't know about you, but I always have about five people in my living room wanting to play the Wii.

39:12.973 --> 39:14.514
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wait, no one wants to play the Wii.

39:14.954 --> 39:20.096
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so five people supposedly in this room playing the Wii U, and one person is going to be like, hi!

39:20.316 --> 39:21.938
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm moving the platforms!

39:23.959 --> 39:25.821
[SPEAKER_11]: Look, I'm contributing!

39:26.001 --> 39:28.884
[SPEAKER_11]: It's almost like that dumb person that you have in your room.

39:28.964 --> 39:30.145
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, you know what?

39:30.666 --> 39:32.868
[SPEAKER_11]: Billy's not going to play the game because he's too stupid.

39:32.908 --> 39:33.929
[SPEAKER_11]: He's going to keep dying.

39:33.969 --> 39:36.471
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to let him move the platforms up and down.

39:37.332 --> 39:38.753
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that's all he can handle.

39:39.474 --> 39:42.056
[SPEAKER_03]: So five people to play this to its full potential.

39:42.076 --> 39:44.458
[SPEAKER_03]: This game's going to sell like crazy in Utah.

39:44.698 --> 39:45.139
[SPEAKER_03]: Go figure.

39:46.605 --> 40:03.855
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's just, I, if someone even made, I had to laugh, because there was a comment, it was a developer, actually, that was trying stuff on the Wii U, and they were saying, all Nintendo's trying to do is sell a TV-sized DS.

40:03.915 --> 40:06.876
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, we've been, he's all, why isn't anybody in the games press saying that?

40:06.896 --> 40:09.097
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, we've been fucking saying that for months.

40:09.458 --> 40:11.779
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all the Wii U's gonna be is just a giant DS.

40:12.139 --> 40:13.100
[SPEAKER_11]: DS.

40:13.761 --> 40:24.815
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, the Wii U gamepad works well at a demo kiosk, but when you actually back it away from the TV, then you have to constantly look down at your controller and stuff like that.

40:25.536 --> 40:27.278
[SPEAKER_11]: It just doesn't really flow well.

40:27.798 --> 40:34.521
[SPEAKER_03]: Alpha Kanatagram in our chatroom says, Sky, it's going to bring in H fucking D. Okay, I can respect that and all.

40:35.301 --> 40:37.582
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario and HD will be fine and all, but let's be real.

40:38.022 --> 40:40.583
[SPEAKER_03]: New Super Mario Brothers is not the game I want to see in HD.

40:41.163 --> 40:43.985
[SPEAKER_03]: F fucking Zero is the game I want to see in HD.

40:44.125 --> 40:44.545
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello?

40:46.285 --> 40:50.107
[SPEAKER_03]: or even a new 3D Mario game would be pretty awesome.

40:50.127 --> 40:52.868
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not exactly the greatest starting point.

40:52.928 --> 40:54.608
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a Metroid Prime in HD.

40:54.648 --> 40:58.549
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you imagine a Super Mario World-esque game in 3D?

40:59.270 --> 41:02.551
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of like Zelda-ish big adventure type game?

41:02.871 --> 41:03.991
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be fucking awesome.

41:04.451 --> 41:05.872
[SPEAKER_11]: Not new Super Mario Bros.

41:07.052 --> 41:09.435
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, last comment from chat, and then we're going to move on with the show.

41:09.496 --> 41:10.156
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerClaw says,

41:25.436 --> 41:27.558
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's okay.

41:27.578 --> 41:28.439
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to point this out.

41:28.800 --> 41:32.764
[SPEAKER_03]: Not every 3DS game has to whore the 3D like crazy.

41:32.824 --> 41:35.047
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a good thing.

41:35.267 --> 41:37.549
[SPEAKER_03]: The 3D is subtle and is not a game changer.

41:37.890 --> 41:43.936
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want a game that whores the 3D but does it very, very, very well, go play the Mario 3D Land because that was...

41:44.657 --> 41:53.625
[SPEAKER_03]: An original Mario game, despite the fact that it certainly has a lot in common with Mario 64 and all that, because the 3D brought some awesome elements into it.

41:53.725 --> 41:58.929
[SPEAKER_03]: That game felt very original, despite the fact it was a formula at the end of the day.

41:59.530 --> 42:00.391
[SPEAKER_03]: So, go figure.

42:01.508 --> 42:07.193
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, maybe sitting next to Mario 3D Land, this game feels a little bit like a step backwards.

42:07.694 --> 42:08.034
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

42:08.054 --> 42:09.456
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like a very harsh thing to say.

42:09.476 --> 42:10.997
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes it sound like I don't like the game or something.

42:11.017 --> 42:11.938
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I think it's about right.

42:11.978 --> 42:12.418
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know.

42:12.879 --> 42:16.382
[SPEAKER_11]: Because 3D Land was actually pretty innovative and it was a pretty awesome game.

42:17.123 --> 42:17.203
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

42:18.624 --> 42:32.852
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, New Super Mario Bros., the first one was a pretty awesome game, but it's just, you've done it now three times, and you're gonna do it again one more time, and you haven't really changed it up that much.

42:33.172 --> 42:41.837
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's basically, like, because even before, it was like, hey, look, we created this tech demo of the Miis running around in, like, this New Super Mario Bros.

42:41.857 --> 42:44.499
[SPEAKER_11]: thing, and that was the Wii U tech demo, and I'm like...

42:45.439 --> 42:46.919
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just new Super Mario Bros.

42:47.099 --> 42:49.540
[SPEAKER_11]: But they have, you know, it was just a tech demo.

42:49.780 --> 42:50.720
[SPEAKER_11]: And then guess what they did?

42:51.000 --> 42:52.780
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they did this with all their fucking tech demos.

42:52.800 --> 42:54.001
[SPEAKER_11]: They turned it into a game.

42:54.721 --> 42:57.541
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, oh my fucking god, you didn't do anything.

42:57.641 --> 43:04.562
[SPEAKER_11]: You just have four people running around in this game just like you can on the Wii version.

43:05.283 --> 43:08.283
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, but there's a fifth person that can do shit for some reason.

43:08.603 --> 43:13.224
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll probably still get a Wii U. I got problems.

43:14.542 --> 43:15.363
[SPEAKER_03]: I got problems.

43:15.403 --> 43:16.404
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't get it at launch.

43:16.824 --> 43:17.265
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

43:17.925 --> 43:18.345
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

43:19.166 --> 43:21.608
[SPEAKER_11]: There's nothing coming... There's nothing.

43:21.648 --> 43:25.232
[SPEAKER_03]: Despite everything I'm saying, despite... Look, I'm just gonna admit it.

43:25.572 --> 43:31.217
[SPEAKER_03]: Despite everything I'm saying here and now about originality and all that, the first time I play that new Super Mario Bros.

43:31.918 --> 43:34.140
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii U or whatever in HD, I'm gonna be like...

43:35.060 --> 43:46.137
[SPEAKER_03]: I want it, and I'll have it, because I want it I'm not planning on buying one, I don't need that system, I don't play the Wii enough, I'm, no

43:48.012 --> 43:50.674
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's move on with some gaming news.

43:50.934 --> 43:51.795
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait, housekeeping.

43:52.636 --> 43:58.420
[SPEAKER_03]: Visit us at twitter.com slash OLR or on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

43:58.781 --> 44:06.987
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, visit our network that we are affiliated with and tape live at, the Voice of Geeks Network or vognetwork.com.

44:07.507 --> 44:09.929
[SPEAKER_03]: I wrote a review of Sound Shapes, so you can check out that's there.

44:10.029 --> 44:14.453
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's some other – a book review went up last week of Stargate by the guy from Critical Myths.

44:15.114 --> 44:16.576
[SPEAKER_03]: and lots of good stuff on the site.

44:16.616 --> 44:19.421
[SPEAKER_03]: So check that out, vognetwork.com.

44:19.922 --> 44:21.124
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into some gaming news.

44:21.725 --> 44:25.592
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, just, I guess, tons of Sony shit coming out of Gamescom.

44:25.632 --> 44:26.333
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's tons of stuff.

44:26.353 --> 44:28.356
[SPEAKER_03]: You posted like 20 stories and I'm like, you know what?

44:29.059 --> 44:29.839
[SPEAKER_03]: Just do them all.

44:29.899 --> 44:30.620
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do them all.

44:31.420 --> 44:32.361
[SPEAKER_11]: All kind of tied to each other.

44:32.641 --> 44:34.902
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, some non-Sony stuff real quick.

44:35.002 --> 44:37.704
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a game that Capcom kind of brought out of nowhere.

44:38.024 --> 44:42.006
[SPEAKER_11]: They're calling it kind of the game of Gamescom.

44:42.106 --> 44:45.068
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Remember Me, which was kind of cool.

44:45.108 --> 44:47.869
[SPEAKER_11]: It had a little bit of like you hack into people's memories.

44:49.090 --> 44:53.813
[SPEAKER_03]: I always think of that fucking terrible movie with Robert Pattinson that had that twist ending.

44:54.093 --> 44:54.613
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember that?

44:54.653 --> 44:55.614
[SPEAKER_03]: It was called Remember Me?

45:22.276 --> 45:23.597
[SPEAKER_11]: Puppeteer Sony Online Entertainment

45:43.857 --> 46:05.348
[SPEAKER_11]: and it's very it reminded me of um like Clockwork Knight if you remember that from the Sega Saturn at least that's what it reminded me of but it was a very unique looking game like kind of a platformer with this like puppet looking animation to different things but it's pretty cool so they have that come out

46:06.448 --> 46:10.549
[SPEAKER_11]: Another game they had was Rain, which kind of reminded me a little bit of Limbo.

46:11.749 --> 46:15.910
[SPEAKER_11]: Or even that one game, A Lost in Shadow, that came out from Konami.

46:16.310 --> 46:26.153
[SPEAKER_11]: It's basically a PlayStation Network game that's going to be coming out that features these invisible... Like an invisible boy who can only be seen in rain.

46:27.233 --> 46:31.134
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're wandering around this environment and stuff and solving puzzles based on...

46:32.774 --> 46:36.797
[SPEAKER_11]: and this kind of invisible character, which is kind of neat.

46:37.117 --> 46:45.082
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, I don't know what I should think about this one, but Until Dawn, it's going to be a teen horror movie style game that utilizes the move.

46:45.302 --> 46:47.243
[SPEAKER_03]: That actually sounds kind of awesome.

46:47.723 --> 46:50.385
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope this is Night Trap bad.

46:51.606 --> 46:52.566
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awesome.

46:53.427 --> 46:59.010
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the industry needs a good game like... Except without the annoying parts of Night Trap, like watching the monitors.

46:59.110 --> 46:59.811
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it needs...

47:00.031 --> 47:00.532
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

47:17.288 --> 47:19.410
[SPEAKER_11]: and then one other thing.

47:19.450 --> 47:27.017
[SPEAKER_11]: They showed off Wonder Book again and I've got to say this presentation of Wonder Book was way better than the one that they did at E3.

47:27.277 --> 47:41.771
[SPEAKER_11]: It was shorter and they showed some new stuff including not only are they going to have the whole Book of Spells thing which looked okay in the new trailer but they have this new they got a licensing with BBC's Walking with Dinosaurs which looks pretty awesome and

47:42.371 --> 47:48.515
[SPEAKER_11]: and Diggs Nightcrawler which is kind of a noir fairy tale type game.

47:48.615 --> 47:53.559
[SPEAKER_11]: You play this worm who's a detective solving fairy tale crimes kind of.

47:53.959 --> 47:55.580
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds almost like it could be a book.

47:55.600 --> 48:00.403
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it might even be a book series but those will be coming out later on.

48:00.944 --> 48:04.786
[SPEAKER_11]: I think right now Wonder Book is launching with books of spells and that's it.

48:04.946 --> 48:10.150
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, so does this mean you have come full circle and you are a fan of Wonder Book now?

48:10.230 --> 48:11.130
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not a fan of it, no.

48:12.451 --> 48:40.642
[SPEAKER_11]: it looks interesting for people that might be into that stuff like I was thinking for the accounts I deal with like I deal with library chain or you know the old libraries in the US and obviously this type of stuff would be good for them or people that sell books but no for me personally no you know what's making a comeback though that ain't got or that Wonderbook ain't got shit on you know what you know what's making a huge comeback brace yourself for it

48:45.775 --> 48:46.556
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell yeah.

48:46.636 --> 48:51.060
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking Reading Rainbow is back.

48:51.080 --> 48:52.282
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously?

48:52.322 --> 48:55.004
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think it's like an iOS type thing now.

48:55.024 --> 49:00.430
[SPEAKER_03]: They're making apps out of it where it's not like a show, but it's like LeVar Burton pimping books.

49:01.310 --> 49:17.166
[SPEAKER_03]: Better how LeVar Burton associated with it Like, okay, here's the thing Imagine if Wonderbook instead had been called Reading Rainbow We would all be losing our shit over it All they had to do was get LeVar Burton out on stage going It's the shit, guys We would have been like, take my money!

49:17.626 --> 49:17.927
Take it!

49:18.347 --> 49:18.647
[SPEAKER_03]: Take it!

49:19.928 --> 49:21.070
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the intro to this show

49:24.557 --> 49:25.818
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that old logo too.

49:26.959 --> 49:28.281
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so 80s and gorgeous.

49:28.921 --> 49:34.006
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing that pissed me off about reading Rainbow is that the books were always checked out at the library.

49:34.127 --> 49:36.049
[SPEAKER_03]: You tried to go find the books, they were always gone.

49:36.069 --> 49:36.949
[SPEAKER_06]: Not at my library.

49:37.370 --> 49:41.134
[SPEAKER_06]: No one in Alabama reads.

49:42.275 --> 49:43.616
[SPEAKER_11]: Some other cool stuff.

49:44.537 --> 49:48.421
[SPEAKER_11]: Before all that, they were showing Media Molecule's new game and

49:50.282 --> 49:51.342
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just fantastic.

49:51.462 --> 49:52.743
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a game called Tearaway.

49:53.183 --> 49:54.904
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on the Vita.

49:54.984 --> 49:57.345
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, the whole world looks like paper.

49:57.665 --> 49:59.485
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of the stuff you can do in there.

49:59.826 --> 50:01.626
[SPEAKER_11]: You can actually interact with the game.

50:01.646 --> 50:04.227
[SPEAKER_11]: You can push your finger up on the back of the touch panel.

50:04.988 --> 50:09.049
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll actually see your finger coming through the screen, which is kind of weird.

50:13.311 --> 50:14.871
[SPEAKER_11]: You can literally finger your Vita.

50:15.151 --> 50:16.612
[SPEAKER_11]: You can literally finger your Vita.

50:17.907 --> 50:26.474
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, but it's going to utilize the camera in different motion-based stuff, and it looks fantastic because it's medium molecule.

50:26.514 --> 50:27.135
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, come on.

50:29.216 --> 50:29.617
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

50:29.657 --> 50:33.760
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just so glad the Vita's finally found a use for that back touchpad.

50:34.921 --> 50:37.183
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you can watch your finger go up the Vita.

50:38.244 --> 50:38.384
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

50:39.771 --> 50:40.391
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep, you can.

50:41.592 --> 50:45.613
[SPEAKER_11]: They showed off Killzone Mercenary, which is going to be a new first-person shooter on the Vita.

50:46.213 --> 50:46.913
[SPEAKER_11]: It looked kind of cool.

50:47.494 --> 51:01.118
[SPEAKER_11]: They also showed Call of Duty Black Ops Declassified, which I was very interested in picking it up until I realized that it's the guys that made the last Resistance game, Burning Skies, and that game sucked.

51:01.318 --> 51:03.839
[SPEAKER_11]: So probably not going to pick up this Call of Duty game.

51:04.275 --> 51:06.096
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we go back to the fingering thing for a minute?

51:07.036 --> 51:11.979
[SPEAKER_03]: A sitting vampire in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Someone's going to put their dick on it.

51:12.219 --> 51:15.701
[SPEAKER_03]: So what would happen if you put something besides it?

51:16.001 --> 51:17.442
[SPEAKER_06]: Stances like someone hasn't already.

51:18.302 --> 51:21.604
[SPEAKER_11]: What would happen if you put something else on the back touchpad?

51:21.624 --> 51:22.124
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing.

51:22.744 --> 51:27.487
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really understand how it works because they're going to have... It actually is an image of your finger.

51:27.507 --> 51:28.807
[SPEAKER_11]: It utilizes the camera.

51:29.027 --> 51:29.928
[SPEAKER_11]: It captures that.

51:29.968 --> 51:33.930
[SPEAKER_11]: So yes, you would see a penis coming up through the back of the screen.

51:34.290 --> 51:36.591
[SPEAKER_11]: If you were somehow... Or would your penis turn into a finger?

51:37.112 --> 51:37.752
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

51:39.393 --> 51:42.055
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm assuming it's not... That's a really big finger.

51:42.075 --> 51:44.256
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, for some people, maybe a really small finger.

51:44.276 --> 51:44.956
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that your thumb?

51:45.136 --> 51:51.540
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't you... Because there's no way for the camera to capture the image of your finger, you know, on that back touch panel.

51:51.600 --> 51:56.963
[SPEAKER_11]: It just doesn't... It's out of the scope of the lens, but... I don't know.

51:57.203 --> 52:01.346
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, unless they have you capture your finger, but I think that... Yes.

52:01.406 --> 52:03.307
[SPEAKER_06]: Why does your finger look like a sea cucumber?

52:05.663 --> 52:07.424
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of the great mysteries.

52:10.145 --> 52:12.946
[SPEAKER_03]: What will happen when you put your dick on the rear touchpad?

52:17.668 --> 52:20.869
[SPEAKER_11]: Find out on the next OLR.

52:21.469 --> 52:22.210
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll make a mess.

52:27.932 --> 52:29.693
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to have that trade-in system.

52:31.353 --> 52:32.934
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I played a lot of Tearaway.

52:34.494 --> 52:39.458
[SPEAKER_09]: Alone at Night.

52:39.618 --> 52:40.539
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on.

52:40.559 --> 52:51.988
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of innuendos, I guess, Ratchet & Clank Full Frontal Assault is coming to the Vita as well.

52:53.670 --> 52:54.931
[SPEAKER_02]: You did that on purpose.

52:58.273 --> 52:58.914
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob's red.

53:01.336 --> 53:02.357
[SPEAKER_02]: Full Frontal Assault.

53:02.898 --> 53:06.900
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, not only will it be a full frontal assault on the Vita, but also on your PS3.

53:07.220 --> 53:15.685
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's going to be one of these games that utilizes this brand new thing they announced, which is the PlayStation Cross Buy, which is awesome.

53:15.745 --> 53:20.868
[SPEAKER_11]: Cross Buy, basically, you purchase a game on the PS3, you get the Vita version for free.

53:21.708 --> 53:23.009
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck yeah, that's the way you do it.

53:23.509 --> 53:25.591
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a great trend that SoundShape started.

53:26.611 --> 53:27.092
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

53:27.892 --> 53:29.273
[SPEAKER_03]: Another game that's going to feature that?

53:29.313 --> 53:33.336
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope, though, because this was a good point that came up when Bobby was talking about this earlier on his show.

53:33.836 --> 53:35.417
[SPEAKER_03]: I want it to not just be digital.

53:35.517 --> 53:38.739
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my concern, is that that would only be the deal if you get it digitally.

53:38.779 --> 53:39.900
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be digital, I thought.

53:39.920 --> 53:41.821
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, but I'm running out of room on the PS3.

53:41.901 --> 53:44.743
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you've got to buy a bigger memory card.

53:44.963 --> 53:49.506
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the trick, is that those stinking Vita memory cards are so expensive.

53:49.527 --> 53:50.687
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not that expensive.

53:50.867 --> 53:52.108
[SPEAKER_11]: But did they come down in price finally?

53:52.128 --> 53:55.450
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, when they released, the prices of those aren't that expensive.

53:55.510 --> 53:56.091
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it was.

53:56.471 --> 53:56.652
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

53:58.234 --> 54:01.880
[SPEAKER_11]: Another game that's going to support that as well is going to be PlayStation All-Stars.

54:02.200 --> 54:04.964
[SPEAKER_03]: JV Mon reminds us in chat, play Pinball Arcade on the Vita.

54:05.145 --> 54:05.605
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that too?

54:06.507 --> 54:07.428
[SPEAKER_07]: I have it on my phone.

54:08.189 --> 54:08.690
[SPEAKER_07]: On my phone.

54:08.710 --> 54:09.311
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need a Vita.

54:11.993 --> 54:15.775
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, another game that's going to support that, LittleBigPlanet.

54:15.835 --> 54:18.196
[SPEAKER_11]: The DLC is also cross-platform.

54:18.256 --> 54:25.920
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you buy any DLC you have now for LittleBigPlanet 1 and 2, we'll work with LittleBigPlanet Vita and LittleBigPlanet Carding.

54:26.520 --> 54:27.401
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's kind of cool.

54:27.661 --> 54:28.101
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.

54:28.381 --> 54:29.181
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

54:29.221 --> 54:31.442
[SPEAKER_11]: LittleBigPlanet Carding, I hope, is one of those games too.

54:31.502 --> 54:33.423
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it is one of the cross-buying games.

54:33.703 --> 54:34.544
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's pretty sweet.

54:35.124 --> 54:38.950
[SPEAKER_11]: and then PlayStation Plus coming to the Vita as well.

54:39.190 --> 54:41.393
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're upping the cloud storage to one gigabyte.

54:41.994 --> 54:43.876
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's pretty sweet.

54:44.017 --> 54:50.045
[SPEAKER_11]: Also announced that I guess Europe is going to be getting Red Dead Redemption free in September.

54:50.525 --> 54:51.287
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's pretty sweet.

54:52.887 --> 54:55.188
[SPEAKER_11]: and then also PlayStation Mobile.

54:55.208 --> 55:02.829
[SPEAKER_11]: They talked a little bit about that and talked about some of the launch games and there was a big old trailer on there and one of the things I saw I remember was Lemmings.

55:02.869 --> 55:04.069
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, holy shit, Lemmings!

55:04.850 --> 55:06.250
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's going to be one of the games.

55:06.930 --> 55:20.233
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, they mentioned that PlayStation Mobile will be compatible with Sony Xperia phones, also Vitas, and then they revealed that the Asus and Wikipad tablets are going to be getting...

55:21.953 --> 55:23.055
[SPEAKER_11]: and PlayStation Mobile as well.

55:23.075 --> 55:26.498
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to be adding stuff or different devices to that as well.

55:28.300 --> 55:28.901
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty cool.

55:29.541 --> 55:30.102
[SPEAKER_11]: That's everything.

55:30.763 --> 55:32.504
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of news coming out of Gamescom.

55:32.685 --> 55:35.267
[SPEAKER_03]: But that makes sense because Sony has a pretty big presence in Europe.

55:35.287 --> 55:38.331
[SPEAKER_03]: They've always done pretty well there ever since the original PlayStation.

55:38.371 --> 55:39.492
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of exciting.

55:39.812 --> 55:42.555
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm assuming there'll be even more Tokyo Game Show, right?

55:43.236 --> 55:43.656
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.

55:43.836 --> 55:44.397
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

55:46.098 --> 56:02.579
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really excited about the whole Vita, Playstation 3 crossover I'm glad that I'll be able to do something with my Vita I'm telling you, Sound Shapes is a great They should be pushing it more It's a great holdover game until they get some more stuff

56:03.208 --> 56:31.686
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if that Final Fantasy X remake is going to be buy one get both because they were pimping it for both systems well it's right now it's been first party that's been doing that oh yeah yeah technically it's a that would be pretty cool I mean that might get me to buy the PS3 version of Black Ops 2 maybe if you know it was like that although like I said Black Ops declassified the fact that it's being done by the guys that did Resistance Burning Skies and the trailer just didn't look that great I was just

56:32.426 --> 56:34.487
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, made me sad.

56:52.532 --> 56:54.454
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the red one, put a Charmander sticker on it.

57:12.908 --> 57:21.573
[SPEAKER_03]: My big concern about getting one of these right now is that, again, I think I mentioned this last week, they'll just turn around and release a really beautiful color like that purple.

57:21.673 --> 57:24.014
[SPEAKER_03]: That purple 3DS is so gorgeous.

57:24.054 --> 57:26.656
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish that had been the launch color.

57:26.676 --> 57:29.357
[SPEAKER_03]: They would have never had to do another color because that purple one is so great.

57:30.818 --> 57:32.219
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious about the XL.

57:32.259 --> 57:39.163
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard it's a good system, but at the same time, do I want to pay $200 for a new one when I already have one?

57:39.503 --> 57:40.964
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I can justify that really.

57:41.664 --> 57:42.205
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.

57:43.065 --> 57:43.526
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's out.

57:44.126 --> 57:44.547
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.

57:45.628 --> 57:49.431
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we do have some news on the corporate front.

57:49.672 --> 57:51.754
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll put it in those words.

57:52.334 --> 57:53.215
[SPEAKER_06]: Who remembers OnLive?

57:55.277 --> 58:00.181
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember their big booth at E3, and nobody thought OnLive was going to work.

58:00.262 --> 58:02.704
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they showed up at E3, and they were like, this works.

58:03.104 --> 58:04.906
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody's like, holy shit, it does work.

58:06.357 --> 58:13.122
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, right now, there was something going around about a sort of bankruptcy going on.

58:13.582 --> 58:18.666
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, this article is really hard to read because all the text is crossed over and the HTML is screwed up.

58:18.886 --> 58:21.467
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there was so much back and forth on this this week.

58:21.848 --> 58:24.590
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody really has a clear understanding of what's going on.

58:24.610 --> 58:26.231
[SPEAKER_06]: Literally, the coding on this is awful.

58:27.211 --> 58:27.572
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

58:28.292 --> 58:34.339
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, basically they were saying that there was an acquisition of their assets by a company as a sale.

58:34.900 --> 58:38.244
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead, it has to do with bankruptcy protection.

58:38.724 --> 58:43.830
[SPEAKER_06]: They have, I believe, been acquired, but in kind of a different deal.

58:44.671 --> 58:45.853
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know what's different about it?

58:46.033 --> 58:46.774
[SPEAKER_03]: They won't say who.

58:47.054 --> 58:48.375
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's the big thing.

58:48.896 --> 58:49.677
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't that weird?

58:49.797 --> 58:52.981
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounded to me that they created their own company.

58:53.101 --> 58:54.242
[SPEAKER_11]: Like they created another company.

58:54.262 --> 58:57.706
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to call this On Live 2.

58:58.527 --> 58:59.028
[SPEAKER_11]: Let her finish.

58:59.108 --> 58:59.488
[SPEAKER_03]: Let her finish.

58:59.548 --> 59:00.530
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to get into this a little bit.

59:00.550 --> 59:00.890
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's what...

59:01.130 --> 59:15.442
[SPEAKER_06]: What the official quote is, like, we can now confirm the assets of OnLive Incorporated have been acquired into a newly formed company and is backed by substantial funding and will continue to operate the online game and desktop service, blah, blah, blah, etc., etc.

59:16.603 --> 59:25.351
[SPEAKER_06]: They are releasing the OnLive employees and I think have put out a call to rehire them with the new company.

59:25.951 --> 59:40.724
[SPEAKER_06]: which I mean basically how this worked with the company that I worked for before when we were sold is that yeah we were released from the previous corporation but we were hired quote by the new company as and we know with all of our tenure and everything intact

59:41.444 --> 01:00:03.952
[SPEAKER_06]: so I think that what it's looking like is either they have fully released them or they are sending the note out there that yeah we want you here we want to keep you around you know just maybe trying to get them to reapply through different hiring channels or something I mean maybe they want to bring them all and see you know if they're loyal to the product I don't know

01:00:05.046 --> 01:00:05.427
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:23.152
[SPEAKER_03]: They've yet to really say anything officially.

01:00:23.492 --> 01:00:29.757
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was at the point where people were reporting, yeah, we drove down to the online offices and we see people are walking out of here with boxes and all this stuff.

01:00:30.118 --> 01:00:33.420
[SPEAKER_03]: So clearly the company's not going to hire some people back.

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:36.002
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think everything's just in this big state of flux right now.

01:00:37.143 --> 01:00:43.549
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's never good news when people lose their jobs in the gaming industry.

01:00:43.569 --> 01:00:45.130
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is always tough to talk about.

01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:48.633
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do have to ask the hard question.

01:00:50.328 --> 01:00:57.915
[SPEAKER_03]: on live, kind of, I mean, as a service, it was bringing a lot of great things to the table, but the one thing that was really missing was, like, games.

01:00:58.796 --> 01:01:05.402
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, a lot of the games that it launched with, when launching is your first impression, were years old, and kind of old news.

01:01:05.563 --> 01:01:11.568
[SPEAKER_03]: And sure, they tried to add to that, and they did some cool things with the service, like the replays and some of that other stuff they were doing.

01:01:11.608 --> 01:01:11.869
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, they...

01:01:12.449 --> 01:01:16.194
[SPEAKER_03]: and the TV top systems and all that they were doing.

01:01:16.435 --> 01:01:20.080
[SPEAKER_03]: They had some great ideas, but it's like they just didn't have the games to back it up.

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.823
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't have the deals to back it up like Steam did.

01:01:23.164 --> 01:01:28.091
[SPEAKER_03]: The coolest thing they had going for it were the hour-long demos that you didn't really have to download anything.

01:01:28.111 --> 01:01:29.413
[SPEAKER_03]: You just did it through the cloud.

01:01:30.253 --> 01:01:34.055
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't really getting exclusives.

01:01:34.555 --> 01:01:35.335
[SPEAKER_03]: It was tricky.

01:01:36.116 --> 01:01:38.217
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see where the company is hurting.

01:01:39.457 --> 01:01:46.020
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the report had come out that only several thousand people out of the millions that had signed up were only ever on the service at any one time.

01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:49.842
[SPEAKER_11]: 1,600 and they had 8,000 servers.

01:01:50.002 --> 01:01:52.963
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a lot of unused servers that had to be maintained.

01:01:55.577 --> 01:02:01.020
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just really... I mean, they clearly... Someone believes in the product.

01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:08.343
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to... Well, look at... Sony bought their biggest competitor, Gaikai, which was a very similar sort of thing.

01:02:08.864 --> 01:02:15.007
[SPEAKER_03]: But Gaikai was kind of doing... They had the whole stuff in the browsers and they were getting some deals where the demos were streamed to them.

01:02:15.027 --> 01:02:17.208
[SPEAKER_03]: They were kind of trying to push the envelope a little more.

01:02:17.828 --> 01:02:19.169
[SPEAKER_03]: And now Sony acquired them.

01:02:19.609 --> 01:02:19.769
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:02:21.001 --> 01:02:27.625
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the other thing that kind of sucks, too, is basically some of the people were offered consulting arrangements.

01:02:27.685 --> 01:02:38.490
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, they said that they asked some of the employees to help smooth the transition to the new startup, and those people were offered stock options in the new company.

01:02:38.951 --> 01:02:50.357
[SPEAKER_11]: However, those stocks are basically worthless unless the company at some point becomes profitable and basically gets sold or goes public.

01:02:50.917 --> 01:03:00.139
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you get an IOU, maybe we'll fulfill that money if we, you know, are successful.

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:05.461
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, best of luck to the folks that find themselves displaced this week with the whole on live stuff.

01:03:05.701 --> 01:03:11.883
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope they're able to land work quickly somewhere else as we usually feel in these types of situations.

01:03:12.643 --> 01:03:13.223
[SPEAKER_03]: So, all right.

01:03:14.423 --> 01:03:18.244
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, if that's it, let's move on.

01:03:18.284 --> 01:03:27.067
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of other cloud services, GameStop, they have a cloud streaming service that's going to be coming to PCs, tablets, and internet TVs.

01:03:29.047 --> 01:03:34.609
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, you may remember that they acquired Spawn Labs and Impulse last year.

01:03:36.329 --> 01:03:42.211
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, it's based on consumer feedback, our success in selling mobile devices and imminent launch of new

01:03:42.791 --> 01:03:43.753
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

01:03:57.834 --> 01:04:03.419
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably because I would be willing to bet that those other companies have their own streaming ideas in place.

01:04:03.799 --> 01:04:04.760
[SPEAKER_11]: Like we know Sony does.

01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:06.201
[SPEAKER_11]: Clearly Sony does, right?

01:04:06.281 --> 01:04:09.584
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe Microsoft's kind of going that similar route.

01:04:09.664 --> 01:04:13.747
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's not that, yes, we're not going to put our stuff on those consoles.

01:04:13.948 --> 01:04:18.772
[SPEAKER_11]: More like those console developers don't want us to put our stuff on their consoles.

01:04:20.553 --> 01:04:36.288
[SPEAKER_03]: you know one of the first rumors I read was that Microsoft bought OnLive which would seem like a no it's just that's not what happened you know because sometimes Microsoft buys companies but I think in this case they'll try to just reinvent it and make it better and put their own name on it you know what I mean

01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:41.951
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I don't think... And if it was bought by Microsoft, they'd be more... More open about it.

01:04:42.051 --> 01:04:42.932
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair about it.

01:04:43.112 --> 01:04:44.252
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to lay everybody off.

01:04:44.553 --> 01:04:47.854
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was one of the first early... You know how Twitter goes.

01:04:49.015 --> 01:04:51.996
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's a skeptic and everybody's an analyst.

01:04:52.936 --> 01:04:54.057
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:05.886
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, they're saying, I guess GameStop had proposed a scenario before where they were saying that users would need to own a retail copy of a particular game they wish to stream from cloud.

01:05:06.366 --> 01:05:13.691
[SPEAKER_11]: Although now that's not necessarily going to be the case because if it's not going to tie into consoles, then what are they going to own?

01:05:14.191 --> 01:05:15.352
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I don't know.

01:05:15.512 --> 01:05:19.194
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an interesting idea and I know how they're selling their own tablets and stuff, but

01:05:20.677 --> 01:05:23.039
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems like it's such a crowded market space out there.

01:05:23.059 --> 01:05:32.867
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I know you can trade in games for these tablets and phones and stuff, but why would I want to buy, why would I want to stream games from them?

01:05:32.927 --> 01:05:37.110
[SPEAKER_11]: That just doesn't, I don't know, it just doesn't seem appealing to me at all.

01:05:40.115 --> 01:05:46.341
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the idea of being able to stream demos and things like that without having to download... Like that whole Secret World.

01:05:46.501 --> 01:05:47.622
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked about that a couple weeks ago.

01:05:47.662 --> 01:05:49.524
[SPEAKER_03]: This MMO that I tried out, the Secret World.

01:05:49.825 --> 01:05:54.810
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to download a 15 gig thing to try that just to figure out that, you know what, I don't really have time for this right now.

01:05:55.030 --> 01:06:00.736
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have been a lot nicer if I could have just streamed it through something like this to make my opinion.

01:06:01.016 --> 01:06:02.978
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are other MMOs that allow you to do this.

01:06:03.058 --> 01:06:06.321
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry to be so MMO-centric, but, you know, it's kind of what comes to mind.

01:06:07.421 --> 01:06:10.164
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great use for the streaming technology is the demos.

01:06:10.584 --> 01:06:14.607
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, are you getting your full graphical potential of the game that way?

01:06:15.088 --> 01:06:17.250
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, but... Yeah, that's another thing.

01:06:17.290 --> 01:06:27.378
[SPEAKER_11]: And then also, you know, with some of these devices, you know, not everybody's upgraded their wireless networks, so you may be running wireless G, and that's going to throttle you a little bit, and...

01:06:29.953 --> 01:06:34.244
[SPEAKER_11]: or, you know, you have to be connected to the Wi-Fi for this stuff to work for the most part.

01:06:35.407 --> 01:06:35.708
[SPEAKER_11]: I just...

01:06:37.485 --> 01:06:40.567
[SPEAKER_03]: My tablet has a weird tendency to cut in and out of the Wi-Fi too.

01:06:40.948 --> 01:06:44.950
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be connected to Wi-Fi and then once every 15 minutes it just drops for 15 seconds.

01:06:45.431 --> 01:06:48.253
[SPEAKER_03]: And that'll kill your game if I'm trying to stream gamings off that.

01:06:48.273 --> 01:06:51.315
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't like dealing with GameStop.

01:06:51.375 --> 01:06:52.415
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of where it's at.

01:06:52.435 --> 01:06:53.316
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's a good point.

01:06:53.836 --> 01:06:58.039
[SPEAKER_11]: They will find a way to take the shrink wrap off those digital downloads before I purchase them.

01:06:58.579 --> 01:06:59.720
[SPEAKER_11]: I just know it's going to happen.

01:07:01.461 --> 01:07:08.668
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well this is a game that maybe some of you will be streaming through a console later, unconfirmed, but I don't know, it's a big game.

01:07:09.549 --> 01:07:10.790
[SPEAKER_03]: Tekken Tag Tournament 2.

01:07:12.572 --> 01:07:13.393
[SPEAKER_03]: You excited about this?

01:07:13.974 --> 01:07:18.438
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some more information that came out about this from Gamescom.

01:07:18.478 --> 01:07:20.320
[SPEAKER_03]: Tekken Tag Tournament 2, it will support 3D.

01:07:22.061 --> 01:07:24.542
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can have 3D fighting and kicking and all that.

01:07:24.802 --> 01:07:25.942
[SPEAKER_03]: 3D can be switched on or off.

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:29.084
[SPEAKER_03]: The depth can be adjusted to whatever it is that you like on there.

01:07:29.464 --> 01:07:36.346
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also something called Tekken Tunes where you can make your own custom soundtrack by importing your own CDs or MP3s or whatever.

01:07:36.746 --> 01:07:40.868
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also Fight Lab which is a way that beginners can learn the play mechanics.

01:07:41.308 --> 01:07:47.730
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a robot fighter named Combot and you will practice your techniques on that in order to get through the Fight Lab.

01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:48.550
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

01:08:09.861 --> 01:08:10.521
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura?

01:08:39.133 --> 01:08:39.713
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy XIV

01:08:59.426 --> 01:08:59.967
[SPEAKER_06]: Indeed.

01:09:00.927 --> 01:09:09.834
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, basically they have this thing called a Realm Reborn, which is the relaunch of Final Fantasy XIV.

01:09:11.735 --> 01:09:21.923
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's an interview with Naoki Yoshida who is saying that losing your fans' trust is an easy thing to do and regaining it is very hard.

01:09:22.763 --> 01:09:29.506
[SPEAKER_06]: They really think that they're going to be able to regain the fans' trust by rebuilding Final Fantasy XIV.

01:09:30.047 --> 01:09:31.947
[SPEAKER_06]: And they want that to be where they launch it from.

01:09:31.988 --> 01:09:33.088
[SPEAKER_06]: Say, hey, this is great.

01:09:33.628 --> 01:09:35.329
[SPEAKER_06]: What's XV and XVI going to be like?

01:09:35.549 --> 01:09:37.070
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, first of all, stop numbering them.

01:09:37.987 --> 01:09:40.129
[SPEAKER_03]: They won't be online MMOs, let's hope

01:10:08.351 --> 01:10:19.067
[SPEAKER_06]: So, another thing that he pointed out is that in the entire history of the Final Fantasy series, there has not been one that failed, which is why they're not giving up on 14th.

01:10:20.061 --> 01:10:23.723
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of people that respond to that by saying, what about XIII?

01:10:24.403 --> 01:10:28.065
[SPEAKER_03]: But XIII wasn't, they wouldn't have made XIII too if XIII was a failure.

01:10:29.025 --> 01:10:34.727
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people just straight up didn't like XIII, which I can get the reasons why people weren't into XIII.

01:10:34.867 --> 01:10:35.868
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked it an awful lot.

01:10:35.968 --> 01:10:38.049
[SPEAKER_06]: If you didn't like it, it doesn't mean something failed.

01:10:38.209 --> 01:10:38.889
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

01:10:39.029 --> 01:10:39.810
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good point.

01:10:40.170 --> 01:10:41.210
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good point, Internet.

01:10:41.230 --> 01:10:43.151
[SPEAKER_06]: It just means that you don't like it.

01:10:43.311 --> 01:10:44.171
[SPEAKER_06]: Other people do.

01:10:44.352 --> 01:10:44.732
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

01:10:44.792 --> 01:10:45.292
[SPEAKER_06]: Get over it.

01:10:45.872 --> 01:10:48.313
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't take, this is, okay, I have to rant a minute.

01:10:48.953 --> 01:10:54.936
[SPEAKER_06]: It pisses me off when I say I don't like something and someone else immediately says, oh, well, I do, you're wrong.

01:10:55.496 --> 01:10:57.217
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, well, I do as if I'm wrong.

01:10:57.917 --> 01:10:58.938
[SPEAKER_06]: Or vice versa.

01:11:00.618 --> 01:11:11.423
[SPEAKER_06]: One person liking something or disliking something that you do not is not a personal reflection on you, oh, person of very small willpower and self-worth.

01:11:12.143 --> 01:11:13.984
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, end of rant.

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:17.585
[SPEAKER_03]: But we can all agree Final Fantasy XIV was bad, right?

01:11:17.805 --> 01:11:18.446
[SPEAKER_03]: We can all agree on that.

01:11:18.466 --> 01:11:18.947
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't play it.

01:11:19.027 --> 01:11:20.390
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually can't tell you if it was bad or not.

01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:21.271
[SPEAKER_03]: It probably was.

01:11:21.672 --> 01:11:25.558
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played it, but from what I heard... Oh, I'm just trying to make a joke.

01:11:25.638 --> 01:11:27.421
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously somebody's paying for it out there.

01:11:27.461 --> 01:11:28.663
[SPEAKER_03]: They wouldn't have any servers running.

01:11:28.945 --> 01:11:31.548
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm sure there's people that probably like it.

01:11:31.708 --> 01:11:34.352
[SPEAKER_06]: There are people who are like, I don't have anything else better to do.

01:11:34.432 --> 01:11:38.657
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like our chat room at live.vognetwork.com has suddenly become a support group.

01:11:39.197 --> 01:11:42.121
[SPEAKER_03]: Breakman says, some of us like Final Fantasy XIII.

01:11:42.441 --> 01:11:44.283
[SPEAKER_03]: Jvmon says, I like XIII.

01:11:44.344 --> 01:11:46.206
[SPEAKER_03]: Stan says, hey, I liked XIII.

01:11:46.246 --> 01:11:46.686
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't like XII.

01:11:47.347 --> 01:11:49.369
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked what I played of it, I just got a little bored.

01:11:49.429 --> 01:11:52.653
[SPEAKER_03]: Dungeon Busters says XIII was still commercially successful.

01:11:52.953 --> 01:11:55.576
[SPEAKER_03]: Kitsune says, I liked Final Fantasy XIII too.

01:11:56.016 --> 01:11:59.540
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't like Dash 2 as much, just because of that ending.

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:01.922
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, it's the whole...

01:12:02.743 --> 01:12:05.485
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:12:30.730 --> 01:12:36.915
[SPEAKER_03]: JV Mon in chat says, I dislike Final Fantasy 7, but respect other people's opinions who differ from my own.

01:12:37.896 --> 01:12:38.076
[SPEAKER_03]: See?

01:12:38.156 --> 01:12:38.957
[SPEAKER_03]: A model citizen.

01:12:39.237 --> 01:12:39.497
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

01:12:41.059 --> 01:12:43.801
[SPEAKER_03]: RDG Singe says, I like Duke Nukem Forever.

01:12:45.502 --> 01:12:46.823
[SPEAKER_06]: You are entitled to like it.

01:12:48.385 --> 01:12:49.525
[SPEAKER_06]: You are entitled to like it.

01:12:49.966 --> 01:12:53.829
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally think that it was, what's a good description?

01:12:54.930 --> 01:12:56.751
[SPEAKER_06]: A festering pile of shit, but...

01:13:01.873 --> 01:13:03.275
[SPEAKER_06]: I love 10 and 10 too.

01:13:03.315 --> 01:13:03.816
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

01:13:05.238 --> 01:13:07.220
[SPEAKER_06]: Brakeman says, stop talking about my low self-esteem.

01:13:07.281 --> 01:13:07.721
[SPEAKER_06]: How dare you?

01:13:07.761 --> 01:13:08.602
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, what are we talking about?

01:13:09.323 --> 01:13:09.664
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just...

01:13:12.714 --> 01:13:13.694
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what it is.

01:13:14.175 --> 01:13:26.579
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a big internet thing, definitely, but it's also a human thing for people to want everyone to like the same things that they do or hate the same things that they do and poo-poo anybody else who doesn't think the way I do, damn it, politics.

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:33.742
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is a little bit more important, but it's... Now, video games are the most important thing.

01:13:33.762 --> 01:13:34.683
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking about?

01:13:36.723 --> 01:13:40.145
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's at the same time as like, okay, Final Fantasy...

01:13:41.309 --> 01:13:44.690
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy XIV, they're looking at it as a failure.

01:13:45.690 --> 01:13:48.491
[SPEAKER_06]: Fiscally, it's probably a failure for them.

01:13:48.531 --> 01:13:51.192
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably pulling in just enough money to keep a couple servers up.

01:13:51.312 --> 01:13:53.212
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a little bit unprecedented.

01:13:54.073 --> 01:14:02.075
[SPEAKER_03]: No matter what your personal opinion is on XIV, if you think we're too hard on it or what, it is unprecedented for a game company to come out and apologize for a game.

01:14:02.577 --> 01:14:02.837
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

01:14:04.438 --> 01:14:07.279
[SPEAKER_06]: And they are taking steps to fix it.

01:14:07.319 --> 01:14:10.480
[SPEAKER_06]: They clearly believe that there's something with that product that's worth salvaging.

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:11.600
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:20.443
[SPEAKER_06]: And for all the people out there, like, what brought me to this point, regardless, say 13 was a failure, fiscally, financially, I'm sorry, that's what I mean.

01:14:20.643 --> 01:14:21.264
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it a failure?

01:14:21.544 --> 01:14:21.684
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

01:14:21.864 --> 01:14:23.865
[SPEAKER_06]: It made them buckets of money.

01:14:25.768 --> 01:14:33.592
[SPEAKER_03]: GameGuru in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, for example, I don't like F-Zero, but I respect that it is a great game, just not a racing game I like.

01:14:33.632 --> 01:14:35.473
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you are entitled to your wrong opinion.

01:14:36.113 --> 01:14:36.693
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

01:14:37.454 --> 01:14:38.334
[SPEAKER_03]: Now go sit in the corner.

01:14:38.534 --> 01:14:39.094
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's me.

01:14:39.635 --> 01:14:40.955
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like strategy games.

01:14:42.236 --> 01:14:43.697
[SPEAKER_06]: Couldn't sit through Warcraft to play it.

01:14:44.177 --> 01:14:45.137
[SPEAKER_06]: Love World of Warcraft.

01:14:45.978 --> 01:14:46.918
[SPEAKER_03]: The third time.

01:14:49.677 --> 01:14:49.977
[SPEAKER_06]: Fourth.

01:14:50.117 --> 01:14:50.578
[SPEAKER_06]: Fourth, Rob.

01:14:50.598 --> 01:14:50.838
[SPEAKER_06]: Fourth.

01:14:50.998 --> 01:14:51.418
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sorry.

01:14:52.059 --> 01:14:52.679
[SPEAKER_03]: Fourth time's the charm.

01:14:52.699 --> 01:14:55.561
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I played with each expansion until I liked it.

01:14:56.862 --> 01:14:58.503
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean, I love the universe.

01:14:58.523 --> 01:15:00.484
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate the first series of games.

01:15:00.964 --> 01:15:01.264
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?

01:15:02.285 --> 01:15:04.987
[SPEAKER_06]: It just has to... Personal preference...

01:15:05.427 --> 01:15:07.468
[SPEAKER_03]: I notoriously can't stand Final Fantasy VIII.

01:15:07.668 --> 01:15:11.890
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not the story that bothers me, it's that fucking fighting system ruined.

01:15:12.010 --> 01:15:12.390
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

01:15:12.690 --> 01:15:14.591
[SPEAKER_06]: I loved the story so much.

01:15:14.951 --> 01:15:17.191
[SPEAKER_06]: By the time I got to the third disc, four for reals.

01:15:17.612 --> 01:15:24.254
[SPEAKER_06]: But the whole point is that take personal opinion out of the equation and look at it for what it is.

01:15:24.354 --> 01:15:25.535
[SPEAKER_06]: How much money did it make?

01:15:25.775 --> 01:15:27.335
[SPEAKER_06]: How big of a player base does it have?

01:15:28.116 --> 01:15:31.697
[SPEAKER_06]: That determines in the terms... That's what the stockholders are looking at.

01:15:31.957 --> 01:15:32.397
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

01:15:32.798 --> 01:15:37.280
[SPEAKER_06]: That determines right there if something is a failure as a product or not.

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:41.962
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, for everyone who bought Final Fantasy XIII and hate it, they still got the money.

01:15:42.382 --> 01:15:42.863
[SPEAKER_06]: They like it.

01:15:43.143 --> 01:15:43.423
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

01:15:43.623 --> 01:15:44.544
[SPEAKER_06]: They still got your money at one.

01:15:45.384 --> 01:15:45.804
[SPEAKER_06]: End of story.

01:15:46.685 --> 01:15:52.348
[SPEAKER_06]: But when you've got an ongoing product that people are going to pay a subscription for, that's a different story.

01:15:52.908 --> 01:15:54.869
[SPEAKER_06]: And for that you have to deliver month after month.

01:15:55.925 --> 01:16:00.837
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well let's travel around the world and check out what possibly controversial new releases are coming out this week.

01:16:01.398 --> 01:16:03.302
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know if there's anything controversial, but we'll see.

01:16:03.683 --> 01:16:04.766
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start in the U.S., Loki.

01:16:05.509 --> 01:16:06.249
[SPEAKER_11]: This is going to be short.

01:16:07.190 --> 01:16:10.251
[SPEAKER_11]: Transformers, Fall of Cybertron, PS3 and 360.

01:16:11.571 --> 01:16:11.871
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

01:16:12.411 --> 01:16:12.771
[SPEAKER_11]: Dang.

01:16:13.052 --> 01:16:16.573
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we did just have a system launch today in a big Nintendo game.

01:16:16.613 --> 01:16:18.753
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's not technically a new system.

01:16:18.793 --> 01:16:22.295
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about as new as, say, New Super Mario Bros.

01:16:22.315 --> 01:16:22.295
2.

01:16:22.395 --> 01:16:25.356
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some big PC games in a couple weeks, too.

01:16:25.736 --> 01:16:28.257
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's that.

01:16:29.497 --> 01:16:31.599
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's go to Japan.

01:16:31.919 --> 01:16:34.521
[SPEAKER_03]: Japan's looking a little bit empty this week as well.

01:16:34.621 --> 01:16:39.165
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Xbox 360, there is the Witcher 2 Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition.

01:16:39.405 --> 01:16:42.147
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what's enhanced about that, but that's on the 360 this week.

01:16:42.568 --> 01:16:45.670
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only thing on the 360 in Japan.

01:16:46.111 --> 01:16:51.515
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, on the PlayStation 3, No More Heroes Red Zone Edition gets the best treatments.

01:16:51.535 --> 01:16:52.456
[SPEAKER_03]: That means a price reduction.

01:16:53.016 --> 01:16:54.237
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I don't know what this is.

01:16:54.297 --> 01:16:55.779
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a hybrid disc.

01:16:55.819 --> 01:16:57.520
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a game and an anime.

01:16:57.921 --> 01:17:04.206
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Rine no Lagrange, Kamogawa Days, and it's the game and the anime.

01:17:05.187 --> 01:17:09.611
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of something we see on the PlayStation 3 happen a little bit is that you have the game slash movie or whatever.

01:17:09.631 --> 01:17:11.533
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's a PlayStation Network game and the movie.

01:17:11.693 --> 01:17:12.193
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:46.423
[SPEAKER_03]: Why I don't have a Vita Maybe you'll have to get one for Hatsune Miku Project Diva F You're not a Project Diva fan?

01:17:46.463 --> 01:17:49.865
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought you were I am, but I don't have a Vita, so what does it matter?

01:17:49.965 --> 01:18:08.173
[SPEAKER_03]: Well you can get, in Japan, on the 30th, you can get a Vita Hatsune Miku Limited Edition Well I'll let the people who actually have jobs and money get one for me You should sell Etsy's to fund your Vita The fuck would I make on Etsy?

01:18:11.691 --> 01:18:13.192
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm selling my rage!

01:18:13.853 --> 01:18:20.641
[SPEAKER_06]: You get an mp3 of me going You can record people's voicemail messages.

01:18:22.443 --> 01:18:24.245
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you could set up their voicemail messages.

01:18:24.265 --> 01:18:26.127
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, this is DarkSakura, go away.

01:18:26.868 --> 01:18:27.209
[SPEAKER_06]: Beep!

01:18:29.707 --> 01:18:32.008
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, this is DarkSakura from Orange Lounge Radio.

01:18:32.068 --> 01:18:35.008
[SPEAKER_03]: Chances are I don't like you or your friend, but leave a message anyway.

01:18:35.128 --> 01:18:35.489
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

01:18:35.769 --> 01:18:39.670
[SPEAKER_11]: That reminds me, I got to record a voicemail message for my Google.

01:18:40.090 --> 01:18:47.732
[SPEAKER_11]: I have my Google voice number that apparently Omaha Steaks likes calling daily to market me.

01:18:48.052 --> 01:18:49.172
[SPEAKER_11]: I forgot that I had set it up.

01:18:49.192 --> 01:18:50.753
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you buy steaks from them once or something?

01:18:50.773 --> 01:18:52.433
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I had a gift card that I won.

01:18:52.513 --> 01:18:58.794
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was like, okay, I got to make a number that they can call and I got to make an email address that they can email to.

01:18:58.854 --> 01:19:04.215
[SPEAKER_11]: So I gave them the email address I don't use and then I gave them that phone number.

01:19:04.335 --> 01:19:11.577
[SPEAKER_11]: So now I need to figure out how to forward that to, I don't know, the void.

01:19:11.597 --> 01:19:13.317
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, this is Loki's voicemail.

01:19:13.397 --> 01:19:14.258
[SPEAKER_03]: Please leave a message.

01:19:14.298 --> 01:19:16.278
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you're Omaha Steaks, then fuck off.

01:19:17.659 --> 01:19:18.180
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

01:19:19.583 --> 01:19:20.585
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll record it for you.

01:19:22.699 --> 01:19:24.540
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you're trying to sell shit, then get lost.

01:19:25.321 --> 01:19:27.943
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless you're going to send me free steak, in which case you can send me free steak.

01:19:28.743 --> 01:19:30.464
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's not free, I don't fucking care.

01:19:33.346 --> 01:19:40.451
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Nintendo 3DS, Boku wa Koku Kansai-kan, Airport Hero 3D Honolulu.

01:19:41.112 --> 01:19:46.395
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea what Airport Hero is, but I imagine in my head it's a lot like the... What's that?

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:48.957
[SPEAKER_03]: Pocket Planes on the iOS system.

01:19:49.497 --> 01:19:50.158
[SPEAKER_03]: Or on the iOS.

01:19:50.378 --> 01:19:51.038
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, something like that.

01:19:51.339 --> 01:19:52.019
[SPEAKER_03]: iPhone and all that.

01:19:52.099 --> 01:19:53.601
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that's it for Japanese release dates.

01:19:53.801 --> 01:19:54.922
[SPEAKER_03]: How about the UK, DarkSakura?

01:19:55.803 --> 01:19:56.724
[SPEAKER_06]: A few things, a few.

01:19:57.565 --> 01:20:02.671
[SPEAKER_06]: We have on the 21st, Darksiders 2 and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure HD.

01:20:03.452 --> 01:20:05.815
[SPEAKER_06]: God, that series has been out in Japan for like, what, ever?

01:20:06.996 --> 01:20:08.338
[SPEAKER_06]: Since like, the mid-80s?

01:20:09.159 --> 01:20:10.540
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're just now getting stuff for it?

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:10.941
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just...

01:20:11.221 --> 01:20:12.362
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever.

01:20:12.662 --> 01:20:16.065
[SPEAKER_06]: 22nd, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure HD on the PS3.

01:20:16.946 --> 01:20:25.874
[SPEAKER_06]: And on the 24th, Dark Souls for PC, Endless Space for PC, and Transformers Fall of Cybertron, which is all my friend has ever talked about and I don't care anymore.

01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:28.250
[SPEAKER_03]: Origins

01:20:51.730 --> 01:20:56.152
[SPEAKER_11]: It's coming to Mac, because they have games on the Mac, so of course it would.

01:20:56.713 --> 01:21:07.418
[SPEAKER_11]: So of course, Peter Moore announced that during Gamescom, it's going to be coming to a few different platforms, including smart TVs, the Mac, Android, and Facebook.

01:21:08.299 --> 01:21:19.965
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're also going to be adding some new features, including free-to-play gaming, which is, I think, where the Facebook and Android comes into play, and achievements.

01:21:21.641 --> 01:21:22.362
[SPEAKER_11]: Hurrah!

01:21:24.925 --> 01:21:25.346
[SPEAKER_03]: Hurray!

01:21:25.426 --> 01:21:28.229
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you can play broken games of Mass Effect 3 on the Mac.

01:21:28.730 --> 01:21:32.374
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that doesn't necessarily mean the games are coming out on those systems, but Origin will be there.

01:21:33.413 --> 01:21:37.056
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Origin cannot... This boggles my mind.

01:21:37.296 --> 01:21:42.860
[SPEAKER_03]: If Alan and I want to play our two friends at the same house in the Bay Area, we can't do it.

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:46.623
[SPEAKER_03]: Origin can't handle two people in one place versus two in another place.

01:21:46.943 --> 01:21:50.046
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do two on one, or them two against one.

01:21:50.066 --> 01:21:51.187
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't do two on two.

01:21:51.527 --> 01:21:53.048
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not possible in Origin's setup.

01:21:54.082 --> 01:21:54.402
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

01:21:55.583 --> 01:21:55.883
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

01:21:57.264 --> 01:21:58.645
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet Steam can handle that.

01:21:59.786 --> 01:22:02.968
[SPEAKER_03]: To be fair, we haven't tried, but I don't see why it wouldn't work.

01:22:03.428 --> 01:22:08.432
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never really had a game that failed miserably playing it through Steam.

01:22:08.512 --> 01:22:11.374
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a great Civ V match not that long ago.

01:22:12.154 --> 01:22:14.676
[SPEAKER_03]: Borderlands is through GameSpy, so that's a little different.

01:22:15.436 --> 01:22:17.658
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't measure that, so whatever.

01:22:18.328 --> 01:22:18.568
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:22:19.608 --> 01:22:24.289
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, speaking of underappreciated classics, the Neo Geo.

01:22:24.349 --> 01:22:25.570
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember the Neo Geo?

01:22:25.890 --> 01:22:27.150
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I've looked at one the other day.

01:22:27.670 --> 01:22:28.710
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got one in your house, right?

01:22:28.730 --> 01:22:29.650
[SPEAKER_03]: I have two, actually.

01:22:29.691 --> 01:22:31.231
[SPEAKER_03]: Those fuckers are expensive, too.

01:22:31.251 --> 01:22:32.471
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a Neo Geo and a Neo CD.

01:22:32.511 --> 01:22:33.871
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how Dan got his Neo Geo?

01:22:34.452 --> 01:22:36.232
[SPEAKER_06]: He traded a Sega CD for it.

01:22:36.852 --> 01:22:37.132
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

01:22:37.812 --> 01:22:39.853
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you might have to make room on the shelf for this.

01:22:39.973 --> 01:22:42.453
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Neo Geo X Gold.

01:22:42.873 --> 01:22:43.434
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

01:22:43.734 --> 01:22:45.294
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a new system.

01:22:46.174 --> 01:23:08.574
[SPEAKER_03]: and now there were rumors about this before that this was coming but it is confirmed the Neo Geo X Gold is a thing it's a $200 thing hey Neo Geos were never known for being cheap right now the cool thing is though even for being a $200 system it does come with a bunch of pre-installed games these games used to be like $200 a piece if you remember but

01:23:09.294 --> 01:23:20.080
[SPEAKER_03]: Such classics like Art of Fighting 2, Magician Lord, Metal Slug, Baseball Stars 2, Fatal Fury and Fatal Fury Special, King of Fighters 95, Samurai Showdown 2, King of the Monsters.

01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:21.181
[SPEAKER_03]: All this is built in.

01:23:21.201 --> 01:23:22.541
[SPEAKER_06]: I have four of those games already.

01:23:22.681 --> 01:23:25.243
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of, I mean, and I'm only reading part of the list.

01:23:25.283 --> 01:23:28.504
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a good, looks like about 20 games or so that are installed.

01:23:29.845 --> 01:23:32.527
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed though, I don't see Bust a Move on this list.

01:23:32.567 --> 01:23:33.067
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see, or

01:23:33.948 --> 01:23:35.150
[SPEAKER_03]: Puzzle Bob or whatever you want to call it.

01:23:35.171 --> 01:23:36.934
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, these are all SNK games.

01:23:37.255 --> 01:23:38.337
[SPEAKER_06]: That was Taito.

01:23:38.417 --> 01:23:38.818
[SPEAKER_03]: Good point.

01:23:38.938 --> 01:23:39.299
[SPEAKER_03]: Good point.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.086
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyhow, there is also this... I guess here's the weird thing.

01:23:44.672 --> 01:23:54.558
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a handheld, so it's a handheld system, but it's also, I guess, you can plug it into a docking station, and then it's a TV thing, too?

01:23:55.499 --> 01:23:56.900
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of cool, I gotta say.

01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:58.941
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a docking station that's a video out.

01:23:59.561 --> 01:24:00.022
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of cool.

01:24:00.042 --> 01:24:08.187
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, that's pretty cool that my Dingu does the same thing, and was a whole hell of a lot cheaper, and yeah.

01:24:09.928 --> 01:24:13.972
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's kind of cool, but $200 is a steep price to pay for nostalgia.

01:24:14.052 --> 01:24:27.264
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, you can purchase one of those 48-in-1, 60-in-1 Neo Geo arcade cards and get a Super Gun for way fucking cheaper than that.

01:24:27.544 --> 01:24:28.585
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a Super Gun.

01:24:28.685 --> 01:24:30.047
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like an all-in-one card thing.

01:24:30.768 --> 01:24:34.613
[SPEAKER_11]: That literally plugs into Neo Geo controllers.

01:24:34.694 --> 01:24:36.096
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pinned out for that.

01:24:36.496 --> 01:24:41.504
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have a 61 cart, so... Nope, not gonna buy it.

01:24:43.075 --> 01:24:43.936
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know.

01:24:45.177 --> 01:24:47.999
[SPEAKER_03]: This thing would have to be really something special in order to get me to buy it.

01:24:48.059 --> 01:24:54.123
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say, though, the little joystick they have with it is like a mock replica.

01:24:54.183 --> 01:24:56.765
[SPEAKER_03]: Those things are rock solid, those controllers with the four buttons.

01:24:57.365 --> 01:24:58.466
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nice controller.

01:24:58.807 --> 01:24:59.427
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say that.

01:25:00.408 --> 01:25:00.688
[SPEAKER_03]: I love ours.

01:25:00.728 --> 01:25:01.508
[SPEAKER_03]: Your game doesn't have that.

01:25:02.609 --> 01:25:07.073
[SPEAKER_06]: I love them, honestly, playing all these games, because it's the arcade experience.

01:25:07.193 --> 01:25:08.754
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll give it that.

01:25:08.834 --> 01:25:09.414
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

01:25:11.938 --> 01:25:18.932
[SPEAKER_03]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com, use the passphrase milkshake.

01:25:19.329 --> 01:25:26.093
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's take a trip back down memory lane to a time when the Neo Geo was, you know, more relevant.

01:25:26.213 --> 01:25:28.895
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, you did not pick a Neo Geo game tonight, did you?

01:25:28.955 --> 01:25:29.515
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not.

01:25:29.735 --> 01:25:30.395
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, that's okay.

01:25:31.336 --> 01:25:42.082
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to go down the archives of classic gaming and DarkSakura is going to jump into the vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, even though you might not be able to find it, you kids should play this game right now.

01:25:42.923 --> 01:25:45.344
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

01:25:45.924 --> 01:25:46.545
[SPEAKER_06]: Troubleshooter.

01:25:47.745 --> 01:25:48.666
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone remember this game?

01:25:50.387 --> 01:25:55.250
[SPEAKER_06]: It came out on the Sega Genesis.

01:25:55.811 --> 01:25:56.992
[SPEAKER_06]: It has awesome music.

01:25:58.173 --> 01:25:58.993
[SPEAKER_03]: Play a little bit of it here.

01:25:59.133 --> 01:26:00.995
Assassination Cult.

01:26:06.915 --> 01:26:08.697
[SPEAKER_08]: This game is such a freaking parody, I love it.

01:26:29.855 --> 01:26:34.978
[SPEAKER_06]: The game is a real... It basically just makes fun of itself the whole time.

01:26:35.039 --> 01:26:41.582
[SPEAKER_06]: You play as a girl named Madison, who is a combat operative who has to rescue a prince that has been taken hostage.

01:26:42.143 --> 01:26:44.584
[SPEAKER_06]: And she goes around with her partner, Crystal.

01:26:45.525 --> 01:26:51.929
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, basically, you play as Madison, and Crystal's kind of attached to her butt...

01:26:52.809 --> 01:26:55.070
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the only way I can describe their positioning.

01:26:55.971 --> 01:27:02.634
[SPEAKER_06]: And Crystal always points backwards, but you can flip her to point in the front.

01:27:02.794 --> 01:27:05.035
[SPEAKER_06]: And she's invulnerable to enemy fire.

01:27:05.095 --> 01:27:09.197
[SPEAKER_06]: The only one who has the hitbox is Madison, who you're playing as.

01:27:10.417 --> 01:27:25.110
[SPEAKER_06]: and Crystal is only affected if Madison dies so basically you have a special weapon that helps you during combat and like I said you can flip back and forth you can flip your partner back and forth but you are always facing to the right

01:27:26.812 --> 01:27:28.833
[SPEAKER_06]: and you've got different power-ups.

01:27:28.873 --> 01:27:32.977
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's funny, when you get a power-up, she goes, Thank you!

01:27:33.297 --> 01:27:33.717
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that.

01:27:34.778 --> 01:27:37.320
[SPEAKER_06]: And they make little noises when they get hurt and everything.

01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:39.301
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bubble comes up and says, Ouch!

01:27:39.561 --> 01:27:40.202
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so cute.

01:27:41.443 --> 01:27:44.065
[SPEAKER_06]: But it didn't really have a life system.

01:27:44.645 --> 01:27:47.447
[SPEAKER_06]: You stocked up hit points by getting life-up icons.

01:27:48.588 --> 01:27:54.012
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, it had a sequel in Japan called Battlemania Daiginjo.

01:27:54.973 --> 01:28:01.119
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, we're going to move forward into what makes this game special, and I'm talking more about Battlemania.

01:28:04.042 --> 01:28:06.384
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of slow-paced.

01:28:07.445 --> 01:28:12.209
[SPEAKER_06]: It has this sort of, like I said, the weird playing style in it.

01:28:13.650 --> 01:28:17.194
[SPEAKER_06]: But basically, oh, and in Japan they were called Mania and Maria, sorry.

01:28:17.931 --> 01:28:36.361
[SPEAKER_06]: um they basically go down and shoot weird machines and um it had some really fun stuff thrown in like um uh they had an issue in the game now this was um because uh

01:28:38.380 --> 01:29:05.652
[SPEAKER_06]: the group they were working with which was Studio Uchu Tetsujin which is also called Studio Space Iron Man did not like that Victokai worked for Super Famicom so they had an interesting little easter egg thrown into the game where if you press start, right, and C on the second controller the two heroines in the game will shoot past the Sega logo and you will see Madison jumping up and down on the Super Famicom

01:29:06.773 --> 01:29:08.356
[SPEAKER_06]: Just bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce.

01:29:08.376 --> 01:29:12.945
[SPEAKER_06]: Sega does what Nintendo...

01:29:16.507 --> 01:29:18.108
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not in the English version.

01:29:21.652 --> 01:29:30.460
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically, as things went along, this was going into the sequel, the Battlemania Daigangel.

01:29:31.761 --> 01:29:35.024
[SPEAKER_06]: It had mushrooms come out that...

01:29:37.806 --> 01:29:46.893
[SPEAKER_06]: were part of the power-ups, and it had a fleet of, well, guys that looked like Kate Mario that you had to shoot down.

01:29:49.014 --> 01:29:54.658
[SPEAKER_06]: There was also just a bunch of stuff that was going on with this.

01:29:55.499 --> 01:30:05.445
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's an official picture that came out where it shows the girls playing volleyball

01:30:06.387 --> 01:30:09.589
[SPEAKER_06]: with a Super Famicom and a Hammer.

01:30:11.303 --> 01:30:13.885
[SPEAKER_06]: and then in the game Segagaga.

01:30:14.626 --> 01:30:15.506
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember that one, right?

01:30:15.526 --> 01:30:20.150
[SPEAKER_06]: Where you have to basically, you're trying to save Sega from financial ruin.

01:30:20.771 --> 01:30:30.138
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they get helped in the end of the game by a bunch of characters from their games and out come the two ladies from Battlemania.

01:30:32.039 --> 01:30:37.484
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely, the game itself is definitely a big poop on Nintendo.

01:30:38.402 --> 01:30:39.723
[SPEAKER_06]: But also, it's just really fun.

01:30:39.823 --> 01:30:41.165
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's a fun little shooter.

01:30:41.986 --> 01:30:47.311
[SPEAKER_06]: So, this is a game that I would love to have a copy of, either the US one or the Japanese one.

01:30:47.991 --> 01:30:51.695
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I would just be giddy if I had this game.

01:30:53.196 --> 01:30:55.939
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, I haven't seen it since I was in high school.

01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:57.921
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was a fun game.

01:30:58.922 --> 01:31:02.766
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Troubleshooter.

01:31:04.266 --> 01:31:07.468
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's going to do it for part A of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:31:07.968 --> 01:31:09.189
[SPEAKER_03]: But don't go anywhere, guys.

01:31:09.209 --> 01:31:26.758
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take a break and then when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, your Twitter questions at twitter.com slash OLR, the Fugle question of the week, some stuff going on with Valve, some stuff on the Wii U and your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com all after a quick break.

01:31:26.858 --> 01:31:27.258
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, Jamie?

01:31:29.182 --> 01:31:31.083
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, something special for you guys tonight.

01:31:31.183 --> 01:31:34.885
[SPEAKER_03]: A rare music break for both the live and the podcast listeners.

01:31:35.265 --> 01:31:39.347
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a track from the Darksiders 2 soundtrack scored by Jesper Kidd.

01:31:39.747 --> 01:31:44.789
[SPEAKER_03]: Big thanks to Something Else Music Works, www.sumthing.com

01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:51.571
[SPEAKER_03]: or on Twitter at sumthingdigital for giving us the opportunity to play it for all our listeners this week.

01:31:52.032 --> 01:31:58.914
[SPEAKER_03]: If you dig it, check out the Darksiders 2 soundtrack in physical and digital form on Amazon and in digital form on iTunes.

01:31:59.234 --> 01:32:04.056
[SPEAKER_03]: So here it is, Jesper Kidd from the Darksiders 2 soundtrack with The Corruption.

01:32:04.356 --> 01:32:08.598
[SPEAKER_03]: You're participating with Orange Lounge Radio at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

01:32:08.618 --> 01:32:08.598
... ...

01:32:15.651 --> 01:32:16.513
Thanks for watching!

01:32:57.100 --> 01:32:58.021
Thank you for watching!

01:33:38.846 --> 01:33:40.488
Thanks for watching!

01:36:28.593 --> 01:36:29.520
Thanks for watching!

01:37:10.766 --> 01:37:20.694
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 4, excuse me, yeah, 470, I lost count for a minute there, for this August 19th, 2012.

01:37:22.015 --> 01:37:28.720
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was awesome, thanks again to Something Music for letting us play that during the break there, that was great.

01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:36.606
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, that was The Corruption from the Darksiders 2 soundtrack by Jesper Kidd, that was really cool, hoped you guys liked that too.

01:37:36.926 --> 01:37:37.386
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked it.

01:37:37.406 --> 01:37:37.907
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was nice.

01:37:38.227 --> 01:37:45.633
[SPEAKER_03]: And some folks in chat there, DungeonBuster says, at live.vognetwork.com says, I thought Kid did a great job on the Darksiders 2 stuff.

01:37:45.893 --> 01:37:49.356
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a base theme in this one that runs into other pieces.

01:37:49.736 --> 01:37:50.197
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

01:37:51.558 --> 01:37:59.564
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're going to get back into the show with some rapid fire news, some quick news stories here, and we'll start it off with Loki.

01:38:00.325 --> 01:38:05.329
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so the Vita is getting some new firmware soon, version 1.8.

01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:19.104
[SPEAKER_11]: and this is kind of cool because one of the complaints about the Vita before were with the visually impaired having trouble accessing stuff on the Vita because there was no button controls on the home screen.

01:38:19.144 --> 01:38:20.045
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's going to change.

01:38:20.225 --> 01:38:28.474
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that there will be button controls on the home screen, you'll be able to use the directional pad and stuff to navigate those screens and...

01:38:29.054 --> 01:38:29.274
[SPEAKER_11]: and so on.

01:38:54.508 --> 01:39:02.857
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess there's going to be a new cross controller icon in the remote play for the cross controller supporting games.

01:39:04.638 --> 01:39:06.040
[SPEAKER_11]: And then other tweaks, I'm sure.

01:39:08.177 --> 01:39:08.377
[SPEAKER_11]: Black Ops 2

01:39:38.778 --> 01:39:39.919
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

01:39:59.881 --> 01:40:01.362
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's something that they're adding in there.

01:40:01.843 --> 01:40:10.250
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, League Play is going to be added in as well as the option to do live streams of your gameplay.

01:40:10.270 --> 01:40:15.013
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can have live streams and you can also do shoutcasts of commentary.

01:40:15.033 --> 01:40:15.434
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can have

01:40:15.854 --> 01:40:43.385
[SPEAKER_11]: commentary going over the whole thing as well and that's built into the goddamn game that's interesting I guess some people harnessing the types of things we see on like Ustream and Twitch TV and all that interesting yeah so that's pretty cool and then there's also a rumor that Black Ops 2 is heading to the Wii U according to a QA tester's resume who was on LinkedIn I'm just gonna make it easy for you it's not a fucking rumor it's coming on the Wii U I mean I've been saying it for weeks now so it is coming on the Wii U

01:40:44.105 --> 01:40:48.288
[SPEAKER_11]: I know because I've seen the UPC and other things.

01:40:48.668 --> 01:40:50.289
[SPEAKER_11]: But yes, duh.

01:40:50.389 --> 01:40:50.969
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, come on.

01:40:51.009 --> 01:40:56.993
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be a simple port of the other games, and Treyarch supports the Wii, so it's going to be coming out.

01:40:57.433 --> 01:41:09.561
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, speaking of the Wii U, SpotPass is apparently going to be a feature of the Wii U. This, again, really strikes me as a type of duh, but it is going around the internet this week that I guess it's kind of the new version of Wii Connect 24, which, you know,

01:41:09.861 --> 01:41:14.542
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that was a thing that your Wii U was always on, but it's not used as well as it could be.

01:41:15.363 --> 01:41:21.024
[SPEAKER_03]: SpotPass, a little better on the DS, so hopefully they're going to implement that more and more through the Nintendo platforms.

01:41:21.664 --> 01:41:26.726
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all coming from a photo of a Wii U development kit that the Wii U will have the SpotPass feature.

01:41:26.806 --> 01:41:27.966
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on, of course.

01:41:28.462 --> 01:41:29.763
[SPEAKER_03]: Team Ninja Metroid Other M

01:41:49.873 --> 01:41:52.215
[SPEAKER_03]: which, you know, was kind of met with mixed reaction.

01:41:52.435 --> 01:41:53.415
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everybody was into it.

01:41:53.495 --> 01:41:58.419
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was pretty good, but, you know, nothing has yet to top Super Metroid for me.

01:41:58.599 --> 01:42:00.500
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, nothing's even really come close, honestly.

01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:01.741
[SPEAKER_03]: What about Fusion?

01:42:04.222 --> 01:42:05.443
[SPEAKER_03]: Close, but still doesn't top it.

01:42:06.424 --> 01:42:10.767
[SPEAKER_03]: The closest thing I would say would be the Metroid Zero, Zero Mission, was probably the closest.

01:42:10.787 --> 01:42:11.587
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the one I'm thinking of?

01:42:11.607 --> 01:42:12.508
[SPEAKER_03]: That was on the Game Boy Advance.

01:42:14.344 --> 01:42:36.037
[SPEAKER_03]: Team Ninja's Yosuke Hayashi says that they are still close to Nintendo and the designer Yoshio Sakamoto Apparently they were both directors of Metroid Other M on the Wii And according to Hayashi, Team Ninja wants to work with Nintendo on another Metroid title

01:42:36.397 --> 01:43:02.864
[SPEAKER_03]: here's a quote unfortunately Metroid is kind of out of our meaning Team Ninja's League as it's Nintendo's game but we're still in close touch with so co-creator Sakamoto-san so we want to do something with him moving forward definitely it really depends on what he wants to do with the game first so you know kind of like a a peace offering there I mean but again at the end of the day if Metroid Other M didn't sell which I don't believe it did sell up to expectations I don't know what the future is going to hold for Metroid but I can't

01:43:03.342 --> 01:43:04.923
[SPEAKER_06]: They totally screwed up with Samus in that game.

01:43:27.850 --> 01:43:30.091
[SPEAKER_03]: Las Ketchup with The Ketchup Song.

01:43:30.131 --> 01:43:31.752
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that, Jen, from back in the day?

01:43:32.333 --> 01:43:32.833
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my God.

01:43:32.973 --> 01:43:33.673

[SPEAKER_03]: Beauty and a beat.

01:43:39.577 --> 01:43:41.078
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even know that that was a thing.

01:43:41.278 --> 01:43:43.139
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that I know it is a thing, it's a thing I'd like to not hear.

01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:44.180
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even know she had beauty.

01:43:44.300 --> 01:43:48.723
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean... She's the beat.

01:43:48.803 --> 01:43:50.464
[SPEAKER_03]: Justin Bieber, I guess, is beauty.

01:43:50.784 --> 01:43:51.565
[SPEAKER_03]: A beautiful lesbian.

01:43:51.645 --> 01:43:52.145
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

[SPEAKER_03]: Army of Lovers with Crucified.

01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:32.224
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that song YouTube that video immediately it is fucking amazing and I cannot stress how great it is over a radio show but you don't understand how awesome it is that that song is in this game until you YouTube the video seriously do it after OLR Army of Lovers Crucified it's in Just Dance 4 they definitely have an eclectic mix they really do they really do Rihanna with Disturbia something new let's see they might be Giants Istanbul

01:44:32.924 --> 01:44:33.404
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.

01:44:33.504 --> 01:44:34.324
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in DDR once.

01:44:34.924 --> 01:44:35.585
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's Ultimix 3.

01:44:36.145 --> 01:44:37.925
[SPEAKER_03]: Elvis Presley with Jailhouse Rock.

01:44:38.665 --> 01:44:40.906

[SPEAKER_03]: Moves Like Jagger.

01:44:47.507 --> 01:44:49.347
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because every fucking game has to have moves like Jagger.

01:44:50.487 --> 01:44:52.128
[SPEAKER_03]: Alexandra Stan, Mr. Saxo Beat.

01:44:52.168 --> 01:44:52.708
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that song?

01:44:53.788 --> 01:44:54.288
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really.

01:44:54.468 --> 01:44:55.588
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Marina and the Diamonds.

01:44:55.868 --> 01:44:57.029
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, it's going to be in there.

01:44:57.109 --> 01:44:58.189
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very British...

01:44:58.709 --> 01:45:02.281
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a good... It's not just eclectic, but it's eclectic like multi-regional.

01:45:02.863 --> 01:45:03.545
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you get a lot of...

01:45:04.366 --> 01:45:05.187
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we get any J-pop?

01:45:05.207 --> 01:45:06.567
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we, do we, do we, do we?

01:45:06.628 --> 01:45:07.828
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that eclectic, unfortunately.

01:45:07.908 --> 01:45:08.089
[SPEAKER_03]: See?

01:45:08.129 --> 01:45:21.557
[SPEAKER_03]: But you do get the B-52s with Rock Lobster, Pink with So What, Halloween Thrills with The Time Warp, which I do believe would be a cover of the Rocky Horror Picture Show song, which is obviously all kinds of amazing.

01:45:22.498 --> 01:45:26.121
[SPEAKER_03]: Too Unlimited with Tribal Dance, as long as we're borrowing from DDR games, right?

01:45:27.181 --> 01:45:29.623

[SPEAKER_11]: Will Smith with Wild Wild West.

01:45:38.729 --> 01:45:41.510
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, that must have been a cheap license.

01:45:42.991 --> 01:45:44.732
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's my favorite.

01:45:45.813 --> 01:45:49.075
[SPEAKER_03]: Skillerex with Rock and Roll will take you to the mountain.

01:45:49.735 --> 01:45:51.256
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you get your dubstep song.

01:45:51.276 --> 01:45:53.217
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never heard that song, and I never plan on it.

01:45:53.958 --> 01:45:55.819
[SPEAKER_06]: No, do not poison my brain.

01:45:55.899 --> 01:45:56.939
[SPEAKER_11]: I am kind of curious.

01:45:57.540 --> 01:45:58.981
[SPEAKER_06]: With shitty dubstep.

01:45:59.241 --> 01:46:00.041
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate dubstep.

01:46:00.381 --> 01:46:01.442
[SPEAKER_11]: Not all dubstep's shitty.

01:46:01.562 --> 01:46:01.942
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is.

01:46:02.162 --> 01:46:02.983
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

01:46:05.485 --> 01:46:06.106
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say this.

01:46:06.426 --> 01:46:12.655
[SPEAKER_03]: We were at brunch today, and this dubstep song, this obvious dubstep song was playing on the speaker.

01:46:12.675 --> 01:46:17.742
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, and I was like, what in the fuck is this?

01:46:18.303 --> 01:46:20.747
[SPEAKER_03]: And Alan's all, oh, it's the hot new single by Car Alarm.

01:46:23.744 --> 01:46:24.424
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a car alarm.

01:46:24.705 --> 01:46:24.825
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

01:46:26.645 --> 01:46:28.726
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't be surprised if there was a group called that, just saying.

01:46:28.966 --> 01:46:31.206
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm surprised they don't have a car alarm that's dubstep.

01:46:32.627 --> 01:46:38.288
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I was like, can I put that in my car to scare away the... Okay, here we go, an OLR exclusive, everybody.

01:46:39.049 --> 01:46:41.709
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura gets introduced to dubstep.

01:46:41.949 --> 01:46:42.650
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

01:46:42.750 --> 01:46:44.110
[SPEAKER_03]: No, take your fingers out of your ear.

01:46:44.150 --> 01:46:46.711
[SPEAKER_03]: This is for science, DarkSakura, for science.

01:46:46.811 --> 01:46:47.211
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

01:47:01.249 --> 01:47:03.030
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, I can't let too much of this play.

01:47:03.970 --> 01:47:06.271
[SPEAKER_03]: I can let a little bit of it play for the purposes of commentary.

01:47:06.511 --> 01:47:09.172
[SPEAKER_03]: But DarkSakura, thoughts on Rock and Roll Will Take You to the Mountain?

01:47:09.573 --> 01:47:10.433
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to quote Becky.

01:47:11.693 --> 01:47:13.474
[SPEAKER_06]: That sort of cruelty will not be tolerated.

01:47:13.494 --> 01:47:18.976
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of like that song, actually.

01:47:18.996 --> 01:47:20.257
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:47:21.277 --> 01:47:24.278
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't he use that same little, oh my god, riff in another song?

01:47:24.719 --> 01:47:25.299
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sure he does.

01:47:25.319 --> 01:47:25.639
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he does.

01:47:32.872 --> 01:47:36.233
[SPEAKER_06]: I would rather listen to Sarah Brightman.

01:47:37.553 --> 01:47:38.794
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know how I feel about Sarah Brightman.

01:47:38.814 --> 01:47:40.555
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Sarah Brightman, though.

01:47:41.255 --> 01:47:44.996
[SPEAKER_03]: She knows how to bring the... I can't... Never mind.

01:47:45.056 --> 01:47:48.438
[SPEAKER_03]: I shouldn't say the word, but she knows how to bring it.

01:47:49.298 --> 01:47:50.219
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:48:18.872 --> 01:48:40.947
[SPEAKER_03]: BlackWolf says the dubstep song we have in rotation is okay, the Skyrim to the knee SSJ100Matt says that's pretty good That's how she was a sitting vampire actually said It always reminds me of downtown Julie Brown Speaking of dubstep, have you seen the new trailer for Borderlands 2?

01:48:41.627 --> 01:48:43.068
[SPEAKER_11]: It's fucking fantastic

01:48:43.689 --> 01:48:44.510
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, is it all dubstep?

01:48:44.530 --> 01:48:45.731
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's not all dubstep.

01:48:46.051 --> 01:48:50.274
[SPEAKER_11]: They reminded me of it because, you know, they had the first trailer they were making fun of the dubstep trailers.

01:48:50.854 --> 01:48:55.478
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, of course, they have, you know, Claptrap doing dubstep stuff.

01:48:55.878 --> 01:48:57.740
[SPEAKER_11]: But, no, the new trailer is fucking awesome.

01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:00.822
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got, you know, the villain basically at the end is like, come and get me.

01:49:01.362 --> 01:49:03.984
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, yeah, I want to fucking kill that guy.

01:49:04.004 --> 01:49:07.247
[SPEAKER_11]: And does it have that same music, that wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop?

01:49:07.267 --> 01:49:08.287
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:49:08.328 --> 01:49:11.530
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember it had that, but it's got some sort of electronica in there.

01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:14.100
[SPEAKER_03]: Exciting, exciting radio.

01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:14.580
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

01:49:14.620 --> 01:49:15.100
[SPEAKER_03]: It's exciting for me.

01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:15.581
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they not have it?

01:49:15.621 --> 01:49:16.521
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe this is it.

01:49:16.561 --> 01:49:17.101
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks live.

01:49:17.121 --> 01:49:18.181
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know if you like this.

01:49:18.201 --> 01:49:19.521
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me try to feel this vibration.

01:49:42.738 --> 01:49:46.940
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is she spasming?

01:49:48.620 --> 01:49:50.781
[SPEAKER_06]: Or doing like some stupid interpretive dance?

01:49:50.801 --> 01:49:51.701
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that song.

01:49:52.061 --> 01:49:53.382
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't like her voice.

01:49:55.763 --> 01:50:00.985
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course she's being all like Jesus-y with her hands up and being carried by her disciples.

01:50:01.005 --> 01:50:02.565
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't care for her voice that much.

01:50:03.525 --> 01:50:05.966
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I thought that she was good in Repo.

01:50:06.086 --> 01:50:06.627
[SPEAKER_06]: That's about it.

01:50:07.547 --> 01:50:09.107
[SPEAKER_03]: Only because she rips her eyes out.

01:50:09.648 --> 01:50:10.428
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah.

01:50:15.123 --> 01:50:17.825
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight is like the Discover New Music on OLR night.

01:50:17.885 --> 01:50:18.925
[SPEAKER_11]: She rips her eyes out.

01:50:18.945 --> 01:50:24.028
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd be a good animated gif for something, like bad YouTube videos or something.

01:50:25.629 --> 01:50:27.150
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised I haven't seen that gif on OLR.

01:50:27.190 --> 01:50:27.630
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they didn't.

01:50:29.731 --> 01:50:31.492
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd rather be blind.

01:50:33.093 --> 01:50:35.675
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to spoil Repo, the lunatic opera, but it's a great movie.

01:50:36.615 --> 01:50:40.017
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's freaking, my man is in it.

01:50:41.081 --> 01:50:42.101
[SPEAKER_03]: Anthony Stewart Head.

01:50:42.342 --> 01:50:42.702
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

01:50:43.962 --> 01:50:45.463
[SPEAKER_06]: He can be my uncle.

01:50:45.743 --> 01:50:48.904
[SPEAKER_06]: Because remember, I have my special family with Betty White as my grandmother.

01:50:50.205 --> 01:50:51.405
[SPEAKER_06]: George Takei is my gay daddy.

01:50:53.946 --> 01:50:55.747
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't decided who my other gay daddy is.

01:50:58.268 --> 01:50:58.648
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:50:59.389 --> 01:51:02.490
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on with more rapid fire news.

01:51:03.230 --> 01:51:04.071
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.

01:51:05.391 --> 01:51:12.156
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we've got a fan project that's called Mega Man Day in the Limelight 2.

01:51:12.256 --> 01:51:13.637
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, it's apparently a sequel.

01:51:14.297 --> 01:51:16.579
[SPEAKER_06]: It's done by the people that did Mushroom Kingdom Fusion.

01:51:16.759 --> 01:51:20.522
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a rearranged version of Mega Man 3, but instead of playing what?

01:51:22.763 --> 01:51:26.486
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiger Claw says, searching for car alarm dubstep, I found this.

01:51:27.327 --> 01:51:27.507
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I...

01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:37.481
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god!

01:51:37.501 --> 01:51:40.743
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god!

01:51:47.447 --> 01:51:51.770
[SPEAKER_06]: You just made me drop my mic.

01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:53.110
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:51:54.411 --> 01:51:59.154
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, you play through the stages of Mega Man 3, but you play as the Robot Masters from Mega Man 2.

01:52:00.395 --> 01:52:03.837
[SPEAKER_06]: So it looks like it's pretty fun, and I think I'm going to be grabbing this.

01:52:05.916 --> 01:52:34.985
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck Rob No thank you, let's not fuck Rob The hell you did to my poor brain It was the chatters, it was Tiger Claw, it's all Tiger Claw's fault Team Fortress 2, we have a new co-op mode on August 15th called Man-na-na-na-na-na-na-na with an extra N, versus Machine So it's six players against doppelgangers, so you have to fight the robot versions of them And you get incredible loot!

01:52:38.032 --> 01:52:39.472
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as cool as VOG loot.

01:52:40.113 --> 01:52:40.293
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

01:52:41.393 --> 01:52:43.693
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, last but never least, Steam.

01:52:44.114 --> 01:52:47.514
[SPEAKER_06]: The big picture mode is going to launch in beta in September.

01:52:47.935 --> 01:52:50.435
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can basically play Steam on your TV.

01:52:51.596 --> 01:52:51.776
[SPEAKER_06]: Aww.

01:52:52.176 --> 01:52:53.956
[SPEAKER_06]: But not a Valve console.

01:52:55.016 --> 01:52:55.216
[SPEAKER_06]: Aww.

01:52:55.977 --> 01:52:56.277
[SPEAKER_06]: The end.

01:52:57.177 --> 01:52:57.537
[SPEAKER_03]: The end.

01:52:57.597 --> 01:53:00.698
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's go to the Fugo question of the week.

01:53:08.195 --> 01:53:10.680
[SPEAKER_03]: Put Facebook and Google Plus together and you get Foogle.

01:53:11.782 --> 01:53:14.607
[SPEAKER_06]: We ask a question every week of our... It's like they'd be their bastard love child.

01:53:17.009 --> 01:53:21.893
[SPEAKER_03]: We go to our fan communities every week to ask a question and share some of the answers with you guys here on the show.

01:53:22.234 --> 01:53:23.755
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of answers tonight.

01:53:23.815 --> 01:53:25.777
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't read them all, but it's a fun question.

01:53:26.457 --> 01:53:27.298
[SPEAKER_03]: Football question of the week.

01:53:27.538 --> 01:53:28.719
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not just saying that because I wrote it.

01:53:29.340 --> 01:53:30.280
[SPEAKER_03]: New Super Mario Bros.

01:53:30.520 --> 01:53:35.224
[SPEAKER_03]: 2 came out today and it features new Mario powers that allow you to turn lots of things into gold coins.

01:53:35.645 --> 01:53:37.787
[SPEAKER_03]: This has us thinking about power-ups.

01:53:38.247 --> 01:53:41.129
[SPEAKER_03]: What is your favorite power-up item from a video game?

01:53:41.730 --> 01:53:44.012
[SPEAKER_03]: Please provide your user... Oh, I don't have to read that part.

01:53:44.332 --> 01:53:47.194
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, what is your favorite power-up item from a video game?

01:53:47.674 --> 01:53:49.115
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start on Google+, shall we?

01:53:49.155 --> 01:53:55.038
[SPEAKER_03]: With Monster B. My favorite power-up is Adrenaline Pills from Unreal Tournament 2003-2004.

01:53:55.078 --> 01:53:57.200
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you read this post with your Count Chocula voice?

01:53:57.220 --> 01:53:57.360
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

01:54:03.383 --> 01:54:07.205
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite power-up is Adrenaline Pills from Unreal Tournament 2003.

01:54:07.465 --> 01:54:09.986
[SPEAKER_03]: Sound more like The Count.

01:54:10.406 --> 01:54:10.886
[SPEAKER_03]: Close enough.

01:54:11.467 --> 01:54:13.508
[SPEAKER_03]: One, one close.

01:54:13.828 --> 01:54:15.709
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all the same.

01:54:15.729 --> 01:54:15.709
2003, 2004.

01:54:19.150 --> 01:54:22.251
[SPEAKER_03]: Flaco Jones says the Spread Gum power-up from Contra.

01:54:22.732 --> 01:54:23.172
[SPEAKER_03]: Good pick.

01:54:24.393 --> 01:54:30.981
[SPEAKER_03]: Redertainment says, as I remember there's an accessory in Borderlands that allows you to make a sniper rifle that sets enemies on fire.

01:54:31.462 --> 01:54:35.727
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing people flare up and run around from a great distance always put a smile on my face.

01:54:37.850 --> 01:54:39.953
[SPEAKER_03]: You and DarkSakura have some things in common, right?

01:54:43.546 --> 01:54:44.687
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move over to Facebook.

01:54:44.707 --> 01:54:46.128
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of answers on Facebook.

01:54:46.168 --> 01:54:48.089
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to be able to read all these, but I'll read some of them.

01:54:48.830 --> 01:54:53.273
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob himself says the red shell in Mario Kart unless it's aimed at me.

01:54:55.234 --> 01:54:55.654
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

01:54:56.915 --> 01:55:03.639
[SPEAKER_03]: Ben R says the mushroom in Mario Kart where you can just jam the item button as much as possible for a certain amount of seconds and keep boosting.

01:55:03.939 --> 01:55:04.660
[SPEAKER_03]: The golden mushroom.

01:55:05.989 --> 01:55:11.653
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt J says, I always loved the grappling hook from Super Metroid and later in Metroid Prime.

01:55:12.114 --> 01:55:15.296
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt like a total badass swinging back and forth on those hooks.

01:55:15.696 --> 01:55:20.660
[SPEAKER_03]: The space jump comes in as a close second though, mostly because of the animation looking cool.

01:55:22.001 --> 01:55:26.344
[SPEAKER_03]: Nick M says, the gravity gun from Half-Life 2 was amazing.

01:55:26.524 --> 01:55:27.185
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

01:55:27.865 --> 01:55:32.028
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Tetsuya says, gotta give it to the purple tracer laser from Raiden 2.

01:55:33.669 --> 01:55:34.330
[SPEAKER_06]: That, yes.

01:55:35.915 --> 01:55:38.916
[SPEAKER_03]: Gamer Girl says, The Red Heart Potions from Legend of Zelda.

01:55:39.877 --> 01:55:42.538
[SPEAKER_03]: Wicked says, The P-Wing from Super Mario Bros.

01:55:42.898 --> 01:55:42.538
3.

01:55:43.278 --> 01:55:45.619
[SPEAKER_03]: As much as I loved Kuriboh's shoe and the Hammer Bros.

01:55:45.659 --> 01:55:51.101
[SPEAKER_03]: suit, I don't think I've ever cleared World 8 without at least three P-Wings in the inventory.

01:55:51.481 --> 01:55:55.363
[SPEAKER_03]: Infinite flight is a necessity, especially during the fast-scrolling airship stage.

01:55:56.183 --> 01:55:58.424
[SPEAKER_03]: Ratchet Tag simply says, Falcon Punch.

01:55:59.622 --> 01:56:04.185
[SPEAKER_03]: Benny L says, adult magazine from the God Hand that replenishes your God Hand meter.

01:56:05.747 --> 01:56:06.227
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

01:56:07.108 --> 01:56:17.515
[SPEAKER_03]: Picaruno says, the hammer in Super Smash Brothers, the combination of silly music, ridiculous damage, and sheer oh fuck factor from anyone unlucky enough to be hit by it makes me giggle every time.

01:56:18.296 --> 01:56:21.679
[SPEAKER_03]: Jim H says, monster potion from Zombies Ate My Neighbors.

01:56:22.039 --> 01:56:26.762
[SPEAKER_03]: You could punch holes in fences and hedges and walls and kill lumberjacks with ease.

01:56:28.664 --> 01:56:35.268
[SPEAKER_03]: Austin W says, in the Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask, I love the final mask in the game that turns you into fierce DD Link.

01:56:35.648 --> 01:56:38.410
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still waiting for this character to make an appearance in the Smash games.

01:56:38.770 --> 01:56:39.711
[SPEAKER_03]: That and Wolf Link.

01:56:40.612 --> 01:56:43.393
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Charger says, Heavy Barrel from Heavy Barrel Arcade.

01:56:43.754 --> 01:56:46.796
[SPEAKER_03]: In the game, you must collect and assemble all the pieces of the Heavy Barrel weapon.

01:56:47.636 --> 01:56:55.822
[SPEAKER_03]: And Haseo Sumirogarwa says, if I were to choose one, it would have to be the chainsaw you get from a torture kill on Bayonetta.

01:56:56.522 --> 01:56:57.402
[SPEAKER_03]: What are some good answers?

01:56:57.982 --> 01:56:59.083
[SPEAKER_03]: How about you guys in the studio?

01:56:59.183 --> 01:57:01.203
[SPEAKER_03]: Favorite power-up in a video game?

01:57:01.323 --> 01:57:01.984
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a few.

01:57:02.344 --> 01:57:02.584
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:57:02.664 --> 01:57:04.144
[SPEAKER_06]: I really do like Kuriboh's shoe.

01:57:04.424 --> 01:57:05.925
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to use it through the whole damn game.

01:57:06.085 --> 01:57:06.345
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

01:57:06.365 --> 01:57:06.925
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Mariko.

01:57:07.665 --> 01:57:08.345
[SPEAKER_06]: My kitty came out.

01:57:09.166 --> 01:57:10.766
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan's kitty, but my adopted kitty.

01:57:11.226 --> 01:57:14.207
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been my recent favorite.

01:57:14.647 --> 01:57:16.288
[SPEAKER_06]: The collector laser rifle.

01:57:17.228 --> 01:57:17.468
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura,

01:57:35.766 --> 01:57:55.797
[SPEAKER_06]: there was um oh and the issue of Fornax um as far as others that I really really like um I like the bells in Parodius that I like the word blaster where I have no idea what it's saying I can only read like some of it but it's like I don't know what you're saying but die

01:57:56.858 --> 01:57:59.899
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the Proteus power-ups a whole bunch.

01:58:04.501 --> 01:58:07.362
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, Cotton, where she gets the willow.

01:58:07.902 --> 01:58:09.603
[SPEAKER_06]: She goes, Weedle!

01:58:09.703 --> 01:58:10.943
[SPEAKER_06]: I just like it because that's all she says.

01:58:12.584 --> 01:58:12.804
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki?

01:58:14.744 --> 01:58:15.625
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there's a few.

01:58:15.945 --> 01:58:18.048
[SPEAKER_11]: I have some actually from games I haven't played.

01:58:18.508 --> 01:58:19.690
[SPEAKER_11]: A couple from Red Faction.

01:58:19.730 --> 01:58:24.255
[SPEAKER_11]: They had Mr. Toots, which was a unicorn that fired rainbows out of its ass.

01:58:24.735 --> 01:58:25.236
[SPEAKER_11]: Amazing.

01:58:25.436 --> 01:58:26.617
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a weapon in the game.

01:58:27.038 --> 01:58:30.662
[SPEAKER_06]: That showed up in videos online too, right?

01:58:30.973 --> 01:58:31.894
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuzzy from Super Mario World 2

01:58:47.606 --> 01:58:49.828
[SPEAKER_03]: That wasn't really a power-up, but that's a good answer.

01:58:49.848 --> 01:58:50.769
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good answer.

01:58:50.809 --> 01:58:51.209
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:52.190
[SPEAKER_03]: It's memorable.

01:58:52.430 --> 01:59:08.244
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, actually, sort of a power-up from... It was actually in a bunch of Capcom games, but one I remember was Captain Commando, where you would hop into the mechs and punch and blow things up and catch things on fire.

01:59:09.065 --> 01:59:14.890
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember how all the old Capcom games had that little symbol that, like, showed up in every game that was always, like, an uber power-up?

01:59:14.930 --> 01:59:15.731
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it was in every game.

01:59:15.791 --> 01:59:16.812
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember what it was called.

01:59:16.832 --> 01:59:17.173
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember?

01:59:17.593 --> 01:59:18.253
[SPEAKER_03]: That little symbol?

01:59:19.194 --> 01:59:27.262
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a little... I do also, though, have to second the purple laser in Raiden because that's always what I use was the purple laser.

01:59:28.142 --> 01:59:28.663
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else, Loki?

01:59:28.683 --> 01:59:28.763
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:59:29.212 --> 01:59:29.572
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

01:59:29.832 --> 01:59:31.433
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there's one more I can add, actually.

01:59:32.133 --> 01:59:43.255
[SPEAKER_06]: Your shield thing in R-Type, the added-on option that you could shoot either from your butt or from the front, that was always a cool thing.

01:59:44.595 --> 01:59:46.376
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go super-duper old school.

01:59:46.716 --> 01:59:49.677
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one of the best power-ups ever was the hammer in Donkey Kong.

01:59:50.077 --> 01:59:50.817
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the little song...

01:59:53.352 --> 01:59:56.194
[SPEAKER_03]: The little animation of the hammer going up and down was really funny to me.

01:59:56.274 --> 01:59:58.675
[SPEAKER_03]: So I always loved the hammer in the original Donkey Kong.

01:59:59.175 --> 02:00:04.438
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the pow brick in Mario Brothers because I love... I'm not talking Super Mario Brothers.

02:00:04.458 --> 02:00:05.578
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking old school Mario Brothers.

02:00:05.638 --> 02:00:06.459
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved that game.

02:00:06.499 --> 02:00:06.939
[SPEAKER_03]: I still do.

02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:09.921
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of my favorite... You knock everyone on their ass.

02:00:09.961 --> 02:00:12.042
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of my... Yeah, you just knock everyone on their ass.

02:00:12.082 --> 02:00:14.923
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is cool that the pow bricks kind of come back in the later Mario games.

02:00:14.943 --> 02:00:15.744
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be awesome.

02:00:16.804 --> 02:00:19.307
[SPEAKER_11]: Smash Brothers of Old Retro Arcade Games Ripple Gun from Life Force

02:00:32.654 --> 02:00:34.315
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that was the best one.

02:00:34.435 --> 02:00:35.636
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that power-up.

02:00:35.696 --> 02:00:39.178
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, sometimes, even though it wasn't that great of a gun, like, I would get it just because it's cool.

02:00:39.198 --> 02:00:40.699
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, I'm Team Laser over here.

02:00:40.919 --> 02:00:41.399
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

02:00:41.659 --> 02:00:44.801
[SPEAKER_03]: Laser was the more effective power-up, but the Ripple was just cool.

02:00:45.301 --> 02:00:51.165
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really think the best power-up, like, ever were the options in the Gradius games and any of those games.

02:00:51.185 --> 02:00:51.305
[SPEAKER_03]: Option.

02:00:51.565 --> 02:00:51.965
[SPEAKER_03]: Option.

02:00:52.306 --> 02:00:52.446
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

02:00:52.466 --> 02:00:53.486
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe those are great power-ups.

02:00:53.526 --> 02:00:55.608
[SPEAKER_06]: Or too much speed-up, though, and you'd be dead.

02:00:55.988 --> 02:00:56.148
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

02:00:56.588 --> 02:01:07.758
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, well, another one, actually, since I mentioned R-Type is the, um, I don't know if it's called the Ripple Gun in R-Type, but it's like a dual red and blue that forms this big, uh, swirl as it goes across.

02:01:07.778 --> 02:01:08.679
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a wave gun or something?

02:01:08.699 --> 02:01:11.021
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, some kind of wave gun, but I just thought that one was pretty.

02:01:11.421 --> 02:01:13.603
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Chiggers in our chatroom says a Suriken?

02:01:13.763 --> 02:01:16.005
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that was the name of it, that thing I'm trying to think of.

02:01:16.926 --> 02:01:17.186
[SPEAKER_08]: Where...

02:01:18.036 --> 02:01:41.083
[SPEAKER_03]: that's that Capcom thing that was in the like it was in 1942 and it was in Bionic Commando and which um um one other one I would name power up that was awesome you know I'm gonna go to Super Metroid right I'm gonna say the very end of the game when you have that laser that just blows through everything like the rainbow laser that just cuts through everything there was just something really epic about that moment when you had that beam as you were fighting Mother Brain

02:01:41.603 --> 02:01:42.164
[SPEAKER_03]: That was awesome.

02:01:42.344 --> 02:01:44.145
[SPEAKER_06]: There is one other thing I know.

02:01:44.645 --> 02:01:48.647
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a game I've actually covered for Classic Game that's Star Parodia.

02:01:49.308 --> 02:01:51.389
[SPEAKER_06]: I love shooting things with hue cards.

02:01:52.290 --> 02:01:52.710
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't help it.

02:01:53.010 --> 02:01:54.291
[SPEAKER_03]: I love this answer in the chat room.

02:01:54.351 --> 02:01:57.673
[SPEAKER_03]: Dungeon Buster says, Michael Jackson turning into a robot in Moonwalker.

02:01:58.033 --> 02:01:59.534
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty awesome, actually.

02:01:59.934 --> 02:02:00.775
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:02:00.975 --> 02:02:02.076
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, DarkTestSuya.

02:02:02.516 --> 02:02:04.037

[SPEAKER_03]: Yasichi.

[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

02:02:08.219 --> 02:02:09.040
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm trying to think of.

02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:09.941
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, DarkTest Studio.

02:02:10.001 --> 02:02:11.142

[SPEAKER_03]: It's made out of wood.

[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy.

02:02:14.685 --> 02:02:14.945
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

02:02:15.866 --> 02:02:18.828
[SPEAKER_03]: Big thanks to all you guys on Facebook and Google Plus to answer the question.

02:02:18.888 --> 02:02:19.529
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so sorry.

02:02:19.549 --> 02:02:22.691
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't read all the Facebook answers because there's like a lot.

02:02:22.732 --> 02:02:23.112
[SPEAKER_03]: There's over 20.

02:02:23.772 --> 02:02:24.993
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, don't also forget though.

02:02:25.254 --> 02:02:26.174
[SPEAKER_03]: So go and read them.

02:02:26.354 --> 02:02:27.676
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm commanding you to go read everybody's answers.

02:02:27.696 --> 02:02:29.117
[SPEAKER_06]: Getting the Hadouken and Mega Man X.

02:02:29.980 --> 02:02:31.541
[SPEAKER_03]: Hadouken, Hadouken, Hadouken

02:02:54.011 --> 02:02:56.212
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyhow, that's it for Fugle Question of the Week.

02:02:56.592 --> 02:02:58.534
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on with some more news.

02:02:58.574 --> 02:03:02.636
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get to the mailbag, FUs, Twitter topics, Skype, all that good stuff in just a little bit.

02:03:02.716 --> 02:03:03.917
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, Loki.

02:03:04.237 --> 02:03:06.838
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, Valve is getting into all sorts of crazy shit.

02:03:07.759 --> 02:03:12.101
[SPEAKER_11]: First, they have their game service, and then now they're putting other software.

02:03:12.622 --> 02:03:15.283
[SPEAKER_11]: Now they're making documentaries.

02:03:16.144 --> 02:03:19.505
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Valve has documentaries that are...

02:03:20.606 --> 02:03:21.807
[SPEAKER_11]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:03:39.904 --> 02:03:45.413
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes sense things are going this way when that whole indie game, the movie, I'm assuming it did fairly well on Steam.

02:03:45.733 --> 02:03:46.995
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw people talking about it.

02:03:48.197 --> 02:03:54.627
[SPEAKER_06]: They did sort of have a documentary in iPad form with Portal 2, The Final Days.

02:03:54.967 --> 02:03:57.850
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, wasn't that like a contracted thing though?

02:03:58.030 --> 02:03:58.290
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

02:03:58.411 --> 02:04:01.714
[SPEAKER_03]: Because like Jeff Keighley put that all together, or at least supervised it.

02:04:01.754 --> 02:04:05.157
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure he didn't do it all himself, but you know, supervised that whole thing.

02:04:05.638 --> 02:04:12.725
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because they did the portal, but wasn't there one that was the last days of... There was another game that had one.

02:04:12.785 --> 02:04:13.705
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it another Valve game?

02:04:15.487 --> 02:04:17.049
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, didn't they do one for Mass Effect 3?

02:04:18.171 --> 02:04:18.611
[SPEAKER_03]: They did.

02:04:18.952 --> 02:04:22.294
[SPEAKER_03]: They did do The Last Days of Mass Effect 3 and The Last Days of Portal.

02:04:22.334 --> 02:04:22.755
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care.

02:04:22.775 --> 02:04:25.677
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to see an animated Team Fortress 2 movie.

02:04:25.777 --> 02:04:27.438
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be fucking amazing.

02:04:27.478 --> 02:04:28.659
[SPEAKER_11]: Fans can make them now.

02:04:28.799 --> 02:04:29.320
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I understand that.

02:04:29.380 --> 02:04:30.481
[SPEAKER_03]: And then market them through Steam.

02:04:31.081 --> 02:04:31.741
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be crazy.

02:04:32.482 --> 02:04:38.186
[SPEAKER_11]: I still want to see a... Let's see a future-length animated movie because their shit's pretty awesome.

02:04:38.206 --> 02:04:39.367
[SPEAKER_03]: You got Wreck-It Ralph coming.

02:04:40.428 --> 02:04:42.390
[SPEAKER_03]: I doubt Team Fortress characters are in it, but...

02:04:43.390 --> 02:04:44.070
[SPEAKER_11]: They should be.

02:04:45.571 --> 02:04:46.031
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

02:04:46.891 --> 02:04:48.311
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, moving on to Nintendo.

02:04:48.411 --> 02:04:54.352
[SPEAKER_03]: I referenced this a little bit earlier in the show, but I wanted to go into depth on this a little bit because I'm sure Loki will have an opinion on this.

02:04:55.052 --> 02:05:01.073
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo is promising that their DLC will not leave users feel cheated or deceived.

02:05:01.474 --> 02:05:08.455
[SPEAKER_03]: This is according to Satoru Iwata, who of course is the president of Nintendo, because you know Nintendo is just now getting into DLC.

02:05:10.356 --> 02:05:13.499
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 2012, and DLC's been prevalent since what, about 06, 07?

02:05:14.320 --> 02:05:21.908
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're just now getting the HD, too, so I mean... Nintendo's finally getting into DLC, and here's what they said.

02:05:22.328 --> 02:05:31.958
[SPEAKER_03]: And one thing Nintendo has determined as a company policy, what we are not going to do is create a full game and then say, let's hold this back for DLC.

02:05:32.799 --> 02:05:33.760
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all a matter of opinion

02:05:51.049 --> 02:05:58.857
[SPEAKER_11]: Capcom, I'm sure, in their defense, would say that Street Fighter X Tekken was a full game and that these additional characters are, you know, just that.

02:05:58.918 --> 02:05:59.598
[SPEAKER_11]: They're additional.

02:05:59.638 --> 02:06:01.721
[SPEAKER_03]: But the rest of the internet called them out on that bullshit.

02:06:01.741 --> 02:06:03.382
[SPEAKER_11]: But, yeah, it's on disc.

02:06:03.663 --> 02:06:04.864
[SPEAKER_11]: It's paid to unlock content.

02:06:04.924 --> 02:06:07.447
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's even, like, there's one story I didn't talk about.

02:06:07.547 --> 02:06:08.708
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Sleeping Dogs.

02:06:08.988 --> 02:06:11.091
[SPEAKER_11]: How they, oh, yeah, we have six months planned of DLC.

02:06:11.151 --> 02:06:12.232
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all paid to unlock stuff.

02:06:12.652 --> 02:06:16.895
[SPEAKER_11]: To be fair, that is a game where you don't really need that stuff.

02:06:16.975 --> 02:06:17.935
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just costumes.

02:06:18.796 --> 02:06:20.096
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think there's any additional missions.

02:06:20.116 --> 02:06:22.398
[SPEAKER_11]: There may be, but it's mostly costumes.

02:06:22.818 --> 02:06:23.919
[SPEAKER_03]: One quick other statement here.

02:06:24.299 --> 02:06:28.901
[SPEAKER_03]: Our goal is to create DLC in such a way that consumers do not feel they have been cheated or deceived.

02:06:29.462 --> 02:06:33.524
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe there are people out there, readers, who are worried about that.

02:06:33.544 --> 02:06:34.945
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a weird translation there.

02:06:35.365 --> 02:06:40.548
[SPEAKER_03]: We just want to ensure them that we have in mind and want them to know that that's not what we are planning on doing.

02:06:42.153 --> 02:06:42.813
[SPEAKER_03]: So Nintendo?

02:06:42.953 --> 02:06:44.774
[SPEAKER_11]: Planning and doing are two different things.

02:06:46.555 --> 02:07:00.860
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not planning on doing it, but... Well, you know, it's not just Iwata that said this because I remember distinctly in that 3DS little press conference thing, not the one from E3, but the one that came out a little later where they spotlighted the games again.

02:07:00.880 --> 02:07:03.961
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like one of those Nintendo Direct things that had Reggie and some of those guys.

02:07:04.361 --> 02:07:05.142
[SPEAKER_03]: for Nintendo in it.

02:07:06.223 --> 02:07:10.626
[SPEAKER_03]: He specifically said, we're going to have DLC for New Super Mario Bros.

02:07:10.907 --> 02:07:14.610
[SPEAKER_03]: 2, but I want to assure everybody it's additional content.

02:07:14.890 --> 02:07:16.492
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a finished game first.

02:07:16.512 --> 02:07:22.977
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they really went out of their way to stress it's not something that you're going to have to have.

02:07:23.037 --> 02:07:25.780
[SPEAKER_03]: It is truly something extra the designers are working on.

02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:27.141
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

02:07:29.303 --> 02:07:30.704
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think, Nintendo DLC?

02:07:31.704 --> 02:07:34.527
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really know what the thing is yet because we haven't seen any examples yet.

02:07:36.129 --> 02:07:36.990
[SPEAKER_03]: New Super Mario Bros.

02:07:37.010 --> 02:07:39.833
[SPEAKER_03]: 2 is going to be the first example of first-party DLC anyway.

02:07:41.034 --> 02:07:50.145
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't know if it's going to... I mean, I would be... I was always hoping that, like, you know, Excite Truck, you know, hey, all we need is DLC with new levels.

02:07:50.465 --> 02:07:50.865
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

02:07:50.945 --> 02:07:53.148
[SPEAKER_11]: Just add new levels and I'll be happy.

02:07:54.718 --> 02:07:55.258
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

02:08:16.252 --> 02:08:21.358
[SPEAKER_11]: This old Mario Kart level is in 3D now, or it's in the polygons and stuff.

02:08:21.979 --> 02:08:23.281
[SPEAKER_11]: Now it's getting a little old.

02:08:24.142 --> 02:08:25.383
[SPEAKER_11]: It's getting a little tiresome.

02:08:26.725 --> 02:08:29.288
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe do a Mario Kart game that didn't have the old tracks in it.

02:08:30.816 --> 02:08:31.276
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:08:50.350 --> 02:08:57.277
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo were to put out five new tracks, like a new circuit of five new tracks, what would that be worth to you as DLC?

02:08:57.498 --> 02:08:58.218
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you pay for that?

02:08:58.278 --> 02:08:58.999
[SPEAKER_11]: It depends on what circuit.

02:08:59.039 --> 02:09:00.120
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if it's old re-release stuff.

02:09:00.140 --> 02:09:00.681
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say all new.

02:09:00.861 --> 02:09:01.502
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say it's all new.

02:09:03.164 --> 02:09:04.105
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd say like five bucks.

02:09:04.405 --> 02:09:04.685
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

02:09:05.026 --> 02:09:05.186
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

02:09:05.466 --> 02:09:06.487
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't want to see it more than $2.99.

02:09:06.527 --> 02:09:07.408
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm just a cheapskate.

02:09:07.428 --> 02:09:10.471
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if you have really good tracks, it would all depend.

02:09:10.531 --> 02:09:11.032
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you know.

02:09:11.885 --> 02:09:16.367
[SPEAKER_03]: or Mario 2 Coin Rush levels, three stages, back to back.

02:09:16.387 --> 02:09:17.548
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't buy any of that.

02:09:17.608 --> 02:09:18.168
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

02:09:18.228 --> 02:09:19.549
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really about the price.

02:09:19.949 --> 02:09:21.569
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Nintendo going to get the price right?

02:09:22.150 --> 02:09:22.590
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

02:09:24.471 --> 02:09:24.851
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

02:09:27.308 --> 02:09:54.035
[SPEAKER_11]: uh chiggers in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says mario kart level editor and share please but then they wouldn't be able to charge you for dlc if they do that they have a mario kart level editor now on the wii and there is some not official though is it no but there's some way you can do it with sd cards where you can load custom tracks on there same with um the 3ds or not the 3ds the uh uh was it new super mario rose on the wii same thing with that you can do custom levels in that somehow

02:09:54.443 --> 02:10:01.147
[SPEAKER_03]: I should say this, though, because some people say, well, if Mario Kart added that in, then they wouldn't be able to sell DLC.

02:10:01.467 --> 02:10:02.387
[SPEAKER_03]: Not necessarily the case.

02:10:02.428 --> 02:10:03.648
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at something like LittleBigPlanet.

02:10:03.668 --> 02:10:04.749
[SPEAKER_03]: It does this very well.

02:10:04.789 --> 02:10:06.050
[SPEAKER_03]: LittleBigPlanet does great DLC.

02:10:06.070 --> 02:10:06.930
[SPEAKER_11]: That reminds me.

02:10:07.030 --> 02:10:10.272
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a ROM hack for New Super Mario Bros.

02:10:10.512 --> 02:10:12.433
[SPEAKER_11]: on the DS that was New Super Mario Bros.

02:10:12.793 --> 02:10:15.235
[SPEAKER_11]: 3, and it had a lot of really cool levels and stuff in it.

02:10:15.875 --> 02:10:18.356
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be kind of cool to compare that to New Super Mario Bros.

02:10:18.376 --> 02:10:18.537
[SPEAKER_11]: 2 now.

02:10:19.737 --> 02:10:26.778
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see how better one is than the other.

02:10:26.999 --> 02:10:30.099
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I think that one had some really unique ideas that they did with it.

02:10:31.599 --> 02:10:33.720
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if we're going to see that in the level design.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:38.941
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if a lot of those people are thinking that far outside the box like some of the ROM hackers do.

02:10:39.641 --> 02:10:40.501
[SPEAKER_03]: We shall see.

02:10:41.321 --> 02:10:42.402
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on for now.

02:10:42.442 --> 02:10:44.442
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura with some more news.

02:10:45.310 --> 02:10:48.931
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we do have something else from Valve.

02:10:50.351 --> 02:10:53.571
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm sure you're familiar with the Perpetual Testing Initiative.

02:10:54.051 --> 02:10:56.372
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the in-game Portal 2 editor.

02:10:56.612 --> 02:10:57.552
[SPEAKER_06]: I played a few other things.

02:10:57.592 --> 02:11:07.694
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone's actually even gone and tried to recreate the entire first portal using nothing but, at least the puzzles and everything, using nothing but the in-game editor.

02:11:08.134 --> 02:11:13.315
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, now they have a patch that's going to be an update for that to let you do co-op...

02:11:14.955 --> 02:11:24.123
[SPEAKER_06]: Co-op Test Chambers and you also have another option that's a quick play feature so that you can see the top rated user maps for each category.

02:11:25.444 --> 02:11:33.991
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like I said free and it's also going to come with a 75% off Portal 2 voucher so that you can share the game with a friend.

02:11:35.412 --> 02:11:36.013
[SPEAKER_06]: Not bad, huh?

02:11:37.274 --> 02:11:37.995
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's not bad at all.

02:11:38.095 --> 02:11:38.815
[SPEAKER_06]: I love you Steam.

02:11:38.875 --> 02:11:39.416
[SPEAKER_06]: I love you!

02:11:41.511 --> 02:11:45.614
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can get a friend Portal 2, whether they want it or not.

02:11:46.274 --> 02:11:46.735
[SPEAKER_03]: They want it.

02:11:47.615 --> 02:11:47.996
[SPEAKER_11]: They want it.

02:11:48.076 --> 02:11:49.076
[SPEAKER_03]: Who wouldn't want Portal 2?

02:11:49.136 --> 02:11:49.577
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

02:11:49.777 --> 02:11:51.278
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think everybody should have it by now.

02:11:52.138 --> 02:11:53.459
[SPEAKER_03]: With all them Steam sales and stuff.

02:11:53.479 --> 02:11:54.000
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, right?

02:11:56.075 --> 02:11:57.176
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is kind of shocking.

02:11:57.476 --> 02:12:04.599
[SPEAKER_11]: During Gamescom, apparently, some early builds of the game Divinity were stolen out of the booth.

02:12:04.919 --> 02:12:11.942
[SPEAKER_11]: They literally picked up PCs and ran out of the building and somehow didn't get caught.

02:12:13.837 --> 02:12:15.178
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a sick trend.

02:12:15.518 --> 02:12:16.559
[SPEAKER_03]: How does that even happen?

02:12:16.819 --> 02:12:18.700
[SPEAKER_03]: We've heard about this happening at PAX and everything.

02:12:19.020 --> 02:12:20.661
[SPEAKER_03]: It's chaos.

02:12:20.921 --> 02:12:30.406
[SPEAKER_11]: I could see if it was, for whatever reason, on a disc or something, popping the disc out, pointing it in your pocket, and running out of the... Well, something like that happened at the last PAX, didn't it?

02:12:30.446 --> 02:12:31.407
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't we report on that?

02:12:31.487 --> 02:12:36.009
[SPEAKER_03]: Or somebody had copied it to a USB drive or something and ran out with it?

02:12:36.089 --> 02:12:39.451
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was... I forget what game it was, but yeah, I do remember that.

02:12:41.511 --> 02:13:08.680
[SPEAKER_11]: but anyways so apparently the two games Divinity Dragon Commander and Divinity Original Sin have been stolen from Larian Studios and they've actually posted a reward of $5,000 for anybody that can you know point fingers at who took them it was Breach was the game that was stolen at PAX oh I'm sorry yeah

02:13:11.314 --> 02:13:11.974
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just weird.

02:13:12.274 --> 02:13:12.935
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm surprised.

02:13:14.675 --> 02:13:19.116
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently, they were using backup PCs, so there's no issues with actual code being sold.

02:13:19.316 --> 02:13:21.017
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it only makes sense you can back up that stuff.

02:13:21.037 --> 02:13:23.798
[SPEAKER_11]: This is our only copy of the code that we have here.

02:13:23.818 --> 02:13:25.338
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I wouldn't be too surprised.

02:13:25.398 --> 02:13:25.998
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, shit.

02:13:26.058 --> 02:13:29.979
[SPEAKER_03]: But still, it's still shitty that they have to plan that.

02:13:30.180 --> 02:13:33.701
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, backing up code machines, but it's shitty if somebody stole it in the first place.

02:13:34.061 --> 02:13:34.701
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, come on.

02:13:34.761 --> 02:13:36.081
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got to be on security cameras.

02:13:36.101 --> 02:13:38.082
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to notice someone, you know,

02:13:39.434 --> 02:13:42.975
[SPEAKER_11]: GameGuru in our chatroom with the inappropriate joke Guest appearance by Carmen Sandiego

02:14:08.161 --> 02:14:08.482
[SPEAKER_03]: Where?

02:14:08.642 --> 02:14:08.922
[SPEAKER_06]: When?

02:14:09.202 --> 02:14:09.843
[SPEAKER_03]: Womp womp.

02:14:11.945 --> 02:14:13.326
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's move on.

02:14:13.426 --> 02:14:15.108
[SPEAKER_03]: One more story before the mailbag for you guys.

02:14:15.128 --> 02:14:16.349
[SPEAKER_03]: This is also out of Gamescom.

02:14:16.729 --> 02:14:19.111
[SPEAKER_03]: Something a little better than stolen things.

02:14:20.032 --> 02:14:23.695
[SPEAKER_03]: A little seminar about how to pitch your indie game to Sony.

02:14:23.735 --> 02:14:27.879
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, excuse me, this is not out of Gamescom, but close.

02:14:27.939 --> 02:14:29.441
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another Europe convention.

02:14:30.041 --> 02:14:31.682
[SPEAKER_03]: I sound like such an ignorant American right now.

02:14:31.722 --> 02:14:32.282
[SPEAKER_03]: My apologies.

02:14:32.702 --> 02:14:34.262
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Game Developers Conference Europe.

02:14:34.322 --> 02:14:36.263
[SPEAKER_03]: GDC Europe also happened last week.

02:14:36.383 --> 02:14:37.183
[SPEAKER_03]: You may or may not have heard.

02:14:37.583 --> 02:14:50.447
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, there was a seminar by Pete Smith who is the Sony CrossDev Director of Product Development talking about basically what you should and you shouldn't do when you pitch your indie game.

02:14:51.307 --> 02:14:55.068
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, quote, I'm sick of sitting through crap development pitches.

02:14:55.928 --> 02:14:56.188
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

02:14:56.909 --> 02:14:58.329
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, let's play a game.

02:15:00.082 --> 02:15:03.664
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if you can guess what would be some of the do's and some of the don'ts.

02:15:04.044 --> 02:15:08.085
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to pitch your indie game, what are some of the do's and some of the don'ts?

02:15:08.125 --> 02:15:08.886
[SPEAKER_03]: What would be your guess?

02:15:10.847 --> 02:15:13.248
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, if you haven't spoiled this for yourself already, you can play too.

02:15:13.928 --> 02:15:14.508
[SPEAKER_03]: But no cheating.

02:15:15.248 --> 02:15:17.889
[SPEAKER_06]: What to do when you're pitching it and what not to do?

02:15:17.969 --> 02:15:21.811
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what would you do to pitch it and what makes a good pitch and what doesn't make a good pitch?

02:15:22.557 --> 02:15:45.889
[SPEAKER_06]: well with a good pitch you want to definitely have some presentation materials like concept art something that's going to be solid you want to have something well written out spelled correctly ding ding ding we have have assets these include a one page overview screenshots or video all on a USB stick for the publisher to keep don't waste time or money on swag good

02:15:46.317 --> 02:15:46.637
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

02:15:47.678 --> 02:15:58.163
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's nice to have something kind of neat to throw in it, but no one's going to invest any money if they don't have at least an appetizer instead of the meat and potatoes.

02:15:58.443 --> 02:16:01.424
[SPEAKER_06]: They need to see what the vision is.

02:16:01.444 --> 02:16:02.745
[SPEAKER_06]: They need to have a projection.

02:16:02.765 --> 02:16:12.189
[SPEAKER_06]: They need to have a financial comparison to see if there's other games of a similar genre, what they're making money with, and how this is going to compare to them.

02:16:12.389 --> 02:16:13.710
[SPEAKER_06]: Financial presentation.

02:16:14.310 --> 02:16:16.334
[SPEAKER_06]: What not to do is just say, oh, I've got an idea for a game.

02:16:16.374 --> 02:16:16.955
[SPEAKER_06]: Will you give me money?

02:16:19.599 --> 02:16:21.321
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to harass them with phone calls.

02:16:21.902 --> 02:16:23.425
[SPEAKER_06]: You send the first email.

02:16:23.465 --> 02:16:25.188
[SPEAKER_06]: You send them the test product.

02:16:25.228 --> 02:16:26.109
[SPEAKER_06]: You send a follow-up.

02:16:26.730 --> 02:16:27.732
[SPEAKER_06]: You wait for a response.

02:16:29.265 --> 02:16:33.189
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not really on the list per se, but I still think that's good advice.

02:16:33.289 --> 02:16:34.870
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's necessarily wrong.

02:16:35.971 --> 02:16:36.972
[SPEAKER_03]: Similar answers are there.

02:16:37.012 --> 02:16:37.753
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, did you cheat?

02:16:38.293 --> 02:16:38.693
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't cheat.

02:16:38.793 --> 02:16:40.395
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, what would you guess?

02:16:40.495 --> 02:16:46.660
[SPEAKER_11]: Good pitch features tits and ass.

02:16:46.780 --> 02:16:47.301
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

02:16:47.421 --> 02:16:51.424
[SPEAKER_03]: I will give that credit because on the do not list is be boring.

02:16:51.905 --> 02:16:54.527
[SPEAKER_03]: So certainly that is the opposite of boring.

02:16:55.248 --> 02:16:56.709
[SPEAKER_03]: Be boring is on the do not list.

02:16:58.014 --> 02:17:04.260
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I don't think that they want, it's, try to stay away from, like, graphs and charts, maybe?

02:17:04.420 --> 02:17:12.128
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, maybe more, just quick summaries of, like, here's my story, you know, here's, you know, the concept, that type of thing?

02:17:12.268 --> 02:17:14.311
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, the opposite is true.

02:17:14.451 --> 02:17:18.475
[SPEAKER_03]: So, DingDing, on the do list, keep your visuals simple and bold, basically.

02:17:18.855 --> 02:17:19.015
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

02:17:19.716 --> 02:17:47.894
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah so anyhow on the do list know what your game is be able to pitch it in 30 seconds yeah keep your visuals simple and bold you don't have to you want to you want to show off gameplay not graphics exactly you want to be succinct research fuck yes don't ask them what Evita is really if you're gonna pitch to Sony don't ask them what Evita is really really I have something for your Vita system

02:17:49.924 --> 02:17:52.205
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a vital game for the vita.

02:17:52.766 --> 02:17:56.748
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, there's something else that occurred to me, and I didn't look at your screen.

02:17:56.768 --> 02:17:58.089
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't seen anything.

02:17:58.129 --> 02:17:58.489
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, sure.

02:17:58.909 --> 02:18:08.114
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to make sure that the person making the pitch knows how to speak in front of people, enunciate, and has a presence.

02:18:08.335 --> 02:18:11.777
[SPEAKER_03]: Practice your pitch and choose the right person for the pitch.

02:18:11.797 --> 02:18:12.377
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that on there for real?

02:18:12.597 --> 02:18:13.857
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, are both there for real.

02:18:14.498 --> 02:18:16.738
[SPEAKER_03]: Practice your pitch and choose the right person for the pitch.

02:18:17.099 --> 02:18:19.719
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone who can talk about the game to a room of suits with ease.

02:18:20.260 --> 02:18:20.660
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

02:18:21.640 --> 02:18:23.601
[SPEAKER_06]: The average person does not know corporate speak.

02:18:23.661 --> 02:18:23.921
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

02:18:24.401 --> 02:18:24.701
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

02:18:24.801 --> 02:18:30.463
[SPEAKER_03]: Also on the list here, be able to adapt because some games often don't end up what they're pitched.

02:18:31.443 --> 02:18:33.164
[SPEAKER_03]: Manage your expectations.

02:18:33.524 --> 02:18:36.485
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony isn't going to back a game unless it benefits them as well as you.

02:18:37.005 --> 02:18:38.706
[SPEAKER_03]: So be prepared to negotiate that IP.

02:18:39.506 --> 02:19:08.523
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a very realistic answer there let's see I think we hit on some of these others sell yourself as a company and as individuals I think that's very interesting because they say that you have to be able to work with the people not just the idea very interesting they say Media Molecule was a great example of this Sony wanted to work with the people so they followed through Media Molecule probably brought us one of the greatest Sony games ever period little big planet show passion if you don't care why will they

02:19:10.202 --> 02:19:13.503
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I'm Ben Stein and here's my game.

02:19:13.743 --> 02:19:15.584
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, lastly on the do not list and then we'll move on.

02:19:15.904 --> 02:19:16.665
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be boring.

02:19:17.545 --> 02:19:20.886
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't bitch and whine about other developers or publishers.

02:19:21.307 --> 02:19:22.367
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's great advice.

02:19:22.447 --> 02:19:25.488
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't burn your bridges and they just say it's a small industry.

02:19:26.129 --> 02:19:26.709
[SPEAKER_03]: Very true.

02:19:27.869 --> 02:19:31.131
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't spend the entire time on your pitch because you want room for Q&A.

02:19:31.571 --> 02:19:32.771
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't bullshit.

02:19:37.434 --> 02:19:41.615
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's already a million bullshit terms, though, that people have used to fool the public.

02:19:42.275 --> 02:19:44.236
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, remember blast processing?

02:19:44.836 --> 02:19:45.896
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's true, yeah.

02:19:45.956 --> 02:19:46.957
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what all that was?

02:19:47.457 --> 02:19:50.537
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the only thing that Genesis did better than the Super Nintendo.

02:19:50.737 --> 02:19:51.358
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

02:19:51.978 --> 02:19:56.299
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, or, like, look at these graphics, blah, blah, blah.

02:19:56.379 --> 02:19:56.939
[SPEAKER_06]: No substance.

02:19:57.799 --> 02:19:59.820
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's bullshitting right there.

02:19:59.840 --> 02:20:01.880
[SPEAKER_06]: You just show them pretty... Like, what was Heavenly Sword?

02:20:03.701 --> 02:20:04.541
[SPEAKER_06]: Jane, Enemy, Crabs.

02:20:05.382 --> 02:20:07.763
[SPEAKER_11]: Knowit also has blast processing.

02:20:08.783 --> 02:20:09.364
[SPEAKER_11]: Chipotle.

02:20:12.665 --> 02:20:12.965
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:20:14.106 --> 02:20:15.946
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the big ones from the do not list.

02:20:16.386 --> 02:20:18.367
[SPEAKER_03]: These are actually on the list.

02:20:18.467 --> 02:20:20.468
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jamie, you're just going to go like, really?

02:20:20.728 --> 02:20:21.869
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to tell people this?

02:20:21.989 --> 02:20:22.269
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

02:20:23.249 --> 02:20:28.691
[SPEAKER_03]: First, do not tell the publisher how to do their job.

02:20:29.452 --> 02:20:31.413
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't tell Sony why they're a bad publisher.

02:20:33.373 --> 02:20:34.874
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be late.

02:20:37.971 --> 02:20:39.491
[SPEAKER_03]: and don't you ready for the last one?

02:20:39.511 --> 02:20:42.933
[SPEAKER_06]: shut up Tiger Claw, mode 7 was awesome you ready for the last one?

02:20:43.633 --> 02:20:46.614
[SPEAKER_03]: don't be hungover really?

02:20:49.035 --> 02:20:50.156
[SPEAKER_03]: don't be hungover really?

02:20:50.396 --> 02:21:00.280
[SPEAKER_03]: because a lot of pitches are done at these types of E3, GDC, big events right after big parties don't come drunk the next day really?

02:21:01.921 --> 02:21:02.261
[SPEAKER_03]: really?

02:21:03.422 --> 02:21:03.962
[SPEAKER_03]: food for thought

02:21:05.168 --> 02:21:13.098
[SPEAKER_03]: They suggest that you have the rest of your life to drink so that if you have a presentation the next day, maybe you just shouldn't party the night before.

02:21:13.219 --> 02:21:15.742
[SPEAKER_06]: And not everyone has my mutant power to never have a hangover.

02:21:16.903 --> 02:21:20.388
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

02:21:20.448 --> 02:21:23.011
[SPEAKER_03]: Dungeon Buster says, wow, those had to be on a list.

02:21:25.225 --> 02:21:29.107
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerClaw says, by the way, someone should pitch the OLR the game.

02:21:29.507 --> 02:21:30.707
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already happening, remember?

02:21:30.747 --> 02:21:35.689
[SPEAKER_03]: We got an indie game coming to the marketplace, the Bungie Ferret Tossing, which I'm told is very soon.

02:21:36.009 --> 02:21:36.549
[SPEAKER_03]: It's happening soon.

02:21:36.589 --> 02:21:38.630
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally want to do a bumper.

02:21:39.971 --> 02:21:41.131
[SPEAKER_06]: Play our game, damn it.

02:21:42.512 --> 02:21:44.192
[SPEAKER_03]: Giovedeo wins with this comment.

02:21:44.972 --> 02:21:46.333
[SPEAKER_03]: And don't fuck it up.

02:21:48.157 --> 02:21:48.377
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

02:21:48.897 --> 02:21:51.498
[SPEAKER_03]: RuPaul's Drag Race references will always win.

02:21:52.879 --> 02:21:54.620
[SPEAKER_03]: I will purchase Dio Videa's product.

02:21:55.740 --> 02:21:56.380
[SPEAKER_03]: You win, ma'am.

02:21:57.020 --> 02:21:57.361
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:21:57.841 --> 02:21:59.381
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get to the mailbag.

02:21:59.461 --> 02:22:06.084
[SPEAKER_03]: Every week we collect your mails is at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:22:06.744 --> 02:22:07.585
[SPEAKER_03]: There's my mailbag music.

02:22:09.844 --> 02:22:17.609
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura is going to put on her protective garb and dive into the mailbag headfirst and pull out some emails to reads for use.

02:22:18.509 --> 02:22:19.090
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.

02:22:21.311 --> 02:22:22.892
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think your whistling is getting picked up by the mic.

02:22:22.912 --> 02:22:24.673
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not, but I felt like whistling anyway.

02:22:25.353 --> 02:22:26.394
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, OLR.

02:22:27.074 --> 02:22:27.375
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

02:22:27.495 --> 02:22:29.656
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, enthusiastic emailer.

02:22:30.497 --> 02:22:32.378
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm currently listening to episode 469 now live.

02:22:32.418 --> 02:22:32.698
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

02:22:32.758 --> 02:22:32.958
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

02:22:37.287 --> 02:22:42.170
[SPEAKER_06]: You wrote I and, but I think you meant and I. Heard Rob request emails for codes.

02:22:42.570 --> 02:22:46.473
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so jealous of other live listeners because I cannot F and type fast enough.

02:22:46.793 --> 02:22:48.514
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, did you not screen the emails?

02:22:48.534 --> 02:22:52.276
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're going to have those emails that are like, give me loot because we have loot to give away.

02:22:52.296 --> 02:22:52.957
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm going to read it.

02:22:53.137 --> 02:22:53.837
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that's fine.

02:22:54.297 --> 02:22:58.740
[SPEAKER_06]: If I get the code, I will find some way to get Loki to don the Tingle costume come hell or high water.

02:23:00.621 --> 02:23:01.381
[SPEAKER_06]: That's from Spazinator.

02:23:01.721 --> 02:23:04.362
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if I understand how that's going to happen.

02:23:05.342 --> 02:23:06.722
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't believe that that was ever part of the plan.

02:23:06.742 --> 02:23:07.962
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be like Loki Saw.

02:23:08.122 --> 02:23:09.283
[SPEAKER_03]: Drugs or violence.

02:23:09.403 --> 02:23:11.783
[SPEAKER_03]: Saw off your leg or wear a tingle.

02:23:11.803 --> 02:23:12.723
[SPEAKER_03]: Live or die.

02:23:13.963 --> 02:23:15.624
[SPEAKER_03]: Live or die or tingle.

02:23:15.684 --> 02:23:16.304
[SPEAKER_03]: Make your choice.

02:23:18.224 --> 02:23:19.684
[SPEAKER_11]: I miss the Saw movies.

02:23:19.984 --> 02:23:20.484
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't.

02:23:20.805 --> 02:23:21.385
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, come on.

02:23:21.405 --> 02:23:22.845
[SPEAKER_11]: What do we have now?

02:23:23.005 --> 02:23:25.185
[SPEAKER_11]: Yearly paranormal activity movies?

02:23:26.285 --> 02:23:27.646
[SPEAKER_11]: Silent Hill Revelations.

02:23:27.886 --> 02:23:28.466
[SPEAKER_06]: I know!

02:23:29.906 --> 02:23:30.487
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

02:23:50.560 --> 02:23:51.300
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi!

02:23:51.381 --> 02:23:51.621
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

02:23:52.021 --> 02:23:53.422
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, OLR peoples, this is Honey Badger.

02:23:53.482 --> 02:23:56.223
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew Honey Badger was going to email because Honey Badger told me he was going to email.

02:23:56.864 --> 02:23:57.284
[SPEAKER_06]: A.K.A.

02:23:57.324 --> 02:23:58.265
[SPEAKER_06]: Blade 3, A.K.A.

02:23:58.325 --> 02:23:59.125
[SPEAKER_06]: Sam, call me whatever.

02:24:00.066 --> 02:24:03.187
[SPEAKER_06]: Either way, I just wanted to tell a little story about a funny experience with EA.

02:24:04.608 --> 02:24:07.930
[SPEAKER_06]: EA has been distinguished as being the world's shittiest company.

02:24:08.431 --> 02:24:10.852
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought two copies of the same game via Origin.

02:24:11.232 --> 02:24:17.376
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, a friend and I were looking for a way to play Mercenaries 2 together because it was a cheap sale for it.

02:24:18.196 --> 02:24:20.738
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought it with my Origin account for me and then for him.

02:24:21.259 --> 02:24:25.862
[SPEAKER_06]: But wait, Origin does not have the feature to let you gift a copy of a game.

02:24:26.262 --> 02:24:28.964
[SPEAKER_06]: So I told my friend I would log in as him and buy it for him, and I did.

02:24:29.485 --> 02:24:38.311
[SPEAKER_06]: My next move was contact EA to refund one of the games, and after all, I never accessed the downloaded game in any way, so why would there be a problem there?

02:24:38.851 --> 02:24:39.992
[SPEAKER_06]: So I pulled up EA Live Chat.

02:24:40.012 --> 02:24:44.776
[SPEAKER_06]: The rep I spoke to knew about one sentence of English, so that was great.

02:25:15.299 --> 02:25:18.941
[SPEAKER_03]: There's really truly only one thing I can say about all of that.

02:25:23.023 --> 02:25:23.783
[SPEAKER_08]: There's more.

02:25:23.923 --> 02:25:28.065
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say there's hostile employees at every workplace.

02:25:28.545 --> 02:25:29.126
[SPEAKER_11]: That's true.

02:25:29.246 --> 02:25:30.406
[SPEAKER_11]: This company sucks.

02:25:30.606 --> 02:25:31.347
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate working here.

02:25:32.687 --> 02:25:33.608
[SPEAKER_06]: They're always the best.

02:25:34.841 --> 02:25:36.963
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they'll give you the most stuff because they hate their job.

02:25:37.883 --> 02:25:38.844
[SPEAKER_06]: A winner is you.

02:25:58.988 --> 02:26:09.593
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura has me wondering if the next Playstation and Xbox will have the same controllers as the current systems or will they be redesigned?

02:26:09.613 --> 02:26:11.274
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you all think?

02:26:23.268 --> 02:26:24.349
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:26:44.079 --> 02:26:44.840
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

02:27:01.531 --> 02:27:03.973
[SPEAKER_03]: Rumble was so last gen.

02:27:04.133 --> 02:27:04.953
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody need Rumble?

02:27:05.353 --> 02:27:05.694
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody?

02:27:06.094 --> 02:27:07.975
[SPEAKER_03]: Rumble was so last gen.

02:27:08.315 --> 02:27:10.317
[SPEAKER_03]: Ridge Racer is going to use six axis.

02:27:10.757 --> 02:27:11.637
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's the deal.

02:27:11.817 --> 02:27:12.978
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is a pile of crap.

02:27:13.058 --> 02:27:16.740
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 4, probably not going to buck the trend too much.

02:27:16.901 --> 02:27:20.383
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I would think maybe one thing they're going to try to do.

02:27:21.343 --> 02:27:22.264
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why.

02:27:22.284 --> 02:27:24.705
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just putting my little tinfoil hat.

02:27:25.066 --> 02:27:28.748
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it'll kind of look like a PS3 controller, but they're going to try to push that rear touch thing.

02:27:29.128 --> 02:27:29.989
[SPEAKER_03]: on those controllers.

02:27:30.029 --> 02:27:33.091
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to be a little ridiculous, but that's just what I think might happen.

02:27:33.111 --> 02:27:35.312
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see that, but I think the basic design isn't going to change.

02:27:36.133 --> 02:27:38.094
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox will change somewhat, I think.

02:27:38.274 --> 02:27:41.836
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the controller design changed within that first Xbox.

02:27:41.936 --> 02:27:43.277
[SPEAKER_11]: The D-pad.

02:27:43.717 --> 02:27:46.099
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember the first Xbox was gigantic?

02:27:46.439 --> 02:27:48.781
[SPEAKER_03]: Those gigantic Xbox controllers, and they scaled them down.

02:27:49.301 --> 02:27:52.543
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the Xbox 360 controller was relatively similar enough.

02:27:52.883 --> 02:27:58.267
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, looking at other systems, I think Nintendo's going to have a different controller every fucking time.

02:27:58.607 --> 02:28:01.748
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, that's the one that is radically different every time.

02:28:01.768 --> 02:28:10.392
[SPEAKER_06]: The only ones that never looked really much different was the... Well, even when they brought out the top-loading NES, they had this NES-style controller, kind of.

02:28:11.013 --> 02:28:13.874
[SPEAKER_06]: But there was still a basic paddle and button layout, you know.

02:28:14.574 --> 02:28:34.791
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the ones that, as far as logical redesigns have gone, is if you take the Sega systems, gone from the Master System, gone to the Genesis, gone to the six-button Genesis controller, to the Saturn that had a similar controller to the Genesis, to the dual analog controller, which I will stand on this to this day, best controller ever.

02:28:36.313 --> 02:28:37.475
[SPEAKER_06]: Dreamcast, Dual Analog Controller

02:28:51.632 --> 02:29:12.202
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but I mean, I think that using those examples, I think that the companies, the powers that be, except for Nintendo, have learned their lesson from making too many variables in, you know, when it comes to controller progression, and are sticking with the tried and true shape.

02:29:13.631 --> 02:29:21.199
[SPEAKER_06]: I may not be the biggest Sony fan, but I have to say that the controller has always had an ergonomically comfortable shape.

02:29:21.820 --> 02:29:26.324
[SPEAKER_06]: I do find it easier to hold it than I do an Xbox controller.

02:29:26.745 --> 02:29:31.389
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though I tend to like games better on Xbox, the PlayStation controller is easier to hold.

02:29:31.409 --> 02:29:32.130
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they'll stick with it.

02:29:33.190 --> 02:30:00.689
[SPEAKER_03]: one thing to keep in mind too before you move on to the next email is that keep in mind the next Xbox is going to be very heavy on this whole whatever the new Kinect is whatever this advanced Kinect is Microsoft wants Kinect to happen I mean I guess Kinect already has happened but they want it to be more than a fad they're going to shove this thing down your throat in the next Xbox so even though yes there will be a tangible controller there has to be for the Halo games expect that Microsoft will make a big deal out of the whole

02:30:01.269 --> 02:30:02.211
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

02:30:16.762 --> 02:30:27.107
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that you're dealing with two... The bulk of gamers, at least, that have the money to afford any of this are going to be in our age group.

02:30:27.728 --> 02:30:32.370
[SPEAKER_06]: People who have grown up with a controller in their hand and they've tried this before with, like, remember the U-Force?

02:30:32.650 --> 02:30:33.390
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that was crap.

02:30:34.311 --> 02:30:35.932
[SPEAKER_06]: Or the Activator.

02:30:36.812 --> 02:30:38.733
[SPEAKER_06]: They've tried hands-free controllers before.

02:30:39.474 --> 02:30:41.555
[SPEAKER_06]: And true, the technology wasn't what it is today.

02:30:41.595 --> 02:30:50.260
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, definitely Kinect is, I'd have to say it, but the best of it, but at the very least with Nintendo and with the Move, you've still got something tangible that you can hold.

02:30:50.320 --> 02:30:52.221
[SPEAKER_06]: People like that tactile experience.

02:30:53.302 --> 02:30:58.885
[SPEAKER_06]: And do you remember that thing that they were making for, so you could feel the textures of things in games?

02:30:59.426 --> 02:30:59.766
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

02:30:59.806 --> 02:31:01.227
[SPEAKER_06]: That thing was kind of cool.

02:31:01.287 --> 02:31:02.227
[SPEAKER_03]: The haptic stuff.

02:31:02.367 --> 02:31:03.328
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was pretty cool.

02:31:03.748 --> 02:31:04.309
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, it goes...

02:31:08.426 --> 02:31:09.427
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

02:31:29.743 --> 02:31:33.884
[SPEAKER_06]: But logically, take away the five-year-old laughing at everything.

02:31:34.584 --> 02:31:35.004
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I right?

02:31:35.704 --> 02:31:41.865
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you prefer to have something in your hand while you play, or do you like waving your hands in the air, unless you're playing Parapara?

02:31:42.426 --> 02:31:44.946
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's acceptable if I'm playing Dance Central.

02:31:45.006 --> 02:31:47.327
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really the only game, and it's clones.

02:31:48.007 --> 02:31:51.007
[SPEAKER_03]: Those dancing games are really the only ones that have really been a great experience.

02:31:51.027 --> 02:31:54.128
[SPEAKER_11]: Dancing and even the fitness stuff, if that actually works, you know?

02:31:54.148 --> 02:31:54.348
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

02:31:54.668 --> 02:31:56.010
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, when the fitness games work.

02:31:56.210 --> 02:31:57.372
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, I'll agree with that.

02:31:57.512 --> 02:31:59.495
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing with the Wii, you know, and all that.

02:31:59.795 --> 02:32:02.699
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just bitched about this last week or the week before.

02:32:02.739 --> 02:32:05.823
[SPEAKER_03]: That Disneyland Connect, I want to pick up a controller and play it.

02:32:06.324 --> 02:32:06.564
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

02:32:07.405 --> 02:32:07.505
[SPEAKER_03]: Ugh.

02:32:08.368 --> 02:32:36.424
[SPEAKER_06]: and especially when you're dealing it's like they're trying to retrain an entire generation of gamers they want all the newer ones coming in to have a different experience than we did where I'm sorry we're the ones with the money and there's nothing wrong with having a controller you know now the only advantage like I said I can see for having something like this is like if someone's got my you know horrific hand problems but what did I do I started playing on the consoles and started playing on my PC

02:32:37.757 --> 02:32:46.359
[SPEAKER_11]: I think also that they want to get rid of the controller because a lot of elderly and older people think that controllers are too confusing and so it's like all you have to do is wave your hands.

02:32:46.699 --> 02:32:47.540
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I can do that.

02:32:47.920 --> 02:32:52.221
[SPEAKER_11]: I wave my hands at random strangers all the time so I'm totally used to this.

02:32:52.881 --> 02:32:55.362
[SPEAKER_03]: I wave my hand to get kids off my lawn.

02:32:55.382 --> 02:32:58.763
[SPEAKER_06]: I can use this as another kind of analogy here.

02:32:59.343 --> 02:33:03.064
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in band and Rob, you know this, you were in band.

02:33:03.384 --> 02:33:04.184
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you play clarinet at?

02:33:05.310 --> 02:33:06.031
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

02:33:30.049 --> 02:33:30.689
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:33:54.318 --> 02:34:06.003
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at the people who are worse with being coordinated, like actual dancing and everything, I can't dance for crap, but I can play a game.

02:34:06.183 --> 02:34:07.924
[SPEAKER_03]: You can DDR like a son of a bitch.

02:34:08.144 --> 02:34:11.925
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly, because that has to do more with the same thing.

02:34:13.786 --> 02:34:20.892
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a different type of... You have your hand-eye coordination going, but you don't have something that's going to be an abstract movement.

02:34:20.992 --> 02:34:23.194
[SPEAKER_06]: It has something that has a tactile response.

02:34:23.915 --> 02:34:24.616
[SPEAKER_06]: So, anyway.

02:34:24.936 --> 02:34:25.356
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.

02:34:26.197 --> 02:34:26.657
[SPEAKER_03]: Next email.

02:34:27.638 --> 02:34:28.579
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot what I was saying.

02:34:28.659 --> 02:34:28.879
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

02:34:29.780 --> 02:34:30.441
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, OLR.

02:34:30.841 --> 02:34:37.627
[SPEAKER_06]: Just wanted to type you a small email and let you know the last week's show for... Wait for it.

02:34:37.867 --> 02:34:38.468
[SPEAKER_06]: 69 was awesome.

02:34:39.268 --> 02:34:39.669
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice job.

02:34:41.064 --> 02:34:45.187
[SPEAKER_06]: Also wanted to say that Shane was right about sound shapes and Rob, your review was excellent.

02:34:45.967 --> 02:34:48.649
[SPEAKER_06]: It is truly a great game and a breath of fresh air for the Vita.

02:34:49.310 --> 02:34:51.491
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, I know you are an FPS fan.

02:34:51.711 --> 02:34:54.093
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to get into CSGO?

02:34:54.673 --> 02:34:55.073
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

02:34:55.113 --> 02:34:57.235
[SPEAKER_11]: No, probably not going to get into Counter-Strike GO.

02:34:57.435 --> 02:34:57.835
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

02:34:58.436 --> 02:34:59.176
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, what's that?

02:34:59.196 --> 02:35:00.297
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, I'm on the beta now.

02:35:00.377 --> 02:35:01.197
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the free-to-play one?

02:35:01.638 --> 02:35:06.441
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's the free-to-play one, but I never really played Counter-Strike, so I don't know.

02:35:07.988 --> 02:35:09.251
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, I'm on the beta now.

02:35:09.372 --> 02:35:10.054
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty good.

02:35:10.214 --> 02:35:12.159
[SPEAKER_06]: Old school Counter-Strike with a new look.

02:35:13.303 --> 02:35:14.887
[SPEAKER_06]: Anywho, keep up the great work, Travis.

02:35:15.762 --> 02:35:16.703
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you for the compliments.

02:35:16.883 --> 02:35:19.025
[SPEAKER_03]: I love getting emails where it's just nothing but compliments.

02:35:19.065 --> 02:35:23.869
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, first-person shooters have become my second-place genre of choice.

02:35:25.070 --> 02:35:25.690
[SPEAKER_11]: You like bugs.

02:35:25.951 --> 02:35:28.253
[SPEAKER_11]: I like sandbox games.

02:35:28.633 --> 02:35:34.538
[SPEAKER_11]: I do need to go back to playing more Sleeping Dogs because that's pretty awesome.

02:35:34.698 --> 02:35:39.342
[SPEAKER_11]: But really, this is just all killing time before Grand Theft Auto V comes out.

02:35:39.382 --> 02:35:40.022
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it's just...

02:35:40.823 --> 02:35:41.764
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all it's going to be.

02:35:42.104 --> 02:35:48.527
[SPEAKER_11]: That and also maybe a quick excursion to Defense Force on the Vita when that comes out at the end of September in Japan.

02:35:49.168 --> 02:35:49.828
Can't wait.

02:35:51.029 --> 02:35:51.329
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:35:51.369 --> 02:35:53.690
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get a little bit angsty here with the FU.

02:35:53.710 --> 02:35:54.571
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it for the mailbag, right?

02:35:55.111 --> 02:35:55.351
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

02:35:55.691 --> 02:35:59.193
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email in the future.

02:35:59.513 --> 02:36:00.574
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, let's get angsty.

02:36:15.804 --> 02:36:17.634
[SPEAKER_03]: FU's of the week time, DarkSakura

02:36:20.103 --> 02:36:24.066
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to be difficult for me to say.

02:36:24.987 --> 02:36:27.348
[SPEAKER_06]: But I did say it on my Facebook and got into an argument with my mother.

02:36:28.349 --> 02:36:30.931
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, I can't say anything on Facebook without getting into an argument with my mother.

02:36:30.951 --> 02:36:32.512
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck that.

02:36:33.993 --> 02:36:41.799
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to say a current F you to the Republican Party and their choice of who's running and his running mate.

02:36:42.079 --> 02:36:45.802
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that I... And I really am trying not to be judgmental.

02:36:46.422 --> 02:36:48.503
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah, I'm a judgmental bitch anyway, but it doesn't matter.

02:36:49.724 --> 02:37:13.656
[SPEAKER_06]: but anyone who supports that level of evil I don't know that I would be able to look them in the eye so fuck that level of evil I'm done let's see I guess F you to I don't know be burnt out at work that's it

02:37:15.618 --> 02:37:16.798
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

02:37:35.843 --> 02:37:53.460
[SPEAKER_03]: and more importantly an F you to a real toll on my body F you to myself for overdoing it at the gym Monday because like I really hurt my leg by I guess I didn't stretch good enough beforehand or I did too much resistance and on the bike because I do a lot of cardio and yeah I was paying for it for like five days I couldn't go back to the gym

02:37:53.780 --> 02:37:54.600
[SPEAKER_03]: I really wanted to go.

02:37:54.780 --> 02:37:55.180
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may.

02:37:55.940 --> 02:38:04.662
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is what has been drilled into my head by all of... I used to be really good friends with one of my gym... the ladies that taught classes at my gym.

02:38:05.402 --> 02:38:10.363
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're supposed to do a five-minute light warm-up, then stretch, then do your stuff.

02:38:10.843 --> 02:38:11.663
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I didn't do that.

02:38:12.083 --> 02:38:14.464
[SPEAKER_03]: I do the light... Never stretch your muscles cold.

02:38:14.484 --> 02:38:17.344
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't just go right into high resistance, obviously.

02:38:17.384 --> 02:38:20.905
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to do the up and down, like the little up and down type of thing.

02:38:21.765 --> 02:38:23.145
[SPEAKER_07]: Circuit style.

02:38:23.763 --> 02:38:51.449
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess but I don't like circuit implies to me you do five minutes on every machine I'm not at that level yet you know I just I it's if I can get my fat ass on a bike and roll around on it for an hour that is an accomplishment for me so but um it's you never want to work out with muscles that are cold you always want like Dan used to just go sit in the sauna before he did anything anything but honestly you actually want to work and then stretch and then work interesting yeah just saying

02:38:51.889 --> 02:38:52.649
[SPEAKER_03]: Learning something.

02:38:52.970 --> 02:38:54.150
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii Fit didn't tell me that.

02:38:54.871 --> 02:38:56.652
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe it did and I wasn't paying attention.

02:38:56.712 --> 02:38:59.453
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, you know all the time I used to spend working out.

02:39:00.073 --> 02:39:06.277
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys and then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR as well as the Twitter topics.

02:39:06.297 --> 02:39:07.918
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get out my iPad and see if there are any.

02:39:08.498 --> 02:39:11.399
[SPEAKER_03]: And any last minute stories Loki might have.

02:39:11.440 --> 02:39:13.601
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, two final stories for you guys.

02:39:13.641 --> 02:39:13.861
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

02:39:14.421 --> 02:39:43.389
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so one of the games I mentioned I played this week was Castle Miner Z which has sold 900,000 copies and apparently is one of the fastest selling Xbox Live indie games I'm not sure if it's the fastest selling one but I know because I know I made a zombie with games in it or I made a zombie game made a game with zombies in it sold quite a bit and then I'm sure there's been some other ones that have done well as part of the indie games program

02:39:44.249 --> 02:39:50.432
[SPEAKER_11]: It's definitely one of the most recent ones, according to the developer.

02:39:51.312 --> 02:39:56.494
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, I guess it is at the top of the daily best-selling area of Xbox.com right now.

02:39:57.454 --> 02:39:59.495
[SPEAKER_11]: It's only 80 Microsoft points, so if you want to check it out.

02:40:00.295 --> 02:40:04.357
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure there's also a lot of other good games for 80 Microsoft points on the indie games as well.

02:40:05.257 --> 02:40:06.878
[SPEAKER_11]: and other unrelated news.

02:40:08.298 --> 02:40:09.439
[SPEAKER_11]: Minecraft.

02:40:09.459 --> 02:40:11.139
[SPEAKER_11]: 7 million copies sold on PC.

02:40:11.679 --> 02:40:12.319
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's pretty cool.

02:40:13.280 --> 02:40:15.200
[SPEAKER_11]: So that genre of game seems to be doing pretty well.

02:40:17.161 --> 02:40:18.001
[SPEAKER_03]: It just won't die.

02:40:18.222 --> 02:40:19.382
[SPEAKER_03]: The phenomenon will not stop.

02:40:21.257 --> 02:40:22.117
[SPEAKER_03]: Axl Rose Remember Guns N' Roses?

02:40:43.002 --> 02:40:48.427
[SPEAKER_03]: Axl Rose had a preliminary hearing about the Guitar Hero 3 lawsuit.

02:40:48.668 --> 02:40:51.871
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently there is a tentative court date in February 2013.

02:40:53.192 --> 02:41:00.058
[SPEAKER_03]: Axl Rose is pissed about the game, which came out in late 2007 as a reminder, and it will finally go to court in 2013.

02:41:02.300 --> 02:41:22.189
[SPEAKER_03]: uh apparently it unlawfully associated Guns N' Roses music with Slash who as you know was formerly with Guns N' Roses and him and Axl Rose they don't get along so Axl Rose was pissed about that basically saying Slash was associated with these songs but they're not his songs so fuck all y'all right

02:41:23.959 --> 02:41:32.021
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the judge during the preliminary hearing wanted to toss out the claim of fraud because the statute of limitations has expired.

02:41:33.021 --> 02:41:37.002
[SPEAKER_03]: However, let's see, it came up here, quote,

02:41:50.985 --> 02:42:02.613
[SPEAKER_03]: from December 2007 through November 2010, Activision was offering me a Guns N' Roses dedicated video game, a game dedicated to music from the Chinese Democracy album, and other proposals.

02:42:03.513 --> 02:42:04.354
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

02:42:04.854 --> 02:42:10.518
[SPEAKER_03]: So the judge did dismiss the claim of fraud, but the breach of contract, it is moving forward for February 1st, 2013.

02:42:12.259 --> 02:42:20.825
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why it took Axl Rose three years to file a lawsuit, because they were basically cock-teasing him about his own game, or so he claims, allegedly, all that good stuff.

02:42:21.886 --> 02:42:41.845
[SPEAKER_03]: But it makes sense why they decided not to do it Because when Guitar Hero Van Halen and Band Hero and all that kind of oversaturated the market You know, those artist-centric video games, none of them really did very well The only one that did marginally good was The Beatles And when The Beatles can only do marginally successful, it's not good enough

02:42:42.305 --> 02:42:43.266
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Unemployment!

02:43:10.522 --> 02:43:10.922
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

02:43:11.082 --> 02:43:11.603
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

02:43:12.243 --> 02:43:12.543
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

02:43:13.584 --> 02:43:15.705
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to find something different for the fortune cookie real quick.

02:43:15.925 --> 02:43:17.106
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the best thing ever, so hold on.

02:43:17.526 --> 02:43:18.307
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, you do that.

02:43:18.367 --> 02:43:19.427
[SPEAKER_03]: Send it to me in private message.

02:43:19.747 --> 02:43:20.388
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll switch it out.

02:43:20.828 --> 02:43:23.589
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Skype line's open, guys.

02:43:23.610 --> 02:43:26.771
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:43:26.811 --> 02:43:30.133
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead and give us a call if you want to talk about anything we've talked about in the news tonight.

02:43:30.573 --> 02:43:32.014
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe you have something new.

02:43:32.354 --> 02:43:33.275
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

02:43:34.376 --> 02:43:35.776
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do some quick Twitter topics.

02:43:35.796 --> 02:43:36.637
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have a lot of them.

02:43:37.077 --> 02:44:01.023
[SPEAKER_03]: but we do have a couple of them SSJ100 Matt sent us a tweet and I think I already know what this is without going to it but he sends us a tweet that says this is how China gets rid of outlawed arcade machines or what they call gambling machines and he sends us a link to a story from arcadeheroes.com yep I had a feeling look at all these arcade machines on fire they just set them on fire burn it with fire burn it with fire

02:44:03.075 --> 02:44:03.756
[SPEAKER_03]: And there they go.

02:44:04.116 --> 02:44:05.658
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, do you have any last-minute stories for us?

02:44:06.899 --> 02:44:11.003
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I forgot to mention that as part of my gaming week, I actually played Megazooks.

02:44:12.304 --> 02:44:14.926
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, the old ZZT-type game.

02:44:15.567 --> 02:44:17.709
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually booted that up.

02:44:17.829 --> 02:44:19.731
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, oh, hey, I'll make something in this.

02:44:19.791 --> 02:44:25.176
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I realized how out of practice in making stuff with Megazooks I was.

02:44:25.316 --> 02:44:26.697
[SPEAKER_11]: So I said, eh, fuck it.

02:44:27.498 --> 02:44:28.119
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't care anymore.

02:44:28.159 --> 02:44:29.060
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember Megazooks.

02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:29.620
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

02:44:29.941 --> 02:44:30.541
[SPEAKER_03]: It was awesome.

02:44:30.762 --> 02:44:31.282
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

02:44:32.183 --> 02:44:35.386
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's go to some tweets from Tigerclaw.

02:44:35.526 --> 02:44:38.750
[SPEAKER_03]: Heavy Rain Director tells game industry it's time to grow up.

02:44:39.751 --> 02:44:41.532
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I even get into the article, what do you guys think?

02:44:41.592 --> 02:44:43.034
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it time for the games industry to grow up?

02:44:45.234 --> 02:44:47.037
[SPEAKER_03]: We mean by grow up.

02:44:47.617 --> 02:44:49.921
[SPEAKER_06]: One goes to one corner, the other goes to another corner.

02:44:50.081 --> 02:44:56.370
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the pull quote from Gamasutra, which Tigerclaw linked us to on Twitter at twitter.com.

02:44:56.971 --> 02:44:59.575
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how many first-person shooters can you make?

02:44:59.855 --> 02:45:05.998
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a moment where we need to grow up, and that's David Cage, who is the director of Beyond Two Souls.

02:45:06.118 --> 02:45:07.398
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I'm sorry.

02:45:08.399 --> 02:45:13.021
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds like he needs to grow up because it sounds like he's whining that Heavy Rain didn't sell as well.

02:45:13.341 --> 02:45:13.681
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

02:45:13.701 --> 02:45:15.182
[SPEAKER_11]: They're making games that sell well.

02:45:15.402 --> 02:45:18.265
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on though, because I do agree with this.

02:45:18.305 --> 02:45:21.467
[SPEAKER_03]: That poll quote is a little sensational, but let's get into the full quote here.

02:45:21.507 --> 02:45:22.188
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm in the article.

02:45:22.268 --> 02:45:29.354
[SPEAKER_03]: Quote, I think we should have more courage in our industry and take more risks because I think this is what the industry needs now.

02:45:29.494 --> 02:45:31.216
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how many first-person shooters can you make?

02:45:31.556 --> 02:45:34.118
[SPEAKER_03]: How many monsters, aliens, zombies can you kill in games?

02:45:34.418 --> 02:45:36.000
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a moment where we need to grow up.

02:45:36.220 --> 02:45:36.941
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to grow up.

02:45:37.701 --> 02:45:40.562
[SPEAKER_03]: I often think the industry suffers of the Peter Pan syndrome.

02:45:40.823 --> 02:45:43.244
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the fact that we don't want to grow up, so we stay kids.

02:45:43.564 --> 02:45:47.746
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is a moment where you need to grow up as an industry, and you cannot keep up with the Peter Pan syndrome.

02:45:48.006 --> 02:45:49.967
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to grow, and I think this is the right time.

02:45:50.487 --> 02:45:57.210
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I don't agree so much with the second part of that, but the first part about they need some different shit, I kind of agree with it.

02:45:57.730 --> 02:46:00.932
[SPEAKER_03]: Who isn't sick of sequel, sequel, sequel, sequel?

02:46:01.312 --> 02:46:03.253
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, granted, I guess in some ways we support it.

02:46:03.573 --> 02:46:06.594
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do like a lot of the new ideas.

02:46:07.134 --> 02:46:17.576
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if we never experimented with new ideas, we wouldn't have recent hits like Mass Effect or Little Big Planet, which, granted, all spawn their own sequels, but, you know, good games.

02:46:18.296 --> 02:46:20.397
[SPEAKER_03]: Even on the indie side, Braid, Limbo.

02:46:20.457 --> 02:46:23.858
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Mass Effect kind of turned into just a shooter with this story, but...

02:46:25.638 --> 02:46:34.261
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just... I think that the reason why they're not taking risks right now, because whenever they seem to try to take risks, they end up not selling well, those games.

02:46:34.942 --> 02:46:38.423
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, some of these companies are in trouble, like THQ, for example.

02:46:38.723 --> 02:46:48.667
[SPEAKER_11]: They took a risk with, you know, making that whole, you know, tablet drawing pad thing, because everyone's like, oh, hey, cool, it's like, you know, like Mario Paint.

02:46:48.847 --> 02:46:50.268
[SPEAKER_11]: And then no one bought it.

02:46:50.568 --> 02:46:51.048
[SPEAKER_11]: And then...

02:46:51.308 --> 02:46:51.508
[SPEAKER_11]: Madworld

02:47:14.389 --> 02:47:16.490
[SPEAKER_11]: There's another example of a game that took risks on the Wii.

02:47:16.791 --> 02:47:17.431
[SPEAKER_11]: No one bought it.

02:47:18.232 --> 02:47:21.634
[SPEAKER_11]: Conduit, pretty awesome first-person shooter game on the Wii.

02:47:21.914 --> 02:47:22.494
[SPEAKER_11]: No one bought it.

02:47:22.875 --> 02:47:24.696
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's where your risks come in.

02:47:25.056 --> 02:47:26.757
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft in chat says, I bought Mario Paint.

02:47:27.898 --> 02:47:33.461
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah, you bought Mario Paint, but you didn't buy the tablet that THQ put out or the one that Ubisoft put out.

02:47:33.702 --> 02:47:36.383
[SPEAKER_03]: I am woefully neglecting the Skype line over here.

02:47:36.423 --> 02:47:37.124
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me take some calls.

02:47:37.184 --> 02:47:38.044
[SPEAKER_03]: I just missed that one.

02:47:38.084 --> 02:47:38.885
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me take this one, though.

02:47:38.905 --> 02:47:40.026
[SPEAKER_03]: There's two calls lighting up right now.

02:47:40.346 --> 02:47:41.266
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

02:47:41.286 --> 02:47:41.607
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

02:47:43.257 --> 02:47:44.678
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Zaku, what's on your mind, buddy?

02:47:45.678 --> 02:47:52.581
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing much, just recovering from going out with my girlfriend today and everything.

02:47:53.101 --> 02:47:54.381
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kings of the Coast yesterday.

02:47:54.802 --> 02:47:55.902
[SPEAKER_03]: Recovering, huh?

02:47:56.902 --> 02:47:59.923
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is true.

02:48:00.003 --> 02:48:05.445
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have competed today, but since I have a relationship and everything, she comes first.

02:48:05.505 --> 02:48:07.826
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

02:48:07.886 --> 02:48:09.387
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a 2DX tournament today?

02:48:10.080 --> 02:48:12.021
[SPEAKER_00]: There was the Kings of the Coast that ate on the break.

02:48:29.972 --> 02:48:35.776
[SPEAKER_00]: That and watching Expendables 2 with her, which she actually enjoyed.

02:48:36.497 --> 02:48:42.802
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though she was kind of hesitant at first, she actually enjoyed watching old men shoot guns and kill people.

02:48:43.662 --> 02:48:44.563
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, she's a keeper.

02:48:46.084 --> 02:48:49.326
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's amazing that finally it's done.

02:48:49.607 --> 02:48:52.389
[SPEAKER_03]: Zaku is now officially over Bomani, everybody.

02:48:52.869 --> 02:48:53.089
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.

02:48:53.109 --> 02:48:54.170
[SPEAKER_00]: Girls and Guns did it.

02:48:54.190 --> 02:48:55.031
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only for today.

02:48:55.771 --> 02:48:56.992
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:49:21.747 --> 02:49:22.728
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people answered.

02:49:22.768 --> 02:49:27.131
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're almost wrapping up the doubles tournament right now as we speak.

02:49:27.191 --> 02:49:29.272
[SPEAKER_00]: What version of 2DX do they have out there in Jersey?

02:49:30.193 --> 02:49:30.593
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln.

02:49:31.494 --> 02:49:33.856
[SPEAKER_00]: Same one they have out not far from me in Queens.

02:49:34.356 --> 02:49:34.616
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

02:49:35.737 --> 02:49:36.157
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, though?

02:49:36.177 --> 02:49:37.638
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not hard to pack eight on the break.

02:49:37.678 --> 02:49:41.761
[SPEAKER_03]: I seem to remember it was kind of a small place because the arcade machines took up a lot of room.

02:49:41.881 --> 02:49:43.382
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be hard to pack that joint.

02:49:43.643 --> 02:49:46.645
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd say the same thing about SVGL is similar.

02:49:46.725 --> 02:49:49.547
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not hard to pack that place because there's not a lot of space.

02:49:51.101 --> 02:49:54.583
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, let's digress a little bit.

02:49:55.024 --> 02:50:12.695
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to post up a link to an article that you probably already discussed probably earlier before I got on about the Assassin's Creed 3 director basically chiding Japanese games and to the point of playing the race card because they're basically getting a free pass.

02:50:13.016 --> 02:50:16.438
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, we didn't bring this up earlier, so I'm glad you are.

02:50:16.618 --> 02:50:17.979
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead and tell us a little bit about this.

02:50:18.641 --> 02:50:35.091
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, long story short, the creative director of Assassin's Creed 3, Alex Hutchinson, he basically went on a rant earlier last week in deriding why certain Japanese games are getting free passes, like something about...

02:50:37.006 --> 02:50:44.310
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, saying stuff about, like, just think how many Japanese games are released where the stories are literally gibberish.

02:50:44.410 --> 02:50:45.190
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally gibberish.

02:50:45.610 --> 02:50:50.313
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way you could write it with a straight face and journalists say, oh, it's brilliant.

02:50:50.353 --> 02:50:55.515
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let me read this quote here, and this is what you're going off of here, and this is in an interview with CVG.

02:50:56.396 --> 02:51:01.578
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, just think about how many Japanese games are released where their stories are literally gibberish.

02:51:02.019 --> 02:51:02.719
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally gibberish.

02:51:02.739 --> 02:51:06.261
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way you could write it with a straight face and journalists say, oh, it's brilliant.

02:51:06.881 --> 02:51:10.502
[SPEAKER_03]: Then Gears of War comes out and apparently it's the worst written narrative in a game ever.

02:51:10.622 --> 02:51:13.643
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take Gears of War over Bayonetta any time.

02:51:14.123 --> 02:51:18.045
[SPEAKER_03]: It's patronizing to say, oh, those Japanese stories, they don't really mean what they're doing.

02:51:18.465 --> 02:51:21.766
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get why critics didn't like Gears of War.

02:51:21.826 --> 02:51:22.706
[SPEAKER_03]: That's news to me.

02:51:22.726 --> 02:51:24.327
[SPEAKER_03]: Bayonetta was a better game.

02:51:25.907 --> 02:51:29.610
[SPEAKER_00]: But the real kicker is his first response.

02:51:30.171 --> 02:51:31.171
[SPEAKER_00]: You want my real answer?

02:51:31.291 --> 02:51:37.856
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a subtle racism in the business, especially on the journalist side, where Japanese developers are forgiven for doing what they do.

02:51:37.876 --> 02:51:39.717
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's condescending to do this.

02:51:40.538 --> 02:51:42.540
[SPEAKER_00]: So he really, like, goes off the bat.

02:51:42.560 --> 02:51:45.483
[SPEAKER_00]: He really, like, goes for the juggler on the first sentence.

02:51:45.603 --> 02:51:50.487
[SPEAKER_03]: I just... I think he's... I mean, what about... We just talked... I'll tell you what we did talk about earlier in the show.

02:51:50.928 --> 02:51:51.828
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy.

02:51:52.389 --> 02:51:57.514
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Final Fantasy XIII did get hazed for a lot of that stuff and being too linear in a way.

02:51:57.554 --> 02:52:00.196
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, XIV got right through the damn coals.

02:52:00.756 --> 02:52:01.057
[SPEAKER_00]: So...

02:52:01.437 --> 02:52:04.982
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, 14 was an abomination because it was poorly executed.

02:52:05.522 --> 02:52:18.440
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that so many gaffes in the beginning and then to the point where they had to actually, you know, the creative director and the producers had to hand in the resignations, it was just a cluster.

02:52:19.711 --> 02:52:46.783
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas if you look at other American RPGs like Skyrim which I'm actually going through right now thank you Steam sale of last month but you see how versed that game is it's getting to the point where I'm putting at least two hours a night right now just on Skyrim alone because it's so many things to do you can level up your character if you wanted to continue on the main quest do some side quests try your luck in killing giants

02:52:47.583 --> 02:52:48.846
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also buggy as shit.

02:52:48.866 --> 02:52:54.557
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a GTA, but with actual goals towards beefing up your character stats.

02:52:56.101 --> 02:53:14.269
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think what goes wrong with Japanese games like Final Fantasy, it only sticks to, I mean, there is an open world, there is a concept of an open world, but everything is pretty much linear in the sense that you have to do X mission, Y mission, side quests, and obviously the occasional grinding.

02:53:14.289 --> 02:53:21.392
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no retribution where you can attack freely any other type of enemy, because the combat system is so rigid.

02:53:23.672 --> 02:53:30.820
[SPEAKER_00]: In the sense that you randomly encounter enemies, you have to fight within that realm of your enemy versus your characters.

02:53:31.681 --> 02:53:35.665
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm using Final Fantasy VII as a frame of reference, but you get the idea.

02:53:36.446 --> 02:53:45.216
[SPEAKER_00]: The way Bethesda outdid Squeenix was just thinking outside the box and applying what they've already done best.

02:53:45.356 --> 02:53:47.136
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can't people just like what they like?

02:53:47.436 --> 02:53:50.037
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just like what we like and leave people alone.

02:53:50.377 --> 02:53:55.938
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't understand why he's gotta, you know, some people like the Japanese stuff and let it be.

02:53:56.398 --> 02:54:02.920
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't think just because you like one Japanese game means you love them all or just because you love all Japanese games there's gonna be a few you hate, you know?

02:54:03.300 --> 02:54:10.181
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it's just way too broad of a statement and I'm hoping this is just media sensationalism here that we're only perpetuating with this call.

02:54:10.561 --> 02:54:14.322
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I would really just hope that he's not that narrow-minded.

02:54:16.411 --> 02:54:17.172
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess so.

02:54:17.692 --> 02:54:17.953
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:54:18.573 --> 02:54:20.675
[SPEAKER_03]: Zaku, I got to wrap up and let you go so we can get more calls.

02:54:20.855 --> 02:54:22.437
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other thoughts here before we let you go?

02:54:23.998 --> 02:54:24.979
[SPEAKER_03]: That was about it.

02:54:25.360 --> 02:54:25.640
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:54:25.700 --> 02:54:27.021
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun and be safe.

02:54:27.442 --> 02:54:28.002
[SPEAKER_03]: Be safe, Zaku.

02:54:28.022 --> 02:54:28.483
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.

02:54:28.643 --> 02:54:28.903
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:54:28.943 --> 02:54:29.103
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

02:54:31.376 --> 02:54:48.332
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call I'll probably have you guys take the next call because I need to go start dinner so 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio I think I missed a Twitter topic

02:54:49.113 --> 02:54:49.573
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you?

02:54:49.754 --> 02:54:55.518
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there was one, because I was in the middle of one, but then there was a second one that Tigerclaw had sent that I wanted to get to.

02:54:55.598 --> 02:54:56.578
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, never mind.

02:54:56.758 --> 02:54:57.379
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a reprieve.

02:54:57.759 --> 02:54:59.961
[SPEAKER_03]: So, DarkSakura, Loki, one of you can take this call.

02:54:59.981 --> 02:55:00.261
[SPEAKER_03]: You ready?

02:55:00.421 --> 02:55:00.981
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

02:55:02.362 --> 02:55:02.863
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello!

02:55:03.143 --> 02:55:04.944
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:55:05.104 --> 02:55:05.585
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you want?

02:55:06.225 --> 02:55:12.309
[SPEAKER_09]: Tiger, tiger, tiger, tiger, chew, chew, it's too sorry.

02:55:12.669 --> 02:55:14.591
[SPEAKER_09]: Tiger, I'm chewing for you.

02:55:16.363 --> 02:55:19.005
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, how are you this evening, Jim Sally?

02:55:19.505 --> 02:55:20.225
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good.

02:55:20.265 --> 02:55:21.906
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so glad you picked up the phone today.

02:55:22.407 --> 02:55:23.748
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, me too.

02:55:24.008 --> 02:55:25.609
[SPEAKER_06]: Should I use my phone operator voice?

02:55:26.548 --> 02:55:30.989
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, you do your phone operator voice and I'll do my annoying Portuguese mama voice.

02:55:31.029 --> 02:55:32.790
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see if we can do some funny coffee here.

02:55:33.330 --> 02:55:34.110
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be good.

02:55:34.451 --> 02:55:35.471
[SPEAKER_01]: You do your voice, I'll do my voice.

02:55:35.491 --> 02:55:38.952
[SPEAKER_06]: See, now I'm laughing too hard to do the phone operator voice.

02:55:39.192 --> 02:55:40.753
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, I call for the job.

02:55:41.993 --> 02:55:43.874
[SPEAKER_10]: I come to clean your stuff.

02:55:45.694 --> 02:55:47.055
[SPEAKER_06]: Just put your stuff in the corner.

02:55:47.875 --> 02:55:49.875
[SPEAKER_06]: My son come to your house today.

02:55:49.895 --> 02:55:52.296
[SPEAKER_06]: Put his underwear clean.

02:55:53.717 --> 02:55:54.797
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's up, otherwise?

02:55:55.911 --> 02:56:04.015
[SPEAKER_01]: I was calling to have a discussion about the new Walking Dead game that I downloaded on my iPad this weekend.

02:56:05.175 --> 02:56:06.096
[SPEAKER_06]: Walking Dead.

02:56:06.596 --> 02:56:07.216
[SPEAKER_01]: Walking Dead.

02:56:07.496 --> 02:56:10.157
[SPEAKER_01]: It's by Telltale and it's nice.

02:56:10.618 --> 02:56:11.618
[SPEAKER_01]: We like Telltale.

02:56:12.218 --> 02:56:12.518
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

02:56:12.718 --> 02:56:13.979
[SPEAKER_06]: We like Telltale.

02:56:14.639 --> 02:56:15.400
[SPEAKER_01]: I like them too, man.

02:56:15.420 --> 02:56:21.442
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, this is going to be a little bit of a spoiler review because I only played the first half hour of it anyway.

02:56:21.462 --> 02:56:23.303
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the first episode so spoilers are okay.

02:56:23.743 --> 02:56:24.564
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a scene.

02:56:24.984 --> 02:56:25.284
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen.

02:56:25.908 --> 02:56:29.931
[SPEAKER_01]: It was this scene where I was in a house and a zombie came after me.

02:56:29.951 --> 02:56:31.532
[SPEAKER_01]: A little zombie like babysitter shit.

02:56:31.892 --> 02:56:33.894
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kicked that zombie in the snatch.

02:56:34.334 --> 02:56:37.836
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the zombie fell down and I picked up the hammer.

02:56:38.377 --> 02:56:39.578
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god.

02:56:40.038 --> 02:56:42.820
[SPEAKER_01]: You schmuck the zombie in the face with the hammer.

02:56:43.160 --> 02:56:45.822
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Toto's like, hey, would you like to stop?

02:56:46.242 --> 02:56:46.923
[SPEAKER_01]: Or keep going?

02:56:46.943 --> 02:56:50.145
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I'll keep smashing this thing in the face right now.

02:56:51.034 --> 02:56:52.374
[SPEAKER_01]: You smash it.

02:56:52.855 --> 02:56:53.695
[SPEAKER_01]: You smash it.

02:56:54.995 --> 02:56:56.055
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks so gross.

02:56:56.135 --> 02:56:58.016
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the kind of options gamers want.

02:56:58.656 --> 02:56:59.836
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet satisfied.

02:57:00.397 --> 02:57:02.217
[SPEAKER_01]: It was gross yet satisfied.

02:57:02.637 --> 02:57:03.677
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you like to see more?

02:57:04.758 --> 02:57:05.438
[SPEAKER_01]: We can oblige.

02:57:05.538 --> 02:57:05.718
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.

02:57:05.778 --> 02:57:06.958
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't get enough of it.

02:57:08.399 --> 02:57:09.419
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so simple.

02:57:10.699 --> 02:57:11.539
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little bit.

02:57:12.600 --> 02:57:17.141
[SPEAKER_01]: They say it's just point and click, but there is a bit of a quick time to it every now and again that you got to do.

02:57:17.608 --> 02:57:19.769
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like baby quick time, you know what I'm saying?

02:57:20.009 --> 02:57:20.209
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

02:57:20.249 --> 02:57:21.710
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's pretty baby quick time.

02:57:22.030 --> 02:57:24.091
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is exactly what I need on a Sunday night.

02:57:24.491 --> 02:57:27.572
[SPEAKER_10]: When I've been having salad.

02:57:28.012 --> 02:57:32.014
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not really salad.

02:57:32.074 --> 02:57:35.656
[SPEAKER_10]: It's green leaves that make you talk like this.

02:57:38.297 --> 02:57:38.697
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

02:57:39.697 --> 02:57:40.638
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, hey.

02:57:42.659 --> 02:57:43.139
[SPEAKER_01]: I also...

02:57:44.322 --> 02:57:45.923
[SPEAKER_01]: Is Rob even around?

02:57:45.983 --> 02:57:46.643
[SPEAKER_01]: Is Rob leaving?

02:57:46.683 --> 02:57:48.184
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob was being domestic.

02:57:48.204 --> 02:57:49.365
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got back.

02:57:49.945 --> 02:57:50.845
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Jim Sally.

02:57:51.166 --> 02:57:52.526
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Rob Roberts.

02:57:52.566 --> 02:57:53.367
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?

02:57:53.507 --> 02:57:54.047
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm good.

02:57:54.147 --> 02:57:55.488
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm being domestic right now.

02:57:55.568 --> 02:57:57.789
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to walk away from the studio for a minute.

02:57:57.829 --> 02:57:58.289
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's up?

02:57:58.950 --> 02:58:00.430
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, Rob.

02:58:01.411 --> 02:58:05.853
[SPEAKER_01]: I started shopping for microphones.

02:58:09.216 --> 02:58:11.777
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you setting up the Jim Sally Studios?

02:58:12.397 --> 02:58:13.457
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so, man.

02:58:14.157 --> 02:58:16.978
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's time for pillow talk, man.

02:58:17.638 --> 02:58:21.419
[SPEAKER_01]: I even started making a little theme music and stuff, man, for the show.

02:58:21.619 --> 02:58:28.180
[SPEAKER_03]: I gave Jim Sally a name for his show because Jim Sally suggested he be the opener for the opener.

02:58:28.240 --> 02:58:31.501
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he could open for Bobby, which I don't consider Bobby an opener.

02:58:31.521 --> 02:58:32.781
[SPEAKER_03]: I consider him a co-headliner.

02:58:32.821 --> 02:58:34.981
[SPEAKER_03]: But since he calls himself an opener, I'll go with that.

02:58:35.302 --> 02:58:37.402
[SPEAKER_03]: Jim Sally said he could be the opener for the opener.

02:58:37.662 --> 02:58:38.143
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

02:58:54.138 --> 02:58:56.620
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that, the night train.

02:58:56.681 --> 02:58:57.181
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

02:58:57.241 --> 02:58:57.762
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

02:58:58.883 --> 02:59:00.444
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just throwing it out there.

02:59:00.905 --> 02:59:08.412
[SPEAKER_03]: For you, Jim, or for anybody out there in the universe listening to this show, VOG Network, we are very interested in getting some movie

02:59:09.397 --> 02:59:10.638
[SPEAKER_03]: Podcast would be great.

02:59:10.798 --> 02:59:16.600
[SPEAKER_03]: Book podcast is like at the top of my want list right now, be it manga, comic, or written book.

02:59:17.241 --> 02:59:18.641
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep bugging my wife.

02:59:18.941 --> 02:59:25.504
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I would love to see like a role play, like an old school tabletop gaming.

02:59:25.885 --> 02:59:29.907
[SPEAKER_03]: And it could be LARPing Dungeons and Dragons, and I love, love, love.

02:59:29.927 --> 02:59:30.807
[SPEAKER_03]: I would so do this.

02:59:31.127 --> 02:59:36.111
[SPEAKER_03]: I love, love, love the idea of a game that is podcast.

02:59:36.772 --> 02:59:39.134
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that would be difficult.

02:59:39.214 --> 02:59:41.556
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody who's actually running a game to be podcast.

02:59:42.076 --> 02:59:44.258
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone at the table would need a microphone.

02:59:45.319 --> 02:59:48.502
[SPEAKER_06]: Nah, you get some good boom mics.

02:59:48.562 --> 02:59:51.024
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'd have to have the die cam.

02:59:51.665 --> 02:59:53.726
[SPEAKER_06]: You see them rolling and see who's cheating at the table.

02:59:54.567 --> 02:59:55.648
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't nudge that.

02:59:55.908 --> 02:59:56.629
[SPEAKER_06]: I sneezed.

02:59:57.372 --> 03:00:00.859
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie just rolled a 7 on the 20-sided die.

03:00:02.142 --> 03:00:04.707
[SPEAKER_02]: This means that she has failed her intelligence check.

03:00:07.057 --> 03:00:09.939
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

03:00:35.833 --> 03:00:36.654
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be the problem.

03:00:36.934 --> 03:00:37.755
[SPEAKER_03]: So, anyhow.

03:00:38.135 --> 03:00:42.359
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you just leave the microphone on today when you leave and I'll come do some pillow talk.

03:00:43.460 --> 03:00:44.301
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm ready for it.

03:00:44.601 --> 03:00:45.562
[SPEAKER_01]: That I might be okay with.

03:00:45.702 --> 03:00:49.305
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a review of 21 Jump Street.

03:00:52.488 --> 03:00:55.751
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a little review snippet that maybe you're going to hear about.

03:00:56.051 --> 03:00:57.673
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a lot of dick jokes in it.

03:00:57.693 --> 03:00:59.374
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of good dick jokes in it.

03:00:59.694 --> 03:01:00.375
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?

03:01:00.680 --> 03:01:02.481
[SPEAKER_01]: Best use of comedic dick in 2010.

03:01:02.721 --> 03:01:11.745
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, for a show that would end up being on like after midnight on the East Coast on a Sunday night, Monday morning, anything goes, really.

03:01:12.365 --> 03:01:13.065
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything goes.

03:01:13.165 --> 03:01:13.966
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Jim Sally.

03:01:14.526 --> 03:01:15.266
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything goes.

03:01:15.286 --> 03:01:17.627
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not bitches and hoes.

03:01:18.628 --> 03:01:18.888
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

03:01:19.548 --> 03:01:21.609
[SPEAKER_03]: Jim, anything else you want to share with us tonight before we let you go?

03:01:24.010 --> 03:01:29.172
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just like to say thank you for the encouragement and and

03:01:29.608 --> 03:01:32.210
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try really hard to do stuff for you.

03:01:32.710 --> 03:01:33.311
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

03:01:33.631 --> 03:01:34.031
[SPEAKER_03]: Anytime.

03:01:35.032 --> 03:01:35.532
[SPEAKER_03]: Anytime, buddy.

03:01:35.832 --> 03:01:38.735
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, take care and give baby a kiss for me.

03:01:39.675 --> 03:01:41.336
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm biting my pillow right now.

03:01:43.358 --> 03:01:43.718
[SPEAKER_03]: Careful.

03:01:43.978 --> 03:01:44.519
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, bye.

03:01:49.127 --> 03:01:50.048
[SPEAKER_03]: Does he know what that means?

03:01:52.049 --> 03:01:55.712
[SPEAKER_03]: You used that word, but I don't think it means what you think it means.

03:01:59.114 --> 03:02:02.897
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, if we did a tabletop gaming cast, it would have to be called Roll to Hit.

03:02:04.738 --> 03:02:05.759
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the comment in chat?

03:02:05.779 --> 03:02:07.200
[SPEAKER_03]: Chiggers says, call it Reroll.

03:02:07.580 --> 03:02:08.000
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

03:02:08.020 --> 03:02:08.520
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good one.

03:02:09.401 --> 03:02:12.463
[SPEAKER_03]: Stan says, I want to see an anime show on VOG Network.

03:02:13.624 --> 03:02:16.506
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma might want to let you know there is one on Tuesdays at 6.30 Pacific.

03:02:21.541 --> 03:02:22.903
[SPEAKER_03]: Answering listeners' demands.

03:02:24.045 --> 03:02:25.908
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see an anime show on VOG Network.

03:02:26.028 --> 03:02:26.329
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

03:02:26.709 --> 03:02:27.611
[SPEAKER_03]: Tune in on Tuesday.

03:02:27.731 --> 03:02:28.031
[SPEAKER_03]: Done.

03:02:29.534 --> 03:02:31.377
[SPEAKER_03]: Technically, you don't see it.

03:02:35.273 --> 03:02:37.035
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, is there any more calls going to come in?

03:02:37.375 --> 03:02:38.356
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hello.

03:02:39.096 --> 03:02:39.497
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitter.

03:02:39.877 --> 03:02:40.478
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot Twitter.

03:02:40.978 --> 03:02:41.519
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Rob.

03:02:41.559 --> 03:02:42.299
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop forgetting Twitter.

03:02:42.319 --> 03:02:43.120
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell was that noise?

03:02:43.140 --> 03:02:43.761
[SPEAKER_07]: All that forgetting.

03:02:43.921 --> 03:02:44.121
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

03:02:45.182 --> 03:02:46.023
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a weird noise.

03:02:46.663 --> 03:02:46.984
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

03:02:48.425 --> 03:02:50.086
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma in chat says, thank you.

03:02:51.147 --> 03:02:51.788
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome, BB.

03:02:52.702 --> 03:02:55.825
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, one more tweet from Tiger Claw.

03:02:56.545 --> 03:02:57.566
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I fucking hate this.

03:02:57.586 --> 03:03:01.670
[SPEAKER_03]: When you go to mobile websites, GameSpot now has a free iPad app.

03:03:01.730 --> 03:03:02.711
[SPEAKER_03]: Click OK to get that.

03:03:02.831 --> 03:03:03.111
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck off.

03:03:03.131 --> 03:03:03.952
[SPEAKER_03]: No one, Kerr.

03:03:03.972 --> 03:03:05.734
[SPEAKER_03]: If I wanted your app, I would go download it.

03:03:06.995 --> 03:03:09.797
[SPEAKER_03]: The worst are the ones with the gigantic splash screens.

03:03:09.877 --> 03:03:12.179
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously, Tiger Claw linked me to a GameSpot article.

03:03:12.620 --> 03:03:15.222
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, but there's a call coming in, so you'll just have to wait and see what it's about.

03:03:17.264 --> 03:03:18.184
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

03:03:18.204 --> 03:03:18.525
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

03:03:19.312 --> 03:03:21.793
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hello there, fine Olarians.

03:03:21.913 --> 03:03:22.613
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Sterlok.

03:03:23.394 --> 03:03:24.354
[SPEAKER_03]: I got called fine.

03:03:24.934 --> 03:03:25.835
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, Sterlok?

03:03:28.155 --> 03:03:28.676
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too much.

03:03:30.796 --> 03:03:37.859
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you talked about the Vita firmware update in Part A. I kind of missed a lot of it.

03:03:37.959 --> 03:03:43.982
[SPEAKER_03]: Briefly, it let off our rapid-fire news tonight, but we talked quickly about it, so what do you want to say about it?

03:03:45.062 --> 03:03:47.283
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it kind of makes me want a Vita now.

03:03:48.237 --> 03:03:50.761
[SPEAKER_03]: A firmware update makes you want a Vita.

03:03:50.801 --> 03:03:52.663
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it about the firmware update that makes you want it?

03:03:53.424 --> 03:03:57.930
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they added a feature that should have been in there from the beginning.

03:03:58.351 --> 03:03:58.832
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is?

03:04:00.177 --> 03:04:09.322
[SPEAKER_05]: Use of the buttons in the home screen, which you would think would have been in there by default, but I don't know what the hell Sony was thinking.

03:04:09.582 --> 03:04:14.585
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, something the listeners may not remember about you from previous phone calls to the show, but you're blind, right?

03:04:15.045 --> 03:04:15.225
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

03:04:15.525 --> 03:04:19.708
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is something that is kind of important if you're trying to navigate.

03:04:19.728 --> 03:04:28.873
[SPEAKER_05]: That was literally, I was pretty stoked for the Vita when I heard about some of the games that were coming to it, especially like Mortal Kombat.

03:04:30.013 --> 03:04:33.717
[SPEAKER_03]: Um... Something like sound shapes, too, is awesome.

03:04:34.097 --> 03:04:42.844
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think even being, you know, with Blind, the way you kind of interact with the sounds and the fact that the sounds kind of drive the stage a little bit, I think you'd get a kick out of it.

03:04:43.265 --> 03:04:44.826
[SPEAKER_05]: Um... Okay, um...

03:04:47.441 --> 03:04:49.583
[SPEAKER_05]: How prevalent is the touchscreen in sound shapes?

03:04:49.623 --> 03:04:51.445
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really do a lot of research into it.

03:04:51.565 --> 03:04:52.366
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it all button-based?

03:04:52.386 --> 03:04:53.347
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to use it at all.

03:04:53.687 --> 03:04:56.470
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to design stages, you have to use it a little bit.

03:04:57.652 --> 03:04:58.432
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

03:04:58.452 --> 03:04:59.593
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have to check that one out.

03:04:59.954 --> 03:05:01.175
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you get a kick out of it.

03:05:01.676 --> 03:05:10.024
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also a big fan of the Rhythm Heaven slash Tengoku series on the GBA and DS.

03:05:11.644 --> 03:05:13.065
[SPEAKER_05]: and the Wii most recently.

03:05:13.565 --> 03:05:14.326
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are pretty awesome.

03:05:14.486 --> 03:05:21.010
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that maybe Sony realized, you know, oops, we're not really being accommodating for all people?

03:05:21.610 --> 03:05:29.014
[SPEAKER_05]: I know some people that did send letters to them about it and not all of them being blind.

03:05:29.054 --> 03:05:32.016
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard even a lot of sighted people bitching.

03:05:33.689 --> 03:05:34.990
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

03:05:50.603 --> 03:05:51.903
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty awesome.

03:05:52.023 --> 03:05:52.163
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

03:06:20.475 --> 03:06:23.228
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, Sterlok, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

03:06:24.233 --> 03:06:24.313
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

03:06:26.188 --> 03:06:27.729
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura has deployed her 20-sided die.

03:06:27.749 --> 03:06:28.030
[SPEAKER_05]: Laughter

03:06:53.047 --> 03:06:55.849
[SPEAKER_05]: She's currently attempting her saving throw.

03:06:58.450 --> 03:07:00.572
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and she didn't quite make it.

03:07:02.501 --> 03:07:05.422
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love it, but we'll have to see what's out there.

03:07:05.462 --> 03:07:16.524
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as Bobby's emphasizing in chat, we are kind of looking for shows that are already... Because we don't really want to bring on... Again, it's all about... People might have an idea and like, oh, I want to do this, I want to do this.

03:07:16.864 --> 03:07:19.725
[SPEAKER_03]: But then they don't realize how hard it really is to keep it going.

03:07:19.745 --> 03:07:23.186
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of work that goes into doing something.

03:07:23.226 --> 03:07:23.906
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I do a...

03:07:25.362 --> 03:07:27.784
[SPEAKER_05]: I do a little shameless plug.

03:07:27.824 --> 03:07:29.025
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

03:07:29.766 --> 03:07:33.388
[SPEAKER_05]: I do a little show on Thursday afternoons.

03:07:34.149 --> 03:07:34.469
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.

03:07:34.489 --> 03:07:35.130
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my Twitter.

03:07:37.392 --> 03:07:38.833
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I have Mario Sounds on my Twitter.

03:07:39.293 --> 03:07:39.753
[SPEAKER_05]: Giant nerd.

03:07:39.974 --> 03:07:41.235
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all right.

03:07:42.636 --> 03:07:43.737
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes, 3 to 5 Eastern.

03:07:46.943 --> 03:08:07.415
[SPEAKER_05]: On Thursdays I do a show on a station called Infinity Radio called Video Game Valhalla where I play two hours of video game music or stuff from the Angry Video Game Nerd or the Spoonie one, stuff like that.

03:08:07.695 --> 03:08:10.577
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically anything pertaining to video games.

03:08:10.697 --> 03:08:11.357
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet that's a good time.

03:08:11.377 --> 03:08:12.278
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a good announcer voice.

03:08:12.318 --> 03:08:12.558
[SPEAKER_03]: You do.

03:08:12.778 --> 03:08:13.819
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not just saying that.

03:08:13.879 --> 03:08:15.220
[SPEAKER_03]: So I bet that's a good time.

03:08:15.300 --> 03:08:17.001
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not up against any VOG programming.

03:08:17.061 --> 03:08:17.541
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're good.

03:08:18.402 --> 03:08:18.882
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's good.

03:08:19.923 --> 03:08:20.143
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

03:08:20.363 --> 03:08:22.164
[SPEAKER_03]: Sterlok, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show.

03:08:22.184 --> 03:08:23.165
[SPEAKER_03]: But thanks so much for your call.

03:08:23.625 --> 03:08:23.866
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

03:08:23.946 --> 03:08:24.306
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck.

03:08:24.486 --> 03:08:25.166
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that again?

03:08:25.226 --> 03:08:25.987
[SPEAKER_03]: Video Game Valhalla?

03:08:26.227 --> 03:08:29.829
[SPEAKER_05]: Video Game Valhalla on Infinity Radio.

03:08:29.909 --> 03:08:30.170
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

03:08:30.550 --> 03:08:30.830
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

03:08:31.310 --> 03:08:31.951
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out, folks.

03:08:32.291 --> 03:08:33.032
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one, Sterlok.

03:08:33.492 --> 03:08:33.752
[SPEAKER_05]: See ya.

03:08:33.972 --> 03:08:34.192
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

03:08:34.312 --> 03:08:34.552
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye-bye.

03:08:35.433 --> 03:08:37.054
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

03:08:37.094 --> 03:08:38.654
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys so much for calling in.

03:08:38.714 --> 03:08:42.156
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry if you didn't get through, although I've got to admit, it was a little light on the calls tonight.

03:08:42.176 --> 03:08:44.117
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I got almost everybody who was trying to get through.

03:08:44.137 --> 03:08:46.958
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I missed you, I may not have seen it, I'm very sorry.

03:08:47.038 --> 03:08:50.279
[SPEAKER_03]: Send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

03:08:50.599 --> 03:08:54.241
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me get back real quick to that tweet that I mentioned from Tigerclaw.

03:08:54.261 --> 03:08:55.381
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll close out with this tonight.

03:08:56.341 --> 03:09:01.804
[SPEAKER_03]: Dice, the Battlefield developer, afraid to release Battlefield 3 mod tools.

03:09:02.984 --> 03:09:04.705
[SPEAKER_03]: They said at GDC Europe

03:09:05.925 --> 03:09:10.507
[SPEAKER_03]: That apparently the studio was fearful of the implications of releasing the mod tools.

03:09:11.027 --> 03:09:24.093
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, they were quote, and this is a quote from Magnus Trottersen, who is the general manager of DICE, said quote, "...afraid of all the things that can come with releasing the code."

03:09:24.793 --> 03:09:46.484
[SPEAKER_03]: quote if we do mod support we want to do it really really well we are not ready to do this yet interesting i guess oh and also that if the mods come out they want console players in too i think that part's kind of interesting as well is that they don't want to just just let it be for pc they want console players to get in on the fun that's kind of nice pretty cool

03:09:47.877 --> 03:09:52.901
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a couple last-minute tweets here, so what the hell, I'll read them.

03:09:53.401 --> 03:09:57.323
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple tweets here from Ratchet1785 on Twitter.

03:09:57.343 --> 03:10:00.626
[SPEAKER_03]: They literally came in one minute ago, so I'll go ahead and read these.

03:10:00.646 --> 03:10:03.948
[SPEAKER_03]: Ratchet1785 asks, Are you guys excited about Borderlands 2?

03:10:04.588 --> 03:10:06.690
[SPEAKER_03]: First live show, by the way, and this is the best.

03:10:06.750 --> 03:10:07.650
[SPEAKER_03]: Three-year listener.

03:10:07.710 --> 03:10:08.771
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, howdy-doody.

03:10:09.051 --> 03:10:11.273
[SPEAKER_03]: And get your butt in chat next time if you're not already there.

03:10:11.313 --> 03:10:11.833
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see you there.

03:10:11.893 --> 03:10:15.536
[SPEAKER_03]: Live.VogNetwork.com Are you guys excited about Borderlands 2?

03:10:15.596 --> 03:10:15.776
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

03:10:16.416 --> 03:10:17.517
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even have to ask Loki.

03:10:19.328 --> 03:10:47.908
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if excited is the right word but I'm highly curious about Borderlands 2 because I liked what I played of Borderlands 1 I really need to play more of it so yeah I will check it out and I like some of the things they're doing with it I don't like that whole mess earlier this week about the whole girlfriend mode and all that crap that was going around but I'm just going to chalk a lot of that up to the media and Twitter and the internet kind of latching on to one thing and then running with it

03:10:48.428 --> 03:11:09.792
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's not going to affect the quality of the game I think at the end of the day the way that they're doing like an easy mode tree that sounds great to me that's not a girlfriend mode that's a me mode and I know there's a lot of people that feel the same way you know I don't mind playing the games on an easier mode to get the story and the experience I'm actually planning on playing through Mass Effect 3 on Insanity

03:11:11.209 --> 03:11:11.649
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck!

03:11:12.510 --> 03:11:13.271
[SPEAKER_03]: In god mode.

03:11:13.711 --> 03:11:14.191
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck?

03:11:14.331 --> 03:11:14.892
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

03:11:15.112 --> 03:11:16.913
[SPEAKER_03]: Well then, that's no fair.

03:11:17.333 --> 03:11:17.494
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

03:11:17.874 --> 03:11:24.098
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, and lastly, also tell your listeners I'm giving away a copy of Borderlands 2 on my gaming channel on YouTubes.

03:11:24.659 --> 03:11:25.559
[SPEAKER_03]: But then he didn't link it.

03:11:26.620 --> 03:11:29.142
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm gonna hope it's the same name, Ratchet1785.

03:11:29.202 --> 03:11:33.145
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's not the same name, I guess tune in next week.

03:11:33.626 --> 03:11:35.267
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's going to do it for tweets tonight.

03:11:35.587 --> 03:11:44.753
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitter.com slash OLR and that's about going to do it for the show tonight but not until we go around and get everybody's final thought.

03:11:45.593 --> 03:11:48.015
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, we'll start with you because you said there's no last minute stories, right?

03:11:48.535 --> 03:11:49.956
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh, I just don't care.

03:11:51.533 --> 03:11:51.933
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.

03:11:52.033 --> 03:11:53.274
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a three-hour show tonight.

03:11:53.294 --> 03:11:53.874
[SPEAKER_03]: We can wrap up.

03:11:54.755 --> 03:12:00.458
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, plus the podcast is even going to be a little longer because, thankfully, we have the Darksiders 2 song in there.

03:12:00.518 --> 03:12:02.360
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we're good to wrap up.

03:12:02.560 --> 03:12:04.561
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

03:12:04.681 --> 03:12:08.943
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just going to say retweet that thing that I tweeted about Evilot.

03:12:09.864 --> 03:12:15.930
[SPEAKER_11]: They're having a contest on their site, and whoever gets the most retweets gets a picture drawn by one of the artists.

03:12:16.130 --> 03:12:22.716
[SPEAKER_11]: And she does really kick-ass art, so I would like a picture because she does pixel art and it looks fucking awesome.

03:12:22.736 --> 03:12:23.797
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so you need a retweet.

03:12:23.957 --> 03:12:25.599
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I need a retweet.

03:12:25.679 --> 03:12:28.201
[SPEAKER_11]: I retweeted, or I sent it out, and I can't...

03:12:29.386 --> 03:12:36.508
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't figure out how to, like, and I did it once, because obviously I copied it in the chat room, but I can't remember how I got the direct link to that tweet.

03:12:36.648 --> 03:12:44.550
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, you click on, if you go to your actual Twitter page, I think there's a way to see details, or detailed tweet or something like that.

03:12:44.570 --> 03:12:44.911
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe, okay.

03:12:44.951 --> 03:12:51.933
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, anyways, it's on my Twitter, at LokiOLR, and just retweeted, you know, it's the one talking about Evil Eye.

03:12:51.973 --> 03:12:55.374
[SPEAKER_11]: It's done by FoodieMonster, or he's the animator on it.

03:12:55.394 --> 03:12:56.794
[SPEAKER_11]: I still would like to know where FoodieMonster went.

03:12:57.915 --> 03:12:58.957
[SPEAKER_03]: Where have you been, FootyMonster?

03:12:59.557 --> 03:12:59.978
[SPEAKER_03]: Come back to OLR.

03:12:59.998 --> 03:13:08.889
[SPEAKER_11]: It's probably busy, but seriously, you should go back and even... I mean, it looks like a pretty cool game, and they're under halfway there right now.

03:13:08.909 --> 03:13:09.771
[SPEAKER_11]: They're only looking for 10 grand.

03:13:10.336 --> 03:13:13.138
[SPEAKER_03]: I will retweet from the OLR account my personal account just for you.

03:13:13.298 --> 03:13:14.399
[SPEAKER_11]: I will appreciate that.

03:13:14.679 --> 03:13:15.520
[SPEAKER_11]: And the Horde House account.

03:13:15.840 --> 03:13:21.324
[SPEAKER_11]: If anybody else can do it, that'd be awesome because right now I'm the only one who retweets on there.

03:13:21.385 --> 03:13:25.087
[SPEAKER_11]: But I would like to, you know... I want a picture.

03:13:25.127 --> 03:13:25.968
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks awesome.

03:13:26.188 --> 03:13:26.709
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously.

03:13:26.989 --> 03:13:27.489
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.

03:13:28.030 --> 03:13:29.491
[SPEAKER_11]: And you should go back to the game because it's awesome.

03:13:29.531 --> 03:13:30.952
[SPEAKER_03]: I backed it, so check it out.

03:13:31.352 --> 03:13:32.793
[SPEAKER_03]: Good deal.

03:13:33.314 --> 03:13:34.334
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought tonight.

03:13:34.394 --> 03:13:35.735
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought tonight is...

03:13:37.907 --> 03:13:40.087
[SPEAKER_03]: Sleep, Soon, CZZ.

03:13:40.788 --> 03:13:41.908
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

03:13:42.828 --> 03:13:49.969
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just peeking at Tumblr for a second, and someone posted a GIF of someone dying during an MRI.

03:13:49.989 --> 03:13:52.730
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, why would you put that on the internets?

03:13:53.350 --> 03:13:53.890
[SPEAKER_06]: Gross.

03:13:54.270 --> 03:13:58.531
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, it's all just a scam, but it says that you're... I'll just read what it says.

03:13:58.591 --> 03:14:00.552
[SPEAKER_06]: This is someone dying while having an MRI scan.

03:14:00.572 --> 03:14:05.453
[SPEAKER_06]: Before you die, your brain releases tons and tons of endorphins that make you feel a range of emotions.

03:14:06.113 --> 03:14:06.933
[SPEAKER_06]: Tragically beautiful.

03:14:09.880 --> 03:14:12.021
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't help it.

03:14:12.041 --> 03:14:13.902
[SPEAKER_03]: Since I don't have the soundboard up.

03:14:13.962 --> 03:14:14.943
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Debbie Downer.

03:14:15.763 --> 03:14:17.444
[SPEAKER_06]: But it means when you die, you die happy.

03:14:18.485 --> 03:14:19.605
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

03:14:19.745 --> 03:14:20.306
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

03:14:20.546 --> 03:14:23.688
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't you tell a booby joke or something to end the show on a happy note?

03:14:23.728 --> 03:14:24.428
[SPEAKER_06]: They have blue feet.

03:14:28.016 --> 03:14:29.337
[SPEAKER_03]: More positive energy.

03:14:29.357 --> 03:14:30.819
[SPEAKER_06]: What did the boobie say to the tit?

03:14:32.601 --> 03:14:33.002
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

03:14:33.462 --> 03:14:35.585
[SPEAKER_03]: What did the boobie say to the tit, DarkSakura?

03:14:35.725 --> 03:14:36.045
[SPEAKER_03]: Chirp.

03:14:38.989 --> 03:14:39.469
[SPEAKER_03]: They're birds.

03:14:44.093 --> 03:14:44.733
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

03:14:44.854 --> 03:14:45.774
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's going to do it.

03:14:45.994 --> 03:14:46.334
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

03:14:46.415 --> 03:14:47.375
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where we needed to end on.

03:14:47.795 --> 03:14:50.637
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you everybody for listening to another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

03:14:50.657 --> 03:14:51.338

03:15:09.930 --> 03:15:10.650
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be a dick.

03:15:11.411 --> 03:15:11.891
[SPEAKER_03]: See you next time.

03:15:12.907 --> 03:15:15.929
