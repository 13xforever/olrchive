19000	22000	A company requests its game be pulled from store shelves
22000	27000	And are 90% of PC game installs pirated copies?

60000	62000	This is episode number 471
62000	64000	For this August 26th, 2012
64000	66000	My name is Rob Roberts
66000	68000	And I'll be joining you over the next few hours
68000	70000	To talk about what is going on with the game industry
70000	72000	With my friends
72000	74000	Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers
74000	75000	Hi
75000	76000	How are you?
76000	78000	I feel vaguely fit
78000	79000	You feel fit?
79000	80000	Vaguely
80000	82000	You feel pretty and witty and...
82000	84000	Hey
84000	86000	Well I don't know, everyone a little gay
89000	91000	That's good, it's good to feel healthy
91000	93000	Cause I've had days where I feel healthy
93000	95000	And I've had days where I feel fat
95000	97000	You know, and sometimes a fat day is good too
97000	100000	Once in a while, but healthy is a good feeling too
100000	102000	Well it was just like
102000	105000	My intention is to walk a few days each week
105000	107000	And I decided to go walking
107000	110000	But I don't know if I've said it on the show before
110000	112000	But I wear Vibram Five Fingers
112000	113000	Which are like the toe shoes
113000	115000	You wear the glove shoes
115000	117000	They're awesome
117000	119000	You make your feet look like hands
119000	121000	They're creepy
121000	124000	Well but it makes your feet walk how you're supposed to walk
124000	126000	It makes you look like Spiderman
126000	128000	Well it's how people are supposed to walk is the thing
128000	130000	Is that our, not to go too deep into it
130000	132000	But our modern tennis shoes
132000	134000	Have changed the way people walk for the worse
134000	137000	You know, that's where a lot of injuries come about
137000	140000	And I'm really getting back to the barefoot walking thing
140000	142000	Like hands, they're...
142000	144000	Sorry, sorry for the echo
144000	146000	And I really love them
146000	148000	But it makes me think more and more that
148000	150000	Humanity is not meant to walk on concrete
150000	153000	Concrete is terrible, terrible, terrible stuff
153000	157000	And so my feet did not hurt until I walked on concrete
157000	159000	When I walked on the grass, no more hurt
159000	161000	But it was a good walk
161000	162000	It was a good walk
162000	164000	I got outside
164000	166000	Outside
166000	167000	Going outside is good
167000	169000	Everybody should put down the controller or the keyboard
169000	170000	And go outside once in a while
170000	171000	However
171000	172000	What?
172000	174000	I was listening to the Mass Effect soundtrack
174000	176000	That's how you can make your worlds collide
176000	177000	There you go
177000	179000	Alright, by the way, I apologize
179000	182000	One of the perks about listening live to Orange Launch Radio
182000	184000	Is that you can check into the show live
184000	185000	The check-ins are now up
185000	187000	I forgot to do that because I was sidetracked
187000	188000	During the pre-show
188000	191000	And I literally sat down seconds before
191000	192000	I picked up the microphone and went live
192000	194000	So the check-ins are now up
194000	195000	There you go
195000	196000	For those of you listening on the podcast
196000	197000	You can also check in
197000	199000	Just listen for a little noise
199000	201000	The little victory sound
201000	203000	And then it'll tell you the passphrase
203000	205000	It is somewhere in the show
205000	206000	We have to make sure you're listening to it
206000	208000	So it's somewhere different in the show every week
208000	210000	Anyhow, also say hello to
210000	211000	What?
211000	213000	Damn it, that song is in my head now
213000	214000	The song from An American Tail
214000	216000	That's somewhere out there
216000	218000	Is that what the check-in noise sounds like?
218000	220000	No, when you said somewhere
220000	221000	I was like
221000	223000	That song is stuck in my head
223000	225000	I haven't thought of that song in years
225000	226000	Damn it, Rob
226000	228000	I'm sorry
228000	229000	I don't know what to tell you
229000	235000	I was gonna play this really quick here
235000	236000	If I can find it here
236000	238000	I don't know if you've heard this, Darkstalker
238000	240000	I know you don't listen really back to the podcast
240000	241000	Because you're on it
241000	242000	So you don't have to
242000	244000	But this is a little noise
244000	246000	Now, this is not the actual noise
246000	247000	But this is it
247000	250000	Isn't that kind of catchy, right?
250000	251000	Yeah
251000	253000	Now that's gonna get stuck in your head right there
253000	255000	That's a little Bobby Black Wolf original right there
255000	260000	Um, it's like, I have an idea
260000	261000	Okay
261000	263000	Let's introduce Loki
263000	265000	Techmaster Loki is here tonight too
265000	266000	Hi
266000	267000	How are you doing, Loki?
267000	268000	I'm full now
268000	269000	You're full?
269000	270000	Yeah, because I
270000	271000	Full of rage
271000	272000	I know
272000	278000	I bought one of the Memphis barbecue burgers over at Carl's Jr. Hardee's
278000	281000	That is drenched in barbecue sauce
281000	283000	I normally get the single
283000	284000	And the single is normally enough
284000	286000	I haven't eaten really today
286000	288000	So I was like, okay, I'll go with the $6 burger
288000	290000	I really should have just stuck with the single
290000	291000	The single is enough
291000	293000	But it's delicious
293000	295000	And what makes it delicious is the fact that it combines
295000	297000	Not only a cheeseburger, but pulled pork
297000	299000	So you've got barbecued pulled pork
299000	302000	And a cheeseburger with more barbecue sauce on it
302000	304000	And onion rings
304000	306000	It's fantastic
306000	307000	Delicious
307000	309000	I like their Western burger
309000	310000	Western bacon or whatever
310000	311000	Yeah, that's not really what I get
311000	313000	But remember we just had this discussion about healthy days
313000	314000	And fat days
314000	317000	If I have one of those, I'm definitely having a fat day
317000	318000	Because they are not good for you
318000	319000	That's how I discovered it
319000	322000	Because I normally don't go to Carl's Jr. that much
322000	325000	Because it's further away from my work than normal
325000	327000	The other fast food places
327000	330000	So I was like, I'm tired of eating McDonald's or Burger King
330000	332000	I'm just going to go to Carl's Jr. today
332000	334000	And so I went there to get the Double Western
334000	336000	And I saw that they had this burger
336000	338000	I'm like, hey, I like pulled pork
338000	340000	I'm going to get a single
340000	341000	Because I'm not that hungry
341000	342000	And it was delicious
342000	345000	You know, I swear I don't have delusions or anything
345000	347000	That our show is that big in the scope of things
347000	349000	We don't have a whole ton of ton of listeners
349000	351000	Though we do love the family we have
351000	354000	That comes participates with us live in the podcast
354000	358000	But it would be great if somebody deemed our audience
358000	360000	Large enough to get a food sponsorship
360000	363000	With as much as we talk up the different foods
363000	368000	We need to start censoring all the food titles
368000	372000	We're going to go get yogurt after the show at
372000	376000	No, instead what you do is
376000	378000	Instead of doing the beep
378000	380000	You add like a sound file that says nom
380000	382000	So every time you talk about
382000	384000	Yeah, I totally had that burger at nom nom nom nom
384000	388000	Get the little kitty nom nom nom
388000	390000	Yeah, but then you're talking about editing
390000	393000	That's why I like to do live radio
393000	395000	Because it doesn't involve editing
395000	396000	If you haven't noticed
396000	397000	I also like to do live radio
397000	398000	Because we have the chat room
398000	401000	At live.vognetwork.com
401000	403000	And Bobby, in reference to me playing the theme
403000	405000	A little bit before said
405000	407000	Now people are going to think that the check-ins
407000	408000	Are happening that early
408000	409000	Well, gotcha
409000	411000	I just want to make sure everybody was paying attention
411000	413000	So like the people that just
413000	415000	The people that are kind of just doing data entry
415000	418000	In the background and zoning out and all that
418000	421000	Now that I have your attention
421000	424000	Watermelons
424000	427000	Anyway, let's see, also
427000	429000	What are the other comments in chat
429000	431000	Oh, Tigerclaw said you can use that sound
431000	433000	When there's breaking news
433000	435000	But then we can't jack the NBC breaking news theme
435000	437000	Which is so epic
437000	438000	It is epic
438000	440000	You know, as much as people hate NBC
440000	442000	After the Olympics and all that crap
442000	443000	You have to admit
443000	445000	NBC gets some epic fucking music
445000	446000	For their presentations
446000	448000	Like, you know, the Olympic theme
448000	449000	That shit is epic
449000	451000	And I realize John Williams did that
451000	452000	Not some NBC dude
452000	453000	I played that in high school band
453000	455000	And didn't you feel epic?
455000	457000	We can start stealing
457000	458000	Especially since I played saxophone
458000	459000	And got the little
459000	460000	You know
460000	462000	We can start stealing the Game of Thrones theme
462000	464000	I mean, that's pretty epic too
464000	465000	Or like, you know
465000	467000	No chair of swords allowed
467000	469000	But the theme's awesome, okay
469000	470000	Separate from the whole
470000	471000	If you want awesome
471000	473000	We should just use the Xena theme
473000	475000	Yeah
477000	480000	No, that's if we want the show to have lesbian undertones
480000	482000	I have no problem with this
482000	484000	Maybe in a future week
484000	486000	How do you have lesbian undertones
486000	488000	When there's two men and a woman?
488000	489000	I'm not sure how that works
489000	490000	She's double lesbian
490000	492000	I like boobs too
493000	495000	You'll have to like your own boobs though
495000	497000	Unless we get some lady callers later
497000	499000	Which is always a distinct possibility
499000	501000	When we take live calls from our
501000	503000	Should I ask everyone about their boobs?
503000	505000	Do you want to have booby chat tonight with the callers?
505000	506000	No, thank you
506000	508000	I don't know if any of our women
508000	510000	Would call in to do booby chat
510000	512000	Well, Sil would totally do it
512000	514000	But the show's on too late for her
514000	516000	Because she's on the other side of the pond
516000	518000	And they're eight hours ahead of us
518000	520000	If you have to stay up anywhere in the UK
520000	521000	Really, no matter where you're at
521000	522000	Britain, Scotland, Ireland
522000	524000	I know we have listeners in all those places
524000	526000	And what time is the show live here?
526000	527000	I miss our Swede
527000	528000	2 AM
528000	529000	I miss our Swedes
529000	531000	Yeah, we had a couple folks in Sweden
531000	533000	I did see, I don't know if you've looked at email
533000	535000	But we do have an email from Belgium tonight
535000	536000	I love Belgium!
536000	537000	Me too
537000	539000	I love waffles
539000	541000	Such an ignorant statement
541000	543000	There is so much more to Belgium than just waffles
543000	545000	There is not, that is not an ignorant statement
545000	547000	I love waffles, okay?
547000	549000	It just reminded me
549000	551000	There's nothing, alright
551000	553000	Belgium also has wonderful chocolate
553000	555000	Alright, usually we do a kickoff topic at the start
555000	556000	Beer
556000	558000	Usually we do a kickoff topic at the start of the show
558000	561000	I actually don't have a whole lot tonight
561000	562000	Beer
562000	563000	What?
563000	564000	Beer
564000	565000	It should be beer
565000	566000	I want to ask this question
566000	568000	We have a long weekend next weekend
568000	572000	And it's very likely we probably won't end up doing OLR next weekend
572000	574000	We'll have to talk about that during the break tonight
574000	577000	But Bobby's not going to be here
577000	579000	DragonCon's going on next weekend
579000	581000	Because a lot of the cool kids at VOG Network
581000	584000	Like Travis and Brad from Pod Culture
584000	586000	And some of the dudes from Critical Myth and all them
586000	589000	They're all going to DragonCon
589000	591000	In Atlanta
591000	593000	That is going on
593000	595000	Penny Arcade Expo is also going on at the same time
595000	597000	And it's Labor Day weekend
597000	599000	So I don't know, we may take the weekend off to
599000	601000	You know, just chill
601000	603000	And sit around and play video games
603000	604000	And Pinkberry
604000	605000	And I'm wondering
605000	606000	And Pinkberry
606000	608000	I'm wondering if there's any video games
608000	610000	You really need to catch up on
610000	612000	That if we have a three day weekend
612000	614000	To just sit in your underwear on the couch
614000	616000	With a giant
616000	619000	What is that, how did Grandpa describe it on Horde House
619000	620000	The other show
620000	623000	I'm sitting there in my boxers in my big thing of Pinkberry
623000	625000	Just playing video games or whatever
625000	628000	What video games do you need to be catching up on right now
628000	630000	Because we're about to enter the holiday season
630000	632000	And a shit ton of new games
632000	634000	What games do you want to spend your Labor Day weekend
634000	636000	Catching up on
636000	638000	I propose to my husband of marathoning
638000	640000	Super Mario World
640000	642000	Super Mario World
642000	644000	However, I also just proposed to Becky
644000	646000	Of marathoning Mass Effect 2 on Saturday
646000	647000	You do that anyway
647000	649000	No, I play Mass Effect 3 for me
649000	651000	Which means I have to finish it
651000	653000	Before we finish Mass Effect 2 for her
653000	657000	So that I can play through Mass Effect 3 while she watches
657000	659000	You know what would be fun, actually you should try this
659000	661000	Jamie is
661000	664000	Marathoning ROM hacks for Mario Brothers
664000	665000	That would be awesome
665000	667000	I would scream so much
667000	670000	Well not necessarily the ones that are insanely hard
670000	671000	But just the new ones
671000	673000	They have some really good ROM hacks
673000	675000	That and Link to the Past has some really good ROM hacks
675000	676000	I'm like
676000	678000	I kind of want to play those because it's different
678000	681000	It's like going into Link to the Past
681000	683000	For the first time again
683000	686000	And it's kind of cool, that sounds really cool to me
686000	690000	Except the whole thing is actually breaking out the systems
690000	691000	And playing
691000	694000	The other thing that we had, we actually just watched a whole
694000	697000	Dan and I watched a whole play through of Vampire Killer on MSX
697000	701000	Which came out after the Castlevania that we got on the NES
701000	707000	But it sort of inspired me to want to actually play through Dracula X again
707000	710000	It sort of sounded like a classic gaming weekend
710000	712000	Sounds like fun
712000	713000	Plus Mass Effect
713000	717000	Maybe it would also be a fun weekend to go out to the flea markets around
717000	719000	And try to find some more classic games
719000	720000	Let's do it
720000	721000	And then
721000	722000	If it's not 105
722000	723000	And then
723000	724000	No and then
724000	725000	And then
725000	726000	No and then
726000	727000	Farmers Market
727000	728000	No and then
728000	729000	Mexican Candy
729000	730000	Loki got it
730000	732000	Dude, where's my car?
732000	733000	Loki
733000	735000	What do you need to catch up on over the long weekend?
735000	741000	Honestly, what I've been trying to do is stop doing modding stuff
741000	745000	Because I have people that ask me for Grand Theft Auto mod stuff
745000	748000	They're like, I can't port my map mods over, can you do it for me?
748000	751000	I'm like, so waste a whole fucking week doing that shit
751000	752000	And it just gets so tiring
752000	754000	Because I'm like, I don't want to do this
754000	757000	But yet for some stupid reason they keep saying yes, I'll do it for you
757000	761000	So I'd like to just not do that and actually play games
761000	766000	But at the same time, I don't really know what games I'd want to play
766000	769000	I want to play Minecraft on 360 with other people
769000	771000	But there's no one on
771000	773000	There's a way to burn an entire weekend
773000	775000	Seriously, but there's nobody to play with
775000	776000	That's the thing
776000	779000	Although I do have one of the people that's on my friends list
779000	782000	He keeps wanting to play, but it's always when I'm on break at work
782000	784000	I'm like, dude, I can't play with you right now
784000	787000	Because I'm going to have like five minutes and that's it
787000	789000	Because I'll be on my 360 during break
789000	792000	But there's no one to play with
792000	794000	I really wish that Minecraft on the 360
794000	797000	Had an option to randomly connect you to a server
797000	800000	That has, okay, allow strangers to connect
800000	801000	Or something like that
801000	805000	Or have that option where I can allow strangers to connect to my server
805000	809000	Granted, you run the risk of someone going through and griefing and stuff
809000	811000	But you can always ban them
811000	813000	And I would just kind of like that
813000	815000	So I'd be able to play with random people
815000	817000	And actually get a multiplayer game going
817000	819000	It's kind of boring with just one or two people
819000	822000	Because we've been playing, we actually started yet another world
824000	827000	And we actually picked the tutorial world this time
827000	828000	Which is kind of fun
828000	830000	Because it made it a little more interesting
830000	833000	Because there's actual things built in, little hidden things to find
833000	836000	And you can, you know, you didn't have to worry about right away
836000	839000	Okay, I need to find stuff to make sticky pistons
839000	841000	Oh, I'll just steal some out of the stuff that's already built
841000	842000	Which is kind of cool
842000	844000	Or hey, you know, I need to go find some diamonds
844000	846000	So they can make some diamond armor and stuff
846000	848000	Oh wait, I know where the hidden thing is
848000	849000	Where there's some diamond stuff
849000	850000	So that's kind of cool
850000	852000	Or I'm gonna need some wood
852000	854000	So I'm gonna just tear down this house instead of those already built
854000	856000	And so that was kind of fun
856000	857000	For a little bit
857000	858000	And then it got boring again
858000	859000	And that's the problem
859000	862000	It's just, it's so far behind
862000	865000	The PC version that it's kind of boring
865000	869000	Whereas like I'm reading about like the cool PC stuff that they're adding now
869000	872000	And like the kind of snapshots for each week
872000	874000	And it sounds pretty awesome
874000	876000	Like they're adding all this new stuff
876000	879000	Like new monsters that look really fucking hard to kill
879000	881000	I mean that would be really cool in the 360 version
881000	883000	But it's just not there
883000	886000	So I guess I have to start playing the PC version since I bought it
886000	887000	That would be kind of fun
887000	888000	Maybe I should do that
888000	891000	But once again, I need people to play with
891000	894000	And, you know, I don't want to play with random strangers
894000	897000	Are you upset that I haven't been signing onto Xbox lately?
897000	898000	Is that what this is all about?
898000	899000	Well just everybody
899000	900000	No one is
900000	901000	I mean like seriously, I can't
901000	903000	I launch Minecraft almost every single day
903000	905000	There's no one on, ever
905000	906000	So
906000	908000	That reminds me of WoW
908000	910000	But yeah, I mean like that
910000	913000	That's going to start picking up real soon though with the expansion
913000	914000	I mean if I want to go
914000	916000	I'm not really trying to get into any games right now
916000	918000	Like any, start anything new
918000	921000	Because Borderlands 2 is coming out
921000	924000	And I know that's going to be, you know, big time drain right there
924000	926000	That'll probably be the one game I play
926000	929000	Until Call of Duty Black Ops 2 I think
929000	932000	Let's go to some comments from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
932000	933000	SSJ100Matt says
933000	935000	I know what Loki can do during the break
935000	937000	Update the OLR PSP site
937000	939000	That's not going to happen
939000	941000	But much like, so much like
941000	943000	It's time to start on the PSV
943000	945000	OLRPSV.com that doesn't exist yet
945000	946000	But
946000	947000	I don't want to do that
947000	948000	I know
948000	949000	No one cares anymore
949000	951000	OLR3DS.com not happening
951000	952000	No
952000	953000	OLRWEU.com
953000	954000	See the problem is
954000	956000	I mean now all these things have web browsers
956000	958000	And hopefully they all support HTML5
958000	960000	And so that's not even an issue anymore
960000	961000	You can just go to our site
961000	963000	At vognetwork.com and
963000	965000	Just listen
965000	967000	Without having to, you know
967000	969000	One thing we do need to look into doing
969000	971000	Though at some point is
971000	973000	Remaking the OLR.com site
973000	975000	Because now we kind of have
975000	977000	A lot of our forum resources
977000	979000	And community resources are pouring in
979000	981000	Trying to pool together with the other shows
981000	983000	To make vognetwork.com bigger
983000	985000	OLR.com was probably more about us
985000	987000	And our history and our shows and so forth
987000	989000	So it would be fun to have something for that
989000	990000	You know
990000	992000	It would, to me, I mean
992000	994000	I think it would be kind of cool like how we
994000	996000	Had on the all games
996000	998000	While back where it was just
998000	1000000	A section of the website, it's like okay
1000000	1002000	Here's the Orange Launch Radio section, like there's a section
1002000	1004000	For each show and just have it linked to that
1004000	1006000	And just, you know, make something cool there
1006000	1008000	On our own site, on VoG
1008000	1010000	So we don't have to like, because we have
1010000	1012000	Forums already, you know, the forums
1012000	1014000	And the Orange Launch site are kind of dead
1014000	1015000	I mean we can just
1015000	1017000	They're technically supposed to be closed by now
1017000	1019000	Because we're going to fold them into the VoG network
1019000	1021000	So that's what I'm saying, it's like
1021000	1023000	Just kind of erase the site
1023000	1025000	And just, because we were already kind of
1025000	1027000	Doing everything that we were doing on that site
1027000	1029000	Anyways, on VoG
1029000	1031000	So just kind of move it over
1031000	1033000	If you have ideas, we'd love to hear a mailbag
1033000	1035000	At orangelaungeradio.com
1035000	1037000	And some of the folks in chat room were talking about apps
1037000	1039000	And so forth
1039000	1041000	I have to learn how to program
1041000	1043000	As soon as I learn how to make apps, I know somebody
1043000	1045000	That makes apps, but they have other priorities
1045000	1047000	I almost
1047000	1049000	Signed up for
1049000	1051000	Another Kickstarter that had
1051000	1053000	A thing on how to make apps
1053000	1055000	And it looked really cool, but I'm like
1055000	1057000	Am I really going to sit here and do this?
1057000	1059000	You're addicted to Kickstarter
1059000	1061000	Alright, let me get some other answers here
1061000	1063000	That one took us on a tangent
1063000	1065000	How about Locopoco, which I love that name
1065000	1067000	Because it's like Locoroco's cousin
1067000	1069000	Locopoco says, I need to catch up on
1069000	1071000	Folklore, Resonance of Fate
1071000	1073000	And Valkyria Chronicles, those are all excellent choices
1073000	1075000	Valkyria Chronicles is one of my
1075000	1077000	Personal ones too, we've had that on PS3
1077000	1079000	I don't know how long, and I've yet to make a lot of progress
1079000	1081000	In that game, but it's really fun
1081000	1083000	Tigerclaw says, in reality
1083000	1085000	Sky just wants to go to Disneyland again
1085000	1087000	LOL, in regards to the week off
1087000	1089000	A, if I was going to Disneyland, I would not
1089000	1091000	Do it on Labor Day weekend, because that would be a mad house
1091000	1093000	B, I was actually
1093000	1095000	Supposed to be there tonight, I was originally
1095000	1097000	Planning a trip that would have had
1097000	1099000	Alan and I there, well we would have been driving
1099000	1101000	Tonight, I would have not been at the show
1101000	1103000	Tonight, been there Monday, Tuesday, but
1103000	1105000	We had to cancel that
1105000	1107000	Rob, not and I, and me
1107000	1109000	It's an object
1109000	1111000	No one Kern, alright
1111000	1113000	Moving on
1113000	1115000	Let's see, oh, and lastly
1115000	1117000	In reference to the mental image
1117000	1119000	I put in all your heads earlier
1119000	1121000	VxjasonxV in our chat room says
1121000	1123000	Oh, and now that underwear is involved
1123000	1125000	Video live stream
1125000	1127000	Y'all are perverts
1127000	1129000	I would love to do a live stream
1129000	1131000	Not of that, of the games
1131000	1133000	It's technology
1133000	1135000	Well, I do want to do
1135000	1137000	Live streaming stuff, I have
1137000	1139000	About two or three
1139000	1141000	Capture cards, capture devices
1141000	1143000	Set that crap up over here, we can do that
1143000	1145000	It's just, it's a little bit
1145000	1147000	More complicated, like I always watch
1147000	1149000	The playthroughs like
1149000	1151000	Freddy Wong, they've been doing
1151000	1153000	They've been doing a land game
1153000	1155000	On PC, Minecraft, and it looks so much
1155000	1157000	Fun, playing with other people
1157000	1159000	It's just like, okay, everybody gets one life
1159000	1161000	And we're just gonna work together
1161000	1163000	And we're gonna do this stuff and then they just kind of
1163000	1165000	Film it and edit it together and it looks fun
1165000	1167000	I'm like, I just want to do that
1167000	1169000	I want to play with those people
1169000	1171000	I did not, you got me sidetracked
1171000	1173000	Though, because in reference to the
1173000	1175000	Comment that Jason made, now that underwear
1175000	1177000	Is involved, video live stream, I
1177000	1179000	Had the chance to play my favorite Tyra Banks
1179000	1199000	Clip that I haven't played on the show in years
1199000	1201000	You know, that's gonna be my Labor Day
1201000	1203000	Weekend right there, panty party
1203000	1205000	You know, my wife, ever since
1205000	1207000	The passing of Whitney Houston has kind of
1207000	1209000	Latched on to Tyra Banks instead
1209000	1211000	I've noticed
1211000	1213000	Kind of like
1213000	1215000	Kind of observing the
1215000	1217000	Train wreck that's happening, cause you know
1217000	1219000	Whitney Houston, well she used to like
1219000	1221000	Watching Whitney Houston's Facebook page
1221000	1223000	Because there's a lot of stupid people that comment on there
1223000	1225000	But Tyra's page
1225000	1227000	Tyra comments on
1227000	1229000	Post a lot of really stupid things
1229000	1231000	And it's funny
1231000	1233000	I mean, this has absolutely nothing to do with
1233000	1235000	Video games, but this is kind of a game
1235000	1237000	In itself, and it has to do with Facebook
1237000	1239000	Which is, you know, big for gaming, right?
1239000	1241000	This is hilarious
1241000	1243000	Go to various fast food
1243000	1245000	And chain restaurants
1245000	1247000	And just go to the thing that lets you see
1247000	1249000	What everybody's posting on there
1249000	1251000	And I'm not even talking like the controversial shit
1251000	1253000	Like Chick-fil-A, like go on
1253000	1255000	Facebook and look up like the Olive Gardens
1255000	1257000	Page, Red Lobster
1257000	1259000	Applebee's
1259000	1261000	You will see some amazing
1261000	1263000	Shit that people post on those
1263000	1265000	Pages, everywhere from
1265000	1267000	Complaints about a particular restaurant
1267000	1269000	To, you know, somebody
1269000	1271000	Making a post like
1271000	1273000	So-and-so just took me here to Applebee's
1273000	1275000	For my anniversary, I'm so excited
1275000	1277000	There's a picture of them smiling like
1277000	1279000	Cause people don't understand privacy
1279000	1281000	Controls
1281000	1283000	That just makes me think of a line from one of my favorite
1283000	1285000	Comics, Henry Cho, who's not related
1285000	1287000	To Margaret Cho, although he is Korean
1287000	1289000	Born in Tennessee
1289000	1291000	Saying, talking about his
1291000	1293000	Brother-in-law from Arab
1293000	1295000	Alabama
1295000	1297000	Good times
1297000	1299000	We just got a new Italian restaurant
1299000	1301000	It ain't no Olive Garden
1301000	1303000	I can't help but be reminded
1303000	1305000	Of that 86 year old
1305000	1307000	Lady or whatever that reviewed restaurants
1307000	1309000	For the local paper and she wrote that huge review
1309000	1311000	About the Olive Garden
1311000	1313000	I don't know where that, she was like in Montana
1313000	1315000	Or maybe Wisconsin, one of those northern states
1315000	1317000	And was writing about the local Olive Garden
1317000	1319000	That shit was hilarious
1319000	1321000	With the buttery breadsticks
1323000	1325000	Alright, alright, quickly
1325000	1327000	My weekend, my plans
1327000	1329000	For the weekend, I think it would be really fun
1329000	1331000	To do an epic Civ 5
1331000	1333000	Match that goes all weekend
1333000	1335000	Long, but I don't know if I can find
1335000	1337000	Any other suckers that would buy into that
1337000	1339000	And there's someone who plays on Xbox, but I don't think he plays online
1339000	1341000	Yeah, but that's
1341000	1343000	The Xbox one is different, cause that's the Civ
1343000	1345000	Revolution and those games can go a lot faster
1345000	1347000	You can do one of those in a night, but I'm talking like
1347000	1349000	Civilization 5 epic mode
1349000	1351000	Although that would, that game would take
1351000	1353000	Like months to finish, but you could even
1353000	1355000	Do just even a normal game
1355000	1357000	Takes forever in Civilization 5
1357000	1359000	That would be fun
1359000	1361000	DayZ would be fun too, once, like
1361000	1363000	I guess that's going back to games
1363000	1365000	That would be fun to do like a live stream of
1365000	1367000	Actually, live streaming PC games might
1367000	1369000	Well, that might be, it's still difficult
1369000	1371000	But yeah, DayZ would be fun
1371000	1373000	Hey, oh my god, zombies
1373000	1375000	Here we go
1375000	1377000	Crazy person
1377000	1379000	The other game I really need to catch up on is
1379000	1381000	Borderlands
1381000	1383000	But let's be real
1383000	1385000	There's so much happening on Tuesday between
1385000	1387000	The official launch of Guild Wars 2
1387000	1389000	The patch in Warcraft
1389000	1391000	Rock Band Blitz
1391000	1393000	Mass Effect 3 DLC
1393000	1395000	There's no way I'm playing catch up over the weekend
1395000	1397000	Cause I have to play everything that came out on Tuesday
1397000	1399000	That's the problem
1399000	1401000	You don't really need to play through Borderlands 1 anyways
1401000	1403000	Because they just kinda, all they have
1403000	1405000	The characters have cameos
1405000	1407000	And that's about it, but
1407000	1409000	I just wanna play it cause I was having fun with it
1409000	1411000	And I just stopped because of my MMOs
1411000	1413000	And other games I was playing
1413000	1415000	Oh yeah, Alan has it too
1415000	1417000	There you go
1417000	1419000	Bobby's the one to play too
1419000	1421000	There we go, the foursome
1421000	1425000	Alright, let's talk about our actual gaming weeks
1425000	1427000	The stuff we have been playing this week
1427000	1429000	More current stuff, yeah
1429000	1431000	Can I say one more thing about the week in general
1431000	1433000	Of course
1433000	1435000	I did a good deed this weekend
1435000	1437000	We rescued a kitten from the dumpster
1437000	1439000	Outside my synagogue
1439000	1441000	Now, before people start crying
1441000	1443000	You found out nobody left the cat in the dumpster
1443000	1445000	He was feral
1445000	1447000	Little faith in humanity restored
1447000	1449000	Yeah, he was feral
1449000	1451000	He fell in looking for food
1451000	1453000	I sat him in my lap, he clawed the crap out of me
1453000	1455000	And then calmed down
1455000	1457000	Got him some water, got him some food
1457000	1459000	A nice lady downtown
1459000	1461000	He was taken care of by a lady downtown
1461000	1463000	And he's going to Animal Outreach
1463000	1465000	On Monday
1465000	1467000	Where they're gonna get him shot
1467000	1469000	Tested for leukemia
1469000	1471000	Fixed and adopted out
1471000	1473000	So I just wanted to say for anyone who's asked
1473000	1475000	The kitty's story has a happy ending
1475000	1477000	Yay, meow meow
1477000	1479000	His official name is Donut
1479000	1481000	They've called him Donut
1481000	1483000	Instead of Batcat
1483000	1485000	That's a good name, I like Donut
1485000	1487000	I'm just glad I don't have those cats in our backyard anymore
1487000	1489000	11 cats at one time
1489000	1491000	All I know is I got a text message from Dark Soccer
1491000	1493000	On Friday night, do you want a kitten?
1493000	1495000	And I'm like, um
1495000	1497000	We have a tiny ass apartment and two cats already
1497000	1499000	I would love
1499000	1501000	to, but no
1501000	1503000	Yeah, Shermy would be too old for me to have a little feral kitten in the house
1503000	1505000	To tame
1505000	1507000	He's only six weeks old, so he's tammable
1507000	1509000	Alright, before we get into our regular gaming weeks
1509000	1511000	And what we have been playing
1511000	1513000	I do want to talk to the chatters
1513000	1515000	WhatupG leaves a comment about Tuesday
1515000	1517000	Saying Sky forgot the biggest
1517000	1519000	game release, Madden 13
1519000	1521000	Although certainly I will acknowledge
1521000	1523000	That will be a huge game release
1523000	1525000	And lots of people are going to be playing that over the Labor Day weekend
1525000	1527000	My household won't be one of them
1527000	1529000	Cause we just, that's not really a series
1529000	1531000	We've ever gotten into
1531000	1533000	I'm not a big football person
1533000	1535000	And if you're not a fan of that, and for whatever reason you just
1535000	1537000	Don't download games off the Playstation
1537000	1539000	There's a Journey collector's edition coming out this week
1539000	1541000	On disc
1541000	1543000	It's got the soundtrack, you get Journey
1543000	1545000	Flower of Flow
1545000	1547000	And also two
1547000	1549000	Little quick games that they made
1549000	1551000	And a month of Playstation Plus
1551000	1553000	That's a great deal if
1553000	1555000	You don't have any of those games
1555000	1557000	Cause all three of those games are great
1557000	1559000	Well, I don't even know if you could call
1559000	1561000	Flow a game, but whatever
1561000	1563000	It's alright
1563000	1565000	They're neat, but Journey is
1565000	1567000	Amazing
1567000	1569000	Contender for game of the year to be honest
1569000	1571000	Alright, not that Journey
1571000	1573000	It's a Journey 2012 Journey
1573000	1575000	That might make it a little bit better if it had Journey music in there
1575000	1577000	But their music was pretty good
1577000	1579000	Little mishmash, I'm sure somebody's done that on YouTube
1579000	1581000	Journey set to Journey? I've seen it
1581000	1583000	But the music in Journey 2012
1583000	1585000	Is legitimately really good
1585000	1587000	Like, as much as I love Journey
1587000	1589000	1980's
1589000	1591000	You can't do that
1591000	1593000	To Journey 2012
1593000	1595000	The music in Journey 2012 is so flippin' good
1595000	1597000	Can we get a Journey 2012
1597000	1599000	2 where it's basically
1599000	1601000	The premise of Revolution X
1601000	1603000	But with Journey
1603000	1605000	Instead, you know
1605000	1607000	Wouldn't that be kinda cool?
1607000	1609000	Dude on the toilet at the beginning of the game
1609000	1611000	If Steve Perry was talking to any of the others
1611000	1613000	Whatsoever, maybe
1613000	1615000	Although, well, the guy they have now
1615000	1617000	The guy they have now, number one, is hot
1617000	1619000	Number two, has really nice hair
1619000	1621000	And number three, can sing
1621000	1623000	Don't get me wrong, he's really good
1623000	1625000	And he can sing, and yes, I have seen Journey live recently
1625000	1627000	When he was the front man, they were really good
1627000	1629000	I know, but
1629000	1631000	I mean, I don't know
1631000	1633000	There's something about, you can't put a Journey
1633000	1635000	80's sequel in arcades
1635000	1637000	And not have Steve Perry involved
1637000	1639000	I don't know, it just would feel weird
1639000	1641000	Maybe it's Steve Perry being like
1641000	1643000	The bad guy
1643000	1645000	He's the super villain trying to get revenge on the band
1645000	1647000	It's like new Journey albums
1647000	1649000	Quick, name a Journey single after
1649000	1651000	The 1980's
1651000	1653000	Yep, yeah
1653000	1655000	That's what I thought, alright
1655000	1657000	Anyhow, your gaming week
1657000	1659000	What have you been playing this week, Dark Soccer?
1659000	1661000	Uh, WoW
1661000	1663000	Mass Effect 2, Mass Effect 3
1663000	1665000	Um, the Mass Effect thingy
1665000	1667000	On my phone, since I'm trying to get my rating back up
1667000	1669000	Um, and
1669000	1671000	Uh, yeah
1671000	1673000	That's really good
1673000	1675000	Same old stuff for you
1675000	1677000	That's not bad, I mean, it's not like you're playing bad games
1677000	1679000	And watching a lot of playthroughs
1679000	1681000	Okay
1681000	1683000	Like, Dan and I had our big Castlevania fit
1683000	1685000	The other day
1685000	1687000	But you guys like to do that, you like to go on YouTube
1687000	1689000	And watch all the playthroughs, like that's something you guys do
1689000	1691000	Dan likes to do that
1691000	1693000	Every so often I'll just get invested and watch
1693000	1695000	Do you ever do the live stuff?
1695000	1697000	Do you guys ever go onto one of those sites like Ustream
1697000	1699000	Or Twitch.tv or whatever other sites
1699000	1701000	There are and watch the live stream?
1701000	1703000	Nah
1703000	1705000	But that's because you and the hubby are more classic gamers
1705000	1707000	More than anything, yeah
1707000	1709000	I mean, I wouldn't mind doing like a
1709000	1711000	Episodic playthrough of something
1711000	1713000	But, you know
1713000	1715000	I like watching other people do it
1715000	1717000	Except it kind of bugs me because, I mean, it is
1717000	1719000	Truly what an almost perfect playthrough
1719000	1721000	Looks like because they're usually, um
1721000	1723000	Machine assisted, you know
1723000	1725000	Tigerclaw wants to know if you're going to get the Mass Effect 3
1725000	1727000	Leviathan DLC
1727000	1729000	Fuck yes
1729000	1731000	As if that should surprise anybody whatsoever
1731000	1733000	I am so excited, you guys
1733000	1735000	That's why I kind of don't want to beat my game yet
1735000	1737000	You finally set foot in multiplayer
1737000	1739000	Not that long ago
1739000	1741000	And I couldn't find anybody else on
1741000	1743000	Because no one would let me know when they were playing
1743000	1745000	We need to make that happen again
1745000	1747000	Well, for me, I have to change out my EXE
1747000	1749000	Because I have a hacked EXE so I can play in god mode
1749000	1751000	But I saved my original file
1751000	1753000	So that I can switch out for multiplayer
1753000	1755000	Tigerclaw, I just want to give a plug
1755000	1757000	There's a lot of classic games played on Twitch.tv
1757000	1759000	There are people doing speedruns on old Mario games
1759000	1761000	That's cool
1761000	1763000	I just don't like to watch it live, I guess
1763000	1765000	Unless it's for charity
1765000	1767000	Okay, like Mario Marathon you're down with
1767000	1769000	That's understandable
1769000	1771000	And even then I'm like, dude, you're still playing Sunshine, why?
1771000	1773000	I like Sunshine
1773000	1775000	Wait a minute, didn't you say Sunshine was a good game on last week's show?
1775000	1777000	I like Sunshine, but it's kind of boring to watch it
1777000	1779000	Like
1779000	1781000	Even as much as I love Mario 64
1781000	1783000	It's kind of boring to watch it
1783000	1785000	Understandable
1785000	1787000	Alright, Loki, how about you?
1787000	1789000	How was your gaming week?
1789000	1791000	This week I played lots of Minecraft
1791000	1793000	Mainly
1793000	1795000	Little bit of Grand Theft Auto because I was
1795000	1797000	Working on mods
1797000	1799000	And stuff
1799000	1801000	But yeah
1801000	1803000	Going back to Minecraft though
1803000	1805000	We started a new map
1805000	1807000	That's a tutorial level, which is kind of fun
1807000	1809000	I had to start off on that
1809000	1811000	And then played through a little bit of that
1811000	1813000	And I actually went back last night
1813000	1815000	To my VoG map
1815000	1817000	And was working a little bit more in peaceful mode too
1817000	1819000	I was finishing up some minecart stations
1819000	1821000	They make the little
1821000	1823000	Bell
1823000	1825000	Intro thing when they
1825000	1827000	Stop and then it waits like
1827000	1829000	Five seconds or so and then it makes that noise
1829000	1831000	Again and then goes automatically
1831000	1833000	Have you figured out what worlds you should be playing on
1833000	1835000	To get the awesome
1835000	1837000	Stuff? Like, I'm sure people out there
1837000	1839000	Post on forums like
1839000	1841000	Oh, use this seed, it's the best or something like that
1841000	1843000	There's all sorts of seeds
1843000	1845000	For different things, but it
1845000	1847000	Doesn't really matter
1847000	1849000	The only kind of unique thing there on some of the seeds
1849000	1851000	There are like
1851000	1853000	Landscape I guess
1853000	1855000	And then there's a few that have like the golden apples
1855000	1857000	Hidden in there and chests and stuff
1857000	1859000	But it's just
1859000	1861000	That's pretty much it
1861000	1863000	If you restart your levels
1863000	1865000	Or start new seeds now, there's clay
1865000	1867000	Which I never used anyway
1867000	1869000	So it's not a big deal
1869000	1871000	And then
1871000	1873000	You know, slimes, I guess slime farms
1873000	1875000	Are kind of important now that they're sticky
1875000	1877000	Pistons and that kind of thing
1877000	1879000	But I don't know
1879000	1881000	I haven't really bothered to
1881000	1883000	You know, find those
1883000	1885000	Usually I just try to find some interesting
1885000	1887000	Looking
1887000	1889000	Landscape and stuff
1889000	1891000	But even now it's just kind of
1891000	1893000	It's kind of boring going back to that stuff
1893000	1895000	Just waiting for the next update
1895000	1897000	The adventure update I think is going to make it a lot more fun
1897000	1899000	But we'll have to see
1899000	1901000	So anyways, Minecraft stuff
1901000	1903000	And then I actually played
1903000	1905000	A little bit of new stuff
1905000	1907000	I played more Sleeping Dogs again
1907000	1909000	For some reason my save
1909000	1911000	Like I had done a bunch of missions
1911000	1913000	And my save just didn't save or something
1913000	1915000	I must have forgotten the save
1915000	1917000	Or it didn't auto save or whatever
1917000	1919000	And so I'm having to redo a bunch of missions
1919000	1921000	So I did that
1921000	1923000	Today and then
1923000	1925000	One new game I actually picked up
1925000	1927000	I picked up
1927000	1929000	What was it? Scott Pilgrim vs. The World
1929000	1931000	I don't know why they picked that up at launch
1931000	1933000	It was fucking amazing
1933000	1935000	Yeah, I thought you had bought that at launch
1935000	1937000	So I finally got around to playing it
1937000	1939000	My only gripe about it
1939000	1941000	And this is just kind of a weird thing
1941000	1943000	Is that the stages are too long
1943000	1945000	Like I'm trying to fit in
1945000	1947000	Playing a stage with my friend at work
1947000	1949000	And we tried our 15 minute breaks
1949000	1951000	There's just no way to beat the first stage in 15 minutes
1951000	1953000	So we tried during lunch
1953000	1955000	Where we had an hour
1955000	1957000	And it actually
1957000	1959000	Got to the boss and that was about it
1959000	1961000	But we didn't get to beat it because we ran out of time
1961000	1963000	So the stages are a little long
1963000	1965000	In my game, since it's more like an arcade game
1965000	1967000	But
1967000	1969000	It's really awesome
1969000	1971000	The animation is amazing
1971000	1973000	I love the way it looks and sounds
1973000	1975000	It's just a really fantastic game
1975000	1977000	Really cool, recommend checking it out
1977000	1979000	Kind of disappointed the stages are so long
1979000	1981000	Because it does make it hard to play on break
1981000	1983000	And then beyond that
1983000	1985000	I think that's all I've played this week
1985000	1987000	Yeah
1987000	1989000	Alrighty
1989000	1991000	Oh, how's your little con...
1991000	1993000	I know this will be over by the time
1993000	1995000	The podcast hits, but for the live folks
1995000	1997000	That contest thing you're doing, how's that going?
1997000	1999000	As of right now I'm in the first place
1999000	2001000	And what that means is
2001000	2003000	Assuming I win, which I'm probably going to
2003000	2005000	Unless this one chick gets
2005000	2007000	A couple more retweets
2007000	2009000	I'm going to have them
2009000	2011000	Draw me a picture
2011000	2013000	Of myself dressed as Tingle
2013000	2015000	That is going to be the closest you'll get
2015000	2017000	That's still pretty awesome
2017000	2019000	And she's a pretty awesome artist
2019000	2021000	So expect that
2021000	2023000	An OLR in-joke will finally
2023000	2025000	Come to an end, although we all know
2025000	2027000	It's not going to come to an end whatsoever
2027000	2029000	However, it will finally reach the next step
2029000	2031000	Some resolution, yes
2031000	2033000	If you can get
2033000	2035000	Because you don't want to just win
2035000	2037000	You want to win big
2037000	2039000	And we want Footy's Kickstarter to do well
2039000	2041000	It's really
2041000	2043000	I guess it's really
2043000	2045000	About that
2045000	2047000	That's really it
2047000	2049000	They're doing okay
2049000	2051000	But I'm kind of worried that they may not
2051000	2053000	Hit their goal
2053000	2055000	They're just under $6,000
2055000	2057000	Of $10,000
2057000	2059000	They've got 11 days left
2059000	2061000	Sometimes those last few days are the biggest
2061000	2063000	I think they can do it
2063000	2065000	It looks like a pretty cool game
2065000	2067000	They're not asking for too much
2067000	2069000	If you want to check it out
2069000	2071000	It's Evilot
2071000	2073000	It's E-V-I-L-O-T
2073000	2075000	The game looks a little similar to
2075000	2077000	Zombies with
2077000	2079000	What was that?
2079000	2081000	I'm trying to remember the original name of the game
2081000	2083000	It was like, Hey Bad Man
2083000	2085000	Why?
2085000	2087000	It was a game on PSP
2087000	2089000	It was like where you play the villain basically
2089000	2091000	So it looks cool
2091000	2093000	It should be neat
2093000	2095000	Alright, Mike Gaming Week
2095000	2097000	Kind of like Dark Soccer
2097000	2099000	I played a lot of the same stuff that you're used to hearing me talk about
2099000	2101000	Like World of Warcraft
2101000	2103000	And was continuing to play
2103000	2105000	Sound Shapes
2105000	2107000	I don't know why the name escaped me for a minute
2107000	2109000	I was playing more Sound Shapes
2109000	2111000	I was playing Mario 2 still
2111000	2113000	However, there is one new game I spent
2113000	2115000	A pretty good chunk of time playing
2115000	2117000	It technically started on Friday
2117000	2119000	It's Guild Wars 2
2119000	2121000	I have spent some time playing
2121000	2123000	I didn't get to play a lot a lot
2123000	2125000	Because I was in San Francisco this weekend
2125000	2127000	Hanging out with Grandpa from Horde House
2127000	2129000	But on Friday night
2129000	2131000	And a little bit today
2131000	2133000	I'm at Guild Wars 2
2133000	2135000	I'm up to about level 10
2135000	2137000	So I'm not sure I've really had
2137000	2139000	A full amount of time to really flesh out
2139000	2141000	What I think about this game
2141000	2143000	A lot of the things that were bugging me about it
2143000	2145000	At first, I'm easing up on a little bit
2145000	2147000	And it all has to do with
2147000	2149000	You know, the Guild Wars 2 model
2149000	2151000	Because you know the pricing model is a lot different
2151000	2153000	For Guild Wars 2
2153000	2155000	You pay the one fee to get the game
2155000	2157000	And then you never have to pay
2157000	2159000	Like a monthly fee or anything again
2159000	2161000	Like no monthly fee
2161000	2163000	But now they're adding a little more of the free to play
2163000	2165000	Elements in it
2165000	2167000	Like you can go into the online shop
2167000	2169000	And buy like sunglasses for your character
2169000	2171000	You know, dumb little things
2171000	2173000	But there are some
2173000	2175000	Like basically steroids
2175000	2177000	Performance enhancing things you can get
2177000	2179000	Like you know, short time XP bonuses
2179000	2181000	And things like that you can kind of get in the shop
2181000	2183000	With real money
2183000	2185000	One of the things that started to irritate me
2185000	2187000	Is that I got a chest that dropped
2187000	2189000	And the key I needed to open it
2189000	2191000	Was something to buy in the store
2191000	2193000	And I was like, oh that's bullshit
2193000	2195000	That's such bullshit that you
2195000	2197000	You know, I was going to rage because that's a Facebook game
2197000	2199000	But then finally, I don't know if I got it as a quest reward
2199000	2201000	I think I got it as a quest reward around level 10
2201000	2203000	I did get one of those keys
2203000	2205000	So it doesn't bug me nearly as much
2205000	2207000	If you can get it in the game by doing a lot of grinding
2207000	2209000	You know, either you're going to be free to play
2209000	2211000	Or you're going to be
2211000	2213000	You know, not free to play
2213000	2215000	I still think Guild Wars 2
2215000	2217000	Despite that bitch
2217000	2219000	Is relatively minor bitch
2219000	2221000	I'm really impressed with a lot of what I've seen so far
2221000	2223000	Graphically, it's
2223000	2225000	It's really nice
2225000	2227000	It's a wonderfully presented game
2227000	2229000	You know, there's always
2229000	2231000	That temptation to compare MMOs
2231000	2233000	To World of Warcraft, but this game
2233000	2235000	Doesn't really feel like World of Warcraft
2235000	2237000	And I think one big reason
2237000	2239000	For that is they've managed
2239000	2241000	To figure out a new way to do quests
2241000	2243000	There are no yellow exclamation marks
2243000	2245000	Over people's heads
2245000	2247000	And it's not like the Final Fantasy XI style
2247000	2249000	Questing either
2249000	2251000	Basically what happens is that
2251000	2253000	You have this giant map
2253000	2255000	And I gotta say
2255000	2257000	There's a little thing I love about this game
2257000	2259000	And that is when you go to the map
2259000	2261000	The way the map appears is your camera
2261000	2263000	Actually pans down
2263000	2265000	And does like
2265000	2267000	It does a subtle transition to the actual map
2267000	2269000	But it makes it look like
2269000	2271000	You're on Google Maps
2271000	2273000	And then it zooms back in to show your character
2273000	2275000	The way it does that transition
2275000	2277000	It's one of those little things
2277000	2279000	That really makes you go
2279000	2281000	That's so cool
2281000	2283000	And then Shane found out you could draw on the map
2283000	2285000	Like it's a Madden thing
2285000	2287000	You could draw the plays on the map
2287000	2289000	Anyhow, questing
2289000	2291000	So you go on the map and you'll find these little scouts
2291000	2293000	And the scouts will tell you these things
2293000	2295000	So and so is in trouble and needs help
2295000	2297000	This person is having to deal with this conflict
2297000	2299000	Going on right now and could use some help
2299000	2301000	This person is near the cave and da da da
2301000	2303000	So the scouts will tell you where these people are
2303000	2305000	And then they draw the little hearts on your map
2305000	2307000	And you go over to the hearts
2307000	2309000	And then when you're in that general area
2309000	2311000	The game will tell you either kill these things
2311000	2313000	Collect these things
2313000	2315000	You know, kind of the general MMO stuff
2315000	2317000	But you get to pick what you want to do
2317000	2319000	Do you want to kill? Do you want to collect? What do you want to do?
2319000	2321000	And as you do those, you start to gain
2321000	2323000	It's like mini reputation grinds
2323000	2325000	Little mini reputation grinds
2325000	2327000	They don't take you any more than like 30 minutes
2327000	2329000	And then the person, the heart fills in
2329000	2331000	And that person will start selling you gear and stuff
2331000	2333000	And you've basically completed the quest
2333000	2335000	And you get like gold and XP
2335000	2337000	And the typical things
2337000	2339000	Now generally in these areas as well
2339000	2341000	Somebody could start an event quest
2341000	2343000	And the event quest is like the public questing
2343000	2347000	Which a lot of MMOs besides WoW have in them
2347000	2349000	And even WoW is getting it to some extent
2349000	2351000	With the scenarios in Pandaria
2351000	2353000	But like Warhammer
2353000	2355000	Was a game that did this very well
2355000	2357000	Was the whole public questing
2357000	2360000	And I gotta say with the Guild Wars launch going on
2360000	2362000	I mean it was crazy, like in the starter area
2362000	2364000	It would be like so and so needs help
2364000	2366000	Eradicating the mosquitoes from the village
2366000	2368000	Because you know it's like a level 2 quest or whatever
2368000	2370000	And then suddenly like a big orange circle appears on your map
2370000	2372000	And all these mosquitoes are everywhere
2372000	2375000	There's like 75 people everywhere
2375000	2377000	Killing mosquitoes and you just watch the bar go
2377000	2379000	And it like fills right up
2379000	2381000	And then you get a medal based on your contribution
2381000	2385000	And the medal gives you experience, gold, and karma points
2385000	2388000	And karma points you turn around and use to buy gear
2388000	2390000	So I gotta say
2390000	2394000	I love that they've really challenged themselves to think outside the box
2394000	2398000	And not make a clone of the successful formula
2398000	2400000	But as MMO fans
2400000	2402000	What do we think MMOs ought to offer?
2402000	2404000	And it really does feel like in that regard
2404000	2408000	Guild Wars 2 is taking MMOs to the next level
2408000	2410000	I really think that
2410000	2412000	I think it's giving a lot of
2412000	2416000	I don't want to turn into a Guild Wars 2 vs. WoW thing
2416000	2418000	I love WoW, I can't say
2418000	2420000	Oh Guild Wars 2 is going to kick its ass, whatever
2420000	2423000	And I totally disagree with people that are like
2423000	2425000	Oh WoW is dead
2425000	2427000	Oh WoW is so dead
2427000	2429000	The panda people is stupid
2429000	2431000	It's a little kid and Guild Wars is going to kill it
2431000	2433000	I've been saying every game is going to kill WoW
2433000	2435000	WoW will continue to exist
2435000	2437000	But I gotta say Guild Wars 2
2437000	2440000	Really brings something else to the table with that
2440000	2444000	And one other little thing about Guild Wars 2
2444000	2446000	That I love
2446000	2449000	They brought vista points into the game
2449000	2452000	Which I remember from a racing game called Fuel
2452000	2453000	From a couple years ago
2453000	2454000	You remember that game Fuel?
2454000	2456000	You remember how there would be places on the map
2456000	2458000	You would drive to that it's just a really gorgeous view
2458000	2460000	And you got points for that
2460000	2463000	And I think Assassin's Creed does something like this too
2463000	2464000	At least somebody was joking with me
2464000	2466000	And I haven't played that series a lot
2466000	2468000	But basically you go to these points on the map
2468000	2470000	And you might have to interact with the environment a little
2470000	2472000	Like you'll have to find the little mushrooms
2472000	2474000	You have to jump up to get to the top of the building
2474000	2476000	And then once you get up there they'll be a little book
2476000	2478000	And you press the button
2478000	2480000	And all of a sudden you'll go to a cutscene
2480000	2482000	Where the camera will do this gorgeous pan
2482000	2484000	And show you everything around you
2484000	2486000	And then 60 XP for finding the vista point
2486000	2488000	And it's marked on your map
2488000	2490000	I thought that was so awesome
2490000	2492000	Like it's something else to do that's not
2492000	2494000	Grinding a dungeon or whatever
2494000	2496000	It's just neat
2496000	2498000	There's a lot about Guild Wars 2 that's just different
2498000	2500000	It sounds like they could have it
2500000	2502000	Like you know there's people that kind of
2502000	2504000	Challenge themselves to play like a pacifist
2504000	2506000	That you could probably level up
2506000	2508000	You don't get enough XP
2508000	2510000	However, yeah the passive
2510000	2512000	Because you could go to these areas where they're like
2512000	2514000	Because to help all the people
2514000	2516000	You can
2516000	2518000	Collect kumquats or whatever
2518000	2520000	And turn them in or you can collect things
2520000	2522000	And turn them in usually
2522000	2524000	I think a pacifist, and you get XP from gathering too
2524000	2526000	So I think a pacifist could do very well
2526000	2528000	In Guild Wars 2
2528000	2530000	To be honest
2530000	2532000	Although I honestly haven't played the game enough
2532000	2534000	I haven't played it past level 10
2534000	2536000	So I can't give you like a full full review
2536000	2538000	But I, despite some of my minor bitches
2538000	2540000	About what the free to play
2540000	2542000	Traditional free to play mechanic is doing
2542000	2544000	To the game
2544000	2546000	Despite my minor bitches there
2546000	2548000	I really love some of the stuff they are trying to do
2548000	2550000	A couple other quick things
2550000	2552000	I want to say about Guild Wars 2
2552000	2554000	We will move on with the show
2554000	2556000	But this is the new game
2556000	2558000	A lot of people are going to be talking about this game
2558000	2560000	PvP
2560000	2562000	If you elect to do PvP
2562000	2564000	Which you don't have to do
2564000	2566000	But you go into your character and you hit the PvP button
2566000	2568000	And you basically get transported
2568000	2570000	To a whole new PvP world
2570000	2572000	Where your character is suddenly max level
2572000	2574000	And you're automatically a template
2574000	2576000	And you can pick whatever skills
2576000	2578000	And your PvP gear is separate
2578000	2580000	You separated the PvP game
2580000	2582000	From the PvE game
2582000	2584000	But you get to have your same character
2584000	2586000	And when you design your character
2586000	2588000	You get to pick your favorite colors on the garb
2588000	2590000	And all that stuff
2590000	2592000	So it's like you still have a sense of character
2592000	2594000	But it's like a completely separate copy
2594000	2596000	Of that character in PvP
2596000	2598000	And if you never want to touch PvP ever ever
2598000	2600000	You don't have to, it's like a separate little thing
2600000	2602000	And character design is great
2602000	2604000	Because they kind of do a little bit of the mass effect
2604000	2606000	Thing with it
2606000	2608000	Where you pick like
2608000	2610000	Did your character in their vision
2610000	2612000	See a snow leopard, a stag
2612000	2614000	And you make those types of decisions
2614000	2616000	That ultimately affect your story
2616000	2618000	I think my character saw a white stag
2618000	2620000	And that has been a big part of the story
2620000	2622000	I've been playing so far
2622000	2624000	So they have definitely taken some Bioware
2624000	2626000	The people designing this game
2626000	2628000	Clearly love
2628000	2630000	All these different types of video games
2630000	2632000	And have now made the video game they want to be playing
2632000	2634000	And for the most part it's like 98% successful
2634000	2636000	From what I've seen so far
2636000	2638000	I'd play if I had the 60 bucks to afford it
2638000	2640000	That's the problem is dropping the money up front
2640000	2642000	You know it's an investment
2642000	2644000	I mean whereas you know
2644000	2646000	I've already got wow I'm already in the blood pact
2646000	2648000	Sure sure
2648000	2650000	But that's the other thing I like about Guild Wars is that once you buy it
2650000	2652000	You know if I don't go back to it ever
2652000	2654000	It'll be there 6 months now
2654000	2656000	12 months from now
2656000	2658000	One other thing I'll say about this
2658000	2660000	The guild system is pretty awesome
2660000	2662000	Oh and then I'm going to give you one more negative
2662000	2664000	So the guild system is pretty awesome
2664000	2666000	Once you form your little guild
2666000	2668000	Every little thing that you do during the day
2668000	2670000	Kind of contributes points to the guild's total
2670000	2672000	And you can use those points to buy perks
2672000	2674000	So it's kind of like what they were
2674000	2676000	Going to do with World of Warcraft's
2676000	2678000	Guild leveling system
2678000	2680000	But they actually did it where the guild master can elect
2680000	2682000	What guild perks you're going to build
2682000	2684000	You know do you want the guild to have an XP bonus
2684000	2686000	Or a money bonus
2686000	2688000	Or what is it that you want
2688000	2690000	And you can like use the resources to build those
2690000	2692000	Which is pretty cool
2692000	2694000	Now the place I'm going to knock it a little bit is that
2694000	2696000	This is actually a big one
2696000	2698000	I'm glad I thought of this because I got to knock the game for this
2698000	2700000	It's an issue
2700000	2702000	They did this whole 3 day launch thing right
2702000	2706000	So there's a lot of people that aren't really going to be in the game until Tuesday
2706000	2708000	And some of the servers are already full
2708000	2710000	And you don't get to pick
2710000	2712000	One server for each character
2712000	2714000	You pick one server
2714000	2716000	For all of your characters
2716000	2718000	Now there's a system in the game
2718000	2720000	Where I guess you can have
2720000	2722000	People from other servers
2722000	2724000	Kind of like in a real ID
2724000	2726000	Kind of way they can guest in your game
2726000	2728000	And you can still kind of party
2728000	2730000	Cross server and there is a lot
2730000	2732000	You can do cross server
2732000	2734000	But the one thing you can't do cross server is guild
2734000	2736000	The server I'm on
2736000	2738000	Filled up in like a day
2738000	2740000	So if people want to try to get on that server
2740000	2742000	It's full
2742000	2744000	So what if I have friends like Jamie say
2744000	2746000	Who haven't bought the game yet
2746000	2748000	And then they're going to try and get on my server
2748000	2750000	It's going to be too bad, it's full
2750000	2752000	I kind of think that's bullshit
2752000	2754000	That she can't join my guild because that filled up
2754000	2756000	Because all the early people have the space
2756000	2758000	They need to have a system
2758000	2760000	Where she can still get into that server
2760000	2762000	Now
2762000	2764000	To be fair
2764000	2766000	I understand that they are doing some type of
2766000	2768000	Open transfer for 7 days
2768000	2770000	They're going to allow you to switch worlds
2770000	2772000	However much you want for 7 days
2772000	2774000	So that people can kind of settle down
2774000	2776000	Find a home and get off the populated servers
2776000	2778000	And all that stuff
2778000	2780000	However they're going to charge for that later on
2780000	2782000	And I still think it's kind of bullshit
2782000	2784000	Like there needs to be a way
2784000	2786000	If I have a friend on the server
2786000	2788000	Remember how Final Fantasy 11 did the world passes
2788000	2790000	I thought that was a good way to do it
2790000	2792000	If the server is populated make it expensive
2792000	2794000	To bring somebody on the server
2794000	2796000	But still make it possible
2796000	2798000	So that part
2798000	2800000	Sucks and needs to be rethought
2800000	2802000	A little bit
2802000	2804000	But otherwise
2804000	2806000	I'm really cool with Guild Wars 2
2806000	2808000	So I've talked 20 minutes about Guild Wars 2
2808000	2810000	But it's a big game
2810000	2812000	So there you go that's my gaming week
2812000	2814000	Finally
2814000	2816000	So let's talk about housekeeping
2816000	2818000	Twitter.com slash olr
2818000	2820000	Facebook.com slash orange lounge radio
2820000	2822000	And I didn't really clear this with Loki
2822000	2824000	Before the show but I don't think he's going to care
2824000	2826000	We're not doing a show next week
2826000	2828000	For Labor Day
2828000	2830000	And it's because
2830000	2832000	PAX you're all on vacation
2832000	2834000	You know what just enjoy
2834000	2836000	The long weekend we will try to have something
2836000	2838000	Special that does play live on the feed
2838000	2840000	Like a best of or an oldie moldy
2840000	2842000	Classic episode or something for those
2842000	2844000	Few of you that will still be there on Sunday night
2844000	2846000	But if you know what
2846000	2848000	If you have an opportunity to go out and get a
2848000	2850000	Rest and vacation a little bit enjoy
2850000	2852000	It I guess that would also be
2852000	2854000	We have to remember not every country is
2854000	2856000	Getting a three day weekend that's mostly an America
2856000	2858000	Holiday not really celebrated
2858000	2860000	Other places however please understand
2860000	2862000	We do want to take the rare opportunity
2862000	2864000	To go have a three day weekend and you know
2864000	2866000	Take a road trip if we want or what have you
2866000	2868000	I'm toying with the idea of taking a little
2868000	2870000	Quick road trip for the weekend
2870000	2872000	We'll see I think it will be fun
2872000	2874000	Of course sitting on my big butt and playing video games
2874000	2876000	All day long will be great too
2876000	2878000	Civ 5 uber match yeah
2878000	2880000	I just think it's kind of weird that like school
2880000	2882000	Is starting this week
2882000	2884000	And then there's Labor Day
2884000	2886000	So like two days of magazine class
2886000	2888000	No day of magazine class
2888000	2890000	School year has been like that for forever
2890000	2892000	So alright
2892000	2894000	Alright let's get into some gaming news
2894000	2896000	And talk about what is going on
2896000	2898000	In the gaming world and unfortunately
2898000	2900000	I better cue the Debbie Downer horns
2900000	2902000	Cause it doesn't start off pretty
2902000	2904000	Does it Loki? No layoffs
2904000	2906000	It's more and more layoffs
2906000	2908000	So PopCap they were hit
2908000	2910000	With layoffs internationally
2910000	2912000	And at least so they kind of
2912000	2914000	The way they did it
2914000	2916000	At least they were talking about
2916000	2918000	What happens in the industry
2918000	2920000	And they try to like kind of make it
2920000	2922000	You know
2922000	2924000	They didn't kind of hide it
2924000	2926000	From the public I guess
2926000	2928000	And so basically
2928000	2930000	They have
2930000	2932000	Shrunk down I guess
2932000	2934000	Shanghai's studio
2934000	2936000	Also in Seattle they let
2936000	2938000	50 people go
2938000	2940000	And Dublin was shut down
2940000	2942000	So you know
2942000	2944000	Quite a bit of layoffs
2944000	2946000	They said that you know
2946000	2948000	I guess
2948000	2950000	They made a statement
2950000	2952000	And I
2952000	2954000	Just think it's kind of interesting the way they did it
2954000	2956000	You know basically you know
2956000	2958000	You know 12 years ago
2958000	2960000	We founded PopCap we never imagined the games
2960000	2962000	We'd made the vast number of people
2962000	2964000	You know who'd play those games
2964000	2966000	Or the success that followed and so on and so forth
2966000	2968000	And then you know
2968000	2970000	This morning we informed our employees
2970000	2972000	Of a reorganization in our studios
2972000	2974000	That will include a reduction in force
2974000	2976000	In North America operations
2976000	2978000	Mostly our headquarters here in Seattle
2978000	2980000	And an exploratory
2980000	2982000	Consultation to evaluate
2982000	2984000	The future of our PopCap office
2984000	2986000	In Dublin
2986000	2988000	Ireland
2988000	2990000	And now in English reduction in force
2990000	2992000	Means that some people are losing their jobs
2992000	2994000	Exploratory consultation means
2994000	2996000	We're taking our Dublin team
2996000	2998000	About the future of that
2998000	3000000	Or talking to our Dublin team about the future of that office
3000000	3002000	And whether we can find a path to improve
3002000	3004000	Our profitability in Europe without having to
3004000	3006000	Close operations. Today's news is something
3006000	3008000	You expect periodically from companies
3008000	3010000	In a fast changing industry but it sucks
3010000	3012000	If you're one of those people losing his or her jobs
3012000	3014000	These people are our friends
3014000	3016000	And we don't like doing this
3016000	3018000	So at least they're being very personable about it
3018000	3020000	And just like you know
3020000	3022000	I think that's the way you do it right there
3022000	3024000	However I think
3024000	3026000	There's another pink elephant in the room
3026000	3028000	And allow me to echo the
3028000	3030000	Pink elephant? Yeah
3030000	3032000	Pink elephant that stands out
3032000	3034000	Isn't that when you just drink a lot?
3034000	3036000	You see pink elephants?
3036000	3038000	No I've always heard the pink elephant in the room
3038000	3040000	Is the obvious thing or whatever
3040000	3042000	Anyway you're derailing me
3042000	3044000	The pink elephant in the room in this
3044000	3046000	And allow me to echo the rest of the internet
3046000	3048000	In this is
3048000	3050000	I don't understand
3050000	3052000	Why PopCap?
3052000	3054000	Is PopCap struggling?
3054000	3056000	I thought out of all the
3056000	3058000	Gaming companies out there
3058000	3060000	PopCap was doing a lot of things right
3060000	3062000	And granted your whole memo
3062000	3064000	And everything you're talking about there is
3064000	3066000	An example of some of the things they do right
3066000	3068000	A lot of us had a great fear
3068000	3070000	When EA bought them
3070000	3072000	Something like this would happen
3072000	3074000	They go into why
3074000	3076000	And basically
3076000	3078000	A little context on why we're making cuts
3078000	3080000	In some areas and why we're investing and expanding
3080000	3082000	In others, in past years
3082000	3084000	We've seen dramatic change in the way people play
3084000	3086000	And pay for games
3086000	3088000	Free to play, social and mobile games have
3088000	3090000	Exploded in popularity, that happened fast
3090000	3092000	Surprisingly so
3092000	3094000	The change in consumer taste requires
3094000	3096000	Us to reorganize our business and
3096000	3098000	Invest in new types of games on new
3098000	3100000	Platforms, it's a completely different world
3100000	3102000	From where we started, that's why
3104000	3106000	I still
3106000	3108000	Does not make sense
3108000	3110000	And granted PopCap
3110000	3112000	Wasn't putting out a lot of games
3112000	3114000	Maybe unfortunately there was
3114000	3116000	Just too much that was in development
3116000	3118000	That was costing them too much money
3118000	3120000	Too much in development, not enough out on the table
3120000	3122000	But still, how fucking huge
3122000	3124000	Was Plants vs. Zombies
3124000	3126000	But Jeweled
3126000	3128000	But Jeweled changed
3128000	3130000	The industry in some ways
3130000	3132000	But Jeweled was one of the first Facebook
3132000	3134000	Games, period
3134000	3136000	Everybody knows what kind of
3136000	3138000	Jackpagle is
3138000	3140000	I don't understand
3140000	3142000	I get it when game companies
3142000	3144000	As much as this pained me
3144000	3146000	When Bizarre Creations closed
3146000	3148000	I understood that Blur
3148000	3150000	Was not very well received
3150000	3152000	And that the Geometry Wars games were kind of
3152000	3154000	Losing steam and all that
3154000	3156000	And that they weren't doing the PGR games anymore
3156000	3158000	I kind of saw the economics in that
3158000	3160000	I don't get it here
3160000	3162000	Despite everything that they're saying there
3162000	3164000	I can't help as a fan
3164000	3166000	That this company was doing very well
3166000	3168000	Before EA bought them
3168000	3170000	I can't help but think
3170000	3172000	Despite what they're saying
3172000	3174000	Something's up
3174000	3176000	Well maybe
3176000	3178000	Because they are bought by EA
3178000	3180000	The investors thought
3180000	3182000	Hey, there's too much overhead on this company
3182000	3184000	And so we need to cut back
3184000	3186000	In order to make it more profitable
3186000	3188000	So EA just jacked all the franchise
3188000	3190000	EA just snatched Jeweled
3190000	3192000	Snatched Plants vs. Zombies
3192000	3194000	Worked for Zynga
3194000	3196000	Of course they're seeing though that that's not the case
3196000	3198000	They said if we didn't have EA behind us
3198000	3200000	The cuts would have been worse
3200000	3202000	So, I don't know
3202000	3204000	I'd have to
3204000	3206000	I wouldn't really know what to do until I saw a financial report
3206000	3208000	Honestly
3208000	3210000	It's just weird
3210000	3212000	Maybe because everything is free to play
3212000	3214000	Like for example in Jeweled Blitz
3214000	3216000	And stuff like that on Facebook
3216000	3218000	That no one's actually buying the games anymore
3218000	3220000	Maybe that's why
3220000	3222000	You think of not enough people buying
3222000	3224000	Those power ups and the things that
3224000	3226000	Maybe
3226000	3228000	Substantiate the free to play model
3228000	3230000	Maybe not
3230000	3232000	Maybe because of PopCap's style
3232000	3234000	They've always been pretty good about not shoving that shit
3234000	3236000	Down your throat like Zynga Games do
3236000	3238000	That maybe
3238000	3240000	Unfortunately being nice isn't profitable
3240000	3242000	Maybe
3242000	3244000	I don't think that it was a lack of that
3244000	3246000	I thought that they had very innovative ways of getting
3246000	3248000	The games out there
3248000	3250000	I've got a
3250000	3252000	Special version of PEGL that teamed with Valve
3252000	3254000	That came out
3254000	3256000	When they were doing
3256000	3258000	It was like a special PEGL
3258000	3260000	That had Portal stuff in there
3260000	3262000	And Team Fortress and everything
3262000	3264000	And it was free
3264000	3266000	It's like if you liked this, here's the full game
3266000	3268000	Here's the whole thing
3268000	3270000	The Plants vs. Zombies stuff in WoW
3270000	3272000	The PEGL add-on
3272000	3274000	Which I played a lot of the PEGL add-on
3274000	3276000	And really wish it was still available
3276000	3278000	They really did look into
3278000	3280000	Getting it out there in different ways
3280000	3282000	And I think that
3282000	3284000	If they had been able to keep that up
3284000	3286000	Then maybe this wouldn't happen
3286000	3288000	But I'm not sure
3288000	3290000	I really don't know what to say
3290000	3292000	Until I see a financial report
3292000	3294000	Tigerclaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says
3294000	3296000	Could it be that people are finally
3296000	3298000	Getting tired of playing
3298000	3300000	Casual games?
3300000	3302000	Nah
3302000	3304000	No
3304000	3306000	Here's the thing
3306000	3308000	If you mean casual games to mean Facebook games
3308000	3310000	Maybe
3310000	3312000	I think what's going to happen to Facebook games
3312000	3316000	Is what happened in the video game crash of 84
3316000	3318000	Which is there's just so much shit
3318000	3320000	In the market
3320000	3322000	And a lot of commercialized shit
3322000	3324000	And money grabbing shit that isn't worth it
3324000	3326000	There's just so much shit out there
3326000	3328000	It's going to crack
3328000	3330000	And people aren't feeling all that great about Facebook
3330000	3332000	These days anyway
3332000	3334000	I feel like
3334000	3336000	The other shoe is going to drop on Facebook
3336000	3338000	Any day now
3338000	3340000	If there could actually be a competitor that could come in
3340000	3342000	I realize Google Plus is out there
3342000	3344000	But Google
3344000	3346000	Kind of just couldn't do it for whatever reason
3346000	3348000	If there's somebody
3348000	3350000	That really gave the public what they wanted
3350000	3352000	It could all come tumbling down for Facebook
3352000	3354000	Pretty soon
3354000	3356000	I'm on a social networking thing that doesn't have the stupid games on it
3356000	3358000	Well I always liked the way Google Plus did it
3358000	3360000	It was just another tab somewhere else
3360000	3362000	I mean to be perfectly honest I'm actually thinking about
3362000	3364000	Going back to using Google Plus
3364000	3366000	Because of just how ridiculous Facebook has gotten
3366000	3368000	But I don't play the games
3368000	3370000	There's a lot of people that are worried about
3370000	3372000	System security
3372000	3374000	So they, like I have done, have blocked
3374000	3376000	Every single game request that's come through
3376000	3378000	Well this is the thing that pisses me off about Facebook
3378000	3380000	Literally pisses me off
3380000	3382000	I don't know how many times
3382000	3384000	I have turned off
3384000	3386000	Location statuses on my post
3386000	3388000	I don't want all my posts posting
3388000	3390000	Where my location is
3390000	3392000	I use an app called Foursquare
3392000	3394000	When I specifically want to disclose that
3394000	3396000	I hate being tagged
3396000	3398000	I don't check into my house
3398000	3400000	And all that stuff
3400000	3402000	I don't do that
3402000	3404000	So I don't want my post to be tagged
3404000	3406000	With my work address or my home
3406000	3408000	Or whatever it is
3408000	3410000	Yet that shit keeps turning itself back on
3410000	3412000	I just had to do it on a Facebook post
3412000	3414000	I made an hour before the show
3414000	3416000	And that shit is driving me bonkers
3416000	3418000	The site's broken, remember I've talked about this a few weeks ago
3418000	3420000	And it's still broken
3420000	3422000	It's been broken for over a month now
3422000	3424000	Where you can unsubscribe
3424000	3426000	From somebody's
3426000	3428000	Comments and likes
3428000	3430000	Basically you just don't want to see one
3430000	3432000	Okay I like this picture
3432000	3434000	I don't care if you like that picture
3434000	3436000	And it keeps popping back
3436000	3438000	No it keeps popping back up
3438000	3440000	I want to unsubscribe from it
3440000	3442000	And it will hide that post
3442000	3444000	But it will still be there
3444000	3446000	I have to stop
3446000	3448000	For people that keep having that stuff pop up
3448000	3450000	And I'm just tired of seeing their post
3450000	3452000	I actually have to unsubscribe from them
3452000	3454000	Why do we keep using Facebook?
3454000	3456000	I'm sitting here bitching
3456000	3458000	Yet I'll still use it to make some stupid posts this evening
3458000	3460000	Why? Because I need instant gratification
3460000	3462000	Not that people are on Google
3462000	3464000	It's not even that
3464000	3466000	Why do we need that right now in our society?
3466000	3468000	Why do we need it?
3468000	3470000	The only reason I keep up with Facebook
3470000	3472000	Is just to piss off my mother
3472000	3474000	To keep up with my friends and family
3474000	3476000	In Alabama
3476000	3478000	To keep up with my friends
3478000	3480000	In other countries
3480000	3482000	To keep up with my friends across America
3482000	3484000	Because only three people
3484000	3486000	Anymore still use AIM
3486000	3488000	Which I still use to keep up with people
3488000	3490000	I've found old friends
3490000	3492000	That I used to chat with
3492000	3494000	Back when I had AOL for real
3494000	3496000	Back in the day
3496000	3498000	One of my friends just found me through DeviantArt
3498000	3500000	And we're on Facebook now
3500000	3502000	I mean, I use it to keep up with people
3502000	3504000	But other than that
3504000	3506000	I mean, like
3506000	3508000	I get so irritated that
3508000	3510000	People just use it for a
3510000	3512000	Sympathy grab, you know what I mean?
3512000	3514000	Or, hi, look where I am and you're not
3514000	3516000	I don't care where you are
3516000	3518000	I don't need to know when you go to bed
3518000	3520000	I think it's just this whole
3520000	3524000	I think it really is a modern phenomenon
3524000	3526000	That everyone wants a little bit of
3526000	3528000	I hate to use it
3528000	3530000	In this respect, but everyone wants their own little
3530000	3532000	Piece of celebrity, you know what I mean?
3532000	3534000	Where they want people to care about what they're doing
3534000	3536000	It's that whole Andy Warhol thing
3536000	3538000	The 15 minutes of fame, it's all of that coming to light
3538000	3540000	Andy Warhol predicted things better than the Mayans
3542000	3544000	Well, he was a fairly
3544000	3546000	Interesting person
3546000	3548000	Yes he was He was an OCD collector
3548000	3550000	Yeah, yeah Anyway
3550000	3552000	My teacher got to meet him Why did he do a painting of soup cans?
3552000	3554000	One of my teachers got to meet him
3554000	3556000	Oh yeah? Yeah, back then
3556000	3558000	Anyhow, how did we get from PopCap to this?
3558000	3560000	You're the one who changed it to Andy Warhol
3560000	3562000	I do find this topic fascinating
3562000	3564000	Let me read some chat comments real quick
3564000	3566000	Those participating with the show at live.vognetwork.com
3566000	3568000	Locopoco says
3568000	3570000	I use it, talking about Facebook
3570000	3572000	Cause all my family and friends use it
3572000	3574000	And that's all I can use to keep up with them
3574000	3576000	Why?
3576000	3578000	And I'm not saying that at you
3578000	3580000	Because I bet everybody would answer the question the same way
3580000	3582000	And I'm even asking myself this
3582000	3584000	Why not just pick up the phone and call somebody?
3584000	3586000	I'd
3586000	3588000	I'd pretty much
3588000	3590000	I'd call my mother
3590000	3592000	I have nothing to talk to them about
3592000	3594000	That's why I post
3594000	3596000	Things on there
3596000	3598000	Not like, hey I did this today
3598000	3600000	It's like, hey look at this cool movie trailer
3600000	3602000	Frisbee in our chat room
3602000	3604000	Why does Facebook have to be the only way
3604000	3606000	To keep in touch with people?
3606000	3608000	And lately all I do now is just for
3608000	3610000	Reblogging political shit
3610000	3612000	It helped me with the kitten
3612000	3614000	You know?
3614000	3616000	You gotta love
3616000	3618000	DJ Morpheus from Understation Live
3618000	3620000	Just made a Facebook post
3620000	3622000	I was told to reload Facebook, so that's why I did it
3622000	3624000	No, I hate being tagged in a location
3624000	3626000	Where you were tagged. Jamie hates to be tagged
3626000	3628000	So I'm tagging her. I don't mind being tagged
3628000	3630000	In a picture, I hate location tags
3630000	3632000	Actually I don't like being tagged
3632000	3634000	In a picture sometimes, like the ones
3634000	3636000	Not necessarily pictures, but like the ones that are like
3636000	3638000	Here's a calendar of all these birthdays
3638000	3640000	I'm gonna tag everybody
3640000	3642000	For the record, I can't hide that
3642000	3644000	Travis, just saying
3644000	3646000	I hate the picture tagging too, but
3646000	3648000	At the same time, like earlier today
3648000	3650000	Clover Nykon, one of our listeners
3650000	3652000	Made this awesome 3D vog art rendering
3652000	3654000	And he tagged me in that
3654000	3656000	And I was okay with that
3656000	3658000	At least that's relevant to my interest
3658000	3660000	I may not be in that picture, but it's a vog picture
3660000	3662000	And I want to see it, so that's alright
3662000	3664000	I don't give a crap about that
3664000	3666000	I hate location posts
3666000	3668000	I am going to
3668000	3670000	resolution
3670000	3672000	We've been talking a lot about Labor Day
3672000	3674000	And what we want to do over the Labor Day weekend
3674000	3676000	And I am going to resolve
3676000	3678000	To not touch social networking
3678000	3680000	Labor Day weekend
3680000	3682000	No Facebook, no Google Plus, no Twitter
3682000	3684000	You know where I live these days?
3684000	3686000	Tumblr
3686000	3688000	None of that either, none of that for me
3688000	3690000	Have fun, I'm gonna be on Tumblr
3690000	3692000	Why won't you do it?
3692000	3694000	Because I love Tumblr, I can give up Facebook
3694000	3696000	I don't give a crap, but I love Tumblr because
3696000	3698000	I actually get news articles
3698000	3700000	On Tumblr, I use Tumblr as my
3700000	3702000	Blog for my
3702000	3704000	Fitness thing, and actually if anyone wants to follow
3704000	3706000	My fitness blog, it's called Dieting Can
3706000	3708000	Bite Me, all one word
3708000	3710000	At Tumblr
3710000	3712000	But I mean, I use that for
3712000	3714000	I use it for art blogging
3714000	3716000	I actually use that for real
3716000	3718000	Blogging stuff, and for getting my thoughts
3718000	3720000	Out there, it's sort of my
3720000	3722000	Live general replacement for right now
3722000	3724000	Alan Alchemy in our chat room says, well the issue of Facebook
3724000	3726000	Is that it managed to get everyone's like
3726000	3728000	55 year old aunts and shit on it
3728000	3730000	Which really is unprecedented
3730000	3732000	And that audience does not give a shit about moving
3732000	3734000	On to the next great thing like the rest of it
3734000	3736000	It's kind of a good point
3736000	3738000	Is that that's one reason why Facebook took off
3738000	3740000	Is that it got everybody on it
3740000	3744000	And now it's ads, ads, ads, ads
3744000	3746000	Alan Alchemy continues
3746000	3748000	So the problem is that if you're in the same situation
3748000	3750000	Of keeping track of your family, re-Facebook
3750000	3752000	There is no reason to ever believe they'll move on
3752000	3754000	To something else, so even if you move on
3754000	3756000	To the next thing, you'll have to keep your Facebook
3756000	3758000	So it's always going to be a little bit relevant
3758000	3760000	Then let's move off
3760000	3762000	Let's go back to Live Journal
3762000	3764000	Here's some selected likes that they want me to like
3764000	3766000	Wreck-It Ralph, Cuddling,
3766000	3768000	Five Finger Death Punch, and Act of Valor
3768000	3770000	What?
3770000	3772000	All that liking stuff is, is marketing
3772000	3774000	Exactly, I've had to go back
3774000	3776000	And unlike things because
3776000	3778000	I realize it's ironic, we tell you to go like
3778000	3780000	Orange Lounge Radio and Vogue Network
3780000	3782000	But guys, that's
3782000	3784000	I mean, and that's the double-edged sword about Facebook
3784000	3786000	Is that it's still a great way to promote
3786000	3788000	My shit, when I don't have the million dollars
3788000	3790000	To spend on magazine ads and
3790000	3792000	You know, TV ads and the other stuff
3792000	3794000	The big boys get to do
3794000	3796000	So yes, I do realize it's ironic
3796000	3798000	Here I am bitching about Facebook, yet
3798000	3800000	I say, go like Orange Lounge Radio on Facebook
3800000	3802000	Because it still is a good way to remind you guys
3802000	3804000	The show is here, and to listen
3804000	3806000	And all that stuff
3806000	3808000	Well, I'm going to stick to it
3808000	3810000	I'm going to put
3810000	3812000	Make my actions match my words
3812000	3814000	I am stepping off Facebook
3814000	3816000	For one weekend, it's not even
3816000	3818000	That big of a deal, one weekend
3818000	3820000	Is anybody out there going to try it too?
3820000	3822000	Is it just going to be me?
3822000	3824000	Are you really all that attached?
3826000	3828000	I guess we'll find out
3828000	3830000	Where were we? We were talking about PopCap
3830000	3832000	I'm sure the PopCap employees don't
3832000	3834000	Really appreciate that it became a Facebook rant
3834000	3836000	But whatever
3836000	3838000	Travis tagged you with
3838000	3840000	Your location
3840000	3842000	Yeah, but he did it for my fan page
3842000	3844000	So keep pouring that out
3844000	3846000	That's fine
3848000	3850000	In Sacramento, well that's fine
3850000	3852000	I just don't like it when he gives my address
3852000	3854000	Alright, moving on
3854000	3856000	More bad news
3856000	3858000	Sometimes I don't want people to know
3858000	3860000	When I'm having lunch at Wiener Works
3860000	3862000	Only when I'm having dessert
3862000	3864000	That's why I got rid of Foursquare
3864000	3866000	I really don't give a shit anymore
3866000	3868000	I don't care if people know where I am
3868000	3870000	I don't necessarily want people to know where I am
3870000	3872000	And I don't care where you are
3872000	3874000	I actually, okay
3874000	3876000	I swear this is the last thing on social networking
3876000	3878000	The reason why I like Foursquare
3878000	3880000	Is I actually like the search function
3880000	3882000	To see what restaurants my friends have been to
3882000	3884000	And if they left tips, if they enjoyed it or not
3884000	3886000	I have found it to be way more useful
3886000	3888000	Than Yelp and that
3888000	3890000	I usually just ask people
3890000	3892000	Yelp reviews are a lot of
3892000	3894000	Well, but like, okay
3894000	3896000	Literally one night, Alan and I were out shopping
3896000	3898000	We were at Bed Bath and Beyond or something
3898000	3900000	Getting the coffee stuff
3900000	3902000	Because they sell a lot of the coffee cups there
3902000	3904000	And we were like, alright let's go somewhere for dinner
3904000	3906000	Where should we go? I don't know
3906000	3908000	Let's go somewhere new
3908000	3910000	And I pulled up Foursquare and I'm like
3910000	3912000	Alright, let me see what restaurants are coming up
3912000	3914000	That my friends have been to recently
3914000	3916000	Oh, Tex Wasabi's
3916000	3918000	That's that one guy
3918000	3920000	From Food Network's restaurant
3920000	3922000	Yeah, thank you
3922000	3924000	That guy with the horrible hair
3924000	3926000	It's his restaurant and I've never been there
3926000	3928000	And I loved it actually
3928000	3930000	I thought it was really expensive
3930000	3932000	Yeah, it's a little bit
3932000	3934000	It's not like Ruth Chris expensive
3934000	3936000	It's like Red Lobster prices
3936000	3938000	That's not so bad
3938000	3940000	It's sushi and barbecue
3940000	3942000	And I
3942000	3944000	You think it's the weirdest thing in the world
3944000	3946000	I shit you not, it's fucking amazing
3946000	3948000	Not to endorse
3948000	3950000	Johnny Garlic's
3950000	3952000	But there's none around here I don't think
3952000	3954000	No, there's one in Roseville
3954000	3956000	What are you talking about?
3956000	3958000	Alright
3958000	3960000	Let's move on
3960000	3962000	This is more bad news
3962000	3964000	This just sucks
3964000	3966000	I don't know what else to say about this
3966000	3968000	Sony Liverpool has been closed
3968000	3970000	You know them because they brought you
3970000	3972000	Wipeout 2048
3972000	3974000	If you're like me you remember this studio
3974000	3976000	When they were called Psygnosis
3976000	3978000	You remember Psygnosis?
3978000	3980000	Lemmings
3980000	3982000	I mean that game
3982000	3984000	Was like PC gaming
3984000	3986000	Golden Child
3986000	3988000	For years and years
3988000	3990000	They became Sony Liverpool
3990000	3992000	Shadow of the Beast was another game they made
3992000	3994000	And of course the Wipeout games
3994000	3996000	What happened?
3996000	3998000	I guess Wipeout on the Vita didn't live up to expectations
3998000	4000000	I don't think that's Wipeout's fault
4000000	4002000	That was probably one of the better games
4002000	4004000	To get on the Vita
4004000	4006000	This is another one I'm looking at
4006000	4008000	Going
4008000	4010000	Is it just because Wipeout
4010000	4012000	Isn't making waves
4012000	4014000	The way that LittleBigPlanet
4014000	4016000	Is? I mean I don't know
4016000	4018000	But I mean Psygnosis has put out some good shit
4018000	4020000	Over the years
4020000	4022000	It's just weird
4022000	4024000	What else can I say?
4024000	4026000	That sucks
4026000	4028000	A little known fact about Psygnosis
4028000	4030000	They received top billing for creating
4030000	4032000	The faceoff games
4032000	4034000	Featured in Nickelodeon's 1992 television show
4034000	4036000	Nick Arcade
4036000	4038000	That's right they created the faceoff games in Nick Arcade
4038000	4040000	Get the fuck out that was them?
4040000	4042000	Yeah Posthaste, Jet Jocks
4042000	4044000	And Battle of the Bands
4046000	4048000	A little piece of
4048000	4050000	The 12 year old boy in me
4050000	4052000	Who is playing Lemmings on his
4052000	4054000	486 PC is having a cry
4054000	4056000	Right now
4056000	4058000	I don't get it
4058000	4060000	Poor Rob
4060000	4062000	Poor me, poor all of us
4062000	4064000	We all lose with this news
4064000	4066000	This week, the only thing we can hope
4066000	4068000	These guys form new stuff
4068000	4070000	You know see this would have been another game
4070000	4072000	That would have been good from them
4072000	4074000	That they could have remade and it would have been really sweet
4074000	4076000	Colony Wars was another game that they worked on
4076000	4078000	When they were Sony
4078000	4080000	I swear all this is just putting me in a bad mood
4080000	4082000	I'm sorry
4082000	4084000	Well I hope they can
4084000	4086000	Rise up and start
4086000	4088000	Something new, I mean I remember PopCap had
4088000	4090000	That iOS studio
4090000	4092000	No one's gonna do anything new
4092000	4094000	There's no money in anything new
4094000	4096000	People want the same recycled
4096000	4098000	Crap and companies don't like to
4098000	4100000	Take risks, end of story
4100000	4102000	Do you find it a bit ironic that they're
4102000	4104000	One of the launch games for you know
4104000	4106000	This whole Sony mobile thing or whatever
4106000	4108000	Their platform is Lemmings
4110000	4112000	That's just salt in the wound right there
4112000	4114000	But I mean well
4114000	4116000	That's just because what's new hasn't been thought of yet
4116000	4118000	Facebook at one time didn't exist
4118000	4120000	It was new
4120000	4122000	But it was still based off of a pre-existing concept
4122000	4124000	Social networking is not new
4124000	4126000	Well video games aren't new
4126000	4128000	But there's still lots of ideas that haven't been discovered yet
4128000	4130000	You know we had pen pals back in the day
4130000	4134000	This is updated pen palling pretty much
4134000	4136000	You know
4136000	4138000	Concepts can evolve
4138000	4140000	But I really don't think that there's
4140000	4142000	Much new to be had anymore
4142000	4144000	Everyone copies everybody
4144000	4146000	I think that's with all due respect
4146000	4148000	I think that's just a jaded perspective
4148000	4150000	On where our industry is at
4150000	4152000	We feel that way because that's all we're getting
4152000	4154000	We're getting sequels, we're getting all this same old shit
4154000	4156000	The people that are doing new things are being ignored
4156000	4158000	And I agree
4158000	4160000	That sucks
4160000	4162000	We need to pay attention to the good ideas
4162000	4164000	And I've told a couple people this
4164000	4166000	I'm actually gonna be writing a book and I'm gonna self publish
4166000	4168000	Because
4168000	4170000	You notice that all the books
4170000	4172000	And I hate to use these as examples
4172000	4174000	Because they really are just awful fan fiction
4174000	4176000	But like that 50 Shades of Shit
4176000	4178000	There's some pretty bad writing that gets published
4178000	4180000	And people eat it up
4180000	4182000	But the thing is
4182000	4184000	That that's someone who
4184000	4186000	You know some of these other books that came out
4186000	4188000	That have been rejected
4188000	4190000	By major publishers
4190000	4192000	They've self published and have since turned into
4192000	4194000	Pretty big money making schemes
4194000	4196000	There's a girl that writes episodic
4196000	4198000	Vampire stories on Facebook
4198000	4200000	For 99 cents a copy
4200000	4202000	And she's a millionaire now
4202000	4204000	A million bucks isn't that much anymore
4204000	4206000	Relatively
4206000	4208000	I wouldn't mind having that
4208000	4210000	But a college student putting up
4210000	4212000	Her own little stories on Amazon
4212000	4214000	Selling them
4214000	4216000	I think she'd get like a
4216000	4218000	10% profit off of it
4218000	4220000	Or some really small margin of profit
4220000	4222000	What's the trick? How do you make people pay for it?
4222000	4224000	If we charge 99 cents an episode
4224000	4226000	Of Orange Lounge Radio
4226000	4228000	Let's not kid ourselves
4228000	4230000	The thing that I'm saying is
4230000	4232000	That I think that's why the Kickstarter thing is actually
4232000	4234000	Really taking off
4234000	4236000	It has to do back with that self publishing
4236000	4238000	Self actualizing
4238000	4240000	They're going to the people instead of using
4240000	4242000	Some formula
4242000	4244000	That companies think works
4244000	4246000	They're putting
4246000	4248000	Say hey, show me you're interested with your money
4248000	4250000	I mean
4250000	4252000	Except 5% of it won't actually go to the idea
4252000	4254000	At all
4254000	4256000	But the Kickstarter idea is new
4256000	4258000	Relatively new
4258000	4260000	And they made a business off of it
4260000	4262000	So that's something there
4262000	4264000	It's basically I think a lot of people
4264000	4266000	Taking their own ideas
4266000	4268000	Into their own hands
4268000	4270000	Not letting someone else corrupt their idea
4270000	4272000	And seeing how far they can make it go
4272000	4274000	Based on the will of the people
4274000	4276000	Alright
4276000	4278000	I'm sorry I didn't mean to go off on that
4278000	4280000	That's alright
4280000	4282000	That's funny news though
4282000	4284000	It's been an hour and we've done two downer stories
4284000	4286000	Fuck this game
4286000	4288000	Fuck this game
4288000	4290000	Final Fantasy XIV
4290000	4292000	It's being pulled off the shelves
4292000	4294000	Aw no more Final Fantasy XIV
4294000	4296000	Squeenix said take it off your shelves
4296000	4298000	You know why?
4298000	4300000	Because they don't want it to get in the way of a
4300000	4302000	Realm Reborn
4302000	4304000	They're basically saying
4304000	4306000	That those who are registering
4306000	4308000	Their copy of Final Fantasy XIV
4308000	4310000	Will have full access to a 30 day
4310000	4312000	Free trial period prior to the servers shutting
4312000	4314000	Down in preparation for the
4314000	4316000	Alpha and Beta test of a Realm Reborn
4316000	4318000	So they're wanting to just
4318000	4320000	Not have those old copies go out there anymore
4320000	4322000	They want people to focus
4322000	4324000	On the new
4324000	4326000	What happens if they don't
4326000	4328000	Use those free, like if I bought
4328000	4330000	The game and I knew that they're gonna
4330000	4332000	Shut the servers down
4332000	4334000	The servers aren't shutting down
4334000	4336000	Don't be confused
4336000	4338000	They're just pulling it off shelves
4338000	4340000	They're shutting down the servers
4340000	4342000	What? I had not heard that
4342000	4344000	Exactly what I read off here
4344000	4346000	From their own thing
4346000	4348000	Prior to the servers shutting down
4348000	4350000	To prepare for the Alpha and Beta tests
4350000	4352000	Oh shit
4352000	4354000	So like why would I want to
4354000	4356000	Wow
4356000	4358000	If I had 30 days
4358000	4360000	Wouldn't I want to save that for when it starts
4360000	4362000	When I originally saw this, that update wasn't there
4362000	4364000	That's why
4364000	4366000	Basically the update
4366000	4368000	Is a confirmation that
4368000	4370000	The original story came out from
4370000	4372000	People posting about, hey we got this
4372000	4374000	Note in our store, we have to take it down
4374000	4376000	I'll read the
4376000	4378000	Actual statement, okay
4378000	4380000	In anticipation of the upcoming Alpha and Beta test
4380000	4382000	For Final Fantasy XIV, a Realm Reborn
4382000	4384000	Square Enix, in coordination
4384000	4386000	With our retail partners, has decided
4386000	4388000	To discontinue sales of the current version of Final Fantasy XIV
4388000	4390000	This move was done
4390000	4392000	To help ensure that new customers who register
4392000	4394000	Their copy of Final Fantasy XIV
4394000	4396000	Will have full access to the 30 day
4396000	4398000	Free trial period prior to the
4398000	4400000	Servers shutting down to prepare for the Alpha
4400000	4402000	And Beta tests of Final Fantasy XIV
4402000	4404000	A Realm Reborn
4404000	4406000	Wow
4406000	4408000	See, in my mind I was like
4408000	4410000	Oh, they'll do kind of like what World of Warcraft does
4410000	4412000	You have your test servers that run one
4412000	4414000	Copy of the game
4414000	4416000	That's archaic and dumb
4416000	4418000	Not that anybody's really gonna
4418000	4420000	There'll be hundreds of people that weep over
4420000	4422000	Final Fantasy XIV servers being shut down
4422000	4424000	But, I mean
4424000	4426000	When it vanishes to that though, it is a clean break from the old
4426000	4428000	Yeah, that's
4428000	4430000	That's unprecedented
4430000	4432000	I think it's gonna kick it
4432000	4434000	I think it's gonna
4434000	4436000	Kick him in the ass
4436000	4438000	Square is literally trying to erase your memory
4438000	4440000	Of that game
4440000	4442000	So that when Realm Reborn comes out
4442000	4444000	It's treated like a brand new game
4444000	4446000	A brand new launch
4446000	4448000	Like the old one didn't ever happen
4448000	4450000	That's crazy
4450000	4452000	I think
4452000	4454000	That it's gonna come back to kick him though
4454000	4456000	I think it's gonna come back
4456000	4458000	And I think it's really gonna hurt him
4458000	4460000	I'd
4460000	4462000	It's a, you know what, I'm gonna give it this
4462000	4464000	Final Fantasy XIV
4464000	4466000	Sucked
4466000	4468000	I tried it two or three times
4468000	4470000	I really tried to like it
4470000	4472000	It was not a good MMO
4472000	4474000	Harry Monkey Balls is what it sucked
4474000	4476000	I'm just, having played WoW
4476000	4478000	Having played Guild Wars
4478000	4480000	Night's the Old Republic
4480000	4482000	Having played just about everything that's come to the
4482000	4484000	Table
4484000	4486000	Final Fantasy XIV sucked
4486000	4488000	XI was still a better experience
4488000	4490000	For the month I went back to XI
4490000	4492000	I just
4492000	4494000	Yeah
4494000	4496000	And XI made me cry with frustration
4496000	4498000	And everything I saw made me like it better
4498000	4500000	Oh, but I don't think it's necessarily
4500000	4502000	Going to, you know
4502000	4504000	I applaud them for taking risks
4504000	4506000	I don't know if it will necessarily
4506000	4508000	Be a failure
4508000	4510000	But I think if you're hedging your bets on sales of the
4510000	4512000	Console version of the game, that's dangerous
4512000	4514000	Because console MMOs
4514000	4516000	Haven't been super super well done
4516000	4518000	So
4518000	4520000	With the exception of Final Fantasy XI
4520000	4522000	So I hope they also
4522000	4524000	Consider the relaunch on the PC as well
4524000	4526000	I'm
4526000	4528000	Fascinating
4528000	4530000	You know what, it's like the more crap they do
4530000	4532000	With this, the less I'm interested in it
4532000	4534000	It's not worth it, there's bigger and better out there
4534000	4536000	Alright, let's move on with some more news
4538000	4540000	So EA is hoping
4540000	4542000	To avoid a whole
4542000	4544000	It's kind of funny that they're actually
4544000	4546000	Acknowledging it now, but they're trying
4546000	4548000	To put a lot
4548000	4550000	Of resources in preventing another
4550000	4552000	FIFA hack going on
4552000	4554000	With FIFA 13
4554000	4556000	And basically
4556000	4558000	They made a lot of money off the Ultimate Team DLC
4558000	4560000	A 69%
4560000	4562000	Increase from the same period last year
4562000	4564000	And of course people suspect
4564000	4566000	Hmm, that might be because people were hacking
4566000	4568000	Accounts to steal
4568000	4570000	People's live information
4570000	4572000	And buy
4572000	4574000	FIFA stuff so they could resell those characters
4574000	4576000	They said
4576000	4578000	We've learned a lot from the experience
4578000	4580000	A lot of companies are suffering from this right now
4580000	4582000	There's a lot of sophisticated hacking
4582000	4584000	Or hacking happening in the gaming industry
4584000	4586000	And it's a continuous battle
4586000	4588000	And we've
4588000	4590000	We take it very seriously
4590000	4592000	And we put a lot of resources on it
4592000	4594000	We're learning from the FIFA example last year
4594000	4596000	And it's been incorporated into this year
4596000	4598000	And there's some incremental and additional
4598000	4600000	Things, I don't want to get too detailed
4600000	4602000	Because I want to tip our hand
4602000	4604000	But rest assured we'll take it very seriously
4604000	4606000	I'm sorry
4606000	4608000	I still don't see how that's going to happen
4608000	4610000	Considering that you're selling the same stuff
4610000	4612000	On Madden now
4612000	4614000	And you're still doing the FIFA thing
4614000	4616000	So as long as you keep making
4616000	4618000	It profitable for people to steal those
4618000	4620000	Accounts and actually be able to sell
4620000	4622000	Stuff for real money
4622000	4624000	Then people are going to keep hacking those accounts
4624000	4626000	To try to make money off of them
4626000	4628000	This whole thing gets a nice hearty kiss my ass
4628000	4630000	From EA because
4630000	4632000	I mean, granted, okay
4632000	4634000	It's nice that you're like acknowledging something's
4634000	4636000	Going on now
4636000	4638000	Now that you're trying to sell the new copy
4638000	4640000	Of your game
4640000	4642000	You know, like, screw you for not
4642000	4644000	Having said that this was a problem
4644000	4646000	Before
4646000	4648000	Now you're just casually
4648000	4650000	Saying, oh yes, well we've learned from the past
4650000	4652000	And da da da da da
4652000	4654000	But the new one's going to be bigger and better
4654000	4656000	You are using
4656000	4658000	People who had their money stolen
4658000	4660000	As an excuse to plug
4660000	4662000	Your new game, that's what it feels like to me
4662000	4664000	Honestly, as somebody who was FIFA hacked
4664000	4666000	For all this
4666000	4668000	Some people frown on the use of the term
4668000	4670000	Hacking, whatever the fuck it was
4670000	4672000	Money was stolen and
4672000	4674000	Social engineering is still
4674000	4676000	A form of hacking, I guess
4676000	4678000	So they're going to add
4678000	4680000	More stuff to their marketplace so that
4680000	4682000	There's more things for people to buy
4682000	4684000	Is that what they've learned?
4684000	4686000	Hey, we've learned that we can get a lot of money
4686000	4688000	From people getting their accounts stolen
4688000	4690000	So we're just going to
4690000	4692000	Add more things that they can buy
4692000	4694000	Maybe some stuff for $500 instead
4694000	4696000	I don't know
4696000	4698000	How about putting some restrictions down
4698000	4700000	Like Blizzard does on some of the digital
4700000	4702000	Purchases when they're suspect
4702000	4704000	They don't go through for a few days
4704000	4706000	So that people have an easier time getting the money back
4706000	4708000	Or doing the back charges and all this stuff
4708000	4710000	For the suspect things
4710000	4712000	How about a little more about the security side
4712000	4714000	Of things and all that
4714000	4716000	Well
4716000	4718000	The reality is
4718000	4720000	Where we're at in this industry now
4720000	4722000	I just don't think that's possible
4722000	4724000	Anymore
4724000	4726000	I think it's stupid though that they have a $60 game
4726000	4728000	That they're doing all these microtransactions on
4728000	4730000	I think it's ridiculous too
4730000	4732000	But unfortunately people are buying them
4732000	4734000	So
4734000	4736000	It's working
4736000	4738000	We need to hunt these people out
4738000	4740000	If people
4740000	4742000	We shouldn't tell people what to spend their money on
4742000	4744000	If people
4744000	4746000	Legitimately are doing this
4746000	4748000	The other problem I have is that
4748000	4750000	Probably 80% of that was all from stolen money
4750000	4752000	But
4752000	4754000	Besides that
4754000	4756000	People can spend their money however they want
4756000	4758000	If they want to buy $60
4758000	4760000	For the game and then pay all this money
4760000	4762000	For the expansions
4762000	4764000	Let them spend their money on it if that's what makes them happy
4764000	4766000	Vote with your wallet
4766000	4768000	If you don't like it
4768000	4770000	Don't buy it
4770000	4772000	But the problem is
4772000	4774000	My wallet was stolen and then used to vote
4774000	4776000	That's a problem
4776000	4778000	Oh it's not our problem
4778000	4780000	It's not our issue
4780000	4782000	A year later
4782000	4784000	Oh we've taken steps to try and make sure that won't happen again
4784000	4786000	It's never our issue in the first place
4786000	4788000	Why would you need to take steps if there was not an issue with your
4788000	4790000	If it was all Microsoft
4790000	4792000	So I'd love to know
4792000	4794000	Moving on
4794000	4796000	Boy
4796000	4798000	Dark Soccer you're right
4798000	4800000	The news tonight just makes us
4800000	4802000	There's so much to get angry about this week
4802000	4804000	Let's close the show and go get Pinkberry
4804000	4806000	I thought you were having a healthy day
4806000	4808000	It's yogurt
4808000	4810000	Trust me
4810000	4812000	You'd want to get that delicious new chocolate
4812000	4814000	Hazelnut which isn't the best yogurt for you
4814000	4816000	Anyway
4816000	4818000	Ubisoft made an interesting statement this week
4818000	4820000	The CEO of Ubisoft
4820000	4822000	And I can't even say this name
4822000	4824000	Yves
4824000	4826000	Guillemot
4826000	4828000	Guillemot
4828000	4830000	Isn't the T usually silent
4830000	4832000	Came out and said
4832000	4834000	That PC retail games
4834000	4836000	Have a
4836000	4838000	Gigantic rate of piracy
4838000	4840000	And this was
4840000	4842000	Talking to games industry
4842000	4844000	At gamescom
4844000	4846000	He said that
4846000	4848000	Only about 5-7%
4848000	4850000	Of freemium players buy content
4850000	4852000	Because
4852000	4854000	Like the retail PC product
4854000	4856000	They have a quote
4856000	4858000	93-95% piracy rate
4858000	4860000	So he's basically saying retail PC games
4860000	4862000	93-95% piracy rate
4862000	4864000	Some other comments quote
4864000	4866000	We also take content which we've
4866000	4868000	Developed in the past graphics etc
4868000	4870000	And we can make cheaper games and improve them over time
4870000	4872000	What's very important is that we
4872000	4874000	Change the content and make it a better fit
4874000	4876000	To the customer as time goes on
4876000	4878000	But still throwing that statistic out there
4878000	4880000	93-95%
4880000	4882000	Piracy rate
4882000	4884000	That sounds really high
4884000	4886000	To a lot of people
4886000	4888000	Well
4888000	4890000	I'm not so sure
4890000	4892000	I think there might actually be some truth to that number
4892000	4894000	You know why I think there's truth to that number?
4894000	4896000	I think if you're looking at
4896000	4898000	Just the US
4898000	4900000	And Britain and Japan
4900000	4902000	And the rest of the UK
4902000	4904000	Where Ubisoft or wherever in the world
4904000	4906000	They have a presence where they sell games
4906000	4908000	Maybe that number seems high
4908000	4910000	But I mean
4910000	4912000	Piracy is fucking rampant in other parts
4912000	4914000	Of the world
4914000	4916000	I'm sure there's copies of these games
4916000	4918000	Easily available in the most populous
4918000	4920000	Country in the world
4920000	4922000	China! I'm sure there's tons of free copies
4922000	4924000	Of these games roaming around in China
4924000	4926000	But when you throw in the worldwide
4926000	4928000	Perspective into the mix
4928000	4930000	I could actually believe
4930000	4932000	The 93-95% piracy rate
4932000	4934000	But
4934000	4936000	Some people are still
4936000	4938000	Successful off that model
4938000	4940000	I'm not excusing it
4940000	4942000	I'm not saying it's okay
4942000	4944000	I'm just saying
4944000	4946000	Numbers can lie, you have to manipulate them
4946000	4948000	It's not like piracy is anything new
4948000	4950000	Or like it's never happened before
4950000	4952000	We've never had successful PC games
4952000	4954000	But before I believe any of those numbers
4954000	4956000	I'd have to see where the polls are
4956000	4958000	I mean where
4958000	4960000	I wouldn't trust
4960000	4962000	Anything
4962000	4964000	Numbers based on markets that wasn't made for
4964000	4966000	You're having a very I want to see the receipts
4966000	4968000	Kind of night
4968000	4970000	I am, well you know I'm like that anyway
4970000	4972000	I'm like that anyway
4972000	4974000	Loki what do you think of that number
4974000	4976000	93-95% piracy rate
4976000	4978000	Seems a little high
4978000	4980000	I don't know
4980000	4982000	Frisbee in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
4982000	4984000	Says 85% of statistics
4984000	4986000	Are made up on the spot
4986000	4988000	Especially in this industry brother
4988000	4990000	Alright one other note
4990000	4992000	About Ubisoft which is interesting
4992000	4994000	Because Ubisoft previously
4994000	4996000	Came out and said the game I Am Alive was never
4996000	4998000	Going to come out on the PC basically
4998000	5000000	Because there was no
5000000	5002000	Other version
5002000	5004000	Creative director Stanislaw Metra
5004000	5006000	Came out and said about I Am Alive
5006000	5008000	Quote we've heard loud and clear
5008000	5010000	That PC gamers are bitching about
5010000	5012000	There being no version for them
5014000	5016000	Wow
5016000	5018000	But are these people
5018000	5020000	Just making noise because there's no version
5020000	5022000	Or because it's a game they actually want to play
5022000	5024000	Would they buy it if we made it
5024000	5026000	It's hard because there's so much piracy
5026000	5028000	And so few people are paying for PC games
5028000	5030000	That we have to precisely weigh it up
5030000	5032000	Against the cost of making it
5032000	5034000	Perhaps it will only take 12 guys 3 months
5034000	5036000	To port the game to PC
5036000	5038000	It's a massive cost but it's still a cost
5038000	5040000	If only 50,000 people buy the game
5040000	5042000	Then it's not worth it
5042000	5044000	Only 50,000?
5044000	5046000	Well to
5046000	5048000	I have to say to his credit
5048000	5050000	He does make a point
5050000	5052000	If it takes 12 guys
5052000	5054000	3 months to port the game
5054000	5056000	Then using fractions
5056000	5058000	That would also be 3 guys 12 months
5058000	5060000	Or 3 annual salaries
5060000	5062000	And let's say these guys make
5062000	5064000	I don't know 75k a year
5064000	5066000	So to just pay those 3 guys
5066000	5068000	Is going to cost
5068000	5070000	225,000 dollars
5070000	5072000	And that's not even counting the cost to print the game
5072000	5074000	To market the game
5074000	5076000	To sell and all that stuff
5076000	5078000	Make it all download content you don't have to pay for materials
5078000	5080000	I don't know
5080000	5082000	But there's some people
5082000	5084000	That would be like
5084000	5086000	Viral marketing
5086000	5088000	I don't download games
5088000	5090000	Because I have to have the tangible copy
5090000	5092000	Then they lose out
5092000	5094000	You're a collector and all this shit
5094000	5096000	Why?
5096000	5098000	Hold on
5098000	5100000	I collect old shit Rob
5100000	5102000	I collect old things
5102000	5104000	I don't know it just doesn't make sense
5104000	5106000	This doesn't make sense coming from you
5106000	5108000	It really doesn't
5108000	5110000	My first 2 copies of Mass Effect were all download
5110000	5112000	The only reason I paid for a fiscal copy for 3
5112000	5114000	Was because I got them to price match
5114000	5116000	And I would have
5116000	5118000	I would have done the download copy if it had been the same
5118000	5120000	So
5120000	5122000	Let's make believe
5122000	5124000	I use Steam Rob
5124000	5126000	Let's make believe la la la
5126000	5128000	That the next Xbox and the next Playstation
5128000	5130000	And just making
5130000	5132000	Pulling shit out of my ass
5132000	5134000	The Wii U all go digital only
5134000	5136000	Digital download only
5136000	5138000	That's not a problem?
5138000	5140000	Not really
5140000	5142000	Honestly I'm going to say this is going into a little bit of my home stuff
5142000	5144000	We're thinking about downsizing
5144000	5146000	We have
5146000	5148000	Shelves that are taken up with DVDs
5148000	5150000	And with you know
5150000	5152000	Our current game collection
5152000	5154000	We have buckets of the old stuff
5154000	5156000	And the old stuff that's fine
5156000	5158000	But anything new
5158000	5160000	I really wouldn't mind having it
5160000	5162000	As a digital copy
5162000	5164000	I mean as long as I've got the software
5164000	5166000	The hardware to play it on then I wouldn't mind
5166000	5168000	You know it
5168000	5170000	It's less waste
5170000	5172000	Less um
5172000	5174000	It's green Rob it's green
5174000	5176000	It's green
5176000	5178000	I'm a hippie
5178000	5180000	One more news story and then the release dates
5180000	5182000	So how about some

5340000	5342000	Dirt of course is the racing series
5342000	5344000	So Codemasters is putting that out in Japan on the 30th

5488000	5490000	Alright just a couple more
5490000	5492000	news stories for you guys and then the classic
5492000	5494000	game of the week
5494000	5496000	But first, Loki
5496000	5498000	Well we were talking about Facebook and how they
5498000	5500000	want to shove advertisements down our throat
5500000	5502000	Well Sony has patented something to shove
5502000	5504000	advertisements down our throat
5504000	5506000	It's called a TV, no actually it's called
5506000	5508000	Interactive TV Ads
5508000	5510000	Which basically allow you
5510000	5512000	And I've actually kind of seen this
5512000	5514000	On some other websites, for example
5514000	5516000	One of the
5516000	5518000	interactive bits about it
5518000	5520000	Like a McDonald's ad or something like that
5520000	5522000	You have to say McDonald's to end commercial
5522000	5524000	And if you say McDonald's
5524000	5526000	Then the commercial ends, that type of thing
5526000	5528000	There's a website, as I talked
5528000	5530000	About a lot of Freddie Long
5530000	5532000	They do videos and stuff like that
5532000	5534000	They have a YouTube channel, but they have their own website
5534000	5536000	Called RocketJump and their video player that they have
5536000	5538000	On there has ads, but to skip
5538000	5540000	The ads, you have to type a word in
5540000	5542000	So you can
5542000	5544000	Watch the ad or you can type
5544000	5546000	Ford Focus
5546000	5548000	And it'll stop the ad
5548000	5550000	So it's kind of like
5550000	5552000	Okay, this way the
5552000	5554000	Advertiser knows this person saw
5554000	5556000	The ad and it's not just like clicking on skip
5556000	5558000	They know what the product is
5558000	5560000	And they're aware of
5560000	5562000	What you're trying to do
5562000	5564000	That's kind of cool
5564000	5566000	I mean
5566000	5568000	I just don't know what sort of
5568000	5570000	Things and games
5570000	5572000	Are going to require advertisements
5572000	5574000	Or commercials where I actually have to
5574000	5576000	Say something in order to
5576000	5578000	Have them go away, but
5578000	5580000	At least they have a way
5580000	5582000	For them to go away, I mean because if I could do that
5582000	5584000	On TV, it's like
5584000	5586000	You know, tampon commercial!
5586000	5588000	It's like, go
5588000	5590000	Go away!
5590000	5592000	No!
5592000	5594000	Um
5594000	5596000	Yeah, I wish I could do the same thing
5596000	5598000	With male enhancement
5598000	5600000	Commercials
5600000	5602000	Big penis!
5602000	5604000	They have a pill to give a guy a boner, but no cure for breast cancer
5604000	5606000	Just saying
5606000	5608000	Well
5608000	5610000	I don't want to get into it, to be fair
5610000	5612000	The Viagra was not
5612000	5614000	Made to do that
5614000	5616000	It was made for heart problems
5616000	5618000	But it just happened to have this side effect
5618000	5620000	Oh, how's your heart?
5620000	5622000	Boner!
5622000	5624000	That happens in the pharmaceutical industry
5624000	5626000	A lot of times
5626000	5628000	Well, the medication I was taking for
5628000	5630000	My chronic fatigue syndrome
5630000	5632000	Is actually what they all
5632000	5634000	Prescribe for narcolepsy
5634000	5636000	Isn't it kind of ironic though that they tell you that you shouldn't use Viagra
5636000	5638000	If you have heart problems?
5638000	5640000	You know, it's like
5640000	5642000	Well, because it was for a certain type of heart condition
5642000	5644000	I'm not a doctor, I'm not going to try to explain it
5644000	5646000	Anyhow
5646000	5648000	Some folks in chat says
5648000	5650000	Hitstun says adblock plus is made for
5650000	5652000	Invasive ads like this
5652000	5654000	D Singe says thank god for ad and flash blockers
5654000	5656000	That's true in browsers
5656000	5658000	But when you're talking about being built in the
5658000	5660000	Consoles, and you're assuming
5660000	5662000	This is going to be like streaming stuff
5662000	5664000	Like I'm watching ad supported things
5664000	5666000	Which, I mean, it's ad supported
5666000	5668000	It's like if I'm watching TV
5668000	5670000	And it's free, if you're on Hulu
5670000	5672000	If Sony's about to do something like the Kinect
5672000	5674000	Where they're putting a microphone in your living room
5674000	5676000	You know, because think about it
5676000	5678000	Microsoft's going to incorporate this into the Kinect right now
5678000	5680000	Can you imagine if the Kinect would
5680000	5682000	Interrupt you, for example, like you're talking about
5682000	5684000	Man, I wish I
5684000	5686000	Where do you want to eat tonight?
5686000	5688000	Hey guys, were you talking
5688000	5690000	About eating somewhere?
5690000	5692000	Oh my god, that's terrible, can you imagine
5692000	5694000	We're sitting here doing the show and Jamie's like
5694000	5696000	Rob, let's just end the show and go to Pinkberry
5696000	5698000	And then suddenly up on the TV and all
5698000	5700000	Did you know Pinkberry's latest flavor is chocolate
5700000	5702000	Hazelnut
5702000	5704000	We laugh about that now, but that is the future
5704000	5706000	No, no, no
5706000	5708000	No, we have to put our foot
5708000	5710000	Down, there's like
5710000	5712000	The whole big brother is watching you
5712000	5714000	Here's the thing though
5714000	5716000	But that's targeted advertising
5716000	5718000	That's targeted advertising
5718000	5720000	You want to know about Pinkberry versus like
5720000	5722000	You want to know about natural male enhancement
5722000	5724000	Or you want to know about
5724000	5726000	I don't need natural male enhancement
5726000	5728000	I have natural male enhancement
5730000	5732000	What's not natural about
5732000	5734000	You know, naked boobies
5734000	5736000	That's natural male enhancement
5736000	5738000	Her turns you on
5738000	5740000	Although I like boobies, but you know
5742000	5744000	They should have a strip club
5744000	5746000	Named natural male enhancement
5746000	5748000	That would be pretty awesome
5750000	5752000	Alright
5752000	5754000	R.D.G. Singe in chat says
5754000	5756000	I did that trick to block MS ad servers
5756000	5758000	From pushing ads on my Xbox system
5758000	5760000	But every now and then they get through
5760000	5762000	Would be nice to know what to update
5762000	5764000	You know
5764000	5766000	We have ads on vognetwork.com
5766000	5768000	And you know
5768000	5770000	It isn't free to produce this stuff
5770000	5772000	We pay for a lot of this shit out of pocket
5772000	5774000	Because it's our hobby
5774000	5776000	And it's what we like to do
5776000	5778000	But I just would really appreciate it
5778000	5780000	If you like the shows at vognetwork.com
5780000	5782000	Just put it on the whitelist
5782000	5784000	For fuck's sake
5784000	5786000	We really tried to design things
5786000	5788000	To not be invasive
5788000	5790000	Because we know like you guys
5790000	5792000	We don't want to be invasive
5792000	5794000	You're blocking the little guys too
5794000	5796000	Click an ad every once in a while
5796000	5798000	Visit the site
5798000	5800000	Help us out
5800000	5802000	You can click the ad and then close the page
5802000	5804000	Alright
5804000	5806000	Moving on
5806000	5808000	Technically I think encouraging people to do that
5808000	5810000	Is like a violation of the whatever
5810000	5812000	Don't be suspicious when you do it
5812000	5814000	They know that's what's going on
5814000	5816000	Moving on
5816000	5818000	One more thing
5818000	5820000	Maybe this is a little more exciting
5820000	5822000	This is a ranty and depressing
5822000	5824000	And sad segment of
5824000	5826000	Orange Lounge Radio
5826000	5828000	Well we're about to be off for a week
5828000	5830000	With something a little better
5830000	5832000	That is that Harmonix is apparently looking for
5832000	5834000	A combat designer
5834000	5836000	What?
5836000	5838000	Harmonix of course makes rock band
5838000	5840000	Dance central
5840000	5842000	Yes apparently they've put up a job listing
5842000	5844000	And you can find it on Gamasutra
5844000	5846000	That is looking for a quote real time single player
5846000	5848000	Combat experience for a brand new
5848000	5850000	IP on next generation hardware
5850000	5852000	Bummer it's a brand new IP
5852000	5854000	Because I was thinking the next Dance Central might
5854000	5856000	Have like, you got served
5856000	5858000	I was thinking everybody's kung fu fighting
5858000	5860000	Or you know
5860000	5862000	When you're a jet you know you're a jet
5862000	5864000	You know what it's capoeira game
5864000	5866000	Who knows
5866000	5868000	Anything's possible
5868000	5870000	In addition to finishing development
5870000	5872000	On rock band Blitz and Dance Central 3
5872000	5874000	Harmonix is actively developing multiple new IPs
5874000	5876000	On next generation hardware
5876000	5878000	And looking for the best and most experienced devs
5878000	5880000	Out there to join us
5880000	5882000	So obviously speculate away
5882000	5884000	What the hell could this be
5884000	5886000	You know a lot of people making up their own ideas
5886000	5888000	But I guess it's exciting at least they confirm
5888000	5890000	We're working on a brand new IP
5890000	5892000	Is at least something I pull out of that
5892000	5894000	So yay new ideas right Dark Sakura
5894000	5896000	Possibly it's Harmonix
5896000	5898000	But it's real time
5898000	5900000	Single player combat
5900000	5902000	It's gonna be another fucking strategy game
5902000	5904000	But it's I don't
5904000	5906000	Harmonix down as a company that would do
5906000	5908000	Quote another fucking strategy game
5908000	5910000	You know what I mean
5910000	5912000	Like Harmonix has a pretty good record of being innovative
5912000	5914000	I'll believe it when I see it
5914000	5916000	I am the queen of jade today
5916000	5918000	I wanna see the receipts
5918000	5920000	I just think it's ironic that a music game company
5920000	5922000	Is working on an action game
5922000	5924000	That could be cool Tigerclaw in chat says
5924000	5926000	Maybe Harmonix is working on a battle of the bands game
5926000	5928000	You're in a band and you actually have to battle each other
5928000	5930000	By hitting each other with musical instruments
5930000	5932000	That's been done on the Wii
5932000	5934000	It's terrible and it was called battle of the bands
5934000	5936000	And they literally had it where
5936000	5938000	Your band equipment would turn into a mini gun
5938000	5940000	Tigerclaw is gonna get taken to court
5940000	5942000	Sued for 1.2 billion dollars
5942000	5944000	It's terrible
5944000	5946000	Battle of the bands on the Wii
5946000	5948000	If you wanna have battles right away
5948000	5950000	Yakuza 5 will have dance battles
5950000	5952000	Cause you know
5952000	5954000	Don't we just love minigame dancing
5954000	5956000	In every fucking game
5956000	5958000	So Yakuza 5
5958000	5960000	Will have
5960000	5962000	Well granted Yakuza has a lot of shit going on
5962000	5964000	So
5964000	5966000	Maybe this isn't completely out of character
5966000	5968000	For the Yakuza series
5968000	5970000	But whatever they are doing
5970000	5972000	Dance battles
5972000	5974000	And Yakuza 5
5974000	5976000	One of the subplots is about the adopted daughter
5976000	5978000	Of Kazuma Kiryu
5978000	5980000	It's Haruka
5980000	5982000	She's trying to become an idol
5982000	5984000	So you'll do these dance battles
5984000	5986000	It's a little rhythm game
5986000	5988000	I could explain more about it
5988000	5990000	Let's hope that Harmonics isn't working on
5990000	5992000	A step up revolution
5992000	5994000	Game cause
5994000	5996000	She wants to be a pop idol so that her song will be featured
5996000	5998000	In the newest anime put out by Gainax
5998000	6000000	Not really
6000000	6002000	Can't wait
6002000	6004000	They have karaoke
6004000	6006000	And sleeping dogs
6006000	6008000	Let's travel to a time when we didn't get so fucking mad
6008000	6010000	About everything
6010000	6012000	Except this game, he got really mad at one of the bosses
6012000	6014000	I got mad when
6014000	6016000	Nintendo Power arrived late
6016000	6018000	Which by the way
6018000	6020000	More on that in part B
6020000	6022000	But first up
6022000	6024000	The classic game of the week
6024000	6026000	Where Dark Sakura is going to
6026000	6028000	Go into the gaming vault
6028000	6030000	Find a game that she thinks
6030000	6032000	Hey
6032000	6034000	If you're super depressed about all these studios closing
6034000	6036000	Why not play some of the greats from the past
6036000	6038000	Yeah if you're depressed
6038000	6040000	Pretend you're a ninja
6040000	6042000	And slice shit to death
6042000	6044000	And blow shit up with ninja bombs
6044000	6046000	Go into denial
6046000	6048000	Yeah go into denial
6048000	6050000	The game of the week is called Shadow of the Ninja
6050000	6052000	Or as it was known in Japan
6052000	6054000	Yami no Shigo
6054000	6056000	Okay I'm going to mispronounce this
6056000	6058000	It's Yami no Shigotonin Kage
6058000	6060000	Which is
6060000	6062000	Dark Professional Shadow
6062000	6064000	That's actually a cooler name
6064000	6066000	So basically it's a futuristic
6066000	6068000	Ninja themed side scroll
6068000	6070000	Arcade action type game
6070000	6072000	And I am trying to get the
6072000	6074000	Audio up but um
6074000	6076000	Remember when Natsume didn't do Harvest Moon?
6076000	6078000	No actually I don't
6078000	6080000	This was a game by Natsume
6080000	6082000	Um
6082000	6084000	It came out in Japan in 1990
6084000	6086000	And came out in North America in 1991
6086000	6088000	The PAL version was published by Taito
6088000	6090000	Under the name Blue Shadow
6090000	6092000	Which is actually a pretty cool name
6092000	6094000	Oh cause he's blue
6094000	6096000	Well yeah but also there was this big thing
6096000	6098000	In the 80's and early 90's in
6098000	6100000	England where you couldn't
6100000	6102000	Have Ninja in the title
6102000	6104000	Like for example Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
6104000	6106000	Was Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles
6106000	6108000	Rob did you know that?
6108000	6110000	I did know that
6110000	6112000	Well Natsume also did a Game Boy version
6112000	6114000	Of this however
6114000	6116000	It actually got picked up by
6116000	6118000	Tecmo and they tried to make it into
6118000	6120000	A Ninja Gaiden game called Ninja Gaiden
6120000	6122000	Shadow which is sort of half Shadow
6122000	6124000	Of the Ninja and half Ninja Gaiden
6124000	6126000	And 100% kind of crap
6126000	6128000	Maybe about 85% crap
6128000	6130000	So
6130000	6132000	Basically the story of the game is that
6132000	6134000	In 2029
6134000	6136000	The evil dictator
6136000	6138000	Emperor Garuda
6138000	6140000	Which means eagle by the way did you know that?
6140000	6142000	What?
6142000	6144000	Well it actually
6144000	6146000	In Hindi it means eagle
6146000	6148000	I learned that from doing yoga
6148000	6150000	Has taken over the USA
6150000	6152000	And made a
6152000	6154000	A big
6154000	6156000	Stronghold in the middle of the nations
6156000	6158000	Largest city
6158000	6160000	So these two Ninja Hayate and Kaede
6160000	6162000	Have to go
6162000	6164000	Infiltrate the Stronghold and kill him
6164000	6166000	To death
6166000	6168000	So it is
6168000	6170000	Up to two players simultaneous
6170000	6172000	Or you can pick one or the other
6172000	6174000	Like I said Hayate or Kaede
6174000	6176000	And
6176000	6178000	You can
6178000	6180000	There's actually no difference
6180000	6182000	Between who you play really
6182000	6184000	But they just look differently
6184000	6186000	Um
6186000	6188000	And uh
6188000	6190000	You uh
6190000	6192000	Basically you can run
6192000	6194000	You can crouch, you can climb ladders
6194000	6196000	You can actually hang from
6196000	6198000	Certain areas overhead
6198000	6200000	Including a lot of the moving platforms you can do that too
6200000	6202000	Um
6202000	6204000	And you actually can get
6204000	6206000	You can build up your weapon over time too
6206000	6208000	They have special attacks
6208000	6210000	One of them is a thunderstorm
6210000	6212000	That will just damage all the on screen enemies
6212000	6214000	But it takes half your life to do it
6214000	6216000	It actually is quite possible to play this whole game
6216000	6218000	Without using any of that
6218000	6220000	Um your default weapon is katana
6220000	6222000	Um however you can also get um
6222000	6224000	Kusarigama
6224000	6226000	It has a longer range but the um
6226000	6228000	Katana will actually get a full screen range
6228000	6230000	Once it's fully powered up and
6230000	6232000	Everyone really likes it better
6232000	6234000	You also can get some limited use items
6234000	6236000	You get shuriken or um
6236000	6238000	What my husband calls the ninja bomb
6238000	6240000	Which is
6240000	6242000	Just some sort of hand grenade
6242000	6244000	Um
6244000	6246000	And then once you use up your
6246000	6248000	You know number of those
6248000	6250000	You actually go back to either using the um
6250000	6252000	Katana or the Kusarigama
6252000	6254000	For anyone who doesn't know what that is
6254000	6256000	It's a hook on a rope
6256000	6258000	Um it has five levels
6258000	6260000	Um totaling 16 stages
6260000	6262000	The first four are in three stages
6262000	6264000	The final one is in two
6264000	6266000	And uh you have your bosses
6266000	6268000	You have your mini bosses
6268000	6270000	And uh
6270000	6272000	You um when you beat a boss
6272000	6274000	It explodes but the explosion heals you
6274000	6276000	And you can
6276000	6278000	That way you can carry over life into the next level
6278000	6280000	If your um
6280000	6282000	Your game uh
6282000	6284000	Your game will actually be over if you lose
6284000	6286000	All of your energy and you only have
6286000	6288000	Five continues um
6288000	6290000	If you have two players in the game your continues are shared
6290000	6292000	So I hope you play with someone who doesn't suck
6292000	6294000	But I mean the game was
6294000	6296000	Really awesome when it came out
6296000	6298000	And I mean just
6298000	6300000	Sit and watch a play through of this
6300000	6302000	Or play it yourself if you've got it
6302000	6304000	It's got neat effects
6304000	6306000	Great animation for a NES game
6306000	6308000	The music, Bob Trump's the music if you don't mind
6316000	6318000	The music is really good
6318000	6320000	And it's totally
6320000	6322000	Worth everyone's attention
6322000	6324000	It has an old Mega Man feel to it a little bit
6324000	6326000	A little bit
6326000	6328000	In fact there are actually these little enemies
6328000	6330000	That you know slide across the floor
6330000	6332000	Slowly but when you're on the floor they move faster
6332000	6334000	You know it totally made me think of some Mega Man 2 enemies
6334000	6336000	Let me um go to part
6336000	6338000	One here of the little series here
6338000	6340000	Just to um
6340000	6342000	Get like the first level music
6344000	6346000	I guess they're waiting for
6346000	6356000	Here's one two
6356000	6358000	It's pretty cool
6358000	6360000	It's a really neat game
6360000	6362000	And on top of that you can find it really inexpensive
6362000	6364000	In a used game store
6364000	6366000	It's a game that I think everyone should have in their collection
6366000	6368000	Yeah the American box art
6368000	6370000	Is stupendously hokey looking
6370000	6372000	It's like ooh action game
6372000	6374000	With a couple of
6374000	6376000	Ninja who look you know uh
6376000	6378000	Amazingly white

6440000	6442000	If you want to know my favorite TV show of all time
6442000	6444000	Of all time ever and it's on

6452000	6454000	30 minute episodes what when it's
6454000	6456000	Cut out the commercials like 23 minutes

6458000	6460000	600 minutes of your life
6460000	6462000	That's what you should do Labor Day weekend make it a point
6462000	6464000	To watch every episode of Strangers with Candy
6464000	6466000	Because it's the greatest sitcom
6466000	6468000	I've ever seen in my life it's not even really a
6468000	6470000	Sitcom but it's
6470000	6472000	Look Steven Colbert's in it before he had
6472000	6474000	That Colbert rapport and he's
6474000	6476000	He is my absolute inspiration as an
6476000	6478000	Educator
6478000	6480000	Where's your permission slip Mr.
6480000	6482000	Noblet? Shut your dirty little

6518000	6520000	On some games that we've been needing to
6520000	6522000	Catch up on or Marathon Strangers
6522000	6524000	With Candy one of the two
6524000	6526000	Alright let's get into some rapid
6526000	6528000	Fire news some quick
6528000	6530000	News stories for you guys before we get to
6530000	6532000	The Facebook and Google question of the week
6532000	6534000	Or the FUGL question of the week
6534000	6536000	First off Loki Microsoft wants to let you know
6536000	6538000	That the Kinect has dropped in price to
6538000	6540000	$109.99 that's $40
6540000	6542000	Cheaper than it was
6542000	6544000	When it first came out
6544000	6546000	The games being better though
6546000	6548000	Maybe not so much
6548000	6550000	But hey
6550000	6552000	That's pretty inexpensive
6552000	6554000	So check it out
6554000	6556000	If you want to connect I guess
6556000	6558000	The Humble Bundle for
6558000	6560000	Android they've added some new stuff to it
6560000	6562000	If you pledge over the average
6562000	6564000	Price which
6564000	6566000	Right now I have no idea what the price is
6566000	6568000	Because I did not look
6568000	6570000	But it's probably under $10
6570000	6572000	6.71 you can't beat that
6572000	6574000	If you pledge $6.71
6574000	6576000	Not only will you get the games
6576000	6578000	That they were offering which were Field Runners
6578000	6580000	Bit.Trip Beat
6580000	6582000	Space Chem and Uplink
6582000	6584000	And you would have previously unlocked
6584000	6586000	Spirits but you also will now
6586000	6588000	Unlock World of Goo, Osmose
6588000	6590000	Anomaly and Edge
6590000	6592000	So all those games available
6592000	6594000	For Android and for PC
6594000	6596000	They're multi platform so you get the
6596000	6598000	Steam codes as well as the
6598000	6600000	DRM free downloads
6600000	6602000	For all that stuff
6602000	6604000	Actually I should
6604000	6606000	Correct myself
6606000	6608000	To get the Steam codes you have to pay another
6608000	6610000	You have to pay over $1 so
6610000	6612000	Obviously if you're paying over the average
6612000	6614000	You would get the Steam codes
6614000	6616000	Check them out! Sounds awesome
6616000	6618000	And then
6618000	6620000	Last but not least
6620000	6622000	That wonderful Scott Pilgrim online
6622000	6624000	Multiplayer DLC that was also
6624000	6626000	Gonna unlock an additional character
6626000	6628000	And what not
6628000	6630000	Yeah it got delayed to the fall
6630000	6632000	Womp womp
6632000	6634000	I don't know why but
6634000	6636000	That's unfortunate
6636000	6638000	And I guess the Playstation Network version
6638000	6640000	Will also release during that time frame as well
6642000	6644000	Alright moving on with some other
6644000	6646000	Stories
6646000	6648000	I wish I could
6648000	6650000	But my internet is slowing down
6650000	6652000	And I don't have to slow down
6652000	6654000	Something's up with our web
6654000	6656000	We suddenly just lost our web
6656000	6658000	Mine just plain hasn't worked today
6658000	6660000	I don't know what's going on
6660000	6662000	But um
6662000	6664000	Awkward pause
6664000	6666000	I wonder if we just had a stream
6666000	6668000	Hiccup because of that
6668000	6670000	Let me look
6670000	6672000	No we're still connected
6672000	6674000	The joys and pains
6674000	6676000	Of doing live radio that's alright I have a few things
6676000	6678000	Here for you guys
6678000	6680000	Mashihiro Sakurai you know that name because he's the
6680000	6682000	Director of Super Smash Brothers
6682000	6684000	He mentioned at the CEDEC
6684000	6686000	Developer conference in this past week
6686000	6688000	That the Smash Brothers game on Wii U
6688000	6690000	And 3DS will have new and exciting
6690000	6692000	Moves for existing characters
6692000	6694000	He also mentioned there will be
6694000	6696000	Of course a bunch of new characters
6696000	6698000	Now will come the epically
6698000	6700000	Long tease of which characters
6700000	6702000	Will be there and which characters
6702000	6704000	Won't be there and so on and so on
6704000	6706000	But uh sounds like they are gonna
6706000	6708000	Expand the move set a little bit I'm wondering if that
6708000	6710000	Means there's gonna be more than two buttons from here
6710000	6712000	On out for Smash Brothers that could be interesting
6712000	6714000	Speculate away
6714000	6716000	Because lots of people already
6716000	6718000	Are still button Mash Brothers
6718000	6720000	I bet um this
6720000	6722000	Is gonna piss some people off
6722000	6724000	This is coming from
6724000	6726000	A former 3D modeler that worked
6726000	6728000	At Rare on games like Donkey Kong 64
6728000	6730000	Jet Force Gemini
6730000	6732000	And so forth apparently
6732000	6734000	Rare did want to do a new Killer
6734000	6736000	Instinct game but Microsoft
6736000	6738000	Was more interested in broadening the Xbox
6738000	6740000	User base quote the same
6740000	6742000	Game every Rare fan wants to see and that's
6742000	6744000	Killer Instinct 3 we all wanted to
6744000	6746000	Make Killer Instinct 3 but Microsoft
6746000	6748000	Was more interested in broadening their demographic
6748000	6750000	Than making another fighting game
6750000	6752000	So it never got made I doubt
6752000	6754000	It never will
6754000	6756000	Microsoft F you
6756000	6758000	Alright this last story isn't loading
6758000	6760000	For me but I remember it pretty well
6760000	6762000	Anyway cause this is another story that made a lot of people
6762000	6764000	Say F you
6764000	6766000	That is that they are making
6766000	6768000	Remember that whole countdown they were doing
6768000	6770000	For The World Ends With You
6770000	6772000	And a lot of people were like oh yay it's gonna be a
6772000	6774000	Sequel yay
6774000	6776000	Nope no sir it's an
6776000	6778000	IOS port of the game is coming out
6778000	6780000	Next week and I believe the
6780000	6782000	Price on it is $20
6782000	6784000	Square Enix likes to
6784000	6786000	Charge more money for their games than 99 cents
6786000	6788000	To be fair they don't shove
6788000	6790000	The free to play model down
6790000	6792000	Your throat make you buy power ups and all that
6792000	6794000	So at least for your 20 bucks
6794000	6796000	You're getting a well rounded game and I gotta say
6796000	6798000	Some of their iPad
6798000	6800000	Games and such look great like their
6800000	6802000	Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy 2 ports
6802000	6804000	That they did on the original iPhone kind of before there was
6804000	6806000	iPad looked great on the iPhone
6806000	6808000	So you know
6808000	6810000	I'm sure the game will look really good
6810000	6812000	But I don't know
6812000	6814000	Again the lack of tactile controls
6814000	6816000	I think is what frustrates a lot of people
6816000	6818000	Like we don't really want to see
6818000	6820000	Games like The World Ends With You get ported
6820000	6822000	To IOS because touch
6822000	6824000	Controls kind of suck on a lot of these games
6824000	6826000	At least I know that's what frustrates me
6826000	6828000	Yeah and then um
6828000	6830000	20 bucks is still pretty expensive
6830000	6832000	For anything that's on
6832000	6834000	You know IOS
6834000	6836000	I think for that reason because it's you know
6836000	6838000	You're kind of
6838000	6840000	Gimping the game a little bit
6840000	6842000	Not everything is 99 cents I was just looking at iPad
6842000	6844000	Apps today and some of the better selling
6844000	6846000	iPad apps are the official Apple
6846000	6848000	You know versions of
6848000	6850000	What is it Keynote is like their PowerPoint
6850000	6852000	Type thing is one of their top sellers
6852000	6854000	It's $9.99
6854000	6856000	GarageBand does very well, it's a $5 app
6856000	6858000	So there's you know
6858000	6860000	$5 and $9.99 versus $20
6860000	6862000	Is still a bit much
6862000	6864000	Well
6864000	6866000	But how much did it cost on the DS?
6866000	6868000	Probably closer to
6868000	6870000	$35
6870000	6872000	Technically it was free
6872000	6874000	Well it's been out for a while now
6874000	6876000	I mean you can buy on the DS for
6876000	6878000	Probably less than 20 bucks
6878000	6880000	Now that I'd agree with yes
6880000	6882000	So that's my issue
6882000	6884000	With that is if you know it's been
6884000	6886000	Out for a while I mean they can put it at 20 bucks
6886000	6888000	But it doesn't mean everyone's gonna buy it for that
6888000	6890000	Well look I'm gonna admit and this might like
6890000	6892000	Ruffle some feathers or whatever but
6892000	6894000	I actually didn't play this game on DS
6894000	6896000	I just didn't get around to it you know
6896000	6898000	We don't have time to play every single game
6898000	6900000	So um
6900000	6902000	I don't know if I would necessarily go out of my way
6902000	6904000	To check it out on IOS
6904000	6906000	But I know there are some fans of this game
6906000	6908000	And are really hoping it will result in a sequel
6908000	6910000	It does make me think oh I need to go back
6910000	6912000	And try the one on DS so
6912000	6914000	We'll see and um
6914000	6916000	Shima panic in our chat room
6916000	6918000	Says the world ends with you DS
6918000	6920000	Was $40 at launch
6920000	6922000	Thank you
6922000	6924000	$40 so I think mine's actually
6924000	6926000	Still in my DS makes 20 not seem so bad
6928000	6930000	Alright uh let's move on
6930000	6932000	Dark Sakura
6932000	6934000	Well um XSeed put out an announcement
6934000	6936000	That Ragnarok Odyssey is gonna have two
6936000	6938000	Editions to choose from
6938000	6940000	The first one is a standard that's only the game
6940000	6942000	And then the mercenary edition that comes with the soundtrack
6942000	6944000	A mercenary guide that's sort of
6944000	6946000	An art book and strategy guide
6946000	6948000	And monster cards um
6948000	6950000	10 random ones the standard edition is
6950000	6952000	$40 and the mercenary edition is
6952000	6954000	$50 so depends on how much money
6954000	6956000	You wanna spend for stuff that'll collect dust later
6956000	6958000	Don't know
6958000	6960000	And for fans of DS
6960000	6962000	There is a song list out for
6962000	6964000	Dance Central 3

7016000	7018000	Freaking dancing on my bed to Disco Inferno
7018000	7020000	Any song that has
7020000	7022000	Burn Baby Burn in the lyrics
7022000	7024000	Totally down for it
7024000	7026000	Around the World
7026000	7028000	is gonna be awesome
7028000	7030000	Oh and last but
7030000	7032000	never least
7032000	7034000	There is a survival game coming up by
7034000	7036000	Can I read a comment from Stan
7036000	7038000	in our chat room? What band would call themselves
7038000	7040000	Anthrax?
7040000	7042000	Well no one ever accused
7042000	7044000	metal bands of having much in the way of intelligence
7044000	7046000	They're probably
7046000	7048000	on heroin
7048000	7050000	True statement
7050000	7052000	Allegedly
7052000	7054000	I like Anthrax actually
7054000	7056000	Who doesn't like Anthrax
7056000	7058000	But you have to be in a certain mood
7058000	7060000	for Anthrax
7060000	7062000	Anthrax is just fun, anyway
7062000	7064000	Anyway
7064000	7066000	The developer
7066000	7068000	Clay Entertainment that did Shank
7068000	7070000	Is doing a survival game called Don't
7070000	7072000	Starve that has a closed beta
7072000	7074000	available to those who pre-order the game
7074000	7076000	for a whopping $7
7076000	7078000	I hear the closed beta
7078000	7080000	is in Africa
7080000	7082000	Africa?
7082000	7084000	Because that's a game that they play all the time
7084000	7086000	Don't Starve
7086000	7088000	Anyway
7088000	7090000	It's gonna be $15 when it comes
7090000	7092000	to Steam so you're pretty much getting it for
7092000	7094000	77% off if you
7094000	7096000	order it ahead of time
7096000	7098000	The demo is on the official
7098000	7100000	site so you can give it a try
7100000	7102000	for free. It's about a
7102000	7104000	gentleman scientist who has to go to the
7104000	7106000	wilderness world of a demon
7106000	7108000	and he just doesn't starve
7108000	7110000	So it's like Tokyo Jungle with
7110000	7112000	Minecraft
7112000	7114000	I guess
7114000	7116000	I'm gonna buy it $7 why not
7116000	7118000	I can afford that
7118000	7120000	Sounds cool
7120000	7122000	Is that it?
7122000	7124000	Indeed. You don't have to break things
7124000	7126000	It's done
7126000	7128000	Alright
7128000	7130000	Let's travel to the
7130000	7132000	FUGL question of the week
7132000	7134000	What is the FUGL question of the week?
7134000	7136000	Facebook and Google Plus
7136000	7138000	Slam them together and you get FUGL
7146000	7148000	Which I know is ironic considering the first
7148000	7150000	half of our show but look
7150000	7152000	We've never been one to turn away
7152000	7154000	ways to participate with our listeners
7154000	7156000	and this is just one other way to participate with listeners
7156000	7158000	But I'm gonna start with Google Plus
7158000	7160000	Here's the question
7160000	7162000	Actually we got more
7162000	7164000	answers on Google Plus than we usually do
7164000	7166000	I know look I had to scroll
7166000	7168000	to see them all
7168000	7170000	Here it is on
7170000	7172000	FUGL question of the week
7172000	7174000	This is about the world ends with you
7174000	7176000	getting announced for iOS to extremely missed reaction
7176000	7178000	What game would you actually
7178000	7180000	like to see ported to mobile
7180000	7182000	phones, iOS, Android, whatever
7182000	7184000	your choice is or would you
7184000	7186000	be perfectly happy if we never had another
7186000	7188000	port of a classic game again
7188000	7190000	And of course we expect the listeners
7190000	7192000	to give us a little bit of why
7192000	7194000	Canaxium said anything
7194000	7196000	puzzle strategy or turn based
7196000	7198000	The controls wouldn't suffer much which is important
7198000	7200000	for the smartphone transition
7200000	7202000	Those kinds of games would also be a lot easier
7202000	7204000	to set aside with little notice
7204000	7206000	Revenge of the Titans would be a blast
7206000	7208000	Redertainment
7208000	7210000	has a very get off my
7210000	7212000	lawn approach. What happened to the good
7212000	7214000	old days when phones were phones
7214000	7216000	music players were music players and gas
7216000	7218000	cost under $2
7220000	7222000	That being said, Portal
7222000	7224000	I would like to see the classic game Portal
7224000	7226000	ported to mobiles just to see
7226000	7228000	the spectacular ways that game would crash
7228000	7230000	my phone and drain my battery like a
7230000	7232000	vampire. Classic? Well, yes
7232000	7234000	it is now a classic
7234000	7236000	No
7236000	7238000	Ok, 10 years from now
7238000	7240000	In 10 years, yeah, it'll be a classic
7240000	7242000	Alright, maybe I shouldn't have said classic
7242000	7244000	game in the question because I think Portal
7244000	7246000	is a fine answer. But anyway, also
7246000	7248000	Tetris, not the version available
7248000	7250000	now that required swiping. A version
7250000	7252000	of Tetris with button based controls that I can
7252000	7254000	play on the go seems like a great idea to me
7254000	7256000	Yes, I remember the Tetris DS exists
7256000	7258000	but I want to play competitively and my
7258000	7260000	Wi-Fi at home sucks
7260000	7262000	Jim replied saying
7262000	7264000	I would love to see a port of Deja Vu
7264000	7266000	utilizing the touch controls of course
7266000	7268000	Remember those old ass PC
7268000	7270000	games like Shadow, was it
7270000	7272000	Shadowrun? No, Shadowrun is the other game
7272000	7274000	Shadowkeep
7274000	7276000	I'm the one that likes Loom, so
7276000	7278000	No, I remember, but Deja Vu
7278000	7280000	and then there was another one, The Uninvited or something like that
7280000	7282000	there was a whole trilogy of them that was on
7282000	7284000	the NES and they were originally Mac games
7284000	7286000	if I remember right. Shadowgate
7286000	7288000	Shadowgate was freaking hard
7288000	7290000	God
7290000	7292000	Shadowgate had an amazing
7292000	7294000	soundtrack though, oh my god
7294000	7296000	I seriously, have you ever done Shadowgate as the classic game of the week
7296000	7298000	if not, you really need to think about it. I never really was
7298000	7300000	a fan of Shadowgate to be honest
7300000	7302000	I'm doing it a week you're gone then
7302000	7304000	I'll do it, I mean
7304000	7306000	I know a lot of people like it
7306000	7308000	Can I play some epic music from Shadowgate real quick? Sure
7308000	7310000	I just love the music of Shadowgate
7312000	7314000	I like this music
7314000	7316000	But then like, the death music
7316000	7318000	was really freaky
7320000	7322000	Like, shit
7322000	7324000	I died
7324000	7326000	Harpsichord furnace
7326000	7328000	Anyhow
7328000	7330000	Moving on
7330000	7332000	to Rababababa
7332000	7334000	Says Donkey Kong for iCade
7334000	7336000	It was the original April Fools joke
7336000	7338000	and it sold me on the iCade
7338000	7340000	If Nintendo ever released on
7340000	7342000	iOS phones, it should start with their
7342000	7344000	80s arcade games
7344000	7346000	Let's see
7346000	7348000	ActDeft replied, despite me hating
7348000	7350000	on the iOS port of The World Ends With You
7350000	7352000	I would really like to see Viva Pinata
7352000	7354000	on mobile. The game is great to play
7354000	7356000	for short amounts and it will keep you really occupied
7356000	7358000	playing it. Interesting, he takes an approach
7358000	7360000	that's not about controls, but about the way
7360000	7362000	we play games
7362000	7364000	And maybe a game like Viva Pinata in short
7364000	7366000	bursts is better suited for
7366000	7368000	mobile phones
7368000	7370000	How would you feel about Animal Crossing on mobile phones?
7370000	7372000	Monitoring my village
7374000	7376000	That would be crack
7376000	7378000	It would be, wouldn't it?
7378000	7380000	So
7380000	7382000	Alright, let's see
7382000	7384000	Oh, I'm just looking at our chat room
7384000	7386000	Dungeon Buster agrees, Shadowgate rocked
7386000	7388000	Chigurh said, we have a copy of Shadowgate
7388000	7390000	It was awesome
7390000	7392000	Hitstun says, it's a sad
7392000	7394000	thing that your frugal questions have come to
7394000	7396000	an end here
7396000	7398000	That's a death joke
7398000	7400000	Alright, moving on
7400000	7402000	Tiara, hi Tiara
7402000	7404000	Geek-Life.com, wonderful site
7404000	7406000	Please visit it. Tiara from Geek-Life
7406000	7408000	replies and says
7408000	7410000	This is Facebook now, by the way
7410000	7412000	They're already on every other
7412000	7414000	type of console ever, so I'd love an
7414000	7416000	iOS port of Final Fantasy 4 and Final
7416000	7418000	Fantasy 6. I have the original
7418000	7420000	Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy Tactics on
7420000	7422000	my iPhone, and I love being able to play
7422000	7424000	them when I'm on the subway or looking for something
7424000	7426000	quiet to do while my hubby is working on law school
7426000	7428000	stuff. It's great having old classics
7428000	7430000	that I love at my fingertips without
7430000	7432000	having to carry around anything larger than my phone
7432000	7434000	You know, Tiara, they did, you might
7434000	7436000	already know this, but they did a really good port of Final
7436000	7438000	Fantasy 3, the DS version
7438000	7440000	that's on the iPhone
7440000	7442000	I've been playing that. It's a pretty decent port
7442000	7444000	all things considered
7444000	7446000	So they did a DS
7446000	7448000	Final Fantasy 4
7448000	7450000	So a lot of us are actually kind of waiting
7450000	7452000	like, when would that come over
7452000	7454000	Final Fantasy 3 style to the iPhone
7454000	7456000	That would be kind of neat to see. I thought they already did that
7456000	7458000	Well, they did that for the DS4
7458000	7460000	They did 4 for the DS, but they didn't port that
7460000	7462000	to the iOS yet, you know
7462000	7464000	Which I'm sure some people, not everybody's a fan of
7464000	7466000	And plus, I don't know, like
7466000	7468000	There was a lot I liked about the DS
7468000	7470000	remake, and there was a lot I just
7470000	7472000	I didn't, just, it was just
7472000	7474000	weird seeing the sprite
7474000	7476000	based game I used to love in the 3D
7476000	7478000	environment was so weird
7478000	7480000	But then again, I would love
7480000	7482000	to see that opera scene from 6 redone
7482000	7484000	You know, there's
7484000	7486000	things I'd like
7486000	7488000	Zethurb says, Time Crisis
7488000	7490000	Touch controls for a light gun game
7490000	7492000	just sound right. That actually
7492000	7494000	does sound like a really good idea
7494000	7496000	I've already done that
7496000	7498000	Did they do Time Crisis? I believe they did
7498000	7500000	Oh, well, maybe Zethurb needs to go check the store
7500000	7502000	How about Point Blank then?
7502000	7504000	How about Point Blank? I was gonna say Point Blank would be awesome
7504000	7506000	Great fucking suggestion
7506000	7508000	Nick M. replies and says
7508000	7510000	I would love a port of the original
7510000	7512000	Worms Armageddon, not a sequel because
7512000	7514000	Team 7 has screwed up every Worms game since
7514000	7516000	I chose this game because the gameplay
7516000	7518000	and fun factor would not be affected by
7518000	7520000	touch controls. I could see that
7520000	7522000	I'm sure there's Worms clones, there's gotta be
7522000	7524000	Worms all over the marketplace already
7524000	7526000	Um
7526000	7528000	Allen replied and said
7528000	7530000	Troll answer. Steel battalion
7530000	7532000	Serious answer
7532000	7534000	I think the Panzer Dragoon
7534000	7536000	games would clean up nice and make great
7536000	7538000	use of tilt controls. Res would be great
7538000	7540000	too. Steer with tilt and drag
7540000	7542000	finger for linking targets. That's
7542000	7544000	surprisingly not a bad idea
7544000	7546000	Good job, Allen
7546000	7548000	Matt replied, Matt J. replied on Facebook
7548000	7550000	with a no. We're finally seeing some no's
7550000	7552000	I personally feel we should
7552000	7554000	not port various titles to mobile platforms
7554000	7556000	These platforms are not designed
7556000	7558000	with these games in mind. Virtual
7558000	7560000	controls simply do not work
7560000	7562000	most of the time. My favorite iOS
7562000	7564000	titles have been built from the ground up for mobile
7564000	7566000	platforms. Games which were designed
7566000	7568000	with physical controls in mind, which
7568000	7570000	specific hardware in mind just don't translate
7570000	7572000	well to the ever changing mobile platforms
7572000	7574000	I agree with what some have said
7574000	7576000	The World Ends With You is worth $20
7576000	7578000	It's worth $20 on the DS
7578000	7580000	It's not worth $2 on iOS
7580000	7582000	It will not be as good of an experience
7582000	7584000	A good example is
7584000	7586000	Grand Theft Auto 3. I got it from my
7586000	7588000	iPad. I've yet to beat the very first mission
7588000	7590000	for the horrible car controls just drive
7590000	7592000	me nuts. I beat the same game
7592000	7594000	years back on the PC. Loved it
7594000	7596000	I'm just glad I only paid a buck for
7596000	7598000	Grand Theft Auto 3 iOS
7598000	7600000	Did they ever do Dragon's Lair?
7600000	7602000	Yes. I'm sure they did
7602000	7604000	I was just thinking that one would be perfect
7604000	7606000	I'm gonna quickly go through some of these other ones
7606000	7608000	I'll just read kind of the game
7608000	7610000	or whatever
7610000	7612000	Haseo Sumurogaro replied and said
7612000	7614000	no
7614000	7616000	in a nutshell because IOS will fuck it up
7616000	7618000	like they fuck up most games
7618000	7620000	Locopoco replied saying
7620000	7622000	a mobile version of the adventure game
7622000	7624000	The Neverhood point and click adventure games
7624000	7626000	would be great ported and he's not
7626000	7628000	happy about the Square Enix
7628000	7630000	World Ends With You remake
7630000	7632000	Stan replied a new chapter to the Space Channel
7632000	7634000	5 series
7634000	7636000	for IOS or for anything
7636000	7638000	Hitstun said
7638000	7640000	Missile Command and Crystal Castles
7640000	7642000	work great on multi-touch phones
7642000	7644000	You know they do have that in the Atari
7644000	7646000	thing. I think he said
7646000	7648000	I think he knows that because he says they work great
7648000	7650000	on multi-touch phones. What about Marble Madness?
7650000	7652000	That's a good idea too
7652000	7654000	He does say more faithful ports
7654000	7656000	of classic trackball games
7656000	7658000	Marble Madness. There he is
7658000	7660000	Marble Madness he says. An arcade perfect port
7660000	7662000	Capcom Bowling would be a
7662000	7664000	natural too. Maybe we could get
7664000	7666000	a port for the Japanese only
7666000	7668000	Sega Sonic the Hedgehog
7670000	7672000	There's a game called Manic Marble
7672000	7674000	Lastly I'm not sure what Clover Nikon means by
7674000	7676000	this comment. LucasArts Outlaws
7676000	7678000	first person shooter. Was that a game? LucasArts
7678000	7680000	I don't know the game Outlaws. Is that a
7680000	7682000	LucasArts game that I'm just not ringing a bell?
7682000	7684000	Because I think LucasArts I think of the
7684000	7686000	old strategy games
7686000	7688000	like Loom
7688000	7690000	and Indiana Jones and shit
7690000	7692000	and Maniac Mansion and all that
7692000	7694000	I'm looking right now
7694000	7696000	Of course I'm sure the chatters at live.vognetwork.com
7696000	7698000	will be happy
7698000	7700000	to correct me in a minute
7702000	7704000	I'm looking right now
7704000	7706000	Let's see
7706000	7708000	Outlaws yeah shooter game for the Commodore 64
7708000	7710000	I'll be damned
7710000	7712000	1985 and 1997 there were different releases
7712000	7714000	That's not the one
7714000	7716000	The 1997 release must be the one he's talking about
7716000	7718000	Yes it was LucasArts and the Jedi Engine
7718000	7720000	I didn't know this game at all
7720000	7722000	Now I want to look it up
7722000	7724000	Was it Jedi Outlaws?
7724000	7726000	No it was done in that Jedi Engine
7726000	7728000	Let me look
7728000	7730000	The first person shooter one that was from 1997
7730000	7732000	or whatever
7732000	7734000	I'm looking it up right now
7734000	7736000	except YouTube won't work
7736000	7738000	so I'll have to look later
7738000	7740000	Alright
7740000	7742000	anything quickly you guys would like to
7742000	7744000	see on iOS or not
7744000	7746000	Second point blank
7746000	7748000	Yeah
7748000	7750000	A real Marble Madness I guess
7750000	7752000	I'd like a Marble Madness sequel
7752000	7754000	type of thing
7754000	7756000	Maybe a better version of Silent Hill
7756000	7758000	and Metal Gear Solid those shooters
7758000	7760000	On iOS though
7760000	7762000	I can't see Silent Hill on iOS
7762000	7764000	They had a Silent Hill
7764000	7766000	iPhone game and it was terrible
7766000	7768000	It was like the old Sega shooter games
7768000	7770000	Any of the Sega shooters would be pretty cool
7770000	7772000	Like um
7772000	7774000	Uh
7774000	7776000	I'm trying to think of what I was thinking here
7776000	7778000	Gunblade
7778000	7780000	Gunblade would be fucking awesome
7780000	7782000	Also
7782000	7784000	Yeah it was any of the shooters
7784000	7786000	Any of their
7786000	7788000	arcade stuff
7788000	7790000	Alright I knew the chatters wouldn't let me down
7790000	7792000	VxJsonXV says Outlaws was quite fun indeed
7792000	7794000	I think I bought it at some point
7794000	7796000	and sucked at it a lot for some reason
7796000	7798000	Dungeon Buster says
7798000	7800000	Outlaws cutscenes had the same animated look
7800000	7802000	that Full Throttles did only stylized
7802000	7804000	for a western adventure
7804000	7806000	Um
7806000	7808000	Tykey in our chat reminds us there was Marble Madness
7808000	7810000	too it was called Marble Man
7810000	7812000	Marble Man I don't think that ever actually came out
7812000	7814000	though it's like a prototype thing one of those like
7814000	7816000	legendary games right
7816000	7818000	Alright S2 under Matt says this sounds like a listless
7818000	7820000	topic alright maybe
7820000	7822000	Maybe next time maybe next time
7822000	7824000	Alright let's get some more news out of the way Loki
7824000	7826000	Alright so um
7826000	7828000	It's unfortunate but
7828000	7830000	Nintendo Power is coming to an end
7830000	7832000	their last issue will be running in December
7832000	7834000	and unfortunately
7834000	7836000	they just have no plans
7836000	7838000	on continuing it any further than that
7838000	7840000	and you know before you know they were
7840000	7842000	you know running it
7842000	7844000	through in house stuff
7844000	7846000	but then it was
7846000	7848000	forwarded to future publishing in
7848000	7850000	2007 and
7850000	7852000	that's that
7852000	7854000	just I guess
7854000	7856000	not print media is just not
7856000	7858000	as popular anymore as it used to be
7858000	7860000	um and then of course Nintendo is
7860000	7862000	going to be getting their news out slightly
7862000	7864000	differently can I just say this real quick
7864000	7866000	about Nintendo Power though because like I saw a lot
7866000	7868000	of the people on Twitter and Facebook were saying like
7868000	7870000	oh this makes me really sad
7870000	7872000	I used to love this magazine as a kid
7872000	7874000	and oh I remember when I had
7874000	7876000	Nintendo Power and it's just kind of funny like I
7876000	7878000	you know and while it is sad in a way
7878000	7880000	I think you're really sad that you're getting older
7880000	7882000	because nobody said
7882000	7884000	oh I'm really sad it's going away because
7884000	7886000	I'm currently subscribed
7886000	7888000	nobody said that
7888000	7890000	like I think a lot of people are just sad
7890000	7892000	because it's a relic from their childhood
7892000	7894000	it's no longer there but
7894000	7896000	hello they went bankrupt because nobody was still
7896000	7898000	subscribed anybody in here subscribed to
7898000	7900000	Nintendo Power currently? Nope
7900000	7902000	and let's be real it's changed
7902000	7904000	hands over the years and so forth and there is no
7904000	7906000	more Howard and Nestor
7906000	7908000	it's just it's tough for a
7908000	7910000	print magazine to survive right now
7910000	7912000	it's tough I would have loved for an ebook
7912000	7914000	that makes me so sad
7914000	7916000	because that's like what I went to school
7916000	7918000	for
7918000	7920000	got to evolve into the digital format
7920000	7922000	wouldn't it have been great on the Wii U tablet
7922000	7924000	you could have flipped through pages or something
7924000	7926000	it would have been awesome
7926000	7928000	so to get the word out about the Wii U
7928000	7930000	release date and pricing September
7930000	7932000	13th they're going to be doing another
7932000	7934000	press event
7934000	7936000	they're going to be talking about it it's going to be held in
7936000	7938000	New York City and
7938000	7940000	at least that's assumed what they're going to be talking about
7940000	7942000	is Wii U pricing and release
7942000	7944000	date
7944000	7946000	$249 for $349
7946000	7948000	and November 18th
7948000	7950000	we'll see
7950000	7952000	that's just a guess
7952000	7954000	allegedly
7954000	7956000	the titles that were released on the 20th
7956000	7958000	now move to the 13th
7958000	7960000	alright we'll see
7960000	7962000	alright moving on
7962000	7964000	you remember Adventure on the Atari 2600
7964000	7966000	I mean back in the days
7966000	7968000	of the Atari 2600 where we had games like
7968000	7970000	baseball
7970000	7972000	basketball
7972000	7974000	video pinball
7974000	7976000	we had Adventure and a lot of people remember
7976000	7978000	Adventure because it was the very first game to have an Easter egg
7978000	7980000	or at least a prominent Easter egg
7980000	7982000	which had the hidden designer's name
7982000	7984000	in it because if you want to go way back
7984000	7986000	go back to a time where designers
7986000	7988000	would not get credit for games and sometimes it would leave
7988000	7990000	them a little frustrated so you could find
7990000	7992000	that in Adventure well also
7992000	7994000	Adventure was just kind of a neat little game that
7994000	7996000	a lot of games like you see things in
7996000	7998000	Adventure that influence the Legend of Zelda
7998000	8000000	for real like a lot of what comes
8000000	8002000	Legend of Zelda was in Adventure on the
8002000	8004000	Atari 2600 and therefore it has
8004000	8006000	its fans and
8006000	8008000	more than 30 years later we're looking at
8008000	8010000	yet another sequel to Adventure
8010000	8012000	now I believe there was a prototype some time
8012000	8014000	ago of Adventure 2 but that's not
8014000	8016000	part of the canon that we have
8016000	8018000	now what we do have is
8018000	8020000	that in 2009 there was Evil Magician
8020000	8022000	Returns which was
8022000	8024000	programmed by Bite Knight from the
8024000	8026000	Atari Age forums and he did this in
8026000	8028000	2009 and this is in reference to
8028000	8030000	the unseen antagonist who
8030000	8032000	stole and hid the chalice in the original game
8032000	8034000	he didn't have the rights to call it
8034000	8036000	Adventure 2 but he could call it Evil Magician
8036000	8038000	hooray generic bad guy
8038000	8040000	well now Evil Magician
8040000	8042000	Returns 2
8042000	8044000	ahhhh
8044000	8046000	he's back bitch
8046000	8048000	you have to overcome both
8048000	8050000	him and his apprentice
8050000	8052000	they are personally guarding the chalice
8052000	8054000	keys, mages
8054000	8056000	mazes, flickering
8056000	8058000	grottos and bats
8058000	8060000	and it has
8060000	8062000	come out yes it is an adventure
8062000	8064000	game there has to be an easter egg in there
8064000	8066000	somewhere so be on the lookout for that
8066000	8068000	you know I gotta say this
8068000	8070000	for an Atari 2600
8070000	8072000	game the graphics are pretty sweet
8074000	8076000	I know you're looking at this
8076000	8078000	picture of the game and laughing at me but
8078000	8080000	hello remember what the original
8080000	8082000	adventure looked like like this is a step up
8082000	8084000	I love that people are still
8084000	8086000	programming for the Atari 2600
8086000	8088000	of course
8088000	8090000	ROMs allow them to make the
8090000	8092000	games however big they want
8092000	8094000	I don't think this is actually getting printed on
8094000	8096000	a cartridge no but
8096000	8098000	it's just neat that there's still all that
8098000	8100000	love for the Atari 2600
8100000	8102000	so there you go
8102000	8104000	Dark Sakura?
8104000	8106000	well for those who are still
8106000	8108000	playing Diablo 3 and I know that there are
8108000	8110000	da da da
8110000	8112000	there is
8112000	8114000	going to be new upgrade levels
8114000	8116000	for all of those who have reached your level cap
8116000	8118000	it's called the
8118000	8120000	Paragon system which has nothing to do
8120000	8122000	with Mass Effect
8122000	8124000	has 100 additional levels
8124000	8126000	for you to push through once you meet
8126000	8128000	the current level max
8128000	8130000	it's coming in update 1.0.4
8130000	8132000	and basically all of your
8132000	8134000	experience that you get after 60
8134000	8136000	will be put into your Paragon levels
8136000	8138000	so it gives you a boost in your core stats
8138000	8140000	and
8140000	8142000	an extra 3% boost
8142000	8144000	in magic and gold find
8144000	8146000	also
8146000	8148000	there is this
8148000	8150000	trying to find
8150000	8152000	where exactly it was
8152000	8154000	the Nephilim Valor bonuses
8154000	8156000	will also give a 15% boost
8156000	8158000	in experience towards the Paragon levels per stack
8158000	8160000	so fun
8160000	8162000	I love that they
8162000	8164000	made the end game more exciting by basically
8164000	8166000	adding 100 levels
8166000	8167000	pretty much
8167000	8169000	apparently there is some game balance things and other things
8169000	8171000	they did too, like we talked about this on
8171000	8172000	Horde House a little bit
8172000	8174000	and Extifer has been playing a lot of Diablo
8174000	8176000	lately because he's not really playing WoW right now
8176000	8178000	but him and his partner play a lot
8178000	8180000	of Diablo and he says
8180000	8182000	it's great that the game balancing and everything is great
8182000	8184000	me, I haven't touched Diablo since like the first
8184000	8186000	month it came out but maybe
8186000	8188000	I need to take a second look after
8188000	8190000	WoW and Guild Wars
8190000	8192000	and all that other stuff
8192000	8194000	free with blood packed
8194000	8196000	which you can't sign up for anymore
8196000	8198000	just a couple more news stories for you guys
8198000	8200000	in the mailbag
8200000	8202000	mailbag at orangesloungeradio.com is where the emails
8202000	8204000	go but first some more stories
8204000	8206000	alright
8206000	8208000	now this is kind of interesting
8208000	8210000	you remember that whole
8210000	8212000	Peter Molyneaux thing that they were doing
8212000	8214000	on the iOS platform where it was
8214000	8216000	basically this
8216000	8218000	curiosity is what the game is called
8218000	8220000	and it was kind of controversial
8220000	8222000	because you can buy
8222000	8224000	in-game things to help you
8224000	8226000	chip away at this cube faster including
8226000	8228000	one piece that's $50,000
8228000	8230000	or $5,000
8230000	8232000	so anyways that game's been delayed
8232000	8234000	to September and
8234000	8236000	also because it's been delayed
8236000	8238000	I'm not sure if this is the reason but
8238000	8240000	they had to change their title because
8240000	8242000	you may remember there was a certain
8242000	8244000	program from NASA that landed
8244000	8246000	a rover on Mars named
8246000	8248000	Curiosity and
8248000	8250000	yeah that was kind of
8250000	8252000	bad so now it's
8252000	8254000	that wasn't bad
8254000	8256000	no it was bad for Curiosity because
8256000	8257000	they couldn't use the name
8257000	8259000	bad for Peter Molyneaux but fuck him
8259000	8261000	so now it's not just Curiosity
8261000	8263000	it's Curiosity what's in the
8263000	8265000	cube or what's inside the cube
8265000	8267000	is what it's called
8267000	8269000	WHAT'S IN THE BOX
8269000	8271000	TELL ME WHAT'S IN THE BOX
8271000	8273000	anyone?
8273000	8275000	pretty much yeah
8275000	8277000	you don't get seven
8277000	8279000	so they have that going on right now
8279000	8281000	I gotta wonder though
8281000	8283000	when is the next Apple announcement
8283000	8285000	for iOS 6 isn't that supposed to be
8285000	8287000	in September sometime?
8287000	8289000	the iPhone 5 announcement is heavily rumored
8289000	8291000	for September 12 which is just
8291000	8293000	a few weeks away really
8293000	8295000	and I'm assuming that's probably when we're gonna see iOS 6
8295000	8297000	oh absolutely yeah
8297000	8299000	iOS 6 was the one that had that patch in it
8299000	8301000	or they're supposed to be patching that loophole right now
8301000	8303000	where you can get free DLC
8303000	8305000	probably they wouldn't want to
8305000	8307000	release that game that has
8307000	8309000	$5,000 or $50,000 DLC
8309000	8311000	when there's a loophole to get that for free
8311000	8313000	wouldn't you think?
8313000	8315000	that might kind of skew the way the game's played
8315000	8317000	just the thought
8317000	8319000	I thought they were able to
8319000	8321000	fix that I thought they patched it
8321000	8323000	somewhere on the back end
8323000	8325000	Chiggers in our chat says
8325000	8327000	dick in a box
8327000	8329000	that would be fucking hilarious
8329000	8331000	actually Peter Molyneaux
8331000	8333000	would gain my ultimate
8333000	8335000	respect if what's in the box
8335000	8337000	my dick
8337000	8339000	that would
8339000	8341000	make headlines
8345000	8347000	I mean you'd have
8347000	8349000	to have a real egotistical person
8349000	8351000	to pull a stunt like that
8351000	8353000	you could do it
8353000	8355000	how would you feel Dark
8355000	8357000	Sakura if you opened the box
8357000	8359000	because you were curious and
8359000	8361000	it's his dick
8363000	8365000	I'm just getting blinked at
8365000	8367000	I feel short changed
8371000	8373000	alright moving on
8375000	8377000	Konami is set to shake the industry
8379000	8381000	god damn it

8383000	8385000	alright I remember this story from earlier though
8385000	8387000	Konami is
8387000	8389000	I forget who said it in an event
8389000	8391000	I want to say it was Kojima
8391000	8393000	somebody involved with Kojima Productions
8393000	8395000	because there's an announcement coming up
8395000	8397000	from Metal Gear's 25th anniversary
8397000	8399000	and they were quoted in saying
8399000	8401000	Ken Mandaza
8401000	8403000	with Kojima Productions
8403000	8405000	that was quoted in saying
8405000	8407000	that the industry
8407000	8409000	is going to get shaken up
8409000	8411000	yeah they have a lot of things to look forward to
8411000	8413000	next week not just for fans

8415000	8417000	they're going to be able to present here
8419000	8421000	at least it's not a Frogger game
8425000	8427000	that's all I know
8427000	8429000	oh I finally got it here
8429000	8431000	I was going to say my internet is working just fine
8431000	8433000	I don't know
8433000	8435000	it's because I streamed the show and all that off this computer too
8435000	8437000	but anyway we will find out what the shakedown is
8437000	8439000	August 30th
8439000	8441000	when this event
8441000	8445000	is placed there at Tokyo Midtown

8587000	8589000	ok greetings orange
8589000	8591000	knowledge radio this is a message from
8591000	8593000	hasseo sumi ragawa
8593000	8595000	regarding final fantasy and their rampant cases
8595000	8597000	of disappearing acts yeah we oh this is
8597000	8599000	what we covered ok so six years
8599000	8601000	ago square enix announced final fantasy
8601000	8603000	versus 13 as part of the fabula
8603000	8605000	nova crystallis and since then
8605000	8607000	they put out a few trailers
8607000	8609000	talking about the stories a bit
8609000	8611000	and six years later there's nothing because it came out in japan
8611000	8613000	um there hasn't even
8613000	8615000	been present at e3
8615000	8617000	but that's not my point
8617000	8619000	now last november square announced that they were
8619000	8621000	going to release final fantasy 10 again and needless to
8621000	8623000	say I squeed my voice horse
8623000	8625000	um after that nothing so this
8625000	8627000	brings me to my point is there going to be
8627000	8629000	is this going to be a trend with square
8629000	8631000	announce the games that won't come out for years and years and let's
8631000	8633000	face it look at what happened to duke nukem
8633000	8635000	forever oh that game was
8635000	8637000	crap um one last note
8637000	8639000	to lookies I'm aware you're
8639000	8641000	smart with modding and
8641000	8643000	computers correct okay so
8643000	8645000	two questions firstly
8645000	8647000	um my boyfriend's computer
8647000	8649000	doesn't have the programs installed onto his computer
8649000	8651000	is there a way to fix that I don't
8651000	8653000	it says
8653000	8655000	sorry for bad grammar but honestly the grammar
8655000	8657000	is so bad that I can hardly make heads or
8657000	8659000	tails of the lines
8659000	8661000	doesn't have the programs
8661000	8663000	installed I
8663000	8665000	guess to mod then
8665000	8667000	install the programs where do you
8667000	8669000	recommend to go buy a new
8669000	8671000	hard drive for a ps3 and what's the larger size
8671000	8673000	you can get uh
8673000	8675000	ps3 can fit any hard drive that you can
8675000	8677000	fit in the bay that's in there it's two and a half
8677000	8679000	um inch
8679000	8681000	sata drives laptop sata
8681000	8683000	drive so you can put
8683000	8685000	whatever I think I put a 500
8685000	8687000	gigabyte one in mine and
8687000	8689000	it was a
8689000	8691000	scorpio
8691000	8693000	blue I think
8693000	8695000	or something like that I don't remember what it's called
8695000	8697000	western digital or something like that
8697000	8699000	um just look online for
8699000	8701000	uh hard drives that'll fit
8701000	8703000	I think you have to watch out when you get
8703000	8705000	really big hard drive sizes
8705000	8707000	the actual hard drive itself gets
8707000	8709000	thicker and it might not fit in the actual
8709000	8711000	um bay that they have
8711000	8713000	so you have to kind of watch what you can fit in there
8713000	8715000	uh at least I know that's the case with
8715000	8717000	um with the xbox
8717000	8719000	when you're modding that
8719000	8721000	as far as modding like I'm assuming they're asking
8721000	8723000	about modding the ps3 stuff
8723000	8725000	um just download the apps
8725000	8727000	you may have to check out some of the websites
8727000	8729000	like there's uh
8729000	8731000	dashhax.com
8731000	8733000	or dot net or something
8733000	8735000	dashhax is the website they have
8735000	8737000	information about doing hacks
8737000	8739000	on playstation 3
8739000	8741000	psp vita when there's
8741000	8743000	that stuff available you know pretty much
8743000	8745000	any consoles and ios
8745000	8747000	and phones and that kind of stuff so
8747000	8749000	that'd be kind of a good source for finding some of
8749000	8751000	the tools to flash a custom
8751000	8753000	uh
8753000	8755000	firmware or what not
8755000	8757000	to your playstation 3
8757000	8759000	at least that's how I did it when I did mine
8759000	8761000	then I flashed it back to stock because I just wasn't
8761000	8763000	using
8763000	8765000	you know I wasn't pirating games or anything on that
8765000	8767000	cause you know games are fucking
8767000	8769000	huge cause they're blu ray games so it's
8769000	8771000	just I had nothing I really wanted
8771000	8773000	to even I would want to even
8773000	8775000	pirate so um I just buy games
8775000	8777000	now but um
8777000	8779000	so yeah so there's that
8779000	8781000	just look online

8795000	8797000	and girl and darksacro okay
8797000	8799000	I just wanted to talk a little bit about
8799000	8801000	my favorite portable game of the past generation which you
8801000	8803000	briefly mentioned in the past
8803000	8805000	two weeks releases I am of course
8805000	8807000	talking about bokuakoku
8807000	8809000	kansai kansai kan
8809000	8811000	for psp which is
8811000	8813000	um I am an air traffic
8813000	8815000	controller airport hero um
8815000	8817000	unlike games with similar names on
8817000	8819000	aya such as flight controller pocket planes
8819000	8821000	this is a real puzzle game based on the very
8821000	8823000	real intricacies of air traffic control
8823000	8825000	basically you play the role
8825000	8827000	of the five people in the atc tower
8827000	8829000	at the same time telling pilots what
8829000	8831000	routes to take um
8831000	8833000	coming into and out of the airport giving
8833000	8835000	permission to land and take off giving
8835000	8837000	taxing instructions and confirming flight plans
8837000	8839000	as the stages get harder more
8839000	8841000	and more plans arrive in your airspace more plans
8841000	8843000	prepare to take off you have to juggle up to
8843000	8845000	ten different pilots vying for your attention
8845000	8847000	with only five radio channels
8847000	8849000	take too long and the pilots get stressed push buttons
8849000	8851000	without thinking and you'll cause a crash
8851000	8853000	it's hectic, frantic, and utterly gripping
8853000	8855000	um he's got a video up
8855000	8857000	um of what it's like so
8857000	8859000	uh I'm not gonna go too far into that
8859000	8861000	it says the 3ds version um came out
8861000	8863000	last week is pretty similar but with cuter graphics
8863000	8865000	and I would urge anyone who enjoys
8865000	8867000	time management puzzle games to look into this
8867000	8869000	as you read this I
8869000	8871000	will likely be in Disneyland Paris
8871000	8873000	watching new Disney dreams nighttime spectacular
8873000	8875000	wish you were here
8875000	8877000	and that's uh from pikaruno
8877000	8879000	oh well you did say wish you were here at the end
8879000	8881000	so I can't be too mean bring me back something duffy
8881000	8883000	and last email
8883000	8885000	uh
8885000	8887000	this uh
8887000	8889000	this is hello olr after a long time
8889000	8891000	I finally got to play binary domain
8891000	8893000	I wish some interest
8893000	8895000	I had some interest in it but I somehow never
8895000	8897000	compelled to buy it thinking it would just
8897000	8899000	be another shooter my girlfriend got it for me
8899000	8901000	a couple days ago and I started playing
8901000	8903000	and just could not stop this game
8903000	8905000	is awesome I was told
8905000	8907000	to sing it by the way
8907000	8909000	and you did and I did
8909000	8911000	sure it's not perfect
8911000	8913000	controls aren't always spot on and the voice recognition
8913000	8915000	isn't very good but the deep story
8915000	8917000	future Tokyo environment graphics
8917000	8919000	voice acting and sound make it
8919000	8921000	a very good game you can literally
8921000	8923000	shoot robots to pieces and it isn't that
8923000	8925000	same gritty and brown
8925000	8927000	world you see in countless other games
8927000	8929000	this is the very first game that gave
8929000	8931000	me goosebumps while playing the end sequence
8931000	8933000	that's saying a lot when I get emotional
8933000	8935000	about a game Sega should be deeply
8935000	8937000	ashamed for not promoting this game more
8937000	8939000	binary domain vanquished bayonetta are all

9067000	9069000	just like selfishly inconsiderate what in the
9069000	9071000	hell find a parking space
9071000	9073000	entitlement and don't think there's anybody else in the world
9073000	9075000	it's like I don't know what's wrong with these people
9075000	9077000	that's it
9077000	9079000	my view of the week goes to the web and on this
9079000	9081000	computer right now I don't get what the hell's going on but like
9081000	9083000	everything is like timing out I'm
9083000	9085000	the same to me yeah I'm having to like run shit off
9085000	9087000	my iPad right now I don't know it's
9087000	9089000	weird I don't know luckily the stream
9089000	9091000	is staying up and that's the most important thing I just hope
9091000	9093000	Skype will stay up as well it's doing
9093000	9095000	the same thing at my house but like
9095000	9097000	I can't do I'm
9097000	9099000	really upset because somebody had a funny joke
9099000	9101000	earlier when Jim Sally sent the email about
9101000	9103000	what sexy games do you want to see on the
9103000	9105000	sexy island dark Tetsuya
9105000	9107000	in chat said miss nude world 96
9107000	9109000	which was a perfect excuse for me
9109000	9111000	to play that everybody move your body
9111000	9113000	clip but thanks to the web errors I can't
9113000	9115000	get the clip up
9115000	9117000	F you to the web
9117000	9119000	for making me lose out on the funny
9119000	9121000	hate
9121000	9123000	two more
9123000	9125000	news stories then phone calls
9125000	9127000	first Loki I'm even turning off everything on my
9127000	9129000	iPhone just to see if it helps
9129000	9131000	so there's a few demakes
9131000	9133000	we should talk about the first being
9133000	9135000	Borderlands Borderlands actually
9135000	9137000	was demade into a 16
9137000	9139000	bit top down shooter game
9139000	9141000	for your browser
9141000	9143000	so you can check it out it's
9143000	9145000	they call it the border lands
9145000	9147000	and you
9147000	9149000	can check it I love this website
9149000	9151000	you can check it at
9151000	9153000	www.wubwub.eu
9153000	9155000	slash demake.php
9155000	9157000	wub wub wub wub wub
9157000	9159000	amazing
9159000	9161000	so that's pretty cool and then
9161000	9163000	since we were talking about Atari 2600
9163000	9165000	earlier somebody has decided
9165000	9167000	to demake the Super Mario Brothers
9167000	9169000	for the Atari 2600
9169000	9171000	now or at least
9171000	9173000	it's done in the Atari 2600
9173000	9175000	style and he's got
9175000	9177000	I guess a demo with
9177000	9179000	level warp pipes
9179000	9181000	yellow blocks and flag poles
9181000	9183000	and I guess 15 levels
9183000	9185000	up to 4-4 is what he's
9185000	9187000	hoping to do and have a Koopa Kid
9187000	9189000	at the end of each world as a boss
9189000	9191000	pretty cool
9191000	9193000	and if you want to check that out
9193000	9195000	indiegames.com has got
9195000	9197000	the link for that
9197000	9199000	I'm surprised it took that long
9199000	9201000	for a Super Mario demake surely this isn't
9201000	9203000	the first it's just the most recent one
9203000	9205000	yeah we go to the Atari age forums
9205000	9207000	there's a
9207000	9209000	bin file for
9209000	9211000	your
9211000	9213000	emulators
9213000	9215000	alright well if you ever saw the movie The King of
9215000	9217000	Kong you did not
9217000	9219000	see Hank Chien in that movie
9219000	9221000	even though he is now the official
9221000	9223000	world record holder of Donkey Kong
9223000	9225000	he came after the movie
9225000	9227000	thank god that wasn't one of the titles for the contest man
9227000	9229000	the whole back and forth what?
9229000	9231000	the Ready Player One contest
9231000	9233000	oh yeah right
9233000	9235000	thank god it wasn't because
9235000	9237000	Hank Chien would have won it again because guess what
9237000	9239000	he broke his own record
9239000	9241000	so you got to appreciate a guy who will keep
9241000	9243000	challenging himself
9243000	9245000	like there's none of this you know
9245000	9247000	Steve Weeby and all this stuff going on here
9247000	9249000	he's challenging himself
9249000	9251000	so he beat his previous record
9251000	9253000	1,110,100 points
9253000	9255000	the new record
9255000	9257000	1,127,700 points
9257000	9259000	that's the new
9259000	9261000	score from Hank Chien
9261000	9263000	if you haven't heard that name of course
9263000	9265000	he was the Donkey Kong world record holder before
9265000	9267000	after that whole movie mess and all that stuff
9267000	9269000	I believe
9269000	9271000	what is it by day he's a plastic surgeon isn't he?
9271000	9273000	and that's how he can afford
9273000	9275000	all these machines
9275000	9277000	you pay him for a new
9277000	9279000	well I noticed in this picture he's posing next
9279000	9281000	to a Donkey Kong machine and there's a moon patrol
9281000	9283000	machine in the background too
9283000	9285000	now I don't know if that's because he's at an arcade
9285000	9287000	like maybe some type of publicity event
9287000	9289000	cause I know Fun Spot
9289000	9291000	he's got way too much smug on his face
9291000	9293000	eh I don't necessarily think it's smug
9293000	9295000	some people just take interesting pictures
9295000	9297000	those machines aren't that terribly expensive
9297000	9299000	he could be a nice guy
9299000	9301000	for an arcade game that's not bad
9301000	9303000	yeah the Kong Off 2
9303000	9305000	that's what they call a Kong Off
9305000	9307000	sounds like something dirty
9307000	9309000	but anyway the Kong Off 2
9309000	9311000	is where they gather the best Donkey Kong players
9311000	9313000	at one location for glorious live
9313000	9315000	competition
9315000	9317000	not that they're saying he's gonna be in it
9317000	9319000	but there's obviously a lot of pressure
9319000	9321000	for him to show up which would be pretty cool
9321000	9323000	so
9323000	9325000	SSJ100Matt in our chat room
9325000	9327000	at chat.orangelandrater
9327000	9329000	not that one
9329000	9331000	live.vognetwork.com says
9331000	9333000	look guys it was 9 years of one particular website
9333000	9335000	SSJ100Matt says and Billy Mitchell
9335000	9337000	zero fucks given about him
9337000	9339000	or his damn hot sauce
9339000	9341000	I hear the hot sauce isn't bad
9341000	9343000	just saying
9343000	9345000	alright that takes us to
9345000	9347000	the skype part of the show
9347000	9349000	that's the part of the show
9349000	9351000	where we're gonna open up the skype lines
9351000	9353000	at 1-877-GAME-OLR
9353000	9355000	and take your phone calls
9355000	9357000	live on the program
9357000	9359000	we will get to the twitter as well
9359000	9361000	twitter.com slash olr in just a moment
9361000	9363000	but first we're gonna go to the phones and
9363000	9365000	oh we already have a call on the line let's go to it
9365000	9367000	hi you're on Orange Lodge Radio who's this
9367000	9369000	hey guys it's Jason
9369000	9371000	hey Jason what's up
9371000	9373000	so as you so wonderfully
9373000	9375000	alluded to earlier in the show
9375000	9377000	I was at
9377000	9379000	the Wii U consumer experience
9379000	9381000	here in Denver just yesterday
9381000	9383000	apparently I think my friend
9383000	9385000	told me they've been in since Thursday
9385000	9387000	and since he went to E3 he had codes
9387000	9389000	assigned me and a friend up and we all
9389000	9391000	got to go out there and see the
9391000	9393000	I'm assuming they're all gonna be
9393000	9395000	launch titles or something that's gonna happen
9395000	9397000	within the first couple of months
9397000	9399000	and it's just really interesting
9399000	9401000	cause I was hearing obviously you're cross with Bobby
9401000	9403000	and you guys were really
9403000	9405000	putting the Wii U down
9405000	9407000	it's kind of astounding
9407000	9409000	to me
9409000	9411000	I understand in the fact that it's
9411000	9413000	gonna be a lot of the same thing
9413000	9415000	and you have to get a whole new console
9415000	9417000	just to be able to use the tablet even
9417000	9419000	though everything else is gonna be the same
9419000	9421000	controllers, the Wii Fit balance
9421000	9423000	board and all that kind of stuff
9423000	9425000	but I don't know
9425000	9427000	that speaking as a gamer myself
9427000	9429000	somebody who will pay the money to get something
9429000	9431000	like this and not the common
9431000	9433000	people that paid 200 bucks to play
9433000	9435000	Wii Sports forever
9435000	9437000	Jason I'm more worried about the games
9437000	9439000	it's not the console myself
9439000	9441000	or the console itself
9441000	9443000	but I see a lot of what was happening with the 3DS
9443000	9445000	happening here, you have a lot of mediocre
9445000	9447000	launch titles and I
9447000	9449000	don't think any really big standouts
9449000	9451000	here's your chance to change
9451000	9453000	my mind, what did you get your hands on
9453000	9455000	that you are excited to drop money
9455000	9457000	for a new console for?
9457000	9459000	They didn't really speak release dates
9459000	9461000	and actually as a matter of fact when the event was wrapping up
9461000	9463000	they had this little quick little
9463000	9465000	trivia session, they were giving out a bunch of
9465000	9467000	silly little prizes and one of them
9467000	9469000	was a trick question, when is the Wii U
9469000	9471000	coming out, the answer was holidays
9471000	9473000	but there's otherwise no specific
9473000	9475000	date barring what Loki
9475000	9477000	said earlier about the 13th
9477000	9479000	you know that the correct answer is November 18th, I would have got him
9479000	9481000	even the people putting on this event
9481000	9483000	wouldn't know that though
9483000	9485000	yeah it wasn't NDA'd
9485000	9487000	it wasn't sales, it wasn't media
9487000	9489000	this is just bring your friends
9489000	9491000	and let's play some really cool games
9491000	9493000	we'll show you some stuff, and it was really fun
9493000	9495000	the boost that they set up, the things that I actually
9495000	9497000	had, I didn't get my hands on everything
9497000	9499000	but they had setups
9499000	9501000	for Nintendo Land cycling
9501000	9503000	through some of the mini arcade games
9503000	9505000	Game and Wario
9505000	9507000	Super Mario Brothers Wii U, Zombie U
9507000	9509000	Batman Arkham City, Pikmin 3
9509000	9511000	Just Dance 4, Wii Fit
9511000	9513000	U, Rayman Legends
9513000	9515000	and then two non-finally
9515000	9517000	named Project P100
9517000	9519000	and Sing
9519000	9521000	and they
9521000	9523000	looked good, that's all I really
9523000	9525000	have to say about it
9525000	9527000	on the surface is that these games
9527000	9529000	looked spectacular
9529000	9531000	Super Mario Brothers, exactly
9531000	9533000	as it was on the Wii, I love
9533000	9535000	that art style, I love the way it played
9535000	9537000	the tablet integration looks fun if you happen
9537000	9539000	to have a second person to play
9539000	9541000	with, but then Pikmin
9541000	9543000	looked gorgeous and the new effects
9543000	9545000	that they're
9545000	9547000	they're not, if they support 3D
9547000	9549000	TV that's news to me, but the fact that they
9549000	9551000	were actually throwing things
9551000	9553000	at the camera and whatnot and actually
9553000	9555000	given this serious
9555000	9557000	spatial angle to it and not just
9557000	9559000	you know, a bird's eye corner
9559000	9561000	view of it, it just
9561000	9563000	looks like it played marvelously well
9563000	9565000	Alright, so it's the Nintendo
9565000	9567000	stuff you love in HD
9567000	9569000	but again, did you
9569000	9571000	get your hands on the games? Did you play any games?
9571000	9573000	Which ones stood out for you?
9573000	9575000	I played Super Mario Brothers
9575000	9577000	Wii U
9579000	9581000	Super Mario Brothers Wii U
9581000	9583000	I played a couple of the games from Nintendo Land
9583000	9585000	and then I played
9585000	9587000	as far as I understand, pretty much a whole level of
9587000	9589000	Game and Legends
9589000	9591000	As I'm sure a lot of people know, Nintendo Land
9591000	9593000	is mostly a series of
9593000	9595000	mini-games that are developed to really take
9595000	9597000	advantage notably of the tablet
9597000	9599000	but also give you a really good multiplayer experience
9599000	9601000	The very first
9601000	9603000	thing I did was play Luigi's Ghost
9603000	9605000	Mansion playing the flashlight tag
9605000	9607000	where the ghost is playing on the
9607000	9609000	tablet and is invisible for the large
9609000	9611000	part and then the four players
9611000	9613000	with Wiimotes have to move
9613000	9615000	around, have to move around the
9615000	9617000	mansion, the maze trying to find the ghost
9617000	9619000	and reviving players that go down
9619000	9621000	anything else like that
9621000	9623000	These games
9623000	9625000	I could not say that these games
9625000	9627000	were not complete and ready for retail
9627000	9629000	release
9629000	9631000	It was a two hour
9631000	9633000	event, tops, and we
9633000	9635000	were playing in increments
9635000	9637000	of like ten minutes at best
9637000	9639000	usually much shorter than that
9639000	9641000	I can't
9641000	9643000	really find the words for it other than the fact that
9643000	9645000	it feels like it will be a more complete
9645000	9647000	library than any other
9647000	9649000	system launch that I've actually
9649000	9651000	jumped into at the very start of it
9651000	9653000	and then especially things like
9653000	9655000	Zombiou and Batman Arkham City look
9655000	9657000	absolutely stunning
9657000	9659000	I've played Mad World
9659000	9661000	and yeah, that's not supposed to be the
9661000	9663000	realistic graphics or anything
9663000	9665000	but Arkham City and Zombiou looked
9665000	9667000	absolutely fantastic, this wasn't
9667000	9669000	the thin arm red
9669000	9671000	steel or any other nonsense like that
9671000	9673000	Out of curiosity, have you played
9673000	9675000	Arkham City on 360 or
9675000	9677000	PlayStation 3? Unfortunately,
9677000	9679000	no. See, that's
9679000	9681000	where I have to admit, not that
9681000	9683000	I question your opinion, but I go, well
9683000	9685000	it looks beautiful on the other systems too, and it's
9685000	9687000	been out for a year
9687000	9689000	And it's not just about the graphics, but the fact that this is something
9689000	9691000	that's going to be available at some
9691000	9693000	point within the launch
9693000	9695000	within the general launch window
9695000	9697000	means that this is a
9697000	9699000	big tier title
9699000	9701000	that's going to be on Nintendo's system
9701000	9703000	that a lot of people already own
9703000	9705000	because it came out last year
9705000	9707000	also true
9707000	9709000	I absolutely will not deny that, and like I was saying
9709000	9711000	at the start of the call, I think
9711000	9713000	that a lot of people
9713000	9715000	are going to paint a very negative
9715000	9717000	picture of the Wii U after it comes
9717000	9719000	out because it's not going to have
9719000	9721000	the runaway success that the first Wii did
9721000	9723000	because all of the
9723000	9725000	casuals, all of the people that
9725000	9727000	otherwise have never owned a gaming system
9727000	9729000	won't see the reason to
9729000	9731000	buy this, maybe
9731000	9733000	and so it'll, it
9733000	9735000	won't sell, it won't take
9735000	9737000	off so ridiculously like the original Wii
9737000	9739000	did, but that's not a bad
9739000	9741000	thing because this is, this
9741000	9743000	is Nintendo, in my
9743000	9745000	absolute opinion, this is Nintendo making things
9745000	9747000	better for gamers at large
9747000	9749000	Project P100 is
9749000	9751000	a very Pikmin-esque
9751000	9753000	action game, which
9753000	9755000	is great because there's finally a
9755000	9757000	second game with that low army
9757000	9759000	control mechanism
9759000	9761000	and it's set in a very, in a much
9761000	9763000	more technological, like in a
9763000	9765000	scene that a lot of people would prefer, I'm sure
9767000	9769000	I just, I have to
9769000	9771000	admit, Jason, despite your enthusiasm
9771000	9773000	I'm not sure I'm completely sold, and it
9773000	9775000	comes down to the games issue, and it's
9775000	9777000	really about what
9777000	9779000	I just, it's not,
9779000	9781000	and to be fair, to Nintendo's credit
9781000	9783000	it's kind of the same mistake as the Vita
9783000	9785000	too, is that the Vita
9785000	9787000	did come with a few kick-ass launch
9787000	9789000	games, and there was certainly a lot to look forward
9789000	9791000	to, but I don't know
9791000	9793000	what's been delivered on hasn't
9793000	9795000	exactly matched the hype, and
9795000	9797000	this is all about the games department
9797000	9799000	and it's kind of what I worry about with the
9799000	9801000	Wii U as well, because we haven't seen a lot
9801000	9803000	past the launch window, and you know
9803000	9805000	there's not a lot to just
9805000	9807000	really, really get excited about
9807000	9809000	because I played a lot of these
9809000	9811000	Mass Effect 3, Arkham City on
9811000	9813000	360, and I'm not really
9813000	9815000	interested in playing them again with tablet controls
9815000	9817000	because it doesn't sound like it's going to change that much
9817000	9819000	so I have to look to things like
9819000	9821000	Nintendo Land, and Pikmin 3
9821000	9823000	and New Super Mario Brothers Wii U
9823000	9825000	and all this to pique my
9825000	9827000	interest, and it's just, I'm not
9827000	9829000	I'm not as excited as
9829000	9831000	say, the hype behind the
9831000	9833000	original Wii, and how we felt
9833000	9835000	about that Zelda game, was a
9835000	9837000	phenomenal launch, I mean
9837000	9839000	has there ever been a better
9839000	9841000	launch game for a console since the original
9841000	9843000	Super Mario Brothers?
9843000	9845000	Certainly not one I've actually been there for
9845000	9847000	Than Zelda for the Wii?
9847000	9849000	I mean I guess I was just hoping for something of that
9849000	9851000	magnitude, and Nintendo Land
9851000	9853000	ain't it!
9853000	9855000	The thing that really sets this apart
9855000	9857000	one of the feelings that I did come away with
9857000	9859000	is that, you know
9859000	9861000	true to Nintendo's spirit, this stuff
9861000	9863000	works, a lot of the things that they were showcasing
9863000	9865000	make it really compelling
9865000	9867000	for local multiplayer, you know
9867000	9869000	knock Nintendo's online services
9869000	9871000	all you want, I completely agree with it
9871000	9873000	but having that
9873000	9875000	second player, or in some cases
9875000	9877000	that fifth player, to be able to take over
9877000	9879000	controls with the tablet
9879000	9881000	is actually immensely fun, the fact that
9881000	9883000	me and
9883000	9885000	one of my two friends that were there with me
9885000	9887000	were planning on who wants to do
9887000	9889000	which function of the game, just
9889000	9891000	added a really different element
9891000	9893000	for example, Rayman Legends
9893000	9895000	the Wiimote
9895000	9897000	or actually in this case it was the
9897000	9899000	pro controller, whatever they're
9899000	9901000	going to call it for the Wii U
9901000	9903000	the standard controller user is controlling
9903000	9905000	Rayman, throwing shots
9905000	9907000	jumping, all that kind of thing, jumping on
9907000	9909000	obstacles, attacking, where the tablet
9909000	9911000	is manipulating the
9911000	9913000	environment, it's moving platforms
9913000	9915000	around, they had the whole rotation
9915000	9917000	demonstration where you're walking
9917000	9919000	Rayman's running through a maze, and the
9919000	9921000	person holding the tablet has to orient
9921000	9923000	the level by turning the
9923000	9925000	entire device in order to
9925000	9927000	allow them to jump to the next
9927000	9929000	ring, land on solid grounds
9929000	9931000	lands not on spikes
9931000	9933000	and the biggest thing that
9933000	9935000	they showed off, as I said
9935000	9937000	was that with a second person
9937000	9939000	these games just got
9939000	9941000	ridiculously more interesting
9941000	9943000	Zombie, you had this
9943000	9945000	capture the flag
9945000	9947000	not capture the flag
9947000	9949000	the game mode where you have like three
9949000	9951000	or five waypoints that you have to
9951000	9953000	capture and defend and that kind of stuff
9953000	9955000	and the player
9955000	9957000	with the standard controller
9957000	9959000	owned the TV
9959000	9961000	and would attack
9961000	9963000	Zombies and was pretty much the one man army
9963000	9965000	and then the person holding the tablet
9965000	9967000	had like a real time strategy
9967000	9969000	kind of interface where he could take
9969000	9971000	hordes of Zombies and send them to the
9971000	9973000	particular waypoints and actually drill
9973000	9975000	into this real time strategy that's
9975000	9977000	not really been seen at the
9977000	9979000	same time like that
9979000	9981000	with a lot of the stuff though
9981000	9983000	all these games are reliant on
9983000	9985000	you having about four or five
9985000	9987000	people in your living room
9987000	9989000	it's all local multiplayer
9989000	9991000	where's my online multiplayer for
9991000	9993000	to Nintendo's credit
9993000	9995000	that could be an ace in the hole on September
9995000	9997000	13th, we still don't know what
9997000	9999000	Nintendo Network really is
9999000	10001000	despite the fact it's being branded on Nintendo
10001000	10003000	cartridges, that could be
10003000	10005000	coming and I'd be okay with that if there's
10005000	10007000	a huge unveil on September 13th
10007000	10009000	so I would wait on the online
10009000	10011000	piece to be too critical about that until
10011000	10013000	we have that event, but if we still don't
10013000	10015000	hear about it at that event, that it ain't coming
10015000	10017000	with the release of the Wii U and now we should be concerned
10017000	10019000	but let me ask this
10019000	10021000	this call's going a little long and that's okay Jason
10021000	10023000	because we love you, but I want to ask
10023000	10025000	I want to ask you one more question shaped off
10025000	10027000	a chat comment we got here at live.vognetwork.com
10027000	10029000	and ShadowNextGen
10029000	10031000	in chat who's agreed with you
10031000	10033000	in many ways and I saw it throughout Bobby's show
10033000	10035000	tonight, he kind of didn't
10035000	10037000	he thought
10037000	10039000	what I was saying was kind of wrong and he's
10039000	10041000	more supportive of the Wii U, he sounds a lot like
10041000	10043000	you and what you're saying and
10043000	10045000	he says, what this says to
10045000	10047000	me is more people need to get
10047000	10049000	actual hands on time with
10049000	10051000	the Wii U, so let me
10051000	10053000	ask you this Jason, you've had hands
10053000	10055000	on time with the Wii U, I haven't
10055000	10057000	Loki hasn't, Dark Sakura hasn't
10057000	10059000	what do you think, and you
10059000	10061000	you are clearly in love with this
10061000	10063000	thing more so than us skeptics here
10063000	10065000	what do you
10065000	10067000	think you gain that we're missing
10067000	10069000	having had hands on time with the system
10069000	10071000	see and that's
10071000	10073000	that's a really funny question I'll try to
10073000	10075000	summarize in the fact that I
10075000	10077000	me and Ryan don't play a lot of the same
10077000	10079000	games and I'm hoping she's going to be
10079000	10081000	interested in the aspects that are opened up
10081000	10083000	with this simultaneous multiplayer of standard
10083000	10085000	controllers and the tablets, but that
10085000	10087000	that is absolutely like Nintendo's
10087000	10089000	biggest deal that they're trying to
10089000	10091000	push here is that this is going to be great
10091000	10093000	for families of at least
10093000	10095000	two gamers because
10095000	10097000	in their whole demos you know they
10097000	10099000	can play a standard game reserved
10099000	10101000	solely to the tablet and give the TV
10101000	10103000	back to someone else, that is
10103000	10105000	killer, and this is a fully fledged
10105000	10107000	game that's not confined to
10107000	10109000	a phone that has a limited amount of
10109000	10111000	controls and you can do
10111000	10113000	all sorts of media while giving the TV
10113000	10115000	back to somebody else, but for
10115000	10117000	these Wii U optimized games where you
10117000	10119000	have your hands on the tablet, this is
10119000	10121000	engaging somebody else at
10121000	10123000	the same time, usually in a completely
10123000	10125000	distinct way, you know what that also means?
10125000	10127000	That means both people
10127000	10129000	get to play the game in two in times
10129000	10131000	completely different methods.
10131000	10133000	I mean for all the replayability
10133000	10135000	complaints and what
10135000	10137000	we complain about in modern gaming, this
10137000	10139000	is two different ways to play the same
10139000	10141000	game. That's
10141000	10143000	ridiculously cool
10143000	10145000	to me. I was sold on the system before
10145000	10147000	I went to this event, I touched, I
10147000	10149000	had my hands on it,
10149000	10151000	I am 100% sold on the system
10151000	10153000	now. I will absolutely say
10153000	10155000	that. I am like so with you up to a point
10155000	10157000	Jason because I do really want, no I really
10157000	10159000	do want to love this system and I want to,
10159000	10161000	I'll probably get one anyway, who are we kidding?
10161000	10163000	I mean I've said that since day one.
10163000	10165000	I'm skeptical as all hell
10165000	10167000	but I'll still fucking buy one because I'm a
10167000	10169000	consumer of horror.
10169000	10171000	God damn it, I lost
10171000	10173000	my train of thought.
10173000	10175000	Where you don't, this is where you don't agree.
10175000	10177000	No here it is, here it is.
10177000	10179000	Where are the games
10179000	10181000	that substantiate what you're saying?
10181000	10183000	I know you
10183000	10185000	brought this up before, which of these, do you
10185000	10187000	remember my list of games at the very start of the call?
10187000	10189000	Yes. Do you
10189000	10191000	know what the launch dates,
10191000	10193000	what the launch, oh Jesus.
10193000	10195000	What games will be launched
10195000	10197000	in the holiday window?
10197000	10199000	Pretty much everything that you named is in the
10199000	10201000	holiday window. And that's not enough to
10201000	10203000	start a system?
10203000	10205000	Yes.
10205000	10207000	When half
10207000	10209000	your list is stuff that's already
10209000	10211000	been out with a new method that
10211000	10213000	again, now we go back to the phone
10213000	10215000	conversation about
10215000	10217000	games that weren't developed for that system.
10217000	10219000	Don't know, I mean, yeah, okay
10219000	10221000	so we'll have this tablet interaction, but these games
10221000	10223000	weren't designed with the tablet thing in mind.
10223000	10225000	They're kind of trying to shoehorn that
10225000	10227000	stuff in there, which is fine, whatever, show off
10227000	10229000	the system, but I'm not that, I am not
10229000	10231000	excited about Arkham City with the pad.
10231000	10233000	I'm not, I am not excited
10233000	10235000	about Mass Effect 3 with the touchpad.
10235000	10237000	Sorry, I'm not.
10237000	10239000	So, you know, that's half the games right
10239000	10241000	off the table. Now my interest is
10241000	10243000	peaked, my eyebrow is raised a little bit at things
10243000	10245000	like Zombie U, Peekman
10245000	10247000	3, I kind of consider
10247000	10249000	New Star Mario Brothers Wii at this point.
10249000	10251000	It's half rehash, half
10251000	10253000	a successful formula just being
10253000	10255000	done again. But
10255000	10257000	a couple games, no, it's really not
10257000	10259000	enough. Look at the 3DS.
10259000	10261000	Look at the 3DS, I think
10261000	10263000	they're making the exact same mistake, I really do.
10263000	10265000	Look at the Vita launch, I mean, they had a ton of games
10265000	10267000	that a lot of them were original
10267000	10269000	and that still didn't help the system.
10269000	10271000	Yeah, and SSJ100, Matt, thank you, you fill in the
10271000	10273000	gap here really well. I want to know what's coming
10273000	10275000	out after these launch window games.
10275000	10277000	What is Nintendo going to do to warrant this investment
10277000	10279000	because that's what console games are, investments.
10279000	10281000	I think that is what Nintendo
10281000	10283000	really has to show us September 13th
10283000	10285000	if they want to woo some of the skeptics over
10285000	10287000	because I'll tell you, they come out and they show
10287000	10289000	off that 3D Zelda game or they
10289000	10291000	whip out F-Zero or
10291000	10293000	a Metroid Prime type of thing that's in that
10293000	10295000	HD experience, I'm totally
10295000	10297000	on board.
10297000	10299000	Final thought? Yes. You are going
10299000	10301000	to love Sing.
10301000	10303000	Provided the song list pans
10303000	10305000	out and it's not more
10305000	10307000	freaking LMFAO
10307000	10309000	We'll see.
10309000	10311000	Provided the song list comes up with some really good gems
10311000	10313000	you are going to adore
10313000	10315000	Sing. I can pretty much promise you that.
10315000	10317000	Will it be all ABBA
10317000	10319000	songs? Because otherwise Sing Star ABBA
10319000	10321000	still has my heart.
10321000	10323000	The only songs they had
10323000	10325000	were Shoop Shoop
10325000	10327000	Party Rock Anthem and Call
10327000	10329000	Me Maybe and they haven't really let on
10329000	10331000	what else is going to be there. Oh god, that's like
10331000	10333000	my personal hell.
10333000	10335000	Those sure, like I said, provided
10335000	10337000	the song list is actually worth it and I
10337000	10339000	have to hope that we'll sing is going to be
10339000	10341000	spectacular for parties. Jason,
10341000	10343000	I got to let you go. Some of the chatters think you're a
10343000	10345000	Nintendo sales person in disguise.
10345000	10347000	I got to let you go. Alright. Thanks guys.
10347000	10349000	Have a good week. You too, buddy. Take care.
10349000	10351000	Alright. VX Jason
10351000	10353000	XV. We let his call go on a little long, but that's
10353000	10355000	alright. I mean, he was there. He got
10355000	10357000	hands on. We're skeptics. Whatevs.
10357000	10359000	Let's do like one more
10359000	10361000	call. 1877 Game OLR or
10361000	10363000	username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
10363000	10365000	While we wait for those calls to come in, let me
10365000	10367000	quickly see if I can do a Twitter topic here.
10367000	10369000	Tiger Claw
10369000	10371000	links us on Twitter.
10371000	10373000	This is one
10373000	10375000	that I read in the news that
10375000	10377000	forgot to mention on the show tonight,
10377000	10379000	but it's important. Uncharted
10379000	10381000	film has burned through yet another
10381000	10383000	director.
10383000	10385000	I'll have to read more on this after another
10385000	10387000	call because the phone's lighting up. Hi, you're on
10387000	10389000	OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? Holy crap
10389000	10391000	it's Ranma and I get the ass into the Skype
10391000	10393000	chats. That's sweet. What's up,
10393000	10395000	Ranma? Not too much.
10395000	10397000	You guys are talking about
10397000	10399000	Kickstarter and stuff like that, so I've come
10399000	10401000	across something that's quite interesting.
10401000	10403000	Well, when I was at
10403000	10405000	Otacon last month, I was in the game room
10405000	10407000	and they had this game called
10407000	10409000	Epic Beatdown
10409000	10411000	Otaku Style.
10411000	10413000	What? Yes.
10413000	10415000	Okay,
10415000	10417000	is it something you actually brave to try
10417000	10419000	or... Yes, it's
10419000	10421000	an anime equivalent of
10421000	10423000	Double Dragon meets Scott Pilgrim vs.
10423000	10425000	the World, the game.
10425000	10427000	Wow. And you can
10427000	10429000	check out their plans on
10429000	10431000	StudioNasu.com, which I am posting
10431000	10433000	in the chat room right now.
10433000	10435000	It pretty much,
10435000	10437000	from what I understand,
10437000	10439000	you're at Otacon and you're just
10439000	10441000	pretty much beating up on the fanboys,
10441000	10443000	more or less.
10443000	10445000	And as
10445000	10447000	somebody who goes to anime conventions
10447000	10449000	quite frequently and all this stuff, how do you
10449000	10451000	feel? Hey,
10451000	10453000	I'm all for it. You talk to somebody
10453000	10455000	at any given time who has a weapon on and
10455000	10457000	you're trying to help somebody. You gotta be able to laugh
10457000	10459000	at yourself first. I'll put a weapon
10459000	10461000	as a can of deodorant.
10461000	10463000	Well, one con
10463000	10465000	actually put
10465000	10467000	soap in their bags
10467000	10469000	and people got pissed at that so they decided
10469000	10471000	not to do it again, but that's besides the point.
10471000	10473000	Alright.
10473000	10475000	Did you just call to whore this con
10475000	10477000	going game or what else is going on in your life,
10477000	10479000	Rama? Yeah, that's more or less
10479000	10481000	it. Well, you know, that and we've already discussed
10481000	10483000	New Super Mario Brothers 2, so my two
10483000	10485000	cents on that doesn't really count. Well, what
10485000	10487000	is your, no, of course, every
10487000	10489000	gamer has a voice. Every gamer
10489000	10491000	has a voice. Use that voice. You are
10491000	10493000	Black Luigi after all. I want to know what
10493000	10495000	Black Luigi thinks
10495000	10497000	about Mario 2. It's important, dammit.
10497000	10499000	I'm a Luigi, number
10499000	10501000	one gaming star.
10501000	10503000	So what do you think about Mario
10503000	10505000	2 on, excuse
10505000	10507000	me, New Super Mario Brothers 2
10507000	10509000	on the 3DS? It
10509000	10511000	lacks. Ooh,
10511000	10513000	sick burn. Why is that?
10513000	10515000	I don't know. It's, you know how you play
10515000	10517000	a game and you just look at it like it's just
10517000	10519000	lacking and you can't put your
10519000	10521000	finger on what it is, but it's just lacking
10521000	10523000	something. I mean, I like
10523000	10525000	the fact they brought back the raccoon tail,
10525000	10527000	so I'm thinking, oh yeah, Super Mario
10527000	10529000	Brothers 3. Rama, is it
10529000	10531000	originality?
10531000	10533000	Mmm.
10533000	10535000	You say it lacks? Yeah, I don't know.
10535000	10537000	I mean. It only has 85%
10537000	10539000	of the feels. Yes.
10539000	10541000	I don't know
10541000	10543000	if you listened to last week's show, Rama, early on
10543000	10545000	or whatever when I was talking about the game. Well, yeah, I caught the podcast
10545000	10547000	because I was out last week. But I'm just
10547000	10549000	okay, here was my whole thoughts on the game is that
10549000	10551000	like, it's pretty much a formulaic
10551000	10553000	Mario game, but is that
10553000	10555000	really such a bad thing? No,
10555000	10557000	not at all, but this
10557000	10559000	is what I think would have made the game better.
10559000	10561000	Now, you remember in Super Mario
10561000	10563000	3, you could travel all
10563000	10565000	over the map area
10565000	10567000	to go to different levels. I understand you could
10567000	10569000	do that in the new SMB2,
10569000	10571000	but it's only like part of the
10571000	10573000	screen that it takes up. It would be nicer if
10573000	10575000	it was the full screen that allows you to travel
10575000	10577000	from the different levels.
10577000	10579000	I understand that they brought back some of the
10579000	10581000	music from SMB3. They
10581000	10583000	could have brought back some of the classic matching
10583000	10585000	card games or matching
10585000	10587000	up the mushroom, the fire flower for 1-Ups
10587000	10589000	and stuff like that. I like the little
10589000	10591000	giant glove that punched the 1-Ups.
10591000	10593000	That was kind of cute, actually.
10593000	10595000	Yeah, bring back Kribo
10595000	10597000	2. Maybe
10597000	10599000	I was thinking it would be more
10599000	10601000	like Super Mario Bros 3, but better.
10603000	10605000	Well, I don't know.
10605000	10607000	I didn't dislike it by any means,
10607000	10609000	and when I write my VOG review, it'll
10609000	10611000	probably be on the positive end of things, but
10611000	10613000	it's just, you know, I don't know. There's just something
10613000	10615000	I'm not as like, oh my god!
10615000	10617000	Ermahgerd about it as
10617000	10619000	previous Mario games. Hey, Ranma.
10619000	10621000	Do you have a
10621000	10623000	R4 or anything
10623000	10625000	like that for your DS?
10625000	10627000	Yes, and when you first mentioned a long
10627000	10629000	time ago the new Super Mario Bros 3
10629000	10631000	ROM hack, I went and downloaded it
10631000	10633000	like 10 minutes after the
10633000	10635000	podcast. That game is hard as fuck.
10635000	10637000	That's what I'm saying, though, but I mean,
10637000	10639000	it's pretty awesome. They did all
10639000	10641000	these original levels plus the levels from
10641000	10643000	Super Mario Bros 3, and
10643000	10645000	that took some effort versus
10645000	10647000	rehashing the same old
10647000	10649000	shit again. Yeah.
10649000	10651000	I mean, as
10651000	10653000	I'm controlling the game, I'm not too fond of how they
10653000	10655000	changed how you control Mario, but
10655000	10657000	eh.
10657000	10659000	Alright. Ranma, I gotta wrap up, let you go.
10659000	10661000	Any final thoughts?
10661000	10663000	Erm...
10663000	10665000	Actually, no. Alright, take
10665000	10667000	care, buddy. Alright, later. Bye.
10667000	10669000	I guess we can do one more call. I've seen
10669000	10671000	this one calling in. We'll do one
10671000	10673000	more call. Here we go. Hi, you're on
10673000	10675000	Orange is Orange Radio. Who's this? This is
10675000	10677000	Cody. Cody!
10677000	10679000	What's up, Cody? What's up?
10679000	10681000	I'm actually a first time
10681000	10683000	caller. Long time listener.
10683000	10685000	Long time listener, first time.
10685000	10687000	I was gonna say, I don't recognize this Skype
10687000	10689000	picture. I'm a very visual person. But I like bow ties.
10689000	10691000	Bow ties are cool. It's a very, very nice
10691000	10693000	bow tie. That looks like, did you tie that bow tie
10693000	10695000	yourself on your picture? That is actually,
10695000	10697000	that is a Doctor Who brand
10697000	10699000	bow tie. Oh ho ho. See?
10699000	10701000	Very nice. Do you also wear a fez?
10701000	10703000	You will fit in well here at the Voice of Geeks
10703000	10705000	Network. I do own one.
10705000	10707000	Alright. What's up, Cody?
10707000	10709000	I wanted to call, actually,
10709000	10711000	first off, the whole Wii U thing.
10711000	10713000	I'm kind of the same. I'm
10713000	10715000	on the fence about it as well.
10715000	10717000	About the only thing I use
10717000	10719000	my Wii for right now
10719000	10721000	is Netflix and Skyward Sword.
10721000	10723000	So, I mean,
10723000	10725000	and I really, I've
10725000	10727000	seen a lot of stuff going on
10727000	10729000	with it. Different networks talking
10729000	10731000	about it and, you know, everybody's just, has
10731000	10733000	kind of the same, same
10733000	10735000	take on it, you know? They just,
10735000	10737000	they need to play it. They need
10737000	10739000	to play it and not a lot of people get to play
10739000	10741000	it and I think that's what somebody said in the chat
10741000	10743000	is that not a lot of people get
10743000	10745000	to play it and they haven't had hands on so
10745000	10747000	they don't know how it's going to work. Well, it's, yeah,
10747000	10749000	it's Shadow Next Gen and VXJ
10749000	10751000	both are in chat now kind of talking it up
10751000	10753000	because they both are like, you guys need to play it,
10753000	10755000	you guys need to do the hands on experience, but
10755000	10757000	and I'm sure as
10757000	10759000	the, you know, announcements are made
10759000	10761000	as we get closer to launch day, we're going to start
10761000	10763000	seeing those displays at Best Buys,
10763000	10765000	Game Stops, yada yada, so everybody can
10765000	10767000	get their hands on time, but
10767000	10769000	I don't know, I still
10769000	10771000	am highly skeptical.
10771000	10773000	But that's not a bad thing.
10773000	10775000	It's not a bad thing. I don't
10775000	10777000	hate the Wii U. It's not a bad thing to
10777000	10779000	question, especially after the
10779000	10781000	3DS launch. I don't think it's a bad thing to
10781000	10783000	be concerned. I don't want the Wii U to be.
10783000	10785000	Not at all. Not at all. And I,
10785000	10787000	you know, and I'm so, I
10787000	10789000	was excited about it, you know, especially like you said,
10789000	10791000	Zombie U, when I saw that I was like, whoa, man
10791000	10793000	that looks like an amazing game. And you know,
10793000	10795000	I just, I'm scared that it's
10795000	10797000	going to be kind of like the Vita, and I believe
10797000	10799000	Loki said something about, you know,
10799000	10801000	it's
10801000	10803000	the Vita, you know, had this huge
10803000	10805000	launch of original games and
10805000	10807000	everything, and it still didn't help it.
10807000	10809000	And I think, I
10809000	10811000	kind of think that that's the way that the Wii U is going to
10811000	10813000	turn out, but you know what, we haven't seen it yet,
10813000	10815000	and that's the thing, is you know, we just have to wait.
10815000	10817000	And once we
10817000	10819000	see it, then we'll know.
10819000	10821000	So I, you know, I'm just
10821000	10823000	waiting.
10823000	10825000	Alright, did you say you have something else you want to talk about tonight?
10825000	10827000	Because you said that you got derailed by the Wii U talk,
10827000	10829000	but was there something else on your mind?
10829000	10831000	I just wanted to throw that in there. Also, no, I wanted to
10831000	10833000	say, I actually, I'm an
10833000	10835000	Oklahoman, I think you have a couple Oklahoman
10835000	10837000	callers, or listeners
10837000	10839000	actually, and
10839000	10841000	I was going to say that, I don't know if you guys
10841000	10843000	heard about the Gearbox Community
10843000	10845000	Day?
10845000	10847000	Yeah, I have heard about that. I did hear about that, yeah.
10847000	10849000	I'm actually, I'm trying to
10849000	10851000	go, I want to go, and I
10851000	10853000	want to bring, I actually want to
10853000	10855000	videotape as much as I can, if they'll
10855000	10857000	allow it. But,
10857000	10859000	I'm a big Borderlands
10859000	10861000	whore, I mean, like, I play that game
10861000	10863000	like, constantly, and I think it's
10863000	10865000	because I love RPGs, and I love
10865000	10867000	FPSs, but I suck at FPSs
10867000	10869000	and I'm good at RPGs, so it kind of
10869000	10871000	mixes the two together, and so I think
10871000	10873000	that's why I like it so much. But, I didn't
10873000	10875000	know if you guys heard about that, and
10875000	10877000	I mean, it just looks like a really fun
10877000	10879000	thing to go to. I've never been to any
10879000	10881000	kind of conventions or anything like that, so
10881000	10883000	I'm pretty excited about that.
10883000	10885000	Where are they having this? In
10885000	10887000	Texas.
10887000	10889000	Dallas, yeah.
10889000	10891000	So, they're doing,
10891000	10893000	it's not just Borderlands 2, it's
10893000	10895000	also Aliens vs.
10895000	10897000	Predator, was it Aliens vs. Predator?
10897000	10899000	I'm sorry, Aliens colonial
10899000	10901000	marines. Yeah, colonial marines.
10901000	10903000	And then one more
10903000	10905000	thing, I do know that Allen
10905000	10907000	plays a lot, he's a big
10907000	10909000	fan of Half-Life,
10909000	10911000	and
10911000	10913000	I don't know if he's played this
10913000	10915000	mod before, and I really don't know how long this
10915000	10917000	mod's been out, but it's a Garry's mod,
10917000	10919000	and it's called, oh,
10919000	10921000	Trouble in Terrorist Town?
10921000	10923000	That doesn't
10923000	10925000	sound familiar to me, but he's listening,
10925000	10927000	he's unfortunately not here in the house, he's
10927000	10929000	at work tonight, so I can't ask him in
10929000	10931000	person, but he's listening, so he might
10931000	10933000	pop up in chat or whatever, but it
10933000	10935000	doesn't sound familiar to me. If he
10935000	10937000	hasn't played it, he needs to, because it is
10937000	10939000	the, oh my gosh,
10939000	10941000	it's so fun. It's the
10941000	10943000	most fun of Garry's mod
10943000	10945000	that I've ever had, just with
10945000	10947000	the funny things that happen in the mod, with all
10947000	10949000	the randoms that get thrown in, you know,
10949000	10951000	if you don't have a group of people
10951000	10953000	that go on.
10953000	10955000	It's just so fun. I'm gonna grill you like
10955000	10957000	I did the Wii U lovers. Why?
10957000	10959000	Why is it so damn amazing?
10959000	10961000	I, you know, I don't,
10961000	10963000	I'm not really into a whole lot of multiplayer,
10963000	10965000	and I think it, when it
10965000	10967000	happens, when it comes to like FPS's
10967000	10969000	and stuff like that, I don't really like that a lot.
10969000	10971000	I don't know, it might be because I
10971000	10973000	just am really bad at them, but this game
10973000	10975000	kind of, I don't know, it's just, it's really
10975000	10977000	fun, and it has a lot to do with, you have
10977000	10979000	to figure out who's the traitor
10979000	10981000	in your group, and you have to, like, there's
10981000	10983000	a detective, a traitor, and then I think
10983000	10985000	there's, there's one more, I
10985000	10987000	can't even think of. Is that like
10987000	10989000	the wolf game, or the mafia game,
10989000	10991000	you know, those games that are popular on
10991000	10993000	web forums and conventions and all that?
10993000	10995000	That's kind of what it sounds like to me.
10995000	10997000	Yeah, I mean, it's sort of like
10997000	10999000	that. Sort of. Yeah,
10999000	11001000	but, I mean, it's really fun. See if he wants
11001000	11003000	to check it out. I mean, it's, I think it's a, I'm
11003000	11005000	pretty sure it's a free mod, obviously, but
11005000	11007000	but, yeah, check it out.
11007000	11009000	I mean, I've, go on YouTube,
11009000	11011000	look up all these different, you
11011000	11013000	know, gameplays of it, and it's just so, so
11013000	11015000	hilarious, so. Alright, I'll make
11015000	11017000	him check it out. Sounds great.
11017000	11019000	Alright, well, Codeman, thanks, or excuse me, Cody,
11019000	11021000	thanks so much for calling into
11021000	11023000	the show tonight. I appreciate it, and
11023000	11025000	yeah, you call in any time.
11025000	11027000	No problem, and, you know, I was
11027000	11029000	actually, I had a tweet last week
11029000	11031000	telling
11031000	11033000	you guys about a Borderlands 2
11033000	11035000	giveaway, and I don't know if I remember. Oh, that was you!
11035000	11037000	It is me! Yeah, it was you!
11037000	11039000	Okay. I was an
11039000	11041000	idiot and didn't link the freaking
11041000	11043000	YouTube video. Alright, plug
11043000	11045000	away. Oh, um,
11045000	11047000	I actually, I have a small gaming
11047000	11049000	channel on YouTube. It's not huge.
11049000	11051000	I don't get paid for it or anything like that. I just enjoy
11051000	11053000	gaming and showing people my games.
11053000	11055000	Hey, it's what we're doing here. It's the exact same thing
11055000	11057000	we do here, except we're audio.
11057000	11059000	Oh, yes.
11059000	11061000	And my channel is just funny commentary,
11061000	11063000	but, yeah, I'm giving away
11063000	11065000	a copy of Borderlands 2.
11065000	11067000	I mean, it's any platform
11067000	11069000	out there that's,
11069000	11071000	you know, gonna be out PC, PS3,
11071000	11073000	360, Steam, any
11073000	11075000	of that, so, um,
11075000	11077000	but, yeah, it's, um,
11077000	11079000	actually, my YouTube channel is
11079000	11081000	linked in my Skype, if you wanna,
11081000	11083000	but I can say it on here, if you want.
11083000	11085000	Yeah, you better say it, because it'll take me too long
11085000	11087000	to bring it up, so go ahead. Spell it or whatever.
11087000	11089000	Um, it's, it's, uh,
11089000	11091000	www.youtube.com
11091000	11095000	backslash ctaylor1785
11095000	11097000	ctaylor1785.
11097000	11099000	You know, I gotta be honest,
11099000	11101000	buddy, you wanna get some more hits on your YouTube channel,
11101000	11103000	you're gonna have to come up with something really catchy.
11103000	11105000	1785 is hard to remember,
11105000	11107000	so, we'll see.
11107000	11109000	Well, it was kind of funny, because I
11109000	11111000	came up with the YouTube channel a long time ago,
11111000	11113000	but never did anything, and so now I can't
11113000	11115000	change it, and now my channel's
11115000	11117000	called Codeman Games.
11117000	11119000	Okay, that's good. That's good.
11119000	11121000	Or I was gonna say, like, how about, like,
11121000	11123000	Tailored Games or something silly, I don't know.
11123000	11125000	But the video,
11125000	11127000	if anybody's wanted, the video is
11127000	11129000	called, um, I believe it's called
11129000	11131000	That Robot Has a Temper. I actually have a cell
11131000	11133000	phone call with Claptrap, and he's, like,
11133000	11135000	cussing and all this different stuff, so it's
11135000	11137000	pretty fun. And, uh, yeah, but just
11137000	11139000	tell me, you know, if they want a free copy, you know,
11139000	11141000	just send them on over. Alright.
11141000	11143000	Poor people who love
11143000	11145000	Borderlands. Hey, I'm poor.
11145000	11147000	I got a four month old.
11147000	11149000	You're not that poor if you're giving away a copy
11149000	11151000	of Borderlands 2. No, I think that's great.
11151000	11153000	I, I, uh, I,
11153000	11155000	I fully support the indie press in all forms,
11155000	11157000	so go check that out, everybody. Alright, good luck
11157000	11159000	with your YouTubes, and we'll talk to you in a later week,
11159000	11161000	okay? Alright, thank you, Rob. I appreciate it.
11161000	11163000	No problem. Take care, buddy.
11163000	11165000	You too. Bye.
11165000	11167000	Alright, that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight. That was a good
11167000	11169000	guy. I love the long time listener
11169000	11171000	first time callers, and he handled that very well.
11171000	11173000	He didn't, he didn't freeze up.
11173000	11175000	Sometimes people, when they're new, like, hello, hello,
11175000	11177000	am I on? Hello? Hello? Echo? What? Hello?
11177000	11179000	He was... Very good, uh, phone presence.
11179000	11181000	Yes. You get a, I don't,
11181000	11183000	I don't know if we could give a gold star for that,
11183000	11185000	but you would definitely get, like, a silver star.
11185000	11187000	Alright.
11187000	11189000	Platinum for me.
11189000	11191000	Alright, uh, that's gonna do it.
11191000	11193000	For the bow tie, for the bow tie. Yeah, that's true.
11193000	11195000	The bow tie was pretty awesome. Alright, that's gonna do it
11195000	11197000	for the, uh, Skype calls tonight.
11197000	11199000	If you didn't get through, don't be mad.
11199000	11201000	Send tweets. You know, TigerClaw's
11201000	11203000	like the only one that's been sending tweets this week,
11203000	11205000	so you can either send tweets, or, you can send us
11205000	11207000	an email. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
11207000	11209000	Speaking of TigerClaw's tweets,
11209000	11211000	I did want to get through these real quick.
11211000	11213000	Uncharted and The Director Changeover.
11213000	11215000	Uh, David O. Russell
11215000	11217000	had been on there. He had made the movie
11217000	11219000	I Heart Huckabees. Well, he's not there anymore.
11219000	11221000	Neil Berger left the project.
11221000	11223000	Uh, who is on the project now?
11223000	11225000	The, the writers of
11225000	11227000	National Treasure,
11227000	11229000	Marianne and Cormac Wiberly.
11229000	11231000	God, I hate Nicolas Cage.
11231000	11233000	It's like, I have no frame
11233000	11235000	of reference, cause I refuse to see those movies.
11235000	11237000	You know what? The only good thing
11237000	11239000	he did was raising Arizona. They seem
11239000	11241000	topical enough.
11241000	11243000	I don't know. I guess I could see
11243000	11245000	a movie like that leading to Uncharted, but
11245000	11247000	alright. So, there you go.
11247000	11249000	Um,
11249000	11251000	let's see. Oh, Neil Berger
11251000	11253000	directed Limitless,
11253000	11255000	and he left, and then he
11255000	11257000	he had replaced somebody else.
11257000	11259000	So, who's directing it now?
11259000	11261000	I don't think they have a
11261000	11263000	director right now. I'm looking right now.
11263000	11265000	It's not gonna happen. Who knows?
11265000	11267000	They may still make one.
11267000	11269000	Nope, they just say
11269000	11271000	somebody left. Alright. Uh,
11271000	11273000	one more. Oh, I like this. This is
11273000	11275000	nice. Out
11275000	11277000	of all the bad news we've had
11277000	11279000	tonight, I like
11279000	11281000	a little bit of good news. So, thank you,
11281000	11283000	Tigerclaw, for sending this. And I think this is
11283000	11285000	a good note to end on tonight, although Loki
11285000	11287000	may have last minute stories. Actually, no, I want to end on
11287000	11289000	this. Loki, do you have any last minute stories before I get to this?
11289000	11291000	Eh, some, some MMOs
11291000	11293000	stole a map from Counter-Strike.
11293000	11295000	That's all we need to know. Big deal.
11295000	11297000	Alright.
11297000	11299000	Here you go. A nice thing to end on.
11299000	11301000	Thank you, Tigerclaw. Microsoft
11301000	11303000	is throwing an industry mixer
11303000	11305000	for the folks from OnLive
11305000	11307000	who are affected by the restructuring.
11307000	11309000	Uh, they are scouting
11309000	11311000	for Xbox-oriented positions
11311000	11313000	for Mountain View, California, and
11313000	11315000	Redmond, Washington. A quote from
11315000	11317000	Microsoft on the public invitation,
11317000	11319000	We are eager to speak to individuals and teams
11319000	11321000	affected by the OnLive transition.
11321000	11323000	We are looking to add key
11323000	11325000	players who want to make a real impact
11325000	11327000	in creating groundbreaking new products
11327000	11329000	and services. I gotta
11329000	11331000	say, what a great way to answer
11331000	11333000	Sony getting Gaikai.
11333000	11335000	Just hire the old OnLive employees
11335000	11337000	for your company. Sounds good.
11337000	11339000	Amazing. Amazing.
11339000	11341000	Oh, Dark Tetsuya sending a late tweet here.
11341000	11343000	I finished updating the wiki
11343000	11345000	with recently found episodes.
11345000	11347000	So, Dark Tetsuya doing a wiki
11347000	11349000	update. Thank you, Dark Tetsuya.
11349000	11351000	Thank you, fans, for updating
11351000	11353000	that wiki. You guys are amazing.
11353000	11355000	orangeloungeradio.wikia
11355000	11357000	W-I-K-I-A dot com.
11357000	11359000	You guys make sure that I don't repeat games.
11359000	11361000	You use it as a source.
11361000	11363000	I use it all the time.
11363000	11365000	It impacts what we do here on the show.
11365000	11367000	Alright, I see you guys are packing up. I know you gotta
11367000	11369000	get out. We all got work tomorrow. We've gone
11369000	11371000	long tonight. But thank you guys for staying up
11371000	11373000	late with us. We really appreciate it. We can't
11373000	11375000	end the show, however, until we get to the final thoughts.
11375000	11377000	So, let's do some final thoughts.
11377000	11379000	Um, Dark Sakura, start us off
11379000	11381000	tonight. I don't want to go to bed.
11381000	11383000	Uh, Loki,
11383000	11385000	your final thoughts tonight? Um,
11385000	11387000	I don't know.
11387000	11389000	I want to wear this shirt to work.
11389000	11391000	I'm going to. Alright,
11391000	11393000	you should. Um, my final thought
11393000	11395000	is, because I neglected to say
11395000	11397000	it at the start of part B, as
11397000	11399000	I plan to, I do want to say
11399000	11401000	rest in peace to Neil Armstrong.
11401000	11403000	Um, but what an amazing
11403000	11405000	life to have actually gone
11405000	11407000	to the moon. I mean, that's something we all dream about
11407000	11409000	as kids. And, like, he actually did it.
11409000	11411000	So, yes, it's unfortunate that
11411000	11413000	he passed, but let's not focus on the
11413000	11415000	fact he died. Let's focus on the fact
11415000	11417000	that, like, like
11417000	11419000	he did something that all of us dream about.
11419000	11421000	And I think that's just amazing.
11421000	11423000	So, a tip of the hat to Neil Armstrong.
11423000	11425000	That's going to do it for. Well, that doesn't
11425000	11427000	directly actually go with video games, too.
11427000	11429000	How so? Do you know that?
11429000	11431000	Because Buzz Aldrin was the voice of the guy in the end
11431000	11433000	of Mass Effect 3. Sure, sure.
11433000	11435000	You know, they were all kind of. That's a tie.
11435000	11437000	I'm just trying to say. But, yeah,
11437000	11439000	that was pretty. And Phyllis Diller.
11439000	11441000	Yeah, rest in peace Phyllis Diller.
11441000	11443000	She was so awesome. We've lost a lot of great people
11443000	11445000	over the past couple of weeks. It's really sad. And the guy who was the
11445000	11447000	Count. Mm-hmm.
11447000	11449000	And Cry. Yeah. Tragic, tragic.
11449000	11451000	And the lady who was the astronaut.
11451000	11453000	Sally Ride. Yeah.
11453000	11455000	That was a few weeks ago. We didn't
11455000	11457000	mention it on the show. It may have been a week you weren't here,
11457000	11459000	but. That means just, like, a bunch of people just.
11459000	11461000	Yeah. It's very unfortunate. Very unfortunate.
11461000	11463000	But, um, you know,
11463000	11465000	look at accomplishments. Look ahead.
11465000	11467000	Look ahead to two weeks.
11467000	11469000	We'll be back with an all new episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
