10035	26749	Sky, and Loki Tonight, August 26th, 2012 More unfortunate layoffs hit the industry A company requests its game be pulled from store shelves And are 90% of PC game installs pirated copies?
32276	38042	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
38102	46410	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live as we are every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
47051	50915	Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.
50935	53798	That's where you can participate with our show in the chat room.
53818	55960	And if you are listening live at VOG Network tonight...
56460	59783	Check out our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com.
59863	63626	This is episode number 471 for this August 26th, 2012.
64927	73274	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about what is going on with the game industry with my friends, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
73514	73754	Hi.
74154	74595	How are you?
75555	77297	I feel vaguely fit.
77837	78518	You feel fit?
79118	79518	Vaguely.
79639	82461	You feel pretty and witty and... Hey.
83181	83321	Shh.
83862	83922	Shh.
84721	85282	Well, I don't know.
85342	86363	Everyone a little gay.
89488	89828	That's good.
90149	91070	It's good to feel healthy.
91471	95076	Because I've had days where I feel healthy, and I've had days where I feel fat.
95897	98140	You know, and sometimes a fat day is good, too, once in a while.
98240	99883	But healthy is a good feeling, too.
100163	113386	Well, it was just like, my intention is to walk a few days each week, and I decided to go walking, but I don't know if I've said it on the show before, but I wear Vibram five fingers, which are like the toe shoes.
113526	114706	You wear the glove shoes.
115086	115746	They're awesome.
115766	119227	You make your feet look like hands.
119287	120107	They're creepy.
120927	123768	Well, but it makes your feet walk how you're supposed to walk.
123848	125268	Makes you look like Spider-Man.
125988	128230	It's how people are supposed to walk is the thing.
129111	134436	Not to go too deep into it, but our modern tennis shoes have changed the way people walk for the worse.
135137	137799	That's where a lot of injuries come about.
138199	140241	I'm really getting back to the barefoot walking thing.
140261	141182	Sorry for the echo.
143684	149951	And I really love them, but it makes me think more and more that humanity is not meant to walk on concrete.
150551	152934	Concrete is terrible, terrible, terrible stuff.
153775	157118	And so my feet did not hurt until I walked on concrete.
157138	158580	When I walked in the grass, no more hurt.
160069	160730	But it was a good walk.
161950	162271	That's good.
162311	163251	I got outside.
164972	165573	Outside.
165753	166854	Going outside is good.
166974	170196	Everybody should put down the controller or the keyboard and go outside once in a while.
170356	173178	However, I was listening to the Mass Effect soundtrack.
174599	176200	That's how you can make your worlds collide.
176260	176721	There you go.
177401	178943	Alright, by the way, I apologize.
179244	183670	One of the perks about listening live to Orange Launch Radio is that you can check into the show live.
184231	185233	The check-ins are now up.
185413	192223	I forgot to do that because I was sidetracked during the pre-show and I literally sat down seconds before I picked up the microphone and went live.
192263	193525	So the check-ins are now up.
193985	194365	There you go.
194645	197247	For those of you listening on the podcast, you can also check in.
197267	202270	Just listen for the little noise, the do-do-do-do-do-do, little victory sound, and then it'll tell you the passphrase.
202590	204611	It is somewhere in the show.
204631	205712	We have to make sure you're listening to it.
205752	207673	So it's somewhere different in the show every week.
208414	210235	Anyhow, also say hello to... What?
210655	210995	Damn it.
211035	212316	That song is in my head now.
212336	214918	The song from An American Tale, the Somewhere Out There...
215600	217703	Is that what the check-in noise sounds like?
218103	222448	No, when you said somewhere, I was like, that song is stuck in my head.
222528	224130	I haven't thought of that song in years.
224971	225492	Damn it, Rob.
226313	226934	I'm sorry.
227995	228816	I don't know what to tell you.
231693	236475	I was going to play this really quick here, if I can find it here.
236716	241658	I don't know if you've heard this, DarkSakura, because I know you don't listen really back to the podcast, because you're on it, so you don't have to.
242018	243999	But this is a little noise.
244199	246721	Now, this is not the actual noise, but this is it.
248582	250563	Isn't that kind of catchy, right?
250683	250863	Yeah.
251423	252904	Now that's going to get stuck in your head right there.
253224	255005	That's a little Bobby Blackwolf original right there.
257112	258537	It's like, I have an idea!
260123	260404	Okay.
260585	261468	Let's introduce Loki!
263260	265201	Techmaster Loki is here tonight too.
265241	265521	Hi.
265781	266502	How are you doing, Loki?
267122	267722	I'm full now.
267922	268483	You're full?
268883	270784	Yeah, because I... Full of rage.
271224	271564	I know.
272425	277087	I bought one of the Memphis barbecue burgers over at Carl's Jr.
277307	277647	Hardee's.
278348	280629	That is drenched in barbecue sauce.
280669	281589	It is.
281649	288032	I normally get the single, and the single's normally enough, but I hadn't eaten really today, so I was like, okay, I'll go with the $6 burger.
288132	289473	I really should have just stuck with the single.
289493	290434	The single is enough.
291374	292354	But it's delicious.
292414	297136	And what makes it delicious is the fact that it combines not only a cheeseburger but pulled pork.
297757	301698	So you've got barbecued pulled pork and a cheeseburger with more barbecue sauce on it.
302279	302919	And onion rings.
304720	305540	It's fantastic.
306277	306737	Delicious.
307518	308618	I like their Western burger.
308959	310199	Western bacon or whatever burger.
310219	311020	Yeah, that's normally what I get.
311280	314402	But remember we just had this discussion about healthy days and fat days.
314822	317423	If I have one of those, I'm definitely having a fat day.
317463	322126	Well, that's how I discovered it because I went to go get – I normally don't go to Carl's Jr.
322166	327089	that much because it's further away from my work than normal, the other fast food places.
327229	330971	So I just – I was like, I'm tired of eating McDonald's or Burger King.
330991	332412	I'm just going to go to Carl's Jr.
332452	332652	today.
333132	336316	And so I went there to get the Double Western and I saw that they had this burger.
336336	337778	I'm like, hey, I like pulled pork.
338218	340942	I'm going to get a single because I'm not that hungry.
341682	342704	And it was delicious.
343366	347668	I swear I don't have delusions or anything that our show is that big in the scope of things.
347688	354472	We don't have a whole ton of listeners, though we do love the family we have that participates with us live in the podcast.
354772	362836	But it would be great if somebody deemed our audience large enough to get a food sponsorship with as much as we talk up the different foods.
363876	372641	We need to start censoring all the food titles that we... We're going to go get yogurt after the show at...
374531	380137	No, instead what you do is instead of doing the beep, you add like a sound file that says nom.
380217	384721	So every time you talk about, yeah, I totally had that burger at nom, nom, nom, nom.
386523	387904	Get the little kitty nom, nom, nom.
387944	388825	Nom, nom, nom.
389185	390587	Yeah, but then you're talking about editing.
391227	395649	That's why I like to do live radio because it doesn't involve editing, if you haven't noticed.
395669	400331	I also like to do live radio because we have the chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
400792	407635	And Bobby, in reference to me playing the theme a little bit before, said, now people are going to think that the check-ins are happening that early.
407775	408715	Well, gotcha.
409195	411076	I just want to make sure everybody was paying attention.
411937	417840	So like the people that are kind of just doing data entry in the background and zoning out and all that.
419500	420741	Now that I have your attention...
423055	423575	Watermelons.
423795	424015	Okay.
424536	425756	Anyway, let's see.
425936	428637	Also, what are the other comments in chat?
429257	432498	Somebody said, oh, Tigerclaw said you can use that sound when there's breaking news.
432819	436540	But then we can't jack the NBC breaking news theme, which is so epic.
437375	437955	It is epic.
438415	445977	You know, as much as people hate NBC after the Olympics and all that crap, you have to admit, NBC gets some epic fucking music for their presentations.
446017	447577	Like, you know, the Olympic theme?
448017	449017	That shit is epic.
449097	451598	I realize, like, John Williams did that, not some NBC dude.
451658	452698	I played that in high school band.
453418	454558	And didn't you feel epic?
455719	462280	We can start stealing... Especially since I played saxophone and got the little... We can start stealing the Game of Thrones theme.
462300	463660	I mean, that's pretty epic, too.
464901	466241	No chair of swords allowed.
467461	468782	But the theme's awesome, okay?
468822	472424	Separate from the whole... If you want awesome, we should just use the Xena theme.
474024	475065	Yeah.
477466	479927	No, that's if we want the show to have lesbian undertones.
480948	482109	I have no problem with this.
482149	483269	Maybe in a future week.
483709	487391	How do you have lesbian undertones when there's two men and a woman?
487631	488872	I'm not sure how that works.
488892	489592	She's double lesbian.
489612	490493	I like boobs too.
493134	500136	You'll have to like your own boobs, though, unless we get some lady callers later, which is always a distinct possibility when we take live calls from our chat room later.
500156	501757	Should I ask everyone about their boobs?
503017	504998	Do you want to have booby chat tonight with the callers?
505158	505978	No, thank you.
506278	509139	I don't know if any of our women would call in to do booby chat.
509679	525907	The show, well, Syl would totally do it, but the show's on too late for her, because she's on the other side of the pond, and they're eight hours ahead of us, so if you have to stay up anywhere in the UK, really, no matter where you're at, Britain, Scotland, Ireland, I know we have listeners in all those places, and what time is the show live here?
525927	526687	I miss our Swede.
526927	527348	2 a.m.
528068	528868	I miss our Swedes.
529689	530949	Yeah, we had a couple folks in Sweden.
531430	534491	I did see, I don't know if you've looked at email, but we do have an email from Belgium tonight.
535271	536172	I love Belgium!
536232	536672	Me too.
536992	537913	I love waffles.
540026	540566	It should be beer.
564742	565743	I want to ask this question.
590024	591286	and Pinkberry.
591366	591807	And I'm wondering...
606147	607248	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
636047	638988	I proposed to my husband of marathoning Super Mario World.
640408	641188	Super Mario World.
641488	645769	However, I also just proposed to Becky of marathoning Mass Effect 2 on Saturday.
645809	646730	You do that anyway.
646970	655132	No, I play Mass Effect 3 for me, which means I have to finish it before we finish Mass Effect 2 for her so that I can play through Mass Effect 3 while she watches.
657232	685602	you know what would be fun actually you should try this Jamie is marathoning romhacks for Mario Brothers that would be awesome I would scream so much well not necessarily the ones that are insanely hard but just the new ones like they have some really good romhacks that and like Link to the Past has some really good romhacks I'm like I kind of want to play this because it's different it's like going into Link to the Past for the first time again and it's kind of cool that sounds really cool to me
686173	690636	Except the whole thing is actually breaking out the systems and playing.
691336	700922	The other thing that we had, we actually just watched a whole, Dan and I watched a whole playthrough of Vampire Killer on MSX, which came out after the Castlevania that we got on the NES.
702283	706786	But it sort of inspired me to want to actually play through Dracula X again.
708427	710428	It sort of sounded like a classic gaming weekend.
711588	711948	Sounds like fun.
711968	712549	Plus Mass Effect.
712829	713369	Because Garrus.
713769	718531	Maybe it would also be a fun weekend to go out to like the flea markets around and try to find some more classic games.
718551	719051	Let's do it.
719231	719551	And then?
719871	720212	And then?
720492	720892	If it's not 105.
720932	721172	And then?
721212	722232	No and then.
722612	723173	It's supposed to be.
723213	723453	And then?
723833	724213	No and then.
724373	724933	Farmer's Market.
726214	727014	Mexican candy.
728014	728575	Loki got it.
728935	730115	All right.
730155	731456	Dude, where's my car?
731636	732156	Loki.
732996	734857	What do you need to catch up on over the long weekend?
735738	741242	Honestly, what I've been trying to do is stop doing modding stuff.
741322	745506	Because I have people that ask me for Grand Theft Auto mod stuff.
745526	748128	They're like, I can't port my map mods over.
748168	748768	Can you do it for me?
749149	751271	So I waste a whole fucking week doing that shit.
751311	752412	And it just gets so tiring.
752772	754133	Because I'm like, I don't want to do this.
754233	757055	But yet, for some stupid reason, they keep saying, yes, I'll do it for you.
758096	760819	So I'd like to just not do that and actually play games.
761159	761279	And...
762660	766322	But at the same time, I don't really know what games I'd want to play.
766482	771104	I want to play Minecraft on 360 with other people, but there's no one on.
771184	772925	There's a way to burn an entire weekend.
773125	775066	Seriously, but there's nobody to play with.
775186	775767	That's the thing.
776207	778748	Although I do have one of the people that's on my friends list.
778808	782150	He keeps wanting to play, but it's always when I'm on break at work.
782490	786532	I'm like, dude, I can't play with you right now because I'm going to have five minutes and that's it.
787192	789233	Because I'll be on my 360 during break.
789293	789453	But...
790854	792195	I just, there's no one to play with.
792235	800841	I really wish that Minecraft on the 360 had an option to randomly connect you to like a server that, you know, has, okay, allow strangers to connect or something like that.
801341	805204	Or, you know, have that option where I can allow strangers to connect to my server.
805224	809026	Granted, you run the risk of someone, you know, going through and griefing and stuff, but...
809947	810907	You can always ban them.
812248	813228	And I would just kind of like that.
813248	816729	So I'd be able to play with random people and actually get a multiplayer game going.
816749	819070	Because it's kind of boring with just one or two people.
819090	822111	Because we've been playing, we actually started yet another world.
824452	826973	And we actually picked the tutorial world this time.
827253	832555	Which is kind of fun because it made it a little more interesting because there's actual things built in, little hidden things to find.
833495	855230	and you can you know you didn't have to worry about right away okay I need to find stuff to make sticky pistons I'll just steal some out of the stuff that's already built which is kind of cool or hey you know I need to go find some diamonds to make some diamond armor and stuff oh wait I know where the hidden thing is where there's some diamond stuff so that's kind of cool or I'm gonna need some wood so I'm gonna just tear down this house instead of those already built and so that was kind of fun
856110	858291	For a little bit, and then it got boring again.
858512	859432	And that's the problem.
859472	865376	It's just, it's so far behind the PC version that it's kind of boring.
865596	872260	Whereas, like, I'm reading about, like, the cool PC stuff that they're adding now and, like, the kind of snapshots for each week.
872620	888349	and it sounds pretty awesome like they're adding all this new stuff like new monsters that look really fucking hard to kill I mean that would be really cool in the 360 version but it's just not there so I guess I have to start playing the PC version since I bought it that would be kind of fun maybe I should do that but
888909	893793	Once again, I need people to play with, and I don't want to play with random strangers.
894414	896796	Are you upset that I haven't been signing on to Xbox lately?
896836	897717	Is that what this is all about?
897777	898978	Well, just everybody.
899018	899338	No one is.
899358	905483	Seriously, I launch Minecraft almost every single day, and there's no one on, ever.
905603	906784	That reminds me of... I don't know.
906944	907125	Wow.
909348	912930	That's going to start picking up real soon, though, with the expansion.
912990	923657	I'm not really trying to get into any games right now, start anything new, because Borderlands 2 is coming out, and I know that's going to be a big time drain right there.
923777	928320	That'll probably be the one game I play until Call of Duty Black Ops 2, I think.
929001	931843	Let's go to some comments from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
932303	934805	SSJ100Matt says, I know what Loki can do during the break.
935025	936986	Update the OLR PSP site.
937146	937927	That's not going to happen.
939307	942548	It's time to start on the PSV.
942848	945169	OLRPSV.com that doesn't exist yet.
946129	947049	I don't want to do that.
947209	948730	No one cares anymore.
949210	951210	OLR3DS.com not happening?
951250	951650	No.
951870	952971	OLRWU.com?
952991	959372	See, the problem is now all these things have web browsers and hopefully they all support HTML5 and so that's not even an issue anymore.
959412	962673	You can just go to our site at thevognetwork.com and
964301	967302	Just listen without having to, you know.
968582	982306	One thing we do need to look into doing, though, at some point is remaking the OrangeLoungeRadio.com site because now we kind of have a lot of our, like, forum resources and community resources are pouring in to trying to pool together with the other shows to make VOGNetwork.com bigger.
982786	987347	OrangeLoungeRadio.com was probably more about us and our history and our shows and so forth.
987387	990028	So it would be fun to have something for that, you know.
990348	990608	It would...
990928	998896	To me, I mean, I think it'd be kind of cool like how we had on all games a while back where it was just a section of the website.
998916	1000998	It's like, okay, here's the Orange Lounge radio section.
1001018	1008405	There's a section for each show and just have it linked to that and just make something cool there on our own site on VOG so we don't have to like...
1009165	1011067	We have forums already.
1011107	1013028	The forums in the Orange Launch site are kind of dead.
1013969	1019352	They're technically supposed to be closed by now because we're going to fold them into the VOG Network forums that are a little more active.
1019452	1020793	So that's what I'm saying.
1020833	1023835	Just kind of erase the site.
1024356	1028919	Because we were already doing everything that we were doing on that site anyways on VOG.
1028959	1030480	So just kind of move it over.
1030780	1032481	If you have ideas, we'd love to hear them.
1032521	1037563	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com And some of the folks in chat room are talking about apps and so forth.
1038503	1040624	I have to learn how to program.
1040644	1041905	As soon as I learn how to make apps.
1042105	1044506	I know somebody that makes apps, but they have other priorities.
1044706	1045246	I almost...
1046656	1047497	LocoRoco's Cousin
1066957	1072120	Loco Poco says, I need to catch up on Folklore, Resonance of Fate, and Valkyria Chronicles.
1072160	1073120	Those are all excellent choices.
1073600	1075881	Valkyria Chronicles is one of my personal ones, too.
1075941	1080464	We've had that on PS3, I don't know how long, and I've yet to make a lot of progress in that game, but it's really fun.
1081544	1087027	TigerClaw says, in reality, Sky just wants to go to Disneyland again, lol, in regards to the week off.
1087427	1087748	Rob, what?
1106049	1107191	Not and I, and me.
1108432	1109073	It's an object.
1109153	1110094	No one cur.
1110134	1110434	All right.
1110894	1111435	Moving on.
1112736	1113117	Let's see.
1113317	1124829	Oh, and lastly, in reference to the mental image I put in all your heads earlier, VXJasonXV in our chat room says, Oh, and now that underwear is involved, video live stream.
1125750	1126631	Y'all are perverts.
1127757	1132460	I would love to do a live stream, not of that, of the games, but it's technology.
1132620	1135861	Well, I do want to do live streaming stuff.
1135901	1141044	I have about two or three capture cards or capture devices.
1141064	1142105	Set that crap up over here.
1142125	1142485	I know we do.
1142505	1143125	We can do that.
1143806	1144326	It's fun.
1144506	1146187	It's a little bit more complicated.
1146207	1147648	I always watch the playthroughs.
1148948	1151470	Freddie Wong, they've been doing a land game on PC of Minecraft.
1154031	1157133	and it looks so much fun playing with other people.
1157473	1164998	It's just like, okay, everybody gets one life and we're just going to work together and we're going to do this stuff and then they just kind of film it and edit it together and it looks fun.
1165018	1167100	I'm like, I just want to do that.
1167180	1168401	I want to play with those people.
1168561	1169061	Good times.
1169461	1180889	I did not, you got me sidetracked though because in reference to the comment that Jason made, now that underwear is involved, video live stream, I had the chance to play my favorite Tyra Banks clip that I haven't played on the show in years.
1186473	1197222	Because today, today is a panty porter!
1199876	1201917	That's going to be my Labor Day weekend right there.
1201997	1202758	Panty party.
1202978	1209282	You know, my wife, ever since the passing of Whitney Houston, has kind of latched on to Tyra Banks instead.
1209302	1210103	I've noticed.
1210443	1216348	As kind of observing the train wreck that's happening.
1216368	1222892	Because Whitney Houston, well, she used to like watching Whitney Houston's Facebook page because there's a lot of stupid people that comment on there.
1223173	1224333	But Tyra's page...
1225214	1229920	Tyra posts a lot of really stupid things, and it's funny.
1230120	1238530	I'll tell you one of my... I mean, this has absolutely nothing to do with video games, but this is kind of a game in itself, and it has to do with Facebook, which is, you know, big for gaming, right?
1239170	1240172	This is hilarious, but...
1240652	1248417	Go to various fast food and chain restaurants and just go to the thing that lets you see what everybody's posting on there.
1248697	1251679	And I'm not even talking like the controversial shit like Chick-fil-A.
1252000	1258664	Like go on Facebook and look up like the Olive Gardens page, Red Lobster, Applebee's.
1259405	1263627	You will see some amazing shit that people post on those pages.
1264188	1270412	Everywhere from complaints about a particular restaurant to somebody making a post like,
1270892	1273813	So and so just took me here to Applebee's for my anniversary.
1273853	1274793	I'm so excited.
1274853	1279674	There's a picture of them smiling because people don't understand privacy controls.
1280094	1286355	That just makes me think of a line from one of my favorite comics, Henry Cho, who's not related to Margaret Cho, although he is Korean.
1287255	1287916	Born in Tennessee.
1290136	1293417	Talking about his brother-in-law from Arab, Alabama.
1294297	1294437	Yeah.
1296001	1297982	We just got a new Italian restaurant.
1298482	1299482	It ain't no Olive Garden.
1323067	1327533	Alright, quickly, my weekend, my plans for the weekend.
1327934	1336866	I think it would be really fun to do an epic Civ V match that goes all weekend long, but I don't know if I can find any other suckers that would buy into that.
1337006	1339370	I know someone who plays on Xbox, but I don't think he plays online.
1341491	1345013	Xbox One is different because that's the Civ Revolution and those games can go a lot faster.
1345053	1346074	You can do one of those in a night.
1346094	1352238	But I'm talking like Civilization V Epic Mode, although that game would take months to finish.
1352598	1358302	But you could even do just even a normal game takes forever in Civilization V. That would be fun.
1358342	1359503	DayZ would be fun too.
1359523	1364726	I guess that's going back to games that would be fun to do a live stream of.
1365046	1369451	Actually, live streaming PC games might... It's still difficult.
1370432	1371674	But yeah, DayZ would be fun.
1372216	1373317	Hang on, we got zombies.
1374978	1375859	Crazy person.
1376600	1380343	The other game I really need to catch up on is Borderlands.
1381224	1382024	But let's be real.
1382445	1391693	There's so much happening on Tuesday between the official launch of Guild Wars 2, the patch in Warcraft, Rock Band Blitz, Mass Effect 3 DLC.
1392373	1396236	There's no way I'm playing catch up over the weekend because I have to play everything that came out on Tuesday.
1397137	1398018	It's a fun game.
1398058	1398699	You playing on PC?
1398719	1398859	Oh yeah.
1414115	1414715	Allen has it too.
1415316	1415997	We can all play.
1416017	1416517	There you go.
1417158	1418219	Bobby's been wanting to play too.
1418719	1419160	There we go.
1419220	1419820	The foursome.
1420081	1420561	There we go.
1421042	1421322	All right.
1422483	1427288	Let's talk about our actual gaming weeks, the stuff we have been playing this week.
1427988	1428789	More current stuff.
1428809	1429330	Yeah, DarkSakura.
1429350	1431392	Can I say one more thing about the week in general?
1431492	1431772	Of course.
1432253	1433574	I did a good deed this weekend.
1433894	1434154	Oh, yeah?
1434715	1437778	We rescued a kitten from the dumpster outside my synagogue.
1438044	1443391	Now, before people start crying, you found out nobody left the cat in the dumpster until... No.
1443591	1444252	He was feral.
1444512	1446094	Little faith in humanity restored.
1446383	1447444	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1470465	1471786	Fixed and adopted out.
1472446	1475988	So I just want to say for anyone who's asked, the kitty story has a happy ending.
1476308	1476809	Yay.
1476829	1479730	And his official name is Donut.
1479830	1480631	They've called him Donut.
1481691	1482452	Instead of Bat Cat.
1482472	1482952	That's a good name.
1483152	1483732	I like Donut.
1484073	1486474	I'm just glad I don't have those cats in our backyard anymore.
1486814	1488295	We had 11 cats at one time.
1488495	1488995	Oh, Lord.
1489315	1491997	All I know is I got a text message from DarkSakura on Friday night.
1492137	1492857	Do you want a kitten?
1493298	1497320	And I'm like, um, we have a tiny ass apartment and two cats already.
1497900	1499501	I would love to, but no.
1499781	1503503	Yeah, Shermie would be too old for me to have a little feral kitten in the house to tame.
1503903	1506144	I mean, he's only six weeks old, so he's tameable.
1506724	1512466	All right, before we get into our regular gaming weeks and what we have been playing, I do want to talk to the chatters.
1512626	1518428	WhatUpG leaves a comment about Tuesday saying, Sky forgot the biggest game release, Madden 13.
1519809	1524731	Although certainly I will acknowledge that will be a huge game release and lots of people are going to be playing that over the Labor Day weekend.
1525411	1530093	My household won't be one of them because that's not really a series we've ever gotten into.
1530154	1531654	I'm not a big football person.
1531674	1539238	If you're not a fan of that and for whatever reason you just don't download games off the PlayStation, there's a Journey Collector's Edition coming out this week on disc.
1539758	1551264	It's got the soundtrack, you get Journey, you get Flower Flow, and also two little quick games that they made and a month of PlayStation Plus.
1551837	1556560	That's a great deal if you don't have any of those games because all three of those games are great.
1557441	1560382	Well, I don't even know if you could call Flow a game, but whatever.
1560442	1561863	It's all right.
1561943	1565646	They're neat, but Journey is amazing.
1566146	1567567	Contender for Game of the Year, to be honest.
1567727	1568507	I won't stop believing.
1568948	1569988	All right, not that Journey.
1570489	1571850	This is the 2012 Journey.
1572130	1575392	That might make it a little bit better if it had Journey music in there, but their music was pretty good.
1575412	1576132	A little mishmash.
1576172	1577593	I'm sure somebody's done that on YouTube.
1577633	1578494	Journey set to Journey?
1578554	1579014	I've seen it.
1579254	1579534	Okay.
1580835	1585279	The music in Journey 2012 is legitimately really good.
1586059	1591543	As much as I love Journey 1980s, you can't do that to Journey 2012.
1591863	1594786	The music in Journey 2012 is so flipping good.
1594846	1603472	Can we get a Journey 2012 2 where it's basically the premise of Revolution X but with Journey instead?
1603492	1603712	Yeah.
1604773	1605654	Wouldn't that be kind of cool?
1605674	1608537	So do you have, what, dude on the toilet at the beginning of the game?
1608637	1611860	If Steve Perry was talking to any of the others whatsoever, maybe.
1612620	1617144	Although, well, the guy they have now... The guy they have now, number one, is hot.
1617485	1619006	Number two, has really nice hair.
1619066	1621288	And number three, can sing.
1621468	1622089	Don't get me wrong.
1622149	1623370	He's really good and he can sing.
1623410	1626112	And yes, I have seen Journey live recently when he was the front man.
1626172	1626913	They were really good.
1626953	1627353	We were there.
1627574	1627814	I know.
1628434	1629415	But, I mean...
1630416	1630656	DarkSakura
1659290	1671203	uh wow Mass Effect 2 Mass Effect 3 um the Mass Effect thingy on my phone since I'm trying to get my rating back up um and uh yeah
1672796	1674177	Dan likes to do that.
1674197	1677180	Every so often I'll just get invested and watch.
1693223	1695686	I wouldn't mind doing an episodic playthrough of something, but you know...
1713246	1721954	I like watching other people do it, except it kind of bugs me because, I mean, it is truly what an almost perfect playthrough looks like because they're usually machine-assisted, you know?
1722395	1725658	TigerClaw wants to know if you're going to get the Mass Effect 3 Leviathan DLC.
1725998	1726799	Fuck yes.
1728340	1730743	As if that should surprise anybody whatsoever.
1730983	1732725	I am so excited, you guys.
1733085	1734927	That's why I kind of don't want to beat my game yet.
1735527	1752658	you finally set foot in multiplayer not that long ago yeah once and then I couldn't find anybody else on because no one would let me know when they were playing we need to make that happen again well for me I have to change out my EXE because I have a hacked EXE so I can play in god mode but I saved my original file so that I can switch out for multiplayer
1753440	1754701	Tiger Claw, just wanted to give a plug.
1754721	1757123	There's a lot of classic games played on Twitch TV.
1757163	1759766	There are people doing speed runs on old Mario games.
1759966	1760286	That's cool.
1760306	1762068	I just don't like to watch it live, I guess.
1762648	1763469	Unless it's for charity.
1764249	1764490	Okay.
1764650	1766151	Like Mario Marathon you're down with.
1766191	1766551	Yeah, yeah.
1766932	1767592	That's understandable.
1767993	1769934	And even then I'm like, dude, you're still playing Sunshine.
1770014	1770255	Why?
1771756	1772236	I like Sunshine.
1772256	1772536	Wait a minute.
1772556	1774498	Didn't you say Sunshine was a good game on last week's show?
1774518	1776840	I like Sunshine, but it's kind of boring to watch it.
1777681	1777801	Like,
1779994	1783176	Even as much as I love Mario 64, it's kind of boring to watch it.
1784956	1785476	Understandable.
1785817	1786817	Alright, Loki, how about you?
1786857	1787637	How was your gaming week?
1788178	1791459	This week I played lots of Minecraft, mainly.
1791979	1797882	A little bit of Grand Theft Auto because I was working on mods and stuff.
1800650	1816791	But yeah, going back to Minecraft though, we started a new map that's a tutorial level, which is kind of fun at the start off on that, and then played through a little bit of that, and I actually went back last night to my VOG map and was working a little bit more in peaceful mode too.
1817452	1830489	I was finishing up some minecart stations they make the little bell intro thing when they stop and then it waits like 5 seconds or so and then it makes that noise again and then goes automatically
1830660	1831160	Thanks for watching!
1851992	1876500	landscape I guess and then there's a few that have like the golden apples hidden in there and chests and stuff but it's just I mean that's pretty much it if you restart your levels or start new seeds now there's clay which I never used anyway so it's not a big deal and then you know slimes I guess slime farms are kind of important now that they're sticky pistons and that kind of thing
1877340	1898648	but I don't know I haven't really bothered to find those usually I just try to find some interesting looking landscape and stuff but even now it's just kind of boring going back to that stuff just waiting for the next update the adventure update I think is going to make it a lot more fun but we'll have to see
1899348	1903790	Uh, so anyways, so yeah, Minecraft stuff, and then, uh, I actually played a little bit of new stuff.
1903850	1906671	I played, uh, more Sleeping Dogs again.
1906911	1912713	I, for some reason, my save, like, I had done a bunch of missions, and my save just didn't save or something.
1913093	1916574	I must have forgotten to save, or it didn't auto-save, or whatever.
1917194	1921376	And so I'm having to redo a bunch of missions, so I did that today.
1921576	1925317	And then, uh, one new game I actually picked up, I picked up, um...
1927001	1928182	Scott Pilgrim vs. The World
1956235	1960621	We got to the boss and that was about it, but we didn't get to beat it because we ran out of time.
1960862	1963325	So the stages are a little long for that game.
1963385	1968452	I mean, kind of since it's more like an arcade game, but it's really awesome.
1968632	1970115	I mean, the animation is amazing.
1970135	1971436	I love the way it looks and sounds.
1971476	1973039	It's just a really fantastic game.
1973619	1988173	so um really cool recommend checking it out but kind of disappointed the stages are so long because it does kind of make it hard to play on break um and then beyond that I think that's all I played this week yeah
1988733	1991975	That's the closest you'll get That's still pretty awesome
2016730	2017911	And she's a pretty awesome artist.
2017951	2021293	She does anime drawings and stuff, so expect that.
2021313	2026697	An OLR in joke will finally come to an end, although we all know it's not going to come to an end whatsoever.
2027058	2031481	However, it will finally reach some resolution, yes.
2031501	2034483	Because you don't want to just win.
2034683	2035464	You want to win big.
2036624	2041306	We want Footies Kickstarter to do well.
2041366	2043948	I guess it's really about that.
2044508	2047229	That's really it.
2047249	2054032	They're doing okay, but I'm kind of worried that they may not hit their goal because they're just under $6,000 of $10,000.
2054092	2055093	They've got 11 days left.
2057974	2059735	Sometimes those last few days are the biggest.
2060235	2061015	I think they can do it.
2061075	2062296	I mean, it looks like a pretty cool game.
2062376	2063656	They're not asking for too much.
2063696	2066357	So, I mean, if you want to check it out, it's Evilot.
2066918	2068518	It's E-V-I-L-O-T.
2069218	2072980	And the game looks a little bit similar to Plants vs. Zombies.
2073060	2078482	It's kind of Plants vs. Zombies with... What was that?
2078542	2080223	I'm trying to remember the original name of the game.
2080263	2080603	It was like...
2081363	2085345	Hey, Batman, why... It was a game on PSP.
2085385	2087586	It was like where you play the villain, basically.
2089006	2089767	So it looks cool.
2089787	2091987	I don't know.
2092007	2093168	It should be neat.
2093188	2094629	All right, my gaming week.
2095169	2101091	Kind of like DarkSakura, I played a lot of the same stuff that you're used to hearing me talk about, like World of Warcraft and was continuing to play...
2103212	2103713	Sound Shapes
2127514	2131338	But on Friday night and a little bit today, I got to sink some time into Guild Wars 2.
2132459	2133180	I'm up to about level 10.
2135382	2140567	So I'm not sure I've really had a full amount of time to really flesh out what I think about this game.
2141328	2148716	A lot of the things that were bugging me about it at first, I'm easing up on a little bit, and it all has to do with the Guild Wars 2 model.
2149176	2151298	You know the pricing model is a lot different for Guild Wars 2.
2151958	2158483	You pay the one fee to get the game and then you never have to pay a monthly fee or anything again.
2158723	2159783	So there's no monthly fee.
2160484	2163566	But now they're adding a little more of the free-to-play elements in it.
2163846	2170551	Like you can go into the online shop and buy sunglasses for your character or dumb little things.
2170651	2171652	But there are some...
2172412	2181816	Like basically steroids, performance enhancing things you can get like short time XP bonuses and things like that you can kind of get in the shop with real money.
2183397	2189760	One of the things that started to irritate me is that I got a chest that dropped and the key I needed to open it was something to buy in the store.
2190200	2215792	and I was like oh that's bullshit that's such bullshit that you know I was gonna rage because I'm like that's a Facebook game but then finally I don't know if I got it as a quest reward I think I got it as a quest reward around level 10 I did get one of those keys so you it doesn't bug me nearly as much if you can get it in the game by doing a lot of grinding you know either you're gonna be free to play or you're gonna be uh you know not free to play um I still think Guild Wars 2 despite that
2216601	2217622	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2233652	2261961	Doesn't really feel like World of Warcraft And I think one big reason for that Is they've managed to figure out a new way to do quests There are no yellow exclamation marks over people's heads And it's not like the Final Fantasy XI style questing either Basically what happens is that You have this giant map And I gotta say There's a little thing I love about this game And that is when you go to the map The way the map appears is your camera actually pans down
2262661	2269406	And it does a subtle transition to the actual map, but it makes it look like you're on Google Maps.
2269666	2273328	And it's zooming out to show the map or whatever, and then it zooms back in to show your character.
2273848	2279612	The way it does that transition is one of those little things that really makes you go, that's so cool.
2279972	2283715	And then Shane found out you could draw on the map, like it's a Madden thing.
2283815	2286056	You could draw the plays on the map or whatever.
2286537	2287757	Anyhow, questing.
2288758	2304005	so you go on the map and you'll find these little scouts and the scouts will tell you these things so and so is in trouble and needs help this person is having to deal with this conflict going on right now and could use some help this person is near the cave and da da da so the scouts will tell you where these people are and then they draw the little hearts on your map
2304485	2324692	and you go over to the hearts and then when you're in that general area the game will tell you either kill these things collect these things you know kind of the general MMO stuff but you get to pick what you want to do do you want to kill do you want to collect what do you want to do and as you do those you start to gain it's like mini reputation grinds little mini reputation grinds they don't take you anymore in like 30 minutes
2325172	2336217	Once you do those little grinds, then the heart fills in and that person will start selling you gear and stuff and you've basically completed the quest and you get like gold and XP and the typical things.
2337237	2347001	Now generally in these areas as well, somebody could start an event quest and the event quest is like the public questing which a lot of MMOs besides WoW have in them.
2347982	2372143	and even WoW's getting it to some extent with the scenarios in Pandaria but like Warhammer was a game that did this very well was the whole public questing and I gotta say with the Guild Wars launch going on I mean it was crazy like in the starter area it would be like so-and-so needs help eradicating the mosquitoes from the village because you know it's like a level 2 quest or whatever and then suddenly like a big orange circle appears on your map and all these mosquitoes are everywhere and
2372483	2385034	There's like 75 people everywhere killing mosquitoes and you just watch the bar go and it like fills right up and then you get a medal based on your contribution and the medal gives you experience, gold, and karma points.
2385514	2388016	And karma points you turn around and use to buy gear.
2388536	2394862	So I gotta say, I love that they've really challenged themselves to think outside the box and not make
2395362	2409134	a clone of the successful formula but as MMO fans what do we think MMOs ought to offer and it really does feel like in that regard Guild Wars 2 is taking MMOs to the next level I really think that
2410441	2415766	I think it's giving a lot of... I think, you know, I don't want to turn it into a Guild Wars 2 versus WoW thing.
2416366	2417067	I love WoW.
2417127	2419769	I can't say, oh, Guild Wars 2 is going to kick its ass, whatever.
2420470	2425034	You know, and I totally disagree with people that are like, you know, oh, WoW's dead.
2425574	2426735	Oh, WoW is so dead.
2426775	2430779	The panda people is stupid and it's a little kid and Guild Wars is going to kill it.
2430799	2433421	I've been saying every game's going to kill WoW.
2433441	2434562	WoW will continue to exist.
2434982	2437985	But I got to say, Guild Wars 2 just really brings...
2438525	2454173	Something else to the table with that And one other little thing about Guild Wars 2 that I love They brought Vista points into the game Which I remember from a racing game called Fuel From a couple years ago You remember that game Fuel?
2454413	2460276	You remember how there'd be places on the map you would drive to That it's just a really gorgeous view And you got points for that?
2460596	2465599	And I think Assassin's Creed does something like this too At least somebody was joking with me And I haven't played that series a lot
2466039	2490579	but basically you go to these points on the map and you might have to interact with the environment a little like you'll have to find the little mushrooms you have to jump up to get to the top of the building and then once you get up there there'll be a little book and you press the button and all of a sudden you'll go to a cutscene where the camera will do this gorgeous pan and show you everything around you and then 60 XP for finding the vista point and it's marked on your map and I just I thought that was so awesome like it's something else to do that's not
2491775	2493257	Grinding Dungeon or whatever.
2493357	2495159	So it's just neat.
2495760	2498423	There's a lot about Guild Wars 2 that's just different.
2499064	2506193	It sounds like they could have it like, you know, there's people that kind of challenge themselves to play like a pacifist that you could probably level up...
2507074	2508455	You don't get enough XP.
2508615	2518923	However, yeah, the passive... Because you could go to these areas where they're like... Because to help all the people, you can collect kumquats or whatever and turn them in.
2519003	2521164	Or you can collect things and turn them in, usually.
2521745	2524607	Yeah, I think a pacifist... And you get XP from gathering, too.
2525027	2528449	So I think a pacifist could do very well in Guild Wars 2, to be honest.
2529790	2531712	Although I honestly haven't played the game enough.
2531732	2534494	I haven't played it past level 10, so I can't give you a full, full review.
2534914	2535194	But I...
2536375	2548578	Despite some of my minor bitches about what the traditional free-to-play mechanic is doing to the game, despite my minor bitches there, I really love some of the stuff they are trying to do.
2549078	2551098	A couple other quick things I want to say about Guild Wars 2.
2551138	2553679	We will move on with the show, but this is the new game.
2553719	2556340	A lot of people are going to be talking about this game, trust me.
2558380	2558701	PVP
2581503	2583786	But you get to have your same character.
2584206	2589072	And when you design your character, you get to pick your favorite colors on the garb and all that stuff.
2589473	2595039	So it's like you still have a sense of character, but it's like a completely separate copy of that character in PvP.
2595360	2598383	And if you never want to touch PvP ever ever, you don't have to.
2598444	2599405	It's like a separate little thing.
2600886	2626799	and character designs great because they kind of do a little bit of the Mass Effect thing with it where you pick like did your character in their vision see a snow leopard a stag or a you know and you make those types of decisions that ultimately affect your story like my I think my character saw a white stag and that has been a big part of the story I've been playing so far so they have definitely taken some Bioware it's the people designing this game clearly love the
2627279	2630762	All these different types of video games and have now made the video game they want to be playing.
2630962	2635426	And for the most part, it's like 98% successful from what I've seen so far.
2635586	2638248	I'd play if I had the $60 to afford it.
2638569	2639129	That's the problem.
2639209	2640430	It's dropping the money up front.
2640490	2641311	You know, it's an investment.
2641371	2644654	But... I mean, whereas, you know, I've already got WoW.
2644674	2646035	I'm already in the blood pact.
2646195	2646856	Sure, sure.
2647336	2654718	But that's the other thing I like about Guild Wars, is that once you buy it, you know, if I don't go back to it ever, it'll be there six months now, 12 months from now.
2655878	2656698	That sounds kind of cool.
2656918	2659378	One other thing I'll say about this, the guild system's pretty awesome.
2659959	2662559	Oh, and then I'm going to give you one more negative that ties into this.
2662599	2664079	So the guild system's pretty awesome.
2664599	2671881	Once you form your little guild, every little thing that you do during the day kind of contributes points to the guild's total, and you can use those points to buy perks.
2672401	2681610	So it's kind of like what they were going to do with World of Warcraft's guild leveling system, but they actually did it where the guild master can elect what guild perks you're going to build.
2681650	2687917	Do you want the guild to have an XP bonus or a money bonus or what is it that you want?
2687977	2690639	And you can use the resources to build those, which is pretty cool.
2691220	2693382	Now the place I'm going to knock it a little bit is that...
2694583	2695663	This is actually a big one.
2695683	2697884	I'm glad I thought of this because I got to knock the game for this.
2698624	2700084	It's an issue.
2701245	2703205	They did this whole three-day launch thing, right?
2703585	2706346	So there's a lot of people that aren't really going to be in the game until Tuesday.
2706786	2708447	And some of the servers are already full.
2709187	2713408	And you don't get to pick one server for each character.
2713708	2716589	You pick one server for all of your characters.
2717529	2734387	Now, there's a system in the game where I guess you can have people from other servers, kind of like in a real ID kind of way, they can guest in your game, and you can still kind of party cross-server, and there is a lot you can do cross-server, but the one thing you can't do cross-server is guild.
2735353	2760141	the server I'm on filled up in like a day so if people want to try to get on that server it's full so what if I have friends like Jamie say who haven't bought the game yet and then they're going to try and get on my server it's going to be too bad it's full I kind of think that's bullshit that she can't join my guild because that filled up because all the early people hog the space they need to have a system where she can still get into that server
2761181	2768229	Now, to be fair, I understand that they are doing some type of open transfer for seven days.
2768649	2776657	They're going to allow you to switch worlds however much you want for seven days so that people can kind of settle down and find a home and get off the populated servers and all that stuff.
2777218	2779500	However, they're going to charge for that later on.
2780201	2782484	And I still think it's kind of bullshit.
2783064	2804358	like there needs to be a way if I have a friend on the server remember how Final Fantasy 11 did the world passes I thought that was a good way to do it if the server's populated make it expensive to bring somebody on the server but still make it possible so that part sucks and needs to be rethought a little bit otherwise I'm really cool with Guild Wars 2
2806498	2808999	So I've talked 20 minutes about Guild Wars 2, but it's a big game.
2809399	2809759	So there you go.
2809779	2811440	That's my gaming week, finally.
2812260	2814781	So let's talk about housekeeping.
2815201	2823483	Twitter.com slash OLR, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, and I didn't really clear this with Loki before the show, but I don't think he's going to care.
2823683	2827164	We're not doing a show next week for Labor Day.
2827384	2832305	And it's because, again, DragonCon, PAX, you're all on vacation.
2832705	2833225	You know what?
2833446	2834686	Just enjoy the long weekend.
2834946	2843968	We will try to have something special that does play live on the feed like a Best Of or an oldie moldie classic episode or something for those few of you that will still be there on Sunday night.
2844008	2845909	But you know what?
2845989	2850170	If you have an opportunity to go out and get a rest and vacation a little bit, enjoy it.
2851270	2854833	I guess that would also be, we have to remember, not every country is getting a three-day weekend.
2854853	2858816	That's mostly an America holiday, not really celebrated other places.
2858936	2865842	However, please understand, we do want to take the rare opportunity to go have a three-day weekend and take a road trip if we want, or what have you.
2866702	2869505	I'm toying with the idea of taking a little quick road trip for the weekend.
2869945	2870265	We'll see.
2870786	2871406	I think it would be fun.
2872307	2875129	Of course, sitting on my big butt and playing video games all day long would be great, too.
2875289	2877391	Civ V, Ubermatch, yeah.
2877915	2883318	I just think it's kind of weird that school is starting this week and then there's Labor Day.
2883839	2888361	So like two days of magazine class and then no day of magazine class.
2888541	2889942	School year has been like that for forever.
2891463	2897026	Alright, let's get into some gaming news and talk about what is going on in the gaming world.
2897107	2902730	Unfortunately, I better cue the Debbie Downer horns because it doesn't start off pretty, does it, Loki?
2903140	2904101	Nope, layoffs.
2904381	2905882	It's more and more layoffs.
2906082	2909524	So PopCap, they were hit with layoffs internationally.
2910264	2925913	And at least they kind of... The way they did it, at least they were talking about what happens in the industry and they tried to kind of make it... They didn't kind of hide it from the public, I guess.
2928034	2929175	So basically, they have...
2930916	2932739	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2947376	2954037	I guess they made a statement and I just think it's kind of interesting the way they did it.
2954778	2958878	Basically, you know, 12 years ago we founded PopCap.
2958898	2966440	We never imagined the games we'd make, the vast number of people who'd play those games or the success that followed and so on and so forth.
2967800	2975502	But this morning we informed our employees of a reorganization in our studios that will include a reduction in force in North America operations.
2975942	2976643	Thanks for watching!
2993559	3004622	We're talking to our Dublin team about the future of that office and whether we can find a path to improve our profitability in Europe without having to close the operation.
3004662	3012084	Today's news is something you expect periodically from companies in a fast-changing industry, but it sucks if you're one of those people losing his or her jobs.
3012164	3014725	These people are our friends and we don't like doing this.
3014985	3017106	So at least they're being very personable about it.
3019407	3020807	I think that's the way you do it right there.
3021599	3027684	However, I think the other pink elephant in the room, and allow me to echo the- Pink elephant?
3027864	3029806	Yeah, you know, pink elephant that stands out?
3030346	3032688	Isn't that when you just drink a lot, you see pink elephants?
3033189	3036872	No, I've always heard the pink elephant in the room is the obvious thing or whatever.
3036972	3038033	Anyway, you're derailing me.
3038653	3045159	The pink elephant in the room in this, and allow me to echo the rest of the internet in this, is I don't understand-
3047353	3048254	why PopCap?
3049676	3050537	why did this happen?
3051859	3053381	is PopCap struggling?
3054302	3065496	I thought out of all the gaming companies out there PopCap was doing a lot of things right and granted your whole memo and everything you're talking about there is an example of some of the things they do right
3066593	3070898	A lot of us had a great fear when EA bought them, something like this would happen.
3071078	3074321	Here they go into why.
3075082	3080708	And basically a little context on why we're making cuts in some areas and why we're investing and expanding in others.
3080868	3085132	In past years, we've seen a dramatic change in the way people play and pay for games.
3085532	3088856	Free-to-play social mobile games have exploded in popularity.
3088936	3089757	That happened fast.
3090117	3101615	surprisingly so the change in consumer taste requires us to reorganize our business and invest in new types of games on new platforms it's a completely different world from where we started that's why
3105247	3125568	I still does not make sense still does not make sense and granted PopCap wasn't putting out a lot of games maybe unfortunately there was just too much that was in development that was costing them too much money like too much in development not enough out on the table but still like how fucking huge was Plants vs. Zombies bejeweled bejeweled
3126266	3129227	But Jeweled like changed the industry in some ways.
3129767	3132389	But Jeweled was like one of the first Facebook games.
3132889	3133249	Peggle.
3133469	3134049	Period.
3134229	3134529	Peggle.
3134910	3136630	Everybody knows what kind of crack Peggle is.
3137391	3138431	I don't understand.
3139011	3143013	I get it when game companies, you know, as much as this pained me.
3143533	3172822	when Bizarre Creations closed I understood that Blur was not very well received and that the Geometry Wars games were kind of losing steam and all that and that they weren't doing the PGR games anymore I kind of saw the economics in that I don't get it here despite everything that they're saying there I can't help as a fan and somebody who thought this company was doing very well before EA bought them I can't help but think despite what they're saying despite all this something's up
3173402	3184250	Well, maybe because they are bought by EA and owned by EA that the investors thought, hey, there's too much overhead on this company and so we need to cut back in order to make it more profitable.
3184290	3186492	So EA just jacked all the franchise.
3186532	3192836	The EA just snatched Bejeweled, snatched Plants vs. Zombies, and then that's it.
3193757	3195859	Of course, they're saying, though, that that's not the case.
3195939	3198781	They said if we didn't have EA behind us, the cuts would have been worse.
3199761	3201783	So I don't know.
3203365	3205987	I wouldn't really know what to do until I saw a financial report.
3207268	3207628	Honestly.
3208728	3209609	It's just weird.
3210710	3217853	Maybe because everything is free-to-play, like for example, Bejeweled Blitz and stuff like that on Facebook, that no one's actually buying the games anymore.
3218634	3219334	Maybe that's why.
3220655	3225778	You think there's not enough people buying those power-ups and the things that substantiate the free-to-play model?
3227947	3228488	Maybe not.
3228608	3229028	I don't know.
3229308	3240179	Maybe because of PopCap's style of they've always been pretty good about not shoving that shit down your throat like Zynga games do that maybe, unfortunately, being nice isn't profitable.
3241865	3243467	I don't think that it was a lack of that.
3243507	3246629	I thought that they had very innovative ways of getting the games out there.
3247350	3254915	I've got a special version of Peggle that teamed with Valve that came out.
3256997	3262701	It was like a special Peggle that had Portal stuff in there and Team Fortress and everything, and it was free.
3263182	3267285	But it was a good, it's like, if you liked this, here's the full game, here's the whole thing.
3268546	3282106	The Plants vs. Zombies stuff in WoW The Peggle add-on Which I played a lot of the Peggle add-on And really wish it was still available I mean, they really did look into Getting it out there in different ways And I think that
3284152	3288294	If they had been able to keep that up, then maybe this wouldn't happen, but I'm not sure.
3288594	3291536	I mean, I really don't know what to say until I see a financial report.
3291996	3299220	TigerClaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Could it be that people are finally getting tired of playing casual games?
3300872	3301193	Nah.
3301913	3303655	I don't, yeah, I, no.
3304536	3305056	Here's the thing.
3305296	3309060	If you mean casual games to mean Facebook games, maybe.
3310321	3318769	I think what's gonna happen to Facebook games is what happened in the video game crash of 84, which is there's just so much shit
3319389	3320590	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3347026	3352850	If there's somebody that really gave the public what they wanted, it could all come tumbling down for Facebook pretty soon.
3352970	3355671	I'm on a social networking thing that doesn't have the stupid games on it.
3356612	3358233	Well, I always liked the way Google Plus did it.
3358273	3360274	It was just another tab somewhere else.
3360294	3366618	I mean, to be perfectly honest, I'm actually thinking about going back to using Google Plus because of just how ridiculous Facebook has gotten.
3367498	3368479	But I don't play the games.
3368539	3371381	There's a lot of people that are worried about system security.
3371561	3375383	So they, like I have done, have blocked every single game request that's come through.
3375543	3377924	Well, this is the thing that pisses me off about Facebook.
3378004	3379424	Literally pisses me off.
3379624	3385086	I don't know how many times I have turned off location statuses on my post.
3385226	3388787	I don't want all my posts posting where my location is.
3389347	3394209	I use an app called Foursquare when I specifically want to disclose that.
3395249	3396350	I hate being tagged.
3396550	3396790	I don't...
3397230	3399432	Check into my house and all that stuff.
3399552	3400353	I don't do that.
3400794	3406959	So I don't want my post to be tagged with my work address or my home or whatever it is.
3407360	3410062	Yet that shit keeps turning itself back on.
3410183	3413306	I just had to do it on a Facebook post I made an hour before the show.
3413846	3414587	Thanks for watching!
3429309	3430450	Okay, I like this picture.
3430470	3431852	It's like, I don't care if you like that picture.
3431892	3433013	Or I'm commenting on someone.
3433073	3433974	And it pops back up a second later?
3433994	3434815	And it keeps popping back.
3434895	3436256	No, it keeps popping back up.
3436276	3436857	You click it.
3437438	3438759	I want to unsubscribe from it.
3438879	3440241	And it will hide that post.
3440781	3441762	But it will still be there.
3441802	3443104	And it will still keep coming back.
3443244	3444505	And there's no way to get rid of it.
3444525	3445026	I have to stop.
3445586	3452033	For people that keep having that stuff pop up, and I'm just tired of seeing their posts, I actually have to unsubscribe from them.
3452053	3452173	Why?
3452193	3454075	Why do we keep using Facebook?
3454455	3458319	I'm sitting here bitching yet I'll still use it to make some stupid post this evening.
3458460	3458720	Why?
3458760	3461002	Because I need instant gratification.
3461623	3462504	It's not even that.
3463024	3463925	Why do we need that?
3464086	3465827	Why do we need that right now in our society?
3466528	3467109	Why do we need it?
3467469	3471631	The only reason that I stick, I keep up with Facebook is just to piss off my mother.
3472471	3475613	Well, to keep up with my friends and family in Alabama.
3476353	3480535	To keep up with, you know, my friends in other countries.
3480555	3482656	To keep up with my friends across America.
3482696	3487979	I mean, because only like three people anymore still use AIM, which I still use to keep up with people.
3488619	3495083	You know, I've found old friends that I used to chat with back when I had AOL for real, you know, back in the day.
3495143	3499546	One of my friends just found me through DeviantArt, and we're on Facebook now.
3499907	3511254	So, I mean, I use it to keep up with people, but other than that, I mean, like, I get so irritated that people just use it for a sympathy grab, you know what I mean?
3511634	3514056	Or, hi, look where I am and you're not.
3514396	3515597	I don't care where you are.
3516117	3517418	I don't need to know when you go to bed.
3518839	3531502	I think it's just this whole... I think it really is a modern phenomenon that everyone wants a little bit of... I hate to use it in this respect, but everyone wants their own little piece of celebrity, you know what I mean?
3532203	3534183	Where they want people to care about what they're doing.
3534203	3536584	It's that whole Andy Warhol thing, the 15 minutes of fame.
3536624	3537944	It's all of that coming to light.
3538304	3540405	Andy Warhol predicted things better than the Mayans.
3542236	3545784	Well, he was a fairly interesting person.
3545844	3546445	Yes, he was.
3546546	3547768	He was an OCD collector.
3547909	3548911	Yeah, yeah.
3548951	3550775	Anyway, my teacher got to meet him.
3550815	3552378	Why did he do a painting of soup cans?
3553594	3554554	One of my teachers got to meet him.
3554675	3554915	Oh yeah?
3555095	3556375	Yeah, back then.
3556655	3558636	Anyhow, how did we get from PopCap to this?
3558776	3559096	I don't know.
3559116	3560236	You're the one who changed it to Andy Warhol.
3560256	3562717	Well, I find this, I do find this topic fascinating.
3562937	3564338	Let me read some chat comments real quick.
3564798	3567079	Those participating with the show at live.vognetwork.com.
3567599	3574101	Locopoco says, I use it, talking about Facebook, because all my family and friends use it and that's all I can use to keep up with them.
3575041	3575483	Why?
3575903	3579612	And I'm not saying that at you because I bet everybody would answer the question the same way.
3579672	3581115	And I'm even asking myself this.
3581476	3583020	Why not just pick up the phone and call somebody?
3584803	3612809	I call my mother text message then I'm okay with that I have nothing to talk to them about that's why I post like things on there not like hey I did this today it's like hey look at this cool movie trailer exactly frisbee in our chat room why does Facebook have to be the only way to keep in touch with people and lately all I do it now is just for you know reblogging political shit and you know it helps me with the kitten you know
3615563	3618004	He gotta love DJ Morpheus from Understation Live.
3618345	3619726	Just made a Facebook post.
3619766	3621887	I was told to reload Facebook, so that's why I did it.
3622007	3623868	No, I hate being tagged in a location.
3623888	3624708	Where you were tagged.
3624929	3626850	Jamie hates to be tagged, so I'm tagging.
3626930	3628851	I don't mind being tagged in a picture.
3628891	3630132	I hate location tags.
3630952	3633334	Actually, I don't like being tagged in pictures sometimes.
3634035	3638118	Not necessarily pictures, but the ones that are like, here's a calendar of all these birthdays.
3638178	3639579	I'm going to tag everybody.
3639919	3642841	For the record, I can't hide that, Travis, just saying.
3643382	3652229	I hate the picture tagging too, but at the same time, earlier today, Clover Nikon, one of our listeners, made this awesome 3D VOG art rendering.
3652269	3655471	He tagged me in that, and I was okay with that.
3655571	3657353	At least that's relevant to my interest.
3657693	3660355	I may not be in that picture, but it's a VOG picture, and I want to see it.
3661536	3664098	I don't give a crap about that.
3664158	3665358	I hate location posts.
3666019	3668661	I am going to make a resolution.
3670342	3673745	We've been talking a lot about Labor Day and what we want to do over the Labor Day weekend.
3674305	3680189	And I am going to resolve to not touch social networking Labor Day weekend.
3680329	3682291	No Facebook, no Google+, no Twitter.
3683167	3684348	You know where I live these days?
3684909	3685249	Tumblr.
3686190	3686871	None of that either.
3687071	3687692	None of that for me.
3687712	3688212	Well, have fun.
3688252	3689313	I'm going to be on Tumblr.
3690514	3691255	Why won't you do it?
3691715	3692636	Because I love Tumblr.
3692796	3693657	I can give up Facebook.
3693677	3694278	I don't give a crap.
3694298	3699002	But I love Tumblr because I actually get news articles on Tumblr.
3699102	3702946	I use Tumblr as my blog for my fitness thing.
3702986	3706829	And actually, if anyone wants to follow my fitness blog, it's called Dieting Can Bite Me.
3707570	3708070	All one word.
3709131	3709532	at Tumblr.
3710233	3714157	But I mean, I use that for, I use it for art blogging.
3714758	3718422	I actually use that for real blogging stuff and for getting my thoughts out there.
3718442	3721205	It's sort of my live journal replacement for right now.
3721883	3729768	AlanAlchemy in our chatroom says, Well, the issue with Facebook is that it managed to get everyone's 55-year-old aunts and shit on it, which really is unprecedented.
3729828	3733970	And that audience does not give a shit about moving on to the next great thing like the rest of it.
3735031	3736171	It's kind of a good point.
3736832	3738813	That's one reason why Facebook took off is that it got...
3739113	3739954	Everybody on it.
3740114	3743696	And now it's ads, ads, ads, ads.
3744777	3745798	Alan, Alchemy continues.
3745878	3752742	So the problem is that if you're in the same situation of keeping track of your family, re-Facebook, there is no reason to ever believe they'll move on to something else.
3753022	3757645	So even if you move on to the next thing, you'll have to keep your Facebook, so it's always going to be a little bit relevant.
3757866	3759367	Then let's move off.
3759987	3760848	Let's go back to LiveJournal.
3761388	3764230	Here's some selected likes that they want me to like.
3764330	3768373	Wreck-It Ralph, Cuddling, Five Finger Death Punch, and Act of Valor.
3769554	3769734	What?
3769894	3772256	All that liking stuff is is marketing stuff.
3772316	3772737	Exactly.
3773137	3777401	I've had to go back and unlike things because I realize it's ironic.
3777461	3793156	We tell you to go like Orange Lounge Radio and VOG Network, but guys, that's the double-edged sword about Facebook is that it's still a great way to promote my shit when I don't have the million dollars to spend on magazine ads and TV ads and the other stuff the big boys get to do.
3793656	3795558	So, yes, I do realize it's ironic.
3795598	3804685	Here I am bitching about Facebook, yet I say go like Orange Launch Radio on Facebook because it still is a good way to remind you guys the show is here and to listen and all that stuff.
3806206	3808028	Well, I'm going to stick to it.
3808168	3811771	I'm going to make my actions match my words.
3811891	3815594	I am stepping off Facebook for one weekend.
3815654	3816735	It's not even that big of a deal.
3816935	3817575	One weekend.
3818576	3820057	Is anybody out there going to try it too?
3820278	3821098	Is it just going to be me?
3821799	3823000	Are you really all that attached?
3825959	3826779	I guess we'll find out
3848067	3848907	in Sacramento.
3848947	3850008	Well, that's fine.
3850028	3851549	I just don't like it when he gives my address.
3851669	3852549	Alright, moving on.
3853770	3854870	More bad news.
3856091	3858912	Sometimes I don't want people to know when I'm having lunch at Wiener Works.
3863974	3865095	Only when I'm having dessert.
3866555	3868036	That's why I got rid of Foursquare.
3868076	3869297	I really don't give a shit anymore.
3870310	3891597	I don't care if people know where I am I don't necessarily want people to know where I am and I don't care where you are I swear this is the last thing on social networking the reason why I like Foursquare is I actually like the search function to see what restaurants my friends have been to and if they left tips if they enjoyed it or not I have found it to be way more useful than Yelp in that regard I usually just ask people
3892297	3893258	Yelp Reviews
3914601	3916362	Oh, Tex Wasabi's.
3916402	3919764	That's that one guy from Food Network's restaurant.
3919804	3920344	Guy Fieri.
3920444	3920924	Yeah, thank you.
3921184	3922885	That guy with the horrible hair.
3923025	3923826	It's his restaurant.
3923846	3924466	I've never been there.
3924526	3926487	And I loved it, actually.
3926587	3926987	I went there.
3927007	3928708	I thought it was really... I fucking loved it.
3928728	3930489	I heard it was really expensive.
3931189	3932010	It's a little bit pricey.
3932050	3933750	It's not like Ruth Chris expensive.
3933810	3936391	It's like Red Lobster prices.
3937212	3938392	That's not so bad.
3938692	3940693	It's sushi and barbecue.
3942854	3944475	You think it's the weirdest thing in the world?
3944535	3946556	I shit you not, it's fucking amazing.
3946576	3952198	I want to go to Johnny Garlic's, but there's none around here, I don't think.
3952298	3953039	No, there's one in Roseville.
3953059	3953939	What are you talking about?
3954359	3955680	It's not around here.
3955900	3956180	All right.
3958021	3958681	Let's move on.
3960403	3961343	This is more bad news.
3963545	3964365	This just sucks.
3964625	3965886	I don't know what else to say about this.
3966326	3968208	Sony Liverpool has been closed.
3968908	3971550	You know them because they brought you Wipeout 2048.
3972210	3976033	If you're like me, you remember this studio when they were called Psygnosis.
3976886	3977826	You remember Psygnosis?
3978127	3978527	Lemmings.
3978647	3979087	Lemmings.
3980027	3986831	I mean, that game was like PC gaming's golden child for years and years.
3987191	3988611	They became Sony Liverpool.
3988892	3991833	Shadow of the Beast was another game they made, and of course the Wipeout games.
3993153	3993794	What happened?
3995274	3998136	I guess Wipeout on the Vita didn't live up to expectations.
3998216	3999456	I don't think that's Wipeout's fault.
3999977	4002658	That was probably one of the better games to get on the Vita.
4004758	4014408	This is another one I'm looking at going, is it just because Wipeout isn't making waves the way that LittleBigPlanet is?
4014428	4015289	I mean, I don't know.
4015690	4018332	But I mean, Psygnosis has put out some good shit over the years.
4019293	4019974	It's just weird.
4023157	4024038	What else can I say?
4025031	4025671	That sucks!
4025971	4035216	A little known fact about Psygnosis, they received top billing for creating the face-off games featured in Nickelodeon's 1992 television show, Nick Arcade.
4035736	4038238	That's right, they created the face-off games in Nick Arcade.
4038298	4039178	Get the fuck out.
4039218	4039778	That was them?
4040199	4043200	Yeah, Post Haste, Jet Jocks, and Battle of the Bands.
4048423	4054746	The 12-year-old boy in me who is playing Lemmings on his 486 PC is having a cry right now.
4057603	4078145	I don't get it poor Rob poor me poor all of us we all lose with this news this week the only thing we can hope these guys form new stuff you know see this would have been another game that would have been good from them that they could have remade and it would have been really sweet Colony Wars was another game that they worked on when they were at Sony
4079082	4080823	I swear all this is just putting me in a bad mood.
4081403	4081864	I'm sorry.
4082664	4086646	Well, I hope they can rise up and start something new.
4086707	4089528	I mean, I remember PopCap had that iOS studio.
4089548	4091029	No one's gonna do anything new.
4092250	4093971	There's no money in anything new.
4094491	4098733	People want the same recycled crap and companies don't like to take risks.
4099054	4099654	End of story.
4099774	4108219	Do you find it a bit ironic that one of the launch games for this whole Sony mobile thing or whatever their platform is Lemmings?
4110120	4111681	That's just salt in the wound right there.
4112102	4115725	But I mean, well, but that's just because what's new hasn't been thought of yet.
4116386	4118147	Facebook at one time didn't exist.
4118267	4118788	It was new.
4118968	4121770	But it was still based off of a pre-existing concept.
4122551	4124112	Social networking is not new.
4124352	4128156	Well, video games aren't new, but there's still lots of ideas that haven't been discovered yet.
4128176	4129957	You know, we had pen pals back in the day.
4131158	4133801	This is updated pen palling, pretty much.
4134601	4134862	You know...
4135582	4141945	It's, concepts can evolve, but I really don't think that there's much new to be had anymore.
4142586	4144667	Everyone copies everybody these days.
4144927	4149189	I think that's, with all due respect, I think that's just a jaded perspective on where our industry's at.
4149229	4151130	We feel that way because that's all we're getting.
4151450	4152531	We're getting sequels.
4152591	4154312	We're getting all this same old shit.
4154352	4156553	The people that are doing new things are being ignored.
4157713	4159714	And I agree, that sucks.
4160194	4161874	We need to pay attention to the good ideas.
4161894	4166035	I mean, that's why, and I've told a couple people this, I'm actually going to be writing a book and I'm going to self-publish.
4167696	4175738	Because you notice that all the books, and I hate to use these as examples because they really are just awful fan fiction, but like that Fifty Shades of Shit.
4176878	4180239	There's some pretty bad writing that gets published and people eat it up.
4180499	4183200	But the thing is, is that that's someone who...
4184380	4194143	Some of these other books that came out that have been rejected by major publishers, they've self-published and have since turned into pretty big money-making schemes.
4194543	4200965	There's a girl that writes episodic vampire stories on Facebook for 99 cents a copy, and she's a millionaire now.
4201585	4206186	I mean, a million bucks isn't that much anymore, relatively, as it used to be.
4206747	4207727	I wouldn't mind having that.
4208007	4220316	But a college student, you know, putting up her own little stories on Amazon Selling them, you know, at, I think she'd get like a 10% profit off of it Or some really small margin of profit Yeah, but what's the trick?
4220356	4221537	How do you make people pay for it?
4221577	4227181	Because if we charge 99 cents an episode of Orange Lounge Radio Let's not kid ourselves
4228222	4233026	The thing that I'm saying is that I think that's why the Kickstarter thing is actually really taking off.
4234087	4237089	It has to do back with that self-publishing, self-actualizing.
4237449	4243775	They're going to the people instead of using some formula that companies think works.
4244755	4247998	They're putting, say, hey, show me you're interested with your money.
4248959	4252502	Except 5% of it won't actually go to the idea at all.
4252742	4254063	But the Kickstarter idea is new.
4255343	4256084	Relatively new.
4256744	4260306	And they've made a business off of it, so that's something there.
4261267	4273213	It's basically, I think, a lot of people taking their own ideas into their own hands, not letting someone else corrupt their idea, and seeing how far they can make it go based on the will of the people.
4276073	4276514	Fuck this game.
4276754	4277215	Fuck this game.
4287358	4290659	Final Fantasy XIV is being pulled off the shelves.
4291219	4292879	Aw, no more Final Fantasy XIV.
4293459	4296080	Squeenix said, take it off your shelves.
4296120	4296520	You know why?
4297100	4300141	Because they don't want it to get in the way of a Realm Reborn.
4302802	4315945	They're basically saying that those who are registering their copy of Final Fantasy XIV will have full access to a 30-day free trial period prior to the servers shutting down in preparation for the alpha and beta tests of a Realm Reborn.
4316565	4331453	so they're wanting to just to not have those old copies go out there anymore they want people to to focus on the new what happens if they don't like use those free like if like I bought the game and I knew that they're gonna shut the servers down and
4331789	4333411	The servers aren't shutting down.
4333751	4335673	Don't be confused.
4335693	4336854	They're just pulling it off shelves.
4337334	4338635	They're shutting down the servers.
4339676	4339916	What?
4340857	4341658	I had not heard that.
4342859	4344801	Exactly what I read off here from their thing.
4345301	4349345	Prior to the servers shutting down to prepare for the alpha and beta tests.
4350226	4351127	Oh, shit.
4352008	4353589	So, like, why would I want to, you know,
4354833	4355253	Wow.
4355654	4359698	If I had 30 days, wouldn't I want to save that for when it starts?
4359758	4361740	When I originally saw this, that update wasn't there.
4361860	4362340	That's why.
4363241	4363582	Wow.
4364974	4373501	In anticipation of the upcoming Alpha and Beta test for Final Fantasy XIV or Realm Reborn, Square Enix, in coordination with our retail partners, has decided to discontinue sales of the current version of Final Fantasy XIV.
4389153	4389313	Wow.
4405191	4405812	That's real.
4406112	4409895	See, in my mind, I was like, oh, they'll do kind of like what World of Warcraft does.
4409915	4412657	You have your test servers that run one copy of the game.
4413277	4425227	That's archaic and dumb, but I mean, not that anybody's really gonna... There'll be hundreds of people that weep over Final Fantasy XIV servers being shut down, but I mean... When it vanishes, though, it is a clean break from the old.
4425734	4429335	Yeah, that's unprecedented.
4430336	4434317	I think it's going to kick him in the ass.
4434417	4446161	Square is literally trying to erase your memory of that game so that when Realm Reborn comes out, it's treated like a brand new game, a brand new launch, like the old one didn't ever happen.
4446881	4450282	That's crazy.
4451742	4453563	I think that it's going to come back to kick him, though.
4455003	4457451	I think it's going to come back and I think it's really going to hurt him.
4460953	4461434	You know what?
4461554	4462414	I'm going to give it this.
4463175	4466197	Final Fantasy XIV sucked.
4466257	4468178	I tried it two or three times.
4468359	4469700	I really tried to like it.
4470100	4471401	It was not a good MMO.
4472381	4474683	Harry Monkey Balls is what sucked.
4475103	4485271	Having played WoW, having played Guild Wars, having played Knights of the Old Republic, having played just about everything that's come to the table, Final Fantasy XIV sucked.
4486992	4487133	I just...
4493714	4497257	And Eleven made me cry with frustration and everything I saw made me like it better.
4497798	4503523	Oh, but I don't think it's necessarily going to... I applaud them for taking risks.
4504604	4506886	I don't know if it will necessarily be a failure.
4507426	4515994	But I think if you're hedging your bets on sales of the console version of the game, that's dangerous because console MMOs haven't been super, super well done.
4516154	4518976	So... With the exception of Final Fantasy XI.
4519016	4519076	So...
4520597	4525740	I hope they also consider the relaunch on the PC as well.
4525840	4528081	Fascinating.
4528401	4532143	It's like the more crap they do with this, the less I'm interested in it.
4532243	4532883	It's not worth it.
4532923	4534064	There's bigger and better out there.
4534084	4536205	Alright, let's move on with some more news.
4538837	4554162	EA is hoping to avoid a whole... It's kind of funny that they're actually acknowledging it now, but they're trying to put a lot of resources in preventing another FIFA hack going on with FIFA 13.
4554622	4558243	Basically, they made a lot of money off the Ultimate Team DLC.
4559103	4560044	Thank you for watching!
4575974	4577794	They said we've learned a lot from the experience.
4577834	4580135	A lot of companies are suffering from this right now.
4580215	4583957	There's a lot of sophisticated hacking happening in the gaming industry.
4584837	4587379	It's a continuous battle.
4587719	4591861	We take it very seriously and we put a lot of resources on it.
4592061	4596323	We're learning from the FIFA example last year and it's been incorporated into this year.
4596443	4598323	There's some incremental and additional things.
4598383	4602285	I don't want to get too detailed because I don't want to tip our hand.
4602465	4604066	Rest assured we'll take it very seriously.
4605615	4613380	I'm sorry, I still don't see how that's going to happen considering that you're selling the same stuff on Madden now and you're still doing the FIFA thing.
4613981	4625288	So as long as you keep making it profitable for people to steal those accounts and actually be able to sell stuff for real money, then people are going to keep hacking those accounts to try to make money off of them.
4625628	4634995	You know, this whole thing gets a nice hearty kiss my ass from EA because, I mean, granted, okay, it's nice that you're like acknowledging something's going on now.
4636215	4645862	Now that you're trying to sell the new copy of your game, screw you for not having said that this was a problem before.
4646002	4653246	Now you're just casually saying, oh yes, we've learned from the past, but the new one's going to be bigger and better.
4654047	4655027	You are using...
4655968	4660711	People who had their money stolen as an excuse to plug your new game.
4660791	4662211	That's what it feels like to me, honestly.
4662311	4664473	As somebody who was FIFA hacked for all this.
4664493	4668655	So did they learn by adding... Some people frown on the use of the term hacking.
4668815	4671977	Whatever the fuck it was, money was stolen and...
4672897	4676878	Social engineering is still a form of hacking, I guess.
4677558	4681299	So they're going to add more stuff to their marketplace so that there's more things for people to buy?
4681319	4682980	Is that what they've learned?
4683420	4688261	Hey, we've learned that we can get a lot of money from people getting their accounts stolen.
4688641	4691502	So we're just going to add more things that they can buy.
4691562	4692682	Maybe some stuff for $500 instead.
4692702	4693022	I don't know.
4696264	4697885	How about you don't sell stuff for real money?
4714847	4722411	Well, the reality is where we're at in this industry now, I just don't think that's possible anymore.
4722591	4723851	We're past that point.
4723872	4728154	I think it's stupid, though, that they have a $60 game that they're doing all these microtransactions on.
4729054	4734797	Well, I think it's ridiculous, too, but unfortunately people are buying them, so it's working.
4735643	4739245	We need to hunt these people out and off them.
4739485	4739805	You know what?
4740405	4742246	We shouldn't tell people what to spend their money on.
4742286	4745408	If people legitimately are doing this.
4745468	4750830	The other problem I have is that probably 80% of that was all from stolen money.
4751550	4755452	But, I mean, besides that, people can spend their money however they want.
4755992	4763676	If they want to buy $60 for the game and then pay all this money for the expansions, let them spend their money on it if that's what makes them happy.
4765120	4765941	Vote with your wallet.
4767902	4769264	If you don't like it, don't buy it.
4769304	4772506	But the problem is, my wallet was stolen and then used to vote.
4772787	4773507	That's a problem.
4774628	4775569	That's voter fraud.
4776149	4777290	Oh, it's not our problem.
4777551	4778431	It's not our issue.
4780073	4783616	A year later, oh, we've taken steps to try and make sure that won't happen again.
4783636	4785297	But it was never our issue in the first place.
4788360	4792363	Why would you need to take steps if there was not an issue with your, if it was all Microsoft?
4792403	4793364	So I'd love to know.
4796311	4809712	Moving on Boy, DarkSakura, you're right The news tonight just makes us There's so much to get angry about this week Let's close the show and go get Pinkberry I thought you were having a healthy day It's yogurt
4811880	4816562	Trust me, you'd want to get that delicious new chocolate hazelnut, which isn't the best yogurt for you.
4816642	4820864	Anyway, Ubisoft made an interesting statement this week.
4820945	4831770	The CEO of Ubisoft, and I can't even say this name, Yves Guillemot, Guillemot, Guillemot, Guillemot, Guillemot, Guillemot, Guillemot, isn't the T usually silent?
4833191	4840881	came out and said that PC retail games have a gigantic rate of piracy.
4841441	4844645	And this was talking to games industry at Gamescom.
4845566	4851454	He said that only about 5% to 7% of freemium players buy content because...
4852094	4858098	Like the retail PC product, they have a, quote, 93 to 95% piracy rate.
4858438	4862080	So he's basically saying retail PC games, 93 to 95% piracy rate.
4862580	4870465	Some other comments, quote, we also take content which we've developed in the past, graphics, et cetera, and we can make cheaper games and improve them over time.
4870885	4871886	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4894921	4918686	I think if you're looking at just the US and Britain and Japan and the rest of the UK where Ubisoft or wherever in the world they have a presence where they sell games maybe that number seems high but I mean piracy is fucking rampant in other parts of the world I'm sure there's copies of these games easily available in the most populous country in the world China
4920546	4930485	I'm sure there's tons of free copies of these games roaming around in China so when you throw in the worldwide perspective into the mix I could actually believe the 93-95% piracy rate
4934727	4937588	But some people are still successful off that model.
4937969	4938229	Yeah.
4939009	4940210	I'm not excusing it.
4940390	4941691	I'm not saying it's okay.
4942231	4942991	I'm just saying.
4943091	4944312	And numbers can lie.
4944452	4945753	You have to manipulate them.
4945973	4949815	It's not like piracy is anything new or like it's never happened before.
4950975	4952736	We've never had successful PC games.
4952956	4955918	But before I believe any of those numbers, I'd have to see where the polls are.
4956238	4958559	I mean, where it really is.
4958699	4963622	I wouldn't trust anything, numbers based on markets that wasn't made for.
4964110	4966692	You're having a very I want to see the receipts kind of night.
4966853	4967153	I am.
4967173	4968514	Well, you know I'm like that anyway.
4970236	4971156	I'm like that anyway.
4971837	4972998	Loki, what do you think of that number?
4973018	4974960	93 to 95% piracy rate.
4975981	4976762	Seems a little high.
4976782	4978223	I don't know.
4979364	4980045	I just don't buy it.
4980565	4985790	Frisbee in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says 85% of statistics are made up on the spot.
4986488	4988049	Especially in this industry, brother.
4988269	4988589	All right.
4989470	5000657	One other note about Ubisoft, which is interesting because Ubisoft previously came out and said the game I Am Alive was never going to come out on the PC, basically because there was no other version.
5001278	5011945	Well, creative director Stanislaw Metra came out and said about I Am Alive, quote, we've heard loud and clear that PC gamers are bitching about there being no version for them.
5015217	5015557	Wow.
5016578	5022142	But are these people just making noise because there's no version or because it's a game they actually want to play?
5022482	5023843	Would they buy it if we made it?
5024263	5031348	It's hard because there's so much piracy and so few people are paying for PC games that we have to precisely weigh it up against the cost of making it.
5031708	5035230	Perhaps it will only take 12 guys three months to port the game to PC.
5035590	5037892	It's not a massive cost, but it's still a cost.
5038292	5041414	If only 50,000 people buy the game, then it's not worth it.
5043035	5043215	Only 50,000?
5044811	5049773	Well, I have to say, to his credit, he does make a point.
5050773	5060257	If it takes 12 guys three months to port the game, then using fractions, that would also be three guys 12 months or three annual salaries.
5060757	5063579	And let's say these guys make, I don't know, 75K a year.
5063999	5067500	So to just pay those three guys is going to cost $225,000.
5069961	5074843	and that's not even counting the cost to print the game, to market the game, to sell, you know, and all that stuff.
5075023	5077364	Make it all download content so you don't have to pay for materials.
5079685	5079985	I don't know.
5082086	5084527	But there's some people that would be like, oh, but I don't want to pay.
5084547	5085027	Viral marketing.
5085087	5089369	I don't want to do, I don't download games because I have to have the tangible copy.
5089789	5090409	Then they lose out.
5090549	5093850	But you're, wait a minute, you're a collector in all this shit.
5093930	5096311	Why, you, I, hold on.
5096752	5097872	I collect old shit, Rob.
5097892	5098012	What?
5099761	5101262	I collect old things.
5114975	5135438	and I would have done the download copy if it had been the same so let's make believe I use Steam Rob let's make believe la la la that the next Xbox and the next Playstation and just pulling shit out of my ass the Wii U all go digital only digital download only that's not a problem
5136027	5136447	Not really.
5137188	5141110	Honestly, I'm going to say this is going into a little bit of my home stuff.
5141611	5142671	We're thinking about downsizing.
5144152	5150956	We have shelves that are taken up with DVDs and with our current game collection.
5151557	5153618	We have buckets of the old stuff.
5154138	5155139	The old stuff, that's fine.
5155639	5156440	But anything new...
5157941	5160804	I really wouldn't mind having it as a digital copy.
5161165	5164668	I mean, as long as I've got the software, the hardware to play it on, then I wouldn't mind.
5165549	5172837	You know, it's less waste, less, it's green, Rob, it's green.
5174139	5174519	It's green.
5175900	5176381	You hippie.
5176741	5177082	Alright.
5178323	5179985	One more news story and then the release dates.
5180928	5186269	So how about some persona?
5187089	5191550	There is going to be Persona 4, the solid gold premium edition.
5192270	5205113	And it's going to be only 10,000 copies produced, but it will have a Hori hardcover pouch, a face cover, stickers, and Vita skins, along with eight matching wallpapers.
5205233	5205713	And it's going to be $70.
5205753	5205893	Okay.
5207553	5212896	and the first run copies, just to let people know, had just the skins and wallpapers and it was $40.
5215678	5219941	So for people who are Persona fans, also just to let you know, only in Japan.
5220261	5221262	Of which there are a few.
5221282	5222062	That won't stop.
5222082	5224083	That won't stop many people, I know.
5224103	5224804	Like the Premium Edition?
5224924	5225364	Well, no.
5225964	5230727	The bonus stuff that came out with the Solid Gold Edition are the same ones that came out in Japan.
5230867	5231067	Yeah.

5234786	5237028	No Europe is intended.
5237328	5243412	Alpha Cananigram in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says they are sold out on Amazon for this Persona 4, the golden kit.
5244072	5246294	Well, yeah, it's only 10,000 being made.
5246334	5249516	That shows you how rabid the fans are that they've already sold it out.

5383054	5385495	It's over here at... It's a Capcom game.

5485104	5487185	And Tales of Grace's F on PS3.
5489474	5493257	All right, just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.
5493998	5494719	But first, Loki.
5496060	5499863	Well, we were talking about Facebook and how they want to shove advertisements down our throat.
5499903	5502966	Well, Sony has patented something to shove advertisements down our throat.
5503507	5504447	It's called a TV.
5504728	5512955	No, actually, it's called interactive TV ads, which basically allow you... And I've actually kind of seen this on some other websites.
5512995	5513536	For example...
5515617	5522163	One of the interactive bits about it, like a McDonald's ad or something like that, and you have to say McDonald's to end commercial.
5522604	5525466	And if you say McDonald's, then the commercial ends, that type of thing.
5526567	5529770	There's a website, as I talked about a lot, of Freddie Wong.
5529890	5532052	They do videos and stuff like that.
5532072	5532852	They have a YouTube channel.
5532872	5536856	But they have their own website called Rocket Jump, and their video player that they have on there has ads.
5537356	5539859	But to skip the ads, you have to type a word in.
5540559	5548486	So you can watch the ad or you can type, you know, Ford Focus and it'll stop the ad.
5548907	5554492	So it's kind of like, okay, this way the advertiser knows this person saw the ad.
5554532	5556273	It's not just like clicking on skip.
5556374	5560637	They know what the product is and they're aware of what you're trying to do.
5561078	5563620	So that's kind of cool.
5563920	5564221	I mean...
5565882	5577442	I just don't know what sort of things and games are going to require advertisements or commercials where I actually have to say something in order to have them go away, but...
5579045	5579665	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5606633	5608635	Well, I don't want to get into it.
5608675	5613900	To be fair, the Viagra was not made to do that.
5614000	5618444	It was made for heart problems, but it just happened to have this side effect.
5620005	5620666	Oh, how's your heart?
5620946	5621387	Boner!
5622408	5625611	That happens in the pharmaceutical industry a lot of times.
5625631	5632397	Well, the medication I was taking for my chronic fatigue syndrome is actually what they all prescribe for narcolepsy.
5632819	5637280	Isn't it kind of ironic, though, that they tell you that you shouldn't use Viagra if you have heart problems?
5637981	5641062	You know, it's like... Well, because it was for a certain type of heart condition.
5641122	5641762	I'm not a doctor.
5641782	5644403	I'm not going to try to explain it, but... Anyhow.
5645163	5650885	Some folks in chat says... Hitstun says, Adblock Plus is made for invasive ads like this.
5651425	5654526	And RDGSinge says, Thank God for ad and flash blockers.
5655046	5663112	That's true in browsers, but when you're talking about being built in the consoles, I'm assuming this is going to be streaming stuff, like I'm watching ad-supported things.
5663292	5663552	Yeah.
5663932	5665713	Which, I mean, it's ad-supported.
5665813	5668315	It's like if I'm watching TV, and it's free.
5668355	5669076	If you're on Hulu.
5669236	5677341	If Sony's about to do something like the Kinect, where they're putting a microphone in your living room, because think about it, Microsoft could incorporate this into the Kinect right now.
5677361	5682285	Can you imagine if the Kinect would interrupt you, for example, like you're talking about...
5682765	5685566	Man, I wish I... Where do you want to eat tonight?
5686427	5689108	Hey guys, were you talking about eating somewhere?
5689128	5690949	Oh my god, that's terrible.
5690969	5695351	Can you imagine we're sitting here doing the show and Jamie's like, Rob, let's just end the show and go to Pinkberry.
5695571	5700773	And then suddenly up on the TV it all, did you know Pinkberry's latest flavor is chocolate hazelnut?
5700933	5703996	We laugh about that now, but that is the future.
5704016	5706618	No, no, no, no.
5706718	5708479	We have to put our foot down.
5708880	5712243	The whole Big Brother is watching you 1984.
5712403	5713644	Do you want to be in that?
5713684	5714404	Here's the thing, though.
5714544	5715886	But that's targeted advertising.
5715906	5716366	Unplug it.
5716426	5717447	That's targeted advertising.
5717547	5725434	You want to know about Pinkberry versus you want to know about natural male enhancement or you want to know about... I don't need natural male enhancement.
5725634	5727776	I have natural male enhancement.
5730890	5733592	What's not natural about, you know, naked boobies?
5733652	5735333	I mean, that's natural male enhancement.
5735353	5736995	Or whatever, turns you on.
5737675	5738976	Although I like boobies, but, you know.
5743099	5746221	They should have a strip club named Natural Male Enhancement.
5746381	5747562	That would be pretty awesome.
5750899	5760083	Alright, um, rdgsinge in chat says, I did that trick to block MS ad servers from pushing ads on my Xbox system, but every now and then they get through.
5760163	5761643	Would be nice to know what to update.
5762004	5769627	You know, but we have ads on vognetwork.com and, you know, it isn't free to produce this stuff.
5770207	5780471	We pay for a lot of this shit out of pocket because it's our hobby and it's, you know, what we like to do, but I just would really appreciate it if you like the shows at vognetwork.com.
5780811	5804391	just put it on the whitelist for fuck's sake like we really tried to design things to not be invasive because we know you know like you guys we don't want to be invasive but you know when you block them all you're blocking the little guys too click an ad every once in a while once in a while visit the site help us out you can click the ad and then close the page all right moving on
5805717	5833960	technically I think encouraging people to do that is like a violation of the whatever don't be suspicious when you do it alright they know that's what's going on moving on one more thing maybe this is a little more exciting let's end this ranty and depressing and sad segment of Orange Lounge Radio well we're about to be off for a week with something a little better and that is that Harmonix is apparently looking for a combat designer what
5835020	5837062	I was thinking everybody's kung fu fighting.
5859100	5884849	or or you know when you're a jet you know you're a jet you know it's capoeira game who knows anything's possible uh in addition to finishing development on rock band blitz and dance central 3 harmonix is actively developing multiple new ips on next generation hardware we're looking for the best and most experienced devs out there to join us so obviously speculate away what the hell could this be um you know a lot of people making up their own ideas but
5884969	5885529	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5912409	5913389	I'll believe it when I see it.
5915070	5916450	I am the queen of JTB.
5916590	5917450	I want to see the receipts.
5917710	5921671	I just think it's ironic that a music game company is working on an action game.
5922151	5922712	That could be cool.
5922892	5926132	TigerClaw in chat says, maybe Harmonix is working on a Battle of the Bands game.
5926412	5929813	You're in a band and you actually have to battle each other by hitting each other with musical instruments.
5929833	5932834	That's been done on the Wii and it was terrible.
5933014	5936455	And it was called Battle of the Bands and they literally had it where you
5937075	5939636	Your band equipment would turn into a minigun.
5939676	5941656	Tiger Claw is going to get taken to court.
5942396	5944056	Sued for $1.2 billion.
5944196	5946977	It's terrible.
5947297	5948597	Battle of the bands on the Wii.
5950177	5953998	If you want to have battles right away, Yakuza 5 will have dance battles.
5954278	5959379	Because you know, don't we just love minigame dancing in every fucking game?
5959459	5964500	So Yakuza 5 will have... Well, granted, Yakuza has a lot of shit going on.
5964580	5964760	So...
5966241	5969744	Maybe this isn't completely out of character for the Yakuza series, but whatever.
5969784	5971886	They are doing dance battles.
5972127	5976852	And Yakuza 5, one of the subplots is about the adopted daughter of Kazuma Kiryu.
5976952	5977833	It's Haruka.
5978213	5979955	She's trying to become an idol.
5980976	5982297	So you'll do these dance battles.
5982377	5983358	It's a little rhythm game.
5983418	5987322	I could explain more about it, but whatever.
5988203	5992766	Let's hope that Harmonix isn't working on a step-up revolution game.
5993066	5993467	Let's hope.
5993547	5998270	She wants to be a pop idol so that her song will be featured in the newest anime put out by Gainax.
5998930	5999531	No, not really.
5999831	6000311	Can't wait.
6002733	6005194	They have karaoke and sleeping dogs.
6005755	6009717	Let's travel to a time when we didn't get so fucking mad about everything.
6009737	6010438	Except this game.
6010458	6011699	We got really mad at one of the bosses.
6013170	6014291	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6032341	6037443	If you're super depressed about all these studios closing, why not play some of the greats from the past?
6037984	6044306	Yeah, if you're depressed, pretend you're a ninja and slice shit to death and blow shit up with ninja bombs.
6044546	6045327	Go into denial.
6045447	6046567	Yeah, go into denial.
6047448	6055091	The game of the week is called Shadow of the Ninja, or as it was known in Japan, Yaminoshigote... Okay, I'm going to mispronounce this.
6055171	6056452	It's Yaminoshigote...
6057472	6079533	Shigotonin Kage which is Dark Professional Shadow that's actually a cooler name so basically it's a futuristic ninja themed side scroll arcade action type game and I am trying to get the audio up but remember when Natsume didn't do Harvest Moon no actually I don't this was a game by Natsume
6081888	6084751	It came out in Japan in 1990 and came out in North America in 1991.
6086112	6090956	The PAL version was published by Taito under the name Blue Shadow, which is actually a pretty cool name.
6092417	6093197	Oh, because he's blue.
6093598	6100823	Well, yeah, but also there was this big thing in the 80s and early 90s in England where you couldn't, say, have ninja in the title.
6101824	6105087	Like, for example, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles.
6106408	6107088	Rob, did you know that?
6107849	6108369	I did know that.
6108389	6108570	Okay.
6108590	6108690	Cool.
6109266	6124753	Well, Natsume also did a Game Boy version of this, however, it actually got picked up by Tecmo and they tried to make it into a Ninja Gaiden game called Ninja Gaiden Shadow, which is sort of half Shadow of the Ninja and half Ninja Gaiden and 100% kind of crap.
6126494	6126574	What?
6142094	6144758	Well, actually, in Hindi it means eagle.
6145078	6146080	I learned that from doing yoga.
6147642	6156955	Has taken over the USA and made a big stronghold in the middle of the nation's, quote, largest city.
6157435	6164620	So these two ninja, Hayate and Kaede, have to go infiltrate the stronghold and kill him to death!
6166661	6174105	So it is up to two players simultaneous, or you can pick one or the other, which is, like I said, Hayate or Kaede.
6175046	6181430	And you can... There's actually no difference between who you play, really.
6182410	6183711	But they just look differently.
6184592	6184712	Um...
6187259	6197269	And, uh, you, uh, basically you can run, you can crouch, you can climb ladders, you can actually, um, hang from certain areas overhead.
6197690	6200032	Including a lot of the moving platforms, you can do that too.
6200052	6205477	Um, and you actually can get, uh, you can build up your weapon over time too.
6206558	6207859	They have special attacks.
6208419	6214703	One of them is a thunderstorm that will just damage all the on-screen enemies, but it takes half your life to do it.
6214883	6217725	It actually is quite possible to play this whole game without using any of that.
6218665	6220026	Your default weapon is katana.
6220607	6222568	However, you can also get kusarigama.
6223528	6230973	It has a longer range, but the katana will actually get a full screen range once it's fully powered up, and everyone really likes it better.
6231933	6234335	You also can get some limited use items.
6234355	6241759	You get shuriken or what my husband calls the ninja bomb, which is just some sort of hand grenade.
6244340	6251124	And then once you use up your number of those, you actually go back to either using the katana or the kusarigama.
6252084	6254505	For anyone who doesn't know what that is, it's a hook on a rope.
6254866	6255046	Okay.
6255066	6255166	Okay.
6256790	6260271	Um, it has five levels, um, totaling 16 stages.
6260892	6263753	The first four are in three stages, the final one is in two.
6264653	6278359	And, uh, you have your bosses, you have your mini-bosses, and, uh, you, um, when you beat a boss it explodes, but the explosion heals you, and you can, that way you can carry over life into the next level.
6279279	6286861	if your game will actually be over if you lose all of your energy and you only have five continues.
6287721	6292362	If you have two players in the game, your continues are shared, so I hope you're playing with someone who doesn't suck.
6293202	6301304	But, I mean, the game was really awesome when it came out, and, I mean, just sit and watch a playthrough of this, or play it yourself if you've got it.
6302164	6306245	It's got neat effects, great animation for a NES game.
6306305	6308466	The music, Bob, turn up some music if you don't mind.
6316844	6318165	The music is really good.
6319306	6324290	And it's totally worth... It has an old Mega Man feel to it a little bit.
6324430	6324831	A little bit.
6325031	6325711	Yeah, a little bit.
6326272	6331997	In fact, there are actually these little enemies that slide across the floor slowly, but when you're on the floor, they move faster.
6332837	6334799	It totally made me think of some Mega Man 2 enemies.
6334919	6336961	Let me go to part one here.
6336981	6338842	You just have to scroll past the intro.
6339022	6341845	Just to get the first level music.
6345014	6346022	I guess they're waiting for Stage 1-2
6357044	6363447	It's a really neat game, and on top of that, you can find it really inexpensive in a used game store.
6363967	6366508	It's a game that I think everyone should have in their collection.
6366628	6370369	Yeah, the American box art is stupendously hokey looking.
6370449	6376612	It's like, ooh, action game with a couple of ninja who look, you know, amazingly white.
6377872	6387237	So, but it really is a very, very good game and I totally recommend everyone, you know, shell out the five to ten bucks it is at your local used video game store.
6388177	6389418	Shadow of the Ninja, get it.
6391438	6395420	There it is, a classic game of the week, Shadow of the Ninja on the NES.

6406539	6408861	All right, we're going to take a break, but don't go anywhere, guys.
6408881	6416165	We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio after a quick break where, yes, we'll talk a little bit about that Nintendo Power thing I'm sure you've all heard about.
6416266	6417486	We'll talk a little bit about that.
6417967	6420468	And we're going to talk about some changes to Diablo 3.
6421249	6434958	We'll talk all about that and more, including your emails, your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR, and your phone calls coming up a little later, including one phone call from someone who has something to say about Wii U, who actually has touched one and played one.
6434978	6436119	I've got something to say.
6436719	6438381	Nothing to say!
6438401	6439002	I miss that show.
6439022	6444748	By the way, if you want to know my favorite TV show of all time, of all time, ever, and it's on Netflix.
6445448	6446169	It's on Netflix?
6446249	6446630	Oh, yeah.
6447130	6448211	Strangers with Candy.
6449072	6450854	The most amazing 30 episodes.
6451715	6455098	A 30-minute episode is what when it's cut out the commercials?
6455118	6455499	Like 23 minutes?
6455519	6455699	22, yeah.
6456900	6457500	So put it together.
6457600	6459341	Most amazing 600 minutes of your life.
6459861	6461242	That's what you should do Labor Day weekend.
6461282	6463483	Make it a point to watch every episode of Strangers with Candy.
6463623	6467245	This is the greatest sitcom I have ever seen in my life.
6467265	6473108	It's not even really a sitcom, but it's... Look, Stephen Colbert was in it before he had that Colbert rapport.
6473648	6476770	And he is my absolute inspiration as an educator.
6478871	6480612	Where's your permission slip, Mr. Knoblet?
6481012	6482753	Shut your dirty little mouth!
6485456	6492445	fucking amazing now I'm going to be thinking about that as we go to break we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this
6498238	6506101	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this last episode for the month of August.
6506941	6508422	And again, we won't be here next week.
6508442	6509902	Have a great Labor Day, those of you in the States.
6509962	6512843	Those of you not in the States, have a great weekend, whatever it is you do.
6513343	6523567	But sadly, we won't be here live next weekend as we enjoy the three-day weekend and catch up on some games that we've been needing to catch up on or Marathon Strangers of Candy, one of the two.
6524267	6527069	Alright, let's get into some rapid fire news.
6527369	6533433	Some quick news stories for you guys before we get to the Facebook and Google question of the week, or the Fugle question of the week.
6533914	6534554	First off, Loki.
6534934	6537916	Microsoft wants to let you know that the Kinect has dropped in price to $109.99.
6539217	6543020	That's $40 cheaper than it was when it first came out.
6545041	6546182	The game's being better, though?
6547285	6548366	Thank you for watching!
6567867	6568608	It's probably under $10.
6570209	6568608	$6.71.
6570549	6572350	You can't beat that.
6572670	6582635	If you pledge $6.71, not only will you get the games that they were offering, which were Field Runners, Bit.Trip Beat, Space Chem, and Uplink.
6582795	6589759	You would have previously unlocked Spirits, but you also now will unlock World of Goo, Osmos, Anomaly, and Edge.
6590859	6615898	all those games available for Android and for PC they're multi-platform so you get the Steam codes as well as the DRM free downloads for all that stuff actually I should correct myself to get the Steam codes you have to pay over a dollar so obviously if you're paying over the average you would get the Steam codes but check them out sounds awesome
6617603	6626930	And then, last but not least, that wonderful Scott Pilgrim online multiplayer DLC that was also going to unlock an additional character and whatnot.
6627790	6629892	Yeah, it got delayed to the fall.
6630472	6631153	Womp womp.
6631813	6636056	I don't know why, but that's unfortunate.
6636276	6640299	And I guess the PlayStation Network version will also release during that time frame as well.
6642881	6644642	Alright, moving on with some other stories.
6644662	6644963	So,
6647330	6651093	I wish I could, but my internet is slowing down and I don't have the skills.
6651113	6652954	Yeah, that's what I was running into.
6653134	6654195	Something's up with our web.
6654255	6656857	We suddenly just lost our web.
6657097	6658258	Mine just plain hasn't worked today.
6658918	6662901	I don't know what's going on, but awkward pause.
6663061	6663361	All right.
6664322	6667164	I wonder if, oh shit, I wonder if we just had a stream hiccup because of that.
6668598	6669038	Let me look.
6670279	6671120	No, we're still connected.
6672160	6674982	The joys and pains of doing live radio.
6675002	6675363	That's all right.
6675383	6676483	I have a few things here for you guys.
6676523	6676764	All right.
6677664	6678765	Mashihiro Sakurai.
6678905	6681727	You know that name because he's the director of Super Smash Brothers.
6682167	6692234	He mentioned at the CEDEC developer conference in this past week that the Smash Brothers game on Wii U and 3DS will have new and exciting moves for existing characters.
6692694	6695697	He also mentioned there will be, of course, a bunch of new characters.
6696537	6703684	Now will come the epically long tease of which characters will be there and which characters won't be there and so on and so on.
6704064	6707267	But it sounds like they are going to expand the moveset a little bit.
6707287	6711451	I'm wondering if that means there's going to be more than two buttons from here on out for Smash Bros.
6711471	6712172	That could be interesting.
6712831	6713992	Speculate away!
6714593	6716554	Because lots of people already are.
6716995	6718496	Still button mash brothers, I bet.
6719797	6721418	This is going to piss some people off.
6722339	6730706	This is coming from a former 3D modeler that worked at Rare on games like Donkey Kong 64, Jet Force Gemini, and so forth.
6731066	6731606	Apparently...
6732367	6738590	Rare did want to do a new Killer Instinct game, but Microsoft was more interested in broadening the Xbox user base.
6738970	6743092	Quote, the same game every Rare fan wants to see, and that's Killer Instinct 3.
6743192	6750095	We all wanted to make Killer Instinct 3, but Microsoft was more interested in broadening their demographic than making another fighting game.
6750395	6751476	So it never got made.
6751656	6752877	I doubt it never will.
6753797	6755559	Microsoft, FU!
6773557	6773798	Nope.
6774438	6774939	No, sir.
6775139	6777261	It's an iOS port of the game.
6777281	6778702	It's coming out next week.
6779162	6780724	And I believe the price on it is $20.
6780964	6785828	Because Square Enix likes to charge more money for their games than 99 cents.
6786129	6792114	To be fair, they don't shove the free-to-play model down your throat, make you buy power-ups and all that.
6792174	6795137	So at least for your $20, you're getting a well-rounded game.
6795157	6795877	And I gotta say...
6797158	6825702	some of their iPad games and such look great like their Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy 2 ports that they did on the original iPhone kind of before there was iPad looked great on the iPhone so you know I'm sure the game will look really good but I don't know again the lack of tactile controls I think is what frustrates a lot of people like we don't really want to see games like The World Ends With You get ported to iOS because touch controls kind of suck on a lot of these games at least I know that's what frustrates me
6826687	6833069	Yeah, and then $20 is still pretty expensive for anything that's on, you know, iOS.
6834450	6839271	I think for that reason, because it's, you know, you're kind of gimping the game a little bit.
6839291	6840132	Well, not everything's $0.99.
6840552	6852316	I was just looking at iPad apps today, and some of the better-selling iPad apps are the official Apple, you know, versions of, what is it, Keynote is like their PowerPoint-type thing, is one of their top sellers.
6852416	6852536	It's $9.99.
6853836	6855037	GarageBand does very well.
6855057	6855397	It's a $5 app.
6857057	6862259	Yeah, but $5.99 versus $20 is still a bit much.
6862359	6865940	Well, but how much did it cost on the DS?
6867481	6868181	Probably closer to $35.
6868221	6869802	Technically, it was free.
6870742	6873543	Well, it's been out for a while now.
6873603	6877204	I mean, you can buy it on the DS for probably less than $20.
6878305	6879545	Now that I'd agree with, yes.
6879965	6884587	So that's my issue with that is it's been out for a while.
6884907	6887949	I mean, they can put it at $20, but it doesn't mean everyone's going to buy it for that.
6888049	6893833	Well, look, I'm going to admit, and this might ruffle some feathers or whatever, but I actually didn't play this game on DS.
6893893	6894333	I didn't either.
6894413	6895814	I just didn't get around to it.
6896275	6897896	We don't have time to play every single game.
6898396	6908263	So I don't know if I would necessarily go out of my way to check it out on iOS, but I know there are some fans of this game and are really hoping it will result in a sequel.
6908323	6911305	It does make me think, oh, I need to go back and try the one on DS.
6911765	6912846	So we'll see.
6914947	6917671	Shima Panic in our chatroom says, the world ends with you.
6917711	6919413	DS was $40 at launch.
6919854	6920174	Thank you.
6922116	6920174	$40.
6922237	6924900	I think mine's actually still in my DS.
6924980	6926182	Makes $20 not seem so bad.
6928124	6928425	All right.
6929246	6929786	Let's move on.
6929846	6930247	DarkSakura.
6931326	6936930	Well, XSEED put out an announcement that Ragnarok Odyssey is going to have two editions to choose from.
6937410	6948798	The first one is a standard that's only the game, and then the mercenary edition that comes with the soundtrack, a mercenary guide that's sort of an art book and strategy guide, and monster cards, ten random ones.
6948878	6956244	The standard edition is $40, and the mercenary edition is $50, so it depends on how much money you want to spend for stuff that'll collect dust later.
6956844	6981919	Don't know And for fans of Dance Central, there is a song list out for Dance Central 3 Nine new songs actually have come out There's Afrojack featuring Eva Simmons, Take Over Control Alexandra Stan, Mr. Saxo Beat Half the shit I haven't heard of I know that song, it's a total gay bar song I don't know how else to phrase it
6982433	6986974	Ciara featuring Missy Elliott, One Two Step, Cupid with Cupid Shuffle, Daft Punk around the world.
6986994	6987675	I love Daft Punk.
6988515	6991576	Dev featuring the, what band is going to call themselves the Cataracts?
6992576	6993957	Hi, I'm an eye disease.
6994837	6995617	Bass down low.
6996457	7000019	Ener featuring Natasha, I guess is how it's supposed to be.
7000559	7005240	Calabria 2008, Martin Selvig featuring Dragonette, Hello.
7005980	7006661	That song's cute.
7006701	7007141	I know that song.
7007161	7007561	I like that song.
7008101	7028084	The Tramps, Disco Inferno I fucking love Disco Inferno because I was a little kid with my Saturday Night Fever soundtracks freaking dancing on my bed to Disco Inferno any song that has burn baby burn in the lyrics totally down for it around the world's gonna be awesome yep
7029435	7036644	Oh, and last but never least, there is a survival game coming up by... Can I read a comment from Stan in our chat room?
7037105	7039088	What band would call themselves Anthrax?
7041170	7044294	Well, no one ever accused metal bands of having much in the way of intelligence.
7046217	7047198	They're probably on heroin.
7051252	7052113	True statement.
7052693	7053134	Allegedly.
7053274	7054535	I like Anthrax, actually.
7055556	7056596	Who doesn't like Anthrax?
7056616	7059399	But you have to be in a certain mood for Anthrax.
7059799	7060860	Anthrax is just fun.
7061140	7062521	Anyway.
7063782	7075131	Anyway, the developer Clay Entertainment that did Shank is doing a survival game called Don't Starve that has a closed beta available to those who pre-order the game for a whopping $7.
7077133	7079495	I hear the closed beta is in Africa.
7080544	7085414	Africa because that's a game that they play all the time don't starve
7087356	7096162	Anyway, it's going to be $15 when it comes to Steam, so you're pretty much getting it for 77% off if you order it ahead of time.
7096983	7100986	The demo is on the official site, so you can give it a try for free.
7101406	7107590	It's about a gentleman scientist who has to go to the wilderness world of a demon, and he just doesn't starve.
7107870	7110893	So it's like Tokyo Jungle with Minecraft.
7110913	7111373	Minecraft.
7113402	7113762	I guess.
7114603	7115824	I'm going to buy it seven bucks.
7115844	7116164	Why not?
7116804	7117805	I can afford that.
7118586	7119226	Sounds cool.
7119446	7119747	Yeah.
7120467	7120827	Is that it?
7121868	7122208	Indeed.
7122629	7123629	Do you want to break things?
7123649	7125010	It's done.
7128252	7128533	All right.
7128593	7131235	Let's travel to the Fugle question of the week.
7131295	7132495	What is the Fugle question of the week?
7132976	7134737	Facebook and Google Plus.
7134917	7136919	Slam them together and you get Fugle.
7137799	7140301	Because you removed the plus.
7146144	7146264	What?
7146284	7146364	Wow.
7169048	7171949	Here it is on Google Question of the Week.
7172629	7176210	This is about the world ends with you getting announced for iOS to extremely missed reaction.
7176631	7180772	What game would you actually like to see ported to mobile phones?
7180972	7182673	iOS, Android, whatever your choice is.
7183193	7187814	Or would you be perfectly happy if we never had another port of a classic game again?
7188735	7191376	And of course, we expect the listeners to give us a little bit of why.
7192591	7195712	Panaxium said anything puzzle strategy or turn-based.
7195992	7199654	The controls wouldn't suffer much, which is important for the smartphone transition.
7200114	7203776	Those kinds of games would also be a lot easier to set aside with little notice.
7204236	7205957	Revenge of the Titans would be a blast.
7207498	7210721	Redertainment has a very get-off-my-lawn approach.
7211161	7217006	What happened to the good old days when phones were phones, music players were music players, and gas cost under $2?
7219868	7220989	That being said, Portal.
7222190	7230477	I would like to see the classic game Portal ported to mobiles just to see the spectacular ways that game would crash my phone and drain my battery like a vampire.
7230977	7233579	Well, yes, it is now a classic.
7233599	7233639	No.
7236032	7237273	Okay, 10 years from now.
7237373	7239015	In 10 years, yeah, it'll be a classic.
7240576	7244599	Maybe I shouldn't have said classic game in the question because I think Portal's a fine answer.
7244659	7246360	But anyway, also Tetris.
7246760	7249442	Not the version available now that required swiping.
7249562	7254006	A version of Tetris with button-based controls that I can play on the go seems like a great idea to me.
7254406	7258949	Yes, I remember the Tetris DS exists, but I want to play competitively and my Wi-Fi at home sucks.
7260982	7265783	Jim replied saying I would love to see a port of Deja Vu utilizing the touch controls of course.
7266623	7270384	Remember those old ass PC games like Shadow, was it Shadow Run?
7271264	7272684	No, Shadow Run's the other game.
7272764	7273324	Shadow Keep.
7274524	7275805	I'm the one that liked Loom, so.
7276005	7276265	Yeah.
7276685	7280065	No, I remember Deja Vu and then there was another one, The Uninvited or something like that.
7280125	7284586	It was a whole trilogy of them that was on the NES and they were originally Mac games if I remember right.
7284906	7285486	Shadow Gate.
7286166	7286646	Shadow Gate.
7286686	7288587	Shadow Gate was freaking hard.
7288907	7289287	God.
7290748	7317763	Shadowgate had an amazing soundtrack though oh my god I seriously have you ever done Shadowgate as the classic game of the week if not you really need to think about it I never really was a fan of Shadowgate to be honest I'm doing it a week you're gone then I'll do it I mean I know a lot of people like it can I play some epic music from Shadowgate real quick sure I just love the music in Shadowgate I like this music but then like the death music was really freaky
7320649	7323171	Like, shit, I died.
7323351	7329476	Harpsichord for Ness.
7329496	7333979	Moving on to... Says Donkey Kong for iCade.
7334159	7337802	It was the original April Fool's joke and it sold me on the iCade.
7338222	7342906	If Nintendo ever released on iOS phones, it should start with their 80s arcade games.
7344968	7345389	Let's see.
7346249	7352594	Actdeft replied, despite me hating on the iOS port of The World Ends With You, I would really like to see Viva Pinata on mobile.
7352954	7356516	The game is great to play for short amounts, and it will keep you really occupied playing it.
7356877	7357317	Interesting.
7357397	7361200	He takes an approach that's not about controls, but about the way we play games.
7361780	7366964	And maybe a game like Viva Pinata in short bursts is better suited for mobile phones.
7367744	7369766	How would you feel about Animal Crossing on mobile phones?
7371287	7372347	Monitoring my village.
7373635	7375536	That would be crack That's a death joke Tiara
7400723	7401324	Hi Tiara!
7401745	7404869	Geek-life.com Wonderful site, please visit it.
7405190	7409436	Tiara from Geek-Life replies and says, this is Facebook now by the way,
7410000	7416362	They're already on every other type of console ever, so I'd love an iOS port of Final Fantasy 4 and Final Fantasy 6.
7417302	7426366	I have the original Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy Tactics on my iPhone, and I love being able to play them when I'm on the subway or looking for something quiet to do while my hubby is working on law school stuff.
7426766	7432047	It's great having old classics that I love at my fingertips without having to carry around anything larger than my phone.
7432508	7439490	You know, Tiara, you might already know this, but they did a really good port of Final Fantasy 3, the DS version that's on the iPhone.
7439930	7440711	I've been playing that
7461904	7463865	which I'm sure some people, not everybody's a fan of.
7464185	7477570	And plus, I don't know, there was a lot I liked about the DS remake and there was a lot I just, it was just weird seeing the sprite-based game I used to love in the 3D environment was so weird.
7478905	7482108	But then again, I would love to see that opera scene from 6 redone.
7482168	7482448	You know?
7482788	7485030	There's things I'd like.
7486271	7488333	Zether says, Time Crisis.
7488593	7491255	Touch controls for a light gun game just sound right.
7491355	7493597	That actually does sound like a really good idea.
7493717	7494518	And they've already done that.
7495390	7496251	Did they do Time Crisis?
7496531	7497191	I believe they did.
7497251	7498812	Oh, well, maybe Zether needs to go check the store.
7498832	7499773	How about Point Blank then?
7500734	7502054	How about Point Blank?
7502115	7503716	I was going to say Point Blank would be awesome.
7503756	7504996	Great fucking suggestion.
7506778	7514143	Nick M replies and says, I would love a port of the original Worms Armageddon, not a sequel because Team 7 has screwed up every Worms game since.
7514583	7518445	I chose this game because the gameplay and fun factor would not be affected by touch controls.
7518906	7519366	I could see that.
7519866	7521067	I'm sure there's Worms clones.
7521087	7523989	There's got to be clones all over the marketplace already.
7526511	7530034	Alan replied and said, troll answer, Steel Battalion.
7531235	7532316	Serious answer.
7533056	7537100	I think the Panzer Dragoon games would clean up nice and make great use of tilt controls.
7537340	7538481	Res would be great too.
7538901	7541683	Steer with tilt and drag finger for linking targets.
7541763	7543465	That's surprisingly not a bad idea.
7543885	7544466	Good job, Alan.
7545872	7548553	Matt replied, Matt J replied on Facebook with a no.
7548893	7549993	We're finally seeing some no's.
7567757	7572079	which specific hardware in mind just don't translate well to the ever-changing mobile platforms.
7572559	7574060	I agree with what some have said.
7574360	7575701	The World Ends With You is worth $20.
7576801	7578342	It's worth $20 on the DS.
7578462	7580423	It's not worth $2 on iOS.
7580783	7582444	It will not be as good of an experience.
7583004	7584805	A good example is Grand Theft Auto 3.
7585485	7586626	I got it for my iPad.
7586706	7590587	I've yet to beat the very first mission for the horrible car controls just drive me nuts.
7591128	7593489	I beat the same game years back on the PC.
7593749	7594109	Loved it.
7594389	7597898	I'm just glad I only paid a buck for Grand Theft 3 Eios.
7598158	7599401	Did they ever do Dragon's Lair?
7600564	7600785	Yes.
7601025	7601787	I'm sure they did.
7601948	7603572	I mean, I was just thinking that one would be perfect.
7604402	7608565	I'm going to quickly go through some of these other ones, just read kind of the game or whatever.
7609525	7617390	Haseo Sumirogaro replied and said, no, in a nutshell, because IOS will fuck it up like they fuck up most games.
7618331	7625235	Loco Poco replied saying, a mobile version of the adventure game, The Neverhood, point and click adventure games would be great ported.
7625515	7629077	And he's not happy about the Square Enix World's Ends With You remake.
7630038	7632900	Stan replied, a new chapter to the Space Channel 5 series.
7634264	7635846	for iOS or for anything.
7637448	7641512	Hitstun said Missile Command and Crystal Castles work great on multi-touch phones.
7641853	7644375	You know, they do have that in the Atari thing.
7644415	7648920	I think he said, I think he knows that because he says they work great on multi-touch phones.
7648940	7649882	What about Marble Madness?
7650748	7651789	That's a good idea too.
7652510	7656114	He does say more faithful ports of classic trackball games.
7656755	7657495	Marble Madness.
7657595	7657996	There he is.
7658076	7659037	Marble Madness, he says.
7659337	7660378	An arcade perfect port.
7660699	7662781	Capcom Bowling would be a natural too.
7663322	7667186	Maybe we could get a port for the Japanese only Sega Sonic the Hedgehog.
7669941	7671842	and lastly... There's a game called Manic Marble.
7672122	7674504	Lastly, I'm not sure what Clover Nikon means by this comment.
7674604	7676925	LucasArts Outlaws First Person Shooter.
7677185	7678286	Was that a game LucasArts did?
7678326	7679607	I don't know the game Outlaws.
7679767	7682028	Is that a LucasArts game that I'm just not ringing a bell?
7682328	7691033	Because when I think LucasArts, I think of the old strategy games like Loom and Indiana Jones and shit and Maniac Mansion and all that.
7692114	7692934	I'm looking right now.
7693655	7699178	Of course, I'm sure the chatterers at live.vognetwork.com will be happy to correct me in a minute.
7701940	7702781	I'm looking right now.
7703801	7704422	Let's see.
7706063	7706483	Outlaws.
7706603	7706984	Yeah.
7707064	7708525	Shooter game for the Commodore 64.
7708565	7709826	I'll be damned.
7710306	7712227	1985 and 1997 there were different releases.
7712888	7713708	That's not the one.
7713728	7715650	The 97 release must be the one he's talking about.
7716110	7717931	Yes, it was LucasArts and the Jedi Engine.
7718292	7719552	I didn't know this game at all.
7720613	7721374	Now I want to look it up.
7721914	7722975	Was it Jedi Outlaws?
7723815	7723976	No.
7724236	7725657	It was done in that Jedi Engine.
7726077	7726337	Let me look.
7726357	7729720	Because I remember they had the first person shooter one that was from 1997 or whatever.
7729740	7729860	Mm-hmm.
7732421	7737065	I'm looking it up right now, except YouTube won't work, so I'll have to look later.
7739508	7743251	Alright, anything quickly you guys would like to see on iOS or not?
7745013	7745874	Second point blank.
7748957	7750238	A real marble madness, I guess.
7750771	7752531	I'd like a Marble Madness sequel type of thing.
7753592	7757873	Maybe a better version of Silent Hill and Metal Gear Solid, those shooters.
7758473	7762394	On iOS though, I can't see Silent Hill on iOS.
7762454	7765175	They had a Silent Hill iPhone game and it was terrible.
7765215	7767956	It's like the old Sega shooter games.
7768176	7769976	Any of the Sega shooters would be pretty cool.
7770016	7770176	Like...
7774889	7787147	Gunblade Gunblade would be fucking awesome also any of the shooters any of their arcade stuff
7787577	7789238	Alright, I knew the chatters wouldn't let me down.
7789978	7792680	VXJSNXV says, Outlaws was quite fun indeed.
7792800	7796742	I think I bought it at some point and sucked at it a lot for some reason.
7797142	7803185	Dungeon Buster says, Outlaws cutscenes had the same animated look that Full Throttles did, only stylized for a western adventure.
7805086	7808268	Taiki in our chat reminds us there was Marble Madness 2.
7808328	7809449	It was called Marble Man.
7809689	7810369	Marble Man.
7810609	7812010	I don't think that ever actually came out though.
7812030	7813091	It was like a prototype thing.
7813131	7814752	One of those legendary games, right?
7816052	7818253	S2100 Matt says, this sounds like a listless topic.
7819374	7821395	Maybe next time.
7821435	7822636	Let's get some more news out of the way.
7822676	7822936	Loki.
7823836	7829759	It's unfortunate, but Nintendo Power is coming to an end.
7830240	7833181	Their last issue will be running in December.
7833361	7838204	Unfortunately, they just have no plans on continuing any further than that.
7839144	7839805	Before, they were...
7841105	7848849	Running it through in-house stuff, but then it was forwarded to future publishing in 2007.
7854811	7857672	Print media is just not as popular anymore as it used to be.
7858733	7862374	And then, of course, Nintendo is going to be getting their news out slightly differently.
7862815	7864836	Can I just say this real quick about Nintendo Power, though?
7865136	7867937	Because I saw a lot of the people on Twitter and Facebook were saying like,
7868537	7869958	This makes me really sad.
7870018	7871998	I used to love this magazine as a kid.
7872058	7875399	I remember when I had Nintendo Power and it's just kind of funny.
7876580	7885383	And while it is sad in a way, I think you're really sad that you're getting older because nobody said, I'm really sad it's going away because I'm currently subscribed.
7886543	7887583	Nobody said that.
7888244	7892305	I think a lot of people are just sad because it's a relic from their childhood.
7892365	7893185	It's no longer there.
7893265	7896506	But hello, they went bankrupt because nobody was still subscribed.
7896806	7898887	Anybody in here subscribed to Nintendo Power currently?
7899127	7899547	Nope.
7900388	7903489	And let's be real, it's changed hands over the years and so forth.
7903509	7904909	There is no more Howard and Nestor.
7905566	7905747	Nope.
7906488	7909534	It's just, it's tough for a print magazine to survive right now.
7910196	7910596	It's tough.
7911278	7912280	I would have loved for an e-book.
7912300	7913723	That makes me so sad.
7913803	7916348	It's just... Because that's like what I went to school for.
7916368	7917010	I know, but...
7918383	7920624	Got to evolve into the digital format.
7921004	7923526	On the Wii U tablet, you could have flipped through pages or something.
7923546	7924366	It would have been awesome.
7925587	7933651	So to get the word out about the Wii U release date and pricing, September 13th, they're going to be doing another press event.
7934151	7935191	They're going to be talking about it.
7935291	7936752	It's going to be held in New York City.
7937813	7942275	And the least that's assumed what they're going to be talking about is the Wii U pricing and release date.
7944559	7947001	249, 3349, and November 18th.
7949823	7950323	We'll see, Loki.
7950343	7951324	That's just a guess.
7951904	7953726	Allegedly.
7954246	7957368	The titles that were released on the 20th now move to the 13th.
7957408	7960290	Alright, we'll see.
7961011	7961711	Alright, moving on.
7962031	7964073	You remember Adventure on the Atari 2600?
7965033	7970857	Back in the days of the Atari 2600 where we had games like Baseball, Basketball,
7971798	7972899	Video Pinball
7991269	7998651	Well, also, Adventure was just kind of a neat little game that, you know, a lot of games, like, you see things in Adventure that influence the Legend of Zelda, for real.
7998791	8002532	Like, a lot of what comes to Legend of Zelda was in Adventure on the Atari 2600.
8003152	8005073	Therefore, it has its fans.
8005553	8009614	And more than 30 years later, we're looking at yet another sequel to Adventure.
8010054	8016276	Now, I believe there was a prototype some time ago of Adventure 2, but that's not part of the canon that we have now.
8016856	8031780	What we do have is that in 2009, there was Evil Magician Returns, which was programmed by ByteKnight from the Atari Age forums, and he did this in 2009, and this is in reference to the unseen antagonist who stole and hid the chalice in the original game.
8031820	8035921	He didn't have the rights to call it Adventure 2, but he could call it Evil Magician.
8036977	8038217	Hooray, generic bad guy.
8038558	8041639	Well, now, Evil Magician returns too.
8042879	8043039	Ah!
8044020	8045080	He's back, bitch.
8046641	8049642	You have to overcome both him and his apprentice.
8050062	8052103	They are personally guarding the chalice.
8052563	8057405	Keys, mazes, flickering grottos, and bats.
8059472	8060574	and it has come out.
8060674	8062217	Yes, it is an adventure game.
8062237	8065863	There has to be an Easter egg in there somewhere, so be on the lookout for that.
8066243	8068227	You know, I gotta say this.
8068687	8071853	For an Atari 2600 game, the graphics are pretty sweet.
8075134	8075334	DarkSakura?
8103695	8105056	Paragon System Mass Effect
8122471	8127275	has 100 additional levels for you to push through once you meet the current level max.
8127756	8135523	It's coming in update 1.0.4 and basically all of your experience that you get after 60 will be put into your Paragon levels.
8135963	8142949	So it gives you a boost in your core stats and an extra 3% boost in magic and gold find.
8145330	8158191	Also, there is this, trying to find where exactly it was, the Nephilim Valor bonuses will also give a 15% boost in experience towards the Paragon levels per stack.
8159593	8159894	So fun.
8161078	8165381	I love that they made the end game more exciting by basically adding 100 levels.
8166421	8166841	Pretty much.
8167041	8169743	Apparently there's some game balance things and other things they did too.
8169843	8171864	Like we talked about this on Horde House a little bit.
8172064	8175706	And Extifer has been playing a lot of Diablo lately because he's not really playing WoW right now.
8176047	8178748	But him and his partner play a lot, a lot of Diablo.
8179469	8182090	And he says it's great that the game balancing and everything is great.
8182230	8184672	Me, I haven't touched Diablo since like the first month it came out.
8184732	8184852	But...
8185672	8191454	Maybe I need to take a second look after WoW and Guild Wars and all that other stuff.
8191794	8192815	Free with Blood Pact.
8193895	8195036	Which you can't sign up for anymore.
8196576	8198777	Just a couple more news stories for you guys in the mailbag.
8199097	8202378	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is where the emails go.
8202498	8203479	But first, some more stories.
8205039	8205439	Alright.
8206580	8207880	This is kind of interesting.
8207900	8214783	You remember that whole Peter Molyneux thing that they were doing on the iOS platform where it was basically this
8215652	8218314	Curiosity was what the game was called.
8218674	8228480	It was kind of controversial because you can buy in-game things to help you chip away at this cube faster, including one piece that's $50,000 or $5,000.
8229060	8232663	So anyways, that game's been delayed to September.
8233303	8237786	Also, because it's been delayed, I'm not sure if this is the reason, but
8238626	8246732	They had to change their title because you may remember there was a certain program from NASA that landed a rover on Mars named Curiosity.
8249113	8250374	Yeah, that was kind of bad.
8250574	8253276	Well, that wasn't bad.
8253296	8256939	No, it was bad for Curiosity because they couldn't use a name anymore.
8256959	8259120	Bad for Peter Molyneux, but fuck him.
8259160	8263583	So now it's not just Curiosity, it's Curiosity What's in the Cube.
8264384	8266285	What's Inside the Cube is what it's called.
8266305	8267265	What's in the box?
8269167	8270509	Tell me what's in the box!
8273492	8274954	Pretty much, yeah.
8275034	8275814	You don't get seven.
8277917	8279178	So they have that going on right now.
8279498	8284444	I gotta wonder though, when is the next Apple announcement for iOS 6?
8284504	8286026	Isn't that supposed to be in September sometime?
8286526	8288268	The iPhone 5 announcement is happening.
8288368	8289569	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8318294	8320156	I thought they were able to fix that.
8320276	8323860	I thought they patched it somewhere on the back end or something.
8323920	8325982	Chiggers in our chat says, dick in a box.
8327583	8329826	That would be fucking hilarious.
8330066	8336172	Actually, Peter Molyneux would gain my ultimate respect if what's in the box, my dick.
8338674	8339816	That would make headlines.
8345197	8346778	I feel short-changed.
8346798	8347178	Alright, moving on.
8374758	8377199	Konami is set to shake the industry.
8380287	8382068	Goddammit, what is wrong with our web tonight?
8382128	8382748	Like, nothing's working.
8382768	8384409	Alright, I remember this story from earlier, though.
8385130	8388271	Konami is... I forget who said it at an event.
8388291	8389412	I want to say it was Kojima.
8389772	8398117	Somebody involved with Kojima Productions because there's an announcement coming up for Metal Gear's 25th anniversary and they were quoted as saying... It was Ken Mondaza.
8398177	8398597	Thank you.
8399017	8400138	With Kojima Productions.
8400178	8400798	It's only that, right?
8401078	8408222	Okay, that was quoted in saying that the industry is going to get shaken up.
8408522	8416269	Yeah, they have a lot of things to look forward to next week, not just for fans, but I think the industry is going to be shook by what we're going to be able to present here.
8419411	8421893	At least it's not a Frogger game.
8424716	8425476	That's all I know.
8425577	8426617	Oh, I finally got it here.
8426718	8427118	There we go.
8427864	8428064	Yeah.
8428424	8431145	I was going to say, my internet's working just fine, but... I don't know.
8431726	8434127	It's because I stream the show and all that off this computer, too.
8434147	8442090	But anyway, we will find out what the shakedown is August 30th when this event, it's the 25th anniversary event, will take place there at Tokyo Midtown.
8444648	8445328	Alright, whatever.
8447069	8447689	Moving on.
8448389	8450250	Let's get to the mailbag.

8578836	8579397	Next email.
8579457	8580538	Power pad games.
8582501	8583163	Dance aerobics.
8583183	8583844	Hump master.
8585872	8586793	No, it'd be Custer's Revenge.
8587133	8587393	Okay.
8588174	8589675	Greetings, Orange Lounge Radio.
8589775	8596059	This is a message from Mahaseo Sumiragawa regarding Final Fantasy and the rampant cases of disappearing acts.
8596279	8597500	Yeah, we... Oh, this is what we covered.
8598161	8603885	Okay, so six years ago, Square Enix announced Final Fantasy Versus XIII as part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis.
8604365	8608408	And since then, they put out a few trailers talking about the stories a bit.
8608908	8611190	And six years later, there's nothing because it came out in Japan.
8611210	8611630	Okay.
8612210	8616593	There hasn't even been present at E3, but that's not my point.
8617414	8623017	Now, last November, Square announced that they were going to release Final Fantasy X again, and needless to say, I squeed my voice hoarse.
8624198	8626079	After that, nothing, so this brings me to my point.
8626139	8628581	Is this going to be a trend with Square?
8628921	8633564	Announce the games that won't come out for years and years, and let's face it, look at what happened to Duke Nukem Forever.
8634384	8635585	Oh, that game was crap.
8636425	8642029	one last note to Lokis I'm aware you're smart with modding and computers, correct?
8642290	8650535	okay, so two questions firstly my boyfriend's computer doesn't have the programs installed onto his computer, is there a way to fix that?
8650756	8663865	I don't it says sorry for bad grammar but honestly the grammar is so bad that I can hardly make heads or tails of the lines doesn't have the programs installed I guess to mod?
8663885	8663945	mod?
8664588	8666273	and install the programs.
8666554	8671567	Where do you recommend to go buy a new hard drive for a PS3 and what's the largest size you can get?
8672794	8675536	I don't remember what it's called, Western Digital or something like that.
8697815	8718256	just look online for hard drives that will fit I think you have to watch out when you get really big hard drive sizes the actual hard drive itself gets thicker and it might not fit in the actual bay that they have so you have to kind of watch what you can fit in there at least I know that's the case with the Xbox when you're modding that
8719016	8722778	As far as modding, I'm assuming they're asking about modding the PS3 stuff.
8723578	8724679	Just download the apps.
8724879	8727060	You may have to check out some of the websites.
8727720	8732922	There's dashhacks.com or .net or something.
8732962	8734263	Dashhacks is the website.
8734363	8742146	They have information about doing hacks on PlayStation 3, PSP, Vita, when there's that stuff available online.
8742546	8743147	Thank you for watching!
8762463	8763364	Alright, so next email
8788653	8791155	I am an air traffic controller, airport hero.
8815168	8823130	Unlike games with similar names on iOS, such as Flight Control or Pocket Planes, this is a real puzzle game based on the very real intricacies of air traffic control.
8823610	8836893	Basically, you play the role of the five people in the ATC tower at the same time, telling pilots what routes to take coming into and out of the airport, giving permission to land and take off, giving taxing instructions, and confirming flight plans.
8837534	8838054	Thanks for watching!
8853337	8854157	You Jerk You Jerk
8877503	8905827	oh well you did say wish you were here at the end so I can't be too mean bring me back something Duffy and last email this says hello OLR after a long time I finally got to play Binary Domain I wish some interest I had some interest in it but I somehow never compelled to buy it thinking it would just be another shooter my girlfriend got it for me a couple days ago and I started playing and just could not stop this game is awesome I was told to sing it by the way
8907677	8908177	And you did.
8908377	8908758	And I did.
8909878	8910858	Sure, it's not perfect.
8910918	8913820	Controls aren't always spot on and the voice recognition isn't very good.
8914280	8919802	But the deep story, future Tokyo environment, graphics, voice acting, and sound make it a very good game.
8920262	8926505	You can literally shoot robots to pieces and it isn't that same gritty and brown world you see in countless other games.
8927005	8930727	This is the very first game that gave me goosebumps while playing the end sequence.
8931427	8933688	That's saying a lot when I get emotional about a game.
8934148	8936509	Sega should be deeply ashamed for not promoting this game more.
8936889	8940350	Binary Domain, Vanquish Bayonetta are all games that deserve better.
8940790	8943371	When you get the chance, buy this as it is very cheap.
8943751	8945171	That's all I have to say at this time.
8945391	8948752	As always, thanks a lot for making an episode of OLR every week.
8949072	8950113	You guys are amazing.
8950473	8953253	Yours truly, I'm just going to say first name, Fabrice from Belgium.
8954674	8956154	Yay, international emails.
8956394	8957215	Yay.
8958415	8959235	I want to go to Belgium.
8960716	8961896	And not for the waffles, Loki.
8964798	8967139	but you would have to have a waffle while you're there just to see.
8967719	8969579	No, I would have to have chocolate.
8969959	8971220	Chocolate and Trapeze Dale.
8971440	8971900	There you go.
8971960	8972380	Just saying.
8972700	8973080	Chimay.
8973420	8975521	Chimay comes from Belgium and Chimay is fucking amazing.
8976801	8982362	Alright, it's time for us to get a little bit angsty here with the FUs of the week.
8984043	8985143	Where's my angst music?
9001039	9003520	Um, I guess fuck you to concrete.
9003960	9009383	And the person in the Toyota who didn't use their turn signal at all and then tried to stop in front of me?
9009583	9010483	No, you're a dickface.
9011704	9015085	Um, and, uh, buh buh buh buh buh.
9016229	9016930	I really don't know.
9016990	9021414	I guess me for changing my schedule to 7 in the morning.
9021814	9028140	But at least I'm only out 30 minutes of sleep, and I don't have to deal with crap traffic in the morning.
9028801	9031183	Also, I really want a bagel, but no wheat.
9031383	9032204	Wheat is bad for me.
9033926	9035047	Bagels are so good, though.
9035567	9035788	Alright.
9035828	9036088	Hush.
9036829	9037149	Loki.
9038537	9042660	I guess the only really Effie that I can think of would be the Effie 2.
9043161	9050327	The person that was in front of me while I was coming into your apartment complex, they decided to park in front of the gate.
9050748	9053991	Like they drove through the gate and then parked right there.
9054011	9054251	I'm like...
9054691	9055471	Are you kidding me?
9055811	9058192	And he's just sitting there, I honk, he looks at his mirror.
9058972	9059512	What?
9060513	9063513	Oh, I guess I'll pull forward a little bit.
9063593	9066834	It's like, dude, you're in the fucking middle of the goddamn entrance.
9066874	9068675	It's just like... Selfishly inconsiderate.
9068695	9069375	What in the hell?
9069495	9070295	Find a parking space.
9070315	9073016	People have a sense of entitlement and don't think there's anybody else in the world.
9074048	9076369	I don't know what's wrong with these people That's it
9088323	9090644	Luckily the stream is staying up and that's the most important thing.
9090664	9092665	I just hope Skype will stay up as well.
9092745	9093926	It was doing the same thing at my house.
9094366	9103752	But like, I can't do, I'm really upset because somebody had a funny joke earlier when Jim Sally sent the email about what sexy games do you want to see on the sexy island.
9104392	9111596	Dark Tetsuya in chat said Miss Nude World 96, which was a perfect excuse for me to play the everybody move your body clip.
9111616	9113577	But thanks to the web errors, I can't get the clip up.
9116153	9120760	F you to the web for making me lose out on the funny hate.
9122843	9124346	Two more news stories, then phone calls.
9125127	9125748	First, Loki.
9125788	9128392	I'm even turning off everything on my iPhone just to see if it helps.
9129153	9132135	So there's a few demakes we should talk about.
9132435	9134116	The first being Borderlands.
9134216	9142281	Borderlands actually was demade into a 16-bit top-down shooter game for your browser, so you can check it out.
9143122	9149065	They call it The Borderlands, and you can check it... I love this website.
9149325	9154489	You can check it at www.wubwub.eu slash demake.php.
9154749	9156110	Wubwubwubwubwub.
9157550	9185661	it's just awesome so that's pretty cool and then since we were talking about Atari 2600 earlier somebody has decided to demake the Super Mario Brothers for the Atari 2600 now or at least it's done in the Atari 2600 style and he's got I guess a demo with level warp pipes, yellow blocks and flagpoles and I guess 15 levels up to 4.4 that's what he's hoping to do
9186221	9188662	and have a Koopa Kid at the end of each world as a boss.
9190683	9191003	Pretty cool.
9191183	9195905	And if you want to check that out, IndieGames.com's got the link for that.
9196305	9197426	Or I guess AtariAge.
9197446	9200047	I'm surprised it took that long for a Super Mario demake.
9200087	9201307	Surely this isn't the first.
9201388	9202828	It's just the most recent one.
9203008	9211512	Yeah, if you go to the AtariAge forums, there's a bin file for your emulators.
9212972	9223122	All right, well, if you ever saw the movie The King of Kong, you did not see Hank Chien in that movie, even though he is now the official world record holder of Donkey Kong.
9223222	9224303	He came after the movie.
9224323	9227026	Thank God that wasn't one of the titles for the contest, man.
9227106	9228147	The whole back and forth.
9228207	9228387	What?
9230288	9236350	Thank God it wasn't because Hank Chen would have won it again because guess what?
9236430	9238011	He broke his own record.
9238751	9241812	So you got to appreciate a guy who will keep challenging himself.
9242292	9246153	Like there's none of this, you know, Steve Weeby and all this stuff going on here.
9246213	9247834	He's just, he's challenging himself.
9248574	9273685	so he beat his previous record of 1,110,100 points the new record 1,127,700 points that's the new score from Hank Chien if you haven't heard that name of course he was the Donkey Kong world record holder before after that whole movie mess and all that stuff I believe what is it by day he's a plastic surgeon isn't he and that's how he can afford all these machines
9275106	9300438	or a machine you pay him for a new well I noticed in this picture he's posing next to a Donkey Kong machine and there's a moon patrol machine in the background too now I don't know if that's because he's like at an arcade like maybe some type of publicity event because I know fun spot he's got way too much smug on his face I don't necessarily think it's smug some people just take interesting pictures machines aren't that terribly expensive it's only a hundred bucks I mean I mean that for arcade game that's not bad
9301470	9313498	TheKongOff2 is where they gather the best Donkey Kong players at one location for glorious live competition.
9314779	9321003	Not that they're saying he's going to be in it, but there's obviously a lot of pressure for him to show up, which would be pretty cool.
9322323	9326406	SSJ100Matt in our chatroom at chat.orangelandry Live.vognetwork.com says,
9330393	9334120	Look guys, it was nine years of one particular website.
9334300	9335042	And Billy Mitchell?
9335483	9336965	Zero fucks given about him.
9337727	9338749	Or his damn hot sauce.
9340051	9341273	I hear the hot sauce isn't bad.
9342075	9342556	Just saying.
9343772	9347433	All right, that takes us to the Skype part of the show.
9348473	9356754	That's the part of the show where we're going to open up the Skype lines at 1-877-GAME-OLR and take your phone calls live on the program.
9356774	9361095	We will get to the Twitter as well, twitter.com slash OLR in just a moment.
9361135	9362556	But first, we're going to go to the phones.
9362836	9364576	And, oh, we already have a call on the line.
9364636	9365176	Let's go to it.
9365456	9366376	Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio.
9366396	9366736	Who's this?
9367276	9367677	Hey, guys.
9367717	9368077	It's Jason.
9368337	9368997	Hey, Jason.
9369017	9369297	What's up?
9369337	9369577	Hi.
9370481	9380987	So, as you so wonderfully alluded to earlier in the show, I was at the Wii U Consumer Experience here in Denver just yesterday.
9381927	9395895	Apparently, I think my friend told me they've been in since Thursday, and since he went to E3, he had codes assigned to me and a friend up, and we all got to go out there and see the... I'm assuming they're all going to be launch titles or something that's going to happen within the first couple of months.
9397695	9422264	and it's just really interesting because I was hearing obviously your cross with Bobby and you guys were really putting the Wii U down it's kind of astounding to me I understand in the fact that it's going to be a lot of the same thing and you have to get a whole new console just to be able to use the tablet even though everything else is going to be the same the controllers, the Wii Fit balance board and all that kind of stuff
9423445	9424846	But, I don't know.
9424886	9434734	That's speaking as a gamer myself, somebody who will pay the money to get something like this and not the common people that paid $200 to play Wii Sports forever.
9435441	9437142	Jason, I'm more worried about the games.
9437362	9443885	It's not the console itself, but I see a lot of what was happening with the 3DS happening here.
9443925	9449168	You have a lot of mediocre launch titles, and I don't think any really big standouts.
9450108	9451489	Here's your chance to change my mind.
9451949	9455991	What did you get your hands on that you are excited to drop money for a new console for?
9456522	9458403	They didn't really speak release dates.
9458663	9463525	And actually, as a matter of fact, when the event was wrapping up, they had this little quick little trivia session.
9463545	9465987	They were giving out a bunch of silly little prizes.
9466387	9468228	And one of them was a trick question.
9468328	9469729	When is the Wii U coming out?
9469769	9475932	The answer was holidays, but there's otherwise no specific date, barring what Loki said earlier about the 13th.
9475972	9477893	You know that the correct answer is November 18th.
9477933	9478553	That would have got him.
9479633	9481914	Even the people putting on this event wouldn't know that, though.
9482015	9482435	Yeah.
9483115	9486536	Yeah, it wasn't NDA, it wasn't sales, it wasn't media.
9486596	9490638	This is just, you know, bring your friends and let's play some really cool games.
9490658	9491478	We'll show you some stuff.
9491778	9492599	And it was really fun.
9493059	9503303	The boost that they set up, the things that I actually had, I didn't get my hands on everything, but they had setups for Nintendo Land, cycling through some of the mini arcade games.
9504243	9506024	Game & Wario, Super Mario Bros.
9506044	9516891	Wii U, Zombie U, Batman Arkham City, Pikmin 3, Just Dance 4, Wii Fit U, Rayman Legends, and then two non-finally named Project P100 and Sing.
9519632	9521794	and they looked good.
9522094	9529039	That's all I really have to say about it on the surface is that these games looked spectacular.
9529520	9532041	Super Mario Brothers exactly as it was on the Wii.
9532682	9533843	I love that art style.
9533943	9535044	I love the way it played.
9535104	9538826	The tablet integration looks fun if you happen to have a second person to play with.
9539907	9563148	but then Pikmin looked gorgeous and the new effects that they're they're not if they support 3D TV that's news to me but the fact that they were actually throwing things at the camera and what not and actually giving this serious spatial angle to it and not just a bird's eye corner view of it it just looked like it played marvelously well
9563348	9566890	All right, so it's the Nintendo stuff you love in HD.
9567410	9570111	But again, did you get your hands on the games?
9570151	9571132	Did you play any games?
9571332	9572633	Which ones stood out for you?
9573253	9575074	I played Super Mario Bros.
9575114	9580597	Wii U. Super Mario Bros.
9580637	9587620	Wii U, I played a couple of the games from Nintendo Land, and then I played, as far as I understand, pretty much a whole level of Rayman Legends.
9587640	9588501	Okay.
9589361	9599244	As I'm sure a lot of people know, Nintendo Land is mostly a series of minigames that are developed to really take advantage notably of the tablet but also give you a really good multiplayer experience.
9600344	9611947	The very first thing I did was play Luigi's Ghost Mansion playing the flashlight tag where the ghost is playing on the tablet and is invisible for the large part and then the four players with Wiimotes
9612347	9613468	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
9638485	9666947	but I just I can't really find the words for it other than the fact that it feels like it will be a more complete library than any other system launch that I've actually jumped into at the very start of it and then especially things like Zombie U and Batman Arkham City look absolutely stunning like I've played Mad World and yeah that's not supposed to be like the realistic graphics or anything but Arkham City and Zombie U looked absolutely fantastic this wasn't the...
9668208	9670553	Out of curiosity, have you played Arkham City on 360 or PlayStation 3?
9670594	9671014	Unfortunately, no.
9678021	9685783	See, and that's where I have to admit, not that I question your opinion, but I go, well, it looks beautiful on the other systems too, and it's been out for a year.
9686583	9701447	And it's not just about the graphics, but the fact that this is something that's going to be available at some point within the general launch window means that this is a big tier title that's going to be on Nintendo's system.
9701467	9703068	That a lot of people already own.
9703148	9704228	Because it came out last year.
9705020	9705480	Also true.
9706982	9708123	I absolutely will not deny that.
9708163	9729561	And like I was saying at the start of the call, I think a lot of people are going to paint a very negative picture of the Wii U after it comes out because it's not going to have the runaway success that the first Wii did because all of the casuals, all of the people that otherwise have never owned a gaming system won't see the reason to buy this
9731544	9747202	and so it won't sell it won't take off so ridiculously like the original Wii did but that's not a bad thing because this is Nintendo in my absolute opinion this is Nintendo making things better for gamers at large um
9747762	9765090	Project P100 is a very Pikmin-esque action game, which is great because there's finally a second game with that low army control mechanism, and it's set in a much more technological scene that a lot of people would prefer, I'm sure.
9768071	9772574	I have to admit, Jason, despite your enthusiasm, I'm not sure I'm completely sold.
9772954	9783559	It comes down to the games issue, and it's really about what... To be fair, to Nintendo's credit, it's kind of the same mistake as the Vita, too.
9784680	9791103	The Vita did come with a few kick-ass launch games, and there was certainly a lot to look forward to, but I don't know.
9791723	9796526	What's been delivered on hasn't exactly matched the hype, and this is all about the games department.
9797106	9826606	and it's kind of what I worry about with the Wii U as well because we haven't seen a lot past the launch window and you know there's not a lot to just really really get excited about because I played a lot of these Mass Effect 3 Arkham City on 360 and I'm not really interested in playing them again with tablet controls because it doesn't sound like it's going to change that much so I have to look to things like Nintendo Land and Pikmin 3 and New Super Mario Brothers Wii U and all this to pique my interest and it's just I'm not
9827186	9836650	I'm not as excited as, say, the hype behind the original Wii and how we felt about that Zelda game was a phenomenal launch.
9836690	9841952	I mean, has there ever been a better launch game for a console since the original Super Mario Bros.?
9842752	9845213	Certainly not one I've actually been there for.
9845293	9846554	Than Zelda for the Wii?
9846894	9851376	I mean, I guess I was just hoping for something of that magnitude and Nintendo Land ain't it.
9852791	9861279	The thing that really sets this apart, one of the feelings that I did come away with is that true to Nintendo's spirit, this stuff works.
9861739	9866483	A lot of the things that they were showcasing make it really compelling for local multiplayer.
9866623	9878394	Knock Nintendo's online services all you want, I'd completely agree with it, but having that second player, or in some cases that fifth player, to be able to take over controls with the tablet
9878994	9879375	and DarkSakura.
9894572	9907908	The Wiimote, or actually in this case it was the Pro Controller, whatever they're going to call it for the Wii U. The standard controller user is controlling Rayman, throwing shots, jumping, all that kind of thing, jumping on obstacles, attacking.
9908409	9909310	Where the tablet...
9909870	9911591	is manipulating the environment.
9911691	9913693	It's moving platforms around.
9913733	9930564	They had the whole rotation demonstration where you're walking, your Rayman's running through a maze and the person holding the tablet has to orient the level by turning the entire device in order to allow them to jump to the next ring, land on solid grounds, land not on spikes.
9931244	9940192	and the biggest thing that they showed off, as I said, was that with a second person, these games just got ridiculously more interesting.
9941192	9945496	Zombie U had this Capture the Flag... Not Capture the Flag.
9947557	9974713	the game mode where you have like three or five waypoints that you have to capture and defend and that kind of stuff and the player with the standard controller owned the TV and would attack zombies and was pretty much the one man army and then the person holding the tablet had like a real time strategy kind of interface where he could take hordes of zombies and send them to the particular waypoints and actually drill into this real time strategy that's
9975493	9975934	DarkSakura,
9991693	9995575	To Nintendo's credit, that could be an ace in the hole on September 13th.
9995956	10001479	We still don't know what Nintendo Network really is, despite the fact it's being branded on Nintendo cartridges.
10001959	10006882	That could be coming, and I'd be okay with that if there's a huge unveil on September 13th.
10007323	10011986	So I would wait on the online piece to be too critical about that until we have that event.
10012246	10017109	But if we still don't hear about it at that event, then it ain't coming with the release of the Wii U, and now we should be concerned.
10019210	10042085	Calls going a little long and that's okay Jason because we love you but I want to ask you one more question shaped off a chat comment we got here at live.vognetwork.com and ShadowNextGen in chat who's agreed with you in many ways and I saw it throughout Bobby's show tonight he kind of didn't he thought you know that what I was saying was kind of wrong and he's more supportive of the Wii U he sounds a lot like you and what you're saying
10042865	10051967	And he says, what this says to me is more people need to get actual hands-on time with the Wii U. So let me ask you this, Jason.
10052307	10055288	You've had hands-on time with the Wii U. I haven't.
10055468	10056208	Loki hasn't.
10056228	10057288	DarkSakura hasn't.
10058088	10062730	And you are clearly in love with this thing more so than us skeptics here.
10064730	10069051	What do you think you gain that we're missing having had hands-on time with the system?
10069571	10084080	See, and that's a really funny question I'll try to summarize in the fact that me and Ryan don't play a lot of the same games, and I'm hoping she's going to be interested in the aspects that are opened up with the simultaneous multiplayer of standard controllers and the tablets.
10084640	10085902	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10102162	10125169	that is killer and this is a fully fledged game that's not confined to a phone that has a limited amount of controls and you can do all sorts of media while giving the TV back to somebody else but for these Wii U optimized games where you have your hands on the tablet this is engaging somebody else at the same time usually in a completely distinct way you know what that also means?
10125449	10131431	That means both people get to play the game in two in times completely different methods
10132291	10139674	For all the replayability complaints that we complain about in modern gaming, this is two different ways to play the same game.
10140834	10143395	That's ridiculously cool to me.
10143975	10145876	I was sold on this system before I went to this event.
10145956	10147897	I had my hands on it.
10149337	10151418	I am 100% sold on this system now.
10152179	10153219	I will absolutely say that.
10153279	10155380	I am so with you up to a point, Jason.
10155600	10158781	I really do want to love this system.
10159081	10160242	I'll probably get one anyway.
10160282	10160782	Who are we kidding?
10161602	10162842	I mean, I've said that since day one.
10162922	10163783	It's your obligation for the show, right?
10163803	10167644	I'm skeptical as all hell, but I'll still fucking buy one because I'm a consumer whore.
10170545	10171845	God damn it, I lost my train of thought.
10171865	10174746	Where you don't is where you don't agree.
10174766	10175106	I found it.
10175186	10175646	No, here it is.
10175806	10176086	Here it is.
10177847	10180948	Where are the games that substantiate what you're saying?
10182628	10184289	I know you brought this up before.
10184789	10186710	Do you remember my list of games at the very start of the call?
10187390	10187590	Yes.
10188393	10193059	Do you know what the launch dates?
10193539	10197023	What games will be launched in the holiday window?
10197304	10199626	Pretty much everything that you named is in the holiday window.
10199686	10201709	And that's not enough to start a system?
10202735	10231596	um yes I when you when half your list is stuff that's already been out with a new method that again now we go back to the phone the iOS conversation about games that weren't developed for that system don't know I mean yeah okay so I'll have this tablet interaction but these games weren't designed with the tablet thing in mind they're kind of trying to shoehorn that stuff in there which is fine whatever show off the system but I'm not that I am not excited about Arkham City with the pad I'm not a
10232276	10235337	I am not excited about Mass Effect 3 with the touchpad.
10235477	10236618	Sorry, I'm not.
10236978	10239739	So, you know, that's half the games right off the table.
10240059	10241220	Now, my interest is piqued.
10241280	10244981	My eyebrow is raised a little bit at things like Zombie U, Pikmin 3.
10246342	10248103	I kind of consider New Super Mario Bros.
10248143	10248923	Wii at this point.
10249263	10253645	It's half rehash, half a successful formula just being done again.
10254225	10257326	But a couple games, no, it's really not enough.
10257446	10257967	Look at the 3DS.
10259491	10260351	Look at the 3DS.
10260772	10262212	I think they're making the exact same mistake.
10262312	10262752	I really do.
10262792	10263653	Look at the Vita launch.
10263713	10268675	I mean, they had a ton of games that a lot of them were original, and that still didn't help the system.
10268935	10270355	Yeah, and SSJ100Matt, thank you.
10270595	10271836	You fill in the gap here really well.
10272216	10274797	I want to know what's coming out after these launch window games.
10274897	10276958	What is Nintendo going to do to warrant this investment?
10277218	10279459	Because that's what console games are, investments.
10279739	10280940	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
10296932	10297532	Final thought?
10297873	10298073	Yes.
10298553	10300674	You are going to love Sing.
10301775	10306318	Provided the song list pans out and it's not more frickin' LMFAO.
10308639	10313422	Provided the song list comes up with some really good gems, you are going to adore Sing.
10313542	10315063	I can pretty much promise you that.
10316044	10317485	Will it be all ABBA songs?
10317505	10319646	Because otherwise Sing Star ABBA still has my heart.
10322267	10327448	The only songs they had were Shoop Shoop, Party Rock Anthem, and Call Me Maybe.
10327728	10329849	And they haven't really let on what else is going to be there.
10329929	10330429	Oh, God.
10330469	10331989	That's like my personal hell.
10332389	10332649	All right.
10333249	10334149	Those, sure.
10334189	10336730	Like I said, provided the song list is actually worth it.
10336830	10338130	And I have to hope it will.
10338170	10340631	Sing is going to be spectacular for parties.
10340711	10341771	Jason, I got to let you go.
10341831	10344291	Some of the chatters think you're a Nintendo salesperson in disguise.
10344311	10345551	I got to let you go.
10345972	10346232	All right.
10346252	10346732	Thanks, guys.
10346752	10347212	Have a good week.
10347372	10347932	You too, buddy.
10348032	10348332	Take care.
10349732	10350072	All right.
10350352	10351373	VXJ's next video.
10351413	10353353	We let his call go on a little long, but that's all right.
10353413	10354674	I mean, he was there.
10354714	10355534	He got hands on.
10355594	10356254	We're skeptics.
10356414	10356794	Whatevs.
10357774	10359355	Let's do like one more call.
10359375	10362776	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10363176	10366777	While we wait for those calls to come in, let me quickly see if I can do a Twitter topic here.
10368598	10371101	Tiger Claw, oh, links us on Twitter.
10372683	10377710	This is one that I read in the news that I forgot to mention on the show tonight, but it's important.
10378271	10381976	Uncharted film has burned through yet another director.
10383656	10384397	Epic Beatdown Otaku Style What?
10384417	10384517	Yes.
10414224	10417706	Okay, is it something you actually braved to try, or...?
10417907	10424011	Yes, it's an anime equivalent of Double Dragon meets Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, the game.
10424931	10425312	Wow.
10426633	10432156	And you can check out their plans on studionasu.com, which I am posting in the chatroom right now.
10434378	10441523	Pretty much, from what I understand, you're at Otakon, and you're just pretty much beating up on the fanboys, more or less.
10444361	10449223	And as somebody who goes to anime conventions quite frequently and all this stuff, how do you feel?
10450304	10452144	Hey, I'm all for it.
10452164	10455746	You talk to somebody at any given time who has a weapon on them trying to help somebody.
10456066	10457767	You gotta be able to laugh at yourself first.
10458367	10460068	I'll put in the weapons as a can of deodorant.
10461588	10470472	Well, one con actually put soap in their bags and people got pissed at that so they decided not to do it again, but that's besides the point.
10472384	10477368	Alright, did you just call to whore this con-going game, or what else is going on in your life, Ranma?
10477708	10479189	Yeah, that's more or less it.
10479289	10482312	Well, you know, we've already discussed New Super Mario Bros.
10482332	10484133	2, so my two cents on that doesn't really count.
10484774	10488377	Well, what is your... No, of course, every gamer has a voice.
10488637	10489698	Every gamer has a voice.
10489818	10490458	Use that voice.
10490518	10492240	You are Black Luigi, after all.
10492340	10495742	I want to know what Black Luigi thinks about Mario 2.
10496023	10497063	It's important, dammit.
10498124	10500266	I'm a Luigi, number one gaming star.
10502150	10506732	So what do you think about New Super Mario Bros.
10507032	10508053	2 on the 3DS?
10508793	10509294	It lacks.
10510534	10511895	Ooh, sick burn.
10511995	10512495	Why is that?
10513096	10513476	I don't know.
10514136	10521500	You know how you play a game and you just look at it like it's just lacking, and you can't put your finger on what it is, but it's just lacking something?
10522060	10527523	I mean, I like the fact they brought back the raccoon tail, so I'm thinking, oh yeah, Super Mario Bros.
10527843	10527523	3.
10528123	10529704	Ranma, is it originality?
10533568	10534589	I don't know.
10535950	10540493	It only has 85% of the feels.
10540733	10544156	I don't know if you listened to last week's show, Ranma, early on or whatever when I was talking about the game.
10544176	10546598	I caught the podcast because I was out last week.
10547578	10549380	Here was my whole thoughts on the game.
10549860	10552162	It's pretty much a formulaic Mario game.
10552662	10554203	But is that really such a bad thing?
10554844	10555765	No, not at all.
10556225	10559168	But this is what I think would have made the game better.
10559709	10566034	Now, you remember in Super Mario 3, you could travel all over the map area to go to different levels.
10566395	10571980	I understand you could do that in the new SMB2, but it's only part of the screen that it takes up.
10572220	10575883	It would have been nicer if it was the full screen that allows you to travel from the different levels.
10577074	10579797	I understand they brought back some of the music from SMB3.
10579857	10587944	They could have brought back something like the classic matching card games or matching up the Mushroom and the Fireflower for one-ups and stuff like that.
10588065	10591208	I liked the little giant glove that punched the one-ups.
10591428	10592909	That was kind of cute, actually.
10593209	10595291	Yeah, bring back Karibo's shoe.
10595311	10597513	Maybe it was me.
10597533	10600456	I was thinking it would be more like Super Mario Bros.
10600476	10601017	3, but better.
10603920	10604520	Well, I don't know.
10604600	10607242	I mean, I didn't dislike it by any means.
10607503	10610745	And when I write my VOG review, it'll probably be on the positive end of things.
10610845	10612507	But it's just, you know, I don't know.
10612547	10618232	There's just something I'm not as like, oh, my God, Irma Gerd about it as like previous Mario games.
10618292	10624037	Hey, Ranma, do you have a like a was an R4 or anything like that for your DS?
10624057	10624257	Yes.
10624795	10629338	Yes, and when you first mentioned a long time ago the new Super Mario Bros.
10629358	10633661	3 ROM hack, I went and downloaded it like 10 minutes after the podcast.
10634061	10635282	That game is hard as fuck.
10635502	10642146	That's what I'm saying though, but I mean, it's pretty awesome that they did all these original levels plus the levels from Super Mario Bros.
10642166	10647750	3 and that took some effort versus rehashing the same old shit again.
10648570	10649811	Yeah, I mean...
10650977	10655360	As I'm controlling the game, I'm not too fond of how they changed how you control Mario, but eh.
10657021	10657341	All right.
10657661	10659002	Ranma, I've got to wrap up and let you go.
10659022	10659742	Any final thoughts?
10663164	10663925	Actually, no.
10664565	10664845	All right.
10664885	10665486	Take care, buddy.
10666146	10666386	Later.
10666566	10666887	Bye.
10667747	10668728	I guess we can do one more call.
10668768	10669928	I've seen this one calling in.
10670569	10671489	We'll do one more call.
10671809	10672570	Here we go.
10672650	10673571	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10673591	10673891	Who's this?
10674557	10675837	This is Cody.
10676298	10676818	Cody!
10676998	10677718	What's up, Cody?
10678258	10678799	What's up?
10679439	10682520	I'm actually a first-time caller, long-time listener.
10682620	10684781	Alright, long-time listener, first-time caller.
10685061	10687482	I was going to say, I don't recognize this Skype picture.
10687542	10688202	I'm a very visual person.
10688222	10689082	But I like bow ties.
10689202	10690003	Bow ties are cool.
10690043	10691323	It's a very, very nice bow tie.
10691343	10693944	That looks like, did you tie that bow tie yourself on your picture?
10694364	10697546	That is actually, that is a Doctor Who brand bow tie.
10698387	10699087	Oh, see?
10699288	10699908	Very nice.
10700208	10701189	Do you also wear a fez?
10701369	10704431	You will fit in well here at the Voice of Geeks Network.
10704511	10705172	I do own one.
10705472	10705732	All right.
10706272	10707153	What's up, Cody?
10708014	10711896	I wanted to call, actually, first off, the whole Wii U thing, I'm kind of the same.
10713257	10714658	I'm on the fence about it as well.
10715299	10720823	About the only thing I use my Wii for right now is Netflix and Skyward Sword.
10720883	10722103	So, I mean...
10723888	10742502	and I really I've seen a lot of stuff going on with it different networks talking about it and you know everybody's just has kind of the same same take on it you know they just they need to play it they need to play it and not a lot of people get to play it and I think that's what somebody said in the chat is that not a lot of people
10742967	10746168	Get to play it, and they haven't had hands-on, so they don't know how it's going to work.
10746308	10752910	Well, yeah, Shadow Next Gen and VXChaseXV both are in chat now kind of talking it up because they both are like, you guys need to play it.
10752950	10754791	You guys need to do the hands-on experience.
10755711	10766275	And I'm sure as the announcements are made, as we get closer to launch day, we're going to start seeing those displays at Best Buys, Game Stops, yada, yada, so everybody can get their hands-on time.
10766375	10768736	But I don't know.
10768816	10769256	I still...
10770216	10771257	I'm highly skeptical.
10771778	10773199	That's not a bad thing.
10773219	10774259	It's not a bad thing.
10774880	10779883	I don't hate the Wii U. It's not a bad thing to question, especially after the 3DS launch.
10779963	10781685	I don't think it's a bad thing to be concerned.
10782165	10783386	I don't want the Wii U. Not at all.
10783846	10784607	Not at all.
10786188	10792172	I was excited about it, especially like you said, Zombie U. When I saw that, I was like, whoa, man, that looks like an amazing game.
10793813	10796375	I'm scared that it's going to be kind of like the Vita.
10796735	10798817	I believe Loki said something about...
10801058	10806740	The Vita had this huge launch of original games and everything, and it still didn't help it.
10807200	10811442	And I kind of think that that's the way that the Wii U is going to turn out.
10811502	10812042	But you know what?
10812082	10814363	We haven't seen it yet, and that's the thing.
10814403	10815224	We just have to wait.
10815884	10817465	And once we see it...
10818445	10819185	Then we'll know.
10819285	10821426	So, you know, I'm just waiting.
10822347	10822587	All right.
10822607	10824267	Did you say you have something else you want to talk about tonight?
10824287	10828469	Because you said that you got derailed by the way you talk, but was there something else on your mind?
10828869	10830230	I just wanted to throw that in there.
10830550	10833511	No, I wanted to say, I actually, I'm an Oklahoman.
10833531	10837712	I think you have a couple of Oklahoman callers, or listeners, actually.
10838253	10843695	And I was going to say that, I don't know if you guys heard about the Gearbox Community Day.
10843715	10845896	Yeah, I have heard about that.
10845936	10846976	I did hear about that, yeah.
10847734	10849475	I'm trying to go.
10849595	10855458	I want to go, and I actually want to videotape as much as I can, if they'll allow it.
10856379	10859341	But I'm a big Borderlands whore.
10859921	10868126	I play that game constantly, and I think it's because I love RPGs, and I love FPSs, but I suck at FPSs, and I'm good at RPGs.
10868506	10872008	So it kind of mixes the two together, and I think that's why I like it so much.
10872088	10872448	But yeah.
10872881	10874082	I don't know if you guys heard about that.
10875243	10878105	It looks like a really fun thing to go to.
10878125	10880746	I've never been to any kind of conventions or anything like that.
10882087	10883248	I'm pretty excited about that.
10883368	10884289	Where are they having this?
10884409	10885449	It's in Texas.
10886490	10890653	Texas, Dallas.
10891173	10892594	It's not just Borderlands 2.
10892994	10895756	It's also Aliens vs. Predators.
10895936	10897277	Was it Aliens vs. Predators?
10897377	10899799	I'm sorry, Aliens Colonial Marines.
10899839	10900840	Yeah, Colonial Marines.
10900920	10901220	That's right.
10902357	10920588	and then one more thing, I do know that Alan plays a lot, he's a big fan of Half-Life and I don't know if he's played this mod before and I really don't know how long this mod's been out but it's a Gary's mod and it's called Trouble in Terrorist Town
10922335	10925017	That doesn't sound familiar to me, but he's listening.
10925037	10926438	He's unfortunately not here in the house.
10926618	10933903	He's at work tonight, so I can't ask him in person, but he's listening, so he might pop up and chat or whatever, but it doesn't sound familiar to me.
10934583	10939746	If he hasn't played it, he needs to, because it is the... Oh my gosh, it's so fun.
10940187	10948792	It's the most fun of Gary's mod that I've ever had, just with the funny things that happen in the mod, with all the randoms that get thrown in.
10949133	10949613	If you don't have a
10950542	10956504	I'm going to grill you like I did the Wii U lovers.
10956664	10957045	Why?
10957125	10960586	Why is it so damn amazing?
10961066	10965268	I'm not really into a whole lot of multiplayer.
10965688	10969129	When it comes to FPSs and stuff like that, I don't really like that a lot.
10969957	10972179	I don't know, it might be because I'm really bad at them.
10972639	10975301	But this game, I don't know, it's really fun.
10975321	10980005	And it has a lot to do with, you have to figure out who's the traitor in your group.
10980325	10984688	There's a detective, a traitor, and then I think there's one more.
10984908	10985969	I can't even think of...
10986369	11007715	is that like the wolf game or the mafia game you know those those games that are popular on web forums and conventions and all that that's what kind of what it sounds like to me yeah i mean it's sort of like that sort of yeah but um but i mean it's really fun see if he wants to check it out i mean it's it's i think it's a i'm pretty sure it's a free mod obviously uh but uh uh but uh yeah check it out i mean i i've
11008553	11012035	Go on YouTube, look up all these different gameplays of it.
11012115	11013676	It's just so hilarious.
11014377	11015697	All right, I'll make them check it out.
11015917	11016558	Sounds great.
11017078	11021581	All right, well, Cody, thanks so much for calling in to the show tonight.
11021601	11022261	I appreciate it.
11022441	11024623	And yeah, call in anytime.
11025283	11034808	No problem, and you know, I was actually, I had a tweet last week telling you guys about a Borderlands 2 giveaway, and I don't know if I remember.
11034968	11036069	Oh, that was you!
11036089	11036429	It is me!
11036469	11037329	Yeah, it was you!
11037730	11038250	Okay.
11038810	11042332	I was an idiot and didn't link the freaking YouTube video.
11042392	11043713	Alright, plug away.
11045775	11047796	I actually have a small gaming channel on YouTube.
11047836	11048577	It's not huge.
11049098	11050459	I don't get paid for it or anything like that.
11050499	11052561	I just enjoy gaming and showing people my games.
11053041	11054002	It's what we're doing here.
11054182	11056484	It's the exact same thing we do here, except we're audio.
11058932	11060874	And my channel is just funny commentary.
11061654	11064736	But yeah, I'm giving away a copy of Borderlands 2.
11064957	11069920	I mean, it's any platform out there that's going to be out.
11069960	11073943	PC, PS3, 360, Steam, any of that.
11075004	11075825	But yeah, it's...
11077046	11080450	Actually, my YouTube channel is linked in my Skype.
11081592	11082633	But I can say it on here.
11082693	11085357	Yeah, you better say it because it'll take me too long to bring it up.
11085397	11085797	So go ahead.
11086318	11087179	Spell it or whatever.
11087299	11093007	It's www.youtube.com backslash ctaylor1785
11095740	11099201	SeeTaylor1785 SeeTaylor1785 You know, I gotta be honest, buddy.
11099221	11104302	You wanna get some more hits on your YouTube channel, you're gonna have to come up with something really catchy.
11104322	11112045	1785's hard to remember, so... Well, it was kind of funny, because I came up with the YouTube channel a long time ago, but never did anything.
11112385	11113525	And so now I can't change it.
11113805	11116026	And now my channel's called Codeman Games.
11116506	11117406	Okay, that's good.
11117826	11118186	That's good.
11119086	11122667	How about, like, Tailored Games or something silly?
11122727	11123108	I don't know.
11123468	11124208	Yeah.
11124928	11130212	But the video, if anybody's wanted, the video is called, I believe it's called That Robot Has a Temper.
11130272	11134715	I actually have a cell phone call with Claptrap and he's like cussing and all this different stuff.
11134735	11135396	So it's pretty fun.
11135876	11140239	And yeah, but just tell me, you know, if they want a free copy, you know, just send them on over.
11140639	11141080	All right.
11141440	11143842	Poor people who love Borderlands.
11144102	11144482	I'm poor.
11146030	11147191	I got a four month old.
11147531	11149852	You're not that poor if you're giving away a copy of Borderlands 2.
11150312	11151173	No, I think that's great.
11152213	11156095	I fully support the indie press in all forms, so go check that out everybody.
11156575	11159217	Alright, good luck with your YouTubes and we'll talk to you in a later week, okay?
11159995	11160515	Thank you, Rob.
11160555	11161335	I appreciate it.
11161395	11162075	No problem.
11162115	11162536	Take care, buddy.
11162556	11163396	You too.
11163716	11163916	Bye.
11187270	11187530	All right.
11187650	11188711	Platinum for me.
11189811	11190092	All right.
11190572	11191512	For the bow tie.
11191532	11192073	For the bow tie.
11192253	11192813	Yeah, that's true.
11192833	11193753	The bow tie was pretty awesome.
11193773	11193974	All right.
11194254	11196735	That's going to do it for the Skype calls tonight.
11196875	11198616	If you didn't get through, don't be mad.
11199416	11200057	Send tweets.
11200277	11203058	You know, Tiger Claw is like the only one that's been sending tweets this week.
11203138	11205600	So you can either send tweets or you can send us an email.
11205680	11207741	Mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com.
11208081	11210482	Speaking of Tiger Claw's tweets, I did want to get through these real quick.
11211162	11213362	Uncharted and the director changeover.
11214123	11216123	David O. Russell had been on there.
11216183	11217763	He had made the movie I Heart Huckabees.
11218064	11219264	Well, he's not there anymore.
11219304	11220624	Neil Berger left the project.
11221284	11222665	Who is on the project now?
11223785	11228626	The writers of National Treasure, Marianne and Cormac Wiberly.
11229546	11230927	God, I hate Nicolas Cage.
11232087	11235450	It's like I have no frame of reference because I refuse to see those movies.
11235490	11235851	You know what?
11236471	11238152	The only good thing he did was Raising Arizona.
11238473	11241095	They seem topical enough.
11241175	11241555	I don't know.
11242136	11244798	I guess I could see a movie like that leading to Uncharted.
11244858	11245979	But all right.
11246359	11247200	So there you go.
11249282	11249782	Let's see.
11250443	11256708	Oh, Neil Berger directed Limitless and he left and then he had replaced somebody else.
11257188	11258790	So who's directing it now?
11260356	11261636	Out of all the bad news we've had tonight...
11278638	11280118	I like a little bit of good news.
11280438	11282059	So thank you, Tigerclaw, for sending this.
11282439	11285740	And I think this is a good note to end on tonight, although Loki may have last-minute stories.
11286080	11287180	Actually, no, I want to end on this.
11287260	11288901	Loki, do you have any last-minute stories before I get to this?
11289721	11292942	Eh, some MMOs stole a map from Counter-Strike.
11293142	11294062	That's all we need to know.
11294222	11294582	Big deal.
11295442	11295723	Alright.
11297683	11298184	Here you go.
11298304	11299205	A nice thing to end on.
11299225	11299985	Thank you, Tigerclaw.
11300366	11307472	Microsoft is throwing an industry mixer for the folks from OnLive who are affected by the restructuring.
11308473	11313838	They are scouting for Xbox-oriented positions for Mountain View, California and Redmond, Washington.
11314378	11316619	A quote from Microsoft on the public invitation.
11316959	11321341	We are eager to speak to individuals and teams affected by the on-live transition.
11321721	11327763	We are looking to add key players who want to make a real impact in creating groundbreaking new products and services.
11328583	11332705	I got to say, what a great way to answer Sony getting Gaikai.
11333465	11336246	Just hire the old on-live employees for your company.
11336426	11336946	Sounds good.
11337266	11338087	Amazing.
11338347	11338747	Amazing.
11339087	11340848	Oh, DarkTest Studio sent in a late tweet here.
11341880	11344981	I finished updating the wiki with recently found episodes.
11345421	11347702	So Dark Tetsuya doing a wiki update.
11347962	11349003	Thank you, Dark Tetsuya.
11349623	11351563	Thank you, fans, for updating that wiki.
11351583	11352364	You guys are amazing.
11352444	11359106	OrangeLoungeRadio.wikia.com You guys make sure that I don't repeat games.
11360427	11361507	You use it as a source.
11361527	11362707	I use it all the time.
11362767	11364288	It impacts what we do here on the show.
11364625	11365586	DarkSakura, start us off tonight.
11365606	11366326	I don't want to go to bed.
11366346	11367066	Loki, your final thought tonight.
11367146	11367467	I don't know.
11367487	11368667	I want to wear this shirt to work.
11389915	11390416	I'm going to.
11390876	11391516	All right, you should.
11392197	11400785	My final thought is, because I neglected to say it at the start of Part B as I planned to, I do want to say rest in peace to Neil Armstrong.
11401506	11405609	But what an amazing life to have actually gone to the moon.
11405689	11407471	I mean, that's something we all dream about as kids.
11407831	11409012	And, like, he actually did it.
11409132	11411655	So, yes, it's unfortunate that he passed.
11412015	11413697	But let's not focus on the fact he died.
11414017	11415458	Let's focus on the fact that, like...
11416599	11420482	Like, he did something that all of us dream about, and I think that's just amazing.
