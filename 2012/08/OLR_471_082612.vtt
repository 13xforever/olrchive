00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, August 26th, 2012

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
More unfortunate layoffs hit the industry

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
A company requests its game be pulled from store shelves

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
And are 90% of PC game installs pirated copies?

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000

Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
That's where you can participate with our show

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
In the chat room

Live.vognetwork.com

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
This is episode number 471

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
For this August 26th, 2012

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
My name is Rob Roberts

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
And I'll be joining you over the next few hours

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
To talk about what is going on with the game industry

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
With my friends

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Hi

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
How are you?

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
I feel vaguely fit

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
You feel fit?

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Vaguely

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
You feel pretty and witty and...

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Hey

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Well I don't know, everyone a little gay

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
That's good, it's good to feel healthy

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Cause I've had days where I feel healthy

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
And I've had days where I feel fat

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
You know, and sometimes a fat day is good too

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
Once in a while, but healthy is a good feeling too

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Well it was just like

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
My intention is to walk a few days each week

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
And I decided to go walking

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
But I don't know if I've said it on the show before

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
But I wear Vibram Five Fingers

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Which are like the toe shoes

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
You wear the glove shoes

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
They're awesome

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
You make your feet look like hands

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
They're creepy

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Well but it makes your feet walk how you're supposed to walk

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
It makes you look like Spiderman

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Well it's how people are supposed to walk is the thing

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Is that our, not to go too deep into it

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
But our modern tennis shoes

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Have changed the way people walk for the worse

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
You know, that's where a lot of injuries come about

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
And I'm really getting back to the barefoot walking thing

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Like hands, they're...

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Sorry, sorry for the echo

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
And I really love them

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
But it makes me think more and more that

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Humanity is not meant to walk on concrete

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
Concrete is terrible, terrible, terrible stuff

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
And so my feet did not hurt until I walked on concrete

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
When I walked on the grass, no more hurt

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
But it was a good walk

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
It was a good walk

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
I got outside

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Outside

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Going outside is good

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Everybody should put down the controller or the keyboard

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
And go outside once in a while

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
However

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
What?

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
I was listening to the Mass Effect soundtrack

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
That's how you can make your worlds collide

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
There you go

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Alright, by the way, I apologize

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
One of the perks about listening live to Orange Launch Radio

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Is that you can check into the show live

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
The check-ins are now up

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
I forgot to do that because I was sidetracked

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
During the pre-show

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
And I literally sat down seconds before

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
I picked up the microphone and went live

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
So the check-ins are now up

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
There you go

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
For those of you listening on the podcast

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
You can also check in

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Just listen for a little noise

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
The little victory sound

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
And then it'll tell you the passphrase

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
It is somewhere in the show

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
We have to make sure you're listening to it

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
So it's somewhere different in the show every week

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Anyhow, also say hello to

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
What?

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Damn it, that song is in my head now

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
The song from An American Tail

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
That's somewhere out there

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Is that what the check-in noise sounds like?

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
No, when you said somewhere

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
I was like

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
That song is stuck in my head

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
I haven't thought of that song in years

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Damn it, Rob

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
I'm sorry

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
I don't know what to tell you

03:49.000 --> 03:55.000
I was gonna play this really quick here

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
If I can find it here

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
I don't know if you've heard this, Darkstalker

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
I know you don't listen really back to the podcast

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Because you're on it

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
So you don't have to

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
But this is a little noise

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Now, this is not the actual noise

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
But this is it

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Isn't that kind of catchy, right?

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Yeah

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Now that's gonna get stuck in your head right there

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
That's a little Bobby Black Wolf original right there

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
Um, it's like, I have an idea

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Okay

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Let's introduce Loki

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Techmaster Loki is here tonight too

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Hi

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
How are you doing, Loki?

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
I'm full now

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
You're full?

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Yeah, because I

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Full of rage

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
I know

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
I bought one of the Memphis barbecue burgers over at Carl's Jr. Hardee's

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
That is drenched in barbecue sauce

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
I normally get the single

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
And the single is normally enough

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
I haven't eaten really today

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
So I was like, okay, I'll go with the $6 burger

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
I really should have just stuck with the single

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
The single is enough

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
But it's delicious

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
And what makes it delicious is the fact that it combines

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Not only a cheeseburger, but pulled pork

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
So you've got barbecued pulled pork

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
And a cheeseburger with more barbecue sauce on it

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
And onion rings

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
It's fantastic

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Delicious

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
I like their Western burger

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Western bacon or whatever

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Yeah, that's not really what I get

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
But remember we just had this discussion about healthy days

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
And fat days

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
If I have one of those, I'm definitely having a fat day

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Because they are not good for you

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
That's how I discovered it

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
Because I normally don't go to Carl's Jr. that much

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
Because it's further away from my work than normal

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
The other fast food places

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
So I was like, I'm tired of eating McDonald's or Burger King

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
I'm just going to go to Carl's Jr. today

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
And so I went there to get the Double Western

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
And I saw that they had this burger

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I'm like, hey, I like pulled pork

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I'm going to get a single

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Because I'm not that hungry

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
And it was delicious

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
You know, I swear I don't have delusions or anything

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
That our show is that big in the scope of things

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
We don't have a whole ton of ton of listeners

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Though we do love the family we have

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
That comes participates with us live in the podcast

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
But it would be great if somebody deemed our audience

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Large enough to get a food sponsorship

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
With as much as we talk up the different foods

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
We need to start censoring all the food titles

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
We're going to go get yogurt after the show at

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
No, instead what you do is

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Instead of doing the beep

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
You add like a sound file that says nom

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
So every time you talk about

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Yeah, I totally had that burger at nom nom nom nom

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
Get the little kitty nom nom nom

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Yeah, but then you're talking about editing

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
That's why I like to do live radio

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Because it doesn't involve editing

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
If you haven't noticed

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
I also like to do live radio

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Because we have the chat room

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
At live.vognetwork.com

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
And Bobby, in reference to me playing the theme

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
A little bit before said

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Now people are going to think that the check-ins

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Are happening that early

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Well, gotcha

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
I just want to make sure everybody was paying attention

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
So like the people that just

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
The people that are kind of just doing data entry

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
In the background and zoning out and all that

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Now that I have your attention

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
Watermelons

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
Anyway, let's see, also

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
What are the other comments in chat

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Oh, Tigerclaw said you can use that sound

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
When there's breaking news

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
But then we can't jack the NBC breaking news theme

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Which is so epic

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
It is epic

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
You know, as much as people hate NBC

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
After the Olympics and all that crap

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
You have to admit

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
NBC gets some epic fucking music

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
For their presentations

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Like, you know, the Olympic theme

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
That shit is epic

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
And I realize John Williams did that

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Not some NBC dude

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
I played that in high school band

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
And didn't you feel epic?

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
We can start stealing

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Especially since I played saxophone

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
And got the little

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
You know

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
We can start stealing the Game of Thrones theme

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
I mean, that's pretty epic too

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Or like, you know

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
No chair of swords allowed

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
But the theme's awesome, okay

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Separate from the whole

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
If you want awesome

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
We should just use the Xena theme

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Yeah

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
No, that's if we want the show to have lesbian undertones

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
I have no problem with this

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Maybe in a future week

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
How do you have lesbian undertones

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
When there's two men and a woman?

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
I'm not sure how that works

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
She's double lesbian

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
I like boobs too

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
You'll have to like your own boobs though

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Unless we get some lady callers later

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Which is always a distinct possibility

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
When we take live calls from our

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Should I ask everyone about their boobs?

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Do you want to have booby chat tonight with the callers?

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
No, thank you

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
I don't know if any of our women

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Would call in to do booby chat

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Well, Sil would totally do it

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
But the show's on too late for her

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Because she's on the other side of the pond

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
And they're eight hours ahead of us

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
If you have to stay up anywhere in the UK

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Really, no matter where you're at

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Britain, Scotland, Ireland

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
I know we have listeners in all those places

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
And what time is the show live here?

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
I miss our Swede

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
2 AM

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
I miss our Swedes

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Yeah, we had a couple folks in Sweden

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
I did see, I don't know if you've looked at email

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
But we do have an email from Belgium tonight

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
I love Belgium!

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Me too

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
I love waffles

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Such an ignorant statement

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
There is so much more to Belgium than just waffles

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
There is not, that is not an ignorant statement

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
I love waffles, okay?

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
It just reminded me

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
There's nothing, alright

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Belgium also has wonderful chocolate

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Alright, usually we do a kickoff topic at the start

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Beer

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Usually we do a kickoff topic at the start of the show

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
I actually don't have a whole lot tonight

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Beer

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
What?

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Beer

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
It should be beer

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
I want to ask this question

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
We have a long weekend next weekend

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
And it's very likely we probably won't end up doing OLR next weekend

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
We'll have to talk about that during the break tonight

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
But Bobby's not going to be here

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
DragonCon's going on next weekend

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Because a lot of the cool kids at VOG Network

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Like Travis and Brad from Pod Culture

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
And some of the dudes from Critical Myth and all them

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
They're all going to DragonCon

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
In Atlanta

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
That is going on

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Penny Arcade Expo is also going on at the same time

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
And it's Labor Day weekend

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
So I don't know, we may take the weekend off to

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
You know, just chill

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
And sit around and play video games

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
And Pinkberry

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
And I'm wondering

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
And Pinkberry

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
I'm wondering if there's any video games

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
You really need to catch up on

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
That if we have a three day weekend

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
To just sit in your underwear on the couch

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
With a giant

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
What is that, how did Grandpa describe it on Horde House

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
The other show

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
I'm sitting there in my boxers in my big thing of Pinkberry

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Just playing video games or whatever

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
What video games do you need to be catching up on right now

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Because we're about to enter the holiday season

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
And a shit ton of new games

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
What games do you want to spend your Labor Day weekend

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Catching up on

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
I propose to my husband of marathoning

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Super Mario World

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Super Mario World

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
However, I also just proposed to Becky

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Of marathoning Mass Effect 2 on Saturday

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
You do that anyway

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
No, I play Mass Effect 3 for me

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Which means I have to finish it

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Before we finish Mass Effect 2 for her

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
So that I can play through Mass Effect 3 while she watches

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
You know what would be fun, actually you should try this

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Jamie is

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
Marathoning ROM hacks for Mario Brothers

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
That would be awesome

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
I would scream so much

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
Well not necessarily the ones that are insanely hard

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
But just the new ones

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
They have some really good ROM hacks

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
That and Link to the Past has some really good ROM hacks

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
I'm like

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
I kind of want to play those because it's different

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
It's like going into Link to the Past

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
For the first time again

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
And it's kind of cool, that sounds really cool to me

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
Except the whole thing is actually breaking out the systems

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
And playing

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
The other thing that we had, we actually just watched a whole

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
Dan and I watched a whole play through of Vampire Killer on MSX

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
Which came out after the Castlevania that we got on the NES

11:41.000 --> 11:47.000
But it sort of inspired me to want to actually play through Dracula X again

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
It sort of sounded like a classic gaming weekend

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Sounds like fun

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Plus Mass Effect

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
Maybe it would also be a fun weekend to go out to the flea markets around

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
And try to find some more classic games

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Let's do it

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
And then

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
If it's not 105

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
And then

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
No and then

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
And then

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
No and then

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Farmers Market

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
No and then

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Mexican Candy

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Loki got it

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Dude, where's my car?

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Loki

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
What do you need to catch up on over the long weekend?

12:15.000 --> 12:21.000
Honestly, what I've been trying to do is stop doing modding stuff

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
Because I have people that ask me for Grand Theft Auto mod stuff

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
They're like, I can't port my map mods over, can you do it for me?

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
I'm like, so waste a whole fucking week doing that shit

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
And it just gets so tiring

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Because I'm like, I don't want to do this

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
But yet for some stupid reason they keep saying yes, I'll do it for you

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
So I'd like to just not do that and actually play games

12:41.000 --> 12:46.000
But at the same time, I don't really know what games I'd want to play

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
I want to play Minecraft on 360 with other people

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
But there's no one on

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
There's a way to burn an entire weekend

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Seriously, but there's nobody to play with

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
That's the thing

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Although I do have one of the people that's on my friends list

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
He keeps wanting to play, but it's always when I'm on break at work

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
I'm like, dude, I can't play with you right now

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Because I'm going to have like five minutes and that's it

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Because I'll be on my 360 during break

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
But there's no one to play with

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
I really wish that Minecraft on the 360

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
Had an option to randomly connect you to a server

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
That has, okay, allow strangers to connect

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Or something like that

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
Or have that option where I can allow strangers to connect to my server

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
Granted, you run the risk of someone going through and griefing and stuff

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
But you can always ban them

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
And I would just kind of like that

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
So I'd be able to play with random people

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
And actually get a multiplayer game going

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
It's kind of boring with just one or two people

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
Because we've been playing, we actually started yet another world

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
And we actually picked the tutorial world this time

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Which is kind of fun

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Because it made it a little more interesting

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
Because there's actual things built in, little hidden things to find

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
And you can, you know, you didn't have to worry about right away

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
Okay, I need to find stuff to make sticky pistons

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Oh, I'll just steal some out of the stuff that's already built

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Which is kind of cool

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Or hey, you know, I need to go find some diamonds

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
So they can make some diamond armor and stuff

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Oh wait, I know where the hidden thing is

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Where there's some diamond stuff

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
So that's kind of cool

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Or I'm gonna need some wood

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
So I'm gonna just tear down this house instead of those already built

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
And so that was kind of fun

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
For a little bit

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
And then it got boring again

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
And that's the problem

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
It's just, it's so far behind

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
The PC version that it's kind of boring

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
Whereas like I'm reading about like the cool PC stuff that they're adding now

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
And like the kind of snapshots for each week

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
And it sounds pretty awesome

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Like they're adding all this new stuff

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
Like new monsters that look really fucking hard to kill

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
I mean that would be really cool in the 360 version

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
But it's just not there

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
So I guess I have to start playing the PC version since I bought it

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
That would be kind of fun

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Maybe I should do that

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
But once again, I need people to play with

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
And, you know, I don't want to play with random strangers

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
Are you upset that I haven't been signing onto Xbox lately?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Is that what this is all about?

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Well just everybody

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
No one is

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
I mean like seriously, I can't

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
I launch Minecraft almost every single day

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
There's no one on, ever

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
So

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
That reminds me of WoW

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
But yeah, I mean like that

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
That's going to start picking up real soon though with the expansion

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
I mean if I want to go

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
I'm not really trying to get into any games right now

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Like any, start anything new

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
Because Borderlands 2 is coming out

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
And I know that's going to be, you know, big time drain right there

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
That'll probably be the one game I play

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
Until Call of Duty Black Ops 2 I think

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
Let's go to some comments from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
SSJ100Matt says

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I know what Loki can do during the break

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Update the OLR PSP site

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
That's not going to happen

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
But much like, so much like

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
It's time to start on the PSV

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
OLRPSV.com that doesn't exist yet

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
But

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
I don't want to do that

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
I know

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
No one cares anymore

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
OLR3DS.com not happening

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
No

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
OLRWEU.com

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
See the problem is

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
I mean now all these things have web browsers

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
And hopefully they all support HTML5

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
And so that's not even an issue anymore

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
You can just go to our site

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
At vognetwork.com and

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Just listen

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Without having to, you know

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
One thing we do need to look into doing

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Though at some point is

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Remaking the OLR.com site

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Because now we kind of have

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
A lot of our forum resources

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
And community resources are pouring in

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Trying to pool together with the other shows

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
To make vognetwork.com bigger

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
OLR.com was probably more about us

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
And our history and our shows and so forth

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
So it would be fun to have something for that

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
You know

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
It would, to me, I mean

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
I think it would be kind of cool like how we

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Had on the all games

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
While back where it was just

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
A section of the website, it's like okay

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Here's the Orange Launch Radio section, like there's a section

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
For each show and just have it linked to that

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
And just, you know, make something cool there

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
On our own site, on VoG

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
So we don't have to like, because we have

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Forums already, you know, the forums

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
And the Orange Launch site are kind of dead

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
I mean we can just

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
They're technically supposed to be closed by now

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Because we're going to fold them into the VoG network

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
So that's what I'm saying, it's like

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Just kind of erase the site

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
And just, because we were already kind of

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Doing everything that we were doing on that site

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Anyways, on VoG

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
So just kind of move it over

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
If you have ideas, we'd love to hear a mailbag

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
At orangelaungeradio.com

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
And some of the folks in chat room were talking about apps

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
And so forth

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
I have to learn how to program

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
As soon as I learn how to make apps, I know somebody

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
That makes apps, but they have other priorities

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
I almost

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Signed up for

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Another Kickstarter that had

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
A thing on how to make apps

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
And it looked really cool, but I'm like

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Am I really going to sit here and do this?

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
You're addicted to Kickstarter

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Alright, let me get some other answers here

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
That one took us on a tangent

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
How about Locopoco, which I love that name

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Because it's like Locoroco's cousin

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Locopoco says, I need to catch up on

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Folklore, Resonance of Fate

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
And Valkyria Chronicles, those are all excellent choices

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Valkyria Chronicles is one of my

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Personal ones too, we've had that on PS3

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
I don't know how long, and I've yet to make a lot of progress

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
In that game, but it's really fun

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Tigerclaw says, in reality

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Sky just wants to go to Disneyland again

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
LOL, in regards to the week off

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
A, if I was going to Disneyland, I would not

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Do it on Labor Day weekend, because that would be a mad house

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
B, I was actually

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Supposed to be there tonight, I was originally

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Planning a trip that would have had

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Alan and I there, well we would have been driving

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Tonight, I would have not been at the show

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Tonight, been there Monday, Tuesday, but

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
We had to cancel that

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Rob, not and I, and me

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
It's an object

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
No one Kern, alright

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Moving on

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Let's see, oh, and lastly

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
In reference to the mental image

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
I put in all your heads earlier

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
VxjasonxV in our chat room says

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Oh, and now that underwear is involved

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Video live stream

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Y'all are perverts

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
I would love to do a live stream

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Not of that, of the games

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
It's technology

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Well, I do want to do

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Live streaming stuff, I have

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
About two or three

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Capture cards, capture devices

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Set that crap up over here, we can do that

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
It's just, it's a little bit

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
More complicated, like I always watch

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
The playthroughs like

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Freddy Wong, they've been doing

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
They've been doing a land game

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
On PC, Minecraft, and it looks so much

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Fun, playing with other people

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
It's just like, okay, everybody gets one life

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
And we're just gonna work together

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
And we're gonna do this stuff and then they just kind of

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Film it and edit it together and it looks fun

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
I'm like, I just want to do that

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
I want to play with those people

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
I did not, you got me sidetracked

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Though, because in reference to the

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Comment that Jason made, now that underwear

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Is involved, video live stream, I

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Had the chance to play my favorite Tyra Banks

19:39.000 --> 19:59.000
Clip that I haven't played on the show in years

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
You know, that's gonna be my Labor Day

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Weekend right there, panty party

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
You know, my wife, ever since

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
The passing of Whitney Houston has kind of

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Latched on to Tyra Banks instead

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
I've noticed

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Kind of like

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Kind of observing the

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Train wreck that's happening, cause you know

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Whitney Houston, well she used to like

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Watching Whitney Houston's Facebook page

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Because there's a lot of stupid people that comment on there

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
But Tyra's page

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Tyra comments on

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Post a lot of really stupid things

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
And it's funny

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
I mean, this has absolutely nothing to do with

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Video games, but this is kind of a game

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
In itself, and it has to do with Facebook

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Which is, you know, big for gaming, right?

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
This is hilarious

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Go to various fast food

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
And chain restaurants

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
And just go to the thing that lets you see

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
What everybody's posting on there

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
And I'm not even talking like the controversial shit

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Like Chick-fil-A, like go on

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Facebook and look up like the Olive Gardens

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Page, Red Lobster

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Applebee's

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
You will see some amazing

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Shit that people post on those

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Pages, everywhere from

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Complaints about a particular restaurant

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
To, you know, somebody

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Making a post like

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
So-and-so just took me here to Applebee's

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
For my anniversary, I'm so excited

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
There's a picture of them smiling like

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Cause people don't understand privacy

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Controls

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
That just makes me think of a line from one of my favorite

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Comics, Henry Cho, who's not related

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
To Margaret Cho, although he is Korean

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Born in Tennessee

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Saying, talking about his

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Brother-in-law from Arab

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Alabama

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Good times

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
We just got a new Italian restaurant

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
It ain't no Olive Garden

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
I can't help but be reminded

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Of that 86 year old

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Lady or whatever that reviewed restaurants

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
For the local paper and she wrote that huge review

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
About the Olive Garden

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
I don't know where that, she was like in Montana

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Or maybe Wisconsin, one of those northern states

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
And was writing about the local Olive Garden

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
That shit was hilarious

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
With the buttery breadsticks

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Alright, alright, quickly

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
My weekend, my plans

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
For the weekend, I think it would be really fun

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
To do an epic Civ 5

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Match that goes all weekend

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Long, but I don't know if I can find

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Any other suckers that would buy into that

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
And there's someone who plays on Xbox, but I don't think he plays online

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Yeah, but that's

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
The Xbox one is different, cause that's the Civ

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Revolution and those games can go a lot faster

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
You can do one of those in a night, but I'm talking like

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Civilization 5 epic mode

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Although that would, that game would take

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Like months to finish, but you could even

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
Do just even a normal game

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Takes forever in Civilization 5

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
That would be fun

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
DayZ would be fun too, once, like

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
I guess that's going back to games

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
That would be fun to do like a live stream of

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Actually, live streaming PC games might

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Well, that might be, it's still difficult

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
But yeah, DayZ would be fun

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Hey, oh my god, zombies

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Here we go

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Crazy person

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
The other game I really need to catch up on is

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Borderlands

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
But let's be real

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
There's so much happening on Tuesday between

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
The official launch of Guild Wars 2

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
The patch in Warcraft

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Rock Band Blitz

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Mass Effect 3 DLC

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
There's no way I'm playing catch up over the weekend

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Cause I have to play everything that came out on Tuesday

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
That's the problem

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
You don't really need to play through Borderlands 1 anyways

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Because they just kinda, all they have

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
The characters have cameos

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
And that's about it, but

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
I just wanna play it cause I was having fun with it

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
And I just stopped because of my MMOs

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
And other games I was playing

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Oh yeah, Alan has it too

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
There you go

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Bobby's the one to play too

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
There we go, the foursome

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
Alright, let's talk about our actual gaming weeks

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
The stuff we have been playing this week

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
More current stuff, yeah

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Can I say one more thing about the week in general

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Of course

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
I did a good deed this weekend

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
We rescued a kitten from the dumpster

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Outside my synagogue

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Now, before people start crying

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
You found out nobody left the cat in the dumpster

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
He was feral

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Little faith in humanity restored

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Yeah, he was feral

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
He fell in looking for food

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
I sat him in my lap, he clawed the crap out of me

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
And then calmed down

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Got him some water, got him some food

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
A nice lady downtown

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
He was taken care of by a lady downtown

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
And he's going to Animal Outreach

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
On Monday

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Where they're gonna get him shot

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Tested for leukemia

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Fixed and adopted out

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
So I just wanted to say for anyone who's asked

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
The kitty's story has a happy ending

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Yay, meow meow

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
His official name is Donut

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
They've called him Donut

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Instead of Batcat

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
That's a good name, I like Donut

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
I'm just glad I don't have those cats in our backyard anymore

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
11 cats at one time

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
All I know is I got a text message from Dark Soccer

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
On Friday night, do you want a kitten?

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
And I'm like, um

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
We have a tiny ass apartment and two cats already

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
I would love

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
to, but no

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Yeah, Shermy would be too old for me to have a little feral kitten in the house

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
To tame

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
He's only six weeks old, so he's tammable

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Alright, before we get into our regular gaming weeks

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
And what we have been playing

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
I do want to talk to the chatters

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
WhatupG leaves a comment about Tuesday

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Saying Sky forgot the biggest

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
game release, Madden 13

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Although certainly I will acknowledge

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
That will be a huge game release

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
And lots of people are going to be playing that over the Labor Day weekend

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
My household won't be one of them

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Cause we just, that's not really a series

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
We've ever gotten into

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
I'm not a big football person

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
And if you're not a fan of that, and for whatever reason you just

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Don't download games off the Playstation

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
There's a Journey collector's edition coming out this week

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
On disc

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
It's got the soundtrack, you get Journey

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Flower of Flow

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
And also two

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Little quick games that they made

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
And a month of Playstation Plus

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
That's a great deal if

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
You don't have any of those games

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Cause all three of those games are great

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Well, I don't even know if you could call

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Flow a game, but whatever

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
It's alright

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
They're neat, but Journey is

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Amazing

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Contender for game of the year to be honest

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Alright, not that Journey

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
It's a Journey 2012 Journey

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
That might make it a little bit better if it had Journey music in there

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
But their music was pretty good

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Little mishmash, I'm sure somebody's done that on YouTube

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Journey set to Journey? I've seen it

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
But the music in Journey 2012

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Is legitimately really good

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Like, as much as I love Journey

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
1980's

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
You can't do that

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
To Journey 2012

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
The music in Journey 2012 is so flippin' good

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Can we get a Journey 2012

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
2 where it's basically

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
The premise of Revolution X

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
But with Journey

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Instead, you know

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
Wouldn't that be kinda cool?

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
Dude on the toilet at the beginning of the game

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
If Steve Perry was talking to any of the others

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Whatsoever, maybe

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Although, well, the guy they have now

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
The guy they have now, number one, is hot

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Number two, has really nice hair

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
And number three, can sing

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Don't get me wrong, he's really good

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
And he can sing, and yes, I have seen Journey live recently

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
When he was the front man, they were really good

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
I know, but

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
I mean, I don't know

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
There's something about, you can't put a Journey

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
80's sequel in arcades

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
And not have Steve Perry involved

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
I don't know, it just would feel weird

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Maybe it's Steve Perry being like

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
The bad guy

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
He's the super villain trying to get revenge on the band

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
It's like new Journey albums

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Quick, name a Journey single after

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
The 1980's

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Yep, yeah

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
That's what I thought, alright

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Anyhow, your gaming week

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
What have you been playing this week, Dark Soccer?

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Uh, WoW

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Mass Effect 2, Mass Effect 3

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Um, the Mass Effect thingy

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
On my phone, since I'm trying to get my rating back up

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Um, and

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Uh, yeah

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
That's really good

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Same old stuff for you

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
That's not bad, I mean, it's not like you're playing bad games

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
And watching a lot of playthroughs

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Okay

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Like, Dan and I had our big Castlevania fit

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
The other day

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
But you guys like to do that, you like to go on YouTube

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
And watch all the playthroughs, like that's something you guys do

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Dan likes to do that

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Every so often I'll just get invested and watch

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Do you ever do the live stuff?

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Do you guys ever go onto one of those sites like Ustream

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Or Twitch.tv or whatever other sites

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
There are and watch the live stream?

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Nah

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
But that's because you and the hubby are more classic gamers

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
More than anything, yeah

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
I mean, I wouldn't mind doing like a

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Episodic playthrough of something

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
But, you know

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
I like watching other people do it

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Except it kind of bugs me because, I mean, it is

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Truly what an almost perfect playthrough

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
Looks like because they're usually, um

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Machine assisted, you know

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Tigerclaw wants to know if you're going to get the Mass Effect 3

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Leviathan DLC

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Fuck yes

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
As if that should surprise anybody whatsoever

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
I am so excited, you guys

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
That's why I kind of don't want to beat my game yet

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
You finally set foot in multiplayer

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Not that long ago

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
And I couldn't find anybody else on

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Because no one would let me know when they were playing

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
We need to make that happen again

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Well, for me, I have to change out my EXE

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Because I have a hacked EXE so I can play in god mode

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
But I saved my original file

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
So that I can switch out for multiplayer

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Tigerclaw, I just want to give a plug

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
There's a lot of classic games played on Twitch.tv

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
There are people doing speedruns on old Mario games

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
That's cool

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
I just don't like to watch it live, I guess

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Unless it's for charity

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Okay, like Mario Marathon you're down with

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
That's understandable

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
And even then I'm like, dude, you're still playing Sunshine, why?

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
I like Sunshine

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Wait a minute, didn't you say Sunshine was a good game on last week's show?

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
I like Sunshine, but it's kind of boring to watch it

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Like

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Even as much as I love Mario 64

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
It's kind of boring to watch it

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Understandable

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Alright, Loki, how about you?

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
How was your gaming week?

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
This week I played lots of Minecraft

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Mainly

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Little bit of Grand Theft Auto because I was

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Working on mods

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
And stuff

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
But yeah

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Going back to Minecraft though

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
We started a new map

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
That's a tutorial level, which is kind of fun

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
I had to start off on that

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
And then played through a little bit of that

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
And I actually went back last night

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
To my VoG map

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
And was working a little bit more in peaceful mode too

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
I was finishing up some minecart stations

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
They make the little

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Bell

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Intro thing when they

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Stop and then it waits like

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Five seconds or so and then it makes that noise

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Again and then goes automatically

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Have you figured out what worlds you should be playing on

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
To get the awesome

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Stuff? Like, I'm sure people out there

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Post on forums like

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Oh, use this seed, it's the best or something like that

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
There's all sorts of seeds

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
For different things, but it

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Doesn't really matter

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
The only kind of unique thing there on some of the seeds

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
There are like

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Landscape I guess

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
And then there's a few that have like the golden apples

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Hidden in there and chests and stuff

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
But it's just

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
That's pretty much it

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
If you restart your levels

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Or start new seeds now, there's clay

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Which I never used anyway

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
So it's not a big deal

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
And then

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
You know, slimes, I guess slime farms

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Are kind of important now that they're sticky

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Pistons and that kind of thing

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
But I don't know

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
I haven't really bothered to

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
You know, find those

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Usually I just try to find some interesting

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Looking

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Landscape and stuff

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
But even now it's just kind of

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
It's kind of boring going back to that stuff

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Just waiting for the next update

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
The adventure update I think is going to make it a lot more fun

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
But we'll have to see

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
So anyways, Minecraft stuff

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
And then I actually played

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
A little bit of new stuff

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
I played more Sleeping Dogs again

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
For some reason my save

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Like I had done a bunch of missions

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
And my save just didn't save or something

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
I must have forgotten the save

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Or it didn't auto save or whatever

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
And so I'm having to redo a bunch of missions

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
So I did that

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Today and then

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
One new game I actually picked up

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
I picked up

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
What was it? Scott Pilgrim vs. The World

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
I don't know why they picked that up at launch

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
It was fucking amazing

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Yeah, I thought you had bought that at launch

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
So I finally got around to playing it

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
My only gripe about it

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
And this is just kind of a weird thing

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Is that the stages are too long

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Like I'm trying to fit in

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
Playing a stage with my friend at work

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
And we tried our 15 minute breaks

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
There's just no way to beat the first stage in 15 minutes

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
So we tried during lunch

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Where we had an hour

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
And it actually

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Got to the boss and that was about it

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
But we didn't get to beat it because we ran out of time

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
So the stages are a little long

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
In my game, since it's more like an arcade game

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
But

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
It's really awesome

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
The animation is amazing

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
I love the way it looks and sounds

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
It's just a really fantastic game

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Really cool, recommend checking it out

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
Kind of disappointed the stages are so long

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
Because it does make it hard to play on break

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
And then beyond that

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
I think that's all I've played this week

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Yeah

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Alrighty

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Oh, how's your little con...

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
I know this will be over by the time

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
The podcast hits, but for the live folks

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
That contest thing you're doing, how's that going?

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
As of right now I'm in the first place

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
And what that means is

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Assuming I win, which I'm probably going to

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Unless this one chick gets

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
A couple more retweets

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
I'm going to have them

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Draw me a picture

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Of myself dressed as Tingle

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
That is going to be the closest you'll get

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
That's still pretty awesome

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
And she's a pretty awesome artist

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
So expect that

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
An OLR in-joke will finally

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Come to an end, although we all know

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
It's not going to come to an end whatsoever

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
However, it will finally reach the next step

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Some resolution, yes

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
If you can get

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Because you don't want to just win

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
You want to win big

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
And we want Footy's Kickstarter to do well

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
It's really

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
I guess it's really

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
About that

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
That's really it

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
They're doing okay

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
But I'm kind of worried that they may not

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Hit their goal

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
They're just under $6,000

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Of $10,000

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
They've got 11 days left

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Sometimes those last few days are the biggest

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
I think they can do it

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
It looks like a pretty cool game

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
They're not asking for too much

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
If you want to check it out

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
It's Evilot

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
It's E-V-I-L-O-T

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
The game looks a little similar to

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Zombies with

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
What was that?

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
I'm trying to remember the original name of the game

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
It was like, Hey Bad Man

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Why?

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
It was a game on PSP

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
It was like where you play the villain basically

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
So it looks cool

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
It should be neat

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Alright, Mike Gaming Week

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Kind of like Dark Soccer

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
I played a lot of the same stuff that you're used to hearing me talk about

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Like World of Warcraft

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
And was continuing to play

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Sound Shapes

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
I don't know why the name escaped me for a minute

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
I was playing more Sound Shapes

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
I was playing Mario 2 still

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
However, there is one new game I spent

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
A pretty good chunk of time playing

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
It technically started on Friday

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
It's Guild Wars 2

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
I have spent some time playing

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
I didn't get to play a lot a lot

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Because I was in San Francisco this weekend

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Hanging out with Grandpa from Horde House

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
But on Friday night

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
And a little bit today

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
I'm at Guild Wars 2

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
I'm up to about level 10

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
So I'm not sure I've really had

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
A full amount of time to really flesh out

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
What I think about this game

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
A lot of the things that were bugging me about it

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
At first, I'm easing up on a little bit

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
And it all has to do with

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
You know, the Guild Wars 2 model

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Because you know the pricing model is a lot different

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
For Guild Wars 2

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
You pay the one fee to get the game

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
And then you never have to pay

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Like a monthly fee or anything again

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Like no monthly fee

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
But now they're adding a little more of the free to play

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Elements in it

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
Like you can go into the online shop

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
And buy like sunglasses for your character

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
You know, dumb little things

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
But there are some

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Like basically steroids

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Performance enhancing things you can get

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Like you know, short time XP bonuses

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
And things like that you can kind of get in the shop

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
With real money

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
One of the things that started to irritate me

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Is that I got a chest that dropped

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
And the key I needed to open it

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Was something to buy in the store

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
And I was like, oh that's bullshit

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
That's such bullshit that you

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
You know, I was going to rage because that's a Facebook game

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
But then finally, I don't know if I got it as a quest reward

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
I think I got it as a quest reward around level 10

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
I did get one of those keys

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
So it doesn't bug me nearly as much

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
If you can get it in the game by doing a lot of grinding

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
You know, either you're going to be free to play

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Or you're going to be

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
You know, not free to play

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
I still think Guild Wars 2

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Despite that bitch

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Is relatively minor bitch

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
I'm really impressed with a lot of what I've seen so far

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Graphically, it's

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
It's really nice

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
It's a wonderfully presented game

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
You know, there's always

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
That temptation to compare MMOs

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
To World of Warcraft, but this game

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Doesn't really feel like World of Warcraft

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
And I think one big reason

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
For that is they've managed

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
To figure out a new way to do quests

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
There are no yellow exclamation marks

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Over people's heads

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
And it's not like the Final Fantasy XI style

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Questing either

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Basically what happens is that

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
You have this giant map

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
And I gotta say

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
There's a little thing I love about this game

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
And that is when you go to the map

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
The way the map appears is your camera

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Actually pans down

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
And does like

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
It does a subtle transition to the actual map

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
But it makes it look like

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
You're on Google Maps

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
And then it zooms back in to show your character

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
The way it does that transition

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
It's one of those little things

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
That really makes you go

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
That's so cool

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
And then Shane found out you could draw on the map

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Like it's a Madden thing

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
You could draw the plays on the map

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
Anyhow, questing

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
So you go on the map and you'll find these little scouts

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
And the scouts will tell you these things

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
So and so is in trouble and needs help

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
This person is having to deal with this conflict

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Going on right now and could use some help

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
This person is near the cave and da da da

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
So the scouts will tell you where these people are

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
And then they draw the little hearts on your map

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
And you go over to the hearts

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
And then when you're in that general area

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
The game will tell you either kill these things

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Collect these things

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
You know, kind of the general MMO stuff

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
But you get to pick what you want to do

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Do you want to kill? Do you want to collect? What do you want to do?

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
And as you do those, you start to gain

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
It's like mini reputation grinds

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Little mini reputation grinds

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
They don't take you any more than like 30 minutes

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
And then the person, the heart fills in

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
And that person will start selling you gear and stuff

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
And you've basically completed the quest

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
And you get like gold and XP

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
And the typical things

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Now generally in these areas as well

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Somebody could start an event quest

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
And the event quest is like the public questing

39:03.000 --> 39:07.000
Which a lot of MMOs besides WoW have in them

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
And even WoW is getting it to some extent

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
With the scenarios in Pandaria

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
But like Warhammer

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Was a game that did this very well

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Was the whole public questing

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
And I gotta say with the Guild Wars launch going on

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
I mean it was crazy, like in the starter area

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
It would be like so and so needs help

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Eradicating the mosquitoes from the village

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Because you know it's like a level 2 quest or whatever

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
And then suddenly like a big orange circle appears on your map

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
And all these mosquitoes are everywhere

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
There's like 75 people everywhere

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Killing mosquitoes and you just watch the bar go

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
And it like fills right up

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
And then you get a medal based on your contribution

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
And the medal gives you experience, gold, and karma points

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
And karma points you turn around and use to buy gear

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
So I gotta say

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
I love that they've really challenged themselves to think outside the box

39:54.000 --> 39:58.000
And not make a clone of the successful formula

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
But as MMO fans

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
What do we think MMOs ought to offer?

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
And it really does feel like in that regard

40:04.000 --> 40:08.000
Guild Wars 2 is taking MMOs to the next level

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
I really think that

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
I think it's giving a lot of

40:12.000 --> 40:16.000
I don't want to turn into a Guild Wars 2 vs. WoW thing

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
I love WoW, I can't say

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Oh Guild Wars 2 is going to kick its ass, whatever

40:20.000 --> 40:23.000
And I totally disagree with people that are like

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Oh WoW is dead

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Oh WoW is so dead

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
The panda people is stupid

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
It's a little kid and Guild Wars is going to kill it

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
I've been saying every game is going to kill WoW

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
WoW will continue to exist

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
But I gotta say Guild Wars 2

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
Really brings something else to the table with that

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
And one other little thing about Guild Wars 2

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
That I love

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
They brought vista points into the game

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
Which I remember from a racing game called Fuel

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
From a couple years ago

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
You remember that game Fuel?

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
You remember how there would be places on the map

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
You would drive to that it's just a really gorgeous view

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
And you got points for that

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
And I think Assassin's Creed does something like this too

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
At least somebody was joking with me

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
And I haven't played that series a lot

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
But basically you go to these points on the map

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
And you might have to interact with the environment a little

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Like you'll have to find the little mushrooms

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
You have to jump up to get to the top of the building

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
And then once you get up there they'll be a little book

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
And you press the button

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
And all of a sudden you'll go to a cutscene

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Where the camera will do this gorgeous pan

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
And show you everything around you

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
And then 60 XP for finding the vista point

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
And it's marked on your map

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
I thought that was so awesome

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Like it's something else to do that's not

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Grinding a dungeon or whatever

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
It's just neat

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
There's a lot about Guild Wars 2 that's just different

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
It sounds like they could have it

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Like you know there's people that kind of

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Challenge themselves to play like a pacifist

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
That you could probably level up

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
You don't get enough XP

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
However, yeah the passive

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Because you could go to these areas where they're like

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Because to help all the people

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
You can

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Collect kumquats or whatever

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
And turn them in or you can collect things

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
And turn them in usually

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
I think a pacifist, and you get XP from gathering too

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
So I think a pacifist could do very well

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
In Guild Wars 2

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
To be honest

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Although I honestly haven't played the game enough

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
I haven't played it past level 10

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
So I can't give you like a full full review

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
But I, despite some of my minor bitches

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
About what the free to play

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Traditional free to play mechanic is doing

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
To the game

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Despite my minor bitches there

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
I really love some of the stuff they are trying to do

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
A couple other quick things

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
I want to say about Guild Wars 2

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
We will move on with the show

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
But this is the new game

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
A lot of people are going to be talking about this game

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
PvP

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
If you elect to do PvP

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Which you don't have to do

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
But you go into your character and you hit the PvP button

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
And you basically get transported

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
To a whole new PvP world

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Where your character is suddenly max level

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
And you're automatically a template

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
And you can pick whatever skills

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
And your PvP gear is separate

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
You separated the PvP game

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
From the PvE game

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
But you get to have your same character

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
And when you design your character

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
You get to pick your favorite colors on the garb

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
And all that stuff

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
So it's like you still have a sense of character

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
But it's like a completely separate copy

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Of that character in PvP

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
And if you never want to touch PvP ever ever

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
You don't have to, it's like a separate little thing

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
And character design is great

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Because they kind of do a little bit of the mass effect

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Thing with it

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Where you pick like

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Did your character in their vision

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
See a snow leopard, a stag

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
And you make those types of decisions

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
That ultimately affect your story

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
I think my character saw a white stag

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
And that has been a big part of the story

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
I've been playing so far

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
So they have definitely taken some Bioware

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
The people designing this game

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Clearly love

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
All these different types of video games

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
And have now made the video game they want to be playing

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
And for the most part it's like 98% successful

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
From what I've seen so far

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
I'd play if I had the 60 bucks to afford it

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
That's the problem is dropping the money up front

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
You know it's an investment

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
I mean whereas you know

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
I've already got wow I'm already in the blood pact

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Sure sure

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
But that's the other thing I like about Guild Wars is that once you buy it

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
You know if I don't go back to it ever

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
It'll be there 6 months now

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
12 months from now

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
One other thing I'll say about this

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
The guild system is pretty awesome

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
Oh and then I'm going to give you one more negative

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
So the guild system is pretty awesome

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Once you form your little guild

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Every little thing that you do during the day

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Kind of contributes points to the guild's total

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
And you can use those points to buy perks

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
So it's kind of like what they were

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Going to do with World of Warcraft's

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Guild leveling system

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
But they actually did it where the guild master can elect

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
What guild perks you're going to build

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
You know do you want the guild to have an XP bonus

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Or a money bonus

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Or what is it that you want

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
And you can like use the resources to build those

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Which is pretty cool

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Now the place I'm going to knock it a little bit is that

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
This is actually a big one

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
I'm glad I thought of this because I got to knock the game for this

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
It's an issue

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
They did this whole 3 day launch thing right

45:02.000 --> 45:06.000
So there's a lot of people that aren't really going to be in the game until Tuesday

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
And some of the servers are already full

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
And you don't get to pick

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
One server for each character

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
You pick one server

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
For all of your characters

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Now there's a system in the game

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Where I guess you can have

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
People from other servers

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Kind of like in a real ID

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Kind of way they can guest in your game

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
And you can still kind of party

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Cross server and there is a lot

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
You can do cross server

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
But the one thing you can't do cross server is guild

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
The server I'm on

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Filled up in like a day

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
So if people want to try to get on that server

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
It's full

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
So what if I have friends like Jamie say

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Who haven't bought the game yet

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
And then they're going to try and get on my server

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
It's going to be too bad, it's full

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
I kind of think that's bullshit

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
That she can't join my guild because that filled up

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Because all the early people have the space

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
They need to have a system

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Where she can still get into that server

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Now

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
To be fair

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
I understand that they are doing some type of

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Open transfer for 7 days

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
They're going to allow you to switch worlds

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
However much you want for 7 days

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
So that people can kind of settle down

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Find a home and get off the populated servers

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
And all that stuff

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
However they're going to charge for that later on

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
And I still think it's kind of bullshit

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Like there needs to be a way

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
If I have a friend on the server

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Remember how Final Fantasy 11 did the world passes

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
I thought that was a good way to do it

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
If the server is populated make it expensive

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
To bring somebody on the server

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
But still make it possible

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
So that part

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Sucks and needs to be rethought

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
A little bit

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
But otherwise

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
I'm really cool with Guild Wars 2

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
So I've talked 20 minutes about Guild Wars 2

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
But it's a big game

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
So there you go that's my gaming week

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Finally

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
So let's talk about housekeeping

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Twitter.com slash olr

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Facebook.com slash orange lounge radio

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
And I didn't really clear this with Loki

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Before the show but I don't think he's going to care

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
We're not doing a show next week

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
For Labor Day

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
And it's because

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
PAX you're all on vacation

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
You know what just enjoy

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
The long weekend we will try to have something

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Special that does play live on the feed

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Like a best of or an oldie moldy

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Classic episode or something for those

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
Few of you that will still be there on Sunday night

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
But if you know what

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
If you have an opportunity to go out and get a

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Rest and vacation a little bit enjoy

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
It I guess that would also be

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
We have to remember not every country is

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Getting a three day weekend that's mostly an America

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Holiday not really celebrated

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Other places however please understand

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
We do want to take the rare opportunity

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
To go have a three day weekend and you know

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
Take a road trip if we want or what have you

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
I'm toying with the idea of taking a little

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Quick road trip for the weekend

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
We'll see I think it will be fun

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Of course sitting on my big butt and playing video games

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
All day long will be great too

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Civ 5 uber match yeah

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
I just think it's kind of weird that like school

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Is starting this week

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
And then there's Labor Day

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
So like two days of magazine class

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
No day of magazine class

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
School year has been like that for forever

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
So alright

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Alright let's get into some gaming news

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
And talk about what is going on

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
In the gaming world and unfortunately

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
I better cue the Debbie Downer horns

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Cause it doesn't start off pretty

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Does it Loki? No layoffs

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
It's more and more layoffs

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
So PopCap they were hit

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
With layoffs internationally

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
And at least so they kind of

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
The way they did it

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
At least they were talking about

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
What happens in the industry

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
And they try to like kind of make it

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
You know

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
They didn't kind of hide it

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
From the public I guess

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
And so basically

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
They have

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Shrunk down I guess

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Shanghai's studio

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Also in Seattle they let

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
50 people go

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
And Dublin was shut down

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
So you know

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Quite a bit of layoffs

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
They said that you know

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
I guess

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
They made a statement

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
And I

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Just think it's kind of interesting the way they did it

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
You know basically you know

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
You know 12 years ago

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
We founded PopCap we never imagined the games

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
We'd made the vast number of people

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
You know who'd play those games

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Or the success that followed and so on and so forth

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
And then you know

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
This morning we informed our employees

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Of a reorganization in our studios

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
That will include a reduction in force

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
In North America operations

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Mostly our headquarters here in Seattle

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
And an exploratory

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
Consultation to evaluate

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
The future of our PopCap office

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
In Dublin

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Ireland

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
And now in English reduction in force

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Means that some people are losing their jobs

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Exploratory consultation means

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
We're taking our Dublin team

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
About the future of that

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Or talking to our Dublin team about the future of that office

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
And whether we can find a path to improve

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Our profitability in Europe without having to

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Close operations. Today's news is something

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
You expect periodically from companies

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
In a fast changing industry but it sucks

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
If you're one of those people losing his or her jobs

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
These people are our friends

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
And we don't like doing this

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
So at least they're being very personable about it

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
And just like you know

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
I think that's the way you do it right there

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
However I think

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
There's another pink elephant in the room

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
And allow me to echo the

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Pink elephant? Yeah

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Pink elephant that stands out

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Isn't that when you just drink a lot?

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
You see pink elephants?

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
No I've always heard the pink elephant in the room

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Is the obvious thing or whatever

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Anyway you're derailing me

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
The pink elephant in the room in this

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
And allow me to echo the rest of the internet

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
In this is

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
I don't understand

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Why PopCap?

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Is PopCap struggling?

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
I thought out of all the

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Gaming companies out there

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
PopCap was doing a lot of things right

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
And granted your whole memo

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
And everything you're talking about there is

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
An example of some of the things they do right

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
A lot of us had a great fear

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
When EA bought them

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Something like this would happen

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
They go into why

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
And basically

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
A little context on why we're making cuts

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
In some areas and why we're investing and expanding

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
In others, in past years

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
We've seen dramatic change in the way people play

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
And pay for games

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Free to play, social and mobile games have

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Exploded in popularity, that happened fast

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Surprisingly so

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
The change in consumer taste requires

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Us to reorganize our business and

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Invest in new types of games on new

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Platforms, it's a completely different world

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
From where we started, that's why

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
I still

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Does not make sense

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
And granted PopCap

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
Wasn't putting out a lot of games

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Maybe unfortunately there was

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Just too much that was in development

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
That was costing them too much money

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Too much in development, not enough out on the table

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
But still, how fucking huge

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Was Plants vs. Zombies

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
But Jeweled

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
But Jeweled changed

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
The industry in some ways

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
But Jeweled was one of the first Facebook

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Games, period

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Everybody knows what kind of

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
Jackpagle is

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
I don't understand

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
I get it when game companies

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
As much as this pained me

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
When Bizarre Creations closed

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
I understood that Blur

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Was not very well received

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
And that the Geometry Wars games were kind of

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Losing steam and all that

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
And that they weren't doing the PGR games anymore

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
I kind of saw the economics in that

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
I don't get it here

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
Despite everything that they're saying there

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
I can't help as a fan

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
That this company was doing very well

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Before EA bought them

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
I can't help but think

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Despite what they're saying

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Something's up

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Well maybe

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Because they are bought by EA

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
The investors thought

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Hey, there's too much overhead on this company

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
And so we need to cut back

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
In order to make it more profitable

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
So EA just jacked all the franchise

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
EA just snatched Jeweled

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Snatched Plants vs. Zombies

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Worked for Zynga

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Of course they're seeing though that that's not the case

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
They said if we didn't have EA behind us

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
The cuts would have been worse

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
So, I don't know

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
I'd have to

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
I wouldn't really know what to do until I saw a financial report

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Honestly

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
It's just weird

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Maybe because everything is free to play

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Like for example in Jeweled Blitz

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
And stuff like that on Facebook

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
That no one's actually buying the games anymore

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
Maybe that's why

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
You think of not enough people buying

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Those power ups and the things that

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Maybe

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Substantiate the free to play model

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Maybe not

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Maybe because of PopCap's style

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
They've always been pretty good about not shoving that shit

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Down your throat like Zynga Games do

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
That maybe

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Unfortunately being nice isn't profitable

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Maybe

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
I don't think that it was a lack of that

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
I thought that they had very innovative ways of getting

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
The games out there

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
I've got a

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Special version of PEGL that teamed with Valve

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
That came out

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
When they were doing

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
It was like a special PEGL

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
That had Portal stuff in there

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
And Team Fortress and everything

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
And it was free

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
It's like if you liked this, here's the full game

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Here's the whole thing

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
The Plants vs. Zombies stuff in WoW

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
The PEGL add-on

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Which I played a lot of the PEGL add-on

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
And really wish it was still available

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
They really did look into

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Getting it out there in different ways

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
And I think that

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
If they had been able to keep that up

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Then maybe this wouldn't happen

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
But I'm not sure

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
I really don't know what to say

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Until I see a financial report

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Tigerclaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Could it be that people are finally

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Getting tired of playing

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Casual games?

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Nah

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
No

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
Here's the thing

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
If you mean casual games to mean Facebook games

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Maybe

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
I think what's going to happen to Facebook games

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
Is what happened in the video game crash of 84

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Which is there's just so much shit

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
In the market

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
And a lot of commercialized shit

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
And money grabbing shit that isn't worth it

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
There's just so much shit out there

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
It's going to crack

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
And people aren't feeling all that great about Facebook

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
These days anyway

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
I feel like

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
The other shoe is going to drop on Facebook

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Any day now

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
If there could actually be a competitor that could come in

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
I realize Google Plus is out there

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
But Google

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Kind of just couldn't do it for whatever reason

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
If there's somebody

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
That really gave the public what they wanted

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
It could all come tumbling down for Facebook

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Pretty soon

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
I'm on a social networking thing that doesn't have the stupid games on it

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Well I always liked the way Google Plus did it

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
It was just another tab somewhere else

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
I mean to be perfectly honest I'm actually thinking about

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Going back to using Google Plus

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Because of just how ridiculous Facebook has gotten

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
But I don't play the games

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
There's a lot of people that are worried about

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
System security

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
So they, like I have done, have blocked

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Every single game request that's come through

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
Well this is the thing that pisses me off about Facebook

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Literally pisses me off

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
I don't know how many times

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
I have turned off

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
Location statuses on my post

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
I don't want all my posts posting

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Where my location is

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
I use an app called Foursquare

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
When I specifically want to disclose that

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
I hate being tagged

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
I don't check into my house

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
And all that stuff

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
I don't do that

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
So I don't want my post to be tagged

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
With my work address or my home

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Or whatever it is

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Yet that shit keeps turning itself back on

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
I just had to do it on a Facebook post

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
I made an hour before the show

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
And that shit is driving me bonkers

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
The site's broken, remember I've talked about this a few weeks ago

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
And it's still broken

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
It's been broken for over a month now

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Where you can unsubscribe

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
From somebody's

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Comments and likes

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Basically you just don't want to see one

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Okay I like this picture

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
I don't care if you like that picture

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
And it keeps popping back

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
No it keeps popping back up

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
I want to unsubscribe from it

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
And it will hide that post

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
But it will still be there

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
I have to stop

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
For people that keep having that stuff pop up

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
And I'm just tired of seeing their post

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
I actually have to unsubscribe from them

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Why do we keep using Facebook?

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
I'm sitting here bitching

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Yet I'll still use it to make some stupid posts this evening

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Why? Because I need instant gratification

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Not that people are on Google

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
It's not even that

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Why do we need that right now in our society?

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Why do we need it?

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
The only reason I keep up with Facebook

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Is just to piss off my mother

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
To keep up with my friends and family

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
In Alabama

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
To keep up with my friends

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
In other countries

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
To keep up with my friends across America

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Because only three people

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
Anymore still use AIM

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Which I still use to keep up with people

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
I've found old friends

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
That I used to chat with

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Back when I had AOL for real

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Back in the day

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
One of my friends just found me through DeviantArt

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
And we're on Facebook now

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
I mean, I use it to keep up with people

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
But other than that

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
I mean, like

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
I get so irritated that

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
People just use it for a

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Sympathy grab, you know what I mean?

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Or, hi, look where I am and you're not

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
I don't care where you are

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
I don't need to know when you go to bed

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
I think it's just this whole

58:40.000 --> 58:44.000
I think it really is a modern phenomenon

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
That everyone wants a little bit of

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
I hate to use it

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
In this respect, but everyone wants their own little

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Piece of celebrity, you know what I mean?

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Where they want people to care about what they're doing

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
It's that whole Andy Warhol thing

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
The 15 minutes of fame, it's all of that coming to light

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Andy Warhol predicted things better than the Mayans

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
Well, he was a fairly

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Interesting person

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Yes he was He was an OCD collector

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Yeah, yeah Anyway

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
My teacher got to meet him Why did he do a painting of soup cans?

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
One of my teachers got to meet him

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Oh yeah? Yeah, back then

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Anyhow, how did we get from PopCap to this?

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
You're the one who changed it to Andy Warhol

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
I do find this topic fascinating

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Let me read some chat comments real quick

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Those participating with the show at live.vognetwork.com

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
I use it, talking about Facebook

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Cause all my family and friends use it

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
And that's all I can use to keep up with them

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Why?

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
And I'm not saying that at you

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Because I bet everybody would answer the question the same way

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
And I'm even asking myself this

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Why not just pick up the phone and call somebody?

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
I'd

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
I'd pretty much

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
I'd call my mother

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
I have nothing to talk to them about

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
That's why I post

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Things on there

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Not like, hey I did this today

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
It's like, hey look at this cool movie trailer

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Frisbee in our chat room

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Why does Facebook have to be the only way

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
To keep in touch with people?

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
And lately all I do now is just for

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Reblogging political shit

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
It helped me with the kitten

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
You know?

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
You gotta love

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
DJ Morpheus from Understation Live

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Just made a Facebook post

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
I was told to reload Facebook, so that's why I did it

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
No, I hate being tagged in a location

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Where you were tagged. Jamie hates to be tagged

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
So I'm tagging her. I don't mind being tagged

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
In a picture, I hate location tags

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Actually I don't like being tagged

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
In a picture sometimes, like the ones

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Not necessarily pictures, but like the ones that are like

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Here's a calendar of all these birthdays

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
I'm gonna tag everybody

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
For the record, I can't hide that

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Travis, just saying

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
I hate the picture tagging too, but

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
At the same time, like earlier today

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Clover Nykon, one of our listeners

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Made this awesome 3D vog art rendering

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
And he tagged me in that

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
And I was okay with that

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
At least that's relevant to my interest

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
I may not be in that picture, but it's a vog picture

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
And I want to see it, so that's alright

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
I don't give a crap about that

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
I hate location posts

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
I am going to

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
resolution

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
We've been talking a lot about Labor Day

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
And what we want to do over the Labor Day weekend

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
And I am going to resolve

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
To not touch social networking

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Labor Day weekend

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
No Facebook, no Google Plus, no Twitter

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
You know where I live these days?

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Tumblr

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
None of that either, none of that for me

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Have fun, I'm gonna be on Tumblr

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Why won't you do it?

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Because I love Tumblr, I can give up Facebook

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
I don't give a crap, but I love Tumblr because

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
I actually get news articles

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
On Tumblr, I use Tumblr as my

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Blog for my

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Fitness thing, and actually if anyone wants to follow

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
My fitness blog, it's called Dieting Can

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Bite Me, all one word

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
At Tumblr

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
But I mean, I use that for

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I use it for art blogging

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
I actually use that for real

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Blogging stuff, and for getting my thoughts

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Out there, it's sort of my

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Live general replacement for right now

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Alan Alchemy in our chat room says, well the issue of Facebook

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Is that it managed to get everyone's like

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
55 year old aunts and shit on it

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Which really is unprecedented

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
And that audience does not give a shit about moving

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
On to the next great thing like the rest of it

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
It's kind of a good point

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Is that that's one reason why Facebook took off

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Is that it got everybody on it

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000
And now it's ads, ads, ads, ads

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Alan Alchemy continues

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
So the problem is that if you're in the same situation

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Of keeping track of your family, re-Facebook

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
There is no reason to ever believe they'll move on

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
To something else, so even if you move on

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
To the next thing, you'll have to keep your Facebook

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
So it's always going to be a little bit relevant

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Then let's move off

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Let's go back to Live Journal

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Here's some selected likes that they want me to like

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Wreck-It Ralph, Cuddling,

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Five Finger Death Punch, and Act of Valor

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
What?

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
All that liking stuff is, is marketing

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Exactly, I've had to go back

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
And unlike things because

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
I realize it's ironic, we tell you to go like

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Orange Lounge Radio and Vogue Network

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
But guys, that's

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
I mean, and that's the double-edged sword about Facebook

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Is that it's still a great way to promote

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
My shit, when I don't have the million dollars

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
To spend on magazine ads and

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
You know, TV ads and the other stuff

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
The big boys get to do

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
So yes, I do realize it's ironic

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Here I am bitching about Facebook, yet

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
I say, go like Orange Lounge Radio on Facebook

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Because it still is a good way to remind you guys

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
The show is here, and to listen

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
And all that stuff

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Well, I'm going to stick to it

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
I'm going to put

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Make my actions match my words

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
I am stepping off Facebook

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
For one weekend, it's not even

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
That big of a deal, one weekend

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Is anybody out there going to try it too?

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Is it just going to be me?

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Are you really all that attached?

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
I guess we'll find out

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Where were we? We were talking about PopCap

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
I'm sure the PopCap employees don't

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Really appreciate that it became a Facebook rant

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
But whatever

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Travis tagged you with

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Your location

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Yeah, but he did it for my fan page

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
So keep pouring that out

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
That's fine

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
In Sacramento, well that's fine

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
I just don't like it when he gives my address

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Alright, moving on

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
More bad news

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Sometimes I don't want people to know

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
When I'm having lunch at Wiener Works

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Only when I'm having dessert

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
That's why I got rid of Foursquare

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
I really don't give a shit anymore

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
I don't care if people know where I am

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I don't necessarily want people to know where I am

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
And I don't care where you are

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
I actually, okay

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
I swear this is the last thing on social networking

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
The reason why I like Foursquare

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Is I actually like the search function

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
To see what restaurants my friends have been to

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
And if they left tips, if they enjoyed it or not

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
I have found it to be way more useful

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Than Yelp and that

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
I usually just ask people

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Yelp reviews are a lot of

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Well, but like, okay

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Literally one night, Alan and I were out shopping

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
We were at Bed Bath and Beyond or something

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Getting the coffee stuff

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Because they sell a lot of the coffee cups there

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
And we were like, alright let's go somewhere for dinner

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Where should we go? I don't know

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Let's go somewhere new

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
And I pulled up Foursquare and I'm like

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Alright, let me see what restaurants are coming up

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
That my friends have been to recently

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Oh, Tex Wasabi's

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
That's that one guy

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
From Food Network's restaurant

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Yeah, thank you

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
That guy with the horrible hair

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
It's his restaurant and I've never been there

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
And I loved it actually

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
I thought it was really expensive

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Yeah, it's a little bit

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
It's not like Ruth Chris expensive

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
It's like Red Lobster prices

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
That's not so bad

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
It's sushi and barbecue

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
And I

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
You think it's the weirdest thing in the world

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
I shit you not, it's fucking amazing

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Not to endorse

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Johnny Garlic's

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
But there's none around here I don't think

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
No, there's one in Roseville

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
What are you talking about?

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Alright

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Let's move on

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
This is more bad news

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
This just sucks

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
I don't know what else to say about this

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Sony Liverpool has been closed

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
You know them because they brought you

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Wipeout 2048

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
If you're like me you remember this studio

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
When they were called Psygnosis

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
You remember Psygnosis?

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Lemmings

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
I mean that game

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Was like PC gaming

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Golden Child

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
For years and years

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
They became Sony Liverpool

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Shadow of the Beast was another game they made

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
And of course the Wipeout games

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
What happened?

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
I guess Wipeout on the Vita didn't live up to expectations

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
I don't think that's Wipeout's fault

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
That was probably one of the better games

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
To get on the Vita

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
This is another one I'm looking at

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Going

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Is it just because Wipeout

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Isn't making waves

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
The way that LittleBigPlanet

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Is? I mean I don't know

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
But I mean Psygnosis has put out some good shit

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Over the years

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
It's just weird

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
What else can I say?

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
That sucks

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
A little known fact about Psygnosis

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
They received top billing for creating

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
The faceoff games

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Featured in Nickelodeon's 1992 television show

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Nick Arcade

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
That's right they created the faceoff games in Nick Arcade

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Get the fuck out that was them?

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Yeah Posthaste, Jet Jocks

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
And Battle of the Bands

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
A little piece of

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
The 12 year old boy in me

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Who is playing Lemmings on his

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
486 PC is having a cry

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Right now

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
I don't get it

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Poor Rob

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Poor me, poor all of us

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
We all lose with this news

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
This week, the only thing we can hope

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
These guys form new stuff

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
You know see this would have been another game

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
That would have been good from them

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
That they could have remade and it would have been really sweet

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Colony Wars was another game that they worked on

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
When they were Sony

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
I swear all this is just putting me in a bad mood

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
I'm sorry

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Well I hope they can

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Rise up and start

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Something new, I mean I remember PopCap had

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
That iOS studio

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
No one's gonna do anything new

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
There's no money in anything new

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
People want the same recycled

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Crap and companies don't like to

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Take risks, end of story

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Do you find it a bit ironic that they're

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
One of the launch games for you know

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
This whole Sony mobile thing or whatever

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Their platform is Lemmings

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
That's just salt in the wound right there

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
But I mean well

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
That's just because what's new hasn't been thought of yet

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Facebook at one time didn't exist

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
It was new

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
But it was still based off of a pre-existing concept

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Social networking is not new

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Well video games aren't new

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
But there's still lots of ideas that haven't been discovered yet

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
You know we had pen pals back in the day

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000
This is updated pen palling pretty much

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
You know

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Concepts can evolve

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
But I really don't think that there's

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Much new to be had anymore

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Everyone copies everybody

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
I think that's with all due respect

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
I think that's just a jaded perspective

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
On where our industry is at

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
We feel that way because that's all we're getting

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
We're getting sequels, we're getting all this same old shit

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
The people that are doing new things are being ignored

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
And I agree

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
That sucks

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
We need to pay attention to the good ideas

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
And I've told a couple people this

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
I'm actually gonna be writing a book and I'm gonna self publish

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Because

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
You notice that all the books

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
And I hate to use these as examples

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Because they really are just awful fan fiction

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
But like that 50 Shades of Shit

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
There's some pretty bad writing that gets published

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
And people eat it up

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
But the thing is

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
That that's someone who

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
You know some of these other books that came out

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
That have been rejected

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
By major publishers

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
They've self published and have since turned into

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Pretty big money making schemes

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
There's a girl that writes episodic

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Vampire stories on Facebook

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
For 99 cents a copy

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
And she's a millionaire now

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
A million bucks isn't that much anymore

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Relatively

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
I wouldn't mind having that

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
But a college student putting up

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Her own little stories on Amazon

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Selling them

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
I think she'd get like a

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
10% profit off of it

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Or some really small margin of profit

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
What's the trick? How do you make people pay for it?

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
If we charge 99 cents an episode

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Of Orange Lounge Radio

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Let's not kid ourselves

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
The thing that I'm saying is

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
That I think that's why the Kickstarter thing is actually

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Really taking off

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
It has to do back with that self publishing

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Self actualizing

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
They're going to the people instead of using

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Some formula

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
That companies think works

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
They're putting

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Say hey, show me you're interested with your money

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
I mean

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Except 5% of it won't actually go to the idea

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
At all

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
But the Kickstarter idea is new

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Relatively new

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
And they made a business off of it

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
So that's something there

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
It's basically I think a lot of people

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Taking their own ideas

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Into their own hands

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Not letting someone else corrupt their idea

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
And seeing how far they can make it go

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Based on the will of the people

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Alright

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
I'm sorry I didn't mean to go off on that

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
That's alright

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
That's funny news though

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
It's been an hour and we've done two downer stories

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Fuck this game

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Fuck this game

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Final Fantasy XIV

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
It's being pulled off the shelves

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Aw no more Final Fantasy XIV

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Squeenix said take it off your shelves

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
You know why?

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Because they don't want it to get in the way of a

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Realm Reborn

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
They're basically saying

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
That those who are registering

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Their copy of Final Fantasy XIV

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Will have full access to a 30 day

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Free trial period prior to the servers shutting

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Down in preparation for the

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Alpha and Beta test of a Realm Reborn

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
So they're wanting to just

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Not have those old copies go out there anymore

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
They want people to focus

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
On the new

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
What happens if they don't

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Use those free, like if I bought

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
The game and I knew that they're gonna

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Shut the servers down

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
The servers aren't shutting down

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Don't be confused

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
They're just pulling it off shelves

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
They're shutting down the servers

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
What? I had not heard that

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Exactly what I read off here

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
From their own thing

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Prior to the servers shutting down

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
To prepare for the Alpha and Beta tests

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Oh shit

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
So like why would I want to

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Wow

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
If I had 30 days

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Wouldn't I want to save that for when it starts

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
When I originally saw this, that update wasn't there

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
That's why

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Basically the update

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Is a confirmation that

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
The original story came out from

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
People posting about, hey we got this

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Note in our store, we have to take it down

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
I'll read the

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Actual statement, okay

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
In anticipation of the upcoming Alpha and Beta test

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
For Final Fantasy XIV, a Realm Reborn

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Square Enix, in coordination

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
With our retail partners, has decided

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
To discontinue sales of the current version of Final Fantasy XIV

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
This move was done

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
To help ensure that new customers who register

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Their copy of Final Fantasy XIV

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Will have full access to the 30 day

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Free trial period prior to the

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Servers shutting down to prepare for the Alpha

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
And Beta tests of Final Fantasy XIV

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
A Realm Reborn

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Wow

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
See, in my mind I was like

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Oh, they'll do kind of like what World of Warcraft does

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
You have your test servers that run one

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Copy of the game

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
That's archaic and dumb

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Not that anybody's really gonna

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
There'll be hundreds of people that weep over

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Final Fantasy XIV servers being shut down

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
But, I mean

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
When it vanishes to that though, it is a clean break from the old

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Yeah, that's

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
That's unprecedented

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
I think it's gonna kick it

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
I think it's gonna

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Kick him in the ass

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Square is literally trying to erase your memory

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Of that game

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
So that when Realm Reborn comes out

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
It's treated like a brand new game

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
A brand new launch

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Like the old one didn't ever happen

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
That's crazy

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
I think

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
That it's gonna come back to kick him though

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
I think it's gonna come back

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
And I think it's really gonna hurt him

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
I'd

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
It's a, you know what, I'm gonna give it this

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Final Fantasy XIV

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Sucked

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
I tried it two or three times

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
I really tried to like it

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
It was not a good MMO

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Harry Monkey Balls is what it sucked

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
I'm just, having played WoW

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Having played Guild Wars

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Night's the Old Republic

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Having played just about everything that's come to the

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Table

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Final Fantasy XIV sucked

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
XI was still a better experience

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
For the month I went back to XI

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
I just

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Yeah

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
And XI made me cry with frustration

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
And everything I saw made me like it better

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Oh, but I don't think it's necessarily

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Going to, you know

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
I applaud them for taking risks

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
I don't know if it will necessarily

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Be a failure

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
But I think if you're hedging your bets on sales of the

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Console version of the game, that's dangerous

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Because console MMOs

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Haven't been super super well done

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
So

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
With the exception of Final Fantasy XI

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
So I hope they also

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Consider the relaunch on the PC as well

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
I'm

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Fascinating

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
You know what, it's like the more crap they do

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
With this, the less I'm interested in it

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
It's not worth it, there's bigger and better out there

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Alright, let's move on with some more news

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
So EA is hoping

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
To avoid a whole

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
It's kind of funny that they're actually

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Acknowledging it now, but they're trying

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
To put a lot

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Of resources in preventing another

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
FIFA hack going on

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
With FIFA 13

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
And basically

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
They made a lot of money off the Ultimate Team DLC

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
A 69%

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Increase from the same period last year

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
And of course people suspect

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Hmm, that might be because people were hacking

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Accounts to steal

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
People's live information

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
And buy

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
FIFA stuff so they could resell those characters

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
They said

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
We've learned a lot from the experience

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
A lot of companies are suffering from this right now

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
There's a lot of sophisticated hacking

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Or hacking happening in the gaming industry

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
And it's a continuous battle

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
And we've

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
We take it very seriously

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
And we put a lot of resources on it

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
We're learning from the FIFA example last year

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
And it's been incorporated into this year

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
And there's some incremental and additional

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Things, I don't want to get too detailed

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Because I want to tip our hand

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
But rest assured we'll take it very seriously

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
I'm sorry

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
I still don't see how that's going to happen

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Considering that you're selling the same stuff

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
On Madden now

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
And you're still doing the FIFA thing

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
So as long as you keep making

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
It profitable for people to steal those

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Accounts and actually be able to sell

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Stuff for real money

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Then people are going to keep hacking those accounts

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
To try to make money off of them

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
This whole thing gets a nice hearty kiss my ass

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
From EA because

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
I mean, granted, okay

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
It's nice that you're like acknowledging something's

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Going on now

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Now that you're trying to sell the new copy

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Of your game

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
You know, like, screw you for not

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Having said that this was a problem

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Before

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Now you're just casually

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Saying, oh yes, well we've learned from the past

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
And da da da da da

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
But the new one's going to be bigger and better

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
You are using

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
People who had their money stolen

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
As an excuse to plug

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Your new game, that's what it feels like to me

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Honestly, as somebody who was FIFA hacked

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
For all this

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Some people frown on the use of the term

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Hacking, whatever the fuck it was

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Money was stolen and

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Social engineering is still

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
A form of hacking, I guess

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
So they're going to add

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
More stuff to their marketplace so that

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
There's more things for people to buy

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Is that what they've learned?

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Hey, we've learned that we can get a lot of money

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
From people getting their accounts stolen

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
So we're just going to

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Add more things that they can buy

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Maybe some stuff for $500 instead

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
I don't know

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
How about putting some restrictions down

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Like Blizzard does on some of the digital

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Purchases when they're suspect

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
They don't go through for a few days

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
So that people have an easier time getting the money back

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Or doing the back charges and all this stuff

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
For the suspect things

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
How about a little more about the security side

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Of things and all that

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Well

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
The reality is

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Where we're at in this industry now

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
I just don't think that's possible

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Anymore

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
I think it's stupid though that they have a $60 game

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
That they're doing all these microtransactions on

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
I think it's ridiculous too

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
But unfortunately people are buying them

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
So

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
It's working

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
We need to hunt these people out

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
If people

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
We shouldn't tell people what to spend their money on

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
If people

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Legitimately are doing this

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
The other problem I have is that

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Probably 80% of that was all from stolen money

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
But

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Besides that

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
People can spend their money however they want

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
If they want to buy $60

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
For the game and then pay all this money

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
For the expansions

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Let them spend their money on it if that's what makes them happy

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Vote with your wallet

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
If you don't like it

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Don't buy it

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
But the problem is

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
My wallet was stolen and then used to vote

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
That's a problem

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Oh it's not our problem

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
It's not our issue

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
A year later

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Oh we've taken steps to try and make sure that won't happen again

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
It's never our issue in the first place

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Why would you need to take steps if there was not an issue with your

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
If it was all Microsoft

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
So I'd love to know

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Moving on

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Boy

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Dark Soccer you're right

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
The news tonight just makes us

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
There's so much to get angry about this week

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Let's close the show and go get Pinkberry

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
I thought you were having a healthy day

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
It's yogurt

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Trust me

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
You'd want to get that delicious new chocolate

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Hazelnut which isn't the best yogurt for you

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Anyway

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Ubisoft made an interesting statement this week

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
The CEO of Ubisoft

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
And I can't even say this name

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Yves

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Guillemot

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Guillemot

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Isn't the T usually silent

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Came out and said

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
That PC retail games

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Have a

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Gigantic rate of piracy

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
And this was

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Talking to games industry

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
At gamescom

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
He said that

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Only about 5-7%

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Of freemium players buy content

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Because

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Like the retail PC product

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
They have a quote

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
93-95% piracy rate

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
So he's basically saying retail PC games

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
93-95% piracy rate

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Some other comments quote

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
We also take content which we've

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Developed in the past graphics etc

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
And we can make cheaper games and improve them over time

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
What's very important is that we

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Change the content and make it a better fit

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
To the customer as time goes on

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
But still throwing that statistic out there

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
93-95%

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Piracy rate

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
That sounds really high

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
To a lot of people

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Well

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
I'm not so sure

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
I think there might actually be some truth to that number

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
You know why I think there's truth to that number?

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
I think if you're looking at

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Just the US

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
And Britain and Japan

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
And the rest of the UK

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Where Ubisoft or wherever in the world

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
They have a presence where they sell games

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Maybe that number seems high

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
But I mean

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Piracy is fucking rampant in other parts

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Of the world

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
I'm sure there's copies of these games

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Easily available in the most populous

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Country in the world

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
China! I'm sure there's tons of free copies

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Of these games roaming around in China

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
But when you throw in the worldwide

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Perspective into the mix

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
I could actually believe

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
The 93-95% piracy rate

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
But

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Some people are still

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Successful off that model

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
I'm not excusing it

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
I'm not saying it's okay

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
I'm just saying

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Numbers can lie, you have to manipulate them

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
It's not like piracy is anything new

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Or like it's never happened before

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
We've never had successful PC games

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
But before I believe any of those numbers

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
I'd have to see where the polls are

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
I mean where

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
I wouldn't trust

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Anything

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Numbers based on markets that wasn't made for

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
You're having a very I want to see the receipts

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Kind of night

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
I am, well you know I'm like that anyway

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
I'm like that anyway

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Loki what do you think of that number

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
93-95% piracy rate

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Seems a little high

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
I don't know

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Frisbee in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Says 85% of statistics

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Are made up on the spot

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Especially in this industry brother

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Alright one other note

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
About Ubisoft which is interesting

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Because Ubisoft previously

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Came out and said the game I Am Alive was never

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Going to come out on the PC basically

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Because there was no

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Other version

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Creative director Stanislaw Metra

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Came out and said about I Am Alive

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Quote we've heard loud and clear

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
That PC gamers are bitching about

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
There being no version for them

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Wow

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
But are these people

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Just making noise because there's no version

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Or because it's a game they actually want to play

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Would they buy it if we made it

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
It's hard because there's so much piracy

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
And so few people are paying for PC games

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
That we have to precisely weigh it up

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Against the cost of making it

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Perhaps it will only take 12 guys 3 months

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
To port the game to PC

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
It's a massive cost but it's still a cost

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
If only 50,000 people buy the game

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Then it's not worth it

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Only 50,000?

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Well to

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
I have to say to his credit

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
He does make a point

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
If it takes 12 guys

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
3 months to port the game

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Then using fractions

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
That would also be 3 guys 12 months

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Or 3 annual salaries

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
And let's say these guys make

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
I don't know 75k a year

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
So to just pay those 3 guys

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Is going to cost

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
225,000 dollars

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
And that's not even counting the cost to print the game

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
To market the game

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
To sell and all that stuff

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Make it all download content you don't have to pay for materials

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
I don't know

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
But there's some people

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
That would be like

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Viral marketing

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
I don't download games

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Because I have to have the tangible copy

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Then they lose out

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
You're a collector and all this shit

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Why?

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Hold on

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
I collect old shit Rob

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
I collect old things

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
I don't know it just doesn't make sense

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
This doesn't make sense coming from you

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
It really doesn't

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
My first 2 copies of Mass Effect were all download

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
The only reason I paid for a fiscal copy for 3

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Was because I got them to price match

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
And I would have

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
I would have done the download copy if it had been the same

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
So

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Let's make believe

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
I use Steam Rob

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
Let's make believe la la la

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
That the next Xbox and the next Playstation

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
And just making

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Pulling shit out of my ass

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
The Wii U all go digital only

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Digital download only

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
That's not a problem?

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Not really

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Honestly I'm going to say this is going into a little bit of my home stuff

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
We're thinking about downsizing

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
We have

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Shelves that are taken up with DVDs

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
And with you know

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Our current game collection

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
We have buckets of the old stuff

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
And the old stuff that's fine

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
But anything new

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
I really wouldn't mind having it

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
As a digital copy

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
I mean as long as I've got the software

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
The hardware to play it on then I wouldn't mind

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
You know it

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
It's less waste

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Less um

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
It's green Rob it's green

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
It's green

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
I'm a hippie

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
One more news story and then the release dates

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
So how about some

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Some persona

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Some persona

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
There is going to be

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Persona 4 the solid gold

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Premium edition

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
And it's going to be only

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
10,000 copies produced

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
But it will have a

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Hori hard cover pouch

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
A face cover

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Stickers and Vita skins

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
And 8 matching wallpapers

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
And it's going to be 70 bucks

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
And the first run copies

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Just to let people know

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Had just the skins and wallpapers and it was 40 bucks

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
So

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
For people who are persona fans

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Also just to let you know

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Only in Japan

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Of which there are a few

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
That won't stop many people I know

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
The bonus stuff that came out

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
With the solid gold edition

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Are the same ones that came out in Japan

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
No

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
No Europe

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Is intended

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
AlphaCananagram in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Says they are sold out on Amazon

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
For this persona for the golden kit

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Well yeah it's only 10,000 being made

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
That shows you how rabid the fans are

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
They've already sold it out

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
I know people that are really

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Really really into this game

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
There's no Europe that it's not coming out though

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Sorry guys

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Alright let's travel around the world

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000

Remasters of 1 and 2

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
And the PSP games

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Also

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Let's see here

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
We've got Ratchet and Clank

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Collection which is the HD

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Mix of the first

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
I think the first three Ratchet and Clank games

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Journey Collector's Edition

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
As I mentioned earlier that's on PS3 this week

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
As well

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
And

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
That's it

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Alright let's travel to Japan

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
And check out what's coming out over there

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
On the Xbox 360 Dirt Showdown

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
On August 30th

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
That's not like a dirt fighting thing

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Dirt of course is the racing series

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
So Codemasters is putting that out in Japan on the 30th

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
It pops the line from 2K games

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Those are both on the Xbox 360 in Japan

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
On the PlayStation 3

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
On the 30th quite a bit more

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
To pick from there's also Dirt Showdown

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
But you also can get

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Aqua Pazza Aqua Plus Dream

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Match in regular and limited edition

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Kamejigen Gamae

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Neptune 5 in limited and regular

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Edition from Idea Factory

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
From Capcom Sengoku

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Basara HD Collection comes out

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Over there

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
What game is that? What's Sengoku Basara?

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
It's Samurai Warriors

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
No it's not Samurai Warriors

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
It's their Dynasty Warriors clone

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Looks like it

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
No Sengoku Basara it's over here

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
It's a Capcom game

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Somebody in the chat will shout it out in a minute

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
I can't remember

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
It's on the tip of my tongue

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Devil

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Not Devil Kings

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Is that Devil Kings? No it's not Devil Kings

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Well look it up

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Well I read the rest of these

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Shadows of the Damned gets a price reduction from EA

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
This week as well

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Moving on

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
To the 3DS

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
The 3DS this week

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
It's Devil Summoner Soul Hackers

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
From Atlus

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
I think some people will be excited about that

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
And also

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Senran Kagura Burst

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Gurren no Shodutachi

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Comes out as well

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Devil Kings says hitstun

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Dynasty Warriors clone says AkumaJP

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
That's basically what it is

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Thank you

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
That's why I love having a live chat room

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Lastly

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
On the Playstation Vita

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Hatsune Miku

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Project Diva F

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
I teased that last week

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
You can get a whole damn Vita

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
There's a bundle coming out for Hatsune Miku

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
I'm poor

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
So you can check that out if you want

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
And that's the big release on the Playstation Vita

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
The game that will save the Playstation Vita

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Is out this week

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Let's go to the

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
United Kingdom

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
On the 28th we have

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Damage Inc Pacific Squadron World War 2

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Guild Wars 2

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Journey Collector's Edition for PS3

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
On the 29th we have Anomaly

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Joe Danger 2 the movie

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
And Rock Band Blitz

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
On the 31st we have Final Fantasy Dimensions

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
For the Android, iPad and iPhone

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
And Tales of Graces F

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
On PS3

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Alright just a couple more

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
news stories for you guys and then the classic

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
game of the week

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
But first, Loki

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Well we were talking about Facebook and how they

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
want to shove advertisements down our throat

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Well Sony has patented something to shove

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
advertisements down our throat

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
It's called a TV, no actually it's called

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Interactive TV Ads

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Which basically allow you

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
And I've actually kind of seen this

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
On some other websites, for example

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
One of the

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
interactive bits about it

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Like a McDonald's ad or something like that

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
You have to say McDonald's to end commercial

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
And if you say McDonald's

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Then the commercial ends, that type of thing

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
There's a website, as I talked

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
About a lot of Freddie Long

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
They do videos and stuff like that

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
They have a YouTube channel, but they have their own website

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Called RocketJump and their video player that they have

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
On there has ads, but to skip

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
The ads, you have to type a word in

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
So you can

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Watch the ad or you can type

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Ford Focus

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
And it'll stop the ad

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
So it's kind of like

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Okay, this way the

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Advertiser knows this person saw

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
The ad and it's not just like clicking on skip

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
They know what the product is

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
And they're aware of

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
What you're trying to do

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
That's kind of cool

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
I mean

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
I just don't know what sort of

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Things and games

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Are going to require advertisements

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Or commercials where I actually have to

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Say something in order to

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Have them go away, but

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
At least they have a way

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
For them to go away, I mean because if I could do that

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
On TV, it's like

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
You know, tampon commercial!

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
It's like, go

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Go away!

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
No!

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Um

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Yeah, I wish I could do the same thing

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
With male enhancement

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Commercials

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Big penis!

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
They have a pill to give a guy a boner, but no cure for breast cancer

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Just saying

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Well

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
I don't want to get into it, to be fair

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
The Viagra was not

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Made to do that

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
It was made for heart problems

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
But it just happened to have this side effect

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Oh, how's your heart?

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Boner!

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
That happens in the pharmaceutical industry

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
A lot of times

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Well, the medication I was taking for

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
My chronic fatigue syndrome

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Is actually what they all

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Prescribe for narcolepsy

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Isn't it kind of ironic though that they tell you that you shouldn't use Viagra

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
If you have heart problems?

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
You know, it's like

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Well, because it was for a certain type of heart condition

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
I'm not a doctor, I'm not going to try to explain it

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Anyhow

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Some folks in chat says

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Hitstun says adblock plus is made for

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Invasive ads like this

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
D Singe says thank god for ad and flash blockers

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
That's true in browsers

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
But when you're talking about being built in the

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Consoles, and you're assuming

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
This is going to be like streaming stuff

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Like I'm watching ad supported things

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Which, I mean, it's ad supported

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
It's like if I'm watching TV

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
And it's free, if you're on Hulu

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
If Sony's about to do something like the Kinect

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Where they're putting a microphone in your living room

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
You know, because think about it

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Microsoft's going to incorporate this into the Kinect right now

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Can you imagine if the Kinect would

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Interrupt you, for example, like you're talking about

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Man, I wish I

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Where do you want to eat tonight?

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Hey guys, were you talking

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
About eating somewhere?

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Oh my god, that's terrible, can you imagine

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
We're sitting here doing the show and Jamie's like

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Rob, let's just end the show and go to Pinkberry

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
And then suddenly up on the TV and all

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Did you know Pinkberry's latest flavor is chocolate

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Hazelnut

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
We laugh about that now, but that is the future

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
No, no, no

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
No, we have to put our foot

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Down, there's like

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
The whole big brother is watching you

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Here's the thing though

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
But that's targeted advertising

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
That's targeted advertising

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
You want to know about Pinkberry versus like

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
You want to know about natural male enhancement

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Or you want to know about

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
I don't need natural male enhancement

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
I have natural male enhancement

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
What's not natural about

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
You know, naked boobies

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
That's natural male enhancement

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Her turns you on

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Although I like boobies, but you know

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
They should have a strip club

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Named natural male enhancement

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
That would be pretty awesome

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Alright

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
R.D.G. Singe in chat says

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
I did that trick to block MS ad servers

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
From pushing ads on my Xbox system

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
But every now and then they get through

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Would be nice to know what to update

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
You know

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
We have ads on vognetwork.com

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
And you know

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
It isn't free to produce this stuff

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
We pay for a lot of this shit out of pocket

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Because it's our hobby

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
And it's what we like to do

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
But I just would really appreciate it

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
If you like the shows at vognetwork.com

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Just put it on the whitelist

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
For fuck's sake

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
We really tried to design things

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
To not be invasive

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Because we know like you guys

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
We don't want to be invasive

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
You're blocking the little guys too

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Click an ad every once in a while

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Visit the site

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Help us out

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
You can click the ad and then close the page

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Alright

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Moving on

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Technically I think encouraging people to do that

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Is like a violation of the whatever

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Don't be suspicious when you do it

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
They know that's what's going on

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Moving on

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
One more thing

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Maybe this is a little more exciting

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
This is a ranty and depressing

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
And sad segment of

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Orange Lounge Radio

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Well we're about to be off for a week

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
With something a little better

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
That is that Harmonix is apparently looking for

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
A combat designer

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
What?

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Harmonix of course makes rock band

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Dance central

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Yes apparently they've put up a job listing

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
And you can find it on Gamasutra

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
That is looking for a quote real time single player

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Combat experience for a brand new

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
IP on next generation hardware

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Bummer it's a brand new IP

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Because I was thinking the next Dance Central might

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Have like, you got served

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
I was thinking everybody's kung fu fighting

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Or you know

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
When you're a jet you know you're a jet

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
You know what it's capoeira game

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Who knows

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Anything's possible

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
In addition to finishing development

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
On rock band Blitz and Dance Central 3

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Harmonix is actively developing multiple new IPs

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
On next generation hardware

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
And looking for the best and most experienced devs

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Out there to join us

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
So obviously speculate away

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
What the hell could this be

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
You know a lot of people making up their own ideas

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
But I guess it's exciting at least they confirm

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
We're working on a brand new IP

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Is at least something I pull out of that

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
So yay new ideas right Dark Sakura

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Possibly it's Harmonix

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
But it's real time

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Single player combat

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
It's gonna be another fucking strategy game

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
But it's I don't

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Harmonix down as a company that would do

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Quote another fucking strategy game

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
You know what I mean

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Like Harmonix has a pretty good record of being innovative

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
I'll believe it when I see it

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
I am the queen of jade today

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
I wanna see the receipts

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
I just think it's ironic that a music game company

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Is working on an action game

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
That could be cool Tigerclaw in chat says

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Maybe Harmonix is working on a battle of the bands game

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
You're in a band and you actually have to battle each other

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
By hitting each other with musical instruments

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
That's been done on the Wii

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
It's terrible and it was called battle of the bands

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
And they literally had it where

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Your band equipment would turn into a mini gun

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Tigerclaw is gonna get taken to court

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Sued for 1.2 billion dollars

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
It's terrible

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Battle of the bands on the Wii

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
If you wanna have battles right away

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Yakuza 5 will have dance battles

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Cause you know

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Don't we just love minigame dancing

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
In every fucking game

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
So Yakuza 5

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Will have

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Well granted Yakuza has a lot of shit going on

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
So

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Maybe this isn't completely out of character

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
For the Yakuza series

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
But whatever they are doing

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Dance battles

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
And Yakuza 5

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
One of the subplots is about the adopted daughter

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Of Kazuma Kiryu

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
It's Haruka

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
She's trying to become an idol

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
So you'll do these dance battles

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
It's a little rhythm game

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
I could explain more about it

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Let's hope that Harmonics isn't working on

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
A step up revolution

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Game cause

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
She wants to be a pop idol so that her song will be featured

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
In the newest anime put out by Gainax

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Not really

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Can't wait

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
They have karaoke

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
And sleeping dogs

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Let's travel to a time when we didn't get so fucking mad

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
About everything

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Except this game, he got really mad at one of the bosses

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
I got mad when

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Nintendo Power arrived late

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Which by the way

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
More on that in part B

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
But first up

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
The classic game of the week

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Where Dark Sakura is going to

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Go into the gaming vault

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Find a game that she thinks

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Hey

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
If you're super depressed about all these studios closing

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Why not play some of the greats from the past

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Yeah if you're depressed

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Pretend you're a ninja

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
And slice shit to death

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
And blow shit up with ninja bombs

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
Go into denial

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Yeah go into denial

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
The game of the week is called Shadow of the Ninja

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Or as it was known in Japan

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Yami no Shigo

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Okay I'm going to mispronounce this

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
It's Yami no Shigotonin Kage

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Which is

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Dark Professional Shadow

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
That's actually a cooler name

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
So basically it's a futuristic

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Ninja themed side scroll

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Arcade action type game

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
And I am trying to get the

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Audio up but um

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Remember when Natsume didn't do Harvest Moon?

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
No actually I don't

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
This was a game by Natsume

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
Um

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
It came out in Japan in 1990

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
And came out in North America in 1991

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
The PAL version was published by Taito

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Under the name Blue Shadow

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Which is actually a pretty cool name

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Oh cause he's blue

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Well yeah but also there was this big thing

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
In the 80's and early 90's in

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
England where you couldn't

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Have Ninja in the title

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Like for example Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Was Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Rob did you know that?

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
I did know that

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Well Natsume also did a Game Boy version

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Of this however

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
It actually got picked up by

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Tecmo and they tried to make it into

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
A Ninja Gaiden game called Ninja Gaiden

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Shadow which is sort of half Shadow

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Of the Ninja and half Ninja Gaiden

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
And 100% kind of crap

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Maybe about 85% crap

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
So

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Basically the story of the game is that

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
In 2029

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
The evil dictator

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Emperor Garuda

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Which means eagle by the way did you know that?

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
What?

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Well it actually

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
In Hindi it means eagle

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
I learned that from doing yoga

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Has taken over the USA

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
And made a

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
A big

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Stronghold in the middle of the nations

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Largest city

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
So these two Ninja Hayate and Kaede

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Have to go

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Infiltrate the Stronghold and kill him

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
To death

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
So it is

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Up to two players simultaneous

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Or you can pick one or the other

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Like I said Hayate or Kaede

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
And

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
You can

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
There's actually no difference

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Between who you play really

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
But they just look differently

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Um

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
And uh

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
You uh

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Basically you can run

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
You can crouch, you can climb ladders

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
You can actually hang from

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Certain areas overhead

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Including a lot of the moving platforms you can do that too

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Um

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
And you actually can get

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
You can build up your weapon over time too

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
They have special attacks

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
One of them is a thunderstorm

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
That will just damage all the on screen enemies

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
But it takes half your life to do it

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
It actually is quite possible to play this whole game

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Without using any of that

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Um your default weapon is katana

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Um however you can also get um

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Kusarigama

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
It has a longer range but the um

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Katana will actually get a full screen range

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Once it's fully powered up and

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Everyone really likes it better

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
You also can get some limited use items

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
You get shuriken or um

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
What my husband calls the ninja bomb

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Which is

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Just some sort of hand grenade

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Um

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
And then once you use up your

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
You know number of those

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
You actually go back to either using the um

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Katana or the Kusarigama

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
For anyone who doesn't know what that is

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
It's a hook on a rope

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Um it has five levels

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Um totaling 16 stages

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
The first four are in three stages

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
The final one is in two

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
And uh you have your bosses

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
You have your mini bosses

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
And uh

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
You um when you beat a boss

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
It explodes but the explosion heals you

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
And you can

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
That way you can carry over life into the next level

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
If your um

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Your game uh

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Your game will actually be over if you lose

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
All of your energy and you only have

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Five continues um

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
If you have two players in the game your continues are shared

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
So I hope you play with someone who doesn't suck

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
But I mean the game was

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Really awesome when it came out

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
And I mean just

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
Sit and watch a play through of this

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
Or play it yourself if you've got it

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
It's got neat effects

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Great animation for a NES game

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
The music, Bob Trump's the music if you don't mind

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
The music is really good

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
And it's totally

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Worth everyone's attention

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
It has an old Mega Man feel to it a little bit

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
A little bit

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
In fact there are actually these little enemies

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
That you know slide across the floor

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Slowly but when you're on the floor they move faster

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
You know it totally made me think of some Mega Man 2 enemies

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Let me um go to part

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
One here of the little series here

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Just to um

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Get like the first level music

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
I guess they're waiting for

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Here's one two

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
It's pretty cool

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
It's a really neat game

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
And on top of that you can find it really inexpensive

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
In a used game store

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
It's a game that I think everyone should have in their collection

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Yeah the American box art

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Is stupendously hokey looking

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
It's like ooh action game

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
With a couple of

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Ninja who look you know uh

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Amazingly white

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
So but it really is a very

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Very good game and I totally recommend

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Everyone you know shell out the

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Five to ten bucks it is at your

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Local used video game store

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
There it is a classic

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Game of the week Shadow of the Ninja

From someone who has something to say about Wii U

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000

I miss that show By the way that

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
If you want to know my favorite TV show of all time

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Of all time ever and it's on

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Netflix It's on Netflix?

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Oh yeah Strangers with Candy

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
The most amazing

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
30 episodes 30

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
30 minute episodes what when it's

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Cut out the commercials like 23 minutes

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
So put it together most amazing

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
600 minutes of your life

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
That's what you should do Labor Day weekend make it a point

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
To watch every episode of Strangers with Candy

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Because it's the greatest sitcom

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
I've ever seen in my life it's not even really a

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Sitcom but it's

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Look Steven Colbert's in it before he had

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
That Colbert rapport and he's

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
He is my absolute inspiration as an

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Educator

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Where's your permission slip Mr.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Fucking amazing

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Now I'm going to be thinking

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000

Alright let's get into some rapid

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000

News stories for you guys before we get to

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
The Facebook and Google question of the week

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Or the FUGL question of the week

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
First off Loki Microsoft wants to let you know

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
That the Kinect has dropped in price to

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
$109.99 that's $40

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
Cheaper than it was

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
When it first came out

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
The games being better though

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
Maybe not so much

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
But hey

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
That's pretty inexpensive

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
So check it out

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
If you want to connect I guess

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
The Humble Bundle for

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
Android they've added some new stuff to it

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
If you pledge over the average

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Price which

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Right now I have no idea what the price is

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Because I did not look

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
But it's probably under $10

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
6.71 you can't beat that

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
If you pledge $6.71

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Not only will you get the games

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
That they were offering which were Field Runners

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Bit.Trip Beat

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
Space Chem and Uplink

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
And you would have previously unlocked

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
Spirits but you also will now

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Unlock World of Goo, Osmose

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000

So all those games available

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
For Android and for PC

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
They're multi platform so you get the

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Steam codes as well as the

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
DRM free downloads

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
For all that stuff

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Actually I should

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Correct myself

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
To get the Steam codes you have to pay another

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
You have to pay over $1 so

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Obviously if you're paying over the average

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
You would get the Steam codes

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Check them out! Sounds awesome

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
And then

That wonderful Scott Pilgrim online

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
I don't know why but

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
That's unfortunate

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
And I guess the Playstation Network version

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Will also release during that time frame as well

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Alright moving on with some other

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Stories

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
I wish I could

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
But my internet is slowing down

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
And I don't have to slow down

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Something's up with our web

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
We suddenly just lost our web

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Mine just plain hasn't worked today

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
I don't know what's going on

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
But um

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Awkward pause

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
I wonder if we just had a stream

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Hiccup because of that

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Let me look

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
No we're still connected

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
The joys and pains

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Of doing live radio that's alright I have a few things

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Here for you guys

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Mashihiro Sakurai you know that name because he's the

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Director of Super Smash Brothers

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
He mentioned at the CEDEC

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
Developer conference in this past week

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
That the Smash Brothers game on Wii U

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
And 3DS will have new and exciting

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Moves for existing characters

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
He also mentioned there will be

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Of course a bunch of new characters

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Now will come the epically

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Long tease of which characters

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Will be there and which characters

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Won't be there and so on and so on

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
But uh sounds like they are gonna

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
Expand the move set a little bit I'm wondering if that

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Means there's gonna be more than two buttons from here

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
On out for Smash Brothers that could be interesting

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Speculate away

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
Because lots of people already

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
Are still button Mash Brothers

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
I bet um this

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Is gonna piss some people off

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
This is coming from

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
A former 3D modeler that worked

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
At Rare on games like Donkey Kong 64

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Jet Force Gemini

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
And so forth apparently

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Rare did want to do a new Killer

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Instinct game but Microsoft

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Was more interested in broadening the Xbox

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
User base quote the same

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Game every Rare fan wants to see and that's

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Killer Instinct 3 we all wanted to

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Make Killer Instinct 3 but Microsoft

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Was more interested in broadening their demographic

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Than making another fighting game

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
So it never got made I doubt

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
It never will

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Microsoft F you

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Alright this last story isn't loading

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
For me but I remember it pretty well

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Anyway cause this is another story that made a lot of people

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Say F you

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
That is that they are making

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Remember that whole countdown they were doing

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
For The World Ends With You

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
And a lot of people were like oh yay it's gonna be a

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Sequel yay

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Nope no sir it's an

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
IOS port of the game is coming out

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Next week and I believe the

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
Price on it is $20

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Square Enix likes to

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
Charge more money for their games than 99 cents

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
To be fair they don't shove

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
The free to play model down

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Your throat make you buy power ups and all that

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
So at least for your 20 bucks

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
You're getting a well rounded game and I gotta say

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
Some of their iPad

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
Games and such look great like their

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy 2 ports

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
That they did on the original iPhone kind of before there was

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
iPad looked great on the iPhone

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
So you know

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
I'm sure the game will look really good

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
But I don't know

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
Again the lack of tactile controls

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
I think is what frustrates a lot of people

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Like we don't really want to see

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Games like The World Ends With You get ported

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
To IOS because touch

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Controls kind of suck on a lot of these games

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
At least I know that's what frustrates me

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Yeah and then um

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
20 bucks is still pretty expensive

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
For anything that's on

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
You know IOS

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
I think for that reason because it's you know

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
You're kind of

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Gimping the game a little bit

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Not everything is 99 cents I was just looking at iPad

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Apps today and some of the better selling

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
iPad apps are the official Apple

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
You know versions of

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
What is it Keynote is like their PowerPoint

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Type thing is one of their top sellers

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
It's $9.99

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
GarageBand does very well, it's a $5 app

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
So there's you know

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
$5 and $9.99 versus $20

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Is still a bit much

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Well

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
But how much did it cost on the DS?

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Probably closer to

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
$35

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
Technically it was free

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
Well it's been out for a while now

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
I mean you can buy on the DS for

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
Probably less than 20 bucks

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
Now that I'd agree with yes

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
So that's my issue

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
With that is if you know it's been

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
Out for a while I mean they can put it at 20 bucks

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
But it doesn't mean everyone's gonna buy it for that

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Well look I'm gonna admit and this might like

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Ruffle some feathers or whatever but

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
I actually didn't play this game on DS

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
I just didn't get around to it you know

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
We don't have time to play every single game

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
So um

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
I don't know if I would necessarily go out of my way

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
To check it out on IOS

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
But I know there are some fans of this game

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
And are really hoping it will result in a sequel

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
It does make me think oh I need to go back

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
And try the one on DS so

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
We'll see and um

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Shima panic in our chat room

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
Says the world ends with you DS

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Was $40 at launch

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Thank you

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
$40 so I think mine's actually

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
Still in my DS makes 20 not seem so bad

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Alright uh let's move on

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Dark Sakura

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Well um XSeed put out an announcement

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
That Ragnarok Odyssey is gonna have two

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
Editions to choose from

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
The first one is a standard that's only the game

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
And then the mercenary edition that comes with the soundtrack

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
A mercenary guide that's sort of

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
An art book and strategy guide

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
And monster cards um

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
10 random ones the standard edition is

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
$40 and the mercenary edition is

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
$50 so depends on how much money

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
You wanna spend for stuff that'll collect dust later

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
Don't know

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
And for fans of DS

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
There is a song list out for

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Dance Central 3

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
Nine new songs actually are coming out

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
There's um

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
Afrojack featuring Eva Simmons

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Takeover Control

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Alexandra Stan, Mr. Saxo Beat

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Half the shit I haven't heard of

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
I know that song

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
It's a total gay bar

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
song I don't know how else to phrase it

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
Sierra featuring Missy Elliott

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
One Two Step, Cupid with Cupid Shuffle

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Daft Punk, Around the World, I love Daft Punk

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Dev featuring the, what band

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
Is gonna call themselves the Cataracts

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Hi, I'm an eye disease

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Based down low

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Inna featuring Natasha

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
I guess is how it's supposed to be

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Calabria 2008

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Martin Solvig featuring

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Dragonette, Hello

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
That song's cute, I like that song

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
The Tramps, Disco Inferno

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
I fucking love Disco Inferno

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Cause I was a little kid

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
With my Saturday Night Fever soundtracks

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Freaking dancing on my bed to Disco Inferno

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Any song that has

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Burn Baby Burn in the lyrics

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
Totally down for it

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Around the World

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
is gonna be awesome

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
Oh and last but

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
never least

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
There is a survival game coming up by

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Can I read a comment from Stan

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
in our chat room? What band would call themselves

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Anthrax?

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Well no one ever accused

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
metal bands of having much in the way of intelligence

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
They're probably

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
on heroin

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
True statement

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
Allegedly

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
I like Anthrax actually

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Who doesn't like Anthrax

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
But you have to be in a certain mood

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
for Anthrax

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Anthrax is just fun, anyway

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Anyway

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
The developer

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
Clay Entertainment that did Shank

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Is doing a survival game called Don't

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Starve that has a closed beta

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
available to those who pre-order the game

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
for a whopping $7

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
I hear the closed beta

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
is in Africa

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Africa?

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Because that's a game that they play all the time

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Don't Starve

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Anyway

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
It's gonna be $15 when it comes

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
to Steam so you're pretty much getting it for

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
77% off if you

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
order it ahead of time

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
The demo is on the official

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
site so you can give it a try

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
for free. It's about a

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
gentleman scientist who has to go to the

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
wilderness world of a demon

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
and he just doesn't starve

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
So it's like Tokyo Jungle with

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Minecraft

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
I guess

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
I'm gonna buy it $7 why not

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
I can afford that

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
Sounds cool

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Is that it?

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Indeed. You don't have to break things

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
It's done

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
Alright

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Let's travel to the

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
FUGL question of the week

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
What is the FUGL question of the week?

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Facebook and Google Plus

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
Slam them together and you get FUGL

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Which I know is ironic considering the first

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
half of our show but look

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
We've never been one to turn away

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
ways to participate with our listeners

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
and this is just one other way to participate with listeners

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
But I'm gonna start with Google Plus

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
Here's the question

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
Actually we got more

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
answers on Google Plus than we usually do

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
I know look I had to scroll

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
to see them all

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Here it is on

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
FUGL question of the week

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
This is about the world ends with you

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
getting announced for iOS to extremely missed reaction

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
What game would you actually

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
like to see ported to mobile

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
phones, iOS, Android, whatever

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
your choice is or would you

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
be perfectly happy if we never had another

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
port of a classic game again

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
And of course we expect the listeners

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
to give us a little bit of why

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Canaxium said anything

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
puzzle strategy or turn based

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
The controls wouldn't suffer much which is important

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
for the smartphone transition

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
Those kinds of games would also be a lot easier

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
to set aside with little notice

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Revenge of the Titans would be a blast

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Redertainment

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
has a very get off my

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
lawn approach. What happened to the good

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
old days when phones were phones

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
music players were music players and gas

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
cost under $2

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
That being said, Portal

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
I would like to see the classic game Portal

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
ported to mobiles just to see

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
the spectacular ways that game would crash

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
my phone and drain my battery like a

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
vampire. Classic? Well, yes

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
it is now a classic

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
No

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Ok, 10 years from now

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
In 10 years, yeah, it'll be a classic

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Alright, maybe I shouldn't have said classic

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
game in the question because I think Portal

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
is a fine answer. But anyway, also

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Tetris, not the version available

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
now that required swiping. A version

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
of Tetris with button based controls that I can

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
play on the go seems like a great idea to me

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Yes, I remember the Tetris DS exists

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
but I want to play competitively and my

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Wi-Fi at home sucks

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Jim replied saying

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
I would love to see a port of Deja Vu

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
utilizing the touch controls of course

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Remember those old ass PC

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
games like Shadow, was it

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Shadowrun? No, Shadowrun is the other game

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
Shadowkeep

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
I'm the one that likes Loom, so

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
No, I remember, but Deja Vu

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
and then there was another one, The Uninvited or something like that

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
there was a whole trilogy of them that was on

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
the NES and they were originally Mac games

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
if I remember right. Shadowgate

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Shadowgate was freaking hard

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
God

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
Shadowgate had an amazing

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
soundtrack though, oh my god

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
I seriously, have you ever done Shadowgate as the classic game of the week

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
if not, you really need to think about it. I never really was

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
a fan of Shadowgate to be honest

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
I'm doing it a week you're gone then

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
I'll do it, I mean

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
I know a lot of people like it

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
Can I play some epic music from Shadowgate real quick? Sure

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
I just love the music of Shadowgate

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
I like this music

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
But then like, the death music

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
was really freaky

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
Like, shit

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
I died

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Harpsichord furnace

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Anyhow

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
Moving on

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
to Rababababa

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Says Donkey Kong for iCade

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
It was the original April Fools joke

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
and it sold me on the iCade

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
If Nintendo ever released on

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
iOS phones, it should start with their

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
80s arcade games

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Let's see

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
ActDeft replied, despite me hating

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
on the iOS port of The World Ends With You

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
I would really like to see Viva Pinata

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
on mobile. The game is great to play

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
for short amounts and it will keep you really occupied

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
playing it. Interesting, he takes an approach

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
that's not about controls, but about the way

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
we play games

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
And maybe a game like Viva Pinata in short

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
bursts is better suited for

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
mobile phones

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
How would you feel about Animal Crossing on mobile phones?

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Monitoring my village

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
That would be crack

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
It would be, wouldn't it?

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
So

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Alright, let's see

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Oh, I'm just looking at our chat room

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Dungeon Buster agrees, Shadowgate rocked

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
Chigurh said, we have a copy of Shadowgate

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
It was awesome

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Hitstun says, it's a sad

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
thing that your frugal questions have come to

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
an end here

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
That's a death joke

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
Alright, moving on

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Tiara, hi Tiara

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Geek-Life.com, wonderful site

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Please visit it. Tiara from Geek-Life

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
replies and says

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
This is Facebook now, by the way

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
They're already on every other

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
type of console ever, so I'd love an

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
iOS port of Final Fantasy 4 and Final

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
Fantasy 6. I have the original

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy Tactics on

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
my iPhone, and I love being able to play

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
them when I'm on the subway or looking for something

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
quiet to do while my hubby is working on law school

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
stuff. It's great having old classics

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
that I love at my fingertips without

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
having to carry around anything larger than my phone

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
You know, Tiara, they did, you might

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
already know this, but they did a really good port of Final

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Fantasy 3, the DS version

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
that's on the iPhone

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
I've been playing that. It's a pretty decent port

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
all things considered

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
So they did a DS

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
Final Fantasy 4

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
So a lot of us are actually kind of waiting

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
like, when would that come over

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Final Fantasy 3 style to the iPhone

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
That would be kind of neat to see. I thought they already did that

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Well, they did that for the DS4

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
They did 4 for the DS, but they didn't port that

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
to the iOS yet, you know

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
Which I'm sure some people, not everybody's a fan of

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
And plus, I don't know, like

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
There was a lot I liked about the DS

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
remake, and there was a lot I just

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
I didn't, just, it was just

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
weird seeing the sprite

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
based game I used to love in the 3D

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
environment was so weird

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
But then again, I would love

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
to see that opera scene from 6 redone

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
You know, there's

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
things I'd like

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
Zethurb says, Time Crisis

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
Touch controls for a light gun game

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
just sound right. That actually

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
does sound like a really good idea

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
I've already done that

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
Did they do Time Crisis? I believe they did

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
Oh, well, maybe Zethurb needs to go check the store

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
How about Point Blank then?

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
How about Point Blank? I was gonna say Point Blank would be awesome

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Great fucking suggestion

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
Nick M. replies and says

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
I would love a port of the original

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
Worms Armageddon, not a sequel because

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
Team 7 has screwed up every Worms game since

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
I chose this game because the gameplay

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
and fun factor would not be affected by

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
touch controls. I could see that

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
I'm sure there's Worms clones, there's gotta be

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
Worms all over the marketplace already

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
Um

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
Allen replied and said

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Troll answer. Steel battalion

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
Serious answer

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
I think the Panzer Dragoon

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
games would clean up nice and make great

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
use of tilt controls. Res would be great

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
too. Steer with tilt and drag

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
finger for linking targets. That's

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
surprisingly not a bad idea

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
Good job, Allen

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Matt replied, Matt J. replied on Facebook

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
with a no. We're finally seeing some no's

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
I personally feel we should

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
not port various titles to mobile platforms

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
These platforms are not designed

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
with these games in mind. Virtual

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
controls simply do not work

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
most of the time. My favorite iOS

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
titles have been built from the ground up for mobile

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
platforms. Games which were designed

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
with physical controls in mind, which

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
specific hardware in mind just don't translate

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
well to the ever changing mobile platforms

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
I agree with what some have said

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
The World Ends With You is worth $20

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
It's worth $20 on the DS

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
It's not worth $2 on iOS

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
It will not be as good of an experience

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
A good example is

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
Grand Theft Auto 3. I got it from my

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
iPad. I've yet to beat the very first mission

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
for the horrible car controls just drive

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
me nuts. I beat the same game

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
years back on the PC. Loved it

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
I'm just glad I only paid a buck for

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
Grand Theft Auto 3 iOS

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
Did they ever do Dragon's Lair?

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
Yes. I'm sure they did

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
I was just thinking that one would be perfect

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
I'm gonna quickly go through some of these other ones

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
I'll just read kind of the game

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
or whatever

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
no

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
in a nutshell because IOS will fuck it up

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
like they fuck up most games

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
Locopoco replied saying

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
a mobile version of the adventure game

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
The Neverhood point and click adventure games

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
would be great ported and he's not

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
happy about the Square Enix

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
World Ends With You remake

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
Stan replied a new chapter to the Space Channel

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
5 series

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
for IOS or for anything

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
Hitstun said

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Missile Command and Crystal Castles

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
work great on multi-touch phones

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
You know they do have that in the Atari

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
thing. I think he said

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
I think he knows that because he says they work great

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
on multi-touch phones. What about Marble Madness?

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
That's a good idea too

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
He does say more faithful ports

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
of classic trackball games

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
Marble Madness. There he is

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Marble Madness he says. An arcade perfect port

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
Capcom Bowling would be a

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
natural too. Maybe we could get

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
a port for the Japanese only

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
Sega Sonic the Hedgehog

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
There's a game called Manic Marble

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
Lastly I'm not sure what Clover Nikon means by

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
this comment. LucasArts Outlaws

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
first person shooter. Was that a game? LucasArts

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
I don't know the game Outlaws. Is that a

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
LucasArts game that I'm just not ringing a bell?

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
Because I think LucasArts I think of the

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
old strategy games

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
like Loom

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
and Indiana Jones and shit

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
and Maniac Mansion and all that

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
I'm looking right now

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
Of course I'm sure the chatters at live.vognetwork.com

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
will be happy

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
to correct me in a minute

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
I'm looking right now

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Let's see

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
Outlaws yeah shooter game for the Commodore 64

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
I'll be damned

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
1985 and 1997 there were different releases

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
That's not the one

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
The 1997 release must be the one he's talking about

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
Yes it was LucasArts and the Jedi Engine

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
I didn't know this game at all

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
Now I want to look it up

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
Was it Jedi Outlaws?

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
No it was done in that Jedi Engine

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
Let me look

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
The first person shooter one that was from 1997

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
or whatever

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
I'm looking it up right now

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
except YouTube won't work

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
so I'll have to look later

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
Alright

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
anything quickly you guys would like to

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
see on iOS or not

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
Second point blank

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
Yeah

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
A real Marble Madness I guess

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
I'd like a Marble Madness sequel

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
type of thing

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Maybe a better version of Silent Hill

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
and Metal Gear Solid those shooters

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
On iOS though

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
I can't see Silent Hill on iOS

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
They had a Silent Hill

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
iPhone game and it was terrible

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
It was like the old Sega shooter games

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
Any of the Sega shooters would be pretty cool

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
Like um

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
Uh

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
I'm trying to think of what I was thinking here

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
Gunblade

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Gunblade would be fucking awesome

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
Also

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Yeah it was any of the shooters

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
Any of their

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
arcade stuff

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Alright I knew the chatters wouldn't let me down

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
VxJsonXV says Outlaws was quite fun indeed

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
I think I bought it at some point

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
and sucked at it a lot for some reason

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
Dungeon Buster says

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
Outlaws cutscenes had the same animated look

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
that Full Throttles did only stylized

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
for a western adventure

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Um

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Tykey in our chat reminds us there was Marble Madness

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
too it was called Marble Man

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
Marble Man I don't think that ever actually came out

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
though it's like a prototype thing one of those like

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
legendary games right

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
Alright S2 under Matt says this sounds like a listless

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
topic alright maybe

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Maybe next time maybe next time

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Alright let's get some more news out of the way Loki

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Alright so um

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
It's unfortunate but

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
Nintendo Power is coming to an end

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
their last issue will be running in December

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
and unfortunately

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
they just have no plans

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
on continuing it any further than that

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
and you know before you know they were

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
you know running it

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
through in house stuff

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
but then it was

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
forwarded to future publishing in

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
2007 and

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
that's that

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
just I guess

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
not print media is just not

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
as popular anymore as it used to be

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
um and then of course Nintendo is

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
going to be getting their news out slightly

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
differently can I just say this real quick

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
about Nintendo Power though because like I saw a lot

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
of the people on Twitter and Facebook were saying like

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
oh this makes me really sad

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
I used to love this magazine as a kid

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
and oh I remember when I had

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
Nintendo Power and it's just kind of funny like I

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
you know and while it is sad in a way

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
I think you're really sad that you're getting older

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
because nobody said

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
oh I'm really sad it's going away because

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
I'm currently subscribed

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
nobody said that

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
like I think a lot of people are just sad

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
because it's a relic from their childhood

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
it's no longer there but

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
hello they went bankrupt because nobody was still

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
subscribed anybody in here subscribed to

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
Nintendo Power currently? Nope

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
and let's be real it's changed

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
hands over the years and so forth and there is no

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
more Howard and Nestor

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
it's just it's tough for a

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
print magazine to survive right now

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
it's tough I would have loved for an ebook

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
that makes me so sad

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
because that's like what I went to school

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
for

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
got to evolve into the digital format

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
wouldn't it have been great on the Wii U tablet

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
you could have flipped through pages or something

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
it would have been awesome

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
so to get the word out about the Wii U

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
release date and pricing September

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
13th they're going to be doing another

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
press event

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
they're going to be talking about it it's going to be held in

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
New York City and

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
at least that's assumed what they're going to be talking about

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
is Wii U pricing and release

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
date

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
$249 for $349

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
and November 18th

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
we'll see

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
that's just a guess

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
allegedly

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
the titles that were released on the 20th

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
now move to the 13th

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
alright we'll see

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
alright moving on

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
you remember Adventure on the Atari 2600

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
I mean back in the days

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
of the Atari 2600 where we had games like

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
baseball

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
basketball

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
video pinball

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
we had Adventure and a lot of people remember

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
Adventure because it was the very first game to have an Easter egg

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
or at least a prominent Easter egg

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
which had the hidden designer's name

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
in it because if you want to go way back

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
go back to a time where designers

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
would not get credit for games and sometimes it would leave

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
them a little frustrated so you could find

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
that in Adventure well also

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
Adventure was just kind of a neat little game that

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
a lot of games like you see things in

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
Adventure that influence the Legend of Zelda

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
for real like a lot of what comes

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Legend of Zelda was in Adventure on the

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
Atari 2600 and therefore it has

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
its fans and

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
more than 30 years later we're looking at

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
yet another sequel to Adventure

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
now I believe there was a prototype some time

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
ago of Adventure 2 but that's not

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
part of the canon that we have

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
now what we do have is

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
that in 2009 there was Evil Magician

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
Returns which was

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
programmed by Bite Knight from the

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
Atari Age forums and he did this in

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
2009 and this is in reference to

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
the unseen antagonist who

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
stole and hid the chalice in the original game

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
he didn't have the rights to call it

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
Adventure 2 but he could call it Evil Magician

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
hooray generic bad guy

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
well now Evil Magician

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
Returns 2

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
ahhhh

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
he's back bitch

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
you have to overcome both

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
him and his apprentice

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
they are personally guarding the chalice

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
keys, mages

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
mazes, flickering

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
grottos and bats

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
and it has

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
come out yes it is an adventure

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
game there has to be an easter egg in there

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
somewhere so be on the lookout for that

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
you know I gotta say this

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
for an Atari 2600

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
game the graphics are pretty sweet

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
I know you're looking at this

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
picture of the game and laughing at me but

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
hello remember what the original

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
adventure looked like like this is a step up

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
I love that people are still

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
programming for the Atari 2600

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
of course

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
ROMs allow them to make the

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
games however big they want

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
I don't think this is actually getting printed on

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
a cartridge no but

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
it's just neat that there's still all that

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
love for the Atari 2600

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
so there you go

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
Dark Sakura?

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
well for those who are still

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
playing Diablo 3 and I know that there are

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
da da da

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
there is

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
going to be new upgrade levels

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
for all of those who have reached your level cap

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
it's called the

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Paragon system which has nothing to do

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
with Mass Effect

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
has 100 additional levels

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
for you to push through once you meet

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
the current level max

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
it's coming in update 1.0.4

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
and basically all of your

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
experience that you get after 60

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
will be put into your Paragon levels

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
so it gives you a boost in your core stats

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
and

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
an extra 3% boost

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
in magic and gold find

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
also

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
there is this

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
trying to find

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
where exactly it was

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
the Nephilim Valor bonuses

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
will also give a 15% boost

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
in experience towards the Paragon levels per stack

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
so fun

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
I love that they

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
made the end game more exciting by basically

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
adding 100 levels

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:07.000
pretty much

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
apparently there is some game balance things and other things

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
they did too, like we talked about this on

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:12.000
Horde House a little bit

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
and Extifer has been playing a lot of Diablo

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
lately because he's not really playing WoW right now

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
but him and his partner play a lot

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
of Diablo and he says

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
it's great that the game balancing and everything is great

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
me, I haven't touched Diablo since like the first

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
month it came out but maybe

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
I need to take a second look after

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
WoW and Guild Wars

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
and all that other stuff

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
free with blood packed

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
which you can't sign up for anymore

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
just a couple more news stories for you guys

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
in the mailbag

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
mailbag at orangesloungeradio.com is where the emails

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
go but first some more stories

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
alright

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
now this is kind of interesting

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
you remember that whole

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
Peter Molyneaux thing that they were doing

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
on the iOS platform where it was

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
basically this

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
curiosity is what the game is called

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
and it was kind of controversial

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
because you can buy

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
in-game things to help you

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
chip away at this cube faster including

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
one piece that's $50,000

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
or $5,000

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
so anyways that game's been delayed

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
to September and

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
also because it's been delayed

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
I'm not sure if this is the reason but

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
they had to change their title because

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
you may remember there was a certain

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
program from NASA that landed

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
a rover on Mars named

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
Curiosity and

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
yeah that was kind of

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
bad so now it's

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
that wasn't bad

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
no it was bad for Curiosity because

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:37.000
they couldn't use the name

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
bad for Peter Molyneaux but fuck him

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
so now it's not just Curiosity

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
it's Curiosity what's in the

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
cube or what's inside the cube

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
is what it's called

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
WHAT'S IN THE BOX

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
TELL ME WHAT'S IN THE BOX

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
anyone?

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
pretty much yeah

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
you don't get seven

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
so they have that going on right now

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
I gotta wonder though

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
when is the next Apple announcement

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
for iOS 6 isn't that supposed to be

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
in September sometime?

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
the iPhone 5 announcement is heavily rumored

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
for September 12 which is just

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
a few weeks away really

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
and I'm assuming that's probably when we're gonna see iOS 6

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
oh absolutely yeah

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
iOS 6 was the one that had that patch in it

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
or they're supposed to be patching that loophole right now

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
where you can get free DLC

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
probably they wouldn't want to

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
release that game that has

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
$5,000 or $50,000 DLC

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
when there's a loophole to get that for free

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
wouldn't you think?

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
that might kind of skew the way the game's played

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
just the thought

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
I thought they were able to

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
fix that I thought they patched it

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
somewhere on the back end

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
Chiggers in our chat says

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
dick in a box

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
that would be fucking hilarious

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
actually Peter Molyneaux

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
would gain my ultimate

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
respect if what's in the box

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
my dick

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
that would

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
make headlines

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
I mean you'd have

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
to have a real egotistical person

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
to pull a stunt like that

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
you could do it

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
how would you feel Dark

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
Sakura if you opened the box

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
because you were curious and

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
it's his dick

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
I'm just getting blinked at

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
I feel short changed

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
alright moving on

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
Konami is set to shake the industry

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
god damn it

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
what is wrong with our web tonight?

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
alright I remember this story from earlier though

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
Konami is

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
I forget who said it in an event

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
I want to say it was Kojima

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
somebody involved with Kojima Productions

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
because there's an announcement coming up

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
from Metal Gear's 25th anniversary

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
and they were quoted in saying

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
Ken Mandaza

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
with Kojima Productions

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
that was quoted in saying

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
that the industry

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
is going to get shaken up

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
yeah they have a lot of things to look forward to

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
next week not just for fans

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
but I think the industry is going to be shook

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
they're going to be able to present here

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
at least it's not a Frogger game

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
that's all I know

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
oh I finally got it here

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
I was going to say my internet is working just fine

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
I don't know

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
it's because I streamed the show and all that off this computer too

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
but anyway we will find out what the shakedown is

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
August 30th

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
when this event

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:45.000
is placed there at Tokyo Midtown

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
alright whatever

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
moving on

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
DarkSakura dives into the mailbag head first

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
on a deserted island

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
let's make believe there's a bike

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
that will power it

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
answer too late

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
power pad games

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
dance aerobics

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
humps master

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
ok greetings orange

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
knowledge radio this is a message from

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
hasseo sumi ragawa

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
regarding final fantasy and their rampant cases

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
of disappearing acts yeah we oh this is

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
what we covered ok so six years

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
ago square enix announced final fantasy

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
versus 13 as part of the fabula

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
nova crystallis and since then

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
they put out a few trailers

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
talking about the stories a bit

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
and six years later there's nothing because it came out in japan

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
um there hasn't even

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
been present at e3

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
but that's not my point

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
now last november square announced that they were

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
going to release final fantasy 10 again and needless to

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
say I squeed my voice horse

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
um after that nothing so this

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
brings me to my point is there going to be

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
is this going to be a trend with square

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
announce the games that won't come out for years and years and let's

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
face it look at what happened to duke nukem

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
forever oh that game was

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
crap um one last note

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
to lookies I'm aware you're

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
smart with modding and

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
computers correct okay so

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
two questions firstly

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
um my boyfriend's computer

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
doesn't have the programs installed onto his computer

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
is there a way to fix that I don't

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
it says

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
sorry for bad grammar but honestly the grammar

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
is so bad that I can hardly make heads or

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
tails of the lines

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
doesn't have the programs

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
installed I

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
guess to mod then

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
install the programs where do you

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
recommend to go buy a new

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
hard drive for a ps3 and what's the larger size

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
you can get uh

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
ps3 can fit any hard drive that you can

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
fit in the bay that's in there it's two and a half

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
um inch

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
sata drives laptop sata

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
drive so you can put

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
whatever I think I put a 500

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
gigabyte one in mine and

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
it was a

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
scorpio

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
blue I think

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
or something like that I don't remember what it's called

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
western digital or something like that

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
um just look online for

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
uh hard drives that'll fit

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
I think you have to watch out when you get

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
really big hard drive sizes

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
the actual hard drive itself gets

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
thicker and it might not fit in the actual

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
um bay that they have

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
so you have to kind of watch what you can fit in there

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
uh at least I know that's the case with

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
um with the xbox

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
when you're modding that

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
as far as modding like I'm assuming they're asking

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
about modding the ps3 stuff

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
um just download the apps

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
you may have to check out some of the websites

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
like there's uh

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
dashhax.com

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
or dot net or something

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
dashhax is the website they have

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
information about doing hacks

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
on playstation 3

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
psp vita when there's

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
that stuff available you know pretty much

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
any consoles and ios

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
and phones and that kind of stuff so

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
that'd be kind of a good source for finding some of

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
the tools to flash a custom

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
uh

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
firmware or what not

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
to your playstation 3

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
at least that's how I did it when I did mine

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
then I flashed it back to stock because I just wasn't

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
using

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
you know I wasn't pirating games or anything on that

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
cause you know games are fucking

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
huge cause they're blu ray games so it's

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
just I had nothing I really wanted

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
to even I would want to even

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
pirate so um I just buy games

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000

and girl and darksacro okay

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
I just wanted to talk a little bit about

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
my favorite portable game of the past generation which you

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
briefly mentioned in the past

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
two weeks releases I am of course

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
talking about bokuakoku

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
kansai kansai kan

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
um I am an air traffic

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
controller airport hero um

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
unlike games with similar names on

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
aya such as flight controller pocket planes

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
this is a real puzzle game based on the very

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
real intricacies of air traffic control

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
basically you play the role

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
of the five people in the atc tower

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
at the same time telling pilots what

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
routes to take um

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
coming into and out of the airport giving

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
permission to land and take off giving

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
taxing instructions and confirming flight plans

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
as the stages get harder more

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
and more plans arrive in your airspace more plans

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
prepare to take off you have to juggle up to

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
ten different pilots vying for your attention

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
with only five radio channels

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
take too long and the pilots get stressed push buttons

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
without thinking and you'll cause a crash

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
it's hectic, frantic, and utterly gripping

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
um he's got a video up

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
um of what it's like so

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
uh I'm not gonna go too far into that

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
it says the 3ds version um came out

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
last week is pretty similar but with cuter graphics

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
and I would urge anyone who enjoys

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
time management puzzle games to look into this

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
as you read this I

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
will likely be in Disneyland Paris

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
watching new Disney dreams nighttime spectacular

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
wish you were here

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
and that's uh from pikaruno

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
oh well you did say wish you were here at the end

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
so I can't be too mean bring me back something duffy

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
and last email

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
uh

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
this uh

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
this is hello olr after a long time

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
I finally got to play binary domain

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
I wish some interest

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
I had some interest in it but I somehow never

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
compelled to buy it thinking it would just

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
be another shooter my girlfriend got it for me

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
a couple days ago and I started playing

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
and just could not stop this game

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
is awesome I was told

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
to sing it by the way

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
and you did and I did

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
sure it's not perfect

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
controls aren't always spot on and the voice recognition

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
isn't very good but the deep story

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
future Tokyo environment graphics

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
voice acting and sound make it

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
a very good game you can literally

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
shoot robots to pieces and it isn't that

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
same gritty and brown

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
world you see in countless other games

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
this is the very first game that gave

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
me goosebumps while playing the end sequence

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
that's saying a lot when I get emotional

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
about a game Sega should be deeply

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
ashamed for not promoting this game more

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
binary domain vanquished bayonetta are all

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
games that deserve better when you

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
get the chance buy this as it is very

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
cheap that's all I have to say at this time

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
as always thanks a lot for

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
making an episode of OLR every week

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000

out 30 minutes of sleep and

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
I don't have to deal with

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
crap traffic in the morning also

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000

decided to park in front of the gate like they

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
he looks at his mirror

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
what oh

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000

a little bit it's like dude you're in the fucking

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
middle of the god damn entrance it's

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
just like selfishly inconsiderate what in the

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
hell find a parking space

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
entitlement and don't think there's anybody else in the world

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
it's like I don't know what's wrong with these people

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
that's it

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
my view of the week goes to the web and on this

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
computer right now I don't get what the hell's going on but like

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
everything is like timing out I'm

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
the same to me yeah I'm having to like run shit off

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
my iPad right now I don't know it's

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
weird I don't know luckily the stream

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
is staying up and that's the most important thing I just hope

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
Skype will stay up as well it's doing

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
the same thing at my house but like

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
I can't do I'm

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
really upset because somebody had a funny joke

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
earlier when Jim Sally sent the email about

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
what sexy games do you want to see on the

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
sexy island dark Tetsuya

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
in chat said miss nude world 96

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
which was a perfect excuse for me

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
to play that everybody move your body

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
clip but thanks to the web errors I can't

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
get the clip up

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
F you to the web

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
for making me lose out on the funny

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
hate

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
two more

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
news stories then phone calls

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
first Loki I'm even turning off everything on my

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
iPhone just to see if it helps

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
so there's a few demakes

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
we should talk about the first being

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
Borderlands Borderlands actually

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
was demade into a 16

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
bit top down shooter game

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
for your browser

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
so you can check it out it's

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
they call it the border lands

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
and you

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
can check it I love this website

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
you can check it at

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
www.wubwub.eu

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
slash demake.php

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
wub wub wub wub wub

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
amazing

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
so that's pretty cool and then

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
since we were talking about Atari 2600

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
earlier somebody has decided

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
to demake the Super Mario Brothers

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
for the Atari 2600

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
now or at least

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
it's done in the Atari 2600

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
style and he's got

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
I guess a demo with

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
level warp pipes

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
yellow blocks and flag poles

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
and I guess 15 levels

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
up to 4-4 is what he's

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
hoping to do and have a Koopa Kid

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
at the end of each world as a boss

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
pretty cool

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
and if you want to check that out

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
indiegames.com has got

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
the link for that

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
I'm surprised it took that long

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
for a Super Mario demake surely this isn't

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
the first it's just the most recent one

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
yeah we go to the Atari age forums

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
there's a

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
bin file for

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
your

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
emulators

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
alright well if you ever saw the movie The King of

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
Kong you did not

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
see Hank Chien in that movie

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
even though he is now the official

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
world record holder of Donkey Kong

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
he came after the movie

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
thank god that wasn't one of the titles for the contest man

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
the whole back and forth what?

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
the Ready Player One contest

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
oh yeah right

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
thank god it wasn't because

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
Hank Chien would have won it again because guess what

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
he broke his own record

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
so you got to appreciate a guy who will keep

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
challenging himself

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
like there's none of this you know

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
Steve Weeby and all this stuff going on here

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
he's challenging himself

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
so he beat his previous record

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
1,110,100 points

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
the new record

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
1,127,700 points

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
that's the new

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
score from Hank Chien

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
if you haven't heard that name of course

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
he was the Donkey Kong world record holder before

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
after that whole movie mess and all that stuff

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
I believe

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
what is it by day he's a plastic surgeon isn't he?

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
and that's how he can afford

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
all these machines

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
you pay him for a new

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
well I noticed in this picture he's posing next

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
to a Donkey Kong machine and there's a moon patrol

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
machine in the background too

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
now I don't know if that's because he's at an arcade

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
like maybe some type of publicity event

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
cause I know Fun Spot

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
he's got way too much smug on his face

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
eh I don't necessarily think it's smug

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
some people just take interesting pictures

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
those machines aren't that terribly expensive

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
he could be a nice guy

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
for an arcade game that's not bad

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
yeah the Kong Off 2

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
that's what they call a Kong Off

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
sounds like something dirty

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
but anyway the Kong Off 2

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
is where they gather the best Donkey Kong players

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
at one location for glorious live

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
competition

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
not that they're saying he's gonna be in it

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
but there's obviously a lot of pressure

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
for him to show up which would be pretty cool

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
so

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
SSJ100Matt in our chat room

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
at chat.orangelandrater

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
not that one

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
live.vognetwork.com says

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
look guys it was 9 years of one particular website

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
SSJ100Matt says and Billy Mitchell

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
zero fucks given about him

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
or his damn hot sauce

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
I hear the hot sauce isn't bad

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
just saying

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
alright that takes us to

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
the skype part of the show

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
that's the part of the show

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
where we're gonna open up the skype lines

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
at 1-877-GAME-OLR

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
and take your phone calls

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
live on the program

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
we will get to the twitter as well

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
twitter.com slash olr in just a moment

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
but first we're gonna go to the phones and

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
oh we already have a call on the line let's go to it

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
hi you're on Orange Lodge Radio who's this

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
hey guys it's Jason

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
hey Jason what's up

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
so as you so wonderfully

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
alluded to earlier in the show

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
I was at

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
the Wii U consumer experience

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
here in Denver just yesterday

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
apparently I think my friend

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
told me they've been in since Thursday

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
and since he went to E3 he had codes

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
assigned me and a friend up and we all

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
got to go out there and see the

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
I'm assuming they're all gonna be

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
launch titles or something that's gonna happen

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
within the first couple of months

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
and it's just really interesting

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
cause I was hearing obviously you're cross with Bobby

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
and you guys were really

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
putting the Wii U down

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
it's kind of astounding

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
to me

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
I understand in the fact that it's

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
gonna be a lot of the same thing

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
and you have to get a whole new console

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
just to be able to use the tablet even

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
though everything else is gonna be the same

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
controllers, the Wii Fit balance

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
board and all that kind of stuff

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
but I don't know

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
that speaking as a gamer myself

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
somebody who will pay the money to get something

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
like this and not the common

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
people that paid 200 bucks to play

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
Wii Sports forever

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
Jason I'm more worried about the games

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
it's not the console myself

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
or the console itself

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
but I see a lot of what was happening with the 3DS

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
happening here, you have a lot of mediocre

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
launch titles and I

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
don't think any really big standouts

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
here's your chance to change

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
my mind, what did you get your hands on

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
that you are excited to drop money

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
for a new console for?

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
They didn't really speak release dates

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
and actually as a matter of fact when the event was wrapping up

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
they had this little quick little

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
trivia session, they were giving out a bunch of

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
silly little prizes and one of them

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
was a trick question, when is the Wii U

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
coming out, the answer was holidays

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
but there's otherwise no specific

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
date barring what Loki

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
said earlier about the 13th

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
you know that the correct answer is November 18th, I would have got him

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
even the people putting on this event

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
wouldn't know that though

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
yeah it wasn't NDA'd

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
it wasn't sales, it wasn't media

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
this is just bring your friends

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
and let's play some really cool games

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
we'll show you some stuff, and it was really fun

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
the boost that they set up, the things that I actually

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
had, I didn't get my hands on everything

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
but they had setups

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
for Nintendo Land cycling

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
through some of the mini arcade games

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
Game and Wario

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
Super Mario Brothers Wii U, Zombie U

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
Batman Arkham City, Pikmin 3

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
Just Dance 4, Wii Fit

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
U, Rayman Legends

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
and then two non-finally

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
named Project P100

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
and Sing

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
and they

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
looked good, that's all I really

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
have to say about it

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
on the surface is that these games

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
looked spectacular

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
Super Mario Brothers, exactly

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
as it was on the Wii, I love

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
that art style, I love the way it played

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
the tablet integration looks fun if you happen

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
to have a second person to play

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
with, but then Pikmin

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
looked gorgeous and the new effects

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
that they're

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
they're not, if they support 3D

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
TV that's news to me, but the fact that they

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
were actually throwing things

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
at the camera and whatnot and actually

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
given this serious

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
spatial angle to it and not just

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
you know, a bird's eye corner

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
view of it, it just

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
looks like it played marvelously well

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
Alright, so it's the Nintendo

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
stuff you love in HD

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
but again, did you

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
get your hands on the games? Did you play any games?

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
Which ones stood out for you?

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
I played Super Mario Brothers

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
Wii U

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
Super Mario Brothers Wii U

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
I played a couple of the games from Nintendo Land

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
and then I played

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
as far as I understand, pretty much a whole level of

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
Game and Legends

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
As I'm sure a lot of people know, Nintendo Land

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
is mostly a series of

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
mini-games that are developed to really take

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
advantage notably of the tablet

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
but also give you a really good multiplayer experience

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
The very first

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
thing I did was play Luigi's Ghost

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
Mansion playing the flashlight tag

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
where the ghost is playing on the

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
tablet and is invisible for the large

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
part and then the four players

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
with Wiimotes have to move

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
around, have to move around the

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
mansion, the maze trying to find the ghost

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
and reviving players that go down

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
anything else like that

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
These games

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
I could not say that these games

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
were not complete and ready for retail

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
release

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
It was a two hour

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
event, tops, and we

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
were playing in increments

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
of like ten minutes at best

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
usually much shorter than that

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
I can't

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
really find the words for it other than the fact that

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
it feels like it will be a more complete

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
library than any other

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
system launch that I've actually

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
jumped into at the very start of it

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
and then especially things like

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
Zombiou and Batman Arkham City look

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
absolutely stunning

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
I've played Mad World

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
and yeah, that's not supposed to be the

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
realistic graphics or anything

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
but Arkham City and Zombiou looked

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
absolutely fantastic, this wasn't

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
the thin arm red

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
steel or any other nonsense like that

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
Out of curiosity, have you played

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
Arkham City on 360 or

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
PlayStation 3? Unfortunately,

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
no. See, that's

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
where I have to admit, not that

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
I question your opinion, but I go, well

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
it looks beautiful on the other systems too, and it's

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
been out for a year

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
And it's not just about the graphics, but the fact that this is something

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
that's going to be available at some

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
point within the launch

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
within the general launch window

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
means that this is a

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
big tier title

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
that's going to be on Nintendo's system

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
that a lot of people already own

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
because it came out last year

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
also true

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
I absolutely will not deny that, and like I was saying

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
at the start of the call, I think

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
that a lot of people

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
are going to paint a very negative

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
picture of the Wii U after it comes

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
out because it's not going to have

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
the runaway success that the first Wii did

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
because all of the

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
casuals, all of the people that

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
otherwise have never owned a gaming system

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
won't see the reason to

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
buy this, maybe

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
and so it'll, it

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
won't sell, it won't take

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
off so ridiculously like the original Wii

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
did, but that's not a bad

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
thing because this is, this

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
is Nintendo, in my

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
absolute opinion, this is Nintendo making things

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
better for gamers at large

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
Project P100 is

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
a very Pikmin-esque

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
action game, which

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
is great because there's finally a

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
second game with that low army

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
control mechanism

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
and it's set in a very, in a much

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
more technological, like in a

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
scene that a lot of people would prefer, I'm sure

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
I just, I have to

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
admit, Jason, despite your enthusiasm

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
I'm not sure I'm completely sold, and it

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
comes down to the games issue, and it's

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
really about what

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
I just, it's not,

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
and to be fair, to Nintendo's credit

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
it's kind of the same mistake as the Vita

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
too, is that the Vita

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
did come with a few kick-ass launch

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
games, and there was certainly a lot to look forward

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
to, but I don't know

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
what's been delivered on hasn't

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
exactly matched the hype, and

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
this is all about the games department

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
and it's kind of what I worry about with the

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
Wii U as well, because we haven't seen a lot

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
past the launch window, and you know

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
there's not a lot to just

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
really, really get excited about

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
because I played a lot of these

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
Mass Effect 3, Arkham City on

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
360, and I'm not really

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
interested in playing them again with tablet controls

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000
because it doesn't sound like it's going to change that much

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
so I have to look to things like

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
Nintendo Land, and Pikmin 3

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
and New Super Mario Brothers Wii U

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
and all this to pique my

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
interest, and it's just, I'm not

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
I'm not as excited as

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
say, the hype behind the

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
original Wii, and how we felt

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
about that Zelda game, was a

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
phenomenal launch, I mean

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
has there ever been a better

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
launch game for a console since the original

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
Super Mario Brothers?

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
Certainly not one I've actually been there for

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
Than Zelda for the Wii?

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
I mean I guess I was just hoping for something of that

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
magnitude, and Nintendo Land

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
ain't it!

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000
The thing that really sets this apart

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
one of the feelings that I did come away with

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
is that, you know

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000
true to Nintendo's spirit, this stuff

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
works, a lot of the things that they were showcasing

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000
make it really compelling

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
for local multiplayer, you know

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
knock Nintendo's online services

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
all you want, I completely agree with it

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
but having that

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
second player, or in some cases

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
that fifth player, to be able to take over

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
controls with the tablet

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
is actually immensely fun, the fact that

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
me and

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
one of my two friends that were there with me

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
were planning on who wants to do

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
which function of the game, just

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
added a really different element

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
for example, Rayman Legends

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
the Wiimote

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
or actually in this case it was the

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
pro controller, whatever they're

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
going to call it for the Wii U

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
the standard controller user is controlling

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
Rayman, throwing shots

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
jumping, all that kind of thing, jumping on

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
obstacles, attacking, where the tablet

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
is manipulating the

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
environment, it's moving platforms

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
around, they had the whole rotation

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
demonstration where you're walking

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
Rayman's running through a maze, and the

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
person holding the tablet has to orient

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
the level by turning the

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
entire device in order to

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
allow them to jump to the next

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
ring, land on solid grounds

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
lands not on spikes

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
and the biggest thing that

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
they showed off, as I said

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
was that with a second person

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
these games just got

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
ridiculously more interesting

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
Zombie, you had this

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
capture the flag

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
not capture the flag

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
the game mode where you have like three

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
or five waypoints that you have to

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
capture and defend and that kind of stuff

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
and the player

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
with the standard controller

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
owned the TV

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
and would attack

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
Zombies and was pretty much the one man army

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
and then the person holding the tablet

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
had like a real time strategy

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
kind of interface where he could take

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000
hordes of Zombies and send them to the

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000
particular waypoints and actually drill

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
into this real time strategy that's

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
not really been seen at the

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
same time like that

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
with a lot of the stuff though

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
all these games are reliant on

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
you having about four or five

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
people in your living room

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
it's all local multiplayer

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
where's my online multiplayer for

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
to Nintendo's credit

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
that could be an ace in the hole on September

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
13th, we still don't know what

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
Nintendo Network really is

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
despite the fact it's being branded on Nintendo

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
cartridges, that could be

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
coming and I'd be okay with that if there's

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
a huge unveil on September 13th

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
so I would wait on the online

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
piece to be too critical about that until

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000
we have that event, but if we still don't

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
hear about it at that event, that it ain't coming

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
with the release of the Wii U and now we should be concerned

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
but let me ask this

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
this call's going a little long and that's okay Jason

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
because we love you, but I want to ask

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
I want to ask you one more question shaped off

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
a chat comment we got here at live.vognetwork.com

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
and ShadowNextGen

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
in chat who's agreed with you

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
in many ways and I saw it throughout Bobby's show

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
tonight, he kind of didn't

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
he thought

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
what I was saying was kind of wrong and he's

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
more supportive of the Wii U, he sounds a lot like

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
you and what you're saying and

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000
he says, what this says to

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
me is more people need to get

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
actual hands on time with

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000
the Wii U, so let me

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000
ask you this Jason, you've had hands

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000
on time with the Wii U, I haven't

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000
Loki hasn't, Dark Sakura hasn't

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000
what do you think, and you

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000
you are clearly in love with this

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
thing more so than us skeptics here

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000
what do you

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000
think you gain that we're missing

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000
having had hands on time with the system

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
see and that's

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
that's a really funny question I'll try to

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
summarize in the fact that I

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
me and Ryan don't play a lot of the same

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
games and I'm hoping she's going to be

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
interested in the aspects that are opened up

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
with this simultaneous multiplayer of standard

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
controllers and the tablets, but that

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
that is absolutely like Nintendo's

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
biggest deal that they're trying to

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
push here is that this is going to be great

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
for families of at least

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
two gamers because

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
in their whole demos you know they

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
can play a standard game reserved

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
solely to the tablet and give the TV

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
back to someone else, that is

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
killer, and this is a fully fledged

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
game that's not confined to

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
a phone that has a limited amount of

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
controls and you can do

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
all sorts of media while giving the TV

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
back to somebody else, but for

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
these Wii U optimized games where you

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
have your hands on the tablet, this is

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000
engaging somebody else at

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
the same time, usually in a completely

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000
distinct way, you know what that also means?

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
That means both people

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000
get to play the game in two in times

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000
completely different methods.

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
I mean for all the replayability

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000
complaints and what

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
we complain about in modern gaming, this

02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000
is two different ways to play the same

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000
game. That's

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000
ridiculously cool

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000
to me. I was sold on the system before

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
I went to this event, I touched, I

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
had my hands on it,

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
I am 100% sold on the system

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
now. I will absolutely say

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
that. I am like so with you up to a point

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
Jason because I do really want, no I really

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
do want to love this system and I want to,

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
I'll probably get one anyway, who are we kidding?

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
I mean I've said that since day one.

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
I'm skeptical as all hell

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
but I'll still fucking buy one because I'm a

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
consumer of horror.

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
God damn it, I lost

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
my train of thought.

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
Where you don't, this is where you don't agree.

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
No here it is, here it is.

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
Where are the games

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000
that substantiate what you're saying?

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
I know you

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
brought this up before, which of these, do you

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
remember my list of games at the very start of the call?

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
Yes. Do you

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
know what the launch dates,

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
what the launch, oh Jesus.

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000
What games will be launched

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
in the holiday window?

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
Pretty much everything that you named is in the

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000
holiday window. And that's not enough to

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
start a system?

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
Yes.

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
When half

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
your list is stuff that's already

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
been out with a new method that

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
again, now we go back to the phone

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
conversation about

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000
games that weren't developed for that system.

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
Don't know, I mean, yeah, okay

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
so we'll have this tablet interaction, but these games

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
weren't designed with the tablet thing in mind.

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
They're kind of trying to shoehorn that

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000
stuff in there, which is fine, whatever, show off

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
the system, but I'm not that, I am not

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
excited about Arkham City with the pad.

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
I'm not, I am not excited

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
about Mass Effect 3 with the touchpad.

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
Sorry, I'm not.

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000
So, you know, that's half the games right

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
off the table. Now my interest is

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000
peaked, my eyebrow is raised a little bit at things

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
like Zombie U, Peekman

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000
3, I kind of consider

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000
New Star Mario Brothers Wii at this point.

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
It's half rehash, half

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
a successful formula just being

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
done again. But

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000
a couple games, no, it's really not

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
enough. Look at the 3DS.

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
Look at the 3DS, I think

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:03.000
they're making the exact same mistake, I really do.

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000
Look at the Vita launch, I mean, they had a ton of games

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000
that a lot of them were original

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
and that still didn't help the system.

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000
Yeah, and SSJ100, Matt, thank you, you fill in the

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
gap here really well. I want to know what's coming

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000
out after these launch window games.

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000
What is Nintendo going to do to warrant this investment

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
because that's what console games are, investments.

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
I think that is what Nintendo

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
really has to show us September 13th

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
if they want to woo some of the skeptics over

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000
because I'll tell you, they come out and they show

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000
off that 3D Zelda game or they

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
whip out F-Zero or

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000
a Metroid Prime type of thing that's in that

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
HD experience, I'm totally

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
on board.

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000
Final thought? Yes. You are going

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:41.000
to love Sing.

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
Provided the song list pans

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
out and it's not more

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
freaking LMFAO

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
We'll see.

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
Provided the song list comes up with some really good gems

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
you are going to adore

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.000
Sing. I can pretty much promise you that.

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
Will it be all ABBA

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
songs? Because otherwise Sing Star ABBA

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
still has my heart.

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
The only songs they had

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
were Shoop Shoop

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000
Party Rock Anthem and Call

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000
Me Maybe and they haven't really let on

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000
what else is going to be there. Oh god, that's like

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000
my personal hell.

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000
Those sure, like I said, provided

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000
the song list is actually worth it and I

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000
have to hope that we'll sing is going to be

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000
spectacular for parties. Jason,

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000
I got to let you go. Some of the chatters think you're a

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
Nintendo sales person in disguise.

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000
I got to let you go. Alright. Thanks guys.

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000
Have a good week. You too, buddy. Take care.

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.000
Alright. VX Jason

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
XV. We let his call go on a little long, but that's

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000
alright. I mean, he was there. He got

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000
hands on. We're skeptics. Whatevs.

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000
Let's do like one more

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000
call. 1877 Game OLR or

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000
username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:45.000
While we wait for those calls to come in, let me

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000
quickly see if I can do a Twitter topic here.

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.000
Tiger Claw

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000
links us on Twitter.

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000
This is one

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
that I read in the news that

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000
forgot to mention on the show tonight,

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000
but it's important. Uncharted

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:01.000
film has burned through yet another

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000
director.

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
I'll have to read more on this after another

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
call because the phone's lighting up. Hi, you're on

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000
OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? Holy crap

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:11.000
it's Ranma and I get the ass into the Skype

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000
chats. That's sweet. What's up,

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.000
Ranma? Not too much.

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000
You guys are talking about

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000
Kickstarter and stuff like that, so I've come

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000
across something that's quite interesting.

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000
Well, when I was at

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
Otacon last month, I was in the game room

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
and they had this game called

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
Epic Beatdown

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000
Otaku Style.

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000
What? Yes.

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.000
Okay,

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:37.000
is it something you actually brave to try

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.000
or... Yes, it's

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:41.000
an anime equivalent of

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:43.000
Double Dragon meets Scott Pilgrim vs.

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:45.000
the World, the game.

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:47.000
Wow. And you can

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:49.000
check out their plans on

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:51.000
StudioNasu.com, which I am posting

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000
in the chat room right now.

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000
It pretty much,

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:57.000
from what I understand,

02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:59.000
you're at Otacon and you're just

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:01.000
pretty much beating up on the fanboys,

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:03.000
more or less.

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000
And as

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
somebody who goes to anime conventions

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000
quite frequently and all this stuff, how do you

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000
feel? Hey,

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:13.000
I'm all for it. You talk to somebody

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:15.000
at any given time who has a weapon on and

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.000
you're trying to help somebody. You gotta be able to laugh

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000
at yourself first. I'll put a weapon

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000
as a can of deodorant.

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000
Well, one con

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
actually put

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000
soap in their bags

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:29.000
and people got pissed at that so they decided

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000
not to do it again, but that's besides the point.

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:33.000
Alright.

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000
Did you just call to whore this con

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.000
going game or what else is going on in your life,

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000
Rama? Yeah, that's more or less

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000
it. Well, you know, that and we've already discussed

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000
New Super Mario Brothers 2, so my two

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
cents on that doesn't really count. Well, what

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000
is your, no, of course, every

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000
gamer has a voice. Every gamer

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.000
has a voice. Use that voice. You are

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000
Black Luigi after all. I want to know what

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000
Black Luigi thinks

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000
about Mario 2. It's important, dammit.

02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000
I'm a Luigi, number

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:01.000
one gaming star.

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000
So what do you think about Mario

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.000
2 on, excuse

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000
me, New Super Mario Brothers 2

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000
on the 3DS? It

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000
lacks. Ooh,

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000
sick burn. Why is that?

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.000
I don't know. It's, you know how you play

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000
a game and you just look at it like it's just

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000
lacking and you can't put your

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000
finger on what it is, but it's just lacking

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000
something. I mean, I like

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000
the fact they brought back the raccoon tail,

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000
so I'm thinking, oh yeah, Super Mario

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000
Brothers 3. Rama, is it

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000
originality?

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000
Mmm.

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000
You say it lacks? Yeah, I don't know.

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000
I mean. It only has 85%

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000
of the feels. Yes.

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000
I don't know

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000
if you listened to last week's show, Rama, early on

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000
or whatever when I was talking about the game. Well, yeah, I caught the podcast

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000
because I was out last week. But I'm just

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000
okay, here was my whole thoughts on the game is that

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000
like, it's pretty much a formulaic

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000
Mario game, but is that

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000
really such a bad thing? No,

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000
not at all, but this

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000
is what I think would have made the game better.

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.000
Now, you remember in Super Mario

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000
3, you could travel all

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000
over the map area

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000
to go to different levels. I understand you could

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000
do that in the new SMB2,

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000
but it's only like part of the

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.000
screen that it takes up. It would be nicer if

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.000
it was the full screen that allows you to travel

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000
from the different levels.

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000
I understand that they brought back some of the

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.000
music from SMB3. They

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:23.000
could have brought back some of the classic matching

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000
card games or matching

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000
up the mushroom, the fire flower for 1-Ups

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000
and stuff like that. I like the little

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.000
giant glove that punched the 1-Ups.

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.000
That was kind of cute, actually.

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:35.000
Yeah, bring back Kribo

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000
2. Maybe

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000
I was thinking it would be more

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000
like Super Mario Bros 3, but better.

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000
Well, I don't know.

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000
I didn't dislike it by any means,

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000
and when I write my VOG review, it'll

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:51.000
probably be on the positive end of things, but

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000
it's just, you know, I don't know. There's just something

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000
I'm not as like, oh my god!

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000
Ermahgerd about it as

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000
previous Mario games. Hey, Ranma.

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000
Do you have a

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000
R4 or anything

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000
like that for your DS?

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000
Yes, and when you first mentioned a long

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000
time ago the new Super Mario Bros 3

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000
ROM hack, I went and downloaded it

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.000
like 10 minutes after the

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000
podcast. That game is hard as fuck.

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000
That's what I'm saying, though, but I mean,

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000
it's pretty awesome. They did all

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000
these original levels plus the levels from

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000
Super Mario Bros 3, and

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000
that took some effort versus

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000
rehashing the same old

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000
shit again. Yeah.

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:31.000
I mean, as

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000
I'm controlling the game, I'm not too fond of how they

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000
changed how you control Mario, but

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000
eh.

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000
Alright. Ranma, I gotta wrap up, let you go.

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000
Any final thoughts?

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000
Erm...

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:45.000
Actually, no. Alright, take

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000
care, buddy. Alright, later. Bye.

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000
I guess we can do one more call. I've seen

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.000
this one calling in. We'll do one

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000
more call. Here we go. Hi, you're on

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000
Orange is Orange Radio. Who's this? This is

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.000
Cody. Cody!

02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:59.000
What's up, Cody? What's up?

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000
I'm actually a first time

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000
caller. Long time listener.

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000
Long time listener, first time.

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000
I was gonna say, I don't recognize this Skype

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.000
picture. I'm a very visual person. But I like bow ties.

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:11.000
Bow ties are cool. It's a very, very nice

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000
bow tie. That looks like, did you tie that bow tie

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000
yourself on your picture? That is actually,

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000
that is a Doctor Who brand

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000
bow tie. Oh ho ho. See?

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000
Very nice. Do you also wear a fez?

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000
You will fit in well here at the Voice of Geeks

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.000
Network. I do own one.

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:27.000
Alright. What's up, Cody?

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:29.000
I wanted to call, actually,

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:31.000
first off, the whole Wii U thing.

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.000
I'm kind of the same. I'm

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:35.000
on the fence about it as well.

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.000
About the only thing I use

02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:39.000
my Wii for right now

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.000
is Netflix and Skyward Sword.

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:43.000
So, I mean,

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:45.000
and I really, I've

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:47.000
seen a lot of stuff going on

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:49.000
with it. Different networks talking

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:51.000
about it and, you know, everybody's just, has

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:53.000
kind of the same, same

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:55.000
take on it, you know? They just,

02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:57.000
they need to play it. They need

02:58:57.000 --> 02:58:59.000
to play it and not a lot of people get to play

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:01.000
it and I think that's what somebody said in the chat

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:03.000
is that not a lot of people get

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:05.000
to play it and they haven't had hands on so

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:07.000
they don't know how it's going to work. Well, it's, yeah,

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:09.000
it's Shadow Next Gen and VXJ

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:11.000
both are in chat now kind of talking it up

02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:13.000
because they both are like, you guys need to play it,

02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:15.000
you guys need to do the hands on experience, but

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:17.000
and I'm sure as

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:19.000
the, you know, announcements are made

02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:21.000
as we get closer to launch day, we're going to start

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:23.000
seeing those displays at Best Buys,

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:25.000
Game Stops, yada yada, so everybody can

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:27.000
get their hands on time, but

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:29.000
I don't know, I still

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:31.000
am highly skeptical.

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:33.000
But that's not a bad thing.

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:35.000
It's not a bad thing. I don't

02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:37.000
hate the Wii U. It's not a bad thing to

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:39.000
question, especially after the

02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:41.000
3DS launch. I don't think it's a bad thing to

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:43.000
be concerned. I don't want the Wii U to be.

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:45.000
Not at all. Not at all. And I,

02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:47.000
you know, and I'm so, I

02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:49.000
was excited about it, you know, especially like you said,

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:51.000
Zombie U, when I saw that I was like, whoa, man

02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:53.000
that looks like an amazing game. And you know,

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:55.000
I just, I'm scared that it's

02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:57.000
going to be kind of like the Vita, and I believe

02:59:57.000 --> 02:59:59.000
Loki said something about, you know,

02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:01.000
it's

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:03.000
the Vita, you know, had this huge

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:05.000
launch of original games and

03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:07.000
everything, and it still didn't help it.

03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:09.000
And I think, I

03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:11.000
kind of think that that's the way that the Wii U is going to

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:13.000
turn out, but you know what, we haven't seen it yet,

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:15.000
and that's the thing, is you know, we just have to wait.

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:17.000
And once we

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:19.000
see it, then we'll know.

03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:21.000
So I, you know, I'm just

03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:23.000
waiting.

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:25.000
Alright, did you say you have something else you want to talk about tonight?

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000
Because you said that you got derailed by the Wii U talk,

03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:29.000
but was there something else on your mind?

03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:31.000
I just wanted to throw that in there. Also, no, I wanted to

03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:33.000
say, I actually, I'm an

03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:35.000
Oklahoman, I think you have a couple Oklahoman

03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:37.000
callers, or listeners

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:39.000
actually, and

03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:41.000
I was going to say that, I don't know if you guys

03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:43.000
heard about the Gearbox Community

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:45.000
Day?

03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:47.000
Yeah, I have heard about that. I did hear about that, yeah.

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:49.000
I'm actually, I'm trying to

03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:51.000
go, I want to go, and I

03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:53.000
want to bring, I actually want to

03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.000
videotape as much as I can, if they'll

03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.000
allow it. But,

03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:59.000
I'm a big Borderlands

03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:01.000
whore, I mean, like, I play that game

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:03.000
like, constantly, and I think it's

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:05.000
because I love RPGs, and I love

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:07.000
FPSs, but I suck at FPSs

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:09.000
and I'm good at RPGs, so it kind of

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:11.000
mixes the two together, and so I think

03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:13.000
that's why I like it so much. But, I didn't

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:15.000
know if you guys heard about that, and

03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:17.000
I mean, it just looks like a really fun

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:19.000
thing to go to. I've never been to any

03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:21.000
kind of conventions or anything like that, so

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:23.000
I'm pretty excited about that.

03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:25.000
Where are they having this? In

03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:27.000
Texas.

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:29.000
Dallas, yeah.

03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:31.000
So, they're doing,

03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:33.000
it's not just Borderlands 2, it's

03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:35.000
also Aliens vs.

03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:37.000
Predator, was it Aliens vs. Predator?

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:39.000
I'm sorry, Aliens colonial

03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:41.000
marines. Yeah, colonial marines.

03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:43.000
And then one more

03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:45.000
thing, I do know that Allen

03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:47.000
plays a lot, he's a big

03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:49.000
fan of Half-Life,

03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:51.000
and

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:53.000
I don't know if he's played this

03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:55.000
mod before, and I really don't know how long this

03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:57.000
mod's been out, but it's a Garry's mod,

03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:59.000
and it's called, oh,

03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:01.000
Trouble in Terrorist Town?

03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:03.000
That doesn't

03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:05.000
sound familiar to me, but he's listening,

03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:07.000
he's unfortunately not here in the house, he's

03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:09.000
at work tonight, so I can't ask him in

03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:11.000
person, but he's listening, so he might

03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:13.000
pop up in chat or whatever, but it

03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:15.000
doesn't sound familiar to me. If he

03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:17.000
hasn't played it, he needs to, because it is

03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:19.000
the, oh my gosh,

03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:21.000
it's so fun. It's the

03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:23.000
most fun of Garry's mod

03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:25.000
that I've ever had, just with

03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:27.000
the funny things that happen in the mod, with all

03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:29.000
the randoms that get thrown in, you know,

03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:31.000
if you don't have a group of people

03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:33.000
that go on.

03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:35.000
It's just so fun. I'm gonna grill you like

03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:37.000
I did the Wii U lovers. Why?

03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:39.000
Why is it so damn amazing?

03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:41.000
I, you know, I don't,

03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:43.000
I'm not really into a whole lot of multiplayer,

03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:45.000
and I think it, when it

03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:47.000
happens, when it comes to like FPS's

03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:49.000
and stuff like that, I don't really like that a lot.

03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:51.000
I don't know, it might be because I

03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:53.000
just am really bad at them, but this game

03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:55.000
kind of, I don't know, it's just, it's really

03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:57.000
fun, and it has a lot to do with, you have

03:02:57.000 --> 03:02:59.000
to figure out who's the traitor

03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:01.000
in your group, and you have to, like, there's

03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:03.000
a detective, a traitor, and then I think

03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:05.000
there's, there's one more, I

03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:07.000
can't even think of. Is that like

03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:09.000
the wolf game, or the mafia game,

03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:11.000
you know, those games that are popular on

03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:13.000
web forums and conventions and all that?

03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:15.000
That's kind of what it sounds like to me.

03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:17.000
Yeah, I mean, it's sort of like

03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:19.000
that. Sort of. Yeah,

03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:21.000
but, I mean, it's really fun. See if he wants

03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:23.000
to check it out. I mean, it's, I think it's a, I'm

03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:25.000
pretty sure it's a free mod, obviously, but

03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:27.000
but, yeah, check it out.

03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:29.000
I mean, I've, go on YouTube,

03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:31.000
look up all these different, you

03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:33.000
know, gameplays of it, and it's just so, so

03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:35.000
hilarious, so. Alright, I'll make

03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:37.000
him check it out. Sounds great.

03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:39.000
Alright, well, Codeman, thanks, or excuse me, Cody,

03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:41.000
thanks so much for calling into

03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:43.000
the show tonight. I appreciate it, and

03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:45.000
yeah, you call in any time.

03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:47.000
No problem, and, you know, I was

03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:49.000
actually, I had a tweet last week

03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:51.000
telling

03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:53.000
you guys about a Borderlands 2

03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:55.000
giveaway, and I don't know if I remember. Oh, that was you!

03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:57.000
It is me! Yeah, it was you!

03:03:57.000 --> 03:03:59.000
Okay. I was an

03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:01.000
idiot and didn't link the freaking

03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:03.000
YouTube video. Alright, plug

03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:05.000
away. Oh, um,

03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:07.000
I actually, I have a small gaming

03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:09.000
channel on YouTube. It's not huge.

03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:11.000
I don't get paid for it or anything like that. I just enjoy

03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:13.000
gaming and showing people my games.

03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:15.000
Hey, it's what we're doing here. It's the exact same thing

03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:17.000
we do here, except we're audio.

03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:19.000
Oh, yes.

03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:21.000
And my channel is just funny commentary,

03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:23.000
but, yeah, I'm giving away

03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:25.000
a copy of Borderlands 2.

03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:27.000
I mean, it's any platform

03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:29.000
out there that's,

03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:31.000
you know, gonna be out PC, PS3,

03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:33.000
360, Steam, any

03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:35.000
of that, so, um,

03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:37.000
but, yeah, it's, um,

03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:39.000
actually, my YouTube channel is

03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:41.000
linked in my Skype, if you wanna,

03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:43.000
but I can say it on here, if you want.

03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:45.000
Yeah, you better say it, because it'll take me too long

03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:47.000
to bring it up, so go ahead. Spell it or whatever.

03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:49.000
Um, it's, it's, uh,

03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:51.000
www.youtube.com

03:04:51.000 --> 03:04:55.000
backslash ctaylor1785

03:04:55.000 --> 03:04:57.000
ctaylor1785.

03:04:57.000 --> 03:04:59.000
You know, I gotta be honest,

03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:01.000
buddy, you wanna get some more hits on your YouTube channel,

03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:03.000
you're gonna have to come up with something really catchy.

03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:05.000
1785 is hard to remember,

03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:07.000
so, we'll see.

03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:09.000
Well, it was kind of funny, because I

03:05:09.000 --> 03:05:11.000
came up with the YouTube channel a long time ago,

03:05:11.000 --> 03:05:13.000
but never did anything, and so now I can't

03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:15.000
change it, and now my channel's

03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:17.000
called Codeman Games.

03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:19.000
Okay, that's good. That's good.

03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:21.000
Or I was gonna say, like, how about, like,

03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:23.000
Tailored Games or something silly, I don't know.

03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:25.000
But the video,

03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:27.000
if anybody's wanted, the video is

03:05:27.000 --> 03:05:29.000
called, um, I believe it's called

03:05:29.000 --> 03:05:31.000
That Robot Has a Temper. I actually have a cell

03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:33.000
phone call with Claptrap, and he's, like,

03:05:33.000 --> 03:05:35.000
cussing and all this different stuff, so it's

03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:37.000
pretty fun. And, uh, yeah, but just

03:05:37.000 --> 03:05:39.000
tell me, you know, if they want a free copy, you know,

03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:41.000
just send them on over. Alright.

03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:43.000
Poor people who love

03:05:43.000 --> 03:05:45.000
Borderlands. Hey, I'm poor.

03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:47.000
I got a four month old.

03:05:47.000 --> 03:05:49.000
You're not that poor if you're giving away a copy

03:05:49.000 --> 03:05:51.000
of Borderlands 2. No, I think that's great.

03:05:51.000 --> 03:05:53.000
I, I, uh, I,

03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:55.000
I fully support the indie press in all forms,

03:05:55.000 --> 03:05:57.000
so go check that out, everybody. Alright, good luck

03:05:57.000 --> 03:05:59.000
with your YouTubes, and we'll talk to you in a later week,

03:05:59.000 --> 03:06:01.000
okay? Alright, thank you, Rob. I appreciate it.

03:06:01.000 --> 03:06:03.000
No problem. Take care, buddy.

03:06:03.000 --> 03:06:05.000
You too. Bye.

03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:07.000
Alright, that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight. That was a good

03:06:07.000 --> 03:06:09.000
guy. I love the long time listener

03:06:09.000 --> 03:06:11.000
first time callers, and he handled that very well.

03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:13.000
He didn't, he didn't freeze up.

03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:15.000
Sometimes people, when they're new, like, hello, hello,

03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:17.000
am I on? Hello? Hello? Echo? What? Hello?

03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:19.000
He was... Very good, uh, phone presence.

03:06:19.000 --> 03:06:21.000
Yes. You get a, I don't,

03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:23.000
I don't know if we could give a gold star for that,

03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:25.000
but you would definitely get, like, a silver star.

03:06:25.000 --> 03:06:27.000
Alright.

03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:29.000
Platinum for me.

03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:31.000
Alright, uh, that's gonna do it.

03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:33.000
For the bow tie, for the bow tie. Yeah, that's true.

03:06:33.000 --> 03:06:35.000
The bow tie was pretty awesome. Alright, that's gonna do it

03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:37.000
for the, uh, Skype calls tonight.

03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:39.000
If you didn't get through, don't be mad.

03:06:39.000 --> 03:06:41.000
Send tweets. You know, TigerClaw's

03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:43.000
like the only one that's been sending tweets this week,

03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:45.000
so you can either send tweets, or, you can send us

03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:47.000
an email. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

03:06:47.000 --> 03:06:49.000
Speaking of TigerClaw's tweets,

03:06:49.000 --> 03:06:51.000
I did want to get through these real quick.

03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:53.000
Uncharted and The Director Changeover.

03:06:53.000 --> 03:06:55.000
Uh, David O. Russell

03:06:55.000 --> 03:06:57.000
had been on there. He had made the movie

03:06:57.000 --> 03:06:59.000
I Heart Huckabees. Well, he's not there anymore.

03:06:59.000 --> 03:07:01.000
Neil Berger left the project.

03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:03.000
Uh, who is on the project now?

03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:05.000
The, the writers of

03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:07.000
National Treasure,

03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:09.000
Marianne and Cormac Wiberly.

03:07:09.000 --> 03:07:11.000
God, I hate Nicolas Cage.

03:07:11.000 --> 03:07:13.000
It's like, I have no frame

03:07:13.000 --> 03:07:15.000
of reference, cause I refuse to see those movies.

03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:17.000
You know what? The only good thing

03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:19.000
he did was raising Arizona. They seem

03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:21.000
topical enough.

03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:23.000
I don't know. I guess I could see

03:07:23.000 --> 03:07:25.000
a movie like that leading to Uncharted, but

03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:27.000
alright. So, there you go.

03:07:27.000 --> 03:07:29.000
Um,

03:07:29.000 --> 03:07:31.000
let's see. Oh, Neil Berger

03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:33.000
directed Limitless,

03:07:33.000 --> 03:07:35.000
and he left, and then he

03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:37.000
he had replaced somebody else.

03:07:37.000 --> 03:07:39.000
So, who's directing it now?

03:07:39.000 --> 03:07:41.000
I don't think they have a

03:07:41.000 --> 03:07:43.000
director right now. I'm looking right now.

03:07:43.000 --> 03:07:45.000
It's not gonna happen. Who knows?

03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:47.000
They may still make one.

03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:49.000
Nope, they just say

03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:51.000
somebody left. Alright. Uh,

03:07:51.000 --> 03:07:53.000
one more. Oh, I like this. This is

03:07:53.000 --> 03:07:55.000
nice. Out

03:07:55.000 --> 03:07:57.000
of all the bad news we've had

03:07:57.000 --> 03:07:59.000
tonight, I like

03:07:59.000 --> 03:08:01.000
a little bit of good news. So, thank you,

03:08:01.000 --> 03:08:03.000
Tigerclaw, for sending this. And I think this is

03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:05.000
a good note to end on tonight, although Loki

03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:07.000
may have last minute stories. Actually, no, I want to end on

03:08:07.000 --> 03:08:09.000
this. Loki, do you have any last minute stories before I get to this?

03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:11.000
Eh, some, some MMOs

03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:13.000
stole a map from Counter-Strike.

03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:15.000
That's all we need to know. Big deal.

03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:17.000
Alright.

03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:19.000
Here you go. A nice thing to end on.

03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:21.000
Thank you, Tigerclaw. Microsoft

03:08:21.000 --> 03:08:23.000
is throwing an industry mixer

03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:25.000
for the folks from OnLive

03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:27.000
who are affected by the restructuring.

03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:29.000
Uh, they are scouting

03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:31.000
for Xbox-oriented positions

03:08:31.000 --> 03:08:33.000
for Mountain View, California, and

03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:35.000
Redmond, Washington. A quote from

03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:37.000
Microsoft on the public invitation,

03:08:37.000 --> 03:08:39.000
We are eager to speak to individuals and teams

03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:41.000
affected by the OnLive transition.

03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:43.000
We are looking to add key

03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:45.000
players who want to make a real impact

03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:47.000
in creating groundbreaking new products

03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:49.000
and services. I gotta

03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:51.000
say, what a great way to answer

03:08:51.000 --> 03:08:53.000
Sony getting Gaikai.

03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:55.000
Just hire the old OnLive employees

03:08:55.000 --> 03:08:57.000
for your company. Sounds good.

03:08:57.000 --> 03:08:59.000
Amazing. Amazing.

03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:01.000
Oh, Dark Tetsuya sending a late tweet here.

03:09:01.000 --> 03:09:03.000
I finished updating the wiki

03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:05.000
with recently found episodes.

03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:07.000
So, Dark Tetsuya doing a wiki

03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:09.000
update. Thank you, Dark Tetsuya.

03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:11.000
Thank you, fans, for updating

03:09:11.000 --> 03:09:13.000
that wiki. You guys are amazing.

03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:15.000
orangeloungeradio.wikia

03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:17.000
W-I-K-I-A dot com.

03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:19.000
You guys make sure that I don't repeat games.

03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:21.000
You use it as a source.

03:09:21.000 --> 03:09:23.000
I use it all the time.

03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:25.000
It impacts what we do here on the show.

03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:27.000
Alright, I see you guys are packing up. I know you gotta

03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:29.000
get out. We all got work tomorrow. We've gone

03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:31.000
long tonight. But thank you guys for staying up

03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:33.000
late with us. We really appreciate it. We can't

03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:35.000
end the show, however, until we get to the final thoughts.

03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:37.000
So, let's do some final thoughts.

03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:39.000
Um, Dark Sakura, start us off

03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:41.000
tonight. I don't want to go to bed.

03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:43.000
Uh, Loki,

03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:45.000
your final thoughts tonight? Um,

03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:47.000
I don't know.

03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:49.000
I want to wear this shirt to work.

03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:51.000
I'm going to. Alright,

03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:53.000
you should. Um, my final thought

03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:55.000
is, because I neglected to say

03:09:55.000 --> 03:09:57.000
it at the start of part B, as

03:09:57.000 --> 03:09:59.000
I plan to, I do want to say

03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:01.000
rest in peace to Neil Armstrong.

03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:03.000
Um, but what an amazing

03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:05.000
life to have actually gone

03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:07.000
to the moon. I mean, that's something we all dream about

03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:09.000
as kids. And, like, he actually did it.

03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:11.000
So, yes, it's unfortunate that

03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:13.000
he passed, but let's not focus on the

03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:15.000
fact he died. Let's focus on the fact

03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:17.000
that, like, like

03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:19.000
he did something that all of us dream about.

03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:21.000
And I think that's just amazing.

03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:23.000
So, a tip of the hat to Neil Armstrong.

03:10:23.000 --> 03:10:25.000
That's going to do it for. Well, that doesn't

03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:27.000
directly actually go with video games, too.

03:10:27.000 --> 03:10:29.000
How so? Do you know that?

03:10:29.000 --> 03:10:31.000
Because Buzz Aldrin was the voice of the guy in the end

03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:33.000
of Mass Effect 3. Sure, sure.

03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:35.000
You know, they were all kind of. That's a tie.

03:10:35.000 --> 03:10:37.000
I'm just trying to say. But, yeah,

03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:39.000
that was pretty. And Phyllis Diller.

03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:41.000
Yeah, rest in peace Phyllis Diller.

03:10:41.000 --> 03:10:43.000
She was so awesome. We've lost a lot of great people

03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:45.000
over the past couple of weeks. It's really sad. And the guy who was the

03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:47.000
Count. Mm-hmm.

03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:49.000
And Cry. Yeah. Tragic, tragic.

03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:51.000
And the lady who was the astronaut.

03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:53.000
Sally Ride. Yeah.

03:10:53.000 --> 03:10:55.000
That was a few weeks ago. We didn't

03:10:55.000 --> 03:10:57.000
mention it on the show. It may have been a week you weren't here,

03:10:57.000 --> 03:10:59.000
but. That means just, like, a bunch of people just.

03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:01.000
Yeah. It's very unfortunate. Very unfortunate.

03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:03.000
But, um, you know,

03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:05.000
look at accomplishments. Look ahead.

03:11:05.000 --> 03:11:07.000
Look ahead to two weeks.

03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:09.000
We'll be back with an all new episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:11.000
Have a wonderful Labor Day weekend,

03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:13.000
you guys. Be safe. Enjoy

03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:15.000
catching up on video games.

03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:17.000
Um, thank you for supporting Independent Radio.

03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:19.000

03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:23.000
magazine contracts and so forth.

03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:25.000
We don't have a gigantic website backing us.

03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:27.000
It's all community based. It's all about you guys.

03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:29.000

03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:41.000
heard. We'll be back in a couple weeks to do

03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:43.000
it all again. Have a wonderful break. We'll see you next

03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:45.000
time on Orange Lounge Radio.

03:11:45.000 --> 03:12:05.000
Good night.

03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:17.000
See you next week.

03:12:45.000 --> 03:12:47.000
Bye.
