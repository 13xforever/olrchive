{"text": " Tonight, August 19th, 2012, we run down the news from Gamescom, the 3DS XL is released, and the Neo Geo console is set to be released all over again. Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, for this August 19th, 2012, with the 470th episode of our program. My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about everything going on in the world of gaming, and then some, with my co-hosts. First off, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers. Hi. How are you ma'am? I'm sore. Sore? Yes. What have you been doing that's made you sore? Well, hey! What kind of girl do you think I am? A DDR playing girl? Yes, actually. Oh, okay. We'll touch on that in a minute. Alright, fair enough. Say hello as well to Techmaster Loki. Hi. How are you doing, Loki? Doing good. What food won the, for those that play the home game of betting on what you bring in for food every week, what won this week? The Double Western at Carl's Jr., or Hardee's on the East Coast. There you go. Alright, oh, of course, the always present fourth guest on our show is you guys at our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, and we'll be reading some of the comments from our chat room throughout the night, so be sure to get in there so you can participate with us. Just the three of us in studio, this is the first show in a little while, it seems like, with no guests. It's a little lonely. It's a little lonely and sad in here tonight, and I don't know how we're going to top last week's episode. That was a pretty good episode, so we'll try though. We'll bring our best C game tonight. No, you know what? We actually have some awesome things tonight that are- We could point a webcam at my boobs or something, I don't know. Oh, the webcam's in the other, no, you took the webcam, didn't you? I did take it, and it works. You confiscated it, so no booby cam tonight. No booby cam. Well, it's so unfortunate that your Dell million doesn't have a webcam built into it. Oh, wait, it does. That's true. I do have my iPad. No. And the Ustream app on the iPad. And I've made sure that the webcam stuff is disabled on my laptop, because I deleted all the Windows shit and have the Linux shit, so. All right, in all seriousness, we have some fun stuff going on tonight. We have a soundtrack preview going on tonight, which is pretty cool, from the Darksiders to Soundtrack. And this is going to be both for the podcast listeners and the live listeners, thanks to Something Music, S-U-M, Thing, but I'll talk more about that later on, but there's all sorts of information on where you can get the soundtrack at our website, vognetwork.com. Of course, the Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com is the website where we tape our show live for you kids every Sunday night at 6 p.m. Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after our pal Bobby Black Wolf with his show, The Bobby Black Wolf Show, at 5 Pacific, 8 Eastern, every Sunday. And lots of other great shows at the Voice of Geeks Network as well. Not just gaming shows, but shows about TV talk, like Critical Myth, and they do some movies as well, British Invaders, kind of a similar thing, but with a very British twist. Pod Culture is awesome, and Pod Culture's got something special tomorrow. They're back with an all-new episode, they've been off for a couple weeks, but they are talking to somebody who's publishing a series of books, and I'm not sure if I'm supposed to give, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to say this, so a little preview, they're actually doing a giveaway, so be sure to tune in and check that out at Pod Culture. Lots of other great shows too. Anime Jam Session, Girls Gone Wild, Hoard House, Hoard House is okay, but the rest of the shows are great. All right, let's see, we usually start off the show talking about our gaming weeks, but we usually have a kick-off topic, and I thought I'd bring up something that's a little bit recurring. Crack! What was the first time we talked about crack on the show? No, no. Two drugs, kids, drugs are bad. So okay, y'all know we have a little bit of a history with Kickstarter, and kind of like talking about that site, and we're not always a fan of a lot of the things we see on Kickstarter, or at least I should say, I'm not always a fan of a lot of the stuff I see on Kickstarter. Dark Soccer has not always been a fan of the stuff she sees on Kickstarter. Loki has contributed way too many Kickstarters. It wasn't that many. How many? How many? How many's not that many? It's at least five, right? Six. See? Seven, I'm sorry. All right, well here's the point. I donated to a Kickstarter this week. I actually finally joined the website. I signed up for Kickstarter. It was to expand the Mantis website. No, no. Heck no. Oh, make that nine. Sorry. Nine Kickstarters? Suddenly, this week... You know, you can just take that money and give it to me, and I'll put it to better use. This week from maybe five to nine? Well, there was some I forgot. I forgot, you know, I forgot about those playing cards. And they're awesome. They are. Dan was like, wow, that's cool. I forgot about the Megran thing, which I'm still waiting on. There's apparently the comic coming too, but you know, it's still coming, and then Shadowrun Returns. Shadowrun Returns would be awesome. Can't wait for that. But yeah, so I actually donated to a Kickstarter this week. I even went so far as to donate $180 to this Kickstarter, $180 to this Kickstarter. Cue dramatic chipmunk or prairie dog. There's nothing like a meme from five years ago to lighten the mood. I gave 180 bucks to the GamerCon Kickstarter, the G-A-Y GamerCon Kickstarter. I think it's a great idea, and I can totally see where being a startup event, they really need the money to be able to reserve the venue and do something big, and it's been great promotion for them. And you know, as somebody who's a gamer myself, it's something I want to support. So Alan kind of made it known that he wouldn't mind going, and I wouldn't mind going. So if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do it big. I don't do anything half-assed. So I threw down for VIP passes for both Alan and I, which sent me back 180 bucks. So yeah, there you go. I donated to a Kickstarter. You going to judge me, anybody? Dark Soccer, you want to judge me? I'm totally not judging you, but that means I can start my Kickstarters to support me while I write a book. I'll give you 50 cents. What will that get me? It'll get you a fart. No, but I know there's a lot of people that are like, why does there have to be a GamerCon? Does that mean there's going to be a StraightmerCon, and you know, just kind of all this. Well Straightmer doesn't have the same ring to it, whereas gamer sounds like- Heterocon or whatever it is. It's not that- If I can get the boobies in there, that'd be kind of cool. Here's the thing- I bet there is a BoobCon. I'm going to look for it. Here's the thing. Okay, BoobCon is every other gaming convention, and there'll probably be some BoobCon at GamerCon. Let's not forget the lesbians. There is a BoobCon. I think that's- Oh, it's a Facebook utility. The whole thing is, is that, you know, I like the idea of having this event and to bring gay gamers together, because I've met a lot of really cool people. One of my really good friends I met at a gay gamer event in the Bay Area, and we're friends to this day. My friend Spike, who is one of the co-hosts on the Game Buoy, we met at like one of those gay gamer parties, and you know, it's not that straight people are forbidden from coming. In fact, I'm sure DarkSakura is going to pre-order as soon as she's got them, as soon as she has her Kickstarter funded, she's going to pre-order a ticket to GamerCon, right? I'd go. Yeah. I don't know that I'd be able to afford, you know, $90 tickets. You're not going to be shunned because you have boobies, and you're not going to be shunned- I'll just wear a shirt that says HAG. But here's the other thing, is that, you know, obviously, I don't know how far I want to go with this controversial topic or whatever, but in the gaming culture, you know, a lot of times gay guys and ladies have to put up with all this garbage we hear on Xbox Live and, you know, FAG, FAG, FAG, and it's not like we're alone, there's a lot of like racist stuff that happens, there's a lot of like really, really bad things that happen on Xbox Live. Why do you think I only play with you guys? And everything negative usually has some type of connotation to like, oh so-and-so's a fag, ugh. It's because the people that play on Xbox Live, and actually just a lot of people that play games nowadays online, are very unintelligent and young. I know that for a fact from the modding community, that I talk to these people directly, and it's like, can you guys compose an actual sentence without sounding stup- or like, seriously, can you compose a sentence that actually makes sense, that doesn't have like any sort of complete misspellings of everything? But here's, here's the other part that I think a lot of people ignore. And that is that, as a gay guy, there's a lot of judgment that happens in gay culture as well. I know, that might be shocking to you, but sometimes as a gay gamer, I don't wanna s- I don't wanna sound like, oh poor me, or I've had a tragic life, no, I've had a great life. But I have faced sometimes, you know, in the gay culture even, people like, oh, you s- play video games all day? You mean you don't like, you don't like to, uh- Accessorize? You don't like to go to concerts, or you don't listen to such and such artists, or you don't read such and such blogs, or you know, a lot of those types of things. Shun! Exactly! I ha- I, I know this might be a thing I'm not supposed to say, but it's true. I have faced some of that in the gay culture. So it's tough sometimes, because you don't feel like you fit in column A, you don't feel like you fit in column B. So, I think there- it's, it's really awesome that there's a lot of people raising their voice, thanks to, you know, the internet, that feel like they kind of don't fit in these columns, and having a convention to just celebrate. We're here! And it, there's- I don't, I don't think the, the con exists to make a statement, or the con exists to, uh, further the cause, or whatever. I think the con exists to have fun, and that's what I plan to do. I'm just gonna have, I'm gonna have a gay old time, and gay isn't happy. I'm gonna have a gay old time. It's gonna be a good time. Well, I mean, the only other equivalent is YowieCon, really. And YowieCon exists. And that's more for girls. I think GamerCon is just for, for anybody that just wants to have fun. Sounds- In a supportive environment. Great. And besides that, you were talking about columns? Fuck columns. That game was shit. No. No, no, no. I, I think that the moment we can move past labels and pointing fingers is why, you know, when anyone says, well, I have this, or I am this, I'm like, um, you look like you're a human being to me. Act like it? Mm-hmm. So, yeah. So. Anyhow. I mean, this is what I'm just talki- oh, sorry. No, go ahead. I was gonna go to some chat comments, but go ahead. This is what I was talking about, about people that can't fucking complete sentences. Okay, this is the guy that I'm talking to right now, I'm working on some Grand Theft Auto mods, okay? Did you, you know, just let her you get it to work, okay, that makes sense. How about this one? Should we take thing away? Um, okay, just let me know, because trying to get it by today, um, okay, that is fine, what do you thi- what do you think it is? And just let me know when you get it to work. Oh my fucking god. How is Babbie formed? It's like, seriously, it, ugh. Let me go to some comments from our chat room at, uh, live.vognetwork.com, where we have plenty of folks in chat participating live with us tonight. JV Mon wants to know, where is GamerCon anyway? They haven't picked a venue yet, it's gonna be in San Francisco, they've said that much, but we don't know what venue, I mean, that could be a lot of different places, that could be a hotel, they could do it at the Hilton, they could do it at the Moscone Center if they get enough money, I don't know where they're gonna have it yet, um, so, more to come on that, but it will be in San Francisco somewhere, uh, Acidic Vamp- which is another reason why I wanted to go, is that, you know, San Francisco's only a two-hour drive for me, I could drive in and out every day if I wanted to, but I have some friends in the city, like Grandpa from Hoard House I could stay with if I wanted to, um, Acidic Vampire in chat says, to find more gamers, because- G-A-Y-mers, because it's like a needle in a haystack sometimes. Uh, Raginator says, sadly enough, when someone proclaims that they're a gamer to someone, the other person immediately pictures a fat, balding, middle-aged slob eating Cheetos in their mom's basement and never goes outside. Hey, I like Cheetos, just for the record. Ew! But ex- but no, I mean, exactly the point, is that, you know, there's kind of these, like, stereotypes, and it- it's throughout all of our cultures, so. And speaking of Cheetos, you know what's wrong with Cheetos? Is they have those giant Cheetos. I mean, really, the Chee- the cheese powder to whatever else Cheetos are made out of ratio is just fucked up by that, I mean. So Loki, any chance that you would go to gamercon? Probably not, because I'm not really allowed to travel right now, you know. So- But what if you told- what if you told the wife it was a gay gamer convention? She'd laugh, she would get a kick out of that. Yeah, she'd probably laugh at that, because- We should- we should try to get a panel, I would love that. Would she let you go if we had a panel? Perhaps, yeah. I think we should. Totally get us a panel. We'll see what we can do, I don't know. And free tickets. Alright, moving on. Let's talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week, and how was your gaming week? Dark soccer, you hinted at this a minute ago? I played the ditter. My leg- okay, this is what happened. Alright. That's dance dance revolution for the uninformed. Yes. I, um, was working at this place, and everyone knows I got laid off, but, you know, it was very, uh, it was an amicable break-up, amicable break-up. Um, I still got to go to the company picnic, which was at Goffland, on like some corporate picnic day. So, yeah, there were still a bunch of annoying teenagers, but it was okay. Um, but, you got one of those little bracelets that let you get go-karts and a laser tag, which I didn't do either, um, and get in the water park, which I didn't do either. Um, but, uh, we just went in and had a good time, but, um, while we were waiting for lunch to be served, I went inside to go play some DDR, because we also got 20 credits on one of those little cards. Um, well, there were already three credits in the DDR, so I'm like, I'll play them all. It was on four songs. So I played 12 songs back to back and decided that I'm going to finish out with Superstar, because I- dammit, I'm not old, I can still do it, although I did fail Cowgirl, which is very sad, because that used to be, like, one of my best ones. Bang badoo bang. I know. But, and I made it through that, and by the time I got done, I felt like I needed to throw up, because I was hot, and I hadn't done anything strenuous like that in a while. And that's the point where you realized, I was in my DDR Prime 10 years ago. When I weighed 30 pounds more than I do now, which is sad. So anyway, I was- I went and had a good time at lunch, and I felt better once I ate something, and, you know, had a good time, and my BFF Forever's Becky was there with the boy and her hubby. Hi, they're listening. Hi, Ro. Hi, Ro. And it was, you know, we had a really good time, and Dan and I played copious amounts of Tank Tank Tank, and there's this other game, too, that I- Are you guys going to pick that up on Wii U? Is it coming out? Yeah, Tank Tank Tank's going to be one of the launch games for Wii U. I don't know that we're getting a Wii U, but I fucking want that game, so maybe we will. Okay, I'm trying to find the name of this game. Okay, it's a Sega game called Let's Go Island, Lost on the Island of Tropics, and it's a shooter game where you're on a- Oh, I saw that, yeah. Yeah, where you're on a boat, and it's one of those quirky little Sega games, of course I loved it immediately, and you play as this girl and the tour guide, and all of a sudden terrorists are on your boat, and they're shooting sharks and everything, and then they get eaten by the sharks, and then you're underwater being drug along by the- You're on a boat, and you're fighting terrorists and sharks? This game has everything. It's great. When you finish each, the boss of the first level is this huge manga squid, and you also have to jerk your controller in a certain way to get past these little cut scenes. It's pretty cute, but- That sounds all sorts of like, how was that game called? Yeah, well, I totally interrupted that. It's one of their gun shooting games that was really awesome that I loved that was on the Wii, and also in the arcade. Freaking Sega, of course. Anyway, so when you finish the level, though, it does a compatibility meter to see how compatible you are, and Dan and I were 60%, but it's also funny when you shoot the same things, it gives you this twin bonus, and you get little hearts and everything flowing out of it, but I died at the second stage, and so Dan continued, and he made it a little bit further, and then when you get less than 10% compatibility, it says you wouldn't sit next to him on the bus. I was like, wow, that's kind of cold. And then I played more DDR, and Dan played with me, and he's like, I forgot how to play. I never, ever saw Dan play DDR. Dan used to play my Dreamcast one with me. Fun. He could, the hardest he could do was Dynamite Rave. Dan was one of those guys who didn't want to admit he played DDR. But the hardest thing that he could do was Dynamite Rave Easy. So I picked that as the last one, because he wanted to play all the old stuff, except for Burning Heat, which, you know, Gradius. So we played all the fun stuff, and I kept him alive, and it was just really, we had a good time, but by the time I got out of the car after we got home, my legs had started to cramp up. I was like, wow, how much jumping and running was I doing? So I was like, I'm out of practice. So we actually discussed this. We're going to hook back up our JPS2 and start playing our DDR games again, because I've got those dance pads that I got at the thrift store that were like three for six bucks, and like one of them didn't work. The other two did. So we're going to start playing DDR getting home. Good luck. Thanks. It's all part of the plan. Now, I got to say, when I went to Golf Land a couple weeks ago, I was, I was depressed. Everything was, everything was broken, too many people, hot, gross, not fun. It was clean, shiny, and extra air conditioned. The only thing I got a kick out of was the gigantic Tetris game. I love that. You can play the giant balls. I also played more games, more games, because I'm still playing through Mass Effect 2 for Becky with a Para Themshep and Garrus, totally Garrus. I'm still playing through Mass Effect 3, which I'm still at the same part that I am, and every time I load it up, I just get depressed and turn it back off, and I want to play more multiplayer next week. Does it involve Mordin? No. Oh, okay. No, um, um, um, I already passed that. I'm on Thessia. Oh, okay. Oh yeah. That part. But this time I'm taking Javok with me and not Garrus. Garrus gets to stay home and not be depressed. How considerate of you. I'm very, very considerate of Turians and their sensitive natures. Um, I have my fourth 85 in WoW. Addict. Dealer. How many do you have? I got my fifth this week. Well, I got my four in last time. I now have two druids at 85. I'm on my way to my second druid, but so now that means I have, uh, in order, Arissa, the mage, Rebecca Black, the paladin, Garrus, the shadow priest, and Sakurina. So next in line is probably going to be, um, uh, the troll, a city vampire in our chat room reminds us Leviathan is coming. The DLC for mass. I know someone's excited. Yeah. Yeah. I can't wait to check it out. It's just, why does this all have to hit the same day? Leviathan Guild Wars two and the big wow patch all hit the same day. I think that probably 10 bucks. I think the Vita patch is that day too. I don't know. We have a story on it later. I'm not playing Guild Wars. I want to check it out, but I, at least there's no monthly fee. I know Guild Wars and one of those things I can kind of look at anytime. Yeah. But I mean, I've still got a, I'm probably, to be honest, not going to get, um, the well thing right away, except, um, if I ever get paid for one of my projects, maybe I'll buy it, you know, as a treat to myself. It's just like while I still got other, other tunes to work on, like what's the point, you know? Yeah. The thing that I'm excited about for a while is that I know this isn't courthouse, but I'm excited that, um, all of the races are going to be available, like from the get go for everybody. Yeah. That was, uh, yeah. And that's not in our news role tonight. Cause I was going to save that for courthouse, which is fine. But yeah, the, the big news about, uh, anybody can play any race except don't expect to play a Panda next Tuesday. Pandas will unlock with Pandaria. However, you don't have to have Mr. Pandaria to roll a Panda, but you will need to go past level 85. Yeah. So, but I mean, it's still, I'm probably, cause I mean, I did temp work. I have enough to buy the game and I'm sure I'll probably get it cause I'm still paying for the shit till March, uh, tiger claw in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says speaking of wow, I saw that Mr. Pandaria trailer. The first thing that came on my mind after watching it, a bad-ass version of Kung Fu Panda. The trailer was released this week out of games com, the new world of Warcraft trailer. It looked great. The, the CGI was beautiful and you know, with all this talk about a world of Warcraft movie and all this, it's like, just do that for 90 minutes would be great. Although I have to say overall, I was a little disappointed in the trailer. The reason why is that I would hope that the cinematic trailer for it would show like a little bit of everything. And there's so much beauty in this expansion in the realm of Pandaria and some of these new five mans. They don't really show any of that. Like I wanted to see a rendered version of the temple, the Jade serpent and some of that gorgeous stuff. Well, I've just been looking at, um, at, uh, data dumps. So for some of the, the internal stuff, you know, basically people just doing run throughs of the empty temples and the dungeons and everything. So this looks pretty neat. Nice. All right. Before we turn into an episode of Horde House, let's let you finish up. We'll move on to Loki. Well, um, I'm also very pissed off at all the people nudging me on words with friends and I'm about ready to delete it. Yeah. I'm getting that with song pop. I'm kind of over song pop now. Like it was fun for two weeks, but now, now I've moved on to another game. I, and I can't help it and I'm glad I didn't pay for the game and I'm not paying for any of it, but I still like draw something. And the only reason I'm still playing is because I haven't paid for it and I'm not looking at any ads. So I'm all cool. I have drawn some perverted shit in that game. All right. Loki. Um, let's see. I played Call of Duty, modern warfare three, a little bit of that and Minecraft, a whole lot of Minecraft, um, getting bored with it again. It's just like, I think the problem is I don't have a lot of people to play with and that's really odd considering there's like so many people that bought the game, but, um, none of my friends seem to be playing games that, you know, we can join in or whatever. So I'm playing with my coworker and we're just like the map that we're on, we've kind of explored everything. I got to the point where I'm like, okay, fuck it. I'm going to go ahead and start duping again because there's still a way you can do stuff. So I duped a bunch of dynamite and just create a hole and I was like, wow, create a crater board still. It's like, may I interject one thing? Yeah. I saw one thing that made me love Minecraft. It was this video that someone did and lined up explosives, everything that says I love and when it exploded it said, but that's so mature. I love it. I love that. That might be cause you know, dark soccer, if you've been listening to previous episodes, she's not very, she kind of frowns on Minecraft, but I love that. I love, butts may have cracked the door open a little bit to dark soccer getting on the right crap. It cracked the door. I'm not saying it made me like the game, but it made me laugh like my ass off, like and that and seeing people making giant pigs and like goombas and Mario and shit. That was pretty funny. You do realize I have a giant pig in my map that I have made. I was talking about your giant pig. Anyways, moving on. I did happen to see like, for example, like something that was more structured to be kind of fun, like with other people, I watched a kind of a, one of those, we play things it was with the, machinima, I think they do that. And it was a bunch of people playing, it's like a, like a survival type game where they had to go out the store and survive. They had three torches, a wooden sword, and a couple pork chops. And just like, okay, last man standing, whoever gets back, you know, the last person to live has to get back to the, you know, the safe house. And then, you know, we'll score a point and it's the first person in the seven. And that was really hilarious. Like the Minecraft hunger games. Certainly. They have that. They have that too. But this is like, it was sort of like that. But that looked like fun. See, more of the structured stuff with like a lot of people, sounds like a lot of fun with Minecraft. In fact, when we first started playing, when it was like you, me and Bobby and then like other people joining in, that was fun. But now when it's just like myself and no one comes in, you know, to these worlds and stuff, it just gets pretty boring. I don't know. I think that's why I kind of turned away from Minecraft in the first time. I kind of checked it out. Ironically though, I did also check out another Minecraft-esque game because it was cheap and it was featured in an article I read. It was Castle Builder Z. And Castle Builder Z is on the Xbox Live Indie Games. It is only a dollar. Eighty Microsoft points. So worth checking out for that kind of amount of money. It's like Minecraft with your avatars, with really crappy looking graphics, I mean even like crappier than... I was like, Minecraft isn't exactly known for its, you know, graphical finesse. It's like, you know, they made their own textures. It looks like a bad texture pack on Minecraft. But you have guns and you can craft weapons and stuff like that. And it's zombies. Would guns make you more interested in Minecraft? Maybe. And there's zombies. Yeah, I understand there's zombies normally in Minecraft, but these aren't the zombies that are in the regular Minecraft. These are like, I'm gonna run at you at full speed and jump in the air and try to kill you zombies. And there's a dragon that tries to kill you as well. It pretty much the whole game is like, very, very... It's not... I don't know. It's kinda scary. The sound that they have in there kinda sounds like one of those Halloween tapes or CDs and stuff with all the Halloween spooky sounds. But that's pretty much it. And it's just like, I ended up barricading myself into a cave or something because the first time out I was like, okay crap, you know, this looks like night all the time. I mean, when it's daytime it's gloomy and lightning outside and when it's nighttime it's dark but there's tons of shit running at you. And so the first time I made the mistake of, oh, I forgot to get wood. Crap. You know, so I'm like waiting in there. I'm like, okay, I better go outside and go try to punch a tree real quick and get some wood. Go punch a tree. Only in Minecraft. So I did that and then all of a sudden I get bum-rushed by a bunch of fucking zombies. Or like, I don't even know, they were just something that was snarling and sounding like a tiger or something but it looked like some sort of monster thing that ran at me. And so I started firing a pistol at it and I didn't really do anything because I got rushed from a few other sides at the same time. And then it's like, okay, that was plain non-normal. And then when you respawn it kind of respawned me close to where I was and immediately all those mobsters, all the monsters that were right there just like crushed at me and I died again. I was like, crap, okay, so I got to do this differently. Anyways, so I finally got it to where I'm like in a cave now and I've mined some stuff and you start building weapons because you don't really have a whole lot you can build in it because it is kind of a knockoff of Minecraft but you don't have like beds, you can't sleep or anything. And then there's, it always sounds like there's monsters trying to dig their way into your tunnel and sometimes they somehow manage to get in there and I think on higher difficulties they can dig through the tunnel and get to you. Yeah. Yeah, it's like, it's fucking creepy. And they're like really silent too until they get up, like I was digging into the wall and all of a sudden, like I noticed my screen turned red and there's a fucking skeleton behind me. It's just like, it's loud everywhere else but then I would have cried and throw out the controller. It's pretty, I think it'd be kind of interesting to check it out. But yeah, 80 Microsoft points, I mean, it's a buck, come on and just try it. If you want to try it, you know, if you play Minecraft, it's kind of fun, you know, you'll get a dollar's worth of entertainment out of it. And in general, don't forget about indie games. Don't forget about Xbox indie game. There's a lot of fun stuff on there. It's not bad. I mean, Castle Miner was one of those series, it was one of like two or three series that were on indie games that were kind of mimicking Minecraft for a long time before Minecraft came out and they still do and they still sell all right. But they're fun in their own right and it's four player co-op and you can play, you know, online and stuff like that. So it's worth it for like, I mean, come on, you probably have 80 Microsoft points sitting in your account that's just leftover from rock band purchases or something like that. So definitely worth checking out. I mean, there's tons of indie games on there that we're checking out, but that it was kind of fun. All right. Well, if you're done with your gaming week, I'll do mine real quick. Not a lot of new stuff this week. A lot of the stuff from last week, like sound shapes and World of Warcraft and so forth. But I did play two new games. One of them's a little herpy derpy. I'll talk about this real quick. It's an iOS game. I've been playing it mostly on my iPad. It's called Puzzle Craft, which might make you think it's Minecraft, but like puzzle, but it's not. It's actually nothing like that. It's one of those free to, well, no, it's not even free to play. It's 99 cents. But then of course they charge you for all these upgrades in the game, like extra coins and stuff. You don't really have to do it. The crux of the game is that you're building this town and you get all the materials to either get food or get materials to build things in your town in this whole little match game where you, like they call it match three in the description, but it's not bejeweled at all. It's like trace the consecutive line of like all the little pieces of grain in the puzzle. Like try to trace it and then they all disappear and new stuff falls and kind of goes like that over and over. And it's one of those things that's just like so stupid that I'm playing this, but it's addicting. It's just cute and you have this little town of villagers and some of them wear chicken outfits. It's really cute. So whatever. There's that. The other game I've been playing a little bit, just a little bit because it just came out today is New Super Mario Brothers 2 on the 3DS. I did pick that up today. It just came out today, so I haven't had a lot of time to play it, so I can't give it a full review. I'll post something more in depth on vognetwork.com later this week. Plug plug. But how similar is it to New Super Mario Brothers? It's pretty much the same damn game, but is that such a bad thing? Well no, but at the same time it kind of feels a little bit like they didn't put a lot of effort into it if it's pretty similar. Well I mean there are some new stuff. I mean especially with this I kind of think the whole like Mario's after coins. I think it's it's a little bit corny, but some of the power-ups are neat. Like I love the one that turns you into giant, although I guess that was in the previous games too, but I was like ooh giant Mario. And then you know the ones that have the gold coins where you can kick and it leaves like a trail of coins and the fireball that makes all the blocks turn into coins. It was kind of neat. Really where the game shines, as it usually does, is level design. I've played a lot of really well designed levels. Halfway into world one you can, if you find it in the fortress, there's a, I'll give you a hint. You don't want a spoiler, mute your thing for 30 seconds, but here's a hint. In the very first fortress there's a room that you go in with these green blocks that spin around. Look for an exit in that room that's not the main exit. I'll give you that hint. And you'll find yourself in the world mushroom world or whatever, which is kind of like I guess like the secret world. And the stages get a little harder, but like one of them was like really neat design because the way the blocks were, you had to figure out like how you could fall through the blocks to get all the coins. It's kind of hard for me to explain without like showing you a visual, but just like the way the blocks were, it looked like one solid block, but it's got all these lines in it. So you had to, I don't know. 3D doesn't really add anything to the game, but that's okay. I'm totally okay with 3DS games not whoring the crap out of 3D. If you want the 3D stuff, go play Mario 3D Land, which you know did it very well. But yeah, I liked it so far. You know, I'll probably play it to completion and it's got some interesting street pass things where you can play a sequence of three random stages and try to get as many coins as possible. And then you street pass to somebody else and you get their records, so you can try to play the same three stages they did, even though it was randomized. So it's kind of like, I don't know, kind of has that Mario Kart-esque competitive element, which wasn't in any other Mario game so far. So that is something new. I'll give it that. Kind of a little different. I will get into this in the show a little later. They're promising the DLC will be worth it, essentially. So I'm curious about that, because again, level design is where these games tend to shine. Well, this is all they really need to do since the engine was done a few times. Yeah. I mean, I'll be honest in that regard. If I'm going to razz the game, it's that it's really the first Mario game I've played in a long time where I go, this really isn't original, which I know is weird because Mario games are essentially all the same mechanic. But think about it. You know, in the original Super Mario Bros. and then there's Mario Brothers 2. It's like, holy shit, this is totally different. And then Mario Brothers 3 kind of went back more towards the first one. But you know, Mario, if it ain't fixed, don't break it. Mario World was like completely modes. Yeah. Yoshi and all this. Then Mario 64. Oh my God. 3D. Mario Galaxy. Oh my God. The planets and everything is just different. It's like the first one in a long time I've played where I'm like, yeah, okay. It's pretty much the same thing as the last game with some coin grabbing elements. That's the one bad thing I could really say about it. Otherwise it's a Mario game. Like what Super Mario Brothers game has been bad. I'm not talking about spinoff game. I'm not talking about like Mario is missing and all these like spinoff games. What core Mario Brothers game has been bad? Just straight up bad. I don't even think Mario Sunshine you could say was a bad game. I still think Mario Sunshine was great. Mario Sunshine. I mean, yes, it's a formula, but it's a solid fucking formula. Go with it. There you go. I should go to the chat room, live.vognetwork.com. Let's see. Shayna Linko's in chat saying, I'm at a bit over 30K coins so far. It gives me incentive to keep playing. Yeah, the back of the box says something about getting a million coins and I guess you get something special. I don't know. It's probably just all the levels backwards or something. StartUpG says the raccoon power up is back. That is true. It's not Tanooki Mario anymore like it was in the Wii one or the last, no, the Mario 3D Land at the doogie. It's just straight up raccoon Mario, just like you remember it in Mario three. In fact, there's a lot here that's just like you remember it in Mario three. Like you go to world two. It's a desert world. What a shock. It's kind of a lot of the same formula. Well it is the third new Super Mario Brothers game, so maybe it's new Super Mario Brothers. Maybe it's not that new. They should just call it well polished Mario Brothers. Isn't that a little something, you know, it's like really you couldn't have come up with a better name for the series other than, yeah, it's a new Super Mario Brothers game. Interesting point from Dark Tetsuya. Ironically, Mario two's original version, meaning the Japanese version, lost levels here, right? Wasn't too different from Super Mario Brothers one. Just the level layouts and some of the little things they added cranked up the difficulty. That's a great comparison. You know, lost levels or Mario two in Japan really wasn't that different from Mario one. Different graphics, a little different mechanic with Luigi's jumping. Well, and Mario two that we got wasn't even a Mario game originally. Right. But I'm not talking about that. I'm not talking about the whole, that whole thing I'm talking about. Yeah. Where they say, Oh, how innovative, how different. It wasn't even a Mario game. True, true. But I mean, go back to the loss levels or Japanese two and one. That's a very, I mean, I don't think loss levels is a bad game. It's a really, it's a challenging asshole game. It is. And there's some asshole stages in this that I've played so far when you get into those special worlds. So let's see. Tiger claw says the next version would be new, new Super Mario Brothers. Very new Mario Brothers 2015. Well, you know, what's funny here could be a band themed one because new Super Mario Brothers, you too, you know, Oh yeah. What up? G reminds us. Mario two had the poison mushrooms. That was a little different too. Okay. But here's, here's the one tiny concern I have. If I'm already looking at this game going, all right, it's cool, but it's not very, it's not that original. It's not as original as Nintendo wants you to think it is, but what's going to happen when that Wii U Mario game comes out because these games are not coming out with a lot of time apart between them. What's that Wii U Mario going to bring to the table? Isn't that going to be the same damn thing again? It's the same thing. But now with the gimmick that, Hey, look, a fifth person, because I don't know about you, but I always have about five people in my living room wanting to play the Wii. Oh wait, no one wants to play the Wii. Okay. So five people supposedly in this room playing the Wii U and one person is gonna be like, Hey, I'm moving the platforms. Look, I'm, I'm, I'm like, you know, I'm contributing. It's like almost like that dumb person that you have in your room. Well, it's like, you know what? Billy's not going to play the game because he's too stupid. He's going to keep dying. So we're going to let him move the platforms up and down because that's all he can handle. So five people to play this to its full potential. Yes. This game is going to sell like crazy in Utah. Go figure. So it's just, I, if someone even made it, I had to laugh because there was a comment. It was a developer actually, uh, for those get trying stuff on the Wii U. And they were saying, all Nintendo is trying to do is sell a, uh, TV size DS. I'm like, we've been, he's like, why isn't anybody in the games pressing? And they're like, we've been fucking saying that for months. That's all the Wii U is going to be is just a giant DS. He's all, you know, basically the D or the Wii U game pad works well at a demo kiosk. But when you actually back it away from the TV, then you have to constantly look down at your controller and stuff like that too. It just doesn't really flow well. Uh, alpha Kananagram in our chat room says sky. It's going to bring in H fucking D. Okay. I can respect that and all like I'm, you know, Mario and HD will be fine and all, but let's be real. New Super Mario Brothers is not the game I want to see in HD. F fucking zero is the game I want to see in HD. Hello. Or even a new like 3d Mario game would be pretty awesome. That would be awesome. Yeah. I'm like, that's, it's not exactly the greatest starting point. Can you imagine a Metroid prime in HD imagine like a super Mario world esque game in 3d like kind of like Zelda ish, you know, big adventure type game. That would be fucking awesome. Not new Super Mario Brothers. You. All right. Last comment from chat and then we're going to move on with the show. Tiger claw says, but by the way, new Super Mario Brothers two, does it take advantage of the 3d? How does the 3d look on a 2d plane? I think I said this a little bit before, but it doesn't really use the 3d a lot. I mean, it's pretty much the backgrounds on one layer. I mean, there, there are some subtle effects, but, but that's okay. I want to, I want to point this out. Not every 3ds game has to whore the 3d like crazy. I think this is a good thing. It's the 3d is subtle and is not a game changer. If you want a game that whores the 3d, but does it very, very, very well, go play the Mario 3d land, because that was an original Mario game, despite the fact that certainly it has a lot in common with Mario 64 and all that because the 3d brought some awesome elements into it. That game felt very original, despite the fact it was a formula at the end of the day. So go figure maybe, maybe sitting next to Mario 3d land. This game feels a little bit like a step backwards. I don't know. That sounds like a very harsh thing to say. It makes it sound like I don't like gamers, but you know, cause three land was actually pretty innovative and it was a pretty awesome game. I don't know. New Super Mario Bros, the first one was a pretty awesome game, but it's just, you've done it now three times and you're going to do it again one more time and you haven't really changed it up that much. I mean, it's basically like, cause even before it was like, Hey, look, we created this tech demo of the, the Miis running around in like this New Super Mario Brothers thing. And that's, that was the Wii U tech demo. And I'm like, that's just New Super Mario Brothers, but they have, you know, it was just a tech demo. And then guess what they did? Cause they did this with all their fucking tech demos. They turned it into a game. It's like, Oh my fucking God, you didn't do anything. You just, you just have four, you have four people running around in this game, just like you can on the Wii version. Oh, but there's a fifth person that can do shit for some reason. I'll probably still get a Wii U. I got problems. I got problems. Don't get it at launch. We'll see. We'll see. There's nothing coming. There's nothing. Despite everything I'm saying, despite I look, I'm just going to admit it. Despite everything I'm saying here and now about originality and all that. The first time I play that New Super Mario Brothers Wii U or whatever in HD, I'm going to be like, Oh, I want it. And I'll have it cause I want it. I'm not planning, I'm not planning on buying one. I don't, I don't need that system. I don't play the Wii enough. I'm no. All right, let's move on with some gaming news. Oh wait, housekeeping, uh, visit us at twitter.com slash O L R or on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio. And of course visit our network that we are affiliated, affiliated with and tape live at the voice of geeks network or vog network.com I wrote a review of sound shapes so you can check out. That's there. And there's some other, a book review went up last week of Stargate by a, the guy from critical myth and lots of good stuff on the site. So check that out. Vogue network.com let's get into some gaming news. Loki just, I guess tons of Sony shit coming out of games com. Well there's like 20 stories and I'm like, you know what? This is do them all. Let's do them all. Here you go. All kind of tied to each other. Well it's some non Sony stuff real quick. Um, there was a game that Capcom kind of brought out of nowhere. They're calling it kind of the, um, you know, the game of games com. It was remember me, which was kind of cool. It had a little bit of like you hack into people's memories. Um, I always think of that fucking terrible movie with Robert Pattinson that had that twist ending. You remember that it was called remember me? No cause I never saw it. So I don't remember it. It's terrible. The twist ending is terrible too. Yeah. So it was like the watchdogs of game con. It looked pretty awesome. Okay. So it's nice to see there's going to be some of these really big games coming out next year. That are original. Our original. Yes. Exactly. But Sony, Sony was kind of shocking cause they had a press conference during games con and they actually had like a lot of new IPs that they brought out. Um, just like, wow, you know, this is amazing. So one of the games that they showed off was a puppeteer and puppeteer, um, I guess is coming from Sony on or I guess, uh, yeah, Sony online entertainment and it's a new platformer from a Sony Japan studios and it's very, it reminded me of, um, like clockwork night. If you remember that from the Sega Saturn, at least that's what it reminded me of. But it was very unique looking game, like kind of a platformer with this like puppet looking animation, two different things, but it was pretty cool. So they have that come out. Um, another game they had was rain, which kind of reminded me a little bit of limbo. Um, or even that one game, a loss in shadow that came out from Konami. It's basically a PlayStation network game that's going to be coming out that features these invisible, like an invisible boy who, um, can only be seen in rain. Um, so you're wandering around this environment and stuff and solving puzzles based on, uh, you know, this kind of invisible character, which is a kind of neat. And then I don't know what I should think about this one, but until dawn, it's going to be a teen horror movie style game that utilizes the move. That actually sounds kind of awesome. I hope, I hope this is night trap bad. That would be awesome. I think, I think the industry needs a good team, like the annoying parts of night trap, like the watching the monitors. Yeah. The industry needs a game like night trap again. Let's be real. Time to resurrect. Dana Plato. Apparently you play as seven, um, different teenagers facing unspecified horrors in the woods, you know, cause that's pretty much every horror movie, um, at least recently. And then, um, one other thing they showed off wonder book again, and I've got to say this presentation of wonder book was way better than the one that they did at E3. It was shorter and they showed some new stuff, including not only are they going to have the whole, you know, uh, book of spells thing, which looked okay in the new trailer, but they have this new, um, they got a licensing with BBC's walking with dinosaurs, which looks pretty awesome. And digs night crawler, which is kind of a noir fairy tale type game. You play this worm who's a detective solving fairy tale crimes, kind of sounds almost like it could be a book. You know, I think it might even be a book series, but, um, those will be coming out later on. Uh, I think right now wonder book is launching with books of spells and that's it. Wait. So does this mean you have, you have come full circle, full circle and you are a fan of wonder book now? I'm not a fan of it. No, but it looks, it looks interesting for people that might be into that stuff. Like I was thinking for, uh, the accounts I deal with, like ideal library chain or you know, the old libraries in the U S and obviously this type of stuff would be good for them or people that sell books. But no, for me personally, no. You know, what's making a comeback though that ain't got sh or that wonder book ain't got shit on. You know what? You know, what's making a huge comeback. Brace yourself for it. Fucking reading rainbow is back. Seriously? Yeah. It's like, I think it's like an iOS type thing now. Like they're making apps out of it where it's not like a show, but it's like, cause LeVar Burton pimping books better how LeVar Burton associated with it. Like, okay, here's the thing. Imagine if wonder book instead had been called reading rainbow, we would all be losing our shit over it. All they had to do is get LeVar Burton out on stage going, it's the shit guys. We would have been like, take my money, take it, take it of the intro to this show. I love that old logo too. It's so eighties and gorgeous. The only thing that pissed me off about reading rainbow is that the books were always checked out at the library. You try to go find the books. They were always gone. No one in Alabama reads. Some other cool stuff, um, before all that they were showing media molecules new game and it's just fantastically and it's a game called tear away. It's on the Vita and basically the whole world kind of looks like paper. And so a lot of the stuff you can do in there, you can actually interact with the game. So like you can push your finger up on the back of the touch panel and you'll actually see your finger coming through the screen, which is kind of weird. Um, you can literally finger your Vita. You can literally finger your via, yes. Um, but it's going to utilize the camera in different motion based stuff and it looks fantastic cause it's meeting molecule. I mean, come on. I'm sorry. I'm just so glad the Vita's finally found a use for that back touch pad. Now you can watch your finger go up the Vita. Yep. Yep. You can. Uh, they showed off a kill zone mercenary, which is going to be a new first person shooter on the Vita. Uh, look kind of cool. They also showed call of duty black ops declassified, which I was very interested in picking it up until I realized that it's the guys that made the last resistance game, burning skies and that game sucked. So probably not going to pick up this call of duty game. Can we go back to the fingering thing for a minute? A sitting vampire in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says someone's going to put their Dick on it. So what would happen if you put something besides it? Stances like someone hasn't already, what would happen if you put like something else on the back touch? Here's the thing. I don't really understand how it works because they're going to have, it actually is an image of your finger. It like utilizes the camera. Like it captures that. So yes, you would see a penis coming up through the back of the screen. If you were somehow, or would your penis turn into a finger? I don't know. All right. Well, I'm assuming it's not, I'm, that's a really big finger. I don't know. For some people maybe really small. Is that your thumb? Cause there's no way for the camera to capture the image of your finger, you know, on that back touch panel. It just doesn't, it's out of the scope of the lens, but I don't know. I mean, let's say have you capture your finger, but I think that yes, that is your finger look like a sea cucumber. This is one of the great mysteries. What will happen when you put your Dick on the rear touch pad? Find out on the next OLR. You'll make it, you'll make a mess. I don't want to have that trade in system. Yeah. I played a lot of tear away alone at night. There's too much penis. Speaking of, uh, into windows, I guess ratchet and clank full frontal assault is coming to the Vita as well. You did that on purpose. Rob's red. Um, full frontal assault. Yeah. Not only will it be a full frontal assault on the Vita, but also on your PS3 and it's going to be one of these games that utilizes this brand new thing to be announced, which is the PlayStation cross by, which is awesome. Cross by. Basically you purchase a game on the PS3, you get the Vita version for free. Fuck. Yeah. That's the way you do it. I like, this is a great trend. That sound shape started. Exactly. Um, another game that's got feature that I hope though, because this was a good point that came up when Bobby was talking about this earlier on his show, I want it to not just be digital. That's my concern is that that would only be the deal if you get it digitally. It's going to be digital. I thought, Oh, but I'm running out of room on the PS3 and then I'm going to buy a bigger hardware memory card, that's, that's the trick is that those stinking Vita memory cards are so expensive. They're not that expensive, but did they come down to price finally when they released the, the prices of those aren't that expensive. I thought it was, no, um, uh, another game that's going to support that as well is going to be PlayStation all stars. JV Mon reminds us in chat play pinball arcade on the Vita. Does that too? I have it on my phone. On my phone. I don't need a Vita. Um, also another, um, game that's going to support that little big planet. The DLC is also cross platform. So if you buy, you know, any DLC you have now for a little big planet one and two, we'll work with a little big planet Vita and little big planet carding. So that's kind of cool. That's awesome. Yeah. A little big planet carding I hope is one of those games too. I think it is one of the cross buying games, so that's pretty sweet. And then, um, PlayStation plus coming to the Vita as well and they're upping the cloud storage to one gigabyte. So, um, that's pretty sweet. Also announced that, um, I guess Europe is going to be getting Red Dead Redemption, um, free in September. So that's pretty sweet. Um, and then also PlayStation mobile. They talked a little bit about that and talked about some of the launch games and there was a big old trailer on there. And one of the things I saw, I remember was Lemmings and I'm like, Holy shit, Lemmings. But uh, that's going to be one of the games. Uh, also they mentioned that, uh, PlayStation mobile will be compatible with, uh, Sony Xperia phones, uh, also Vitas. And then they revealed that, uh, the ACES and Wiki pad tablets are going to be getting, um, PlayStation mobile as well. And they're going to be adding stuff or different devices to that as well. So that's pretty cool. That's everything. That's a lot of news coming out of Gamescom, but that makes sense because Sony has a pretty big presence in Europe. They've always done pretty well there ever since the original PlayStation. So it's kind of exciting. And then I'm assuming there'll be even more Tokyo game show. Right? Uh, probably that's pretty cool. I'm really excited about the whole Vita PlayStation three crossover. I'm glad that I'm like, I'm glad that I'll be able to do something with my Vita cause I haven't really, I'm telling you sound shapes, sound shapes is a great, they should be pushing it more. It's, it's a great holdover game until they get some more stuff. I wonder if that final fantasy 10 remake is going to be, um, buy one, get both because they were pimping it for both systems. Well it's right now. It's been first party that's been doing that. Oh yeah. Yeah. Technically it's pretty cool. I mean that might get me the, by the PS three version of black ops two, maybe if it was like that. Although, like I said, black ops class of declassified, the fact that it's being done by the guys that the resistance brings guys and the trailer just didn't look that great. I was just, uh, made me sad. All right. Well in case you haven't heard the 3ds XL did release today, the suggested retail price $199.99. Although there are some deals out there, like I know Fry's electronics was selling it today for $179.99. Uh, so, you know, look around on the internet and all that stuff to see where you can get the best deal. Sadly, we don't get the Pikachu version here, uh, but we do get the red version. I think there's a red and a blue one that came out here. And of course new super Mario brothers two also released today as I already talked about, uh, it's kind of the kickoff game for that console. So there you go with the 3ds XL. Just a reminder. It is out. Get the red one, put a Charmander sticker on it. My big like concern about getting one of these right now is that again, I think I mentioned this last week, they'll just turn around and release like a really beautiful color. Like that purple, that purple 3ds is so gorgeous. Like I wish that had been the launch color that they would have never had to do another color. That'd be great. So I'm, I'm curious about the XL. I've heard it's a good system, but at the same time, like I, do I want to pay 200 bucks for a new one when I already have one? I know. I don't think I can justify that really. So we'll see. But it's out. Dark Sakura. Well, we do have some news on the corporate front. I'll say, I'll, I'll put it in those words. Who remembers on live? I remember their big booth at E3 and nobody, like nobody thought on live was going to work. And then they showed up at E3 and they were like, this works. And everybody's like, holy shit, it does work. Well, um, right now they're actually, uh, there was something going around about a sort of bankruptcy going on. And honestly, this article is really hard to read because all the texts has crossed over and the HTML is screwed up. Well there was so much and there was so much back and forth on this this week. Like nobody really has a clear understanding what's going on. Totally. The coding on this is awful. Just saying. So anyway, basically they were saying that there was an acquisition of their assets by a company as a sale. Instead it has to do with like, um, bankruptcy protection. They have, I believe, been acquired, but in, in kind of a different deal. Well, you know what's different about it. They won't say who. Yeah. That's the big thing. It's not weird. It sounded to me that they created their, like their own company, like they created another company. I call this OnLive2. Off Dead. Off Dead. Let her finish. Let her finish. Cause I want to get into this a little bit. Well, here's what the, what the official quote is. It's like, we can now confirm the assets of OnLive Incorporated have been acquired into a newly formed company and is backed by substantial funding and will continue to operate the online game and desktop service, blah, blah, blah, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. They are releasing the OnLive employees, um, and I think have put out a call to rehire them with the new company, which I mean basically how this worked with the company that I worked for before when we were sold is that, yeah, we were released from the previous corporation, but we were hired quote by the new company as, and we know with all of our tenure and everything intact. So I think that what it's looking like is either they have fully released them or they are sending the note out there that, yeah, we want you here. We want to keep you around, you know, just maybe trying to get them to reapply through different hiring channels or something. I mean, maybe you want to bring them all and see, you know, if they're loyal to the product. I don't know. The whole thing is a little weird. You know, it was very, like, this is super bizarre. You should have seen this play out. You should have seen this playing out on Twitter because like, you know, you know, at first it was OnLive has completely shut down. They're bankrupt. They're gone. You know, and the OnLive Twitter, they've yet to really say anything officially. And it was at the point where, like, people were reporting, yeah, we drove down to the OnLive offices and we see people are walking out of here with boxes and all this stuff. So clearly the company's not going to hire some people back. And I think everything's just in this big state of flux right now. You know, and it's never good news when people lose their jobs in the gaming industry, and this is always tough to talk about. But I do have to ask the hard question, OnLive kind of, I mean, as a service, it was bringing a lot of great things to the table, but the one thing that was really missing was like games. Like, a lot of the games that it launched with when launching is your first impression were years old and kind of old news. And sure, they tried to add to that. And they did some cool things with the service, like the replays and some of that other stuff they were doing. And the desk, I'm sorry, the TV top systems and all that they were doing, they had some great ideas. But it's like, they just didn't have the games to back it up, and they didn't have the deals to back it up like Steam did. The coolest thing they had going for it were the hour-long demos that you didn't really have to download anything. You just did it through the cloud. But it wasn't, like, they weren't really getting exclusives or, you know, it was tricky. It was tricky. And I can see where the company's hurting when they're, you know, I think the report had come out that only several thousand people out of the millions that had signed up were only ever on the service at any one time. Yeah. Sixteen hundred and they had eight thousand servers. So that was a lot of unused servers that had to be maintained. So I'm just really, I mean, they clearly, someone believes in the product. I just want to look at Sony bought their biggest competitor, Gaikai, which was a very similar sort of thing. But Gaikai was kind of doing, they had the whole stuff in the browsers and they were getting some deals where the demos were streamed to them like they were kind of trying to push the envelope a little more. And, you know, now Sony acquired them. Yeah. Here's the other thing that kind of sucks, too, is basically some of the people were offered, you know, consulting arrangements also. They said that, you know, they had they asked some of the employees to help smooth the transition to the new startup. And those people were offered stock options in the new company. However, that's those stock are basically worthless unless the company at some point becomes profitable and, you know, basically it's sold or goes public. So you get an IOU, maybe we'll fulfill that money if if we are successful. Well, best of luck to the folks that find themselves displaced this week with a whole on live stuff. I hope they're able to land work quickly somewhere else, as we usually feel in these types of situations. So. All right. Anyhow, if that's it. Yeah. Let's move on. So speaking of other cloud services, GameStop, they have a cloud streaming service that's going to be coming to PCs, tablets and Internet TVs. Of course, you know, you may remember that they acquired Spawn Labs and Impulse last year. And basically it said based on consumer feedback, our success in selling mobile devices and imminent launch of new consoles, we have decided to move our technology to PC based model. And, you know, they're going to be only offering it to those devices not going to be coming to any sort of game consoles in the future, probably because I would be willing to bet that those other companies have their own streaming ideas in place. Like we know Sony clearly Sony does. So maybe Microsoft's kind of going that similar route. So it's not that yes, we're not going to put our stuff on those consoles. More like those console developers don't want us to put our stuff on their consoles. So, you know, one of the first rumors I read was that Microsoft bought on live, which would seem like, no, it's just that's not what happened. You know, because sometimes Microsoft buys companies. But I think in this case, they'll try to just reinvent it and make it better and put their own name on it. You know what I mean? Yeah. I don't think if it was like bought by Microsoft, they'd be more, you know, more open about it. Fair about it. Yeah. We're going to lay everybody off. But that was one of the first early. You know, you know how Twitter goes, people. Everybody's everybody's a skeptic and everybody's an analyst. So yeah. So yeah, they're saying, you know, I guess GameStop had proposed a scenario before where they were saying that users would need to own a retail copy of a particular game they wish to stream from cloud. Although now that's not necessarily going to be the case, because if it's not going to tie into consoles, then what are they going to own? So I don't know. It's an interesting idea. And I know how they're selling their own tablets and stuff, but it seems like it's such a crowded market space out there. I mean, I know you can trade in games for like these tablets and phones and stuff, but why would I want to buy? Why would I want to stream games from them? That just doesn't. I don't know. It just doesn't seem appealing to me at all. I like the idea of being able to like stream demos and things like that without having to download like, like that whole secret world. I talked about that a couple of weeks ago, this MMO that I tried out the secret world. I had to download a 15 gig thing to try that just to figure out that, you know what, I don't really have time for this right now. It would have been a lot nicer if I could have just streamed it through something like this and to make my opinion. And there are other MMOs that allow you to do this. I'm sorry to be so MMO centric, but you know, it's kind of what comes to mind is it's a great, that's a great use for the streaming technology is, is the demos, of course. Are you getting your full graphical potential of the game that way? I don't know, but yeah, that's another thing. And then also, you know, with some of these devices, um, you know, not everybody's upgraded their wireless network, so you may be running wireless G and that's going to throttle you a little bit and, um, or you know, you have to be connected to the wifi for the stuff to work. Uh, for most part, I just, I, my tablet has a weird tendency to cut in and out of the wifi too. Like I'll be connected to wifi and then like once every 15 minutes, it just drops for 15 seconds. And that'll kill your game. If I'm trying to stream gamings off that don't like dealing with GameStop is kind of where it's at there. Yeah, that's a good point. They will find a way to take the shrink wrap off those digital downloads before I purchase them. I, I just know it's going to happen, but all right, well, this is a game that, uh, maybe some of you will be streaming through a console later unconfirmed, but I don't know. It's a big game. Uh, Tekken tag tournament two, uh, you excited about this? There's some more information that came out about this from game com, uh, games com, excuse me, Tekken tag tournament two, it will support 3d so you can have, you know, 3d fighting and kicking and all that 3d can be switched on or off. The depth can be adjusted to whatever it is that you like on there. There's also something called Tekken tunes where you can make your own custom soundtrack by importing your own CDs or MP3s or whatever. There's also fight lab, which is a way that beginners can learn the play mechanics. There's a robot fighter named combat and you will practice your techniques on that in order to get through the fight lab. I also noticed there's like a design, a character mode, like they have a little kitty girl here that's been made in the fighter mode, which seems to be a big thing in the Namco games lately. I like that's what soul caliber is all about. Now I want the ability to make a Tekken three gin. Um, yeah, so there you go. Some of the new stuff coming in Tekken tag tournament two, I'm sure you're going to be picking this up right there. Well, if I have money now, I'm the one who's not working at this table. Some moves, just, you know, some moves in this whole create a mode thing. They have to be unlocked in the game. So like if you want to, uh, get an, uh, if you want to get the Phoenix smash from Paul, you have to get an S rank in order to get that. So interesting or cheap or cheap. So Tekken tag tournament two coming soon, dark soccer. Well in other news, you know what? I kind of want to play the sad trombone for this Rob, because this is how I feel looking this over. Oh, we can arrange that, but well, you know, and you're, you're, you're going to know why I went at the moment. I say the game, final fantasy 14, well, um, basically they're, uh, they have this thing called a realm reborn, which is, uh, the relaunch of final fantasy 14. Um, and, uh, there's an interview with, um, Naoki Yoshida, um, who is saying that losing your fans trust is an easy thing to do and regaining it is very hard. They, um, really think that they're going to be able to, uh, regain the fans trust by rebuilding final fantasy 14. And they want that to be where they launch it from, say, Hey, this is great. What's 15 and 16 going to be like, well, first of all, I'm like, stop numbering them. They won't be online MMOs. Let's hope. Um, he's quoted as saying over a long time, we'll try to regain their trust, but it is something we as a company must put effort into long term, but they, they're admitting that they're probably not going to get it back with just the one game. So right now, um, a realm reborn is in, uh, alpha it's a beta testing is going to be going on later in the year and the PlayStation three group will be invited to join in on the beta. So, um, another thing that he pointed out is that in the entire history of the final fantasy, uh, series, there has not been one that failed, which is why they're not giving up on 14. You know, there's a lot of people that respond to that by saying, what about 13, but 13 wasn't, why would they wouldn't have made 13 two if 13 was a failure. Some people just straight up didn't like 13, which, you know, I can get the reasons why people weren't into 13. I liked it an awful lot. If you didn't like it, it doesn't mean something failed. Exactly. Very good point. Very good point, internet. It just means that you don't like it. Other people do shut up, get over it, but don't take it. This is okay. I have to read a minute. It pisses me off when I say I don't like something and someone else immediately says, Oh, well I do, you're wrong or will I do as if I'm wrong or vice versa. One person liking something or disliking something that you do not is not a personal reflection on you. Oh, person of very small willpower and self-worth, you know, end of rant. But we can all agree final fantasy 14 was bad, right? We can, we can all agree on that. I didn't play it. I actually can't tell you if it was bad or not. It probably was. I haven't played it, but from what I heard, I'm just trying to make a joke. Obviously somebody's paying for it out there. They wouldn't have any servers running. I mean, I'm sure there's people that probably like it. There are people who are like, I don't have anything else better to do. I feel like our chat room at live.vognetwork.com has suddenly become a support group. Break Man says some of us like Final Fantasy 13. JV Mon says, I like 13. Stan says, Hey, I liked 13. I didn't like 12. I liked what I played of it. I just got a little bored. Dungeon Buster says 13 was still commercially successful. Kitsune says, I liked Final Fantasy 13 too. Didn't like dash two as much just because of that ending. But I mean, it's, it's the whole thing where it's like, I really don't know why people do this. I mean, it's probably a little shortsighted of me to say it's because someone has low self esteem or thinks that everything that people are talking about is about them. Maybe a little ego instead, who knows? But just because someone doesn't like something that you do, don't take it as a personal offense the other way around. It has no reflection on you as a person. Uh, JV Mon in chat says, I dislike Final Fantasy seven, but respect other people's opinions who differ from my own. A model citizen. Yes. Uh, RDG Singe says, I like Duke Nukem forever. You were entitled to like it. You were entitled to like it. I personally think that it was, um, what's a good description? A festering pile of shit, but, um, I love 10 and 10 too. I'm sorry. Breakman says, stop talking about my low self esteem. How dare you? Wait, what are we talking about? It's just, I don't know what it is. It's a big internet thing, definitely, but it's also a human thing for people to want everyone to like the same things that they do or hate the same things that they do and poopoo anybody else who doesn't think the way I do, dammit politics, which is a little bit more important, but it's video games are the most important thing. What are you talking about? But it's at the same time as like, okay, fun, fun of fantasy 14. They're looking at it as a failure fiscally. It's probably a failure for them. It's probably pulling in just enough money to keep a couple of servers up. It is. It is a little bit unprecedented when it, no matter what your personal opinion is on 14, if you think we're too hard on it or what it is, it is unprecedented for a game company to come out and apologize for a game. Yes. And they are taking steps to fix it. They clearly believe that there's something with that product that's worth salvaging. And for all the people out there, like what brought me to this point, regardless in that say 13 was a failure fiscally, financially, I'm sorry, that's what I mean. Was it a failure? No, it made them buckets of money. Game guru in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, for example, I don't like F zero, but I respect that it is a great game. Just not a racing game. I like, well, you are entitled to your wrong opinion. Shut up. Now go sit in the corner. Well, here's me. I don't like strategy games. Couldn't sit through Warcraft to play it. Love World of Warcraft. It's just the third time, fourth, fourth, fourth because I played with each expansion until I liked it. Um, but I mean, I love the universe, hate the first series of games, you know, it's just has to personal preference. I notoriously can't stand Final Fantasy eight and it's not the story that bothers me. It's fucking boring. It's that fucking fighting system ruined. I know. Well, I love the story so much by the time I got to the third disc, bore for reals, but the whole point is, is that take personal opinion out of the equation and look at it for what it is. How much money did it make? How big of a player base does it have? That determines in the terms. That's what the stockholders are looking at. Exactly. That determines right there if something is a failure as a product or not. Now for everyone who bought Final Fantasy 13 and hate it, they still got the money. They, they like it. Sorry. They still got your money at one and the story, but when you've got an ongoing product that people are going to play, play, pay a subscription for, that's a different story and for that you have to deliver month after month. All right, well let's travel around the world and check out what possibly controversial new releases are coming out this week. I don't really know if there's anything controversial, but we'll see. Let's start in the U S Loki is going to be short. There's fall of Cybertron, PS3 and 360. That's it. Dang. Well, we did just have a system launch today and a big Nintendo game, so it's not technically new system. It's about as new as like, say, you know, new Super Mario brothers two. There's some big PC games in a couple of weeks too. So that's, that's, that's that. All right. Uh, let's go to Japan. Uh, Japan's looking a little bit empty this week as well on the Xbox 360 there is the Witcher two assassins of Kings enhanced edition. I don't know what's enhanced about that, but that's on the 360 this week. That's the only thing on the, um, 360 in Japan. Otherwise on the PlayStation three, no more heroes. Red zone edition gets the best treatments. That means a price reduction. Also I don't know what this is. It's a, a hybrid disc. I think this is a game and an anime. It's Rene no Lagrange, Kamogawa days, and it's the game and the anime. Yeah. Cool. And that's kind of something we see on the PlayStation three happened a little bit is that you have the game slash movie or whatever it was a PlayStation network game in the movie. Yeah. So, uh, seeing that a little bit more and more, the VITA has got a little bit going on this week in Japan. We have next revolution. There's a couple of different versions. There's talk and she can, and then Joe who a security specialist, she can, and then another game coming out on the VITA as well called Tokushu Hodobu comes out. That is all on the 23rd of August. Now, I will say this next week, cause a lot of people are going to be excited about this on the VITA. Maybe dark soccer, even I don't have a VITA. Maybe you'll have to go on for Hatsune Miku project diva F. You're not a project diva fan. I thought you were. I am, but I don't have a VITA. So what does it matter? Well, you can get in Japan on the 30th, you can get a VITA Hatsune Miku limited edition. Well, let the people who actually have jobs and money get one for me. You should sell Etsy's to fund your VITA. What the fuck would I make on Etsy? Anger. I'm selling my rage. You get an MP3 of me going fuck. You can record people's voicemail messages. Yeah, you could set up, you could set up their voicemail. Hi, this is dark soccer. away beep hi this is dark soccer from orange lounge radio chances are I don't like you or your friend but leave a message anyway bye that reminds me I got a recorder I got a recorded voicemail message for my google I my google voice number that apparently Omaha steaks likes calling daily to you know market me I forgot that I'd set it up by steaks from them once or something yes I had a gift card that I won so I like I was like okay I got to make it I got to make a number that they can call and I got to make an email address that they can email to so I gave them the email address I don't use and then I gave them that phone number so now now I need to like you know figure out how to forward that to I don't know hi Loki's voicemail please leave a message unless you're Omaha steaks then fuck off I like that yeah I'm answering sorry I'll record it for you unless you're trying to sell shit then get lost unless you're gonna send me free steak which case you send me free steak when if it's not free I don't fucking care on the Nintendo 3ds boku wa koku kansai khan Airport hero 3d Honolulu I have no idea what Airport hero is but I imagine in my head it's a lot like the what's that pocket planes on on the iOS system or on the iOS yeah something like that iPhone and all that all right that's it for Japanese release dates how about the UK Dark Saga a few things a few we have on the 21st Darksiders 2 and Jojo's Bizarre Adventure HD kind of series has been out in Japan for like what ever since like the mid 80s and we're just now getting stuff order I'm just whatever 22nd Joe jars of bizarre Jojo's Bizarre Adventure HD on the ps3 and on the 24th Dark Souls for PC endless space for PC and transformers follow Cybertron which is all my friend has ever talked about and I don't care anymore all right just a couple new stories away from the classic game of the week and dark soccer picked an obscure one tonight I think I think super obscure plays a little bit here it's a good game I just need another copy of it sometimes it's about finding the hidden gems there you go all right first though a couple more stories for you guys Loki all right so there was some announcements regarding origin it's coming to Mac because you know they have games on the Mac so of course it would so of course Peter Moore announced that you know during gamescom it's going to be coming to a few different platforms including smart TVs the Mac Android and Facebook and they're also going to be you know adding some new features including free-to-play gaming which is I think where the Facebook and Android comes into play and achievements hoorah hooray now you can play broken games of Mass Effect 3 on the Mac I guess it doesn't necessarily mean the games are coming out on those systems but origin will be there you know origin cannot I this this boggles my mind if Alan and I want to play our two friends at the same house in the Bay Area we can't do it origin can't handle two people in one place versus two in another place we can do two on one or them two against what we can't do two on two it is not possible in origin setup really really I bet steam can handle that it probably to be fair we haven't tried but I don't see why it wouldn't work I've played some I I've never really had a game that failed miserably playing it through steam like I had a great sieve five match not that long ago borderlands is through game spy so that's a little different I don't I wouldn't measure that so whatever all right well speaking of underappreciated classics the neo geo remember the neo geo yeah I've looked at one the other day you've got one in your house right to actually those others are expensive have a neo geo and a neo see you know how Dan got his neo geo huh he traded a Sega CD for it wow well you might have to make room on the shelf for this it's the neo geo X gold that's right it's a new system is in now there were rumors about this before that this is coming but it is confirmed the neo geo X gold is a thing it's a $200 thing hey neo geos were never known for being cheap right now the cool thing is though even for being a $200 system it does come with a bunch of pre-installed games these games used to be like $200 apiece if you remember such classics like art of fighting to magician Lord metal slug baseball stars to fatal fury and fatal fury special king of fighters 95 samurai showdown 2 king of the monsters all this is built in so it's pretty those games already there's a lot of I mean and I'm only reading part of the list so there's a good looks like about 20 games or so that are installed I noticed though I don't see bust a move on this list I don't see or you know puzzle these everyone to call these are all SNK games that was tied oh good point good point well anyhow there is also this I guess here's the weird thing it is a handheld so it's like it's a handheld system but it's also I guess you can plug it into a docking station and then it's a TV thing too that's kind of cool I got to say yeah it's a docking station that's a video out that's pretty cool that my dingoo does the same thing and was a whole hell lot cheaper and yeah I I think it's kind of cool but I don't $200 is a steep price to pay for nostalgia especially you can purchase like one of those like 48 and 160 and one neo geo used by the games on your geo arcade carts and get super gun for way fucking cheaper that I have a super gun it's like an all-in-one card thing that literally plugs into neo geo controllers it's pinned out for that and I have a 16 one cart so nope not gonna buy yeah I don't know I this thing would have to be really something special in order to get me to buy I will say though they the the little joystick they have with it is like a mock replica those you know those things are rock-solid those controllers of the four buttons so it's it's a nice controller I will say that your love that I love them honestly made playing all these games because it's the arcade experience yeah I'll give it that that's pretty cool to register participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio on vog network comm use the passphrase milkshake all right let's take it let's take a trip back down memory lane to a time when the neo geo was you know more relevant although I do I don't you did not pick a neo geo game tonight did you I did not oh well that's okay we're gonna go down the archives of classic gaming and dark soccer is going to jump into the vault and find a game that she thinks hey even though you might not be able to find it you kids should play this game right now dark soccer oh what is the classic game of the week troubleshooter anyone remember this game no it came out on the Sega Genesis it has awesome music play a little bit you assassination anyway in Japan it was known as battle mania and it's a scrolling shooter by Victor hi that came out in 1992 and the only reason I really I had I can say I played this game is I had a friend who had a copy so just we'll leave that there because I didn't have a genesis when I was in high school and the game is a real basically just makes fun of itself the whole time you play as a girl named Madison who is a combat operative who has to rescue a prince that has been taken hostage and she goes around with her partner crystal now basically you play as Madison and Chris was kind of attached to her but it's really way I can describe their positioning and crystal always points backwards but you can flip her to point in the front and she's invulnerable to enemy fire the only one who has the hitbox is Madison here playing as and crystal is only if affected if Madison dies so basically you have a special weapon that helps you during combat and like I said you can flip back and forth we can flip your partner back and forth that you are always facing to the right and you've got different power-ups and it's funny when when you get a power-up she goes thank you like that and they make a little noises when they get hurt and everything a little bubble comes up this is ouch it's so cute but it didn't really have like a life system you stocked at hit points by getting life up icons and now it often had a sequel in Japan called battle mania a diagonal now we're going to move forward into what makes this game special and I'm talking more about battle mania is that it's kind of slow-paced it has this sort of like I said the weird play you know playing style in it but basically Owen in Japan they were called mania and Maria sorry they basically go down and shoot weird machines and it had some really fun stuff thrown in like they had an issue in the game now this was because the group they were working with which which was a studio Uchuu Tetsujin which is also called studio space iron man did not like that Victor Kai worked with Super Famicom so they had an interesting little easter egg through into the game where if you press start right and see on the second controller the two heroines in the game will shoot past the Sega logo and you will see Madison jumping up and down on the Super Famicom just bounce bounce bounce bounce when the U.S. does what Nintendo yeah it's not in the English version so uh so basically as things went along this was you know going into the sequel the battle mania die angel it had mushrooms come out that were part of the power-ups and it had a fleet of well guys it looked like Cape Mario that you had to shoot down there was also just a bunch of stuff that was going on with this it was and there's a an official picture that came out where it shows the girls playing volleyball with a super with a Super Famicom and a hammer and then in the game say gaga you remember that one right we have to basically you're trying to save Sega from financial ruin well they get helped in the end of the game by a bunch of characters from their games and outcome the two ladies from battle mania so definitely the game itself is definitely a big poop on Nintendo but also it's just really fun I mean it's a fun little shooter so this is a game that I would love to have a copy of either the u.s. one of the Japanese one so I would just be giddy if I had this game unfortunately I haven't seen it since I was in high school all right there it is your classic game of the week troubleshooter that's going to do it for part a of orange lounge radio but don't go anywhere guys we're going to take a break and then we come back with more of orange launch radio your twitter questions at twitter.com slash olr the foogle question of the week some stuff going on with valve some stuff on the Wii U and your emails at mailbag at orange lounge at radio.com all after a quick break right Jamie huh all right something special for you guys tonight a rare music break for both the live and the podcast listeners this is a track from the Darksiders to soundtrack scored by Jesper Kidd big thanks to something else music works www.sum thing com or on twitter at sum thing digital for giving us the opportunity to play it for all our listeners this week if you dig it check out the

great job in the Darksiders to stuff there's a base theme in this that runs in this one that runs into other pieces so there you go so alright we're going to get back into the show with some rapid-fire news some quick news stories here and we'll start it off with Loki alright so the Vita is getting some new firmware soon version 1.8 and this is kind of cool because one of the complaints about the Vita before were with the visually impaired having trouble accessing stuff on the Vita because there was no button controls on the home screen well that's going to change now that there will be button controls on the home screen ability use the directional pad and stuff to navigate those screens and no longer we have to use just the touchpad and then also they're going to add I guess some different options for video including fast rewind fast forward and variable speeds also you can import playlists from PlayStation 3 or iTunes for playing music and the web browser now supports rear touch for scrolling and zooming also I guess there's going to be a new cross controller icon in the remote play for the cross controller supporting games and then other tweaks I'm sure so that's pretty cool and then black ops 2 some more details came out during gamescom which actually makes me pretty excited about first things first they're going to be adding some new customization options as opposed to the way they've kind of done things for the last god I don't even know how many games as far as custom classes go you basically get you know primary weapon secondary weapon you know your three perks and you know a lethal grenade and support grenade and stuff like that killstreaks now it's going to basically be you get ten points you get to spend those ten points however you want so if you want to go in and say fuck it I want to run into with just a knife you can do that you can have like five perks or hey I want to have you know a ton of ammo and you know no perks or I want to have this and that you can change it however you want that's kind of cool so that's something that they're adding in there also league play is going to be added in as well as the option to do live streams of your gameplay so you can have live streams and you can also do shoutcasts of like commentary so you can have commentary going over the whole thing as well that's built into the goddamn game that's interesting yes some people harnessing the types of things we see on like you stream and twitch TV and all that interesting yes so that's pretty cool and then there's also a rumor that black ops twos heading to the Wii U according to a QA testers resume who was on LinkedIn I'm just going to make it easy for you it's not a fucking rumor it's coming on the wheel I mean I've been seeing it for weeks now so it is coming on the wheel I know because I've seen the UPC and other things but yes it duh I mean come on it's gonna be a simple port of the other games and you know Treyarch supports the Wii so why not come out well speaking of the Wii U spot pass is apparently going to be a feature of the Wii U this again really strikes me as a type of duh but it is going around the internet this week that I guess it's kind of the new version of Wii Connect 24 which you know remember that was a thing that your Wii was always on but it's not really it's not used as well as it could be spot pass a little better on the DS so hopefully they're gonna implement that more and more through the Nintendo platforms this is all coming from a photo of a Wii U development kit that the Wii U will have the spot pass feature I mean come on of course and it if they're smart they'll do a lot of the stuff between the 3ds and the Wii U that was happening between the DS and the Wii with the demos and so of course they're gonna have spot pass I mean it is a it is a DS right now on the TV screen essentially alright well other Nintendo news Team Ninja I remember they made Metroid other M which you know was kind of met with mixed mixed reaction not everybody was into it I thought it was pretty I thought it was pretty good but you know not nothing is yet to top Super Metroid for me you know nothing's even really come close honestly what about a fusion um close but still doesn't top it the closest thing I would say would be the Metroid zero zero mission was probably the close that's what I'm thinking of how's on the Game Boy Advance you were thinking of the other Game Boy Advance one was Metroid fusion ah anyway team ninjas yosuke hayashi says that they are still close to Nintendo and the designer Yoshio Sakamoto apparently they are both director they were both directors of Metroid other M on the Wii and according to Hayashi team ninja wants to work with Nintendo on another Metroid title here's a quote unfortunately Metroid is kind of out of our meaning team ninjas league as it's Nintendo's game but we're still in close touch with so co-creator Sakamoto-san so we want to do something with him moving forward definitely it really depends on what he wants to do with the game first so you know kind of like a peace offering there I mean but again at the end of the day if Metroid other M didn't sell which I don't believe it did sell up to expectations I don't know what the future is going to hold for Metroid but I can't they totally screwed up with Samus in that game I I wouldn't believe though that they would just let Metroid go away but then again stranger things have happened I hope not I hope not the full track list for just dance for coming out on October 9th on the Wii connect and PlayStation move the full track listing is out I will cut I will touch on some of the highlights mm-hmm last ketchup with the ketchup song remember that Jeff from back in the day oh my god well that's current Justin Bieber featuring Nicki Minaj beauty and a beat I didn't even know that that was a thing and now that I know it is a thing it's a thing I'd like to know she had beauty I mean she's the beat we beat you just beat Justin Bieber I guess is beauty a beautiful lesbian all right yeah Carly Ray Jepsen with call me maybe grandpa you out there listening let's see I love this army of lovers with crucified I like that song YouTube that video immediately it is fucking amazing and I cannot stress how great it is over a radio show but you don't understand how awesome it is that that song is in this game until you YouTube the video seriously do it after olr army of lovers crucified it's in just dance for they definitely have a an eclectic mix they really do they really Rihanna with disturb ya something new let's see they might be Giants Istanbul that's funny I wasn't DDR once I think it's ultra mix three Elvis Presley with jailhouse rock then Ricky Martin with Livin la vida loco of course a little vita loca Selena Gomez in the scene with love you like a lot love song moves like Jagger you know because every fucking game has that moves like Jagger Alexander Stan mr. Saxo beat remember that song I really I like Marina and the diamonds oh no it's gonna be in there that's a very like British I think there's a good it's not just eclectic but it's eclectic like multi-regional like you get a lot of um do we get any jpop do we do we do we do we not that eclectic unfortunately see you do get the b-52s with rock lobster pink with so what Halloween thrills with the time warp which I do believe would be a cover of the rocky horror picture show song which is obviously all kinds of amazing to unlimited with tribal dance as long as we're borrowing from DTR games right the Rihanna with umbrella Ella Ella one direction with what makes you beautiful because you know hey Will Smith with Wild Wild West wow that that must have been a cheap license and here's my favorite skill rex with rock and roll will take you to the mountain so now you get your dubstep song never heard that song and I never plan on it no do not poison my brain I am kind of curious I do with shitty dubstep I want to hear it something I'll dub says shitty yes it is that's I will say this we were at brunch today and this this dubstep song is obviously dubstep song was playing on the speaker was like I was like what in the fuck is this and Allen's all oh it's the hot new single by car alarm oh that's a joke it's a car alarm oh I wouldn't be surprised if there was a group called that just saying all right prize you don't have a car alarm that's dubstep because I know I was like can I put that in my car to scare away the okay here we go an olr exclusive everybody dark sakura gets introduced to dubstep here we go no take your fingers out of your ear this is for suck for science dark sakura for science here we go dark sock I can't let too much of this play I can let a little bit of it play for the purposes of commentary but dark sakura thoughts on rock and roll will take you to the mountain I'm going to quote Becky that sort of cruelty will not be tolerated kind of like that song actually oh no doesn't use that same little oh my god riff in another song I'm sure he does I would rather listen to Sarah Brightman and you know how I feel about I love Sarah Brightman though like no she knows how to bring the I can't never mind I shouldn't say the word but she knows how to bring it now the only thing that Sarah Brightman's ever done that I've liked was repo yeah everything else just real soprano oh I like her cover of Eden I'll admit it I like it was a great song anyway how my virgin ears let's see some comments from our chat room remember we do have a live chat room they got subjected to that to Stan says that's seriously dubstep technus says that's not dubstep let's see Stan says that sounds like gay club music five years ago black wolf says the dubstep song we have in rotation is okay the Skyrim to the knee SSJ 100 Matt says that's pretty good that's how she was sitting vampire actually said it always reminds me of downtown Julie Brown whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa miss her speaking of dubstep have you seen the new trailer for Borderlands 2 it's fucking fantastic oh is it all dubstep if no it's not all this of the day that reminded me of it because you know they had the first trailer they were making fun of the dubstep trailers and then you know of course they have you know claptrap doing dubstep stuff but no the new trailer is fucking awesome it's got near the villain basically at the ends like come and get me it's like yeah I want to fucking kill that guy and doesn't have that same music that wah wah wah no I don't have that but got some sort of electronic isn't there all right I want to I got to see it dark soccer do you know this song wait no oh this is a live version I don't want this I want the original video here because I want to exciting exciting radio I don't care yeah exciting for me do they not have it maybe this is it that looks like I want to know if you like this why she spasming we're doing like some stupid interpretive dance I just don't that is wise and of course she's being all like Jesus II with her hands up I really don't care for her voice that much I mean I thought that she was good in repo that's about it only cuz she rips her eyes out yeah tonight is like the discover new music on olr night she rips her eyes out that'd be a good like animated gif for like something like bad YouTube videos or something that is I'm surprised I haven't seen that gif on oh no they I'd rather be not to like spoil repo the genetic opera that's a great movie well it's freaking my man isn't it Anthony Stewart head yes he can be my he can be my uncle because remember I have my special family with Betty White is my grandmother George decay is my gay daddy I haven't decided who my other gay daddy is all right let's move on with more rapid-fire news dark Sakura well um we've got a fan project that's called Megaman day in the limelight to sorry there's apparently a sequel it's done by the people that did mushroom kingdom fusion it's a rearranged version of Megaman 3 but instead of playing what tiger class as searching for car alarm dubstep I found this okay so anyway you play through on the stages of Megaman 3 but you play as the robot masters for Megaman 2 so it looks like it's pretty fun and I think I'm going to be grabbing this no thank you let's not fuck Rob the hell you did in my poor brain and then chatters it was tiger claw it's all tiger claws fall team fortress 2 we have a new co-op mode on August 15th called man nana nana nana with extra n versus machine so it's six players against doppelgangers so you have to fight the robot versions of them and you get incredible loot it's not as cool as fog loot no and then last but never least steam the big picture mode is going to launch in beta in September so you can basically play steam on your TV but not a valve console oh the end the end all right let's go to the frugal question of the week but Facebook and Google Plus together and you get frugal we ask a question every week of our would be their bastard love child we go to our fan communities every week to ask a question and share some of the answers with you guys here on the show there was a lot of answers tonight I can't read them all but it's a fun question frugal question of the week I'm not just saying that because I wrote it new Super Mario Brothers 2 came out today and it features new Mario powers that allow you to turn lots of things into gold coins this has us thinking about power-ups what is your favorite power-up item from a video game please provide your user oh I don't have to read that part all right what is your favorite power-up item from a video game let's start on Google Plus shall we with monster be my favorite power-up is adrenaline pills from unreal tournament 2003 2004 would you read your post with would you read this post with your count chocula voice sure my favorite power-up is adrenaline pills from unreal tournament 2003 more like the count close enough one one they're all the same 2003 2004 ah flaco jones says the spread gun power-up from Contra good pick redder tainment says as I remember there's an accessory in Borderlands that allows you to make a sniper rifle that sets enemies on fire seeing people flare up and run around from a great distance always put a smile on my face you and dark Sakura have some things in common right let's move over to Facebook there's a lot of answers on Facebook I'm not gonna be able to read all these but I'll read some of them Rob himself says the red shell in Mario Kart unless it's aimed at me let's see Ben R says the mushroom in Mario Kart where you can just jam the item button as much as possible for a certain amount of seconds and keep boosting the golden mushroom Matt J says I always love the grappling hook from Super Metroid and later in Metroid Prime I felt like a total badass swinging back and forth on those hooks the space jump comes in as a close second though mostly because the animation looking cool Nick Nick M says the gravity gun from half-life 2 was amazing that's great dark Tetsuya says got to give it to the purple tracer laser from right into that yes gamer girl says the red heart potions from Legend of Zelda wicked says the p-wing from Super Mario Brothers 3 as much as I love kuriboh shoe and the hammer brothers suit I don't think I've ever cleared world 8 without without at least three p-wings in the inventory infinite flight is a necessity especially during the fast scrolling airship stage ratchet tag simply says falcom punch Benny L says adult magazine from the God hand that replenishes your God hand meter let's see pikaruno says the hammer in Super Smash Brothers the combination of silly music ridiculous damage and sheer oh fuck factor from anyone unlucky enough to be hit by it makes me giggle every time Jim H says monster potion from zombies ate my neighbors you could punch holes and fences fences and hedges and walls and kill lumberjacks with ease Austin W says in the Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask I love the final mask in the game that turns you into fierce DD link I'm still waiting for this character to make an appearance in the smash games that and wolf link dark charger says heavy barrel from heavy barrel arcade in the game you must collect and assemble all the pieces of the heavy barrel weapon and Haseo sumo agar sumo agar wa excuse me says if I were to choose one it would have to be the chainsaw you get from a torture kill on Bayonetta there are some good answers how about you guys in studio favorite power-up in a video game I have a few okay I'd really do like kuriboh shoe I'm wanted to use it through the whole damn game of course I go my kitty came out I'm kitty but my adopted kid the this has been my recent favorite the collector laser rifle because you just shoot things and they melt done make they just melt you have piles of alien goo on the ground this for Mass Effect two and three it's beautiful if you've never used the collector rifle use it and you'll never use anything else there was oh in the issue of Fornax um as far as others that I really really like I like the bells in Proteus that I like the word blaster where I have no idea what it's saying I can only read like some of it but it's like I don't know what you're saying but die I love I love the Proteus power-ups a whole bunch and oh yeah cotton where she gets the willow she goes we know just I just like it because that's all she says so Loki um well there's a few I have some actually from games I haven't played a couple from red faction they had mr. toots which was a unicorn that fired rainbows out of its ass that amazing it was a weapon in the game oh there was that showed up in like videos online too right yeah they did a viral video Freddie Wong I remember you covering that yeah I was a Freddie Wong thing yeah anyways then the ostrich hammer from red faction also and then for stuff that I actually have played fuzzy from you know Super Mario World 2 that wasn't really a power-up but that's actually a good answer I like that memorable and then actually a sort of a power-up from it was actually in a bunch of Capcom games but like one I remember is Captain Commando where you would hop into like the mechs and like you know punch and blow things up and catch things on fire remember how all the old Capcom games had that little symbol that like showed up in every game that was always like an uber power-up like it was in every game I can't remember what was called you remember that little symbol like a little mm-hmm somebody I do also they'll have to second the purple laser and riding because it's always what I use was a purple laser anything else lucky that's it oh there's one more I can add huh actually your your shield thing in our type the added on option that you could shoot either from your butt or from the front that was always a cool thing I'm gonna go super duper old school I think one of the best power-ups ever was the hammer in Donkey Kong because the little song the little animation of the hammer going up and down was really funny to me so I always love the hammer in the original Donkey Kong and then the power brick in Mario Brothers because I love I'm not talking Super Mario Brothers but an old-school Mario Brothers I loved that game I still do it's one of my favorite like everyone that's one of it yeah you just knock everyone on their ass and it was it is cool to the power bricks kind of come back in the later Mario would be awesome hmm is you know how we have Smash Brothers guess Smash Brothers of old retro arcade games like all that would be those characters that would be very cool I slightly old-school but like the first thing that came to my mind honestly the ripple gun from life force yes that was the best one I love that power-up like sometimes I even though it wasn't that great of a gun like I would get it just cuz it's cool I'm team laser over here and exactly the laser was the the more effective power-up at the ripple was just cool and I really think the best power-up like ever were the options in the Gradius games in any of those option yeah those are great power-ups you have too much speed up though and you'd be dead right um you know well another one actually since I mentioned our type is the I don't know if it's called the ripple gun in our type but it's like a dual red and blue that forms this big swirl as it goes across you've got or something yeah some kind of wave gun but that's just thought that one was pretty triggers in our chat room says a street can I don't know if that was the name of it that thing I'm trying to think of where that's a capcom thing that was in the like it was in 1942 and it was in bionic commando and which um one other one I would name power-up that was awesome you know I'm gonna go to Super Metroid right I'm gonna say the very end of the game when you have that laser that just blows through everything like the rainbow laser that just cuts through everything there was just something really epic about that moment when you had that beam as you were fighting mother brain and there's awesome there is one other thing okay I know it's a game I've actually covered for classic game that's star parotia I love shooting things with hue cards can't help it I love this answer in the chat room dungeon buster says Michael Jackson turning into a robot moonwalker that was pretty awesome actually all right I'm so thank you dark tetsuya that's it I yeah see she I yeah see Chi Chi Chi yeah she Chi that's it that's what I'm trying to think of thank you dark tetsuya you get a nickel it's made out of wood enjoy all right a big thanks to all you guys on Facebook and Google Plus to answer the question I'm so sorry I didn't I didn't read all the Facebook answers because there's like a lot there's over 20 so don't also forget though so go and read them I'm commanding you to go read everything that hadoken in Megaman X that was pretty cool yeah even even in general the hadoken kind of changed gaming in a way like I don't know if you'd call that a power-up so much as a power move but think about it reuse fireball in Street Fighter kind of changed gaming in many ways I think it did I don't can I don't can you really did I don't as it in a games annoy me is it but that's all you hear all game all right anyhow that's it for frugal question of the week let's move on with some more news we'll get to the mailbag if use Twitter topic Skype all that good stuff in just a little bit but first Loki man valve is getting into all sorts of crazy shit you know first they're you know they have their game service and then now they're you know putting other software now they're making documentaries yes valve has documentaries that are coming out now and the first one is based on an upcoming defense of the agents or ancients agents that'd be a whole another game defense of the ancients documentary and they're I guess following people are trying to go pro and win a million dollars in a tournament it makes sense things are going this way when that whole indie game the movie did I'm assuming it did fairly well on steam I saw people talking about it and I would imagine they did sort of have a documentary in iPad form with the portal to the final days oh yeah did it wasn't wasn't that like a contracted thing though where yeah because like Jeff Keeley put that all together at least supervised it I'm sure he didn't do it all himself but you know supervised that whole thing where yeah because they did they did the portal but wasn't there one that was the last days of all there was another game that had one was it another valve game actually didn't they do one for Mass Effect 3 they did they did do last days of Mass Effect 3 and last days of portal and I there was one other I don't care I just want to see an animated team fortress 2 movie that would be fucking amazing fans can make them now well I didn't market them through steam it'd be crazy I still want to see if let's see a future-length animated movie because their shit is pretty awesome well there you got record Ralph coming I doubt team fortress characters are in it but they should be why not all right moving on to Nintendo I reference this a little bit earlier in the show but I wanted to go into depth on this a little bit because I'm sure Loki will have an opinion on this Nintendo is promising that their DLC will not leave users feel cheated or deceived this is a crew according to Satoru Iwata of course is Nintendo present the president of Nintendo because you know Nintendo is just now getting into DLC what it's 2012 and DLC has been prevalent since what about oh six oh seven when well they're just now getting an HD to some mean Nintendo is finally getting into DLC and here's what they said and one thing into excuse me what he said and one thing Nintendo is determined as a company policy what we are not going to do is create a full game and then say let's hold this back for DLC that's not our plan we're definitely not doing that it's an extreme example but I think there are examples of games where you get that initial purchase the very core part of the game and everything else around it is all DLC that's all a matter of opinion that's some subtle Capcom shading that that's all that well that is but that's also a matter of opinion because Capcom I'm sure in their defense would say that Street Fighter cross Tekken was a full game and that these additional characters are you know that just that they're additional but the rest of the internet called them out on that bullshit yeah it's on it's on disk it's paid unlock content and there's even like there's one story I didn't talk about it was sleeping dogs how they oh yeah we have six months planned of DLC it's all paid unlock stuff but to be fair that is a game where you don't really need that stuff it's just costumes and I don't think there's any additional missions or maybe but it's mostly costumes one quick other statement here so our goal is to create DLC in such a way the consumers do not feel they have been cheated or deceived now I believe there are people out there readers who have are worried about that I think it's a weird translation there and we just want to ensure them that we have in mind and want them to know that that's not what we are planning on doing so Nintendo planning and doing are two different things we're not sorry I'm doing it but you know it well you know it's not just a water that said this because I remember distinctly in that 3ds little press conference thing not the one for me three but the one that came out a little later where they spotlighted the games again it was like a one of those Nintendo Direct things that had Reggie and some of those guys from Nintendo in it he specifically said we're gonna have DLC for New Super Mario Brothers 2 but I want to assure everybody it's additional content we have a finished game first I mean they they really went out of their way to stress it's not something like that you're gonna have to have it is truly something extra the designers are working on we'll see what do you think Nintendo DLC I don't really know what the thing yeah cuz we haven't seen any examples yet I just think that New Super Mario Bros 2 is gonna be the first example of first party DLC anyway I just don't know if it's gonna I mean I would be I was always hoping that like you know excite truck you know hey all we need is DLC with new levels that's it just add new levels in I'll be happy of course that never happened and then we got a crappy sequel but you know the Mario Kart same thing people with that just add new level my problem with Mario Kart and this has been the case with it will be all old levels a lot of yes seriously that's the thing is you've released these old levels in every single Mario Kart it was cool the first time that you did it it's like hey that's kind of neat you know this this old Mario Kart levels in 3d now or it's in like you know the polygons and stuff now it's getting a little old it's it's getting a little tiresome just maybe do a Mario Kart game that didn't have the old tracks in it just a thought maybe instead of coming out with four circuits you just don't have the retro search I don't mind I don't mind the half half new half returning stuff I don't mind it but it's for me here it is it's all about this the price is right it is all about the cost because like what do you think would be a fair price to charge for let's say Nintendo were to put out five new tracks like a new circuit of five new tracks what would that be worth to you as DLC what would you pay for that depends what sir I mean if it's old really say all new let's say it's all new I'd say like five bucks really yeah I wouldn't want to see it more than $2.99 maybe I'm just a few really good tracks it just it would all depend on me you know but or like Mario Mario 2 coin rush levels three stages that I wouldn't buy yeah I don't know I don't know like it's really about the price is Nintendo gonna get the price right I don't know we'll see chiggers in our chat room at live dog network com says Mario Kart level editor and share please but then they wouldn't be able to charge you for DLC if they do that they have a Mario Kart level editor now on the Wii and there is some not official though is it now but there's some way you can do it with SD cards where you can load custom tracks on there same with the 3ds or not the 3ds yeah was it New Super Mario Rose on the Wii same thing with that you can do custom levels in that somehow I should say this though you know because some people say well if Mario Kart added that in then they wouldn't be able to sell DLC not necessarily the case look at something like little big planet does this very well you know big planet does great that reminds me there was a ROM hack for New Super Mario Brothers on the DS that was New Super Mario Bros 3 and it had a lot of really cool levels and stuff in it that would be kind of cool to compare that to the New Super Mario Brothers 2 now to see you know how you know how better one is than the other because I think that one had some really unique ideas that they do with it I don't know if we're gonna see that in a level design you know I don't know if a lot of those people are thinking that far outside the box like some of the ROM hackers do we shall see let's move on for now Dark Sakura with some more news well we do have something else from valve well I'm sure you're familiar with the perpetual testing initiative that was the in-game portal to editor I play a few other things someone's actually even gone and tried to recreate the entire first portal using nothing but at least the puzzles and everything using nothing but the in-game editor well now they have a patch that's going to be an update for that to let you do co-op that the co-op test chambers and you also have another option that's a quick play feature so that you can see the top rated user maps for each category it's gonna like I said free and it's also gonna come with a 75% off portal to vouchers that you can share the game with friend not bad huh no it's not bad at all I love you steam I love you so I can get a friend portal to whether they want it or not they want it they want it who wouldn't want portal to it's great I would think everybody should have it by now with all them steam sales I know right so this is kind of shocking during gamescom apparently some early builds of the game divinity were stolen out of the booth they literally picked up pcs and ran out of the building and somehow not didn't get caught how does that trend because how does that even happen we've heard about this happening at PAX and everything it's like I could see I could see it like if it was for whatever reason on like a a disc or something you know popping the disc out point in your pocket and run out of the well something like that happened at the last packs didn't it do we do we report on that or somebody had got it on like copied it to a USB drive or something and ran yeah I was it was I forget what game was but yeah I do remember that hmm but anyways so apparently the two games divinity dragon commander and divinity original sin have been stolen from Larry learning studios and they've actually posted a reward of $5,000 for anybody that can you know point fingers at who took them it was breach was the game that was stolen at PAX oh I'm sorry yeah it's just weird I'm surprised apparently you know they were using backup PC so there's no issues with new actual code being so yeah only make sense you back up that stuff is the only copy of the code that we have here yeah wouldn't be too ah shit but still still shitty that they have to you know plan that well I mean I mean back which is but it's shitty if somebody stole in the first place shit I mean come on it's gotta be on security cameras you're gonna notice someone hug you know how do you not notice first I do it's a PC don't they have to like unplug a bunch of shit and you know pull it out of there and I mean you're hauling this giant PC with you I mean doesn't that look at a little bit suspicious I mean when somebody going through the car going hey why is that guy got a PC with him I mean that that seems a little suspicious to me game grew in our chat room with the inappropriate joke guest appearance by Carmen San Diego yeah yeah when whomp whomp all right let's move on one more story before the mailbag for you guys this is also out of Gamescom something a little better than stolen things a little seminar about how to pitch your indie game to Sony oh excuse me this is not excuse me this is not out of Gamescom but close it's another Europe convention I sound like such an ignorant American right now my apologies it's game developers conference Europe GDC Europe also happened last week you may or not have heard but yeah there was a seminar by Pete Smith who is the Sony cross dev director of product development talking about basically what you should and you shouldn't do when you pitch your indie game he said quote I'm sick of sitting through crap development pitches hmm dark soccer let's play a game word let's see if you can guess what would be some of the do's and some of the don'ts if you're gonna pitch your indie game what are some of the do's and some of the don'ts what would be your guess Loki if you haven't spoiled this for yourself already you can play too well no cheating what to do when you're pitching it and what not to do yeah what would you do to pitch it and what what's what makes a good pitch and what doesn't make a good pitch well with a good pitch you want to definitely have some presentation materials like concept art something that's gonna be solid you want to have something well written out spelled correctly ding ding ding we have have assets this these include a one-page overview screenshots or video all on a USB stick for the publisher to keep don't waste time or money on swag good yeah I mean it's nice to have something kind of neat to throw in it but no one's gonna invest any money if they don't have at least an appetizer instead of the meat and potatoes you know they need to see what the vision is need to have a projection need to see you know have a financial comparison to see if there's other games of a similar genre what they're making money with and how this is going to compare to them you know financial presentation what not to do is just say oh I've got an idea for a game we give me money not to harass them with phone calls you send the first email you send them the test product you send a follow-up you wait for a response you know those aren't neither one that's not really on the list per se but I still think that's good advice I don't think that's necessarily wrong similar answers are there Loki did you cheat I didn't cheat all right what would you guess a pitch features tits and ass I you know what I will give that credit because on the do not list is be boring so certainly that is the opposite of boring be boring is on the do not list I don't think that they want it try to stay away from like graphs and charts maybe I'll make more just quick summaries of like here's here's my story here's you know the concept that type of thing again the opposite is true so D need that on the do list keep your visuals simple and bold basically so yeah so any house on the do list know what your game is be able to pitch it in 30 seconds yeah keep your visuals simple and bold you don't have to you want it you want to show off gameplay not graphics exactly you want to be succinct research focus don't ask them what a Vita is really if you're gonna pitch to Sony don't ask them what a Vita is really really I have something for your Vita system I have a vital game for the Vita well actually there's something else that occurred to me and I didn't look look at your screen that's haven't seen anything sure you want to make sure that the person making the pitch knows how to speak in front of people and then enunciate mm-hmm and has presence practice your pitch and choose the right person yeah or both there for real huh practice your pitch and choose the right person for the pitch someone who can talk about the game to a room of suits with ease exactly and who the average person does not know corporate speak sorry let's see also on the list here be able to adapt because some games often don't end up what their pitch manage your expectations Sony isn't gonna back a game unless it benefits them as well as you so be prepared to negotiate that IP I think that's a very realistic answer there let's see I think we hit on some of these other sell yourself as a company and as individuals I think that's very interesting because they say that you have to be able to work with the people not just the idea very interesting they say media molecule was a great example of this Sony wanted to work with the people they followed through media molecule probably brought us one of the greatest Sony games ever period little big planet show passion if you don't care why will they hi I'm Ben Stein and here's my game all right lastly on the do not list then we'll move on don't be boring don't bitch and whine about other developers or publishers I think that's great advice don't burn your bridges and they just say it's a small industry very true don't spend the entire time on your pitch because you want room for Q&A don't bullshit I you know there's already a million bullshit terms that though the people have used to fool the public like remember blast processing yeah that's true yeah you know what all that was that was the only thing the Genesis did better than the Super Nintendo just saying you know or like look at these graphics blah blah blah no substance you know that's bullshitting right there you just show them pretty like what was heavenly sword Jane enemy crabs know it also has blast processing hmm Chipotle all right here's the big ones from the do not list these are actually on the list and I Jamie you're just gonna go like really they have to tell people this really first Dave do do not tell the publisher how to do their job don't tell Sony why they're a bad publisher don't be late yeah and don't you ready for the last shut up tiger claw mode 7 was awesome what you ready for the last one don't be hungover really there don't be hungover because a lot of pitches are done at these types of e3 GDC big events right after a big parties don't come drunk the next day really yep really food for thought they suggest that you know you have the rest of your life to drink so that if you have a presentation the next day maybe you just shouldn't party the night before and not everyone has my mutant power to never have a hangover just saying a dungeon buster says wow those had to be on a list I know right tiger claw says by the way someone should pitch the olr the game it's already happening remember we got an indie game coming to the marketplace the bungee ferret tossing which I'm told is very soon it's happening soon I totally want to do a bumper play our game damn it I love I let Joe video wins with this comment and don't fuck it up yes RuPaul's Drag Race references will always win I will purchase the over day as product you win ma'am alright let's get to the mail bag every week we collect your mails is at mailbag at orange lounge radio.com there's my mailbag music dark soccer is going to put on her protective garb and dive into the mailbag headfirst and pull out some emails to read for use dark soccer I don't think you're whistling is getting picked up but I felt like whistling anyway hi olr hi enthusiastic emailer I'm currently listening to episode 469 now live I'm sorry you wrote I and but I think you meant and I heard Rob request emails for codes I'm so jealous of other live listeners because I cannot F and type fast enough well did you not screen the emails because we're going to have those emails that are like give me loot because we have loot now I'm going to read it all right that's fine if I get the code I will find some way to get Loki to don the tingle costume come hell or high water that's from spasmator I'm not sure if I understand how that's going to happen I don't believe that I was ever it'll be like Loki saw drugs or violence saw off your leg or we're hurting if I die live or die or tingle make your choice the song I don't well come on like what do we have now yearly paranormal activity movies Silent Hill revelations I know thank you very much so the trailer right mm-hmm do you see the poster contest I was so pissed off I missed the poster contest I think I would have won but anyway would have won for people who write would of should of its would have out would have should have would have the V actually is from half saying hi okay hey all our people this is honey but I knew honey badger was gonna email cuz honey badger told me an email aka blade 3 aka Sam call me whatever either way I just wanted to tell a little story about a funny experience with EA EA has been distinguished as being the world's shittiest company about two copies of the same game via origin basically a friend and I were looking for a way to play mercenaries two together because it was a cheap sale for it so I bought it with my origin account for me and then for him but wait origin does not have the feature to let you gift a copy of a game so I told my friend I would log in as him and buy it for him and I did my next move was contact EA to refund one of the games and after all I never access the download a game in any way and so why would there be a problem there so I pulled up EA live chat the rep I spoke to knew about one sentence of English so that was great I told the rep I want an American customer support number and he gave it to me of course I had to wait till business hours to call which I did and I told the American rep about my problem and he gladly refunded me no harm no foul we then had a conversation in which he told me origin and the entire EA digital game system is a travesty and is complete garbage I thought that says a lot when your own employees tell customers that they agree that their system is shit so that's all I just thought I so that's all just thought it was funny keep up the good work Sam there's really truly only one thing I can say about all of that what I'm gonna say there's hostile employees at every workplace so that's true this company sucks I ain't working here they're always the best because they'll give you the most stuff because they hate their job okay PS upon trying to play to place Mercs 2 online we found out EA no longer ran servers for the game and did not release a dedicated server for people to play overland PSS what's even better is that the copy of Mercs 2 I was refunded for still works and I got my money revenge woo a winner is you way to work this system okay it's because you got the employee who who checked out years ago this comes from Sam another Sam hi Sam dark soccer never ceases to bring up important points why thank you because I know I'm awesome dark soccer has me wondering if the next PlayStation and Xbox will have the same controllers as the current systems or will they be redesigned what do you all think I'll be redesigned there there's always a some type of redesign but think about this remember I don't I mean I don't know the marine controls is exactly what I was gonna say I don't know how long Sam's been following video game news but remember when the PlayStation 3 was first revealed they had that boomerang controller and everything what's this uncomfortable looking shit literally the internet all in unison went lol what and so they went back to a controller that kind of looked like the DualShock 2 except they looked exactly like the DualShock 2 but it had six axis remember was the big six axis because we can't put DualShock in it anymore because the lawsuit although that finally worked itself out and they put it back in there but you don't need rumble rumble was so last-gen and I need rumble anybody rumble was so last-gen Ridge Racers gonna use six axis so here's the deal which is pile of crap PlayStation 4 probably not gonna buck the trend too much I mean I would think maybe one thing they're gonna try to do I don't I don't know why I'm just putting my little light little tinfoil hat I think it'll kind of look like a ps3 controller but they're gonna try to push that rear touch thing on those controllers it's gonna be a little ridiculous but that's just what I think I can see that but I think the basic design isn't gonna change Xbox will change somewhat I think even the controller the controller design changed within that first as deep remember the remember the first Xbox was gigantic those gigantic Xbox controls and they scaled them down and then the Xbox 360 controller was relatively similar enough you know well and if now looking at other systems I think Nintendo is gonna have a different controller every second time yeah I mean that that's the one that is radically different every time that never looked really much difference was the well even when they brought out the top loading nest they had this nest style controller kind of but there was still a basic paddle and button layout you know now the ones that I as far as logical redesigns have gone as if you take the Sega systems gone for the master system gone to the Genesis gone to the six button Genesis controller to the Saturn that had a similar controller to the Genesis to the dual analog controller which I was I will stand on this to this day best controller ever then the Dreamcast carry the similar style to the the I just said it the dual analog controller because it made sense it was comfortable it looks hard but it's super comfortable 10 to 64 what the fuck was Nintendo thinking but I mean I think that using the those examples I think that the company's the the powers that be except for Nintendo have learned their lesson for making too many variables in you know when it comes to controller progression and are sticking with the tried-and-true shape this I mean I may not be the biggest Sony fan but I have to say that the controller has always had an ergonomically comfortable shape I do find it easier to hold it than I do an Xbox controller even though I tend to like games better on Xbox the PlayStation controller is easier to hold I think they'll stick with it one thing to keep in mind to free move on to the next email is that keep in mind the next Xbox is going to be very heavy on this whole whatever the new Kinect is whatever this advanced Kinect is Microsoft wants Kinect to happen I mean I guess Kinect already has happened but they want it to be more than a fad they're gonna shove this thing down your throat in the next Xbox so even though yes there will be a tangible controller there has to be for the halo games expect that Microsoft will make a big deal out of the whole hands free now you can control it with your fingers because it's so precise you can just use your little finger better be things you're gonna use little fingers to point at things that's awesome expect that play the controller as much as I want to like that concept I think that you're dealing with to the the bulk of gamers at least that have the money to afford any of this are going to be in our age group people who have grown up with a controller in their hand and they've tried this before with like remember the u-force oh that was crap or the activator they've tried hands-free controllers before and true the technology wasn't what it is today I mean definitely Kinect is I'd have to say up at the best of it but the very least with Nintendo and with the move you've still got something tangible that you can hold people like that tactile experience and you remember that thing that they were making for so you could feel the textures of things and games yeah how it was that thing was kind of cool the haptic stuff yeah that was pretty cool but I mean everybody said it was going to be in the next iPad so good okay now your iPad will touch you oh baby no but the whole point like I said oh you put your dick on it people like a tactile experience I bet they do that's what I'm talking about you guys are children seriously but logically take away the five-year-old laughing at everything am I right would do you prefer to have something in your hand while you play or do you like waving your hands in the air unless you're playing para para the yeah it's acceptable if I'm playing dance central that's really the only game and and it's clones those those dancing games are really the only ones that have really been a great experience dancing even the fitness stuff if that actually works you know mm-hmm yeah when the fitness games work yeah yeah I'll agree with that same thing same thing with the we you know and all that but um like for I just bitched about this last week of the week before that Disneyland Connect I want to pick up a controller and play it yeah oh and especially when you're dealing it's like they're trying to retrain an entire generation of gamers they want all the newer ones coming in to have a different experience and we did where I'm sorry we're the ones with the money and there's nothing wrong with having a controller you know now the only advantage like I said I can see for having some of this is like if someone's got my you know horrific hand problems but what did I do I stopped playing on the consoles and started playing on my PC well I think also that they want to get rid of the controller because a lot of elderly and older people think that controllers are too confusing and so it's like all you have to do is wave your hands oh I can do that I wave my hands at old random strangers all the time so I'm totally used to this my hand to get kids off my lawn I can use I can use this as another kind of analogy here I would I was in band and Rob you know this you were in band what you play clarinet yes okay well I put clarinet too so hush but anyone who's a musician also knows that when you play an instrument it's not necessarily that your brain learns it is that your fingers learn what to do you know you can I bet you anything that if I picked up my saxophone I could still play through any number of scales and not think about it because my fingers have been trained to do this my reflex is trained the same goes with playing a game after a while it's that your fingers your thumbs become accustomed to doing certain things you're not actively thinking that you're doing it you just make a decision and you do it you know it's instinct it becomes was it motor response isn't that what it's called motor memory or something yeah and so I think that's the other thing too is that if you look at the people who are worse with with being coordinated like actual dancing and everything I can't dance for crap but I can you know I can play a game I can you are like a son of a bitch exactly well exactly because that has to do more with the same thing that's you know it's a different type of your it's and you have your hand eye coordination going but you don't have something that's going to be an abstract movement as something that has attacked our response so anyway fair enough next email I forgot what I was saying oh yeah hi olr just wanted to type you a small email and let you know the last week show for wait for 69 was awesome nice job I also wanted to say that Shane was right about sound shapes and Rob your review was excellent it is truly a great game in a breath of fresh air for the Vita Loki I know you were an FPS fan are you going to get into CS go what's that no probably not gonna get into counter strike go thank you I was like what that he's like I'm on the beta now it's pretty to play one yeah it's a free to play one but I never played I never really played counter strike so well he says I'm on the beta now it's pretty good old-school counter strike with a new look anywho keep up the great work Travis well thank you for the compliments I love getting emails where it's just nothing but compliments really really first-person shooters to come on my second my second place genre of choice you know whereas you like bugs I like sans sandbox games yes I do need to go back to play she do or more sleeping dogs because that's pretty awesome but I'm really it's just all killing time before granted the five comes out and then it's just that's all it's gonna be that and also maybe a quick you know excursion to at the fence force on the Vita when that comes out the end of September in Japan can't wait all right let's get a little bit angsty here with the F you that's it for the mailbag right yes mailbag at orange lounge radio calm if you want to send us an email in the future in the meantime let's get angsty if use the week time dark Sakura this is going to be difficult for me to say but I did say it on my facebook and got into an argument with my mother of course I can see anything on Facebook about getting into argue with my mother fuck that I would like to say a current fu to the Republican Party and their choice of who's running and his running mate I don't think that I and I really am trying not to be judgmental I mean okay I'm a judgmental bitch anyway but it doesn't matter but anyone who supports that level of evil I don't know that I would be able to look them in the eye so fuck that level of evil and then see I guess if you to I don't know be burnt out at work I hear ya I would say it's kind of a similar f you not that I like nothing like I'm burned out on work as I really do like my job but just f you to the fact that I'm starting a class next week it's like oh god it's at my first class like nine months and it's gonna be the long hours again and prepare to get no sleep and all that stuff I'm just like f you do the toll it's about to take on my body and more importantly and f you to a real toll on my body f you to myself for overdoing it at the gym Monday because like I really hurt my leg by I guess I didn't stretch good enough beforehand or I did too much resistance and on the bike because I do a lot of cardio and yeah I was paying for it for like five days I couldn't go back to the gym I really wanted to go if I may hmm and this is what has been drilled into my head by all of I used to be really good friends with one of my gym the ladies that talk classes at my gym and you're supposed to do a five-minute light warm up then stretch then do your stuff oh I didn't do that I mean I do I do the light never stretch your muscles hold just go right in there high resistance obviously I tried to do the up down like the little you know up and down like type of thing but circuit style I guess but I don't like circuit implies to me you do five minutes on every machine I'm not at that level yet you know I just I it's if I can get my fat ass on a bike and roll around on it for an hour that is an accomplishment for me so but um it's you never want to work out with muscles that are cold you always want like Dan you should just go sit in a sauna before he did anything anything but honestly you actually want to work and then stretch and then work hmm interesting yeah just learning something we fit didn't tell me that or maybe it didn't I wasn't like I said you know all the time I used to spend working out so all right just a couple more news stories for you guys and then the skype line at 1 8 7 7 game olr as well as the Twitter topics have to get out my iPad and see if there are any and any last-minute stories Loki might have but first two final stories for you guys Loki all right so one of the games I mentioned that played this week was castle miner Z which is sold 900,000 copies and apparently is one of the fastest-selling Xbox live indie games not sure if it's the fastest selling one but I know because I know I made a zombie games in it all right look sorry about that game with zombies in it sold quite a bit and then I'm sure there's been some other ones that have done well as a part of the indie games program but it's definitely one of the most recent ones according to the developer and then also I guess it is at the top of the daily best-selling area of xbox.com right now and it's only 80 microsoft points so if you want to check it out I'm sure there's also a lot of other good games for 80 microsoft points on the indie games as well and another unrelated news minecraft 7 million copies sold on PC so that's pretty cool so that genre of game seems to be doing pretty well it just won't die the phenomenon will not stop well something that has stopped a guitar hero or at least it's on ice for a little while and now the lawsuits can begin they of course started some time ago but uh you know we talked about no doubts lawsuit well they're not the only ones that are suing Activision over the whole guitar hero and band hero stuff axle rose remember Guns N' Roses well axle rose had a preliminary hearing about the guitar hero 3 lawsuit apparently there is a tentative court date in February 2013 axle rose is pissed about the game which came out in late 2007 as a reminder and it will finally go to court in 2013 apparently it unlawfully associated Guns N' Roses music with slash who as you know was formerly with good Guns N' Roses and him and axle rose they don't get along so axle rose was pissed about that basically saying slash was associated with these songs but they're not his song so fuck all y'all right well the judge during the preliminary hearing wanted to toss out the claim of fraud because the statute of limitations has expired however let's see it came up here quote the reason I did not file a lawsuit because Activision through my managers and representatives offered me a separate video game and other business proposals worth millions of dollars to resolve and settle my claims relating to guitar hero 3 from December 2007 through November 2010 Activision was offering me a Guns N' Roses dedicated video game a game dedicated to music from the Chinese democracy album and other proposals interesting so the judge did dismiss the claim of fraud but the breach of contract it is moving forward for February 1st 2013 so that's why it took axle rose three years to file a lawsuit because they were basically cock teasing him about his own game or so he claims allegedly all that good stuff but it makes sense why they decided not to do it because when guitar hero Van Halen and band hero and all that kind of oversaturated the market you know I don't those artists centric video games none of them really did very well the only one that did marginally good was the Beatles and when the Beatles can only do marginally successful it's not good enough you know the Green Day one didn't do so hot Van Halen not so great what was the other one there was one more guitar hero italica allah oh god that was not just not a good game so raman our chat room says a dedicated actual rose game and Aerosmith does it come complete with heroin does it come with shame and a bottle of vodka oh I like his better welcome to unemployment all right you know what what I need to find something different for the fortune cookie real quick it's the best thing ever so hold on all right you do that send it to me in private message we'll switch it out all right uh skype lines open guys one eight seven seven game olr or our username on skype is orange lounge radio go ahead and give us a call if you want to talk about anything we've talked about in the news tonight or maybe you have something new I don't know I'm gonna do some quick Twitter topics we don't have a lot of them but we do have a couple of them SSJ 100 Matt sent us a tweet and I think I already know what this is without going to it but he says it's a tweet that says this is how China gets rid of outlawed arcade machines or what they call gambling machines and he sends us a link to a story from arcade heroes calm yep I had a feeling look at all these arcade machines on fire they just set them on fire burn it with fire burn it with fire and there they go Loki do you have any last-minute stories for us no I forgot to mention it as part of my gaming week I actually played mega zooks that's right the old ZZT type game actually booted that up I was like oh hey I'll make something in this and then I realized how out of practice and making stuff with mega zooks I was so I said that fuck it don't care anymore I remember mega zooks that's awesome it was awesome good times all right let's go to some tweets from Tiger claw heavy rain director tells game industry it's time to grow up before I even get into the article what do you guys think is it time for the games industry to grow up here's we mean by grow up here's here's the one goes to one corner the other goes to another corner here's the pole here's the pole quote from gamasutra which Tiger claw linked us to on Twitter at twitter.com slash olr I mean how many first-person shooters can you make there's a moment where we need to grow up and that's David cage who is the director of beyond two souls you know I'm sorry it sounds like he needs a grow up because he's just it sounds like he's whining that heavy rain didn't sell as well you know what they're making games that sell well hold on though because I do agree with this you know that pole quote is a little sensational but let's get into the full quote here now I'm in the article quote I think we should have more courage in our industry and take more risks because I think this is what the industry needs now I mean how many first-person shooters can you make how many monsters alien zombies can you killing games there's a moment where we need to grow up we need to grow up I think I often think the industry suffers at the Peter Pan syndrome it's the fact that we don't want to grow up so we stay kids but there is a moment where you need to grow up as an industry and you cannot keep up with the Peter Pan syndrome you need to grow and I think this is the right time maybe I don't agree so much with the second part of that but the first part about they need some different shit I kind of agree with it like you know who isn't sick of sequel sequel sequel sequel I mean granted I guess in some ways we support it but I do like a lot of the new ideas you know if we did never experimented with new ideas we wouldn't have recent hits like Mass Effect or Little Big Planet or which granted all spawn their own sequels but you know good games even on the indie side braid limbo Mass Effect kind of turned into just a shooter with this story but I'm just I think that the reason why they're not taking risks right now because whenever they seem to try to take risks they end up not selling well those games and you know some of these companies are in trouble like THQ for example they took a risk with you know making that whole you know tablet drawing pad thing because everyone's like oh hey cool it's like you know like Mario Paint and then no one bought it and then you know they're they're out a lot of money because that franchise never took off or you know Tony Hawk they made you know the stupid game with the skateboard and that was taking risks and no one bought it and then they did you know DJ hero and that was kind of taking risks as well in the music genre and I thought it's a pretty cool game but not that many people bought it so this is what you get pretty ourselves mad mad world there's another example of a game that took risks on the Wii no one bought it um conduit pretty awesome first-person shooter game on the Wii no one bought it so that's where your risk come back left act Epton chat says I bought Mario Paint well yeah you bought Mario Paint but you didn't buy the tablet that thq put out or the one that Ubisoft put out I am I am woefully neglecting the skype line over here let me take some call I just missed that one let me take this one though there's two calls lighting up right now hi you're an orange sauce radio who's this the new soccer here hey Zaku what's on your mind buddy nothing much just recovering of a actually just recovering from like going up my girlfriend today and everything and kings of the coast yesterday recovering huh yeah get it um yeah that is true I would have competed today but yes as I have relationship and everything she comes first wait a minute the expert of it so okay so there is it there was a 2dx tournament today there was the kings of the coast at 8 on the break so and you you you now you you've been called in you've been calling in on the show for a long time to talk about bimani games odd stuff and you know I know you I know you love your your old school games and so forth but am I hearing it right that now you have to say you you you turned your back on bimani today so you could get laid is that what I'm hearing that and what and and watching expendables too with her which she actually like enjoyed like even though she was kind of hesitant at first she actually enjoyed watching old man like shoot guns and kill people well she's a keeper I think that's amazing that finally it's the Zaku is now officially over bimani everybody and not really girls are going for today only for that day I mean I might compete next year if I'm more prepared but right now it's like I didn't want to bother this year because I said we already like been dating for for a little over six months now so it's like it makes sense to just skip this this path and try the next one mm-hmm there will definitely be another Kings of the Coast next year given the fact that it was like it was packed last it was packed yesterday and a lot of people entered I think they're about they're almost wrapping up the doubles tournament right now as we speak what version of 2dx do they have out there in Jersey link oh wow they have out not far from me and Queens nice that's not you know what though it's not hard to pack eight on the break I seem to remember it was kind of a small place is it well because the arcade machines took up a lot of room it would be hard to pack that joint and I say the same thing about SVGL what is similar I mean it's it's not hard to pack that place because there's not a lot of space anyways speaking or let's digress a little bit sure I'm gonna like post up a link to an article that you probably like already discussed in uh probably earlier before I got on maybe about the Assassin's Creed 3 director basically chiding Japanese games and playing the race card because they're basically getting a free pass actually we didn't bring this up earlier so I'm glad you are go ahead and tell us a little bit about this all right long story short the director of the creative director of Assassin's Creed 3 Alex Hutchinson he basically went on a rant earlier last earlier last weekend and in deriding why like a certain like Japanese games are getting like free passes like something about me I saying stuff about like Japanese just how many Japanese games are released where the stories are literally gibberish literally gibberish there's no way you could write it with a straight face and you're gonna say oh really yeah let me let me let me read this quote here and this is what you're going off of here and this is in an interview with CVG he said just think about how many Japanese games are released where their stories are literally literally gibberish literally gibberish there's no way you could write it with a straight face and journalists say oh it's brilliant then Gears of War comes out and apparently it's the worst written narrative in a game ever I'll take Gears of War over Bayonetta every any time it's patronizing to say oh those Japanese stories they don't really mean what they're doing I don't get why critics didn't like Gears of War that's news to me and I don't like better game when he talks about the whole deal but the real kicker is like the his first response you want my real answer I think there's a subtle racism in the business especially on the journalist side where Japanese developers are forgiven for doing what they do I think it's condescending to do this so he really like goes off the bat he really like goes through the juggler on the first on the first sentence I just I think he's I mean what about we just talked I'll tell you what we did talk about earlier in the show Final Fantasy you know the Final Fantasy 13 did get hazed for a lot of that stuff and being too linear in a way and then of course 14 got right through the damn coals so well 14 was an abomination because it was poorly executed and the fact that so many like gaps and in the beginning and then to the point where they had actually you know the creative director and the producers had to like hand in the resignations it was just a cluster whereas if you I mean if you look at other American RPGs like Skyrim which I'm actually going through right now thank you steam sale of last month but you see how how how verse that game is like it's getting to the point where I'm like putting at least two hours a night right now just on Skyrim alone because it's like so much so many things to do you can level up your character if you wanted to continue on the side on the main quest do some side quests try your luck in killing Giants and so it's also but it's almost like a GTA but with actual like goals towards like beefing up your character stats and I think what goes wrong with a with Japanese games like Final Fantasy it only sticks to I mean there is an open world there is a concept of an open world but everything is pretty much linear in the sense that you have to do x mission y mission side quests and obviously we did the occasional grinding there's no like there's no retribution where you could attack freely any other type of enemy because the combat system is so like it's so rigid in the sense that you randomly encounter enemies you have to fight within within that realm of your enemy versus your characters I mean I'm going I'm using Final Fantasy 7 as a frame of reference but you get the idea that the way like but that's the like it you know I'll do like Squeenix was just thinking outside the box and applying what they've already done best why can't people just like what they like let's just like what we like and leave people alone well I mean I don't understand why he's got it you know some people like the Japanese stuff and let it be but I don't think just because you like one Japanese game means you love them all or just because you love Jeff all Japanese games there's gonna be a few you hate you know I don't know just it's just way too broad of a statement and I'm hoping this is just media sensationalism here that we're only perpetuating with this call because I I would really just hope that he's not that narrow-minded I don't know so all right Zaku I gotta wrap up let you go so we get more calls any other thoughts here before I let you go oh that was about it all right have fun and be safe be safe definitely all right bye 1 877 game olr or username on skype is orange lounge radio if you want to give us a call I'll

what's up otherwise I was calling to have a discussion about the new walking dead game that I downloaded on my iPad this weekend walking dead walking dead it's my telltale and it's nice what we like telltale telltale I like them too man look it's good it's gonna be a little bit of a spoiler review because I only played the first like half hour of it anyway it's first episode so spoilers are okay there was a scene listen it was to see when I was in the house and the zombie came out to me a little zombie like babysitter shit and I kicked that zombie in the snatch and then the zombie the zombie fell down and I picked up the hammer oh my god like you you schmuck the zombie in the face of the hammer and until toes like hey would you like to stop or keep going I was like okay I'll keep smashing this thing in the face when you smash it that's the kind of options gamers want yet satisfied it was gross yet satisfied would you like to see more we could get enough of it and it's so simple like it's so like it was a little bit they say it's just point-and-click but there is a bit of a quick time to it every now and again that you're gonna do but it's like baby quick time you know what I'm saying yeah like it's pretty baby quick time which is exactly what I need on a Sunday night when I've been having salad it's not really so anyway anyway hey I also wanted is Rob even around and Rob Lee Rob was being domestic just got back hi Jim Sally hi Rob Roberts how are you I'm good I'm being domestic right now so I I had to walk away from the studio for a minute but what's up listen listen Rob hmm right I started I started shopping for microphones are you are you setting up the Jim Sally Studios think so man I think it's time for I think it's time for pillow talk man are you started I even started making a little theme music and stuff man for the show I gave like I gave Jim Sally a name for his show because Jim Sally suggested he be the opener for the opener like he could open for Bobby which I don't consider Bobby an opener I consider him a cohead liner but since he calls himself an opener I'll go with that Jim Sally said he could be the opener for the opener but I said well Jim I think you would be better as the closer and you could be pillow talk with Jim Sally like right as we go off the air he could like read you all a bed time story now go the fuck to sleep you're listening to the night train with Jim Sally like that the night train that's good that's good all I'm saying I'm just throwing it out there for you for you Jim or for anybody out there in the in the universe listening to this show vog network we are very interested in getting some movie podcast would be great book podcast is like at the top of my want list right now be it manga comic or written book and bugging my wife also wrote I I would love to see like a role play bit like an old-school tabletop gaming and it could be larping Dungeons & Dragons and I love love love so do this I love love love the idea of a game that is podcast like somebody who's not sure that would be difficult somebody who's actually running a game to be podcast it's done everyone at the table would need a microphone now I get some good food mics well that or and you'd have to have the die cam you see them rolling and see who's cheating at the table oh and I didn't nudge that that was I sneezed Jamie just rolled a seven on the 20-sided die so this means that she has failed her intelligence check please which would be really sad given that you know if I failed an intelligence check with a seven given that I know okay that's really giving it away but but for real although I will say this as much as I am teasing Jim Sally with the idea of starting his own show involved we do like to look for established shows we we want something to kind of go off of like we need a couple episodes under your belt so we know you're serious about it because we are not looking for shows that are gonna do it for two weeks and then quit that would be the problem so anyhow anyhow why don't you leave the microphone on today when you leave but I'll go do some pillow talk there I'm ready for it that I'm okay with I got a review of of 21 jump Street quick here's a little here's a little review snippet that maybe you're gonna hear about it has a lot of a dick jokes in it you know is it best use of comedic dick in 2010 you know for a show that would end up being on like after midnight on the East Coast on a Sunday night Monday morning I anything goes really anything goes that's Jim Sally anything goes my bitches and hoes all right Jim anything else you want to share with us tonight before we let you go uh I would just like to say thank you for the encouragement and and I'm going to try really hard to do stuff for you you're welcome anytime anytime buddy all right take care and give a gift give baby a kiss for me mwah I'm biting my pillow right now careful all right bye does he know what that means I don't you you use that word but I don't think it means what you think it means all right if we did a tabletop gaming cast it would have to be called roll to hit I'd like what was the comment in chat chiggers says call it reroll I like that that's a good one Stan says I want to see an anime show on vogue network rama might want to let you know there is one on Tuesdays at 630 Pacific what they're you there you see answering listeners demands I want to see an anime show on vogue Network alright tune in on Tuesday done technically you don't see it all right is there any more calls gonna come in one oh hello Twitter I forgot Twitter yeah Rob stop forgetting Twitter the hell was that all that forgetting what that was a weird noise all right rama in chat says thank you you're welcome baby okay one more tweet from tiger claw god I fucking hate this when you go to mobile websites game spot now has a free iPad app click OK to get that fuck no one car I wanted your app I would go download it the worst are the ones with the gigantic splash screen so obviously tiger claw linked me to a game spot article oh but there's a call coming in so you'll just have to wait and see what it's about hi you're on orange launch radio who's this well hello there fine oler Ian's it's stir luck I got called fine what's up stir luck not too much I don't know if you talked about the Vita firmware update in part a I kind of missed a lot of it briefly it let off our rapid-fire news tonight but go ahead it was we talk quickly about it so what do you want to say about it um well it kind of makes me want a Vita now what what a firmware update makes you want a Vita what is it about the firmware update that makes you want it because they added a feature that should have been in there from the beginning which is use of the buttons in the home screen which you would think would have been in there by default but I don't know what the hell so he was thinking now something the listeners may not remember about you from previous phone calls to the show but you're blind right yep so this is something that is kind of important if you're trying to navigate that was literally I was pretty stoked for the Vita when I heard about some of the games that were coming to it especially like Mortal Kombat something like sound shapes too is awesome you know I think I think even being you know with blind the way you kind of interact with the sounds and the fact that the sounds kind of drive the stage a little bit I think you'd get a kick out of it um okay to have um how prevalent is the touchscreen and sound chips I don't really done a lot of research into it or is it all button-based you don't have to use it at all if you want to design stages you have to use it a little bit but if you interesting when I have to check that one out I think I think you get a kick out of it I'm also a big fan of the Riven rhythm heaven slash Tengoku series on the GBA and DS and we most recently those are pretty awesome do you think that maybe Sony realized you know oops we're not really being accommodating all people I know some people that did send letters to them about it and not all of them being blind I've heard even a lot of sighted people bitching so it's it's not just a blind thing it's a convenience thing also it is true like sometimes you don't like you don't need to be all touchy-feely with the game system like sometimes it's it's fine to let me put it this way I like my buttons one of the bitches I had about sound shapes on the Vita was that it wasn't nearly as precise on the Vita in in the design phase the game phase is fine but the design phase isn't nearly as precise on the Vita because you have to use like that back touch panel to like stretch things and you know put them where you want and stuff and it kind of stinks but when you play on the PlayStation 3 you can use the controller and you get that precision much more with the analog sticks yeah yeah it's much better so that was you know pretty awesome a bitch of mine so yeah all right well stir lock anything else you want to share a listeners tonight um I don't know I was just having random thoughts actually I don't remember where I found it now but Jim Sally was talking about like D&D sessions and like podcast worm I've seen that done before and it's pretty awesome it is it is I would love to get a show like that on that would be funny though like doing the whole you know World Series of Poker style commentary like Dark Sakura has deployed her 20-sided die she's currently attempting her saving throw I was low and she didn't quite make it I would love it but you know we'll have to we'll have to see what's out there because you know as Bobby's emphasizing in chat we are kind of looking for shows that are already you know because we don't really want to bring on show again it's all about you know people might have an idea and like oh I want to do this I want to do this but then they don't realize how hard it really is there's a lot of work that goes into it is doing something I mean I do a I do a little shameless plug why not I do a little show on Thursday afternoons oh sorry that's my Twitter yes I have Mario sounds on my Twitter a giant nerd that's all right um but yes three to five Eastern on Thursdays I do a show on a station called infinity radio called video game felt Valhalla where I play two hours of video game music or like stuff from like the angry video game nerd or the spoonie one stuff like that basically anything pertaining to video games I bet that's a good time you have a good announcer voice you do I'm not just thank you saying that so I bet I bet that's a good time and it's not up against any vog programming so you're good well that's good all right still I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show but thanks so much for your call all right good luck what was that again video game Valhalla video game Valhalla on infinite infinity radio sorry all right check it out folks have a good one sir lot see ya thanks bye bye all right that's going to do it for the skype line tonight thank you guys so much for calling in sorry if you didn't get through although I got to admit it was a little light on the call tonight I think I got almost everybody was trying to get through but if I missed you I may not have seen it I'm very sorry send us an email mailbag at orange lounge radio calm let me get back real quick to that tweet that I mentioned from Tiger claw will close out with this tonight dice the battlefield developer afraid to release battlefield 3 mod tools they said at GDC Europe that apparently the studio was fearful of the implications of releasing the mod tools let's see they were quote and this is a quote from Magnus Trudson who is the general manager of dice said quote afraid of all the things that can come with releasing the code quote if we do mod support we want to do it really really well we are not ready to do this yet interesting I guess oh and also that if the mods come out they want console players in two I think that part's kind of interesting as well is that they don't want to just just let it be for PC they want console players to get in on the fun that's kind of nice pretty cool all right I have a couple I have a couple last-minute tweets here so what the hell I'll read them there's a couple tweets here from ratchet 1785 on Twitter they literally came in one minute ago so I'll go ahead and read these ratchet 1785 asks are you guys excited about Borderlands 2 first live show by the way and this is the best three-year listener well howdy doody and get your button chat next time if you're not already there I don't see you there live dot vog network calm are you guys excited about Borderlands 2 I don't even have to ask Loki I I don't know if excited is the right word but I'm highly curious about Borderlands 2 because I liked what I played of Borderlands 1 I really need to play more of it so yeah I'm I will check it out and I like some of the things they're doing with it I don't like that whole mess earlier this week about the whole girlfriend mode and all that crap that was going around but I'm just gonna chalk a lot of that up to the media and Twitter and the internet kind of latching on to one thing and then running with it and it's not going to affect the quality of the game I think at the end of the day the way that they're doing like an easy mode tree that sounds great to me that's not a girlfriend mode that's a me mode and I know there's a lot of people that feel the same way you know I don't mind playing that the games on on an easier mode to get the story and the experience I'm actually planning on playing through Mass Effect 3 on insanity good luck in God though a good well then that's no fair no all right and lastly also tell your listeners I'm giving away a copy of Borderlands 2 on my gaming channel on youtubes but then he didn't link it so I'm gonna hope it's the same name ratchet 1785 if it's not the same name I guess tune in next week cuz that's gonna do it for tweets tonight twitter.com slash o LR and that's about gonna do it for the show tonight but not until we go around and get everybody's final thought um Loki will start with you because you said there's no last-minute stories right yeah I just don't care Farida it's been a three-hour show tonight we can wrap up Loki we plus the podcast is even gonna be a little longer because thankfully we have the Dark Siders 2 song in there so I think we're gonna wrap up Loki do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight I just gonna say retweet that thing that I tweeted about evil lot they're having a contest on their site and whoever gets the most retweets gets a picture drawn by one of the artists and she does really kick-ass art so I would like I would like a picture because she does like pixel art and it looks fucking awesome so you need a retweet like I need I need a retweet I retweet it or I sent it out and I can't I can't figure out how to like and I did it once because obviously I copied in the chair but I can't remember how I got the direct link to that tweet and I was like you click on if you go to your actual Twitter page I think there's a way to see see details or detailed tweeters on maybe okay well it's it's on my Twitter at Loki olr and just retweet it you know it's the one talking about you live it's done by foodie monster or he's the animator on it still would like to know where footy monster went and where have you been footy monster come back to what are probably busy but um you know it seriously you should go back and even I mean it looks like a pretty cool game and they're under halfway there right now they're only looking for 10 grand I will retweet from the olr account my personal account just for you I will appreciate that and the courthouse account and if anybody can anybody else can do it that'd be awesome because right now I'm the only one who retweets on on there but I would like to you know I want a picture it looks awesome seriously that's awesome and and you should go back the game because it's awesome I backed it so yeah check it out good deal um my final thought tonight my final thoughts tonight is sleep soon Czz dark soccer your final thought tonight I was just peeking at tumblr for a second and someone posted a gif of someone dying during an MRI why would you put that on the internet's grand well no it's it's all just a scam but it says that you're I'll just read what says this is someone dying while having an MRI scan before you die your brain releases tons and tons of endorphins that make you feel a range of emotions tragically beautiful wah wah wah I don't
