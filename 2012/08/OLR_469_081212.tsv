7000	12000	Here's your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loku
14000	18000	Tonight, August 12th, 2012, Amazon starts a new game studio
18000	21000	Valve is set to use Steam for non-gaming applications
21000	25000	and has an R-rated version of a Super Nintendo game been discovered?
25000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
36000	40000	where every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio
40000	45000	for this August the 12th of 2012 and the 400 and, wait for it
45000	49000	69th episode of our show
49000	51000	That doesn't imply anything by the way
51000	52000	No, not at all
52000	55000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours
55000	58000	to talk about video games, gaming culture, and so forth
58000	62000	with my co-host and those of you live and participating with us at VOG Network
62000	63000	but I'll get back to that in a minute
63000	65000	First, let me introduce my co-host
65000	68000	Say hello to Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers
68000	72000	It implies that Rob has an internal 12 year old girl
72000	73000	What?
73000	75000	That's giggling at the 69
75000	77000	You have a little girl inside of you? That's really weird
77000	81000	Well, funny enough, I was playing Disneyland Connect Adventures today
81000	84000	which I didn't think we were going to get into gaming weeks as fast
84000	86000	but okay, why not, it's a special night
86000	89000	I found my inner little girl
89000	91000	because you can choose to be a boy or a girl
91000	93000	and I was like, well I'll be the little girl with pigtails
93000	94000	because she's cute
94000	98000	so maybe, Dark Sakura, maybe there is some truth to what you're saying
98000	101000	Well I was just like, 69 tee hee
101000	103000	Yeah, I know, when you say like 69
103000	106000	and start talking about girls, it is a little bit of a creeper zone
106000	108000	so we probably shouldn't go there, it's just a little creepy
108000	109000	I like pie
109000	110000	Pie is good
110000	111000	Pie is good
111000	112000	Pie is great, so is coffee
112000	115000	Also over there, say hello to tech master Loki
115000	116000	Hi
116000	117000	How you doing, Loki?
117000	118000	I'm doing fine
118000	119000	So what do you say?
119000	121000	For old times sake, let's get Karaoke Revolution out
121000	122000	No
122000	123000	No one plays that anymore
123000	125000	Okay, well I have SingStar
125000	126000	No one plays any karaoke games anymore
126000	127000	SingStar ABBA?
127000	128000	No, I'm sorry, that's not acceptable
128000	130000	Oh my god, SingStar ABBA, we totally need to do SingStar ABBA
130000	133000	I think we should do some live on air SingStar ABBA tonight
133000	134000	But I won't sing
134000	136000	Would you like to maybe do a duet on SingStar ABBA later?
136000	137000	Maybe
137000	139000	Maybe just for the listeners for the occasion?
139000	140000	Maybe
140000	141000	I don't wanna talk
141000	144000	Come on, come on, you wanna do it, alright
144000	147000	Say hello as well, we have some special guests in the studio tonight
147000	151000	Please welcome back to the show, I'm always very happy to see him here in studio
151000	154000	And part of that is because he has a very sexy radio voice
154000	156000	Say hello to Jason
156000	158000	And I'm always glad to be back in California
158000	160000	Welcome back, even in the triple degree heat?
160000	165000	Uh, it's no uh, 68 foggy San Francisco bay, but I still make the triple
165000	167000	It's 69 foggy Sacramento bay, excuse you
167000	169000	Uh oh, right, right
169000	172000	I'm gonna milk those jokes for all they're worth tonight
174000	176000	Loki just gave me a look
176000	181000	God, I wish it was a- I mean, I don't wish it was a TV show, but like, I do sometimes
181000	186000	I wish Loki had a camera, that's the only one that needs to be on cam, is Loki, let's be real
186000	187000	I don't need to do that
187000	188000	That's the only one that people wanna see
188000	192000	His stealth webcam, considering the ones persistently pointed at his face
192000	197000	I do have a camera like, faced right at me, like the entire time
197000	202000	We need like the type of like, you remember like MTV back in the 90s where it was like audience cam
202000	203000	Where they had music?
203000	206000	Candy cam, yeah, back when they had music and like remote control and stuff
206000	211000	Like we need that zany audience cam, that's like, just like Blair Witch Project style shaking and all that
211000	215000	Japanese variety TV shows usually have one of the comedians or talents
215000	218000	They'll basically picture and picture the person right in the corner
218000	223000	So that when the news is interesting, shocking, whatever, you get that reaction cam right away
223000	224000	Something like that would be perfect
224000	225000	I love that
225000	229000	And they do it like all the time when I was watching Morning News with me
229000	231000	Alright, we have another guest here in studio tonight
231000	234000	And I'm so happy to introduce this person to the show
234000	238000	Because I know it's somebody who's been a long time listener of OLR
238000	244000	And she has finally made it to the studio after a 469 week pilgrimage
244000	246000	What can I say, she walked, no I'm kidding
246000	249000	But we're so happy to welcome, what am I calling you tonight?
249000	252000	You better introduce yourself because I don't want to call you the wrong thing tonight
252000	258000	Well I always went by Rai Chan and that's what I am on the chat, so hello
258000	261000	Hello Rai Chan, welcome to the show
261000	264000	I just call you Rai for short because I don't know, I heard Jason calling her that one
264000	267000	So I was like, I like that, Rai works for me
267000	271000	So Rai Chan, how are you?
271000	275000	It's good to finally be on vacation, it's good to finally be out here
275000	277000	Yeah
277000	281000	Awesome, so how long have you been listening to Orange Launch Radio, it's been a while right?
281000	286000	Yeah, I started about the time when Jason and I actually met
286000	292000	So it's been about 8 years or so
292000	295000	So you used to play, back in the day you used to play DDR and all that stuff?
295000	299000	Yeah, that's how actually Jason and I met, so
299000	306000	Okay, I want to hear the story, how did Jason and Rai meet over DDR?
306000	311000	The couple, the particular points that were interesting were
311000	315000	Obviously her living in Colorado, myself living in New Mexico
315000	319000	I being a mod for the Southwest part on DDR Freak
319000	322000	It all started because I told her she was breaking the rules
322000	325000	That was my first reason to explicitly
325000	327000	Did you give her a point?
327000	332000	Never, good choice of words
332000	334000	Back to the story, did she
334000	339000	I didn't say did you give her a prick, I said did you give her a point?
339000	342000	The DDR Freak rules were outside of the imaging forum
342000	345000	That pictures couldn't be more than 300x300
345000	349000	And I used it as an excuse to private message her and say
349000	351000	Well the rules say this, so could you please do that?
351000	357000	And she was very, well and how dare you, posted image over 300 kilobytes on a forum
357000	359000	Shame on me
359000	365000	So we all kind of started, her and myself and a bunch of other people
365000	369000	Started getting on aimchat rooms just talking for all hours of the night
369000	371000	Whatever random things
371000	374000	We were actually talking about this, we were over at Iguana Girls House
374000	376000	New place earlier this morning
376000	380000	And I actually mentioned that both Rai and myself were on LiveJournal
380000	384000	And I saw her commenting on a post of Iguana Girls
384000	388000	And I found out that she was on LiveJournal as a result
388000	391000	So I started checking out her posts and commenting on them
391000	394000	Oh my god, we're talking about DDR freakin' LiveJournal
394000	397000	Tonight's show is like 10 years in the past
397000	399000	This episode of OLR was brought to you by a...
399000	401000	Hey, I'm in a time warp tonight
401000	404000	We're out doing the take to late for NBC
404000	406000	Alright
406000	407000	It's the OLR time capsule
407000	411000	Bringing you live coverage tonight of the Sydney 2000 Olympics everybody
411000	414000	We actually recorded this show 10 years ago but no one even knows
414000	416000	We're just playing it back
418000	422000	Okay, so Rai, obviously, I mean we go back to the DDR days
422000	423000	But I know you're a gamer girl
423000	426000	What types of video games are you into? Or computer games or what have you?
426000	428000	Mostly RPGs, puzzle games
428000	429000	Diablo
429000	430000	Diablo
430000	431000	Lots and lots of Diablo
431000	432000	Lots of Diablo
432000	435000	I've got two level 60s and I'm working on a third
435000	437000	Addict
439000	441000	I play a lot of World of Warcraft
441000	443000	I play a lot of World of Warcraft
443000	445000	A lot of World of Warcraft
445000	447000	And every time I sign on
447000	449000	There's always at least one person on my real ID
449000	451000	Can anyone guess who is always on real ID?
451000	453000	Signed in playing Diablo 3
453000	455000	That would be me
455000	458000	Okay, so Diablo 3 has taken a lot of shit out there
458000	460000	But obviously you don't care because you're playing it
460000	463000	So why are haters hating on Diablo 3
463000	465000	And why can they go just hate in the corner?
469000	472000	You know, with me, I started with Diablo 2 when I was in high school
472000	477000	It's one of those things that I have always really, really liked
477000	479000	So I waited for it to come out
479000	482000	People hate, people always hate
482000	484000	Let them hate, I don't care
484000	485000	Haters to the left
485000	488000	Okay, we're just gonna play a little bit of word association
488000	490000	I'm gonna say a phrase, you tell me what comes to mind
490000	491000	Alright, you ready?
491000	493000	Real money auction house
493000	495000	Don't do it
495000	498000	I've sold a couple things on there
498000	501000	But otherwise I don't really participate in it
501000	503000	PVP patch
503000	506000	Not something that I care about
506000	508000	You know, you wanna go through and kill other players
508000	509000	Go for it
509000	511000	Activision
514000	516000	I just gotta laugh
516000	518000	And that's about it
518000	520000	Well said, well said
520000	522000	Well, welcome to the show
522000	524000	Rai, I'm sorry she's a little quiet you guys
524000	526000	She's actually, because we have five people tonight
526000	528000	She's actually having to share a mic with me
528000	530000	And the me mic
530000	531000	Rob, don't shut up
531000	532000	That's right, I have a very loud voice
532000	534000	So the me mic is tuned for my voice
534000	536000	So when Rai talks in it, she's a little quiet
536000	539000	But I appreciate your prompt attention to Rai
539000	541000	And the things she has to say
541000	544000	Hey, we do tape live at the Voice of Geeks Network
544000	547000	vognetwork.com is where you can join us
547000	549000	And in the chat, live.vognetwork.com
549000	551000	Is where you can participate, check in
551000	553000	Get loot and VoG points and all that stuff
553000	556000	And have your chat comments
556000	559000	Possibly read here on the show
559000	561000	And some folks here in the chat room
561000	563000	Let's see, BlackWolf is reminding us
563000	565000	That tonight's show has been tape delayed ten years
565000	567000	Yes, Frisbee says
567000	569000	Live from Salt Lake City
569000	571000	Close, Jason might have gone through there
571000	573000	On the trip here, right?
573000	576000	Uh, Provo and
576000	579000	I-70 goes through both
579000	581000	The rail takes a destination that goes through Provo
581000	583000	And has a stop in Salt Lake City
583000	585000	There you go
585000	587000	I want to talk about presents
587000	589000	Because Loki was really awesome
589000	591000	And brought Dark Soccer and I presents
591000	593000	And I guess they were like early Christmas
593000	595000	Slash late birthday
595000	597000	Whatever the reason was
597000	599000	Those were awesome
599000	601000	Yeah, I loved it
601000	603000	So tell the listeners about what that was
603000	605000	Okay, so
605000	607000	After, and I really do blame VJHS
607000	609000	For this, after VJHS
609000	611000	After I kickstarted
611000	613000	That, or pledged to that
613000	615000	Kickstarter, I started
615000	617000	Getting into the habit of browsing Kickstarter
617000	619000	For things, and one of the things that I saw
619000	621000	There was a custom
621000	623000	Card deck for
623000	625000	There's a bunch of companies doing custom cards
625000	627000	And stuff like that, so one of the decks
627000	629000	That was on there was
629000	631000	The Grid, it's like
631000	633000	Tron themed cards, but not quite
633000	635000	You know, because they can't do it without the licensing
635000	637000	But it's
637000	639000	Tron-esque cards, you know
639000	641000	That very neon black
641000	643000	They're pretty cool looking
643000	645000	So it was a limited run
645000	647000	I think they only did about a thousand of them
647000	649000	And so I pledged to
649000	651000	Get a bunch of, well, a few of the decks
651000	653000	So I kept one, I gave one to my friend
653000	655000	I gave one to you guys
655000	657000	And
657000	659000	Yeah, so, it was cool
659000	661000	Yeah, I gotta say, I don't even want to open them
661000	663000	I'm like, I do need a deck of cards
663000	665000	For card games, but I don't want to open them
665000	667000	Because they're so awesome
667000	669000	It's like, you know, not wanting to
669000	671000	Open toys, just use them
671000	673000	I can show you a picture of what all the cards look like
673000	675000	If that'll help
675000	677000	Okay, that'll work
677000	679000	Now, despite all the fact that we give Kickstarter a lot of
679000	681000	Crap here on the show, you know, a lot of that's been me
681000	683000	Although Jamie's had her fair share in giving Kickstarter
683000	685000	Crap
685000	687000	And it's
687000	689000	Again, it's not necessarily the whole website
689000	691000	That I have a problem with
691000	693000	There's just some people on there
693000	695000	You just have to be buyer beware
695000	697000	Just like eBay
697000	699000	Not all eBay auctions are evil, but some people
699000	701000	Put up shady stuff
701000	703000	It's that thing that's being perpetuated as well
703000	705000	Like, you want to make millions?
705000	707000	Go to Kickstarter and just like
707000	709000	It's everybody's easy button answer right now
709000	711000	When things in life aren't that easy button
711000	713000	So it's like everybody's just swarming
713000	715000	It's like the gold rush
715000	717000	Everybody's just swarming on it
717000	719000	You see, that's where most of my problems lie therein
719000	721000	There's been some good Kickstarters
721000	723000	I have come this close
723000	725000	This close to donating
725000	727000	To one of the Kickstarters and I still might
727000	729000	And that would be my first Kickstarter ever
729000	731000	And that's the GamerCon one
731000	733000	I'm seriously considering supporting
733000	735000	Well, they've already hit their funding
735000	737000	I was just on Kickstarter about a few seconds ago
737000	741000	And I saw that they had hit their funding, I think
741000	743000	For that, but that's still cool
743000	745000	They can always use more funding
745000	747000	I'm kind of obligated
747000	749000	To go to GamerCon, you know
749000	751000	It's in San Francisco, I mean
751000	753000	It's right up the street
753000	755000	Yeah, but you can also go to YowieCon
755000	757000	Which is also in San Francisco
757000	759000	YowieCon is fun
759000	761000	But GamerCon is about video games
761000	763000	YowieCon is about
763000	765000	YowieCon has electronic tools
765000	767000	No, it has the electric
767000	769000	469, folks
769000	771000	This guy was selling
771000	773000	These glass tubes
773000	775000	That attach to an electric current
775000	777000	And it shoots electricity across your skin
777000	779000	And I had him turn it up all the way
779000	781000	Because I have nerve damage in my hands
781000	783000	So I didn't feel it
783000	785000	And he's like, are you alive?
785000	787000	Yes, I want one of these
787000	789000	It kind of tickles
789000	791000	Alright, so Loki, Kickstarter
791000	793000	You've kind of become a little bit like
793000	795000	You kickstart a lot of stuff
795000	797000	You have a lot of feet
797000	799000	A few things, I mean
799000	801000	I don't know, I like independent projects
801000	803000	Sometimes and I like stuff
803000	805000	I like getting things in the mail
805000	807000	I don't know
807000	809000	That's not
809000	811000	That's not why I do it
811000	813000	I don't know why that's so funny
813000	815000	But because it's episode 469
815000	817000	I like getting things in the mail
817000	819000	My mind goes to porn
819000	821000	Dildos, lube
821000	823000	I have never gotten porn, dildos, or lube
823000	825000	In the mail
825000	827000	Yet
827000	829000	I guess that does open up opportunities
829000	831000	I have
831000	833000	And I didn't even order it
833000	835000	Get return present for Loki
835000	837000	One of these days
837000	839000	The UPS delivery man is going to be like
839000	841000	Somebody just ordered you a 10 gallon bottle of lube
841000	843000	So
843000	845000	Thanks
845000	847000	No, there's actually a website called
847000	849000	AlienDildos.com
849000	851000	You're going to have to get one of the pumping mechanisms
851000	853000	And I found it through
853000	855000	A mass effect forum
855000	857000	Alright, anyways
857000	859000	I back a few projects every now and then
859000	861000	And actually I've done a few recently
861000	863000	But yeah, the second project I backed
863000	865000	Was those cards
865000	867000	Because they were pretty cool looking
867000	869000	I was like, oh sweet, Tron cards
869000	871000	Well this would be a great gift
871000	873000	That's exactly what I thought
873000	875000	I'm like, this would be a great gift
875000	877000	So I'm going to do that
877000	879000	And so that's what I did
879000	881000	I opened my cards and yeah, they're pretty awesome
881000	883000	I don't play a lot of card games
883000	885000	But when I do, I'm going to use those
885000	887000	I think you just became a gift
887000	889000	Did you hear that? I don't play a lot of card games
889000	891000	But when I do
891000	893000	No, but
893000	895000	You heard it too, right?
895000	897000	But when I do, I play them on the grid
897000	899000	No, but seriously
899000	901000	There's been some pretty cool projects on there
901000	903000	For example, Cards Against Humanity
903000	905000	Was one I wish I had gotten
905000	907000	In on because that would have been awesome
907000	909000	But they have that
909000	911000	I backed Ouya recently
911000	913000	Which we'll see what happens with that
913000	915000	I'm pretty faithful that
915000	917000	It'll come through
917000	919000	I know a lot of people are like, oh
919000	921000	It's going to be like a phantom
921000	923000	It's going to disappear like a phantom
923000	925000	Up in smoke
925000	927000	Gone
927000	929000	But yeah, there's a lot of things that I back on there
929000	931000	That's where the cards came from
931000	933000	They actually have another set coming out too
933000	935000	This 4pm studios
935000	937000	They have a Cthulhu themed set
937000	939000	That looks pretty fucking sweet
939000	941000	I'm really into what you're saying
941000	943000	Usually I wouldn't go on these tangents
943000	945000	But thanks to the closing ceremonies
945000	947000	This will be our lowest rated live episode
947000	949000	In 4 years
949000	951000	What in the actual fuck
951000	953000	Are you looking at on that computer dark
953000	955000	Sakura?
955000	957000	It's the funniest website
957000	959000	I've ever seen in my life
959000	961000	What is that? Rule 37?
961000	963000	What do they call that?
963000	965000	This is a Rule 37
965000	967000	It's a website that I actually found
967000	969000	Through a Mass Effect Tumblr
969000	971000	Of course
971000	973000	Well I have to say that this episode
973000	975000	The TTP has only been 26 minutes
975000	977000	Wait a minute
977000	979000	Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute
979000	981000	Tell us what the website is because I want to come back
981000	983000	To this whole discovery of the website
983000	985000	What is the website? I posted it in chat already
985000	987000	Could you share for the podcast listeners?
987000	989000	AlienDildos.com
989000	991000	I don't know if we should be going down this path
991000	993000	There's already an explicit tag
993000	995000	There's no stopping this train
995000	997000	Tell me in what part of Mass Effect
997000	999000	Fandom
999000	1001000	Would we require
1001000	1003000	an AlienDildos.com
1003000	1005000	You're taking this femshep
1005000	1007000	Garris thing a little too far
1007000	1009000	When you want to model
1009000	1011000	Of his wiener as a butt plug
1011000	1013000	No
1013000	1015000	Do not want
1015000	1017000	Turian butt plug is taking this obsession one step too far
1017000	1019000	There's an FAQ
1019000	1021000	For a comic that someone was doing
1021000	1023000	And someone said
1023000	1025000	What do you think Turian cock
1025000	1027000	Looks like?
1027000	1029000	And she linked to the site
1029000	1031000	And the artist
1031000	1033000	Linked to the site
1033000	1035000	Who
1035000	1037000	Who cares
1037000	1039000	Rule 37
1039000	1041000	And the internet cares
1041000	1043000	That's a true quote
1043000	1045000	If I've ever heard one
1045000	1047000	We usually
1047000	1049000	Like to start the show by talking about our gaming
1049000	1051000	Weeks and the type of video games that we've
1051000	1053000	Been playing this week
1053000	1055000	I just wanted to mention one thing since we were
1055000	1057000	Previously before the Dildo Talk
1057000	1059000	We were talking about Kickstarter
1059000	1061000	Which I would like to mention
1061000	1063000	I asked him to call in too
1063000	1065000	Maybe he'll call in later
1065000	1067000	Speaking of Kickstarter
1067000	1069000	There is a Kickstarter
1069000	1071000	That's being done by
1071000	1073000	One of our listeners
1073000	1075000	He is a part of his company
1075000	1077000	And it's for a game called Evilot
1077000	1079000	Evilot is kind of a
1079000	1081000	Dungeon
1081000	1083000	Defense game
1083000	1085000	And they've got
1085000	1087000	A pretty low goal to hit
1087000	1089000	But of course they
1089000	1091000	Need all the help that they can get
1091000	1093000	So if you guys can go maybe back
1093000	1095000	If it looks good
1095000	1097000	For $15 you get the game on every single platform
1097000	1099000	That they're releasing it on
1099000	1101000	Did they pay for that commercial?
1101000	1103000	I'm just kidding
1103000	1105000	I will support
1105000	1107000	A foodie monster
1107000	1109000	He's doing animation on
1109000	1111000	He hasn't listened in a while
1111000	1113000	What ever happened to him?
1113000	1115000	Foodie monster, where are you?
1115000	1117000	Well foodie monster
1117000	1119000	I want a Skype call in the coming weeks
1119000	1121000	If you're going to get your
1121000	1123000	Kickstarter wares out there
1123000	1125000	Evilot
1125000	1127000	They're about $3,500 of a $10,000 goal
1127000	1129000	That's not bad
1129000	1131000	Still 3 weeks to go
1131000	1133000	Still be relevant for that call within the next couple of episodes
1133000	1135000	Good job
1135000	1137000	I backed them
1137000	1139000	We're going to make a game for the Ouya
1139000	1141000	I need some games to play
1141000	1143000	On that console that may or may not disappear
1143000	1145000	Into the mist like the Phantom
1145000	1147000	Like the Phantom
1147000	1149000	Oh a link
1149000	1151000	Give a link in chat
1151000	1153000	Alrighty
1153000	1155000	Moving on, let's get into our gaming weeks
1155000	1157000	And the type of video games that we have been playing this week
1157000	1159000	Dark Soccer, start us off
1159000	1161000	I'm playing Mass Effect 2 for Becky
1161000	1163000	And I'm playing Mass Effect 3 for me
1163000	1165000	And World of Warcraft
1165000	1167000	And
1167000	1169000	I played
1169000	1171000	Droplets on my phone
1171000	1173000	It's not as good on my phone as it is on
1173000	1175000	Steam, just saying
1175000	1177000	So you went from Turian dildos to Orcish dildos
1177000	1179000	No
1179000	1181000	Ew
1181000	1183000	Everyone knows Orcs don't bathe
1183000	1185000	My bad
1185000	1187000	Alright, Loki
1187000	1189000	How about your gaming week?
1189000	1191000	I actually played some different things
1191000	1193000	Pretty much also the same stuff
1193000	1195000	Played a lot more Minecraft
1195000	1197000	Finally got to do some more co-op stuff
1197000	1199000	With my co-worker
1199000	1201000	It's still getting a little boring
1201000	1203000	I actually just purchased it on PC
1203000	1205000	Which I'm looking forward to playing around with the mods and stuff
1205000	1207000	Because my PC probably can handle that
1207000	1209000	Also
1209000	1211000	Played a bit of Call of Duty
1211000	1213000	Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3
1213000	1215000	Still fun
1215000	1217000	Looking forward to the Black Ops 2
1217000	1219000	And then the new thing
1219000	1221000	I actually played this week was Sleeping Dogs
1221000	1223000	Which is a pretty awesome game
1223000	1225000	For those who are not aware
1225000	1227000	It's what true crime Hong Kong
1227000	1229000	Was
1229000	1231000	It was going to be true crime Hong Kong
1231000	1233000	Before the IP got sold off
1233000	1235000	So now it's this brand new
1235000	1237000	Open world action game
1237000	1239000	With a lot of kung fu
1239000	1241000	And
1241000	1243000	A lot of homages to classic kung fu
1243000	1245000	Films and
1245000	1247000	Crime dramas and all that
1247000	1249000	It has that feeling of
1249000	1251000	A Hong Kong action film which is pretty sweet
1251000	1253000	The combat in it
1253000	1255000	Is pretty good
1255000	1257000	Because it's a little bit more sophisticated
1257000	1259000	Than Grand Theft Auto where
1259000	1261000	Combat is just there as a side note
1261000	1263000	Because it's mostly guns guns guns guns guns
1263000	1265000	This though
1265000	1267000	Because it does have all that Hong Kong
1267000	1269000	Influence
1269000	1271000	It's a lot of kung fu in there
1271000	1273000	So you're having to fight a ton of people
1273000	1275000	All at one time
1275000	1277000	Having to do counters and stuff like that
1277000	1279000	For me the counter system doesn't
1279000	1281000	Always work right
1281000	1283000	Because they flash red
1283000	1285000	And as long as you hit it while they're red
1285000	1287000	It should counter
1287000	1289000	But it doesn't work sometimes
1289000	1291000	It's a little annoying because I keep dying
1291000	1293000	Over and over
1293000	1295000	But that's probably because it's not button masher friendly
1295000	1297000	But the game is really cool
1297000	1299000	I know it's been getting a lot of coverage
1299000	1301000	In the blogs recently
1301000	1303000	Definitely one to check out
1303000	1305000	Especially if you're a fan of Grand Theft Auto type games
1305000	1307000	You're not getting a new Grand Theft Auto game
1307000	1309000	Until at least next year
1309000	1311000	Sometime
1311000	1313000	Saints Row
1313000	1315000	I do need to go back and play Saints Row though
1315000	1317000	Um
1317000	1319000	Did you just say fuck Saints Row and then I need to go play Saints Row
1319000	1321000	Well I need to go finish my achievements
1321000	1323000	But yeah fuck that game because
1323000	1325000	They just
1325000	1327000	Saints Row 2 was so great
1327000	1329000	Those were two similarly different phrases
1329000	1331000	That you just used
1331000	1333000	Rob wins
1333000	1335000	And I can't say that they've fucking driven it into the ground
1335000	1337000	Okay it
1337000	1339000	You know
1339000	1341000	Saints Row 2 was a great game
1341000	1343000	It was over the top
1343000	1345000	They had made it a little bit more over the top
1345000	1347000	Than the first one
1347000	1349000	And they expanded the features and stuff like that
1349000	1351000	Saints Row the third looked like they were going to do even more with that
1351000	1353000	But then they just went fucking crazy with it
1353000	1355000	And it makes no god damn sense whatsoever
1355000	1357000	It's like
1357000	1359000	If you were
1359000	1361000	Imagine if you will
1361000	1363000	With the Christopher Nolan
1363000	1365000	Batman's okay
1365000	1367000	And then all of a sudden the last movie is a fucking
1367000	1369000	Joel Schumacher Batman
1369000	1371000	That's how the fucking series is gone with Saints Row
1371000	1373000	It's just like
1373000	1375000	Okay that's kind of cool
1375000	1377000	Okay that's even cooler
1377000	1379000	What the fuck happened?
1379000	1381000	Why are these things happening?
1381000	1383000	Why is there a sky fortress flying around?
1383000	1385000	You know
1385000	1387000	It's just really weird
1387000	1389000	You have to admit Saints Row the third is really funny
1389000	1391000	It's a fun game
1391000	1393000	But they hoard out the DLC
1393000	1395000	All the DLCs sucked
1395000	1397000	The game was Batman Returns
1397000	1399000	Where it's like
1399000	1401000	Okay it's a little different
1401000	1403000	A little zany, Jim Carrey is in it, he's funny
1403000	1405000	And then the DLC is just
1405000	1407000	Batman and Robin
1407000	1409000	There they go, perfect example
1409000	1411000	And then look at what they were trying to do
1411000	1413000	They were like oh yeah we're going to do this
1413000	1415000	Enter the dominatrix thing as a stand alone game
1415000	1417000	Which right there
1417000	1419000	I don't know about that
1419000	1421000	And then they were like hey you know what
1421000	1423000	We're going to take the milking of this property even further
1423000	1425000	We're just going to incorporate that into a
1425000	1427000	Brand new Saints Row the fourth game
1427000	1429000	Or Saints Row the fourth
1429000	1431000	Oh thank you
1431000	1433000	That's going to be fantastic that you're recycling this game
1433000	1435000	We actually have an exclusive clip
1435000	1437000	From some unreleased DLC
1437000	1455000	For Saints Row the third, let's hear it
1455000	1457000	Well that sounds like a pretty cool expansion
1457000	1459000	I'm going to tell you right now
1459000	1461000	Okay if the next Batman game that came out
1461000	1463000	Was based on
1463000	1465000	Batman and Robin, I would actually probably buy it
1465000	1467000	Because
1467000	1469000	Batman and Robin should be a video game
1469000	1471000	As fucking terrible as that movie was
1471000	1473000	It's funny
1473000	1475000	No one is obviously taking this movie seriously
1475000	1477000	If you're casting Arnold Schwarzenegger
1477000	1479000	As Mr. Freeze
1479000	1481000	That doesn't make any sense whatsoever
1481000	1483000	That's like
1483000	1485000	Casting Tara Reid as a scientist
1485000	1487000	Oh wait that's been done before too
1487000	1489000	But you know
1489000	1491000	That movie also sucked, Alone in the Dark
1491000	1495000	What up G in our chat room says
1495000	1497000	Bane was much better than that Bane
1497000	1499000	That's true
1499000	1501000	But I loved the voice they gave Bane
1501000	1503000	In the movie
1503000	1505000	He sounded like Count Chocula
1505000	1507000	He sounded Belgian
1507000	1509000	Didn't Bane in the movie sound like
1509000	1511000	Count Chocula to you?
1511000	1513000	Let me remember him
1513000	1515000	That's what he sounded like to me
1515000	1517000	He sounded like Count Chocula
1517000	1519000	And I couldn't take it
1519000	1521000	Because I'm like Count Chocula just
1521000	1523000	Oh I shouldn't spoil
1523000	1525000	Alright
1525000	1527000	Well that also wasn't a very good movie
1527000	1529000	Speaking of 13 year time warps
1529000	1531000	Count Chocula is kind of an asshole
1531000	1533000	Alright
1533000	1535000	Anyway
1535000	1537000	Your gaming week
1537000	1539000	Yes my gaming week if Loki is all done with his gaming week
1539000	1541000	I actually had quite a bit of a busy gaming week
1541000	1543000	I have three games I want to talk about
1543000	1545000	Let's talk first about Pit
1545000	1547000	I'm sorry
1547000	1549000	Sorry sorry
1549000	1551000	There's one thing that is worth mentioning
1551000	1553000	The Ready Player One contest
1553000	1555000	Oh yeah alright
1555000	1557000	Fair enough I'm ready for an update
1557000	1559000	Alright so the Ready Player One contest
1559000	1561000	Remember last week the whole thing I bitched about
1561000	1563000	You know fucking
1563000	1565000	You bitch!
1565000	1567000	At the break of world record
1567000	1569000	And it is basically impossible
1569000	1571000	To break the world record of
1571000	1573000	The four games that they started off with
1573000	1575000	At least it was impossible
1575000	1577000	For
1577000	1579000	You know Black Tiger
1579000	1581000	But I was willing
1581000	1583000	To buy Black Tiger
1583000	1585000	And make the adjustments
1585000	1587000	So that it was exactly
1587000	1589000	Like the machine that had the world record
1589000	1591000	I was all ready to do that
1591000	1593000	Right before I actually purchased anything
1593000	1595000	I went and checked the update on the blog
1595000	1597000	And sure enough someone had beat the world record
1597000	1599000	On Joust on 2600
1599000	1601000	And it has been confirmed
1601000	1603000	That was going to be the easiest one to beat
1603000	1605000	That was the only accessible one
1605000	1607000	That was the contest
1607000	1609000	Really
1609000	1611000	All that other stuff was just a red herring
1611000	1613000	But it was poorly run in the first place
1613000	1615000	You keep adding games
1615000	1617000	And changing the rules
1617000	1619000	Within a couple days
1619000	1621000	It was ridiculous
1621000	1623000	But congratulations to the guy that won it
1623000	1625000	Of course it still has to be confirmed by Twin Galaxies
1625000	1627000	But it's been confirmed by
1627000	1629000	Whoever is running the contest I guess
1629000	1631000	It looks like it's legit
1631000	1633000	Was it Joust that you guys were saying takes
1633000	1635000	Like four days to meet the record?
1635000	1637000	That's the arcade version
1637000	1639000	67 hours or something like that
1639000	1641000	Okay so it certainly has been long enough
1641000	1643000	Since this news broke that they could have actually pulled it off
1643000	1645000	On the 2600 I think it was
1645000	1647000	Different scoring
1647000	1649000	But yeah console versus arcade
1649000	1651000	Alright
1651000	1653000	Thank God too I was like
1653000	1655000	Maybe I should check something before I make this purchase
1655000	1657000	Because I was like okay I'm going to buy this
1657000	1659000	I'm going to buy
1659000	1661000	My pants laughing
1661000	1663000	If he comes to the show and just dumps
1663000	1665000	A black tiger motherboard on the table
1665000	1667000	God dammit
1667000	1669000	Seriously let me put it this way
1669000	1671000	Rob if I was to buy a black tiger
1671000	1673000	Board I would be breaking the world record regardless
1673000	1675000	Of you know
1675000	1677000	It's a thing I forgot
1677000	1679000	Now it's a thing
1679000	1681000	You talked about this last week it's a thing
1681000	1683000	Exactly alright anyways I'm done
1683000	1685000	Are you sure you're done?
1685000	1687000	Oh Dark Soccer I thought of something else
1687000	1689000	No I'm very sad because Joe Kubert
1689000	1691000	What?
1691000	1693000	Joe Kubert died
1693000	1695000	And who was he?
1695000	1697000	Uh born 1926
1697000	1699000	Did a lot of DC stuff
1699000	1701000	Well that means he lived a pretty full life though
1701000	1703000	26 that's
1703000	1705000	I thought for a second there she was saying Joe Kubert
1705000	1707000	And I was like is that his first name?
1707000	1709000	I kind of thought that's what she said at first too
1709000	1711000	But then I'm looking over her shoulder
1711000	1713000	At Tumblr and I'm like no
1713000	1715000	And he did like a lot of Superman
1715000	1717000	Well I mean sorry to hear he passed
1717000	1719000	Yeah
1719000	1721000	We actually unfortunately have news about another passing
1721000	1723000	But we'll get to that a little later in the show
1723000	1725000	Because I don't want to down the show too much
1725000	1727000	Because I want to talk about my gaming week
1727000	1729000	And there's three games I want to talk about this week
1729000	1731000	First off on the iOS platforms
1731000	1733000	Pitfall which I guess is the 30th anniversary
1733000	1735000	Edition Pitfall or what have you
1735000	1737000	They really should just call this game
1737000	1739000	Temple Run 2
1739000	1741000	Because that's exactly what this game is
1741000	1743000	It is Temple Run 2
1743000	1745000	The only connection
1745000	1747000	To the original 8-bit Atari 2600
1747000	1749000	Version of Pitfall
1749000	1751000	The little opening movie you see it for 5 seconds
1751000	1753000	And then it transforms into
1753000	1755000	The new Pitfall
1755000	1757000	So wasn't there a marketplace
1757000	1759000	Or something like that out there that said
1759000	1761000	They were going to try to eliminate
1761000	1763000	Kind of these copycat games
1763000	1765000	Was that Android or something like that?
1765000	1767000	Well technically
1767000	1769000	You're not supposed to have them on iOS
1769000	1771000	But it's Atari
1771000	1773000	We're going to let them slide
1773000	1775000	Activision in this case, even better
1775000	1777000	It's just enough different than Temple Run
1777000	1779000	That it's not really a copycat
1779000	1781000	I mean you still have the sliding
1781000	1783000	To turn around, you slide up to jump
1783000	1785000	You slide down to go over the tunnel
1785000	1787000	But now you tap the screen
1787000	1789000	To whip snakes that might be standing in your path
1789000	1791000	Which the original Pitfall did have snakes
1791000	1793000	So they kind of figured out a way to
1793000	1795000	Incorporate that
1795000	1797000	Now I will say this, to the game's credit
1797000	1799000	The graphics are above and beyond
1799000	1801000	What Temple Run's got going on
1801000	1803000	Not that Temple Run's a bad looking game
1803000	1805000	But you play it so much you kind of see the same thing over and over
1805000	1807000	The cool thing about Pitfall is that the
1807000	1809000	Environments start to get varied
1809000	1811000	Like you get to a certain length in the game
1811000	1813000	And now when you get to 2500 meters or whatever
1813000	1815000	Now you start running through a cave
1815000	1817000	And it's like drastically different looking
1817000	1819000	And then I know in the box teaser
1819000	1821000	The teaser images that are out there
1821000	1823000	There's one that's like a minecart in a fire cavern type of thing
1823000	1825000	So that's kind of cool that they varied it a little bit
1825000	1827000	As well as when you start the game
1827000	1829000	It's kind of like from the side
1829000	1831000	And then like the camera rotates
1831000	1833000	To be behind you more like Temple Run
1833000	1835000	Like the way the engine works
1835000	1837000	It seems like it's capable of more
1837000	1839000	Graphically than Temple Run is
1839000	1841000	But um
1841000	1843000	If the graphics were that great
1843000	1845000	You shouldn't have frame skipping happen
1845000	1847000	Especially in a game where
1847000	1849000	You know, precision is key
1849000	1851000	And the frame skipping kind of screws it up
1851000	1853000	And here's the other thing about Pitfall
1853000	1855000	Like Temple Run, you have all these
1855000	1857000	Mini transactions that you can do
1857000	1859000	Within the game
1859000	1861000	Pay 99 cents for a token
1861000	1863000	And you can continue from where you left off
1863000	1865000	Or pay 99 cents for diamonds
1865000	1867000	And you can dress Pitfall Harry up in a bear
1867000	1869000	Costume or a pirate
1869000	1871000	Or a tooth fairy
1871000	1873000	I kid you not, you can dress him up
1873000	1875000	It's just called fairy
1875000	1877000	You can dress him up as a fairy
1877000	1879000	Can you do pretty princess or something?
1879000	1881000	I don't know because I'm not going to pay the money to do it
1881000	1883000	Now I guess technically you can
1883000	1885000	Grind the silver bars
1885000	1887000	Which are basically the version of coins or whatever
1887000	1889000	But it always leaves a
1889000	1891000	Bad taste in my mouth when you ask me
1891000	1893000	To pay for the game up front and then you
1893000	1895000	Try to shove these transactions down my throat
1895000	1897000	And I do not like
1897000	1899000	These constant pop-up messages
1899000	1901000	That are like, don't you want to spend money
1901000	1903000	To continue from this point?
1903000	1905000	Don't you want to buy a costume? No!
1905000	1907000	I don't!
1907000	1909000	But he doesn't look like a fairy yet
1909000	1911000	Don't you want to play as a fairy?
1911000	1913000	I am hating
1913000	1915000	Based on the fact that you have Grindr
1915000	1917000	Installed on your iPhone, we think you might like
1917000	1919000	This costume
1919000	1921000	But look, I don't like this whole
1921000	1923000	And I will never turn
1923000	1925000	Push notifications on for these things
1925000	1927000	Either
1927000	1929000	So that's the other thing
1929000	1931000	If I had those on, I'm sure I'd be getting messages
1931000	1933000	At two o'clock in the morning
1933000	1935000	Don't you want macaw tokens?
1935000	1937000	We miss you, don't you want to play some more?
1937000	1939000	So I kind of hate
1939000	1941000	This whole free-to-play thing
1941000	1943000	Is just, I mean, I realize
1943000	1945000	It's not really free, it's still 99 cents to get the game
1945000	1947000	It's not free
1947000	1949000	It's still paying money for it
1949000	1951000	Just wait until it goes free, if you even want to play it
1951000	1953000	Yeah, uh, Temple Run is free
1953000	1955000	It's pretty much the same game
1955000	1957000	But Pitfall has some varied environments, that's all
1957000	1959000	You gotta do it free so you can pay those microtransactions
1959000	1961000	I'm just, if I'm gonna pay the money
1961000	1963000	For those transactions, maybe we should do something
1963000	1965000	About the frame skip, can I pay 99 cents
1965000	1967000	To have a smooth running game? Thanks
1967000	1969000	Alright, meanwhile
1969000	1971000	That's enough about that, other games I played this week
1971000	1973000	So for 20 bucks at Fry's
1973000	1975000	On sale or clearance or whatever
1975000	1977000	I got Connect Disneyland Adventures
1977000	1979000	Cause, you know, this game came out last holiday season
1979000	1981000	And it's Disneyland
1981000	1983000	And I consider myself a bit of a Disney affectionato
1983000	1985000	So I wanted to check this game out
1985000	1987000	And I played this game
1987000	1989000	I played it for a good
1989000	1991000	Hour or so
1991000	1993000	And this is where I really, truly realized
1993000	1995000	That I hate the fucking Connect
1995000	1997000	I really
1997000	1999000	Like
1999000	2001000	It really is the same mistake all over again
2001000	2003000	Like what we have with the eye toy
2003000	2005000	It's miserable to control
2005000	2007000	It is an absolute miserable experience to control this game
2007000	2009000	It's like, you have to hold your hand out
2009000	2011000	To turn
2011000	2013000	You have to put your hand out this way to go forward
2013000	2015000	And then
2015000	2017000	Like, if I want to do a hug
2017000	2019000	I'm supposed to reach out
2019000	2021000	And try to hug
2021000	2023000	But then it'll think I'm dancing
2023000	2025000	Instead and like all this stuff
2025000	2027000	I'm just like, can't I just pick up the controller and play
2027000	2029000	Like, I realize the name of the game
2029000	2031000	Is Connect Disneyland Adventures
2031000	2033000	But for a bunch of cute minigames
2033000	2035000	About a place I really love
2035000	2037000	You know what, I'll pay 20 bucks for the controller experience
2037000	2039000	Can we just take the Connect part out?
2039000	2041000	No
2041000	2043000	You can't disable the Connect in this game, unfortunately
2043000	2045000	I think that's too bad
2045000	2047000	I really do think the killer app for Connect
2047000	2049000	Is, uh, dancing games
2049000	2051000	And that's pretty much it
2051000	2053000	It's really the only thing that succeeds on that
2053000	2055000	And even then
2055000	2057000	Dance Central and maybe Dance Paradise
2057000	2059000	Although that game has it's issues
2059000	2061000	Just Dance
2061000	2063000	Isn't bad either
2063000	2065000	Anyway
2065000	2067000	So I don't know, like
2067000	2069000	I also have to remember this game is made for kids
2069000	2071000	And here I am
2071000	2073000	30 and 100 years old and I'm playing the game
2073000	2075000	It doesn't matter though, I mean that's even worse
2075000	2077000	Because kids don't have patience at all
2077000	2079000	So if something's
2079000	2081000	Going wrong or it's not working they're just gonna
2081000	2083000	Kick the TV or throw
2083000	2085000	Throw the Connect through the window
2085000	2087000	Frisbee in our chat
2087000	2089000	Room at live.vognetwork.com says
2089000	2091000	You have to walk around Disneyland like a zombie
2091000	2093000	With your arms out, totally true
2093000	2095000	That is, you have to kinda like walk
2095000	2097000	You can't really do both hands out at the same time
2097000	2099000	Because then the game doesn't understand if you're trying
2099000	2101000	To go left or right, but it's just silly
2101000	2103000	Black Wolf
2103000	2105000	From the Bobby Black Wolf show
2105000	2107000	Which tapes before us at VOG Network says
2107000	2109000	The killer apps for Connect are all the
2109000	2111000	Non-games like hospital apps
2111000	2113000	No, obviously those are killer apps for the
2113000	2115000	PC because the PC
2115000	2117000	The PC can handle the bandwidth
2117000	2119000	And they can basically, I think it's like double
2119000	2121000	The data you get from the Connect versus
2121000	2123000	The Xbox 360 which has to
2123000	2125000	Share the bus between all the USB ports
2125000	2127000	On the actual system so it's
2127000	2129000	Limited to what you can do
2129000	2131000	So yes, all the
2131000	2133000	Hacks are, you know, where it's at
2133000	2135000	But they're gonna try to sell you
2135000	2137000	On Connect 2, they're gonna say it's better than the last time
2137000	2139000	But
2139000	2141000	Just like they told me it was better than the vision camera
2141000	2143000	And that was better than the eye toy
2143000	2145000	It's like ehhhh
2145000	2147000	Here's the tragic thing about Connect Disneyland
2147000	2149000	Adventures is that I actually
2149000	2151000	You know, despite the fact that the game is made for
2151000	2153000	Kids, as somebody who really loves Disneyland
2153000	2155000	I really did kinda like just walking
2155000	2157000	Around the virtual park, it's a pretty decent
2157000	2159000	Recreation of the park, I mean you can't
2159000	2161000	Go in every store or whatever, but
2161000	2163000	I mean they have the frickin' corn dog cart
2163000	2165000	Represented in the game
2165000	2167000	This way for corn dogs
2167000	2169000	And it's kinda fun to see the characters that are out there
2169000	2171000	And I like that they have the churro ride
2171000	2173000	They have churro carts
2173000	2175000	But you can't really do anything
2175000	2177000	There's lots of characters to find
2177000	2179000	They have a
2179000	2181000	World of Warcraft-esque, believe it or not
2181000	2183000	Questing type thing
2183000	2185000	Like you find Mickey and Mickey will be like
2185000	2187000	Hello, find Goofy's autograph
2187000	2189000	It's interesting
2189000	2191000	But it's ruined by the Connect
2191000	2193000	It needs the people movers and that'd be awesome
2193000	2195000	Because in the world of
2195000	2197000	Connect Disneyland Adventures, people aren't
2197000	2199000	Dumb and can't fall off those things
2199000	2201000	Or to have the gondolas again
2201000	2203000	It would be even better if you could have like archival
2203000	2205000	Videos of Disney or Disney ride
2205000	2207000	Videos or something that I know Disney would never
2207000	2209000	Allow to be put in there, but I just think it
2209000	2211000	Really enhanced the experience
2211000	2213000	Like, I think this idea should be
2213000	2215000	Revisited without the Connect at some point
2215000	2217000	Seriously, I really
2217000	2219000	Wanted to like this game
2219000	2221000	But I don't
2221000	2223000	And that makes me very sad
2223000	2225000	I definitely agree that the killer apps for the
2225000	2227000	Connect are hospital apps
2227000	2229000	Oh, I'm putting this scalpel forward
2229000	2231000	Crap!
2231000	2233000	Thanks Bobby
2233000	2235000	That's the other thing that would be interesting
2235000	2237000	Because you know how we always have these apps that are like
2237000	2239000	Okay, look, I got this game to work with Connect
2239000	2241000	I want to see the opposite, I want to see Connect games
2241000	2243000	Working with a controller
2243000	2245000	Okay, rdgsinge
2245000	2247000	In our chat room has a good comment too
2247000	2249000	The move of Eden was good, right?
2249000	2251000	No!
2251000	2253000	Not with Connect as the controller
2253000	2255000	With the controller it was great
2255000	2257000	The Connect thing was interesting to play once
2257000	2259000	Kamehameha!
2259000	2261000	Kamehameha!
2261000	2263000	Yeah, but it wasn't super responsive
2263000	2265000	Apparently the PS3 version is pretty good with the move
2265000	2267000	Because the move
2267000	2269000	Sadly enough
2269000	2271000	Isn't it tragic that the move actually ends up being a pretty good peripheral
2271000	2273000	With no one curve?
2273000	2275000	The move is actually a really good peripheral
2275000	2277000	It seriously is an excellent peripheral
2277000	2279000	And it works
2279000	2281000	But the thing is, no one fucking cares
2281000	2283000	It's like Sports Champions
2283000	2285000	It worked pretty much the entire time
2285000	2287000	Yeah, you had to calibrate it a couple times
2287000	2289000	But that was super quick
2289000	2291000	And you still have to fucking calibrate shit in the Connect
2291000	2293000	But on Connect you have Lady Gaga
2293000	2295000	So everybody's like
2295000	2297000	Oh, Connect!
2297000	2299000	Yep
2299000	2301000	Anyhow, one more game I want to talk about tonight
2301000	2303000	Sound Shapes
2303000	2305000	Which is uh
2305000	2307000	Sorry, that's the spouse
2307000	2309000	Did that go over the air?
2309000	2311000	You just got an extra life?
2311000	2313000	Apparently for plugging Sound Shapes I got a 1up
2313000	2315000	Oh, Dan is evil, my husband's evil
2315000	2317000	One of our yogurt places has Nutella frozen yogurt
2317000	2319000	That sounds great
2319000	2321000	Now put your phone on vibrate
2321000	2323000	Alright
2323000	2325000	469
2325000	2327000	Alien dildo
2327000	2329000	Alright, Sound Shapes
2329000	2331000	On the Vita and the PS3
2331000	2333000	Which I love that you buy it on one
2333000	2335000	And you get it on both
2335000	2337000	How it should be
2337000	2339000	I didn't love that the cloud syncing isn't really working
2339000	2341000	Or at least it wasn't early in the week when I played it
2341000	2343000	But supposedly
2343000	2345000	You're going to be able to have one save file across the two
2345000	2347000	But whatever, I was at least able to play the game
2347000	2349000	Is it a music game?
2349000	2351000	Kinda
2351000	2353000	But it's not a music game where
2353000	2355000	A note is falling and you do something
2355000	2357000	When the note hits the line
2357000	2359000	That's the neat thing about it
2359000	2361000	I mean, don't get me wrong, I love those kinds of games
2361000	2363000	Clearly, however
2363000	2365000	I'm ready for something kinda different
2365000	2367000	And the cool thing about Sound Shapes is, it's kinda different
2367000	2369000	I think it's like a music game like Pot upon was a music game
2369000	2371000	Not even that
2371000	2373000	It's just that the things that you collect
2373000	2375000	The music is all in the stage design
2375000	2377000	That's what it really boils down to
2377000	2379000	The stage design is where the music
2379000	2381000	It's not necessarily you
2381000	2383000	Interacting with the music
2383000	2385000	It's the environments interacting with the music
2385000	2387000	Which is what's kinda cool
2387000	2389000	It's almost more Child of Eden and Res like
2389000	2391000	In that regard
2391000	2393000	Since those games were brought up
2393000	2395000	I would say those would be a better comparison actually
2395000	2397000	But this is more like a Little Big Planet style game
2397000	2399000	And the game that this has the most in common with
2399000	2401000	Not just Little Big Planet
2401000	2403000	It's Super Meat Boy
2403000	2405000	In a way
2405000	2407000	Because it's that whole idea of
2407000	2409000	You can die very easy
2409000	2411000	But you just start from the last checkpoint
2411000	2413000	And try to get over these very difficult parts
2413000	2415000	Over and over and over again
2415000	2417000	There are stages in the game that are just
2417000	2419000	Really cool
2419000	2421000	Like the Beck stage
2421000	2423000	Beck has three stages
2423000	2425000	That first Beck stage is like the equivalent
2425000	2427000	Of Shinen in Luminous
2427000	2429000	Like really
2429000	2431000	It's like the defining moment
2431000	2433000	When you're playing the game
2433000	2435000	Because the song kinda goes
2435000	2437000	It's going along and then the lyrics
2437000	2439000	One part of the lyrics goes
2439000	2441000	Move a little
2441000	2443000	Turn a little
2443000	2445000	And like while the lyrics are doing that
2445000	2447000	The little platforms
2447000	2449000	It moves a little
2449000	2451000	Then it turns a little
2451000	2453000	Then it breaks apart a little
2453000	2455000	And then when it goes hurt a little
2455000	2457000	It turns red which is the bad thing color
2457000	2459000	Which will kill you if you're still standing on it
2459000	2461000	And like when I was playing that I was like
2461000	2463000	That's so cool
2463000	2465000	And even Alan was watching over my shoulder
2465000	2467000	And like just the little
2467000	2469000	He'll just sing this ahhh
2469000	2471000	Thing in the background
2471000	2473000	That you can use that say ahhh
2473000	2475000	On them and just like playing that stage
2475000	2477000	Was just so cool
2477000	2479000	Like it was neat
2479000	2481000	And that's how it kind of interacts with the music
2481000	2483000	It's very much the environment
2483000	2485000	Otherwise it's kind of a platformer
2485000	2487000	And it plays a lot like Meat Boy or Little Big Planet
2487000	2489000	Obviously because of the online element
2489000	2491000	Is a huge part of it too
2491000	2493000	All these stages you can get online
2493000	2495000	That people have made
2495000	2497000	All their own levels and so forth
2497000	2499000	Is that very Little Big Planet element
2499000	2501000	Just like Little Big Planet
2501000	2503000	90% of them suck
2503000	2505000	But it's kind of neat to see what people
2505000	2507000	Come up with. I think the online mode
2507000	2509000	Could have been implemented a little better
2509000	2511000	It is early on
2511000	2513000	I think the interface doesn't work too well
2513000	2515000	For the online mode but
2515000	2517000	At least you can kind of track what your friends
2517000	2519000	Are doing and that gives me hope that there's
2519000	2521000	Something a little better
2521000	2523000	In there somewhere
2523000	2525000	But overall it's a game, shit it's a great deal
2525000	2527000	You get the game on two platforms
2527000	2529000	It's only 12 bucks
2529000	2531000	It's kind of limited
2531000	2533000	By the number of stages that are actually in the game
2533000	2535000	I think there's about maybe
2535000	2537000	15 stages in the game
2537000	2539000	But it's only a $15 game
2539000	2541000	And you do have the online stuff which is virtually unlimited
2541000	2543000	I think it's pretty good
2543000	2545000	I had a good time with it
2545000	2547000	So
2547000	2549000	This is sounding like Sound Shapes is a music game
2549000	2551000	Like New Super Mario Brothers is a music game
2551000	2553000	Lots of colorful interactivity
2553000	2555000	Admittedly with Sound Shapes
2555000	2557000	More things are happening as a result
2557000	2559000	But with New Super Mario Brothers
2559000	2561000	One of the cutest parts of the game was the fact that
2561000	2563000	The backgrounds and everything else would
2563000	2565000	Have very distinctive cues
2565000	2567000	That go along with the music and then things like the Yoshi
2567000	2569000	That add the new rhythm and what not
2569000	2571000	It was a really
2571000	2573000	It was one of the best aspects of that reboot
2573000	2575000	Actually, yes, I didn't even think of that
2575000	2577000	But you're right
2577000	2579000	The music in New Super Mario Brothers
2579000	2581000	Was really under appreciated
2581000	2583000	Yeah, there is kind of an element to that with it
2583000	2585000	You know that goes all the way back to the original
2585000	2587000	Super Mario Brothers
2587000	2589000	I'm sorry, not the original, the original Super Mario
2589000	2591000	World on the Super Nintendo
2591000	2593000	Because whenever you got Yoshi
2593000	2595000	You would have that little drum beat
2595000	2597000	Oh yeah, that aspect of it, yeah
2597000	2599000	I'm thinking of like the normal
2599000	2601000	The hills will be dancing along the background
2601000	2603000	Oh yeah, I love the way the little Koopas
2603000	2605000	Yeah, the way the little Koopas go
2605000	2607000	The little dance is so adorable
2607000	2609000	New Super Mario Brothers was a great game
2609000	2611000	And I can't wait for two
2611000	2613000	Loki might have a word to say about that
2613000	2615000	Alright
2615000	2617000	Coming up on this episode of Orange Laundry
2617000	2619000	Alright
2619000	2621000	I was reading Kickstarter
2621000	2623000	Not paying attention at all
2623000	2625000	Again, alright, so I do recommend Sound Shapes
2625000	2627000	You don't even necessarily have to like music games
2627000	2629000	Because it's not really a music game
2629000	2631000	It's a platformer that incorporates music elements
2631000	2633000	And I think that's a really good way
2633000	2635000	You know, it's that New Super Mario Brothers
2635000	2637000	Wii cranked up to 11
2637000	2639000	In a way, so
2639000	2641000	That's a review I write for VOG Network later this week
2641000	2643000	So I'm gonna steal that
2643000	2645000	I need a few points for that, I think
2645000	2647000	VX JasonXV, contribute to this report
2647000	2649000	I'll see what I can do, alright
2649000	2651000	Moving on, speaking of Jason
2651000	2653000	I'll let you go next with your gaming week
2653000	2655000	What types of video games do you play this week?
2655000	2657000	Oh boy, most of my week was lost
2657000	2659000	By preparing for this trip
2659000	2661000	But I will say that when I was on the train
2661000	2663000	I was trying to play things that
2663000	2665000	I didn't think would be particularly susceptible
2665000	2667000	To interference by the train
2667000	2669000	Rocking back and forth, yeah I was wrong
2669000	2671000	Limbo, Cave Story
2671000	2673000	Braid, and other various
2673000	2675000	Puzzle, platforming, adventure kind of things
2675000	2677000	I thought that I could
2677000	2679000	Manage, but with as violent
2679000	2681000	As the train gets, especially in like Nevada
2681000	2683000	My hands were completely off the keyboard
2683000	2685000	Flying all over the place
2685000	2687000	Couple DS games
2687000	2689000	A friend of mine let me borrow
2689000	2691000	Kid Icarus Uprising, and so
2691000	2693000	Now my hands are completely cramped
2693000	2695000	Because it's just, like the
2695000	2697000	Original DS that just doesn't fit
2697000	2699000	My hands just don't fit that system very well
2699000	2701000	I've been trying some of the alternative
2701000	2703000	Control configurations, but then you
2703000	2705000	Lose all precision and the game just
2705000	2707000	Gets bad. I wonder if it's gonna feel better
2707000	2709000	On the XL that's coming out very soon
2709000	2711000	I've been considering hitting the Best Buy
2711000	2713000	To see if they have Kid Icarus
2713000	2715000	On demo and see if that alleviates
2715000	2717000	The problems, but I think that
2717000	2719000	I think the size
2719000	2721000	Of the DS is wrong, but the bulk
2721000	2723000	The weight of the XL will be too much
2723000	2725000	And it'll just cause the same thing to happen
2725000	2727000	I don't know
2727000	2729000	I finally got
2729000	2731000	Starcraft working on my computer again
2731000	2733000	Since Mountain Lion kind of broke a couple things
2733000	2735000	My Diablo's still busted, but my Starcraft 2
2735000	2737000	Is working again, that's
2737000	2739000	Pretty much the week in a nutshell
2739000	2741000	Let me go over to Ryan, check in
2741000	2743000	How her gaming week was
2743000	2745000	It's okay, you don't play Diablo anyway
2745000	2747000	You're about to make up for it
2747000	2749000	Yes, I've been playing a lot of
2749000	2751000	Diablo, it's kind of my social hour
2751000	2753000	I also picked up
2753000	2755000	Kingdom Hearts, the 3DS version
2755000	2757000	I just barely started it
2757000	2759000	Otherwise, just kind of
2759000	2761000	The find me and the
2761000	2763000	Puzzle stuff, because I just picked up my 3DS
2763000	2765000	This last week
2765000	2767000	Which is that amazingly awesome purple color
2767000	2769000	I'm sorry, there's a part of me that wants to go sell
2769000	2771000	Like, I'm having such a Shane moment
2771000	2773000	I really hope he's listening
2773000	2775000	Because I am having a total Shane moment
2775000	2777000	Because the minute I saw that DS, I'm like
2777000	2779000	I'm about ready to take my DS and sell it in
2779000	2781000	And get that purple one
2781000	2783000	And the XL is on its way out
2783000	2785000	If I'm going to get a new 3DS
2785000	2787000	I need to get that one
2787000	2789000	That's the prettiest color handheld
2789000	2791000	I think I've ever seen
2791000	2793000	For real
2793000	2795000	It was one of those things that I told myself
2795000	2797000	If the purple one came stateside
2797000	2799000	That was going to be the one that I got
2799000	2801000	Kind of held off for the color that I liked
2801000	2803000	And of course, Kingdom Hearts came out the next week
2803000	2805000	So, yeah
2805000	2807000	Good opportunity
2807000	2809000	I know you haven't played a lot of Kingdom Hearts yet
2809000	2811000	But any early impressions
2811000	2813000	From what you have played?
2813000	2815000	It's a lot to take in
2815000	2817000	In the very beginning
2817000	2819000	I'm still struggling with all the new
2819000	2821000	All the new things that you can do with it
2821000	2823000	And by the way
2823000	2825000	I have a supporter in our chat room
2825000	2827000	JV Mon says the purple 3DS is beautiful
2827000	2829000	I'm right with you, Rob
2829000	2831000	Thank you
2831000	2833000	At least it's not just me
2833000	2835000	Kingdom Hearts
2835000	2837000	Kingdom Hearts
2837000	2839000	I saw this hilarious thing floating around Facebook
2839000	2841000	Which was literally a 40 page Google doc
2841000	2843000	To try and explain the plot
2843000	2845000	With pictures and arrows
2845000	2847000	Is that the type of thing we have going on in the intro?
2847000	2849000	Sort of
2849000	2851000	It has its own little tutorials
2851000	2853000	For each little thing
2853000	2855000	It's just so much to take in so quickly
2855000	2857000	It's
2857000	2859000	And this is a kids series
2859000	2861000	This is like a soap opera for kids
2861000	2863000	And adults
2863000	2865000	A lot of adults playing this game
2865000	2867000	I think the first one was kind of marketed at kids
2867000	2869000	Probably, and it's Disney
2869000	2871000	Who else would the target market be?
2871000	2873000	The official Disney parks continue
2873000	2875000	To ignore Kingdom Hearts
2875000	2877000	Makes me so sad
2877000	2879000	Anything else for your gaming week, Ry?
2879000	2881000	Not really
2881000	2883000	Alright, well you throw something at me
2883000	2885000	If you want the mic to say something a little later
2885000	2887000	In the meantime, I'm going to plug
2887000	2889000	Some things around the interwebs
2889000	2891000	To register participation

2915000	2917000	On that website
2917000	2919000	If I'm able to get my work done tonight
2919000	2921000	We're going to have a little more music
2921000	2923000	And rotation. I'm adding a little bit more to the
2923000	2925000	Music rotation for this week
2925000	2927000	For those folks that are actually listening
2927000	2929000	And playing games
2929000	2931000	To the VoG network
2931000	2933000	I posted something in the forums about how you can play
2933000	2935000	Beat Hazard
2935000	2937000	You can actually use internet radio on Beat Hazard
2937000	2939000	Well you can load VoG Network as one of the custom
2939000	2941000	Stations and play Beat Hazard
2941000	2943000	To the music on VoG
2943000	2945000	Or, if you're so daring, you can play to an
2945000	2947000	Episode of Orange Lounge Radio or Pod Culture
2947000	2949000	Or Girls Gone Wow or whatever
2949000	2951000	During the week. It's kind of fun
2951000	2953000	A little weird, but fun
2953000	2955000	Alright, let's get into some gaming
2955000	2957000	News now that we're an hour into the show
2957000	2959000	Loki. Sounds good. Alright
2959000	2961000	So let's talk a little bit about
2961000	2963000	What could possibly be the worst thing that
2963000	2965000	Happened with gaming ever
2965000	2967000	Windows 8
2967000	2969000	At least according to a lot of people
2969000	2971000	But, something else that they're adding
2971000	2973000	To some of the games that you may waste time
2973000	2975000	With in Windows
2975000	2977000	They're adding achievements
2977000	2979000	To the games you know
2979000	2981000	And love from back from
2981000	2983000	Windows 3.1 I can get 20
2983000	2985000	Points for beating Solitaire
2985000	2987000	Yes Yes You can now get
2987000	2989000	Achievements for Minesweeper, Solitaire, and
2989000	2991000	Mahjong But if you
2991000	2993000	Want more deck backs, you're gonna have to spend
2993000	2995000	Microsoft Space Bucks
2995000	2997000	In order to unlock
2997000	2999000	Watch. Fucking watch
2999000	3001000	I'm
3001000	3003000	Not upgrading
3003000	3005000	Do you want mine hints for Minesweeper?
3005000	3007000	Here's what I wanna know
3007000	3009000	Do you want new faces that will explode
3009000	3011000	When you click on a mine? Where is that
3011000	3013000	Go-kart game or that
3013000	3015000	Was it the bumper card game
3015000	3017000	From XP? Why do
3017000	3019000	I not see that listed there?
3019000	3021000	I forgot about that game, damn
3021000	3023000	That game is awesome
3023000	3025000	XP, that was 95 plus
3025000	3027000	Oh yeah, oh yeah
3027000	3029000	What about that? And
3029000	3031000	While we're at it, you know, what about
3031000	3033000	Didn't they have a bunch of Windows games like
3033000	3035000	There was Chips Challenge? Where's Chips
3035000	3037000	Challenge? I want some more Chips Challenge
3037000	3039000	That was a fun game
3039000	3041000	Maybe that will come in Windows 8
3041000	3043000	Service Pack 1 But like, they also
3043000	3045000	Had all those, like, was it the
3045000	3047000	All the different Solitaire games and Mahjong
3047000	3049000	Games and stuff like that that came with that pack
3049000	3051000	It was just like, eh So how are you feeling
3051000	3053000	About Windows 8, Loki? Are you kind of in the
3053000	3055000	It stinks camp, but you're an achievement
3055000	3057000	Whore? No, I'm not
3057000	3059000	Not to that You used to be
3059000	3061000	I used to be, I'm a recovery achievement whore
3063000	3065000	Well, admitting you have a
3065000	3067000	Problem is the first step No, I honestly
3067000	3069000	Windows 8 does not look
3069000	3071000	Good at all to me
3071000	3073000	I mean, there's nothing so far that's told me that I need
3073000	3075000	It's gonna be for me, it's kind of like one of those
3075000	3077000	Intermediate, you know
3077000	3079000	Versions, like, I didn't jump on Vista
3079000	3081000	And I went to 7, so I'm thinking that
3081000	3083000	Windows 9 or whatever the next one's gonna be
3083000	3085000	It'll probably be a little bit better for me
3085000	3087000	Um, yeah, actually that's kind of the way it's been
3087000	3089000	You know, I've always skipped, you know
3089000	3091000	A generation, I didn't do
3091000	3093000	I didn't do 95 to 98
3093000	3095000	Skipped ME, went to XP
3095000	3097000	Skipped Vista
3097000	3099000	Went to 7, so, yeah, this'll be
3099000	3101000	This'll be the operating system I skip
3101000	3103000	Windows 8
3103000	3105000	Is interesting
3105000	3107000	That's kind of the reaction I have to it, but
3107000	3109000	Interesting is also the word I use to describe
3109000	3111000	The commercial for Boo Boo Honey Child
3111000	3113000	Whatever that show is on TLC
3113000	3115000	So, um, I don't know, take from that what you will
3115000	3117000	It would be cool, Windows 8
3117000	3119000	Would be a better operating system
3119000	3121000	If touch screen monitors
3121000	3123000	Were more mainstream
3123000	3125000	Like, if my laptop
3125000	3127000	Had a touch screen monitor on it
3127000	3129000	Then yeah, Windows 8 would be pretty awesome
3129000	3131000	Because you can do all the touch screen stuff, but
3131000	3133000	I just don't think it's
3133000	3135000	Necessary right now
3135000	3137000	Alright, before we get to the next story, let's go to some comments
3137000	3139000	From our chat room at
3139000	3141000	Vognetwork.com
3141000	3143000	DarkSakura, why didn't you say this in a microphone?
3143000	3145000	She says, I do believe
3145000	3147000	There is Kingdom Hearts stuff at Disney C
3147000	3149000	So, correcting what I said earlier
3149000	3151000	About why does Disney ignore the
3151000	3153000	Kingdom Hearts
3153000	3155000	Because this is America!
3155000	3157000	America! America!
3157000	3159000	We won the most gold, deal with it
3159000	3161000	And I really wasn't saying it in reply to you
3161000	3163000	I was saying it to somebody in chat
3163000	3165000	Yeah, Rob
3165000	3167000	Let's see, and uh
3167000	3169000	Excuse me, AlphaKnanogram is correcting me
3169000	3171000	Whatever I said, it's Honey Boo Boo
3171000	3173000	Here comes Honey Boo Boo, that's not my pad
3173000	3175000	I'm so sorry
3175000	3177000	Porkchop says, who the fuck plays
3177000	3179000	Minesweeper anymore?
3179000	3181000	Um, you know
3181000	3183000	True story, I work in an adult
3183000	3185000	Training environment, I teach
3185000	3187000	You know, adults in a corporate
3187000	3189000	World basically, like how to do their jobs
3189000	3191000	And if we ever get people coming through the door
3191000	3193000	That aren't very comfortable
3193000	3195000	With using a computer, because sometimes you get
3195000	3197000	Some like, retired folks
3197000	3199000	That want to take like, kind of a new job
3199000	3201000	Or a new career
3201000	3203000	And they might not be as seasoned with computers
3203000	3205000	Or whatever, we will actually assign them to go
3205000	3207000	Home and play solitaire
3207000	3209000	To get better use with a mouse
3209000	3211000	And kind of get that coordination, it's a very
3211000	3213000	Good way to
3213000	3215000	You know, kind of get used to that
3215000	3217000	Whole hand-eye coordination, which
3217000	3219000	Many of us take for granted, we all grew up
3219000	3221000	On that stuff, but for people that didn't
3221000	3223000	Grow up on it and kind of have to learn it
3223000	3225000	Solitaire is actually a great way to learn it
3225000	3227000	Just, you know, think about it that way
3227000	3229000	And then when they come back and tell you, okay, I played
3229000	3231000	Solitaire with my card deck, how's that supposed to
3231000	3233000	Teach me computers, is this some sort of
3233000	3235000	Crazy karate kid thing where I go
3235000	3237000	Wax a car and I'm supposed to learn
3237000	3239000	Kung-Fu, is that how it's gonna work?
3239000	3241000	If I ever had a student say, it's a crazy
3241000	3243000	Karate kid thing, I'd just give them
3243000	3245000	An A. Alright
3245000	3247000	Let's be real
3247000	3249000	Alright, uh, move
3249000	3251000	What else do I want to say, uh, oh
3251000	3253000	Good chat, yes, thank you, the other comment
3253000	3255000	From GameGuru in our chatroom says
3255000	3257000	I see you are playing Solitaire
3257000	3259000	Would you like special Clippy themed backs
3259000	3261000	For the game?
3261000	3263000	Go to hell
3263000	3265000	This is an honest question because I don't know how to
3265000	3267000	Do this, is there any way to turn off
3267000	3269000	Beacons from other people, because
3269000	3271000	Let's be honest, I have someone that's on my friends list
3271000	3273000	Probably one of our listeners that has a beacon
3273000	3275000	That says, hey, I want friends to play
3275000	3277000	Minecraft, cool
3277000	3279000	I know that already, I'm already playing
3279000	3281000	Minecraft when I get your stupid notification
3281000	3283000	Yeah, I never realized those things stay on like
3283000	3285000	Forever, because I have- How do I turn that off?
3285000	3287000	I think I had one set for like, Mass Effect 3
3287000	3289000	Or something, I don't know, it's just like, everybody's like
3289000	3291000	Gets a little beep
3291000	3293000	I remember when I learned about how terrible
3293000	3295000	The notification system is, that I shut
3295000	3297000	Mine off, in order to
3297000	3299000	Not get them from your friends, I
3299000	3301000	Don't think that's possible
3301000	3303000	De-friend them, maybe
3303000	3305000	No, don't do that
3305000	3307000	Why don't you just send them a message that says, fuck you, you fucking
3307000	3309000	Fuck, turn your beak off
3309000	3311000	I'm already playing it, why don't you come play it?
3311000	3313000	You wanna play apparently
3313000	3315000	Alright, let's uh
3315000	3317000	Move on with some more news
3317000	3319000	And that would be me, talking about Amazon
3319000	3321000	Game Studios
3321000	3323000	Yeah, you know, Amazon, the website
3323000	3325000	That used to sell books
3325000	3327000	Sorry, I love Rageinator's comment
3327000	3329000	What was that? If Windows 8 is interesting, then by that definition
3329000	3331000	So is a lobotomy and colostomy bag
3331000	3335000	Fascinating
3335000	3337000	Anyhow
3337000	3339000	Also interesting, Amazon
3339000	3341000	Game Studios
3341000	3343000	Uh, yeah, Amazon of course, you know
3343000	3345000	They used to sell books and only books
3345000	3347000	And now they sell books and
3347000	3349000	Groceries
3349000	3351000	And probably sex toys
3351000	3353000	For all I know, probably Alien Dildos
3353000	3355000	Probably has a shop front on Amazon.com
3355000	3357000	I'm not sure, but
3357000	3359000	You can't buy vibrators on Amazon
3359000	3361000	For the listeners here
3361000	3363000	I was looking up
3363000	3365000	Vibrators on Amazon
3365000	3367000	Think of an excuse, quick
3367000	3369000	Mass Effect 3
3369000	3371000	I was looking up Mass Effect
3371000	3373000	For the record, I know this because
3373000	3375000	When I was a massage therapist, I was looking up
3375000	3377000	Electronic heat packs for necks
3377000	3379000	And it came to a list of personal
3379000	3381000	Vibration assistants
3381000	3383000	You want happy ending?
3383000	3385000	No
3385000	3387000	No
3387000	3389000	No
3389000	3391000	Yay, happy
3391000	3393000	Alright, so Amazon
3393000	3395000	They've sold books, they've sold vibrators
3395000	3397000	And now they sell games
3397000	3399000	But I don't mean, like obviously Amazon sold games
3399000	3401000	Already and even on the phones and so forth
3401000	3403000	Now they're making them too, Amazon
3403000	3405000	Game Studios
3405000	3407000	The first game that they have launched is
3407000	3409000	Living Classics
3409000	3411000	I guess it's a hidden object game
3411000	3413000	But they're calling it a moving object game
3413000	3415000	Alright, guess what, it's a Facebook
3415000	3417000	Game
3417000	3419000	Yeah, looks amazing, here's the trailer
3419000	3421000	We can look at for Living Classics here
3421000	3423000	The launch trailer
3423000	3425000	Oh, you can find
3425000	3427000	Moving objects
3427000	3429000	Oh
3429000	3431000	That looks like a waste of time
3433000	3435000	Perfect for Facebook
3435000	3437000	By the way, Amazon
3437000	3439000	Is hiring and
3439000	3441000	Alright, good luck with that Amazon
3441000	3443000	Let's just hope you make some games that I want to play
3443000	3445000	Out of curiosity, I went ahead and looked up
3445000	3447000	Electronic heat packs
3447000	3449000	On Amazon
3449000	3451000	And they have the weirdest shit
3451000	3453000	There's no vibrators, but there's like screws
3453000	3455000	The Sims
3455000	3457000	NASCAR 2002
3457000	3459000	The Sims?
3459000	3461000	NASCAR Thunder 2002
3461000	3463000	How the fuck does that have anything to do with electronic heat packs?
3463000	3465000	There was some kind of bullet casing
3465000	3467000	Or something in there too
3467000	3469000	And vibrating in it
3469000	3471000	Whatever
3471000	3473000	Let's move on with some more new Star Sakura
3473000	3475000	I was looking at vibrating heating pads
3475000	3477000	Oh, well there you go, vibrating
3477000	3479000	They're
3479000	3481000	Really good to loosen up someone's neck
3481000	3483000	Before you work on them
3483000	3485000	Or loosen up someone's
3485000	3487000	Never mind
3487000	3489000	469
3491000	3493000	You're all children
3495000	3497000	Yeah, speaking of ten years ago
3497000	3499000	Well, how about
3499000	3501000	Some Silent Hill news which has nothing to do with
3501000	3503000	Vibrations and everything to do
3503000	3505000	With a dead nurse rape
3509000	3511000	Okay
3511000	3513000	Well, it's true
3513000	3515000	Red Pyramid
3515000	3517000	Anyway
3517000	3519000	As we all know, Silent Hill
3519000	3521000	HD Collection is shit
3521000	3523000	Because it was built from unfinished code
3523000	3525000	End of story
3525000	3527000	Well, there's going to be a patch out that's only available on PS3
3527000	3529000	So, uh
3529000	3531000	People who got it on Xbox 360
3531000	3533000	You screwed, Konami don't care
3533000	3535000	Boohoo, go cry a river
3535000	3537000	Build a bridge and jump off it
3537000	3539000	What's that?
3539000	3541000	But I was reading something that
3541000	3543000	As long as you have your receipt, you're able to send it back to
3543000	3545000	Konami and they will send you
3545000	3547000	A new version of the disc
3547000	3549000	Okay, but Silent Hill HD Collection
3549000	3551000	Came out in what, March?
3551000	3553000	Who still has their receipt?
3553000	3555000	You've got to be one of those anal retentive people
3555000	3557000	That actually went and bought a receipt scanner
3557000	3559000	So that way you can scan
3559000	3561000	Your different receipts in here
3561000	3563000	So what if you buy it now
3563000	3565000	And then show them a receipt
3565000	3567000	And then you have them send you a free game on top of that
3567000	3569000	Well, let me read
3569000	3571000	From the official news source
3571000	3573000	Facebook
3573000	3575000	And Konami's page
3575000	3577000	Attention Silent Hill fans
3577000	3579000	If you purchase Silent Hill HD Collection
3579000	3581000	For the Xbox 360 new and from a
3581000	3583000	Recognized retailer
3583000	3585000	Oh, so that's how they're going to get around it
3585000	3587000	A recognized retailer
3587000	3589000	Oh, we don't know about this GameStop shit
3589000	3591000	And still have the original receipt
3591000	3593000	Please send the receipt to Konami
3593000	3595000	Customer service for verification
3595000	3597000	Further details, it's only valid for
3597000	3599000	Silent Hill HD Collection
3599000	3601000	Xbox 360 version games purchased
3601000	3603000	On or before August 8th
3603000	3605000	On or before August 8th, Loki
3605000	3607000	All requests must be made in
3607000	3609000	Writing and submitted on or before
3609000	3611000	October 7th and it is subject to
3611000	3613000	Availability
3613000	3615000	Well they're screwed because no one knows how to write anymore
3615000	3617000	Can't we just comment on the Facebook post
3617000	3619000	But it does say note the patch for Silent Hill
3619000	3621000	Downpour for both Xbox
3621000	3623000	360 and Playstation 3
3623000	3625000	Is currently in development
3625000	3627000	And scheduled for a release at a later date
3627000	3629000	How about this, why didn't they just finish the damn
3629000	3631000	Version
3631000	3633000	How about you just make it right the first time
3633000	3635000	I'm glad I didn't buy it
3635000	3637000	I still have Silent Hill 3 the good version
3637000	3639000	And that's all I care about
3639000	3641000	JVMON in chat says I keep all
3641000	3643000	My receipts, really?
3643000	3645000	Ragingator says I have receipts dating back
3645000	3647000	To 2002 and Stan says
3647000	3649000	I keep my game receipts for some reason
3649000	3651000	Wow, I'm just
3651000	3653000	Actually, Dan and I used to save all of our receipts
3653000	3655000	For the electronics that we bought, we still have the receipt
3655000	3657000	For my Wacom
3657000	3659000	I understand, for big huge purchases I get that
3659000	3661000	Like when I bought my old TV
3661000	3663000	At Costco, hell yeah I kept the receipt
3663000	3665000	Because Costco has an awesome return
3665000	3667000	Policy
3667000	3669000	Yeah, I mean they used to
3669000	3671000	Knowing things like that, hell yeah
3671000	3673000	I'll keep the receipt, but
3673000	3675000	I don't really ever save them for games
3675000	3677000	Maybe I ought to start
3677000	3679000	Dan still has his box for his DS that has a post-it note on it
3679000	3681000	That says, this is Dan's DS, don't buy it
3681000	3683000	I also love this
3683000	3685000	When we talk about recognized retailers
3685000	3687000	Monty Boggs in our chat room
3687000	3689000	At live.vognetwork.com says
3689000	3691000	Kmart? The fuck is Kmart denied?
3691000	3693000	Hey, I bought a Sonic shirt there
3693000	3695000	That's about it
3695000	3697000	I bought, I bought
3697000	3699000	A Super Mario Brothers shirt
3699000	3701000	There, I was very happy
3701000	3703000	Jvmon in our chat says
3703000	3705000	I still have the receipts for those Dunkin Donuts
3705000	3707000	K-Cups I got you, lol
3707000	3709000	I drank one
3709000	3711000	Yeah, don't take this the wrong way
3711000	3713000	Because the Dunkin Donuts K-Cups were great
3713000	3715000	But they're like half gone now
3715000	3717000	So even if you had the receipt
3717000	3719000	The store's not gonna take them back
3719000	3721000	I done drunk them
3721000	3723000	And they were terrible
3723000	3725000	Give me my money back
3725000	3727000	No, they were good, they were good
3727000	3729000	A little sugar, a little creamer
3729000	3731000	Apparently you don't know how this works
3731000	3733000	Grab coffee
3733000	3735000	Alright, let's move on with some more news
3735000	3737000	Hey, agreed porkchop
3737000	3739000	Please don't fuck up the Zone of the Enders HD collection
3739000	3741000	Cross his fingers
3741000	3743000	Co-sign to that
3743000	3745000	Exactly, it's like, oh hey, yeah, we don't wanna patch this
3745000	3747000	But buy our new Zone of the Enders
3747000	3749000	Oh, and by the way
3749000	3751000	We're still selling this
3751000	3753000	In case you do want a broken game
3753000	3755000	So anyways
3755000	3757000	There was some rumored
3757000	3759000	Next-gen
3759000	3761000	Kinect images
3761000	3763000	Released on Twitter
3763000	3765000	By a guy that goes by the name
3765000	3767000	SuperDAE
3767000	3769000	Who also apparently has no sense of humor
3769000	3771000	Because I made a comment on his little post
3771000	3773000	And he said, don't be an idiot
3773000	3775000	Bastard
3775000	3777000	Don't be an idiot
3777000	3779000	I just made the comment because you know
3779000	3781000	It's got the little neon character
3781000	3783000	The depth map on there
3783000	3785000	And it kind of resembles, you know
3785000	3787000	The image from Just Dance
3787000	3789000	And I made the comment and I'm like
3789000	3791000	Well, that's not an image from the new Kinect
3791000	3793000	That's just from the new version of Just Dance
3793000	3795000	Apparently he has no sense of humor
3795000	3797000	Because he didn't even say haha if I were funny
3797000	3799000	He said, don't be an idiot
3799000	3801000	Well good, I'm not gonna be an idiot
3801000	3803000	Like someone that would try to buy his
3803000	3805000	Development kit for the Durango
3805000	3807000	That he just now put on eBay
3807000	3811000	That's up to $15,000
3811000	3813000	And basically
3813000	3815000	You're taking his word for it
3815000	3817000	That this is actually an Xbox Durango
3817000	3819000	Development kit
3819000	3821000	And it looks like a PC
3821000	3823000	Because that's what the development kits look like
3823000	3825000	And there's really nothing that guarantees you
3825000	3827000	Anyway that
3827000	3829000	This is gonna be a development kit
3829000	3831000	Other than the fact that I think some other developers
3831000	3833000	Have a picture of it and they're like
3833000	3835000	Yeah, that looks like a development kit
3835000	3837000	But who knows
3837000	3839000	But yes, so we'll see if this is legit or not
3839000	3841000	Because if it is the real deal
3841000	3843000	Then Microsoft will probably pull it off of eBay
3843000	3845000	But as of right now
3845000	3847000	It is
3847000	3849000	Oh, it was ended early because the item was sold
3849000	3851000	For $20,000
3851000	3853000	Well $20,000 was the last bid
3853000	3855000	But it says the listing was ended by the seller
3855000	3857000	Because the item was sold
3857000	3859000	Interesting, so like ended early or whatever?
3859000	3861000	Yeah
3861000	3863000	Surprised you could do that with bids on it
3863000	3865000	Yeah, I didn't think you could do that, that's interesting
3865000	3867000	Now the question is
3867000	3869000	Who bought it, Gizmodo?
3869000	3871000	We'll see
3871000	3873000	Alright
3873000	3875000	Meanwhile
3875000	3877000	Be careful
3877000	3879000	If you are a Blizzard
3879000	3881000	Or battle.net customer
3881000	3883000	Oh yeah, that
3883000	3885000	Because guess what, they got hacked
3885000	3887000	You know the old saying, hackers gonna hack
3887000	3889000	But to be fair, battle.net was
3889000	3891000	Pretty upfront about what happened
3891000	3893000	Because I think we've learned from history
3893000	3895000	Don't try to hide this shit from your users
3895000	3897000	They're smarter than that
3897000	3899000	So Mike Morhaime, the CEO himself
3899000	3901000	Wrote a little letter that says
3901000	3903000	You know what, even when you are in the business
3903000	3905000	Of fun, not every week ends up
3905000	3907000	Being fun
3907000	3909000	And they found out that there was an unauthorized and illegal access
3909000	3911000	Into the network at Blizzard
3911000	3913000	And they did confirm
3913000	3915000	No financial information such as credit cards
3915000	3917000	Billing addresses or real names were compromised
3917000	3919000	Thank God
3919000	3921000	I was surprised they went this far
3921000	3923000	They said some data was illegally accessed
3923000	3925000	Including a list of
3925000	3927000	Email addresses for global battle.net
3927000	3929000	Users outside of China
3929000	3931000	For players on North American servers
3931000	3933000	Which generally includes players from
3933000	3935000	North America, Latin America, Australia, New Zealand
3935000	3937000	And Southeast Asia
3937000	3939000	So instead of saying it was everybody, they said
3939000	3941000	They targeted these specific regions
3941000	3943000	They got the answers to
3943000	3945000	The personal security questions
3945000	3947000	And information relating to
3947000	3949000	Mobile and dial-in authenticators
3949000	3951000	That's pretty bad that they got
3951000	3953000	The personal security question answers
3953000	3955000	Because if you use those
3955000	3957000	Security question and answers on other
3957000	3959000	Sites
3959000	3961000	It's just like having a password anyway
3961000	3963000	It is
3963000	3965000	So that's pretty bad
3965000	3967000	Now they do say
3967000	3969000	Cryptographically scrambled versions
3969000	3971000	Of battle.net passwords, not the actual
3971000	3973000	Passwords were taken
3973000	3975000	But they do think with brute force
3975000	3977000	You could decode one at a time passwords
3977000	3979000	But who cares if you've got the
3979000	3981000	Answers to your secret questions
3981000	3983000	You don't even need to do that
3983000	3985000	So in the coming days they are going to prompt
3985000	3987000	Folks to change the secret questions and answers
3987000	3989000	Through an automated process
3989000	3991000	Also the mobile authenticator users will have to
3991000	3993000	Update the software and so on
3993000	3995000	So highly recommend at this point
3995000	3997000	If you play World of Warcraft
3997000	3999000	If you play Diablo
3999000	4001000	If you play Starcraft, any of those games
4001000	4003000	They're all on battle.net
4003000	4005000	You need to change your password
4005000	4007000	On battle.net right away and you can do that
4007000	4009000	At battle.net
4009000	4011000	Slash account slash management
4011000	4013000	Slash setting, you know what there's a link right there
4013000	4015000	At battle.net
4015000	4017000	I had forgotten to do mine so I just did it
4017000	4019000	But can you, other than changing your passwords
4019000	4021000	Because that's not going to matter if they have your secret questions
4021000	4023000	Can you change your secret questions?
4023000	4025000	Not yet
4025000	4027000	So then what the fuck's the point
4027000	4029000	We have an authenticator
4029000	4031000	I don't think the secret question alone
4031000	4033000	Will get them into the account
4033000	4035000	Especially if you've got an authenticator
4035000	4037000	Attached to it
4037000	4039000	I believe the secret question can only be used
4039000	4041000	To generate a reset request
4041000	4043000	Which still goes to your email
4043000	4045000	So this is the other important thing
4045000	4047000	Your email password
4047000	4049000	Needs to be unique
4049000	4051000	This is, I mean, in a perfect world
4051000	4053000	Every password is unique
4053000	4055000	But I understand not everybody can realistically
4055000	4057000	Do that with all the websites we sign up for
4057000	4059000	So your email password
4059000	4061000	Needs to be unique
4061000	4063000	This is just internet security 101
4063000	4065000	If you do not have a unique
4065000	4067000	Email password you are setting yourself
4067000	4069000	Up for trouble because think about it
4069000	4071000	Somebody gets your battle.net password here
4071000	4073000	Or they got your Playstation password before
4073000	4075000	Your Xbox password or whatever
4075000	4077000	They're going to use it to get in your email
4077000	4079000	Once they get in your email, you're fucked
4079000	4081000	Because all those reset requests
4081000	4083000	Everything goes back to your email
4083000	4085000	The guy who got hacked through the whole
4085000	4087000	iCloud reset or whatever this week
4087000	4089000	For the record, when you do change your password
4089000	4091000	It also does send you an email
4091000	4093000	That says if you didn't make the change
4093000	4095000	Click the link so that you can recover your account
4095000	4097000	Well his hacking thing was a little different
4097000	4099000	That was just security flaws with whole social
4099000	4101000	Networking and stuff like that
4101000	4103000	Basically people
4103000	4105000	Called up, added a fake credit card
4105000	4107000	To an Amazon account and then
4107000	4109000	Called back up using that
4109000	4111000	New credit card as
4111000	4113000	Authentication for other information
4113000	4115000	Porkchop in our
4115000	4117000	Chatroom says, anyone see that guy Francis
4117000	4119000	Rage about the hacks on YouTube
4119000	4121000	No I didn't, but I love
4121000	4123000	I love internet rage
4123000	4125000	He tried to eat his authenticator
4125000	4127000	Oh that's old
4127000	4129000	That was about
4129000	4131000	Diablo 3
4131000	4133000	He did a new one
4133000	4135000	Because he's a persona
4135000	4137000	It's just a persona
4137000	4139000	It's all for hits
4139000	4141000	It's not as funny when it's fake
4141000	4143000	You know what's fucking hilarious is that
4143000	4145000	Twilight girl
4145000	4147000	That's the stuff I live for
4147000	4149000	On YouTube
4149000	4151000	Why would you cheat on him?
4151000	4153000	Why?
4153000	4155000	Really?
4155000	4157000	Oh yeah, Brittany
4157000	4159000	Really? You've never seen
4159000	4161000	The crying chick over Twilight?
4161000	4163000	No because I have a life
4163000	4165000	Tigerclaw, can you find me a link please?
4165000	4167000	I need to show Jamie this
4167000	4169000	Please find me the crying
4169000	4171000	The girl who's losing her shit over Kristen Stewart
4171000	4173000	I usually have better stuff
4173000	4175000	You know the best thing is
4175000	4177000	Oh she quit acting, when did she
4177000	4179000	Start?
4179000	4181000	Well Jamie if you wish
4181000	4183000	To take us back on track then by all means
4183000	4185000	Give us another news story
4185000	4187000	Sure as fuck ain't about no talent bitch
4187000	4189000	You know what
4189000	4191000	I accidentally closed my story
4191000	4193000	Oh yeah here we go
4193000	4195000	How about
4195000	4197000	Diablo
4197000	4199000	Um, it was funny
4199000	4201000	I had a friend in Alabama who played a lot of Diablo
4201000	4203000	Except with a thick southern accent
4203000	4205000	So it was Diablo
4205000	4207000	Blow
4207000	4209000	So anyway
4209000	4211000	Diablo
4211000	4213000	Occasionally
4213000	4215000	La la la la la
4215000	4217000	I don't need to know that
4217000	4219000	Well
4219000	4221000	How about some
4221000	4223000	Changes from Blizzard
4223000	4225000	There's gonna be a new patch
4225000	4227000	1.0.4
4227000	4229000	That will be out the fourth week
4229000	4231000	Of August
4231000	4233000	They like co-op and they want more people to do it
4233000	4235000	So this is so that you can play more
4235000	4237000	Co-op
4237000	4239000	They are
4239000	4241000	Trying to make things a little bit more attractive
4241000	4243000	So they're gonna be removing the
4243000	4245000	Averaging of magic find and gold
4245000	4247000	Find in multiplayer
4247000	4249000	So that you will benefit from full magic find
4249000	4251000	Independent of other players
4251000	4253000	Okay wait
4253000	4255000	I gotta go
4255000	4257000	Let's let Jamie finish and then I'll go to Ry for reaction
4257000	4259000	Well they added it in
4259000	4261000	They added the averaging in so that it didn't
4261000	4263000	Involve people stacking adventure stats
4263000	4265000	To detriment the party
4265000	4267000	But I guess no one likes that
4267000	4269000	I don't know I never did it
4269000	4271000	Usually anytime someone joined my game I quit
4271000	4273000	The last
4273000	4275000	Four times I played someone joined my game
4275000	4277000	I quit
4277000	4279000	Alright let me go to the resident
4279000	4281000	Real fan girl to check in on patch news
4281000	4283000	So that's why you said it
4283000	4285000	So that people have to ask
4285000	4287000	I did
4287000	4289000	They still joined my game
4289000	4291000	Really? Yes
4291000	4293000	Of course this was before any patching had been done
4293000	4295000	Gotcha
4295000	4297000	On the whole magic find gold find
4297000	4299000	My shit is my own
4299000	4301000	I build up my gold find
4301000	4303000	I build up my magic find
4303000	4305000	That shit is mine
4305000	4307000	It should not matter what yours is
4307000	4309000	If it's me
4309000	4311000	Then it just makes it worse for me
4311000	4313000	So you know get out of my game
4315000	4317000	Well
4317000	4319000	And this is why I'm still level 22
4319000	4321000	When she has 260's
4321000	4323000	There's more
4323000	4325000	But wait there's more
4325000	4327000	Weapon damage is also
4327000	4329000	Going to be retooled
4329000	4331000	So basically
4331000	4333000	It's
4333000	4335000	I'm just going to read the quote
4335000	4337000	That I like to make to our item
4337000	4339000	Game addresses the difference between an item having
4339000	4341000	A chance of being good versus knowing
4341000	4343000	The item isn't going to be good before
4343000	4345000	You can even identify it
4345000	4347000	So they're basically
4347000	4349000	Trying to
4349000	4351000	Have a raw damage level between
4351000	4353000	61 and 62 weapons
4353000	4355000	So that it can
4355000	4357000	Hit the top of 63 I think
4357000	4359000	However they explained it
4359000	4361000	I have no idea because like I said I didn't play that much
4361000	4363000	And then
4363000	4365000	Enraged timers are being removed
4365000	4367000	From champion and rare monster packs
4367000	4369000	They will still be on bosses
4369000	4371000	But they will
4371000	4373000	Not be
4373000	4375000	Basically they don't want to have you have to do a
4375000	4377000	DPS check
4377000	4379000	What?
4379000	4381000	Hey
4381000	4383000	Ryaz do you know what that's getting at?
4383000	4385000	No idea because all I know is enraged timers and wow
4385000	4387000	So inferno is where
4387000	4389000	They brought in enraged timers
4389000	4391000	That if
4391000	4393000	You don't beat an enemy
4393000	4395000	A stack of enemies within a certain amount of time
4395000	4397000	You'll basically start taking like poison
4397000	4399000	Damage you'll be standing there and your life
4399000	4401000	Will just drain away
4401000	4403000	So instead of
4403000	4405000	Trying to figure out
4405000	4407000	Your strategy on how you're going to beat that group
4407000	4409000	If you take too long it's just
4409000	4411000	Going to kill you
4411000	4413000	Wow
4413000	4415000	That's stupid
4415000	4417000	Another thing too is that
4417000	4419000	Repair costs are going to be on high
4419000	4421000	And items are going to be decreased by 25%
4421000	4423000	And
4423000	4425000	A bunch of other changes
4425000	4427000	That are going to come out later
4427000	4429000	It's on the development blog
4429000	4431000	Diablo 3 patch 1.04
4431000	4433000	Seal of approval by Ry
4433000	4435000	And sorry
4435000	4437000	Still no PVP
4437000	4439000	Maybe I'll play again
4439000	4441000	It was free why not
4441000	4443000	I signed the blood pact
4443000	4445000	We're going to get into release dates
4445000	4447000	But before we do
4447000	4449000	Let's do a culture lesson
4449000	4451000	On him and saying that she's sorry
4451000	4453000	Like that makes it okay
4453000	4457000	I feel like everybody needs to back off okay
4457000	4459000	This is none of your business
4459000	4461000	This is none of anybody's business
4461000	4463000	But her releasing that statement
4463000	4465000	It's like
4465000	4467000	It's like saying
4467000	4469000	Hello world come on in
4469000	4471000	It's like saying it doesn't matter
4471000	4473000	It's okay
4473000	4475000	Oh I don't understand how she could do this
4475000	4477000	Let me fast forward a little bit
4477000	4479000	Because I want to see if there's
4479000	4481000	More breakdown
4481000	4483000	I love him
4483000	4485000	I love him I'm so sorry okay
4485000	4487000	If you loved him that much
4487000	4489000	You wouldn't have done it
4489000	4491000	If you cared about him that much you wouldn't have done it
4491000	4493000	And if you wanted people to back off
4493000	4495000	And not be involved then you wouldn't have posted
4495000	4497000	That statement but
4497000	4499000	You see the thing is you were stupid enough
4499000	4501000	To get photographed doing it okay
4501000	4503000	Don't be so stupid
4503000	4505000	I can't help it
4505000	4507000	But that accent's awesome
4507000	4509000	There's like a level of sophistication
4509000	4511000	I was going in between
4511000	4513000	Going that's a pretty cool accent
4513000	4515000	And then going but she's so
4515000	4517000	Stupid I want to point this out
4517000	4519000	She's very much
4519000	4521000	A fan of this person so I mean
4521000	4523000	But her accent is awesome
4523000	4525000	This is when fandom goes sour
4525000	4527000	This is 2.5 million
4527000	4529000	Views on YouTube
4529000	4531000	And you just added to it Rob what the hell
4531000	4533000	And by the way bless you tiger
4533000	4535000	For finding this for us
4535000	4537000	I can always count on you 2.5 million
4537000	4539000	Views on YouTube
4539000	4541000	Do you know how many people listen to this show
4541000	4543000	Far less
4545000	4547000	But my favorite is
4547000	4549000	My favorite is the related
4549000	4551000	Videos on the side such as
4551000	4553000	Tom Cruise liked my nail polish
4553000	4555000	Oh it's her too
4555000	4557000	She's been to McDonald's for breakfast
4557000	4559000	There's a stage at the top and there's going to be a band playing
4559000	4561000	But we don't know who
4561000	4563000	I want to get to Tom Cruise
4563000	4565000	Where is it
4567000	4569000	Library day
4569000	4571000	Ok Breaking Dawn Part 2 trailer
4571000	4573000	Reaction I've seen this before it's so
4573000	4575000	Amazing this video is like
4577000	4579000	Where she's crying
4579000	4581000	Through the whole thing
4581000	4583000	I don't think we know the truth
4583000	4585000	Maybe we can convince the Volturi to listen

4601000	4603000	Anyone watching the trailer for Breaking Dawn

4639000	4641000	He went on a work trip so he's in another
4641000	4643000	City right now and he's probably asleep
4643000	4645000	Because he was up for like 27 hours straight
4645000	4647000	He said he was gonna try and listen on his phone
4647000	4649000	Tonight but he's gotta be asleep

4829000	4831000	Congratulations
4831000	4833000	Actually this did happen is that I helped her pick out a flavor of breath mints

4887000	4889000	I know this is a game many of you at home
4889000	4891000	Would be losing your shit over like the Twilight Girl
4891000	4893000	Hatsune Miku Project
4895000	4897000	Sadly she wasn't joking
4897000	4899000	That from Sega coming out on August 30th
4899000	4901000	What?
4901000	4903000	Alright
4903000	4905000	That's it for Japanese release dates
4905000	4907000	Let's go to UK release dates
4907000	4909000	On the 13th of August we have Iron Brigade on the PC
4909000	4911000	I was just trying to make it sound more authentic
4911000	4913000	15th of August
4913000	4915000	We have Dust
4915000	4917000	An Elysian Tall
4917000	4919000	Is what it says
4919000	4921000	An Elysian Tall
4921000	4923000	God do you know what it says Tall?
4923000	4925000	I'm like what the crap
4925000	4927000	They need to fix their typefaces
4927000	4929000	And on the 17th of August we have
4929000	4931000	New Super Mario Brothers 2
4931000	4933000	On the 3DS
4933000	4935000	Now available at the retail in the U
4937000	4939000	And that's it for the UK release dates?
4939000	4941000	Yeah
4941000	4943000	Alright let's do a couple more news stories
4943000	4945000	And then the classic game of the week
4945000	4947000	Cause we need something this week to keep the show classy
4947000	4949000	Loki
4949000	4951000	Alright so Valve discovered that one of the
4951000	4953000	Custom made weapons
4953000	4955000	For
4955000	4957000	Dota 2 which surprised me
4957000	4959000	Cause I didn't realize Dota 2 was out already
4959000	4961000	But apparently it is
4961000	4963000	And apparently someone copied
4963000	4965000	A mace that's from
4965000	4967000	The MMO Aeon
4967000	4969000	And
4969000	4971000	Just so you know I don't think Dota 2 is officially out
4971000	4973000	I mean Chatroom correct me if I'm wrong
4973000	4975000	I think it's just one of those betas like everybody's in
4975000	4977000	Oh
4977000	4979000	I think that's gonna work out
4979000	4981000	Anyways so
4981000	4983000	Apparently they discovered this
4983000	4985000	You know this
4985000	4987000	Weapon in there and of course they removed
4987000	4989000	The item and issued a warning
4989000	4991000	To the players that
4991000	4993000	You know this kind of crap is not gonna be tolerated
4993000	4995000	Not only did they do that they also
4995000	4997000	Removed the maces from everybody's inventory
4997000	4999000	They replaced it with a new item
4999000	5001000	And they also banned
5001000	5003000	The um
5003000	5005000	You know banned the person that made
5005000	5007000	The actual weapon
5007000	5009000	And stripped his account
5009000	5011000	From all the proceeds
5011000	5013000	From the sale so apparently there's real
5013000	5015000	There's real money transactions going along
5015000	5017000	With these weapons I think it's kind of like the hats
5017000	5019000	And Team Fortress and all that stuff yeah
5019000	5021000	And of course
5021000	5023000	Reminding everybody that you know you must respect
5023000	5025000	IP of other companies and
5025000	5027000	Encouraging their community to report
5027000	5029000	Infringement this is how the fucking shit should
5029000	5031000	Go down for anything on Apple's
5031000	5033000	Marketplace when they discover hey
5033000	5035000	This is ripping off some shit they should well of course
5035000	5037000	I think that's the whole problem is they don't know
5037000	5039000	Burn it in ten thousand fires
5039000	5041000	Basically you know they they don't have enough
5041000	5043000	People saying you know there's
5043000	5045000	I guess not enough people looking at stuff
5045000	5047000	That's on their marketplace maybe that's the problem
5047000	5049000	Because they do I know ban people when stuff's
5049000	5051000	Discovered but
5051000	5053000	And thank you chatters GameGuru confirming
5053000	5055000	It's not out it's still in beta and
5055000	5057000	Photoshop says it's been a beta for ages now
5057000	5059000	So basically it's like Gmail
5059000	5061000	Like Gmail was in beta for what five years?
5063000	5065000	Alright
5065000	5067000	Okay
5067000	5069000	Alright it's just a new layer of beta
5069000	5071000	Something else has been
5071000	5073000	Sitting dormant for years and years
5073000	5075000	This is crazy oops
5075000	5077000	I didn't mean to like have that autoplay but there you go
5077000	5079000	The sounds you hear in the
5079000	5081000	Background the sounds of the NBA
5081000	5083000	Jam triple X
5083000	5085000	Prototype is what they're calling it around the internet
5085000	5087000	That doesn't mean NGA
5087000	5089000	NGA
5089000	5091000	NBA Jam
5091000	5093000	Acronym fail with boobies okay
5093000	5095000	That's not what they mean by triple X here but it's actually
5095000	5097000	The original cartridge got shipped
5097000	5099000	To this website NintendoPlayer.com
5099000	5101000	Where they like to discover these prototypes
5101000	5103000	And whatever and this particular
5103000	5105000	You know
5105000	5107000	Board got sent to them that was an
5107000	5109000	NBA Jam work in progress
5109000	5111000	And it has Jam written over one little
5111000	5113000	Chip there and then XXX over
5113000	5115000	The other chips so I don't think
5115000	5117000	It was like meant to like have that name triple
5117000	5119000	X but it's kind of funny that it does because
5119000	5121000	Basically all it is it's the
5121000	5123000	Same NBA Jam that was on the Super
5123000	5125000	Nintendo but it has
5125000	5127000	Some R rated outtakes
5127000	5129000	That are inserted in the game instead
5129000	5131000	Here's an example this little YouTube
5131000	5133000	I'm going to play right here
5137000	5139000	He's cooking up
5139000	5141000	Yes he just said he's
5141000	5143000	Fucking up
5145000	5147000	Get that shit out of here
5147000	5149000	No fucking way
5149000	5151000	He's on fucking fire
5151000	5153000	So lol the F word is all over
5153000	5155000	The game basically right
5155000	5157000	Well some folks obviously are questioning
5157000	5159000	Its authenticity including the guy
5159000	5161000	Who did the original voice overs himself
5161000	5163000	Who basically said oh wow
5163000	5165000	That's pretty crazy
5165000	5167000	Somebody sounds just like me out there
5167000	5169000	Doing these acts on the internet
5169000	5171000	But it appears this website
5171000	5173000	Actually released they say
5173000	5175000	Download right here you can actually download the ROM
5175000	5177000	And try it for yourself so I don't think
5177000	5179000	It's just the YouTube you can actually check this out
5179000	5181000	So they did dump the ROM and you can check this out
5181000	5183000	And I don't know if you would just be able to
5183000	5185000	Insert in your own clips or whatever
5185000	5187000	I think you could ROM hack that
5187000	5189000	And then you can burn the ROM chips
5189000	5191000	Onto the cartridge
5191000	5193000	Yeah but I think it's also plausible you know
5193000	5195000	When you're in the sound booth doing recording
5195000	5197000	And this was even said on some website somewhere
5197000	5199000	Some forum post I got linked
5199000	5201000	And I apologize I don't have it in front of me
5201000	5203000	But it totally made sense
5203000	5205000	If you're doing voice overs for hours and hours
5205000	5207000	Of these lines you're gonna do some funny ones
5207000	5209000	You're gonna have some zany outtakes
5209000	5211000	You're gonna have some moments of stress relief
5211000	5213000	Where you just go how many times do you need me to say this
5213000	5215000	He's on fucking fire you know
5215000	5217000	And then so yeah there's probably a programmer
5217000	5219000	That thought it would be funny
5219000	5221000	That thought it would be funny to put those in the game
5221000	5223000	But put it under lock and key so that nobody ever would get it
5223000	5225000	Hot coffee
5225000	5227000	Have you
5227000	5229000	Lock and key but still in the game
5229000	5231000	I remember a video that I saw
5231000	5233000	I don't know quite a couple years ago about
5233000	5235000	Basically outtakes of Casey Kasem's top 50
5235000	5237000	Or top 100 whatever he used to do
5237000	5239000	That he would be recording bombs for radio stations
5239000	5241000	It's like the home of the best
5241000	5243000	Radio in Illinois
5243000	5245000	And that's the cut of the take and then
5245000	5247000	How do I fucking know they're the best
5247000	5249000	And similar similar similar situations
5249000	5251000	Like that I mean
5251000	5253000	I was able to for somebody to
5253000	5255000	Have a similar voice plus effects sound the same
5255000	5257000	Back to the future release
5257000	5259000	In the last two years
5259000	5261000	Well there's also the outtake of
5261000	5263000	Oh god I can't remember his name who was Elmer Fudd
5263000	5265000	Or Porky Pig sorry
5265000	5267000	It said
5267000	5269000	Son of a gun you thought I was gonna say son of a bitch didn't you
5269000	5271000	And I'm really sure it's Christopher Walken
5271000	5273000	Doing all those playthroughs of different games
5273000	5275000	I'm really sure it's him you know
5275000	5277000	Watching the playthroughs for that
5277000	5279000	Or reading you know
5279000	5281000	What things are and all that stuff
5281000	5283000	Bless you internet
5283000	5309000	We're up to our long distance dedication
5309000	5313000	But he was most certainly a part of let's go start again
5313000	5315000	From coming out of the record
5315000	5317000	Play the record okay
5317000	5319000	Please
5321000	5325000	See when you come out of those up tempo god damn numbers man
5325000	5327000	It's impossible to make those transitions
5327000	5329000	And then you gotta go into somebody dying
5329000	5331000	You know they do this to me all the time
5331000	5333000	I don't know what the hell they do it for
5333000	5335000	But god damn it if we can't come out of a slow record
5335000	5337000	I don't understand it
5337000	5341000	Okay I want a god damn concerted effort to come out of a record
5341000	5343000	That isn't a fucking up tempo record
5343000	5345000	Every time I do a god damn deaf dedication
5345000	5351000	Now make it and I also want to know what happened to the pictures I was supposed to see this week
5351000	5353000	We'll do it live
5353000	5355000	Essentially so
5355000	5357000	Those things can happen y'all
5357000	5363000	No I'm not saying this announcer guy lost it on Casey Kasem or Bill O'Reilly levels
5363000	5365000	But you know
5365000	5369000	His show would be even better if he did it that way
5369000	5371000	Transformers
5371000	5373000	He was the voice of several transformers
5373000	5377000	You're in a confined booth for god knows how many hours
5377000	5379000	You don't think moods start to change
5379000	5381000	Go a little off script
5381000	5387000	Anyhow I don't know I mean the fact that there actually is a ROM of it out there
5387000	5389000	Makes it a lot more believable than just the video
5389000	5394000	Granted a lot of work but why would somebody do that much work?
5394000	5396000	Just to put the F word
5396000	5400000	Especially in a website that's dedicated to this kind of crap anyways
5400000	5403000	I don't think they'd go make something up
5403000	5406000	Maybe if it was April 1st or something like that
5406000	5417000	It's like stock photo sites and how they're stock photo of the most absurd imaginable situations
5417000	5419000	What was the meme?
5419000	5425000	Naked in front of a refrigerator getting a salad or something completely ridiculous like that
5425000	5427000	What?
5427000	5432000	You basically go for absurd stock photo pictures
5432000	5438000	And the people that have to take these pictures come up with the most ridiculous scenes ever
5438000	5442000	And so there is a whole series of censored naked people eating a salad
5442000	5446000	Are you tossing the salad?
5446000	5449000	No that's another site Rob
5449000	5451000	Kotaku will run a...
5451000	5453000	Kotaku will run anything
5453000	5457000	I understand this but I'm just saying they run a feature every week
5457000	5460000	It's about stock footage of people playing games
5460000	5462000	And it's just like weird shit
5462000	5467000	There is the one where this emo chick is playing this game
5467000	5470000	Laying off of a couch somehow
5470000	5472000	And her friend has a hookah next to her
5472000	5476000	And it's just like a non-lit hookah smoking it
5476000	5481000	It's like why would you need stock footage for that?
5481000	5483000	Hipster gaming
5483000	5485000	You want to get high and play some sound shapes
5485000	5491000	More like whatever sinks your battleship
5491000	5495000	Let's go back to a time when games were so much simpler and pure
5495000	5497000	Artist!
5497000	5499000	10 years ago right Rob?
5499000	5503000	Going back to the classic game of the week
5503000	5507000	A nice G-rated experience for everybody right DarkSakura?
5507000	5510000	Who's going to dip into the vault right now and find a game that she thinks
5510000	5513000	Hey you little shit I mean sucker
5513000	5515000	You should play this video game right now
5515000	5521000	If you're into shirtless bestiality you want this game
5521000	5524000	And what game could you ever be talking about DarkSakura?
5524000	5528000	Altered Beast
5528000	5530000	Which I really don't think I've ever done
5530000	5535000	Rise from your grave
5535000	5537000	There we go we got to have it
5537000	5539000	In Japan it was called Juloki
5539000	5542000	Which is Beast King's Chronicle
5542000	5545000	Came out in 1988 by Sega
5545000	5548000	And it's a go around beat shit up game
5548000	5550000	It's set in ancient Greece
5550000	5552000	And it's a centurion who is resurrected by Zeus
5552000	5554000	To rescue Athena
5554000	5556000	Like Zeus ever cared about his kids
5556000	5560000	And so he is able to turn into different beasts
5560000	5562000	When you get this little power up sphere thing
5562000	5566000	He just turns into big dude and then turns into animal man
5566000	5571000	It came out on several video game consoles and computers at home
5571000	5574000	It was a pack-in game for the Mega Drive
5574000	5580000	And one of the designers for this was Makoto Uchida
5580000	5584000	Who was the creator of Golden Axe
5584000	5588000	So stylistically you can see things in between the two games
5588000	5591000	So anyway the centurion is dead
5591000	5593000	So basically you're playing a zombie
5593000	5597000	And you have to beat some dude named Nef
5597000	5599000	Well a demon god named Nef
5599000	5604000	And so you can become different types of aminals
5604000	5609000	When you get to hell or Disks I should say
5609000	5613000	You face Nef who becomes a huge rhinoceros guy
5613000	5616000	And then a blue bird comes out of the ground and turns into Athena
5616000	5618000	So it's very acid trippy too
5618000	5623000	It is side scrolling and it has been on damn near everything
5623000	5626000	So the orbs that you get through the game
5626000	5631000	Will make you bigger and bad-asser with huge muscular thighs and abs
5631000	5640000	And you turn into a werewolf, a weredragon, a werebear, a weretiger, or the golden werewolf
5640000	5646000	There's other different beasts in the Famicom version and in the Gameboy Advance version
5646000	5650000	And sometimes you get lightning power
5650000	5661000	At any rate you also have some very weird unicorn creatures in one of the levels
5661000	5664000	That just sort of tries to headbutt you to death
5664000	5667000	The dry queen unicorns, they were my favorite
5667000	5668000	The dry queen unicorns
5668000	5672000	It's like I would always laugh my ass off seeing them
5672000	5675000	So what it came out on is
5675000	5678000	I hear giggles
5678000	5681000	It's just the chat room acting up
5681000	5682000	Let's kneel
5682000	5685000	Travis I'm gonna bench you over my knee and spank ya
5685000	5688000	And not in the good way for the 69th episode
5688000	5689000	The fuck he said
5689000	5690000	Nah it's not that, don't worry
5690000	5691000	Get back to the classic game
5691000	5692000	Alright
5692000	5699000	So it came out for the Sega Master System, the PC Engine, PC Engine CD, Famicom, Atari STX
5699000	5701000	Spectrum, Commodore 64, R.O.B.
5701000	5705000	The Armstrad CPC, Commodore Amiga, and DOS
5705000	5714000	The Mega Drive slash Genesis version is important because it was a pack-in game for North America, Europe, and Brazil
5714000	5716000	And then it was replaced by Sonic the Hedgehog
5716000	5720000	There is a handheld version of the game done by Tiger Electronics
5720000	5722000	God what is funny?
5722000	5725000	I'm not allowed to smile
5725000	5727000	But you're doing the nose laugh
5727000	5732000	I'm laughing because Travis spoke up in chat and said, yeah baby
5732000	5735000	And I tried to spank him so I'm laughing
5735000	5739000	Remember, it's only porn if you tape it
5739000	5740000	So
5740000	5741000	Yeah baby
5741000	5745000	The Mega Drive version is on several compilations
5745000	5751000	Including the Sega Smash Pack, Sega Genesis Collection, and Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection
5751000	5753000	And on the latter two they are unlockable
5753000	5756000	You can get it on the Virtual Console for Wii
5756000	5760000	It is on Xbox 360, on Xbox Live Arcade
5760000	5764000	And on the Playstation Network as the arcade version with HD support
5764000	5766000	And has online
5766000	5767000	What?
5767000	5769000	Sorry
5769000	5772000	Online leaderboards and network play
5772000	5775000	There is an iOS version of the Mega Drive version
5775000	5778000	That came out in 2010 for the iPhone and iPad
5778000	5782000	Because all the good stuff comes out on iOS and not Android
5782000	5790000	There are a lot of the lower versions
5790000	5793000	That only had single player and four levels
5793000	5798000	And had different beasts like a human shark in the NES version
5798000	5800000	It was very weird
5800000	5804000	But yeah, now there is this thing called Project Altered Beast
5804000	5808000	And this was a Playstation 2 title that came out
5808000	5810000	Excuse me
5810000	5814000	In 2005 in Japan it was called Jewel Key Project Altered Beast
5814000	5817000	And Altered Beast in Europe
5817000	5820000	And it did not come out in North America
5820000	5824000	It was 18 plus rated in Japan for being intensity
5824000	5827000	But in Europe it was rated 12 plus
5827000	5830000	But it had like tons and tons of gore in it
5830000	5834000	And it basically was kind of unrelated to the original game
5834000	5836000	You played as a dude called Luke Custer
5836000	5839000	Who was a genome cyborg
5839000	5842000	And his DNA and genetic makeup was screwed
5842000	5846000	So that he could turn into a werewolf, a merman, a garuda
5846000	5848000	Which basically is like an eagle
5848000	5851000	A wendigo, a minotaur and a dragon
5851000	5854000	And then you could also be like a weretiger and a grizzly bear
5854000	5856000	So bears in video games huh
5856000	5859000	And then there was Altered Beast Guardian of the Realms
5859000	5864000	Which was developed by 3D6 Games and published by THQ
5864000	5867000	That was a sequel for the GBA version
5867000	5871000	And you could turn into a werewolf, a snake man
5871000	5874000	A dragon, a tiger man, a spiked turtle
5874000	5876000	A shark man, a rhinoceros man
5876000	5878000	An eagle man
5878000	5881000	A scorpion or a chimera
5881000	5883000	Or
5883000	5885000	Yeah
5885000	5887000	So that's it
5887000	5890000	Alright there it is, your classic game of the week
5890000	5891000	One last thing
5891000	5892000	Altered Beast
5892000	5894000	Neth, the bad guy
5894000	5896000	Will be in rhinoceros form in Wreck it Ralph
5896000	5897000	Oh okay
5897000	5899000	In the bad guy's anonymous scene
5899000	5900000	Nice
5900000	5902000	Alright Altered Beast, your classic game of the week
5902000	5904000	Now some folks in chat are thinking
5904000	5906000	Wasn't this a classic game of the week before?
5906000	5907000	Actually it wasn't
5907000	5909000	Here's where it came up on the show before
5909000	5913000	Not that long ago the Genesis collection or whatever
5913000	5917000	The reimaginings that were on the Playstation Network and Xbox Live Arcade
5917000	5920000	They went free for Playstation Plus subscribers
5920000	5923000	That same week I signed up for Playstation Plus
5923000	5925000	So I went back and played through this entire game
5925000	5928000	And I think I did this whole rant on those unicorns
5928000	5930000	So I have talked about this game on the show previously
5930000	5932000	But it wasn't technically a classic game of the week
5932000	5934000	That was a little while ago at this point
5934000	5938000	So just to clear up any confusion
5938000	5940000	But I do remember when I played through it
5940000	5941000	Can I check the list?
5941000	5943000	It's pretty terrible
5943000	5945000	Now keep in mind I had to play the Genesis version
5945000	5947000	Not the arcade version
5947000	5949000	We actually just I think played through the Genesis version
5949000	5950000	Not long ago
5950000	5951000	We had
5951000	5952000	Pretty bad
5952000	5954000	No I take that back, Sega Ages
5954000	5955000	We played through
5955000	5956000	Alright
5956000	5958000	Alright so there it is your classic game of the week
5958000	5959000	Altered Beast
5959000	5960000	Let's take a break
5960000	5962000	Obviously it's been a lullsy show so far
5962000	5964000	But the best is yet to come
5964000	5966000	Nah I don't know I'm just saying that
5966000	5968000	But you don't know what's gonna happen on part B
5968000	5969000	Of Orange Lounge Radio
5969000	5971000	We're gonna get to the emails
5971000	5973000	FUs of the week and phone calls
5973000	5975000	Oh anything can happen during phone calls
5975000	5977000	All when we come back with more
5977000	5979000	Of Orange Lounge Radio
5984000	5987000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio
5987000	5990000	Episode number 469
5990000	5992000	Already in progress
5992000	5995000	We've had quite the night so far
5997000	5998000	Okay
5998000	5999000	I have coffee
5999000	6001000	I was talking to Alan in the other room during the break
6001000	6004000	And he's actually listening to the show while he plays Mass Effect 3 multiplayer
6004000	6005000	Which by the way
6005000	6008000	He has a disgusting collection of Mass Effect 3 multiplayer
6008000	6010000	I saw the guns
6010000	6012000	Pretty outstanding huh
6012000	6014000	He said he was about ready to come out here and tell us
6014000	6016000	No stop it stop it
6016000	6018000	During the uh
6018000	6020000	During the release date segment
6020000	6022000	But anyway we'll see what happens
6022000	6024000	In this part B of our program
6024000	6026000	The song was not about alien dildos
6026000	6027000	Pork chop
6027000	6030000	Now the podcasters will have no idea what you're talking about
6030000	6033000	But during the break we played a song for Mass Effect
6033000	6035000	The long song that's the credits during the first game
6035000	6038000	Unless you have DLC and then the song was seriously stopped
6038000	6039000	And you still have credits
6039000	6040000	Right
6040000	6042000	Actually that was me in Mass Effect 2
6042000	6045000	I had like another
6045000	6047000	Same length of the song plus some
6047000	6049000	Of no music
6049000	6051000	What?
6051000	6054000	For Mass Effect 2 I had so much DLC
6054000	6055000	Oh
6055000	6057000	Because I bought the collector's edition
6057000	6059000	Because it was 11 bucks and came with the first Mass Effect
6059000	6061000	Which I already bought
6061000	6062000	Right
6062000	6065000	That I seriously had the length of the song
6065000	6067000	Plus some of nothing
6067000	6069000	So I just went to the bathroom
6069000	6071000	Cool story
6071000	6072000	Alright
6072000	6074000	Let's get into some rapid fire news
6074000	6078000	And some quick stories about some things going on in the gaming world this week
6078000	6079000	Logie
6079000	6082000	Alright so Minecraft Pocket Edition has gotten an update
6082000	6085000	Where they've added a few things that you can find in the full fledged version
6085000	6087000	On PC and Xbox 360
6087000	6090000	Well 360 not being entirely full fledged
6090000	6091000	But you get the point
6091000	6092000	Anyways
6092000	6096000	They've added skeletons and spiders
6096000	6099000	As well as bows
6099000	6101000	So now you can fire bows and arrows
6101000	6103000	Or fire arrows at a
6103000	6106000	Spiders and skeletons and bows oh my
6106000	6110000	I'm surprised I thought they already had skeletons in the game
6110000	6112000	But maybe I'm just mistaken
6112000	6113000	Maybe there's always zombies
6113000	6114000	I haven't played much of the Pocket Edition
6114000	6116000	But I do play it sometimes
6116000	6119000	When I'm stuck somewhere and I'll have my phone
6119000	6125000	Skyrim is getting the 1.7 update on consoles
6125000	6129000	Becoming out and of course it includes a number of bug fixes
6129000	6132000	And optimizations and stuff like that
6132000	6134000	And they'll be coming out on Xbox
6134000	6137000	And also PC at some point
6137000	6139000	Or PS3 at some point
6139000	6141000	And still no word on Dawnguard
6141000	6143000	For PS3
6143000	6144000	You don't get it yet
6144000	6146000	Because they're just not satisfied with
6146000	6147000	When it's ready
6147000	6148000	Exactly
6148000	6150000	Well we're satisfied
6150000	6153000	And then last but not least
6153000	6154000	Cabela's
6154000	6159000	You know they're really trying hard to figure out a way to make Cabela's interesting
6159000	6161000	And so now the latest thing that they have
6161000	6164000	Is they kind of modified their top shot gun
6164000	6166000	Because they actually for the last few games
6166000	6169000	They've had this gun peripheral
6169000	6172000	It's a wireless gun that goes along with
6172000	6175000	The Xbox 360 and PS3 versions
6175000	6178000	But now they've retitled the gun the Fear Master
6178000	6181000	And what makes it unique is that it has
6181000	6185000	A sensor built into the actual handle of the gun
6185000	6188000	That senses your heart rate
6188000	6193000	And I guess based on that it will affect the game
6193000	6196000	So is that like the Wii Vitality sensor?
6196000	6197000	Sort of
6197000	6198000	Okay
6198000	6201000	But you know had they pitched it instead of saying
6201000	6203000	It'll make you healthy and blah blah blah
6203000	6205000	They could have made it you know
6205000	6206000	The Wii Vitality sensor
6206000	6208000	We're gonna throw dangerous animals at you
6208000	6210000	I mean that might have been a little bit more interesting
6210000	6213000	Like the Wii Vitality sensor had been for like Tokyo Jungle
6213000	6216000	Which is a PlayStation game so I know that makes no sense
6216000	6217000	But you know
6217000	6218000	Work with me here for a minute
6218000	6219000	Yes
6219000	6220000	Something like that
6220000	6222000	But that's coming out on the 23rd
6222000	6224000	That's Dangerous Hunts 2013
6224000	6225000	Cause they have two
6225000	6227000	Two Cabela's games that come out each year
6227000	6230000	Actually last year they had three on the same day
6230000	6232000	Why?
6232000	6235000	Oh that also happened to be the week before
6235000	6237000	Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 came out
6237000	6239000	So no one gave a shit
6239000	6243000	Can I interject a little story about something like this?
6243000	6244000	Of course
6244000	6245000	I actually hadn't heard of this before
6245000	6246000	And something kind of interesting that
6246000	6247000	Not a lot of people know
6247000	6249000	May know as a result of the situation
6249000	6255000	Fatal Frame 1 through 3 were all PlayStation 2 games
6255000	6257000	And then Fatal Frame 4 came out on the Wii
6257000	6259000	And actually incorporated motion controls
6259000	6260000	Etcetera, etcetera
6260000	6264000	In Japan and Europe they re-released Fatal Frame 2
6264000	6266000	Under the Fatal Frame 4 controls
6266000	6267000	And it's amazing
6267000	6269000	Like I wasn't a big fan of 4
6269000	6270000	First three games
6270000	6271000	Absolutely love them
6271000	6275000	The relevance here is that Fatal Frame 2's re-release
6275000	6276000	Has mini games
6276000	6280000	And they actually implemented something like this
6280000	6281000	They attempted to
6281000	6283000	Where you basically walk through a haunted house
6283000	6285000	In a Fatal Frame 2 scene
6285000	6288000	And they basically measure fear
6288000	6292000	As a result of movement in the nunchuck and the Wiimote
6292000	6294000	Obviously they're not going to be picking up your heart rate
6294000	6295000	Or anything like that
6295000	6296000	Which would have been a better indicator
6296000	6300000	But they'll throw sounds and ghosts and spirits
6300000	6303000	And you know the Fatal Frame kind of situations at you
6303000	6306000	And the goal is to keep the Wiimote and the nunchuck
6306000	6307000	As steady as possible
6307000	6309000	Now that would have been a pretty good use of the Wiimote
6309000	6312000	Yeah, it's a nice little implementation
6312000	6317000	The re-release happened mid, late last year, earlier this year
6317000	6319000	I don't think it's going to come out in America
6319000	6322000	But the situation, the fact that they actually took something like that
6322000	6323000	And went forward through it
6323000	6325000	It's kind of a cool application
6325000	6327000	Because the Wiimote's going to know when you throw your hands up
6327000	6328000	And freak out
6328000	6330000	As, well, a little kid would anyways
6330000	6331000	I haven't, I swear
6331000	6335000	Ry, would you care to comment on that?
6335000	6338000	Actually, he's pretty calm when playing those games
6338000	6340000	It's very fun to watch Jason play those
6340000	6343000	Does Jason ever lose his shit over any video games?
6343000	6345000	That's a good question
6345000	6346000	That is a really good question
6346000	6348000	I don't think I've really seen him lose his shit
6348000	6350000	I've seen him where he'll pause it
6350000	6353000	And kind of look away and that kind of thing
6353000	6355000	But nothing like getting up and screaming
6355000	6358000	Or jumping from something that's bad
6358000	6360000	Not like the boys at Four Player Podcast
6360000	6362000	Yeah, not like one of our other friends
6362000	6364000	He's very, very scared of him
6364000	6365000	You can tell
6365000	6368000	Has he played much of, was it
6368000	6371000	Amnesia? Maybe that's the game we need to be adjacent to
6371000	6373000	No, well there's Amnesia and then there's also
6373000	6377000	What is it, not the
6377000	6379000	Yeah, Ender
6379000	6381000	Amnesia's on my list
6381000	6383000	I do have it in Steam and it's on my list eventually
6383000	6385000	Even when I played Silent Hill 3
6385000	6386000	Slender, I'm sorry, not Ender
6386000	6388000	I've been confusing Minecraft again
6388000	6391000	Well, it's Slender
6391000	6393000	It's based on the Slender Man stuff
6393000	6395000	But they have Slender
6395000	6398000	People get fucking freaked out by that game
6398000	6399000	What is this on?
6399000	6401000	It's on PC
6401000	6403000	One of my coworkers was talking about it
6403000	6405000	And it's one of those things that I forgot the name of it
6405000	6406000	So I couldn't come home and say
6406000	6408000	Hey Jason, you need to play this
6408000	6410000	So Slender and Amnesia, huh?
6410000	6412000	Slender is all about walking through the forest
6412000	6414000	And you get to find notes
6414000	6417000	But the Slender Man, you see, he stalks you
6417000	6420000	And occasionally you'll walk into
6420000	6422000	And it's all at night with a flashlight
6422000	6424000	And if you look at him
6424000	6426000	You know, the longer you look at him
6426000	6428000	The more damage you take
6428000	6431000	And you're not supposed to look at the Slender Man
6431000	6432000	I'm intrigued
6432000	6434000	I will say that
6434000	6437000	Just before Silent Hill HD Collections came out
6437000	6439000	I actually went there and replayed
6439000	6442000	Went to go play through all of Silent Hill 1-4
6442000	6444000	The ambiance of 4 and especially the ending
6444000	6446000	It terrified me
6446000	6450000	I could not get more than 15-20 minutes into Silent Hill 4
6450000	6453000	The quietness, the...
6453000	6455000	You didn't even start Silent Hill 4
6455000	6457000	It was the opening video
6457000	6459000	I took steps through the room
6459000	6461000	I got to the point where the room started to transition
6461000	6463000	Which was, okay, maybe it wasn't 20 minutes
6463000	6465000	Maybe I'm giving myself a little bit too much credit there
6465000	6467000	I started the game
6467000	6468000	I looked outside
6468000	6470000	I saw the other apartment complex
6470000	6472000	And the couple of people you could see moving
6472000	6475000	But as soon as the wall started changing
6475000	6477000	Plus the intro video
6477000	6478000	Can you imagine?
6478000	6480000	I can't wait for in the future
6480000	6482000	When we have these reaction videos
6482000	6484000	But instead of the reaction videos
6484000	6486000	People watching the screen
6486000	6488000	It's like a VR heads up display
6488000	6489000	Or something like that
6489000	6491000	Where you're just completely immersed
6491000	6492000	And you turn around
6492000	6493000	HOLY SHIT!
6493000	6495000	Immersion is going to be the best thing
6495000	6497000	And the worst thing for me
6497000	6500000	For the record, you know the only thing that creeps me out in Silent Hill?
6500000	6501000	The rabbit
6501000	6503000	We need to get the video capture
6503000	6505000	For me it's that hospital room
6505000	6507000	Where you go in the room and then all of a sudden it's the giant head
6507000	6509000	And it's like
6512000	6514000	I can tell how scared you are right now
6514000	6516000	Well I really think what we should do
6516000	6519000	We need to make it a priority to get the video capture set up in this place
6519000	6521000	So that for Halloween
6521000	6523000	Or somewhere around there we can do a
6523000	6525000	Scary game marathon
6525000	6527000	And make me play these scary games
6527000	6529000	And I will cry
6529000	6531000	I will throw things
6531000	6533000	Nothing will match that experience
6533000	6535000	Where I was playing Silent Hill Homecoming
6535000	6537000	And the ceiling falls down
6537000	6539000	In this one random part
6539000	6541000	And I was playing in the middle of a rainstorm
6541000	6543000	And our front door blew open
6543000	6545000	And I swear to god
6545000	6547000	I jumped in my bed and went under the covers and started crying
6547000	6549000	I couldn't handle it
6549000	6551000	It was too much
6551000	6553000	And Homecoming wasn't even that great
6553000	6555000	All things considered
6555000	6557000	It was alright
6557000	6559000	Anyhow
6559000	6561000	I have some news for you guys as well
6561000	6563000	Unfortunately some sad news
6563000	6565000	I have to start off with some sad news here
6565000	6567000	During my part of rapid fire news
6567000	6569000	Paul Steed
6569000	6571000	He worked on bringing Wing Commander to 3D
6571000	6573000	He also was part of the original Xbox launch
6573000	6575000	Unfortunately he passed away
6575000	6577000	We don't have a cause of death or what have you
6577000	6579000	But he was a very important part of 90s gaming
6579000	6581000	He worked on some big big PC titles in the 90s
6581000	6583000	Wing Commander
6583000	6585000	Wings of Glory
6585000	6587000	Bioforge
6587000	6589000	Quake at ID Software
6589000	6591000	And he also made the crack horror player model
6591000	6593000	Yes that was a thing
6593000	6595000	So unfortunately he did pass away this week
6595000	6597000	According to the Jace Hall show
6597000	6599000	Which there is a YouTube clip of him there
6599000	6601000	He leaves behind a wife and child
6601000	6603000	Sorry to hear that
6603000	6605000	Moving on
6605000	6607000	To news about the Wii U
6607000	6609000	Wii games apparently going to be playable
6609000	6611000	On the Wii U gamepad
6611000	6613000	That's very interesting
6613000	6615000	We kind of expect that Nintendo platforms at this point
6615000	6617000	Are going to be backwards compatible
6617000	6619000	With the prior platform
6619000	6621000	It's been a very common thing in the handheld part
6621000	6623000	And then of course we've seen
6623000	6625000	You know how the Wii will play GameCube games
6625000	6627000	Well the Wii U will play the Wii games as well
6627000	6629000	And what's interesting is that you can actually play them
6629000	6631000	On the little gamepad
6631000	6633000	Because those gamepads have the little sensor bar
6633000	6635000	In them
6635000	6637000	So yep you can point with the touch screen and so forth
6637000	6639000	Using a Wii remote
6639000	6641000	However I want to point out
6641000	6643000	This is still apparently a rumor
6643000	6645000	That it's a Spanish brand manager
6645000	6647000	And not an official Nintendo source
6647000	6649000	It kind of makes sense though
6649000	6651000	It would be a great reason to sell a mini-mote
6651000	6653000	A mini-mote
6653000	6655000	A little keychain mote
6655000	6657000	How big is this screen?
6657000	6659000	Not even 4 inches or so?
6659000	6661000	Well it's not the size, Jason
6661000	6663000	It's how you use it
6663000	6665000	4-16
6665000	6667000	I can't imagine playing a game
6667000	6669000	With that small of a pointing radius
6669000	6671000	No I understand
6671000	6673000	Because even when they were showing
6673000	6675000	The Wii U
6675000	6677000	The Wii Fit U stuff
6677000	6679000	It was just like
6679000	6681000	Ok that's fucking ridiculous
6681000	6683000	You're going to have this little thing set up
6683000	6685000	While your wife's watching TV
6685000	6687000	And you're going to be exercising to this tiny little screen
6687000	6689000	Come on, I mean that's a little
6689000	6691000	Little dumb
6691000	6693000	But there's other Wii games that would work
6693000	6695000	Like Mario Galaxy
6695000	6697000	New Super Mario
6697000	6699000	Virtual Console games
6699000	6701000	New Super Mario Brothers
6701000	6703000	I was actually just thinking about that
6703000	6705000	That's kind of worse for one reason
6705000	6707000	Certain power-ups
6707000	6709000	You're holding this
6709000	6711000	What I'm expecting to be rather
6711000	6713000	Hefty tablet
6713000	6715000	Less because it's not the whole guts
6715000	6717000	But you're holding this tablet in your hands
6717000	6719000	Oh I need to throw a fireball
6719000	6721000	Let me shake this ridiculously oversized
6721000	6723000	Controller tablet
6723000	6725000	In order to spin jump
6725000	6727000	Propeller
6727000	6729000	That thing had a built in projector
6729000	6731000	That little tablet thing had a built in projector
6731000	6733000	That would be fucking cool
6733000	6735000	Wasn't that the early rumors about the revolution
6735000	6737000	Was that it's going to project
6737000	6739000	3D out its anus
6739000	6741000	Onto your wall
6741000	6743000	Remember that shit?
6743000	6745000	No remember that was the console was the
6745000	6747000	VR headset
6747000	6749000	That's what the thing was
6749000	6751000	I remember the whole
6751000	6753000	The Wii is like fucking holograms and shit
6753000	6755000	I remember those were early
6755000	6757000	When it was the revolution and they said
6757000	6759000	Oh it's the Wii
6759000	6761000	And you're like nope that's not going to be revolutionary at all
6761000	6763000	Anyhow
6763000	6765000	We took this really kick ass name
6765000	6767000	And we cut its balls off
6767000	6769000	Speaking of Nintendo news
6769000	6771000	There are some more details for Animal Crossing
6771000	6773000	3DS
6773000	6775000	I don't know how I feel
6775000	6777000	Total KK Total KK Total KK Total KK
6777000	6779000	Animal Crossing was awesome the first time
6779000	6781000	It was one of the best games ever on the GameCube
6781000	6783000	Back when it had the NES games unlocked
6783000	6785000	But now I don't know
6785000	6787000	I'm getting a little bit
6787000	6789000	I'm feeling a little burned out on this series
6789000	6791000	But I'll give it one more go with the 3DS version
6791000	6793000	It was educational for me
6793000	6795000	Oh with the whole, you're talking about the
6795000	6797000	Animal Forest with the Japanese letters
6797000	6799000	Yeah because I was using it to practice reading
6799000	6801000	Anyhow
6801000	6803000	Here are some things to look forward to in the brand new
6803000	6805000	Animal Crossing Jump Out
6805000	6807000	Which by the way is the title
6807000	6809000	Oh my god
6809000	6811000	Well because it's 3D so the pictures they just
6811000	6813000	Go out
6813000	6815000	Yeah
6815000	6817000	Loki these are the things you have to look forward to
6817000	6819000	Because I know you're a big fan of Animal Crossing
6819000	6821000	Oh I can't wait to pick it up for my 3
6821000	6823000	Oh wait no I can't
6823000	6825000	An all new gardening store where you can purchase
6825000	6827000	Plants
6827000	6829000	Fantastic you know instead of having them at Nook's
6829000	6831000	Where they've always been let's separate it into
6831000	6833000	Yet another fucking store I gotta hike to
6833000	6835000	That has different hours in Nook
6835000	6837000	Raccoon housing which will be run by Tom Nook
6837000	6839000	A wider variety
6839000	6841000	Of fish and fossils which you can
6841000	6843000	Donate to your museum
6843000	6845000	An exhibition room
6845000	6847000	And shop in the museum which will be open
6847000	6849000	24 hours
6849000	6851000	I don't know of any museums that are open 24 hours
6851000	6853000	Actually a lot of like
6853000	6855000	National parks and stuff like I'm thinking like
6855000	6857000	Washington DC a lot of people don't know this but like the
6857000	6859000	Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument they're all 24 hours
6859000	6861000	Those are all outdoors I mean
6861000	6863000	A museum that you, ok sorry
6863000	6865000	Rapid fire
6865000	6867000	When it's run by an owl
6867000	6869000	He can stay open all night
6869000	6871000	He's a night owl
6871000	6873000	Touche
6873000	6875000	A miscellaneous goods store
6875000	6877000	That's what it's called
6877000	6879000	The Able Sisters Clothes Shop
6879000	6881000	Oh wow that's a new feature
6881000	6883000	Roofs, doors
6883000	6885000	Posts and fences can be
6885000	6887000	Customized
6887000	6889000	So I'm gonna have a pink
6889000	6891000	Fence I can't wait till I have a lesbian
6891000	6893000	Again I can't wait either
6893000	6895000	Brand new furniture
6895000	6897000	Including mermaid
6897000	6899000	Items
6899000	6901000	Under the sea
6901000	6903000	We need that little singing crab
6903000	6905000	A player will be the
6905000	6907000	Mayor of his or her town
6907000	6909000	So now you're in control
6909000	6911000	Oh but I like the mayor
6911000	6913000	He died
6913000	6915000	Well he was pretty fucking old
6915000	6917000	Can you evict citizens as the mayor
6917000	6919000	That would be awesome
6919000	6921000	I would have an all lesbian
6921000	6923000	Community
6923000	6925000	A thrift shop
6925000	6927000	Will be available
6927000	6929000	It makes sense Goodwills are popping up
6929000	6931000	On every corner in this day and age
6931000	6933000	So it's basically
6933000	6935000	As opposed to like the recycle bin that you
6935000	6937000	Free shit out of now you're gonna go buy it
6937000	6939000	Alright a shopping mall
6939000	6941000	Will be available
6941000	6943000	And lastly
6943000	6945000	A shoe store
6945000	6947000	Oh my god shit
6947000	6949000	All they're doing is fucking separating
6949000	6951000	Everything out even more
6951000	6953000	Than it was before
6953000	6955000	These aren't new features folks
6955000	6957000	These are just the same goddamn features
6957000	6959000	Just spread out even more
6959000	6961000	Between like each store instead of nooks carrying
6961000	6963000	Pretty much everything it's just like
6963000	6965000	Nooks is carrying
6965000	6967000	No I don't even know if there is a nooks in this game
6967000	6969000	But it's like a store carrying this type of item
6969000	6971000	This store is carrying this type of item
6971000	6973000	This store is carrying this type of item
6973000	6975000	This guy says you know
6975000	6977000	It's all fucking filler is all what it is
6977000	6979000	Where's my store that sells classic NES games
6979000	6981000	I'm not fucking there so that's why I'm not buying your damn game
6983000	6985000	Oh I'm sorry that'd be the eShop I guess
6985000	6987000	Yeah that would be the Nintendo store
6987000	6989000	Wouldn't that be hilarious if there was a link
6989000	6991000	Within Animal Crossing to the eShop
6991000	6993000	There's how you can integrate
6993000	6995000	Some stuff in
6995000	6997000	That would be true innovation like the NES
6997000	6999000	Carts are back oh but you have to buy them
6999000	7001000	As DLC now
7001000	7003000	People do that
7003000	7005000	And you know I could see people doing that
7005000	7007000	But it'd be cool to have like
7007000	7009000	Demo versus fuck that you know what
7009000	7011000	It's just still stupid because they don't have the classic games in there
7011000	7015000	I would be scared for them to have demos for one reason
7015000	7017000	Look at the demos that they had in Smash Brothers Brawl
7017000	7019000	I can play the
7019000	7021000	Oh the first minute of the game
7021000	7023000	Over and over
7023000	7025000	Oh look at the progress I'm not making
7025000	7028000	AcidicVampire in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says
7028000	7030000	I was hoping for a shoes store
7030000	7032000	You know now that I think about it
7032000	7034000	I'll be able to make my character wear high heels
7034000	7036000	I'm a lumberjack and I don't care
7036000	7038000	I'm okay
7038000	7040000	Sleep all night on a wiggle day
7040000	7042000	Anyhow
7042000	7044000	Dark Sakura let's move on with some rapid fire news
7044000	7047000	Well how about something for a game that's been out for two years
7047000	7050000	Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is getting new DLC
7050000	7052000	Yes
7052000	7054000	On August 19th
7054000	7056000	And it was
7056000	7058000	It's going to be on the two year anniversary
7058000	7060000	Of the Xbox Live release
7060000	7063000	That's a long time to go by
7063000	7066000	It's going to be a $5 pack, 400 points
7066000	7068000	And it has a new character
7068000	7070000	Wallace Wells
7070000	7072000	So you can be fantastic
7072000	7074000	And he doesn't actually need weapons
7074000	7077000	So I think he's just going to text people to death
7079000	7081000	And it will be on PSN by the way
7081000	7083000	This occasion calls for some
7083000	7085000	Animanguchi
7085000	7087000	Animanguchi I can never say their name
7087000	7097000	Animanguchi
7097000	7099000	I like the theme
7099000	7101000	The theme was great but Another Winter
7101000	7103000	The very first level stage
7103000	7106000	Actually you know what one of my other songs on repeat is?
7106000	7108000	Threshold
7108000	7116000	I love the picture
7116000	7118000	We've seen them live
7118000	7120000	It was fantastic
7120000	7122000	In other news
7122000	7124000	Jet Set Radio
7124000	7126000	Will be back for 9 bucks
7126000	7128000	It's going to be a PS3
7128000	7130000	And
7130000	7132000	The PS3 version will be
7132000	7134000	Available for Playstation Plus users
7134000	7136000	On September 11th
7136000	7138000	And September 18th
7138000	7140000	The version will be out for everyone else
7140000	7142000	Xbox Live Arcade and Steam versions will be out
7142000	7144000	On September 19th
7144000	7146000	Also for 10 bucks
7146000	7148000	Vita version will be out October 16th
7148000	7150000	It doesn't really say anything else about that
7150000	7152000	So
7152000	7154000	I'll just hook up my Dreamcast
7154000	7156000	And play the good version that has Bjork in it
7156000	7158000	And birthday cake
7158000	7160000	Shut up and eat me
7160000	7162000	Too bad no Bon Appetit
7162000	7164000	And then
7164000	7166000	They Bleed Pixels
7166000	7168000	Which is the best name of the game ever
7168000	7170000	It's going to be out for Steam
7170000	7172000	Instead of Xbox Live
7172000	7174000	Indie games
7174000	7176000	So
7176000	7178000	That was the official word by
7178000	7180000	SpookySquidGames which is also a cool name
7180000	7182000	Basically
7182000	7184000	Their creative director said that
7184000	7186000	They want to reach a larger audience
7186000	7188000	And PC and Steam is just the place to do that
7188000	7190000	So go check it out
7190000	7192000	It's supposed to be really
7192000	7194000	Freaking hard
7194000	7196000	And this says the more and better
7196000	7198000	You kill the faster you fill your checkpoint meter
7198000	7200000	I like killing
7200000	7202000	In games
7202000	7204000	Alright is that it? That would be it sir
7204000	7206000	That's it for rapid fire news
7206000	7208000	Let's get into the Fookal Question of the Week
7208000	7210000	Thanks for having me
7210000	7212000	Fookal
7216000	7218000	Every week on our Facebook and Google Plus communities
7218000	7220000	We like to ask a question and get your feedback
7220000	7222000	And you put Facebook and Google
7222000	7224000	Together you get Fookal
7224000	7226000	And it's just fun to say
7226000	7228000	Fookal
7228000	7230000	Alright our question this week
7230000	7232000	Is
7232000	7234000	Where the hell is it?
7234000	7236000	Tonight
7236000	7238000	I forgot how to navigate Google Plus
7238000	7240000	I'm sorry
7240000	7242000	Nobody left a comment on Google Plus tonight
7242000	7244000	There is officially nobody left on Google Plus
7244000	7246000	Little tumbleweed rolls by
7246000	7248000	Alright well here
7248000	7250000	Let's assume people that use Google Plus
7250000	7252000	Also watch the Olympics on a six hour
7252000	7254000	Tape delay so
7254000	7256000	Here's the question anyway
7256000	7258000	Tonight we have a story on a game from the Super Nintendo days
7258000	7260000	Where it was discovered this week that an unofficial
7260000	7262000	Never released version of it contained some pretty
7262000	7264000	Salty language which obviously was the
7264000	7266000	NBA Jam game we were talking about earlier
7266000	7268000	This had us thinking about
7268000	7270000	Shocking moments in video games
7270000	7272000	Have you ever been shocked by dialogue
7272000	7274000	In a game or something
7274000	7276000	That just happened in the plot
7276000	7278000	I wasn't necessarily going to like F word shocking
7278000	7280000	Just like were you ever like
7280000	7282000	Oh my God
7282000	7284000	What about something that just made you say
7284000	7286000	Oh no they just did not
7286000	7288000	What was a video game moment that had
7288000	7290000	You shocked
7290000	7292000	You spoonie bard
7292000	7294000	Was that really a shocking moment for you?
7294000	7296000	Considering I didn't play that game until it was released on the Playstation
7296000	7298000	That was more of a WT
7298000	7300000	I was like what's a spoonie bard
7300000	7302000	I just thought it appropriate after I read the question
7302000	7304000	Alright we have some great answers tonight on the Facebooks
7304000	7306000	So I'm going to go through and read some of the answers here
7306000	7308000	Picaruno says
7308000	7310000	You have to be pretty fucking filthy to shock me
7312000	7314000	Although I think Brutal Legend handled the
7314000	7316000	Swearing gore in a funny way
7316000	7318000	Stopping the action just before an F bomb
7318000	7320000	Or beheading to politely ask if you would like to enable
7320000	7322000	The fucks and guts
7322000	7324000	Was that really what it was called? Fucks and guts?
7324000	7326000	Ragenator says
7326000	7328000	I'd have to go with an unconventional choice
7328000	7330000	The Super Nintendo port of Mortal Kombat
7330000	7332000	Ported by Acclaim
7332000	7334000	For what was included in the game, but for what was not
7334000	7336000	Included in the game
7336000	7338000	Meaning that the game was sanitized
7338000	7340000	This port has become the poster child of why games
7340000	7342000	Shouldn't be censored
7342000	7344000	And has given Nintendo a proverbial black eye
7344000	7346000	For a good many years
7346000	7348000	That was an interesting interpretation of the question
7348000	7350000	Because he took it to mean I was so shocked in a bad way
7350000	7352000	Like I was shocked at how shitty this turned out
7352000	7354000	That's kind of an interesting way to go with the question
7354000	7356000	They're punching the sweat off my face
7356000	7358000	That sweat is so shocking
7358000	7360000	Let's see, moving on
7360000	7362000	Stan says
7362000	7364000	I just watched a battle scene for Persona 3
7364000	7366000	For the first time ever
7366000	7368000	And my jaw seriously dropped when I saw that they had
7368000	7370000	Summoned their Personas by shooting themselves
7370000	7372000	In the head
7372000	7374000	I'm sure that that reason was explained in game
7374000	7376000	But WTF
7376000	7378000	Ratchet Tag says
7378000	7380000	Silent Hill 2
7380000	7382000	I was playing through for the first time and there was a scene
7382000	7384000	In which you're walking down a hall and see Pyramid Head
7384000	7386000	Doing really unspeakable things to mannequins
7386000	7388000	I was a bit young so it was pretty shocking
7388000	7390000	And disturbing
7390000	7392000	If you have played this you know what I'm talking about
7392000	7394000	He included a video with his answer
7394000	7396000	And I think we all know that scene in Silent Hill 2
7396000	7398000	And of course the preview kicks in
7398000	7400000	And tells you exactly what the video is
7400000	7402000	In advance
7402000	7404000	Which is both a helpful and hurtful thing
7404000	7406000	Now Shane replied and also said something
7406000	7408000	From Silent Hill 2
7408000	7410000	I'll just put a spoiler warning out there
7410000	7412000	Even though this game is almost 10 years old at this point
7412000	7414000	It's when you find out that James smothered
7414000	7416000	You with a pillow
7416000	7418000	That was ridiculous the first time you found out
7418000	7420000	It's a 10 year old game people
7420000	7422000	Especially because they showed him doing it
7422000	7424000	Runner up would be when Kaiden
7424000	7426000	Got his head bashed in on Mars
7426000	7428000	In Mass Effect 3
7428000	7430000	I literally got up from my computer right after that happened
7430000	7432000	And walked around to try and lose
7432000	7434000	Some of my anger I was filled with
7434000	7436000	This brings us to a very interesting question
7436000	7438000	A Shane question that I would have to ask him someday
7438000	7440000	And that would be
7440000	7442000	What if
7442000	7444000	Let's say that BioWare
7444000	7446000	Never plans to make another Mass Effect game
7446000	7448000	But
7448000	7450000	They'll make a Mass Effect 4
7450000	7452000	Only if Kaiden dies
7452000	7454000	In the first 5 minutes
7454000	7456000	For good
7456000	7458000	Or Ashley depending on how you've played the games
7458000	7460000	Then what do you do?
7460000	7462000	Do you take another Mass Effect game
7462000	7464000	Because hey more Mass Effect
7464000	7466000	And have your favorite character die
7466000	7468000	Or do you say you know what
7468000	7470000	I choose to remember these games as they were
7470000	7472000	Not dead
7472000	7474000	That's quite the dilemma isn't it
7474000	7476000	What would you do Dark Sakura
7476000	7478000	Let's say Mass Effect 4 with Garrus dead
7478000	7480000	In the first 5 minutes or no more Mass Effect ever
7480000	7482000	What would you do?
7482000	7484000	No more Mass Effect ever
7484000	7486000	Interesting alright
7486000	7488000	Well I don't know because if they said it in another universe
7488000	7490000	Totally then that's fine or in the future
7490000	7492000	It depends on the situation
7492000	7494000	Alright
7494000	7496000	Let's see
7496000	7498000	Ospher says Soul Calibur 5
7498000	7500000	When Maxie beats Astaroth
7500000	7502000	He stares at the camera angrily and shouts
7502000	7504000	God damn freak
7504000	7506000	That's just rude
7506000	7508000	Irene replied and said there's some obvious ones
7508000	7510000	Chrono dying, Eris dying, Samus being a girl
7510000	7512000	Justin Bailey, the upside down castle
7512000	7514000	That was like 7 answers
7514000	7516000	But one that kind of threw me off
7516000	7518000	Was the revelation about the main antagonist
7518000	7520000	Lady Mamiya
7520000	7522000	At the end of Sweet Home
7522000	7524000	No spoilers in case someone actually wanted to play through it
7524000	7526000	It just seemed intense
7526000	7528000	For an NES game
7528000	7530000	By the way I just got a text message
7530000	7532000	No more Mass Effect
7532000	7534000	Thank you Shane
7534000	7536000	At least we know he's listening now
7536000	7538000	Even though he missed the first half
7538000	7540000	Shane, yes no more Mass Effect
7540000	7542000	Except I would cry if there was no
7542000	7544000	Now if there was no cadence
7544000	7546000	Sorry I wouldn't care
7546000	7548000	Monty Boggs in our chat room says
7548000	7550000	Ashley just tried to kill me so whatever let her die
7550000	7552000	Well you can let Garrus shoot her
7552000	7554000	Alright
7554000	7556000	Mandrew replies and said
7556000	7558000	You don't know Jack
7558000	7560000	A buddy of mine and I were playing
7560000	7562000	And we had to type
7562000	7564000	And we had to type an answer for a question
7564000	7566000	And he typed in fuck you
7566000	7568000	Jack responded with fuck me
7568000	7570000	No fuck you
7570000	7572000	And deducted like 10,000 points or something
7572000	7574000	When you're in 6th grade that throws off your guard
7574000	7576000	That's awesome
7576000	7578000	I never knew that could happen
7578000	7580000	But that's hilarious
7580000	7582000	Extifer replied and said
7582000	7584000	Hellscream called Sylvanas a bitch
7584000	7586000	In Warcraft
7586000	7588000	I'm sure there are several I'm not thinking of
7588000	7590000	But it all comes back to wow right
7590000	7592000	How about the dead babies in wow
7592000	7594000	You know what I'm talking about
7594000	7596000	I think so yeah
7596000	7598000	Where the troll lady is and she has all the babies
7598000	7600000	And then you have all the skeletons behind it
7600000	7602000	And the leather tents that the gnolls have
7602000	7604000	That are made out of peoples faces
7606000	7608000	Clover Nikon replied
7608000	7610000	And said Silent Hill 2
7610000	7612000	Which it was referred to earlier with Pyramid Head
7612000	7614000	And the Amanakans
7614000	7616000	Kareem J replied and said
7616000	7618000	Gears of War 3 a certain character dies
7618000	7620000	I won't say who but I thought it would be a character
7620000	7622000	They wouldn't kill off
7622000	7624000	How many games have we talked about tonight
7624000	7626000	That are upwards of 5 years old
7626000	7628000	And have danced around spoilers
7628000	7630000	And now we're talking about Gears of War 3
7630000	7632000	Well I think it's nice that people are trying to be respectful
7632000	7634000	I'm not going to criticize people for being respectful
7634000	7636000	Of the spoilers
7636000	7638000	Dark Charger replies and says
7638000	7640000	Eternal Darkness
7640000	7642000	Oh
7642000	7644000	That's a game they need to bring back on the Wii U
7644000	7646000	Don't they
7646000	7648000	That's a game that would
7648000	7650000	The problem with bringing a game like that
7650000	7652000	Is now it has a standard
7652000	7654000	For what's going to be scary
7654000	7656000	And you can't do the same thing
7656000	7658000	You can't do the same things all over again
7658000	7660000	Unless it's like literally a
7660000	7662000	Graphically improved port
7662000	7664000	But people would be like this game isn't scary
7664000	7666000	Oh
7666000	7668000	You can't redo a game like that
7668000	7670000	It's not going to happen well until there's a
7670000	7672000	Dramatic shift in technology
7672000	7674000	Like immersion we were talking about before
7674000	7676000	Until you can really have
7676000	7678000	Something different to
7678000	7680000	To throw at the player again
7680000	7682000	It's not going to be interesting
7682000	7684000	Oh wait let me get right on the mic here
7684000	7686000	But imagine the things that they did with
7686000	7688000	Fatal Frame 4 and the remake of Fatal Frame 2
7688000	7690000	Add that to the whole sanity
7690000	7692000	Thing and all the things that they could do
7692000	7694000	To fuck with you with Eternal Darkness
7694000	7696000	Yeah but the Haunted House and Fatal Frame 2
7696000	7698000	For people like us is stupid and boring
7698000	7700000	Yeah but I'm sure that they could do some
7700000	7702000	And that's what I'm talking about
7702000	7704000	The bonuses and the extras and the things
7704000	7706000	That they would be throwing in nowadays
7706000	7708000	Are dumb and boring
7708000	7710000	And Eternal Darkness as
7710000	7712000	Kinda cheesy as the game was
7712000	7714000	The effects were really good
7714000	7716000	And it made for a good way to keep you
7716000	7718000	To keep you through the game
7718000	7720000	Alright let me finish the comment here from Dark Charger
7720000	7722000	If you went in there spoiler free
7722000	7724000	Random noises, skewed perspectives
7724000	7726000	And even a blue screen of death made you question
7726000	7728000	Your own sanity as you played through
7728000	7730000	Chiggers replied and said
7730000	7732000	The first time I ever heard shit
7732000	7734000	In a game was when Barret said it in
7734000	7736000	Final Fantasy 7, I was awestruck
7736000	7738000	Uh actually
7738000	7740000	Sit your ass down in that chair
7740000	7742000	And drink your goddamn tea
7744000	7746000	And lastly Tigerclaw says
7746000	7748000	To me the most shocking moment in a video game
7748000	7750000	Was in Bionic Commando
7750000	7752000	When you see Master D aka
7752000	7754000	Hitler's head explode
7754000	7756000	That's pretty awesome
7756000	7758000	I read all the answers cause they were all really good
7758000	7760000	Thank you guys at facebook.com
7760000	7762000	Orange Lounge Radio
7762000	7764000	What about you guys?
7764000	7766000	Shocking moments in video games
7766000	7768000	I'm gonna go with a really cliche
7768000	7770000	One that was already mentioned but it really was the most
7770000	7772000	Shocking moment for me was when Aris died
7772000	7774000	In Final Fantasy 7 like for real
7774000	7776000	For real I was like
7776000	7778000	That just fucking happened
7778000	7780000	Really? Like they're gonna just off
7780000	7782000	A character, video game characters don't die
7782000	7784000	They just regenerate
7784000	7786000	I cheered, I cheered
7786000	7788000	There's not really much that shocks me in a game
7788000	7790000	I mean maybe
7790000	7792000	Selly's throwing herself off a cliff
7792000	7794000	I was like, did she just throw herself off a cliff?
7794000	7796000	Stupid bitch
7796000	7798000	Other than that
7798000	7800000	I was like, oh
7800000	7802000	I haven't really had a shocking moment
7802000	7804000	Um
7804000	7806000	Oh I know one thing that actually
7806000	7808000	Did kinda gross me out
7808000	7810000	Well okay first of all Robbie the Rabbit
7810000	7812000	Always kinda creeps me out
7812000	7814000	The big head in Silent Hill 4
7814000	7816000	And I knew the big head was there
7816000	7818000	But even seeing the big head was like
7818000	7820000	Ugh stop looking at me
7820000	7822000	Cause I have a thing about big heads
7822000	7824000	And I don't like them
7824000	7826000	Like we had
7826000	7828000	Like the um
7828000	7830000	The clown face in Fun House
7830000	7832000	The pinball table
7832000	7834000	That thing creeps me out
7834000	7836000	I mean it doesn't matter that
7836000	7838000	The goal is to hit it with a pinball
7838000	7840000	It's still creepy
7840000	7842000	And that's in pinball
7842000	7844000	I'm gonna say a really recent one
7844000	7846000	The most shocking moment for me a recent game
7846000	7848000	That I actually played again this week for the first time in a while
7848000	7850000	Journey on the Playstation 3
7850000	7852000	Because I had no idea
7852000	7854000	Going into it that it was a online
7854000	7856000	Game and the moment I saw another person
7856000	7858000	There was kind of shocking like
7858000	7860000	What?
7860000	7862000	And the fact that they weren't acting like
7862000	7864000	Jason saying go up here
7864000	7866000	Go over here
7866000	7868000	Journey
7868000	7870000	Is such a fucking
7870000	7872000	Great game like it's just
7872000	7874000	I played through again
7874000	7876000	This week and it's just oh my god
7876000	7878000	Like the way I'm like talking to people
7878000	7880000	I was showing the game to Extifer and like
7880000	7882000	I was like yeah and that's another person and then
7882000	7884000	The person was like trying to like
7884000	7886000	Do the little singing to tell me
7886000	7888000	That there was a thing I was missing
7888000	7890000	In the little place where they were standing
7890000	7892000	And it was just I don't
7892000	7894000	I don't know how to explain it it's such an experience
7894000	7896000	I still need to play that game
7896000	7898000	You really do Journey is an outstanding game
7898000	7900000	It damn well may be my game of the year I'm not sure yet
7900000	7902000	Uh
7902000	7904000	Do you have any shocking moments?
7904000	7906000	Yes Loki shocking moments
7906000	7908000	I don't actually I was trying to think of something but
7908000	7910000	No
7910000	7912000	I have two interpretations of them
7912000	7914000	One of them Ryan reminded me of
7914000	7916000	The one that I have in mind
7916000	7918000	Literally shocking in terms of like
7918000	7920000	The frame one and two
7920000	7922000	To like an added effect
7922000	7924000	Really did have a pretty profound impact on me
7924000	7926000	I've always been weird when it comes to ghosts
7926000	7928000	And that kind of stuff and the whole
7928000	7930000	The lore and the situation
7930000	7932000	The sound the ambience that kind of stuff
7932000	7934000	Those games really creeped me out for a very long time
7934000	7936000	I could talk about this for hours but this is a
7936000	7938000	Three oh wait four hour show
7938000	7940000	The example that Ryan reminded me of
7940000	7942000	That's actually really true
7942000	7944000	Braid
7944000	7946000	Braid was an amazing game
7946000	7948000	Great platformer great everything
7948000	7950000	I absolutely loved it it's one of the few titles
7950000	7952000	That I've actually 100% achieved
7952000	7954000	And in general just sat down
7954000	7956000	And worked my way through with very
7956000	7958000	Little to distract me in between
7958000	7960000	Um but the story of it
7960000	7962000	Is also ridiculously profound
7962000	7964000	And the very last level of Braid
7964000	7966000	After you do all you get all of the puzzle
7966000	7968000	Pieces you put them all together and you
7968000	7970000	Do the final like unraveling
7970000	7972000	In technically world one
7972000	7974000	Um
7974000	7976000	How do I do this spoiler free
7976000	7978000	Um it's just the best representation
7978000	7980000	Of two sides of the story
7980000	7982000	That I've ever seen in gaming
7982000	7984000	And really in media in general
7984000	7986000	We have actdeft in our chatroom
7986000	7988000	At live.vognetwork.com says
7988000	7990000	Braid sucks I hate the game haters to the left
7990000	7992000	Alright
7992000	7994000	Uh Ry
7994000	7996000	We'll end this with you any shocking moments
7996000	7998000	Of course since I asked her
7998000	8000000	Back channel if she had any suggestions
8000000	8002000	I just took away her suggestion but that's okay
8002000	8004000	I was the one playing it anyway
8004000	8006000	Ha ha ha
8006000	8008000	Um
8008000	8010000	I mean I was happy that the fact
8010000	8012000	That Diablo 3 nothing got spoiled for me
8012000	8014000	So um things happening
8014000	8016000	In that one I was pretty surprised
8016000	8018000	With but
8018000	8020000	Antishock
8020000	8022000	The Diablo
8022000	8024000	Uh
8024000	8026000	Whimsishire the Diablo
8026000	8028000	Pinata there that's the word I'm looking for
8028000	8030000	My Diablo Pinata? What about it?
8030000	8032000	Oh it was hilarious to me
8032000	8034000	When I was going through Whimsishire and I found
8034000	8036000	The big Diablo Pinata
8036000	8038000	It's even more awesome when I broke it and I got
8038000	8040000	The Horadric hamburger
8040000	8042000	The Horadric hamburger
8042000	8044000	This very
8044000	8046000	Demonic you know undertone
8046000	8048000	Dark game and then you have Whimsishire
8048000	8050000	I mean that's classic Blizzard
8050000	8052000	It's beautiful but that was fun
8052000	8054000	Alright we're gonna move on with some more
8054000	8056000	News for you guys and of course emails coming up
8056000	8058000	As well as phone calls
8058000	8060000	Uh Loki
8060000	8062000	So there's already been hints that this was coming
8062000	8064000	But Valve has
8064000	8066000	Finally made it known
8066000	8068000	That they're gonna be rolling out
8068000	8070000	Other
8070000	8072000	Non-game software on Steam
8072000	8074000	Coming September 5th
8074000	8076000	And these will include other
8076000	8078000	Include I guess Steamworks functionality
8078000	8080000	Allowing automatic updating
8080000	8082000	And cloud storage
8082000	8084000	As well as other Steam features
8084000	8086000	And they have everything from like
8086000	8088000	Construction to accounting, animation
8088000	8090000	Design, illustration, photo editing
8090000	8092000	Software training, web publishing
8092000	8094000	Etc
8094000	8096000	So lots of stuff
8096000	8098000	Interesting and then of course
8098000	8100000	I guess titles will continue to hit
8100000	8102000	Steam after the initial
8102000	8104000	September 5th launch and they
8104000	8106000	I guess developers will be able to submit
8106000	8108000	Their perspective
8108000	8110000	Pieces of software via the
8110000	8112000	Steam Greenlight program
8112000	8114000	Did Steam just reinvent
8114000	8116000	The starter?
8116000	8118000	Um
8118000	8120000	Maybe
8120000	8122000	It's not
8122000	8124000	To their credit it's not hey
8124000	8126000	I want the game so I'll
8126000	8128000	Fund you this $5 but it's
8128000	8130000	More crowd sourcing the idea
8130000	8132000	In the first place
8132000	8134000	It has it's own potential but I'm sure in time
8134000	8136000	We'll see it's own demise, it's own draw
8136000	8138000	Not it's own demise, it's own drawbacks
8140000	8142000	Um
8142000	8144000	Kind of brings more light to a comment that was made
8144000	8146000	A couple weeks ago when we talked about
8146000	8148000	There was something where um
8148000	8150000	And it always seemed like a weird comparison
8150000	8152000	But Gabe Newell from Valve
8152000	8154000	Said something about yeah we were talking to
8154000	8156000	Adobe and trying to convince them that
8156000	8158000	Photoshop should be free and I think a lot
8158000	8160000	Of us were like alright whatever they were talking
8160000	8162000	And now we're like oh
8162000	8164000	That's why you would have had
8164000	8166000	Valve talking to Adobe because they're trying
8166000	8168000	To get some of that software on this new
8168000	8170000	Thing and they're trying to have the killer title
8170000	8172000	So that they're the additional
8172000	8174000	Content of the store is actually
8174000	8176000	Relevant to people
8176000	8178000	It's interesting do you think this could be successful?
8178000	8180000	Yeah definitely
8180000	8182000	I do too
8182000	8184000	They should make the entire suite free
8184000	8186000	And give it to me
8186000	8188000	Looking forward to that Steam holiday sale
8188000	8190000	Wait a minute didn't you say you didn't want Photoshop
8190000	8192000	To be free I seen you remember on that episode
8192000	8194000	I just want it free for me
8194000	8196000	Oh okay
8196000	8198000	Not free for all
8198000	8200000	Group of designers
8200000	8202000	That clears everything up thank you
8202000	8204000	And InDesign
8204000	8206000	Well this won't be free
8206000	8208000	In fact it will be $109 if you
8208000	8210000	Miss the Kickstarter
8210000	8212000	The oh yeah
8212000	8214000	The oh yeah
8214000	8216000	The oh yeah got funded and all that
8216000	8218000	Good stuff boy did they get funded
8218000	8220000	$8.5 million
8220000	8222000	It was supposed to raise
8222000	8224000	$950,000 which was a pretty lofty
8224000	8226000	Goal to begin with
8226000	8228000	$1 million in 8 hours
8228000	8230000	$8.5 million
8230000	8232000	After all was said and done when the Kickstarter closed
8232000	8234000	According to CEO
8234000	8236000	Julie Urman of the oh yeah
8236000	8238000	We've been blown away the whole time
8238000	8240000	So there you go
8240000	8242000	Also in news there
8242000	8244000	It's $109 like I said before
8244000	8246000	So it's a little bit more expensive
8246000	8248000	Than the $99 during the Kickstarter
8248000	8250000	It's $119 if you
8250000	8252000	Live in another place
8252000	8254000	Not the US somewhere foreign
8254000	8256000	You get the little console
8256000	8258000	You can pre-order it now
8258000	8260000	They're saying now delivery is expected to commence
8260000	8262000	In April of 2013
8262000	8264000	Is that because they're going to do the Kickstarter people in March?
8264000	8266000	Yes Interesting
8266000	8268000	So they're not just subtly
8268000	8270000	Rolling back the clock already
8270000	8272000	No they even said
8272000	8274000	To ensure that they can get the Kickstarter ones out first
8274000	8276000	Interesting
8276000	8278000	Also in oh yeah news
8278000	8280000	Four controllers will be supported and
8280000	8282000	Namco Bandai is in discussions
8282000	8284000	With the company
8284000	8286000	So I'm sure that just means oh hooray
8286000	8288000	Another re-release of all those Namco classics
8288000	8290000	Like Pac-Man
8290000	8292000	I think they were talking about Soul Calibur
8292000	8294000	The Android
8294000	8296000	Like how they have the
8296000	8298000	Slightly toned down versions for
8298000	8300000	Android and stuff
8300000	8302000	Interesting
8302000	8304000	Very interesting
8304000	8306000	And
8306000	8308000	Hopefully
8308000	8310000	Rich Racer
8310000	8312000	Although
8312000	8314000	I hope it's not Ridge Racer
8314000	8316000	Like it was on the Vita
8316000	8318000	Because that Ridge Racer sucked balls
8318000	8320000	Ridge Racer
8320000	8322000	That would be great if that could be a
8322000	8324000	Launch title
8324000	8326000	It does launch on every system
8326000	8328000	By the way I love this comment from Bobby Blackwolf
8328000	8330000	In our chat room
8330000	8332000	Namco Bandai in discussions
8332000	8334000	Indie game heaven
8334000	8336000	Remember how this console was going to be the indie console
8336000	8338000	It's going to be as good for indie games
8338000	8340000	As the Xbox is
8340000	8342000	Alright moving on
8342000	8344000	Dark Sakura
8344000	8346000	Well
8346000	8348000	Star Trek Infinite Space, I'm sure people
8348000	8350000	Saw all the ads all over Facebook for the beta
8350000	8352000	And everything, guess what?
8352000	8354000	Canceled, not going to happen
8354000	8356000	And they even, it was supposed to be set during
8356000	8358000	Deep Space Nine and they even got like
8358000	8360000	A bunch of the cast
8360000	8362000	From Deep Space Nine to lend their talents
8362000	8364000	And nope they couldn't
8364000	8366000	Get any funding
8366000	8368000	They couldn't find a publisher
8368000	8370000	So it's not happening
8370000	8372000	Sad face
8372000	8374000	The demise of MMOs
8374000	8376000	Has begun
8376000	8378000	No publisher for an MMO? How does that happen?
8378000	8380000	The fact that all Star Trek is right now is the Abrams movies
8380000	8382000	I really wish there would be a new series
8382000	8384000	Cry
8384000	8386000	As long as it's nothing like Enterprise
8386000	8388000	You know they have a
8388000	8390000	Kickstarter right now that actually has
8390000	8392000	Michael Dorn in it
8392000	8394000	Oh really?
8394000	8396000	It's a freaking Kickstarter
8396000	8398000	It's a Star Trek documentary
8398000	8400000	With Star Trek actors
8400000	8402000	Yeah
8402000	8404000	Because there haven't already been
8404000	8406000	At least two
8406000	8408000	Is Kickstarter Rule 35 now?
8408000	8410000	If it exists there's a Kickstarter for it?
8410000	8412000	Possibly actually
8412000	8414000	That's just what I got from
8414000	8416000	A couple of instances in this episode
8416000	8418000	Alright a few more news stories
8418000	8420000	For you guys and then we're going to get to the mailbag
8420000	8422000	And before too long the Skype line at
8422000	8424000	1-877-GAME-OLR
8424000	8426000	Or our username on Skype OrangeLoungeRadio
8426000	8428000	But first
8428000	8430000	Boy Rhode Island really put their money
8430000	8432000	In the wrong company
8432000	8434000	So 38 Studios
8434000	8436000	You know of course they kind of
8436000	8438000	Tumbled and failed
8438000	8440000	And yeah
8440000	8442000	So now Rhode Island owns
8442000	8444000	The rest of 38 Studios
8444000	8446000	Including the assets, the rights to the single player
8446000	8448000	Game that they put out
8448000	8450000	And of course their unfinished
8450000	8452000	MMO project
8452000	8454000	And now they're trying to sell off
8454000	8456000	These assets to recoup as much
8456000	8458000	Of the loan as possible
8458000	8460000	And so maybe
8460000	8462000	That means that we'll see a new Kingdoms of Amalur
8462000	8464000	Game
8464000	8466000	Or whatever it's going to be called
8466000	8468000	Because somebody will have to buy the rights inevitably
8468000	8470000	But it's going to go at bargain basement prices
8470000	8472000	Which is kind of too bad
8472000	8474000	Hey EA, you want another franchise?
8474000	8476000	The first game wasn't terrible
8476000	8478000	I don't know
8478000	8480000	Do you think that's what's going to happen?
8480000	8482000	Do you think EA will snatch it up?
8482000	8484000	Do you think anybody's going to be interested in this?
8484000	8486000	I think someone will snatch it up
8486000	8488000	I'm not sure if it's going to be EA
8488000	8490000	It could be Ubisoft or something, who knows
8490000	8492000	Well whenever that game comes out
8492000	8494000	One thing you could use to buy that game
8494000	8496000	Because you know it'll cost 60 plus dollars
8496000	8498000	Is trade in credit
8498000	8500000	In fact GameStop came out this week
8500000	8502000	And said that 70%
8502000	8504000	Of trade credit is spent on
8504000	8506000	New games
8506000	8508000	That's totally hurting the games industry
8508000	8510000	With all those used game sales
8510000	8512000	To me this is kind of a duh
8512000	8514000	This comes from
8514000	8516000	GameStop president
8516000	8518000	Paul Reines
8518000	8520000	Talked to Gamasutra
8520000	8522000	And basically said this in an interview
8522000	8524000	That was about the total sales numbers
8524000	8526000	And the $11 billion and so forth
8526000	8528000	And basically was talking about
8528000	8530000	Everybody always criticizes about used trade ins
8530000	8532000	But he said
8532000	8534000	We're really not cannibalizing new game sales
8534000	8536000	It's a common misconception
8536000	8538000	So my answer to developers is that we are driving growth
8538000	8540000	In a category that needs to grow
8540000	8542000	We think there's a real lack of awareness
8542000	8544000	As far as how trade ins are good for the industry
8544000	8546000	He may have a point in a way
8546000	8548000	Because yeah, this is so obvious to me
8548000	8550000	Because A, for one
8550000	8552000	GameStop gives you more money
8552000	8554000	For the games than they do for cash
8554000	8556000	Right?
8556000	8558000	And they give you more money when you're pre-ordering
8558000	8560000	They'll give you bonuses when you're pre-ordering
8560000	8562000	As well and kind of like reinvesting
8562000	8564000	Your money into the games that way
8564000	8566000	Games are fucking expensive
8566000	8568000	$60 for a new game
8568000	8570000	Is a lot of money
8570000	8572000	Exactly, and also that money can go
8572000	8574000	To points, cards, whatever
8574000	8576000	To buy more DLC
8576000	8578000	So that's why I never understood
8578000	8580000	These people like, well we need to get rid of the used game market
8580000	8582000	Yeah, go ahead and do that
8582000	8584000	And then you'll see your fucking numbers drop
8584000	8586000	Because no one's buying your games
8586000	8588000	Because one, they're fucking bitter at you for
8588000	8590000	Getting rid of used game sales
8590000	8592000	Or the campaign or DRM
8592000	8594000	That you're putting in place there
8594000	8596000	And B, they're not going to have the money to do it anymore
8596000	8598000	But my whole thing is
8598000	8600000	I just prefer to cut out the middle man
8600000	8602000	And sell him on eBay
8602000	8604000	Exactly
8604000	8606000	And use that money to buy whatever I want
8606000	8608000	A new video game or
8608000	8610000	Maybe my shiny new iPad
8610000	8612000	I understand, and sometimes
8612000	8614000	It's a matter of convenience
8614000	8616000	Sometimes you don't want to wait for that
8616000	8618000	Or you don't want to go through the hassle to do that
8618000	8620000	And the opportunity costs
8620000	8622000	And you can either get X amount of money now
8622000	8624000	Or you don't
8624000	8626000	And that's the thing about GameStop
8626000	8628000	Is when you go in there
8628000	8630000	At least that should be the way
8630000	8632000	You go in there, you say, okay here's the games I have
8632000	8634000	What will you give me for them?
8634000	8636000	If that's not satisfactory to you, sell them on eBay
8636000	8638000	I mean, you can figure
8638000	8640000	You can call them up
8640000	8642000	I don't know if you can call them up
8642000	8644000	But you can go down there and say, here's what I have
8644000	8646000	If that's not enough money for you
8646000	8648000	What are your game values?
8648000	8650000	Some games they do
8650000	8652000	I don't think they do for all of them
8652000	8654000	And I'm sure it will vary based on
8654000	8656000	The condition your games are in
8656000	8658000	It's not like they're forcing you to
8658000	8660000	Trade this stuff in
8660000	8662000	Sorry, you already gave it to us
8662000	8664000	You can't have your games back
8664000	8666000	They're not going to do that
8666000	8668000	Or even on top of that
8668000	8670000	You can take them to another game store
8670000	8672000	Not GameStop that also does trades
8672000	8674000	And ask them, hey what will you give me for this?
8674000	8676000	Figure out who's going to give you the best value
8676000	8678000	Rama in our chat room says
8678000	8680000	I don't trade in games
8680000	8682000	When I do, it'll never be GameStop
8682000	8684000	Well certainly other companies are trying to copy
8684000	8686000	What's happened with GameStop's success
8686000	8688000	I think Best Buy did it
8688000	8690000	I don't think they do it anymore
8690000	8692000	I think Amazon's still doing it though
8692000	8694000	Because Amazon's got everything
8694000	8696000	We already learned that
8696000	8698000	Best Buy still takes in trade-ins
8698000	8700000	The one that's close by us
8700000	8702000	They actually have a whole little station
8702000	8704000	With a counter set up
8704000	8706000	And somebody dedicated at that counter
8706000	8708000	I was not aware
8708000	8710000	I don't usually look into that here
8710000	8712000	And also too with GameStop now
8712000	8714000	What they're trying to do to get more people to trade in
8714000	8716000	Stuff is they don't just sell games anymore
8716000	8718000	They sell electronics, phones
8718000	8720000	But the nice thing about Amazon
8720000	8722000	Is that you can trade into games to Amazon
8722000	8724000	And then put that money towards a vibrating heating pad
8724000	8726000	As we learned about earlier in the show
8726000	8728000	Or alien space still though
8728000	8732000	If they have that, you know
8732000	8734000	You never know
8734000	8736000	Gonna trade in new Super Mario Brothers Wii
8736000	8738000	And get some hot Turian cock
8738000	8740000	Alright
8740000	8742000	Mmmmmmm
8742000	8744000	Don't make me make the noise, Rob
8744000	8746000	Alright, let's
8746000	8748000	I will make you make the noise
8748000	8750000	Of opening the mail
8750000	8752000	Oh, there you go, no more noise
8752000	8754000	Not that
8754000	8756000	How's that? Alright
8756000	8758000	Let's go to the mailbag
8762000	8764000	Every week, DarkSakura opens the mailbag
8764000	8766000	Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com
8766000	8768000	And read some of her favorite emails
8768000	8770000	For you right now
8770000	8772000	Sure
8772000	8774000	Okay
8774000	8776000	Um, this one's actually a contest
8776000	8778000	A contest
8778000	8780000	A contest?
8780000	8782000	A giveaway
8782000	8784000	And wants me to do it via email like this
8784000	8786000	In the email
8786000	8788000	There's lots of giveaways
8788000	8790000	My gosh, I've got a code I've got to try and give away at some point
8790000	8792000	And we also still have to pick the winner
8792000	8794000	For when Brad packs stuff
8794000	8796000	No, it's not
8796000	8798000	I saw that one in the mailbag earlier
8798000	8800000	I will read it
8800000	8802000	Hey, OLR crew, I apologize for intruding in your mailbag segment
8802000	8804000	But I would like to give away a PlayStation Network game code
8804000	8806000	To one of your live listeners in the U.S. Canada
8806000	8808000	Of Puerto Rico
8808000	8810000	The code is for
8810000	8812000	Dazimon Kids

8814000	8816000	The let's play
8816000	8818000	I should keep it, never mind, no I'm kidding
8818000	8820000	So the let's players design their own levels
8820000	8822000	Just to keep this contest simple
8822000	8824000	I would like for the lovely DarkSakura
8824000	8826000	Or equivalent sassy mail host
8826000	8828000	To say
8828000	8830000	Hey
8830000	8832000	To say the code at the end of this email
8832000	8834000	And leave it to the first listener
8834000	8836000	Who can claim the code to win
8836000	8838000	Dazimon Kids can be played on a PS3, PSP
8838000	8840000	Or in the near future, Vita
8840000	8842000	The code can be redeemed from the PlayStation Store
8842000	8844000	App on a console
8844000	8846000	Or at account.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com
8846000	8848000	Good luck to everyone
8848000	8850000	This comes from the Nasty Canasta
8850000	8852000	I love that name
8852000	8854000	So are you ready?
8854000	8856000	Get your pencils, get your keyboards ready
8856000	8858000	Get a free game, here you go
8858000	8860000	Picture pages, picture pages, time to get you
8860000	8862000	Nobody gets picture pages?
8862000	8864000	Bite me
8864000	8868000	T-H-P-N
8868000	8872000	P-L-N-P
8872000	8874000	T-M-N-3
8874000	8876000	There you go
8876000	8878000	Not saying it again
8878000	8880000	I want to know who wins it
8880000	8882000	Alright, next email
8882000	8884000	Yeah
8884000	8886000	Um, this
8888000	8890000	I had to laugh, I had to laugh
8890000	8892000	There's a kickstarter to do Cheetamen 2
8892000	8894000	So that they're fixing it to make it playable
8894000	8896000	This is Konami Be Ashamed
8896000	8900000	Oh, I'm not even gonna bother
8902000	8904000	Okay
8904000	8906000	The subject of this one is Trainer
8906000	8908000	Dear DarkSakura, which would offend you more?
8908000	8912000	Me saying Samantha Trainer is a hotter piece of ass than Garos Vakarian
8912000	8914000	Or
8914000	8916000	There's a link
8916000	8918000	Says this
8918000	8920000	This being the song Windows Down by Big Time Rush
8920000	8922000	This song that samples Song 2 by Blur
8922000	8924000	And if by sample you mean rips off completely in ruins
8924000	8926000	Ugh
8926000	8928000	And that's Stay Black Entertainment
8928000	8930000	Um
8930000	8932000	Well given that I can't actually listen to it
8932000	8934000	Because I have the sound off
8934000	8936000	Um
8936000	8938000	Well
8938000	8940000	If Damon Auburn sued the crap out of Big Time Rush
8940000	8942000	Then that's okay
8942000	8944000	Um, Samantha Trainer is just annoying
8944000	8946000	And everyone's entitled to their own opinion
8946000	8948000	I would say she's a hot piece of ass for what it's worth
8948000	8950000	The shower scene
8950000	8952000	Like, I'm gay
8952000	8954000	And I still kind of get a semi on that shower scene
8954000	8956000	It's really hot
8956000	8958000	She wasn't even naked
8958000	8960000	What's up? Who showers in their bra?
8964000	8966000	Motherfuck
8966000	8968000	Moving on
8968000	8970000	Cock teases
8972000	8974000	Given that this is a lesbian shower scene
8974000	8976000	Would it be a clit tease?
8976000	8978000	It'd be doubly hot because there's lesbians involved
8978000	8980000	Yeah, but Shepard wasn't even naked
8980000	8982000	Or in her undies
8982000	8984000	It's called, they didn't want the game to have an AO rating
8984000	8986000	So she had a bra on
8986000	8988000	I think it should
8988000	8990000	It's like Showgirls on VH1
8990000	8992000	Have you ever watched
8992000	8994000	I posted something on Tumblr a while back
8994000	8996000	And if someone can
8996000	8998000	If you can find it on my Tumblr, relink it
8998000	9000000	It's the romance scenes in Mass Effect 2
9000000	9002000	Done with fly cam
9002000	9004000	So you can see all the little rendering cheats
9004000	9006000	That they did and like how Garrus' hand goes
9006000	9008000	Like right through the middle of her chest and everything
9008000	9010000	And it's really funny
9010000	9012000	Calima
9012000	9014000	Yeah, I know
9014000	9016000	Hey, OLR, I'm writing you from my phone
9016000	9018000	So please excuse my lack of form slash grammar
9018000	9020000	Slash bad spelling
9020000	9022000	Lack of bad spelling? Why would I complain?
9022000	9024000	Or anything else that relates to improper use of the English language
9024000	9026000	It looks like Rama says
9026000	9028000	He got it, by the way
9028000	9030000	That code earlier
9030000	9032000	And Black Wolf says, well sorry podcast listeners
9032000	9034000	Guess you aren't a part of this
9034000	9036000	Well, how about this
9036000	9038000	This is your code
9038000	9040000	And this is a code for
9040000	9042000	Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet
9042000	9044000	Oh, I can't do it this way
9044000	9046000	Because then somebody who's listening live
9046000	9048000	Is gonna go to the podcast as soon as it comes out
9048000	9050000	And pull this code out of it
9050000	9052000	So I have to think of a way to give this code away
9052000	9054000	I have a code for Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet
9054000	9056000	That was generously donated by Pika Uno
9056000	9058000	Email
9058000	9060000	Random picked email
9060000	9062000	Random picked email? Alright, fair enough
9062000	9064000	Send an email
9064000	9066000	The 15th
9066000	9068000	Alright, send an email
9068000	9070000	To mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com
9070000	9072000	And tell us how jealous
9072000	9074000	You are
9074000	9076000	That the live listeners get all the good giveaways
9076000	9078000	Tell us about your insane jealousy
9078000	9080000	And you may win Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet
9080000	9082000	We will give it to
9082000	9084000	The
9084000	9086000	What, 15th person email
9086000	9088000	Or whoever's the most fucked up
9088000	9090000	No, because you can't say that's too vague
9090000	9092000	You have to have a definitive answer
9092000	9094000	It's gonna be the 15th email
9094000	9096000	And if for whatever reason 15 people don't email us
9096000	9098000	We'll randomly draw one
9098000	9100000	Then we'll randomly draw one
9100000	9102000	So there you go
9102000	9104000	Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet on the Xbox 360
9104000	9106000	Just for the podcast listeners
9106000	9108000	There's one they can participate in
9108000	9110000	Can I finish reading this? Yes
9110000	9112000	I have two questions for you tonight
9112000	9114000	First, is there a way to stream the show
9114000	9116000	From an Android device
9116000	9118000	And if so, how does one go about setting that up?
9118000	9120000	Well, first of all, you sell your phone and get an iPhone
9120000	9122000	Stop, stop
9122000	9124000	To stream the show via an Android device
9124000	9126000	Go to vognetwork.com
9126000	9128000	The good news is, the website's in HTML5
9128000	9130000	So you actually should be able to
9130000	9132000	And this works just for the record on iPhone as well
9132000	9134000	You should be able to go to the site
9134000	9136000	And just hit play
9136000	9138000	And it'll work
9138000	9140000	If for whatever reason that doesn't work
9140000	9142000	There is an app, and I know it's on iPhone
9142000	9144000	I'm pretty sure they wrote this for Android as well
9144000	9146000	It's called TuneIn
9146000	9148000	And that will allow you to listen live
9148000	9150000	If you've been here last night from the gym
9150000	9152000	Yes, by the way, I joined a gym
9152000	9154000	Which is a whole other story I'll have to get into at some point
9154000	9156000	But actually, listen to the conversation live
9156000	9158000	On TuneIn
9158000	9160000	So, I don't recall ever hearing anything
9160000	9162000	About how one goes to set this up
9162000	9164000	One email per person, you smartass listeners
9164000	9166000	I will check your IP
9166000	9168000	I don't recall ever hearing anything
9168000	9170000	About streaming since you switched to VoG
9170000	9172000	Please provide any
9172000	9174000	Okay, we already did all that
9174000	9176000	Second, what do you believe to be the main cause of rhythm gaming
9176000	9178000	And we'll be seeing a return to the genre soon
9178000	9180000	Well, anything that goes down has to come back up
9180000	9184000	Some people attribute it to Guitar Hero oversaturating the market
9184000	9186000	While others point the finger at Rock Band
9186000	9188000	For their spamming of DLC
9188000	9190000	Which separates friends who have more money
9190000	9192000	To spend on games than others
9192000	9194000	Who don't necessarily have as much disposable income
9194000	9198000	I've been playing Guitar Hero since the third one
9198000	9200000	And Rock Band since Rock Band 2
9200000	9202000	And I've watched the community decline steadily
9202000	9204000	And now it's a very small and tight-knit community
9204000	9206000	That's all fine and dandy
9206000	9208000	Because you get closer with a regular group of friends
9208000	9210000	But now it's a sad state of affairs
9210000	9212000	Because neither Guitar Hero nor Rock Band
9212000	9214000	Have any games coming out
9214000	9216000	I'm not counting Blitz because it's not a main series game
9216000	9218000	I have an answer
9218000	9220000	Stubbornness killed the music game franchise
9220000	9224000	Konami's unwillingness to support the franchise killed it
9224000	9226000	We went how many years without a DDR game
9226000	9228000	In the arcades
9228000	9230000	And one might say, oh well arcades were dying
9230000	9232000	Or oh well it wasn't successful enough
9232000	9234000	So they would have made another bull to the shit
9234000	9236000	Because the problem with that logic
9236000	9238000	Is that you're pretending
9238000	9240000	That America didn't import
9240000	9242000	All of those games
9242000	9244000	Like did you know you're not supposed to have
9244000	9246000	A Max 2 in America
9246000	9248000	That was never released
9248000	9250000	Max never released
9250000	9252000	Extreme never released
9252000	9254000	That's the problem
9254000	9256000	Konami of Japan did not believe in the franchise
9256000	9258000	And when they would make the games here
9258000	9260000	Most of the time they were half-assed
9260000	9262000	When they were coming from Konami of Japan
9262000	9264000	There were two people
9264000	9266000	Slash groups that believed
9266000	9268000	In Dance Dance Revolution
9268000	9270000	And the Bomani series in general at Konami
9270000	9272000	One of them was Jason Enos
9272000	9274000	Without him you would have never had
9274000	9276000	These games in the first place
9276000	9278000	And what we did get in America
9278000	9280000	And on the Playstation releases and so forth
9280000	9282000	The other was Konami of Hawaii
9282000	9284000	Which unfortunately their first release on the Xbox
9284000	9286000	Wasn't
9286000	9288000	I get the sense maybe
9288000	9290000	They didn't have as much freedom with that first game
9290000	9292000	Because again the later Xbox games
9292000	9294000	Ultramix 2 and Ultramix 3
9294000	9296000	That's the shit that should have been in the arcades
9296000	9298000	Those would have been great
9298000	9300000	American DDR releases
9300000	9302000	And we say this with our own
9302000	9304000	Personal bias having been in the scene
9304000	9306000	As long as we have been but
9306000	9308000	Isn't VR pretty
9308000	9310000	Wildly
9310000	9312000	Popular in the arcades with the
9312000	9314000	Ones that actually have X and X2
9314000	9316000	I mean I'm not
9316000	9318000	Out of the scene I have not been playing the game anymore
9318000	9320000	And if I'm gonna pick anything
9320000	9322000	I'm gonna go back to basically Extreme and Below
9322000	9324000	And a couple of gyms from afterwards
9324000	9326000	But let's not kid ourselves
9326000	9328000	Isn't DDR still doing pretty
9328000	9330000	Damn good now that it actually has an American
9330000	9332000	Song list? Well enough
9332000	9334000	I think although the home releases seem
9334000	9336000	To have dried up I think actually
9336000	9338000	Americanizing the song listed too much
9338000	9340000	Is kind of because the whole point of DDR
9340000	9342000	Was you take songs that are good
9342000	9344000	But people might
9344000	9346000	Take you to new music
9346000	9348000	Now I think the whole licensing with all the synth pop
9348000	9350000	Stuff was pretty awesome
9350000	9352000	But I loved a lot of Dance Mania stuff
9352000	9354000	Because it's like okay I recognize that song is kind of
9354000	9356000	A remix you know
9356000	9358000	Oh this is kind of a neat take of this song
9358000	9360000	Or this is a unique song I've never heard of from a Korean artist
9360000	9362000	Or something like that or the song we played before
9362000	9364000	The show I was like dude that'd be a perfect DDR
9364000	9366000	Song nowadays
9366000	9368000	I would definitely tend to agree
9368000	9370000	That DDR
9370000	9372000	Introducing me to Dance Mania is probably one of the best things
9372000	9374000	Like my last decade of music
9374000	9376000	Just lastly real quick I'm sorry
9376000	9378000	The last thing I want to say on this is that the other thing
9378000	9380000	That really screwed them
9380000	9382000	Guitar Hero was only a rampant success
9382000	9384000	Because Konami was too stubborn to realize
9384000	9386000	Those games would work here and they would have never paid
9386000	9388000	For the licensing and the case
9388000	9390000	I mean who made the first Guitar Hero
9390000	9392000	Harmonics
9392000	9394000	But who did they team up with to get that done
9394000	9396000	Who planted the seed
9396000	9398000	Great Red Octane
9398000	9400000	What started Red Octane
9400000	9402000	What kind of company was Red Octane
9402000	9404000	DDR Pads and Guitar Freaks
9404000	9406000	Third Party Guitar Freak Controllers
9406000	9408000	And these mysterious Third Party Guitar Freaks Controllers
9408000	9410000	With five buttons
9410000	9412000	The Saga Red Octane for us is pretty sad
9412000	9414000	My Guitar Freaks Controllers were in the background
9414000	9416000	When we did the thing at my house
9416000	9418000	With the news
9418000	9420000	And what happened when Rock Revolution came out
9420000	9422000	It was dismissed as a shitty ass Guitar Hero
9422000	9424000	Clone and why
9424000	9426000	The song list sucked butthole
9426000	9428000	Because it was a bunch of bad covers
9428000	9430000	And that was a very clear indication
9430000	9432000	That Konami of Japan was not willing
9432000	9434000	To put the investment or the risk
9434000	9436000	And in order to get rewards
9436000	9438000	You have to take a risk
9438000	9440000	Konami of Japan was not willing to do that
9440000	9442000	Therefore, Bimani died
9442000	9444000	To finish reading the email
9444000	9446000	Go ahead
9446000	9448000	This will spiral out of control
9448000	9450000	Because I have a few
9450000	9452000	Agreements and disagreements
9452000	9454000	Those of us who are still playing regularly
9454000	9456000	New instruments
9456000	9458000	Because all of ours keep breaking over time
9458000	9460000	Due to where we weren't able to find them
9460000	9462000	Anywhere short of eBay for less than $100
9462000	9464000	For a damn guitar
9464000	9466000	Dimple
9466000	9468000	It's a used movie
9468000	9470000	And game and records and stuff
9470000	9472000	I find guitars there all the time on the cheap
9472000	9474000	And usually in great condition
9474000	9476000	And all of mine are still in perfect shape
9476000	9478000	Because you have to clean them out
9478000	9480000	And take good care of them
9480000	9482000	But other than that
9482000	9484000	Thanks for answering, sorry for ranting
9484000	9486000	Listen live at work tonight
9486000	9488000	Brownie, that's it
9488000	9490000	The only thing I wanted to interject is that
9490000	9492000	As far as I know, Rock Revolution
9492000	9494000	Was a mostly
9494000	9496000	Japanese
9496000	9498000	Developed, you know, license
9498000	9500000	Acquisition was responsible
9500000	9502000	By the Japanese Konami
9502000	9504000	Outfit
9504000	9506000	The music culture in Japan is
9506000	9508000	Ridiculously different from America
9508000	9510000	And so for them to take that
9510000	9512000	Something original
9512000	9514000	Put it on us
9514000	9516000	Put it on the common American base
9516000	9518000	And be surprised at the failure
9518000	9520000	To me
9520000	9522000	From the limited amount of knowledge that I have
9522000	9524000	It already makes sense that I could just say
9524000	9526000	Well, you're not making an American game
9526000	9528000	You're making a Japanese game and pushing it in America
9528000	9530000	And something as cultural as music
9530000	9532000	That's a pretty big deal
9532000	9534000	Alright, anyway
9534000	9536000	We could spend more time talking about this
9536000	9538000	But we did already spend five years talking about it
9538000	9540000	So, was that it for emails?
9540000	9542000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
9542000	9544000	If you want to send us an email
9544000	9546000	In the future
9546000	9548000	I guess what's funny
9548000	9550000	Because the live listeners are complaining that the stream went down
9550000	9552000	Which is weird because I don't see the time out
9552000	9554000	That usually comes up when that happens
9554000	9556000	But I guess maybe a little hiccup
9556000	9558000	I guess what happened, I said
9558000	9560000	Bamani died, and as soon as I said died
9560000	9562000	Is when the stream went down
9562000	9564000	It's almost like the watchful eye
9564000	9566000	Of Konami Japan just fucking pulled the plug
9566000	9568000	On my internet when I said that
9568000	9570000	How dare you
9570000	9572000	But we know it's just because Comcast sucks
9572000	9574000	After the mailbag comes the FUs of the week
9574000	9576000	So let us get a little bit ranty
9592000	9594000	We usually start the FUs with Dark Sakura
9594000	9596000	But she ran out of the studio for a minute
9596000	9598000	So I'll start with the other lady
9598000	9600000	We'll let the other lady's first night
9600000	9602000	Alright, do you have an FU of the week tonight?
9602000	9604000	I don't think I do right now
9606000	9608000	FU for being too nice
9608000	9610000	I might think of something
9610000	9612000	Alright, then how about Jason?
9612000	9614000	The other half
9614000	9616000	FU for getting a coat
9616000	9618000	And anything else at home
9618000	9620000	Because it was ridiculously cold in the bay last night
9620000	9622000	It sucked to walk
9622000	9624000	Fuck the bay
9624000	9626000	Five degrees here and you're like
9626000	9628000	I need a jacket
9628000	9630000	And I think I had something else
9630000	9632000	But, eh
9632000	9634000	Uh, Loki
9634000	9636000	Uh, FU being burnt out at work
9636000	9638000	Uh, my FU of the week
9638000	9640000	Goes to my abs
9640000	9642000	And Extifer for showing me
9642000	9644000	That little ab machine
9644000	9646000	Extifer convinced me to join a gym
9646000	9648000	There's a lot to be inspired about with Extifer
9648000	9650000	Because Extifer used to be a big boy
9650000	9652000	And he lost
9652000	9654000	A lot of weight
9654000	9656000	Through a pretty intense program at the gym
9656000	9658000	Over the course of like a year
9658000	9660000	So I just, I don't know
9660000	9662000	I'm kind of at the point where I'm like, you know, I would like to lose a few pounds too
9662000	9664000	Um, so
9664000	9666000	I joined a gym
9666000	9668000	And he showed me how to use the little ab machine
9668000	9670000	And it really hurt the next day
9670000	9672000	These things are evil aren't they
9674000	9676000	Also, FU'd that
9676000	9678000	It's not a Stairmaster
9678000	9680000	But it's like this escalator that never ends
9680000	9682000	That type of thing
9682000	9684000	That thing's a little fucker
9684000	9686000	Alright, and
9686000	9688000	What gym are you going to?
9688000	9690000	24 hour
9690000	9692000	Oh, I'm so sorry
9692000	9694000	I had a better experience there than the one you were recommending previously
9694000	9696000	But that's alright
9696000	9698000	Different strokes for different folks
9698000	9700000	Well, um, my FU
9700000	9702000	First of all, these tips are fucking delicious
9702000	9704000	But hot, but peppery
9704000	9706000	And, um
9706000	9708000	The car accident, my lower back for hurting
9708000	9710000	A bitch after my adjustment
9710000	9712000	Um, and
9712000	9714000	The rental car that I have
9714000	9716000	I like that the stereo has the Bluetooth hookup
9716000	9718000	For the phone
9718000	9720000	But I miss my car and I don't like being
9720000	9722000	Blown around like a leaf in the wind
9722000	9724000	On the freeway because it's so lightweight
9724000	9726000	I would rather
9726000	9728000	Have had a Corolla S than a baseline
9728000	9730000	Corolla, I feel like I'm driving a mommy car
9730000	9732000	Oh yeah, one more
9732000	9734000	FU'd a BurgerTime
9734000	9736000	For reminding me of how bad I suck
9736000	9738000	At classic arcade games
9738000	9740000	And viewing angles
9740000	9742000	Alright, Tigerclaw
9742000	9744000	In our chatroom asks a very good question
9744000	9746000	This is a very good question about the whole gym thing
9746000	9748000	Tigerclaw says, Rob, when you went to the gym
9748000	9750000	When you went into the gym, it wasn't intimidating
9750000	9752000	And I have to admit, that's part of what held
9752000	9754000	Me back for the longest time
9754000	9756000	The whole
9756000	9758000	Doing that in public type of thing
9758000	9760000	People looking at each other in the gym
9760000	9762000	I was a little weirded out
9762000	9764000	By that whole thing at first, which is why
9764000	9766000	For the longest time, I wouldn't go
9766000	9768000	But finally, it just
9768000	9770000	Kind of hit me, like this whole thing
9770000	9772000	What am I going to see any of these
9772000	9774000	Assholes outside the gym
9774000	9776000	I'm not going to see these people anywhere else
9776000	9778000	Whatever, I'm just going to go and be in my
9778000	9780000	Own little world and listen to my headphones
9780000	9782000	And if these people want to stare, then let them stare
9782000	9784000	Because I'm hot
9784000	9786000	And that's pretty much where I ended up with
9786000	9788000	Also, it really helped that when I went to the gym for the first time
9788000	9790000	I definitely saw people uglier than me
9790000	9792000	And that helped a lot actually
9792000	9794000	In a very superficial kind of way
9794000	9796000	Right? Am I right, Jamie?
9796000	9798000	It's a relief to go in the gym and see people uglier than you, right?
9798000	9800000	Sometimes
9800000	9802000	But the gym that I go to
9802000	9804000	Actually has a lot of
9804000	9806000	Track and ROT
9806000	9808000	ROTC people there
9808000	9810000	But they're doing the harder intensity stuff
9810000	9812000	And I'm like, I'm just going to walk over here
9812000	9814000	Thank you. I do the rowing machine now, though
9814000	9816000	Tigerclaw says
9816000	9818000	Or nervous, because you walk in there and you see
9818000	9820000	A bunch of muscle-bound dudes working out
9820000	9822000	And they see a weakling walking to the gym
9822000	9824000	Hey!
9824000	9826000	Why did you just call me?
9826000	9828000	Um
9828000	9830000	No, I don't
9830000	9832000	But if the muscle-bound dudes are looking at me
9832000	9834000	And they're judging me
9834000	9836000	Then they're checking me out
9836000	9838000	And that's their issue
9838000	9840000	Sorry, I'm hot
9840000	9842000	Well, you know what I would do
9842000	9844000	Dan has a big thing for the circuit training
9844000	9846000	They have this big circle thing where they do circuit training
9846000	9848000	I go hang out in the dude section and lift weights
9848000	9850000	Because
9850000	9852000	I have a weak ankle
9852000	9854000	And I can't really do much of that
9854000	9856000	So I just go lift weights with the dudes
9856000	9858000	And I get weird looks, but I don't care
9858000	9860000	Fuck them!
9860000	9862000	There just comes a point in your life where you just
9862000	9864000	I'm really not interested in them, thank you
9864000	9866000	There just comes a point in your life where you have to say
9866000	9868000	Hi, haters! You know?
9868000	9870000	And just deal with it
9870000	9872000	Deal with me
9872000	9874000	Monty Boggs says
9874000	9876000	A new challenger approaches
9876000	9878000	I don't want to talk it up too much
9878000	9880000	Because I just started
9880000	9882000	Literally last week
9882000	9884000	And the last time I joined a gym
9884000	9886000	I went once
9886000	9888000	So I never went again
9888000	9890000	But this time I'm hoping for better results
9890000	9892000	So I'll be more excited about this
9892000	9894000	If I'm still going in two months
9894000	9896000	I'll let you know how it goes
9896000	9898000	Hopefully my abs will stop hurting
9898000	9900000	Because that machine is evil
9900000	9902000	I already got a text message from Christopher today
9902000	9904000	So, did you go?
9904000	9906000	And I'm like, yes, I went on Saturday night
9906000	9908000	Thank you very much
9908000	9910000	I'm a real winner, I go to the gym
9910000	9912000	On Saturday night, I didn't go to the club
9912000	9914000	I went to the gym
9914000	9916000	And then pizza on Sunday
9916000	9918000	And then I ate so much pizza on Sunday
9918000	9920000	But see, here's the thing, Jason
9920000	9922000	I would have eaten that pizza anyway
9922000	9924000	So
9924000	9926000	Alright
9926000	9928000	There's usually a good diet to go along
9928000	9930000	With these kind of things, but eh
9930000	9932000	Dark Tetsuya says instead of listening
9932000	9934000	To USL, no, I listen
9934000	9936000	I just said, the TuneIn app, I listen to the first
9936000	9938000	Hour of USL from the gym
9938000	9940000	I know that Dark Sakura talked about the
9940000	9942000	Rocky rehearsal, and I know that Travis talked
9942000	9944000	At length about the Mars landing
9944000	9946000	And how happy he was about that whole thing
9946000	9948000	And how he made the graphics during OLR
9948000	9950000	Ha! Alright
9950000	9952000	Anyhow
9952000	9954000	Someone needs to take these chips away from me, they're freaking good
9954000	9956000	Okay
9958000	9960000	Yes
9960000	9962000	Someone in chat was asking your chips
9962000	9964000	What brand and such they were
9964000	9966000	I told them, but it's Trader Joe's rice and bean
9966000	9968000	Chips with adzuki beans
9968000	9970000	And they're very peppery
9970000	9972000	Alright, let's do it, it's already past 9 o'clock
9972000	9974000	And we haven't even gotten to calls
9974000	9976000	So let's do these last few stories pretty quickly here
9976000	9978000	And I've got to do
9978000	9980000	I've got to do Twitter topics as well here
9980000	9982000	So, Loki
9982000	9984000	So, more Zinga news
9984000	9986000	Of course they're worried that people are
9986000	9988000	Flocking away from the company
9988000	9990000	They're going to try to retain some of those employees
9990000	9992000	They're giving them free stock
9992000	9994000	Free, worthless stock
9998000	10000000	Fantastic
10000000	10002000	There were some of those stories out there on one of those websites
10002000	10004000	I can't remember the name, but some of the stories from actual employees
10004000	10006000	And just about how the stock
10006000	10008000	That they were given to work those long hours
10008000	10010000	Is just plummeted
10010000	10012000	It's actually kind of sad
10012000	10014000	Because as much as I can't stand Zinga
10014000	10016000	And the games they put out
10016000	10018000	That's not a problem I have with
10018000	10020000	The line level employees
10020000	10022000	So to speak
10022000	10024000	The people that are actually doing the art
10024000	10026000	Or the programming
10026000	10028000	It's the way that company is managed
10028000	10030000	And the way they make some decisions
10030000	10032000	I bet there's some very talented people at Zinga
10032000	10034000	That would like to do something original
10034000	10036000	I know there's some talented people there
10036000	10038000	Some of my friends work there
10038000	10040000	And they're very talented individuals and artists
10040000	10042000	But I can't see their talent being utilized
10042000	10044000	At all at this company
10044000	10046000	Which is why I kind of feel bad
10046000	10048000	Everyone talks about how evil they are
10048000	10050000	Which is an evil company
10050000	10052000	It's not necessarily
10052000	10054000	It's not like those artists are evil
10054000	10056000	Or the programmers are evil
10056000	10058000	It's just that the decisions are evil
10058000	10060000	So there you go
10060000	10062000	Alright, is that it for that story?
10062000	10064000	Wow that was quick
10064000	10066000	I said quick and you said you did it
10066000	10068000	Alright then lastly I'll do this one real quick
10068000	10070000	This is an eBay, this was brought up earlier
10070000	10072000	An eBay auction that has a lot of people turning their heads
10072000	10074000	This is a guy who's basically selling his whole damn life
10074000	10076000	On eBay for 3.5 million
10076000	10078000	A 29 year old
10078000	10080000	Who owns, which first off
10080000	10082000	Props to him for establishing
10082000	10084000	3.5 million dollars worth of stuff
10084000	10086000	At age 29
10086000	10088000	I'm older than 29
10088000	10090000	And I'm not even worth a tenth of that
10090000	10092000	I think I saw
10092000	10094000	On a website the other day
10094000	10096000	OrangeLoungeRadio.com is valued at about
10096000	10098000	$1500
10098000	10100000	Yes
10100000	10102000	This guy made 3.5
10102000	10104000	Or asking 3.5 million
10104000	10106000	I could ask $1000
10106000	10108000	And I'd have to split that three ways
10108000	10110000	Really four
10110000	10112000	Because it's Jason's site
10112000	10114000	And Deep Man designed it
10114000	10116000	Five
10116000	10118000	Anyhow
10118000	10120000	All kidding aside
10120000	10122000	This guy is selling on eBay
10122000	10124000	$3.5 million dollars
10124000	10126000	His entire
10126000	10128000	Basically assets
10128000	10130000	His automobiles, the collectibles and so forth
10130000	10132000	He's the owner of R.U. Game
10132000	10134000	Which is an independent retailer
10134000	10136000	It's in Gainesville, Tampa
10136000	10138000	And Brandon, Florida
10138000	10140000	We have a couple listeners in Florida, I don't know if there's any in that area
10140000	10142000	But he owns these few stores
10142000	10144000	And I love the little
10144000	10146000	Derpy Mario that's in the videos
10146000	10148000	There's like this guy in a Derp Derp Mario costume
10148000	10150000	Whatever, anyway
10150000	10152000	He says he'll even hang around for six months to help the
10152000	10154000	New owner, he didn't really say why
10154000	10156000	He's doing it, it might have been in the video
10156000	10158000	But I wasn't going to watch the whole thing
10158000	10160000	It's because he wants to just start his next thing
10160000	10162000	Or whatever that is
10162000	10164000	So it's like I want to start my life over
10164000	10166000	We are starting over
10166000	10168000	Maybe he's Buddhist
10168000	10170000	Maybe, who knows
10170000	10172000	But anyway, he's selling the whole thing off
10172000	10174000	No words yet if there are any serious bidders or whatever
10174000	10176000	But you know what, I say hats off to this guy
10176000	10178000	Because a lot of people think it's fake
10178000	10180000	And it's just for publicity
10180000	10182000	And in which case I say, hats off to you dude
10182000	10184000	Because you got covered on every game
10184000	10186000	Blog this week with this little story
10186000	10188000	And you know this industry
10188000	10190000	They need to run something every day
10190000	10192000	On the websites
10192000	10194000	So this was like the best commercial you could ever
10194000	10196000	Not buy
10196000	10198000	I tip my hat to you
10198000	10200000	Doesn't RU Games
10200000	10202000	Sound like it might be like a place to buy
10202000	10204000	Russian import games though
10204000	10206000	Like when I first saw the name I kind of thought
10206000	10208000	Oh, RU Games, it's like a Russian game store
10208000	10210000	I thought that that's
10210000	10212000	I didn't think of a stupid Facebook game
10212000	10214000	It's an industry that works with these types of stores
10214000	10216000	You would not believe how many
10216000	10218000	Generic sounding game stores are out there
10218000	10220000	It's like, yeah
10220000	10222000	I'd like to make my game store
10222000	10224000	It's called
10224000	10226000	Well, I'm trying to remember
10226000	10228000	It's like
10228000	10230000	It's something like GameStop
10230000	10232000	But it wasn't GameStop, it was very close
10232000	10234000	Game yield
10234000	10236000	Game go, go game
10236000	10238000	No, it was like
10238000	10240000	Go GameStop
10240000	10242000	Something like that
10242000	10244000	Why are you naming?
10244000	10246000	Go GameStop, that's kind of
10246000	10248000	Video game center
10248000	10250000	Game store
10250000	10252000	The game place
10252000	10254000	I named the game store the Danone, did you know that?
10254000	10256000	Oh really? Game on
10256000	10258000	That ended up being a show, right?
10258000	10260000	Well this was years ago
10260000	10262000	Game shop
10262000	10264000	I've seen that
10264000	10266000	There's game trader that uses the same
10266000	10268000	Text and colors
10268000	10270000	Monty Boggs in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
10270000	10272000	Answered the question
10272000	10274000	Yes, I am game, are you movie?
10274000	10276000	Laughs
10276000	10278000	I'm sorry
10278000	10280000	I found that response to be hilarious
10280000	10282000	Like I just want to walk
10282000	10284000	Into the store, why yes I am game
10284000	10286000	Are you movie? Well here's the thing too
10286000	10288000	He's even admitted, even if it doesn't sell
10288000	10290000	Or he doesn't get a
10290000	10292000	Buyer for it, it's great advertising for my
10292000	10294000	Store, because he got all these
10294000	10296000	Blogs talking about this store
10296000	10298000	So he could
10298000	10300000	Props to you and your derpy ass Mario
10300000	10302000	Mascot guy
10302000	10304000	Laughs
10306000	10308000	You know Nintendo might see that
10308000	10310000	And get a little upset
10310000	10312000	Just saying
10312000	10314000	I'll see derpy Mario fight
10314000	10316000	Mario Mascot
10316000	10318000	Laughs
10318000	10320000	Maybe in the next Smash Brothers
10320000	10322000	Dr. Mario vs.
10322000	10324000	Derpy Mario
10324000	10326000	Laughs
10326000	10328000	Laughs
10328000	10330000	Laughs
10330000	10332000	Oh my god mushrooms, oh my god
10332000	10334000	Mr. Derpy Mario
10334000	10336000	Oh my god mushrooms
10336000	10338000	If that doesn't just epitomize this episode
10338000	10340000	Oh my god first floor
10340000	10342000	Oh my god Zelda chic
10342000	10344000	Laughs
10344000	10346000	Sigh

10364000	10366000	I'll do a couple of these quick tweets here
10366000	10368000	Let's see
10368000	10370000	Gamer girl was responding a little late to the
10370000	10372000	Facebook question on Twitter
10372000	10374000	I think she's being ironic
10374000	10376000	First game that ever shocked me was God
10376000	10378000	of War when you go into the ships cabin
10378000	10380000	And you get to do the girls for more orbs
10380000	10382000	Oh yes
10382000	10384000	Sex and in my
10384000	10386000	God of War
10386000	10388000	Shocking, but in a good way
10388000	10390000	Ooh I can't believe
10390000	10392000	That just happened
10392000	10394000	Oh we have a phone call, hi you're on orange lounge radio
10394000	10396000	Who's this
10396000	10398000	Hey how you doing

10406000	10408000	Good stuff
10408000	10410000	Interesting little story
10410000	10412000	I'm chilling, I'm watching My Little Pony
10412000	10414000	Just kicking back
10414000	10416000	That's what's up, that's how I roll
10416000	10418000	Alright what's up
10418000	10420000	I have a funny little story to have a nice interesting
10420000	10422000	Story about Microsoft and I'll be on my merry little way
10422000	10424000	Okay
10424000	10426000	First story is, oddly enough
10426000	10428000	If it wasn't for Raichan, I wouldn't be a fan of the show
10428000	10430000	And I wouldn't be pestering you guys for all these years
10430000	10432000	Now, oh
10432000	10434000	So you are a fan of olr
10434000	10436000	Thanks to Raichan
10436000	10438000	Me and Raichan, we go back like
10438000	10440000	Ten plus years, hanging out on
10440000	10442000	On a forum site, wbs.net
10442000	10444000	Can you hold on a minute
10444000	10446000	Can you hold on a minute
10446000	10448000	Yeah, yeah
10448000	10450000	God damn you
10450000	10452000	You ruined everything
10460000	10462000	Oh shit, was I not on mute
10462000	10464000	Hey Rob
10464000	10466000	Can you scream a little louder
10466000	10468000	I don't think the dead heard you
10468000	10470000	You know what's funny, apparently right when I screamed
10470000	10472000	The internet went out again
10472000	10474000	Which isn't, you're still on Skype
10474000	10476000	So I don't think that's possible, whatever
10476000	10478000	Alright, so anyway
10478000	10480000	That'll be one for the pod
10480000	10482000	And the podcast listeners
10482000	10484000	Supposedly don't get any love
10484000	10486000	Anyway
10486000	10488000	Sorry, where were we
10488000	10490000	I was explaining how I became a fan of the show
10490000	10492000	Yes, please
10492000	10494000	I mean, I'm just chatting online one day
10494000	10496000	And she just IMs me on ICQ
10496000	10498000	She's like, are you to like, be mining DDR
10498000	10500000	I was like, what here
10500000	10502000	And she's like, check this out
10502000	10504000	What was your number on ICQ
10504000	10506000	You just aged everything ten years
10506000	10508000	When you brought up ICQ
10508000	10510000	Well, we're already on a ten year delay
10510000	10512000	I'm still logged on to it right now
10512000	10514000	My number is
10514000	10516000	10719559
10516000	10520000	Uh oh
10520000	10522000	Uh oh
10522000	10524000	That was my old boss's message tone
10524000	10526000	Uh oh
10526000	10528000	Well it was everybody's on ICQ
10528000	10530000	No, no, I mean on her phone
10530000	10532000	Uh oh, ew
10532000	10534000	Okay, so she messaged you on ICQ
10534000	10536000	And your computer went, uh oh
10536000	10538000	Yeah, pretty much
10538000	10540000	And then everybody in OLR went
10540000	10542000	Wait, was that right
10542000	10544000	And then everybody in OLR
10544000	10546000	went, uh oh
10550000	10552000	Ah, that was great
10552000	10554000	Oh wait, here we go, here we go, here we go
10554000	10556000	This is great
10556000	10558000	Uh oh
10560000	10562000	Oh, that's the sound I make every time
10562000	10564000	Oh look, the phone's lighting up
10564000	10566000	And it's Ranma
10566000	10568000	I wonder if there's somebody out there
10568000	10570000	That has their ringtone or text message
10570000	10572000	For their phone
10572000	10574000	How about the ICQ sound remix
10574000	10576000	That apparently exists out there
10578000	10580000	Oh god
10580000	10582000	Uh, OT pain
10582000	10584000	Is this dubstep?
10584000	10586000	Not yet, not enough screeching
10586000	10588000	Okay, anyway
10588000	10590000	Hi Ranma, what's new?
10590000	10592000	That's a notorious SKIE, huh
10592000	10594000	I'm sorry?
10594000	10596000	That's a notorious SKIE, huh
10596000	10598000	Yes, oh
10598000	10600000	Blackwool says the ICQ song needs to go into rotation
10600000	10602000	Take a vote on it right now
10602000	10604000	That's right, looks like
10604000	10606000	Dark Tetsuya voted for it too
10606000	10608000	So I think that passes
10608000	10610000	We're gonna get that in the vlog stream
10610000	10612000	ICQ remix coming soon
10612000	10614000	Alright, Ranma, anything else
10614000	10616000	you wanted to share with us
10616000	10618000	I think I overran my time
10618000	10620000	So I'm gonna get a bun out of here
10620000	10622000	Love you, mean it
10622000	10624000	Sure you do, you mean it for every bullet so far
10624000	10626000	Love you too
10626000	10628000	I'm out
10628000	10630000	Bye
10630000	10632000	It is strange how
10632000	10634000	well some people's voices lend them to
10634000	10636000	recreate sounds like that
10636000	10638000	People, I don't know if I've ever
10638000	10640000	really been pitchy on the show
10640000	10642000	1-877-GAMO-LR, or username on Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio
10642000	10644000	I don't know if I've ever really been pitchy on the show
10644000	10646000	I know I've laughed pretty high pitched a couple times
10646000	10648000	tonight, but I would never have expected you to be able
10648000	10650000	to recreate that tone, ever
10650000	10652000	There's a lot of things I can do
10652000	10654000	you can't even possibly imagine
10654000	10656000	Episode 469
10656000	10658000	Live
10658000	10660000	I do the Muppets too
10660000	10662000	Their voices, their voices
10666000	10668000	Near
10668000	10670000	Far
10670000	10672000	Near
10672000	10674000	Far
10678000	10680000	Oh god
10680000	10682000	Kermit the Frog
10682000	10684000	Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here
10688000	10690000	Do I really want to go into an inside joke like that?
10690000	10692000	Probably not
10696000	10698000	Live radio
10698000	10700000	It's moments
10700000	10702000	like these where I can only
10702000	10714000	think of this
10714000	10716000	Call
10716000	10718000	Hold on
10718000	10720000	We got a call coming in? Here we go
10728000	10730000	Oh hi, who's this?
10730000	10732000	Hello
10732000	10734000	Hello
10734000	10736000	Manomina
10736000	10738000	No, that's terrible
10738000	10740000	Who is this?
10740000	10742000	It's Shane
10742000	10744000	Hey Shane, what's up?
10744000	10746000	Nothing, I just realized that
10746000	10748000	I can't really plug courthouse this week
10748000	10750000	because I won't be on it
10750000	10752000	So did you call into my other radio show
10752000	10754000	just to tell me that?
10754000	10756000	Yes
10756000	10758000	I already figured that out actually earlier
10758000	10760000	I didn't
10760000	10762000	So I thought you should be the first to know
10762000	10764000	Well thank you for that important announcement
10764000	10766000	Hey guess what y'all, Shane will not be on
10766000	10768000	Hoard House this week, in other news
10768000	10770000	this is the week to listen to Hoard House
10770000	10772000	Wow
10772000	10774000	Just kidding, I'm kidding
10774000	10776000	Who's gonna do the Facebook
10776000	10778000	Who's gonna do the Facebook question of the week now?
10778000	10780000	I don't know
10780000	10782000	but it won't be me
10782000	10784000	What, you have no Google Plus listeners at Hoard House?
10784000	10786000	I don't even think Hoard House
10786000	10788000	Is that one person not listening?
10788000	10790000	I don't even think Hoard House has a Google Plus account
10790000	10792000	sadly
10792000	10794000	Is that all you called in to talk about?
10794000	10796000	What?
10796000	10798000	Is that all you called in to talk about?
10798000	10800000	No, I called in to say everybody needs to also
10800000	10802000	purchase Guild Wars 2
10802000	10804000	because it's fantastic
10804000	10806000	Ah yes, you've been playing in the beta
10806000	10808000	What's so great about Guild Wars 2?
10808000	10810000	It's pretty
10810000	10812000	and the combat's fun
10812000	10814000	and it's also free to play once you buy it
10814000	10816000	It's pretty fun
10816000	10818000	Did you say it's free to play once you buy it?
10818000	10820000	Yeah, like there's no monthly fee
10820000	10822000	No subscription, yeah I got that
10822000	10824000	So it's similar
10824000	10826000	It's similarly different to World of Warcraft
10826000	10828000	You stole my word
10830000	10832000	Alright
10832000	10834000	You're full of hate tonight
10834000	10836000	It's a problem
10836000	10838000	Ah, that's great
10838000	10840000	I learned from you Shane
10840000	10842000	I learned from you and since you're not gonna be on
10842000	10844000	Hoard House this week I had to make up for it
10844000	10846000	Clearly
10846000	10848000	I'm
10848000	10850000	What am I not full of hate? Alright
10850000	10852000	I don't know
10852000	10854000	You're extra hateful tonight
10854000	10856000	So are you allowed to talk about where you're at
10856000	10858000	right now or should I not talk about that on air?
10858000	10860000	Why is it confidential?
10860000	10862000	I don't know
10864000	10866000	I don't know either, I'm asking you why is it
10866000	10868000	confidential? Because
10868000	10870000	of the nature of your work now, I don't know
10870000	10872000	No
10872000	10874000	I'm up in Redman, Washington
10874000	10876000	training at Nintendo
10876000	10878000	Are you having fun?
10878000	10880000	Yes, it's very pretty here
10880000	10882000	Like everybody should just look to Redman
10882000	10884000	because that's what I want to do now
10884000	10886000	The Pacific Northwest is really beautiful, I haven't been to Redman specifically
10886000	10888000	but I love Seattle, Seattle's great
10888000	10890000	Should go back for PAX
10890000	10892000	That's next week so I can't
10892000	10894000	Is that really next week?
10894000	10896000	Isn't it?
10896000	10898000	PAX is over Labor Day weekend again, it's the same time as
10898000	10900000	Dragon Con
10900000	10902000	I thought it was the end of August
10902000	10904000	Which would be next week
10904000	10906000	That's like three weeks
10906000	10908000	Oh, I don't know
10908000	10910000	I can't go
10910000	10912000	That's too much money, but I would love to now
10912000	10914000	I always want to go to PAX if it's up here
10914000	10916000	August 31 through September 2nd
10916000	10918000	That's what, three weeks away?
10918000	10920000	That's the same time as Dragon Con
10920000	10922000	Well, Redman
10922000	10924000	is like a little village inside a forest
10924000	10926000	It's beautiful
10926000	10928000	It's like a little village inside a forest
10928000	10930000	How far are you from Seattle?
10930000	10932000	Like 30 minutes
10932000	10934000	Oh, that's further than I would have thought
10934000	10936000	Well, that's how long the cab ride took
10936000	10938000	The $81 cab ride
10938000	10940000	Holy moly
10940000	10942000	That's a ways away
10942000	10944000	I didn't pay for it, so I don't care
10944000	10946000	Alright, well I want to hear all the dirt
10946000	10948000	even if you can't talk about it on OLR
10948000	10950000	I want to hear all the dirt about your first trip to Nintendo headquarters tomorrow
10950000	10952000	That's fine, I will do that
10952000	10956000	And let us know if you bump into Reggie or anybody really exciting
10956000	10958000	How is Reggie exciting?
10958000	10960000	I don't know
10960000	10962000	Be sure to ask him if his body is ready
10962000	10964000	I'm sure he hasn't heard that enough
10964000	10966000	Oh god, that really was the highlight of E3
10966000	10968000	He did say Reggie
10968000	10970000	I don't even remember that
10970000	10972000	He did say Reggie OR somebody exciting
10972000	10974000	So, okay, if I meet Mario tomorrow
10974000	10976000	Like actual Mario, not Charles Martinette
10976000	10978000	I'll let you know
10978000	10980000	Or Derpy Mario
10980000	10982000	I don't know if you've been listening to the show
10982000	10984000	But the Derpy Mario from Florida might show up
10984000	10986000	I don't know
10986000	10988000	You know what, in fact
10988000	10990000	I think you need to report Derpy Mario actually
10990000	10992000	I'm going to help you out
10992000	10994000	You need to put that in a feedback box somewhere
10994000	10996000	If there's a suggestion box on the wall
10996000	10998000	Please arrest Derpy Mario in Tampa, Florida
10998000	11000000	Well, I would need some sort of like
11000000	11002000	Like proof of Derpy Mario
11002000	11004000	The picture is on Kotaku
11004000	11006000	The picture is on Kotaku
11006000	11008000	The picture is on Kotaku
11008000	11010000	The picture is on Kotaku
11010000	11012000	It's on, alright, I'll email you
11012000	11014000	I'll email you the link
11014000	11016000	Alright, I gotta let you go to get some more calls
11016000	11018000	Anything else?
11018000	11020000	No, my whole
11020000	11022000	Studio
11022000	11024000	Hotel room is powered by a key card
11024000	11026000	That I have to plug into the wall
11026000	11028000	And if I take it away it turns everything off
11028000	11030000	It's weird
11030000	11032000	Those hotels are actually really nice
11032000	11034000	Yeah, it's $300 a night apparently
11034000	11036000	Wow
11036000	11038000	It's like
11038000	11040000	Guy from middle of nowhere, Kansas
11040000	11042000	Ends up in the big city or the village in the forest
11042000	11044000	Where you have to plug things into walls
11044000	11046000	In order to get power
11046000	11048000	It's weird, you have to make power
11048000	11050000	Like a freaking water
11050000	11052000	What are those called?
11052000	11054000	Those water wheel things?
11054000	11056000	Hydroelectric power?
11056000	11058000	Sure, there we go
11058000	11060000	Alright, I will talk to you later Shane
11060000	11062000	Take care
11062000	11064000	Bye
11064000	11066000	Let's try to fit in at least one more call
11066000	11068000	For the night before we say goodnight
11068000	11070000	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?
11070000	11072000	Hey guys, it's Porkchop
11072000	11074000	Hey Porkchop, how you doing?
11074000	11076000	Not bad, just on all you guys who are all
11076000	11078000	Knowing, I heard you talk about the move
11078000	11080000	And I'm just wondering, I'm thinking of buying it
11080000	11082000	But what exactly can I do with it?
11082000	11084000	I mean I have a couple of games I can use it with
11084000	11086000	But is there anything else that I could really do with it
11086000	11088000	That's worthwhile
11088000	11090000	I'm sorry, but all I have to say is
11090000	11092000	And I know this is a radio show
11092000	11094000	Your Skype picture is cracking me
11094000	11096000	The hell up
11096000	11098000	I'm glad, I didn't think you could see it before
11098000	11100000	But I'm glad you can see it now
11100000	11102000	Yes, we can all see it here in studio
11102000	11104000	And it's cracking me up
11104000	11106000	Because to describe it for listeners at home
11106000	11108000	He's literally wearing a tinfoil hat
11108000	11110000	That makes him look like
11110000	11112000	It's a tinfoil helmet
11112000	11114000	He looks like a superhero or something
11114000	11116000	But he looks like
11116000	11118000	Sir Tin of Foil
11118000	11120000	It's a very phallic, foily head
11120000	11122000	That he's got there
11122000	11124000	Sir Reynolds of Rap
11124000	11126000	He's like a metallic luchador
11126000	11128000	Thank you
11128000	11130000	He's a metallic luchador
11130000	11132000	But the expression on his face is like
11132000	11134000	Hey
11134000	11136000	He's like the happy luchador
11136000	11138000	Hey
11138000	11140000	I'ma body slam you now
11140000	11142000	Anyhow
11142000	11144000	Episode 469
11144000	11146000	Thank you
11146000	11148000	You should get the PlayStation Move
11148000	11150000	To play it in that helmet
11150000	11152000	And upload those videos to SingStar
11152000	11154000	You would be the number one ranked player in the world
11154000	11156000	I would do that just for you
11156000	11158000	Seeing as you ask so nicely
11158000	11160000	I would do that if I can get SingStar
11160000	11162000	No problem
11162000	11164000	And please make sure it's SingStar, Abba
11164000	11166000	Loki, you have some suggestions
11166000	11168000	What could he do with the move?
11168000	11170000	Well, there's
11170000	11172000	All their first person shooter games support the move
11172000	11174000	And they have also their gun thing
11174000	11176000	I don't remember what it's called
11176000	11178000	Well, Sports Champions
11178000	11180000	Is pretty fun with the move
11180000	11182000	Also, apparently
11182000	11184000	Child of Eden is really good
11184000	11186000	With the move
11186000	11188000	They've got some move exclusive games
11188000	11190000	But they're kind of just so-so
11190000	11192000	I don't know
11192000	11194000	Let me put it this way
11194000	11196000	A lot of that move stuff is probably
11196000	11198000	Really discounted right now
11198000	11200000	So you could probably take a pretty good
11200000	11202000	Look through a dump bin
11202000	11204000	Somewhere or a discount bin
11204000	11206000	In one of these stores and find a bunch of that move stuff
11206000	11208000	But yeah, I'd say
11208000	11210000	Probably Sports Champions is really good
11210000	11212000	Although, if you want to wait, Sports Champions
11212000	11214000	2 is coming out
11214000	11216000	I don't know if it has some of the
11216000	11218000	I think it has some of the same events in there
11218000	11220000	But I mean, it's got frisbee golf
11220000	11222000	That's kind of fun, I played the archery
11222000	11224000	Archery is really cool
11224000	11226000	How is LittleBigPlanet's move implementation?
11226000	11228000	It's supposed to be pretty good
11228000	11230000	They've got a lot of new stuff with that
11230000	11232000	LittleBigPlanet 2 would be a good one
11232000	11234000	If you like Heavy Rain
11234000	11236000	I don't know how good that would be
11236000	11238000	Yeah, I got that
11238000	11240000	You can use it as a mouse
11240000	11244000	Yeah, that's hacking stuff
11244000	11246000	Actually, yeah
11246000	11248000	A lot of the games are pretty accurate
11248000	11250000	It works pretty well with whatever
11250000	11252000	It's just whatever type of games you like
11252000	11254000	I know they tried some of the party stuff
11254000	11256000	In the very beginning and that was kind of crap
11256000	11258000	But stick with the sports games
11258000	11260000	If you like the dancing games
11260000	11262000	I'm sure it works well with it
11264000	11268000	You could basically pretend you're playing Wii games
11268000	11270000	That work
11270000	11272000	Yeah
11272000	11274000	Well, I got Heavy Rain and Resident Evil 5
11274000	11276000	So I think that should pretty much
11276000	11278000	Keep me going until I can pick up some other ones
11278000	11280000	That sounds pretty good
11280000	11282000	Sounds like a lot of stuff you're going to find in the clearance bin
11282000	11284000	Pretty soon, unfortunately
11284000	11286000	But hey, however you can find the deal, right?
11286000	11288000	I picked them up cheap anyway
11288000	11290000	King Star Abba, that's on my list
11290000	11292000	Alright, as it should be on everybody's list
11292000	11294000	It's fun
11294000	11296000	Alright, Porkchop, before I let you go so we can close up the show
11296000	11298000	Anything else on your mind tonight?
11298000	11300000	Yes, Konami, if you fuck up
11300000	11302000	Zone of the Enders HD collection
11302000	11304000	I will fucking kill you
11304000	11306000	In that helmet
11306000	11308000	Yeah, he will wear that helmet
11308000	11310000	Professor Chaos!
11310000	11312000	That's it
11312000	11316000	You need a battle axe made out of tinfoil
11316000	11318000	I just need a special move now
11318000	11320000	Wait, I have to say it
11320000	11322000	Because over here it's aluminum
11322000	11324000	There's an aluminium
11324000	11326000	Really?
11326000	11328000	We just said tinfoil
11328000	11330000	Why make it so damn complicated?
11330000	11332000	We're that lazy, we don't give a shit
11332000	11334000	Cover your food with it, that's it
11334000	11336000	Tinfoil
11336000	11338000	Make hats, make axes, whatever
11338000	11340000	I love it
11340000	11342000	Alright, Porkchop, I got to let you go to Close Up Shop
11342000	11344000	Have a good one, buddy
11344000	11346000	Have a good one, Rusty guys
11346000	11348000	Will do, bye
11348000	11350000	I love the listeners
11350000	11352000	187, oh wait no, I'm closing up Sky
11352000	11354000	I'm sorry if you didn't get through
11354000	11356000	But it's like 9.30 already
11356000	11358000	And I want a milkshake
11358000	11360000	We need to wrap up here and get out of here
11360000	11362000	What? Milkshake
11362000	11364000	Does it bring all the boys to the yard?
11364000	11366000	I don't care, it brings fat to my butt
11366000	11368000	It's the Dark Sakura version
11368000	11370000	Wait, hold on, hold on
11370000	11372000	No
11372000	11374000	You asked for it, you asked for it
11374000	11376000	No
11376000	11378000	God, you're awful
11380000	11382000	No
11382000	11384000	La la la la la
11384000	11386000	Ha ha
11386000	11388000	Ha ha ha
11388000	11390000	Thank you for YouTube ads
11390000	11392000	Alright, here we go
11392000	11394000	Unmute me
11394000	11396000	My milkshake brings all my fat to the butt
11398000	11400000	And I'm like
11400000	11402000	Damn right, it's fat on my butt
11410000	11412000	They all want me
11412000	11414000	When I walk into the gym
11414000	11416000	Like this
11418000	11420000	Damn right I went to Pinkberry
11422000	11424000	And I was like
11424000	11426000	Yo, supersize
11426000	11430000	You can't have mine
11432000	11434000	And there's your singing
11434000	11436000	For episode 469
11438000	11440000	Is there a meme
11440000	11442000	We haven't covered?
11446000	11448000	Okay
11450000	11452000	Oh, I think I need to do um
11452000	11454000	I need to do Twitter topics
11454000	11456000	Are you
11456000	11458000	feeling a little emotional, Rob?
11458000	11460000	I'm so emotional
11460000	11462000	baby
11462000	11464000	You had to bring
11464000	11466000	Whitney into this, can't you let that poor
11466000	11468000	woman rest in peace? Never
11468000	11470000	Damn
11470000	11472000	She's still got a movie coming out, alright?
11472000	11474000	She's dead and got a movie coming out
11474000	11476000	It's amazing what they can do with technology
11476000	11478000	Alright, look, tweets
11478000	11480000	First off, Tigerclaw
11480000	11482000	They actually tried that with Bruce Lee
11482000	11484000	and Tupac
11484000	11486000	Alright, uh
11486000	11488000	Great, Travis
11488000	11490000	is inviting me on Understation live next week
11490000	11492000	and do white boys sing along
11494000	11496000	Why not, sure
11496000	11498000	Alright, Tigerclaw
11498000	11500000	tweets us
11500000	11502000	and you'll be interested in this, a fan-made
11502000	11504000	Mass Effect adventure game that surfaces
11504000	11506000	Is that that Mass Effect universe?
11506000	11508000	It's called Finding Shepherd
11508000	11510000	and it's on the Adventure Game Studios
11510000	11512000	It's created by one of the users on the forums
11512000	11514000	Nightfable. Finding Shepherd, it's in
11514000	11516000	progress right now, but it's set in the Mass Effect
11516000	11518000	universe directly following Mass Effect
11518000	11520000	3. It assumes that you took
11520000	11522000	the destroy ending, that's all we're
11522000	11524000	going to say about that, but what's cool about
11524000	11526000	this game, if you kind of look at some of the early screenshots
11526000	11528000	it looks like a LucasArts game or something
11528000	11530000	That's kind of rad
11530000	11532000	Do you press S for Shepherd?
11532000	11534000	Shepherd? Shepherd?
11534000	11536000	Shepherd? Shepherd?
11536000	11538000	You seem to have Mass Effect
11538000	11540000	confused with heavy rain
11540000	11542000	Alright
11542000	11544000	Uh, let's see
11544000	11546000	Tigerclaw
11546000	11548000	also sends us one more tweet about how
11548000	11550000	GameStop is one of the worst places to
11550000	11552000	work in America
11552000	11554000	It's just number 10
11554000	11556000	Is it really? It's only number 10? Yeah, it's number 10
11556000	11558000	Uh, actually I had pulled this up
11558000	11560000	Number 1 is Dish Network
11560000	11562000	Number 2 is Dillard's
11562000	11564000	Number 3 is Radio Shack
11564000	11566000	Number 4 is Perch
11566000	11568000	Number 6 is Sears slash Kmart
11568000	11570000	Number 7 is
11570000	11572000	Robert Halfer International, which I have no idea who they are
11572000	11574000	Kmart is tough to work for because you have to work
11574000	11576000	with mummies Number 8 is Hewlett-Packard
11576000	11578000	Number 9 is Rite Aid
11578000	11580000	and number 10 is GameStop
11580000	11582000	followed by Bank of New York Mellon
11582000	11584000	Sears
11584000	11586000	slash Kmart? Was that a tie?
11586000	11588000	Or are they the same company?
11588000	11590000	They're the same company Kmart and Sears
11590000	11592000	had a merger with Holdings
11592000	11594000	Oh, imagine that
11594000	11596000	Babymon, who wants to plug his best friend
11596000	11598000	made some Papercraft Legend
11598000	11600000	of Zelda, which is available as posters
11600000	11602000	on Etsy
11602000	11604000	I got to admit, some of these are really cute
11604000	11606000	They're kind of the Phantom Hourglass style
11606000	11608000	That's cute
11608000	11610000	You should plug that in the chat room
11610000	11612000	That link's a little long for me to read on air
11612000	11614000	But it's on Etsy, just search Papercraft Zelda
11614000	11616000	I guess
11616000	11618000	Oh, sends a tweet with more pictures
11618000	11620000	That one's really cute, I like the Mario one
11620000	11622000	I would hang that in my house
11622000	11624000	I want this game now, because you play as Jack
11624000	11626000	Anyhow
11626000	11628000	Thank you for the tweets
11628000	11630000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R
11630000	11632000	to send us tweets in a future week
11632000	11634000	But you know what? We have got to close up the show
11634000	11636000	Oh, last minute stories
11636000	11638000	Let us Jack have a picture of Miranda in a room
11638000	11640000	I have no last minute stories
11640000	11642000	Well then I guess it's time to end
11642000	11644000	episode number 469
11644000	11646000	So
11646000	11648000	First off, I want to thank our guests

11650000	11652000	Thank you so much for making the drive
11652000	11654000	All the way from Colorado
11654000	11656000	Huh?
11656000	11658000	It was a drive and Colorado was involved
11658000	11660000	But I'll take it
11660000	11662000	Thank you Jason for being here tonight
11662000	11664000	Appreciate it
11664000	11666000	And do you have any last minute thoughts?
11666000	11668000	Final thoughts?
11668000	11670000	I cry from laughing
11670000	11672000	Way too much
11672000	11674000	Ryan, thank you so much
11674000	11676000	You made it finally to a show
11676000	11678000	Yay, finally
11678000	11680000	And I'm with Jason
11680000	11682000	My head hurts and I've been
11682000	11684000	laughing so hard I was crying earlier
11684000	11686000	All the feels
11686000	11688000	Is that your final thought tonight?
11688000	11690000	I think so
11690000	11692000	Alright, well thank you for being here and please
11692000	11694000	come back again sometime
11694000	11696000	And I swear I'll get you a better mic next time
11696000	11698000	Alright, let's see
11698000	11700000	Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?
11700000	11702000	I want a kitten, but Shermie is too fat and would sit on her
11702000	11704000	Loki, your final thought tonight?
11704000	11706000	I drink too much water
11706000	11708000	And my final thought tonight is
11708000	11710000	La la la la la
11710000	11712000	Thank you guys so much
11712000	11714000	I thought your final thought would have been
11714000	11716000	Uh oh
11716000	11718000	That's what happens when you drink too much water
11718000	11720000	Uh oh
11720000	11722000	See that sounds like either
11722000	11724000	ICQ or lemmings
11724000	11726000	That's what happens when I eat at Chipotle
11726000	11728000	Uh oh
11728000	11730000	Followed by
11732000	11734000	Oh I'm so glad we could have a poop joke
11734000	11736000	before the show was over
11736000	11738000	Thank you, Loki
11738000	11740000	We've already had dick
11740000	11742000	I'm sorry, alien dildo
11742000	11744000	Really? We got dick? Where?
