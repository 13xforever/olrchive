13962	24820	Tonight, August 12, 2012, Amazon starts a new game studio, Valve is set to use Steam for non-gaming applications, and has an R-rated version of a Super Nintendo game been discovered?
31434	37676	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37736	48319	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this August the 12th of 2012 and the 400 and, wait for it, 69th episode of our show.
48339	51420	That doesn't imply anything by the way.
51500	52120	No, not at all.
53000	54381	Rob Roberts, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
75441	76542	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
98499	100862	Well, I was just like 69 teehee.
101503	102003	Yeah, I know.
102023	107450	When you say like 69 and start talking about girls, it is a little bit of a creeper zone, so we probably shouldn't go there.
107710	108691	It's just a little creepy.
108711	109192	I like pie.
110273	110994	Pie is good.
111134	111694	Pie is great.
111715	112315	So is coffee.
113116	115839	Also over there, say hello to Tech Master Loki.
115980	116240	Hi.
116480	117101	How you doing, Loki?
117301	117861	I'm doing fine.
118061	118942	So what do you say?
119102	121642	For old time's sake, let's get Karaoke Revolution out.
121862	122042	No.
122683	123603	No one plays that anymore.
123783	125083	Okay, well I have SingStar.
125143	126884	No one plays any karaoke games anymore.
126964	127584	SingStar ABBA?
127724	128184	No, I'm sorry.
128204	128624	That's not acceptable.
128644	129165	Oh my gosh, SingStar ABBA.
129205	130525	We totally need to do SingStar ABBA.
130645	133046	I think we should do some live on-air SingStar ABBA tonight.
133266	133826	But I won't sing.
133966	136907	Would you like to maybe do a duet on SingStar ABBA later?
136927	137247	Maybe.
137467	139328	Maybe just for the listeners for the occasion?
139648	139968	Maybe.
140348	141388	I don't want to talk.
142129	142809	Come on, you want to do it?
142869	143089	All right.
144355	160200	Say hello as well, we have some special guests in studio tonight Please welcome back to the show, I'm always very happy to see him here in studio And part of that is because he has a very sexy radio voice Say hello to Jason And I'm always glad to be back in California Welcome back, even in the triple degree heat?
161601	171404	It's no 68 foggy San Francisco Bay, but I still make the trip It's 69 foggy Sacramento Bay, excuse you I'm gonna milk those jokes for all they're worth tonight
174618	176040	Loki just gave me a look.
176780	180824	God, I wish it was a... I mean, I don't wish it was a TV show, but I do sometimes.
182085	183726	I wish Loki had a camera.
183766	185548	That's the only one that needs to be on cam is Loki.
185688	186449	Let's be real.
186489	187810	That's the only one that people want to see.
188290	191233	Stealth webcam, considering the ones persistently pointed at his face.
191713	193315	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
207850	208090	I love that.
208110	210132	And they do it all the time when I was watching Morning Musume.
229589	243858	Alright, we have another guest here in studio tonight, and I'm so happy to introduce this person to the show, because I know it's somebody who's been a long-time listener of OLR, and she has finally made it to the studio after a 469-week pilgrimage.
244639	245159	What can I say?
245239	245779	She walked.
245899	246380	No, I'm kidding.
246780	249562	But we're so happy to welcome... What am I calling you tonight?
249582	251663	You better introduce yourself, because I don't want to call you the wrong thing tonight.
252924	256846	Well, I always went by Rai Chen, and that's what I am on the chat, so...
258564	269894	Hello Rai Chan, welcome to the show I just call you Rai for short because I don't know I heard Jason calling her that once I was like I like that, Rai works for me So Rai Chan, how are you?
271696	279603	It's good to finally be on vacation, it's good to finally be out here Awesome, so how long have you been listening to Orange Launch Radio?
279623	280204	It's been a while, right?
281753	287878	Yeah, I started about the time when Jason and I actually met, so it's been about eight years or so.
292542	295444	So you used to play, back in the day, you used to play DDR and all that stuff?
295704	297846	Yeah, that's how actually Jason and I met, so...
300401	303203	Aww, okay, I want to hear the story.
303383	306666	How did Jason and Rai meet over DDR?
307086	318235	The particular points that were interesting were obviously her living in Colorado, myself living in New Mexico, I being a mod for the Southwest board on DDR Freak.
319096	321578	It all started because I told her she was breaking the rules.
322579	326022	That was my first reason to explicitly... Did you give her a point?
326662	327223	No, never...
330066	330726	Good choice of words.
332027	332828	Back to the story.
334289	335730	I didn't say, did you give her a prick?
335770	337131	I said, did you give her a point?
339212	351281	The DDR Freak rules were outside of the imaging forum that pictures couldn't be more than 300 by 300, and I used it as an excuse to private message her and say, well, the rules say this, so could you please do that?
351321	357125	Well, and how dare you post an image over 300 kilobytes on a forum?
357645	358526	Shame on me.
359969	370416	So we all kind of started, her and myself and a bunch of other people started getting on AIM chat rooms just talking for all hours of the night, whatever, random things.
371317	372217	We were actually talking about this.
372237	375179	We were over at Iguana Girls House, a new place, earlier this morning.
375820	380102	And I actually mentioned that both Rye and myself were on LiveJournal.
380663	383945	And I saw her commenting on a post of Iguana Girls.
384565	384685	And...
386307	390690	I found out that she was on LiveJournal as a result so I started checking out her posts and commenting on them.
390830	393632	Oh my god, we're talking about DDR freaking LiveJournal.
393692	396494	Tonight's show is like 10 years in the past.
396735	400698	This episode of OLR was brought to you by... I'm in a time warp tonight.
400738	404120	We're outdoing the take-delay for NBC.
404701	406862	It's the OLR time capsule.
406882	410625	We are bringing you live coverage tonight of the Sydney 2000 Olympics, everybody.
410845	413788	We actually recorded this show 10 years ago but no one even knows.
414308	415169	We're just playing it back.
418169	422993	Okay, so Rai, obviously, I mean, we go back to the DDR days, but I know you're a gamer girl.
423053	425595	What types of video games are you into, or computer games, or what have you?
426416	428038	Mostly RPGs, puzzle games.
428258	428658	Diablo.
429199	429659	Diablo.
429819	431060	Lots and lots of Diablo.
431100	431901	Lots of Diablo.
431941	434223	I've got two level 60s, and I'm working on a third.
436383	436723	Addict.
439144	439984	I am on.
440424	441945	I play a lot of World of Warcraft.
441985	443585	I play a lot of World of Warcraft.
443645	445006	A lot of World of Warcraft.
445786	449607	And every time I sign on, there's always at least one person on my real ID.
449667	451828	Can anyone guess who is always on real ID?
451848	453468	Signed in playing Diablo 3?
454549	455329	That would be me.
455349	460851	Okay, so Diablo 3 has taken a lot of shit out there, but obviously you don't care because you're playing it.
460891	465372	So why are haters hating on Diablo 3 and why can they go just hate in the corner?
469688	472531	You know, with me, I started with Diablo 2 when I was in high school.
472771	476735	It's one of those things that I have always really, really liked.
477856	479257	So I waited for it to come out.
480358	480939	People hate.
481239	482040	People always hate.
482340	482901	Let them hate.
483181	483641	I don't care.
483822	484602	Haters to the left.
485103	487905	Okay, we're just going to play a little bit of word association.
487925	488786	I'm going to say a phrase.
488806	489907	You tell me what comes to mind.
489967	490588	All right, you ready?
491148	492530	Real money auction house.
494033	494734	Don't do it.
495936	500922	I've sold a couple things on there, but otherwise I don't really participate in it.
501824	503025	PvP patch.
504207	505569	Not something that I care about.
505949	508693	You know, you want to go through and kill other players, go for it.
509975	510596	Activision.
514184	514865	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
541807	544188	Hey, we do tape live at the Voice of Geeks Network.
544288	546848	Vognetwork.com is where you can join us.
546888	553430	And in the chat, live.vognetwork.com is where you can participate, check in, get loot and VOG points and all that stuff.
553990	558551	And have your chat comments possibly read here on the show.
559251	560931	And some folks here in the chat room.
561411	561771	Let's see.
561871	565072	Black Wolf is reminding us that tonight's show has been taped delayed 10 years.
565652	565872	Yes.
566292	568293	Frisbee says, live from Salt Lake City.
569173	569713	Close.
569914	572955	Jason might have gone through there on the trip here, right?
574496	579259	Provo and... No, I-70 goes through both.
579520	583122	The rail takes a destination that goes through Provo and has a stop in Salt Lake City.
584289	585931	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
604708	617516	After, and I really do blame VGHS for this, after VGHS, after I kickstarted that or pledged to that Kickstarter, I started getting into the habit of browsing Kickstarter for things.
617697	625702	And one of the things that I saw on there was a custom card deck for, there's a bunch of companies doing custom cards and stuff like that.
625742	629464	So one of the decks that was on there was The Grid.
629704	630045	It's like...
630865	635448	Tron-themed cards, but not quite, because they can't do it without the licensing.
635508	640410	But it's Tron-esque cards, that very neon black.
641591	642351	They're pretty cool looking.
642692	644453	So it was a limited run.
644473	646213	I think they only did about 1,000 of them.
646594	651096	And so I pledged to get a bunch of, well, a few of the decks.
651196	652517	So I kept one.
652537	653357	I gave one to my friend.
653377	655178	I gave one to you guys.
655999	657860	And yeah, so...
658240	658600	It was cool.
659020	661161	Yeah, I gotta say, I don't even want to open them.
661482	666324	I'm like, I do need a deck of cards for card games, but I don't want to open them because they're so awesome.
666904	669805	It's like, you know, it's like not wanting to open toys.
670226	671186	Just use them and whatever.
671206	673067	I can show you a picture of what all the cards look like.
673087	673927	I mean, if that'll help.
674448	675128	Okay, that'll work.
675808	683352	Now, despite all the fact that we give Kickstarter a lot of crap here on the show, you know, a lot of that's been me, although Jamie's had her fair share in giving Kickstarter crap.
684612	684832	And it's...
686434	687214	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
702503	703124	Thanks for watching!
724369	726411	to donating one of the Kickstarters, and I still might.
726431	728192	And that would be my first Kickstarter ever.
728612	730114	And that's the GamerCon one.
730854	732716	I'm seriously considering supporting.
732736	733856	Well, they've already hit their funding.
734977	736979	I was just on Kickstarter about a few seconds ago.
738540	742083	And I saw that they had hit their funding, I think, for that.
742123	742883	But that's still cool.
742903	746046	I mean, they can always use more funding.
746106	748708	I'm kind of obligated to go to GamerCon, you know?
748868	749669	It's in San Francisco.
749949	752331	It's right up the street, and, you know, so...
752831	755473	Yeah, but you could also go to YowieCon, which is also in San Francisco.
755653	756153	I could.
756954	757694	YowieCon is fun.
757714	759475	But GamerCon is about video games.
759555	762417	YowieCon is about... YowieCon has electronic tools.
765509	768992	No, it has the electric... 469, folks.
769493	775818	This guy was selling these glass tubes that attach to an electric current.
776359	778381	And it shoots electricity across your skin.
779081	782144	And I had him turn it up all the way because I have nerve damage in my hands.
782644	783585	So I didn't feel it.
784106	785447	And he's like, are you alive?
786207	787228	Yes, I want one of these.
787288	787829	It kind of tickles.
788723	790625	Alright, so Loki, Kickstarter.
791225	794568	You've kind of become a little bit like... You kickstart a lot of stuff.
794748	796069	You have a lot of feet.
796349	796930	A few things.
797110	799412	I mean, I just... I don't know.
799552	802954	I like independent projects sometimes, and I like stuff.
803355	804416	I like getting things in the mail.
804696	805056	I don't know.
805797	810641	So I... That's not... That's not why I do it, but like...
811832	816901	I don't know why that's so funny, but because it's episode 469, I like getting things in the mail.
817001	820286	My mind goes to porn, dildos, lube.
821248	823732	I have never gotten porn, dildos, or lube in the mail.
823993	824273	Yet.
826800	829142	Yeah, I guess that does open up opportunities.
830063	832045	And I didn't even order it.
832285	834987	Mental note, get return present for Loki.
835528	840952	One of these days, the UPS delivery man is going to be like, somebody just ordered you a 10-gallon bottle of lube.
842774	843074	Thanks.
844895	847698	No, there's actually a website called AlienDildos.com.
847718	851161	You're going to have to get one of the pumping mechanisms.
852261	853823	And I found it through a Mass Effect forum.
855564	856044	All right, anyways.
856405	858666	So I back a few projects every now and then.
859566	861027	And actually, I've done a few recently.
861087	864009	But yeah, the second project I backed was those cards.
864129	865290	Because they were pretty cool looking.
865310	866530	I was like, oh, sweet, Tron cards.
866871	868011	Well, this will be a great gift.
868071	869212	That's exactly what I thought.
869252	870653	I'm like, this will be a great gift.
871153	871974	So I'm going to do that.
872374	873235	And so that's what I did.
873756	877559	And I opened my cards, and yeah, they're pretty awesome.
877980	881703	I don't play a lot of card games, but when I do, I'm going to use those because they're pretty awesome.
882043	886267	There's one... I mean, a perfect example of... Suddenly, Loki just became a gif.
886348	887088	Did you hear that?
887629	889050	I don't play a lot of card games.
889070	891372	But when I do... No, but...
893873	894854	You heard it too, right?
895234	896995	But when I do, I play them on the grid.
897155	901138	No, but seriously, there's been some pretty cool projects on there.
901178	903360	For example, Cards Against Humanity was one.
903720	906702	I wish I had gotten in on because that would have been awesome.
907162	908543	But they have that.
909464	913006	I backed Ouya recently, which we'll see what happens with that.
913066	915788	But I'm pretty faithful that it'll come through.
916408	918029	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
938547	940689	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
955585	958147	It's the funniest website I've ever seen in my life.
958888	960329	This is a, what is that, Rule 37?
960389	961790	What do they call that?
962871	963531	This is a Rule 37.
963651	965292	If it exists, there's porn on it.
965352	968755	It's a website that I actually found through a Mass Effect Tumblr.
969756	970276	Of course.
971117	974499	Well, I have to say that this episode of TTP has only been 26 minutes.
976841	978001	Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
978041	982402	First off, tell us what the website is because I want to come back to this whole discovery of the website in a minute.
982982	983763	What is the website?
983803	984983	I posted it in chat already.
985363	986823	Could you share for the podcast listeners?
986963	991084	AlienDildos.com I don't know if we should be going down this path.
992365	993805	There's already an explicit tag.
993825	994825	There's no stopping this train.
994845	997686	Tell me in what part of Mass Effect fandom...
1000580	1011187	WouldWeRequireAnAlienDildos.com You're taking this FemShep Garrus thing a little too far when you want a model of his wiener as a butt plug.
1012928	1013969	No, I do not want.
1014029	1017351	Turian Butt Plug is taking this obsession one step too far.
1018332	1021574	There's an FAQ for a comic that someone was doing.
1022495	1025497	And someone said, what do you think Turian cock looks like?
1025977	1027158	And she linked to the site.
1030698	1032080	and the artists linked to the site.
1035025	1035665	Who cares?
1038429	1039211	Rule 37 and the internet cares.
1039231	1040673	If there's a fandom, there's a penis in it.
1042355	1043998	That's a true quote if I've ever heard one.
1046769	1047269	Thanks for watching!
1064844	1073648	Speaking of Kickstarter, there is a Kickstarter that's being done by one of our listeners, or he is a part of this company.
1074148	1076510	And it's for a game called Evilot.
1076970	1081712	And Evilot is kind of a defense game.
1082292	1085914	And they've got a pretty low goal to hit.
1086394	1087795	But, of course, they...
1088755	1090416	You need all the help that they can get.
1091036	1093096	So, you know, if you guys can go maybe back them.
1093556	1097578	I mean, if it looks good to me for 15 bucks, you get the game on every single platform that they're releasing it on.
1097698	1098558	I mean, that's kind of.
1099178	1100459	Did they pay for that commercial?
1100619	1101179	I'm just kidding.
1102839	1103860	I will support.
1104540	1108541	I'm just saying, again, Foodie Monster, you know, he's doing animation on.
1108581	1108961	What happened?
1108981	1110022	He hasn't listened in a while.
1110122	1110802	Whatever happened to him?
1111782	1113102	FootyMonster, where are you?
1113343	1114923	Apparently he was working on the game.
1114963	1115643	Busy making games.
1115823	1121865	Well, FootyMonster, I want a Skype call in the coming weeks if you're going to get your Kickstarter wares out there.
1121885	1123305	Yeah, so Evilot.
1124006	1126766	They're about $3,500 of the $10,000 goal.
1127447	1127947	That's not bad.
1128027	1128947	And still three weeks to go.
1129007	1131908	Still be relevant for that call within the next couple of episodes.
1131948	1132468	That's really good.
1132748	1133088	Good job.
1133449	1134550	But yeah, I backed them.
1134610	1138073	So, I mean, because also they're going to make a game for the Ouya.
1138213	1144478	So, you know, hey, I need some games to play on that console that may or may not disappear into the mist like the Phantom.
1147020	1147761	Like the Phantom.
1147881	1148341	Oh, a link.
1148401	1148561	Yes.
1148581	1149622	Give a link in chat.
1150003	1150363	There you go.
1151530	1153911	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1178217	1178577	No!
1179037	1179177	Ew!
1180618	1181798	Everyone knows orcs don't bathe.
1184458	1184918	My bad.
1185719	1187559	Alright, Loki, how about your gaming week?
1188299	1189519	I actually played some different things.
1191020	1192340	Pretty much also the same stuff.
1192620	1194520	I played a lot more Minecraft.
1195081	1198821	Finally got to do some more co-op stuff with my co-worker.
1199822	1200802	It's still getting a little boring.
1200902	1206503	I actually just purchased it on PC, which I'm looking forward to playing around the mods and stuff because my PC probably can handle that.
1207663	1213765	Also, I played a bit of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.
1215226	1215646	Still fun.
1216186	1217466	I'm looking forward to Black Ops 2.
1218147	1223168	And then the new thing I actually played this week was Sleeping Dogs, which is a pretty awesome game.
1224128	1227830	For those who are not aware, it's what True Crime Hong Kong was.
1229310	1232291	It was going to be True Crime Hong Kong before the IP got sold off.
1232951	1251014	and so now it's this brand new kind of open world action game with a lot of you know kung fu and a lot of homages to you know classic kung fu films and crime dramas and all that it has a really kind of feeling of like a Hong Kong action film which is pretty sweet
1251955	1262983	The combat in it is pretty good, but because it's a little bit more sophisticated than Grand Theft Auto, where that combat's just there as a side note because it's mostly guns, guns, guns, guns, guns.
1264284	1271149	This, though, because it does have all that Hong Kong influence, it's a lot of kung fu in there, and so you're having to fight...
1271849	1273230	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1294990	1295251	Outro Outro
1316701	1317301	Thanks for watching!
1338152	1340394	It was... Saints Row 2 was a great game.
1340414	1342036	It was, you know, over the top.
1342156	1346620	They, like, had made it a little bit more over the top than, you know, the first one.
1346781	1348782	And they expanded the features and stuff like that.
1349083	1351585	Saints Row 3 looked like they were going to do even more with that.
1351625	1353547	But then they just went fucking crazy with it.
1353627	1356110	And it makes no goddamn sense whatsoever.
1356510	1359072	It's like if you were... Imagine, if you will...
1360213	1363994	We started off with the Christopher Nolan Batmans, okay?
1364374	1367995	And then all of a sudden, the last movie is a fucking Joel Schumacher Batman.
1368575	1370956	That's how the fucking series has gone with Saints Row.
1371216	1373597	It's just like, okay, that's kind of cool.
1373737	1374717	Okay, that's even cooler.
1374877	1376037	What the fuck happened?
1376137	1381139	I mean, it's just like, why are these things happening?
1381179	1383059	Why is there a Sky Fortress flying around?
1385580	1386320	It's really weird.
1386340	1388961	You have to admit, Saints Row the Third is really funny.
1389514	1392616	It's a fun game, but they whored out the DLC.
1392676	1393777	All the DLC sucked.
1393877	1394497	It's the DLC.
1394517	1401161	The game was Batman Returns where it's like, okay, it's a little different, a little zany.
1401181	1401922	Jim Carrey's in it.
1401962	1402682	He's funny, right?
1403082	1405784	And then the DLC is just Batman and Robin.
1405984	1406345	Yeah.
1406685	1407265	There you go.
1407345	1408206	Perfect example.
1409066	1411108	And then look at what they were trying to do.
1411168	1419733	They were like, oh, yeah, we're going to do this Enter the Dominatrix thing as a standalone game, which right there, like, kind of, I don't know about that.
1419753	1421094	And then they're like, hey, you know what?
1421134	1423396	We're going to take the milking of this property even further.
1423436	1426858	We're just going to incorporate that into a brand new Saints Row IV game.
1426918	1428559	It's like, or the Saints Row IV.
1428879	1429860	Oh, thank you.
1430100	1430400	Thank you.
1430420	1433162	That's going to be fantastic that you're recycling this game for another year.
1433182	1437985	We actually have an exclusive clip from some unreleased DLC for Saints Row III.
1438046	1438486	Let's hear it.
1439066	1442050	Tonight's forecast, a freeze is coming.
1442991	1444252	Allow me to break the ice.
1445093	1446875	You are not sending me to the cooler.
1447135	1447956	Freeze well.
1449157	1450659	What killed the dinosaurs?
1451260	1452161	The ice age.
1454963	1457624	Well that sounds like a pretty cool expansion.
1457764	1459264	I'm going to tell you right now.
1459745	1465386	If the next Batman game that came out was based on Batman and Robin, I would actually probably buy it.
1465526	1468507	Batman and Robin should be a video game.
1468547	1471869	As fucking terrible as that movie was, it's funny.
1473089	1478791	No one's obviously taking this movie seriously if you're casting Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze.
1479931	1481592	That doesn't make any sense whatsoever.
1482552	1484634	That's like casting Tara Reid as a scientist.
1484994	1486415	Oh wait, that's been done before too.
1488657	1490058	But you know, that movie also sucked.
1490118	1490839	Alone in the Dark.
1494041	1497724	WhatupG in our chatroom says, Bane was much better than that Bane.
1498304	1498865	That's true.
1499545	1502828	But I loved the voice they gave Bane in the movie.
1502868	1504749	He sounded like Count Chocula.
1504889	1505930	He sounded Belgian.
1507531	1510514	Didn't Bane in the movie sound like Count Chocula to you?
1512630	1514372	That's what he sounded like to me.
1514412	1515873	He sounded like Count Chocula.
1516193	1517474	And I couldn't take it.
1517514	1522078	Because I'm like, Count Chocula just... Oh, I shouldn't spoil.
1522598	1522919	Alright.
1524920	1526381	Well, it also wasn't a very good movie.
1526461	1527983	Speaking of 13-year time warps.
1528103	1529904	Count Chocula's kind of an asshole.
1531305	1531666	Alright.
1532526	1533027	Anyway.
1535348	1535949	Your gaming week.
1536528	1539531	Yes, my gaming week, if Loki's all done with his gaming week.
1540111	1541993	I actually had quite a bit of a busy gaming week.
1542013	1543534	I have three games I want to talk about.
1544455	1546837	Let's talk first about Pit... I'm sorry.
1546957	1548698	There is... I'm sorry, sorry.
1548918	1550820	There's one thing that is worth mentioning.
1551641	1553042	The Ready Player One contest.
1554273	1555214	Oh yeah, alright, alright.
1555294	1555734	Fair enough.
1556075	1557516	I'm ready for an update.
1557596	1558857	My body is ready.
1559037	1559938	Ready Player One contest.
1559958	1563320	Remember last week, the whole thing I bitched about fucking... You?
1563661	1564021	Bitch?
1564061	1565682	Yeah, I know, I know.
1565782	1566863	Had to break a world record.
1567023	1572968	And it is basically impossible to break the world record of the four games that they started off with.
1573809	1579293	At least, it was impossible for Black Tiger, okay?
1580033	1582575	But I was willing to buy Black Tiger.
1583636	1588900	and make the adjustments so that it was exactly like the machine that had the world record.
1589440	1590361	I was all ready to do that.
1590761	1597526	Right before I actually purchased anything, I went and checked the update on the blog and sure enough, someone had beat the world record on Joust on 2600.
1598366	1602309	And it's been confirmed that he... That was going to be the easiest one to beat out of all of them.
1602369	1603550	That's the most accessible one.
1603570	1604951	That was the only accessible one.
1605271	1606251	That was the contest.
1606712	1606872	Yeah.
1607052	1607312	Really.
1608213	1609774	All that other stuff was just a red herring.
1610734	1610935	Yes.
1611615	1613377	But it was poorly run in the first place.
1613437	1619161	You keep adding games and changing the rules within a couple days from everything.
1619441	1620062	It was ridiculous.
1620462	1622243	But congratulations to the guy that won it.
1623084	1630610	Of course, it still has to be confirmed by Twin Galaxies, but it's been confirmed by whoever's running the contest, I guess, that it looks like it's legit.
1631050	1631731	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1650542	1651763	Alright, thank God too.
1651803	1655026	I was like, you know, maybe I should check something before I make this purchase.
1655046	1656827	Because I was like, okay, I'm going to buy this.
1657367	1660290	I'm going to buy... I would have peed my pants laughing.
1660590	1660770	No!
1661250	1664933	If he comes to the show and just dumps a Black Tiger motherboard on the table.
1665253	1666274	God damn it!
1667075	1668436	Seriously, I'll put it this way.
1668916	1673520	Rob, if I was to buy a Black Tiger board, I would be breaking the world record regardless of...
1674591	1675892	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1698899	1699420	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1713939	1714339	That's cool.
1714959	1716900	Well, I mean, sorry to hear he passed.
1718540	1727282	We actually, unfortunately, have news about another passing, but we'll get to that a little later in the show, because I don't want to down the show too much, because I want to talk about my gaming week, and there's three games I want to talk about this week.
1727362	1740425	First off, on the iOS platforms, Pitfall, which I guess is the 30th anniversary edition, Pitfall or what have you, they really should just call this game Temple Run 2, because that's exactly what this game is.
1740485	1743486	It is Temple Run 2, which is supposedly Pitfall.
1744306	1765264	the only connection to the original 8-bit Atari 2600 version of Pitfall the little opening movie you see it for five seconds and then it transforms into the new Pitfall so what what there wasn't their marketplace or something like that out there that said that they were going to try to eliminate um kind of these copycat games was that Android or something like that or
1766384	1769045	Well, technically, you're not supposed to have them on iOS.
1769205	1771885	But it's Atari, so we're going to let them slide.
1771925	1774046	Well, Activision in this case, even better.
1774406	1778626	But it's just enough different than Temple Run that it's not really a copycat.
1778766	1781587	I mean, you still have the sliding to turn around.
1781627	1782767	You slide up to jump.
1782807	1784427	You slide down to go over the tunnel.
1784507	1791449	But now you tap the screen to whip snakes that might be standing in your path, which the original Pitfall did have snakes.
1791589	1793929	So, you know, they kind of figured out a way to incorporate that.
1794329	1795170	Now, I will say this.
1795430	1800813	To the game's credit, the graphics are above and beyond what, you know, Temple Run's got going on.
1800873	1804595	Not that Temple Run's a bad-looking game, but you play it so much, you kind of see the same thing over and over.
1804935	1807956	The cool thing about Pitfall is that the environments start to get varied.
1808317	1815500	Like, you get to a certain length in the game, and now, like, when you get to 2,500 meters or whatever, now you start running through a cave, and it's, like, drastically different-looking.
1815821	1822024	And then I know in the box teaser, the teaser images that are out there, there's one that's like a mine cart in a fire cavern type of thing.
1822424	1833215	So that's kind of cool that they varied it a little bit, as well as when you start the game, it's kind of like from the side, and then the camera rotates to be behind you more like Temple Run.
1833235	1839621	The way the engine works, it seems like it's capable of more graphically than Temple Run is, but...
1841323	1842124	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1858823	1870470	Pay 99 cents for a token and you can continue from where you left off or pay 99 cents for diamonds and you can dress Pitfall Harry up in a bear costume or a pirate or a tooth fairy.
1870870	1871731	I kid you not.
1872211	1872912	You can dress him up.
1873392	1874452	It's just called fairy.
1874733	1875673	You can dress him up as a fairy.
1877414	1878835	Can you do Pretty Princess or something?
1878895	1881016	I don't know because I'm not going to pay the money to do it.
1881496	1895322	Now, I guess technically you can grind the silver bars, which are basically the version of coins or whatever, but it always leaves a bad taste in my mouth when you ask me to pay for the game up front and then you try to shove these transactions down my throat.
1895842	1902445	And I do not like these constant pop-up messages that are like, don't you want to spend money to continue from this point?
1902705	1903165	No, I don't.
1903185	1904446	Don't you want to buy a costume?
1904806	1905146	No.
1905166	1905446	No.
1905946	1906367	I don't!
1906427	1908689	But he doesn't look like a fairy yet.
1909129	1910370	Don't you want to play as a fairy?
1910951	1917516	I am hating... Based on the fact that you have Grindr installed on your iPhone, we think you might like this costume.
1918618	1925064	But look, I don't like this whole, like, and I will never turn push notifications on for these things either.
1925925	1927366	So that's the other thing.
1928627	1931770	If I had those on, I'm sure I'd be getting messages at 2 o'clock in the morning.
1932050	1933331	Don't you want Makat tokens?
1933972	1934572	We miss you.
1934672	1935813	Don't you want to play some more?
1936054	1939197	So I kind of hate the direction.
1939957	1943380	This whole free-to-play thing is just, I mean, I realize, but it's not really free.
1943420	1945062	It's still 99 cents to get the game.
1946707	1947408	It's not free.
1947648	1948729	It's still pay money for it.
1948849	1951151	Just wait until it goes free if you even want to play it.
1951331	1952252	Yeah.
1952332	1953012	Temple Run's free.
1953593	1956916	It's pretty much the same game, but Pitfall has some varied environments.
1956936	1957156	That's all.
1957176	1959398	You gotta do it free so you can pay those back for transactions.
1959478	1963882	I'm just... If I'm gonna pay the money for those transactions, maybe we should do something about the frame skip.
1963922	1965943	Can I pay 99 cents to have a smooth running game?
1966064	1966324	Thanks.
1968041	1969942	Alright, meanwhile, that's enough about that.
1970062	1971123	Other games I played this week.
1971223	1976966	So for $20 at Fry's on sale or clearance or whatever, I got Connect Disneyland Adventures.
1977466	1983390	Because, you know, this game came out last holiday season and it's Disneyland and I consider myself a bit of a Disney aficionado.
1983810	1985291	So I wanted to check this game out.
1985551	1987292	And I played this game.
1987732	1990034	I played it for a good hour or so.
1991194	1995057	And this is where I really truly realized that I hate the fucking Connect.
1995657	1997198	I really, like...
1998746	2002668	It really is the same mistake all over again like what we have with the eye toy.
2002788	2004029	It's miserable to control.
2004249	2006931	It is an absolute miserable experience to control this game.
2007451	2010313	It's like you have to hold your hand out to turn.
2010553	2012995	You have to put your hand out this way to go forward.
2013315	2019919	And then like if I want to do a hug, I'm supposed to like reach out and try to hug.
2020199	2024161	But then it will think I'm dancing so my character dances instead and like all this stuff.
2024181	2026943	I'm just like can't I just pick up the controller and play?
2027563	2035266	I realize the name of the game is Kinect Disneyland Adventures, but for a bunch of cute minigames about a place I really love, you know what?
2035366	2037566	I'll pay $20 for the controller experience.
2037866	2039627	Can we just take the Kinect part out?
2040327	2040527	No.
2041008	2043268	You can't disable the Kinect in this game, unfortunately.
2044169	2044949	That's too bad.
2045029	2051131	I really do think the killer app for Kinect is dancing games, and that's pretty much it.
2051664	2051945	DarkSakura,
2064841	2065442	So I don't know.
2065702	2068985	I also have to remember this game is made for kids.
2069965	2072688	And here I am, 30 years old, and I'm playing the game.
2073128	2073889	It doesn't matter, though.
2073909	2076871	I mean, that's even worse because kids don't have patience at all.
2077011	2078012	That's very true.
2078412	2084537	If something's going wrong or it's not working, they're just going to kick the TV or throw the connector through the window.
2085838	2091821	Frisbee in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says you have to walk around Disneyland like a zombie with your arms out.
2091881	2093141	Totally true.
2093541	2100965	You can't really do both hands out at the same time because then the game doesn't understand if you're trying to go left or right but it's just silly.
2102265	2110949	Blackwolf from the Bobby Blackwolf show which tapes before us at VOG Network says the killer apps for Kinect are all the non-games like hospital apps.
2111149	2129279	No, obviously, those are killer apps for the PC, because the PC can handle the bandwidth, and they can basically, I think it's like double the data you get from the Kinect versus the Xbox 360, which has to share the bus between all the USB ports on the actual system, so it's limited to what you can do.
2129459	2133302	So, yes, all the hacks are where it's at, but...
2134195	2135396	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2164398	2167560	This way for corndogs.
2167740	2171102	Do they have the churro ride?
2172083	2174804	They have churro carts, but you can't really do anything.
2176325	2178246	There's lots of characters to find.
2178507	2182409	They have a World of Warcraft-esque, believe it or not, questing type thing.
2182729	2185951	Like you find Mickey and Mickey will be like, hello, find Goofy's autograph.
2186131	2187392	Blasphemy.
2187672	2188353	It's interesting.
2189173	2191034	but it's ruined by the Kinect.
2191094	2198779	It needs the people movers and that would be awesome because in the world of Kinect Disneyland Adventures, people aren't dumb and can't fall off those things.
2198799	2200200	They're supposed to have the gondolas again.
2200902	2210450	It would be even better if you could have archival videos of Disney or Disney Ride videos or something that I know Disney would never allow to be put in there, but I just think it would really enhance the experience.
2211251	2215194	I think this idea should be revisited without the Kinect at some point.
2215334	2215814	Seriously.
2216695	2220158	I really wanted to like this game, but I don't.
2220859	2222180	And that makes me very sad.
2223321	2226563	I definitely agree that the killer apps for the Kinect are hospital apps.
2227184	2228745	Oh, I'm putting this scalpel forward.
2228985	2229366	Crap!
2231343	2232845	Thanks, Bobby.
2232925	2238853	That's the other thing that would be interesting because you know how we always have these apps that are like, okay, look, I got this game to work with Kinect.
2239234	2239995	I want to see the opposite.
2240015	2242038	I want to see Kinect games working with a controller.
2243737	2246558	Okay, rdgsinge in our chatroom has a good comment too.
2246618	2248279	Child of Eden was good, right?
2248799	2249099	No!
2249379	2252000	Not with Kinect as the controller.
2252020	2253521	With the controller, it was great.
2254601	2257722	The Kinect thing was interesting to play once.
2257903	2259023	Kamehameha!
2259203	2259723	Kamehameha!
2259883	2262704	Yeah, but it wasn't super responsive.
2262824	2266406	Apparently the PS3 version's pretty good with the move, because the move...
2267066	2272290	Sadly enough, isn't it tragic that the move actually ends up being a pretty good peripheral, but no one cares?
2272310	2274592	The move is actually a really good peripheral.
2274712	2278534	It seriously is an excellent peripheral, and it works.
2278915	2281216	But the thing is, no one fucking cares.
2281737	2285820	It's like Sports Champions, it worked pretty much the entire time.
2286060	2289182	Yeah, you had to calibrate it a couple times, but that was super quick.
2289262	2291564	And you still have to fucking calibrate shit in the Kinect anyways.
2291584	2293325	But on Kinect, you have Lady Gaga.
2294406	2295787	So everybody's like, oh, Kinect.
2297847	2298048	Yep.
2299331	2301418	Anyhow, one more game I want to talk about tonight.
2301759	2303363	Sound Shapes, which is...
2305405	2306546	Sorry, that's the spouse.
2306686	2308007	Did that go over the air?
2308127	2309168	You just got an extra life.
2309448	2311810	Apparently, for plugging sound shapes, I got a one-up.
2312050	2313672	Oh, Dan is evil.
2313752	2314512	My husband's evil.
2315093	2318175	One of our yogurt places has Nutella frozen yogurt.
2318215	2318996	That sounds great.
2319517	2320297	Now put your phone on vibrate.
2320317	2320838	I'm freaking going.
2320878	2321158	All right.
2323380	2323640	Ooh.
2323900	2324621	Well.
2324641	2324621	$4.69.
2324961	2326002	Alien dildo.
2327123	2327423	All right.
2327963	2328644	Sound shapes.
2329945	2334709	On the Vita and the PS3, which I love that you buy it on one and you get it on both.
2335009	2335789	How it should be.
2351554	2352715	PadaPon was a music game.
2369494	2397368	not even that, it's just that the things that you collect, the music is all in the stage design that's what it really boils down to the stage design is where the music it's not necessarily you interacting with the music, it's the environments interacting with the music which is what's kind of cool, it's almost more Child of Eden and Rez like in that regard since those games were brought up, I would say those would be a better comparison actually, but this is more like a LittleBigPlanet style game
2397968	2404370	and the game that this has the most in common with, not just LittleBigPlanet, it's Super Meat Boy in a way.
2404730	2413312	Because it's that whole idea of you can die very easy but you just start from the last checkpoint and try to get over these very difficult parts over and over and over again.
2413792	2417953	But there are some stages in the game that are just really cool.
2418513	2419513	Like the Beck stage.
2420493	2421814	Well, Beck has three stages.
2421854	2426515	That first Beck stage is like the equivalent of Shinin' in Luminous.
2427715	2431618	Like really, it's like the defining moment when you're playing the game.
2432198	2443245	And because the song kind of goes like it's going along and then the lyrics, one part of the lyrics goes, move a little, turn a little, break a little, hurt a little.
2443345	2451049	And like while the lyrics are doing that, the little platforms, they go, it moves a little, then it turns a little, then it breaks apart a little.
2451229	2456853	And then when it goes hurt a little, it turns red, which is the bad thing color, which will kill you if you're still standing on it.
2457273	2486605	and like when I was playing that I was like that's so cool and even Alan was watching over my shoulder and like just the like the little like he'll just sing this ah thing in the background and whenever he's saying that these little cloud platforms appear that you can use that say ah on them and just like playing that stage was just so cool like it was it was neat and that's how it kind of interacts with the music it's very much the environment otherwise it's it's kind of a platformer and it plays a lot like Meat Boy or Little Big Planet
2487265	2501479	obviously because of the online element is a huge part of it too all these stages you can get online that people have made all their own levels and so forth is that very LittleBigPlanet element now just like LittleBigPlanet 90% of them suck
2503040	2505482	But it's kind of neat to see what people come up with.
2505843	2509065	I think the online mode could have been implemented a little better.
2509666	2510586	It is early on.
2510767	2521955	I think the interface doesn't work too well for the online mode, but at least you can kind of track what your friends are doing, and that gives me hope that there's something a little better in there somewhere.
2522376	2523457	But overall, it's a game.
2523717	2524718	Shit, it's a great deal.
2524958	2526439	You get the game on two platforms.
2526479	2527820	If you're PlayStation Plus, it's only $12.
2530112	2533175	It's kind of limited by the number of stages that are actually in the game.
2533235	2541163	I think there's about maybe 15 stages in the game, but it's only a $15 game, and you do have the online stuff, which is virtually unlimited.
2541863	2543265	I think it's pretty good.
2543946	2545387	I had a good time with it.
2546008	2546168	So...
2546971	2547652	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2572910	2575433	Yes, I didn't even think of that, but you're right.
2576214	2578416	The music in New Super Mario Bros.
2578436	2579957	Wii was really underappreciated.
2580298	2582680	Yeah, there is kind of an element to that with it.
2582700	2583021	You're right.
2583281	2585863	You know that goes all the way back to the original Super Mario Bros.
2587085	2587946	I'm sorry, not the original.
2587966	2590728	The original Super Mario World on the Super Nintendo.
2591029	2594032	Because whenever you got Yoshi, you would have that little drumbeat.
2594352	2608447	Oh yeah, that aspect of it, yeah I'm thinking of like the normal the hills will be dancing along the background Oh yeah, I love the way the little Koopas Yeah, the way the little Koopas Yeah, the jumps of the Koopas The little dance is so adorable New Super Mario Bros.
2608487	2609709	was a great game and I can't wait for 2
2611911	2613153	Loki might have a word to say about that.
2613493	2613753	All right.
2614454	2614834	Sorry.
2615375	2617256	Coming up on this episode of Orange Launch Radio.
2617937	2618197	All right.
2618517	2619678	I was reading Kickstarter.
2620079	2621160	Not paying attention at all.
2621280	2621760	Again?
2621981	2622241	All right.
2622301	2623882	So I do recommend Sound Shapes.
2624323	2627285	You don't even necessarily have to like music games because it's not really a music game.
2627325	2629848	It's a platformer that incorporates music elements.
2629888	2631449	And I think that's a really good way.
2631589	2636874	You know, it's that new Super Mario Brothers Wii cranked up to 11 in a way.
2637174	2637334	So...
2638135	2639216	VXJasonXV contributed to this report.
2654611	2668034	Most of my week was lost by preparing for this trip, but I will say that when I was on the train, I was trying to play things that I didn't think would be particularly susceptible to interference by the train rocking back and forth.
2668354	2668974	Yeah, I was wrong.
2669794	2683037	Limbo, Cave Story, Braid, and other various puzzle, platforming, adventure kind of things, I thought that I could manage, but with as violent as the train gets, especially in Nevada, my hands were completely off the keyboard.
2683977	2684778	Flying all over the place.
2685578	2686920	A couple DS games.
2686980	2695627	A friend of mine let me borrow Kid Icarus Uprising, and so now my hands are completely cramped because it's just like the original DS.
2695647	2696808	It just doesn't fit.
2696888	2698869	My hands just don't fit that system very well.
2698910	2705515	I've been trying some of the alternative control configurations, but then you lose all precision and the game just gets bad.
2705655	2706015	I don't know
2727751	2732433	I finally got StarCraft working on my computer again since Mountain Lion kind of broke a couple things.
2732533	2735114	My Diablo still busted, but my StarCraft 2 is working again.
2735254	2737535	That's pretty much the week in a nutshell.
2738175	2738475	All right.
2738775	2741756	Let me go over to Raya and check in on how her gaming week was.
2742677	2743097	It's okay.
2743137	2744557	You don't play Diablo anyway.
2745598	2746438	You're about to make up for it.
2746846	2749128	Yes, I've been playing a lot of Diablo.
2749168	2750949	It's kind of my social hour right now.
2751849	2754571	I also picked up Kingdom Hearts, the 3DS version.
2755052	2756513	I just barely started it.
2757714	2763838	Otherwise, just kind of the find me and the puzzle stuff, because I just picked up my 3DS this last week.
2764358	2767239	Which is that amazingly awesome purple color.
2767299	2767779	I'm sorry.
2768019	2769840	There's a part of me that wants to go sell them.
2770000	2771460	I'm having such a Shane moment.
2772101	2779823	I really hope he's listening because I am having a total Shane moment because the minute I saw that DS, I'm like, I'm about ready to take my DS and sell it in, trade it in, and get that purple one.
2780123	2781884	And the XL is on its way out.
2781984	2785025	If I'm going to get a new 3DS, I need to get that one.
2785045	2789647	But that's the prettiest color handheld I think I've ever seen.
2790087	2790587	For real.
2792594	2797458	It was one of those things that I told myself if the purple one came stateside that that was going to be the one that I got.
2797478	2800080	You know, kind of held off for the color that I liked.
2800420	2802601	And, of course, Kingdom Hearts came out the next week.
2802782	2803702	So, yeah.
2804543	2805143	Good opportunity.
2805964	2806344	Awesome.
2806384	2813169	So, yeah, I know you haven't played a lot of Kingdom Hearts yet, but any early impressions from what you have played?
2813790	2815911	It's a lot to take in in the very beginning.
2816372	2821435	So, I'm still struggling with all the new things that you can do with it.
2821596	2821776	So...
2823113	2825195	And by the way, I have a supporter in our chat room.
2825415	2827817	JV Mon says, the purple 3DS is beautiful.
2827977	2829018	I'm right with you, Rob.
2829659	2830059	Thank you.
2830079	2831300	At least it's not just me.
2832021	2832321	All right.
2833062	2835744	So, yeah, Kingdom Hearts.
2835844	2844011	I saw this hilarious thing floating around Facebook, which was like literally a 40-page Google Doc to try and explain the plot with pictures and arrows.
2844051	2846293	Like, is that the type of thing we have going on in the intro?
2846313	2846393	Yeah.
2847869	2848250	Sort of.
2848390	2851231	It has its own little tutorials for each little thing.
2851251	2854293	It's just so much to take in so quickly.
2856034	2859476	And this is a kid series, right?
2859496	2862278	This is like a soap opera for kids and adults.
2862298	2862798	Let's be real.
2862818	2864379	A lot of adults obviously playing this game.
2864959	2867541	But I think the first one was kind of marketed at kids, wasn't it?
2867681	2868121	Probably.
2868221	2869042	And it's Disney.
2869102	2870443	Who else would the target market be?
2870543	2874065	Yet the official Disney parks continue to ignore Kingdom Hearts.
2874105	2875005	I will never understand.
2875025	2875826	It makes me so sad.
2876446	2877067	So, so sad.
2877447	2878748	Alright, anything else for your gaming week, Rye?
2880109	2880589	Not really.
2881409	2884812	Alright, well you throw something at me if you want the mic to say something a little later.
2885432	2888414	In the meantime, I'm going to plug some things around the interwebs.

2912230	2915833	Lots of great programming throughout the week on that website.
2917134	2921578	If I'm able to get my work done tonight, we're going to have a little more music in rotation.
2921618	2930125	I'm adding a little bit more to the music rotation for this week for those folks that are actually listening and playing games to the VOG Network.
2930325	2934508	I posted something in the forums about how you can play Beat Hazard.
2934969	2936930	You can actually use internet radio on Beat Hazard.
2936970	2942395	Well, you can load VOG Network as one of the custom stations and play Beat Hazard to the music on VOG.
2942635	2943916	Or, if you're so daring...
2944396	2951518	All right.
2953738	2956659	Let's get into some gaming news now that we're an hour into the show.
2956739	2957039	Loki.
2957559	2957999	Sounds good.
2958499	2958820	All right.
2959100	2964441	So let's talk a little bit about what could possibly be the worst thing that happened with gaming ever.
2965836	2968318	Windows 8, at least according to a lot of people.
2968578	2981626	But something else that they're adding to some of the games that you may waste time with in Windows, they're adding achievements to the games you know and love from back from, God, Windows 3.1.
2982186	2985088	I can get 20 points for beating Solitaire.
2985368	2985648	Yes.
2985828	2986249	Yes!
2986429	2989551	You can now get achievements for Minesweeper, Solitaire, and Mahjong.
2990643	2996547	But if you want more deck backs, you're going to have to spend Microsoft Space Bucks in order to unlock.
2996927	2997347	Watch.
2997808	2998668	Fucking watch.
3001490	3002811	I'm not upgrading.
3003031	3005153	Do you want mind hints for Minesweeper?
3006184	3007005	Here's what I want to know.
3007045	3010308	Do you want new faces that will explode when you click on a mine?
3010468	3016053	Where is that go-kart game or that, what is it, the bumper car game from XP?
3016714	3018435	Why do I not see that listed there?
3019276	3020757	I forgot about that game.
3020877	3021238	Damn.
3021818	3022678	That game is awesome.
3022819	3023359	XP, that was 95+.
3023459	3024199	It was 95?
3025220	3025580	Oh, yeah.
3025860	3026480	Oh, yeah.
3026840	3027080	Okay.
3027741	3028721	What about that?
3028981	3032323	And while we're at it, didn't they have a bunch of Windows games?
3032903	3034164	There was Chips Challenge.
3034584	3035584	Where's Chips Challenge?
3035804	3037025	I want some more Chips Challenge.
3037105	3038206	That was a fun game.
3039346	3042548	Maybe that will come in Windows 8 Service Pack 1.
3042728	3049111	They also had all the different Solitaire games and Mahjong games and stuff like that that came with that pack.
3049171	3049791	It was just like, eh.
3050262	3052305	So how are you feeling about Windows 8, Loki?
3052345	3054087	Are you kind of in the It Stinks camp?
3054328	3055309	But you're an achievement whore.
3056731	3057312	No, I'm not.
3057412	3058593	You used to be.
3058814	3059394	I used to be.
3059474	3060916	I'm a recovery achievement whore.
3063126	3066047	Well, admitting you have a problem is the first step.
3066127	3070328	No, honestly, Windows 8 does not look good at all to me.
3070908	3073029	I mean, there's nothing so far that's told me that I need it.
3073049	3077390	It's going to be, for me, it's kind of like one of those intermediate versions.
3077410	3084272	Like, I didn't jump on Vista and I went to 7, so I'm thinking that Windows 9 or whatever the next one's going to be probably will be a little bit better for me.
3085632	3087074	Yeah, actually that's kind of the way it's been.
3087494	3089617	I've always skipped a generation.
3089857	3097226	I didn't do 95, did 98, skipped ME, went to XP, skipped Vista, went to 7.
3097766	3100630	So yeah, this will be the operating system I skip.
3102552	3104592	Windows 8 is interesting.
3104752	3106393	That's kind of the reaction I have to it.
3106433	3112294	But interesting is also the word I use to describe the commercial for Boo Boo Honey Child or whatever that show is on TLC.
3112894	3114054	So, I don't know.
3114094	3114935	Take from that what you will.
3114975	3115835	It would be cool.
3116355	3122256	Windows 8 would be a better operating system if touchscreen monitors were more mainstream.
3124217	3130438	If my laptop had a touchscreen monitor on it, then yeah, Windows 8 would be pretty awesome because you can do all the touchscreen stuff.
3130498	3130658	But
3131778	3134060	I just don't think it's necessary right now.
3134920	3143665	Alright, before we get to the next story, let's go to some comments from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com DarkSakura, why didn't you say this in a microphone?
3143965	3147126	She says, I do believe there is Kingdom Hearts stuff at DisneySea.
3148387	3152549	So, correcting what I said earlier about why does Disney ignore the Kingdom Hearts.
3152569	3153650	Because this is America.
3153910	3154450	That's right.
3154570	3155090	Merica.
3155571	3156011	Merica.
3157728	3158769	We won the most gold.
3158849	3159209	Deal with it.
3159249	3160950	And I really wasn't saying it in reply to you.
3160970	3162471	I was saying it to somebody in chat.
3162691	3163031	Oh, okay.
3163612	3164192	Yeah, Rob.
3164672	3165053	Let's see.
3165073	3167174	Oh, excuse me.
3167254	3168535	Alpha Cananogram is correcting me.
3168955	3170536	Whatever I said, it's Honey Boo Boo.
3170836	3171757	Here comes Honey Boo Boo.
3172497	3173078	My bad.
3173438	3174198	I'm so sorry.
3175239	3178201	Porkchop says, Who the fuck plays Minesweeper anymore?
3179674	3181576	Um, you know, true story.
3181776	3184018	I work in an adult training environment.
3184218	3188682	I teach, you know, adults in a corporate world, basically, like how to do their jobs.
3189103	3199873	And if we ever get people coming through the door that aren't very comfortable with using a computer, because sometimes you get some, like, retired folks that want to take, like, kind of a new job or a new career...
3200993	3225038	and they might not be as seasoned with computers or whatever we will actually assign them to go home and play solitaire to get better use with a mouse and kind of get that coordination it's a very good way to you know kind of get used to that whole hand-eye coordination which many of us take for granted we all grew up on that stuff but for people that didn't grow up on it and kind of have to learn it solitaire is actually a great way to learn it just you know
3225798	3226539	Think about it that way.
3226699	3231445	And then when they come back and tell you, okay, I played Solitaire with my card deck, how's that supposed to teach me computers?
3231505	3237411	Is this some sort of crazy karate kid thing where I go wax a car and I'm supposed to learn Kung Fu?
3237692	3238553	Is that how it's going to work?
3238633	3244099	If I ever had a student say it's a crazy karate kid thing, I'd just give them an A. Alright.
3245595	3246235	Let's be real.
3246836	3247136	All right.
3249077	3249838	What else do I want to say?
3250458	3251339	Oh, the other chat.
3251419	3251839	Yes, thank you.
3251859	3256563	The other comment from GameGuru in our chatroom says, I see you are playing Solitaire.
3256843	3259685	Would you like special Clippy-themed backs for the game?
3260851	3261412	Go to hell.
3281235	3283336	Yeah, I never realized those things stay on forever.
3283496	3284717	How do I turn that off?
3285017	3287779	I think I had one set for Mass Effect 3 or something.
3287799	3288139	I don't know.
3288159	3290080	It's just like everybody gets the little beep.
3290480	3298325	I remember when I learned about how terrible the notification system is that I shut mine off in order to not get them from your friends.
3298765	3300166	I don't think that's possible.
3300807	3301487	Defriend them, maybe.
3304676	3307518	Why don't you just send them a message that says, fuck you, you fucking fuck.
3308038	3309459	I'm already playing it.
3309539	3310660	Why don't you come play it?
3310920	3312201	You want to play, apparently.
3313942	3316443	All right, let's move on with some more news.
3316823	3320386	And that would be me talking about Amazon Game Studios.
3320846	3324108	Yeah, you know, Amazon, the website that used to sell books.
3324848	3326269	Sorry, I love Reginator's comment.
3326469	3326989	What was that?
3327110	3330992	If Windows 8 is interesting, then by that definition, so is a lobotomy and colostomy bag.
3333288	3335630	You can't buy vibrators on Amazon.
3362778	3368242	For the listeners here... I was looking up... Vibrators on Amazon.
3370524	3371664	Think of an excuse, quick.
3371764	3372385	Mass Effect 3?
3372905	3374006	I was looking at Mass Effect.
3374947	3380010	For the record, I know this because of when I was a massage therapist, I was looking up electronic heat packs for necks.
3380551	3383773	And it came to a list of personal vibration assistance.
3385414	3386335	You want a happy ending?
3386355	3386395	No!
3387916	3388156	No!
3390598	3391980	Amazon Game Studios Living Classics
3408760	3412722	I guess it's a hidden object game, but they're calling it a moving object game.
3413082	3414042	Alright, guess what?
3414162	3415623	It's a Facebook game.
3416643	3417664	Yeah, looks amazing.
3417904	3418744	Here's the trailer.
3419245	3422066	We can look at for living classics here, the launch trailer.
3423687	3425988	Oh, you can find moving objects.
3428108	3431330	Oh, that looks like a waste of time.
3433071	3433851	Perfect for Facebook.
3435629	3436049	by the way.
3436530	3440453	Amazon is hiring and alright good luck with that Amazon.
3440493	3442554	Let's just hope you make some games that I want to play.
3443035	3450700	Out of curiosity I went ahead and looked up electronic heat packs on Amazon and they have the weirdest shit.
3450740	3458146	There's no vibrators but there's like screws, the sims, NASCAR 2002 The sims?
3458867	3459747	NASCAR Thunder 2002.
3459947	3463330	How the fuck does that have anything to do with electronic heat packs?
3463550	3465730	There was some kind of bullet casing or something in there too.
3465770	3466691	And vibrating in it.
3468791	3470371	Whatever.
3470891	3472892	Let's move on with some more news, DarkSakura.
3473472	3474852	I was looking at vibrating heating pads.
3475652	3476232	Oh, well, there you go.
3476272	3476752	Vibrating.
3478713	3482133	They're really good to loosen up someone's neck before you work on them.
3483553	3486074	Or loosen up someone's... Never mind.
3486094	3486074	469.
3486554	3489014	You're all children now.
3495286	3496447	Speaking of 10 years ago.
3498589	3504755	Well, how about some Silent Hill news, which has nothing to do with vibrations and everything to do with a dead nurse rape?
3506136	3509659	Okay.
3511841	3512722	Well, it's true.
3513863	3514444	Red Pyramid.
3514844	3515104	Okay.
3515924	3523086	Anyway, as we all know, Silent Hill HD Collection is shit because it was built from unfinished code.
3523227	3523787	End of story.
3524307	3527588	Well, there's going to be a patch out that's only available on PS3.
3528008	3531529	So people who got it on Xbox 360, you screwed.
3531609	3532349	Konami don't care.
3533590	3536130	Boo hoo, go cry a river, build a bridge, and jump off it.
3537851	3538151	What's that?
3538513	3545901	but I was reading something that as long as you have your receipt you're able to send it back to Konami and they will send you a new version of the disc
3547023	3550326	Okay, but Silent Hill HD Collection came out in what, March?
3550706	3552367	Who still has their receipt?
3552628	3560754	You've got to be one of those anal retentive people that actually went and bought a receipt scanner so that way you can scan your different receipts in here.
3561254	3566899	So what if you buy it now and then show them a receipt and then you have them send you a free game on top of that?
3566919	3573885	Well, let me read from the official news source Facebook and Konami's page.
3574585	3576148	Attention Silent Hill fans.
3576709	3582560	If you purchase Silent Hill HD Collection for the Xbox 360 new and from a recognized retailer...
3584471	3585732	Oh, so that's how they're going to get around it.
3585752	3587593	A recognized retailer.
3588453	3590114	Oh, we don't know about this GameStop shit.
3590214	3591694	And still have the original receipt.
3591774	3595536	Please send the receipt to Konami Customer Service for verification and further details.
3595896	3602780	It's only valid for Silent Hill HD Collection Xbox 360 version games purchased on or before August 8th.
3603060	3604501	On or before August 8th, Loki.
3605261	3611684	All requests must be made in writing and submitted on or before October 7th and it is subject to availability.
3612064	3613885	Well, they're screwed because no one knows how to write anymore.
3615419	3617041	Can't we just comment on the Facebook post?
3617141	3626670	But it does say, note, the patch for Silent Hill Downpour for both Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 is currently in development and scheduled for release at a later date.
3626770	3627210	How about this?
3627250	3629753	Why don't they just finish the damn version?
3629773	3632095	How about you just make it right the first time?
3632495	3633596	I'm glad I didn't buy it.
3634036	3636598	I still have Silent Hill 3, the good version.
3637879	3638799	And that's all I care about.
3639119	3641781	Jvmon in chat says, I keep all my receipts.
3641961	3642281	Really?
3643402	3645663	Ragenator says, I have receipts dating back to 2002.
3646504	3648745	And Stan says, I keep my game receipts for some reason.
3648966	3654149	Wow, I'm just... Actually, Dan and I used to save all of our receipts for the electronics that we bought.
3654189	3655690	We still have the receipt for my Wacom.
3656149	3656589	I understand.
3656869	3659250	For big, huge purchases, I get that.
3659510	3665811	Like, when I bought my old TV at Costco, hell yeah, I kept the receipt because Costco has an awesome return policy.
3665891	3666411	Not anymore.
3666932	3667692	Yeah, I mean, they used to.
3667992	3671593	So, like, you know, knowing things like that, hell yeah, I'll keep the receipt.
3671673	3674533	But, I mean, I don't really ever save them for games.
3674593	3675494	Maybe I ought to start.
3675734	3680295	Dan still has his box for his DS that has a post-it note on it that says, This is Dan's DS.
3680395	3680895	Don't buy it.
3682010	3682850	I also love this.
3683251	3689873	When we talk about recognized retailers, Monty Boggs in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, Kmart?
3689893	3690954	The fuck is Kmart?
3691194	3691694	Denied.
3694495	3695916	Hey, I bought a Sonic shirt there.
3695976	3697296	That's about it.
3697456	3700718	I bought a Super Mario Brothers shirt there.
3700758	3701318	I was very happy.
3701987	3729867	JV Mon in our chat says I still have the receipts for those Dunkin Donuts K-Cups I got you lol I drank one yeah don't don't take this the wrong way because the Dunkin Donuts K-Cups were great but they're like half gone now so I even if you had the receipt the store's not gonna take them back because we done drunk them and they were terrible give me my money back they were good they were good a little sugar a little creamer apparently you don't know how this works
3731658	3752955	Rob Coffee Alright, let's move on with some more news I agree, Porkchop Please don't fuck up the Zone of the Enders HD collection Cross your fingers Cosign to that Exactly, it's like, oh hey Yeah, we don't want to patch this But buy our new Zone of the Enders Oh, and by the way, we're still selling this You know, in case you do want a broken game Um
3754196	3774304	So anyways, there was some rumored next-gen Kinect images released on Twitter by a guy that goes by the name SuperDAE, who also apparently has no sense of humor because I made a comment on his little post and he said, don't be an idiot, bastard.
3774464	3775905	Well, Loki, don't be an idiot.
3776545	3785033	I just made the comment because, you know, it's got the little neon characters, the depth map on there, and it kind of resembles, you know, an image from Just Dance.
3785454	3792180	And I made the comment, I'm like, well, that's not an image from the new Kinect, that's just from the new version of Just Dance.
3793001	3797726	Apparently he has no sense of humor because he didn't even say, ha ha, if I were funny, he said, don't be an idiot.
3798817	3800059	Well good, I'm not going to be an idiot.
3800259	3808190	Like someone that would try to buy his supposed development kit for the Durango that he just now put on eBay that's up to $15,000.
3812393	3821937	and basically you're taking his word for it that this is actually an Xbox Durango development kit and it looks like a PC because that's what development kits look like.
3822277	3835243	There's really nothing that guarantees you anyway that this is going to be a development kit other than the fact that I think some other developers saw a picture of it and they're like, yeah, that looks like a development kit, but who knows.
3836414	3842976	But yes, so we'll see if this is legit or not because if it is the real deal, then Microsoft will probably pull it off of eBay.
3843096	3850157	But as of right now, it is, oh, it was ended early because the item was sold for $20,000.
3850277	3855679	Well, $20,000 was the last bid, but it says the listing was ended by the seller because the item was sold.
3856399	3856879	Interesting.
3857259	3858499	So like ended early or whatever?
3858679	3858980	Yeah.
3859060	3859720	Huh.
3860040	3860260	Yeah.
3860460	3861980	I'm surprised you could do that with bids on it.
3862540	3863541	Yeah, I didn't think you could do that.
3863581	3864201	That's interesting.
3864621	3864741	Hmm.
3866218	3867619	Now the question is, who bought it?
3867839	3868379	Gizmodo?
3870099	3870539	We'll see.
3872060	3872380	Alright.
3874541	3881103	Meanwhile, be careful if you are a Blizzard or Battle.net customer.
3881443	3882103	Oh yeah, that.
3882163	3883064	Because guess what?
3883124	3883904	They got hacked.
3885127	3887008	You know the old saying, hacker's gonna hack.
3887569	3894773	But to be fair, Battle.net was pretty upfront about what happened because I think we've learned from history, don't try to hide this shit from your users.
3894813	3895954	They're smarter than that.
3896394	3901157	So Mike Morhaime, the CEO himself, wrote a little letter that says, you know what?
3901997	3902257	Thank God.
3919491	3921112	I was surprised they went this far.
3921192	3936265	They said some data was illegally accessed, including a list of email addresses for global Battle.net users outside of China for players on North American servers, which generally includes players from North America, Latin America, Australia, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia.
3936666	3940789	So instead of saying it was everybody, they said they targeted these specific regions.
3941350	3941630	Interesting.
3941790	3948914	They got the answers to the personal security questions and information relating to mobile and dial-in authenticators.
3949575	3957680	That's pretty bad that they got the personal security question answers because if you use those security question and answers on other sites...
3958740	3960342	It's just like having a password anyways.
3960822	3961823	It is.
3961983	3964545	So that's pretty bad.
3965286	3976995	Now they do say cryptographically scrambled versions of Battle.net passwords, not the actual passwords were taken, but they do think with brute force you could decode one at a time passwords.
3977315	3977735	StarCraft, Battle.net
4002395	4021086	you need to change your password on Battle.net right away and you can do that at battle.net slash account slash management slash setting you know what there's a link right there at Battle.net I had forgotten to do mine so I just did it but can you other than changing your passwords because that's not going to matter if they have your secret questions can you change your secret questions
4021986	4022667	Not yet.
4023248	4024250	So then what the fuck's the point?
4024430	4027034	I can change the password to whatever I want and then they'd be like, oh, awesome question.
4027054	4028036	That's why you have an authenticator.
4028216	4032223	Yeah, I don't think the secret question alone will get them into the account.
4033866	4035607	Especially if you've got an authenticator attached to it.
4035787	4043071	I believe the secret question can only be used to generate a reset request, which still goes to your email.
4043591	4045292	So this is the other important thing.
4045752	4049374	Your email password needs to be unique.
4049614	4056797	In a perfect world, every password is unique, but I understand not everybody can realistically do that with all the websites we sign up for.
4057238	4059979	So your email password needs to be unique.
4061335	4062756	This is just Internet Security 101.
4063717	4067760	If you do not have a unique email password, you are setting yourself up for trouble.
4068060	4068821	Because think about it.
4068881	4074146	Somebody gets your Battle.net password here, or they got your PlayStation password before, your Xbox password or whatever.
4074166	4076107	They're going to use it to get in your email.
4076247	4077989	Once they get in your email, you're fucked.
4078329	4081852	Because all those reset requests, everything goes back to your email.
4081892	4086616	Look at that one journalist guy who got hacked through the whole iCloud reset or whatever this week.
4086636	4087237	For the record.
4087717	4095000	When you do change your password, it also does send you an email that says, if you didn't make the change, click the link so that you can recover your account.
4095020	4096881	Well, his hacking thing was a little different.
4096901	4100743	That was just security flaws with whole social networking and stuff like that.
4102104	4112989	Basically, people called up, added a fake credit card to an Amazon account, and then called back up using that new credit card as authentication for other information.
4113009	4113089	Yeah.
4114353	4118996	Porkchop in our chatroom says, anyone see that guy Francis rage about the hacks on YouTube?
4119537	4122038	No, I didn't, but I love internet rage.
4122098	4122999	I ignore that crap.
4123900	4125801	He tried to eat his authenticator.
4126581	4127382	Oh, that's old.
4128162	4130444	That was about Diablo 3.
4131345	4132525	No, he did a new one.
4133026	4134106	That was all fake anyway.
4134146	4136408	It's just a persona.
4136508	4138509	It's all for hits.
4138810	4140471	It's not as funny when it's fake.
4140851	4143573	You know what's fucking hilarious is that Twilight girl.
4145033	4147574	That's the stuff I live for on YouTube.
4149315	4150815	Why would you cheat on him?
4150936	4151236	Why?
4154097	4154437	Really?
4155837	4157078	Oh, yeah.
4157138	4157458	Really?
4157818	4159899	You've never seen the crying chick over Twilight?
4159959	4161179	No, because I have a life.
4162980	4164921	Tiger Claw, can you find me a link, please?
4165261	4166701	I need to show Jamie this.
4166741	4171203	Can you please find me the crying girl who's losing her shit over Kristen Stewart?
4171627	4172828	I usually have better stuff.
4173808	4176210	You know, the best thing is like, oh, she quit acting.
4176370	4177310	When did she start?
4180152	4184074	Well, Jamie, if you wish to take us back on track, then by all means, give us another news story.
4184715	4187236	Well, it sure as fucking about no talent, bitch.
4189498	4189918	You know what?
4189958	4191239	I accidentally closed my story.
4191519	4192099	Oh, yeah, here we go.
4193080	4195061	How about Diablo?
4197922	4203872	It was funny, I had a friend in Alabama who played a lot of Diablo, except with a thick southern accent, so it was Diablo.
4206236	4206736	Blow.
4207177	4207538	So anyway.
4208119	4208860	Diablo.
4208940	4209541	Diablo.
4210142	4210863	Occasionally.
4214244	4217707	La la la la la, I don't need to know that
4238247	4250394	They are trying to make things a little bit more attractive, so they're going to be removing the averaging of Magic Find and Gold Find in multiplayer so that you will benefit from full Magic Find independent of other players.
4252563	4254424	Let me go to the resident Diablo fangirl to check in on Patch News.
4281525	4285308	So that's why you said it, so that people have to ask in order to join.
4285628	4285968	I did.
4286169	4286609	I did.
4286629	4288611	They still joined my game.
4288811	4289091	Really?
4289311	4289511	Yes.
4290232	4292333	Of course, this was before any patching had been done, so.
4292353	4292594	Gotcha.
4293314	4297457	Yeah, on the whole magic find, gold find, yeah, my shit is my own.
4297778	4302301	You know, I build up my gold find, I build up my magic find, that shit is mine.
4302401	4304523	It should not matter what yours is.
4305023	4305424	DarkSakura.com
4317757	4344173	and this is why I'm still level 22 and she has 260s there's more but wait, there's more weapon damage is also going to be retooled so basically it's I'm just going to read the quote one of the general improvements we'd like to make to our item game addresses the difference between an item having a chance of being good versus knowing the item isn't going to be good before you can even identify it
4345074	4360494	so they're basically trying to have a raw damage level between 61 and 62 weapons so that it can hit the top of 63 I think however they explained it I have no idea because like I said I didn't play that much
4361423	4366925	And then, Enraged Timers are being removed from Champion and Rare Monster Packs.
4368045	4375407	They will still be on bosses, but they will not be... Basically, they don't want to have you have to do a DPS check.
4377808	4378048	What?
4380929	4382229	Rai asked, do you know what that's getting at?
4383069	4385030	No idea, because all I know is Enraged Timers and WoW.
4385453	4385733	Wow.
4385753	4385853	Wow.
4413789	4414410	That's stupid.
4416092	4426243	Another thing too is that repair costs are going to be on high-end items are going to be decreased by 25% and a bunch of other changes that are going to come out later.
4426283	4427144	It's on the development blog.
4429041	4439909	Diablo 3, patch 104, seal of approval by Rai And sorry, still no PvP Maybe I'll play again It was free, why not?
4440530	4451658	I signed the blood pact We're gonna get into release dates, but before we do, let's give DarkSakura a little culture lesson I'm saying that she's sorry, like that makes it okay
4455819	4457660	I feel like everybody needs to back off, okay?
4458621	4459922	This is none of your business.
4460242	4461944	This is none of anybody's business.
4462784	4468969	But her releasing that statement, it's like saying, hello world, come on in.
4469589	4471771	It's like saying it doesn't matter, it's okay.
4471791	4475314	Oh, I don't understand how she could do this!
4476721	4481602	Let me fast forward a little bit because I want to see if there's more breakdown.
4482122	4484683	I love him, I love him, I'm so sorry, okay?
4485983	4487783	If you loved him that much, you wouldn't have done it.
4489204	4491144	If you cared about him that much, you wouldn't have done it.
4491944	4496025	And if you wanted people to back off and not be involved, then you wouldn't have posted that statement.
4496205	4501247	But, you see, the thing is, you were stupid enough to get photographed doing it, okay?
4501647	4503127	Don't be so stupid!
4504511	4506832	I can't help it, but that accent's awesome.
4506852	4509694	There's like a level of sophistication to that.
4509814	4515537	I was going in between going, that's a pretty cool accent, and then going, but she's so stupid.
4515898	4516778	I want to point this out.
4516798	4517659	I don't think she's stupid.
4517919	4520180	She's very much a fan of this person.
4520280	4522221	This is when fandom goes sour.
4522241	4523342	This is 2.5 million views on YouTube.
4529205	4530466	And you just added to it, Rob.
4530486	4531087	What the hell?
4531828	4534490	By the way, bless you, TigerClaw, for finding this for us.
4534670	4535952	I can always count on you.
4536652	4538754	2.5 million views on YouTube.
4539195	4540976	Do you know how many people listen to this show?
4541797	4542458	Far less.
4545672	4547473	Maybe I should do a parody.
4547613	4553317	My favorite is the related videos on the side, such as Tom Cruise liked my nail polish.
4554458	4555098	Oh, it's her too.
4555118	4556319	I've just been to McDonald's for breakfast.
4556339	4557840	You can kind of see there's a stage at the top.
4557960	4559941	And there's going to be a band playing, but we don't know who.
4561602	4563903	I want to get to Tom Cruise liking my nail polish.
4563923	4564344	Where is it?
4567245	4567966	Live radio.
4568186	4571708	Okay, Breaking Dawn Part 2 trailer reaction.
4571728	4572629	I've seen this before.
4572669	4573469	It's so amazing.
4573850	4574570	This video is like...
4577620	4580062	Where she's crying through the whole thing.
4580222	4581483	Oh my god!
4581583	4582523	Oh my god!
4595253	4598576	That was me watching the trailer for Mists of Pandaria, actually.
4600597	4604340	It could still be anyone watching the trailer for Breaking Dawn because it is that bad.
4604360	4607823	We need to do one of those for Showgirls and send it to Peaches.
4608624	4618632	Oh, actually, actually, the trailer just came out for the Mass Effect 3 Leviathan DLC and we actually have Shane's reaction here on video.
4618652	4621854	Volturi, they're coming for us.
4622295	4622475	No!
4629362	4630164	We love you, Shane.
4633348	4634209	It's not in chat.
4635603	4663694	I don't see him let's move on he went on a work trip so he's in another city right now and he's probably asleep because he was up for like 27 hours straight he said he was going to try and listen on his phone tonight but he's got to be asleep which is great because I've talked shit about him like three times so far in tonight's episode well maybe we'll find out in about an hour yeah right no I would have got a text message by now they would just say I'm not that bad just say jerk
4665175	4665455	All right.
4666897	4667578	Oh, Shane.
4667758	4668579	Release dates.
4669460	4671683	Let's travel around the world and look at some release dates.

4680693	4681154	Here we go.

4718096	4720118	But I love the Wii.
4721019	4722160	I love you Wii.
4724682	4727084	I loved Wii when nobody would love Wii.
4729987	4732149	There, there, there, there.
4735410	4736250	You can love your Wii.
4737571	4743554	I was out there getting signatures outside of GameStop for Apparition Raid.

4819648	4824671	There was an exchange student in line behind me at Target and... Never mind.
4826393	4827774	No, actually this did happen the other day.
4827794	4829255	That was the worst story ever.
4829295	4830235	Congratulations.
4830355	4833938	Actually this did happen is that I helped her pick out a flavor of breath mints.
4834598	4835079	True story.
4835119	4835799	Cool story, bro.
4838661	4839001	And Rob.
4839762	4840002	What?
4840963	4841563	Alien dildo.
4842804	4848148	On the PlayStation 3 in Japan this week from Hamster is the group putting it out.

4856987	4863750	Going to the 3DS, Boku wa Koku Kansai-ken, Airport Hero 3D Honolulu.
4864370	4867872	I don't know if that's kind of like the flight game on the iPad.
4868432	4870013	No, I don't think it's Alien Dildos, actually.
4870974	4881182	And lastly, taking a look at the Vita real quick, Next Revolution, Taken Shiken comes out as well as Tokushu Hudobu comes out this week.
4881542	4886287	Kind of a slower week in Japan, sorry to say, but a game to get really excited about.
4886307	4891191	And I know, I know this is a game many of you at home would be losing your shit over like the Twilight Girl.
4891631	4893493	Hatsune Miku Project...
4895287	4896487	Sadly, she wasn't joking.
4896907	4899448	That from Sega coming out on August 30th.
4899508	4900488	What?
4901508	4901789	All right.
4902989	4904249	That's it for Japanese release dates.
4904289	4905509	Let's go to UK release dates.
4905990	4908670	On the 13th of August, we have Iron Brigade on the PC.
4909670	4913191	I was just trying to make it sound more authentic.
4913451	4916992	15th of August, we have Dust and Elysian Tal.
4917672	4918352	That's what it says.
4918712	4919793	And Elysian Tal.
4919893	4920333	Oh, Tal.
4921465	4922827	God, you know it says tall?
4922987	4924470	I'm like, what the crap?
4924730	4926673	They need to fix their typefaces.
4927394	4930499	And on the 17th of August, we have a new Super Mario Bros.
4930799	4931720	2 on the 3DS.
4933623	4935286	Now available at retail in the U.
4938146	4938607	Dota 2 Dota 2 Dota 2
4959545	4960726	But apparently it is.
4961166	4967130	And apparently someone copied a mace that's from the MMO Aeon.
4968151	4971053	And just so you know, I don't think Dota 2 is officially out.
4971293	4972794	I mean, chat room, correct me if I'm wrong.
4972854	4975035	I think it's just one of those betas like everybody's in.
4976116	4976656	Oh, okay.
4977297	4978837	I think that's got a really open beta.
4978917	4979177	Okay.
4979678	4993064	Anyway, so apparently they discovered this weapon in there, and of course they removed the item and issued a warning to the players that this kind of crap is not going to be tolerated.
4993404	4997285	Not only did they do that, they also removed the maces from everybody's inventory.
4997606	5001447	They replaced it with a new item, and they also banned the...
5003348	5011535	You know, banned the person that made the actual weapon and stripped his account from all the proceeds from the sales.
5011575	5015859	So apparently there's real money transactions going along with these weapons.
5015939	5018882	I think it's kind of like the hats in Team Fortress and all that stuff, yeah.
5020407	5020787	Burn It In 10,000 Fires
5039949	5069222	you know they don't have enough people saying you know there's I guess not enough people looking at stuff that's on their marketplace maybe that's the problem because they do I know ban people when stuff's discovered but and thank you chatters GameGuru confirming it's not out it's still in beta and Porkchop says it's been a beta for ages now so basically it's like Gmail Gmail was in beta for what five years all right okay all right it's just a new layer of beta
5070060	5073201	Something else has been sitting dormant for years and years.
5073321	5074401	This is crazy.
5074501	5077142	Oops, I didn't mean to have that autoplay, but there you go.
5078222	5085284	The sounds you hear in the background, the sounds of the NBA Jam XXX prototype is what they're calling it around the internet.
5085604	5087884	That doesn't mean NBA Jam XXX.
5090905	5091506	Acronym fail.
5091586	5092286	With boobies.
5092306	5101572	Okay, that's not what they mean by triple X here, but it's actually the original cartridge got shipped to this website, NintendoPlayer.com, where they like to discover these prototypes and whatever.
5102013	5113821	And this particular board got sent to them that was an NBA Jam work in progress, and it has Jam written over one little chip there and then XXX over the other chips.
5114381	5115162	He's fucking up!
5115202	5116182	Yes, he just said he's fucking up.
5151292	5154294	So, LOL, the F word is all over the game, basically, right?
5154975	5164361	Well, some folks obviously are questioning its authenticity, including the guy who did the original voiceovers himself, who basically said, Oh, wow, that's pretty crazy.
5164941	5168343	Yeah, somebody sounds just like me out there doing these acts on the internet.
5169364	5190477	but it appears this website actually released they say download right here you can actually download the ROM and try it for yourself so I don't think it's just the YouTube you can actually check this out so they did dump the ROM and you can check this out and I don't know if you would just be able to insert in your own clips or whatever I think you could ROM hack that and then you can burn the ROM chips onto the cartridge
5190802	5202433	Yeah, but I think it's also plausible, you know, when you're in the sound booth doing recording, and this was even said on some website somewhere, some forum post I got linked, and I apologize, I don't have it in front of me, but it totally made sense.
5202493	5207457	If you're doing voiceovers for hours and hours of these lines, you're gonna do some funny ones.
5207477	5208979	You're gonna have some zany outtakes.
5208999	5211241	You're gonna have some moments of stress relief where you just go...
5211621	5211821	Hot Coffee
5225076	5227717	Have you... Lock and key, but still in the game.
5228937	5239441	I remember a video that I saw, I don't know, quite a couple years ago about basically outtakes of Casey Kasem's Top 50, or Top 100, whatever he used to do, that he would be recording bumps for radio stations.
5239481	5243782	It's like, the home of the best radio in Illinois, and that's the cut of the take, and then...
5244402	5246064	How do I fucking know they're the best?
5246664	5249286	And similar situations like that.
5249447	5258094	And it's not impossible for somebody to have a similar voice plus effects sound the same back to the future release in the last two years.
5258514	5261016	There's also the outtake of, oh god, I can't remember his name.
5261056	5261737	Who was Elmer Fudd?
5263536	5280244	I don't think I've heard this and I'm really sure it's Christopher Walken doing all those playthroughs of different games I'm really sure it's him watching the playthroughs for that or reading where the wild things are and all that stuff
5281741	5282903	Bless you, Internet.
5282963	5283724	Bless you, Internet.
5283744	5285026	Here's what Jason was talking about.
5297943	5304589	Dear Casey, this may seem to be a strange dedication request, but I'm quite sincere, and it'll need a lot if you play it.
5305289	5307071	Recently, there was a death in our family.
5307731	5312515	He was a little dog named Snuggles, but he was most certainly a part of... Let's start again.
5313656	5314697	From coming out of the record.
5315058	5315658	Play the record, okay?
5315678	5315878	Please.
5317500	5317820	Please.
5322360	5326942	See, when you come out of those up-tempo goddamn numbers, man, it's impossible to make those transitions.
5327382	5329163	And then you gotta go into somebody dying.
5329623	5331124	You know, they do this to me all the time.
5331184	5335846	I don't know what the hell they do it for, but goddamn it, if we can't come out of a slow record, I don't understand it.
5336166	5337007	Is Don on the phone?
5337727	5345650	Okay, I want a goddamn concerted effort to come out of a record that isn't a fucking up-tempo record every time I do a goddamn death dedication.
5346831	5351253	Now, make it, and I also wanna know what happened to the pictures I was supposed to see this week.
5352142	5353123	We'll do it live!
5353924	5354524	Essentially.
5354604	5357466	So, those things can happen, y'all.
5359388	5364032	No, I'm not saying this announcer guy lost it on Casey Kasem or Bill O'Reilly levels, but, you know.
5364693	5366814	Casey Kasem is awesome.
5366874	5368696	His show would be even better if he did it that way.
5368716	5369256	Transformers.
5371058	5372579	He was the voice of several Transformers.
5374741	5377243	You're in a confined booth for God knows how many hours.
5377603	5379085	You don't think moods start to change?
5379525	5380526	Go a little off-script?
5382401	5383342	Anyhow, I don't know.
5384103	5389228	I mean, the fact that there actually is a ROM of it out there makes it a lot more believable than just the video.
5390730	5396836	Granted, a lot of work, but why would somebody do that much work just to put the F word?
5396996	5400139	Especially a website that's dedicated to this kind of crap anyways.
5400460	5402141	I don't think they'd go make something up.
5404418	5405159	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5421304	5421985	Thank you for watching!
5444483	5445763	and all varieties.
5445863	5447704	Are they tossing the salad?
5447724	5448924	No, that's another site, Rob.
5449164	5455206	Kotaku will run a... Well, Kotaku will run anything, so I don't even know where you're going with this story.
5455246	5457687	I understand this, but I'm just saying they run a feature every week.
5457767	5462268	It's about stock footage of people playing games, and it's just weird shit.
5462508	5463509	There was the one where...
5464669	5475874	This chick is playing, this emo chick is playing this game laying off of a couch somehow and her friend has a hookah next to her, a non-lit hookah, smoking it.
5476394	5478895	It's like, why would you need sock footage for that?
5481236	5482057	Hipster gaming?
5482137	5484038	You want to get high and play some sound shapes.
5487899	5489240	More like whatever sinks your battleship.
5490908	5491529	DarkSakura.com
5510967	5512748	You little shit, I mean, sucker.
5513648	5515148	You should play this video game right now.
5515388	5517889	If you're into shirtless bestiality, you want this game.
5521170	5523931	And what game could you ever be talking about, DarkSakura?
5524511	5525251	Altered Beast.
5528452	5529853	Which I really don't think I've ever done.
5533441	5536642	There we go, we had to have it.
5537642	5542124	In Japan, it was called Juloki, which is Beast King's Chronicle.
5542144	5547965	It came out in 1988 by Sega, and it's a go-around-beat-shit-up game.
5548846	5555908	It's set in ancient Greece, and it's a centurion who is resurrected by Zeus to rescue Athena, like Zeus ever cared about his kids.
5557448	5562432	and so he is able to turn into different beasts when you get this little power up sphere thing.
5563293	5565815	He just turns into big dude and then turns into animal man.
5567456	5570959	It came out on several video game consoles and computers at home.
5572000	5583830	It was a pack-in game for the Mega Drive and one of the designers for this was Makoto Uchida who was the creator of Golden Axe.
5585111	5586312	Stylistically you can see
5586972	5587532	Thanks for watching!
5607138	5618240	When you get to Hell, or Dis, I should say, you face Neff, who becomes a huge rhinoceros guy, and then a bluebird comes out of the ground and turns into Athena, so it's very acid-trippy, too.
5620301	5631083	It is side-scrolling, and it has been on damn near everything, so the orbs that you get through the game will make you bigger and badass-er with huge muscular thighs and abs.
5632183	5640033	and you turn into a werewolf, a were-dragon, a were-bear, a were-tiger, or the golden werewolf.
5641614	5646160	There's other different beasts in the Famicom version and in the Game Boy Advance version.
5648222	5664219	and sometimes you get lightning power at any rate you also have some very weird unicorn creatures in one of the levels that just sort of tries to headbutt you to death
5664759	5665820	Dry Queen Unicorns.
5665900	5666860	They were my favorite.
5666880	5667000	I know.
5667020	5668001	The Dry Queen Unicorns.
5669301	5671722	It's like, I just would always laugh my ass off seeing them.
5672883	5677265	So what it came out on is... I hear giggles.
5679332	5680652	It's just the chat room acting up.
5681113	5681773	Oh, what's new?
5682613	5684974	Travis, I'm gonna bench you over my knee and spank ya.
5685674	5688115	And not in the good way for 69th episode.
5688155	5689035	The fuck you said?
5689055	5689636	Nah, it's nothing.
5689656	5689936	Don't worry.
5690136	5691216	Get back to the classic game.
5691456	5691796	Alright.
5693477	5699919	So it came out for the Sega Master System, the PC Engine, PC Engine CD, Famicom, Atari STZX, Spectrum, Commodore 64, Rob.
5701940	5721512	The Armstrad CPC, Commodore Amiga, and DOS The Mega Drive slash Genesis version is important because it was a pack-in game for North America, Europe, and Brazil and then it was replaced by Sonic the Hedgehog There is a handheld version of the game done by Tiger Electronics God, what is funny?
5723275	5724537	I'm not allowed to smile?
5725178	5727200	But you're doing the nose laugh.
5728021	5731806	I'm laughing because Travis spoke up in chat and said, yeah, baby.
5731826	5732486	Okay.
5732566	5734629	And I threatened to spank him, so I'm laughing.
5736251	5738333	Remember, it's only porn if you tape it.
5740304	5740965	Yeah, baby.
5741645	5749368	The Mega Drive version is on several compilations, including the Sega Smash Pack, Sega Genesis Collection, and Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection.
5751009	5752730	And on the latter two, they are unlockable.
5752770	5755051	You can get it on the virtual console for Wii.
5756431	5766396	It is on Xbox 360, Xbox Live Arcade, and on the PlayStation Network as the arcade version with HD support and has online... What?
5769483	5771164	Online Leaderboards, and Network Play.
5771784	5777246	There's an iOS version of the Mega Drive version that came out in 2010 for the iPhone and iPad.
5778046	5780547	Because all the good stuff comes out on iOS and not Android.
5783429	5797794	There are a lot of the lower technically versions that only had single player and four levels and had different beasts like a human shark in the NES version.
5797814	5798475	It was very weird.
5799557	5803618	Project Altered Beast Project Altered Beast Project Altered Beast Project Altered Beast
5827463	5829685	But it had like tons and tons of gore in it.
5830685	5834227	And it basically was kind of unrelated to the original game.
5834287	5838509	You played as a dude called Luke Custer, who was a genome cyborg.
5839490	5850536	And his DNA and genetic makeup was screwed so that he could turn into a werewolf, a merman, a garuda, which basically is like an eagle, a wendigo, a minotaur, and a dragon.
5851736	5854098	And then you could also be like a were-tiger and a grizzly bear.
5854278	5855979	So bears in video games, huh?
5856799	5886251	and then there was Altered Beast Guardian of the Realms which was developed by 3D6 Games and published by THQ that was a sequel for the GBA version and you could turn into a werewolf, a snake man a dragon a tiger man, a spiked turtle a shark man, a rhinoceros man an eagle man a scorpion or a chimera or yeah so that's it
5887925	5888907	Alright, there it is.
5888987	5890269	Your classic game of the week.
5890469	5891130	One last thing.
5891872	5895998	Neff, the bad guy, will be in Rhinoceros form in Wreck-It Ralph.
5896940	5897240	Oh, okay.
5897481	5898662	In the Bad Guys Anonymous scene.
5899363	5899564	Nice.
5900956	5902497	All right, Ultra Beast, your classic game of the week.
5902537	5905618	Now, some folks in chat are thinking, wasn't this a classic game of the week before?
5906119	5906919	Actually, it wasn't.
5907139	5908660	Here's where it came up on the show before.
5909340	5922346	Not that long ago, the Genesis Collection or whatever, the reimaginings that were on the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade, they went free for PlayStation Plus subscribers that same week I signed up for PlayStation Plus.
5922746	5927529	So I went back and played through this entire game, and I think I did this whole rant on those unicorns.
5928109	5932090	So I have talked about this game on the show previously, but it wasn't technically a classic game of the week.
5932290	5933690	That was a little while ago at this point.
5934350	5936651	So, just to clear up any confusion.
5938291	5942072	But I do remember when I played through it, it's pretty terrible.
5943312	5946453	Now, keep in mind, I had to play the Genesis version, not the arcade version.
5947093	5949574	We actually just, I think, played through the Genesis version not long ago.
5951854	5952554	No, I take that back.
5952714	5953314	Sega Ages.
5954255	5954795	We played through.
5954815	5955515	All right.
5956530	5957191	Alright, so there it is.
5957211	5958812	Your Classic Game of the Week, Altered Beast.
5958993	5959893	Let's take a break.
5960354	5963938	Obviously, it's been a lulzy show so far, but the best is yet to come.
5964538	5965099	Nah, I don't know.
5965139	5965820	I'm just saying that.
5965840	5969123	But you don't know what's going to happen on Part B of Orange Lounge Radio.
5969143	5972887	We're going to get to the emails, FUs of the Week, and phone calls.
5973107	5974749	Oh, anything can happen during phone calls.
5974869	5977672	All when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5984048	5991671	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 469, already in progress.
5991751	5994332	We've had quite the night so far.
5996653	5998434	Okay, I have coffee.
5998574	6008378	I was talking to Alan in the other room during the break and he's actually listening to the show while he plays Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, which by the way, he has a disgusting collection of Mass Effect 3 multiplayer.
6008698	6010358	I saw the guns.
6010618	6011459	Outstanding, huh?
6012399	6020205	He said he was about ready to come out here and tell us, no, stop it, stop it, during the release date segment.
6020925	6024288	But anyway, we'll see what happens in this part B of our program.
6024308	6026990	The song was not about alien dildos, porkchop.
6027090	6029632	Now the podcasters will have no idea what you're talking about.
6030552	6035396	But during the break, we played a song from Mass Effect, the long song that's the credits during the first game.
6035416	6038758	Unless you have DLC and then the song mysteriously stops and you still have credits.
6038778	6039179	Yeah.
6042583	6047690	I had another same length of the song plus some of no music.
6050071	6050311	What?
6051652	6067037	For Mass Effect 2, I had so much DLC because I bought the collector's edition because it was 11 bucks and came with the first Mass Effect, which I already bought, that I seriously had the length of the song plus some of nothing.
6067197	6068297	So I just went to the bathroom.
6070638	6071158	Cool story.
6071258	6071539	All right.
6072399	6078101	Let's get into some rapid fire news and some quick stories about some things going on in the gaming world this week.
6078161	6078381	Loki?
6079082	6086884	All right, so Minecraft Pocket Edition has gotten an update where they've added a few things that you can find in the full-fledged version on PC and Xbox 360.
6088284	6091245	Well, 360 not being entirely full-fledged, but you get the point.
6091665	6098766	Anyways, they've added skeletons and spiders as well as bows.
6099387	6105388	So now you can fire bows and arrows or fire arrows at a... Spiders and skeletons and bows, oh my...
6107961	6108341	I'm surprised.
6108982	6112145	I thought they already had skeletons in the game, but maybe I'm just mistaken.
6112445	6113446	Maybe it was always zombies.
6113706	6118770	I haven't played much of the Pocket Edition, but I do play it sometimes when I'm stuck somewhere and I'll have my phone.
6120571	6125075	Skyrim is getting the 1.7 update on consoles.
6125876	6131921	It'll be coming out, and of course it includes a number of bug fixes and optimizations and stuff like that.
6132661	6137783	And they'll be coming out on Xbox and also PC at some point.
6138083	6139524	Or PS3 at some point.
6140484	6143085	And still no word on Dawnguard for PS3.
6143465	6144145	You don't get it yet.
6144886	6147367	Because they're just not satisfied with... When it's ready.
6147887	6148567	Exactly.
6149127	6150528	Well, we're satisfied.
6152088	6167720	and then last but not least Cabela's you know they're really trying hard to figure out a way to make Cabela's interesting and so now the latest thing they have is they kind of modified their top shot gun because they actually for the last few games they've had this
6168220	6169221	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6189173	6193375	and I guess based on that, it will affect the game.
6194015	6195876	So is that like the Wii Vitality Sensor?
6195896	6196316	Sort of.
6196336	6197657	Okay.
6198197	6208422	But, you know, had they pitched it instead of saying, it'll make you healthy and blah, blah, blah, they could have made it, you know, the Wii Vitality Sensor, we're gonna throw dangerous animals at you.
6208482	6210542	I mean, that might have been a little bit more interesting.
6210582	6218586	Like if the Wii Vitality Sensor had been for like Tokyo Jungle, which is a PlayStation game, so I know that makes no sense, but, you know, work with me here for a minute.
6218746	6220287	Yes, something like that.
6220767	6222829	But that's coming out on the 23rd.
6222929	6224330	That's Dangerous Hunts 2013.
6224370	6227712	Because they have two Cabela's games that come out each year.
6227892	6230494	Actually, last year they had three on the same day.
6231395	6232155	Why?
6232836	6237679	Oh, that also happened to be the week before Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 came out.
6238159	6239380	So no one gave a shit.
6241198	6243580	Can I interject a little story about something like this?
6244120	6249424	I actually hadn't heard of this before, and something kind of interesting that not a lot of people may know as a result of the situation.
6250845	6260671	Fatal Frame 1 through 3 were all PlayStation 2 games, and then Fatal Frame 4 came out on the Wii and actually incorporated motion controls, etc.
6261532	6267816	In Japan and Europe, they re-released Fatal Frame 2 under the Fatal Frame 4 controls, and it's amazing.
6268096	6269277	I wasn't a big fan of 4.
6269377	6270938	First 3 games, absolutely loved them.
6272800	6291637	The relevance here is that Fatal Frame 2's re-release has minigames, and they actually implemented something like this, they attempted to, where you basically walk through a haunted house in a Fatal Frame 2 scene, and they basically measure fear as a result of movement in the nunchuck and the Wiimote.
6292097	6292538	and DarkSakura.
6311420	6312700	It's a nice little implementation.
6312820	6316542	The re-release happened mid, late last year, earlier this year.
6316982	6329748	I don't think it's going to come out in America, but the situation, the fact that they actually took something like that and went forward through it, it's kind of a cool application because the Wiimote's going to know when you throw your hands up and freak out as, well, a little kid would anyways.
6329948	6330749	I haven't, I swear.
6333090	6334731	Rye, would you care to comment on that?
6335711	6337732	Actually, he's pretty calm when playing those games.
6337792	6339593	It's very fun to watch Jason play those.
6340307	6342449	Does Jason ever lose his shit over any video games?
6344090	6344791	That's a good question.
6344831	6345952	That is a really good question.
6345992	6347833	I don't think I've really seen him lose his shit.
6348133	6359803	I've seen him where he'll pause it and kind of look away and that kind of thing, but nothing like getting up and screaming or jumping from something that's... Not like the boys at 4Player Podcast.
6360003	6362064	Yeah, not like one of our other friends.
6362485	6363826	He's very, very scared of them.
6364186	6364767	You can tell.
6366022	6369244	Has he played much of Amnesia?
6369324	6370585	Maybe that's the game we need Jason to play.
6370605	6373547	There's Amnesia and then there's also Ender.
6380442	6381463	Amnesia is on my list.
6381523	6384967	I do have it in Steam, and it's on my list eventually.
6385147	6385508	Slender.
6385528	6386329	I'm sorry, not Ender.
6386429	6387971	I've been confusing Minecraft again.
6389813	6390834	Well, Slender.
6390994	6394638	It's based on the Slenderman stuff, but they have Slender.
6394698	6398042	People get fucking freaked out by that game.
6398303	6398963	What is this on?
6399304	6399784	It's on PC.
6401104	6407568	One of my co-workers was talking about it, and it's one of those things that I forgot the name of it, so I couldn't come home and say, hey, Jason, you need to play this.
6407628	6409209	So Slender and Amnesia, huh?
6409770	6430864	Slender is all about walking through the forest and you have to find notes, but the Slenderman, you see, he stalks you, and occasionally you'll walk into, and it's all at night with a flashlight, and if you look at him, the longer you look at him, the more damage you take, and you're not supposed to look at the Slenderman.
6431204	6431864	I'm intrigued.
6432324	6441588	I will say that just before Silent Hill HD Collections came out, I actually went through and replayed when to go play through all of Silent Hill 1 through 4.
6442148	6445729	The ambience of 4, and especially the ending, terrified me.
6446430	6449591	I could not get more than 15 to 20 minutes into Silent Hill 4.
6451151	6454993	The quietness, the... You didn't even start Silent Hill 4.
6455093	6456614	It was the opening video.
6457174	6458754	I took steps through the room.
6458854	6463196	I got to the point where the room started to transition, which was... Okay, maybe it wasn't 20 minutes.
6463236	6465057	Maybe I'm giving myself a little bit too much credit there.
6465777	6467118	I started the game.
6467278	6468278	I looked outside.
6468358	6472440	I saw the other apartment complex and the couple of people you could see moving.
6472500	6476562	But as soon as the wall started changing, that plus the intro video... Oh, man.
6476702	6477442	Can you imagine...
6477942	6492151	I can't wait for, like, in the future when we have, you know, these reaction videos, but instead of the reaction videos of people, like, watching the screen, it's like a VR heads-up display or something like that where you're just completely immersed and you turn around, HOLY SHIT!
6492291	6496154	You know, it's like... Immersion is gonna be the best thing and the worst thing for me.
6496214	6496714	The holodeck?
6497622	6499843	For the record, you know the only thing that creeps me out in Silent Hill?
6500423	6500803	The rabbit.
6501244	6502564	We need to get the video capture.
6502904	6506766	For me, it's that hospital room where you go in the room and then all of a sudden it's the giant head.
6507566	6513469	I can tell how scared you are right now.
6514089	6539465	well I really think what we should do we need to make it a priority to get the video capture set up in this place so that for Halloween or somewhere around there we can do a scary game marathon and make me play these scary games and I will cry I will throw things like nothing will match that experience where I was playing Silent Hill Homecoming and like just like the ceiling falls down in this one random part and then I was playing in the
6542447	6546792	and I swear to God, I jumped in my bed and went under the covers and started crying.
6547913	6548834	I couldn't handle it.
6549155	6549876	It was too much.
6552238	6556303	And Homecoming wasn't even that great, all things considered, so it was alright.
6557464	6560125	Anyhow, yes, I have some news for you guys as well.
6560725	6561845	Unfortunately, some sad news.
6561885	6565986	I have to start off with some sad news here during my part of Rapid Fire News.
6566306	6570027	Paul Steed, he worked on bringing Wing Commander to 3D.
6570107	6572787	He also was part of the original Xbox launch.
6573267	6574768	Unfortunately, he passed away.
6575128	6579049	We don't have a cause of death or what have you, but he was a very important part of 90s gaming.
6579389	6581869	He worked on some big, big PC titles in the 90s.
6581969	6585010	Wing Commander, Wings of Glory, Bioforge.
6585350	6591517	He also did some stuff with Quake at ID Software and he also made the crack whore player model.
6591577	6592398	Yes, that was a thing.
6592859	6598966	So unfortunately he did pass away this week according to the Jace Hall show, which there is a YouTube clip of him there.
6599307	6601389	He leaves behind a wife and child.
6602250	6602991	Sorry to hear that.
6604446	6611129	Moving on to news about the Wii U. Wii games apparently going to be playable on the Wii U gamepad.
6611449	6612410	That's very interesting.
6612690	6617972	We kind of expect that Nintendo platforms at this point are going to be backwards compatible with the prior platform.
6618033	6620554	It's been a very common thing in the handheld part.
6620914	6624356	And then, of course, we've seen how the Wii will play GameCube games.
6624636	6627097	Well, the Wii U will play the Wii games as well.
6627417	6633560	And what's interesting is that you can actually play them on the little gamepad because those gamepads have the little sensor bar in them.
6633980	6637762	So, yep, you can point with the touchscreen and so forth using a Wii remote.
6638202	6647287	However, I want to point out, this is still apparently a rumor because this came from a Spanish brand manager and not an official Nintendo source.
6647967	6649188	It kind of makes sense, though.
6649208	6651569	It would be a great reason to sell a mini-mote.
6652069	6652790	A mini-mote!
6653130	6654170	A little keychain-mote!
6654210	6655411	How big is the screen?
6655471	6657872	Like, not even four inches or so?
6658453	6659773	Well, it's not the size, Jason.
6659813	6660594	It's how you use it.
6663199	6669802	I can't imagine playing a game with that small of a pointing radius.
6669882	6671263	I understand.
6671343	6680148	Even when they were showing the Wii Fit U stuff, it was just like, okay, that's fucking ridiculous.
6680569	6686512	You're going to have this little thing set up while your wife's watching TV and you're going to be exercising to this tiny little screen.
6687113	6687833	Come on.
6687873	6689034	That's a little dumb.
6689614	6692056	But there's other Wii games that would work.
6692136	6696059	You know what it would... New Super Galaxy, New Super Mario Bros.
6696279	6697500	Virtual console games.
6697660	6698941	Galaxy would be equally as bad.
6699021	6701382	New Super Mario Bros., I was actually just thinking about that.
6701422	6703304	That's kind of worse for one reason.
6703664	6705825	Certain power-ups.
6706025	6714832	You're holding this, what I'm expecting to be rather hefty tablet, less because it's not the whole guts, but you're holding this tablet in your hands.
6715152	6716553	Oh, I need to throw a fireball.
6716613	6718214	Let me shake this ridiculous...
6718254	6719955	That little tablet thing had a built-in projector?
6719995	6720915	That would be fucking cool!
6720935	6726218	Wasn't that the early rumors about the revolution was that it's gonna project 3D out its anus onto your...
6740584	6743005	No, that was the whole... Remember that shit?
6743045	6747087	No, remember that was... The console was the heads... Like a VR headset.
6747207	6748408	That's what the thing was.
6748608	6752970	No, I remember the whole... It's gonna... The Wii is like fucking holograms and shit.
6753010	6757413	Like, I remember... Those were early... Well, that was back when it was the revolution and they said, Oh, it's the Wii!
6757433	6760014	And you're like, Nope, that's not gonna be revolutionary at all.
6762195	6762495	Anyhow.
6762575	6765597	We took this really kick-ass name and we cut its balls off.
6767122	6771865	Speaking of Nintendo news, there are some more details for Animal Crossing 3DS.
6773306	6776048	I don't know how I feel about it.
6776548	6778749	Animal Crossing was awesome the first time.
6779149	6783172	It was one of the best games ever on the GameCube back when it had the NES games unlocked.
6783212	6785253	But now, I don't know.
6785393	6788035	I'm feeling a little burned out on this series.
6788155	6791377	But I'll give it one more go with the 3DS version.
6791457	6792798	It was educational for me.
6793499	6796603	Oh, with the whole, you're talking about the animal forest with the Japanese letters.
6796623	6798326	Yeah, because I was using it to practice reading.
6799407	6805936	Anyhow, here are some things to look forward to in the brand new Animal Crossing Jump Out, which by the way is the title.
6806436	6807057	Oh my god.
6807778	6811243	Well, because it's 3D, so the pictures, they just jump out!
6813649	6813989	Yeah.
6815049	6818411	Loki, these are the things you have to look forward to because I know you're a big fan of Animal Crossing.
6818631	6820831	Oh, I can't wait to pick it up for my three... Oh, wait.
6820931	6821472	No, I can't.
6821572	6821972	Here we go.
6822512	6825753	An all-new gardening store where you can purchase plants.
6825993	6826793	Fantastic.
6826833	6833916	You know, instead of having them at Nook's where they've always been, let's separate it into yet another fucking store I gotta hike to that has different hours in Nook's.
6834096	6836757	Raccoon housing, which will be run by Tom Nook.
6837837	6842119	A wider variety of fish and fossils, which you can donate to your museum.
6842399	6843099	Oh, fantastic.
6843619	6847543	An exhibition room and shop in the museum, which will be open 24 hours.
6848043	6850205	I don't know of any museums that are open 24 hours.
6850966	6853969	Actually, a lot of national parks and stuff.
6853989	6855530	I'm thinking Washington, D.C.
6855610	6859053	A lot of people don't know this, but the Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument, they're all 24 hours.
6859414	6860195	Those are all outdoors.
6860335	6862357	I mean, a museum that you... Okay, sorry.
6863377	6864058	Rapid fire.
6864198	6865099	I guess... Whatever.
6865359	6868022	When it's run by an owl, it can stay open all night.
6869583	6892823	He's a night owl Touche A miscellaneous goods store That's what it's called The Able Sisters Clothes Shop Oh wow, that's a new feature Roofs, doors, posts, and fences can be customized I'm gonna have a pink fence I can't wait till I have a lesbian again I can't wait either
6893533	6897695	Brand new furniture, including mermaid items.
6899616	6900776	Under the sea.
6901597	6902937	We need that little singing crab.
6903918	6906739	A player will be the mayor of his or her town.
6907299	6908380	So now you're in control.
6908560	6910761	So you're not just an almost homeless scumbag.
6910841	6911381	He died.
6913482	6914503	Well, he was pretty fucking old.
6915083	6916904	Can you evict citizens as the mayor?
6916944	6917904	That would be awesome.
6918104	6919345	I totally would evict.
6919505	6921506	I would have an all lesbian community.
6923698	6926520	A thrift shop will be available.
6927420	6928001	It makes sense.
6928061	6930242	Goodwills are popping up on every corner in this day and age.
6930282	6930622	A thrift shop.
6930662	6935525	So it's basically as opposed to like the recycle bin that you get free shit out of.
6935545	6936505	Now you gotta go buy it.
6937926	6938186	All right.
6938346	6940508	A shopping mall will be available.
6941828	6944330	And lastly, a shoe store.
6945919	6947101	Oh my god, shit.
6947241	6951986	All they're doing is fucking separating everything out even more than it was before.
6952427	6954009	These aren't new features, folks.
6954049	6959616	These are just the same goddamn features just spread out even more between each store.
6959636	6962539	Instead of Nooks carrying pretty much everything, it's just like...
6963360	6968123	Nooks is carrying, I don't even know if there is a Nooks in this game, but it's like a store carrying this type of item.
6968164	6969605	This store is carrying this type of item.
6969625	6970985	This store is carrying this type of item.
6971326	6975889	This guy says, you know, it's all fucking filler is all what it is.
6976249	6978631	Where's my store that sells classic NES games?
6978911	6981393	Not fucking there, so that's why I'm not buying your damn game.
6982867	6984728	Oh, I'm sorry, that'd be the eShop, I guess.
6984748	6986668	Yeah, that would be the Nintendo store.
6986728	6991390	Wouldn't that be hilarious if there was a link within Animal Crossing to the eShop?
6992011	6996152	There's how you can integrate some stuff, and that would be true innovation.
6996212	6997773	Like, the NES carts are back.
6997953	7000134	Oh, but you have to buy them as DLC now.
7000454	7001074	Ba-dum-bum.
7002114	7007997	People do that, and, you know, I can see people doing that, but it'd be cool to have, like, demo versions.
7008037	7008977	Fuck that, and you know what?
7009137	7011358	It's just still stupid because they don't have the classic games in there.
7012096	7012876	Sleep all night and I wake all day
7041289	7047534	Anyhow, DarkSakura, let's move on with some rapid fire news Well, how about something for a game that's been out for two years?
7048315	7063628	Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is getting a new DLC Yes, on August 19th And it's going to be on the two year anniversary of the Xbox Live release That's a long time to go by
7064148	7071033	It's gonna be a $5 pack, 400 points, and it has a new character, Wallace Wells, so you can be fantastic!
7072335	7077198	And he doesn't actually need weapons, so I think he's just gonna, you know, text people to death.
7079900	7081682	And it will be on PSN, by the way.
7082162	7088047	This occasion calls for some animanaguchi, animanaguchi, I can never say their name, animanaguchi.
7095832	7098393	Yeah, the first level, Another Winter.
7098593	7102555	The theme was great, but Another Winter, the very first level stage, theme, excellent.
7103676	7105737	Actually, you know what one of my other songs on repeat is?
7106637	7107097	Threshold.
7111919	7112860	I love the picture.
7117031	7117952	We've seen them live.
7118552	7120394	It was fantastic.
7120634	7124677	In other news, Jet Set Radio will be back for $9.
7125257	7138448	It's going to be a PS3 and the PS3 version will be available for PlayStation Plus users on September 11th and on September 18th the version will be out for everyone else.
7139228	7160314	Xbox Live Arcade and Steam versions will be out on September 19th also for $10 Vita version will be out October 16th it doesn't really say anything else about that so I'll just hook up my Dreamcast thank you and play the good version that has Bjork in it and birthday cake shut up and eat me
7163610	7168576	And then, They Bleed Pixels, which is the best name of the game ever.
7169016	7173582	It's going to be out for Steam instead of Xbox Live Indie Games.
7174342	7179949	So that was the official word by Spooky Squid Games, which is also a cool name.
7181270	7208568	uh basically their creative director said that uh they want to reach a larger audience and PC and Steam is just the place to do that so go check it out it's supposed to be really freaking hard and it says the more and better you kill the faster you fill your checkpoint meter I like killing in games all right is that it that would be it sir that's it for rapid fire news let's get into the foogle question of the week
7215583	7220529	Every week on our Facebook and Google Plus communities, we like to ask a question and get your feedback.
7220869	7223493	And you put Facebook and Google together, you get Foogle.
7224674	7226156	And it's just fun to say, Foogle.
7226656	7227317	Foogle, Foogle.
7227938	7233204	All right, our question this week is... Where the hell is it?
7235843	7238246	I forgot how to navigate Google+, I'm sorry.
7238907	7241410	Oh, nobody left a comment on Google+, tonight.
7241730	7244133	There is officially nobody left on Google+.
7244153	7246356	A little tumbleweed rolls by.
7246796	7253024	Alright, well here, I'll just assume people that use Google+, also watch the Olympics on a six-hour tape delay, so...
7254125	7255166	Here's the question anyway.
7255226	7266238	Tonight we have a story on a game from the Super Nintendo days where it was discovered this week that an unofficial, never-released version of it contained some pretty salty language, which obviously was the NBA Jam game we were talking about earlier.
7266789	7269533	This had us thinking about shocking moments in video games.
7270073	7275620	Have you ever been shocked by dialogue in a game or something that just happened in the plot?
7275901	7281128	I wasn't necessarily going for like F word shocking, just like, were you ever like, oh my God, oh my God.
7281849	7284772	What about something that just made you say, oh no, they just did not.
7286249	7288972	What was a video game moment that had you shocked?
7289212	7290493	You spoony bard!
7291374	7292875	Was that really a shocking moment for you?
7293015	7295758	Considering I didn't play that game until it was released on the PlayStation.
7295898	7298501	That was more of a WT, I was like, what's a spoony bard?
7299602	7301443	I just thought it appropriate after I read the question.
7301544	7306348	Alright, we have some great answers tonight on the Facebooks, so I'm gonna go through and read some of the answers here.
7307069	7310072	Picaruno says, you have to be pretty fucking filthy to shock me.
7312074	7321077	Although I think brutal legend handled the swearing gore in a funny way, stopping the action just before an F-bomb or beheading to politely ask if you would like to enable the fucks and guts.
7321757	7322737	Was that really what it was called?
7322797	7323577	Fucks and guts?
7324818	7327378	Ragenator says, I'd have to go with an unconventional choice.
7327718	7331239	The Super Nintendo port of Mortal Kombat ported by Acclaim.
7331639	7335160	Not for what was included in the game, but for what was not included in the game.
7335520	7337241	Meaning that the game was sanitized.
7337561	7344643	This port has become the poster child of why games shouldn't be censored and has given Nintendo a proverbial black eye for a good many years.
7344963	7350004	That was an interesting interpretation of the question because he took it to mean I was so shocked in a bad way.
7350184	7352244	Like I was shocked at how shitty this turned out.
7352324	7354025	That's kind of an interesting way to go with the question.
7354045	7356125	They're punching the sweat off my face.
7356365	7358506	That sweat is so shocking.
7360443	7361323	Let's see, moving on.
7361764	7371607	Stan says, I just watched a battle scene from Persona 3 for the first time ever and my jaw seriously dropped when I saw that they had summoned their personas by shooting themselves in the head.
7372207	7375509	I'm sure that that reason was explained in game, but WTF?
7376929	7378329	Ratchet Tag says Silent Hill 2.
7379010	7385872	I was playing through for the first time and there was a scene in which you're walking down a hall and see Pyramid Head doing really unspeakable things to mannequins.
7386352	7388833	I was a bit young, so it was pretty shocking and disturbing.
7389153	7391153	If you have played this, you know what I'm talking about.
7391173	7392774	And he included a video with his answer.
7392794	7394755	And I think we all know that scene in Silent Hill 2.
7395315	7402457	And of course, the preview kicks in and tells you exactly what the video is in advance, which is both a helpful and hurtful thing.
7402757	7406201	Now, Shane replied and also said something from Silent Hill 2.
7406261	7410685	I'll just put a spoiler warning out there, even though this game's, what, like almost 10 years old at this point?
7411426	7414769	It's when you find out that James smothered Mary with a pillow.
7415150	7416811	That was ridiculous the first time you found out.
7416831	7418193	Oh my god, spoiler.
7418313	7419634	It's a 10-year-old game, people.
7419654	7420095	I know, I'm just...
7420595	7422356	Especially because they showed him doing it.
7422717	7426880	Runner up would be when Kaiden got his head bashed in on Mars in Mass Effect 3.
7427320	7433825	I literally got up from my computer right after that happened and walked around to try and lose some of my anger I was filled with.
7434525	7438788	This brings us to a very interesting question, a Shane question that I would have to ask him someday.
7438828	7440590	And that would be, what if...
7442547	7446549	Let's say that Bioware never plans to make another Mass Effect game.
7447489	7453251	But they'll make a Mass Effect 4 only if Kaden dies in the first five minutes.
7453771	7454292	For good.
7454872	7457213	Or Ashley, depending on how you've played the games.
7457893	7458793	Then what do you do?
7459253	7459814	What do you do?
7460374	7463375	Do you take another Mass Effect game because, hey, more Mass Effect?
7463655	7465136	And have your favorite character die?
7465496	7467277	Or do you say, you know what?
7467497	7470438	I choose to remember these games as they were with my character not dead.
7471318	7473200	Ooh, that's quite the dilemma, isn't it?
7474041	7475302	What would you do, DarkSakura?
7475342	7479946	Let's say Mass Effect 4 with Garrus dead in the first five minutes or no more Mass Effect ever?
7480226	7480746	What would you do?
7481327	7481827	What would you do?
7481887	7482788	No more Mass Effect ever.
7483649	7484169	Interesting.
7484409	7484750	All right.
7485150	7489994	Well, I don't know because if they said it in like another universe totally, then that's fine or in the future.
7490475	7491476	It depends on the situation.
7492717	7493037	All right.
7494055	7494556	Let's see.
7495256	7502601	Osfer says, SoulCalibur V, after Maxi beats Astaroth, he stares at the camera angrily and shouts, Goddamn freak.
7503732	7504432	That's just rude.
7506073	7508153	Irene replied and said, there's some obvious ones.
7508273	7512875	Chrono dying, Aeris dying, Samus being a girl, Justin Bailey, the upside down castle.
7513335	7514395	That was like seven answers.
7514755	7521578	But one that kind of threw me off was the revelation about the main antagonist, Lady Mamiya at the end of Sweet Home.
7521938	7524559	No spoilers in case someone actually want to play through it.
7524659	7527359	It just seemed intense for an NES game.
7528160	7529960	By the way, I just got a text message.
7531021	7532021	No more Mass Effect.
7533410	7534051	Thank you, Shane.
7535052	7537394	At least we know he's listening now, even though he missed the first half.
7537995	7540558	Shane, yes, no more Mass Effect.
7541038	7545383	Except I would cry if there was no... Now, if there was no Caden, sorry, I wouldn't care.
7545964	7550248	Monty Boggs in our chatroom says, Ashley just tried to kill me, so whatever, let her die.
7552130	7553452	Well, you can, like, Garrus shoot her.
7554540	7554840	All right.
7555761	7558163	Mandrew replies and said, you don't know Jack.
7558643	7565969	A buddy of mine and I were playing, and we had to type an answer for a question, and he typed in, fuck you.
7566530	7572114	Jack responded with, fuck me, no, fuck you, and deducted like 10,000 points or something.
7572494	7575137	When you're inner sixth grade, that throws off your guard.
7575217	7576277	That's awesome.
7576458	7578699	I never knew that could happen, but that's hilarious.
7580120	7584823	Uh, Extifer replied and said, when Hellscream called Sylvanas a bitch in Warcraft.
7585184	7588546	I'm sure there's several I'm not thinking of, but it all comes back to WoW, right?
7588846	7591047	How about the, uh, dead babies in WoW?
7591087	7593209	You know what I'm talking about?
7593329	7594169	I think so, yeah.
7594209	7597811	Where the troll lady is and she has all the babies and then you have all the skeletons behind it.
7597831	7598512	That's just creeper.
7598772	7603655	And, and, and the leather tents that the gnolls have that are made out of, uh, people's faces.
7604956	7605136	Hmm.
7606275	7611837	How many games have we talked about tonight that are upwards of five years old and have danced around spoilers and now we're talking about Gears of War 3?
7629758	7631960	I think it's nice that people are trying to be respectful.
7632020	7634741	I'm not going to criticize people for being respectful of the spoilers.
7635622	7640565	DarkCharger replies and says, I'll have to go with Eternal Darkness.
7641586	7644888	That's a game they need to bring back on the Wii U, don't they?
7646638	7661465	that's a game that would the problem with bringing a game like that is now it has a standard for what's going to be scary and you can't do the same thing you can't do the same things all over again unless it's like literally a graphically improved port
7662385	7683267	but people would this game isn't scary oh you can't redo a game like that it's not going to happen well until there's a dramatic shift in technology like immersion we were talking about before until you can really have something different to to throw at the player again it's not going to be interesting but but imagine oh wait let me get right on the mic here
7683837	7698708	but imagine the things that they did with Fatal Frame 4 and the remake of Fatal Frame 2 add that to the whole sanity thing and all the things that they could do to fuck with you with Eternal Darkness yeah but the haunted house in Fatal Frame 2 for people like us is stupid and boring
7699008	7702570	Yeah, but I'm sure that they could do some... And that's what I'm talking about.
7702670	7708293	The bonuses and the extras and the things that they would be throwing in nowadays are dumb and boring.
7708453	7717497	And Eternal Darkness, as kinda cheesy as the game was, the effects were really good and it made for a good way to keep you through the game.
7717757	7719698	Alright, let me finish the comment here from DarkCharger.
7720318	7727880	If you went in there spoiler free, random noises, skewed perspectives, and even a blue screen of death made you question your own sanity as you played through.
7728941	7735022	Chiggers replied and said, the first time I ever heard shit in a game was when Barret said it in Final Fantasy 7.
7735242	7736283	I was awestruck.
7737563	7741184	Actually, sit your ass down in that chair and drink your goddamn tea.
7744456	7753065	And lastly, Tigerclaw says, to me, the most shocking moment in a video game was in Bionic Commando when you see Master D, aka Hitler's head, explode.
7754706	7755567	That's pretty awesome.
7755867	7757749	I read all the answers because they were all really good.
7757769	7760772	Thank you guys at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
7761412	7762353	It's all about Sid.
7762493	7763294	What about you guys?
7763795	7765897	Shocking moments in video games.
7766685	7791059	I'm gonna go with a really cliche one that was already mentioned but it really was the most shocking moment for me was when Aeris died in Final Fantasy 7 like for real I cheered for real I was like that just fucking happened like really like they're gonna just off a character video game characters don't die they just regenerate I cheered I know there's not really much that shocks me in a game I mean maybe Selly's throwing herself off a cliff
7792537	7794378	I was like, she just threw herself off a cliff?
7795579	7796160	Stupid bitch.
7797320	7802144	Other than that, I was like, I haven't really had a shocking moment.
7805091	7807692	Oh, I know one thing that actually did kind of gross me out.
7808312	7812434	Well, okay, first of all, Robbie the Rabbit always kind of creeps me out.
7812934	7814415	The big head in Silent Hill 4.
7815095	7820477	And I knew the big head was there, but even seeing the big head was like, ugh, stop looking at me, ugh.
7820878	7822939	Because I have a thing about big heads, and I don't like them.
7823379	7832342	Like, we had... Like, the clown face in Funhaus, the pinball table, that thing creeps me out.
7832382	7833323	That thing is kind of creepy.
7833803	7837570	I mean, it doesn't matter that the goal is to hit it with a pinball.
7838271	7838912	It's still creepy.
7839473	7840114	And that's in pinball.
7841289	7842910	I'm gonna say a really recent one.
7843190	7847932	The most shocking moment for me, a recent game that I actually played again this week for the first time in a while.
7848672	7849992	Journey on the PlayStation 3.
7850613	7854454	Because I had no idea going into it that it was an online game.
7854594	7857375	And the moment I saw another person there was kind of shocking.
7857435	7858676	Like, what?
7859296	7864658	And the fact that they weren't acting like staying in one place and saying, go up here, go over here.
7864698	7865218	They couldn't.
7866639	7869000	Journey is such a fucking...
7869760	7870441	Great game.
7870701	7876067	I played through again this week, and it's just, oh my god.
7876647	7881653	The way I'm talking to people, I was showing the game to Extifer, and I was like, yeah, and that's another person.
7881693	7889921	And then the person was trying to do the little singing to tell me that there was a thing I was missing in the little place where they were standing.
7889961	7890522	It's just, I don't...
7891042	7891963	I don't know how to explain it.
7892023	7892985	It's such an experience.
7893185	7894186	I still need to play that game.
7894266	7894927	You really do.
7895067	7896869	Journey is an outstanding game.
7897670	7899172	It damn well may be my game of the year.
7899192	7899833	I'm not sure yet.
7901315	7902416	Do you have any shocking moments?
7902436	7903017	Yes, Loki.
7903237	7903978	Shocking moments?
7904098	7905060	I don't, actually.
7905440	7907743	I was trying to think of something, but no.
7909408	7911310	I have two interpretations of them.
7911390	7912571	One of them Ryan reminded me of.
7912671	7917295	The one that I have in mind, literally shocking in terms of gasp, shock, and alarm.
7917675	7923760	Fatal Frame 1 and 2 to an added effect really did have a pretty profound impact on me.
7923780	7926823	I've always been weird when it comes to ghosts and that kind of stuff.
7926963	7931147	The lore and the situation, the sound, the ambience, that kind of stuff.
7931187	7933489	Those games really creep me out for a very long time.
7933529	7937172	I could talk about this for hours, but this is a three, oh wait, four hour show.
7938733	7942896	The example that Ryan reminded me of that's actually really true, Braid.
7943396	7944978	Braid was an amazing game.
7945058	7947559	Great puzzle game, great platformer, great everything.
7947599	7948620	I absolutely loved it.
7948660	7957226	It's one of the few titles that I've actually 100% achieved and in general just sat down and worked my way through with very little to distract me in between.
7958828	7983728	but the story of it is also ridiculously profound and the very last level of Braid after you do all you get all of the puzzle pieces you put them all together and you do the final like unraveling in technically world one how do I how do I do this spoiler free it's just the best representation of two sides of the story that I've ever seen in gaming and really in media in general
7984318	7995608	We have Actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Says, Braid sucks, I hate the game Haters to the left Alright, Rye, we'll end this with you Any shocking moments?
7996429	8003335	Of course, since I asked her back channel if she had any suggestions I just took away her suggestion, but that's okay I was the one playing it anyways
8007881	8012125	I mean, I was happy that the fact that Diablo 3, nothing got spoiled for me.
8012505	8016729	So, things happening in that one, I was pretty surprised with.
8016889	8017490	Anti-shock.
8018290	8020392	Yeah.
8020512	8027459	The Diablo... Whimsichire, the Diablo piñata, that's the word I'm looking for.
8027479	8027739	Okay.
8029318	8030779	Thank you for watching!
8058920	8073367	Alright, so there's already been hints that this was coming, but Valve has finally made it known that they're going to be rolling out other non-game software on Steam coming September 5th.
8074188	8083152	And these will include other... include, I guess, Steamworks functionality, allowing automatic updating and cloud storage, as well as other Steam features.
8083452	8084893	And they have everything from, like...
8085533	8093017	Audio Production, Note Counting, Animation, Design, Illustration, Photo Editing, Software Training, Web Publishing, etc.
8093698	8094778	So, lots of stuff.
8095539	8096079	Interesting.
8096119	8102783	And then, of course, I guess titles will continue to hit Steam after the initial September 5th launch.
8103263	8111748	And I guess developers will be able to submit their prospective pieces of software via the Steam Greenlight program.
8112648	8114229	Did Steam just reinvent Kickstarter?
8117726	8118106	Maybe.
8120348	8130818	It's to their credit, it's not, hey, I want the game, so I'll fund you this $5, but it's more crowdsourcing the idea in the first place.
8131778	8135542	It has its own potential, but I'm sure in time we'll see its own demise, its own drawbacks.
8141542	8168293	this kind of brings more light to a comment that was made a couple weeks ago when we talked about there was something where and it always seemed like a weird comparison but Gabe Newell from Valve said something about yeah we were talking to Adobe and trying to convince them that Photoshop should be free and I think a lot of us were like alright whatever they were talking and now we're like oh that's why you would have had Valve talking to Adobe because they're trying to get some of that software on this new thing
8168593	8174556	They're trying to have the killer title so that the additional content of the store is actually relevant to people.
8175437	8176057	It's interesting.
8176657	8177858	Do you think this could be successful?
8178058	8178618	Yeah, definitely.
8179939	8180359	I do too.
8181900	8184421	They should make the entire suite free and give it to me.
8186042	8187242	Looking forward to that Steam holiday sale.
8187282	8190404	Wait a minute, didn't you say you didn't want Photoshop to be free?
8190464	8191805	I assume you remember on that episode.
8191965	8192865	I just want it free for me.
8193606	8193806	Oh, okay.
8193826	8194066	Okay.
8195666	8197007	Not free for all.
8197107	8198788	For my elite group of designers.
8198868	8200208	That clears everything up.
8200288	8200709	Thank you.
8201849	8203110	And InDesign.
8203330	8205691	Well, this won't be free.
8205751	8208893	In fact, it'll be $109 if you miss the Kickstarter.
8209313	8210313	The, oh yeah!
8210773	8211574	Excuse me, the ooh yeah.
8212374	8216397	Oh yeah, the Oh Yeah got funded and all that good stuff.
8216457	8217557	Boy, did they get funded.
8219238	8220679	$8.5 million.
8220739	8225002	It was supposed to raise $950,000, which was a pretty lofty goal to begin with.
8225562	8231785	Met $1 million in eight hours, $8.5 million after all was said and done when the Kickstarter closed.
8232426	8238129	According to CEO Julie Ehrman of the Oh Yeah, we've been blown away the whole time.
8238769	8239390	So there you go.
8240710	8248174	Also in news there, it's $109, like I said before, so it's a little bit more expensive than the $99 during the Kickstarter.
8248555	8253177	It's $119 if you live in another place, not the U.S., somewhere foreign.
8254097	8255478	You get the little console.
8255638	8256799	You can pre-order it now.
8257619	8260621	They're saying now delivery expected to commence in April of 2013.
8261081	8263582	Is that because they're going to do the Kickstarter people in March?
8263782	8264002	Yes.
8264022	8264523	Interesting.
8264543	8264923	Interesting.
8266735	8267536	Namco Bandai Namco Classics
8288115	8288955	Like Pac-Man.
8289015	8291256	I think they were talking about Soul Calibur, actually.
8291477	8291757	What?
8291957	8298860	The Android, like how they have the slightly toned down versions for Android and stuff.
8298980	8299700	Okay, that makes sense.
8299720	8301361	So it'd be like that, but with a controller.
8302502	8303142	Very interesting.
8305123	8309165	And hopefully, Ridge Racer.
8309185	8309845	Ridge Racer.
8311860	8317725	Although I hope it's not Ridge Racer like it was on the Vita because that Ridge Racer sucked balls.
8317885	8318465	Ridge Racer.
8318666	8323169	That would be great if that could be a launch title.
8324450	8326032	It does launch with every system.
8326112	8328854	By the way, I love this comment from Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room.
8329194	8330675	Namco Bandai in discussions.
8330916	8331976	Indie game heaven.
8332977	8335559	Remember how this console was going to be the indie console?
8336640	8338742	It's going to be as good for indie games as the Xbox is.
8340948	8341669	Alright, moving on.
8341709	8342329	DarkSakura.
8344851	8350596	Well, Star Trek Infinite Space, I'm sure people saw all the ads all over Facebook for the beta and everything.
8351197	8351577	Guess what?
8351737	8352138	Canceled.
8353079	8353719	Not gonna happen.
8354960	8365850	It was supposed to be set during Deep Space Nine and they even got a bunch of the cast from Deep Space Nine to lend their talents and nope, they couldn't get any funding.
8365930	8367811	They couldn't find a publisher so it's not happening.
8369153	8370635	Sad face.
8372678	8374821	The demise of MMOs has begun.
8375281	8376563	No publisher for an MMO?
8376623	8377264	How does that happen?
8377304	8380088	The fact that all Star Trek is right now is the Abrams movies.
8380148	8381831	I really wish there'd be a new series.
8382271	8382612	Cry.
8383213	8384575	As long as it's nothing like Enterprise.
8386429	8390891	They have a Kickstarter right now that actually has Michael Dorn in it.
8391691	8392111	Oh, really?
8392571	8393411	Yeah.
8393571	8395532	Everybody's got a freaking Kickstarter.
8395732	8399994	It's a Star Trek documentary with Star Trek actors.
8401154	8401614	Yay.
8401694	8402034	Okay.
8403175	8404935	Because there haven't already been at least two.
8406276	8408497	Is Kickstarter rule 35 now?
8408877	8411137	If it exists, there's a Kickstarter for it?
8411377	8412618	Possibly, actually.
8413318	8415759	That's just what I got from a couple of instances in this episode.
8417108	8419931	All right, a few more news stories for you guys, and then we're going to get to the mailbag.
8420231	8425736	And before too long, the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8425756	8432262	But first... Boy, Rhode Island really put their money in the wrong company.
8432843	8438088	So 38 Studios, of course, they kind of tumbled and failed and...
8439929	8464644	so now Rhode Island owns the rest of 38 studios including the assets, the rights to the single player game that they put out and of course their unfinished MMO project and now they're trying to sell off these assets to recoup as much of the loan as possible and so maybe that means that we'll see a new Kingdoms of Amalur game or whatever it's going to be called
8466015	8470959	because somebody will have to buy the rights inevitably but it's going to go at bargain basement prices which is kind of too bad.
8478823	8481424	GameStop came out this week and said that 70% of trade credit is spent on new games.
8481444	8481864	Wait a second!
8506553	8510097	That's totally hurting the games industry with all those used game sales.
8510198	8513562	Well, I mean, to me, this is kind of a duh.
8513902	8524976	This comes from GameStop president Paul Raines talked to Gamasutra and basically said this in an interview that was about the total sales numbers and the $11 billion and so forth.
8525536	8529941	and basically was talking about, you know, everybody always criticizes about used trade-ins and so forth.
8530321	8533605	But he said, quote, we're really not cannibalizing new game sales.
8533625	8534866	That's a common misconception.
8535266	8539010	So my answer to developers is that we are driving growth in a category that needs to grow.
8539331	8543355	We think there's a real lack of awareness as far as how trade-ins are good for the industry.
8543795	8544655	Thanks for watching!
8566380	8567481	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
8589198	8593661	for whatever campaign or DRM that you're putting in place there.
8593941	8596642	And B, they're not going to have the money to do it anymore.
8597283	8601985	But my whole thing is, I just prefer to cut out the middleman and sell him on eBay.
8602225	8602686	Exactly.
8602766	8605427	And use that money to buy whatever I want.
8605507	8606728	A new video game or...
8607288	8608969	Maybe my shiny new iPad.
8609349	8609889	I understand.
8610009	8612850	And sometimes it's a matter of convenience.
8612970	8616372	Sometimes you don't want to wait for that or you don't want to go through the hassle to do that.
8617172	8618632	And it's just opportunity cost.
8618852	8623114	You can either get X amount of money now or you don't.
8623254	8630297	And that's the thing about GameStop is when you go in there, at least that should be the way, you go in there, you say, okay, here's the games I have.
8630497	8631617	What will you give me for them?
8631797	8634839	If that's not satisfactory to you, sell them on eBay.
8634899	8635119	I mean...
8636019	8641804	You can figure... You can call them up or, you know... I don't know if you can call them up, but you can go down there and say, here's what I have.
8641904	8644667	If that's not enough money for you, then you go try to sell money.
8644687	8646328	Doesn't the website tell you trade-in values?
8646908	8648370	Eh, some games they do.
8648530	8654855	I don't think they do for all of them, but... And I'm sure it'll vary based on the, you know, the condition your games are in, but... I mean...
8656136	8658739	It's not like they're forcing you to trade this stuff in.
8659759	8660820	Sorry, you already gave it to us.
8660860	8662241	You can't have your games back.
8662262	8663082	They're not going to do that.
8663463	8665104	You just go ask them, hey, here's what you'll give me.
8665244	8672730	Or even on top of that, you can take them to another game store, not GameStop, that also does trades and ask them, hey, what will you give me for this?
8673251	8674412	Shop around.
8674532	8676694	Figure out who's going to give you the best value.
8677054	8677855	Best Buy still takes it in trade-ins.
8677875	8680056	The one that's close by us, they actually have a whole little station.
8680076	8682518	They actually have a counter set up and somebody dedicated at that counter.
8706244	8732658	I was not aware I don't usually look into that here so and also too with you know GameStop now what they're trying to do to get more people to trade and stuff is they don't just sell games anywhere they sell like electronics phones but the nice thing about Amazon is I could trade in the games to Amazon and then put that money towards a vibrating heating pad as we learned about earlier in the show there you go or alien space still though if they have that you know you never know
8734346	8736066	gonna trade in new Super Mario Bros.
8736146	8758472	Wii get some hot durian cock alright don't make me make the noise Rob alright let's I will make you make the noise of opening the mail there you go no more noise how's that I'll just piss off your neighbors and be really loud let's go to the mail bag
8761960	8770026	Every week, DarkSakura opens the mailbag at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and reads some of her favorite emails for you right now.
8771086	8771286	Sure.
8772487	8775369	Okay.
8775409	8776390	This one's actually a contest.
8779122	8788606	Hey, OLR Crew, I apologize for intruding in your mailbag segment, but I would like to give away a PlayStation Network game code to one of your live listeners in the U.S., Canada, or Puerto Rico.
8808015	8811636	The code is for Dazaimon Kids.
8812337	8818779	An import PS1 classic side-scrolling shooter that lets players design their own levels.
8819039	8822200	Just to keep this contest simple, I would like for the lovely DarkSakura.
8824321	8833444	or equivalent sassy male host to say the code at the end of this email and leave it to the first listener who can claim the code to win.
8834504	8839126	Desaimon Kids can be played on a PS3, PSP or in the near future, Vita.
8839726	8848269	The code can be redeemed from the PlayStation Store app on a console or at account.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com Good luck to everyone.
8848589	8849929	This comes from the Nasty Canasta.
8850789	8851650	I love that name.
8852150	8852670	So are you ready?
8854315	8856657	Get your pencils, get your keyboards ready, get a free game.
8856697	8856997	Here you go.
8857017	8859298	Picture pages, picture pages, time to get you.
8860239	8861220	Nobody gets picture pages?
8861360	8861740	Wow.
8863001	8863341	Bite me.
8864462	8873207	T-H-P-N-P-L-N-P-T-M-N-3.
8873728	8876069	There you go.
8876109	8876690	Not saying it again.
8877270	8878251	I want to know who wins it.
8879872	8880172	All right.
8880692	8881133	Okay.
8881833	8882253	Next email.
8882414	8882534	Yeah.
8884401	8889765	Um, this... I had to laugh, I had to laugh.
8889785	8893969	There's a Kickstarter to do Cheetahmen 2, so that they're fixing it to make it playable.
8895210	8896571	It says, Konami, be ashamed.
8897872	8899773	Oh, I'm not even gonna bother.
8903316	8906279	Okay, the subject of this one is Trainor.
8907714	8909515	Dear DarkSakura, which would offend you more?
8909996	8935272	Me saying Samantha Trainor is a hotter piece of ass than Garrus Vakarian or there's a link says this being the song Windows Down by Big Time Rush this song that samples Song 2 by Blur and if by sampling we mean rips off completely and ruins ugh and that's Stay Black Redertainment um well given that I can't actually listen to it because I have the sound off um
8938411	8942513	Well, if Damon Auburn sued the crap out of Big Time Rush, then that's okay.
8943354	8945235	Samantha Trainor is just annoying.
8946916	8948537	And everyone's entitled to their own opinion.
8948637	8950858	I would say she's a hot piece of ass for what it's worth.
8951118	8955861	The shower scene, like I'm gay and I still kind of get a semi on that shower scene.
8955881	8956522	It's really hot.
8957082	8959123	She wasn't even naked.
8959903	8960224	What's up?
8960504	8961805	Who showers in their bra?
8964726	8965347	Mother fuck.
8969240	8974229	Cock teases Yeah, but Shepard wasn't even naked or in her undies
8984156	8988380	It's called... They didn't want the game to have an AO rating, so she had a bra on.
8988600	8989280	I think it should.
8989300	8990681	It's like Showgirls on VH1.
8990741	8994585	Have you ever watched... I posted something on Tumblr a while back.
8994665	8997707	And if someone can... Ranma, if you can find it on my Tumblr, relink it.
8998267	9002231	It's the romance scenes in Mass Effect 2 done with Flycam.
9002811	9008296	So you can see all the little rendering cheats that they did and how Garrus' hand goes right through the middle of her chest and everything.
9008976	9009537	It's really funny.
9009557	9010077	Okay.
9013876	9020247	Hey OLR, I'm writing you from my phone so please excuse my lack of form slash grammar slash bad spelling lack of bad spelling?
9020267	9021048	Why would I complain?
9021589	9024354	or anything else that relates to improper use of the English language
9025279	9028381	It looks like Ranma says he got it, by the way, that code earlier.
9028701	9031103	And BlackWolf says, well, sorry, podcast listeners.
9031183	9032404	Guess you aren't a part of this.
9033264	9035106	Well, how about this?
9035386	9041510	I have another code, and this is a code for Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet.
9042330	9048074	Oh, I can't do it this way because then somebody who's listening live is going to go to the podcast as soon as it comes out and pull this code out of it.
9048134	9050376	So I have to think of a way to give this code away.
9050416	9054439	I have a code for Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet that was generously donated by Peeker Uno.
9054839	9054999	Huh?
9055419	9055679	Email.
9056680	9056941	Email?
9057281	9058102	Random picked email.
9058242	9058942	Random picked email?
9059483	9059803	All right.
9059983	9060444	Fair enough.
9061264	9061905	Send an email.
9062005	9062786	Send an email.
9062846	9065889	How about if you are the 15th?
9065989	9067290	All right.
9067650	9076298	Send an email to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and tell us how jealous you are that the live listeners get all the good giveaways.
9076678	9081081	Tell us about your insane jealousy and you may win Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet.
9081401	9085323	We will give it to the, what, 15th person to email.
9085343	9086664	Or whoever's the most fucked up.
9087324	9088145	No, because you can't say that.
9088165	9088725	That's too vague.
9088745	9090106	You have to have a definitive answer.
9090126	9090666	The 470th person.
9090686	9090926	No.
9091346	9097090	We will say the 15th email and if for whatever reason 15 people don't email us... We'll randomly draw one.
9097110	9098290	Then we'll randomly draw one.
9098651	9099271	So there you go.
9099691	9103934	Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet on the Xbox 360 just for the podcast listeners.
9105455	9111700	I have two questions for you tonight.
9111800	9114562	First, is there a way to stream the show from an Android device?
9115142	9117264	And if so, how does one go about setting that up?
9117564	9119766	Well, first of all, you sell your phone and get an iPhone.
9119786	9119906	Stop.
9120607	9121087	Stop.
9121247	9121567	Stop.
9121967	9125350	The stream to show via an Android device, you go to vognetwork.com.
9125470	9136498	The good news is the website's in HTML5, so you actually should be able to, and this works just for the record on iPhone as well, you should be able to go to the site and just hit play, and it'll work.
9137018	9141401	If for whatever reason that doesn't work, there is an app, and I know it's on iPhone.
9141502	9143523	I'm pretty sure they wrote this for Android as well.
9143583	9146325	It's called TuneIn, and that will allow you to listen live.
9146425	9148867	I actually listened to Under Station Live last night from the gym.
9149577	9152800	Yes, by the way, I joined a gym, which is a whole other story I'll have to get into at some point.
9153061	9155443	But I actually listen to Understation Live on TuneIn.
9155884	9156184	Okay.
9157265	9160849	So, I don't recall ever hearing anything about how one goes to set this up.
9161329	9164012	One email per person, you smart-ass listeners.
9164727	9165608	I will check your IP.
9166469	9169873	I don't recall ever hearing anything about streaming since you switched to VOG.
9170293	9172215	Please provide any... Okay, we already did all that.
9172356	9175859	Okay, second, what do you believe to be the main cause of rhythm gaming collapsing?
9176220	9178122	And we'll be seeing a return to the genre soon.
9178162	9180024	Well, anything that goes down has to come back up.
9181385	9194589	Some people attribute it to Guitar Hero oversaturating the market while others point the finger at Rock Band for their spamming of DLC which separates friends who have more money to spend on games than others who don't necessarily have as much disposable income.
9195469	9204072	I've been playing Guitar Hero since the third one and Rock Band since Rock Band 2 and I've watched the community decline steadily and now it's a very small and tight-knit community.
9204472	9212233	That's all fine and dandy because you get closer with a regular group of friends, but now it's a sad state of affairs because neither Guitar Hero nor Rock Band have any games coming out.
9212413	9214594	I'm not counting Blitz because it's not a main series game.
9216474	9216994	I have an answer.
9217854	9220295	Stubbornness killed the music game franchise.
9220355	9224015	Konami's unwillingness to support the franchise killed it.
9224055	9227916	We went how many years without a DDR game in the arcades?
9228016	9232897	And one might say, oh, well, arcades were dying, or oh, well, it wasn't successful enough so they would have made another one.
9233277	9241901	Bull to the shit, because the problem with that logic is that you're pretending that America didn't import all of those games.
9242381	9245663	Like, did you know you're not supposed to have a Max 2 in America?
9245803	9246883	That was never released.
9247224	9248744	Max, never released.
9248964	9250625	Extreme, never released.
9250985	9252046	That's the problem.
9252526	9256570	Konami of Japan did not believe in the franchise.
9256970	9262235	And when they would make the games here, most of the time they were half-assed when they were coming from Konami of Japan.
9262695	9270202	There were two people slash groups that believed in Dance Dance Revolution and the Mimani series in general at Konami.
9270603	9271964	One of them was Jason Enos.
9272304	9272825	Without him...
9273365	9274186	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9294301	9313319	that's the shit that should have been in the arcades those would have been great American DDR releases and we say this with our own personal bias having been in the scene as long as we have been but isn't DDR pretty wildly popular in the arcades with the ones that actually have X and X2
9314471	9316673	I mean, I'm out of the scene.
9316753	9318274	I have not been playing the game anymore.
9318774	9324299	And if I'm going to pick anything, I'm going to go back to basically Extreme and Below and a couple of gyms from afterwards.
9324839	9326000	But let's not kid ourselves.
9326621	9330664	Isn't DDR still doing pretty damn good now that it actually has an American song list?
9331264	9335087	Well enough, I think, although the home releases seem to have dried up quite a bit.
9349557	9349657	D.D.R.
9366548	9373091	I would definitely tend to agree that DDR introducing me to Dance Mania is probably one of the best things for my last decade of music.
9373271	9375071	Just lastly, real quick, I'm sorry.
9375272	9387877	The last thing I want to say on this is that the other thing that really screwed them, Guitar Hero was only a rampant success because Konami was too stubborn to realize those games would work here and they would have never paid for the licensing.
9388397	9390178	Who made the first Guitar Hero?
9390458	9391138	Harmonix.
9391518	9393679	But who did they team up with to get that done?
9393979	9395840	Who planted the seed?
9396180	9397140	Great, Red Octane.
9398381	9399561	What started Red Octane?
9400322	9401862	What kind of company was Red Octane?
9401882	9402663	DDR pads.
9402803	9404763	And Guitar Freaks, third-party Guitar Freaks controllers.
9404783	9408125	And these mysterious third-party Guitar Freaks controllers with five buttons.
9408145	9410966	Yeah, the saga of Red Octane for us is pretty sad.
9411046	9415708	My Guitar Freaks controllers were in the background when we did the thing at my house with the news.
9415968	9418809	And what happened when Rock Revolution came out?
9419149	9422631	It was dismissed as a shitty-ass guitar hero clone and why?
9422991	9428033	The song list sucked butthole because it was a bunch of bad covers.
9428613	9434195	And that was a very clear indication that Konami of Japan was not willing to put the investment or the risk.
9434995	9437176	And in order to get rewards, you have to take a risk.
9437456	9439977	Konami of Japan was not willing to do that.
9440097	9442318	Therefore, Bomani died.
9442478	9444279	To finish reading the email, if...
9446618	9446938	Go ahead.
9447058	9452300	Yeah, this will spiral out of control because I have a few agreements and disagreements, but absolutely.
9454240	9463143	Those of us who are still playing regularly new instruments because all of ours keep breaking over time due to wear, we're unable to find them anywhere short of eBay for less than $100 for a damn guitar.
9463683	9463983	Dimple.
9465244	9469645	It's a used movie and game and records and stuff.
9470185	9474927	I find guitars are all the time on the cheap and usually in great condition, and all of mine are still in perfect shape because...
9475367	9477692	You have to clean them out and take good care of them.
9477792	9478814	But other than that, you know.
9479836	9480818	This is thanks for answering.
9480878	9481639	Sorry for ranting.
9482120	9483042	SonicM88.
9483122	9483423	P.S.
9483463	9484926	I wish I could listen live at work tonight.
9485988	9486329	Brownie.
9487070	9487391	That's it.
9488025	9517585	The only thing I wanted to interject is that, as far as I know, Rock Revolution was a mostly Japanese-developed license acquisition, was responsible by the Japanese Konami outfit, and the music culture in Japan is ridiculously different from America, and so for them to take that something original, put it on us, put it on the common American base, and be surprised at the failure,
9519267	9531541	to me from the limited amount of knowledge that I have it already makes sense that I could just say well you're not making an American game you're making a Japanese game and pushing it in America in something as cultural as music that's a pretty big deal
9533002	9537323	Alright, anyway, we could spend more time talking about this, but we did already spend five years talking about it.
9537763	9539143	So, was that it for emails?
9539563	9545105	Alright, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us an email in the future.
9545605	9554847	I guess what's funny, I guess, because the live listeners are complaining that the stream went down, which is weird because I don't see the timeout that usually comes up when that happens, but I guess maybe a little hiccup.
9556287	9561368	I guess what happened, I said, Bomani died, and as soon as I said died is when the stream went down.
9562348	9567753	It's almost like the watchful eye of Konami Japan just fucking pulled the plug on my internet when I said that.
9568454	9568994	How dare you?
9569014	9571136	But we know it's just because Comcast sucks.
9571356	9571636	Alright.
9572317	9578022	After the mailbag comes the FUs of the week, so let us get a little bit ranty.
9592850	9597952	We usually start the FUs with DarkSakura, but she ran out of the studio for a minute, so I'll start with the other lady.
9598172	9599613	We'll let the other ladies first tonight.
9599933	9601153	Bri, do you have an FU of the week tonight?
9602694	9604815	I don't think I do right now.
9606035	9607216	FU for being too nice.
9609397	9610377	I might think of something.
9610956	9612197	All right, then how about Jason?
9613097	9613597	The other half.
9613998	9620641	F you to forgetting a coat and anything else at home, because it was ridiculously cold in the bay last night.
9620801	9621842	It sucked to walk.
9622142	9622883	Fuck the bay.
9623203	9627325	It's like 105 degrees here, and you're like, I need a jacket.
9629106	9633288	And I think I had something else, but eh.
9633348	9633648	Loki.
9634829	9636170	F you to being burnt out at work.
9637920	9642881	My FU of the week goes to my abs and Extifer for showing me that little ab machine.
9643341	9657405	Extifer convinced me to join a gym because I actually... There's a lot to be inspired about with Extifer because Extifer used to be a big boy and he lost a lot of weight through a pretty intense program at the gym over the course of like a year.
9657885	9658345	So I just...
9658985	9662487	I don't know, I'm kind of at the point where I'm like, you know, I would like to lose a few pounds too.
9663387	9669551	So I joined a gym and he showed me how to use the little ab machine and it really hurt the next day.
9669591	9671912	These things are evil, aren't they?
9674193	9675274	Also, F you to that.
9676234	9680577	It's not a Stairmaster, but it's like this escalator that never ends type of thing.
9681377	9682678	That thing's a little fucker.
9684779	9685900	What gym are you going to?
9685920	9686821	24 Hour.
9686921	9688263	Oh, I'm so sorry.
9689864	9693688	I had a better experience there than at the one you were recommending previously, but that's alright.
9693829	9694089	Okay.
9695210	9696391	Different strokes for different folks.
9696491	9696691	Alright.
9696792	9698433	Well, um, my F you?
9698754	9698994	Uh-huh.
9699154	9701877	First of all, these chips are fucking delicious, but peppery.
9703879	9704239	And, um...
9705240	9709521	The car accident, my lower back for hurting like a bitch after my adjustment.
9711241	9713002	And the rental car that I have.
9714022	9723964	I like that the stereo has the Bluetooth hookup for the phone, but I miss my car and I don't like being blown around like a leaf in the wind on the freeway because it's so lightweight.
9725424	9728345	I would rather have had a Corolla S than a baseline Corolla.
9728425	9729945	I feel like I'm driving a mommy car.
9731508	9732249	Oh yeah, one more.
9733271	9739222	F you to BurgerTime for reminding me of how bad I suck at classic arcade games and viewing angles.
9740939	9743781	Alright, Tigerclaw in our chatroom asks a very good question.
9743801	9745542	This is a very good question about the whole gym thing.
9745882	9749664	Tigerclaw says, Rob, when you went to the gym, when you went into the gym wasn't intimidating.
9750125	9760311	And I have to admit that's part of what held me back for the longest time is that I just the whole like doing that in public type of thing and like people looking at each other in the gym.
9760911	9765854	I was a little weirded out by that whole thing at first which is why for the longest time like I wouldn't go, right?
9766795	9769857	But finally it just kind of hit me like this whole thing like
9770837	9773778	What am I going to see any of these assholes outside the gym?
9773919	9775799	I'm not going to see these people anywhere else.
9776200	9776760	Whatever.
9776880	9779581	I'm just going to go and be in my own little world and listen to my headphones.
9779601	9782603	And if these people want to stare, then let them stare because I'm hot.
9783803	9785664	And that's pretty much where I ended up with.
9785984	9790006	Also, it really helped that when I went to the gym for the first time, I definitely saw people uglier than me.
9790346	9793828	And that helped a lot, actually, in a very superficial kind of way.
9794328	9794548	Right?
9794968	9795669	Am I right, Jamie?
9795869	9798370	It's a relief to go in the gym and see people uglier than you, right?
9799361	9799841	Sometimes.
9800642	9807828	But the gym that I go to actually has a lot of track and ROTC people there.
9808328	9811791	But they're doing the harder intensity stuff, and I'm like, I'm just going to walk over here.
9811911	9812231	Thank you.
9812992	9814093	I do the rowing machine now, though.
9814994	9821899	Tigerclaw says, or nervous, because you walk in there and you see a bunch of muscle-bound dudes working out, and they see a weakling walk into the gym.
9822200	9825122	Hey, why did you just call me?
9828582	9829162	No, I don't.
9829783	9835328	But if the muscle-bound dudes are looking at me and they're judging me, then they're checking me out.
9835448	9836549	And that's their issue.
9837050	9837930	Sorry, I'm hot.
9838291	9839612	Well, you know what I would do?
9840753	9842635	Dan has a big thing for the circuit training.
9843135	9845878	They have this big circle thing where they do circuit training.
9846258	9847920	I'd go hang out in the dude section and lift weights.
9849221	9854425	because I have a weak ankle and I can't really do much of that.
9854705	9857487	So I just go lift weights with the dudes and I get weird looks, but I don't care.
9857907	9858327	Fuck them.
9859428	9862790	There just comes a point in your life where you just... I'm really not interested in them, thank you.
9862890	9868975	There just comes a point in your life where you have to say, hi, haters, you know, and just deal with it.
9869075	9869675	Deal with me.
9870696	9870996	All right.
9871797	9875019	Monty Boggs says, people in gym, a new challenger approaches.
9875359	9876660	I'll let you guys know how it goes
9898069	9899849	Dear chatroom, keep reminding Rob.
9900029	9900369	Thank you.
9900610	9902330	I already got a text message from Christopher today.
9902730	9903510	So, did you go?
9904690	9906611	And I'm like, yes, I went on Saturday night.
9906651	9907291	Thank you very much.
9908151	9908951	I'm a real winner.
9909171	9910852	I go to the gym on Saturday night.
9910932	9912032	I didn't go to the club or the bar.
9912052	9912872	I went to the gym.
9912992	9914592	And then pizza on Sunday.
9914652	9916893	And then I ate so much pizza on Sunday.
9918533	9919933	But see, here's the thing, Jason.
9919953	9921514	I would have eaten that pizza anyway.
9922194	9922534	So...
9926003	9929427	There's usually a good diet to go along with these kind of things, but eh.
9930548	9935332	DarkTetsuya says, instead of listening to USL, no, I just said the tune-in app.
9935372	9947804	I listened to the first hour of USL from the gym, and I know that DarkSakura talked about the Rocky rehearsal, and I know that Travis talked at length about the Mars landing and how happy he was about that whole thing and how he made the graphics during OLR.
9948204	9948364	Ha!
9949305	9949606	Alright.
9951387	9951828	Anyhow.
9952028	9953389	Somebody needs to take these chips away from me.
9953409	9954110	They're freaking good.
9954771	9955051	Okay.
9956232	9956412	Yes.
9959488	9963272	Someone in chat was asking your chips what brand and such they were.
9963473	9968258	I told them, but it's Trader Joe's rice and bean chips with adzuki beans, and they're very peppery.
9969539	9970080	All right, let's do it.
9970160	9972623	It's already past 9 o'clock, and we haven't even gotten to calls.
9972803	9975907	So let's do these last few stories pretty quickly here.
9976007	9979230	And I've got to do Twitter topics as well here.
9979711	9980332	So, Loki.
9980872	9982133	So more Zynga news.
9982333	9986795	Of course, they're worried that people are going to start flocking away from the company.
9987295	9990176	So what are they doing to try to retain some of those employees?
9990316	9991797	They're giving them free stock.
9992837	9994378	Free, worthless stock.
9997950	9998910	Fantastic.
9999251	10001572	There were some of those stories out there on one of those websites.
10001612	10009015	I can't remember the name, but some of the stories from actual employees and just about how the stock that they were given to work those long hours has just plummeted.
10009535	10015378	It's actually kind of sad because as much as I can't stand Zynga and the games they put out,
10016098	10021363	That's not a problem I have with the line-level employees, so to speak.
10021644	10025668	The people that are actually doing the art or the programming or all that.
10026068	10029091	It's the way that company is managed and the way they make some decisions.
10029431	10032875	I bet there's some very talented people at Zynga that would like to do something original, but they can't.
10032895	10034557	I know there's some talented people there.
10034577	10035578	Some of my friends work there.
10036338	10045281	They're very talented individuals and artists, but I can't see their talent being utilized at all at this company, which is why I kind of feel bad.
10045821	10054564	Everyone talks about how evil they are, which is an evil company, but it's not like those artists are evil or the programmers are evil.
10054624	10056605	It's just that the decisions are evil.
10057785	10058586	So there you go.
10059526	10059826	All right.
10060106	10060987	Is that it for that story?
10061547	10062267	Wow, that was quick.
10063148	10064749	I said quick, and you said you did it.
10065049	10065289	All right.
10065349	10066670	Then lastly, I'll do this one real quick.
10066710	10067490	This is an eBay.
10067570	10068371	This was brought up earlier.
10068671	10071052	An eBay auction that has a lot of people turning their heads.
10071512	10076655	And this is a guy who's basically selling his whole damn life on eBay for $3.5 million.
10077175	10084699	A 29-year-old who owns – which, first off, props to him for establishing $3.5 million worth of stuff at age 29.
10084779	10085079	That's –
10086580	10089601	I'm older than 29 and I'm not even worth a tenth of that.
10091482	10095923	I think I saw on a website the other day, orangeloungeradio.com is valued at about $1,500.
10096043	10096223	Yes!
10096243	10097163	This guy made $3.5 million.
10097203	10098083	I could ask $1,000. $1,000.
10109503	10137730	and I'd have to split that three ways really four because it's Jason's site and Dekeman designed it five anyhow all kidding aside this guy is selling on eBay 3.5 million dollars his entire basically assets all his homes his automobiles the collectibles and so forth he's the owner of RU Game which is an independent retailer it's in Gainesville Tampa and Brandon Florida and
10137830	10138990	We have a couple listeners in Florida.
10139010	10140171	I don't know if there's any in that area.
10140571	10141831	But he owns these few stores.
10143011	10145872	And I love the little derpy Mario that's in the videos.
10146072	10148673	There's like this guy in a derp derp Mario costume.
10149193	10149513	Whatever.
10149573	10152754	Anyway, he says he'll even hang around for six months to help the new owner.
10153134	10154834	He didn't really say why he's doing it.
10154874	10157415	It might have been in the video, but I wasn't going to watch the whole thing.
10157435	10161256	It's because he wants to just start his next thing or whatever that is.
10161376	10163196	So it's like, I want to start my life over.
10163396	10164376	We are starting over.
10164436	10165156	Maybe he's Buddhist.
10165937	10166297	Maybe.
10166497	10166837	Who knows?
10167797	10170358	But anyway, he's selling the whole thing off.
10170618	10173300	No words yet if there are any serious bidders or whatever.
10173340	10173980	But you know what?
10174120	10175701	I say hats off to this guy.
10176421	10179022	Because a lot of people think it's fake and it's just for publicity.
10179062	10182024	And in which case I say, hats off to you, dude.
10182044	10186105	Because you got covered on every game blog this week with this little story.
10186706	10188347	And you know this industry.
10188427	10190988	They need to run something every day on the websites.
10191448	10194829	So this was like the best commercial you could ever not buy.
10196676	10197857	I tip my hat to you.
10199618	10203700	Doesn't RU Games sound like it might be a place to buy Russian import games, though?
10203880	10206481	When I first saw the name, I kind of thought, oh, RU Games.
10206521	10207522	It's like a Russian game store.
10207562	10211184	I thought that that's... I think of a stupid Facebook game.
10211404	10214186	I work in an industry that works with these types of stores.
10214686	10218568	You would not believe how many generic-sounding game stores there are out there.
10218948	10222170	It's like, yeah, I'd like to make my game store.
10222210	10222770	It's called...
10225952	10227173	I'm trying to remember what it was like.
10227533	10230975	It's something like GameStop, but it wasn't GameStop.
10231075	10232096	It was very close.
10232136	10232876	GameYield.
10233917	10234537	GameGo.
10234657	10235217	Go game.
10235637	10240540	No, it was like Go GameStop or something like that.
10240620	10241100	Oh, wow.
10241160	10241521	What?
10242161	10243121	Why are you naming things?
10243201	10244182	Wait, Go GameStop.
10244202	10250565	That's kind of... Or like, you know, video game center, game store, the game place.
10250706	10252827	I named the game store the Danone.
10252847	10253327	Did you know that?
10254116	10254456	Oh, really?
10254876	10255356	Game on.
10257137	10258658	That ended up being a show, right?
10259438	10260438	Well, this was years ago.
10261499	10262279	Game Shop.
10262619	10263219	I've seen that.
10263599	10267821	There's Game Trader that uses the same text and colors.
10268101	10273003	Monty Boggs in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com answered the question, Yes, I am game.
10273223	10273803	Are you movie?
10277483	10280065	I'm sorry, I found that response to be hilarious.
10281247	10282808	Like, I just want to walk into the store.
10282848	10284129	Why, yes I am, game.
10284169	10284730	Are you a movie?
10284770	10285571	Well, here's the thing, too.
10285611	10292457	He's even admitted, even if it doesn't sell, or he doesn't get a buyer for it, it's great advertising for my store.
10293158	10296220	Because he got all these blogs talking about this store.
10297341	10301445	Props to you and your derpy-ass Mario mascot guy.
10306348	10308612	You know, Nintendo might see that and get a little upset.
10310094	10310574	Just saying.
10310875	10311656	What are they going to do?
10311676	10312377	Take down the articles?
10312397	10315802	I want to see derpy Mario fight Mario mascot.
10317565	10318967	Maybe in the next Smash Brothers.
10320236	10345016	Dr. Mario vs. Derpy Mario Ermagerd Ermagerd Mushrooms Ermagerd Mr. Mario Ermagerd Mushrooms If that doesn't just epitomize this episode Ermagerd Zelda Sheik Sigh

10368025	10371607	Gamer Girl was responding a little late to the Facebook question on Twitter.
10371987	10373107	I think she's being ironic.
10373988	10380110	First game that ever shocked me was God of War when you go into the ship's cabin and you get to do the girls for more orbs.
10380850	10381330	Oh, yes.
10382611	10383231	Yeah.

10384891	10385272	Yeah.
10385712	10386152	Shocking.
10386172	10387252	That just happened.
10387292	10388073	But in a good way.
10388173	10388813	Yeah.
10389253	10391074	Ooh, I can't believe that just happened.

10407058	10409439	Oh, I have a funny, interesting little story.
10409659	10410299	I'm chilling.
10410339	10411519	I'm watching My Little Pony.
10411659	10412419	Just kicking back.
10413120	10413600	That's what's up.
10413620	10414220	That's how I roll.

10417778	10421843	I have a funny little story to have a nice, interesting story about Microsoft and I'll be on my merry little way.
10422284	10422524	Okay.
10423485	10430133	First story is, oddly enough, if it wasn't for Raijan, I wouldn't be a fan of the show and I wouldn't be pestering you guys for all these years.
10431261	10434603	Oh, so you are a fan of OLR, thanks to Raichan.
10435124	10441589	Yes, because me and Raichan, we go back like 10 plus years, hanging out on a forum site called WBS.net.
10441649	10442590	Can you hold on a minute?
10442610	10442970	Yeah, yeah.
10442990	10443291	God damn you!
10443311	10444311	You ruined everything!
10460470	10461673	Oh shit, was I not on mute?
10465752	10468353	Hey Rob, can you scream a little louder?
10468373	10471053	I don't think the dead heard you You know what's funny?
10471153	10487317	Apparently right when I screamed, the internet went out again Which isn't, you're still on Skype, so I don't think that's possible, whatever Alright, so anyway, that'll be one for the pod And the podcast listeners supposedly don't get any love Anyway, sorry, where were we?
10487337	10491278	I'll just explain how I became a fan of the show Yes, please
10492455	10495878	I mean, I'm just chatting online one day, and she just IMs me on ICQ.
10495938	10497759	She's like, are you into, like, be mining DDR?
10497799	10498760	I was like, yeah.
10499220	10502723	And she's like, check this out.
10502743	10504124	What was your number on ICQ?
10504144	10508067	You just aged everything 10 years when you brought up ICQ.
10508227	10509408	Well, we're already on a 10-year delay.
10509428	10510709	I still have my ICQ number.
10510969	10512430	I'm still logged onto it right now.
10512490	10513050	My number is 10719559.
10513090	10513531	Uh-oh.
10521688	10523589	That was my old boss's message tone.
10524070	10524790	Uh-oh.
10524810	10526051	It was everybody's on ICQ.
10526731	10527592	No, I mean on her phone.
10528732	10528832	Ew.
10531274	10534255	Okay, so she messaged you on ICQ and your computer went, uh-oh.
10535196	10536036	Yeah, pretty much.
10536056	10541519	And then everybody in OLR went, uh-oh.
10541539	10541959	Was that right?
10542660	10545561	And then everybody in OLR went, uh-oh.
10545982	10546262	Uh-oh.
10550759	10551700	Oh, that was great.
10551820	10553120	Oh, wait, here we go, here we go, here we go.
10553521	10553981	This is great.
10560044	10561965	Oh, that's the sound I make every time.
10562365	10564366	Oh, look, the phone's lighting up and it's Ranma.
10566287	10571249	I wonder if there's somebody out there that has their ringtone or text message for their phone.
10571389	10572390	Actually, that's sound effect.
10572430	10576532	How about the ICQ sound remix that apparently exists out there?
10576552	10579413	Oh, God.
10580589	10583772	OT Payne Is this dubstep?
10584912	10586774	Not yet, not enough screeching.
10587755	10588335	Okay, anyway.
10589896	10591778	Hi Ranma, what's new?
10592839	10593199	I'm sorry?
10593752	10595773	That's a notorious S-K-I-E, huh?
10597654	10600536	Black Wolf says the ICQ song needs to go into rotation.
10602137	10603718	Take a vote on it right now.
10603878	10607721	Looks like Dark Tetsuya voted for it too, so I think that passes.
10607761	10609522	We're going to get that in the VOG stream.
10609582	10611983	ICQ remix, coming soon.
10612404	10615005	Ranma, anything else you wanted to share with us?
10616226	10619468	I think I overran my time, so I'm going to get up and out of here.
10620168	10620929	Love you, mean it.
10621980	10649434	sure you do, you've made it for every bullet so far man, love you too uh oh I'm out bye it is strange how well some people's voices lend them to recreate sounds like that people, I don't know if I've ever really been pitchy on the show I don't know if I've ever really been pitchy on the show I know I've laughed pretty high pitched a couple times tonight but I would never have expected you to be able to recreate that tone, ever
10650967	10651087	Oh god.
10651127	10651207	Dude.
10682247	10683548	Hi-ho, Kermit the E-Frog here.
10685569	10687390	Do I really want to go into an inside joke like that?
10687410	10687670	Probably not.
10687690	10690112	No, you don't want to go into an inside joke like that.
10690232	10695155	It's not on air.
10697036	10699797	Live radio.
10699977	10702979	It's moments like these where I can only think of this.
10703840	10704520	Inside joke.
10713707	10718570	Call Hold on, we got a call coming in?
10718630	10728236	Here we go, here we go Oh hi, who's this?
10731237	10731597	Hello?
10731617	10733098	Hello?
10733418	10738281	No, that's terrible Who is this?
10739502	10741643	It's Shane Hey Shane, what's up?
10743271	10743771	Nothing.
10743931	10748692	I just realized that I can't really plug Horde House this week because I won't be on it.
10749472	10752493	So did you call into my other radio show just to tell me that?
10753693	10753953	Yes.
10754253	10757394	I already figured that out actually earlier when I was doing the math.
10757414	10759595	Well, I didn't.
10759895	10762135	So I thought you should be the first to know.
10762215	10764156	Well, thank you for that important announcement.
10764256	10764976	Hey, guess what, y'all?
10765016	10766916	Shane will not be on Horde House this week.
10767016	10770177	In other news, this is the week to listen to Horde House.
10771591	10774193	Is that all you called in to talk about?
10774493	10774614	What?
10774634	10775815	Is that all you called in to talk about?
10797389	10804655	It's pretty, and the combat's fun, and it's also free to play once you buy it, and the combat's fun Did you say it's free to play once you buy it?
10819485	10820765	Yeah, like there's no monthly fee.
10820805	10821505	No subscription.
10821565	10822406	Yeah, I got that.
10822746	10826326	So it's similarly different to World of Warcraft.
10826346	10827406	You stole my word.
10831007	10833388	You're full of hate tonight.
10833488	10834588	It's a good problem.
10835348	10836048	Ah, that's great.
10838629	10840049	I learned from you, Shane.
10840109	10840969	I learned from you.
10841049	10844150	And since you're not going to be on Horde House this week, I had to make up for it.
10845090	10845710	Clearly.
10848203	10849444	When am I not full of hate?
10849504	10849784	All right.
10849804	10851946	I don't know.
10851966	10853407	You're extra hateful tonight.
10854267	10858030	So are you allowed to talk about where you're at right now or should I not talk about that on air?
10858531	10860092	Why is it confidential?
10861013	10861533	I don't know.
10864215	10864875	I don't know either.
10864895	10865636	I'm asking you.
10865676	10866817	Why is it confidential?
10866937	10869719	Because of the nature of your work now?
10869819	10870260	I don't know.
10871481	10871841	No.
10872141	10875944	I'm up in Redmond, Washington training at Nintendo there.
10876505	10877065	Woo!
10877325	10877945	Are you having fun?
10879305	10884886	The Pacific Northwest is really beautiful.
10884946	10887247	I haven't been to Redmond specifically, but I love Seattle.
10887427	10888067	Seattle's great.
10888427	10891928	Should go back for PAX.
10893088	10894128	Is that really next week?
10895008	10895108	No.
10895608	10897289	PAX is over Labor Day weekend again.
10897489	10898589	It's the same time as DragonCon.
10898649	10900169	That's like three weeks.
10906858	10907939	Oh, I don't know.
10907999	10908519	I can't go.
10909639	10910440	That's too much money.
10910580	10911580	But I would love to now.
10911640	10913541	I always want to go to PAX if it's up here.
10913701	10915622	August 31 through September 2nd.
10915682	10916943	That's what, three weeks away?
10917003	10918063	That's the same time as DragonCon.
10918083	10919804	Yeah, usually they overlap.
10921004	10924546	Well, Redmond is like a little village inside a forest.
10924626	10925286	It's beautiful.
10925987	10927647	A little village inside a forest.
10927888	10929048	How far are you from Seattle?
10930309	10931089	Like 30 minutes?
10931589	10932890	Oh, that's further than I would have thought.
10932910	10933090	Yeah.
10934036	10940541	Well, that's how long the cab ride took, the $81 cab ride.
10940961	10942362	I didn't pay for it, so I don't care.
10942683	10943763	It was in a hundred and ten.
10943783	10945064	That's fine, I will do that.
10957705	10958906	How is Reggie exciting?
10959367	10960168	I don't even remember that.
10975123	10980347	So, okay, if I meet Mario tomorrow, like actual Mario, not Charles Martinette, I'll let you know.
10980467	10981347	Or Derpy Mario.
10981367	10982528	I don't know if you've been listening to the show.
10982548	10983129	Derpy Mario doesn't count.
10983529	10986371	But the Derpy Mario from Florida might show up.
10986651	10986991	I don't know.
10988212	10988532	You know what?
10988572	10991334	In fact, I think you need to report Derpy Mario, actually.
10991595	10993296	I'm going to help you out.
10993556	10996618	You need to put that in a feedback box somewhere.
10996638	11001982	If there's a suggestion box on the wall, please arrest Derpy Mario in Tampa, Florida.
11003274	11008039	Well, I would need some sort of like proof of derpy Mario.
11008059	11011142	The picture is on Kotaku.
11011182	11013344	Alright, I'll email you the link.
11013444	11015346	Alright, I gotta let you go to get some more calls.
11015386	11015846	Anything else?
11018209	11021151	No, my whole studio...
11022156	11027041	Hotel Room is powered by a key card that I have to plug into the wall and if I take it away it turns everything off.
11027121	11027642	It's weird.
11028182	11029824	Those hotels are actually really nice.
11030605	11031846	Yeah, it's $300 a night, apparently.
11034502	11044612	Wow, it's like, I don't know, it's like guy from middle of nowhere Kansas ends up in the big city or the village in the forest where you have to plug things into walls in order to get power.
11045233	11045673	It's weird.
11045913	11046674	You have to make power.
11046694	11050818	They're using like a freaking water thing.
11050838	11051459	What are those called?
11051479	11052580	Those water wheel things?
11054302	11055363	Hydroelectric power?
11056627	11057808	Sure, there we go.
11059369	11060810	Alright, I will talk to you later, Shane.
11060850	11061210	Take care.
11061230	11062391	Goodbye.
11062431	11062751	Bye.
11063372	11066874	Alright, let's try to fit in at least one more call for the night before we say goodnight.
11067154	11068495	Hi, on Orange Silence Radio, who's this?
11069316	11070377	Hey guys, it's Porkchop.
11070537	11071998	Hey, Porkchop, how you doing?
11072924	11073404	Not bad.
11074245	11080908	All you guys who are all knowing, I heard you talk about the Move, and I'm just wondering, I'm thinking of buying it, but what exactly can I do with it?
11080928	11086690	I mean, I have a couple of games I can use it with, but is there anything else that I could really do with it that's worthwhile?
11087050	11094794	I'm sorry, but all I have to say is, and I know this is a radio show, but your Skype picture is cracking me the hell up.
11095734	11096535	I am glad.
11096615	11099356	I didn't think you could see it before, but I'm glad you can see it now.
11100623	11110612	Yes, yeah, we can all see it here in studio and it's cracking me up because to describe it for listeners at home, he's literally wearing a tinfoil hat that makes him look like... It's a tinfoil helmet.
11110652	11111933	It's a tinfoil helmet.
11112033	11116517	He looks like a superhero or something, but he looks like... Sir Tin, a foil.
11117037	11121241	Yes, it's a very phallic foily head that he's got there.
11122722	11123603	Sir Reynolds of rap.
11123803	11125024	It's like a metallic luchador.
11125624	11126564	Yes, a metallic.
11126944	11127385	Thank you.
11127685	11129145	He's a metallic luchador.
11129766	11132867	But the expression on his face is like, hey.
11134348	11135628	He's like the happy luchador.
11135748	11136989	Hey.
11137209	11138390	I'm a body slam you now.
11139490	11139790	Anyhow.
11140731	11142532	Episode 469, people.
11144393	11144774	Thank you.
11145254	11151578	You should get the PlayStation Move and play it in that helmet and upload those videos to SingStar.
11151958	11154460	You would be the number one ranked player in the world within weeks.
11154680	11156361	I would do that just for you.
11156381	11159263	Seeing as you ask so nicely, I would do that if I can get SingStar.
11159283	11159883	No problem.
11161129	11162610	And please make sure it's SingStarAba.
11162970	11165352	All right, Loki, you have some suggestions.
11165652	11166793	What could he do with the move?
11167433	11176179	Well, there's, I mean, all their first-person shooter games support the move, and they have also their gun thing, I don't remember what it's called, but they've got that as well.
11177400	11179301	Sports Champions is pretty fun with the move.
11180442	11184605	Also, apparently, Child of Eden's really good with the move.
11185886	11189348	They've got some move-exclusive games, but they're kind of just so-so.
11189908	11190268	I don't know.
11191049	11191101	Thanks for watching!
11193287	11193948	Let me put it this way.
11193988	11197410	A lot of that move stuff is probably really discounted right now.
11197510	11206196	So you can probably take a pretty good look through a dump bin somewhere or a discount bin at any one of these stores and find a bunch of that move stuff.
11207136	11209698	But yeah, I'd say probably Sports Champions is really good.
11209858	11212960	Although, if you want to wait, Sports Champions 2 is coming out.
11213581	11216463	I don't know if it has some of the... I think it has some of the same events in there.
11216863	11217964	But I mean, it's got frisbee golf.
11218124	11218724	That's kind of fun.
11218904	11219665	I played the archery.
11219745	11220465	Archery is really cool.
11223627	11225608	How is LittleBigPlanet's move implementation?
11225628	11226649	It's supposed to be pretty good.
11227349	11228910	They've got a lot of new stuff with that.
11228950	11230290	LittleBigPlanet 2 would be a good one.
11232711	11236273	If you like heavy rain hazard, I don't know how good that would be.
11236293	11236873	Yeah, I got that.
11238133	11239154	You can use it as a mouse.
11240902	11242103	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
11264978	11268860	You could basically pretend you're playing Wii games that work.
11269900	11270180	Yeah.
11271661	11278443	Well, I got Heavy Rain and I got Resident Evil 5, so I think that should pretty much keep me going until I can pick up some other ones.
11278724	11279484	That sounds pretty good.
11280024	11282945	Sounds like a lot of stuff you're going to find in the clearance bin pretty soon, unfortunately.
11282985	11284886	But hey, however you can find the deal, right?
11285819	11287162	I picked them up cheap anyway.
11287202	11288604	But yeah, Singstar Abba.
11288845	11289506	That's on my list.
11289606	11289887	All right.
11291109	11292372	As it should be on everybody's list.
11292392	11292953	It's fun.
11293333	11293574	All right.
11293955	11296720	Poor Chop, before I let you go so we can close up the show, anything else on your mind tonight?
11297580	11303343	Yes, Konami, if you fuck up Zone of the Ender's HD collection, I will fucking kill you.
11303723	11305204	In that helmet.
11305524	11307385	Yeah, he will wear that helmet.
11307925	11309546	Professor Chaos!
11313007	11313467	That's it.
11313747	11315628	You need a battle axe made out of tinfoil.
11316049	11316929	Oh my god.
11317069	11318550	I just need a special move now.
11318610	11319530	Wait, wait, wait.
11319750	11323392	I have to say it because over here it's aluminum, there is an aluminum...
11325945	11326165	Really?
11327547	11328628	We just say tinfoil.
11330310	11331792	Why make it so damn complicated?
11331812	11332633	We don't give a shit.
11333694	11334736	Cover your food with it.
11334756	11335136	That's it.
11335336	11335837	Tinfoil.
11336297	11336698	Tinfoil.
11336718	11337599	Make hats.
11337679	11338340	Make axes.
11338400	11338780	Whatever.
11339481	11340022	I love it.
11340482	11342345	All right, Porkchop, I've got to let you go to close-up shop.
11342405	11343085	Have a good one, buddy.
11343646	11344607	Stay frosty, guys.
11344848	11345348	Will do.
11345508	11345849	Bye.
11348760	11349520	I love the listeners.
11349640	11351400	Oh wait, no, I'm closing up Sky.
11351440	11355041	I'm sorry if you didn't get through, but it's like 9.30 already.
11355501	11356381	And I want a milkshake.
11356641	11358182	We need to wrap up here and get out of here.
11359402	11359582	What?
11359702	11360122	Milkshake.
11361022	11362202	Does it bring all the boys to the yard?
11362682	11363223	I don't care.
11363263	11364823	It brings fat to my butt.
11368263	11369884	It's the Dark Sakura version.
11369924	11371084	Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.
11371404	11372624	No!
11372904	11373384	No!
11373864	11377505	God, you're awful.
11380200	11380920	No.
11381620	11385021	La, la, la, la, la, la.
11385162	11387802	Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
11387862	11389423	Thank you for YouTube ads.
11390023	11391443	All right, here we go.
11391463	11392464	Here we go.
11392544	11394004	Unmute me.
11394024	11396025	My milkshake brings all my fat to the butt.
11398305	11402327	And I'm like, damn right, it's fat on my butt.
11410609	11435160	They all want me when I walk into the gym like this Damn right I went to Pinkberry And I was like, yo super size You can't have mine And there's your singing for episode 469
11439531	11441012	Is there a meme we haven't covered?
11447314	11447834	Okay.
11450275	11454217	Oh, I think I need to do... I need to do Twitter topics.
11455859	11458101	Are you feeling a little emotional, Rob?
11458521	11460904	I'm so emotional, baby.
11463246	11464907	You had to bring Whitney into this.
11464947	11467049	Can't you let that poor woman rest in peace?
11467349	11467689	Never.
11467870	11468330	Damn.
11469611	11470992	She's still got a movie coming out, all right?
11471032	11472013	All right, look, quickly.
11472033	11473475	She's dead and got a movie coming out.
11474135	11475957	It's amazing what they can do with technology.
11476397	11477999	All right, look, tweets.
11478479	11479900	First off, Tiger Club.
11480000	11481281	They actually tried that with Bruce Lee.
11481962	11482523	And Tupac.
11484850	11486976	Alright, uh, by the- Great.
11487598	11491389	Travis is inviting me on Under Station Live next week and do White Boy Sing Along.
11494488	11494908	Why not?
11495028	11495248	Sure.
11495849	11496169	All right.
11497770	11503252	Tiger Claw tweets us, and you'll be interested in this, a fan-made Mass Effect adventure game.
11503292	11503552	What?
11503712	11504453	That surfaces.
11504733	11505853	Is that the Mass Effect universe?
11506053	11509535	It's called Finding Shepard, and it's on the Adventure Game Studios.
11509955	11512676	It's created by one of the users on the forums, Night Fable.
11512996	11518159	Finding Shepard, it's in progress right now, but it's set in the Mass Effect universe directly following Mass Effect 3.
11519019	11521480	It assumes that you took the Destroy ending.
11521500	11522781	That's all we're going to say about that.
11523301	11527844	What's cool about this game, if you kind of look at some of the early screenshots, it looks like a LucasArts game or something.
11528204	11528844	That's kind of rad.
11528964	11529865	Better have Chick Shep.
11529985	11531486	Do you press S for Shepard?
11532566	11533006	Shepard!
11533667	11534087	Shepard!
11534727	11535368	Shepard!
11535868	11536268	Shepard!
11536628	11539510	You seem to have Mass Effect confused with Heavy Rain.
11541531	11541891	Alright.
11543052	11543452	Let's see.
11545799	11550904	TigerClaw also sends us one more tweet about how GameStop is one of the worst places to work in America.
11551725	11552766	It's just number 10.
11553106	11553567	Duh.
11553987	11554387	Is it really?
11554427	11554868	It's only number 10?
11554928	11555969	Yeah, it's number 10.
11556890	11558251	Actually, I had pulled this up.
11558872	11559893	Number 1 is Dish Network.
11559933	11561034	Number 2 is Dillard's.
11561114	11562615	Number 3 is RadioShack.
11562655	11563736	Number 4 is Perch.
11563756	11564517	Number 5 is OfficeMaxx.
11565658	11585376	Number 6 is Sears slash Kmart Number 7 is Robert Half International, which I have no idea who they are Kmart is tough to work for because you have to work with mummies Number 8 is Hewlett Packard Number 9 is Rite Aid And number 10 is GameStop Followed by Bank of New York Mellon Sears slash Kmart?
11585496	11587597	Was that a tie or are they the same company?
11587698	11592101	They're the same company Kmart and Sears had a merger Sears Holdings Oh, I imagine that
11592902	11620495	some tweets from JV Mon who wants to plug his best friend made some paper craft Legend of Zelda which is available as posters on Etsy I gotta admit some of these are really cute they're kind of the phantom hourglass style that's cute you should plug that in the chat room because that link's a little long for me to read on air but it's on Etsy just search paper craft Zelda I guess and oh he sends a tweet with more pictures that one's really cute I like the Mario one
11621075	11621636	Jack, Miranda, and Drew
11639844	11641064	Last Minute Thoughts Final Thoughts
11668138	11671139	I cry from laughing way too much.
11673020	11674160	Ryan, thank you so much.
11674200	11675881	You made it, finally, to a show.
11676641	11677821	Yay, finally.
11678382	11679162	And I'm with Jason.
11679422	11683503	My head hurts and I've been laughing so hard I was crying earlier.
11683643	11684283	All the feels.
11685144	11686184	Is that your final thought tonight?
11686984	11687665	I think so.
11688225	11691146	Alright, well thank you for being here and please come back again sometime.
11692066	11694027	And I swear I'll get you a better mic next time.
11694487	11695887	Alright, let's see.
11696147	11697488	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.
11697992	11700375	I want a kitten, but Shermie's too fat and would sit on her.
11702799	11703900	Loki, your final thought tonight.
11704060	11704841	I drink too much water.
11706604	11710429	And my final thought tonight is la la la la la.
11711270	11711991	Thank you guys so much.
11712051	11714634	I thought your final thought would have been uh oh.
11714855	11715676	Uh oh.
11717217	11719040	That's what happens when you drink too much water.
11719060	11719640	Uh-oh!
11720001	11723765	See, that sounds like either ICQ or lemmings.
11724626	11726348	That's what happens when I eat at Chipotle.
11726529	11726889	Uh-oh!
11727390	11727690	Alright.
11728531	11728831	Followed by...
11733027	11735889	Oh, I'm so glad we could have a poop joke before the show was over.
11735949	11736970	Thank you, Loki.
11737170	11738210	We've already had dick.
11738911	11740512	I'm sorry, alien dildo.
11741553	11741853	Really?
11742293	11742813	We got dick?
11742893	11743114	Where?
11743574	11743834	All right.
11745095	11745575	That's it.
11745675	11746095	We're done.

11862556	11863357	A quick footnote.
11863377	11865397	We just don't want the party to stop, y'all.
11866277	11870599	We forgot to do this during the live show, so we're going to attach this on here at the very end.
11870839	11876740	We just had so much stuff that was being given away tonight between that code that the emailer had and then the code that you were going to email us for.
11877100	11883262	We forgot to announce who's going to win this and get Bradley's bag of PAX shit that he got.
11883342	11883642	That's right.
11883682	11884823	That's the sound of the bag.
11885283	11889044	So now you're getting a bag of PAX stuff that's been fondled by Jason.
11889904	11892646	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11917624	11918605	But just Murderface.
11920346	11921667	Somebody you could take home to mom.

11923548	11924448	Really weird looking dude.
11924608	11926029	So now we're really ending the party.
11926570	11929892	Thank you for staying all the way to the very, very bitter end, podcasties.
11930212	11932613	Congratulations, William Huggleface.

11934775	11937016	And yeah, that's it.
11937896	11939197	On to your next podcast.
11939497	11939878	Bye.
