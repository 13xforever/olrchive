00:00.000 --> 00:19.320
Tonight, August 5th, 2012, another MMO is set to go free-to-play.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.880
Someone decides to take Zinga to court over an allegedly copied game.

00:22.880 --> 00:29.840
And has the Wii U detailed launch lineup been revealed?

00:29.840 --> 00:35.640
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.640 --> 00:38.200
where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.200 --> 00:46.400
It is Orange Lounge Radio with this episode number 468 for August the 5th of 2012.

00:46.400 --> 00:50.280
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you with my co-host over the next few hours

00:50.280 --> 00:54.120
to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that good stuff.

00:54.120 --> 00:55.120
Here they are.

00:55.120 --> 00:57.840
Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers.

00:57.840 --> 00:58.840
Olga.

00:58.840 --> 00:59.840
How's it going?

00:59.840 --> 01:00.840
I'm kind of in pain.

01:00.840 --> 01:01.840
You're in pain?

01:01.840 --> 01:02.840
You're hurting?

01:02.840 --> 01:03.840
I hurt.

01:03.840 --> 01:05.840
A cafe mocha didn't make it better?

01:05.840 --> 01:07.480
No, my soul is broken.

01:07.480 --> 01:09.840
I'm sorry, why is your soul broken?

01:09.840 --> 01:10.840
I got laid off.

01:10.840 --> 01:11.840
Aww.

01:11.840 --> 01:12.840
Sad face.

01:12.840 --> 01:13.840
Actually, I'm really okay with it.

01:13.840 --> 01:14.840
Yeah?

01:14.840 --> 01:15.840
I mean, I'm kind of okay with it.

01:15.840 --> 01:16.840
I mean, not really.

01:16.840 --> 01:18.840
I mean, I want chocolate and more Pinkberry, please.

01:18.840 --> 01:20.840
It's the economy.

01:20.840 --> 01:25.640
No, it's Bank of America, but I'm not going to say anything else.

01:25.640 --> 01:28.400
But maybe a silver lining to it all, at least I hope.

01:28.400 --> 01:30.080
We're all pulling for you.

01:30.080 --> 01:31.080
Something will come up.

01:31.080 --> 01:32.080
We'll see.

01:32.080 --> 01:34.400
If you listen to Bobby Black Wolf Show, let me just plug real quick.

01:34.400 --> 01:37.440
Maybe I could work for Zynga and get sued.

01:37.440 --> 01:42.940
Listen to us live at the Voice of Geeks Network and participate at live.vognetwork.com, where

01:42.940 --> 01:47.600
we do tape Sunday nights at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby

01:47.600 --> 01:48.600
Black Wolf Show.

01:48.600 --> 01:52.600
And as we learned on Bobby Black Wolf tonight, you never know who might recruit you.

01:52.600 --> 01:54.800
So tune into that.

01:54.800 --> 01:55.800
You know what?

01:55.800 --> 01:57.800
I don't think I could work for evil.

01:57.800 --> 01:58.800
All right.

01:58.800 --> 01:59.800
Moving on.

01:59.800 --> 02:02.360
Say hello to evil tech master Loki.

02:02.360 --> 02:05.240
I could if they pay well.

02:05.240 --> 02:06.720
We slaughter kittens.

02:06.720 --> 02:07.760
Okay.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.600
Do I hear a hundred dollars for your soul?

02:09.600 --> 02:11.120
A hundred, a hundred, two hundred.

02:11.120 --> 02:12.800
How you doing, tech master Loki?

02:12.800 --> 02:16.800
I mean, maybe virtual kittens, but it's not, not real.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.560
Stop that's wrong.

02:18.560 --> 02:19.560
What's up?

02:19.560 --> 02:20.560
What's new?

02:20.560 --> 02:21.560
Doing fine.

02:21.560 --> 02:22.560
Yeah.

02:22.560 --> 02:23.560
What was this project thingy?

02:23.560 --> 02:25.520
You were showing me pictures of a project thingy you've been working on.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.080
Oh, it was just brief.

02:27.080 --> 02:30.440
I was trying to make something for Josh's birthday party because he had a Mario themed

02:30.440 --> 02:31.840
birthday party.

02:31.840 --> 02:36.080
But is this to match his Mario themed bedroom and so forth?

02:36.080 --> 02:37.080
Well, it's just this year.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.400
Cause last year was pork themed.

02:38.400 --> 02:46.680
So we decided that I love that you threw a baby, a port themed wedding or wedding birthday.

02:46.680 --> 02:48.680
One step at a time.

02:48.680 --> 02:49.680
Okay.

02:49.680 --> 02:50.680
Seriously.

02:50.680 --> 02:57.440
Maybe later on down the line, I'd be down.

02:57.440 --> 03:00.880
But no, he had a Mario birthday party.

03:00.880 --> 03:01.880
All right.

03:01.880 --> 03:02.880
That was fun.

03:02.880 --> 03:07.280
So you made like a little paper mache coupe, or no, that was more like a paper, paper craft

03:07.280 --> 03:08.280
Koopa.

03:08.280 --> 03:09.880
It looked like origami or something.

03:09.880 --> 03:13.880
And it's, it's pretty much full size.

03:13.880 --> 03:15.600
It's over two feet tall.

03:15.600 --> 03:21.000
But the thing is I didn't finish it because I neglected to look at the paper craft model

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
that closely.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.320
And apparently the way they have things connect together are impossible in reality because

03:27.320 --> 03:29.480
they just kind of phase through each other.

03:29.480 --> 03:33.760
Yeah, that might work in like a computer game, but it's not going to work when you have to

03:33.760 --> 03:35.200
glue stuff to other things.

03:35.200 --> 03:39.600
It's like, okay, I have to cut a hole here, I guess, in order to get this to work.

03:39.600 --> 03:46.600
I managed to get two of the pieces together before the show, like his leg in the shoe,

03:46.600 --> 03:49.480
and that was a pain in the ass.

03:49.480 --> 03:51.760
This is going to take a long time.

03:51.760 --> 03:54.120
You're the one that wanted to start arts and crafts with your video game.

03:54.120 --> 03:55.120
Hey, but it's pretty much done.

03:55.120 --> 03:56.120
I mean, it's just-

03:56.120 --> 03:57.120
No, the pictures look good.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.120
Yeah.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.120
It was good.

03:59.120 --> 04:00.680
We should try to get those up at orangelaunchvideo.com.

04:00.680 --> 04:03.440
But anyhow, let's also introduce, we have a special guest tonight.

04:03.440 --> 04:07.000
I mean, it's a big night at the Voice of Geeks Network, and I'll explain why in just a little

04:07.000 --> 04:12.560
bit, but a big night made bigger by the return of a favorite guest to OLR.

04:12.560 --> 04:14.740
He hasn't been here in some time.

04:14.740 --> 04:18.560
The last time I remember you being here was the marathon show, maybe one show after that,

04:18.560 --> 04:21.280
but you definitely haven't been here since the vlog switchover and all that.

04:21.280 --> 04:24.560
Say hello to Arkadian42 is back.

04:24.560 --> 04:25.560
Whose favorite?

04:25.560 --> 04:27.560
It's been a while, yeah.

04:27.560 --> 04:30.200
Probably some of them last year.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.840
Yeah, so welcome back.

04:31.840 --> 04:33.840
Maybe it was earlier this year, actually.

04:33.840 --> 04:34.840
Maybe.

04:34.840 --> 04:35.840
But it was in the old-

04:35.840 --> 04:36.840
Yeah, it was in the old place.

04:36.840 --> 04:37.840
Yeah.

04:37.840 --> 04:41.080
So welcome to the smaller, condensed studio.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.480
That's at Casa de Rob and Alan.

04:43.480 --> 04:47.320
So actually fit a little bit better here with the open environment rather than a little

04:47.320 --> 04:48.320
room.

04:48.320 --> 04:49.320
That's true.

04:49.320 --> 04:50.320
And you know what?

04:50.320 --> 04:51.320
Sometimes it works pretty good.

04:51.320 --> 04:52.960
Like last week when we had the whole PlayStation Home thing going on, you know, it was going

04:52.960 --> 04:54.160
on on the TV over there.

04:54.160 --> 04:57.920
So it's like, you know, we got, we got a nice open space and once in a while a cat might

04:57.920 --> 04:59.160
come through and try to lick your feet.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.160
So we'll see.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.160
Not likely.

05:01.160 --> 05:02.160
Yes.

05:02.160 --> 05:06.000
Now, Marco might walk by, stick his tail in the air and then run off.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.520
Not bloody likely.

05:08.520 --> 05:13.480
So if folks haven't heard you on the show before, let's try to tell the listeners a

05:13.480 --> 05:16.040
little bit about, like, what you're all about.

05:16.040 --> 05:17.360
You're a huge, like, Sega fan.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.560
I remember that about you, right?

05:18.560 --> 05:19.560
Something like that.

05:19.560 --> 05:22.000
I have a lot, you played a lot of Sega games when I was growing up.

05:22.000 --> 05:29.560
So I had, like, a Genesis and Saturn, basically I bought a bunch of, I have a bunch of Japanese

05:29.560 --> 05:30.560
Saturn games, though.

05:30.560 --> 05:35.800
I haven't played loads of them, just because I've never gotten really great Japanese knowledge.

05:35.800 --> 05:39.640
So a lot of them are kind of hard to play when you don't have a full, uh, you're not

05:39.640 --> 05:41.940
fully, uh, fluent in it.

05:41.940 --> 05:43.080
You just want to have the games.

05:43.080 --> 05:44.080
No, no.

05:44.080 --> 05:47.240
I sympathize with this because me trying to play through Grandia was hilarious.

05:47.240 --> 05:48.240
Yeah.

05:48.240 --> 05:52.680
And I kind of played up to where the translation ran out when I was playing it sometime like

05:52.680 --> 05:57.200
in into college and then didn't ever got past that.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.600
I got back to it anyway.

05:58.600 --> 06:02.760
I know you also do a lot of traveling, like following you on Facebook and everything you

06:02.760 --> 06:05.840
love to go on the, or at least it seems like reading your Facebook, you love to go on these

06:05.840 --> 06:07.560
like kind of like just adventures.

06:07.560 --> 06:11.740
Like I'm going to get in the car and drive to, um, a Yellowstone.

06:11.740 --> 06:12.740
See you later.

06:12.740 --> 06:13.740
Yeah.

06:13.740 --> 06:14.740
Yeah.

06:14.740 --> 06:15.740
Yeah.

06:15.740 --> 06:16.740
Pretty much a big road.

06:16.740 --> 06:19.400
I've done a big road trip the last two or three years and then I haven't done too many

06:19.400 --> 06:20.400
small road trips.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.900
I've been going to Yosemite a bunch for hiking.

06:22.900 --> 06:24.520
You climbed Half Dome this year, right?

06:24.520 --> 06:25.520
Yep.

06:25.520 --> 06:26.520
Congrats.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.520
Four years ago.

06:27.520 --> 06:31.940
And you didn't get killed, which is a thing that unfortunately has a bit of a reputation

06:31.940 --> 06:32.940
for these days.

06:32.940 --> 06:38.200
But you know, you only get killed if you're stupid, allegedly, allegedly they should change

06:38.200 --> 06:39.520
it to half Darwin allegedly.

06:39.520 --> 06:40.520
Yeah.

06:40.520 --> 06:44.760
Cause like, oh, I think there's only been like one person who's died on a, on a dry

06:44.760 --> 06:45.760
day.

06:45.760 --> 06:48.200
They might've had a little bit to drink.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.200
Yeah.

06:49.200 --> 06:53.400
But every other times, most every other time was when it was stormy or wet or there was

06:53.400 --> 06:55.920
a thunderstorm or something around.

06:55.920 --> 06:57.360
I knew someone got close.

06:57.360 --> 07:02.360
Like like two months ago, we almost fell off the side.

07:02.360 --> 07:06.480
I know you like to kind of sometimes go to expos and conventions and things too, because

07:06.480 --> 07:08.560
you're kind of like the norm of these things.

07:08.560 --> 07:12.240
Like, you know, remember Cheers and it's kind of like, you know, I'll be at California extreme

07:12.240 --> 07:14.520
and then all of a sudden, oh, Bradley's through the door.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.520
Bradley is here.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.000
Did you go to California extreme this year?

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Yes.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
I just knew you did.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.320
And I was, I was so, I was irritated.

07:23.320 --> 07:24.320
I couldn't go.

07:24.320 --> 07:26.160
I mean, granted, you know, I have to pick my priorities.

07:26.160 --> 07:30.240
Do I want to do screening movie thingies or do I want to do a California stream?

07:30.240 --> 07:31.800
And I went into Dan midnight movie.

07:31.800 --> 07:32.800
Yes.

07:32.800 --> 07:33.800
I ran him to once.

07:33.800 --> 07:34.800
Yeah.

07:34.800 --> 07:38.700
Like I saw, I was playing like a kung fu master and he was stopped by and said, hi.

07:38.700 --> 07:41.640
So how was it since we couldn't review it, none of us went, how was the California stream

07:41.640 --> 07:42.640
this year?

07:42.640 --> 07:43.640
That was pretty good.

07:43.640 --> 07:47.640
Uh, pretty much, uh, similar, similar to his usual lot, bunch of games here and there and

07:47.640 --> 07:48.640
everywhere.

07:48.640 --> 07:53.760
A bunch and can't remember if there's anything super special there that there was a bunch

07:53.760 --> 07:56.280
of new pinballs, but I didn't get to play them.

07:56.280 --> 07:57.280
Nice.

07:57.280 --> 07:59.000
I don't have a new, but at least newer ones.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.200
Did they have the Tron pinball?

08:00.200 --> 08:01.780
I have yet to play that still.

08:01.780 --> 08:02.780
Dan's friend owns one.

08:02.780 --> 08:04.760
Oh, I'm going to visit Dan's friend.

08:04.760 --> 08:05.760
The special editions.

08:05.760 --> 08:07.360
Can't remember if I saw one or not.

08:07.360 --> 08:08.360
It might've been there.

08:08.360 --> 08:10.340
I just didn't, I didn't, I didn't get a chance to play it.

08:10.340 --> 08:13.360
Now if you're not around the Bay area, I know we've talked about this on the show before,

08:13.360 --> 08:15.200
but let's say you haven't heard it before.

08:15.200 --> 08:18.240
California extreme is like this convention, I guess for lack of a better term, they call

08:18.240 --> 08:22.760
it a convention that they do at San Jose convention center.

08:22.760 --> 08:23.960
I think it was.

08:23.960 --> 08:27.960
And basically it's just, they know it was at a hotel last time I went, I don't know.

08:27.960 --> 08:29.360
It probably varies from year to year.

08:29.360 --> 08:34.080
I think they've had the, like the Hyatt down there for, but it's just, yeah, it's just

08:34.080 --> 08:40.980
all these arcade owners, private owners, mostly that own old arcade games and they just convene

08:40.980 --> 08:44.280
on a convention center or a hotel ballroom.

08:44.280 --> 08:48.560
And it's just all these games you pay 40, 50 bucks and it's just free to play the whole

08:48.560 --> 08:49.560
weekend.

08:49.560 --> 08:50.560
All these old games.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.240
And it's really an emphasis on classic games.

08:52.240 --> 08:56.920
And I've got to play so much stuff that you just don't get to play anywhere anymore.

08:56.920 --> 09:01.160
Like I played journey last, the last time I was there and you know, some pinball games

09:01.160 --> 09:05.360
once in a while they have a couple new things here and there, but it's mostly about classic,

09:05.360 --> 09:11.320
but I've got to say, um, Neil, a friend of mine, he sent me a video from California extreme,

09:11.320 --> 09:12.880
I guess like, I don't know what it was.

09:12.880 --> 09:16.480
It was one of those like animatronic bands.

09:16.480 --> 09:22.120
He sent me a very scary video of the animatronic band singing total eclipse of the heart or

09:22.120 --> 09:23.120
something.

09:23.120 --> 09:24.120
I was like, what is this?

09:24.120 --> 09:25.120
Yeah.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.120
I went by there just like once.

09:26.120 --> 09:31.840
I kind of just passed by and went solid for like 10 seconds and went on to something else.

09:31.840 --> 09:32.840
Nice.

09:32.840 --> 09:35.680
Awesome is what it is.

09:35.680 --> 09:38.680
Well you know, and I'll get into this in a little bit.

09:38.680 --> 09:43.000
Maybe if Loki had gone to California extreme, he might've found a robotron 2084 machine.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.080
Yeah, they did have one of those there to figure out who owned that, but we'll come

09:48.080 --> 09:50.920
back to that in a little bit and Bradley, I'll talk to you a little more about what

09:50.920 --> 09:52.320
you've been playing recently.

09:52.320 --> 09:53.640
A little later in the show.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.520
Uh, of course you guys are here too.

09:55.520 --> 09:59.480
The always present fourth guest on our show, or I guess fifth tonight because we do have

09:59.480 --> 10:01.000
Arcadia 42 here tonight.

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
Uh, join us live, participate with the show live at VOG network, the voice EECS network

10:06.000 --> 10:12.160
live dot vog network.com is where you can join our chat room and occasionally we read

10:12.160 --> 10:18.200
comments from our chat room and uh, yeah, DDR dollar bill is like, why it's robotron.

10:18.200 --> 10:25.080
It's robo or robo Tran, no robotron, robo, they do have it on xbox live arcade and robo.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.760
It was one of the first xbox live arcade.

10:26.760 --> 10:27.760
I haven't.

10:27.760 --> 10:28.760
Yeah.

10:28.760 --> 10:32.880
Robo Tran was a rejected 2d x character, just saying little inside joke there for the music

10:32.880 --> 10:33.880
game fans.

10:33.880 --> 10:34.880
All right.

10:34.880 --> 10:37.480
We'd like to do a kickoff topic here on the show.

10:37.480 --> 10:42.240
Every week we, um, you know, kind of start off the show with what's a big thing going

10:42.240 --> 10:48.180
on in the world and I got to tell you, everybody's got Olympic fever this week.

10:48.180 --> 10:53.760
It's all about the Olympics and it gives me an excuse to play this song.

10:53.760 --> 11:08.360
Did you really London 2012 was it 92 theme play that too.

11:08.360 --> 11:14.400
The Olympic event on a 12 hour tape delay live from London.

11:14.400 --> 11:17.120
Just change the am to PM anyhow.

11:17.120 --> 11:20.840
I don't actually really want to talk about like the Olympics itself, but I want to talk

11:20.840 --> 11:24.400
about, cause you know, you can probably go to any other website on the internet and read

11:24.400 --> 11:26.240
something about Michael Phelps.

11:26.240 --> 11:29.720
But what I really want to talk about is I want to talk about a story that's circulating

11:29.720 --> 11:32.520
the internet and I'm talking, when I'm talking circulating the internet, I don't mean just

11:32.520 --> 11:33.520
like on the video game blogs.

11:33.520 --> 11:37.240
I mean, this is on cnn.com and their tech section right now.

11:37.240 --> 11:39.920
So on CNN, they're running a story right now.

11:39.920 --> 11:43.160
Should pro gamers be considered athletes?

11:43.160 --> 11:44.160
And I think that's a good question.

11:44.160 --> 11:45.160
I want to ask you guys tonight.

11:45.160 --> 11:47.240
Oh, you're just, you're starting off with a bang.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.240
No, why not?

11:48.240 --> 11:50.680
Why should pro gamers not be considered athletes?

11:50.680 --> 11:51.740
Because it's a video game.

11:51.740 --> 11:54.880
It doesn't really require any physical prowess to be good at it.

11:54.880 --> 12:01.480
Maybe some good hand eye coordination, but the Olympics are traditionally a test of physical

12:01.480 --> 12:02.480
skill.

12:02.480 --> 12:08.440
Like maybe DDR, I don't know, but it has, it should be something purely physical.

12:08.440 --> 12:12.800
Well, let me, let me read some of the quotes from this article before I get too much more

12:12.800 --> 12:13.800
feedback.

12:13.800 --> 12:17.960
I'll put it back in our chat room as well, live.vognetwork.com and the article talks

12:17.960 --> 12:22.440
about Starcraft 2 and one of the big players in South Korea, Marine King.

12:22.440 --> 12:28.360
And he got kind of a bit of a reputation because he practiced 20 hours a day sometimes.

12:28.360 --> 12:31.840
And that got him called a gaming addict.

12:31.840 --> 12:35.840
But according to, and CNN basically compiled some comments and according to one commenter

12:35.840 --> 12:42.540
on the CNN website, one person said, would you claim that Phelps is addicted to swimming?

12:42.540 --> 12:46.380
So why did they want to say this guy was addicted to gaming because he trained 20 hours a week.

12:46.380 --> 12:48.360
Would you say that Michael Phelps is addicted to swimming?

12:48.360 --> 12:52.240
No, he's addicted to pot.

12:52.240 --> 12:55.540
Anyone who can smoke weed and then win 21 gold medals.

12:55.540 --> 12:56.540
You know what?

12:56.540 --> 12:57.540
You win.

12:57.540 --> 12:58.540
You know what?

12:58.540 --> 12:59.540
Didn't slow him down.

12:59.540 --> 13:00.540
I'm not saying that's bad.

13:00.540 --> 13:01.860
It didn't slow him down any.

13:01.860 --> 13:06.120
Not that I personally endorse it, but I'm just, it is, it is kind of funny.

13:06.120 --> 13:09.120
It does set that whole argument back a little bit, doesn't it?

13:09.120 --> 13:15.000
Some folks say, Marine King represents dedication, skill, perseverance.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.440
He's one of the best in the world.

13:18.440 --> 13:21.720
The skill required to be a pro gamer.

13:21.720 --> 13:25.160
The original article that the folks had commented on, it didn't distinguish the difference between

13:25.160 --> 13:28.200
game addiction and professional gaming or even gaming as a hobby.

13:28.200 --> 13:32.080
I do not believe the article shows the amount of skill needed to be one of the best in the

13:32.080 --> 13:36.200
world or how truly big professional gaming has become.

13:36.200 --> 13:41.080
On physicality being an important part of athletics, again, these comments from CNN.com.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.920
I wouldn't call them athletes.

13:42.920 --> 13:46.960
The one common denominator with all Olympians is the physicality involved.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.880
Even the word athlete refers to physical activity.

13:49.880 --> 13:54.560
I have no issues with video gaming, but the Olympics just seems to be the wrong venue.

13:54.560 --> 13:55.560
Exactly.

13:55.560 --> 13:58.880
You know what venue that the Olympics needs?

13:58.880 --> 13:59.880
Fuck this video game playing.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.980
It's all about fucking laser tag.

14:01.980 --> 14:02.980
Laser tag.

14:02.980 --> 14:05.220
That is physical.

14:05.220 --> 14:06.220
That is awesome.

14:06.220 --> 14:07.220
That is what we need.

14:07.220 --> 14:09.100
But then they could just do paintball.

14:09.100 --> 14:10.440
I'd be fine with paintball.

14:10.440 --> 14:13.200
I'd settle for paintball.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.940
As long as they have to be active.

14:14.940 --> 14:19.760
You know, I want like some crazy Hunger Games-ish thing, you know, where if they don't move,

14:19.760 --> 14:20.760
then they explode.

14:20.760 --> 14:25.900
Now that I'm not working, I think I should be a professional paintballer.

14:25.900 --> 14:28.660
What about that for a career change, Rob?

14:28.660 --> 14:29.660
You know what?

14:29.660 --> 14:30.840
Now's the time to try new things.

14:30.840 --> 14:32.520
Find what you really love.

14:32.520 --> 14:33.760
I sure do love shooting people.

14:33.760 --> 14:35.600
You could design guns.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.160
You like design and you like guns.

14:37.160 --> 14:38.160
You should design guns.

14:38.160 --> 14:40.160
I'm gonna design a new gun.

14:40.160 --> 14:41.160
Alright.

14:41.160 --> 14:42.400
Uh, Loki, your thoughts.

14:42.400 --> 14:47.600
Should this be, should video games, Starcraft 2 be an Olympic sport?

14:47.600 --> 14:48.600
No.

14:48.600 --> 14:49.600
Why not?

14:49.600 --> 14:50.600
Because they don't do anything.

14:50.600 --> 14:54.240
I mean, not saying they don't physically do anything.

14:54.240 --> 14:58.760
Moving a mouse is not exercise or is not, you know, athletic in any way.

14:58.760 --> 14:59.760
So no.

14:59.760 --> 15:00.760
I'm sorry.

15:00.760 --> 15:01.800
That does not belong.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.880
Somebody in chat just said a comment.

15:03.880 --> 15:05.680
Cyber Olympics or something like that.

15:05.680 --> 15:09.920
You know, if we're gonna create something that, you know, sort of way, then yeah, sure,

15:09.920 --> 15:10.920
why not.

15:10.920 --> 15:12.240
Somebody in chat just said a comment.

15:12.240 --> 15:13.560
I agree with 100%.

15:13.560 --> 15:15.760
Um, Bradley, I'll check in with you.

15:15.760 --> 15:17.440
You know, what, what do you think?

15:17.440 --> 15:20.000
Do video games deserve to be in the Olympics or no?

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
No.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.400
It's, yeah, it's not only athletic or anything, though.

15:24.400 --> 15:29.800
They could do, like, a spectator, it's not a spectator, but a, what do you call that?

15:29.800 --> 15:30.800
Uh.

15:30.800 --> 15:31.800
Exhibition.

15:31.800 --> 15:32.800
Exhibition sort of thing.

15:32.800 --> 15:33.800
Because they did something like that.

15:33.800 --> 15:34.800
I can do exhibitions.

15:34.800 --> 15:35.800
Yeah.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.800
Not that type of exhibition.

15:37.800 --> 15:41.640
They did, like, I know they were talking about the last time that London had an Olympics,

15:41.640 --> 15:44.120
they had, like, an Olympic poetry competition.

15:44.120 --> 15:45.120
Olympic poetry?

15:45.120 --> 15:46.120
Wait a minute.

15:46.120 --> 15:47.120
This is dumb.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.120
Yeah.

15:48.120 --> 15:49.280
Is pole dancing an Olympic sport?

15:49.280 --> 15:50.280
Because that's physical.

15:50.280 --> 15:51.280
Wait.

15:51.280 --> 15:52.280
You're Loki?

15:52.280 --> 15:53.280
What, Loki?

15:53.280 --> 15:54.280
I'm fine.

15:54.280 --> 15:55.280
I'm liking this.

15:55.280 --> 15:56.280
Okay.

15:56.280 --> 15:58.000
You know what used to be an Olympic sport?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Solo synchronized swimming.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Hold on, hold on.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.640
Let me change the, I want to change the question for a minute here.

16:02.640 --> 16:03.640
Oh, one more thing?

16:03.640 --> 16:04.640
What?

16:04.640 --> 16:05.640
Tug of War used to be an Olympic sport.

16:05.640 --> 16:06.640
Okay.

16:06.640 --> 16:09.660
So you all say, no, video games should not be an Olympic sport, and I actually agree.

16:09.660 --> 16:12.200
Video games should not be an Olympic sport, and I'll come back to why in a minute, but

16:12.200 --> 16:15.760
I'm gonna change the question now, because I think that's gonna change some of your answers.

16:15.760 --> 16:17.560
Should pole dancing be an Olympic sport?

16:17.560 --> 16:18.560
Dark Sakura?

16:18.560 --> 16:19.560
No.

16:19.560 --> 16:20.560
Why not?

16:20.560 --> 16:21.560
Because strippers.

16:21.560 --> 16:24.160
Loki, should pole dancing be an Olympic sport?

16:24.160 --> 16:25.440
Absolutely, and you know why?

16:25.440 --> 16:27.840
Because it's not necessarily for strippers, yes.

16:27.840 --> 16:33.000
I understand that that is what they do, but I mean, it's basically like the gymnastics

16:33.000 --> 16:35.320
routines and stuff that they do, but just on a pole.

16:35.320 --> 16:36.320
I mean-

16:36.320 --> 16:37.440
Well, included in gymnastics.

16:37.440 --> 16:41.720
But it does require, you know, physical strength, and you know, there's a bit of like-

16:41.720 --> 16:43.720
The ability to spread your legs.

16:43.720 --> 16:45.720
No.

16:45.720 --> 16:51.480
As someone who took a pole dancing class, it is not just about spreading your legs,

16:51.480 --> 16:52.480
all right?

16:52.480 --> 16:56.240
Well, I think it should be included under gymnastics.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.240
I agree.

16:57.240 --> 16:58.240
It should be under there.

16:58.240 --> 17:04.280
I mean, because if you can have this stupid gymnastics event where you're prancing around

17:04.280 --> 17:09.200
with giant ribbons, then I should be able to, you know, they should have somebody that's,

17:09.200 --> 17:11.160
you know, prancing around on a pole.

17:11.160 --> 17:16.400
Yeah, if, look, there's like a ball dance or something where the chicks come out and

17:16.400 --> 17:17.400
play with balls.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.400
Ribbons.

17:18.400 --> 17:19.400
Balls and ribbons.

17:19.400 --> 17:20.400
No, they have one as a sport.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.400
That's a sport.

17:21.400 --> 17:22.400
Yeah.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.400
Yeah, there's like gymnastics-

17:23.400 --> 17:24.400
It's like a rhythm ball, I think is what it is.

17:24.400 --> 17:25.400
Yeah.

17:25.400 --> 17:26.400
It's like Zumba.

17:26.400 --> 17:27.400
Bradley?

17:27.400 --> 17:28.400
Pole dancing?

17:28.400 --> 17:29.400
Yes or no in the Olympics?

17:29.400 --> 17:32.120
No, I wonder how they're going to go judging on that.

17:32.120 --> 17:37.960
Oh, let's see, the lady from Russia had the most erect nipples.

17:37.960 --> 17:42.580
Another one, I mean, to get it out of the gutter here a little bit, free running would

17:42.580 --> 17:45.280
be kind of cool.

17:45.280 --> 17:49.440
A lot of the X Games stuff, you know, you put a motorcycle in there and you can't really

17:49.440 --> 17:50.440
go wrong.

17:50.440 --> 17:53.100
You know, if we just combine the Olympics and the X Games together, maybe that would

17:53.100 --> 17:58.200
be kind of like a gymnastics event for the, you know, the X Games would be like strippers.

17:58.200 --> 18:01.960
Yeah, the problem is pole dancing has that stigma attached to it and it's not classy

18:01.960 --> 18:02.980
enough for the Olympics.

18:02.980 --> 18:04.360
That's why it would not, you know.

18:04.360 --> 18:09.240
I'm sure pole dancing can be done very classily, classily, classic.

18:09.240 --> 18:10.240
What's a good word?

18:10.240 --> 18:11.240
It can be done with class.

18:11.240 --> 18:12.240
Not trashy.

18:12.240 --> 18:13.240
With class.

18:13.240 --> 18:14.240
With class.

18:14.240 --> 18:16.140
I vet class.

18:16.140 --> 18:17.140
I'm not a stripper.

18:17.140 --> 18:18.140
I'm a dancer.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.140
All right.

18:19.140 --> 18:20.140
Tiger clothes?

18:20.140 --> 18:23.140
If you're dancing at Cheetah, that is not.

18:23.140 --> 18:28.860
Tigerclaw in the chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, would love to see games like Super Street

18:28.860 --> 18:31.920
Fighter IV or Ultimate Marvel versus Capcom at the Olympics.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.500
Those fighting games are super competitive.

18:33.500 --> 18:36.140
So some, some disagree with what we're saying.

18:36.140 --> 18:37.560
Now here, here's what I agree with.

18:37.560 --> 18:41.640
This is the one, this is, this was the statement I agree with 110%, which is why the video

18:41.640 --> 18:43.020
games aren't going to be in the Olympics.

18:43.020 --> 18:44.400
Fifth dream.

18:44.400 --> 18:49.600
If video games would be in the Olympics, then so should chess, checkers, and card games.

18:49.600 --> 18:53.140
Video games will not be at the Olympics for the same reason chess is not in the Olympics.

18:53.140 --> 18:59.700
And for all practical purposes, chess is like the closest thing you're ever going to get.

18:59.700 --> 19:00.700
Right?

19:00.700 --> 19:02.260
But the problem is chess isn't physical.

19:02.260 --> 19:03.260
Well, you can do chess.

19:03.260 --> 19:04.260
I play it.

19:04.260 --> 19:05.260
Bitch table.

19:05.260 --> 19:11.840
I used to be on the chess team, flipping a mote icon.

19:11.840 --> 19:12.840
Chess boxing.

19:12.840 --> 19:13.840
They do it.

19:13.840 --> 19:15.760
That actually is something that people actually do.

19:15.760 --> 19:16.760
Is that like beatboxing?

19:16.760 --> 19:21.100
Well, it's something they like to play some chess and then they box and then go back and

19:21.100 --> 19:22.100
do some more chess.

19:22.100 --> 19:30.180
It's like the biathlon for, I don't even know what that would be.

19:30.180 --> 19:31.780
Chess and boxing.

19:31.780 --> 19:36.260
Sophisticated and not sophisticated gaming.

19:36.260 --> 19:37.260
I don't know.

19:37.260 --> 19:39.420
Uh, black Wolf says full contact chess.

19:39.420 --> 19:41.900
Act Def says extreme chess.

19:41.900 --> 19:44.700
I'm going to take that time clock and shove it up your ass.

19:44.700 --> 19:49.540
What about, what about, um, there was an old Saturday night live sketch from like the seventies

19:49.540 --> 19:56.120
with the guy coaching the chess team and it was all Ponderock for Ponderock for, no, really

19:56.120 --> 19:57.120
funny.

19:57.120 --> 20:03.300
What about like, uh, I don't know, um, some sort of like CG or something like that.

20:03.300 --> 20:07.260
You know, let's just start taking stuff from like American gladiators or something, you

20:07.260 --> 20:11.700
know, where we have like, you know, a lot of, you know, they have, you know, fucking

20:11.700 --> 20:15.940
siren and zap and you know, nitro.

20:15.940 --> 20:17.820
Those were my Olympians back in the day.

20:17.820 --> 20:18.820
Okay.

20:18.820 --> 20:19.820
Those, that here we go.

20:19.820 --> 20:20.820
It was the shit.

20:20.820 --> 20:21.820
Here we go.

20:21.820 --> 20:25.340
The Olympics I think should stay to mostly traditional sports.

20:25.340 --> 20:27.060
Curling should not be an Olympic sport.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.060
Sorry.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.420
However, get out.

20:30.420 --> 20:32.380
Curling is like the only thing I'll watch.

20:32.380 --> 20:36.020
It's like professional cleaning as an Olympic sport.

20:36.020 --> 20:37.900
My mother would love curling.

20:37.900 --> 20:39.640
It is exactly what she does.

20:39.640 --> 20:42.660
The puck travels down and you follow in front of it with a broom.

20:42.660 --> 20:44.540
It's like air hockey on the large scale.

20:44.540 --> 20:47.300
Why don't we have Olympic air hockey?

20:47.300 --> 20:49.700
Curling was that I would vote for Olympic air hockey.

20:49.700 --> 20:50.700
Okay.

20:50.700 --> 20:57.940
No, but anyway, my point is keep, keep the Olympics to the traditional definition of

20:57.940 --> 20:59.020
a sport.

20:59.020 --> 21:00.020
If I can leave it at that.

21:00.020 --> 21:02.620
I mean, I'm sure we don't have, is cricket an Olympic sport?

21:02.620 --> 21:03.620
No, I don't think so.

21:03.620 --> 21:07.540
You have to have a certain amount of countries that would send a team.

21:07.540 --> 21:10.980
And I think it's why American football is not a sport.

21:10.980 --> 21:15.140
Thank God anyway.

21:15.140 --> 21:19.820
But I think that, you know, going back to stuff like the X games and all the alternative

21:19.820 --> 21:24.080
sport things, I think they need to stay in their own kind of venue for the people who

21:24.080 --> 21:29.260
are more willing to watch that sort of, of activity and make pole dancing part of the

21:29.260 --> 21:30.660
gymnastics section.

21:30.660 --> 21:31.660
What about wire skiing?

21:31.660 --> 21:33.500
Don't they have like water skiing or something like that?

21:33.500 --> 21:34.500
Cause I don't think so.

21:34.500 --> 21:35.900
I mean, I don't know what you could do with it.

21:35.900 --> 21:38.700
You have like rowing, there are events on the water.

21:38.700 --> 21:41.700
There used to be, I think water ski jumps back in.

21:41.700 --> 21:44.860
Are you saying water sports is an Olympic competition?

21:44.860 --> 21:50.180
I think back in the day, but like I said, tug of war used to be an Olympic sport.

21:50.180 --> 21:52.660
Solo synchronized swimming, Rob.

21:52.660 --> 21:55.500
Solo synchronized swimming was an Olympic sport.

21:55.500 --> 21:56.780
You're going to synchronize to, I guess.

21:56.780 --> 22:00.700
I guess it's synchronizing to the music, but you know, I agree with Ron, but anything goes

22:00.700 --> 22:01.700
rhythm gymnastics.

22:01.700 --> 22:05.660
Now look, I will move on from this topic cause clearly we believe it or not.

22:05.660 --> 22:09.700
We all in studio, we all chat may feel a little different, but in studio, we all agree.

22:09.700 --> 22:10.700
He totally man.

22:10.700 --> 22:15.460
If somebody, if I could be a rich eccentric person, I would like make up some sort of

22:15.460 --> 22:16.460
event.

22:16.460 --> 22:20.780
It's like the Olympics, but not quite, it'd be like kind of a carnival Olympics type thing.

22:20.780 --> 22:24.060
Um, so you know, you have all the diving competitions, but they wouldn't dive.

22:24.060 --> 22:26.700
They dive into a ball bin, you know, like a giant ball.

22:26.700 --> 22:31.220
You just want to put on the pomp and circumstance gown and get up there in front of everybody.

22:31.220 --> 22:33.320
May the odds be ever in your favor.

22:33.320 --> 22:36.540
Not even, you know, you want to be the queen of England of these games.

22:36.540 --> 22:37.540
Fuck that.

22:37.540 --> 22:38.540
I want to be the guy.

22:38.540 --> 22:39.540
She has diarrhea the whole time.

22:39.540 --> 22:44.140
It's a goddamn chairman of the iron chef in Japan.

22:44.140 --> 22:45.140
Fuck this American.

22:45.140 --> 22:49.060
Someone needs to give old Liz a suppository, but actually, you know what else?

22:49.060 --> 22:50.500
Her heart for that James Bond thing.

22:50.500 --> 22:51.500
I know, right?

22:51.500 --> 22:52.500
You know what else used to be a sport?

22:52.500 --> 22:57.640
What distance diving as in who could dive the longest distance before having to come

22:57.640 --> 22:58.640
up for Eric's.

22:58.640 --> 23:04.620
I like Stan and chat a hundred meters streaking here, somebody in London participated in all

23:04.620 --> 23:05.620
right.

23:05.620 --> 23:09.020
Takashi's castle, American or a Ninja warrior.

23:09.020 --> 23:13.980
There's those are two perfectly acceptable events in my, my guess.

23:13.980 --> 23:16.580
We got to move on from this topic and actually get to video games, but I do want to say I

23:16.580 --> 23:20.900
love the comment and I'm sorry, I forgot who said it cause it scrolled on by long ago.

23:20.900 --> 23:24.100
What about a separate competition for video games?

23:24.100 --> 23:26.420
Where is the true video game Olympics?

23:26.420 --> 23:31.420
Could we ever see a video game Olympics in our day or I mean, is it kind of already here

23:31.420 --> 23:32.420
with e-sports?

23:32.420 --> 23:40.380
They have the MLG garbage views and opinions expressed on this program do not necessarily

23:40.380 --> 23:41.380
reflect those.

23:41.380 --> 23:48.460
Well, I just don't like, I don't like the whole MLG as like a, I don't know.

23:48.460 --> 23:49.460
It's a little weird.

23:49.460 --> 23:51.220
I I'm, I'm cool with MLG.

23:51.220 --> 23:55.300
I don't have a beef with them, but they like, I want something with the pomp and circumstance

23:55.300 --> 23:56.300
of the Olympics.

23:56.300 --> 24:00.660
I do want Queen Elizabeth out there going, you know, you know, scowling at everything

24:00.660 --> 24:02.500
and judging other countries.

24:02.500 --> 24:03.500
I want that.

24:03.500 --> 24:07.180
I've decided that this country is the best.

24:07.180 --> 24:08.180
Fuck all of you.

24:08.180 --> 24:09.180
Fuck off.

24:09.180 --> 24:10.180
Fuck off.

24:10.180 --> 24:15.660
Like even if she won't show up, get, get, um, um, who are the two that just got married?

24:15.660 --> 24:18.580
I'm such an ignorant American right now.

24:18.580 --> 24:23.740
What Kate and Kate and William get Kate and William out there if nothing else, you know,

24:23.740 --> 24:25.860
cause video games are a younger generation.

24:25.860 --> 24:26.860
You know what?

24:26.860 --> 24:33.140
How I always remember them because the little boy in witches, his mice were Kate and William.

24:33.140 --> 24:34.140
You have issues.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.140
Or were they William and Mary?

24:35.140 --> 24:36.820
I think they were Kate and, anyway.

24:36.820 --> 24:38.060
What about disc wars?

24:38.060 --> 24:39.740
Why don't we have disc wars?

24:39.740 --> 24:41.360
Disc golf should be an official sport.

24:41.360 --> 24:44.860
You smoke a lot of pot and then try to hit the bowl.

24:44.860 --> 24:47.940
Tiger Claw in our chat room says they have the world cyber games.

24:47.940 --> 24:48.940
Okay.

24:48.940 --> 24:52.540
I have to, I have to quote act deaf here because I have to do the voice from the queen.

24:52.540 --> 24:53.940
Bunch of wankers.

24:53.940 --> 24:55.500
All right, look, look.

24:55.500 --> 24:56.500
We got to move on.

24:56.500 --> 24:57.500
I haven't even done like announcements.

24:57.500 --> 24:59.660
We have a huge show coming up after orange.

24:59.660 --> 25:01.820
I should do the whole show in a rotten accent.

25:01.820 --> 25:03.580
No, you shouldn't.

25:03.580 --> 25:08.780
Somewhere peeker Uno and queen voice somewhere peeker Uno and sill and other British listeners

25:08.780 --> 25:13.700
of this program are like crying at our accents because I sound like what's his face from

25:13.700 --> 25:17.700
Monty Python when I do it.

25:17.700 --> 25:22.740
Every time you talk in a British accent, God throws a crumpet at a kid.

25:22.740 --> 25:23.740
It feels my cat.

25:23.740 --> 25:24.740
She wouldn't move.

25:24.740 --> 25:25.740
All right.

25:25.740 --> 25:28.540
She'd be like, what the hell?

25:28.540 --> 25:29.540
Moving on.

25:29.540 --> 25:33.580
Um, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the video games we've been playing this week.

25:33.580 --> 25:35.180
Dark soccer says that I should.

25:35.180 --> 25:36.180
We'll start with you.

25:36.180 --> 25:37.180
Dark soccer.

25:37.180 --> 25:38.180
What do you been playing this week?

25:38.180 --> 25:39.620
I've been playing lots of mass effect.

25:39.620 --> 25:41.380
No, I'm not going to do it.

25:41.380 --> 25:47.500
I played a crap set of mass effect and then, um, and being laid off, I had, um, pity day

25:47.500 --> 25:52.060
where I did nothing but look at Garris fan art, read bad fan fiction, read some good

25:52.060 --> 25:59.420
fan fiction, played more mass effect, and we did a raid and wow, we actually raided.

25:59.420 --> 26:00.420
It happened.

26:00.420 --> 26:03.860
And then I had to go to bed early because of work that I don't have any more dammit.

26:03.860 --> 26:06.620
I could have finished the raid.

26:06.620 --> 26:08.580
That's the thing that sucks most in retrospect.

26:08.580 --> 26:10.340
I could have finished that damn raid.

26:10.340 --> 26:17.900
I could have stayed for the whole damn thing, but no, um, and uh, Dan and I decided to watch

26:17.900 --> 26:19.660
some game play throughs on some stuff.

26:19.660 --> 26:22.700
I mean, he's, we've got the CDX hooked up.

26:22.700 --> 26:29.100
I'm so tempted to, um, play through, uh, crap, what the fuck game is that?

26:29.100 --> 26:32.420
Um, put in Robo a lust and play through that again.

26:32.420 --> 26:34.300
Cause it's one of my favorite shooters.

26:34.300 --> 26:36.340
It's awesome game.

26:36.340 --> 26:39.820
We did watch several play throughs of full motion video games.

26:39.820 --> 26:47.100
We watched, um, dragon's lair and, um, space ace all the way through.

26:47.100 --> 26:48.940
I haven't watched space ace in a very long time.

26:48.940 --> 26:50.740
I should check that out.

26:50.740 --> 26:52.660
Space ace is a good game.

26:52.660 --> 27:00.020
Um, and then we were also watching a, did you know about, um, uh, star Fox today.

27:00.020 --> 27:05.540
And there's actually, if you use a game genie code, um, for the Nintendo 64, uh, ocarina

27:05.540 --> 27:11.940
of time, you can pull in an arwing as a, an enemy that you can target.

27:11.940 --> 27:17.260
And basically whatever that big red snake was in the game was, um, its movement patterns

27:17.260 --> 27:19.740
were based off of the arwing, huh?

27:19.740 --> 27:24.100
So that's why they had the arwing in there as an animation placeholder for when they

27:24.100 --> 27:25.740
finished the full model.

27:25.740 --> 27:31.260
So you can actually shoot an arwing, just saying kind of cool.

27:31.260 --> 27:32.980
Anything else for your gaming week?

27:32.980 --> 27:34.580
Um, pizza.

27:34.580 --> 27:38.340
All right, let's go to, let's go to Bradley.

27:38.340 --> 27:39.940
We'll let our guests go next.

27:39.940 --> 27:42.380
Bradley, what kind of stuff you've been playing in the past week or so?

27:42.380 --> 27:45.980
The main thing I've been playing is Assassin's Creed that has been sitting up on my shelf

27:45.980 --> 27:48.540
for a long time, said, no, I was going to play that.

27:48.540 --> 27:53.380
And that's one of, one of two series I get the most emails about why aren't you playing

27:53.380 --> 27:54.380
this series?

27:54.380 --> 27:57.020
And the other is Borderlands, which I finally did start playing.

27:57.020 --> 27:59.900
So that's, I got to get into that at some point.

27:59.900 --> 28:02.900
Some people kind of get bored with it just cause at least the first one is cause there's

28:02.900 --> 28:05.700
a lot of things you have to do over, do a lot of several times.

28:05.700 --> 28:11.220
Like if the climb all these towers and T to the top and then there's got a lot of things

28:11.220 --> 28:14.100
that sounded repetitive, but I was, I'm fine with that.

28:14.100 --> 28:19.860
And cause a lot of the big stuff and the acting is pretty good and, and, and actually getting

28:19.860 --> 28:23.540
up above the city and, and looking down, it's kind of fun.

28:23.540 --> 28:24.540
Like your Batman?

28:24.540 --> 28:25.540
Kind of.

28:25.540 --> 28:26.540
Yeah.

28:26.540 --> 28:29.820
And it's kind of fun just to murder guards left and right.

28:29.820 --> 28:33.860
Just to, you're supposed to be sneaking around, but just kind of let them come at you cause

28:33.860 --> 28:38.300
they're mostly easy to beat and then just have a whole fields of places just of the

28:38.300 --> 28:42.420
dead guards sitting there and actually made one place easier because you're supposed to

28:42.420 --> 28:47.780
beat up this guy who's who's like speaking to the people, trying to get them to do something.

28:47.780 --> 28:52.020
And usually there's like a bunch of people there and you have to wait for him to get

28:52.020 --> 28:53.460
to a secluded area.

28:53.460 --> 28:57.580
But I killed all the guards that were there and then just then just once you activate

28:57.580 --> 29:00.940
that thing, you just beat him up right where he started.

29:00.940 --> 29:04.420
So it makes it make that little thing a little bit easier to do.

29:04.420 --> 29:07.500
Now are you playing these games to kind of set up for the third one that's coming out

29:07.500 --> 29:09.820
that's getting a lot of hype?

29:09.820 --> 29:12.620
And I'm not really worried about that at the moment just cause I don't have loads of time

29:12.620 --> 29:13.620
to play.

29:13.620 --> 29:18.060
I might probably get to two sometime, but just something I wanted to clear from my backlog

29:18.060 --> 29:23.180
cause I have hundreds of games on the backlog.

29:23.180 --> 29:28.440
Another game played was Tetris Axis, which is more Tetris and that's various different

29:28.440 --> 29:29.440
Tetris modes.

29:29.440 --> 29:36.420
Just the bad thing about it is that they don't let you use the circle pad to control.

29:36.420 --> 29:39.940
Also played Mole Mania, just the first level of that.

29:39.940 --> 29:47.340
It's a classic sort of game, game that's on the 3DS and cause it's a classic hard puzzle

29:47.340 --> 29:48.340
game sort of thing.

29:48.340 --> 29:50.260
I just played the first part of that.

29:50.260 --> 29:56.220
And then also the other game I got to play was Rhythm Thief, which is a pretty good game.

29:56.220 --> 29:59.820
So far I've gone through the first two chapters and all the rhythm games so far have been

29:59.820 --> 30:00.820
distinct.

30:00.820 --> 30:06.380
Yeah, I was going to say, I played the demo of that on 3DS and I thought it was cool,

30:06.380 --> 30:08.660
like, everything seemed to be kind of different.

30:08.660 --> 30:09.660
I like that.

30:09.660 --> 30:10.660
Yeah.

30:10.660 --> 30:15.540
It's very, it kind of was a throwback a little bit to me, like, to Space Channel 5.

30:15.540 --> 30:20.380
But like, yeah, I mean, kind of like that zaniness off the wall uniqueness, but kind

30:20.380 --> 30:22.260
of like a different play style, which was cool.

30:22.260 --> 30:24.380
Yeah, it was pretty cool.

30:24.380 --> 30:26.020
And yeah, it's been good so far.

30:26.020 --> 30:34.940
And the one silly thing about it is that the dog that follows them around is called Fondue.

30:34.940 --> 30:39.140
And they have all these opportunities to make cheese jokes, and they do.

30:39.140 --> 30:41.140
Oh, lord.

30:41.140 --> 30:42.140
That's cool.

30:42.140 --> 30:44.380
That's definitely an old school Sega title right there, I think.

30:44.380 --> 30:45.380
Yeah.

30:45.380 --> 30:46.380
And that's about everything.

30:46.380 --> 30:47.900
And also I've played a little bit of Spelunky.

30:47.900 --> 30:51.900
I've been playing that the last few weeks and still haven't beaten the game and I've

30:51.900 --> 30:52.900
died about 800 times.

30:52.900 --> 30:58.980
And it's one of those games that you get, I get really frustrated at, at certain times,

30:58.980 --> 31:02.740
just dying left and right, saying, oh, fuck you, fuck you.

31:02.740 --> 31:06.700
I heard the soundtrack's really good to that because I saw something about the soundtrack

31:06.700 --> 31:07.700
is out.

31:07.700 --> 31:10.340
It's a pay what you want thing, but as long as you pay at least $7.

31:10.340 --> 31:11.780
Yeah, it's pretty good.

31:11.780 --> 31:18.740
I think I've heard that the XBLA version is different from the original, like the PC version.

31:18.740 --> 31:20.260
So I think people might like the PC version.

31:20.260 --> 31:21.900
That might be from the PC version.

31:21.900 --> 31:26.180
And I think people like the PC version better, but I haven't heard the PC, I haven't tried

31:26.180 --> 31:28.340
that one yet though on the PC.

31:28.340 --> 31:29.340
All right.

31:29.340 --> 31:34.260
Uh, well, if that's it, um, before I go to Loki, cause Loki I know has a big week we

31:34.260 --> 31:35.260
got to get into.

31:35.260 --> 31:37.140
I'm going to go next cause mine's actually really quick.

31:37.140 --> 31:41.220
Um, as far as new games go, there's really only one new game I got, I got to try this

31:41.220 --> 31:42.220
week.

31:42.220 --> 31:43.220
Played a lot of the same old stuff.

31:43.220 --> 31:46.220
You know, I played a world of Warcraft, played some aspect multiplayer and all that good

31:46.220 --> 31:47.220
stuff.

31:47.220 --> 31:50.260
One new game I tried over the weekend because it's having a free weekend is a new MMO called

31:50.260 --> 31:51.940
the secret world.

31:51.940 --> 31:58.660
Um, it's kind of, it's an MMO obviously, and it's set a little more in the modern day world.

31:58.660 --> 32:03.460
It's more of a modern day MMO with kind of, you know, the whole like zombie element to

32:03.460 --> 32:04.460
it.

32:04.460 --> 32:08.940
And you know, kind of a cyberpunk kind of a twist on it.

32:08.940 --> 32:10.180
Um, so it's kind of cool.

32:10.180 --> 32:14.580
It's one of the first MMOs I've played in a very long time where I didn't sit there

32:14.580 --> 32:16.260
going, Oh, this is a lot like, wow.

32:16.260 --> 32:20.260
Or, Oh, I'm looking for the wow influence or, Oh, I see that they took this from wow.

32:20.260 --> 32:23.360
And keep in mind, I, I'm usually kind of have that eye because I have been playing world

32:23.360 --> 32:26.180
of Warcraft for so long and you don't have the podcast and everything.

32:26.180 --> 32:30.260
That's how I approach a lot of games or MMOs, but I'm secret world really didn't remind

32:30.260 --> 32:31.260
me of wow at all.

32:31.260 --> 32:36.100
The combat was really fast paced, which, you know, another friend of mine was playing it

32:36.100 --> 32:39.340
and it kind of irritated him, but I kind of liked the combat.

32:39.340 --> 32:43.540
I also liked that these, there was no leveling yet.

32:43.540 --> 32:47.500
There was this skill wheel that kind of took the place and you could combine your skills

32:47.500 --> 32:49.220
in very interesting ways.

32:49.220 --> 32:53.740
Like the chick I was playing could use magic, like elemental magic, but she also wielded

32:53.740 --> 32:59.460
a sword because she's kind of like, you know, Beatrix kiddo from kill bill, except with

32:59.460 --> 33:00.740
magic and a sword.

33:00.740 --> 33:02.240
That's kind of how I imagined her.

33:02.240 --> 33:07.820
So I mean, that was kind of like fun to play and, and the different environment is a lead

33:07.820 --> 33:11.580
leads way to a different set of quests and all that and a different type of story.

33:11.580 --> 33:16.380
And yeah, I got to say, I was feeling it, but I'm going to tell you what I'm not feeling

33:16.380 --> 33:20.800
with the price because if I want to play beyond this weekend, I'm going to have to pay $50

33:20.800 --> 33:21.800
for the game.

33:21.800 --> 33:25.380
I'm going to have to pay $14.99 a month, you know, that's now granted that standard for

33:25.380 --> 33:26.380
a lot of MMOs.

33:26.380 --> 33:29.060
Sword tour was the same when it first came out.

33:29.060 --> 33:34.820
But what I don't like is that they're selling on top of that, all these like ammo packs

33:34.820 --> 33:37.220
and you know, things to get like, no joke.

33:37.220 --> 33:42.420
I saw something on the website that was, I want to say it was like $129 worth of in game

33:42.420 --> 33:43.420
items and stuff.

33:43.420 --> 33:47.440
And I'm just like, hold on you guys for such a new thing, you guys are nickel and diamond

33:47.440 --> 33:48.440
way too much.

33:48.440 --> 33:52.660
So I get to do the free to play and the subscription thing, which I understand.

33:52.660 --> 33:53.660
Yes.

33:53.660 --> 33:55.500
World of Warcraft sells those mounts and those pets.

33:55.500 --> 34:00.100
I've never bought one that wasn't for charity, but those things also don't give you an edge

34:00.100 --> 34:01.140
in the game.

34:01.140 --> 34:03.540
And I was a little put off by that.

34:03.540 --> 34:07.740
And honestly, I think it's, it's happening to every other MMOs we're going to get into

34:07.740 --> 34:08.740
later this week.

34:08.740 --> 34:12.180
I think it's just a matter of time before secret world goes free to play or gets a price

34:12.180 --> 34:13.180
reduction.

34:13.180 --> 34:14.180
So you know what?

34:14.180 --> 34:15.220
I'm just going to wait till then.

34:15.220 --> 34:20.180
I did enjoy what I played of it, but if it's going to go the way of every other MMO, sorry.

34:20.180 --> 34:24.100
I know that that might give me some stink eye from developers and things like that,

34:24.100 --> 34:29.660
but I just, I don't, I didn't love it enough to just jump on board and support it.

34:29.660 --> 34:31.500
That's that's where I was with it.

34:31.500 --> 34:36.020
And SGA 100 Mountain chat says, yeah, but Rob does, doesn't, didn't Blizzard sell useless

34:36.020 --> 34:37.020
mounts.

34:37.020 --> 34:38.020
Correct.

34:38.020 --> 34:39.020
They do.

34:39.020 --> 34:40.020
And I don't like it.

34:40.020 --> 34:41.020
I got to admit, I don't like that they do that.

34:41.020 --> 34:42.260
I think it's an, I don't buy those mounts.

34:42.260 --> 34:44.420
I think 25 bucks or whatever they charge for a mount.

34:44.420 --> 34:46.700
I think it's ridiculous.

34:46.700 --> 34:52.340
However, once in a while Blizzard will put out a $10 pet where it all goes to charity

34:52.340 --> 34:53.580
or something like that.

34:53.580 --> 34:54.580
I'm okay with that.

34:54.580 --> 34:55.740
That's a lot different.

34:55.740 --> 35:01.340
So those I have bought, but I've never bought a mount for the 25 or whatever.

35:01.340 --> 35:03.220
I just think that's a little silly.

35:03.220 --> 35:07.100
And I also think they charge way too much for the server transfers and wow has other

35:07.100 --> 35:08.580
pricing issues too.

35:08.580 --> 35:12.620
The cost to enter the game right now between buying the Battle Chest, Wrath of the Lich

35:12.620 --> 35:16.560
King, Cataclysm, and soon Pandaria, it's, it's, it's ridiculous.

35:16.560 --> 35:20.820
And that's why wow is losing subscribers, but I'll get into that a little later in the

35:20.820 --> 35:21.820
show.

35:21.820 --> 35:22.820
For now.

35:22.820 --> 35:23.820
That's it for my gaming week.

35:23.820 --> 35:25.620
Loki, Loki, Loki, Loki.

35:25.620 --> 35:26.620
All right.

35:26.620 --> 35:32.180
So I read Twitter and I listened to this show.

35:32.180 --> 35:36.460
So I know you took the day off work on Wednesday, right?

35:36.460 --> 35:37.460
Yes.

35:37.460 --> 35:41.440
So you could stay up Tuesday night because the third gate was opening in that ready player

35:41.440 --> 35:45.300
one competition that you've been talking about for weeks and weeks and weeks.

35:45.300 --> 35:46.300
Yeah.

35:46.300 --> 35:50.460
So take us back to Tuesday night and that evening, walk us through your evening, the

35:50.460 --> 35:53.700
anticipation and the, uh, what happened next.

35:53.700 --> 35:57.820
So I was sitting on my computer, you know, waiting, counting down the minutes and stuff

35:57.820 --> 36:01.140
like that for the ready player one contest, the next gate to open.

36:01.140 --> 36:05.900
Cause it was the next video game challenge and you know, a bunch of people that were

36:05.900 --> 36:12.780
kind of in the competition, we're all just, you know, waiting for it to open and, um,

36:12.780 --> 36:14.020
so finally keep refreshing it.

36:14.020 --> 36:20.140
It's like a couple minutes before, uh, nine o'clock Pacific, which, you know, is a midnight

36:20.140 --> 36:24.740
East coast and it actually opened the couple minutes early.

36:24.740 --> 36:31.180
So immediately I was greeted with, you know, the next page and they're talking about how,

36:31.180 --> 36:34.980
you know, how, you know, the third gate contest.

36:34.980 --> 36:40.300
And basically, you know, here it was so ready player one Easter egg hunt, the third gate

36:40.300 --> 36:46.180
to complete the third challenge in the RP one Easter egg contest, you must, and this

36:46.180 --> 36:52.180
is where I was like, what you must set a new world record high score on one of the following

36:52.180 --> 37:02.860
classic video games, robotron 2084 joust black tiger and tempest.

37:02.860 --> 37:09.140
Now since then they've added joust on the Atari 2,600 and Pac-Man, but all the rest

37:09.140 --> 37:11.180
are arcade versions.

37:11.180 --> 37:18.180
So basically nobody was going to, it was, it was a waste of time to, you know, even

37:18.180 --> 37:21.420
bother staying up because obviously it's not something that you're going to be able to

37:21.420 --> 37:22.420
do right away.

37:22.420 --> 37:27.460
Um, it says, uh, of course the record setting, the record setting game must be played on

37:27.460 --> 37:32.300
the original game hardware, meaning that you have to play an original coin operated arcade

37:32.300 --> 37:36.740
game, or in the case of joust, which this is all added later because he's literally

37:36.740 --> 37:44.740
tweaked the rules for this contest about 12 times before, since I'm reading it now, um,

37:44.740 --> 37:48.220
you must follow, anyways, uh, no emulators are allowed.

37:48.220 --> 37:52.220
You can practice on any of these games with an emulator, but when you set the world record

37:52.220 --> 37:54.900
it must be done on the original game hardware.

37:54.900 --> 37:58.400
And then of course it goes into a little bit of detail what you need to do.

37:58.400 --> 38:01.640
Basically this is tied in with twin galaxies, you have to follow their submission rules

38:01.640 --> 38:07.620
and stuff, and I haven't really played around with twin galaxies that much because I kind

38:07.620 --> 38:14.100
of roll my eyes every time I hear about twin galaxies, but, um, their submissions are ridiculous.

38:14.100 --> 38:18.380
Basically you have to, so here's the challenge.

38:18.380 --> 38:23.580
Number one, pick a game that you're going to somehow get the world record to.

38:23.580 --> 38:28.380
Well actually even before that, find an arcade.

38:28.380 --> 38:31.440
Number two, find an arcade that has classic games, because classic games don't bring

38:31.440 --> 38:35.860
in money to arcades anymore so they don't have them anymore.

38:35.860 --> 38:41.180
Number three, find an arcade with a classic game that happens to be nearby because, you

38:41.180 --> 38:46.340
know, there's not a lot of them, that's also willing to allow you to stay there for long

38:46.340 --> 38:51.620
hours and open up their arcade machine and film the inside of the arcade machine as well

38:51.620 --> 38:56.700
as you playing the game without any sort of interruptions from little kids or something,

38:56.700 --> 39:00.900
you know, jumping in the way, knocking over your camera equipment, all that other stuff.

39:00.900 --> 39:07.940
And that's even before you're able to even beat the high score, because this is not like

39:07.940 --> 39:12.380
a high score on an arcade machine, this is breaking a world record, you know, we're talking

39:12.380 --> 39:17.840
about like the King of Kong stuff, Chasing Ghosts, I mean they make documentaries about

39:17.840 --> 39:22.860
this about people that have these games in the garage and they play them for hours and

39:22.860 --> 39:24.780
hours and hours a day.

39:24.780 --> 39:29.780
Loki if you want, I know a film crew.

39:29.780 --> 39:36.420
I mean, it's just, here's my disappointment, I understand that, you know, he's basically

39:36.420 --> 39:42.340
saying okay, well this is the type of competition stuff that was in Ready Player One, the boat,

39:42.340 --> 39:44.580
okay, let's back up for a second.

39:44.580 --> 39:50.700
Okay, the first gate was an Atari 2600 game, an original Atari 2600 game they made specifically

39:50.700 --> 39:51.700
for this gate.

39:51.700 --> 39:56.700
That was cool, because it tied in with the game and it was challenging but it wasn't

39:56.700 --> 40:00.220
like, oh my god this is impossible to beat.

40:00.220 --> 40:04.300
Number two, and granted these are all supposed to be increasing in challenge each time, number

40:04.300 --> 40:06.620
two was not a challenge at all, it was a Facebook game.

40:06.620 --> 40:11.780
The only challenge was my patience in playing a Facebook game that was basically pay-to-win.

40:11.780 --> 40:15.140
I want to point something out though, between that first and second gate, that first gate

40:15.140 --> 40:19.660
you have the classic, you have the old, you have the history of video games right there.

40:19.660 --> 40:23.140
I mean, granted it's not like Space War or something like that, but for all practical

40:23.140 --> 40:26.800
purposes the Atari 2600 is about as far back as most of our gaming memories go.

40:26.800 --> 40:31.020
And then for the second gate you had the most modern thing, I mean love it or hate it, Facebook

40:31.020 --> 40:32.900
is gaming right now for a lot of people.

40:32.900 --> 40:39.020
The only reason that it was tied in with it because it was Richard Garriott, the guy

40:39.020 --> 40:44.180
that was behind Ultima, a pretty classic series.

40:44.180 --> 40:49.660
Granted I would have thought the Ultima MMO that they're beta testing or something like

40:49.660 --> 40:54.180
that would have been a better fit for this, but you know, whatever, Facebook game where

40:54.180 --> 40:57.600
you collect vintage stuff, fine.

40:57.600 --> 40:58.600
But it was annoying.

40:58.600 --> 40:59.600
Okay.

40:59.600 --> 41:00.600
It wasn't difficult though.

41:00.600 --> 41:05.440
There was absolutely no skill involved in it at all other than click click click, alright

41:05.440 --> 41:08.700
crap I ran out of energy, gotta wait for more energy.

41:08.700 --> 41:11.780
Click click click, oh crap, oh I don't want to wait anymore I'm gonna pay for more energy.

41:11.780 --> 41:14.340
I mean that's really the only skill that was involved there.

41:14.340 --> 41:18.700
To, oh hey by the way you gotta set a fucking world record, I mean that's a little like

41:18.700 --> 41:22.300
woof, like what the hell kind of a difficulty curve is that?

41:22.300 --> 41:24.300
I mean that's a little ridiculous.

41:24.300 --> 41:29.620
Now let, to be fair you know like I said this sort of kind of ties in with you know the

41:29.620 --> 41:34.420
book and you know how well you know the main character in the book he played a perfect

41:34.420 --> 41:41.100
game of Pac-Man and stuff like that and you know oh cool you know, but you have to understand

41:41.100 --> 41:47.740
in the book these people were, this guy leaves his fortune of billions of dollars, billions

41:47.740 --> 41:53.180
of dollars and these people have to find these easter eggs to get this vast amount of fortune

41:53.180 --> 41:56.860
so they become experts in everything 80s.

41:56.860 --> 42:01.000
Including playing arcade games for like all of their free time and we're talking like

42:01.000 --> 42:05.620
just people just playing games and the reason that that main character goes in the first

42:05.620 --> 42:10.940
place to this like kind of an arcade museum and plays that Pac-Man machine because he

42:10.940 --> 42:15.260
likes playing Pac-Man it's not because oh shit I gotta play this Pac-Man machine perfectly

42:15.260 --> 42:19.260
so I can get this you know whatever to open another gate and it didn't even have anything

42:19.260 --> 42:25.180
to do with the other gate but it's just because he enjoys playing these games but now forcing

42:25.180 --> 42:30.020
people to play these arcade games in the world record you're not targeting your audience

42:30.020 --> 42:35.620
of people that enjoy 80s stuff and read your book and like the book you're targeting people

42:35.620 --> 42:39.100
that play arcade games hardcore and that's it.

42:39.100 --> 42:44.740
Alright let me, since it's only a three hour show Loki, let me throw some tough questions

42:44.740 --> 42:46.100
at you.

42:46.100 --> 42:49.220
Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room at live.vognetware.com.

42:49.220 --> 42:52.220
The guy apparently doesn't want to make it easy for someone to get his car.

42:52.220 --> 42:53.740
You knew it wasn't going to be easy.

42:53.740 --> 42:55.980
I didn't think it was going to be easy but I thought it was going to be a little bit

42:55.980 --> 43:01.580
more original like you know let's get the guy that created you know fucking I want to

43:01.580 --> 43:05.580
be the guy to create some new custom game that ties in with the series and it's fucking

43:05.580 --> 43:09.120
hard I don't mind that that would have been fair because it would have been something

43:09.120 --> 43:12.700
unique that oh this is challenging but I just have to be skilled enough to do it.

43:12.700 --> 43:17.300
The thing that you know I gotta say it this may surprise you I actually agree with you

43:17.300 --> 43:21.820
to some extent that this is a little bit silly because it's one of those things that looks

43:21.820 --> 43:26.020
good on paper like oh yeah we're gonna have the contest end all contest but if you really

43:26.020 --> 43:32.220
think about it you're right the way to get to the way you're gonna beat this is is not

43:32.220 --> 43:35.900
something everybody can accomplish it's kind of an uneven playing field I'm not even talking

43:35.900 --> 43:40.420
about gaming skill I'm just talking about access to these games because yeah to find

43:40.420 --> 43:45.780
an original machine there's only so many arcades in the nation that even have something like

43:45.780 --> 43:49.920
that and if you're like you might be the most hardcore gaming fan in the world and you live

43:49.920 --> 43:55.280
in Montana you're fucked there's necessarily there I mean I don't know of any big classic

43:55.280 --> 44:00.220
gaming arcades in Montana excuse me if I'm wrong but you're gonna have to find an independent

44:00.220 --> 44:04.980
game collector you're gonna have to be like John Jay rental from video game outsiders

44:04.980 --> 44:09.660
who has the arcade in his basement you gotta know something about necessarily there's any

44:09.660 --> 44:16.420
of those places will rent out classic games to pizza parlors to mom-and-pop places okay

44:16.420 --> 44:23.420
to go ahead so just restaurants in general you know skating rinks my the skating rink

44:23.420 --> 44:29.380
I went to in Dothan Alabama since I was a little kid had the same damn Frogger there

44:29.380 --> 44:35.340
even when I went as an adult the same Frogger I played since it was brand fucking new just

44:35.340 --> 44:41.540
saying you can find them okay I'm not saying it's impossible but it's not it's not like

44:41.540 --> 44:45.980
you know hey any of these challenges where it's okay here's the here's the ROM or here's

44:45.980 --> 44:50.260
the the game that you can play in a flash you know in the browser and everybody has

44:50.260 --> 44:57.180
access to it this is like okay find arcade game and play it and you know he keeps at

44:57.180 --> 45:02.620
like I said he keeps adding more stuff to this and he's he's supposed to be adding more

45:02.620 --> 45:09.700
more games each week but that's the thing too that I also don't like these rules keep

45:09.700 --> 45:14.140
getting fucking tweaked every time and beyond that and that's what shows me it wasn't thought

45:14.140 --> 45:17.580
out because they're having to consistently tweak the rules because they're realizing

45:17.580 --> 45:22.100
oh fuck that we did make this impossible here's here's my other question for you it seems

45:22.100 --> 45:25.740
like there's some good sportsmanship and camaraderie amongst all the people who've gone far in

45:25.740 --> 45:28.580
this competition right like you guys are all talking to each other and stuff there's some

45:28.580 --> 45:33.900
people yeah sort of like what's been the reaction overall like is everybody pissed like you

45:33.900 --> 45:38.740
or are there some people that are like all right now this is a contest there are some

45:38.740 --> 45:43.900
people that are kind of like kiss asses like that that's my opinion at least that are like

45:43.900 --> 45:48.620
well I think this is I think this is a perfect contest blah blah blah blah blah but like

45:48.620 --> 45:52.900
you know I'll read some examples like one of the posts or whatever on planet ludus which

45:52.900 --> 45:58.940
is one of the websites that's kind of dedicated to all this stuff and I laughed when I saw

45:58.940 --> 46:04.300
it because it was is basically the thread topic was you've got to be kidding me and

46:04.300 --> 46:09.980
then you know the post seriously and then you know the next ones well nobody's gonna

46:09.980 --> 46:13.820
beat it tonight haha man I live in it I live in the country it's gonna be tough finding

46:13.820 --> 46:21.900
an actual working arcade I bet collector has these arcades are gonna be bombarded and what

46:21.900 --> 46:27.300
is it so just in case any further proof you won't win the DeLorean I'm serious I don't

46:27.300 --> 46:31.500
I'm thinking no one is going to win unless someone's already working on world record

46:31.500 --> 46:35.240
happens to hear about this cause that's the other thing too one of these world record

46:35.240 --> 46:40.260
holders you know hears about this contest because obviously it's on the internet you

46:40.260 --> 46:44.540
know what to say they're not gonna go oh hey you know I'm just gonna do these play these

46:44.540 --> 46:48.260
really fucking easy games and cool I got a DeLorean now we're gonna see Billy Mitchell

46:48.260 --> 46:52.380
with a DeLorean end of story I think that's exactly what's gonna end up happening I think

46:52.380 --> 46:56.260
one of the existing record holders is gonna get wind of this if they haven't already and

46:56.260 --> 46:59.760
it's just gonna motivate them to break their existing record and it's that guy that plays

46:59.760 --> 47:04.380
with his feet though that'd be awesome but see that's that's fucking lame and here's

47:04.380 --> 47:09.300
the other thing too is they've also at like I said they keep adding and changing the rules

47:09.300 --> 47:16.420
they put anything now well if the third gates not completed by October 1st you know check

47:16.420 --> 47:23.020
back to this page we may have a fourth gate or we may just end the contest it's just like

47:23.020 --> 47:28.140
really I mean you're gonna do this crap here's the problem though and I'm trying to make

47:28.140 --> 47:32.140
this short but here's the problem I'm torn because I don't want to quit I don't want

47:32.140 --> 47:38.660
to quit now but at the same time I don't want to invest in the stuff that I need to in order

47:38.660 --> 47:44.620
to complete it like for example I have an arcade machine at home it's just a main cabinet

47:44.620 --> 47:49.100
but it's an arcade machine I popped that computer out of there it's a jamma cabinet I could

47:49.100 --> 47:55.540
pop any jamma game in there I wanted to play black tiger there was a whole bunch of you

47:55.540 --> 48:00.460
know drama behind that too because everyone there's a conspiracy that the black tiger

48:00.460 --> 48:06.940
machine that the guy used to complete the world record was somehow not necessarily modified

48:06.940 --> 48:11.780
in you know maybe he didn't know it was modified but that it was a hybrid machine meaning it

48:11.780 --> 48:15.180
had some of the chips from black tiger and had some of the chips from black dragon which

48:15.180 --> 48:19.340
is the Japanese version of the game and the Japanese version scores differently than the

48:19.340 --> 48:26.100
US version which may have caused that of course they you know twin galaxies approved it and

48:26.100 --> 48:32.420
said no it's legit but I mean they're doing that off a video and you know if it's not

48:32.420 --> 48:35.980
legit are they really gonna go back and go oh we made a mistake I don't think so I don't

48:35.980 --> 48:40.100
think that they're going to at this point but there's claim it's still legit he even

48:40.100 --> 48:44.220
Ernie Klein actually posted something in his blog about it saying oh it's legit and stuff

48:44.220 --> 48:48.060
oh and here's the other thing to tell you how out of touch you know I think he is with

48:48.060 --> 48:53.100
his fans he does own like a black tiger machine I think he actually has a few arcade cabinets

48:53.100 --> 48:57.500
cool that you're into arcade where does he live I have no fucking clue yeah I understand

48:57.500 --> 49:05.260
go play it in his house but you know I'm actually I'm thinking about buying a black tiger arcade

49:05.260 --> 49:12.220
board my god but I see the thing is though is I don't want to black tiger though like

49:12.220 --> 49:16.680
I said the high score on it is million are being such a boy right now you are being such

49:16.680 --> 49:21.900
a boy right now where you do not want to give up on this you are just I know I'm not gonna

49:21.900 --> 49:28.260
stop and ask for directions I'm gonna beat this damn it and then you're gonna get cut

49:28.260 --> 49:31.580
off at the knees by one of these guys that already holds the world record and you're

49:31.580 --> 49:36.140
gonna be three times as pissed as you are tonight I know I've known you for ten plus

49:36.140 --> 49:40.780
years that's exactly what's gonna happen hey I understand that that's possible oh yeah

49:40.780 --> 49:44.380
and then of course the Pac-Man world record you have to beat the the time so we're already

49:44.380 --> 49:48.980
50 minutes in I gotta bring this to a close but I have to ask this okay and we have a

49:48.980 --> 49:53.200
show following us tonight so we can't have a marathon show tonight but I gotta ask this

49:53.200 --> 49:58.540
Twitter drama cuz I gotta say Loki you were a little bit ranny pants on Twitter and you

49:58.540 --> 50:03.780
went so far to say say fuck you Ernie Klein which did strike me as a little bit angry

50:03.780 --> 50:10.740
12 year old but okay you're mad whatever what's going on on Twitter you get angry and he follows

50:10.740 --> 50:18.820
you I guess yeah but you know what I I've I've tweeted him before because he had posted

50:18.820 --> 50:24.960
or he did a video talking about his DeLorean that he's given up and you know he misquoted

50:24.960 --> 50:30.580
himself like he's oh yeah it's got 249,000 miles on him like well how many fucking miles

50:30.580 --> 50:35.340
did you put on that thing it was only had 29,000 miles before oh that's the other thing

50:35.340 --> 50:40.100
too the DeLorean is only like 25 grand that's what he bought it for off eBay he's put 6,000

50:40.100 --> 50:45.380
miles on it right now yeah the contest rules say oh it's worth $25,000 dude you've put

50:45.380 --> 50:50.540
fucking 6,000 miles on it in like a few months chatter here's the thing and Bobby and Chad

50:50.540 --> 50:55.200
is saying is the Black Tiger arcade board cheaper than a tricked-out DeLorean you guys

50:55.200 --> 51:00.900
don't understand Loki it doesn't matter at this point because now it's a thing it's become

51:00.900 --> 51:04.780
a thing and now it doesn't matter anymore folks it doesn't matter if the value of that

51:04.780 --> 51:17.660
board is greater it it's a thing am I right Loki it's a thing I just want to win it's

51:17.660 --> 51:23.980
exactly it personally I would want to try robotron but finding a Williams machine is

51:23.980 --> 51:31.460
like near impossible all right so other things that played Minecraft I played Call of Duty

51:31.460 --> 51:36.860
and oh I did play Black Tiger a little bit because I got that's what I did that night

51:36.860 --> 51:40.480
when I got pissed off I'm like fuck this shit I'm just gonna boot up my cabinet and play

51:40.480 --> 51:44.220
Black Tiger a little bit because I haven't I haven't really played that and that's the

51:44.220 --> 51:47.020
other thing too it's like if you're gonna create this world record it's I think a lot

51:47.020 --> 51:50.300
of these people to do it don't just say I just want to hold the world record this it's

51:50.300 --> 51:55.940
they enjoy playing that game I don't enjoy playing Black Tiger but I don't know we'll

51:55.940 --> 51:59.460
see what they add I don't know there's not really I don't think all of them are gonna

51:59.460 --> 52:02.500
be breaking world records so I don't think anyone's gonna do it and to be honest he said

52:02.500 --> 52:07.060
so far he's has four because one of the first things you have to do is you take a picture

52:07.060 --> 52:10.540
of the machine that you're gonna attempt the thing on and you send them also you know the

52:10.540 --> 52:15.860
gear pictures they took for the first two gates he's had there's almost 1,200 people

52:15.860 --> 52:21.980
have passed the first gate 725 that have passed the second gate five that have emailed him

52:21.980 --> 52:26.560
a picture for the third gate so far that even say they're attempting game guru says just

52:26.560 --> 52:32.020
buy the damn DeLorean nope I'm sorry buddy it's a thing that's what you're missing it's

52:32.020 --> 52:38.380
not about the DeLorean anymore that's the problem it's a manual DeLore it's a manual

52:38.380 --> 52:45.260
car that sucks can't even drive a manual I can't drive a manual it sucks gas and it can

52:45.260 --> 52:55.460
only be repaired in Southern California so but you still want it yes that's got to be

52:55.460 --> 53:03.540
the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life it is him it is you are by one you are happy

53:03.540 --> 53:08.340
you'll spend less money no no no I won't dark soccer you don't how long have you known this

53:08.340 --> 53:12.500
man that's not gonna get it that's not the answer no one's gonna win it cuz they're gonna

53:12.500 --> 53:18.740
I don't want to give away my DeLorean anyway me all right we're talking in circles anything

53:18.740 --> 53:25.420
else for your gaming week Logie I just want to win so I can punch him in the face you

53:25.420 --> 53:31.100
are so mature thank you thank you for exuding the maturity that hosts of this show should

53:31.100 --> 53:38.460
have all over the internet fuck you or any client oh you're following me shit I said

53:38.460 --> 53:42.700
you sent him a DM inviting him on the show we can hash this out I'm I'm gonna hash this

53:42.700 --> 53:46.540
out I'll send him a DM send him a DM invite him on the show and say I want to hash this

53:46.540 --> 53:54.620
out all right I'll send him we need to work this out I think he's kind of busy doing things

53:54.620 --> 53:59.500
but don't trolling you that's what he's busy doing acts deft is right it's time for an

53:59.500 --> 54:07.900
intervention I'm fine like I'm walking on sunshine it's just it's frustrating okay it's

54:07.900 --> 54:12.440
like I put this much effort into it so far I'm not gonna I don't want to quit right now

54:12.440 --> 54:20.580
even though it's ridiculous it's ridiculous I mean playing playing a 2600 game playing

54:20.580 --> 54:27.300
a Facebook game world record we got passed by something cooler than a DeLorean last night

54:27.300 --> 54:35.100
okay thanks that that's that's really informative you're missing the thing but Lamborghini that's

54:35.100 --> 54:39.780
not that is that is not in the thing equation that's the problem hey I have an idea let

54:39.780 --> 54:44.260
me run a contest for Lord of the Rings and then the last part of the contest is you got

54:44.260 --> 54:50.220
to be an Olympic gold medal winning fencer because it has fucking swords in it that makes

54:50.220 --> 54:55.300
perfect sense that's gonna really narrow down your you have to bring the one ring and Loki

54:55.300 --> 55:01.700
will be the chick from South Korea that's sitting on the platform crying yeah no that's

55:01.700 --> 55:07.300
how this ends I am almost considering I I'm not putting much effort into this right now

55:07.300 --> 55:12.900
but I in and I'm not buying a Black Tiger arcade board right now but I'm just saying

55:12.900 --> 55:17.660
I will play casually and if I see that okay look I figured out something that no one else

55:17.660 --> 55:21.340
has figured out on it and I can get a high score that can beat the world record then

55:21.340 --> 55:28.860
sure yes I will do all that and film all that stuff but at the same time I don't I just

55:28.860 --> 55:37.300
don't have the time I don't have the time to do this Loki you just played 67 hours of

55:37.300 --> 55:45.620
joust in an attempt to win 67 hours who the fuck's gonna do that you just played 67 hours

55:45.620 --> 55:55.500
of joust in an attempt to win a used car how do you feel 67 hours yeah that's how long

55:55.500 --> 56:06.700
it takes for joust no hey it's a historical night here at vog network www dot vog network

56:06.700 --> 56:10.740
dot com hey boys between galaxies wanted to remind everybody that if you do break the

56:10.740 --> 56:15.340
world record before September 5th you get to be in the world wreck or the Guinness Book

56:15.340 --> 56:20.540
this year of gaming whoo speaking of twin galaxies let's talk about space can I talk

56:20.540 --> 56:28.460
about space yes no Travis Donovan tonight at vog network is the best at space he is

56:28.460 --> 56:34.740

58:53.600 --> 58:56.900

59:31.780 --> 59:42.020
gaming news geez Loki so Star Wars the older Republic's going free-to-play well it'll transition

59:42.020 --> 59:46.740
to a hybrid free-to-play that's what they're calling it basically they're gonna allow a

59:46.740 --> 59:51.180
major portion of the game to be free including the first 50 levels in all eight classes of

59:51.180 --> 59:57.380
course there's gonna be restrictions and microtransactions to go with that if you do subscribe to the

59:57.380 --> 01:00:02.580
game you will be given a currency each month called cartel coins you can buy customized

01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:10.820
gear and other items also you'll get other special rewards if you're a different subscriber

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:17.340
then they you know they basically said that they want to give people flexibility so you

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:23.580
know you want to do a subscription you can do that otherwise you know you can you know

01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:31.820
not and of course apparently the numbers have been dipping a little bit the people are actually

01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:36.720
subscribed to it they've sold two million copies however right now there's only less

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:43.540
than a million people actually playing so that's not very good there's tons of tons

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:47.180
of people playing for it who aren't paying for it or are they doing that whole free isn't

01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:52.220
already free to play to play in for it whatever free to play to level 15 or 20 so yeah it's

01:00:52.220 --> 01:01:00.980
like a yes bullet 20 I know that is either 10 or 15 but I think free to play will definitely

01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:08.900
help their numbers so that's kind of cool I mean I just think that a lot of people maybe

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:14.540
didn't like the game and so they just stopped playing it's not necessarily this effect well

01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:19.660
it's a really good single-player game I don't think there was enough cutting-edge content

01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:26.020
for the multiplayer was the problem and for me PvP ran really sluggish and I have a pretty

01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:31.620
high-end computer so it made it a lot less fun to play I liked a lot of ideas in the

01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:38.340
game and the storytelling was done really well but I just think I think it was a game

01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:42.660
that had about three months worth of content that that's about how long it lasted unfortunately

01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:48.340
you know it's a tough it's a tough highly competitive marketplace right now and the

01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:52.880
I think people give too much credit to the fact that it's Star Wars it doesn't matter

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:57.260
folks that's what gets that's what will draw people in for that first taste that and the

01:01:57.260 --> 01:02:00.660
fact that it's Bioware and that Knights of the Old Republic has a good history behind

01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:04.180
it that's what draws people in but it ain't gonna make people stay and I think people

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:10.540
to put way too much stock into this just because it's Star Wars it's not like everything Star

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:18.540
Wars related has always been golden cough cough Christmas special cough cough prequels

01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:27.780
right true I mean yes Star Wars is a great movie the original Disney the trilogy online

01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:32.400
game all right I just want to piggyback on this real quick for going the next story did

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:36.340
you hear about World of Warcraft because yeah not like things are all roses over there either

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:43.460
their numbers are dropping to their numbers drop to 9.1 million as reported at the expectations

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:48.580
this week well for a game that had 12 million subscribers that is supposedly at the you

01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:55.460
know is the pinnacle shining MMO a 25% loss which is what that essentially equates to

01:02:55.460 --> 01:03:00.260
gradually over the past year that is something that makes investors go oh really the game

01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:05.460
is kind of until pandaria then the biggest problem with World of Warcraft and I've said

01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:10.220
this until I am blue in the face on a horde house and Blizzard Activision pulled your

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:14.380
head out of your ass on this I swear to God this is what's holding the game back and I

01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:22.300
don't know why they can't see it the cost to enter the game is too big every other game

01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:28.360
consolidates the expansions into the original game at some point Warcraft has done it once

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:33.500
with what's going on a fifth expansion that's unacceptable it's not working I realize they

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:38.160
put the expansions on sale once in a great while I'm sorry if that sale is not sitting

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:43.500
on the target shelf you're not going to draw in new players it is time for them to consolidate

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:48.500
Wrath of the Lich King and Cataclysm into the original battle chest sell it for $19.99

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:54.260
or you will never get more subscribers so what happens if you don't have those expansions

01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:59.720
do you just not get the play you play it's a level 65 you played a 70 70 70 with because

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:04.060
burning crusade is included now they finally do when I started burning crusade wasn't well

01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:08.660
when I went back right crusade was no that was more of a reason I bought them all but

01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:12.820
I mean it sucks that you had to do that and I you know it takes a special kind of crazy

01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:19.420
to do that however I found places that sold everything for less than retail not much less

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:25.100
than retail but less than retail right I love you fries but still I mean you know if they

01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:30.220
really want to attract new subscribers $19.99 for the game but for some reason there were

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:34.700
sell $19.99 for the base game and then charge for the missus pandaria expansion or whatever

01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:38.980
but you know the reason why it's not working is people want to play with their friends

01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:42.580
and they have this whole recruit a friend program that'll get you to level 80 real quick

01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:48.780
you can't get to level 80 without buying at least the first expansion hello there's a

01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:54.300
total logic fail going on here and they need to fix it so uh rage nator in our chat room

01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:58.980
at live dot vog network dot com says well nine million plus subscribers is still respectable

01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:04.360
it is that's why this isn't quite the doom and gloom I mean show me another mmo that's

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:09.240
anywhere close to that that's not called lineage let me rephrase show me one in the states

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:16.580
that's anywhere near close to that level of hysteria that world of warcraft is um panaxium

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:20.720
in our chat room says I was going to play with a friend he saw all he had to buy we

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:29.480
played something else my point exactly exactly well here's what I did I mean I and you you

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:34.420
know this I had already had burning crusade like early on because I did play it back in

01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:39.780
the day but I played all the way up until I hit level 70 and then that night I went

01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:45.980
out and got uh wrath of the lich king and all you were doing with these expansions was

01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:51.300
paying to level you don't even I mean that's what blizzard doesn't get nobody is running

01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:57.220
the old raids anymore hello except us well because we're doing them because they're fun

01:05:57.220 --> 01:06:01.540
it's a little different and you're doing them with over leveled characters which is really

01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:10.860
fun because I like you know overkill but I mean you know I I did my I actually got one

01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:17.020
to 85 pretty much by myself except for saying hey rob help me kill this guy well it's nice

01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:21.140
that you can solo so much of the content you know yeah there is a lot of it that you can

01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:25.580
solo and you can go in and go back and do other quests low level quests and get more

01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:29.220
of the story which is what I was doing for the longest time all right I don't want to

01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:32.260
turn this into the warcraft podcast but I will close with this comment from our chat

01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:37.740
room live.vognetwork.com I wouldn't want to compete with horde house sj100 matt says blizzard

01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:42.500
needs a rude awakening I think Diablo 3 was the start but they won't change their tactics

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:47.900
without getting hit in the pocket books I agree with you with 90% of that statement

01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:53.020
that I would change the word blizzard to Activision and now I agree with that statement think

01:06:53.020 --> 01:07:01.380
about it everything started going downhill when think about it all right moving on with

01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:05.100
other gaming news hopefully this won't be downhill for Nintendo because that could be

01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:11.140
bad Nintendo needs the Wii U to be successful this holiday season and we may have some of

01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:18.460
the details thanks to an apparent GameStop leak I don't see here's the thing I'm reporting

01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:24.020
this I don't write the news you know I'm reporting this bringing it up for discussion because

01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:28.940
it's circulating all the blogs out there I kind of don't think this is news personally

01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:35.200
but I want your thought I mean here's the deal GameStop apparently got marketing materials

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:39.860
for the Wii U to talk about what games are going to come out win and it outlines all

01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:44.900
of the different publishers and when the games are coming out and for example the first party

01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:51.320
stuff from Nintendo Lego City Undercover holiday new Super Mario Brothers you holiday Ninja

01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:58.260
Gaiden three razors edge holiday Nintendo land holiday sing holiday Wii U panorama view

01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:04.740
I don't know about that one holiday game and Wario launch window Pikmin 3 launch window

01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:11.380
project P 100 launch window and Wii Fit U launch window what's that tell us not a lot

01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:15.100
it doesn't tell us dates it doesn't tell us which of those games will be available on

01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:19.680
the actual day and which ones are closer to December 25th but I mean it's not like there's

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:24.540
going to be that much time between the time this system releases and you know Christmas

01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:31.100
anyway so and I kind of was like I thought we already knew if you listen to the way they

01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:37.220
delivered that keynote I thought we already knew Pikmin 3 will be out the same day as

01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:43.340
the Wii U we know that Wii Fit U I think we had a good feeling was going to hit that same

01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:48.820
day too and we kind of knew Super Mario Brothers U where what Wii Fit U where yeah that's what

01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:52.980
it's called and new Super Mario Brothers U was coming out after that I believe Reggie

01:08:52.980 --> 01:09:00.060
said all that the only surprise of this whole thing Nintendo Land is marked holiday the

01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:03.800
only that's the only thing that surprised me because I think Nintendo Land I thought

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:08.740
was going to be like a pack-in game you want to hear something funny all right what that

01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:19.180
list that list was released on June 6th during E3 by Nintendo so these things have changed

01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:25.420
and yet oh no that list is exactly what they they released that there is no news here this

01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:31.300
is all stuff that you know they've already these are all the announced titles so but

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:37.140
yet everybody's GameStop just leaked the entire Wii U lineup no they didn't because Nintendo

01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:43.060
already leaked their fucking lineup a long time ago I can link I can link everybody to

01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:49.780
the wonderful you know because I knew I recognized that list and yep it's exact August August

01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:57.760
2nd all over the interwebs check that out yep only only I shouldn't say only in this

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:02.180
industry because this shit happens all the time but only in this industry can two month

01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:10.860
old news be made news all over again right well let me go back and tell you about things

01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:17.800
that aren't on the list because you know that's always fun since you know we we you know let's

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:21.540
get you while you're in a mood tonight I'm just saying you know we talked about this

01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:26.260
a few weeks and here's the other thing too like there's some publishers that aren't on

01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:30.900
here like Disney Interactive because there's certain times they haven't announced yet that

01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:36.780
our Wii U titles that are coming but they haven't officially announced it yet was that

01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:42.880
because they're 2013 at this point no that's that's that's how we know when we that's how

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:49.060
I think I know record Ralph's gonna be Wii U isn't it nope no epic make you do is oh

01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:53.340
yeah yeah I remember that and then of course you know also this list is not accurate too

01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:59.700
because they you know they just talked about Madden 13 and also FIFA 13 are gonna be launched

01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:04.980
titles that are gonna be on the Wii U so like this is all this right here I can tell you

01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:12.420
right now just looking at it if I were to guess I would say that this is a merchandising

01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:20.080
manual from Nintendo you know some people that may be privy to the kind of stuff like

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:24.580
that but that would be my guess where this leak came from because I think that they deliver

01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:29.260
this stuff to these stores that kind of informs them of the lineup and what kind of stuff

01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:33.080
that they can look forward to and they also give them bullet points to talk to with their

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:39.100
customers about that stuff it's basically to inform the people that work there about

01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:42.780
the titles that are coming out and stuff all things Nintendo because if you look at this

01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:47.780
they have Nintendo DSI product information Nintendo DS product information tend to 3ds

01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:55.420
product information connectivity and policies warnings and disclaimers so it's it's from

01:11:55.420 --> 01:12:00.940
Nintendo but it's just the stuff that was all the announced titles from e3 act-def in

01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:05.380
our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says the internet has really low memory spans ain't

01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:12.300
that the truth but hey it's cool that you know certain websites can uh can run with

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:17.020
it because you know hey GameStop posted it must be legit alright let's move on with some

01:12:17.020 --> 01:12:23.540
more news Dark Sakura hey I have some news guess what what it's about stuff we already

01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:27.740
know about but you know what I'm gonna talk about it because it's fucking hilarious okay

01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:34.380
EA is suing Zinga bleep bleep bleep bleep bleep um so yeah they um filed a lawsuit against

01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:41.220
Zinga saying that the Ville is a blatant ripoff of The Sims Social and it was filed on August

01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:47.180
3rd 2012 saying that they willfully and intentionally quote copied and misappropriated the original

01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:50.940
and distinctive expressive elements of The Sims Social in the violation of US copyright

01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:58.180
laws and basically it's like you know I'm gonna paraphrase as I understand it Zinga's

01:12:58.180 --> 01:13:02.580
gotten away with a lot of shit and a bunch of against a bunch of people who really can't

01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:11.260
pay to go against them we've got money let's do it bitches

01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:20.280
this is the plaintiff EA claims that the defendant willfully and rootfully copied all of the

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:29.120
assets from their popular game The Sims Social they're suing for $4,000 this is a quote that's

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:35.220
by the EA Maxis label manager Lucy Bradshaw this is a case of principle Maxis isn't the

01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:39.260
first studio to claim that Zinga copied its creative product but we are the studio that

01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:43.860
has the financial and corporate resources to stand up and do something about it infringing

01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:48.020
on a developer's copyright is not an acceptable practice in game development by calling Zinga

01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:52.580
out on this illegal practice in other words calling them on their shit we we hope to have

01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:56.660
a secondary effect of protecting the rights of other creative studios who don't have the

01:13:56.660 --> 01:14:02.900
resources to protect themselves you know what I think it's fucking hilarious I think that

01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:08.440
even if there is a you know an offer of a settlement I don't think that EA should take

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:12.900
it I think they should nail their asses to the fucking wall this is so fucking weird

01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:18.980
what's happening with this like for real think about it suddenly we're all team EA which

01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:23.180
weren't they just named the most evil company in America thanks to the internet not that

01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:26.620
long ago yet suddenly here we are we're all team EA we're just trying to redeem themselves

01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:34.260
okay and like EA hold on hold on this is where it gets better EA is championing for the little

01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:41.020
guy they're sticking up for nimble bit and all these other game the bingo blitz creators

01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:49.740
and all this what the fuck here's my thing on it first of all I mean at least they're

01:14:49.740 --> 01:15:02.780
not chick-fil-a so they're not serving up Mass Effect with a side of hate you know I

01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:07.740
was hoping we could go all night without that coming up but if it had to come up all right

01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:13.420
all right okay anyway back to the original point okay they've done things that we disagree

01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:19.920
with but overall they put out quality products right you know you're nodding so if everyone

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:26.500
can hear the rattling and Rob said then you'll know he's nodding um Rob Rob you're kind of

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:34.540
bobblehead II tonight so anyway so anyway you can I don't I'm not saying that we're

01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:41.060
completely team EA and I honestly do look at part of this as a PR stunt you know here's

01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:45.860
our perfect opportunity Zinga has been taking all this money here's our opportunity to put

01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:50.340
them down and get some good PR out of the deal and you know what if I was running a

01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:57.020
company I'd do the same shit I'd be like hey opportunity let's knock on the door but this

01:15:57.020 --> 01:16:03.340
is something that honestly a lot of good will come from as long as they stay pretty you

01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:09.820
know steady in their pursuit and nails Zinga to the wall I think they have to keep going

01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:16.660
until it's completely just until they're torn apart and then maybe nimble bit will get some

01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:26.220
money the end the end sorry I mean I wanted to go back real quick to talk about that last

01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:30.580
story we were talking about I completely forgot about Activision that was another thing that

01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:35.860
is on this list none of the Activision titles are like Skylanders Giants Call of Duty Black

01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:42.680
Ops 2 Transformers Prime there's a Cabela's expedition all right we get it it was full

01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:49.580
of crap that story on the internet just one of the have that anyway going back to the

01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:55.540
current story if you look at the comparisons it really is side by side they took a lot

01:16:55.540 --> 01:17:00.540
of the material from Sim social well the hilarious part was the one that flip-flopped where the

01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:05.860
lawyer got the damn screen wrong but I mean when they're I mean there's some pretty damning

01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:09.180
evidence in there I mean I know this is all allegedly and we're not supposed to talk about

01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:13.100
it like it's already a done deal but let's be real we're all gamers we've saw through

01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:18.540
this shit a long time ago yeah and I gotta hand it to the lawyers they're breaking it

01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:23.780
down the fucking number of pixels in the doorway is the same between the two games when you

01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:29.900
look at that you're like I the smacketh down has been brought in if you rearrange these

01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:34.220
items to look or rearrange the furniture in this room to look like the other room you

01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:41.580
overlap the fridge they're the same fridge yes yeah it's I cannot I'm sitting there with

01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:45.620
my big tub of popcorn like I want this to play out in the people's court I do I want

01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:50.660
this to be televised we will Wapner on them I want get Wapner out of retirement seriously

01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:57.100
reside over you you know that this shit is like it's pretty much okay we want you to

01:17:57.100 --> 01:18:05.340
take this game and change it enough so we don't get sued in the group look Zinga is

01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:13.100
really gonna need a moment of how are we going to survive as a company because they're being

01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:18.380
kicked in the balls left and right right now people are selling their stock but I mean

01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:22.220
we all we've all talked about we know good people that work for Zinga and I don't want

01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:25.620
like people to think like just because we think Zinga is evil means all the people that

01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:28.340
work there evil that's not the case people just do whatever job they have to do to get

01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:33.820
by but clearly management needs to go another direction and some higher-ups need to get

01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:39.020
sacked and and it's not to say that they can't pull themselves out of this because let's

01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:43.660
look at another company that was kind of and it's still kind of famous of ripping off other

01:18:43.660 --> 01:18:50.180
companies Gameloft Gameloft does a lot of like hey that looks awfully little close to

01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:55.060
Halo or hey that looks just like Call of Duty but you know what they're not they aren't

01:18:55.060 --> 01:19:00.380
literally I mean it's ripping off of a genre I guess or like a type of game but they're

01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:04.940
actually good games that's the weird thing although they aren't news so I might argue

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:11.540
that Dungeon Master Online is actually better than Diablo 3 so I'm just saying at least

01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:16.200
one of those games can be played offline you know if they can focus on making good games

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:21.540
because they are capable of making games it's just come up with your own fucking ideas for

01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:25.260
once and there's a lot of independent guys out there I mean you know you bought some

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:29.460
of them because maybe you couldn't figure out how to copy their game without it going

01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:35.460
without people going huh or maybe you know maybe if they didn't agree to you know sell

01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:40.180
you their you know IP or game or something that you were just gonna you know come up

01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:44.040
with Drawville or something like that but all right let's move on we're running long

01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:49.180
tonight so let's pick up the pace a little bit Loki all right so let's talk a little

01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:56.540
bit about the UK they've adopted the Peggy rating system hooray hooray for uniformity

01:19:56.540 --> 01:20:01.460
already duplicating it weren't they they were double ratings they were doing something but

01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:07.380
yes now the UK officially uses the Peggy system for rating its video games and it's dropped

01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:11.620
the I guess they have the British Board of Film Classification ratings guide now I remember

01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:17.420
seeing those and of course you know because of this they've you know removed the dual

01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:24.020
classification system and then also now UK retailer workers can face prosecution for

01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:30.620
selling games with a Peggy rating of you know higher than the customer obviously at 12 16

01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:36.480
or 18 to underage customers with math maximum sentence of six years wow that's that's pretty

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:45.900
uh it's pretty ridiculous six years for selling a game to a minor especially like a teen game

01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:52.540
that just seems a little harsh well I think it's more just trying to well see you know

01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:55.860
what my problem is with the rating systems is that it's discouraging parents from doing

01:20:55.860 --> 01:21:01.700
their damn job end of story you know I think that the ratings are there to should be there

01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:09.340
to inform the parent and then the parent should do their damn job yeah so this is kind of

01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:13.740
like that California law come to life like right isn't this the whole thing that the

01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:17.700
Supreme Court overturned not that long ago is now happening and am I reading this right

01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:23.500
or am I misunderstanding well yes and no but see their thing was it wasn't like tied

01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:30.060
to I don't know if it was tied to the M rated stuff but I don't know if that law I don't

01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:35.620
know UK laws too well if they do something similar to like the movies movies that are

01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:41.500
rated you know by the BBFC if it's like you know mature something and you sell it to a

01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:46.220
minor if they get the same type of infraction because if they're gonna put that in place

01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:52.100
on games I think it should be uniform across all platforms of media if you're gonna do

01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:56.740
something that drastic I think it's still kind of drastic but you know if that's the

01:21:56.740 --> 01:22:03.020
route they're gonna go as long as it's equal across you know across all the different media

01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:12.100
platforms and okay I guess it'll be interesting to see how this pans out what possible future

01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:17.740
legal challenges await yes yeah that's what always inevitably ends up happening is legal

01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:23.740
challenges fun fun I don't know anybody who will sue over this unless they somehow get

01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:31.060
roped into playing this without you know agreeing to be a willing participant in this and this

01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:35.180
is a case of some kids with a lot of free time on their hands not that that's bad it's

01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:41.580
just the interesting things that are created it's a Sega Genesis modification it's called

01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:48.060
gene zap it has a motto no leave it would be Jen's that Jen's that it's g g e n e gene

01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:53.460
Jen's app would you be Jenny's up Jenny's app Genesis well look at Jen okay Jenny's

01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:59.200
app I'll go with that Jenny's app no pity for bad players what is it it's a dog shock

01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:07.260
collar that will zap you whoever's wearing it when they screw up or take damage in certain

01:23:07.260 --> 01:23:13.580
Genesis games that have been modded oh I guess they do say it's Genesis so it's Jenna's app

01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:20.900
not jeans at my bed look like Jean the jingo their jeans may be zapped by I was created

01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:26.660
by two French guys and they modded it for games like Sonic the Hedgehog Golden Axe three

01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:34.500
mega Bomberman and so forth when your character takes damage damage in game you get zapped

01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:39.460
let's see apparently there's a video that goes with it where let's see it says go to

01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:44.780
four minutes 10 seconds in where Sonic falls into a spike pit and there will be a stream

01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:49.660
of bleeped out French cursing oh that sounds good to me let's fast forward to that part

01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:57.360
in the video let's go to four minutes it's in French but you can hear Sonic in the background

01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:15.860
here we go I'm glad to see that the kids in other countries are just as dumb as the ones

01:24:15.860 --> 01:24:23.580
here doesn't make me feel so bad that's really what it boils down to isn't it you know it's

01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:28.540
only gonna be a matter of like days before they're like hey I'll put this on your nuts

01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:34.060
because because you know if there isn't a video that has to do with you know somebody

01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:39.840
shocking myself penis time to penis how long before the Jenna's app is on his Wang it probably

01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:46.500
already happened it's just not on YouTube because frisbee in our chat room says ah lay

01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:56.660
fuck clover Nikon says sounds like an add-on for jackass the game you know it's really

01:24:56.660 --> 01:25:02.100
weird that like I kept getting shocked when I was playing the Bomberman act zero but for

01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:07.940
summer it felt like I was getting kicked in the balls repeatedly but it's just when I

01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:14.140
thought about the $60 I spent on Bomberman act zero all right one more story from dark

01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:20.580
soccer and then the release date star soccer well how about some good news for e3 they've

01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:25.940
confirmed they're staying in Los Angeles until 2015 basically like bitches this is our town

01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:33.340
you're not building shit yeah cuz the city was gonna tear down what was it the South

01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:40.740
Hall or think West West Hall and and build like a Coliseum or some shit but instead they're

01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:45.100
like they're gonna build a stadium for a football team they don't have yet yeah like I said

01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:52.860
we're building it on the roof or something shit so but yeah basically they're saying

01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:59.220
that they've generated 40 million dollars for Los Angeles in three days when they do

01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:04.060
the show so they're basically bringing in enough revenue that the city can't really

01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:10.660
afford to fuck with them so it's going to be there for another three years three more

01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:22.220
years yay three more years I ran to the kitchen but I've come in and I'm still I seem to remember

01:26:22.220 --> 01:26:26.620
something else about the story about how they've also worked out that the nearby vendors will

01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:31.580
no longer jack up their prices during the week of e3 and here's my big question does

01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:39.060
that include parking it should we have to park the last time that's right that one time

01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:43.900
we went we took oh my gosh we parked like literally like it was at least five blocks

01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:48.520
away at least ten blocks away but it was relatively cheap parking I think we only paid five bucks

01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:53.140
to park whereas if you park across the street the convention center it's like 50 it's crazy

01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:59.360
times but anyway um I think basically what ended up happening here is that LA was like

01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:04.300
please don't leave you do so much for the economy you're going to help build this damn

01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:10.880
arena please don't leave we'll do anything just stay because the year that e4 all happened

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:16.740
and you know LA lost that money it it was it was a little kick in the butt yeah it was

01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:21.700
they learned and one could argue they may be building that new stadium to bid for I've

01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:26.820
heard rumors LA is supposed to be bidding for another Olympic Games that's a mistake

01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:33.260
that ends up putting such an economic cripple on the town that um hosts it it depends if

01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:39.680
you look historically when LA did it it actually didn't I don't know how I'm sure Bobby could

01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:45.060
answer how it worked for Atlanta but I think like when LA did it it was fine it was actually

01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:51.140
so was plunged into debt mm-hmm Beijing was plunged into debt almost anywhere that's hosted

01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:55.220
it has been plunged into debt afterwards with just the fallout from what's going on afterwards

01:27:55.220 --> 01:27:59.880
but it's the Olympics and not to mention that they have to kick out residents to build whatever

01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:03.320
facilities are there the one in Greece still wasn't finished while the games were going

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:11.060
on same Bobby clarifies Atlanta didn't lose money at all in the games all right but it

01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:17.580
was commercialized all to hell yeah when I went to Vancouver in 2006 the Olympic Games

01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:21.700
were being shoved down my throat not that it's a bad thing Olympics are fun especially

01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:27.020
I prefer the Winter Olympics personally but anyway let's not talk about things that are

01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:30.580
gonna be happening in the year 2020 let's talk about next week and video games that

01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:35.860
are coming out to your nearby stores we'll start with the u.s. Loki well I hope you like

01:28:35.860 --> 01:28:40.080
games that feature persona characters fighting each other because that's all that's coming

01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:45.260
out this week persona for arena on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 remember it's not region

01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:52.460
free not region free yeah we talked a couple weeks ago that's a good thing for the u.s.

01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:56.820
that's a good thing for Japan it's not a good thing speaking of Japan let's talk about their

01:28:56.820 --> 01:29:02.380
release dates if that's all Loki's got on the Xbox 360 this week sniper elite v2 comes

01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:07.420
out from 505 games and that's the only release on August the 9th going to the PlayStation

01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:12.660
3 that's it to sniper elite v2 so I guess it's kind of a similar story in Japan this

01:29:12.660 --> 01:29:18.580
week going to the handhelds though wow there's nothing on the 3ds that kind of surprises

01:29:18.580 --> 01:29:23.940
me there ain't anything listed until the 23rd on the 3ds what a slow period holidays going

01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:28.740
on I don't know let me look at the Vita real quick see if there's anything big there there's

01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:35.240
a couple games there there's ginsai shogi kaiutendo Tofu Rajin comes out this week as

01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:39.880
well as Orgar rhythm comes out I wonder if that's the same thing as the sound shapes

01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:42.900
game that's coming out here on the feet isn't that this week by the way you might have missed

01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:46.340
that I think sound shapes is out this week I think that's probably that's a digital on

01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:51.180
there really oh that could be it is no this title actually looks a little different this

01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:56.100
is it's actually not a rhythm game even though that's in the or maybe it is it is it looks

01:29:56.100 --> 01:30:00.140
sound shapes is it looks like Peekman to me this you know this game this Orgar rhythm

01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:05.620
looks like a it's an action game they're calling it yeah hit a button when the queue falls

01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:09.340
hmm interesting yeah it is kind of a music game but it looks like music infused with

01:30:09.340 --> 01:30:15.820
Pikmin kind of looks interesting that's it oh Akuma JP in the chat room next week is

01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:21.380
Obon holiday I hope I said that right which one Obon oh yeah I thought there was a holiday

01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:26.060
coming up around this time of year so gotcha I mean it could just be for the holiday could

01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:33.060
be so in the UK there's a few releases on the 7th is Unmechanical on the 8th is Hero

01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:41.100
Academy and Hybrid and that's it but a few things a few a few just a few a bit a bit

01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:46.140
a few more stories and then the classic game of the week is coming at you but first Loki

01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:54.300
all right so Minecraft there's some interesting things with that first starting off 1.31 update

01:30:54.300 --> 01:31:01.820
has come out and what you can get with that of course now they've merged single players

01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:08.860
and multiplayer on so they have a unified mode and then also they've added a few things

01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:19.380
including a chest for the ender chest as well as writable books and you can trade now they've

01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:30.020
added trip wires which sounds awesome large biomes world type also some cocoa beans to

01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:39.460
the jungles emeralds and emerald blocks and emerald ore I guess a bonus chest option which

01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:44.540
allows people to have like some stuff starting off so you spawn with the chest with like

01:31:44.540 --> 01:31:54.100
a few basic tools nearby which is kind of cool also let's see just some some other bug

01:31:54.100 --> 01:32:02.020
fixes like mobs being able to clip through walls stuff like that so that's kind of cool

01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:07.940
and then to go along with that minecon 2012 has been announced and it's going to be going

01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:16.620
to Disneyland Paris in November so I don't mind con Disneyland Paris November 24th and

01:32:16.620 --> 01:32:27.700
25th I found something for you in Japan town by the way okay a Minecraft mask a big foam

01:32:27.700 --> 01:32:36.820
mask of the dude Steve I guess or a game that creeper mask too and the axe the pickaxe awesome

01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:41.460
all right well I doubt you found any memorabilia for this game because it's several years old

01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:49.040
but it's coming back do you remember imagine 1994 and remember Wolfenstein 3d well there

01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:55.260
was a game that came out not long after Wolfenstein 3d called rise of the triad rise of the triad

01:32:55.260 --> 01:33:00.860
is coming back y'all it's coming on unreal engine 3 apogee software announced this at

01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:06.100
quake con over the weekend this was in rumor status earlier in the week but literally earlier

01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:12.460
today it was confirmed in a trailer is out right now the developers interceptor software

01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:18.380
and the original rise of the triad level designer joe siegler is one of the members pretty awesome

01:33:18.380 --> 01:33:23.640
single player of course online multiplayer and a level editor it looks pretty awesome

01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:29.420
via steamworks you'll be able to share stuff yeah sounds pretty cool so all of the crazy

01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:37.700
weapons and and dog mode so this is look definitely for the fans the gameplay and it looked pretty

01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:41.580
awesome because I wasn't really a fan of rise of the triad I mean I played it a few times

01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:46.500
a shareware game but it looks pretty cool because it's kind of like a hybrid between

01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:54.980
like you know like a wolfenstein or Duke Nukem but fast like like the unreal games unreal

01:33:54.980 --> 01:34:00.660
term and stuff so it looked kind of cool like a lot of the fast gameplay and just you know

01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:04.660
with that kind of setting I could dig that a lot of folks in our chat room are getting

01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:11.020
excited DDR dollar bill yeah I'm a bit disappointed that there's not a console version it's only

01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:16.860
PC right now if they're doing all the steamworks and all that I can see it I mean I realized

01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:24.240
PlayStation was supposed to do the steam integration but only one game has done it so all right

01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:29.040
well let's go back to a time maybe perhaps even before 1994 actually I have no idea when

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:34.500
this games weeks game came out but dark soccer will clarify for that clarify that for us

01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:38.860
right now it's a little older than that a little older newer sorry a little newer all

01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:42.620
right every week dark soccer likes to jump into the classic gaming vault and find a classic

01:34:42.620 --> 01:34:49.220
video game that she thinks hey you little brats play this game or suffer my wrath dark

01:34:49.220 --> 01:34:57.060
soccer what is the classic game of the week don't patch which is awesome and very hard

01:34:57.060 --> 01:35:06.140
don't patchy is one of the actually play the screen play the opening screen because I can

01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:09.580
never say it quite right I love the way the guy says it oh my bad hold on yeah and then

01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:28.700
after that you can fast forward okay if that little voiceovers yeah just cuz I can never

01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:34.420
say it like that don't punch you know anyway um it's made by cave and published by Atlas

01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:41.860
in 1995 yes for anyone who knows the term cave shooter this pretty much started it um

01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:46.780
it was the first game that was developed by cave in the second on their first generation

01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:54.100
arcade hardware the first was power instinct 2 the title means leader B but it's also an

01:35:54.100 --> 01:36:01.540
onomatopoeia as in the sound of firing guns so it is like I said one of the first bullet

01:36:01.540 --> 01:36:11.540
hell games so basically you play as a pilot whose mission is to just survive an 8 years

01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:18.260
long training mission so that you can become one of the don't patchy squadron so basically

01:36:18.260 --> 01:36:23.780
you have you're progressing through their training period so you have two modes of fire

01:36:23.780 --> 01:36:28.900
you have a shot fire one but holding it down you have a concentrated vertical beam but

01:36:28.900 --> 01:36:34.420
it slows down your ship like a whole freaking lot you have three different kinds of aircraft

01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:39.380
you have type a which is the red one that has a narrow stream of shots type b which

01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:45.380
is green um that's a helicopter that has main guns forward and then side guns that rotate

01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:49.300
um 90 degrees from forward when you're moving horizontally and then type c which is the

01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:54.420
blue or black one um that has a wide three-way spread shot which honestly type c is my favorite

01:36:54.420 --> 01:36:58.900
just saying you've got your regular shots where you just tap the button to fire and

01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:01.940
then you if you hold your shoot button you have your laser and then you have a spread

01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:09.620
bomb if you hit the bomb button um you also have um a laser bomb that if you press your

01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:16.500
bomb while you're holding the laser then it does a lot more damage but it's narrower so

01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:21.940
you've got five different areas and you can loop them um if you complete them the second

01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:27.860
loop has the same areas um the same patterns but it's a denser bullet so basically it really

01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:32.740
does turn into the bullet hell and if you get the final boss in the second loop you

01:37:32.740 --> 01:37:39.780
have a secret area where you meet the big boss of the game the hutchy which is a b

01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:45.860
um so basically it's other than that though it's pretty much a shooter you can get your

01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:52.420
power increases you can get your bomb increases and mp um you can pick it up after you've

01:37:52.420 --> 01:38:00.260
continued so it returns all of your powers to full strength um basically you know it scores

01:38:00.260 --> 01:38:07.780
um you get more additional points for uh for your bombs uh you get um depending on how

01:38:07.780 --> 01:38:12.980
many bombs you have left you have you know however many for uh different items that you've

01:38:12.980 --> 01:38:18.100
collected and then if you complete the second loop on one credit you get a million points

01:38:18.100 --> 01:38:23.140
for um however many fighters you have left in your inventory you know your leftovers

01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:28.980
so that's pretty much it i mean this was the game that started the whole bullet hell

01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:37.780
uh series of games and it did have a sequel doh don't watch which um is out on um iphone

01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:43.460
you can play it on the iphone but this but it probably sucks let's be real well i don't know

01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:52.020
espa gabagabaluta which i can never say right um did uh did perform very well i actually plan on

01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:55.380
buying the doh don't patchy resolution uh revolution wasn't it called or

01:38:55.380 --> 01:39:00.500
resurrection or whatever the crap um the game uh don't patchy is out on saturn and it is a

01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:06.020
game that's on my list to buy awesome freaking game all right there it is your classic game

01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:08.020
of the week don't punch don't punch

01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:14.740
bullet hell vertical you're not even getting into the bullet hell part of it this is still

01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:19.700
like this this looks easy yeah it's i can make it through the first two levels of don't patchy

01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:23.220
no problem forward later in the video here see what happens yeah there you're getting a little

01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:27.700
bit more into the bullet hell there you go but the second playthrough uh-uh no i can't do it

01:39:28.580 --> 01:39:32.660
and i i ended up i end up getting like kind of dizzy playing bullet hill games see that

01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:38.420
that's where you get into it nice yeah all right i know zether is a fan of the uh bullet hell

01:39:38.420 --> 01:39:42.740
shooters he said this one is one of his favorites it's one of my favorite games too zether also

01:39:42.740 --> 01:39:48.500
clarifies the doh don't patchy iphone ports are of the newer games resurrection and die flukatsu

01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:56.500
okay so but um i i am not good at bullet hell games i'm just gonna go and say this

01:39:57.060 --> 01:40:01.060
but i love them and i like she doesn't dodge bullets she shoots them

01:40:01.060 --> 01:40:06.180
well that's kind of why i like ikoruga because you can um absorb the ones that makes it a little

01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:12.180
bit easier to get through the mass but i freaking played the crap out of um espaluta on my phone

01:40:12.180 --> 01:40:17.300
so just saying all right there it is your classic game of the week we're gonna take a break kids

01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:21.780
don't go anywhere when we come back rapid fire news the frugal question of the week your calls

01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:28.020
your emails and some more news including a steam decision that may prove to be not too popular but

01:40:28.020 --> 01:40:33.060
seems to be popular with a lot of game makers and game publishers right now we'll be back after a

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:43.860
quick break with more of orange lounge radio don't go anywhere welcome back everybody to orange

01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:50.660
lounge radio episode 468 in progress august the 5th of 2012 live at the voice of geeks network

01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:54.980
vog network.com all right loki what was this you were bringing up during the break just you were

01:40:54.980 --> 01:41:01.540
gonna tell it on air anyway so go ahead i was gonna send the ernie ernest klein um and message

01:41:01.540 --> 01:41:10.340
on twitter because basically um you know the world record for black tiger is only possible

01:41:10.340 --> 01:41:19.140
on this machine at um what do they call it it's a fun spot it's the one that the world record was

01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:23.620
accomplished that's the huge that's the huge classic game arcade yeah that's one of the movies

01:41:23.620 --> 01:41:29.780
and all that shit the huge arcade um their people have already beat it on the actual machine it's

01:41:29.780 --> 01:41:35.700
just they haven't been verified by twin galaxies um but the reason why they're able to beat it and

01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:41.380
even the guy one of the guys that um posted it he's all it's because the last dragon gives you

01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:48.740
one million points versus what black tiger does he's like right here and the guy um says the board

01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:53.220
at fun spot plays like black dragon which gives out one million for the last dragon actually i

01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:57.860
think it plays identical to black dragon on the second easiest difficulty it says black tiger

01:41:57.860 --> 01:42:02.100
and though for sure it's all in english i just figured i'd push it higher at this fun spot

01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:10.500
this morning i think i scored um 2.7 million that was my highest it's so basically it's impossible

01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:17.620
to hit that score unless you go to fun spot so fuck that shit is what i gotta say and just because

01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:22.420
twin galaxies doesn't want to cop up to the fact that oh hey you know we didn't really investigate

01:42:22.420 --> 01:42:26.580
this board and just because the guy that ref that shit fucking doesn't know anything about black

01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:31.540
tiger and maybe isn't aware of the fact that you can grind your score up by running through the

01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:36.500
game really fast and at the end you're you know basically taking out zombies that keep respawning

01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:40.820
and that's how you get your score up that is well known in the community that plays black tiger even

01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:45.060
for me who doesn't know anything about black tiger but oh just all of a sudden got into the community

01:42:45.060 --> 01:42:50.260
about it so that needs to be pointed out so that they can fix this shit because i would like to

01:42:50.260 --> 01:42:54.260
legitimately have a high score in that game but i can't if the game is fucking modded

01:42:58.260 --> 01:42:59.460
this is the plaintiff

01:43:01.780 --> 01:43:08.260
he goes by loki on a podcast that nobody listens to he claims that the defendants a bunch of

01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:15.060
fucking fucktards who don't know how to run a contest were negligent he's suing for a 12 pack

01:43:15.060 --> 01:43:23.300
of diet pepsi it's legit the guy that beat the score is a familiar with black tiger and that's

01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:29.780
how he said it scored so i don't understand why between galaxies can go and claim go investigate

01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:35.220
it then go go have someone play that game because obviously it's it's someone's very easily able to

01:43:35.220 --> 01:43:39.780
you know beat that high score have them play the game and watch how it scores or have them you

01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:45.060
know verify i'm so over this i know i'm just like but yet you guys we don't we don't check the

01:44:02.260 --> 01:44:14.180
uh i need to filet this episode of orange lounge radio i did see though the best ever take on that

01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:20.260
for marketing purpose the chick on chick-fil-a it was a double chicken breast all right look

01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:25.620
we're gonna get into rapid fire news hey bradley how you doing our special guest here in studio

01:44:25.620 --> 01:44:30.020
in this historic night how you hanging in there i'm all right i apologize for loki's behavior

01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:35.540
tonight and the constant barrage of references on things we we come to sunday nights at orange

01:44:35.540 --> 01:44:40.180
launch radio to escape from what are you playing on your 3ds over there playing mole mania right

01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:44.820
now what mole mania mole mania oh i thought i said mall mania at first i'm like what the

01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:53.380
hell game is that why are you playing it all right how is it how's the game is that an old

01:44:53.380 --> 01:44:57.460
school game boy game or like a new 3ds game it's an old school game boy game they set it on a

01:44:57.460 --> 01:45:02.980
virtual console uh what other virtual console games you own on that thing over there uh i

01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:09.380
think the only thing i have is dragon crystal which is a game gear game nice and of course

01:45:09.380 --> 01:45:15.300
the other like ambassador games stuff like that but i have super mario land with the awesome like

01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:20.500
random ass egyptian theme in the dungeons for no particular reason just that the games i think the

01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:24.420
games weren't even designed by the same mario team yeah maybe yeah i remember playing that

01:45:24.420 --> 01:45:31.780
on the original game boy but i never have gotten on the on 3ds all right let's move on and try to

01:45:31.780 --> 01:45:38.580
tackle some rapid fire news where we're going to tackle the news as quickly as possible logi

01:45:41.140 --> 01:45:45.060
i'll wait for the mic there um so anyways let's talk a little bit about

01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:52.900
nba 2k 13 and apparently now i see i don't even know why this is a thing but apparently

01:45:52.900 --> 01:45:59.140
jz is going to be executive producing the game i don't know if that changes your opinion on whether

01:45:59.140 --> 01:46:06.660
you should buy that game or not but yeah so he's gonna have i guess he's doing some of the uh

01:46:07.780 --> 01:46:13.460
picking up the soundtrack maybe um he's got a bunch of his songs in there and uh

01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:20.020
it looks like a lot of other you know hip-hop artists in there as well you know actually i

01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:24.580
think it's kind of a clever move like i know some of y'all might be skeptical about it but

01:46:24.580 --> 01:46:31.940
i it's star power and it's it's a big star with a lot of power and i think for for those two worlds

01:46:31.940 --> 01:46:36.340
to kind of collide the music world and the gaming world i think there's definitely a lot of people

01:46:36.340 --> 01:46:42.740
that are gonna they're gonna turn their head a little closer at nba 2k 13 because jz's involvement

01:46:42.740 --> 01:46:47.940
i mean it's just it's just it's stories like this they're us would we talk about this otherwise

01:46:47.940 --> 01:46:53.540
probably not it's that whole thing where that's that's probably good for him being props to them

01:46:53.540 --> 01:46:58.660
for including daft punk around the world that's kind of cool yeah and uh there's a justice song

01:46:58.660 --> 01:47:04.180
in there um so i think i'm pretty sure i mean jz is married to beyonce for heaven's sake i mean

01:47:04.180 --> 01:47:11.780
i'm pretty sure he's pretty diverse with his music likes all right so uh next is uh playstation all

01:47:11.780 --> 01:47:16.580
stars that's going to be getting a public beta this fall of course you know if you're a subscriber

01:47:16.580 --> 01:47:21.700
to playstation plus you're gonna be able to get into it earlier um but they're gonna start off

01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:28.820
by sending some codes as well pretty soon um i guess uh they were a little disappointed about

01:47:28.820 --> 01:47:35.220
all the characters being leaked out uh chan park of superbot entertainment is so that was unexpected

01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:44.260
and unintended no shit um so yes apparently they're gonna make um some more official character

01:47:44.260 --> 01:47:48.980
announcements they're probably included in those ones that they've already leaked out uh august 15

01:47:48.980 --> 01:47:55.700
during uh gamescom and last but not least i'm glad to see there's some marketing going on for

01:47:55.700 --> 01:48:03.060
grand theft auto 5 uh viral marketing now including a website um for the epsilon program it's kind of

01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:08.660
a spoof of Scientology and was also referenced in grand theft auto san andreas now the epsilon

01:48:08.660 --> 01:48:15.380
program website is available and you can check it out um or at least there's a twitter going along

01:48:15.380 --> 01:48:26.020
with it ebsol ebsolism today this is a twitter account and um yeah the religion i guess is called

01:48:26.020 --> 01:48:36.900
a kiff mult kiff lom neat yeah epsilonprogram.com you can go check it out and they've got got some

01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:43.620
stuff there are you getting excited are you getting hyped all this grand theft auto 5 stuff

01:48:43.620 --> 01:48:47.060
well there's not really much grand theft auto 5 stuff right now in fact that was they had the whole

01:48:47.940 --> 01:48:54.820
financial um you know uh conferencing that they were um talking about you know all the different

01:48:54.820 --> 01:48:59.060
games and how they were doing and everything and grand theft auto 5 wasn't even really mentioned

01:48:59.060 --> 01:49:04.580
too much so it's kind of neat that they're gonna have some stuff i'm hoping that we get some out

01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:08.900
of gamescom i'd like to see something but i'm guessing that this game's probably not coming

01:49:08.900 --> 01:49:16.340
until at least you know april of next year stan in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says if

01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:19.540
anyone gets a beta code for all stars battle royale and you don't want it i'd be happy to

01:49:19.540 --> 01:49:28.100
take it off your hands uh ratchet tag speculating on the jz nba 2k13 blue ivy will be in it no way

01:49:28.100 --> 01:49:34.260
jose that baby's gonna be like michael jackson's kids back when they were young like they they had

01:49:34.260 --> 01:49:39.140
to go out and like wear the face covering so that the media couldn't get pictures that's what will

01:49:39.140 --> 01:49:46.500
happen all right moving on to some other rapid fire news doom 3 is getting a re-release as we've

01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:51.460
already talked about before doom 3 bfg edition some news coming out of quake con there is going

01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:57.700
to be an extra lost mission that will be in the hd remaster don't know what the lost mission entails

01:49:57.700 --> 01:50:02.900
but not too surprising usually these types of remasters and remakes get some type of extra bonus

01:50:02.900 --> 01:50:07.940
thing so something that was originally on the cutting room floor makes a lot of sense so it

01:50:07.940 --> 01:50:12.420
comes out this october if you miss doom 3 the first time around or you want to play it again

01:50:13.700 --> 01:50:20.500
one game i can't understand why people play again and again but it's like it's like torture and this

01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:24.100
is the type of game that i would have expected loki would have to beat to win a delorean you

01:50:24.100 --> 01:50:31.380
ever played q op i've played co-op i am i've been dying to download this because i really want to

01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:36.900
shoot some pigeons well actually yeah i don't it's it's not q q i call it q op is it all right quap

01:50:37.540 --> 01:50:42.820
quap has this that's not the game i want to report on tonight although i think that shit's hilarious

01:50:43.380 --> 01:50:52.900
it's a new game called clop what is clop it's quap but with a unicorn as the star as opposed

01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:58.180
to an athlete right like the original is like an athlete now if you've never played quap um

01:50:58.180 --> 01:51:03.220
what god how the hell do you describe it it's like a running simulation but like remember

01:51:03.220 --> 01:51:08.020
like track and field by konami back in the 80s in the arcade running was simulated by hitting

01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:12.260
the buttons as fast as you can like right and on the old school nes games and the power pad run

01:51:12.260 --> 01:51:20.100
as fast as you can q op is actually about like bend the knee bend the ankle and it's four buttons

01:51:20.100 --> 01:51:26.580
to control it but it's like all like super physics and stuff so now there is clop and it is by the

01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:32.100
maker of quap and gurp and whatever other games they've come out with clop is a four-legged

01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:41.700
unicorn uh that you uh use h j k and l to control the unicorn and in this one good luck getting up

01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:53.380
hills that's the game look you should have had to play i tried playing clop and i kept laughing

01:51:53.380 --> 01:51:58.660
it was fun and i've never played it but you haven't played clop yeah god i i'm worried where

01:51:58.660 --> 01:52:04.660
this is going i've never played it okay clop if you um you control each foot of the horse okay

01:52:04.660 --> 01:52:12.420
and if you happen to use the front feet you unlock lame horse mode where the back feet get broken and

01:52:12.420 --> 01:52:18.340
you have to crawl with the front this sounds fantastic and there's like this weird justin

01:52:18.340 --> 01:52:23.700
bieber looking character that keeps making fun of you when you die or not even necessarily die but

01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:27.860
you're like that's just rude slowly tip over backwards and it's kind of funny that's just

01:52:27.860 --> 01:52:32.340
rude justin bieber comes out makes fun of you that's like it looks like zach efron or justin

01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:37.860
bieber i mean it's just it's weird uh ratchet tag in our chat room says unicorns make everything

01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:42.660
better exactly and that's exactly what this game is all about does it fart rainbows it might

01:52:42.660 --> 01:52:49.540
they've only won a unicorn that farts rainbows well maybe you can find the rainbow farting special

01:52:49.540 --> 01:52:55.380
item in the world of warcraft arcade cabinet that is apparently on its way out in china uh there's

01:52:55.380 --> 01:53:00.500
a china digital entertainment expo going on right now and apparently there is a world of warcraft

01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:06.580
arcade machine on its way uh league of legends starcraft 2 and some other stuff as well and yeah

01:53:06.580 --> 01:53:11.540
they show pictures of people playing in an arcade style machine now don't think like i'm not talking

01:53:11.540 --> 01:53:16.900
like it's a special arcade release of the game but you gotta remember the arcades in asia still very

01:53:16.900 --> 01:53:22.340
much a thriving community things like cyber cafes and things that never took off here would do much

01:53:22.340 --> 01:53:25.540
better in these other countries so it's really about the kind of the community and getting

01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:29.380
together so the fact that they're putting these games in arcade style cabinets really not a

01:53:29.380 --> 01:53:34.740
surprise at all especially if you look at counter strike neo look at that that's a very pretty

01:53:34.740 --> 01:53:40.340
machine all these little sit down cabinets people playing counter strike so interesting but not

01:53:40.340 --> 01:53:44.740
something you're going to see over here anytime soon i'm sure that dark soccer are we able to get

01:53:44.740 --> 01:53:51.940
those yes cool what's up well um how about first off sonic and all stars racing transformed has

01:53:51.940 --> 01:53:58.740
bonus edition with an outrun track and metal sonic oh and it has an in-game emoticon sticker

01:53:58.740 --> 01:54:02.580
pack but will it have magical sound shower i don't care because it has the opa opa

01:54:02.580 --> 01:54:15.460
and then rock smith it's uh getting a base mode on uh august 14th looks like so uh it will have

01:54:15.460 --> 01:54:21.940
a basis that can improve their skills with um two finger plucking slapping and popping sounds very

01:54:22.740 --> 01:54:27.780
dirty but it also has base technique challenges tutorial videos and mini games

01:54:27.780 --> 01:54:35.700
so lots of base stuff because base is awesome i am partial to the base and then how about this for

01:54:35.700 --> 01:54:44.660
quake con steam's having a sale bethesda games are cheap it's um the quake con bundle that's

01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:51.780
going to have uh 20 games and again i'm reading this off of a british site so 300 pounds worth

01:54:51.780 --> 01:54:59.700
for 70 pounds for the for the lot of it and today is elder scrolls day um then this is of course as

01:54:59.700 --> 01:55:06.420
of sunday where you can get the elder scrolls collection for 47 percent off morrowind for uh

01:55:06.420 --> 01:55:13.140
66 percent off and oblivion for 66 percent off skyrim will be 50 percent off so this is your

01:55:13.140 --> 01:55:19.780
chance to get it on the cheap and there's also going to be a quake con of sale happening in the

01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:27.300
app store so there you go nice all right let's move on and every week we do a segment here called

01:55:27.300 --> 01:55:33.700
the frugal question of the week take facebook take google put it together you get frugal

01:55:35.860 --> 01:55:40.260
and we ask a question of our facebook and google plus communities every week and read some of the

01:55:40.260 --> 01:55:45.940
answers here on the show and to poll our folks in studios as well as to their thoughts on this

01:55:45.940 --> 01:55:51.300
question we'll start with google plus tonight here's the question an article on vog earlier

01:55:51.300 --> 01:55:54.900
this week i hope y'all are reading the articles at vog i know we don't we haven't been publishing

01:55:54.900 --> 01:55:58.660
a lot but we've been trying to get some stuff out there and there was a good one this week from alan

01:55:59.780 --> 01:56:04.020
and i'm not just saying that because he lives here but he wrote a good article about minecraft and

01:56:04.020 --> 01:56:08.660
kind of what made him really like the game the third try you know the first time he played

01:56:08.660 --> 01:56:12.900
minecraft he was like what the hell is this shit but you know the second second time a little more

01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:17.540
third time finally found fell in love with it so our question to the frugals this week is has

01:56:17.540 --> 01:56:22.180
there ever been a game that you really didn't like the first time you played it only to come

01:56:22.180 --> 01:56:27.380
back a second or third or fourth time and fall in love with it what do you think caused the change

01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:32.500
in your opinion so i'm sure some of us here in studio can think of games like this but

01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:36.580
what is the game we'll get around here in a minute all right let's start with panaxium on

01:56:36.580 --> 01:56:41.540
google plus for me it was the civilization franchise i just couldn't get into it but then

01:56:41.540 --> 01:56:47.140
i started downloading all the awesome mods for civ 4 and that changed everything fantasy world

01:56:47.140 --> 01:56:54.740
yes please sci-fi colonization hell yeah so lots uh redertainment says yes in fact i'll be playing

01:56:54.740 --> 01:57:00.180
it when this show airs dragon age origins i used to not be into high fantasy at all then game of

01:57:00.180 --> 01:57:05.940
thrones came out now i'm reconsidering all high fantasy properties including dragon age i might

01:57:05.940 --> 01:57:10.740
even watch lord of the rings again and this time not fall asleep during it very interesting so it's

01:57:10.740 --> 01:57:16.580
kind of like asleep reading it you know what i don't when i saw a movie in the theater and it's

01:57:16.580 --> 01:57:20.980
one of my favorite movies this is a couple years ago uh stardust you ever seen that movie it's i

01:57:20.980 --> 01:57:27.060
love that movie it's so good i have it on hd dvd yeah it's based on yeah me too and blu-ray it's

01:57:27.060 --> 01:57:32.020
based on the neil gaiman novel and i thought the the uh movie turned out great michelle pfeiffer

01:57:32.020 --> 01:57:37.940
is great and all that but um when i came home from watching the movie i suddenly wanted to play elder

01:57:37.940 --> 01:57:43.860
scrolls oblivion like it's kind of weird how but that's the same type of thing that redertainment

01:57:43.860 --> 01:57:47.700
is talking about watching game of thrones made him want to play dragon age origins chair of swords

01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:57.460
this weird kind of for the record reading tolkan is gonna take it's gonna take patience

01:57:58.340 --> 01:58:01.540
good stories as long as you get past the descriptions of the countryside

01:58:01.540 --> 01:58:07.940
just saying how about that whole hobbit going into three movies i'm excited i i read the

01:58:07.940 --> 01:58:11.940

01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:39.860
raiding or something tonight this answer might surprise you mass effect no joke way back when

01:58:39.860 --> 01:58:44.020
the first game was on xbox 360 i gave it a go because of all the things people were saying

01:58:44.020 --> 01:58:48.740
i didn't make it past eden prime before i decided it was dumb years later i got a free copy of two

01:58:48.740 --> 01:58:53.060
on pc for buying dragon age 2 so i gave it a go and thought it was pretty eh i didn't even get

01:58:53.060 --> 01:58:57.300
much farther than the opening escape from the server of space before i just quit caring a short

01:58:57.300 --> 01:59:01.300
time later i picked up the first game because i figured i should have the collection on pc for

01:59:01.300 --> 01:59:05.940
some reason i made it past eden prime this time but again didn't care and then the trailers for

01:59:05.940 --> 01:59:10.100
mass effect 3 came out and i thought it looked so cool i forced myself to get in the first game and

01:59:10.100 --> 01:59:15.300
something just clicked it was amazing and i couldn't stop playing and then things made much

01:59:15.300 --> 01:59:20.260
more sense in two it was fantastic and that's how i came to love the greatest game series ever so

01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:27.700
effect uh let's see osfer replied and said this happened to me with league of legends i initially

01:59:27.700 --> 01:59:31.860
tried it and just couldn't get into the game at all but i also wasn't too sure what i was doing

01:59:31.860 --> 01:59:35.620
after coming back to it and having friends show me what to do i liked it a little more but still

01:59:35.620 --> 01:59:43.300
wasn't hooked until i found a character that i really liked to play uh going to mary says uh

01:59:43.300 --> 01:59:48.500
wow world of warcraft i played my warlock up to level 30 something but still really had no freaking

01:59:48.500 --> 01:59:52.660
clue what i was doing and ended up just leaving it for a year maybe six months i don't know whatever

01:59:52.660 --> 01:59:58.020
it was when i came back i got up to max level got my warlock super special level 60 mount at level

01:59:58.020 --> 02:00:03.700
70 thanks to my old oov buddies for helping out with that and still had never run a real instance

02:00:03.700 --> 02:00:07.700
did some karazhan with the guild and ended up learning to actually raid yay for second chances

02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:13.860
and wow cody t replies it would probably have to be the call of duty games i tried to play him a

02:00:13.860 --> 02:00:17.780
long time ago and never really understood why people thought they were so fun until i had a

02:00:17.780 --> 02:00:22.340
child and didn't get as much time to play video games and those games multiplayer wise are easy

02:00:22.340 --> 02:00:27.140
to pick up and play for five or ten minutes and another is borderlands for the same reason i'm not

02:00:27.140 --> 02:00:34.020
that good of fps games lol reginator says this may be a cop-out answer but i'd have to say the final

02:00:34.020 --> 02:00:39.300
fantasy series i know it's kind of broad i had the original on the nes as a kid which is why parents

02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:42.980
bought for me at the time i didn't really appreciate the game or what would eventually

02:00:42.980 --> 02:00:47.700
become a long-running series it wasn't until i saw commercials for final fantasy 7 and eventually

02:00:47.700 --> 02:00:53.460
played it when i finally found love and appreciation for the final fantasy series uh let's see

02:00:53.460 --> 02:00:58.260
degenerate johnny says too human fits the bill when i first rented the game i was displeased

02:00:58.260 --> 02:01:02.500
because i wasn't used to the second analog stick as a form of movement and attack rather than

02:01:02.500 --> 02:01:06.660
camera control for the first time i found myself agreeing with popular reviewers and i took the

02:01:06.660 --> 02:01:11.460
game back to gamefly i rented the game again to help my niece with her homework she was studying

02:01:11.460 --> 02:01:15.940
norse mythology and entertainment i finally got used to the controls but still got ticked off

02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:20.100
after getting the achievement for dying a hundred times we should be able to remove those from our

02:01:20.100 --> 02:01:24.180
gamer score i finally bought the game when some friends of mine invited me to play with them in

02:01:24.180 --> 02:01:29.060
co-op i had the time of my life when we were playing and i can see the ingenuity that silicon

02:01:29.060 --> 02:01:33.860
knights was trying to accomplish with too human ever since then we get together and play a campaign

02:01:33.860 --> 02:01:38.980
or two over drinks once you get past the controls the game is quite enjoyable just don't play alone

02:01:39.860 --> 02:01:44.340
so there you go some answers from our facebook community there are more i'm sorry i didn't get

02:01:44.340 --> 02:01:49.060
to read all of them but check them out at facebook.com orange lounge radio let's quickly

02:01:49.060 --> 02:01:53.540
go around the room and see what you guys think games you didn't love the first time but you fell

02:01:53.540 --> 02:01:59.700
in love the second or third time dark sakura wow yeah easy for you i know well moving off of wow

02:01:59.700 --> 02:02:05.220
because honestly it was really until they tweaked the gameplay to where i liked it um i'm actually

02:02:05.220 --> 02:02:09.620
going to add mass effect on the list because i'd watch dan play through it at first and i was like

02:02:09.620 --> 02:02:13.860
oh this is kind of boring first person shooters make me sick blah blah blah blah blah and honestly

02:02:13.860 --> 02:02:19.060
i had a hard time getting into it on xbox until i started playing on pc and then boom all the

02:02:19.060 --> 02:02:21.540
way through the game all the way through the second one all the way through the third one

02:02:21.540 --> 02:02:26.500
i beat all three games in the span of a month just saying and i'm still playing mass effect three

02:02:26.500 --> 02:02:33.860
again uh loki call of duty modern warfare i didn't like it the first time i played it what clicked

02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:41.540
for you i don't know something uh for me most of mine have already been said believe it or not

02:02:41.540 --> 02:02:45.380
world of warcraft the first time i played it i left for a while didn't end up coming back

02:02:45.380 --> 02:02:50.980
till burning crusade and then that's when i fell in love with it um mass effect is a big one

02:02:50.980 --> 02:02:57.220
because i played that and you know passed off my review of it sometime excuse me some time

02:02:57.220 --> 02:03:00.580
ago and then just came back and loved it and i don't even know what clicked i think i just

02:03:00.580 --> 02:03:04.580
i played from the beginning instead of in the middle and that made a huge difference

02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:10.660
actually you know what i have to say hmm garris uh minecraft is another big one if i have to name

02:03:10.660 --> 02:03:16.260
one that hasn't been named yet wait maybe you have yet to maybe you'll i've tried minecraft

02:03:16.260 --> 02:03:22.660
and i really do not care for it we'll see uh i would say halo halo i didn't like the first time

02:03:22.660 --> 02:03:26.980
i played it because like first person shooter controller but it was the first time i did an

02:03:26.980 --> 02:03:33.620
lan local area network because remember the first halo wasn't on xbox live uh it wasn't around yet

02:03:33.620 --> 02:03:37.940
it wasn't around yet when i played that first halo in a local area network oh it was awesome

02:03:38.500 --> 02:03:43.540
so awesome uh bradley anything that comes to mind for you okay uh there's nothing i can say that

02:03:44.740 --> 02:03:49.380
all the way i didn't hate it i hated it i loved it but there was one game uh i played i started

02:03:50.020 --> 02:03:56.180
the game adam zombie smasher i played it uh a demo of it at uh packs last year and there was a guy

02:03:56.180 --> 02:04:00.660
there then it kind of threw you in and i didn't know how to play it and so it was i said i don't

02:04:00.660 --> 02:04:04.820
feel like playing this game but it came up in one of the humble bundles and i tried to play it

02:04:04.820 --> 02:04:10.340
and it starts you off from just doing one thing rather than several things so so i basically got

02:04:10.340 --> 02:04:15.060
it into it for a little while and when i played it there and went through a big game so that was

02:04:15.060 --> 02:04:21.300
one that came with from i don't care to actually like the game pretty well all right very cool

02:04:21.940 --> 02:04:26.340
very cool well thank you guys again for answering on facebook and google and of course those of y'all

02:04:26.340 --> 02:04:32.820
here in studio to register participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio on

02:04:32.820 --> 02:04:38.820
vog network.com use the passphrase sugar uh we will continue on with some news we do have the

02:04:38.820 --> 02:04:44.420
mailbag if use of the week and twitter topics skype line all those ways to interact coming

02:04:44.420 --> 02:04:51.220
right up but first more news loki all right um so let's talk a little bit about

02:04:51.220 --> 02:04:57.940
steam and i know i purchased a few things on the steam sale uh during the summer here

02:04:57.940 --> 02:05:05.860
i did also happen to see the update to the uh the terms of service that they have

02:05:06.740 --> 02:05:13.220
now they have you agree to a steam subscriber agreement that basically bars you from

02:05:13.220 --> 02:05:20.660
filing the class action lawsuit and um kind of similar to what we saw with sony and microsoft

02:05:21.380 --> 02:05:25.700
and of course you know they said we've considered this change very carefully it's clear to us in

02:05:25.700 --> 02:05:30.740
some situations class actions have the real benefit to the consumer in far too many cases

02:05:30.740 --> 02:05:35.540
however class actions don't provide any real benefit to users and instead impose unnecessary

02:05:35.540 --> 02:05:39.940
expense and delay and are often designed to benefit the class action lawyers who craft and

02:05:39.940 --> 02:05:46.900
litigate these claims you know i gotta say at least it was a very honest as far as corporate

02:05:46.900 --> 02:05:52.020
can be a very honest letter which you know we kind of val's been pretty good about communicating

02:05:52.020 --> 02:05:56.260
with their community they really have you know especially through some of the other um you know

02:05:56.260 --> 02:06:01.060
like when they were hacked and all that they were pretty transparent with all that um and that it's

02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:06.420
happening here too um i don't know how i feel about this i mean obviously this is the trend

02:06:06.420 --> 02:06:11.060
in the gaming industry i've got to admit there's still a part of me that wonders if that can really

02:06:11.060 --> 02:06:15.300
hold up in court like i understand they're doing it to cover their butts and whatever but can it

02:06:15.300 --> 02:06:19.860
really hold up in court i don't think it's been tested you can still file a lawsuit against them

02:06:19.860 --> 02:06:26.500
but you just can't do it as a group right but i'm saying that i i'm just saying does that necessarily

02:06:26.500 --> 02:06:32.500
stop it i mean do they have the power to put that in the agreement and force you to agree to that

02:06:32.500 --> 02:06:37.380
you're waiving your right to sue us a group i'm i'm surprised that hasn't been tested yet and i

02:06:37.380 --> 02:06:42.980
think it will i think it's gonna be a little bit difficult with them too because um you know you

02:06:42.980 --> 02:06:47.220
bought all these games they give you no warning that also i mean i guess it would be in the end

02:06:47.220 --> 02:06:51.780
user license agreement that oh you can change this at any time you know that all of a sudden

02:06:51.780 --> 02:06:55.860
no i can't use these games unless i agree to this i would think that a judge would see that as

02:06:55.860 --> 02:07:02.500
unreasonable like you know you you can't expect to just all of a sudden you know cut off the service

02:07:02.500 --> 02:07:07.380
that this user is paid for because you know you just put this clause in place that they don't want

02:07:07.380 --> 02:07:13.700
to agree to all of a sudden you know it's kind of ridiculous it's just i guess there's that part of

02:07:13.700 --> 02:07:19.300
me that says why do we let corporations dictate what rights we do and don't have and i i totally

02:07:19.300 --> 02:07:24.340
understand the viewpoint of well then don't agree to it or whatever but yeah it didn't do it

02:07:24.340 --> 02:07:29.460
or whatever but yeah didn't didn't somebody say or maybe i saw it on reddit or something or saw

02:07:29.460 --> 02:07:33.460
it somewhere where somebody was like well what happens if i don't agree to it do i get to access

02:07:33.460 --> 02:07:41.060
my games anymore and the answer was essentially no so i i would that hold up in court i'm not so sure

02:07:41.860 --> 02:07:47.780
i i i guess maybe i'm just i don't know trying to root for the little guy or whatever but the same

02:07:47.780 --> 02:07:54.180
because sometimes you know these courtside with people based on like common sense you know i guess

02:07:54.180 --> 02:07:58.180
and sometimes they you know they're like well it was in the end user license agreement but

02:07:58.180 --> 02:08:02.820
i don't even know like how much of those end user license agreements are even like viable nowadays

02:08:02.820 --> 02:08:08.660
because they've got some of those you know that are in the manual or some that aren't even in a

02:08:08.660 --> 02:08:12.980
manual they're like in a digital manual somewhere out there on the web so a lot of times you don't

02:08:12.980 --> 02:08:20.020
even see these things until you you know you know you go and search them out so that i don't really

02:08:20.020 --> 02:08:24.420
understand if that's the case but like something that they force you to read every time you play

02:08:24.420 --> 02:08:29.140
the game or something like that um oh maybe i don't really know how it works uh game guru in

02:08:29.140 --> 02:08:34.260
chat good point from game guru at live.vognetwork.com says it has been tested the supreme court ruled

02:08:34.260 --> 02:08:40.420
for them hence why everyone's added no class action lawsuits clauses um that's right i think

02:08:40.420 --> 02:08:45.940
it was an at and t thing if i remember right i i i totally understand that but i just think if

02:08:45.940 --> 02:08:51.780
something bad enough happens it's really gonna put this to the test and maybe that particular

02:08:51.780 --> 02:08:55.780
scenario wasn't the right scenario i'm totally i totally understand why they want to block all

02:08:55.780 --> 02:09:00.660
this frivolous lawsuit crap and there are a lot of very frivolous class action lawsuits i get that

02:09:00.660 --> 02:09:06.420
but if something really bad happens i don't know and maybe there's that tinfoil hat part of me that

02:09:06.420 --> 02:09:13.860
wonders why does val feel the need to do this what news is about to come out um maybe it's the whole

02:09:13.860 --> 02:09:20.980
lawsuit that was in um europe perhaps the whole you know used games thing maybe they're just

02:09:20.980 --> 02:09:26.260
trying to prevent something like that happening over here interesting interesting thought why

02:09:26.260 --> 02:09:31.620
did you make me buy so many cheap games during the summer sale i'm gonna sue you because i'm

02:09:31.620 --> 02:09:37.060
irresponsible all right we'll see what develops with this as we move on you know most people are

02:09:37.060 --> 02:09:41.140
pretty forgiving of steam but uh certainly there's gonna be a few people like that guy who tried to

02:09:41.140 --> 02:09:45.540
get around it i i didn't was there a postcard clause or any of that i don't think there was

02:09:47.300 --> 02:09:52.740
uh moving on completely different topic here this is about ea sports and their season ticket

02:09:53.460 --> 02:10:00.900
the season ticket is a subscription uh what is it i think it's 30 for this season ticket thing

02:10:00.900 --> 02:10:09.220
and you get some freebies free dlc that obviously otherwise would be paid dlc um you get free packs

02:10:09.220 --> 02:10:15.700
free packs of cards for madden fifa and nhl ultimate team modes is this do the sports games

02:10:15.700 --> 02:10:22.260
work like mass effect 3 where like you open up the boxes and get cards and they are like like in mass

02:10:22.260 --> 02:10:26.900
effect 3 it's weapons and team members and stuff like is that no because that's another ea game no

02:10:26.900 --> 02:10:31.220
what happened i have to be honest i don't play these games so what is this card thing in madden

02:10:31.780 --> 02:10:36.820
the card thing in madden is for remember how there was the whole fifa hacks they have that

02:10:36.820 --> 02:10:41.540
the ultimate team yeah yeah yeah yeah that's the madden version of it what do those cards get you

02:10:41.540 --> 02:10:47.060
if they're digital cards they get you perks for your players on the teams that's interesting i

02:10:47.060 --> 02:10:51.140
that never clicked for me before but that is very similar to the mass effect 3 thing yeah you

02:10:51.140 --> 02:10:57.220
basically you basically trade with other people and stuff or you oh you trade you you buy or you

02:10:57.220 --> 02:11:03.460
well they sell counts or sell stuff i don't know but somehow there's real money stuff involved in

02:11:03.460 --> 02:11:08.100
it and remember you know before the whole season pass or whatever they're calling it was basically

02:11:08.100 --> 02:11:12.660
to get access to these games a few days before they would come out you would get like a digital

02:11:12.660 --> 02:11:18.020
version that you would play and then the you'd go purchase the real game on um the release day

02:11:18.020 --> 02:11:24.100
and then that digital version would stop working um other things the season ticket had done in the

02:11:24.100 --> 02:11:29.060
past early access to full titles that got deleted when the games were actually released yeah yeah

02:11:29.060 --> 02:11:35.220
yeah interesting and it used to be discounts on premium content but now it's a little different

02:11:35.220 --> 02:11:39.620
they're saying though that there's no way you'd actually be able to pay for it as you if you bought

02:11:39.620 --> 02:11:46.260
like all of the dlc which i'm sure they'd love to have you do uh sj100 matt says rob yep you

02:11:46.260 --> 02:11:50.740
are correct it's the same thing in the nhl games now blackwolf says you can use real money to buy

02:11:50.740 --> 02:11:55.060
new cards but there was an in-game auction house that uses the point system that you get for

02:11:55.060 --> 02:12:01.380
playing ultimate team live.vog network.com and monty boggs great comment hard to call it free

02:12:01.380 --> 02:12:08.660
if it costs thirty dollars that is true it's like playstation plus but i see i like playstation plus

02:12:08.660 --> 02:12:13.140
i think playstation plus that whole thing's really come a long way and it's got a lot of value

02:12:13.140 --> 02:12:20.660
i gotta say it's interesting interesting we'll see how many people um sign up for it i'm sure

02:12:20.660 --> 02:12:25.220
there's enough if they're continuing it into a second year from the first year meanwhile some

02:12:25.220 --> 02:12:30.740
more news stories for you guys dark soccer yes um in other news we actually have some mass effect

02:12:30.740 --> 02:12:36.660
goodies about the wii u which uh is kind of eye-rolling every time i think of the wii u but

02:12:36.660 --> 02:12:41.700
i'll go ahead um it's going to basically have touch screen control so that you can see a map

02:12:41.700 --> 02:12:47.060
of your immediate areas where your squad mates are and where the enemies are highlighted you have four

02:12:47.060 --> 02:12:51.380
powers and abilities that are on each side of the gamepad screen so you can just select one without

02:12:51.380 --> 02:12:56.500
having to go to your quick menu although honestly my quick menu is my friend i'm like pause hold

02:12:56.500 --> 02:13:05.060
this pause um basically uh it was also um at the ea summer showcase where they had the first viewing

02:13:05.060 --> 02:13:11.140
of mass effect 3 on wii u um but the graphics are pretty much going to be the same as how they were

02:13:11.140 --> 02:13:17.140
on the ps3 and xbox 360 version i honestly think that the pc version is still going to top all of

02:13:17.140 --> 02:13:22.100
them because you can tweak it as much as you need to also there's going to be um an interactive

02:13:22.100 --> 02:13:28.020
comic to go with that one kind of like how mass effect 2 genesis was for the ps3 so that if you

02:13:28.020 --> 02:13:31.860
missed out on the previous games then you can make all of your decisions and then move forward

02:13:31.860 --> 02:13:34.900
that's good to know because we wanted to know how that was going to work like how are they

02:13:34.900 --> 02:13:40.020
going to catch the nintendo fans up yeah and then this is the thing that makes me happy mass effect

02:13:40.020 --> 02:13:47.300
3 leviathan there's reaper dlc that's gonna come out you get to shoot reapers in the face well i'm

02:13:47.300 --> 02:13:51.940
looking forward to shooting a reaper in the face it's about time for some single player dlc too

02:13:51.940 --> 02:13:55.860
like i realized the whole extended cut set everything back but i've been foaming at the

02:13:55.860 --> 02:13:59.300
mouth for dlc it's almost been six months in the game they were saying that it's supposed to also

02:13:59.300 --> 02:14:04.580
affect the ending i can see that like maybe an extra little cutaway or sign i think i don't

02:14:04.580 --> 02:14:08.180
think it's like it'll be like a five second cutaway or something i don't think it'll be

02:14:08.180 --> 02:14:12.820
anything major i'm just trying to see um when the release date for that one was and i had seen it

02:14:12.820 --> 02:14:19.940
before and completely missed it but um in fact i'm double checking here's what i really want to

02:14:19.940 --> 02:14:24.980
know about the reaper ending or this leviathan based ending without spoiling too much will you

02:14:24.980 --> 02:14:32.900
still cry when ed dot dot dot i cried so much but i more cried over garris because keep in mind

02:14:32.900 --> 02:14:38.900
keep in mind i started with the extended cut when i played it and the whole little goodbye part on

02:14:38.900 --> 02:14:46.500
the normandy i just like i'm not gonna spoil anything and it's not i will say this i'm not

02:14:46.500 --> 02:14:51.220
talking about dies like i know a lot of people are like oh great rob it's dies nope that's not it

02:14:51.220 --> 02:14:54.260
if you've beaten the game you know what i'm talking about one of the particular endings

02:14:54.260 --> 02:15:04.100
there's a moment when ed and dot dot dot and it's like oh yeah it's a little bit of a cleft

02:15:04.980 --> 02:15:11.780
well they said on here um also that um there's notice there they actually said there were some

02:15:11.780 --> 02:15:16.100
things leaked in the script that actually link it to the extended cut so

02:15:16.100 --> 02:15:24.500
all right loki all right done formulating my uh message to ernie klein um

02:15:26.500 --> 02:15:33.300
i had to use i had to use tweet longer and quit longer anyways so patents lots of patents um

02:15:33.300 --> 02:15:40.260
connect patents this is kind of weird too because this patent basically allows um taking connect

02:15:40.260 --> 02:15:46.340
i guess into mobile cameras so allowing you to use um you know like uh your phone or something

02:15:46.340 --> 02:15:57.300
like that to basically scan people into into a game that's kind of interesting and um apparently

02:15:57.300 --> 02:16:03.540
they said that uh you know it's a mobile environment sensor it determines the trajectory

02:16:03.540 --> 02:16:08.740
through a room and generates a depth map as it goes whether you're using a mobile device or

02:16:08.740 --> 02:16:16.340
as it goes whether using i guess um you know the infrared sensor or stereoscopic cameras and um

02:16:16.340 --> 02:16:21.220
they said the visual mapping isn't enough the camera relies on motion sensor like an accelerometer

02:16:21.220 --> 02:16:28.420
to better judge its position as it's moved around and um that's interesting does this mean the next

02:16:28.420 --> 02:16:32.980
windows phone is going to have connect built in for no particular reason but maybe to take like

02:16:32.980 --> 02:16:39.860
a 3d picture of my face maybe uh they also filed another patent that basically um uses the connect

02:16:40.500 --> 02:16:48.260
um for i guess um directing movies you can you know use your hands the gesture to you know do

02:16:48.260 --> 02:16:54.820
different movie editing stuff uh also uh i guess the depth camera both generates the model

02:16:54.820 --> 02:17:01.140
environment and also creates 3d props out of real objects so augmented reality stuff motion capture

02:17:01.140 --> 02:17:11.540
and i guess um doing other uh you know augmented reality stuff that's kind of neat so um

02:17:13.300 --> 02:17:18.180
interesting i mean a lot of people have been trying to do like video stuff with that like a

02:17:18.180 --> 02:17:23.220
lot of augmented reality stuff so and that would kind of tie in with that you know the whole

02:17:23.220 --> 02:17:28.820
supposedly leaked plan or their timeline or whatever that they were planning on doing the

02:17:28.820 --> 02:17:36.420
next system with all that crazy connect stuff uh dj morpheus in our chat room says i would

02:17:36.420 --> 02:17:40.900
love to have the ability to have my in-game character look like me via image capture

02:17:44.180 --> 02:17:48.980
so didn't they don't they have that on the 3ds and doesn't it not work very well

02:17:50.580 --> 02:17:57.620
yeah pretty much but the 3ds remember it has that front camera but the front's not 3d only the back

02:17:57.620 --> 02:18:01.060
i mean there's three cameras in the 3ds if you think about it one in the front two in the back

02:18:01.060 --> 02:18:08.500
for 3d images it's a little you know anyhow speaking of nintendo and patents i don't know if

02:18:08.500 --> 02:18:14.260
you guys remember this but uh cooper in or excuse me copper innovation innovations group filed a

02:18:14.260 --> 02:18:22.740
lawsuit against nintendo it was a patent lawsuit back in 2008 and it's just now over to remind you

02:18:22.740 --> 02:18:28.500
because you probably forgot copper innovations group claimed that the wiimote and the we console

02:18:28.500 --> 02:18:36.580
infringed on a 1996 patent for quote handheld computer input apparatus and method and if you

02:18:36.580 --> 02:18:41.780
this looks like a mouse like you look at the little figures whatever anyway uh pittsburgh

02:18:41.780 --> 02:18:48.260
u.s district court uh basically found it in nintendo's favor halting the need for a jury

02:18:48.260 --> 02:18:54.100
trial or trial uh nintendo of course is pleased with the decision and thanks their legal team

02:18:54.100 --> 02:19:00.820
and so forth i think most of this us saw this as a patent troll type of thing there's a lot of these

02:19:00.820 --> 02:19:05.460
type of lawsuits that took four years to resolve and it hadn't even gone to jury yet it actually

02:19:05.460 --> 02:19:14.420
got cut off before it went to jury the judge basically said nah nah amazing the legal system

02:19:14.420 --> 02:19:21.460
in this country is so interesting i know i'm not a lawyer but that doesn't stop everybody on the

02:19:21.460 --> 02:19:26.820
internet from pretending to be one let's get to the mailbag oh joy

02:19:29.700 --> 02:19:34.900

02:19:50.020 --> 02:19:56.660
from steven w home does get a bad rep from how it used to be back in the day to what it is currently

02:19:56.660 --> 02:20:00.740
going down with its updates with the recent updates and fixes they have pushed out some

02:20:00.740 --> 02:20:05.460
really good content and finally fixed the glitch that allowed users for using others does home

02:20:05.460 --> 02:20:12.020
still have its issues why yes it does but it does what comes when software is still in beta sorry

02:20:12.020 --> 02:20:17.700
this is very run on sentencing home is constantly evolving and with evolution comes bugs if you look

02:20:17.700 --> 02:20:21.140
past those bugs and look at the community the atmosphere surrounding it and all of the events

02:20:21.140 --> 02:20:28.100
slash games within home you see how epic it is so yes home gets a bad rep but it has a lot of

02:20:28.100 --> 02:20:33.540
good inside of it who does it is it like a pinata so everyone should hop on and check it out even

02:20:33.540 --> 02:20:40.100
if it's for a few moments if i beat it with a stickle candy come out possibly somebody won a

02:20:40.100 --> 02:20:45.940
20 gift card last week of course that had nothing that was not sony sanctioned that was a generous

02:20:45.940 --> 02:20:51.540
fan helping another generous fan out but i'm glad to see good i'm glad some people followed through

02:20:51.540 --> 02:20:55.700
because i don't know if you remember but during hey it's not time for the effus yet be quiet

02:20:55.700 --> 02:21:00.020
during last week's show i actually asked all those guys in playstation home i said does your network

02:21:00.020 --> 02:21:04.980
get a bad rap does home get a bad rap so i'm glad i'm glad somebody followed through with that thank

02:21:04.980 --> 02:21:13.700
you for replying okay well um moving forward hello this is from nasty canasta oh hello olr

02:21:13.700 --> 02:21:17.220
i'm my favorite nicknames by the way that emails the show because i think about the car game

02:21:18.020 --> 02:21:24.660
i think of old people it's like strip canasta or something nasty i'm not sure if you covered this

02:21:24.660 --> 02:21:29.140
before but you might be interested in a teaser for an upcoming pc first person horror game called

02:21:29.140 --> 02:21:33.860
among the sleep the protagonist for among the sleep is a two-year-old aside from the utter

02:21:33.860 --> 02:21:37.940
helplessness you have to deal with playing as this poor toddler imagine if you also had to struggle

02:21:37.940 --> 02:21:42.980
with the baby's current developmental stage how could the game screw with how could the game screw

02:21:42.980 --> 02:21:49.460
with you if this kid didn't grasp the concept of object permanence yet scary ps garris well

02:21:49.460 --> 02:21:55.700
i think a two-year-old understands object permanence says the parent of a two-year-old

02:21:55.700 --> 02:22:00.580
i i actually peeked in the mailbag earlier and i watched the little trailer for this thing and it

02:22:00.580 --> 02:22:07.140
looks creepy as hell and that's that's that's a weird concept for a game to me that's like when

02:22:07.140 --> 02:22:11.060
you do things about children that's always a little creepy yeah i'd like to stay away from

02:22:11.060 --> 02:22:15.940
that at least the child doesn't get eaten by a grew or something it's just you know it's it was

02:22:15.940 --> 02:22:23.620
it was a scary looking game i gotta say me it's like amnesia level scary okay well moving forward

02:22:23.620 --> 02:22:29.140
this one is it's for me hi guys i just wanted to share my happiness to all of you especially

02:22:29.140 --> 02:22:33.700
dark sakura i have found and purchased three rare nes cartridges those are my favorite adventure

02:22:33.700 --> 02:22:38.580
titles from the nest era uh i first wanted to know if dark soccer recognizes one or two

02:22:38.580 --> 02:22:44.580
banana oji no dai bulken which i do it came out as banana prince in the u.s armadillo um which i

02:22:44.580 --> 02:22:51.140
don't think came out in the u.s and then panic restaurant which um actually that is the u.s

02:22:51.140 --> 02:22:54.180
release and i went to find because i only remembered like half of the name because it was

02:22:54.180 --> 02:23:01.460
something gourmet world it was one paku koku no gourmet gourmet world and it came out in 1992 and

02:23:01.460 --> 02:23:07.860
was published by taito where you play as a guy named cookie who looks like chef boyardee not to

02:23:07.860 --> 02:23:11.300
be confused with the announcer from you don't know jack this is this is one of those games that had

02:23:11.300 --> 02:23:17.380
one of those classic things of mistranslation of a name because the bad guy in the game was called

02:23:17.380 --> 02:23:24.420
was called um odor but it was french to japanese so when it came to translating it from japanese to

02:23:24.420 --> 02:23:33.060
english they called him o'dove but the chef in the japanese version had the best name as naughty

02:23:33.060 --> 02:23:40.740
cocoon so that was a good name um banana prince was sort of like kind of uh a jack in the beanstalk

02:23:40.740 --> 02:23:45.060
kind of game where you could get seeds and plant flowers and shit and climb to get to different

02:23:45.060 --> 02:23:52.500
rooms and stuff it was a neat little game and um it was by takura and then armadillo um was sort

02:23:52.500 --> 02:23:57.140
of like super mario 3 where you had like a map that you could move from world to world um i know

02:23:57.140 --> 02:24:02.500
of all three of those games so yeah good job dude you can send me your copy of armadillo if you want

02:24:02.500 --> 02:24:09.620
i'll play the fuck out of it um so uh this is let me know your opinion and happy podcasting

02:24:09.620 --> 02:24:16.020
um banana prince is pretty cute pretty fun um armadillo is pretty fun i actually did not play

02:24:16.020 --> 02:24:21.460
panic restaurant but i've seen it i've seen i know someone who had panic restaurant when i was

02:24:21.460 --> 02:24:29.460
younger so just saying i didn't get into it okay moving forward shall i this comes from clover

02:24:29.460 --> 02:24:35.140

02:25:20.900 --> 02:25:42.020
dan this is the other song remember para para paradise paradise dave domino and virginal

02:25:42.020 --> 02:25:50.180
anniversary there you go hey all i've just started my tour in the mass effect universe

02:25:50.180 --> 02:25:54.340
i have to say that i have owned both one and two on steam for at least two years now i am hooked

02:25:54.900 --> 02:26:00.180
played through the first one in about 22 hours i'm absolutely in love this game is epic honestly

02:26:00.180 --> 02:26:04.900
had chills from the first two minutes when five year later spoil alert shepherd crawled out from

02:26:04.900 --> 02:26:11.540
the wreckage some things happen in my game of in my game though that make me sit in my office during

02:26:11.540 --> 02:26:15.940
the day and question my decisions when one of my favorite characters was shot and killed i wanted

02:26:15.940 --> 02:26:21.620
so badly to reload my game and make different choices yet i different didn't you totally could

02:26:21.620 --> 02:26:26.900
have yeah i i continued on letting the decisions i had made played out for the rest of the story

02:26:26.900 --> 02:26:33.460
my question is which choice based games such as kotor mass effect heavy rain fable do you go with

02:26:33.460 --> 02:26:37.860
your gut feeling and let the story play out as it will or try to change it in the way that you want

02:26:37.860 --> 02:26:44.500
it um mass effect i played i've actually playing the second one the exact damn same way i've played

02:26:44.500 --> 02:26:50.100
the last one my last playthrough on mass effect 3 the only thing that i changed was i killed caden

02:26:50.100 --> 02:26:54.900
and played with ashley using my save file editor just so i could see what ashley was like in mass

02:26:54.900 --> 02:27:01.220
effect 3 i have to admit mass effect was really the first game where i didn't feel this need to

02:27:01.220 --> 02:27:06.900
do everything perfect because usually when i play rpgs i'm kind of that anal retentive search every

02:27:06.900 --> 02:27:13.460
corner talk to every person in the town explore every story do every side quest and there comes

02:27:13.460 --> 02:27:18.900
a point when you're playing these bioware games where you just have to realize you can't do that

02:27:18.900 --> 02:27:25.300
you cannot do it is not possible without playing the game 500 times so mass effect was really one

02:27:25.300 --> 02:27:31.140
of the first games to kind of like get and i realized this is very recent but it's it's a

02:27:31.140 --> 02:27:37.060
different way of thinking for me so and it's not been easy so that's my long-winded answer

02:27:37.060 --> 02:27:48.580
well um i also did play dragon age 2 and i really liked it but it was like when i started romancing

02:27:48.580 --> 02:27:53.860
uh what's her name that was voiced by eve miles i was like oh my god she's annoying oh my god

02:27:53.860 --> 02:27:58.660
she's annoying so i started going after fenris because it's like oh he's kind of broody i'd go

02:27:58.660 --> 02:28:04.580
for fenris um i didn't really play the fable games because i really didn't like them that much

02:28:04.580 --> 02:28:09.700
dan played the crap out of them i started on fable 2 and i liked fable and i never finished

02:28:09.700 --> 02:28:16.180
any of them i which is weird because i own them all um my favorite choice ever was how to bitch

02:28:16.180 --> 02:28:22.660
slap the bitch slap fight in final fantasy 7 just saying and those you know choose your the the

02:28:22.660 --> 02:28:27.940
little mud games or choosing who you would date in final fantasy 7 yeah trying to get the barrett

02:28:27.940 --> 02:28:33.940
date fuck no it was always tifa and i did not use that bitch arith more than i had to because she

02:28:33.940 --> 02:28:41.220
was a ho bag fuck her and now she's tell us how you really feel i have my i still have my save file

02:28:41.220 --> 02:28:47.060
i know where i can kill her as much as i want to and the jenova fight which is fun that's like the

not going to pledge any extra money um also shadowrun online has been confirmed to be getting

02:38:00.820 --> 02:38:08.420

02:50:08.820 --> 02:50:13.620
just talking about musicals has anybody or have any of y'all seen uh video games live because

02:50:13.620 --> 02:50:19.220
it's coming i'm in florida yeah and it's coming to uh st p and i'm so excited to see it it was

02:50:19.220 --> 02:50:26.180
a long time ago maybe um maybe dark long long ago no no i'm saying uh maybe dark tetsuya who is like

02:50:26.180 --> 02:50:31.700
the olr historian will know the episode number but we actually had tommy talarico on the show for like

02:50:31.700 --> 02:50:38.580
an uber interview like 45 minutes long he actually announced that first soundtrack cd on our show

02:50:38.580 --> 02:50:42.740
so it was a while ago i mean that was that was some time ago but yes we not only had tommy on

02:50:42.740 --> 02:50:46.820
the show of several years ago to pimp it the first time but we went and saw it in oakland

02:50:46.820 --> 02:50:51.620
and it was really epic especially when master chief came out with the flag would y'all like to

02:50:51.620 --> 02:50:59.540
hear a true story oh video games live was the first time i ever met alan in person oh other

02:50:59.540 --> 02:51:07.860
than camp well i need another 45 minutes to get into that but let's just say in our adult lives

02:51:07.860 --> 02:51:13.300
yes so this is funny anyway sorry yeah that no that's really cool because i mean i've been

02:51:13.300 --> 02:51:18.580
wanting to see it for years and i i've got a spot on my account and i listen to like the the albums

02:51:18.580 --> 02:51:22.980
on there and i'm just so stoked that it's coming back to florida again i can't wait to see it but

02:51:22.980 --> 02:51:29.540
my my other question was is have you guys heard about the game or it's a mod for arma called or

02:51:29.540 --> 02:51:36.020
arma 2 it's called dayz yeah has anybody gotten into that or what is it all about because i'm a

02:51:36.020 --> 02:51:41.060
huge walking dead fan and it reminds me so much of walking dead it's ridiculous um i haven't really

02:51:41.060 --> 02:51:44.660
gotten a chance to play it because i'm still trying to figure out how map date or uh arma's

02:51:44.660 --> 02:51:52.180
controls to my xbox 360 controller i've gotten close but it gets complicated um but apparently

02:51:52.180 --> 02:51:58.740
it's very just it drops you down you have you know you have to go find resources and um you know

02:51:58.740 --> 02:52:03.780
there's random groups of people walking around doing weird things like kidnapping people and

02:52:03.780 --> 02:52:07.780
you know of course you're fighting zombies but it's more about the crazies that are out there too

02:52:07.780 --> 02:52:15.220
which are all real people and that's and that's what i've heard and i i'm trying to like i guess

02:52:15.220 --> 02:52:19.380
wrap my head around the point of the game because i it seems like the point is just to keep your

02:52:19.380 --> 02:52:24.340
character alive as long as possible which seems kind of creative pretty much yeah and uh by the

02:52:24.340 --> 02:52:29.460
way according to misty the other olr historian how dare i how dare i give that crown to only

02:52:29.460 --> 02:52:34.340
one person because misty just came in and snatched that crown by saying episode 285

02:52:34.340 --> 02:52:40.660
what was the tommy telerico interview thank you misty i'll have to try to look it up then um

02:52:40.660 --> 02:52:44.980
yeah right right right now i'm playing through rage which everybody's told me to play through

02:52:44.980 --> 02:52:50.740
and i it's good i guess it's kind of like a linear fallout in a sense now now's a good time for that

02:52:50.740 --> 02:52:54.980
with quake con in the air and all that stuff it was just on yeah that's what of course i'm a

02:52:54.980 --> 02:52:58.900
steam nut so i picked it up on steam for like 10 bucks the other day so i was like yeah why not

02:52:58.900 --> 02:53:01.940
quickly before i let you go because i do have to get more calls but quickly since you said you're

02:53:01.940 --> 02:53:07.380
a steam nut how do you feel about the new uh end user license agreement and the waving your right

02:53:07.380 --> 02:53:14.500
to a class action lawsuit you know i don't i don't mind honestly they've been so good to me over the

02:53:14.500 --> 02:53:21.460
years and i've had an account forever so it's just like i really don't care fair enough i'm not

02:53:21.460 --> 02:53:26.500
a too happy type person so i mean it's just like yeah whatever it's it's cool with me all right

02:53:26.500 --> 02:53:30.980
now dark dark soccer once once what's this all about you want a private message from the caller

02:57:39.860 --> 02:57:45.220
care buddy that let you go bye all right let's try to get a couple more calls there's just we're

02:57:45.220 --> 02:57:47.380
getting slammed tonight hi you're on orange on this radio who's this

02:57:49.620 --> 02:57:56.020
hey this is excellent hey excellent how you doing hi hey doing good wicked and rent for musicals

02:57:56.020 --> 02:57:59.060
for me those were my two favorite to have soundtracks too so

02:58:02.180 --> 02:58:06.180
but no uh for the record tonight was because i've been playing the last few days in the

02:58:06.180 --> 02:58:12.980
course um some of our other friends have too was the kingdom hearts 3d uh dream drop distance uh

02:58:13.860 --> 02:58:19.700
or 3d ddd as i like to shorten it to call it um it's been a really great game i really enjoyed

02:58:19.700 --> 02:58:23.780
it it's been a lot a lot of fun it's really short but it's really fun though so

02:58:23.780 --> 02:58:27.940
it's really taking a lot of the old stuff and tying it back in and making it so

02:58:27.940 --> 02:58:32.660
um when three comes out at least it will bring the storyline up to that of part three

02:58:37.220 --> 02:58:44.660
um did you get to try on world yes i did how was that that was a lot of fun i i really enjoyed it

02:58:44.660 --> 02:58:51.700
that's um it it's it's very unique in its own way so i i really did enjoy i'll i'll

02:58:51.700 --> 02:58:58.420
i really did enjoy a lot of it and how they're splitting the storyline up between riku and sora

02:58:58.420 --> 02:59:05.860
so um let's see what else i was gonna ask about uh kingdom hearts oh yeah there's this funny

02:59:05.860 --> 02:59:10.260
facebook post and maybe you saw it too that was like kingdom hearts explained and it's this really

02:59:10.260 --> 02:59:16.980
complicated tree of relationships and it really did make me think like damn kingdom hearts really

02:59:16.980 --> 02:59:24.420
is kind of like a it's a really complicated game and it was aimed at kids well it's because of the

02:59:24.420 --> 02:59:29.940
different ways it branched out i mean you had you had um of course you had kingdom heart one you

02:59:29.940 --> 02:59:36.180
had kingdom heart two you had the um you have recoded you had a chain of memory which chain

02:59:36.180 --> 02:59:41.060
of memory was technically between one and two and then uh they branched out like these through the

02:59:41.060 --> 02:59:45.700
little storylines and then finally with this one at least they're starting to take all the games

02:59:45.700 --> 02:59:49.940
and saying okay here's the storyline between the games in case you didn't see like birth

02:59:51.140 --> 02:59:55.780
birth by sleep was a prequel to everything and of course so it's pretty much was all over the place

02:59:55.780 --> 03:00:00.500
but like i said before i like it how they they sat down with the game so far and they're pretty much

03:00:00.500 --> 03:00:05.140
going through and tying everything together going okay this is the reason why this has happened

03:00:05.780 --> 03:00:09.460
this is the reason why that one happened the way it did and this is the reason why this one

03:00:09.460 --> 03:00:13.620
happened the way it did so it's kind of they're taking all the pieces tying it all together and

03:00:13.620 --> 03:00:18.500
get ready for that big finale at the end hopefully so well i hope to hell it is kingdom hearts 3 i

03:00:18.500 --> 03:00:22.580
got my fingers and toes crossed for tokyo game show announcement but then again we still have

03:00:22.580 --> 03:00:26.900
to get through well they they did say they're they are making three which is really good

03:00:26.900 --> 03:00:32.420
and it's just as to when oh who only knows and like i told you before i really hope when they

03:00:32.420 --> 03:00:37.700
do they take their time they make sure they end it you know they they tie all everything together

03:00:37.700 --> 03:00:41.460
and they end it in a way so we can go okay that was kind of cool kind of like with the whole mass

03:00:41.460 --> 03:00:47.140
effect so is there one of them secret endings that gives you the extra scene that you know maybe it's

03:00:47.140 --> 03:00:51.540
too soon to know but that kind of gives the big king yes there is i know that i just don't know

03:00:51.540 --> 03:00:57.220
what it is exactly yeah but i hear it does tie in it's supposed to tie into that three so all right

03:00:57.220 --> 03:01:03.060
well um before i let you go i just gotta let you know rant i wasn't such a fan of rent really yeah

03:04:51.940 --> 03:04:56.740
between uh guitar hero or act i shouldn't say activision and gwen symphonic still going on

03:04:57.540 --> 03:05:04.500
oh what's the latest on that uh they still want to sue them i the latest is no doubt has a new

03:05:04.500 --> 03:05:14.740
single out it's not bad uh yeah so apparently uh apparently they are i guess um yeah they're

03:05:14.740 --> 03:05:20.580
still wanting to uh find a lawsuit and um basically ideally they would uh like activision

03:05:20.580 --> 03:05:25.220
to apologize and promise to never mistreat artists in the manner that they have been mistreated no

03:05:25.220 --> 03:05:35.940
doubt and countless others um you know uh i don't know it's kind of like i don't care anymore

03:05:35.940 --> 03:05:42.580
because guitar hero it's not coming out anymore so yes they will never do that again because

03:05:43.220 --> 03:05:48.100
there's no more guitar it'll have a renaissance on the next watch it'll be out on the next platforms

03:05:48.100 --> 03:05:53.460
don't you worry all right quickly some tweets let's get to a couple tweets from tiger claw

03:05:53.460 --> 03:05:58.900
sends us some tweets uh quite a few here uh one of them is about the world of warcraft movie

03:05:59.940 --> 03:06:05.140
and uh i do remember reading about this the world of warcraft movie apparently it's still happening

03:06:05.140 --> 03:06:11.300
sam ramie's not involved anymore but there is a new scribe uh charles leavitt is the new scribe

03:06:11.300 --> 03:06:17.860
of the world of warcraft movie that is the dude who wrote the seventh son um what else did he do

03:06:17.860 --> 03:06:24.260
uh blood diamond wait hold on what is this wait okay yeah he did do the latest script

03:06:24.260 --> 03:06:28.580
okay so the seventh son is the latest movie that's coming out sorry i read these live

03:06:28.580 --> 03:06:34.420
i haven't read this article in advance before it was tweeted to me um warner brothers is putting

03:06:34.420 --> 03:06:40.820
out that seventh son pick on october 18th 2013 other movies he's written blood diamond the mighty

03:06:40.820 --> 03:06:45.140
and k-packs i haven't seen any of those movies but blood diamond was oscar nominated right

03:06:45.140 --> 03:06:49.060
it was oscar nominated for performance not for script it wasn't k-packs the one with kevin spacey

03:06:49.780 --> 03:06:54.660
um yeah i did see that one yeah how was it was it well written it was all right yeah i think it's

03:06:54.660 --> 03:06:58.580
well written all right so we don't know any details outside of that however they do say

03:06:58.580 --> 03:07:03.380
legendary also has the mass effect film in development that is still a thing and that has

03:07:03.380 --> 03:07:08.020
been kind of reaffirmed what the mass effect film no way yeah they're doing a mass effect film it's

03:07:08.020 --> 03:07:11.860
supposed i was just talking about this earlier it's supposed to be based off the first game

03:07:11.860 --> 03:07:19.300
but i'm it needs to be chick shepherd i'm you know what i i everybody's saying it's going to

03:07:19.300 --> 03:07:23.300
be dude shepherd and i don't know if they made that announcement officially but i am i play a

03:07:23.300 --> 03:07:27.380
dude shepherd in mass effect but for real i actually totally agree with you i think the

03:07:27.380 --> 03:07:32.020
only way they're going to make the fans all of them happy is to do femshep in the movie and i

03:07:32.020 --> 03:07:36.980
think it would be totally acceptable but at that point it's all about the casting if they don't

03:07:36.980 --> 03:07:42.900
cast the right person as femshep and i don't know who is over by jennifer hale i don't well who who

03:07:42.900 --> 03:07:50.660
could play femshep what actress would you be okay with playing femshep alice go to hell alice has

03:07:50.660 --> 03:07:57.860
kim kardashian no no and more no all right i gotta pull this one up on the computer because tiger

03:07:57.860 --> 03:08:02.660
claw sent us another link but it's to a video and it did kind of uh crack me up i actually saw this

03:08:02.660 --> 03:08:09.460
earlier i think he or somebody else posted on facebook um and it's a guy getting a question

03:08:09.460 --> 03:08:15.460
wrong on who wants to be a millionaire that you think everybody would know here it is now

03:08:16.020 --> 03:08:21.140
apologies this is somebody shooting at their tv so he's going for the seven million dollar

03:08:21.140 --> 03:08:36.100
question seven million dollar seven thousand dollar question well known to avid video gamers the key sequence up up down down left right left right be a start is a cheat code known as

03:08:36.100 --> 03:08:44.580
what so everybody here knows that one right it's the konami code the capcom code yeah well that's

03:08:44.580 --> 03:08:55.220
one of the answers well let me see if she reads them here seriously if you're gonna do a youtube

03:08:55.220 --> 03:08:59.780
shooting at your television stop doing the dishes in the background it gets in the way did they

03:08:59.780 --> 03:09:09.460

03:09:09.460 --> 03:09:18.180
code d was konami code g which one stands out derp derp coat well you know i'm not a gamer

03:09:20.500 --> 03:09:25.300

03:09:25.300 --> 03:09:33.540
essentially allows him to skip it there it was but hey can i have the jump the question lifeline

03:09:33.540 --> 03:09:39.620
now man i've ever watched that a long time it's like they got rid of the hot seat it's standing
