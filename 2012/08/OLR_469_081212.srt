00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Here's your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loku

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Tonight, August 12th, 2012, Amazon starts a new game studio

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Valve is set to use Steam for non-gaming applications

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and has an R-rated version of a Super Nintendo game been discovered?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
where every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
for this August the 12th of 2012 and the 400 and, wait for it

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
69th episode of our show

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That doesn't imply anything by the way

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
No, not at all

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
to talk about video games, gaming culture, and so forth

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
with my co-host and those of you live and participating with us at VOG Network

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
but I'll get back to that in a minute

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
First, let me introduce my co-host

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Say hello to Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It implies that Rob has an internal 12 year old girl

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What?

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's giggling at the 69

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You have a little girl inside of you? That's really weird

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Well, funny enough, I was playing Disneyland Connect Adventures today

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
which I didn't think we were going to get into gaming weeks as fast

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
but okay, why not, it's a special night

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I found my inner little girl

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
because you can choose to be a boy or a girl

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and I was like, well I'll be the little girl with pigtails

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
because she's cute

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
so maybe, Dark Sakura, maybe there is some truth to what you're saying

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Well I was just like, 69 tee hee

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yeah, I know, when you say like 69

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and start talking about girls, it is a little bit of a creeper zone

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
so we probably shouldn't go there, it's just a little creepy

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I like pie

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Pie is good

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Pie is good

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Pie is great, so is coffee

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Also over there, say hello to tech master Loki

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Hi

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
How you doing, Loki?

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm doing fine

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So what do you say?

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
For old times sake, let's get Karaoke Revolution out

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
No

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
No one plays that anymore

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Okay, well I have SingStar

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
No one plays any karaoke games anymore

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
SingStar ABBA?

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No, I'm sorry, that's not acceptable

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh my god, SingStar ABBA, we totally need to do SingStar ABBA

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I think we should do some live on air SingStar ABBA tonight

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But I won't sing

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Would you like to maybe do a duet on SingStar ABBA later?

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Maybe

56
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Maybe just for the listeners for the occasion?

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Maybe

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I don't wanna talk

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Come on, come on, you wanna do it, alright

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Say hello as well, we have some special guests in the studio tonight

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Please welcome back to the show, I'm always very happy to see him here in studio

62
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And part of that is because he has a very sexy radio voice

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Say hello to Jason

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And I'm always glad to be back in California

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Welcome back, even in the triple degree heat?

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Uh, it's no uh, 68 foggy San Francisco bay, but I still make the triple

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's 69 foggy Sacramento bay, excuse you

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Uh oh, right, right

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm gonna milk those jokes for all they're worth tonight

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Loki just gave me a look

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
God, I wish it was a- I mean, I don't wish it was a TV show, but like, I do sometimes

72
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I wish Loki had a camera, that's the only one that needs to be on cam, is Loki, let's be real

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I don't need to do that

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
That's the only one that people wanna see

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
His stealth webcam, considering the ones persistently pointed at his face

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I do have a camera like, faced right at me, like the entire time

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We need like the type of like, you remember like MTV back in the 90s where it was like audience cam

78
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Where they had music?

79
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Candy cam, yeah, back when they had music and like remote control and stuff

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Like we need that zany audience cam, that's like, just like Blair Witch Project style shaking and all that

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Japanese variety TV shows usually have one of the comedians or talents

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
They'll basically picture and picture the person right in the corner

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So that when the news is interesting, shocking, whatever, you get that reaction cam right away

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Something like that would be perfect

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I love that

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And they do it like all the time when I was watching Morning News with me

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Alright, we have another guest here in studio tonight

88
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And I'm so happy to introduce this person to the show

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Because I know it's somebody who's been a long time listener of OLR

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And she has finally made it to the studio after a 469 week pilgrimage

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What can I say, she walked, no I'm kidding

92
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But we're so happy to welcome, what am I calling you tonight?

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You better introduce yourself because I don't want to call you the wrong thing tonight

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Well I always went by Rai Chan and that's what I am on the chat, so hello

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Hello Rai Chan, welcome to the show

96
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I just call you Rai for short because I don't know, I heard Jason calling her that one

97
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So I was like, I like that, Rai works for me

98
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So Rai Chan, how are you?

99
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's good to finally be on vacation, it's good to finally be out here

100
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah

101
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Awesome, so how long have you been listening to Orange Launch Radio, it's been a while right?

102
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah, I started about the time when Jason and I actually met

103
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So it's been about 8 years or so

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So you used to play, back in the day you used to play DDR and all that stuff?

105
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah, that's how actually Jason and I met, so

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay, I want to hear the story, how did Jason and Rai meet over DDR?

107
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The couple, the particular points that were interesting were

108
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Obviously her living in Colorado, myself living in New Mexico

109
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I being a mod for the Southwest part on DDR Freak

110
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It all started because I told her she was breaking the rules

111
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
That was my first reason to explicitly

112
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Did you give her a point?

113
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Never, good choice of words

114
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Back to the story, did she

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I didn't say did you give her a prick, I said did you give her a point?

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The DDR Freak rules were outside of the imaging forum

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That pictures couldn't be more than 300x300

118
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And I used it as an excuse to private message her and say

119
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Well the rules say this, so could you please do that?

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And she was very, well and how dare you, posted image over 300 kilobytes on a forum

121
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Shame on me

122
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So we all kind of started, her and myself and a bunch of other people

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Started getting on aimchat rooms just talking for all hours of the night

124
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Whatever random things

125
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We were actually talking about this, we were over at Iguana Girls House

126
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
New place earlier this morning

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And I actually mentioned that both Rai and myself were on LiveJournal

128
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And I saw her commenting on a post of Iguana Girls

129
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And I found out that she was on LiveJournal as a result

130
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So I started checking out her posts and commenting on them

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Oh my god, we're talking about DDR freakin' LiveJournal

132
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Tonight's show is like 10 years in the past

133
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This episode of OLR was brought to you by a...

134
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Hey, I'm in a time warp tonight

135
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
We're out doing the take to late for NBC

136
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Alright

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's the OLR time capsule

138
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Bringing you live coverage tonight of the Sydney 2000 Olympics everybody

139
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We actually recorded this show 10 years ago but no one even knows

140
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We're just playing it back

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Okay, so Rai, obviously, I mean we go back to the DDR days

142
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
But I know you're a gamer girl

143
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What types of video games are you into? Or computer games or what have you?

144
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Mostly RPGs, puzzle games

145
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Diablo

146
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Diablo

147
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Lots and lots of Diablo

148
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Lots of Diablo

149
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I've got two level 60s and I'm working on a third

150
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Addict

151
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I play a lot of World of Warcraft

152
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I play a lot of World of Warcraft

153
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
A lot of World of Warcraft

154
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And every time I sign on

155
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
There's always at least one person on my real ID

156
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Can anyone guess who is always on real ID?

157
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Signed in playing Diablo 3

158
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That would be me

159
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Okay, so Diablo 3 has taken a lot of shit out there

160
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But obviously you don't care because you're playing it

161
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So why are haters hating on Diablo 3

162
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And why can they go just hate in the corner?

163
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You know, with me, I started with Diablo 2 when I was in high school

164
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's one of those things that I have always really, really liked

165
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So I waited for it to come out

166
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
People hate, people always hate

167
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Let them hate, I don't care

168
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Haters to the left

169
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Okay, we're just gonna play a little bit of word association

170
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm gonna say a phrase, you tell me what comes to mind

171
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Alright, you ready?

172
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Real money auction house

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Don't do it

174
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I've sold a couple things on there

175
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But otherwise I don't really participate in it

176
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
PVP patch

177
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Not something that I care about

178
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You know, you wanna go through and kill other players

179
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Go for it

180
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Activision

181
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I just gotta laugh

182
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And that's about it

183
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Well said, well said

184
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Well, welcome to the show

185
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Rai, I'm sorry she's a little quiet you guys

186
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
She's actually, because we have five people tonight

187
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
She's actually having to share a mic with me

188
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And the me mic

189
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Rob, don't shut up

190
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
That's right, I have a very loud voice

191
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So the me mic is tuned for my voice

192
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So when Rai talks in it, she's a little quiet

193
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But I appreciate your prompt attention to Rai

194
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And the things she has to say

195
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Hey, we do tape live at the Voice of Geeks Network

Possibly read here on the show

202
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And some folks here in the chat room

203
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Let's see, BlackWolf is reminding us

204
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
That tonight's show has been tape delayed ten years

205
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yes, Frisbee says

206
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Live from Salt Lake City

207
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Close, Jason might have gone through there

208
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
On the trip here, right?

209
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Uh, Provo and

210
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I-70 goes through both

211
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The rail takes a destination that goes through Provo

212
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And has a stop in Salt Lake City

213
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
There you go

214
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I want to talk about presents

215
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Because Loki was really awesome

216
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And brought Dark Soccer and I presents

217
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And I guess they were like early Christmas

218
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Slash late birthday

219
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Whatever the reason was

220
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Those were awesome

221
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yeah, I loved it

222
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So tell the listeners about what that was

223
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Okay, so

224
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
After, and I really do blame VJHS

225
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
For this, after VJHS

226
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
After I kickstarted

227
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That, or pledged to that

228
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Kickstarter, I started

229
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Getting into the habit of browsing Kickstarter

230
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
For things, and one of the things that I saw

231
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
There was a custom

232
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Card deck for

233
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
There's a bunch of companies doing custom cards

234
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And stuff like that, so one of the decks

235
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That was on there was

236
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The Grid, it's like

237
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Tron themed cards, but not quite

238
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You know, because they can't do it without the licensing

239
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But it's

240
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Tron-esque cards, you know

241
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That very neon black

242
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
They're pretty cool looking

243
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So it was a limited run

244
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I think they only did about a thousand of them

245
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And so I pledged to

246
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Get a bunch of, well, a few of the decks

247
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So I kept one, I gave one to my friend

248
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I gave one to you guys

249
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And

250
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yeah, so, it was cool

251
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yeah, I gotta say, I don't even want to open them

252
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm like, I do need a deck of cards

253
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
For card games, but I don't want to open them

254
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Because they're so awesome

255
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's like, you know, not wanting to

256
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Open toys, just use them

257
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I can show you a picture of what all the cards look like

258
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
If that'll help

259
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Okay, that'll work

260
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Now, despite all the fact that we give Kickstarter a lot of

261
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Crap here on the show, you know, a lot of that's been me

262
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Although Jamie's had her fair share in giving Kickstarter

263
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Crap

264
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And it's

265
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Again, it's not necessarily the whole website

266
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
That I have a problem with

267
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
There's just some people on there

268
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You just have to be buyer beware

269
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Just like eBay

270
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Not all eBay auctions are evil, but some people

271
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Put up shady stuff

272
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's that thing that's being perpetuated as well

273
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Like, you want to make millions?

274
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Go to Kickstarter and just like

275
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's everybody's easy button answer right now

276
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
When things in life aren't that easy button

277
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So it's like everybody's just swarming

278
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's like the gold rush

279
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Everybody's just swarming on it

280
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You see, that's where most of my problems lie therein

281
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
There's been some good Kickstarters

282
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I have come this close

283
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This close to donating

284
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
To one of the Kickstarters and I still might

285
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And that would be my first Kickstarter ever

286
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And that's the GamerCon one

287
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm seriously considering supporting

288
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Well, they've already hit their funding

289
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I was just on Kickstarter about a few seconds ago

290
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And I saw that they had hit their funding, I think

291
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
For that, but that's still cool

292
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
They can always use more funding

293
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm kind of obligated

294
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
To go to GamerCon, you know

295
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's in San Francisco, I mean

296
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's right up the street

297
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Yeah, but you can also go to YowieCon

298
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Which is also in San Francisco

299
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
YowieCon is fun

300
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But GamerCon is about video games

301
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
YowieCon is about

302
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
YowieCon has electronic tools

303
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
No, it has the electric

304
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
469, folks

305
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
This guy was selling

306
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
These glass tubes

307
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That attach to an electric current

308
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And it shoots electricity across your skin

309
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And I had him turn it up all the way

310
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Because I have nerve damage in my hands

311
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So I didn't feel it

312
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And he's like, are you alive?

313
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yes, I want one of these

314
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It kind of tickles

315
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Alright, so Loki, Kickstarter

316
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You've kind of become a little bit like

317
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You kickstart a lot of stuff

318
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You have a lot of feet

319
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
A few things, I mean

320
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I don't know, I like independent projects

321
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Sometimes and I like stuff

322
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I like getting things in the mail

323
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I don't know

324
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
That's not

325
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
That's not why I do it

326
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I don't know why that's so funny

327
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But because it's episode 469

328
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I like getting things in the mail

329
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
My mind goes to porn

330
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Dildos, lube

331
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I have never gotten porn, dildos, or lube

332
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
In the mail

333
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yet

334
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I guess that does open up opportunities

335
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I have

336
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And I didn't even order it

337
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Get return present for Loki

338
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
One of these days

339
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The UPS delivery man is going to be like

340
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Somebody just ordered you a 10 gallon bottle of lube

341
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So

342
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Thanks

343
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
No, there's actually a website called

344
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
AlienDildos.com

345
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You're going to have to get one of the pumping mechanisms

346
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And I found it through

347
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
A mass effect forum

348
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Alright, anyways

349
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I back a few projects every now and then

350
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And actually I've done a few recently

351
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But yeah, the second project I backed

352
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Was those cards

353
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Because they were pretty cool looking

354
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I was like, oh sweet, Tron cards

355
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Well this would be a great gift

356
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
That's exactly what I thought

357
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm like, this would be a great gift

358
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So I'm going to do that

359
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And so that's what I did

360
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I opened my cards and yeah, they're pretty awesome

361
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I don't play a lot of card games

362
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
But when I do, I'm going to use those

363
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I think you just became a gift

364
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Did you hear that? I don't play a lot of card games

365
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
But when I do

366
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
No, but

367
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You heard it too, right?

368
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
But when I do, I play them on the grid

369
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
No, but seriously

370
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
There's been some pretty cool projects on there

371
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
For example, Cards Against Humanity

372
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Was one I wish I had gotten

373
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
In on because that would have been awesome

374
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
But they have that

375
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I backed Ouya recently

376
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Which we'll see what happens with that

377
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm pretty faithful that

378
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It'll come through

379
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I know a lot of people are like, oh

380
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's going to be like a phantom

381
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It's going to disappear like a phantom

382
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Up in smoke

383
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Gone

384
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
But yeah, there's a lot of things that I back on there

385
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
That's where the cards came from

386
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
They actually have another set coming out too

387
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
This 4pm studios

388
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
They have a Cthulhu themed set

389
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
That looks pretty fucking sweet

390
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm really into what you're saying

391
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Usually I wouldn't go on these tangents

392
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
But thanks to the closing ceremonies

393
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
This will be our lowest rated live episode

394
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
In 4 years

395
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What in the actual fuck

396
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Are you looking at on that computer dark

397
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Sakura?

398
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's the funniest website

399
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I've ever seen in my life

400
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
What is that? Rule 37?

401
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What do they call that?

402
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
This is a Rule 37

403
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's a website that I actually found

404
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Through a Mass Effect Tumblr

405
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Of course

406
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Well I have to say that this episode

407
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
The TTP has only been 26 minutes

408
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Wait a minute

409
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute

410
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Tell us what the website is because I want to come back

411
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
To this whole discovery of the website

412
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What is the website? I posted it in chat already

413
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Could you share for the podcast listeners?

414
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
AlienDildos.com

415
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't know if we should be going down this path

416
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
There's already an explicit tag

417
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
There's no stopping this train

418
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Tell me in what part of Mass Effect

419
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Fandom

420
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Would we require

421
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
an AlienDildos.com

422
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You're taking this femshep

423
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Garris thing a little too far

424
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
When you want to model

425
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Of his wiener as a butt plug

426
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
No

427
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Do not want

428
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Turian butt plug is taking this obsession one step too far

429
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
There's an FAQ

430
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
For a comic that someone was doing

431
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And someone said

432
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What do you think Turian cock

433
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Looks like?

434
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And she linked to the site

435
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And the artist

436
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Linked to the site

437
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Who

438
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Who cares

439
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Rule 37

440
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And the internet cares

441
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That's a true quote

442
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
If I've ever heard one

443
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
We usually

444
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Like to start the show by talking about our gaming

445
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Weeks and the type of video games that we've

446
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Been playing this week

447
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I just wanted to mention one thing since we were

448
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Previously before the Dildo Talk

449
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
We were talking about Kickstarter

450
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Which I would like to mention

451
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I asked him to call in too

452
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Maybe he'll call in later

453
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Speaking of Kickstarter

454
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
There is a Kickstarter

455
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
That's being done by

456
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
One of our listeners

457
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
He is a part of his company

458
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And it's for a game called Evilot

459
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Evilot is kind of a

460
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Dungeon

461
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Defense game

462
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And they've got

463
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
A pretty low goal to hit

464
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
But of course they

465
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Need all the help that they can get

466
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
So if you guys can go maybe back

467
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
If it looks good

468
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
For $15 you get the game on every single platform

469
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
That they're releasing it on

470
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Did they pay for that commercial?

471
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm just kidding

472
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I will support

473
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
A foodie monster

474
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
He's doing animation on

475
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
He hasn't listened in a while

476
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
What ever happened to him?

477
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Foodie monster, where are you?

478
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Well foodie monster

479
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I want a Skype call in the coming weeks

480
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
If you're going to get your

481
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Kickstarter wares out there

482
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Evilot

483
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
They're about $3,500 of a $10,000 goal

484
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That's not bad

485
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Still 3 weeks to go

486
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Still be relevant for that call within the next couple of episodes

487
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Good job

488
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I backed them

489
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
We're going to make a game for the Ouya

490
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I need some games to play

491
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
On that console that may or may not disappear

492
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Into the mist like the Phantom

493
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Like the Phantom

494
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Oh a link

495
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Give a link in chat

496
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Alrighty

497
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Moving on, let's get into our gaming weeks

498
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And the type of video games that we have been playing this week

499
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Dark Soccer, start us off

500
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm playing Mass Effect 2 for Becky

501
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And I'm playing Mass Effect 3 for me

502
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And World of Warcraft

503
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And

504
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I played

505
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Droplets on my phone

506
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's not as good on my phone as it is on

507
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Steam, just saying

508
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So you went from Turian dildos to Orcish dildos

509
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
No

510
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Ew

511
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Everyone knows Orcs don't bathe

512
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
My bad

513
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Alright, Loki

514
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
How about your gaming week?

515
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I actually played some different things

516
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Pretty much also the same stuff

517
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Played a lot more Minecraft

518
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Finally got to do some more co-op stuff

519
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
With my co-worker

520
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's still getting a little boring

521
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I actually just purchased it on PC

522
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Which I'm looking forward to playing around with the mods and stuff

523
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Because my PC probably can handle that

524
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Also

525
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Played a bit of Call of Duty

526
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3

527
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Still fun

528
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Looking forward to the Black Ops 2

529
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And then the new thing

530
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I actually played this week was Sleeping Dogs

531
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Which is a pretty awesome game

532
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
For those who are not aware

533
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's what true crime Hong Kong

534
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Was

535
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It was going to be true crime Hong Kong

536
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Before the IP got sold off

537
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So now it's this brand new

538
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Open world action game

539
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
With a lot of kung fu

540
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And

541
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
A lot of homages to classic kung fu

542
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Films and

543
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Crime dramas and all that

544
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It has that feeling of

545
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
A Hong Kong action film which is pretty sweet

546
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
The combat in it

547
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Is pretty good

548
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Because it's a little bit more sophisticated

549
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Than Grand Theft Auto where

550
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Combat is just there as a side note

551
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Because it's mostly guns guns guns guns guns

552
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
This though

553
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Because it does have all that Hong Kong

554
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Influence

555
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's a lot of kung fu in there

556
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So you're having to fight a ton of people

557
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
All at one time

558
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Having to do counters and stuff like that

559
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
For me the counter system doesn't

560
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Always work right

561
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Because they flash red

562
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And as long as you hit it while they're red

563
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It should counter

564
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
But it doesn't work sometimes

565
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's a little annoying because I keep dying

566
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Over and over

567
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
But that's probably because it's not button masher friendly

568
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
But the game is really cool

569
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I know it's been getting a lot of coverage

570
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
In the blogs recently

571
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Definitely one to check out

572
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Especially if you're a fan of Grand Theft Auto type games

573
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You're not getting a new Grand Theft Auto game

574
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Until at least next year

575
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Sometime

576
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Saints Row

577
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I do need to go back and play Saints Row though

578
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Um

579
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Did you just say fuck Saints Row and then I need to go play Saints Row

580
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Well I need to go finish my achievements

581
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
But yeah fuck that game because

582
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
They just

583
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Saints Row 2 was so great

584
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Those were two similarly different phrases

585
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That you just used

586
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Rob wins

587
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And I can't say that they've fucking driven it into the ground

588
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Okay it

589
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You know

590
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Saints Row 2 was a great game

591
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It was over the top

592
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
They had made it a little bit more over the top

593
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Than the first one

594
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And they expanded the features and stuff like that

595
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Saints Row the third looked like they were going to do even more with that

596
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
But then they just went fucking crazy with it

597
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And it makes no god damn sense whatsoever

598
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's like

599
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
If you were

600
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Imagine if you will

601
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
With the Christopher Nolan

602
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Batman's okay

603
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And then all of a sudden the last movie is a fucking

604
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Joel Schumacher Batman

605
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
That's how the fucking series is gone with Saints Row

606
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It's just like

607
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Okay that's kind of cool

608
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Okay that's even cooler

609
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
What the fuck happened?

610
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Why are these things happening?

611
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Why is there a sky fortress flying around?

612
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You know

613
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It's just really weird

614
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You have to admit Saints Row the third is really funny

615
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It's a fun game

616
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
But they hoard out the DLC

617
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
All the DLCs sucked

618
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
The game was Batman Returns

619
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Where it's like

620
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Okay it's a little different

621
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
A little zany, Jim Carrey is in it, he's funny

622
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And then the DLC is just

623
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Batman and Robin

624
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
There they go, perfect example

625
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And then look at what they were trying to do

626
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
They were like oh yeah we're going to do this

627
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Enter the dominatrix thing as a stand alone game

628
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Which right there

629
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I don't know about that

630
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And then they were like hey you know what

631
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
We're going to take the milking of this property even further

632
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
We're just going to incorporate that into a

633
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Brand new Saints Row the fourth game

634
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Or Saints Row the fourth

635
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Oh thank you

636
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
That's going to be fantastic that you're recycling this game

637
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
We actually have an exclusive clip

638
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
From some unreleased DLC

639
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:15,000
For Saints Row the third, let's hear it

640
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Well that sounds like a pretty cool expansion

641
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I'm going to tell you right now

642
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Okay if the next Batman game that came out

643
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Was based on

644
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Batman and Robin, I would actually probably buy it

645
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Because

646
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Batman and Robin should be a video game

647
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
As fucking terrible as that movie was

648
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
It's funny

649
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
No one is obviously taking this movie seriously

650
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
If you're casting Arnold Schwarzenegger

651
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
As Mr. Freeze

652
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
That doesn't make any sense whatsoever

653
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
That's like

654
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Casting Tara Reid as a scientist

655
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Oh wait that's been done before too

656
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
But you know

657
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
That movie also sucked, Alone in the Dark

658
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
What up G in our chat room says

659
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Bane was much better than that Bane

660
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
That's true

661
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
But I loved the voice they gave Bane

662
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
In the movie

663
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
He sounded like Count Chocula

664
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
He sounded Belgian

665
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Didn't Bane in the movie sound like

666
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Count Chocula to you?

667
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Let me remember him

668
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
That's what he sounded like to me

669
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
He sounded like Count Chocula

670
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And I couldn't take it

671
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Because I'm like Count Chocula just

672
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Oh I shouldn't spoil

673
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Alright

674
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Well that also wasn't a very good movie

675
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Speaking of 13 year time warps

676
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Count Chocula is kind of an asshole

677
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Alright

678
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Anyway

679
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Your gaming week

680
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Yes my gaming week if Loki is all done with his gaming week

681
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I actually had quite a bit of a busy gaming week

682
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I have three games I want to talk about

683
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Let's talk first about Pit

684
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I'm sorry

685
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Sorry sorry

686
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
There's one thing that is worth mentioning

687
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
The Ready Player One contest

688
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Oh yeah alright

689
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Fair enough I'm ready for an update

690
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Alright so the Ready Player One contest

691
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Remember last week the whole thing I bitched about

692
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
You know fucking

693
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
You bitch!

694
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
At the break of world record

695
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And it is basically impossible

696
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
To break the world record of

697
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
The four games that they started off with

698
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
At least it was impossible

699
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
For

700
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
You know Black Tiger

701
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
But I was willing

702
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
To buy Black Tiger

703
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And make the adjustments

704
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
So that it was exactly

705
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Like the machine that had the world record

706
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I was all ready to do that

707
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Right before I actually purchased anything

708
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I went and checked the update on the blog

709
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And sure enough someone had beat the world record

710
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
On Joust on 2600

711
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And it has been confirmed

712
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
That was going to be the easiest one to beat

713
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
That was the only accessible one

714
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
That was the contest

715
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Really

716
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
All that other stuff was just a red herring

717
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
But it was poorly run in the first place

718
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
You keep adding games

719
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And changing the rules

720
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Within a couple days

721
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
It was ridiculous

722
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
But congratulations to the guy that won it

723
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Of course it still has to be confirmed by Twin Galaxies

724
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
But it's been confirmed by

725
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Whoever is running the contest I guess

726
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
It looks like it's legit

727
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Was it Joust that you guys were saying takes

728
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Like four days to meet the record?

729
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
That's the arcade version

730
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
67 hours or something like that

731
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Okay so it certainly has been long enough

732
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Since this news broke that they could have actually pulled it off

733
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
On the 2600 I think it was

734
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Different scoring

735
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
But yeah console versus arcade

736
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Alright

737
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Thank God too I was like

738
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Maybe I should check something before I make this purchase

739
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Because I was like okay I'm going to buy this

740
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I'm going to buy

741
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
My pants laughing

742
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
If he comes to the show and just dumps

743
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
A black tiger motherboard on the table

744
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
God dammit

745
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Seriously let me put it this way

746
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Rob if I was to buy a black tiger

747
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Board I would be breaking the world record regardless

748
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Of you know

749
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
It's a thing I forgot

750
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Now it's a thing

751
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
You talked about this last week it's a thing

752
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Exactly alright anyways I'm done

753
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Are you sure you're done?

754
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Oh Dark Soccer I thought of something else

755
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
No I'm very sad because Joe Kubert

756
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
What?

757
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Joe Kubert died

758
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And who was he?

759
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Uh born 1926

760
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Did a lot of DC stuff

761
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Well that means he lived a pretty full life though

762
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
26 that's

763
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I thought for a second there she was saying Joe Kubert

764
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And I was like is that his first name?

765
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I kind of thought that's what she said at first too

766
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
But then I'm looking over her shoulder

767
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
At Tumblr and I'm like no

768
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
And he did like a lot of Superman

769
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Well I mean sorry to hear he passed

770
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Yeah

771
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
We actually unfortunately have news about another passing

772
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
But we'll get to that a little later in the show

773
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Because I don't want to down the show too much

774
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Because I want to talk about my gaming week

775
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And there's three games I want to talk about this week

776
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
First off on the iOS platforms

777
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Pitfall which I guess is the 30th anniversary

778
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Edition Pitfall or what have you

779
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
They really should just call this game

780
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Temple Run 2

781
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Because that's exactly what this game is

782
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
It is Temple Run 2

783
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
The only connection

784
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
To the original 8-bit Atari 2600

785
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Version of Pitfall

786
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
The little opening movie you see it for 5 seconds

787
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And then it transforms into

788
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
The new Pitfall

789
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
So wasn't there a marketplace

790
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Or something like that out there that said

791
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
They were going to try to eliminate

792
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Kind of these copycat games

793
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Was that Android or something like that?

794
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Well technically

795
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
You're not supposed to have them on iOS

796
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
But it's Atari

797
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
We're going to let them slide

798
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Activision in this case, even better

799
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
It's just enough different than Temple Run

800
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
That it's not really a copycat

801
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I mean you still have the sliding

802
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
To turn around, you slide up to jump

803
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
You slide down to go over the tunnel

804
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
But now you tap the screen

805
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
To whip snakes that might be standing in your path

806
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Which the original Pitfall did have snakes

807
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
So they kind of figured out a way to

808
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Incorporate that

809
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Now I will say this, to the game's credit

810
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
The graphics are above and beyond

811
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
What Temple Run's got going on

812
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Not that Temple Run's a bad looking game

813
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
But you play it so much you kind of see the same thing over and over

814
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
The cool thing about Pitfall is that the

815
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Environments start to get varied

816
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Like you get to a certain length in the game

817
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And now when you get to 2500 meters or whatever

818
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Now you start running through a cave

819
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
And it's like drastically different looking

820
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
And then I know in the box teaser

821
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
The teaser images that are out there

822
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
There's one that's like a minecart in a fire cavern type of thing

823
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
So that's kind of cool that they varied it a little bit

824
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
As well as when you start the game

825
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
It's kind of like from the side

826
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And then like the camera rotates

827
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
To be behind you more like Temple Run

828
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Like the way the engine works

829
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It seems like it's capable of more

830
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Graphically than Temple Run is

831
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
But um

832
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
If the graphics were that great

833
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
You shouldn't have frame skipping happen

834
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Especially in a game where

835
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
You know, precision is key

836
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
And the frame skipping kind of screws it up

837
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And here's the other thing about Pitfall

838
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Like Temple Run, you have all these

839
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Mini transactions that you can do

840
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Within the game

841
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Pay 99 cents for a token

842
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And you can continue from where you left off

843
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Or pay 99 cents for diamonds

844
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And you can dress Pitfall Harry up in a bear

845
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Costume or a pirate

846
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Or a tooth fairy

847
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I kid you not, you can dress him up

848
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
It's just called fairy

849
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
You can dress him up as a fairy

850
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Can you do pretty princess or something?

851
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I don't know because I'm not going to pay the money to do it

852
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Now I guess technically you can

853
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Grind the silver bars

854
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Which are basically the version of coins or whatever

855
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
But it always leaves a

856
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Bad taste in my mouth when you ask me

857
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
To pay for the game up front and then you

858
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Try to shove these transactions down my throat

859
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And I do not like

860
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
These constant pop-up messages

861
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
That are like, don't you want to spend money

862
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
To continue from this point?

863
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Don't you want to buy a costume? No!

864
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I don't!

865
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
But he doesn't look like a fairy yet

866
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Don't you want to play as a fairy?

867
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I am hating

868
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Based on the fact that you have Grindr

869
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Installed on your iPhone, we think you might like

870
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
This costume

871
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
But look, I don't like this whole

872
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And I will never turn

873
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Push notifications on for these things

874
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Either

875
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
So that's the other thing

876
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
If I had those on, I'm sure I'd be getting messages

877
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
At two o'clock in the morning

878
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Don't you want macaw tokens?

879
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
We miss you, don't you want to play some more?

880
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
So I kind of hate

881
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
This whole free-to-play thing

882
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Is just, I mean, I realize

883
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
It's not really free, it's still 99 cents to get the game

884
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
It's not free

885
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
It's still paying money for it

886
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Just wait until it goes free, if you even want to play it

887
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Yeah, uh, Temple Run is free

888
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
It's pretty much the same game

889
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
But Pitfall has some varied environments, that's all

890
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
You gotta do it free so you can pay those microtransactions

891
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I'm just, if I'm gonna pay the money

892
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
For those transactions, maybe we should do something

893
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
About the frame skip, can I pay 99 cents

894
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
To have a smooth running game? Thanks

895
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Alright, meanwhile

896
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
That's enough about that, other games I played this week

897
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
So for 20 bucks at Fry's

898
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
On sale or clearance or whatever

899
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I got Connect Disneyland Adventures

900
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Cause, you know, this game came out last holiday season

901
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And it's Disneyland

902
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And I consider myself a bit of a Disney affectionato

903
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
So I wanted to check this game out

904
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
And I played this game

905
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I played it for a good

906
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Hour or so

907
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
And this is where I really, truly realized

908
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
That I hate the fucking Connect

909
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I really

910
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Like

911
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
It really is the same mistake all over again

912
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Like what we have with the eye toy

913
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
It's miserable to control

914
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
It is an absolute miserable experience to control this game

915
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
It's like, you have to hold your hand out

916
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
To turn

917
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
You have to put your hand out this way to go forward

918
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And then

919
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Like, if I want to do a hug

920
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I'm supposed to reach out

921
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And try to hug

922
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
But then it'll think I'm dancing

923
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Instead and like all this stuff

924
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I'm just like, can't I just pick up the controller and play

925
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Like, I realize the name of the game

926
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Is Connect Disneyland Adventures

927
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
But for a bunch of cute minigames

928
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
About a place I really love

929
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
You know what, I'll pay 20 bucks for the controller experience

930
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Can we just take the Connect part out?

931
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
No

932
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
You can't disable the Connect in this game, unfortunately

933
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I think that's too bad

934
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I really do think the killer app for Connect

935
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Is, uh, dancing games

936
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And that's pretty much it

937
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
It's really the only thing that succeeds on that

938
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And even then

939
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Dance Central and maybe Dance Paradise

940
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Although that game has it's issues

941
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Just Dance

942
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Isn't bad either

943
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Anyway

944
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
So I don't know, like

945
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I also have to remember this game is made for kids

946
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And here I am

947
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
30 and 100 years old and I'm playing the game

948
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
It doesn't matter though, I mean that's even worse

949
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Because kids don't have patience at all

950
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
So if something's

951
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Going wrong or it's not working they're just gonna

952
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Kick the TV or throw

953
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Throw the Connect through the window

954
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Frisbee in our chat

955
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Room at live.vognetwork.com says

956
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
You have to walk around Disneyland like a zombie

957
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
With your arms out, totally true

958
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
That is, you have to kinda like walk

959
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
You can't really do both hands out at the same time

960
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Because then the game doesn't understand if you're trying

961
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
To go left or right, but it's just silly

962
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Black Wolf

963
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
From the Bobby Black Wolf show

964
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Which tapes before us at VOG Network says

965
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
The killer apps for Connect are all the

966
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Non-games like hospital apps

967
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
No, obviously those are killer apps for the

968
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
PC because the PC

969
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
The PC can handle the bandwidth

970
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
And they can basically, I think it's like double

971
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
The data you get from the Connect versus

972
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
The Xbox 360 which has to

973
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Share the bus between all the USB ports

974
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
On the actual system so it's

975
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Limited to what you can do

976
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
So yes, all the

977
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Hacks are, you know, where it's at

978
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
But they're gonna try to sell you

979
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
On Connect 2, they're gonna say it's better than the last time

980
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
But

981
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Just like they told me it was better than the vision camera

982
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And that was better than the eye toy

983
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
It's like ehhhh

984
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Here's the tragic thing about Connect Disneyland

985
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Adventures is that I actually

986
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
You know, despite the fact that the game is made for

987
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Kids, as somebody who really loves Disneyland

988
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I really did kinda like just walking

989
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Around the virtual park, it's a pretty decent

990
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Recreation of the park, I mean you can't

991
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Go in every store or whatever, but

992
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I mean they have the frickin' corn dog cart

993
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Represented in the game

994
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
This way for corn dogs

995
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
And it's kinda fun to see the characters that are out there

996
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
And I like that they have the churro ride

997
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
They have churro carts

998
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
But you can't really do anything

999
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
There's lots of characters to find

1000
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
They have a

1001
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
World of Warcraft-esque, believe it or not

1002
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Questing type thing

1003
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Like you find Mickey and Mickey will be like

1004
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Hello, find Goofy's autograph

1005
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
It's interesting

1006
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
But it's ruined by the Connect

1007
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
It needs the people movers and that'd be awesome

1008
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Because in the world of

1009
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Connect Disneyland Adventures, people aren't

1010
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Dumb and can't fall off those things

1011
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Or to have the gondolas again

1012
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
It would be even better if you could have like archival

1013
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Videos of Disney or Disney ride

1014
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Videos or something that I know Disney would never

1015
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Allow to be put in there, but I just think it

1016
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Really enhanced the experience

1017
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Like, I think this idea should be

1018
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Revisited without the Connect at some point

1019
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Seriously, I really

1020
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Wanted to like this game

1021
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
But I don't

1022
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And that makes me very sad

1023
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I definitely agree that the killer apps for the

1024
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Connect are hospital apps

1025
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Oh, I'm putting this scalpel forward

1026
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Crap!

1027
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Thanks Bobby

1028
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
That's the other thing that would be interesting

1029
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Because you know how we always have these apps that are like

1030
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Okay, look, I got this game to work with Connect

1031
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I want to see the opposite, I want to see Connect games

1032
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Working with a controller

1033
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Okay, rdgsinge

1034
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
In our chat room has a good comment too

1035
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
The move of Eden was good, right?

1036
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
No!

1037
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Not with Connect as the controller

1038
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
With the controller it was great

1039
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
The Connect thing was interesting to play once

1040
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Kamehameha!

1041
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Kamehameha!

1042
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Yeah, but it wasn't super responsive

1043
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Apparently the PS3 version is pretty good with the move

1044
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Because the move

1045
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Sadly enough

1046
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Isn't it tragic that the move actually ends up being a pretty good peripheral

1047
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
With no one curve?

1048
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
The move is actually a really good peripheral

1049
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
It seriously is an excellent peripheral

1050
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
And it works

1051
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
But the thing is, no one fucking cares

1052
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
It's like Sports Champions

1053
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
It worked pretty much the entire time

1054
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Yeah, you had to calibrate it a couple times

1055
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
But that was super quick

1056
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
And you still have to fucking calibrate shit in the Connect

1057
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
But on Connect you have Lady Gaga

1058
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
So everybody's like

1059
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Oh, Connect!

1060
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Yep

1061
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Anyhow, one more game I want to talk about tonight

1062
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Sound Shapes

1063
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Which is uh

1064
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Sorry, that's the spouse

1065
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Did that go over the air?

1066
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
You just got an extra life?

1067
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Apparently for plugging Sound Shapes I got a 1up

1068
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Oh, Dan is evil, my husband's evil

1069
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
One of our yogurt places has Nutella frozen yogurt

1070
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
That sounds great

1071
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Now put your phone on vibrate

1072
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Alright

1073
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
469

1074
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Alien dildo

1075
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Alright, Sound Shapes

1076
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
On the Vita and the PS3

1077
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Which I love that you buy it on one

1078
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And you get it on both

1079
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
How it should be

1080
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I didn't love that the cloud syncing isn't really working

1081
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Or at least it wasn't early in the week when I played it

1082
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
But supposedly

1083
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
You're going to be able to have one save file across the two

1084
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
But whatever, I was at least able to play the game

1085
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Is it a music game?

1086
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Kinda

1087
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
But it's not a music game where

1088
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
A note is falling and you do something

1089
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
When the note hits the line

1090
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
That's the neat thing about it

1091
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I mean, don't get me wrong, I love those kinds of games

1092
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Clearly, however

1093
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I'm ready for something kinda different

1094
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
And the cool thing about Sound Shapes is, it's kinda different

1095
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I think it's like a music game like Pot upon was a music game

1096
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Not even that

1097
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
It's just that the things that you collect

1098
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
The music is all in the stage design

1099
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
That's what it really boils down to

1100
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
The stage design is where the music

1101
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
It's not necessarily you

1102
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Interacting with the music

1103
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
It's the environments interacting with the music

1104
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Which is what's kinda cool

1105
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
It's almost more Child of Eden and Res like

1106
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
In that regard

1107
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Since those games were brought up

1108
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I would say those would be a better comparison actually

1109
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
But this is more like a Little Big Planet style game

1110
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
And the game that this has the most in common with

1111
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Not just Little Big Planet

1112
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
It's Super Meat Boy

1113
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
In a way

1114
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Because it's that whole idea of

1115
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
You can die very easy

1116
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
But you just start from the last checkpoint

1117
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
And try to get over these very difficult parts

1118
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Over and over and over again

1119
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
There are stages in the game that are just

1120
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Really cool

1121
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Like the Beck stage

1122
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Beck has three stages

1123
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
That first Beck stage is like the equivalent

1124
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Of Shinen in Luminous

1125
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Like really

1126
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
It's like the defining moment

1127
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
When you're playing the game

1128
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Because the song kinda goes

1129
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
It's going along and then the lyrics

1130
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
One part of the lyrics goes

1131
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Move a little

1132
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Turn a little

1133
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
And like while the lyrics are doing that

1134
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
The little platforms

1135
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
It moves a little

1136
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Then it turns a little

1137
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Then it breaks apart a little

1138
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
And then when it goes hurt a little

1139
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
It turns red which is the bad thing color

1140
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Which will kill you if you're still standing on it

1141
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
And like when I was playing that I was like

1142
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
That's so cool

1143
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And even Alan was watching over my shoulder

1144
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And like just the little

1145
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
He'll just sing this ahhh

1146
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Thing in the background

1147
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
That you can use that say ahhh

1148
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
On them and just like playing that stage

1149
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Was just so cool

1150
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Like it was neat

1151
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
And that's how it kind of interacts with the music

1152
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
It's very much the environment

1153
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Otherwise it's kind of a platformer

1154
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
And it plays a lot like Meat Boy or Little Big Planet

1155
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Obviously because of the online element

1156
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Is a huge part of it too

1157
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
All these stages you can get online

1158
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
That people have made

1159
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
All their own levels and so forth

1160
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Is that very Little Big Planet element

1161
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Just like Little Big Planet

1162
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
90% of them suck

1163
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
But it's kind of neat to see what people

1164
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Come up with. I think the online mode

1165
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Could have been implemented a little better

1166
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
It is early on

1167
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I think the interface doesn't work too well

1168
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
For the online mode but

1169
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
At least you can kind of track what your friends

1170
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Are doing and that gives me hope that there's

1171
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Something a little better

1172
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
In there somewhere

1173
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
But overall it's a game, shit it's a great deal

1174
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
You get the game on two platforms

1175
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
It's only 12 bucks

1176
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
It's kind of limited

1177
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
By the number of stages that are actually in the game

1178
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I think there's about maybe

1179
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
15 stages in the game

1180
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
But it's only a $15 game

1181
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
And you do have the online stuff which is virtually unlimited

1182
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I think it's pretty good

1183
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I had a good time with it

1184
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
So

1185
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
This is sounding like Sound Shapes is a music game

1186
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Like New Super Mario Brothers is a music game

1187
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Lots of colorful interactivity

1188
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Admittedly with Sound Shapes

1189
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
More things are happening as a result

1190
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
But with New Super Mario Brothers

1191
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
One of the cutest parts of the game was the fact that

1192
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
The backgrounds and everything else would

1193
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Have very distinctive cues

1194
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
That go along with the music and then things like the Yoshi

1195
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
That add the new rhythm and what not

1196
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
It was a really

1197
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
It was one of the best aspects of that reboot

1198
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Actually, yes, I didn't even think of that

1199
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
But you're right

1200
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
The music in New Super Mario Brothers

1201
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Was really under appreciated

1202
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Yeah, there is kind of an element to that with it

1203
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
You know that goes all the way back to the original

1204
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Super Mario Brothers

1205
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I'm sorry, not the original, the original Super Mario

1206
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
World on the Super Nintendo

1207
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Because whenever you got Yoshi

1208
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
You would have that little drum beat

1209
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Oh yeah, that aspect of it, yeah

1210
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I'm thinking of like the normal

1211
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
The hills will be dancing along the background

1212
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Oh yeah, I love the way the little Koopas

1213
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Yeah, the way the little Koopas go

1214
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
The little dance is so adorable

1215
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
New Super Mario Brothers was a great game

1216
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
And I can't wait for two

1217
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Loki might have a word to say about that

1218
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Alright

1219
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Coming up on this episode of Orange Laundry

1220
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Alright

1221
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I was reading Kickstarter

1222
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Not paying attention at all

1223
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Again, alright, so I do recommend Sound Shapes

1224
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
You don't even necessarily have to like music games

1225
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Because it's not really a music game

1226
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
It's a platformer that incorporates music elements

1227
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
And I think that's a really good way

1228
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
You know, it's that New Super Mario Brothers

1229
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Wii cranked up to 11

1230
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
In a way, so

1231
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
That's a review I write for VOG Network later this week

1232
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
So I'm gonna steal that

1233
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I need a few points for that, I think

1234
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
VX JasonXV, contribute to this report

1235
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I'll see what I can do, alright

1236
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Moving on, speaking of Jason

1237
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I'll let you go next with your gaming week

1238
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
What types of video games do you play this week?

1239
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Oh boy, most of my week was lost

1240
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
By preparing for this trip

1241
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
But I will say that when I was on the train

1242
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I was trying to play things that

1243
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I didn't think would be particularly susceptible

1244
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
To interference by the train

1245
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Rocking back and forth, yeah I was wrong

1246
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Limbo, Cave Story

1247
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Braid, and other various

1248
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Puzzle, platforming, adventure kind of things

1249
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I thought that I could

1250
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Manage, but with as violent

1251
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
As the train gets, especially in like Nevada

1252
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
My hands were completely off the keyboard

1253
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Flying all over the place

1254
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Couple DS games

1255
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
A friend of mine let me borrow

1256
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Kid Icarus Uprising, and so

1257
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Now my hands are completely cramped

1258
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Because it's just, like the

1259
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Original DS that just doesn't fit

1260
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
My hands just don't fit that system very well

1261
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I've been trying some of the alternative

1262
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Control configurations, but then you

1263
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Lose all precision and the game just

1264
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Gets bad. I wonder if it's gonna feel better

1265
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
On the XL that's coming out very soon

1266
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I've been considering hitting the Best Buy

1267
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
To see if they have Kid Icarus

1268
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
On demo and see if that alleviates

1269
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
The problems, but I think that

1270
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I think the size

1271
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Of the DS is wrong, but the bulk

1272
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
The weight of the XL will be too much

1273
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
And it'll just cause the same thing to happen

1274
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I don't know

1275
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I finally got

1276
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Starcraft working on my computer again

1277
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Since Mountain Lion kind of broke a couple things

1278
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
My Diablo's still busted, but my Starcraft 2

1279
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Is working again, that's

1280
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Pretty much the week in a nutshell

1281
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Let me go over to Ryan, check in

1282
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
How her gaming week was

1283
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
It's okay, you don't play Diablo anyway

1284
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
You're about to make up for it

1285
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Yes, I've been playing a lot of

1286
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Diablo, it's kind of my social hour

1287
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I also picked up

1288
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Kingdom Hearts, the 3DS version

1289
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I just barely started it

1290
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Otherwise, just kind of

1291
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
The find me and the

1292
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Puzzle stuff, because I just picked up my 3DS

1293
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
This last week

1294
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Which is that amazingly awesome purple color

1295
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I'm sorry, there's a part of me that wants to go sell

1296
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Like, I'm having such a Shane moment

1297
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I really hope he's listening

1298
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Because I am having a total Shane moment

1299
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Because the minute I saw that DS, I'm like

1300
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I'm about ready to take my DS and sell it in

1301
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
And get that purple one

1302
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
And the XL is on its way out

1303
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
If I'm going to get a new 3DS

1304
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I need to get that one

1305
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
That's the prettiest color handheld

1306
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I think I've ever seen

1307
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
For real

1308
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
It was one of those things that I told myself

1309
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
If the purple one came stateside

1310
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
That was going to be the one that I got

1311
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Kind of held off for the color that I liked

1312
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
And of course, Kingdom Hearts came out the next week

1313
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
So, yeah

1314
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Good opportunity

1315
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I know you haven't played a lot of Kingdom Hearts yet

1316
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
But any early impressions

1317
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
From what you have played?

1318
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
It's a lot to take in

1319
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
In the very beginning

1320
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I'm still struggling with all the new

1321
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
All the new things that you can do with it

1322
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
And by the way

1323
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I have a supporter in our chat room

1324
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
JV Mon says the purple 3DS is beautiful

1325
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I'm right with you, Rob

1326
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Thank you

1327
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
At least it's not just me

1328
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Kingdom Hearts

1329
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Kingdom Hearts

1330
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I saw this hilarious thing floating around Facebook

1331
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Which was literally a 40 page Google doc

1332
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
To try and explain the plot

1333
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
With pictures and arrows

1334
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Is that the type of thing we have going on in the intro?

1335
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Sort of

1336
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
It has its own little tutorials

1337
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
For each little thing

1338
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
It's just so much to take in so quickly

1339
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
It's

1340
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
And this is a kids series

1341
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
This is like a soap opera for kids

1342
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
And adults

1343
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
A lot of adults playing this game

1344
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I think the first one was kind of marketed at kids

1345
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Probably, and it's Disney

1346
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Who else would the target market be?

1347
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
The official Disney parks continue

1348
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
To ignore Kingdom Hearts

1349
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Makes me so sad

1350
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Anything else for your gaming week, Ry?

1351
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Not really

1352
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Alright, well you throw something at me

1353
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
If you want the mic to say something a little later

1354
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
In the meantime, I'm going to plug

1355
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Some things around the interwebs

1356
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
To register participation

1357
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000

00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000

To visit our home station

1366

The Voice of Geeks Network

1367
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Vognetwork.com

1368
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Lots of great programming throughout the week

1369
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
On that website

1370
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
If I'm able to get my work done tonight

1371
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
We're going to have a little more music

1372
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
And rotation. I'm adding a little bit more to the

1373
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Music rotation for this week

1374
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
For those folks that are actually listening

1375
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
And playing games

1376
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
To the VoG network

1377
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I posted something in the forums about how you can play

1378
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Beat Hazard

1379
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
You can actually use internet radio on Beat Hazard

1380
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Well you can load VoG Network as one of the custom

1381
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Stations and play Beat Hazard

1382
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
To the music on VoG

1383
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Or, if you're so daring, you can play to an

1384
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Episode of Orange Lounge Radio or Pod Culture

1385
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Or Girls Gone Wow or whatever

1386
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
During the week. It's kind of fun

1387
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
A little weird, but fun

1388
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Alright, let's get into some gaming

1389
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
News now that we're an hour into the show

1390
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Loki. Sounds good. Alright

1391
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
So let's talk a little bit about

1392
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
What could possibly be the worst thing that

1393
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Happened with gaming ever

1394
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Windows 8

1395
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
At least according to a lot of people

1396
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
But, something else that they're adding

1397
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
To some of the games that you may waste time

1398
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
With in Windows

1399
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
They're adding achievements

1400
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
To the games you know

1401
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
And love from back from

1402
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Windows 3.1 I can get 20

1403
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Points for beating Solitaire

1404
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Yes Yes You can now get

1405
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Achievements for Minesweeper, Solitaire, and

1406
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Mahjong But if you

1407
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Want more deck backs, you're gonna have to spend

1408
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Microsoft Space Bucks

1409
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
In order to unlock

1410
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Watch. Fucking watch

1411
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I'm

1412
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Not upgrading

1413
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Do you want mine hints for Minesweeper?

1414
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Here's what I wanna know

1415
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Do you want new faces that will explode

1416
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
When you click on a mine? Where is that

1417
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Go-kart game or that

1418
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Was it the bumper card game

1419
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
From XP? Why do

1420
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I not see that listed there?

1421
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I forgot about that game, damn

1422
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
That game is awesome

1423
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
XP, that was 95 plus

1424
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Oh yeah, oh yeah

1425
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
What about that? And

1426
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
While we're at it, you know, what about

1427
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Didn't they have a bunch of Windows games like

1428
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
There was Chips Challenge? Where's Chips

1429
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Challenge? I want some more Chips Challenge

1430
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
That was a fun game

1431
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Maybe that will come in Windows 8

1432
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Service Pack 1 But like, they also

1433
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Had all those, like, was it the

1434
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
All the different Solitaire games and Mahjong

1435
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Games and stuff like that that came with that pack

1436
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
It was just like, eh So how are you feeling

1437
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
About Windows 8, Loki? Are you kind of in the

1438
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
It stinks camp, but you're an achievement

1439
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Whore? No, I'm not

1440
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Not to that You used to be

1441
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I used to be, I'm a recovery achievement whore

1442
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Well, admitting you have a

1443
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Problem is the first step No, I honestly

1444
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Windows 8 does not look

1445
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Good at all to me

1446
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I mean, there's nothing so far that's told me that I need

1447
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
It's gonna be for me, it's kind of like one of those

1448
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Intermediate, you know

1449
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Versions, like, I didn't jump on Vista

1450
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
And I went to 7, so I'm thinking that

1451
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Windows 9 or whatever the next one's gonna be

1452
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
It'll probably be a little bit better for me

1453
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Um, yeah, actually that's kind of the way it's been

1454
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
You know, I've always skipped, you know

1455
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
A generation, I didn't do

1456
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I didn't do 95 to 98

1457
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Skipped ME, went to XP

1458
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Skipped Vista

1459
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Went to 7, so, yeah, this'll be

1460
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
This'll be the operating system I skip

1461
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Windows 8

1462
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Is interesting

1463
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
That's kind of the reaction I have to it, but

1464
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Interesting is also the word I use to describe

1465
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
The commercial for Boo Boo Honey Child

1466
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Whatever that show is on TLC

1467
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
So, um, I don't know, take from that what you will

1468
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
It would be cool, Windows 8

1469
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Would be a better operating system

1470
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
If touch screen monitors

1471
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Were more mainstream

1472
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Like, if my laptop

1473
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Had a touch screen monitor on it

1474
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Then yeah, Windows 8 would be pretty awesome

1475
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Because you can do all the touch screen stuff, but

1476
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I just don't think it's

1477
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Necessary right now

1478
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Alright, before we get to the next story, let's go to some comments

1479
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
From our chat room at

1480
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Vognetwork.com

1481
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
DarkSakura, why didn't you say this in a microphone?

1482
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
She says, I do believe

1483
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
There is Kingdom Hearts stuff at Disney C

1484
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
So, correcting what I said earlier

1485
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
About why does Disney ignore the

1486
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Kingdom Hearts

1487
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Because this is America!

1488
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
America! America!

1489
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
We won the most gold, deal with it

1490
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
And I really wasn't saying it in reply to you

1491
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I was saying it to somebody in chat

1492
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Yeah, Rob

1493
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Let's see, and uh

1494
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Excuse me, AlphaKnanogram is correcting me

1495
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Whatever I said, it's Honey Boo Boo

1496
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Here comes Honey Boo Boo, that's not my pad

1497
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I'm so sorry

1498
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Porkchop says, who the fuck plays

1499
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Minesweeper anymore?

1500
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Um, you know

1501
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
True story, I work in an adult

1502
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Training environment, I teach

1503
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
You know, adults in a corporate

1504
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
World basically, like how to do their jobs

1505
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
And if we ever get people coming through the door

1506
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
That aren't very comfortable

1507
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
With using a computer, because sometimes you get

1508
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Some like, retired folks

1509
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
That want to take like, kind of a new job

1510
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Or a new career

1511
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
And they might not be as seasoned with computers

1512
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Or whatever, we will actually assign them to go

1513
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Home and play solitaire

1514
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
To get better use with a mouse

1515
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
And kind of get that coordination, it's a very

1516
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Good way to

1517
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
You know, kind of get used to that

1518
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Whole hand-eye coordination, which

1519
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Many of us take for granted, we all grew up

1520
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
On that stuff, but for people that didn't

1521
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Grow up on it and kind of have to learn it

1522
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Solitaire is actually a great way to learn it

1523
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Just, you know, think about it that way

1524
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
And then when they come back and tell you, okay, I played

1525
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Solitaire with my card deck, how's that supposed to

1526
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Teach me computers, is this some sort of

1527
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Crazy karate kid thing where I go

1528
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Wax a car and I'm supposed to learn

1529
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Kung-Fu, is that how it's gonna work?

1530
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
If I ever had a student say, it's a crazy

1531
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Karate kid thing, I'd just give them

1532
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
An A. Alright

1533
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Let's be real

1534
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Alright, uh, move

1535
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
What else do I want to say, uh, oh

1536
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Good chat, yes, thank you, the other comment

1537
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
From GameGuru in our chatroom says

1538
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I see you are playing Solitaire

1539
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Would you like special Clippy themed backs

1540
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
For the game?

1541
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Go to hell

1542
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
This is an honest question because I don't know how to

1543
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Do this, is there any way to turn off

1544
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Beacons from other people, because

1545
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Let's be honest, I have someone that's on my friends list

1546
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Probably one of our listeners that has a beacon

1547
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
That says, hey, I want friends to play

1548
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Minecraft, cool

1549
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I know that already, I'm already playing

1550
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Minecraft when I get your stupid notification

1551
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Yeah, I never realized those things stay on like

1552
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Forever, because I have- How do I turn that off?

1553
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I think I had one set for like, Mass Effect 3

1554
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Or something, I don't know, it's just like, everybody's like

1555
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Gets a little beep

1556
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I remember when I learned about how terrible

1557
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
The notification system is, that I shut

1558
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Mine off, in order to

1559
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Not get them from your friends, I

1560
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Don't think that's possible

1561
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
De-friend them, maybe

1562
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
No, don't do that

1563
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Why don't you just send them a message that says, fuck you, you fucking

1564
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Fuck, turn your beak off

1565
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I'm already playing it, why don't you come play it?

1566
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
You wanna play apparently

1567
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Alright, let's uh

1568
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Move on with some more news

1569
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
And that would be me, talking about Amazon

1570
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Game Studios

1571
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Yeah, you know, Amazon, the website

1572
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
That used to sell books

1573
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Sorry, I love Rageinator's comment

1574
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
What was that? If Windows 8 is interesting, then by that definition

1575
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
So is a lobotomy and colostomy bag

1576
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Fascinating

1577
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Anyhow

1578
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Also interesting, Amazon

1579
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Game Studios

1580
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Uh, yeah, Amazon of course, you know

1581
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
They used to sell books and only books

1582
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
And now they sell books and

1583
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Groceries

1584
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
And probably sex toys

1585
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
For all I know, probably Alien Dildos

1586
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Probably has a shop front on Amazon.com

1587
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I'm not sure, but

1588
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
You can't buy vibrators on Amazon

1589
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
For the listeners here

1590
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I was looking up

1591
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Vibrators on Amazon

1592
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Think of an excuse, quick

1593
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Mass Effect 3

1594
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I was looking up Mass Effect

1595
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
For the record, I know this because

1596
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
When I was a massage therapist, I was looking up

1597
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Electronic heat packs for necks

1598
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
And it came to a list of personal

1599
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Vibration assistants

1600
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
You want happy ending?

1601
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
No

1602
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
No

1603
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
No

1604
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Yay, happy

1605
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Alright, so Amazon

1606
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
They've sold books, they've sold vibrators

1607
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
And now they sell games

1608
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
But I don't mean, like obviously Amazon sold games

1609
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Already and even on the phones and so forth

1610
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Now they're making them too, Amazon

1611
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Game Studios

1612
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
The first game that they have launched is

1613
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Living Classics

1614
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I guess it's a hidden object game

1615
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
But they're calling it a moving object game

1616
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Alright, guess what, it's a Facebook

1617
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Game

1618
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Yeah, looks amazing, here's the trailer

1619
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
We can look at for Living Classics here

1620
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
The launch trailer

1621
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Oh, you can find

1622
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Moving objects

1623
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Oh

1624
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
That looks like a waste of time

1625
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Perfect for Facebook

1626
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
By the way, Amazon

1627
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Is hiring and

1628
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Alright, good luck with that Amazon

1629
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Let's just hope you make some games that I want to play

1630
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Out of curiosity, I went ahead and looked up

1631
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Electronic heat packs

1632
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
On Amazon

1633
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
And they have the weirdest shit

1634
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
There's no vibrators, but there's like screws

1635
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
The Sims

1636
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
NASCAR 2002

1637
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
The Sims?

1638
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
NASCAR Thunder 2002

1639
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
How the fuck does that have anything to do with electronic heat packs?

1640
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
There was some kind of bullet casing

1641
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Or something in there too

1642
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
And vibrating in it

1643
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Whatever

1644
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Let's move on with some more new Star Sakura

1645
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I was looking at vibrating heating pads

1646
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Oh, well there you go, vibrating

1647
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
They're

1648
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Really good to loosen up someone's neck

1649
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Before you work on them

1650
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Or loosen up someone's

1651
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Never mind

1652
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
469

1653
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
You're all children

1654
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Yeah, speaking of ten years ago

1655
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Well, how about

1656
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Some Silent Hill news which has nothing to do with

1657
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Vibrations and everything to do

1658
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
With a dead nurse rape

1659
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Okay

1660
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Well, it's true

1661
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Red Pyramid

1662
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Anyway

1663
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
As we all know, Silent Hill

1664
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
HD Collection is shit

1665
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Because it was built from unfinished code

1666
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
End of story

1667
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Well, there's going to be a patch out that's only available on PS3

1668
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
So, uh

1669
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
People who got it on Xbox 360

1670
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
You screwed, Konami don't care

1671
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Boohoo, go cry a river

1672
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Build a bridge and jump off it

1673
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
What's that?

1674
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
But I was reading something that

1675
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
As long as you have your receipt, you're able to send it back to

1676
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Konami and they will send you

1677
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
A new version of the disc

1678
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Okay, but Silent Hill HD Collection

1679
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Came out in what, March?

1680
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Who still has their receipt?

1681
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
You've got to be one of those anal retentive people

1682
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
That actually went and bought a receipt scanner

1683
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
So that way you can scan

1684
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Your different receipts in here

1685
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
So what if you buy it now

1686
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
And then show them a receipt

1687
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
And then you have them send you a free game on top of that

1688
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Well, let me read

1689
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
From the official news source

1690
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Facebook

1691
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
And Konami's page

1692
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Attention Silent Hill fans

1693
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
If you purchase Silent Hill HD Collection

1694
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
For the Xbox 360 new and from a

1695
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Recognized retailer

1696
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Oh, so that's how they're going to get around it

1697
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
A recognized retailer

1698
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Oh, we don't know about this GameStop shit

1699
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
And still have the original receipt

1700
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Please send the receipt to Konami

1701
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Customer service for verification

1702
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Further details, it's only valid for

1703
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Silent Hill HD Collection

1704
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Xbox 360 version games purchased

1705
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
On or before August 8th

1706
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
On or before August 8th, Loki

1707
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
All requests must be made in

1708
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Writing and submitted on or before

01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
October 7th and it is subject to

1710
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Availability

1711
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Well they're screwed because no one knows how to write anymore

1712
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Can't we just comment on the Facebook post

1713
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
But it does say note the patch for Silent Hill

1714
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Downpour for both Xbox

1715
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
360 and Playstation 3

1716
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Is currently in development

1717
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
And scheduled for a release at a later date

1718
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
How about this, why didn't they just finish the damn

1719
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Version

1720
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
How about you just make it right the first time

1721
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
I'm glad I didn't buy it

1722
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
I still have Silent Hill 3 the good version

1723
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
And that's all I care about

1724
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
JVMON in chat says I keep all

1725
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
My receipts, really?

1726
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Ragingator says I have receipts dating back

1727
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
To 2002 and Stan says

1728
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
I keep my game receipts for some reason

1729
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Wow, I'm just

1730
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Actually, Dan and I used to save all of our receipts

1731
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
For the electronics that we bought, we still have the receipt

1732
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
For my Wacom

1733
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I understand, for big huge purchases I get that

1734
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Like when I bought my old TV

1735
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
At Costco, hell yeah I kept the receipt

1736
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Because Costco has an awesome return

1737
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Policy

1738
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Yeah, I mean they used to

1739
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Knowing things like that, hell yeah

1740
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I'll keep the receipt, but

1741
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I don't really ever save them for games

1742
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Maybe I ought to start

1743
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Dan still has his box for his DS that has a post-it note on it

1744
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
That says, this is Dan's DS, don't buy it

1745
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
I also love this

1746
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
When we talk about recognized retailers

1747
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Monty Boggs in our chat room

1748
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
At live.vognetwork.com says

1749
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Kmart? The fuck is Kmart denied?

1750
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Hey, I bought a Sonic shirt there

1751
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
That's about it

1752
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I bought, I bought

1753
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
A Super Mario Brothers shirt

1754
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
There, I was very happy

1755
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Jvmon in our chat says

1756
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
I still have the receipts for those Dunkin Donuts

1757
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
K-Cups I got you, lol

1758
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I drank one

1759
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Yeah, don't take this the wrong way

1760
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Because the Dunkin Donuts K-Cups were great

1761
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
But they're like half gone now

1762
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
So even if you had the receipt

1763
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
The store's not gonna take them back

1764
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
I done drunk them

1765
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
And they were terrible

1766
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Give me my money back

1767
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
No, they were good, they were good

1768
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
A little sugar, a little creamer

1769
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Apparently you don't know how this works

1770
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Grab coffee

1771
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Alright, let's move on with some more news

1772
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Hey, agreed porkchop

1773
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Please don't fuck up the Zone of the Enders HD collection

1774
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Cross his fingers

1775
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Co-sign to that

1776
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Exactly, it's like, oh hey, yeah, we don't wanna patch this

1777
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
But buy our new Zone of the Enders

1778
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Oh, and by the way

1779
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
We're still selling this

1780
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
In case you do want a broken game

1781
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
So anyways

1782
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
There was some rumored

1783
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Next-gen

1784
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Kinect images

1785
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Released on Twitter

1786
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
By a guy that goes by the name

1787
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
SuperDAE

1788
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Who also apparently has no sense of humor

1789
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Because I made a comment on his little post

1790
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
And he said, don't be an idiot

1791
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Bastard

1792
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Don't be an idiot

1793
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
I just made the comment because you know

1794
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
It's got the little neon character

1795
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
The depth map on there

1796
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
And it kind of resembles, you know

1797
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
The image from Just Dance

1798
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
And I made the comment and I'm like

1799
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Well, that's not an image from the new Kinect

1800
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
That's just from the new version of Just Dance

1801
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Apparently he has no sense of humor

1802
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Because he didn't even say haha if I were funny

1803
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
He said, don't be an idiot

1804
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Well good, I'm not gonna be an idiot

1805
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Like someone that would try to buy his

1806
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Development kit for the Durango

1807
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
That he just now put on eBay

1808
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,000
That's up to $15,000

1809
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
And basically

1810
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
You're taking his word for it

1811
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
That this is actually an Xbox Durango

1812
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Development kit

1813
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
And it looks like a PC

1814
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Because that's what the development kits look like

1815
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
And there's really nothing that guarantees you

1816
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Anyway that

1817
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
This is gonna be a development kit

1818
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Other than the fact that I think some other developers

1819
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Have a picture of it and they're like

1820
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Yeah, that looks like a development kit

1821
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
But who knows

1822
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
But yes, so we'll see if this is legit or not

1823
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Because if it is the real deal

1824
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Then Microsoft will probably pull it off of eBay

1825
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
But as of right now

1826
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
It is

1827
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Oh, it was ended early because the item was sold

1828
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
For $20,000

1829
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Well $20,000 was the last bid

1830
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
But it says the listing was ended by the seller

1831
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Because the item was sold

1832
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Interesting, so like ended early or whatever?

1833
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Yeah

1834
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Surprised you could do that with bids on it

1835
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Yeah, I didn't think you could do that, that's interesting

1836
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Now the question is

1837
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Who bought it, Gizmodo?

1838
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
We'll see

1839
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Alright

1840
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Meanwhile

1841
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Be careful

1842
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
If you are a Blizzard

1843
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Or battle.net customer

1844
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Oh yeah, that

1845
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Because guess what, they got hacked

1846
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
You know the old saying, hackers gonna hack

1847
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
But to be fair, battle.net was

1848
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Pretty upfront about what happened

1849
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Because I think we've learned from history

1850
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Don't try to hide this shit from your users

1851
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
They're smarter than that

1852
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
So Mike Morhaime, the CEO himself

1853
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Wrote a little letter that says

1854
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
You know what, even when you are in the business

1855
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Of fun, not every week ends up

1856
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Being fun

1857
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
And they found out that there was an unauthorized and illegal access

1858
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Into the network at Blizzard

1859
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
And they did confirm

1860
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
No financial information such as credit cards

1861
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Billing addresses or real names were compromised

1862
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Thank God

1863
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I was surprised they went this far

1864
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
They said some data was illegally accessed

1865
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Including a list of

1866
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Email addresses for global battle.net

1867
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Users outside of China

1868
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
For players on North American servers

1869
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Which generally includes players from

1870
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
North America, Latin America, Australia, New Zealand

1871
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
And Southeast Asia

1872
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
So instead of saying it was everybody, they said

1873
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
They targeted these specific regions

1874
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
They got the answers to

1875
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
The personal security questions

1876
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
And information relating to

1877
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Mobile and dial-in authenticators

1878
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
That's pretty bad that they got

1879
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
The personal security question answers

1880
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Because if you use those

1881
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Security question and answers on other

1882
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Sites

1883
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
It's just like having a password anyway

1884
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
It is

1885
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
So that's pretty bad

1886
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Now they do say

1887
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Cryptographically scrambled versions

1888
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Of battle.net passwords, not the actual

1889
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Passwords were taken

1890
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
But they do think with brute force

1891
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
You could decode one at a time passwords

1892
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
But who cares if you've got the

1893
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Answers to your secret questions

1894
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
You don't even need to do that

1895
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
So in the coming days they are going to prompt

1896
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Folks to change the secret questions and answers

1897
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Through an automated process

1898
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Also the mobile authenticator users will have to

1899
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Update the software and so on

1900
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
So highly recommend at this point

1901
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
If you play World of Warcraft

1902
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
If you play Diablo

1903
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
If you play Starcraft, any of those games

1904
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
They're all on battle.net

1905
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
You need to change your password

1906
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
On battle.net right away and you can do that

1907
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
At battle.net

1908
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Slash account slash management

1909
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Slash setting, you know what there's a link right there

1910
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
At battle.net

1911
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I had forgotten to do mine so I just did it

1912
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
But can you, other than changing your passwords

1913
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Because that's not going to matter if they have your secret questions

1914
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Can you change your secret questions?

1915
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Not yet

1916
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
So then what the fuck's the point

1917
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
We have an authenticator

1918
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
I don't think the secret question alone

1919
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Will get them into the account

1920
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Especially if you've got an authenticator

1921
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Attached to it

1922
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
I believe the secret question can only be used

1923
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
To generate a reset request

1924
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Which still goes to your email

1925
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
So this is the other important thing

1926
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Your email password

1927
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Needs to be unique

1928
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
This is, I mean, in a perfect world

1929
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Every password is unique

1930
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
But I understand not everybody can realistically

1931
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Do that with all the websites we sign up for

1932
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
So your email password

1933
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Needs to be unique

1934
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
This is just internet security 101

1935
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
If you do not have a unique

1936
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Email password you are setting yourself

1937
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Up for trouble because think about it

1938
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Somebody gets your battle.net password here

1939
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Or they got your Playstation password before

1940
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Your Xbox password or whatever

1941
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
They're going to use it to get in your email

1942
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Once they get in your email, you're fucked

1943
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Because all those reset requests

1944
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Everything goes back to your email

1945
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
The guy who got hacked through the whole

1946
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
iCloud reset or whatever this week

1947
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
For the record, when you do change your password

1948
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
It also does send you an email

1949
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
That says if you didn't make the change

1950
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Click the link so that you can recover your account

1951
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Well his hacking thing was a little different

1952
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
That was just security flaws with whole social

1953
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Networking and stuff like that

1954
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Basically people

1955
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Called up, added a fake credit card

1956
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
To an Amazon account and then

1957
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Called back up using that

1958
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
New credit card as

1959
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Authentication for other information

1960
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Porkchop in our

1961
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Chatroom says, anyone see that guy Francis

1962
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Rage about the hacks on YouTube

1963
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
No I didn't, but I love

1964
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
I love internet rage

1965
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
He tried to eat his authenticator

1966
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Oh that's old

1967
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
That was about

1968
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Diablo 3

1969
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
He did a new one

1970
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Because he's a persona

1971
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
It's just a persona

1972
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
It's all for hits

1973
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
It's not as funny when it's fake

1974
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
You know what's fucking hilarious is that

1975
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Twilight girl

1976
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
That's the stuff I live for

1977
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
On YouTube

1978
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Why would you cheat on him?

1979
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Why?

1980
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Really?

1981
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Oh yeah, Brittany

1982
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Really? You've never seen

1983
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
The crying chick over Twilight?

1984
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
No because I have a life

1985
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Tigerclaw, can you find me a link please?

1986
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
I need to show Jamie this

1987
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Please find me the crying

1988
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
The girl who's losing her shit over Kristen Stewart

1989
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
I usually have better stuff

1990
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
You know the best thing is

1991
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Oh she quit acting, when did she

1992
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Start?

1993
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Well Jamie if you wish

1994
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
To take us back on track then by all means

1995
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Give us another news story

1996
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Sure as fuck ain't about no talent bitch

1997
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
You know what

1998
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
I accidentally closed my story

1999
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Oh yeah here we go

2000
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
How about

2001
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Diablo

2002
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Um, it was funny

2003
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
I had a friend in Alabama who played a lot of Diablo

2004
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Except with a thick southern accent

2005
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
So it was Diablo

2006
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Blow

2007
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
So anyway

2008
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Diablo

2009
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Occasionally

2010
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
La la la la la

2011
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
I don't need to know that

2012
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Well

2013
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
How about some

2014
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Changes from Blizzard

2015
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
There's gonna be a new patch

2016
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
1.0.4

2017
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
That will be out the fourth week

2018
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Of August

2019
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
They like co-op and they want more people to do it

2020
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
So this is so that you can play more

2021
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Co-op

2022
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
They are

2023
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Trying to make things a little bit more attractive

2024
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
So they're gonna be removing the

2025
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Averaging of magic find and gold

2026
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Find in multiplayer

2027
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
So that you will benefit from full magic find

2028
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Independent of other players

2029
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Okay wait

2030
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I gotta go

2031
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Let's let Jamie finish and then I'll go to Ry for reaction

2032
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Well they added it in

2033
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
They added the averaging in so that it didn't

2034
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Involve people stacking adventure stats

2035
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
To detriment the party

2036
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
But I guess no one likes that

2037
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
I don't know I never did it

2038
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Usually anytime someone joined my game I quit

2039
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
The last

2040
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Four times I played someone joined my game

2041
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I quit

2042
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Alright let me go to the resident

2043
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Real fan girl to check in on patch news

2044
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
So that's why you said it

2045
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
So that people have to ask

2046
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I did

2047
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
They still joined my game

2048
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Really? Yes

2049
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Of course this was before any patching had been done

2050
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Gotcha

2051
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
On the whole magic find gold find

2052
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
My shit is my own

2053
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I build up my gold find

2054
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
I build up my magic find

2055
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
That shit is mine

2056
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
It should not matter what yours is

2057
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
If it's me

2058
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Then it just makes it worse for me

2059
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
So you know get out of my game

2060
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Well

2061
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
And this is why I'm still level 22

2062
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
When she has 260's

2063
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
There's more

2064
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
But wait there's more

2065
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Weapon damage is also

2066
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Going to be retooled

2067
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
So basically

2068
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
It's

2069
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I'm just going to read the quote

2070
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
That I like to make to our item

2071
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Game addresses the difference between an item having

2072
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
A chance of being good versus knowing

2073
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
The item isn't going to be good before

2074
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
You can even identify it

2075
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
So they're basically

2076
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Trying to

2077
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Have a raw damage level between

2078
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
61 and 62 weapons

2079
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
So that it can

2080
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Hit the top of 63 I think

2081
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
However they explained it

2082
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I have no idea because like I said I didn't play that much

2083
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
And then

2084
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Enraged timers are being removed

2085
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
From champion and rare monster packs

2086
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
They will still be on bosses

2087
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
But they will

2088
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Not be

2089
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Basically they don't want to have you have to do a

2090
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
DPS check

2091
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
What?

2092
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Hey

2093
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Ryaz do you know what that's getting at?

2094
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
No idea because all I know is enraged timers and wow

2095
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
So inferno is where

2096
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
They brought in enraged timers

2097
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
That if

2098
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
You don't beat an enemy

2099
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
A stack of enemies within a certain amount of time

2100
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
You'll basically start taking like poison

2101
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Damage you'll be standing there and your life

2102
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Will just drain away

2103
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
So instead of

2104
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Trying to figure out

2105
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Your strategy on how you're going to beat that group

2106
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
If you take too long it's just

2107
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Going to kill you

2108
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Wow

2109
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
That's stupid

2110
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Another thing too is that

2111
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Repair costs are going to be on high

2112
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
And items are going to be decreased by 25%

2113
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
And

2114
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
A bunch of other changes

2115
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
That are going to come out later

2116
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
It's on the development blog

2117
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Diablo 3 patch 1.04

2118
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Seal of approval by Ry

2119
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
And sorry

2120
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Still no PVP

2121
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Maybe I'll play again

2122
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
It was free why not

2123
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
I signed the blood pact

2124
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
We're going to get into release dates

2125
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
But before we do

2126
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Let's do a culture lesson

2127
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
On him and saying that she's sorry

2128
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Like that makes it okay

2129
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,000
I feel like everybody needs to back off okay

2130
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
This is none of your business

2131
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
This is none of anybody's business

2132
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
But her releasing that statement

2133
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
It's like

2134
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
It's like saying

2135
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Hello world come on in

2136
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
It's like saying it doesn't matter

2137
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
It's okay

2138
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Oh I don't understand how she could do this

2139
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Let me fast forward a little bit

2140
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Because I want to see if there's

2141
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
More breakdown

2142
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
I love him

2143
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
I love him I'm so sorry okay

2144
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
If you loved him that much

2145
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
You wouldn't have done it

2146
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
If you cared about him that much you wouldn't have done it

2147
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
And if you wanted people to back off

2148
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
And not be involved then you wouldn't have posted

2149
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
That statement but

2150
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
You see the thing is you were stupid enough

2151
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
To get photographed doing it okay

2152
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Don't be so stupid

2153
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I can't help it

2154
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
But that accent's awesome

2155
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
There's like a level of sophistication

2156
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
I was going in between

2157
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Going that's a pretty cool accent

2158
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
And then going but she's so

2159
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Stupid I want to point this out

2160
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
She's very much

2161
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
A fan of this person so I mean

2162
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
But her accent is awesome

2163
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
This is when fandom goes sour

2164
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
This is 2.5 million

2165
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Views on YouTube

2166
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
And you just added to it Rob what the hell

2167
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
And by the way bless you tiger

2168
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
For finding this for us

2169
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
I can always count on you 2.5 million

2170
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Views on YouTube

2171
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Do you know how many people listen to this show

2172
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Far less

2173
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
But my favorite is

2174
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
My favorite is the related

2175
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Videos on the side such as

2176
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Tom Cruise liked my nail polish

2177
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Oh it's her too

2178
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
She's been to McDonald's for breakfast

2179
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
There's a stage at the top and there's going to be a band playing

2180
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
But we don't know who

2181
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
I want to get to Tom Cruise

2182
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Where is it

2183
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Library day

2184
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Ok Breaking Dawn Part 2 trailer

2185
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Reaction I've seen this before it's so

2186
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Amazing this video is like

2187
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Where she's crying

2188
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Through the whole thing

2189
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
I don't think we know the truth

2190
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Maybe we can convince the Volturi to listen

2191
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
My family is in danger

2192
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Oh my god

2193
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Oh my god

2194
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Oh my god

2195
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
That was me watching the trailer for Mr. Pandaria

2196
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Actually

2197
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
It can still be

2198
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Anyone watching the trailer for Breaking Dawn

2199
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Because it is that bad

2200
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
We need to do one of those for showgirls

2201
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
And send it to Peaches

2202
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Oh actually

2203
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
The trailer just came out for the

2204
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Mass Effect 3 Leviathan DLC

2205
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
And we actually have

2206
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Shane's reaction here on video

2207
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Volturi

2208
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
They're coming for us

2209
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
We love you Shane

2210
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
He's not in chat

2211
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
I don't see him

2212
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Is Shane there?

2213
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
He went on a work trip so he's in another

2214
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
City right now and he's probably asleep

2215
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Because he was up for like 27 hours straight

2216
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
He said he was gonna try and listen on his phone

2217
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Tonight but he's gotta be asleep

2218
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Which is great because I've talked shit

2219
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
About him like 3 times so far

2220
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
In tonight's episode

2221
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Well maybe we'll find out in about an hour

2222
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
No I would've got a text message

2223
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
By now

2224
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
I'm not that bad

2225
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Just say jerk

2226
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Alright

2227
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Oh Shane

2228
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Let's travel around the world and look at some

2229
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000

01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000

2231
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Can I do reactions?

2232
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Yes

2233
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
DarkSakra and Rob do reactions to the US release dates

2234
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Here we go

2235
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Coming out of Nintendo Wii the last story

01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
I've been waiting for this game

2238
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000

2242
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
We did it

2243
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
We did it

2244
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
We did it

2245
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
We did it

2246
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
It's finally coming out

2247
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Everybody else

2248
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Doesn't like the Wii anymore

2249
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
But I

2250
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
I love the Wii

2251
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000

Rob there there there there

2255
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
You can love your Wii

2256
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Alright

2257
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
I was out there getting signatures

2258
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Outside of Gamestop for Hyper Ace

2259
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000

01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Check out the Japanese release dates

2281
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Maybe we'll get some reactions from Loki

2282
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
If I can actually get the Japanese

2283
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
I'm just building up the moment in anticipation here

2284
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
If I can actually get the Japanese

2285
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
I was just so excited about it

2286
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
I have to tell you about my fun Japanese moment

2287
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Alright great

2288
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
There was an exchange student in line behind me at Target

2289
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Nevermind

2290
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Actually this did happen the other day

2291
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
That was the worst story ever

2292
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Congratulations

2293
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Actually this did happen is that I helped her pick out a flavor of breath mints

2294
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
True story

2295
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Cool story bro

2296
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
And Rob

2297
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000

Airport Hero 3D Honolulu

I don't know if that's kind of like the flight game

2309
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Alien Dildos

2310
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
No I don't think it's Alien Dildos actually

2311
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
And lastly taking a look at the Vita real quick

2312

Comes out this week

2316
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Kind of a slower week in Japan

2317
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Sorry to say

2318
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
But a game to get really excited about

2319
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
I know this is a game many of you at home

2320
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Would be losing your shit over like the Twilight Girl

2321
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Hatsune Miku Project

2322
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Sadly she wasn't joking

2323
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
That from Sega coming out on August 30th

2324
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
What?

2325
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Alright

2326
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
That's it for Japanese release dates

2327
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Let's go to UK release dates

2328
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
On the 13th of August we have Iron Brigade on the PC

2329
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
I was just trying to make it sound more authentic

2330
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
15th of August

2331
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
We have Dust

An Elysian Tall

2333
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Is what it says

2334
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
An Elysian Tall

2335
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
God do you know what it says Tall?

2336
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I'm like what the crap

2337
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
They need to fix their typefaces

2338
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
And on the 17th of August we have

2339
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
New Super Mario Brothers 2

2340
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
On the 3DS

2341
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Now available at the retail in the U

2342
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
And that's it for the UK release dates?

2343
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Yeah

2344
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Alright let's do a couple more news stories

2345
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
And then the classic game of the week

2346
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Cause we need something this week to keep the show classy

2347
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Loki

2348
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Alright so Valve discovered that one of the

2349
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Custom made weapons

2350
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
For

2351
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Dota 2 which surprised me

2352
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Cause I didn't realize Dota 2 was out already

2353
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
But apparently it is

2354
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
And apparently someone copied

2355
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
A mace that's from

2356
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
The MMO Aeon

2357
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
And

2358
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Just so you know I don't think Dota 2 is officially out

2359
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
I mean Chatroom correct me if I'm wrong

2360
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
I think it's just one of those betas like everybody's in

2361
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Oh

2362
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
I think that's gonna work out

2363
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Anyways so

2364
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Apparently they discovered this

2365
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
You know this

2366
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Weapon in there and of course they removed

2367
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
The item and issued a warning

2368
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
To the players that

2369
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
You know this kind of crap is not gonna be tolerated

2370
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Not only did they do that they also

2371
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Removed the maces from everybody's inventory

2372
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
They replaced it with a new item

2373
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
And they also banned

2374
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
The um

2375
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
You know banned the person that made

2376
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
The actual weapon

2377
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
And stripped his account

2378
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
From all the proceeds

2379
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
From the sale so apparently there's real

2380
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
There's real money transactions going along

2381
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
With these weapons I think it's kind of like the hats

2382
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
And Team Fortress and all that stuff yeah

2383
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
And of course

2384
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Reminding everybody that you know you must respect

2385
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
IP of other companies and

2386
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Encouraging their community to report

2387
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Infringement this is how the fucking shit should

2388
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Go down for anything on Apple's

2389
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Marketplace when they discover hey

2390
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
This is ripping off some shit they should well of course

2391
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
I think that's the whole problem is they don't know

2392
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Burn it in ten thousand fires

2393
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Basically you know they they don't have enough

2394
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
People saying you know there's

2395
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
I guess not enough people looking at stuff

2396
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
That's on their marketplace maybe that's the problem

2397
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Because they do I know ban people when stuff's

2398
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Discovered but

2399
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
And thank you chatters GameGuru confirming

2400
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
It's not out it's still in beta and

2401
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Photoshop says it's been a beta for ages now

2402
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
So basically it's like Gmail

2403
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Like Gmail was in beta for what five years?

2404
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Alright

2405
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Okay

2406
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Alright it's just a new layer of beta

2407
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Something else has been

2408
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Sitting dormant for years and years

2409
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
This is crazy oops

2410
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
I didn't mean to like have that autoplay but there you go

2411
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
The sounds you hear in the

2412
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Background the sounds of the NBA

2413
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Jam triple X

2414
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Prototype is what they're calling it around the internet

2415
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
That doesn't mean NGA

2416
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
NGA

2417
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
NBA Jam

2418
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Acronym fail with boobies okay

2419
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
That's not what they mean by triple X here but it's actually

2420
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
The original cartridge got shipped

2421
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
To this website NintendoPlayer.com

2422
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Where they like to discover these prototypes

2423
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
And whatever and this particular

2424
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
You know

2425
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Board got sent to them that was an

2426
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
NBA Jam work in progress

2427
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
And it has Jam written over one little

2428
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Chip there and then XXX over

2429
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
The other chips so I don't think

2430
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
It was like meant to like have that name triple

2431
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
X but it's kind of funny that it does because

2432
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Basically all it is it's the

2433
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Same NBA Jam that was on the Super

2434
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Nintendo but it has

2435
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Some R rated outtakes

2436
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
That are inserted in the game instead

2437
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Here's an example this little YouTube

2438
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
I'm going to play right here

2439
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
He's cooking up

2440
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Yes he just said he's

2441
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Fucking up

2442
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Get that shit out of here

2443
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
No fucking way

2444
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
He's on fucking fire

2445
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
So lol the F word is all over

2446
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
The game basically right

2447
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Well some folks obviously are questioning

2448
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Its authenticity including the guy

2449
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Who did the original voice overs himself

2450
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Who basically said oh wow

2451
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
That's pretty crazy

2452
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Somebody sounds just like me out there

2453
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Doing these acts on the internet

2454
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
But it appears this website

2455
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Actually released they say

2456
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Download right here you can actually download the ROM

2457
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
And try it for yourself so I don't think

2458
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
It's just the YouTube you can actually check this out

2459
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
So they did dump the ROM and you can check this out

2460
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
And I don't know if you would just be able to

2461
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Insert in your own clips or whatever

2462
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
I think you could ROM hack that

2463
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
And then you can burn the ROM chips

2464
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Onto the cartridge

2465
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Yeah but I think it's also plausible you know

2466
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
When you're in the sound booth doing recording

2467
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
And this was even said on some website somewhere

2468
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Some forum post I got linked

2469
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
And I apologize I don't have it in front of me

2470
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
But it totally made sense

2471
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
If you're doing voice overs for hours and hours

2472
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Of these lines you're gonna do some funny ones

2473
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
You're gonna have some zany outtakes

2474
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
You're gonna have some moments of stress relief

2475
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Where you just go how many times do you need me to say this

2476
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
He's on fucking fire you know

2477
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
And then so yeah there's probably a programmer

2478
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
That thought it would be funny

2479
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
That thought it would be funny to put those in the game

2480
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
But put it under lock and key so that nobody ever would get it

2481
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Hot coffee

2482
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Have you

2483
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Lock and key but still in the game

2484
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
I remember a video that I saw

2485
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
I don't know quite a couple years ago about

2486
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Basically outtakes of Casey Kasem's top 50

2487
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Or top 100 whatever he used to do

2488
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
That he would be recording bombs for radio stations

2489
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
It's like the home of the best

2490
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Radio in Illinois

2491
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
And that's the cut of the take and then

2492
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
How do I fucking know they're the best

2493
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
And similar similar similar situations

2494
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Like that I mean

2495
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
I was able to for somebody to

2496
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Have a similar voice plus effects sound the same

2497
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Back to the future release

2498
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
In the last two years

2499
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Well there's also the outtake of

2500
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Oh god I can't remember his name who was Elmer Fudd

2501
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Or Porky Pig sorry

2502
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
It said

2503
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Son of a gun you thought I was gonna say son of a bitch didn't you

2504
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
And I'm really sure it's Christopher Walken

2505
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Doing all those playthroughs of different games

2506
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
I'm really sure it's him you know

2507
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Watching the playthroughs for that

2508
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Or reading you know

2509
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
What things are and all that stuff

2510
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Bless you internet

2511
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:29,000
We're up to our long distance dedication

2512
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:33,000
But he was most certainly a part of let's go start again

2513
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
From coming out of the record

2514
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Play the record okay

2515
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Please

2516
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:45,000
See when you come out of those up tempo god damn numbers man

2517
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
It's impossible to make those transitions

2518
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
And then you gotta go into somebody dying

2519
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
You know they do this to me all the time

2520
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
I don't know what the hell they do it for

2521
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
But god damn it if we can't come out of a slow record

2522
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
I don't understand it

2523
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Okay I want a god damn concerted effort to come out of a record

2524
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
That isn't a fucking up tempo record

2525
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Every time I do a god damn deaf dedication

2526
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Now make it and I also want to know what happened to the pictures I was supposed to see this week

2527
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
We'll do it live

2528
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Essentially so

2529
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Those things can happen y'all

2530
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:23,000
No I'm not saying this announcer guy lost it on Casey Kasem or Bill O'Reilly levels

2531
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
But you know

2532
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:29,000
His show would be even better if he did it that way

2533
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Transformers

2534
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
He was the voice of several transformers

2535
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:37,000
You're in a confined booth for god knows how many hours

2536
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
You don't think moods start to change

2537
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Go a little off script

2538
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Anyhow I don't know I mean the fact that there actually is a ROM of it out there

2539
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Makes it a lot more believable than just the video

2540
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Granted a lot of work but why would somebody do that much work?

2541
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Just to put the F word

2542
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Especially in a website that's dedicated to this kind of crap anyways

2543
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
I don't think they'd go make something up

2544
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Maybe if it was April 1st or something like that

2545
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:17,000
It's like stock photo sites and how they're stock photo of the most absurd imaginable situations

2546
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
What was the meme?

2547
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Naked in front of a refrigerator getting a salad or something completely ridiculous like that

2548
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
What?

2549
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:32,000
You basically go for absurd stock photo pictures

2550
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:38,000
And the people that have to take these pictures come up with the most ridiculous scenes ever

2551
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,000
And so there is a whole series of censored naked people eating a salad

2552
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Are you tossing the salad?

2553
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,000
No that's another site Rob

2554
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Kotaku will run a...

2555
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Kotaku will run anything

2556
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I understand this but I'm just saying they run a feature every week

2557
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,000
It's about stock footage of people playing games

2558
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
And it's just like weird shit

2559
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:07,000
There is the one where this emo chick is playing this game

2560
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Laying off of a couch somehow

2561
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
And her friend has a hookah next to her

2562
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,000
And it's just like a non-lit hookah smoking it

2563
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:21,000
It's like why would you need stock footage for that?

2564
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Hipster gaming

2565
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
You want to get high and play some sound shapes

2566
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:31,000
More like whatever sinks your battleship

2567
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Let's go back to a time when games were so much simpler and pure

2568
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Artist!

2569
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
10 years ago right Rob?

2570
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Going back to the classic game of the week

2571
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:47,000
A nice G-rated experience for everybody right DarkSakura?

2572
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Who's going to dip into the vault right now and find a game that she thinks

2573
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Hey you little shit I mean sucker

2574
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
You should play this video game right now

2575
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:01,000
If you're into shirtless bestiality you want this game

2576
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:04,000
And what game could you ever be talking about DarkSakura?

2577
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Altered Beast

2578
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Which I really don't think I've ever done

2579
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Rise from your grave

2580
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
There we go we got to have it

2581
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
In Japan it was called Juloki

2582
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Which is Beast King's Chronicle

2583
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Came out in 1988 by Sega

2584
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,000
And it's a go around beat shit up game

2585
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
It's set in ancient Greece

2586
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
And it's a centurion who is resurrected by Zeus

2587
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
To rescue Athena

2588
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Like Zeus ever cared about his kids

2589
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,000
And so he is able to turn into different beasts

2590
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
When you get this little power up sphere thing

2591
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:46,000
He just turns into big dude and then turns into animal man

2592
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:51,000
It came out on several video game consoles and computers at home

2593
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:54,000
It was a pack-in game for the Mega Drive

2594
01:32:54,000 --> 01:33:00,000
And one of the designers for this was Makoto Uchida

2595
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Who was the creator of Golden Axe

2596
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:08,000
So stylistically you can see things in between the two games

2597
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
So anyway the centurion is dead

2598
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
So basically you're playing a zombie

2599
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:17,000
And you have to beat some dude named Nef

2600
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Well a demon god named Nef

2601
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:24,000
And so you can become different types of aminals

2602
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:29,000
When you get to hell or Disks I should say

2603
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:33,000
You face Nef who becomes a huge rhinoceros guy

2604
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,000
And then a blue bird comes out of the ground and turns into Athena

2605
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
So it's very acid trippy too

2606
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:43,000
It is side scrolling and it has been on damn near everything

2607
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,000
So the orbs that you get through the game

2608
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Will make you bigger and bad-asser with huge muscular thighs and abs

2609
01:33:51,000 --> 01:34:00,000
And you turn into a werewolf, a weredragon, a werebear, a weretiger, or the golden werewolf

2610
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:06,000
There's other different beasts in the Famicom version and in the Gameboy Advance version

2611
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,000
And sometimes you get lightning power

2612
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:21,000
At any rate you also have some very weird unicorn creatures in one of the levels

2613
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,000
That just sort of tries to headbutt you to death

2614
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,000
The dry queen unicorns, they were my favorite

2615
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
The dry queen unicorns

2616
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:32,000
It's like I would always laugh my ass off seeing them

2617
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
So what it came out on is

2618
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
I hear giggles

2619
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,000
It's just the chat room acting up

2620
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Let's kneel

2621
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Travis I'm gonna bench you over my knee and spank ya

2622
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,000
And not in the good way for the 69th episode

2623
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
The fuck he said

2624
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Nah it's not that, don't worry

2625
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Get back to the classic game

2626
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Alright

2627
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:59,000
So it came out for the Sega Master System, the PC Engine, PC Engine CD, Famicom, Atari STX

2628
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Spectrum, Commodore 64, R.O.B.

2629
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:05,000
The Armstrad CPC, Commodore Amiga, and DOS

2630
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:14,000
The Mega Drive slash Genesis version is important because it was a pack-in game for North America, Europe, and Brazil

2631
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
And then it was replaced by Sonic the Hedgehog

2632
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,000
There is a handheld version of the game done by Tiger Electronics

2633
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
God what is funny?

2634
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,000
I'm not allowed to smile

2635
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
But you're doing the nose laugh

2636
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:32,000
I'm laughing because Travis spoke up in chat and said, yeah baby

2637
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,000
And I tried to spank him so I'm laughing

2638
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Remember, it's only porn if you tape it

2639
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,000
So

2640
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Yeah baby

2641
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:45,000
The Mega Drive version is on several compilations

2642
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Including the Sega Smash Pack, Sega Genesis Collection, and Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection

2643
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
And on the latter two they are unlockable

2644
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,000
You can get it on the Virtual Console for Wii

2645
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:00,000
It is on Xbox 360, on Xbox Live Arcade

2646
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,000
And on the Playstation Network as the arcade version with HD support

2647
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
And has online

2648
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
What?

2649
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Sorry

2650
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Online leaderboards and network play

2651
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,000
There is an iOS version of the Mega Drive version

2652
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,000
That came out in 2010 for the iPhone and iPad

2653
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Because all the good stuff comes out on iOS and not Android

2654
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:30,000
There are a lot of the lower versions

2655
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,000
That only had single player and four levels

2656
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:38,000
And had different beasts like a human shark in the NES version

2657
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
It was very weird

2658
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,000
But yeah, now there is this thing called Project Altered Beast

2659
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:48,000
And this was a Playstation 2 title that came out

2660
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Excuse me

2661
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:54,000
In 2005 in Japan it was called Jewel Key Project Altered Beast

2662
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,000
And Altered Beast in Europe

2663
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,000
And it did not come out in North America

2664
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000
It was 18 plus rated in Japan for being intensity

2665
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,000
But in Europe it was rated 12 plus

2666
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,000
But it had like tons and tons of gore in it

2667
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:14,000
And it basically was kind of unrelated to the original game

2668
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
You played as a dude called Luke Custer

2669
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Who was a genome cyborg

2670
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,000
And his DNA and genetic makeup was screwed

2671
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:26,000
So that he could turn into a werewolf, a merman, a garuda

2672
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Which basically is like an eagle

2673
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,000
A wendigo, a minotaur and a dragon

2674
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:34,000
And then you could also be like a weretiger and a grizzly bear

2675
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
So bears in video games huh

2676
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,000
And then there was Altered Beast Guardian of the Realms

2677
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Which was developed by 3D6 Games and published by THQ

2678
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,000
That was a sequel for the GBA version

2679
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:51,000
And you could turn into a werewolf, a snake man

2680
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:54,000
A dragon, a tiger man, a spiked turtle

2681
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
A shark man, a rhinoceros man

2682
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
An eagle man

2683
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,000
A scorpion or a chimera

2684
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Or

2685
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Yeah

2686
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
So that's it

2687
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Alright there it is, your classic game of the week

2688
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
One last thing

2689
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Altered Beast

2690
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Neth, the bad guy

2691
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Will be in rhinoceros form in Wreck it Ralph

2692
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Oh okay

2693
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
In the bad guy's anonymous scene

2694
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Nice

2695
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Alright Altered Beast, your classic game of the week

2696
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Now some folks in chat are thinking

2697
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Wasn't this a classic game of the week before?

2698
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Actually it wasn't

2699
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Here's where it came up on the show before

2700
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Not that long ago the Genesis collection or whatever

2701
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:37,000
The reimaginings that were on the Playstation Network and Xbox Live Arcade

2702
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,000
They went free for Playstation Plus subscribers

2703
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,000
That same week I signed up for Playstation Plus

2704
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
So I went back and played through this entire game

2705
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,000
And I think I did this whole rant on those unicorns

2706
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
So I have talked about this game on the show previously

2707
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
But it wasn't technically a classic game of the week

2708
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
That was a little while ago at this point

2709
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:58,000
So just to clear up any confusion

2710
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
But I do remember when I played through it

2711
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Can I check the list?

2712
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
It's pretty terrible

2713
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Now keep in mind I had to play the Genesis version

2714
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Not the arcade version

2715
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
We actually just I think played through the Genesis version

2716
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Not long ago

2717
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
We had

2718
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Pretty bad

2719
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
No I take that back, Sega Ages

2720
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
We played through

2721
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Alright

2722
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Alright so there it is your classic game of the week

2723
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Altered Beast

2724
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Let's take a break

2725
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Obviously it's been a lullsy show so far

2726
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
But the best is yet to come

2727
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Nah I don't know I'm just saying that

2728
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
But you don't know what's gonna happen on part B

2729
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Of Orange Lounge Radio

2730
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
We're gonna get to the emails

2731
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
FUs of the week and phone calls

2732
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Oh anything can happen during phone calls

2733
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
All when we come back with more

2734
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Of Orange Lounge Radio

2735
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

2736
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Episode number 469

2737
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Already in progress

2738
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,000
We've had quite the night so far

2739
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Okay

2740
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
I have coffee

2741
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
I was talking to Alan in the other room during the break

2742
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:04,000
And he's actually listening to the show while he plays Mass Effect 3 multiplayer

2743
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Which by the way

2744
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,000
He has a disgusting collection of Mass Effect 3 multiplayer

2745
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
I saw the guns

2746
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Pretty outstanding huh

2747
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
He said he was about ready to come out here and tell us

2748
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
No stop it stop it

2749
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
During the uh

2750
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
During the release date segment

2751
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
But anyway we'll see what happens

2752
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
In this part B of our program

2753
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
The song was not about alien dildos

2754
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Pork chop

2755
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Now the podcasters will have no idea what you're talking about

2756
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,000
But during the break we played a song for Mass Effect

2757
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
The long song that's the credits during the first game

2758
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Unless you have DLC and then the song was seriously stopped

2759
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,000
And you still have credits

2760
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Right

2761
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Actually that was me in Mass Effect 2

2762
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,000
I had like another

2763
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Same length of the song plus some

2764
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Of no music

2765
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
What?

2766
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
For Mass Effect 2 I had so much DLC

2767
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Oh

2768
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Because I bought the collector's edition

2769
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Because it was 11 bucks and came with the first Mass Effect

2770
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Which I already bought

2771
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Right

2772
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:05,000
That I seriously had the length of the song

2773
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Plus some of nothing

2774
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
So I just went to the bathroom

2775
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Cool story

2776
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Alright

2777
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Let's get into some rapid fire news

2778
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:18,000
And some quick stories about some things going on in the gaming world this week

2779
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Logie

2780
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Alright so Minecraft Pocket Edition has gotten an update

2781
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Where they've added a few things that you can find in the full fledged version

2782
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
On PC and Xbox 360

2783
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Well 360 not being entirely full fledged

2784
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
But you get the point

2785
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Anyways

2786
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,000
They've added skeletons and spiders

2787
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,000
As well as bows

2788
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
So now you can fire bows and arrows

2789
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Or fire arrows at a

2790
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Spiders and skeletons and bows oh my

2791
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,000
I'm surprised I thought they already had skeletons in the game

2792
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
But maybe I'm just mistaken

2793
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Maybe there's always zombies

2794
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,000
I haven't played much of the Pocket Edition

2795
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
But I do play it sometimes

2796
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,000
When I'm stuck somewhere and I'll have my phone

2797
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Skyrim is getting the 1.7 update on consoles

2798
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Becoming out and of course it includes a number of bug fixes

2799
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:12,000
And optimizations and stuff like that

2800
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
And they'll be coming out on Xbox

2801
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,000
And also PC at some point

2802
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Or PS3 at some point

2803
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
And still no word on Dawnguard

2804
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
For PS3

2805
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
You don't get it yet

2806
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Because they're just not satisfied with

2807
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,000
When it's ready

2808
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Exactly

2809
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Well we're satisfied

2810
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,000
And then last but not least

2811
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Cabela's

2812
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:39,000
You know they're really trying hard to figure out a way to make Cabela's interesting

2813
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
And so now the latest thing that they have

2814
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Is they kind of modified their top shot gun

2815
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Because they actually for the last few games

2816
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,000
They've had this gun peripheral

2817
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
It's a wireless gun that goes along with

2818
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,000
The Xbox 360 and PS3 versions

2819
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:58,000
But now they've retitled the gun the Fear Master

2820
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:01,000
And what makes it unique is that it has

2821
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:05,000
A sensor built into the actual handle of the gun

2822
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:08,000
That senses your heart rate

2823
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:13,000
And I guess based on that it will affect the game

2824
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,000
So is that like the Wii Vitality sensor?

2825
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Sort of

2826
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Okay

2827
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,000
But you know had they pitched it instead of saying

2828
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
It'll make you healthy and blah blah blah

2829
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
They could have made it you know

2830
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,000
The Wii Vitality sensor

2831
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
We're gonna throw dangerous animals at you

2832
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
I mean that might have been a little bit more interesting

2833
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Like the Wii Vitality sensor had been for like Tokyo Jungle

2834
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Which is a PlayStation game so I know that makes no sense

2835
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
But you know

2836
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Work with me here for a minute

2837
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Yes

2838
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Something like that

2839
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
But that's coming out on the 23rd

2840
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
That's Dangerous Hunts 2013

2841
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Cause they have two

2842
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Two Cabela's games that come out each year

2843
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Actually last year they had three on the same day

2844
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Why?

2845
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Oh that also happened to be the week before

2846
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 came out

2847
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
So no one gave a shit

2848
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Can I interject a little story about something like this?

2849
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Of course

2850
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,000
I actually hadn't heard of this before

2851
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,000
And something kind of interesting that

2852
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Not a lot of people know

2853
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
May know as a result of the situation

2854
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Fatal Frame 1 through 3 were all PlayStation 2 games

2855
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
And then Fatal Frame 4 came out on the Wii

2856
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
And actually incorporated motion controls

2857
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Etcetera, etcetera

2858
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:24,000
In Japan and Europe they re-released Fatal Frame 2

2859
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Under the Fatal Frame 4 controls

2860
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,000
And it's amazing

2861
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Like I wasn't a big fan of 4

2862
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,000
First three games

2863
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Absolutely love them

2864
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:35,000
The relevance here is that Fatal Frame 2's re-release

2865
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Has mini games

2866
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:40,000
And they actually implemented something like this

2867
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,000
They attempted to

2868
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Where you basically walk through a haunted house

2869
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
In a Fatal Frame 2 scene

2870
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:48,000
And they basically measure fear

2871
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:52,000
As a result of movement in the nunchuck and the Wiimote

2872
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Obviously they're not going to be picking up your heart rate

2873
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Or anything like that

2874
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Which would have been a better indicator

2875
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:00,000
But they'll throw sounds and ghosts and spirits

2876
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,000
And you know the Fatal Frame kind of situations at you

2877
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:06,000
And the goal is to keep the Wiimote and the nunchuck

2878
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,000
As steady as possible

2879
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Now that would have been a pretty good use of the Wiimote

2880
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Yeah, it's a nice little implementation

2881
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:17,000
The re-release happened mid, late last year, earlier this year

2882
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
I don't think it's going to come out in America

2883
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:22,000
But the situation, the fact that they actually took something like that

2884
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,000
And went forward through it

2885
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
It's kind of a cool application

2886
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Because the Wiimote's going to know when you throw your hands up

2887
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,000
And freak out

2888
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
As, well, a little kid would anyways

2889
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,000
I haven't, I swear

2890
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Ry, would you care to comment on that?

2891
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Actually, he's pretty calm when playing those games

2892
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
It's very fun to watch Jason play those

2893
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Does Jason ever lose his shit over any video games?

2894
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
That's a good question

2895
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,000
That is a really good question

2896
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
I don't think I've really seen him lose his shit

2897
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
I've seen him where he'll pause it

2898
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,000
And kind of look away and that kind of thing

2899
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
But nothing like getting up and screaming

2900
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Or jumping from something that's bad

2901
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Not like the boys at Four Player Podcast

2902
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Yeah, not like one of our other friends

2903
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
He's very, very scared of him

2904
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,000
You can tell

2905
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Has he played much of, was it

2906
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Amnesia? Maybe that's the game we need to be adjacent to

2907
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
No, well there's Amnesia and then there's also

2908
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:17,000
What is it, not the

2909
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Yeah, Ender

2910
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Amnesia's on my list

2911
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
I do have it in Steam and it's on my list eventually

2912
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Even when I played Silent Hill 3

2913
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Slender, I'm sorry, not Ender

2914
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
I've been confusing Minecraft again

2915
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Well, it's Slender

2916
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
It's based on the Slender Man stuff

2917
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
But they have Slender

2918
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,000
People get fucking freaked out by that game

2919
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,000
What is this on?

2920
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
It's on PC

2921
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
One of my coworkers was talking about it

2922
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
And it's one of those things that I forgot the name of it

2923
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,000
So I couldn't come home and say

2924
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Hey Jason, you need to play this

2925
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
So Slender and Amnesia, huh?

2926
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Slender is all about walking through the forest

2927
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
And you get to find notes

2928
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,000
But the Slender Man, you see, he stalks you

2929
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,000
And occasionally you'll walk into

2930
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
And it's all at night with a flashlight

2931
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
And if you look at him

2932
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
You know, the longer you look at him

2933
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
The more damage you take

2934
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:11,000
And you're not supposed to look at the Slender Man

2935
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
I'm intrigued

2936
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
I will say that

2937
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Just before Silent Hill HD Collections came out

2938
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
I actually went there and replayed

2939
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Went to go play through all of Silent Hill 1-4

2940
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
The ambiance of 4 and especially the ending

2941
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
It terrified me

2942
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:30,000
I could not get more than 15-20 minutes into Silent Hill 4

2943
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:33,000
The quietness, the...

2944
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
You didn't even start Silent Hill 4

2945
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
It was the opening video

2946
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
I took steps through the room

2947
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
I got to the point where the room started to transition

2948
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Which was, okay, maybe it wasn't 20 minutes

2949
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Maybe I'm giving myself a little bit too much credit there

2950
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
I started the game

2951
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,000
I looked outside

2952
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
I saw the other apartment complex

2953
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
And the couple of people you could see moving

2954
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,000
But as soon as the wall started changing

2955
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Plus the intro video

2956
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Can you imagine?

2957
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
I can't wait for in the future

2958
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
When we have these reaction videos

2959
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
But instead of the reaction videos

2960
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
People watching the screen

2961
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
It's like a VR heads up display

2962
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Or something like that

2963
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Where you're just completely immersed

2964
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,000
And you turn around

2965
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,000
HOLY SHIT!

2966
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Immersion is going to be the best thing

2967
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
And the worst thing for me

2968
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:20,000
For the record, you know the only thing that creeps me out in Silent Hill?

2969
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,000
The rabbit

2970
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
We need to get the video capture

2971
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
For me it's that hospital room

2972
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Where you go in the room and then all of a sudden it's the giant head

2973
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
And it's like

2974
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
I can tell how scared you are right now

2975
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Well I really think what we should do

2976
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,000
We need to make it a priority to get the video capture set up in this place

2977
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
So that for Halloween

2978
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Or somewhere around there we can do a

2979
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Scary game marathon

2980
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
And make me play these scary games

2981
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
And I will cry

2982
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
I will throw things

2983
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Nothing will match that experience

2984
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Where I was playing Silent Hill Homecoming

2985
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
And the ceiling falls down

2986
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
In this one random part

2987
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
And I was playing in the middle of a rainstorm

2988
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
And our front door blew open

2989
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
And I swear to god

2990
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
I jumped in my bed and went under the covers and started crying

2991
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
I couldn't handle it

2992
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
It was too much

2993
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
And Homecoming wasn't even that great

2994
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
All things considered

2995
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
It was alright

2996
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Anyhow

2997
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
I have some news for you guys as well

2998
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Unfortunately some sad news

2999
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
I have to start off with some sad news here

3000
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
During my part of rapid fire news

3001
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Paul Steed

3002
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
He worked on bringing Wing Commander to 3D

3003
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
He also was part of the original Xbox launch

3004
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Unfortunately he passed away

3005
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
We don't have a cause of death or what have you

3006
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
But he was a very important part of 90s gaming

3007
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
He worked on some big big PC titles in the 90s

3008
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Wing Commander

3009
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Wings of Glory

3010
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Bioforge

3011
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
Quake at ID Software

3012
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
And he also made the crack horror player model

3013
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Yes that was a thing

3014
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
So unfortunately he did pass away this week

3015
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
According to the Jace Hall show

3016
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Which there is a YouTube clip of him there

3017
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
He leaves behind a wife and child

3018
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Sorry to hear that

3019
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Moving on

3020
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
To news about the Wii U

3021
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Wii games apparently going to be playable

3022
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
On the Wii U gamepad

3023
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
That's very interesting

3024
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
We kind of expect that Nintendo platforms at this point

3025
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Are going to be backwards compatible

3026
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
With the prior platform

3027
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
It's been a very common thing in the handheld part

3028
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
And then of course we've seen

3029
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
You know how the Wii will play GameCube games

3030
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Well the Wii U will play the Wii games as well

3031
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
And what's interesting is that you can actually play them

3032
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
On the little gamepad

3033
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Because those gamepads have the little sensor bar

3034
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
In them

3035
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
So yep you can point with the touch screen and so forth

3036
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Using a Wii remote

3037
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
However I want to point out

3038
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
This is still apparently a rumor

3039
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
That it's a Spanish brand manager

3040
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
And not an official Nintendo source

3041
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
It kind of makes sense though

3042
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
It would be a great reason to sell a mini-mote

3043
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
A mini-mote

3044
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
A little keychain mote

3045
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
How big is this screen?

3046
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Not even 4 inches or so?

3047
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Well it's not the size, Jason

3048
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
It's how you use it

3049
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
4-16

3050
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
I can't imagine playing a game

3051
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
With that small of a pointing radius

3052
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
No I understand

3053
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Because even when they were showing

3054
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
The Wii U

3055
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
The Wii Fit U stuff

3056
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
It was just like

3057
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Ok that's fucking ridiculous

3058
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
You're going to have this little thing set up

3059
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
While your wife's watching TV

3060
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
And you're going to be exercising to this tiny little screen

3061
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
Come on, I mean that's a little

3062
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Little dumb

3063
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
But there's other Wii games that would work

3064
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Like Mario Galaxy

3065
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
New Super Mario

3066
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Virtual Console games

3067
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
New Super Mario Brothers

3068
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
I was actually just thinking about that

3069
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
That's kind of worse for one reason

3070
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
Certain power-ups

3071
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
You're holding this

3072
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
What I'm expecting to be rather

3073
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Hefty tablet

3074
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Less because it's not the whole guts

3075
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
But you're holding this tablet in your hands

3076
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Oh I need to throw a fireball

3077
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Let me shake this ridiculously oversized

3078
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Controller tablet

3079
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
In order to spin jump

3080
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Propeller

3081
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
That thing had a built in projector

3082
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
That little tablet thing had a built in projector

3083
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
That would be fucking cool

3084
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Wasn't that the early rumors about the revolution

3085
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Was that it's going to project

3086
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
3D out its anus

3087
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Onto your wall

3088
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Remember that shit?

3089
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
No remember that was the console was the

3090
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
VR headset

3091
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
That's what the thing was

3092
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
I remember the whole

3093
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
The Wii is like fucking holograms and shit

3094
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
I remember those were early

3095
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
When it was the revolution and they said

3096
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Oh it's the Wii

3097
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
And you're like nope that's not going to be revolutionary at all

3098
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Anyhow

3099
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
We took this really kick ass name

3100
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
And we cut its balls off

3101
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Speaking of Nintendo news

3102
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
There are some more details for Animal Crossing

3103
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
3DS

3104
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
I don't know how I feel

3105
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Total KK Total KK Total KK Total KK

3106
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Animal Crossing was awesome the first time

3107
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
It was one of the best games ever on the GameCube

3108
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Back when it had the NES games unlocked

3109
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
But now I don't know

3110
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
I'm getting a little bit

3111
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
I'm feeling a little burned out on this series

3112
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
But I'll give it one more go with the 3DS version

3113
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
It was educational for me

3114
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Oh with the whole, you're talking about the

3115
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Animal Forest with the Japanese letters

3116
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Yeah because I was using it to practice reading

3117
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Anyhow

3118
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Here are some things to look forward to in the brand new

3119
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Animal Crossing Jump Out

3120
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Which by the way is the title

3121
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Oh my god

3122
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Well because it's 3D so the pictures they just

3123
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Go out

3124
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Yeah

3125
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Loki these are the things you have to look forward to

3126
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Because I know you're a big fan of Animal Crossing

3127
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Oh I can't wait to pick it up for my 3

3128
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Oh wait no I can't

3129
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
An all new gardening store where you can purchase

3130
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Plants

3131
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Fantastic you know instead of having them at Nook's

3132
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Where they've always been let's separate it into

3133
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Yet another fucking store I gotta hike to

3134
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
That has different hours in Nook

3135
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Raccoon housing which will be run by Tom Nook

3136
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
A wider variety

3137
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Of fish and fossils which you can

3138
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Donate to your museum

3139
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
An exhibition room

3140
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
And shop in the museum which will be open

3141
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
24 hours

3142
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
I don't know of any museums that are open 24 hours

3143
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Actually a lot of like

3144
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
National parks and stuff like I'm thinking like

3145
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Washington DC a lot of people don't know this but like the

3146
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument they're all 24 hours

3147
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Those are all outdoors I mean

3148
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
A museum that you, ok sorry

3149
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Rapid fire

3150
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
When it's run by an owl

3151
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
He can stay open all night

3152
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
He's a night owl

3153
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Touche

3154
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
A miscellaneous goods store

3155
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
That's what it's called

3156
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
The Able Sisters Clothes Shop

3157
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Oh wow that's a new feature

3158
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Roofs, doors

3159
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Posts and fences can be

3160
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Customized

3161
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
So I'm gonna have a pink

3162
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Fence I can't wait till I have a lesbian

3163
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Again I can't wait either

3164
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Brand new furniture

3165
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Including mermaid

3166
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Items

3167
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Under the sea

3168
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
We need that little singing crab

3169
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
A player will be the

3170
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Mayor of his or her town

3171
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
So now you're in control

3172
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Oh but I like the mayor

3173
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
He died

3174
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Well he was pretty fucking old

3175
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Can you evict citizens as the mayor

3176
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
That would be awesome

3177
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
I would have an all lesbian

3178
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Community

3179
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
A thrift shop

3180
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Will be available

3181
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
It makes sense Goodwills are popping up

3182
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
On every corner in this day and age

3183
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
So it's basically

3184
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
As opposed to like the recycle bin that you

3185
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Free shit out of now you're gonna go buy it

3186
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Alright a shopping mall

3187
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Will be available

3188
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
And lastly

3189
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
A shoe store

3190
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Oh my god shit

3191
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
All they're doing is fucking separating

3192
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Everything out even more

3193
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Than it was before

3194
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
These aren't new features folks

3195
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
These are just the same goddamn features

3196
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Just spread out even more

3197
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Between like each store instead of nooks carrying

3198
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Pretty much everything it's just like

3199
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Nooks is carrying

3200
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
No I don't even know if there is a nooks in this game

3201
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
But it's like a store carrying this type of item

3202
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
This store is carrying this type of item

3203
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
This store is carrying this type of item

3204
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
This guy says you know

3205
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
It's all fucking filler is all what it is

3206
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Where's my store that sells classic NES games

3207
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
I'm not fucking there so that's why I'm not buying your damn game

3208
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Oh I'm sorry that'd be the eShop I guess

3209
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Yeah that would be the Nintendo store

3210
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Wouldn't that be hilarious if there was a link

3211
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Within Animal Crossing to the eShop

3212
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
There's how you can integrate

3213
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Some stuff in

3214
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
That would be true innovation like the NES

3215
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Carts are back oh but you have to buy them

3216
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
As DLC now

3217
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
People do that

3218
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
And you know I could see people doing that

3219
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
But it'd be cool to have like

3220
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
Demo versus fuck that you know what

3221
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
It's just still stupid because they don't have the classic games in there

3222
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:55,000
I would be scared for them to have demos for one reason

3223
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Look at the demos that they had in Smash Brothers Brawl

3224
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
I can play the

3225
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Oh the first minute of the game

3226
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Over and over

3227
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Oh look at the progress I'm not making

3228
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:08,000
AcidicVampire in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says

3229
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
I was hoping for a shoes store

3230
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
You know now that I think about it

3231
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
I'll be able to make my character wear high heels

3232
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
I'm a lumberjack and I don't care

3233
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
I'm okay

3234
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Sleep all night on a wiggle day

3235
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Anyhow

3236
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Dark Sakura let's move on with some rapid fire news

3237
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Well how about something for a game that's been out for two years

3238
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is getting new DLC

3239
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Yes

3240
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
On August 19th

3241
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
And it was

3242
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
It's going to be on the two year anniversary

3243
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Of the Xbox Live release

3244
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:43,000
That's a long time to go by

3245
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:46,000
It's going to be a $5 pack, 400 points

3246
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
And it has a new character

3247
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Wallace Wells

3248
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
So you can be fantastic

3249
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
And he doesn't actually need weapons

3250
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:57,000
So I think he's just going to text people to death

3251
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
And it will be on PSN by the way

3252
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
This occasion calls for some

3253
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Animanguchi

3254
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Animanguchi I can never say their name

3255
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Animanguchi

3256
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
I like the theme

3257
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
The theme was great but Another Winter

3258
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
The very first level stage

3259
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Actually you know what one of my other songs on repeat is?

3260
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Threshold

3261
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:36,000
I love the picture

3262
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
We've seen them live

3263
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
It was fantastic

3264
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
In other news

3265
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Jet Set Radio

3266
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Will be back for 9 bucks

3267
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
It's going to be a PS3

3268
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
And

3269
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
The PS3 version will be

3270
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
Available for Playstation Plus users

3271
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
On September 11th

3272
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
And September 18th

3273
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
The version will be out for everyone else

3274
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Xbox Live Arcade and Steam versions will be out

3275
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
On September 19th

3276
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Also for 10 bucks

3277
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Vita version will be out October 16th

3278
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
It doesn't really say anything else about that

3279
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
So

3280
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
I'll just hook up my Dreamcast

3281
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
And play the good version that has Bjork in it

3282
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
And birthday cake

3283
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Shut up and eat me

3284
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
Too bad no Bon Appetit

3285
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
And then

3286
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
They Bleed Pixels

3287
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Which is the best name of the game ever

3288
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
It's going to be out for Steam

3289
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Instead of Xbox Live

3290
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Indie games

3291
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
So

3292
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
That was the official word by

3293
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
SpookySquidGames which is also a cool name

3294
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Basically

3295
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Their creative director said that

3296
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
They want to reach a larger audience

3297
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
And PC and Steam is just the place to do that

3298
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
So go check it out

3299
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
It's supposed to be really

3300
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Freaking hard

3301
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
And this says the more and better

3302
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
You kill the faster you fill your checkpoint meter

3303
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
I like killing

3304
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
In games

3305
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Alright is that it? That would be it sir

3306
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
That's it for rapid fire news

3307
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Let's get into the Fookal Question of the Week

3308
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Thanks for having me

3309
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Fookal

3310
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Every week on our Facebook and Google Plus communities

3311
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
We like to ask a question and get your feedback

3312
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
And you put Facebook and Google

3313
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Together you get Fookal

3314
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
And it's just fun to say

3315
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
Fookal

3316
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Alright our question this week

3317
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Is

3318
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
Where the hell is it?

3319
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
Tonight

3320
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
I forgot how to navigate Google Plus

3321
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
I'm sorry

3322
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Nobody left a comment on Google Plus tonight

3323
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
There is officially nobody left on Google Plus

3324
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
Little tumbleweed rolls by

3325
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Alright well here

3326
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Let's assume people that use Google Plus

3327
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Also watch the Olympics on a six hour

3328
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Tape delay so

3329
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Here's the question anyway

3330
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Tonight we have a story on a game from the Super Nintendo days

3331
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Where it was discovered this week that an unofficial

3332
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Never released version of it contained some pretty

3333
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Salty language which obviously was the

3334
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
NBA Jam game we were talking about earlier

3335
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
This had us thinking about

3336
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Shocking moments in video games

3337
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Have you ever been shocked by dialogue

3338
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
In a game or something

3339
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
That just happened in the plot

3340
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
I wasn't necessarily going to like F word shocking

3341
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Just like were you ever like

3342
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Oh my God

3343
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
What about something that just made you say

3344
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Oh no they just did not

3345
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
What was a video game moment that had

3346
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
You shocked

3347
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
You spoonie bard

3348
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
Was that really a shocking moment for you?

3349
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
Considering I didn't play that game until it was released on the Playstation

3350
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
That was more of a WT

3351
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
I was like what's a spoonie bard

3352
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
I just thought it appropriate after I read the question

3353
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Alright we have some great answers tonight on the Facebooks

3354
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
So I'm going to go through and read some of the answers here

3355
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Picaruno says

3356
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
You have to be pretty fucking filthy to shock me

3357
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
Although I think Brutal Legend handled the

3358
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Swearing gore in a funny way

3359
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Stopping the action just before an F bomb

3360
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
Or beheading to politely ask if you would like to enable

3361
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
The fucks and guts

3362
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Was that really what it was called? Fucks and guts?

3363
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Ragenator says

3364
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
I'd have to go with an unconventional choice

3365
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
The Super Nintendo port of Mortal Kombat

3366
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Ported by Acclaim

3367
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
For what was included in the game, but for what was not

3368
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Included in the game

3369
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Meaning that the game was sanitized

3370
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
This port has become the poster child of why games

3371
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Shouldn't be censored

3372
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
And has given Nintendo a proverbial black eye

3373
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
For a good many years

3374
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
That was an interesting interpretation of the question

3375
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Because he took it to mean I was so shocked in a bad way

3376
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Like I was shocked at how shitty this turned out

3377
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
That's kind of an interesting way to go with the question

3378
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
They're punching the sweat off my face

3379
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
That sweat is so shocking

3380
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
Let's see, moving on

3381
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Stan says

3382
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
I just watched a battle scene for Persona 3

3383
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
For the first time ever

3384
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
And my jaw seriously dropped when I saw that they had

3385
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Summoned their Personas by shooting themselves

3386
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
In the head

3387
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
I'm sure that that reason was explained in game

3388
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
But WTF

3389
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Ratchet Tag says

3390
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Silent Hill 2

3391
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
I was playing through for the first time and there was a scene

3392
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
In which you're walking down a hall and see Pyramid Head

3393
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Doing really unspeakable things to mannequins

3394
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
I was a bit young so it was pretty shocking

3395
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
And disturbing

3396
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
If you have played this you know what I'm talking about

3397
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
He included a video with his answer

3398
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
And I think we all know that scene in Silent Hill 2

3399
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
And of course the preview kicks in

3400
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
And tells you exactly what the video is

3401
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
In advance

3402
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Which is both a helpful and hurtful thing

3403
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Now Shane replied and also said something

3404
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
From Silent Hill 2

3405
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
I'll just put a spoiler warning out there

3406
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
Even though this game is almost 10 years old at this point

3407
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
It's when you find out that James smothered

3408
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
You with a pillow

3409
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
That was ridiculous the first time you found out

3410
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
It's a 10 year old game people

3411
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Especially because they showed him doing it

3412
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Runner up would be when Kaiden

3413
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
Got his head bashed in on Mars

3414
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
In Mass Effect 3

3415
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
I literally got up from my computer right after that happened

3416
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
And walked around to try and lose

3417
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Some of my anger I was filled with

3418
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
This brings us to a very interesting question

3419
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
A Shane question that I would have to ask him someday

3420
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
And that would be

3421
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
What if

3422
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Let's say that BioWare

3423
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
Never plans to make another Mass Effect game

3424
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
But

3425
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
They'll make a Mass Effect 4

3426
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Only if Kaiden dies

3427
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
In the first 5 minutes

3428
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
For good

3429
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Or Ashley depending on how you've played the games

3430
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Then what do you do?

3431
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Do you take another Mass Effect game

3432
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
Because hey more Mass Effect

3433
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
And have your favorite character die

3434
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Or do you say you know what

3435
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
I choose to remember these games as they were

3436
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Not dead

3437
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
That's quite the dilemma isn't it

3438
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
What would you do Dark Sakura

3439
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Let's say Mass Effect 4 with Garrus dead

3440
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
In the first 5 minutes or no more Mass Effect ever

3441
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
What would you do?

3442
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
No more Mass Effect ever

3443
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Interesting alright

3444
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Well I don't know because if they said it in another universe

3445
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
Totally then that's fine or in the future

3446
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
It depends on the situation

3447
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Alright

3448
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Let's see

3449
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Ospher says Soul Calibur 5

3450
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
When Maxie beats Astaroth

3451
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
He stares at the camera angrily and shouts

3452
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
God damn freak

3453
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
That's just rude

3454
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Irene replied and said there's some obvious ones

3455
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Chrono dying, Eris dying, Samus being a girl

3456
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Justin Bailey, the upside down castle

3457
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
That was like 7 answers

3458
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
But one that kind of threw me off

3459
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Was the revelation about the main antagonist

3460
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Lady Mamiya

3461
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
At the end of Sweet Home

3462
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
No spoilers in case someone actually wanted to play through it

3463
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
It just seemed intense

3464
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
For an NES game

3465
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
By the way I just got a text message

3466
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
No more Mass Effect

3467
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Thank you Shane

3468
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
At least we know he's listening now

3469
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Even though he missed the first half

3470
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
Shane, yes no more Mass Effect

3471
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Except I would cry if there was no

3472
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Now if there was no cadence

3473
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
Sorry I wouldn't care

3474
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Monty Boggs in our chat room says

3475
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Ashley just tried to kill me so whatever let her die

3476
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Well you can let Garrus shoot her

3477
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Alright

3478
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Mandrew replies and said

3479
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
You don't know Jack

3480
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
A buddy of mine and I were playing

3481
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
And we had to type

3482
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
And we had to type an answer for a question

3483
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
And he typed in fuck you

3484
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Jack responded with fuck me

3485
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
No fuck you

3486
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
And deducted like 10,000 points or something

3487
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
When you're in 6th grade that throws off your guard

3488
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
That's awesome

3489
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
I never knew that could happen

3490
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
But that's hilarious

3491
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Extifer replied and said

3492
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Hellscream called Sylvanas a bitch

3493
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
In Warcraft

3494
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
I'm sure there are several I'm not thinking of

3495
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
But it all comes back to wow right

3496
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
How about the dead babies in wow

3497
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
You know what I'm talking about

3498
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
I think so yeah

3499
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Where the troll lady is and she has all the babies

3500
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
And then you have all the skeletons behind it

3501
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
And the leather tents that the gnolls have

3502
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
That are made out of peoples faces

3503
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
Clover Nikon replied

3504
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
And said Silent Hill 2

3505
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
Which it was referred to earlier with Pyramid Head

3506
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
And the Amanakans

3507
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Kareem J replied and said

3508
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Gears of War 3 a certain character dies

3509
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
I won't say who but I thought it would be a character

3510
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
They wouldn't kill off

3511
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
How many games have we talked about tonight

3512
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
That are upwards of 5 years old

3513
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
And have danced around spoilers

3514
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
And now we're talking about Gears of War 3

3515
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
Well I think it's nice that people are trying to be respectful

3516
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
I'm not going to criticize people for being respectful

3517
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Of the spoilers

3518
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Dark Charger replies and says

3519
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Eternal Darkness

3520
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Oh

3521
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
That's a game they need to bring back on the Wii U

3522
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Don't they

3523
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
That's a game that would

3524
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
The problem with bringing a game like that

3525
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Is now it has a standard

3526
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
For what's going to be scary

3527
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
And you can't do the same thing

3528
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
You can't do the same things all over again

3529
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Unless it's like literally a

3530
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
Graphically improved port

3531
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
But people would be like this game isn't scary

3532
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Oh

3533
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
You can't redo a game like that

3534
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
It's not going to happen well until there's a

3535
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Dramatic shift in technology

3536
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
Like immersion we were talking about before

3537
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Until you can really have

3538
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
Something different to

3539
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
To throw at the player again

3540
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
It's not going to be interesting

3541
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
Oh wait let me get right on the mic here

3542
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
But imagine the things that they did with

3543
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
Fatal Frame 4 and the remake of Fatal Frame 2

3544
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Add that to the whole sanity

3545
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Thing and all the things that they could do

3546
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
To fuck with you with Eternal Darkness

3547
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
Yeah but the Haunted House and Fatal Frame 2

3548
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
For people like us is stupid and boring

3549
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
Yeah but I'm sure that they could do some

3550
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
And that's what I'm talking about

3551
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
The bonuses and the extras and the things

3552
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
That they would be throwing in nowadays

3553
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Are dumb and boring

3554
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
And Eternal Darkness as

3555
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Kinda cheesy as the game was

3556
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
The effects were really good

3557
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
And it made for a good way to keep you

3558
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
To keep you through the game

3559
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
Alright let me finish the comment here from Dark Charger

3560
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
If you went in there spoiler free

3561
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
Random noises, skewed perspectives

3562
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
And even a blue screen of death made you question

3563
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Your own sanity as you played through

3564
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Chiggers replied and said

3565
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
The first time I ever heard shit

3566
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
In a game was when Barret said it in

3567
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
Final Fantasy 7, I was awestruck

3568
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
Uh actually

3569
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Sit your ass down in that chair

3570
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
And drink your goddamn tea

3571
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
And lastly Tigerclaw says

3572
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
To me the most shocking moment in a video game

3573
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Was in Bionic Commando

3574
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
When you see Master D aka

3575
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Hitler's head explode

3576
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
That's pretty awesome

3577
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
I read all the answers cause they were all really good

3578
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
Thank you guys at facebook.com

3579
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
Orange Lounge Radio

3580
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
What about you guys?

3581
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Shocking moments in video games

3582
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
I'm gonna go with a really cliche

3583
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
One that was already mentioned but it really was the most

3584
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Shocking moment for me was when Aris died

3585
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
In Final Fantasy 7 like for real

3586
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
For real I was like

3587
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
That just fucking happened

3588
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Really? Like they're gonna just off

3589
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
A character, video game characters don't die

3590
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
They just regenerate

3591
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
I cheered, I cheered

3592
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
There's not really much that shocks me in a game

3593
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
I mean maybe

3594
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Selly's throwing herself off a cliff

3595
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
I was like, did she just throw herself off a cliff?

3596
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Stupid bitch

3597
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
Other than that

3598
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
I was like, oh

3599
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
I haven't really had a shocking moment

3600
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Um

3601
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Oh I know one thing that actually

3602
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Did kinda gross me out

3603
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Well okay first of all Robbie the Rabbit

3604
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Always kinda creeps me out

3605
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
The big head in Silent Hill 4

3606
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
And I knew the big head was there

3607
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
But even seeing the big head was like

3608
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
Ugh stop looking at me

3609
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Cause I have a thing about big heads

3610
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
And I don't like them

3611
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Like we had

3612
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
Like the um

3613
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
The clown face in Fun House

3614
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
The pinball table

3615
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
That thing creeps me out

3616
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
I mean it doesn't matter that

3617
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
The goal is to hit it with a pinball

3618
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
It's still creepy

3619
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
And that's in pinball

3620
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
I'm gonna say a really recent one

3621
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
The most shocking moment for me a recent game

3622
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
That I actually played again this week for the first time in a while

3623
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Journey on the Playstation 3

3624
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
Because I had no idea

3625
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
Going into it that it was a online

3626
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
Game and the moment I saw another person

3627
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
There was kind of shocking like

3628
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
What?

3629
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
And the fact that they weren't acting like

3630
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Jason saying go up here

3631
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Go over here

3632
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
Journey

3633
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
Is such a fucking

3634
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
Great game like it's just

3635
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
I played through again

3636
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
This week and it's just oh my god

3637
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Like the way I'm like talking to people

3638
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
I was showing the game to Extifer and like

3639
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
I was like yeah and that's another person and then

3640
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
The person was like trying to like

3641
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
Do the little singing to tell me

3642
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
That there was a thing I was missing

3643
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
In the little place where they were standing

3644
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
And it was just I don't

3645
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
I don't know how to explain it it's such an experience

3646
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
I still need to play that game

3647
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
You really do Journey is an outstanding game

3648
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
It damn well may be my game of the year I'm not sure yet

3649
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Uh

3650
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Do you have any shocking moments?

3651
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
Yes Loki shocking moments

3652
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
I don't actually I was trying to think of something but

3653
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
No

3654
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
I have two interpretations of them

3655
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
One of them Ryan reminded me of

3656
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
The one that I have in mind

3657
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Literally shocking in terms of like

3658
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
The frame one and two

3659
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
To like an added effect

3660
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Really did have a pretty profound impact on me

3661
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
I've always been weird when it comes to ghosts

3662
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
And that kind of stuff and the whole

3663
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
The lore and the situation

3664
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
The sound the ambience that kind of stuff

3665
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
Those games really creeped me out for a very long time

3666
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
I could talk about this for hours but this is a

3667
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
Three oh wait four hour show

3668
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
The example that Ryan reminded me of

3669
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
That's actually really true

3670
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
Braid

3671
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
Braid was an amazing game

3672
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
Great platformer great everything

3673
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
I absolutely loved it it's one of the few titles

3674
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
That I've actually 100% achieved

3675
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
And in general just sat down

3676
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
And worked my way through with very

3677
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
Little to distract me in between

3678
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
Um but the story of it

3679
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Is also ridiculously profound

3680
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
And the very last level of Braid

3681
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
After you do all you get all of the puzzle

3682
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
Pieces you put them all together and you

3683
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Do the final like unraveling

3684
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
In technically world one

3685
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Um

3686
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
How do I do this spoiler free

3687
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
Um it's just the best representation

3688
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Of two sides of the story

3689
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
That I've ever seen in gaming

3690
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
And really in media in general

3691
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
We have actdeft in our chatroom

3692
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
At live.vognetwork.com says

3693
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
Braid sucks I hate the game haters to the left

3694
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Alright

3695
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Uh Ry

3696
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
We'll end this with you any shocking moments

3697
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Of course since I asked her

3698
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
Back channel if she had any suggestions

3699
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
I just took away her suggestion but that's okay

3700
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
I was the one playing it anyway

3701
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
Ha ha ha

3702
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
Um

3703
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
I mean I was happy that the fact

3704
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
That Diablo 3 nothing got spoiled for me

3705
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
So um things happening

3706
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
In that one I was pretty surprised

3707
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
With but

3708
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Antishock

3709
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
The Diablo

3710
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Uh

3711
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Whimsishire the Diablo

3712
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Pinata there that's the word I'm looking for

3713
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
My Diablo Pinata? What about it?

3714
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
Oh it was hilarious to me

3715
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
When I was going through Whimsishire and I found

3716
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
The big Diablo Pinata

3717
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
It's even more awesome when I broke it and I got

3718
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
The Horadric hamburger

3719
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
The Horadric hamburger

3720
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
This very

3721
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
Demonic you know undertone

3722
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
Dark game and then you have Whimsishire

3723
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
I mean that's classic Blizzard

3724
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
It's beautiful but that was fun

3725
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Alright we're gonna move on with some more

3726
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
News for you guys and of course emails coming up

3727
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
As well as phone calls

3728
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Uh Loki

3729
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
So there's already been hints that this was coming

3730
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
But Valve has

3731
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Finally made it known

3732
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
That they're gonna be rolling out

3733
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Other

3734
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
Non-game software on Steam

3735
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
Coming September 5th

3736
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
And these will include other

3737
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
Include I guess Steamworks functionality

3738
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
Allowing automatic updating

3739
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
And cloud storage

3740
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
As well as other Steam features

3741
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
And they have everything from like

3742
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Construction to accounting, animation

3743
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
Design, illustration, photo editing

3744
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Software training, web publishing

3745
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
Etc

3746
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
So lots of stuff

3747
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
Interesting and then of course

3748
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
I guess titles will continue to hit

3749
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Steam after the initial

3750
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
September 5th launch and they

3751
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
I guess developers will be able to submit

3752
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Their perspective

3753
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
Pieces of software via the

3754
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Steam Greenlight program

3755
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
Did Steam just reinvent

3756
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
The starter?

3757
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Um

3758
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Maybe

3759
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
It's not

3760
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
To their credit it's not hey

3761
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
I want the game so I'll

3762
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Fund you this $5 but it's

3763
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
More crowd sourcing the idea

3764
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
In the first place

3765
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
It has it's own potential but I'm sure in time

3766
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
We'll see it's own demise, it's own draw

3767
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Not it's own demise, it's own drawbacks

3768
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Um

3769
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
Kind of brings more light to a comment that was made

3770
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
A couple weeks ago when we talked about

3771
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
There was something where um

3772
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
And it always seemed like a weird comparison

3773
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
But Gabe Newell from Valve

3774
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
Said something about yeah we were talking to

3775
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Adobe and trying to convince them that

3776
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
Photoshop should be free and I think a lot

3777
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
Of us were like alright whatever they were talking

3778
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
And now we're like oh

3779
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
That's why you would have had

3780
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Valve talking to Adobe because they're trying

3781
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
To get some of that software on this new

3782
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
Thing and they're trying to have the killer title

3783
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
So that they're the additional

3784
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Content of the store is actually

3785
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
Relevant to people

3786
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
It's interesting do you think this could be successful?

3787
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Yeah definitely

3788
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
I do too

3789
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
They should make the entire suite free

3790
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
And give it to me

3791
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
Looking forward to that Steam holiday sale

3792
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
Wait a minute didn't you say you didn't want Photoshop

3793
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
To be free I seen you remember on that episode

3794
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
I just want it free for me

3795
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Oh okay

3796
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
Not free for all

3797
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Group of designers

3798
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
That clears everything up thank you

3799
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
And InDesign

3800
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
Well this won't be free

3801
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
In fact it will be $109 if you

3802
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Miss the Kickstarter

3803
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
The oh yeah

3804
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
The oh yeah

3805
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
The oh yeah got funded and all that

3806
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Good stuff boy did they get funded

3807
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
$8.5 million

3808
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
It was supposed to raise

3809
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
$950,000 which was a pretty lofty

3810
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Goal to begin with

3811
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
$1 million in 8 hours

3812
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
$8.5 million

3813
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
After all was said and done when the Kickstarter closed

3814
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
According to CEO

3815
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Julie Urman of the oh yeah

3816
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
We've been blown away the whole time

3817
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
So there you go

3818
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
Also in news there

3819
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
It's $109 like I said before

3820
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
So it's a little bit more expensive

3821
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Than the $99 during the Kickstarter

3822
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
It's $119 if you

3823
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Live in another place

3824
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Not the US somewhere foreign

3825
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
You get the little console

3826
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
You can pre-order it now

3827
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
They're saying now delivery is expected to commence

3828
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
In April of 2013

3829
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Is that because they're going to do the Kickstarter people in March?

3830
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Yes Interesting

3831
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
So they're not just subtly

3832
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
Rolling back the clock already

3833
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
No they even said

3834
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
To ensure that they can get the Kickstarter ones out first

3835
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
Interesting

3836
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Also in oh yeah news

3837
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Four controllers will be supported and

3838
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Namco Bandai is in discussions

3839
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
With the company

3840
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
So I'm sure that just means oh hooray

3841
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
Another re-release of all those Namco classics

3842
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Like Pac-Man

3843
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
I think they were talking about Soul Calibur

3844
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
The Android

3845
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Like how they have the

3846
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
Slightly toned down versions for

3847
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Android and stuff

3848
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Interesting

3849
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
Very interesting

3850
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
And

3851
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Hopefully

3852
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Rich Racer

3853
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Although

3854
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
I hope it's not Ridge Racer

3855
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Like it was on the Vita

3856
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Because that Ridge Racer sucked balls

3857
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
Ridge Racer

3858
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
That would be great if that could be a

3859
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
Launch title

3860
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
It does launch on every system

3861
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
By the way I love this comment from Bobby Blackwolf

3862
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
In our chat room

3863
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
Namco Bandai in discussions

3864
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Indie game heaven

3865
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Remember how this console was going to be the indie console

3866
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
It's going to be as good for indie games

3867
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
As the Xbox is

3868
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
Alright moving on

3869
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
Dark Sakura

3870
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Well

3871
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
Star Trek Infinite Space, I'm sure people

3872
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Saw all the ads all over Facebook for the beta

3873
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
And everything, guess what?

3874
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Canceled, not going to happen

3875
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
And they even, it was supposed to be set during

3876
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
Deep Space Nine and they even got like

3877
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
A bunch of the cast

3878
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
From Deep Space Nine to lend their talents

3879
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
And nope they couldn't

3880
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Get any funding

3881
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
They couldn't find a publisher

3882
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
So it's not happening

3883
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Sad face

3884
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
The demise of MMOs

3885
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Has begun

3886
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
No publisher for an MMO? How does that happen?

3887
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
The fact that all Star Trek is right now is the Abrams movies

3888
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
I really wish there would be a new series

3889
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Cry

3890
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
As long as it's nothing like Enterprise

3891
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
You know they have a

3892
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Kickstarter right now that actually has

3893
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Michael Dorn in it

3894
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Oh really?

3895
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
It's a freaking Kickstarter

3896
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
It's a Star Trek documentary

3897
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
With Star Trek actors

3898
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
Yeah

3899
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Because there haven't already been

3900
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
At least two

3901
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Is Kickstarter Rule 35 now?

3902
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
If it exists there's a Kickstarter for it?

3903
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
Possibly actually

3904
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
That's just what I got from

3905
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
A couple of instances in this episode

3906
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Alright a few more news stories

3907
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
For you guys and then we're going to get to the mailbag

3908
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
And before too long the Skype line at

3909
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
1-877-GAME-OLR

3910
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
Or our username on Skype OrangeLoungeRadio

3911
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
But first

3912
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Boy Rhode Island really put their money

3913
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
In the wrong company

3914
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
So 38 Studios

3915
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
You know of course they kind of

3916
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Tumbled and failed

3917
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
And yeah

3918
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
So now Rhode Island owns

3919
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
The rest of 38 Studios

3920
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Including the assets, the rights to the single player

3921
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
Game that they put out

3922
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
And of course their unfinished

3923
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
MMO project

3924
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
And now they're trying to sell off

3925
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
These assets to recoup as much

3926
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
Of the loan as possible

3927
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
And so maybe

3928
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
That means that we'll see a new Kingdoms of Amalur

3929
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
Game

3930
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Or whatever it's going to be called

3931
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
Because somebody will have to buy the rights inevitably

3932
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
But it's going to go at bargain basement prices

3933
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Which is kind of too bad

3934
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
Hey EA, you want another franchise?

3935
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
The first game wasn't terrible

3936
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
I don't know

3937
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
Do you think that's what's going to happen?

3938
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
Do you think EA will snatch it up?

3939
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Do you think anybody's going to be interested in this?

3940
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
I think someone will snatch it up

3941
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
I'm not sure if it's going to be EA

3942
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
It could be Ubisoft or something, who knows

3943
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
Well whenever that game comes out

3944
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
One thing you could use to buy that game

3945
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Because you know it'll cost 60 plus dollars

3946
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
Is trade in credit

3947
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
In fact GameStop came out this week

3948
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
And said that 70%

3949
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Of trade credit is spent on

3950
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
New games

3951
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
That's totally hurting the games industry

3952
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
With all those used game sales

3953
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
To me this is kind of a duh

3954
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
This comes from

3955
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
GameStop president

3956
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
Paul Reines

3957
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Talked to Gamasutra

3958
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
And basically said this in an interview

3959
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
That was about the total sales numbers

3960
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
And the $11 billion and so forth

3961
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
And basically was talking about

3962
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
Everybody always criticizes about used trade ins

3963
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
But he said

3964
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
We're really not cannibalizing new game sales

3965
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
It's a common misconception

3966
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
So my answer to developers is that we are driving growth

3967
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
In a category that needs to grow

3968
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
We think there's a real lack of awareness

3969
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
As far as how trade ins are good for the industry

3970
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
He may have a point in a way

3971
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Because yeah, this is so obvious to me

3972
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
Because A, for one

3973
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
GameStop gives you more money

3974
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
For the games than they do for cash

3975
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Right?

3976
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
And they give you more money when you're pre-ordering

3977
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
They'll give you bonuses when you're pre-ordering

3978
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
As well and kind of like reinvesting

3979
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Your money into the games that way

3980
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
Games are fucking expensive

3981
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
$60 for a new game

3982
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Is a lot of money

3983
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Exactly, and also that money can go

3984
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
To points, cards, whatever

3985
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
To buy more DLC

3986
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
So that's why I never understood

3987
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
These people like, well we need to get rid of the used game market

3988
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Yeah, go ahead and do that

3989
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
And then you'll see your fucking numbers drop

3990
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
Because no one's buying your games

3991
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Because one, they're fucking bitter at you for

3992
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
Getting rid of used game sales

3993
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
Or the campaign or DRM

3994
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
That you're putting in place there

3995
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
And B, they're not going to have the money to do it anymore

3996
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
But my whole thing is

3997
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
I just prefer to cut out the middle man

3998
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
And sell him on eBay

3999
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
Exactly

4000
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
And use that money to buy whatever I want

4001
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
A new video game or

4002
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Maybe my shiny new iPad

4003
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
I understand, and sometimes

4004
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
It's a matter of convenience

4005
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
Sometimes you don't want to wait for that

4006
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Or you don't want to go through the hassle to do that

4007
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
And the opportunity costs

4008
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
And you can either get X amount of money now

4009
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
Or you don't

4010
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
And that's the thing about GameStop

4011
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Is when you go in there

4012
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
At least that should be the way

4013
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
You go in there, you say, okay here's the games I have

4014
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
What will you give me for them?

4015
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
If that's not satisfactory to you, sell them on eBay

4016
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
I mean, you can figure

4017
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
You can call them up

4018
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
I don't know if you can call them up

4019
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
But you can go down there and say, here's what I have

4020
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
If that's not enough money for you

4021
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
What are your game values?

4022
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Some games they do

4023
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
I don't think they do for all of them

4024
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
And I'm sure it will vary based on

4025
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
The condition your games are in

4026
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
It's not like they're forcing you to

4027
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Trade this stuff in

4028
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
Sorry, you already gave it to us

4029
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
You can't have your games back

4030
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
They're not going to do that

4031
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
Or even on top of that

4032
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
You can take them to another game store

4033
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Not GameStop that also does trades

4034
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
And ask them, hey what will you give me for this?

4035
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
Figure out who's going to give you the best value

4036
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Rama in our chat room says

4037
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
I don't trade in games

4038
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
When I do, it'll never be GameStop

4039
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
Well certainly other companies are trying to copy

4040
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
What's happened with GameStop's success

4041
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
I think Best Buy did it

4042
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
I don't think they do it anymore

4043
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
I think Amazon's still doing it though

4044
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Because Amazon's got everything

4045
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
We already learned that

4046
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
Best Buy still takes in trade-ins

4047
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
The one that's close by us

4048
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
They actually have a whole little station

4049
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
With a counter set up

4050
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
And somebody dedicated at that counter

4051
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
I was not aware

4052
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
I don't usually look into that here

4053
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
And also too with GameStop now

4054
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
What they're trying to do to get more people to trade in

4055
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
Stuff is they don't just sell games anymore

4056
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
They sell electronics, phones

4057
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
But the nice thing about Amazon

4058
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
Is that you can trade into games to Amazon

4059
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
And then put that money towards a vibrating heating pad

4060
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
As we learned about earlier in the show

4061
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
Or alien space still though

4062
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:32,000
If they have that, you know

4063
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
You never know

4064
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
Gonna trade in new Super Mario Brothers Wii

4065
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
And get some hot Turian cock

4066
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
Alright

4067
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
Mmmmmmm

4068
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
Don't make me make the noise, Rob

4069
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Alright, let's

4070
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
I will make you make the noise

4071
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
Of opening the mail

4072
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
Oh, there you go, no more noise

4073
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
Not that

4074
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
How's that? Alright

4075
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
Let's go to the mailbag

4076
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
Every week, DarkSakura opens the mailbag

4077
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com

4078
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
And read some of her favorite emails

4079
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
For you right now

4080
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
Sure

4081
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
Okay

4082
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Um, this one's actually a contest

4083
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
A contest

4084
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
A contest?

4085
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
A giveaway

4086
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
And wants me to do it via email like this

4087
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
In the email

4088
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
There's lots of giveaways

4089
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
My gosh, I've got a code I've got to try and give away at some point

4090
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
And we also still have to pick the winner

4091
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
For when Brad packs stuff

4092
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
No, it's not

4093
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
I saw that one in the mailbag earlier

4094
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
I will read it

4095
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
Hey, OLR crew, I apologize for intruding in your mailbag segment

4096
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
But I would like to give away a PlayStation Network game code

4097
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
To one of your live listeners in the U.S. Canada

4098
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Of Puerto Rico

4099
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
The code is for

4100
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
Dazimon Kids

4101
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
An import PS1 classic side-scrolling shooter

4102
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
The let's play

4103
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
I should keep it, never mind, no I'm kidding

4104
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
So the let's players design their own levels

4105
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
Just to keep this contest simple

4106
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
I would like for the lovely DarkSakura

4107
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
Or equivalent sassy mail host

4108
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
To say

4109
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
Hey

4110
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
To say the code at the end of this email

4111
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
And leave it to the first listener

4112
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
Who can claim the code to win

4113
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
Dazimon Kids can be played on a PS3, PSP

4114
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
Or in the near future, Vita

4115
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
The code can be redeemed from the PlayStation Store

4116
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
App on a console

4117
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Or at account.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com

4118
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
Good luck to everyone

4119
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
This comes from the Nasty Canasta

4120
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
I love that name

4121
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
So are you ready?

4122
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
Get your pencils, get your keyboards ready

4123
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Get a free game, here you go

4124
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
Picture pages, picture pages, time to get you

4125
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
Nobody gets picture pages?

4126
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
Bite me

4127
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:48,000
T-H-P-N

4128
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:52,000
P-L-N-P

4129
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
T-M-N-3

4130
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
There you go

4131
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
Not saying it again

4132
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
I want to know who wins it

4133
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
Alright, next email

4134
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
Yeah

4135
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
Um, this

4136
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
I had to laugh, I had to laugh

4137
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
There's a kickstarter to do Cheetamen 2

4138
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
So that they're fixing it to make it playable

4139
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
This is Konami Be Ashamed

4140
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:20,000
Oh, I'm not even gonna bother

4141
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
Okay

4142
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
The subject of this one is Trainer

4143
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
Dear DarkSakura, which would offend you more?

4144
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:32,000
Me saying Samantha Trainer is a hotter piece of ass than Garos Vakarian

4145
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Or

4146
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
There's a link

4147
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
Says this

4148
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
This being the song Windows Down by Big Time Rush

4149
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
This song that samples Song 2 by Blur

4150
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
And if by sample you mean rips off completely in ruins

4151
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
Ugh

4152
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
And that's Stay Black Entertainment

4153
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
Um

4154
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
Well given that I can't actually listen to it

4155
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
Because I have the sound off

4156
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
Um

4157
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
Well

4158
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
If Damon Auburn sued the crap out of Big Time Rush

4159
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Then that's okay

4160
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
Um, Samantha Trainer is just annoying

4161
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
And everyone's entitled to their own opinion

4162
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
I would say she's a hot piece of ass for what it's worth

4163
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
The shower scene

4164
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
Like, I'm gay

4165
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
And I still kind of get a semi on that shower scene

4166
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
It's really hot

4167
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
She wasn't even naked

4168
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
What's up? Who showers in their bra?

4169
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
Motherfuck

4170
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
Moving on

4171
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Cock teases

4172
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Given that this is a lesbian shower scene

4173
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
Would it be a clit tease?

4174
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
It'd be doubly hot because there's lesbians involved

4175
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
Yeah, but Shepard wasn't even naked

4176
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
Or in her undies

4177
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
It's called, they didn't want the game to have an AO rating

4178
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
So she had a bra on

4179
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
I think it should

4180
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
It's like Showgirls on VH1

4181
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
Have you ever watched

4182
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
I posted something on Tumblr a while back

4183
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
And if someone can

4184
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
If you can find it on my Tumblr, relink it

4185
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
It's the romance scenes in Mass Effect 2

4186
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
Done with fly cam

4187
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
So you can see all the little rendering cheats

4188
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
That they did and like how Garrus' hand goes

4189
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
Like right through the middle of her chest and everything

4190
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
And it's really funny

4191
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
Calima

4192
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
Yeah, I know

4193
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Hey, OLR, I'm writing you from my phone

4194
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
So please excuse my lack of form slash grammar

4195
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
Slash bad spelling

4196
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Lack of bad spelling? Why would I complain?

4197
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
Or anything else that relates to improper use of the English language

4198
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
It looks like Rama says

4199
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
He got it, by the way

4200
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
That code earlier

4201
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
And Black Wolf says, well sorry podcast listeners

4202
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
Guess you aren't a part of this

4203
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Well, how about this

4204
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
This is your code

4205
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
And this is a code for

4206
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet

4207
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
Oh, I can't do it this way

4208
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
Because then somebody who's listening live

4209
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
Is gonna go to the podcast as soon as it comes out

4210
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
And pull this code out of it

4211
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
So I have to think of a way to give this code away

4212
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
I have a code for Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet

4213
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
That was generously donated by Pika Uno

4215

Random picked email? Alright, fair enough

Send an email

To mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

4221
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
And tell us how jealous

4222
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
You are

4223
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
That the live listeners get all the good giveaways

4224
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Tell us about your insane jealousy

4225
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
And you may win Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet

4226
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
We will give it to

4227
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
The

4228
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
What, 15th person email

4229
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
Or whoever's the most fucked up

4230
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
No, because you can't say that's too vague

4231
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
You have to have a definitive answer

4232
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
It's gonna be the 15th email

4233
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
And if for whatever reason 15 people don't email us

4234
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
We'll randomly draw one

4235
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
Then we'll randomly draw one

4236
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
So there you go

4237
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet on the Xbox 360

4238
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Just for the podcast listeners

4239
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
There's one they can participate in

4240
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
Can I finish reading this? Yes

4241
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
I have two questions for you tonight

4242
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
First, is there a way to stream the show

4243
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
From an Android device

4244
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
And if so, how does one go about setting that up?

4245
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
Well, first of all, you sell your phone and get an iPhone

4246
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
Stop, stop

4247
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
To stream the show via an Android device

4248
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
Go to vognetwork.com

4249
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
The good news is, the website's in HTML5

4250
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
So you actually should be able to

4251
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
And this works just for the record on iPhone as well

4252
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
You should be able to go to the site

4253
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
And just hit play

4254
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
And it'll work

4255
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
If for whatever reason that doesn't work

4256
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
There is an app, and I know it's on iPhone

4257
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
I'm pretty sure they wrote this for Android as well

4258
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
It's called TuneIn

4259
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
And that will allow you to listen live

4260
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
If you've been here last night from the gym

4261
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
Yes, by the way, I joined a gym

4262
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
Which is a whole other story I'll have to get into at some point

4263
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
But actually, listen to the conversation live

4264
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
On TuneIn

4265
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
So, I don't recall ever hearing anything

4266
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
About how one goes to set this up

4267
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
One email per person, you smartass listeners

4268
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
I will check your IP

4269
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
I don't recall ever hearing anything

4270
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
About streaming since you switched to VoG

4271
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
Please provide any

4272
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
Okay, we already did all that

4273
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
Second, what do you believe to be the main cause of rhythm gaming

4274
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
And we'll be seeing a return to the genre soon

4275
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
Well, anything that goes down has to come back up

4276
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:04,000
Some people attribute it to Guitar Hero oversaturating the market

4277
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
While others point the finger at Rock Band

4278
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
For their spamming of DLC

4279
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
Which separates friends who have more money

4280
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
To spend on games than others

4281
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
Who don't necessarily have as much disposable income

4282
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:18,000
I've been playing Guitar Hero since the third one

4283
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
And Rock Band since Rock Band 2

4284
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
And I've watched the community decline steadily

4285
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
And now it's a very small and tight-knit community

4286
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
That's all fine and dandy

4287
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
Because you get closer with a regular group of friends

4288
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
But now it's a sad state of affairs

4289
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
Because neither Guitar Hero nor Rock Band

4290
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
Have any games coming out

4291
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
I'm not counting Blitz because it's not a main series game

4292
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
I have an answer

4293
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
Stubbornness killed the music game franchise

4294
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:44,000
Konami's unwillingness to support the franchise killed it

4295
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
We went how many years without a DDR game

4296
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
In the arcades

4297
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
And one might say, oh well arcades were dying

4298
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
Or oh well it wasn't successful enough

4299
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
So they would have made another bull to the shit

4300
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
Because the problem with that logic

4301
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
Is that you're pretending

4302
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
That America didn't import

4303
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
All of those games

4304
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
Like did you know you're not supposed to have

4305
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
A Max 2 in America

4306
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
That was never released

4307
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
Max never released

4308
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
Extreme never released

4309
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
That's the problem

4310
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
Konami of Japan did not believe in the franchise

4311
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
And when they would make the games here

4312
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
Most of the time they were half-assed

4313
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
When they were coming from Konami of Japan

4314
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
There were two people

4315
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
Slash groups that believed

4316
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
In Dance Dance Revolution

4317
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
And the Bomani series in general at Konami

4318
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
One of them was Jason Enos

4319
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
Without him you would have never had

4320
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
These games in the first place

4321
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
And what we did get in America

4322
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
And on the Playstation releases and so forth

4323
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
The other was Konami of Hawaii

4324
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
Which unfortunately their first release on the Xbox

4325
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
Wasn't

4326
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
I get the sense maybe

4327
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
They didn't have as much freedom with that first game

4328
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
Because again the later Xbox games

4329
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
Ultramix 2 and Ultramix 3

4330
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
That's the shit that should have been in the arcades

4331
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
Those would have been great

4332
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
American DDR releases

4333
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
And we say this with our own

4334
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
Personal bias having been in the scene

4335
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
As long as we have been but

4336
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
Isn't VR pretty

4337
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
Wildly

4338
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
Popular in the arcades with the

4339
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
Ones that actually have X and X2

4340
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
I mean I'm not

4341
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Out of the scene I have not been playing the game anymore

4342
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
And if I'm gonna pick anything

4343
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
I'm gonna go back to basically Extreme and Below

4344
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
And a couple of gyms from afterwards

4345
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
But let's not kid ourselves

4346
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
Isn't DDR still doing pretty

4347
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
Damn good now that it actually has an American

4348
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Song list? Well enough

4349
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
I think although the home releases seem

4350
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
To have dried up I think actually

4351
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
Americanizing the song listed too much

4352
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
Is kind of because the whole point of DDR

4353
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
Was you take songs that are good

4354
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
But people might

4355
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
Take you to new music

4356
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
Now I think the whole licensing with all the synth pop

4357
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Stuff was pretty awesome

4358
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
But I loved a lot of Dance Mania stuff

4359
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
Because it's like okay I recognize that song is kind of

4360
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
A remix you know

4361
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
Oh this is kind of a neat take of this song

4362
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
Or this is a unique song I've never heard of from a Korean artist

4363
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
Or something like that or the song we played before

4364
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
The show I was like dude that'd be a perfect DDR

4365
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
Song nowadays

4366
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
I would definitely tend to agree

4367
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
That DDR

4368
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
Introducing me to Dance Mania is probably one of the best things

4369
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Like my last decade of music

4370
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
Just lastly real quick I'm sorry

4371
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
The last thing I want to say on this is that the other thing

4372
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
That really screwed them

4373
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
Guitar Hero was only a rampant success

4374
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
Because Konami was too stubborn to realize

4375
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
Those games would work here and they would have never paid

4376
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
For the licensing and the case

4377
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
I mean who made the first Guitar Hero

4378
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
Harmonics

4379
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
But who did they team up with to get that done

4380
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
Who planted the seed

4381
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
Great Red Octane

4382
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
What started Red Octane

4383
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
What kind of company was Red Octane

4384
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
DDR Pads and Guitar Freaks

4385
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
Third Party Guitar Freak Controllers

4386
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
And these mysterious Third Party Guitar Freaks Controllers

4387
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
With five buttons

4388
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
The Saga Red Octane for us is pretty sad

4389
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
My Guitar Freaks Controllers were in the background

4390
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
When we did the thing at my house

4391
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
With the news

4392
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
And what happened when Rock Revolution came out

4393
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
It was dismissed as a shitty ass Guitar Hero

4394
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
Clone and why

4395
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
The song list sucked butthole

4396
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
Because it was a bunch of bad covers

4397
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
And that was a very clear indication

4398
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
That Konami of Japan was not willing

4399
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
To put the investment or the risk

4400
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
And in order to get rewards

4401
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
You have to take a risk

4402
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
Konami of Japan was not willing to do that

4403
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
Therefore, Bimani died

4404
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
To finish reading the email

4405
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
Go ahead

4406
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
This will spiral out of control

4407
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
Because I have a few

4408
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
Agreements and disagreements

4409
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
Those of us who are still playing regularly

4410
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
New instruments

4411
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
Because all of ours keep breaking over time

4412
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
Due to where we weren't able to find them

4413
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
Anywhere short of eBay for less than $100

4414
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
For a damn guitar

4415
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
Dimple

4416
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
It's a used movie

4417
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
And game and records and stuff

4418
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
I find guitars there all the time on the cheap

4419
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
And usually in great condition

4420
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
And all of mine are still in perfect shape

4421
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
Because you have to clean them out

4422
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
And take good care of them

4423
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
But other than that

4424
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
Thanks for answering, sorry for ranting

4425
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
Listen live at work tonight

4426
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
Brownie, that's it

4427
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
The only thing I wanted to interject is that

4428
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
As far as I know, Rock Revolution

4429
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
Was a mostly

4430
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
Japanese

4431
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
Developed, you know, license

4432
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
Acquisition was responsible

4433
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
By the Japanese Konami

4434
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
Outfit

4435
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
The music culture in Japan is

4436
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
Ridiculously different from America

4437
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
And so for them to take that

4438
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
Something original

4439
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
Put it on us

4440
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
Put it on the common American base

4441
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
And be surprised at the failure

4442
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
To me

4443
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
From the limited amount of knowledge that I have

4444
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
It already makes sense that I could just say

4445
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
Well, you're not making an American game

4446
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
You're making a Japanese game and pushing it in America

4447
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
And something as cultural as music

4448
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
That's a pretty big deal

4449
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
Alright, anyway

4450
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
We could spend more time talking about this

4451
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
But we did already spend five years talking about it

4452
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
So, was that it for emails?

4453
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

4454
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
If you want to send us an email

4455
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
In the future

4456
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
I guess what's funny

4457
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
Because the live listeners are complaining that the stream went down

4458
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Which is weird because I don't see the time out

4459
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
That usually comes up when that happens

4460
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
But I guess maybe a little hiccup

4461
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
I guess what happened, I said

4462
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
Bamani died, and as soon as I said died

4463
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
Is when the stream went down

4464
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
It's almost like the watchful eye

4465
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Of Konami Japan just fucking pulled the plug

4466
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
On my internet when I said that

4467
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
How dare you

4468
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
But we know it's just because Comcast sucks

4469
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
After the mailbag comes the FUs of the week

4470
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
So let us get a little bit ranty

4471
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
We usually start the FUs with Dark Sakura

4472
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
But she ran out of the studio for a minute

4473
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
So I'll start with the other lady

4474
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
We'll let the other lady's first night

4475
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
Alright, do you have an FU of the week tonight?

4476
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
I don't think I do right now

4477
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
FU for being too nice

4478
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
I might think of something

4479
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
Alright, then how about Jason?

4480
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
The other half

4481
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
FU for getting a coat

4482
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
And anything else at home

4483
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
Because it was ridiculously cold in the bay last night

4484
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
It sucked to walk

4485
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
Fuck the bay

4486
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
Five degrees here and you're like

4487
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
I need a jacket

4488
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
And I think I had something else

4489
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
But, eh

4490
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
Uh, Loki

4491
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
Uh, FU being burnt out at work

4492
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
Uh, my FU of the week

4493
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
Goes to my abs

4494
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
And Extifer for showing me

4495
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
That little ab machine

4496
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
Extifer convinced me to join a gym

4497
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
There's a lot to be inspired about with Extifer

4498
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
Because Extifer used to be a big boy

4499
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
And he lost

4500
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
A lot of weight

4501
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
Through a pretty intense program at the gym

4502
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
Over the course of like a year

4503
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
So I just, I don't know

4504
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
I'm kind of at the point where I'm like, you know, I would like to lose a few pounds too

4505
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
Um, so

4506
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
I joined a gym

4507
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
And he showed me how to use the little ab machine

4508
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
And it really hurt the next day

4509
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
These things are evil aren't they

4510
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
Also, FU'd that

4511
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
It's not a Stairmaster

4512
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
But it's like this escalator that never ends

4513
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
That type of thing

4514
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
That thing's a little fucker

4515
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
Alright, and

4516
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
What gym are you going to?

4517
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
24 hour

4518
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
Oh, I'm so sorry

4519
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
I had a better experience there than the one you were recommending previously

4520
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
But that's alright

4521
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
Different strokes for different folks

4522
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
Well, um, my FU

4523
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
First of all, these tips are fucking delicious

4524
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
But hot, but peppery

4525
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
And, um

4526
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
The car accident, my lower back for hurting

4527
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
A bitch after my adjustment

4528
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
Um, and

4529
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
The rental car that I have

4530
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
I like that the stereo has the Bluetooth hookup

4531
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
For the phone

4532
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
But I miss my car and I don't like being

4533
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
Blown around like a leaf in the wind

4534
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
On the freeway because it's so lightweight

4535
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
I would rather

4536
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
Have had a Corolla S than a baseline

4537
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
Corolla, I feel like I'm driving a mommy car

4538
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
Oh yeah, one more

4539
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
FU'd a BurgerTime

4540
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
For reminding me of how bad I suck

4541
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
At classic arcade games

4542
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
And viewing angles

4543
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
Alright, Tigerclaw

4544
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
In our chatroom asks a very good question

4545
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
This is a very good question about the whole gym thing

4546
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
Tigerclaw says, Rob, when you went to the gym

4547
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
When you went into the gym, it wasn't intimidating

4548
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
And I have to admit, that's part of what held

4549
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
Me back for the longest time

4550
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
The whole

4551
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
Doing that in public type of thing

4552
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
People looking at each other in the gym

4553
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
I was a little weirded out

4554
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
By that whole thing at first, which is why

4555
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
For the longest time, I wouldn't go

4556
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
But finally, it just

4557
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
Kind of hit me, like this whole thing

4558
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
What am I going to see any of these

4559
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
Assholes outside the gym

4560
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
I'm not going to see these people anywhere else

4561
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
Whatever, I'm just going to go and be in my

4562
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
Own little world and listen to my headphones

4563
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
And if these people want to stare, then let them stare

4564
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
Because I'm hot

4565
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
And that's pretty much where I ended up with

4566
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
Also, it really helped that when I went to the gym for the first time

4567
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
I definitely saw people uglier than me

4568
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
And that helped a lot actually

4569
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
In a very superficial kind of way

4570
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
Right? Am I right, Jamie?

4571
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
It's a relief to go in the gym and see people uglier than you, right?

4572
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
Sometimes

4573
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
But the gym that I go to

4574
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
Actually has a lot of

4575
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
Track and ROT

4576
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
ROTC people there

4577
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
But they're doing the harder intensity stuff

4578
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
And I'm like, I'm just going to walk over here

4579
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
Thank you. I do the rowing machine now, though

4580
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
Tigerclaw says

4581
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
Or nervous, because you walk in there and you see

4582
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
A bunch of muscle-bound dudes working out

4583
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
And they see a weakling walking to the gym

4584
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
Hey!

4585
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
Why did you just call me?

4586
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
Um

4587
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
No, I don't

4588
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
But if the muscle-bound dudes are looking at me

4589
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
And they're judging me

4590
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
Then they're checking me out

4591
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
And that's their issue

4592
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
Sorry, I'm hot

4593
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
Well, you know what I would do

4594
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
Dan has a big thing for the circuit training

4595
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
They have this big circle thing where they do circuit training

4596
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
I go hang out in the dude section and lift weights

4597
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
Because

4598
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
I have a weak ankle

4599
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
And I can't really do much of that

4600
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
So I just go lift weights with the dudes

4601
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
And I get weird looks, but I don't care

4602
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
Fuck them!

4603
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
There just comes a point in your life where you just

4604
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
I'm really not interested in them, thank you

4605
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
There just comes a point in your life where you have to say

4606
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
Hi, haters! You know?

4607
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
And just deal with it

4608
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
Deal with me

4609
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
Monty Boggs says

4610
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
A new challenger approaches

4611
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
I don't want to talk it up too much

4612
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
Because I just started

4613
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
Literally last week

4614
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
And the last time I joined a gym

4615
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
I went once

4616
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
So I never went again

4617
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
But this time I'm hoping for better results

4618
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
So I'll be more excited about this

4619
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
If I'm still going in two months

4620
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
I'll let you know how it goes

4621
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
Hopefully my abs will stop hurting

4622
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
Because that machine is evil

4623
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
I already got a text message from Christopher today

4624
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
So, did you go?

4625
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
And I'm like, yes, I went on Saturday night

4626
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
Thank you very much

4627
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
I'm a real winner, I go to the gym

4628
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
On Saturday night, I didn't go to the club

4629
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
I went to the gym

4630
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
And then pizza on Sunday

4631
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
And then I ate so much pizza on Sunday

4632
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
But see, here's the thing, Jason

4633
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
I would have eaten that pizza anyway

4634
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
So

4635
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
Alright

4636
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
There's usually a good diet to go along

4637
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
With these kind of things, but eh

4638
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
Dark Tetsuya says instead of listening

4639
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
To USL, no, I listen

4640
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
I just said, the TuneIn app, I listen to the first

4641
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
Hour of USL from the gym

4642
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
I know that Dark Sakura talked about the

4643
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
Rocky rehearsal, and I know that Travis talked

4644
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
At length about the Mars landing

4645
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
And how happy he was about that whole thing

4646
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
And how he made the graphics during OLR

4647
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
Ha! Alright

4648
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
Anyhow

4649
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
Someone needs to take these chips away from me, they're freaking good

4650
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
Okay

4651
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
Yes

4652
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
Someone in chat was asking your chips

4653
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
What brand and such they were

4654
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
I told them, but it's Trader Joe's rice and bean

4655
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
Chips with adzuki beans

4656
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
And they're very peppery

4657
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
Alright, let's do it, it's already past 9 o'clock

4658
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
And we haven't even gotten to calls

4659
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
So let's do these last few stories pretty quickly here

4660
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
And I've got to do

4661
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
I've got to do Twitter topics as well here

4662
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
So, Loki

4663
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
So, more Zinga news

4664
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
Of course they're worried that people are

4665
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
Flocking away from the company

4666
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
They're going to try to retain some of those employees

4667
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
They're giving them free stock

4668
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
Free, worthless stock

4669
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
Fantastic

4670
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
There were some of those stories out there on one of those websites

4671
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
I can't remember the name, but some of the stories from actual employees

4672
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
And just about how the stock

4673
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
That they were given to work those long hours

4674
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
Is just plummeted

4675
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
It's actually kind of sad

4676
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
Because as much as I can't stand Zinga

4677
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
And the games they put out

4678
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
That's not a problem I have with

4679
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
The line level employees

4680
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
So to speak

4681
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
The people that are actually doing the art

4682
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
Or the programming

4683
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
It's the way that company is managed

4684
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
And the way they make some decisions

4685
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
I bet there's some very talented people at Zinga

4686
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
That would like to do something original

4687
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
I know there's some talented people there

4688
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
Some of my friends work there

4689
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
And they're very talented individuals and artists

4690
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
But I can't see their talent being utilized

4691
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
At all at this company

4692
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
Which is why I kind of feel bad

4693
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
Everyone talks about how evil they are

4694
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
Which is an evil company

4695
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
It's not necessarily

4696
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
It's not like those artists are evil

4697
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
Or the programmers are evil

4698
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
It's just that the decisions are evil

4699
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
So there you go

4700
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
Alright, is that it for that story?

4701
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
Wow that was quick

4702
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
I said quick and you said you did it

4703
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
Alright then lastly I'll do this one real quick

4704
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
This is an eBay, this was brought up earlier

4705
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
An eBay auction that has a lot of people turning their heads

4706
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
This is a guy who's basically selling his whole damn life

4707
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
On eBay for 3.5 million

4708
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
A 29 year old

4709
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
Who owns, which first off

4710
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
Props to him for establishing

4711
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
3.5 million dollars worth of stuff

4712
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
At age 29

4713
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
I'm older than 29

4714
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
And I'm not even worth a tenth of that

4715
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
I think I saw

4716
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
On a website the other day

4717
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com is valued at about

4718
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
$1500

4719
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
Yes

4720
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
This guy made 3.5

4721
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
Or asking 3.5 million

4722
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
I could ask $1000

4723
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
And I'd have to split that three ways

4724
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
Really four

4725
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
Because it's Jason's site

4726
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
And Deep Man designed it

4727
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
Five

4728
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
Anyhow

4729
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
All kidding aside

4730
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
This guy is selling on eBay

4731
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
$3.5 million dollars

4732
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
His entire

4733
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
Basically assets

4734
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
His automobiles, the collectibles and so forth

4735
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
He's the owner of R.U. Game

4736
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
Which is an independent retailer

4737
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
It's in Gainesville, Tampa

4738
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
And Brandon, Florida

4739
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
We have a couple listeners in Florida, I don't know if there's any in that area

4740
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
But he owns these few stores

4741
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
And I love the little

4742
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
Derpy Mario that's in the videos

4743
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
There's like this guy in a Derp Derp Mario costume

4744
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
Whatever, anyway

4745
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
He says he'll even hang around for six months to help the

4746
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
New owner, he didn't really say why

4747
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
He's doing it, it might have been in the video

4748
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
But I wasn't going to watch the whole thing

4749
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
It's because he wants to just start his next thing

4750
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
Or whatever that is

4751
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
So it's like I want to start my life over

4752
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
We are starting over

4753
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
Maybe he's Buddhist

4754
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
Maybe, who knows

4755
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
But anyway, he's selling the whole thing off

4756
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
No words yet if there are any serious bidders or whatever

4757
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
But you know what, I say hats off to this guy

4758
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
Because a lot of people think it's fake

4759
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
And it's just for publicity

4760
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
And in which case I say, hats off to you dude

4761
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
Because you got covered on every game

4762
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
Blog this week with this little story

4763
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
And you know this industry

4764
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
They need to run something every day

4765
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
On the websites

4766
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
So this was like the best commercial you could ever

4767
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
Not buy

4768
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
I tip my hat to you

4769
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
Doesn't RU Games

4770
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
Sound like it might be like a place to buy

4771
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
Russian import games though

4772
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
Like when I first saw the name I kind of thought

4773
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
Oh, RU Games, it's like a Russian game store

4774
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
I thought that that's

4775
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
I didn't think of a stupid Facebook game

4776
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
It's an industry that works with these types of stores

4777
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
You would not believe how many

4778
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
Generic sounding game stores are out there

4779
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
It's like, yeah

4780
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
I'd like to make my game store

4781
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
It's called

4782
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
Well, I'm trying to remember

4783
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
It's like

4784
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
It's something like GameStop

4785
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
But it wasn't GameStop, it was very close

4786
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
Game yield

4787
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
Game go, go game

4788
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
No, it was like

4789
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
Go GameStop

4790
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
Something like that

4791
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
Why are you naming?

4792
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
Go GameStop, that's kind of

4793
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
Video game center

4794
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,000
Game store

4795
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
The game place

4796
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
I named the game store the Danone, did you know that?

4797
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
Oh really? Game on

4798
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
That ended up being a show, right?

4799
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
Well this was years ago

4800
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
Game shop

4801
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
I've seen that

4802
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
There's game trader that uses the same

4803
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
Text and colors

4804
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
Monty Boggs in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

4805
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
Answered the question

4806
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
Yes, I am game, are you movie?

4807
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,000
Laughs

4808
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
I'm sorry

4809
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,000
I found that response to be hilarious

4810
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
Like I just want to walk

4811
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000
Into the store, why yes I am game

4812
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
Are you movie? Well here's the thing too

4813
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000
He's even admitted, even if it doesn't sell

4814
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000
Or he doesn't get a

4815
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,000
Buyer for it, it's great advertising for my

4816
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,000
Store, because he got all these

4817
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:36,000
Blogs talking about this store

4818
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,000
So he could

4819
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,000
Props to you and your derpy ass Mario

4820
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
Mascot guy

4821
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,000
Laughs

4822
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:48,000
You know Nintendo might see that

4823
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:50,000
And get a little upset

4824
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:52,000
Just saying

4825
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
I'll see derpy Mario fight

4826
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,000
Mario Mascot

4827
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:58,000
Laughs

4828
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:00,000
Maybe in the next Smash Brothers

4829
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:02,000
Dr. Mario vs.

4830
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,000
Derpy Mario

4831
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,000
Laughs

4832
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
Laughs

4833
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
Laughs

4834
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
Oh my god mushrooms, oh my god

4835
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:14,000
Mr. Derpy Mario

4836
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,000
Oh my god mushrooms

4837
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:18,000
If that doesn't just epitomize this episode

4838
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:20,000
Oh my god first floor

4839
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:22,000
Oh my god Zelda chic

4840
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:24,000
Laughs

4841
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
Sigh

4842
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,000
Orange lounge derpio according to the chatroom

4843
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,000
Thank you, thank you guys

4844
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,000
Alright let's go to the skype

4845
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:34,000
Line, we're gonna open it up now

4846
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:36,000
1877 game olr

4847
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:38,000
Or our username on skype is orange

4848
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:40,000
Lounge radio, we can't wait to take your

4849
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,000
Call, in the mean time

4850
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,000
We'll do some last minute stories

4851
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:46,000
I'll do a couple of these quick tweets here

4852
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:48,000
Let's see

4853
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
Gamer girl was responding a little late to the

4854
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,000
Facebook question on Twitter

4855
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
I think she's being ironic

4856
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,000
First game that ever shocked me was God

4857
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,000
of War when you go into the ships cabin

4858
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:00,000
And you get to do the girls for more orbs

4859
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:02,000
Oh yes

4860
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,000
Sex and in my

4861
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:06,000
God of War

4862
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:08,000
Shocking, but in a good way

4863
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:10,000
Ooh I can't believe

4864
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:12,000
That just happened

4865
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:14,000
Oh we have a phone call, hi you're on orange lounge radio

4866
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:16,000
Who's this

4867
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:18,000
Hey how you doing

4868
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:20,000
Oh hey

4869
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:22,000
Sup

4870
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:24,000
Not much, sup

4871
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,000
Just chilling, enjoying

4872
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:28,000
Good stuff

4873
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:30,000
Interesting little story

4874
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:32,000
I'm chilling, I'm watching My Little Pony

4875
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,000
Just kicking back

4876
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:36,000
That's what's up, that's how I roll

4877
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
Alright what's up

4878
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:40,000
I have a funny little story to have a nice interesting

4879
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:42,000
Story about Microsoft and I'll be on my merry little way

4880
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:44,000
Okay

4881
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,000
First story is, oddly enough

4882
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:48,000
If it wasn't for Raichan, I wouldn't be a fan of the show

4883
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,000
And I wouldn't be pestering you guys for all these years

4884
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:52,000
Now, oh

4885
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:54,000
So you are a fan of olr

4886
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:56,000
Thanks to Raichan

4887
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:58,000
Me and Raichan, we go back like

4888
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:00,000
Ten plus years, hanging out on

4889
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:02,000
On a forum site, wbs.net

4890
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:04,000
Can you hold on a minute

4891
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:06,000
Can you hold on a minute

4892
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:08,000
Yeah, yeah

4893
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:10,000
God damn you

4894
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:12,000
You ruined everything

4895
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:22,000
Oh shit, was I not on mute

4896
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:24,000
Hey Rob

4897
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:26,000
Can you scream a little louder

4898
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:28,000
I don't think the dead heard you

4899
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:30,000
You know what's funny, apparently right when I screamed

4900
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:32,000
The internet went out again

4901
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:34,000
Which isn't, you're still on Skype

4902
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:36,000
So I don't think that's possible, whatever

4903
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:38,000
Alright, so anyway

4904
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:40,000
That'll be one for the pod

4905
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:42,000
And the podcast listeners

4906
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:44,000
Supposedly don't get any love

4907
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:46,000
Anyway

4908
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:48,000
Sorry, where were we

4909
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:50,000
I was explaining how I became a fan of the show

4910
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,000
Yes, please

4911
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:54,000
I mean, I'm just chatting online one day

4912
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,000
And she just IMs me on ICQ

4913
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:58,000
She's like, are you to like, be mining DDR

4914
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:00,000
I was like, what here

4915
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:02,000
And she's like, check this out

4916
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:04,000
What was your number on ICQ

4917
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:06,000
You just aged everything ten years

4918
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:08,000
When you brought up ICQ

4919
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,000
Well, we're already on a ten year delay

4920
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:12,000
I'm still logged on to it right now

4921
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:14,000
My number is

4922
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:16,000
10719559

4923
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:20,000
Uh oh

4924
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:22,000
Uh oh

4925
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:24,000
That was my old boss's message tone

4926
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:26,000
Uh oh

4927
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:28,000
Well it was everybody's on ICQ

4928
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:30,000
No, no, I mean on her phone

4929
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:32,000
Uh oh, ew

4930
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:34,000
Okay, so she messaged you on ICQ

4931
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:36,000
And your computer went, uh oh

4932
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:38,000
Yeah, pretty much

4933
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:40,000
And then everybody in OLR went

4934
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:42,000
Wait, was that right

4935
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:44,000
And then everybody in OLR

4936
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:46,000
went, uh oh

4937
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:52,000
Ah, that was great

4938
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:54,000
Oh wait, here we go, here we go, here we go

4939
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:56,000
This is great

4940
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:58,000
Uh oh

4941
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:02,000
Oh, that's the sound I make every time

4942
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:04,000
Oh look, the phone's lighting up

4943
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:06,000
And it's Ranma

4944
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:08,000
I wonder if there's somebody out there

4945
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:10,000
That has their ringtone or text message

4946
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:12,000
For their phone

4947
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:14,000
How about the ICQ sound remix

4948
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:16,000
That apparently exists out there

4949
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:20,000
Oh god

4950
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:22,000
Uh, OT pain

4951
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:24,000
Is this dubstep?

4952
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
Not yet, not enough screeching

4953
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:28,000
Okay, anyway

4954
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:30,000
Hi Ranma, what's new?

4955
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:32,000
That's a notorious SKIE, huh

4956
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:34,000
I'm sorry?

4957
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:36,000
That's a notorious SKIE, huh

4958
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:38,000
Yes, oh

4959
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:40,000
Blackwool says the ICQ song needs to go into rotation

4960
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:42,000
Take a vote on it right now

4961
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:44,000
That's right, looks like

4962
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:46,000
Dark Tetsuya voted for it too

4963
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:48,000
So I think that passes

4964
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:50,000
We're gonna get that in the vlog stream

4965
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:52,000
ICQ remix coming soon

4966
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:54,000
Alright, Ranma, anything else

4967
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:56,000
you wanted to share with us

4968
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:58,000
I think I overran my time

4969
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:00,000
So I'm gonna get a bun out of here

4970
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:02,000
Love you, mean it

4971
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:04,000
Sure you do, you mean it for every bullet so far

4972
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:06,000
Love you too

4973
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:08,000
I'm out

4974
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:10,000
Bye

4975
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:12,000
It is strange how

4976
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:14,000
well some people's voices lend them to

4977
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:16,000
recreate sounds like that

4978
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:18,000
People, I don't know if I've ever

4979
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:20,000
really been pitchy on the show

4980
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:22,000
1-877-GAMO-LR, or username on Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio

4981
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:24,000
I don't know if I've ever really been pitchy on the show

4982
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:26,000
I know I've laughed pretty high pitched a couple times

4983
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:28,000
tonight, but I would never have expected you to be able

4984
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:30,000
to recreate that tone, ever

4985
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:32,000
There's a lot of things I can do

4986
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:34,000
you can't even possibly imagine

4987
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:36,000
Episode 469

4988
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:38,000
Live

4989
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:40,000
I do the Muppets too

4990
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:42,000
Their voices, their voices

4991
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:48,000
Near

4992
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:50,000
Far

4993
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:52,000
Near

4994
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:54,000
Far

4995
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:00,000
Oh god

4996
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:02,000
Kermit the Frog

4997
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:04,000
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here

4998
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:10,000
Do I really want to go into an inside joke like that?

4999
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:12,000
Probably not

5000
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:18,000
Live radio

5001
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:20,000
It's moments

5002
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:22,000
like these where I can only

5003
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:34,000
think of this

5004
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:36,000
Call

5005
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:38,000
Hold on

5006
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:40,000
We got a call coming in? Here we go

5007
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:50,000
Oh hi, who's this?

5008
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:52,000
Hello

5009
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:54,000
Hello

5010
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:56,000
Manomina

5011
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:58,000
No, that's terrible

5012
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:00,000
Who is this?

5013
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:02,000
It's Shane

5014
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:04,000
Hey Shane, what's up?

5015
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:06,000
Nothing, I just realized that

5016
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:08,000
I can't really plug courthouse this week

5017
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:10,000
because I won't be on it

5018
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:12,000
So did you call into my other radio show

5019
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:14,000
just to tell me that?

5020
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:16,000
Yes

5021
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:18,000
I already figured that out actually earlier

5022
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:20,000
I didn't

5023
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:22,000
So I thought you should be the first to know

5024
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:24,000
Well thank you for that important announcement

5025
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:26,000
Hey guess what y'all, Shane will not be on

5026
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:28,000
Hoard House this week, in other news

5027
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:30,000
this is the week to listen to Hoard House

5028
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:32,000
Wow

5029
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:34,000
Just kidding, I'm kidding

5030
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:36,000
Who's gonna do the Facebook

5031
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:38,000
Who's gonna do the Facebook question of the week now?

5032
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:40,000
I don't know

5033
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:42,000
but it won't be me

5034
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:44,000
What, you have no Google Plus listeners at Hoard House?

5035
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:46,000
I don't even think Hoard House

5036
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:48,000
Is that one person not listening?

5037
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:50,000
I don't even think Hoard House has a Google Plus account

5038
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:52,000
sadly

5039
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:54,000
Is that all you called in to talk about?

5040
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:56,000
What?

5041
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:58,000
Is that all you called in to talk about?

5042
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:00,000
No, I called in to say everybody needs to also

5043
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:02,000
purchase Guild Wars 2

5044
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:04,000
because it's fantastic

5045
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:06,000
Ah yes, you've been playing in the beta

5046
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:08,000
What's so great about Guild Wars 2?

5047
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:10,000
It's pretty

5048
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:12,000
and the combat's fun

5049
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:14,000
and it's also free to play once you buy it

5050
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:16,000
It's pretty fun

5051
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:18,000
Did you say it's free to play once you buy it?

5052
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:20,000
Yeah, like there's no monthly fee

5053
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:22,000
No subscription, yeah I got that

5054
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:24,000
So it's similar

5055
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:26,000
It's similarly different to World of Warcraft

5056
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:28,000
You stole my word

5057
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:32,000
Alright

5058
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:34,000
You're full of hate tonight

5059
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:36,000
It's a problem

5060
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:38,000
Ah, that's great

5061
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:40,000
I learned from you Shane

5062
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:42,000
I learned from you and since you're not gonna be on

5063
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:44,000
Hoard House this week I had to make up for it

5064
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:46,000
Clearly

5065
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:48,000
I'm

5066
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:50,000
What am I not full of hate? Alright

5067
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:52,000
I don't know

5068
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:54,000
You're extra hateful tonight

5069
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:56,000
So are you allowed to talk about where you're at

5070
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:58,000
right now or should I not talk about that on air?

5071
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:00,000
Why is it confidential?

5072
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:02,000
I don't know

5073
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:06,000
I don't know either, I'm asking you why is it

5074
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:08,000
confidential? Because

5075
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:10,000
of the nature of your work now, I don't know

5076
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:12,000
No

5077
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:14,000
I'm up in Redman, Washington

5078
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:16,000
training at Nintendo

5079
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:18,000
Are you having fun?

5080
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:20,000
Yes, it's very pretty here

5081
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:22,000
Like everybody should just look to Redman

5082
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:24,000
because that's what I want to do now

5083
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:26,000
The Pacific Northwest is really beautiful, I haven't been to Redman specifically

5084
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:28,000
but I love Seattle, Seattle's great

5085
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:30,000
Should go back for PAX

5086
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:32,000
That's next week so I can't

5087
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:34,000
Is that really next week?

5088
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:36,000
Isn't it?

5089
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:38,000
PAX is over Labor Day weekend again, it's the same time as

5090
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:40,000
Dragon Con

5091
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:42,000
I thought it was the end of August

5092
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:44,000
Which would be next week

5093
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:46,000
That's like three weeks

5094
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:48,000
Oh, I don't know

5095
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:50,000
I can't go

5096
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:52,000
That's too much money, but I would love to now

5097
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:54,000
I always want to go to PAX if it's up here

5098
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:56,000
August 31 through September 2nd

5099
03:01:56,000 --> 03:01:58,000
That's what, three weeks away?

5100
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:00,000
That's the same time as Dragon Con

5101
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:02,000
Well, Redman

5102
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:04,000
is like a little village inside a forest

5103
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:06,000
It's beautiful

5104
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:08,000
It's like a little village inside a forest

5105
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:10,000
How far are you from Seattle?

5106
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:12,000
Like 30 minutes

5107
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:14,000
Oh, that's further than I would have thought

5108
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:16,000
Well, that's how long the cab ride took

5109
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:18,000
The $81 cab ride

5110
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:20,000
Holy moly

5111
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:22,000
That's a ways away

5112
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:24,000
I didn't pay for it, so I don't care

5113
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:26,000
Alright, well I want to hear all the dirt

5114
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:28,000
even if you can't talk about it on OLR

5115
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:30,000
I want to hear all the dirt about your first trip to Nintendo headquarters tomorrow

5116
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:32,000
That's fine, I will do that

5117
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:36,000
And let us know if you bump into Reggie or anybody really exciting

5118
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:38,000
How is Reggie exciting?

5119
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:40,000
I don't know

5120
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:42,000
Be sure to ask him if his body is ready

5121
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:44,000
I'm sure he hasn't heard that enough

5122
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:46,000
Oh god, that really was the highlight of E3

5123
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:48,000
He did say Reggie

5124
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:50,000
I don't even remember that

5125
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:52,000
He did say Reggie OR somebody exciting

5126
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:54,000
So, okay, if I meet Mario tomorrow

5127
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:56,000
Like actual Mario, not Charles Martinette

5128
03:02:56,000 --> 03:02:58,000
I'll let you know

5129
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:00,000
Or Derpy Mario

5130
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:02,000
I don't know if you've been listening to the show

5131
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:04,000
But the Derpy Mario from Florida might show up

5132
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:06,000
I don't know

5133
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:08,000
You know what, in fact

5134
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:10,000
I think you need to report Derpy Mario actually

5135
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:12,000
I'm going to help you out

5136
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:14,000
You need to put that in a feedback box somewhere

5137
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:16,000
If there's a suggestion box on the wall

5138
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:18,000
Please arrest Derpy Mario in Tampa, Florida

5139
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:20,000
Well, I would need some sort of like

5140
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:22,000
Like proof of Derpy Mario

5141
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:24,000
The picture is on Kotaku

5142
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:26,000
The picture is on Kotaku

5143
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:28,000
The picture is on Kotaku

5144
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:30,000
The picture is on Kotaku

5145
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:32,000
It's on, alright, I'll email you

5146
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:34,000
I'll email you the link

5147
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:36,000
Alright, I gotta let you go to get some more calls

5148
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:38,000
Anything else?

5149
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:40,000
No, my whole

5150
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:42,000
Studio

5151
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:44,000
Hotel room is powered by a key card

5152
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:46,000
That I have to plug into the wall

5153
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:48,000
And if I take it away it turns everything off

5154
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:50,000
It's weird

5155
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:52,000
Those hotels are actually really nice

5156
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:54,000
Yeah, it's $300 a night apparently

5157
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:56,000
Wow

5158
03:03:56,000 --> 03:03:58,000
It's like

5159
03:03:58,000 --> 03:04:00,000
Guy from middle of nowhere, Kansas

5160
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:02,000
Ends up in the big city or the village in the forest

5161
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:04,000
Where you have to plug things into walls

5162
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:06,000
In order to get power

5163
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:08,000
It's weird, you have to make power

5164
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:10,000
Like a freaking water

5165
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:12,000
What are those called?

5166
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:14,000
Those water wheel things?

5167
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:16,000
Hydroelectric power?

5168
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:18,000
Sure, there we go

5169
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:20,000
Alright, I will talk to you later Shane

5170
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:22,000
Take care

5171
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:24,000
Bye

5172
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:26,000
Let's try to fit in at least one more call

5173
03:04:26,000 --> 03:04:28,000
For the night before we say goodnight

5174
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:30,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?

5175
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:32,000
Hey guys, it's Porkchop

5176
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:34,000
Hey Porkchop, how you doing?

5177
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:36,000
Not bad, just on all you guys who are all

5178
03:04:36,000 --> 03:04:38,000
Knowing, I heard you talk about the move

5179
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:40,000
And I'm just wondering, I'm thinking of buying it

5180
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:42,000
But what exactly can I do with it?

5181
03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:44,000
I mean I have a couple of games I can use it with

5182
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:46,000
But is there anything else that I could really do with it

5183
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:48,000
That's worthwhile

5184
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:50,000
I'm sorry, but all I have to say is

5185
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:52,000
And I know this is a radio show

5186
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:54,000
Your Skype picture is cracking me

5187
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:56,000
The hell up

5188
03:04:56,000 --> 03:04:58,000
I'm glad, I didn't think you could see it before

5189
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:00,000
But I'm glad you can see it now

5190
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:02,000
Yes, we can all see it here in studio

5191
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:04,000
And it's cracking me up

5192
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:06,000
Because to describe it for listeners at home

5193
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:08,000
He's literally wearing a tinfoil hat

5194
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:10,000
That makes him look like

5195
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:12,000
It's a tinfoil helmet

5196
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:14,000
He looks like a superhero or something

5197
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:16,000
But he looks like

5198
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:18,000
Sir Tin of Foil

5199
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:20,000
It's a very phallic, foily head

5200
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:22,000
That he's got there

5201
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:24,000
Sir Reynolds of Rap

5202
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:26,000
He's like a metallic luchador

5203
03:05:26,000 --> 03:05:28,000
Thank you

5204
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:30,000
He's a metallic luchador

5205
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:32,000
But the expression on his face is like

5206
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:34,000
Hey

5207
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:36,000
He's like the happy luchador

5208
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:38,000
Hey

5209
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:40,000
I'ma body slam you now

5210
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:42,000
Anyhow

5211
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:44,000
Episode 469

5212
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:46,000
Thank you

5213
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:48,000
You should get the PlayStation Move

5214
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:50,000
To play it in that helmet

5215
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:52,000
And upload those videos to SingStar

5216
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:54,000
You would be the number one ranked player in the world

5217
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:56,000
I would do that just for you

5218
03:05:56,000 --> 03:05:58,000
Seeing as you ask so nicely

5219
03:05:58,000 --> 03:06:00,000
I would do that if I can get SingStar

5220
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:02,000
No problem

5221
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:04,000
And please make sure it's SingStar, Abba

5222
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:06,000
Loki, you have some suggestions

5223
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:08,000
What could he do with the move?

5224
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:10,000
Well, there's

5225
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:12,000
All their first person shooter games support the move

5226
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:14,000
And they have also their gun thing

5227
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:16,000
I don't remember what it's called

5228
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:18,000
Well, Sports Champions

5229
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:20,000
Is pretty fun with the move

5230
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:22,000
Also, apparently

5231
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:24,000
Child of Eden is really good

5232
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:26,000
With the move

5233
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:28,000
They've got some move exclusive games

5234
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:30,000
But they're kind of just so-so

5235
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:32,000
I don't know

5236
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:34,000
Let me put it this way

5237
03:06:34,000 --> 03:06:36,000
A lot of that move stuff is probably

5238
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:38,000
Really discounted right now

5239
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:40,000
So you could probably take a pretty good

5240
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:42,000
Look through a dump bin

5241
03:06:42,000 --> 03:06:44,000
Somewhere or a discount bin

5242
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:46,000
In one of these stores and find a bunch of that move stuff

5243
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:48,000
But yeah, I'd say

5244
03:06:48,000 --> 03:06:50,000
Probably Sports Champions is really good

5245
03:06:50,000 --> 03:06:52,000
Although, if you want to wait, Sports Champions

5246
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:54,000
2 is coming out

5247
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:56,000
I don't know if it has some of the

5248
03:06:56,000 --> 03:06:58,000
I think it has some of the same events in there

5249
03:06:58,000 --> 03:07:00,000
But I mean, it's got frisbee golf

5250
03:07:00,000 --> 03:07:02,000
That's kind of fun, I played the archery

5251
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:04,000
Archery is really cool

5252
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:06,000
How is LittleBigPlanet's move implementation?

5253
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:08,000
It's supposed to be pretty good

5254
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:10,000
They've got a lot of new stuff with that

5255
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:12,000
LittleBigPlanet 2 would be a good one

5256
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:14,000
If you like Heavy Rain

5257
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:16,000
I don't know how good that would be

5258
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:18,000
Yeah, I got that

5259
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:20,000
You can use it as a mouse

5260
03:07:20,000 --> 03:07:24,000
Yeah, that's hacking stuff

5261
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:26,000
Actually, yeah

5262
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:28,000
A lot of the games are pretty accurate

5263
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:30,000
It works pretty well with whatever

5264
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:32,000
It's just whatever type of games you like

5265
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:34,000
I know they tried some of the party stuff

5266
03:07:34,000 --> 03:07:36,000
In the very beginning and that was kind of crap

5267
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:38,000
But stick with the sports games

5268
03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:40,000
If you like the dancing games

5269
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:42,000
I'm sure it works well with it

5270
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:48,000
You could basically pretend you're playing Wii games

5271
03:07:48,000 --> 03:07:50,000
That work

5272
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:52,000
Yeah

5273
03:07:52,000 --> 03:07:54,000
Well, I got Heavy Rain and Resident Evil 5

5274
03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:56,000
So I think that should pretty much

5275
03:07:56,000 --> 03:07:58,000
Keep me going until I can pick up some other ones

5276
03:07:58,000 --> 03:08:00,000
That sounds pretty good

5277
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:02,000
Sounds like a lot of stuff you're going to find in the clearance bin

5278
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:04,000
Pretty soon, unfortunately

5279
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:06,000
But hey, however you can find the deal, right?

5280
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:08,000
I picked them up cheap anyway

5281
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:10,000
King Star Abba, that's on my list

5282
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:12,000
Alright, as it should be on everybody's list

5283
03:08:12,000 --> 03:08:14,000
It's fun

5284
03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:16,000
Alright, Porkchop, before I let you go so we can close up the show

5285
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:18,000
Anything else on your mind tonight?

5286
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:20,000
Yes, Konami, if you fuck up

5287
03:08:20,000 --> 03:08:22,000
Zone of the Enders HD collection

5288
03:08:22,000 --> 03:08:24,000
I will fucking kill you

5289
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:26,000
In that helmet

5290
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:28,000
Yeah, he will wear that helmet

5291
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:30,000
Professor Chaos!

5292
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:32,000
That's it

5293
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:36,000
You need a battle axe made out of tinfoil

5294
03:08:36,000 --> 03:08:38,000
I just need a special move now

5295
03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:40,000
Wait, I have to say it

5296
03:08:40,000 --> 03:08:42,000
Because over here it's aluminum

5297
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:44,000
There's an aluminium

5298
03:08:44,000 --> 03:08:46,000
Really?

5299
03:08:46,000 --> 03:08:48,000
We just said tinfoil

5300
03:08:48,000 --> 03:08:50,000
Why make it so damn complicated?

5301
03:08:50,000 --> 03:08:52,000
We're that lazy, we don't give a shit

5302
03:08:52,000 --> 03:08:54,000
Cover your food with it, that's it

5303
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:56,000
Tinfoil

5304
03:08:56,000 --> 03:08:58,000
Make hats, make axes, whatever

5305
03:08:58,000 --> 03:09:00,000
I love it

5306
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:02,000
Alright, Porkchop, I got to let you go to Close Up Shop

5307
03:09:02,000 --> 03:09:04,000
Have a good one, buddy

5308
03:09:04,000 --> 03:09:06,000
Have a good one, Rusty guys

5309
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:08,000
Will do, bye

5310
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:10,000
I love the listeners

5311
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:12,000
187, oh wait no, I'm closing up Sky

5312
03:09:12,000 --> 03:09:14,000
I'm sorry if you didn't get through

5313
03:09:14,000 --> 03:09:16,000
But it's like 9.30 already

5314
03:09:16,000 --> 03:09:18,000
And I want a milkshake

5315
03:09:18,000 --> 03:09:20,000
We need to wrap up here and get out of here

5316
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:22,000
What? Milkshake

5317
03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:24,000
Does it bring all the boys to the yard?

5318
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:26,000
I don't care, it brings fat to my butt

5319
03:09:26,000 --> 03:09:28,000
It's the Dark Sakura version

5320
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:30,000
Wait, hold on, hold on

5321
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:32,000
No

5322
03:09:32,000 --> 03:09:34,000
You asked for it, you asked for it

5323
03:09:34,000 --> 03:09:36,000
No

5324
03:09:36,000 --> 03:09:38,000
God, you're awful

5325
03:09:40,000 --> 03:09:42,000
No

5326
03:09:42,000 --> 03:09:44,000
La la la la la

5327
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:46,000
Ha ha

5328
03:09:46,000 --> 03:09:48,000
Ha ha ha

5329
03:09:48,000 --> 03:09:50,000
Thank you for YouTube ads

5330
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:52,000
Alright, here we go

5331
03:09:52,000 --> 03:09:54,000
Unmute me

5332
03:09:54,000 --> 03:09:56,000
My milkshake brings all my fat to the butt

5333
03:09:58,000 --> 03:10:00,000
And I'm like

5334
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:02,000
Damn right, it's fat on my butt

5335
03:10:10,000 --> 03:10:12,000
They all want me

5336
03:10:12,000 --> 03:10:14,000
When I walk into the gym

5337
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:16,000
Like this

5338
03:10:18,000 --> 03:10:20,000
Damn right I went to Pinkberry

5339
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:24,000
And I was like

5340
03:10:24,000 --> 03:10:26,000
Yo, supersize

5341
03:10:26,000 --> 03:10:30,000
You can't have mine

5342
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:34,000
And there's your singing

5343
03:10:34,000 --> 03:10:36,000
For episode 469

5344
03:10:38,000 --> 03:10:40,000
Is there a meme

5345
03:10:40,000 --> 03:10:42,000
We haven't covered?

5346
03:10:46,000 --> 03:10:48,000
Okay

5347
03:10:50,000 --> 03:10:52,000
Oh, I think I need to do um

5348
03:10:52,000 --> 03:10:54,000
I need to do Twitter topics

5349
03:10:54,000 --> 03:10:56,000
Are you

5350
03:10:56,000 --> 03:10:58,000
feeling a little emotional, Rob?

5351
03:10:58,000 --> 03:11:00,000
I'm so emotional

5352
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:02,000
baby

5353
03:11:02,000 --> 03:11:04,000
You had to bring

5354
03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:06,000
Whitney into this, can't you let that poor

5355
03:11:06,000 --> 03:11:08,000
woman rest in peace? Never

5356
03:11:08,000 --> 03:11:10,000
Damn

5357
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:12,000
She's still got a movie coming out, alright?

5358
03:11:12,000 --> 03:11:14,000
She's dead and got a movie coming out

5359
03:11:14,000 --> 03:11:16,000
It's amazing what they can do with technology

5360
03:11:16,000 --> 03:11:18,000
Alright, look, tweets

5361
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:20,000
First off, Tigerclaw

5362
03:11:20,000 --> 03:11:22,000
They actually tried that with Bruce Lee

5363
03:11:22,000 --> 03:11:24,000
and Tupac

5364
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:26,000
Alright, uh

5365
03:11:26,000 --> 03:11:28,000
Great, Travis

5366
03:11:28,000 --> 03:11:30,000
is inviting me on Understation live next week

5367
03:11:30,000 --> 03:11:32,000
and do white boys sing along

5368
03:11:34,000 --> 03:11:36,000
Why not, sure

5369
03:11:36,000 --> 03:11:38,000
Alright, Tigerclaw

5370
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:40,000
tweets us

5371
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:42,000
and you'll be interested in this, a fan-made

5372
03:11:42,000 --> 03:11:44,000
Mass Effect adventure game that surfaces

5373
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:46,000
Is that that Mass Effect universe?

5374
03:11:46,000 --> 03:11:48,000
It's called Finding Shepherd

5375
03:11:48,000 --> 03:11:50,000
and it's on the Adventure Game Studios

5376
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:52,000
It's created by one of the users on the forums

5377
03:11:52,000 --> 03:11:54,000
Nightfable. Finding Shepherd, it's in

5378
03:11:54,000 --> 03:11:56,000
progress right now, but it's set in the Mass Effect

5379
03:11:56,000 --> 03:11:58,000
universe directly following Mass Effect

5380
03:11:58,000 --> 03:12:00,000
3. It assumes that you took

5381
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:02,000
the destroy ending, that's all we're

5382
03:12:02,000 --> 03:12:04,000
going to say about that, but what's cool about

5383
03:12:04,000 --> 03:12:06,000
this game, if you kind of look at some of the early screenshots

5384
03:12:06,000 --> 03:12:08,000
it looks like a LucasArts game or something

5385
03:12:08,000 --> 03:12:10,000
That's kind of rad

5386
03:12:10,000 --> 03:12:12,000
Do you press S for Shepherd?

5387
03:12:12,000 --> 03:12:14,000
Shepherd? Shepherd?

5388
03:12:14,000 --> 03:12:16,000
Shepherd? Shepherd?

5389
03:12:16,000 --> 03:12:18,000
You seem to have Mass Effect

5390
03:12:18,000 --> 03:12:20,000
confused with heavy rain

5391
03:12:20,000 --> 03:12:22,000
Alright

5392
03:12:22,000 --> 03:12:24,000
Uh, let's see

5393
03:12:24,000 --> 03:12:26,000
Tigerclaw

5394
03:12:26,000 --> 03:12:28,000
also sends us one more tweet about how

5395
03:12:28,000 --> 03:12:30,000
GameStop is one of the worst places to

5396
03:12:30,000 --> 03:12:32,000
work in America

5397
03:12:32,000 --> 03:12:34,000
It's just number 10

5398
03:12:34,000 --> 03:12:36,000
Is it really? It's only number 10? Yeah, it's number 10

5399
03:12:36,000 --> 03:12:38,000
Uh, actually I had pulled this up

5400
03:12:38,000 --> 03:12:40,000
Number 1 is Dish Network

5401
03:12:40,000 --> 03:12:42,000
Number 2 is Dillard's

5402
03:12:42,000 --> 03:12:44,000
Number 3 is Radio Shack

5403
03:12:44,000 --> 03:12:46,000
Number 4 is Perch

5404
03:12:46,000 --> 03:12:48,000
Number 6 is Sears slash Kmart

5405
03:12:48,000 --> 03:12:50,000
Number 7 is

5406
03:12:50,000 --> 03:12:52,000
Robert Halfer International, which I have no idea who they are

5407
03:12:52,000 --> 03:12:54,000
Kmart is tough to work for because you have to work

5408
03:12:54,000 --> 03:12:56,000
with mummies Number 8 is Hewlett-Packard

5409
03:12:56,000 --> 03:12:58,000
Number 9 is Rite Aid

5410
03:12:58,000 --> 03:13:00,000
and number 10 is GameStop

5411
03:13:00,000 --> 03:13:02,000
followed by Bank of New York Mellon

5412
03:13:02,000 --> 03:13:04,000
Sears

5413
03:13:04,000 --> 03:13:06,000
slash Kmart? Was that a tie?

5414
03:13:06,000 --> 03:13:08,000
Or are they the same company?

5415
03:13:08,000 --> 03:13:10,000
They're the same company Kmart and Sears

5416
03:13:10,000 --> 03:13:12,000
had a merger with Holdings

5417
03:13:12,000 --> 03:13:14,000
Oh, imagine that

5418
03:13:14,000 --> 03:13:16,000
Babymon, who wants to plug his best friend

5419
03:13:16,000 --> 03:13:18,000
made some Papercraft Legend

5420
03:13:18,000 --> 03:13:20,000
of Zelda, which is available as posters

5421
03:13:20,000 --> 03:13:22,000
on Etsy

5422
03:13:22,000 --> 03:13:24,000
I got to admit, some of these are really cute

5423
03:13:24,000 --> 03:13:26,000
They're kind of the Phantom Hourglass style

5424
03:13:26,000 --> 03:13:28,000
That's cute

5425
03:13:28,000 --> 03:13:30,000
You should plug that in the chat room

5426
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:32,000
That link's a little long for me to read on air

5427
03:13:32,000 --> 03:13:34,000
But it's on Etsy, just search Papercraft Zelda

5428
03:13:34,000 --> 03:13:36,000
I guess

5429
03:13:36,000 --> 03:13:38,000
Oh, sends a tweet with more pictures

5430
03:13:38,000 --> 03:13:40,000
That one's really cute, I like the Mario one

5431
03:13:40,000 --> 03:13:42,000
I would hang that in my house

5432
03:13:42,000 --> 03:13:44,000
I want this game now, because you play as Jack

5433
03:13:44,000 --> 03:13:46,000
Anyhow

5434
03:13:46,000 --> 03:13:48,000
Thank you for the tweets

5435
03:13:48,000 --> 03:13:50,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R

5436
03:13:50,000 --> 03:13:52,000
to send us tweets in a future week

5437
03:13:52,000 --> 03:13:54,000
But you know what? We have got to close up the show

5438
03:13:54,000 --> 03:13:56,000
Oh, last minute stories

5439
03:13:56,000 --> 03:13:58,000
Let us Jack have a picture of Miranda in a room

5440
03:13:58,000 --> 03:14:00,000
I have no last minute stories

5441
03:14:00,000 --> 03:14:02,000
Well then I guess it's time to end

5442
03:14:02,000 --> 03:14:04,000
episode number 469

5443
03:14:04,000 --> 03:14:06,000
So

5444
03:14:06,000 --> 03:14:08,000
First off, I want to thank our guests

5445
03:14:08,000 --> 03:14:10,000
for being here tonight

5446
03:14:10,000 --> 03:14:12,000
Thank you so much for making the drive

5447
03:14:12,000 --> 03:14:14,000
All the way from Colorado

5448
03:14:14,000 --> 03:14:16,000
Huh?

5449
03:14:16,000 --> 03:14:18,000
It was a drive and Colorado was involved

5450
03:14:18,000 --> 03:14:20,000
But I'll take it

5451
03:14:20,000 --> 03:14:22,000
Thank you Jason for being here tonight

5452
03:14:22,000 --> 03:14:24,000
Appreciate it

5453
03:14:24,000 --> 03:14:26,000
And do you have any last minute thoughts?

5454
03:14:26,000 --> 03:14:28,000
Final thoughts?

5455
03:14:28,000 --> 03:14:30,000
I cry from laughing

5456
03:14:30,000 --> 03:14:32,000
Way too much

5457
03:14:32,000 --> 03:14:34,000
Ryan, thank you so much

5458
03:14:34,000 --> 03:14:36,000
You made it finally to a show

5459
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:38,000
Yay, finally

5460
03:14:38,000 --> 03:14:40,000
And I'm with Jason

5461
03:14:40,000 --> 03:14:42,000
My head hurts and I've been

5462
03:14:42,000 --> 03:14:44,000
laughing so hard I was crying earlier

5463
03:14:44,000 --> 03:14:46,000
All the feels

5464
03:14:46,000 --> 03:14:48,000
Is that your final thought tonight?

5465
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:50,000
I think so

5466
03:14:50,000 --> 03:14:52,000
Alright, well thank you for being here and please

5467
03:14:52,000 --> 03:14:54,000
come back again sometime

5468
03:14:54,000 --> 03:14:56,000
And I swear I'll get you a better mic next time

5469
03:14:56,000 --> 03:14:58,000
Alright, let's see

5470
03:14:58,000 --> 03:15:00,000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

5471
03:15:00,000 --> 03:15:02,000
I want a kitten, but Shermie is too fat and would sit on her

5472
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:04,000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

5473
03:15:04,000 --> 03:15:06,000
I drink too much water

5474
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:08,000
And my final thought tonight is

5475
03:15:08,000 --> 03:15:10,000
La la la la la

5476
03:15:10,000 --> 03:15:12,000
Thank you guys so much

5477
03:15:12,000 --> 03:15:14,000
I thought your final thought would have been

5478
03:15:14,000 --> 03:15:16,000
Uh oh

5479
03:15:16,000 --> 03:15:18,000
That's what happens when you drink too much water

5480
03:15:18,000 --> 03:15:20,000
Uh oh

5481
03:15:20,000 --> 03:15:22,000
See that sounds like either

5482
03:15:22,000 --> 03:15:24,000
ICQ or lemmings

5483
03:15:24,000 --> 03:15:26,000
That's what happens when I eat at Chipotle

5484
03:15:26,000 --> 03:15:28,000
Uh oh

5485
03:15:28,000 --> 03:15:30,000
Followed by

5486
03:15:32,000 --> 03:15:34,000
Oh I'm so glad we could have a poop joke

5487
03:15:34,000 --> 03:15:36,000
before the show was over

5488
03:15:36,000 --> 03:15:38,000
Thank you, Loki

5489
03:15:38,000 --> 03:15:40,000
We've already had dick

5490
03:15:40,000 --> 03:15:42,000
I'm sorry, alien dildo

5491
03:15:42,000 --> 03:15:44,000
Really? We got dick? Where?

5492
03:15:44,000 --> 03:15:46,000
Alright, that's it

5493
03:15:46,000 --> 03:15:48,000
We're done. Thank you guys so much for downloading our show

5494
03:15:48,000 --> 03:15:50,000
or listening to us live however it is

5495
03:15:50,000 --> 03:15:52,000
and checking out. Thank you for participating with

5496
03:15:52,000 --> 03:15:54,000
Orange Lounge Radio

5497
03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:56,000
You made it all the way to the end of the show

5498
03:15:56,000 --> 03:15:58,000
I really want to thank you guys

5499
03:15:58,000 --> 03:16:00,000
for your continued support week after week

5500
03:16:00,000 --> 03:16:02,000
You guys rock, thank you so much

5501
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:04,000
Please, if you enjoyed what you heard

5502
03:16:04,000 --> 03:16:06,000
Just tell a friend or two about the show

5503
03:16:06,000 --> 03:16:08,000
Because if you can believe it, we've been doing this for 469 episodes

5504
03:16:08,000 --> 03:16:10,000
And we're somehow still not

5505
03:16:10,000 --> 03:16:12,000
number one on iTunes

5506
03:16:12,000 --> 03:16:14,000
In fact, we're like number 204

5507
03:16:14,000 --> 03:16:16,000
I look today

5508
03:16:16,000 --> 03:16:18,000
So, please tell a friend or five

5509
03:16:18,000 --> 03:16:20,000
about the show

5510
03:16:20,000 --> 03:16:22,000
Spread the word, iTunes, Stitcher Radio, whatever

5511
03:16:22,000 --> 03:16:24,000
the kids use these days to listen to podcasts

5512
03:16:24,000 --> 03:16:26,000
The podcast app on iTunes, whatever

5513
03:16:26,000 --> 03:16:28,000
Listen to the show, spread the word

5514
03:16:28,000 --> 03:16:30,000
Tell a friend

5515
03:16:30,000 --> 03:16:32,000
Thank you so much for being here

5516
03:16:32,000 --> 03:16:34,000
And I guess we'll come back next week to do it all again

5517
03:16:34,000 --> 03:16:36,000
How's that sound?

5518
03:16:36,000 --> 03:16:38,000
I guess

5519
03:16:38,000 --> 03:16:40,000
Have a great week everybody, we'll see you next time

5520
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:42,000
here at Orange Lounge Radio

5521
03:16:42,000 --> 03:16:44,000

To join us for a live show

5526
03:16:52,000 --> 03:16:54,000

The views and opinions expressed

5531
03:17:02,000 --> 03:17:04,000
in this program do not necessarily

5532
03:17:04,000 --> 03:17:06,000
reflect those of the staff

5535
03:17:10,000 --> 03:17:12,000
But you know they were all still true

5536
03:17:12,000 --> 03:17:40,000
See you next week!

5537
03:17:42,000 --> 03:17:44,000
We just don't want

5538
03:17:44,000 --> 03:17:46,000
the party to stop y'all

5539
03:17:46,000 --> 03:17:48,000
We forgot to do this during the live show

5540
03:17:48,000 --> 03:17:50,000
so we're gonna attach this on here

5541
03:17:50,000 --> 03:17:52,000
at the very end. We just had so much stuff that was

5542
03:17:52,000 --> 03:17:54,000
given away tonight between that code that the

5543
03:17:54,000 --> 03:17:56,000
emailer had and then the code that you were gonna

5544
03:17:56,000 --> 03:17:58,000
email us for. We forgot to

5545
03:17:58,000 --> 03:18:00,000
announce who's gonna win this and get

5546
03:18:00,000 --> 03:18:02,000
Bradley's bag of PAX shit

5547
03:18:02,000 --> 03:18:04,000
that he got. That's right, that's the

5548
03:18:04,000 --> 03:18:06,000
sound of the bag. So now you're getting

5549
03:18:06,000 --> 03:18:08,000
a bag of PAX stuff that's been fondled

5550
03:18:08,000 --> 03:18:10,000
by Jason

5551
03:18:10,000 --> 03:18:12,000
That just increased the value

5552
03:18:12,000 --> 03:18:14,000
by.01 cents

5553
03:18:14,000 --> 03:18:16,000
He totally felt it up while we watched

5554
03:18:16,000 --> 03:18:18,000
Amazing. DarkSakura

5555
03:18:18,000 --> 03:18:20,000
pick a number between one and

5556
03:18:20,000 --> 03:18:22,000
what I told you before we started

5557
03:18:22,000 --> 03:18:24,000
Four. Four! One

5558
03:18:24,000 --> 03:18:26,000
Two, three, four

5559
03:18:26,000 --> 03:18:28,000
Congratulations William Murderface

5560
03:18:28,000 --> 03:18:30,000
Yay!

5561
03:18:30,000 --> 03:18:32,000
And what a lovely pleasant name to be giving

5562
03:18:32,000 --> 03:18:34,000
a bag of crap to. It's from

5563
03:18:34,000 --> 03:18:36,000
It's from Metalocalypse

5564
03:18:36,000 --> 03:18:38,000
It's from Metalocalypse

5565
03:18:38,000 --> 03:18:40,000
It's from Murderface

5566
03:18:40,000 --> 03:18:42,000
Somebody you could take home to mom

5567
03:18:42,000 --> 03:18:44,000
There you go

5568
03:18:44,000 --> 03:18:46,000
Really weird looking dude

5569
03:18:46,000 --> 03:18:48,000
So now we're really getting the party

5570
03:18:48,000 --> 03:18:50,000
Thank you for staying all the way to the very very

5571
03:18:50,000 --> 03:18:52,000
bitter end podcasties

5572
03:18:52,000 --> 03:18:54,000
Congratulations William Huggleface

5573
03:18:54,000 --> 03:18:56,000
I'm gonna change his name temporarily

5574
03:18:56,000 --> 03:18:58,000
Yeah, that's it

5575
03:18:58,000 --> 03:19:00,000
On to your next podcast

5576
03:19:00,000 --> 03:19:10,000
Thanks for watching and have a great day!
