9
00:01:04,927 --> 00:01:13,274
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about what is going on with the game industry with my friends, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:01:13,514 --> 00:01:13,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

11
00:01:14,154 --> 00:01:14,595
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?

12
00:01:15,555 --> 00:01:17,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel vaguely fit.

13
00:01:17,837 --> 00:01:18,518
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel fit?

14
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:19,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Vaguely.

15
00:01:19,639 --> 00:01:22,461
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel pretty and witty and... Hey.

16
00:01:23,181 --> 00:01:23,321
Shh.

17
00:01:23,862 --> 00:01:23,922
Shh.

18
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:25,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know.

19
00:01:25,342 --> 00:01:26,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone a little gay.

20
00:01:29,488 --> 00:01:29,828
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.

21
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:31,070
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to feel healthy.

22
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:35,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've had days where I feel healthy, and I've had days where I feel fat.

23
00:01:35,897 --> 00:01:38,140
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and sometimes a fat day is good, too, once in a while.

24
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,883
[SPEAKER_02]: But healthy is a good feeling, too.

25
00:01:40,163 --> 00:01:53,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it was just like, my intention is to walk a few days each week, and I decided to go walking, but I don't know if I've said it on the show before, but I wear Vibram five fingers, which are like the toe shoes.

26
00:01:53,526 --> 00:01:54,706
[SPEAKER_02]: You wear the glove shoes.

27
00:01:55,086 --> 00:01:55,746
[SPEAKER_05]: They're awesome.

28
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:59,227
[SPEAKER_02]: You make your feet look like hands.

29
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:00,107
[SPEAKER_02]: They're creepy.

30
00:02:00,927 --> 00:02:03,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, but it makes your feet walk how you're supposed to walk.

31
00:02:03,848 --> 00:02:05,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Makes you look like Spider-Man.

32
00:02:05,988 --> 00:02:08,230
[SPEAKER_05]: It's how people are supposed to walk is the thing.

33
00:02:09,111 --> 00:02:14,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to go too deep into it, but our modern tennis shoes have changed the way people walk for the worse.

34
00:02:15,137 --> 00:02:17,799
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where a lot of injuries come about.

35
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:20,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really getting back to the barefoot walking thing.

36
00:02:20,261 --> 00:02:21,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry for the echo.

37
00:02:23,684 --> 00:02:29,951
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really love them, but it makes me think more and more that humanity is not meant to walk on concrete.

38
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:32,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Concrete is terrible, terrible, terrible stuff.

39
00:02:33,775 --> 00:02:37,118
[SPEAKER_05]: And so my feet did not hurt until I walked on concrete.

40
00:02:37,138 --> 00:02:38,580
[SPEAKER_05]: When I walked in the grass, no more hurt.

41
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:40,730
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was a good walk.

42
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:42,271
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

43
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:43,251
[SPEAKER_05]: I got outside.

44
00:02:44,972 --> 00:02:45,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Outside.

45
00:02:45,753 --> 00:02:46,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Going outside is good.

46
00:02:46,974 --> 00:02:50,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody should put down the controller or the keyboard and go outside once in a while.

47
00:02:50,356 --> 00:02:53,178
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I was listening to the Mass Effect soundtrack.

48
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,200
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you can make your worlds collide.

49
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:56,721
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

50
00:02:57,401 --> 00:02:58,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, by the way, I apologize.

51
00:02:59,244 --> 00:03:03,670
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the perks about listening live to Orange Launch Radio is that you can check into the show live.

52
00:03:04,231 --> 00:03:05,233
[SPEAKER_02]: The check-ins are now up.

53
00:03:05,413 --> 00:03:12,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to do that because I was sidetracked during the pre-show and I literally sat down seconds before I picked up the microphone and went live.

54
00:03:12,263 --> 00:03:13,525
[SPEAKER_02]: So the check-ins are now up.

55
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:14,365
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

56
00:03:14,645 --> 00:03:17,247
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you listening on the podcast, you can also check in.

57
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:22,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Just listen for the little noise, the do-do-do-do-do-do, little victory sound, and then it'll tell you the passphrase.

58
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,611
[SPEAKER_02]: It is somewhere in the show.

59
00:03:24,631 --> 00:03:25,712
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to make sure you're listening to it.

60
00:03:25,752 --> 00:03:27,673
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's somewhere different in the show every week.

61
00:03:28,414 --> 00:03:30,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, also say hello to... What?

62
00:03:30,655 --> 00:03:30,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn it.

63
00:03:31,035 --> 00:03:32,316
[SPEAKER_05]: That song is in my head now.

64
00:03:32,336 --> 00:03:34,918
[SPEAKER_05]: The song from An American Tale, the Somewhere Out There...

65
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what the check-in noise sounds like?

66
00:03:38,103 --> 00:03:42,448
[SPEAKER_05]: No, when you said somewhere, I was like, that song is stuck in my head.

67
00:03:42,528 --> 00:03:44,130
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't thought of that song in years.

68
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:45,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn it, Rob.

69
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:46,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

70
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:48,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what to tell you.

71
00:03:51,693 --> 00:03:56,475
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to play this really quick here, if I can find it here.

72
00:03:56,716 --> 00:04:01,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you've heard this, DarkSakura, because I know you don't listen really back to the podcast, because you're on it, so you don't have to.

73
00:04:02,018 --> 00:04:03,999
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is a little noise.

74
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:06,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this is not the actual noise, but this is it.

75
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that kind of catchy, right?

76
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:10,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

77
00:04:11,423 --> 00:04:12,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's going to get stuck in your head right there.

78
00:04:13,224 --> 00:04:15,005
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little Bobby Blackwolf original right there.

79
00:04:17,112 --> 00:04:18,537
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I have an idea!

80
00:04:20,123 --> 00:04:20,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

81
00:04:20,585 --> 00:04:21,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's introduce Loki!

82
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Techmaster Loki is here tonight too.

83
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:25,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

84
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:26,502
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing, Loki?

85
00:04:27,122 --> 00:04:27,722
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm full now.

86
00:04:27,922 --> 00:04:28,483
[SPEAKER_02]: You're full?

87
00:04:28,883 --> 00:04:30,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because I... Full of rage.

88
00:04:31,224 --> 00:04:31,564
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

89
00:04:32,425 --> 00:04:37,087
[SPEAKER_08]: I bought one of the Memphis barbecue burgers over at Carl's Jr.

90
00:04:37,307 --> 00:04:37,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Hardee's.

91
00:04:38,348 --> 00:04:40,629
[SPEAKER_08]: That is drenched in barbecue sauce.

92
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:41,589
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

93
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:48,032
[SPEAKER_08]: I normally get the single, and the single's normally enough, but I hadn't eaten really today, so I was like, okay, I'll go with the $6 burger.

94
00:04:48,132 --> 00:04:49,473
[SPEAKER_08]: I really should have just stuck with the single.

95
00:04:49,493 --> 00:04:50,434
[SPEAKER_08]: The single is enough.

96
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,354
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's delicious.

97
00:04:52,414 --> 00:04:57,136
[SPEAKER_08]: And what makes it delicious is the fact that it combines not only a cheeseburger but pulled pork.

98
00:04:57,757 --> 00:05:01,698
[SPEAKER_08]: So you've got barbecued pulled pork and a cheeseburger with more barbecue sauce on it.

99
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:02,919
[SPEAKER_08]: And onion rings.

100
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,540
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fantastic.

101
00:05:06,277 --> 00:05:06,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Delicious.

102
00:05:07,518 --> 00:05:08,618
[SPEAKER_02]: I like their Western burger.

103
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Western bacon or whatever burger.

104
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:11,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's normally what I get.

105
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,402
[SPEAKER_02]: But remember we just had this discussion about healthy days and fat days.

106
00:05:14,822 --> 00:05:17,423
[SPEAKER_02]: If I have one of those, I'm definitely having a fat day.

107
00:05:17,463 --> 00:05:22,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's how I discovered it because I went to go get – I normally don't go to Carl's Jr.

108
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:27,089
[SPEAKER_08]: that much because it's further away from my work than normal, the other fast food places.

109
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:30,971
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just – I was like, I'm tired of eating McDonald's or Burger King.

110
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:32,412
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to go to Carl's Jr.

111
00:05:32,452 --> 00:05:32,652
[SPEAKER_08]: today.

112
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:36,316
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I went there to get the Double Western and I saw that they had this burger.

113
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,778
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, hey, I like pulled pork.

114
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:40,942
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to get a single because I'm not that hungry.

115
00:05:41,682 --> 00:05:42,704
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was delicious.

116
00:05:43,366 --> 00:05:47,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear I don't have delusions or anything that our show is that big in the scope of things.

117
00:05:47,688 --> 00:05:54,472
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a whole ton of listeners, though we do love the family we have that participates with us live in the podcast.

118
00:05:54,772 --> 00:06:02,836
[SPEAKER_02]: But it would be great if somebody deemed our audience large enough to get a food sponsorship with as much as we talk up the different foods.

119
00:06:03,876 --> 00:06:12,641
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to start censoring all the food titles that we... We're going to go get yogurt after the show at...

120
00:06:14,531 --> 00:06:20,137
[SPEAKER_08]: No, instead what you do is instead of doing the beep, you add like a sound file that says nom.

121
00:06:20,217 --> 00:06:24,721
[SPEAKER_08]: So every time you talk about, yeah, I totally had that burger at nom, nom, nom, nom.

122
00:06:26,523 --> 00:06:27,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the little kitty nom, nom, nom.

123
00:06:27,944 --> 00:06:28,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Nom, nom, nom.

124
00:06:29,185 --> 00:06:30,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but then you're talking about editing.

125
00:06:31,227 --> 00:06:35,649
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I like to do live radio because it doesn't involve editing, if you haven't noticed.

126
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:40,331
[SPEAKER_02]: I also like to do live radio because we have the chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

127
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:47,635
[SPEAKER_02]: And Bobby, in reference to me playing the theme a little bit before, said, now people are going to think that the check-ins are happening that early.

128
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:48,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, gotcha.

129
00:06:49,195 --> 00:06:51,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make sure everybody was paying attention.

130
00:06:51,937 --> 00:06:57,840
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the people that are kind of just doing data entry in the background and zoning out and all that.

131
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that I have your attention...

132
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:03,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Watermelons.

133
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:04,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

134
00:07:04,536 --> 00:07:05,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's see.

135
00:07:05,936 --> 00:07:08,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, what are the other comments in chat?

136
00:07:09,257 --> 00:07:12,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody said, oh, Tigerclaw said you can use that sound when there's breaking news.

137
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:16,540
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we can't jack the NBC breaking news theme, which is so epic.

138
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:17,955
[SPEAKER_08]: It is epic.

139
00:07:18,415 --> 00:07:25,977
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as much as people hate NBC after the Olympics and all that crap, you have to admit, NBC gets some epic fucking music for their presentations.

140
00:07:26,017 --> 00:07:27,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, the Olympic theme?

141
00:07:28,017 --> 00:07:29,017
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit is epic.

142
00:07:29,097 --> 00:07:31,598
[SPEAKER_02]: I realize, like, John Williams did that, not some NBC dude.

143
00:07:31,658 --> 00:07:32,698
[SPEAKER_05]: I played that in high school band.

144
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:34,558
[SPEAKER_02]: And didn't you feel epic?

145
00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:42,280
[SPEAKER_05]: We can start stealing... Especially since I played saxophone and got the little... We can start stealing the Game of Thrones theme.

146
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,660
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's pretty epic, too.

147
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:46,241
[SPEAKER_05]: No chair of swords allowed.

148
00:07:47,461 --> 00:07:48,782
[SPEAKER_08]: But the theme's awesome, okay?

149
00:07:48,822 --> 00:07:52,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Separate from the whole... If you want awesome, we should just use the Xena theme.

150
00:07:54,024 --> 00:07:55,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

151
00:07:57,466 --> 00:07:59,927
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's if we want the show to have lesbian undertones.

152
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:02,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no problem with this.

153
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe in a future week.

154
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:07,391
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you have lesbian undertones when there's two men and a woman?

155
00:08:07,631 --> 00:08:08,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure how that works.

156
00:08:08,892 --> 00:08:09,592
[SPEAKER_02]: She's double lesbian.

157
00:08:09,612 --> 00:08:10,493
[SPEAKER_05]: I like boobs too.

158
00:08:13,134 --> 00:08:20,136
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll have to like your own boobs, though, unless we get some lady callers later, which is always a distinct possibility when we take live calls from our chat room later.

159
00:08:20,156 --> 00:08:21,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Should I ask everyone about their boobs?

160
00:08:23,017 --> 00:08:24,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to have booby chat tonight with the callers?

161
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:25,978
[SPEAKER_05]: No, thank you.

162
00:08:26,278 --> 00:08:29,139
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if any of our women would call in to do booby chat.

163
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:45,907
[SPEAKER_02]: The show, well, Syl would totally do it, but the show's on too late for her, because she's on the other side of the pond, and they're eight hours ahead of us, so if you have to stay up anywhere in the UK, really, no matter where you're at, Britain, Scotland, Ireland, I know we have listeners in all those places, and what time is the show live here?

164
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:46,687
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss our Swede.

165
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:47,348
[SPEAKER_02]: 2 a.m.

166
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:48,868
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss our Swedes.

167
00:08:49,689 --> 00:08:50,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we had a couple folks in Sweden.

168
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I did see, I don't know if you've looked at email, but we do have an email from Belgium tonight.

169
00:08:55,271 --> 00:08:56,172
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Belgium!

170
00:08:56,232 --> 00:08:56,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.

171
00:08:56,992 --> 00:08:57,913
[SPEAKER_02]: I love waffles.

172
00:09:00,026 --> 00:09:00,566
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be beer.

173
00:09:24,742 --> 00:09:25,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to ask this question.

174
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:51,286
[SPEAKER_02]: and Pinkberry.

175
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:51,807
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm wondering...

176
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,248
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

177
00:10:36,047 --> 00:10:38,988
[SPEAKER_05]: I proposed to my husband of marathoning Super Mario World.

178
00:10:40,408 --> 00:10:41,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Mario World.

179
00:10:41,488 --> 00:10:45,769
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I also just proposed to Becky of marathoning Mass Effect 2 on Saturday.

180
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:46,730
[SPEAKER_05]: You do that anyway.

181
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:55,132
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I play Mass Effect 3 for me, which means I have to finish it before we finish Mass Effect 2 for her so that I can play through Mass Effect 3 while she watches.

182
00:10:57,232 --> 00:11:25,602
[SPEAKER_08]: you know what would be fun actually you should try this Jamie is marathoning romhacks for Mario Brothers that would be awesome I would scream so much well not necessarily the ones that are insanely hard but just the new ones like they have some really good romhacks that and like Link to the Past has some really good romhacks I'm like I kind of want to play this because it's different it's like going into Link to the Past for the first time again and it's kind of cool that sounds really cool to me

183
00:11:26,173 --> 00:11:30,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Except the whole thing is actually breaking out the systems and playing.

184
00:11:31,336 --> 00:11:40,922
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing that we had, we actually just watched a whole, Dan and I watched a whole playthrough of Vampire Killer on MSX, which came out after the Castlevania that we got on the NES.

185
00:11:42,283 --> 00:11:46,786
[SPEAKER_05]: But it sort of inspired me to want to actually play through Dracula X again.

186
00:11:48,427 --> 00:11:50,428
[SPEAKER_05]: It sort of sounded like a classic gaming weekend.

187
00:11:51,588 --> 00:11:51,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like fun.

188
00:11:51,968 --> 00:11:52,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus Mass Effect.

189
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:53,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Garrus.

190
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:58,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it would also be a fun weekend to go out to like the flea markets around and try to find some more classic games.

191
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.

192
00:11:59,231 --> 00:11:59,551
[SPEAKER_05]: And then?

193
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,212
[SPEAKER_05]: And then?

194
00:12:00,492 --> 00:12:00,892
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not 105.

195
00:12:00,932 --> 00:12:01,172
[SPEAKER_02]: And then?

196
00:12:01,212 --> 00:12:02,232
[SPEAKER_02]: No and then.

197
00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:03,173
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be.

198
00:12:03,213 --> 00:12:03,453
[SPEAKER_02]: And then?

199
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:04,213
[SPEAKER_02]: No and then.

200
00:12:04,373 --> 00:12:04,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Farmer's Market.

201
00:12:06,214 --> 00:12:07,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Mexican candy.

202
00:12:08,014 --> 00:12:08,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki got it.

203
00:12:08,935 --> 00:12:10,115
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

204
00:12:10,155 --> 00:12:11,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, where's my car?

205
00:12:11,636 --> 00:12:12,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

206
00:12:12,996 --> 00:12:14,857
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you need to catch up on over the long weekend?

207
00:12:15,738 --> 00:12:21,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, what I've been trying to do is stop doing modding stuff.

208
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:25,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I have people that ask me for Grand Theft Auto mod stuff.

209
00:12:25,526 --> 00:12:28,128
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like, I can't port my map mods over.

210
00:12:28,168 --> 00:12:28,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you do it for me?

211
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:31,271
[SPEAKER_08]: So I waste a whole fucking week doing that shit.

212
00:12:31,311 --> 00:12:32,412
[SPEAKER_08]: And it just gets so tiring.

213
00:12:32,772 --> 00:12:34,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm like, I don't want to do this.

214
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:37,055
[SPEAKER_08]: But yet, for some stupid reason, they keep saying, yes, I'll do it for you.

215
00:12:38,096 --> 00:12:40,819
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd like to just not do that and actually play games.

216
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:41,279
[SPEAKER_08]: And...

217
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,322
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, I don't really know what games I'd want to play.

218
00:12:46,482 --> 00:12:51,104
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to play Minecraft on 360 with other people, but there's no one on.

219
00:12:51,184 --> 00:12:52,925
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a way to burn an entire weekend.

220
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, but there's nobody to play with.

221
00:12:55,186 --> 00:12:55,767
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the thing.

222
00:12:56,207 --> 00:12:58,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I do have one of the people that's on my friends list.

223
00:12:58,808 --> 00:13:02,150
[SPEAKER_08]: He keeps wanting to play, but it's always when I'm on break at work.

224
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,532
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, dude, I can't play with you right now because I'm going to have five minutes and that's it.

225
00:13:07,192 --> 00:13:09,233
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'll be on my 360 during break.

226
00:13:09,293 --> 00:13:09,453
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

227
00:13:10,854 --> 00:13:12,195
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, there's no one to play with.

228
00:13:12,235 --> 00:13:20,841
[SPEAKER_08]: I really wish that Minecraft on the 360 had an option to randomly connect you to like a server that, you know, has, okay, allow strangers to connect or something like that.

229
00:13:21,341 --> 00:13:25,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Or, you know, have that option where I can allow strangers to connect to my server.

230
00:13:25,224 --> 00:13:29,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Granted, you run the risk of someone, you know, going through and griefing and stuff, but...

231
00:13:29,947 --> 00:13:30,907
[SPEAKER_08]: You can always ban them.

232
00:13:32,248 --> 00:13:33,228
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would just kind of like that.

233
00:13:33,248 --> 00:13:36,729
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd be able to play with random people and actually get a multiplayer game going.

234
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:39,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's kind of boring with just one or two people.

235
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:42,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we've been playing, we actually started yet another world.

236
00:13:44,452 --> 00:13:46,973
[SPEAKER_08]: And we actually picked the tutorial world this time.

237
00:13:47,253 --> 00:13:52,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is kind of fun because it made it a little more interesting because there's actual things built in, little hidden things to find.

238
00:13:53,495 --> 00:14:15,230
[SPEAKER_08]: and you can you know you didn't have to worry about right away okay I need to find stuff to make sticky pistons I'll just steal some out of the stuff that's already built which is kind of cool or hey you know I need to go find some diamonds to make some diamond armor and stuff oh wait I know where the hidden thing is where there's some diamond stuff so that's kind of cool or I'm gonna need some wood so I'm gonna just tear down this house instead of those already built and so that was kind of fun

239
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,291
[SPEAKER_08]: For a little bit, and then it got boring again.

240
00:14:18,512 --> 00:14:19,432
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the problem.

241
00:14:19,472 --> 00:14:25,376
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, it's so far behind the PC version that it's kind of boring.

242
00:14:25,596 --> 00:14:32,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas, like, I'm reading about, like, the cool PC stuff that they're adding now and, like, the kind of snapshots for each week.

243
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:48,349
[SPEAKER_08]: and it sounds pretty awesome like they're adding all this new stuff like new monsters that look really fucking hard to kill I mean that would be really cool in the 360 version but it's just not there so I guess I have to start playing the PC version since I bought it that would be kind of fun maybe I should do that but

244
00:14:48,909 --> 00:14:53,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Once again, I need people to play with, and I don't want to play with random strangers.

245
00:14:54,414 --> 00:14:56,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you upset that I haven't been signing on to Xbox lately?

246
00:14:56,836 --> 00:14:57,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what this is all about?

247
00:14:57,777 --> 00:14:58,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, just everybody.

248
00:14:59,018 --> 00:14:59,338
[SPEAKER_08]: No one is.

249
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:05,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, I launch Minecraft almost every single day, and there's no one on, ever.

250
00:15:05,603 --> 00:15:06,784
[SPEAKER_05]: That reminds me of... I don't know.

251
00:15:06,944 --> 00:15:07,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

252
00:15:09,348 --> 00:15:12,930
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to start picking up real soon, though, with the expansion.

253
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:23,657
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not really trying to get into any games right now, start anything new, because Borderlands 2 is coming out, and I know that's going to be a big time drain right there.

254
00:15:23,777 --> 00:15:28,320
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll probably be the one game I play until Call of Duty Black Ops 2, I think.

255
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:31,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to some comments from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

256
00:15:32,303 --> 00:15:34,805
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says, I know what Loki can do during the break.

257
00:15:35,025 --> 00:15:36,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Update the OLR PSP site.

258
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:37,927
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not going to happen.

259
00:15:39,307 --> 00:15:42,548
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time to start on the PSV.

260
00:15:42,848 --> 00:15:45,169
[SPEAKER_02]: OLRPSV.com that doesn't exist yet.

261
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:47,049
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to do that.

262
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:48,730
[SPEAKER_08]: No one cares anymore.

263
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,210
[SPEAKER_02]: OLR3DS.com not happening?

264
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:51,650
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

265
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,971
[SPEAKER_02]: OLRWU.com?

266
00:15:52,991 --> 00:15:59,372
[SPEAKER_08]: See, the problem is now all these things have web browsers and hopefully they all support HTML5 and so that's not even an issue anymore.

267
00:15:59,412 --> 00:16:02,673
[SPEAKER_08]: You can just go to our site at thevognetwork.com and

268
00:16:04,301 --> 00:16:07,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Just listen without having to, you know.

269
00:16:08,582 --> 00:16:22,306
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing we do need to look into doing, though, at some point is remaking the OrangeLoungeRadio.com site because now we kind of have a lot of our, like, forum resources and community resources are pouring in to trying to pool together with the other shows to make VOGNetwork.com bigger.

270
00:16:22,786 --> 00:16:27,347
[SPEAKER_02]: OrangeLoungeRadio.com was probably more about us and our history and our shows and so forth.

271
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:30,028
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would be fun to have something for that, you know.

272
00:16:30,348 --> 00:16:30,608
[SPEAKER_08]: It would...

273
00:16:30,928 --> 00:16:38,896
[SPEAKER_08]: To me, I mean, I think it'd be kind of cool like how we had on all games a while back where it was just a section of the website.

274
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,998
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, okay, here's the Orange Lounge radio section.

275
00:16:41,018 --> 00:16:48,405
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a section for each show and just have it linked to that and just make something cool there on our own site on VOG so we don't have to like...

276
00:16:49,165 --> 00:16:51,067
[SPEAKER_08]: We have forums already.

277
00:16:51,107 --> 00:16:53,028
[SPEAKER_08]: The forums in the Orange Launch site are kind of dead.

278
00:16:53,969 --> 00:16:59,352
[SPEAKER_02]: They're technically supposed to be closed by now because we're going to fold them into the VOG Network forums that are a little more active.

279
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:00,793
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what I'm saying.

280
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kind of erase the site.

281
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:08,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we were already doing everything that we were doing on that site anyways on VOG.

282
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,480
[SPEAKER_08]: So just kind of move it over.

283
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,481
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have ideas, we'd love to hear them.

284
00:17:12,521 --> 00:17:17,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com And some of the folks in chat room are talking about apps and so forth.

285
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:20,624
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to learn how to program.

286
00:17:20,644 --> 00:17:21,905
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as I learn how to make apps.

287
00:17:22,105 --> 00:17:24,506
[SPEAKER_02]: I know somebody that makes apps, but they have other priorities.

288
00:17:24,706 --> 00:17:25,246
[SPEAKER_08]: I almost...

289
00:17:26,656 --> 00:17:27,497
[SPEAKER_08]: LocoRoco's Cousin

290
00:17:46,957 --> 00:17:52,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Loco Poco says, I need to catch up on Folklore, Resonance of Fate, and Valkyria Chronicles.

291
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all excellent choices.

292
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Valkyria Chronicles is one of my personal ones, too.

293
00:17:55,941 --> 00:18:00,464
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had that on PS3, I don't know how long, and I've yet to make a lot of progress in that game, but it's really fun.

294
00:18:01,544 --> 00:18:07,027
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw says, in reality, Sky just wants to go to Disneyland again, lol, in regards to the week off.

295
00:18:07,427 --> 00:18:07,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, what?

296
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:27,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Not and I, and me.

297
00:18:28,432 --> 00:18:29,073
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an object.

298
00:18:29,153 --> 00:18:30,094
[SPEAKER_02]: No one cur.

299
00:18:30,134 --> 00:18:30,434
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

300
00:18:30,894 --> 00:18:31,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

301
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:33,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

302
00:18:33,317 --> 00:18:44,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and lastly, in reference to the mental image I put in all your heads earlier, VXJasonXV in our chat room says, Oh, and now that underwear is involved, video live stream.

303
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all are perverts.

304
00:18:47,757 --> 00:18:52,460
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to do a live stream, not of that, of the games, but it's technology.

305
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I do want to do live streaming stuff.

306
00:18:55,901 --> 00:19:01,044
[SPEAKER_08]: I have about two or three capture cards or capture devices.

307
00:19:01,064 --> 00:19:02,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Set that crap up over here.

308
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:02,485
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we do.

309
00:19:02,505 --> 00:19:03,125
[SPEAKER_08]: We can do that.

310
00:19:03,806 --> 00:19:04,326
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fun.

311
00:19:04,506 --> 00:19:06,187
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little bit more complicated.

312
00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:07,648
[SPEAKER_08]: I always watch the playthroughs.

313
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Freddie Wong, they've been doing a land game on PC of Minecraft.

314
00:19:14,031 --> 00:19:17,133
[SPEAKER_08]: and it looks so much fun playing with other people.

315
00:19:17,473 --> 00:19:24,998
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like, okay, everybody gets one life and we're just going to work together and we're going to do this stuff and then they just kind of film it and edit it together and it looks fun.

316
00:19:25,018 --> 00:19:27,100
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, I just want to do that.

317
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to play with those people.

318
00:19:28,561 --> 00:19:29,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

319
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:40,889
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not, you got me sidetracked though because in reference to the comment that Jason made, now that underwear is involved, video live stream, I had the chance to play my favorite Tyra Banks clip that I haven't played on the show in years.

320
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:57,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Because today, today is a panty porter!

321
00:19:59,876 --> 00:20:01,917
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be my Labor Day weekend right there.

322
00:20:01,997 --> 00:20:02,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Panty party.

323
00:20:02,978 --> 00:20:09,282
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, my wife, ever since the passing of Whitney Houston, has kind of latched on to Tyra Banks instead.

324
00:20:09,302 --> 00:20:10,103
[SPEAKER_02]: I've noticed.

325
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:16,348
[SPEAKER_08]: As kind of observing the train wreck that's happening.

326
00:20:16,368 --> 00:20:22,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Whitney Houston, well, she used to like watching Whitney Houston's Facebook page because there's a lot of stupid people that comment on there.

327
00:20:23,173 --> 00:20:24,333
[SPEAKER_08]: But Tyra's page...

328
00:20:25,214 --> 00:20:29,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Tyra posts a lot of really stupid things, and it's funny.

329
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:38,530
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you one of my... I mean, this has absolutely nothing to do with video games, but this is kind of a game in itself, and it has to do with Facebook, which is, you know, big for gaming, right?

330
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,172
[SPEAKER_02]: This is hilarious, but...

331
00:20:40,652 --> 00:20:48,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to various fast food and chain restaurants and just go to the thing that lets you see what everybody's posting on there.

332
00:20:48,697 --> 00:20:51,679
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not even talking like the controversial shit like Chick-fil-A.

333
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Like go on Facebook and look up like the Olive Gardens page, Red Lobster, Applebee's.

334
00:20:59,405 --> 00:21:03,627
[SPEAKER_02]: You will see some amazing shit that people post on those pages.

335
00:21:04,188 --> 00:21:10,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Everywhere from complaints about a particular restaurant to somebody making a post like,

336
00:21:10,892 --> 00:21:13,813
[SPEAKER_02]: So and so just took me here to Applebee's for my anniversary.

337
00:21:13,853 --> 00:21:14,793
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so excited.

338
00:21:14,853 --> 00:21:19,674
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a picture of them smiling because people don't understand privacy controls.

339
00:21:20,094 --> 00:21:26,355
[SPEAKER_05]: That just makes me think of a line from one of my favorite comics, Henry Cho, who's not related to Margaret Cho, although he is Korean.

340
00:21:27,255 --> 00:21:27,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Born in Tennessee.

341
00:21:30,136 --> 00:21:33,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Talking about his brother-in-law from Arab, Alabama.

342
00:21:34,297 --> 00:21:34,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

343
00:21:36,001 --> 00:21:37,982
[SPEAKER_05]: We just got a new Italian restaurant.

344
00:21:38,482 --> 00:21:39,482
[SPEAKER_05]: It ain't no Olive Garden.

345
00:22:03,067 --> 00:22:07,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, quickly, my weekend, my plans for the weekend.

346
00:22:07,934 --> 00:22:16,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would be really fun to do an epic Civ V match that goes all weekend long, but I don't know if I can find any other suckers that would buy into that.

347
00:22:17,006 --> 00:22:19,370
[SPEAKER_05]: I know someone who plays on Xbox, but I don't think he plays online.

348
00:22:21,491 --> 00:22:25,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox One is different because that's the Civ Revolution and those games can go a lot faster.

349
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:26,074
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do one of those in a night.

350
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:32,238
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm talking like Civilization V Epic Mode, although that game would take months to finish.

351
00:22:32,598 --> 00:22:38,302
[SPEAKER_02]: But you could even do just even a normal game takes forever in Civilization V. That would be fun.

352
00:22:38,342 --> 00:22:39,503
[SPEAKER_02]: DayZ would be fun too.

353
00:22:39,523 --> 00:22:44,726
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's going back to games that would be fun to do a live stream of.

354
00:22:45,046 --> 00:22:49,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, live streaming PC games might... It's still difficult.

355
00:22:50,432 --> 00:22:51,674
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, DayZ would be fun.

356
00:22:52,216 --> 00:22:53,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Hang on, we got zombies.

357
00:22:54,978 --> 00:22:55,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Crazy person.

358
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,343
[SPEAKER_02]: The other game I really need to catch up on is Borderlands.

359
00:23:01,224 --> 00:23:02,024
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's be real.

360
00:23:02,445 --> 00:23:11,693
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much happening on Tuesday between the official launch of Guild Wars 2, the patch in Warcraft, Rock Band Blitz, Mass Effect 3 DLC.

361
00:23:12,373 --> 00:23:16,236
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way I'm playing catch up over the weekend because I have to play everything that came out on Tuesday.

362
00:23:17,137 --> 00:23:18,018
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fun game.

363
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:18,699
[SPEAKER_02]: You playing on PC?

364
00:23:18,719 --> 00:23:18,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.

365
00:23:34,115 --> 00:23:34,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Allen has it too.

366
00:23:35,316 --> 00:23:35,997
[SPEAKER_02]: We can all play.

367
00:23:36,017 --> 00:23:36,517
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

368
00:23:37,158 --> 00:23:38,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby's been wanting to play too.

369
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:39,160
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

370
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:39,820
[SPEAKER_02]: The foursome.

371
00:23:40,081 --> 00:23:40,561
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

372
00:23:41,042 --> 00:23:41,322
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

373
00:23:42,483 --> 00:23:47,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about our actual gaming weeks, the stuff we have been playing this week.

374
00:23:47,988 --> 00:23:48,789
[SPEAKER_02]: More current stuff.

375
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:49,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, DarkSakura.

376
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I say one more thing about the week in general?

377
00:23:51,492 --> 00:23:51,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.

378
00:23:52,253 --> 00:23:53,574
[SPEAKER_05]: I did a good deed this weekend.

379
00:23:53,894 --> 00:23:54,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah?

380
00:23:54,715 --> 00:23:57,778
[SPEAKER_05]: We rescued a kitten from the dumpster outside my synagogue.

381
00:23:58,044 --> 00:24:03,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, before people start crying, you found out nobody left the cat in the dumpster until... No.

382
00:24:03,591 --> 00:24:04,252
[SPEAKER_02]: He was feral.

383
00:24:04,512 --> 00:24:06,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Little faith in humanity restored.

384
00:24:06,383 --> 00:24:07,444
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

385
00:24:30,465 --> 00:24:31,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Fixed and adopted out.

386
00:24:32,446 --> 00:24:35,988
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to say for anyone who's asked, the kitty story has a happy ending.

387
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:36,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

388
00:24:36,829 --> 00:24:39,730
[SPEAKER_05]: And his official name is Donut.

389
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,631
[SPEAKER_05]: They've called him Donut.

390
00:24:41,691 --> 00:24:42,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of Bat Cat.

391
00:24:42,472 --> 00:24:42,952
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good name.

392
00:24:43,152 --> 00:24:43,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Donut.

393
00:24:44,073 --> 00:24:46,474
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just glad I don't have those cats in our backyard anymore.

394
00:24:46,814 --> 00:24:48,295
[SPEAKER_08]: We had 11 cats at one time.

395
00:24:48,495 --> 00:24:48,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Lord.

396
00:24:49,315 --> 00:24:51,997
[SPEAKER_02]: All I know is I got a text message from DarkSakura on Friday night.

397
00:24:52,137 --> 00:24:52,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want a kitten?

398
00:24:53,298 --> 00:24:57,320
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, um, we have a tiny ass apartment and two cats already.

399
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to, but no.

400
00:24:59,781 --> 00:25:03,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Shermie would be too old for me to have a little feral kitten in the house to tame.

401
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:06,144
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, he's only six weeks old, so he's tameable.

402
00:25:06,724 --> 00:25:12,466
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, before we get into our regular gaming weeks and what we have been playing, I do want to talk to the chatters.

403
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:18,428
[SPEAKER_02]: WhatUpG leaves a comment about Tuesday saying, Sky forgot the biggest game release, Madden 13.

404
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:24,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Although certainly I will acknowledge that will be a huge game release and lots of people are going to be playing that over the Labor Day weekend.

405
00:25:25,411 --> 00:25:30,093
[SPEAKER_02]: My household won't be one of them because that's not really a series we've ever gotten into.

406
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:31,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a big football person.

407
00:25:31,674 --> 00:25:39,238
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're not a fan of that and for whatever reason you just don't download games off the PlayStation, there's a Journey Collector's Edition coming out this week on disc.

408
00:25:39,758 --> 00:25:51,264
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got the soundtrack, you get Journey, you get Flower Flow, and also two little quick games that they made and a month of PlayStation Plus.

409
00:25:51,837 --> 00:25:56,560
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great deal if you don't have any of those games because all three of those games are great.

410
00:25:57,441 --> 00:26:00,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't even know if you could call Flow a game, but whatever.

411
00:26:00,442 --> 00:26:01,863
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all right.

412
00:26:01,943 --> 00:26:05,646
[SPEAKER_02]: They're neat, but Journey is amazing.

413
00:26:06,146 --> 00:26:07,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Contender for Game of the Year, to be honest.

414
00:26:07,727 --> 00:26:08,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't stop believing.

415
00:26:08,948 --> 00:26:09,988
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, not that Journey.

416
00:26:10,489 --> 00:26:11,850
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the 2012 Journey.

417
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:15,392
[SPEAKER_08]: That might make it a little bit better if it had Journey music in there, but their music was pretty good.

418
00:26:15,412 --> 00:26:16,132
[SPEAKER_02]: A little mishmash.

419
00:26:16,172 --> 00:26:17,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure somebody's done that on YouTube.

420
00:26:17,633 --> 00:26:18,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Journey set to Journey?

421
00:26:18,554 --> 00:26:19,014
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen it.

422
00:26:19,254 --> 00:26:19,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

423
00:26:20,835 --> 00:26:25,279
[SPEAKER_02]: The music in Journey 2012 is legitimately really good.

424
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:31,543
[SPEAKER_02]: As much as I love Journey 1980s, you can't do that to Journey 2012.

425
00:26:31,863 --> 00:26:34,786
[SPEAKER_02]: The music in Journey 2012 is so flipping good.

426
00:26:34,846 --> 00:26:43,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we get a Journey 2012 2 where it's basically the premise of Revolution X but with Journey instead?

427
00:26:43,492 --> 00:26:43,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

428
00:26:44,773 --> 00:26:45,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Wouldn't that be kind of cool?

429
00:26:45,674 --> 00:26:48,537
[SPEAKER_05]: So do you have, what, dude on the toilet at the beginning of the game?

430
00:26:48,637 --> 00:26:51,860
[SPEAKER_02]: If Steve Perry was talking to any of the others whatsoever, maybe.

431
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:57,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, well, the guy they have now... The guy they have now, number one, is hot.

432
00:26:57,485 --> 00:26:59,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, has really nice hair.

433
00:26:59,066 --> 00:27:01,288
[SPEAKER_05]: And number three, can sing.

434
00:27:01,468 --> 00:27:02,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong.

435
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:03,370
[SPEAKER_02]: He's really good and he can sing.

436
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:06,112
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, I have seen Journey live recently when he was the front man.

437
00:27:06,172 --> 00:27:06,913
[SPEAKER_02]: They were really good.

438
00:27:06,953 --> 00:27:07,353
[SPEAKER_05]: We were there.

439
00:27:07,574 --> 00:27:07,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

440
00:27:08,434 --> 00:27:09,415
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean...

441
00:27:10,416 --> 00:27:10,656
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura

442
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:51,203
[SPEAKER_05]: uh wow Mass Effect 2 Mass Effect 3 um the Mass Effect thingy on my phone since I'm trying to get my rating back up um and uh yeah

443
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan likes to do that.

444
00:27:54,197 --> 00:27:57,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Every so often I'll just get invested and watch.

445
00:28:13,223 --> 00:28:15,686
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't mind doing an episodic playthrough of something, but you know...

446
00:28:33,246 --> 00:28:41,954
[SPEAKER_05]: I like watching other people do it, except it kind of bugs me because, I mean, it is truly what an almost perfect playthrough looks like because they're usually machine-assisted, you know?

447
00:28:42,395 --> 00:28:45,658
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw wants to know if you're going to get the Mass Effect 3 Leviathan DLC.

448
00:28:45,998 --> 00:28:46,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck yes.

449
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,743
[SPEAKER_02]: As if that should surprise anybody whatsoever.

450
00:28:50,983 --> 00:28:52,725
[SPEAKER_05]: I am so excited, you guys.

451
00:28:53,085 --> 00:28:54,927
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I kind of don't want to beat my game yet.

452
00:28:55,527 --> 00:29:12,658
[SPEAKER_05]: you finally set foot in multiplayer not that long ago yeah once and then I couldn't find anybody else on because no one would let me know when they were playing we need to make that happen again well for me I have to change out my EXE because I have a hacked EXE so I can play in god mode but I saved my original file so that I can switch out for multiplayer

453
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiger Claw, just wanted to give a plug.

454
00:29:14,721 --> 00:29:17,123
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of classic games played on Twitch TV.

455
00:29:17,163 --> 00:29:19,766
[SPEAKER_02]: There are people doing speed runs on old Mario games.

456
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:20,286
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

457
00:29:20,306 --> 00:29:22,068
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't like to watch it live, I guess.

458
00:29:22,648 --> 00:29:23,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless it's for charity.

459
00:29:24,249 --> 00:29:24,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

460
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Mario Marathon you're down with.

461
00:29:26,191 --> 00:29:26,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

462
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:27,592
[SPEAKER_02]: That's understandable.

463
00:29:27,993 --> 00:29:29,934
[SPEAKER_05]: And even then I'm like, dude, you're still playing Sunshine.

464
00:29:30,014 --> 00:29:30,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

465
00:29:31,756 --> 00:29:32,236
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Sunshine.

466
00:29:32,256 --> 00:29:32,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute.

467
00:29:32,556 --> 00:29:34,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't you say Sunshine was a good game on last week's show?

468
00:29:34,518 --> 00:29:36,840
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Sunshine, but it's kind of boring to watch it.

469
00:29:37,681 --> 00:29:37,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Like,

470
00:29:39,994 --> 00:29:43,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Even as much as I love Mario 64, it's kind of boring to watch it.

471
00:29:44,956 --> 00:29:45,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Understandable.

472
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:46,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Loki, how about you?

473
00:29:46,857 --> 00:29:47,637
[SPEAKER_08]: How was your gaming week?

474
00:29:48,178 --> 00:29:51,459
[SPEAKER_08]: This week I played lots of Minecraft, mainly.

475
00:29:51,979 --> 00:29:57,882
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit of Grand Theft Auto because I was working on mods and stuff.

476
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:16,791
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, going back to Minecraft though, we started a new map that's a tutorial level, which is kind of fun at the start off on that, and then played through a little bit of that, and I actually went back last night to my VOG map and was working a little bit more in peaceful mode too.

477
00:30:17,452 --> 00:30:30,489
[SPEAKER_08]: I was finishing up some minecart stations they make the little bell intro thing when they stop and then it waits like 5 seconds or so and then it makes that noise again and then goes automatically

478
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

479
00:30:51,992 --> 00:31:16,500
[SPEAKER_08]: landscape I guess and then there's a few that have like the golden apples hidden in there and chests and stuff but it's just I mean that's pretty much it if you restart your levels or start new seeds now there's clay which I never used anyway so it's not a big deal and then you know slimes I guess slime farms are kind of important now that they're sticky pistons and that kind of thing

480
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:38,648
[SPEAKER_08]: but I don't know I haven't really bothered to find those usually I just try to find some interesting looking landscape and stuff but even now it's just kind of boring going back to that stuff just waiting for the next update the adventure update I think is going to make it a lot more fun but we'll have to see

481
00:31:39,348 --> 00:31:43,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, so anyways, so yeah, Minecraft stuff, and then, uh, I actually played a little bit of new stuff.

482
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:46,671
[SPEAKER_08]: I played, uh, more Sleeping Dogs again.

483
00:31:46,911 --> 00:31:52,713
[SPEAKER_08]: I, for some reason, my save, like, I had done a bunch of missions, and my save just didn't save or something.

484
00:31:53,093 --> 00:31:56,574
[SPEAKER_08]: I must have forgotten to save, or it didn't auto-save, or whatever.

485
00:31:57,194 --> 00:32:01,376
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I'm having to redo a bunch of missions, so I did that today.

486
00:32:01,576 --> 00:32:05,317
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, uh, one new game I actually picked up, I picked up, um...

487
00:32:07,001 --> 00:32:08,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Scott Pilgrim vs. The World

488
00:32:36,235 --> 00:32:40,621
[SPEAKER_08]: We got to the boss and that was about it, but we didn't get to beat it because we ran out of time.

489
00:32:40,862 --> 00:32:43,325
[SPEAKER_08]: So the stages are a little long for that game.

490
00:32:43,385 --> 00:32:48,452
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, kind of since it's more like an arcade game, but it's really awesome.

491
00:32:48,632 --> 00:32:50,115
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the animation is amazing.

492
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,436
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the way it looks and sounds.

493
00:32:51,476 --> 00:32:53,039
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a really fantastic game.

494
00:32:53,619 --> 00:33:08,173
[SPEAKER_08]: so um really cool recommend checking it out but kind of disappointed the stages are so long because it does kind of make it hard to play on break um and then beyond that I think that's all I played this week yeah

495
00:33:08,733 --> 00:33:11,975
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the closest you'll get That's still pretty awesome

496
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:37,911
[SPEAKER_08]: And she's a pretty awesome artist.

497
00:33:37,951 --> 00:33:41,293
[SPEAKER_08]: She does anime drawings and stuff, so expect that.

498
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:46,697
[SPEAKER_02]: An OLR in joke will finally come to an end, although we all know it's not going to come to an end whatsoever.

499
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:51,481
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it will finally reach some resolution, yes.

500
00:33:51,501 --> 00:33:54,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you don't want to just win.

501
00:33:54,683 --> 00:33:55,464
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to win big.

502
00:33:56,624 --> 00:34:01,306
[SPEAKER_02]: We want Footies Kickstarter to do well.

503
00:34:01,366 --> 00:34:03,948
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's really about that.

504
00:34:04,508 --> 00:34:07,229
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really it.

505
00:34:07,249 --> 00:34:14,032
[SPEAKER_08]: They're doing okay, but I'm kind of worried that they may not hit their goal because they're just under $6,000 of $10,000.

506
00:34:14,092 --> 00:34:15,093
[SPEAKER_08]: They've got 11 days left.

507
00:34:17,974 --> 00:34:19,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes those last few days are the biggest.

508
00:34:20,235 --> 00:34:21,015
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they can do it.

509
00:34:21,075 --> 00:34:22,296
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it looks like a pretty cool game.

510
00:34:22,376 --> 00:34:23,656
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not asking for too much.

511
00:34:23,696 --> 00:34:26,357
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, if you want to check it out, it's Evilot.

512
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:28,518
[SPEAKER_08]: It's E-V-I-L-O-T.

513
00:34:29,218 --> 00:34:32,980
[SPEAKER_08]: And the game looks a little bit similar to Plants vs. Zombies.

514
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:38,482
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of Plants vs. Zombies with... What was that?

515
00:34:38,542 --> 00:34:40,223
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to remember the original name of the game.

516
00:34:40,263 --> 00:34:40,603
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like...

517
00:34:41,363 --> 00:34:45,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Batman, why... It was a game on PSP.

518
00:34:45,385 --> 00:34:47,586
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like where you play the villain, basically.

519
00:34:49,006 --> 00:34:49,767
[SPEAKER_08]: So it looks cool.

520
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:51,987
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

521
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,168
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be neat.

522
00:34:53,188 --> 00:34:54,629
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, my gaming week.

523
00:34:55,169 --> 00:35:01,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like DarkSakura, I played a lot of the same stuff that you're used to hearing me talk about, like World of Warcraft and was continuing to play...

524
00:35:03,212 --> 00:35:03,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Sound Shapes

525
00:35:27,514 --> 00:35:31,338
[SPEAKER_02]: But on Friday night and a little bit today, I got to sink some time into Guild Wars 2.

526
00:35:32,459 --> 00:35:33,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm up to about level 10.

527
00:35:35,382 --> 00:35:40,567
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure I've really had a full amount of time to really flesh out what I think about this game.

528
00:35:41,328 --> 00:35:48,716
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the things that were bugging me about it at first, I'm easing up on a little bit, and it all has to do with the Guild Wars 2 model.

529
00:35:49,176 --> 00:35:51,298
[SPEAKER_02]: You know the pricing model is a lot different for Guild Wars 2.

530
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:58,483
[SPEAKER_02]: You pay the one fee to get the game and then you never have to pay a monthly fee or anything again.

531
00:35:58,723 --> 00:35:59,783
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no monthly fee.

532
00:36:00,484 --> 00:36:03,566
[SPEAKER_02]: But now they're adding a little more of the free-to-play elements in it.

533
00:36:03,846 --> 00:36:10,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can go into the online shop and buy sunglasses for your character or dumb little things.

534
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:11,652
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are some...

535
00:36:12,412 --> 00:36:21,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Like basically steroids, performance enhancing things you can get like short time XP bonuses and things like that you can kind of get in the shop with real money.

536
00:36:23,397 --> 00:36:29,760
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that started to irritate me is that I got a chest that dropped and the key I needed to open it was something to buy in the store.

537
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:55,792
[SPEAKER_02]: and I was like oh that's bullshit that's such bullshit that you know I was gonna rage because I'm like that's a Facebook game but then finally I don't know if I got it as a quest reward I think I got it as a quest reward around level 10 I did get one of those keys so you it doesn't bug me nearly as much if you can get it in the game by doing a lot of grinding you know either you're gonna be free to play or you're gonna be uh you know not free to play um I still think Guild Wars 2 despite that

538
00:36:56,601 --> 00:36:57,622
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

539
00:37:13,652 --> 00:37:41,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't really feel like World of Warcraft And I think one big reason for that Is they've managed to figure out a new way to do quests There are no yellow exclamation marks over people's heads And it's not like the Final Fantasy XI style questing either Basically what happens is that You have this giant map And I gotta say There's a little thing I love about this game And that is when you go to the map The way the map appears is your camera actually pans down

540
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:49,406
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does a subtle transition to the actual map, but it makes it look like you're on Google Maps.

541
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:53,328
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's zooming out to show the map or whatever, and then it zooms back in to show your character.

542
00:37:53,848 --> 00:37:59,612
[SPEAKER_02]: The way it does that transition is one of those little things that really makes you go, that's so cool.

543
00:37:59,972 --> 00:38:03,715
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Shane found out you could draw on the map, like it's a Madden thing.

544
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:06,056
[SPEAKER_02]: You could draw the plays on the map or whatever.

545
00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:07,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, questing.

546
00:38:08,758 --> 00:38:24,005
[SPEAKER_02]: so you go on the map and you'll find these little scouts and the scouts will tell you these things so and so is in trouble and needs help this person is having to deal with this conflict going on right now and could use some help this person is near the cave and da da da so the scouts will tell you where these people are and then they draw the little hearts on your map

547
00:38:24,485 --> 00:38:44,692
[SPEAKER_02]: and you go over to the hearts and then when you're in that general area the game will tell you either kill these things collect these things you know kind of the general MMO stuff but you get to pick what you want to do do you want to kill do you want to collect what do you want to do and as you do those you start to gain it's like mini reputation grinds little mini reputation grinds they don't take you anymore in like 30 minutes

548
00:38:45,172 --> 00:38:56,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you do those little grinds, then the heart fills in and that person will start selling you gear and stuff and you've basically completed the quest and you get like gold and XP and the typical things.

549
00:38:57,237 --> 00:39:07,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Now generally in these areas as well, somebody could start an event quest and the event quest is like the public questing which a lot of MMOs besides WoW have in them.

550
00:39:07,982 --> 00:39:32,143
[SPEAKER_02]: and even WoW's getting it to some extent with the scenarios in Pandaria but like Warhammer was a game that did this very well was the whole public questing and I gotta say with the Guild Wars launch going on I mean it was crazy like in the starter area it would be like so-and-so needs help eradicating the mosquitoes from the village because you know it's like a level 2 quest or whatever and then suddenly like a big orange circle appears on your map and all these mosquitoes are everywhere and

551
00:39:32,483 --> 00:39:45,034
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like 75 people everywhere killing mosquitoes and you just watch the bar go and it like fills right up and then you get a medal based on your contribution and the medal gives you experience, gold, and karma points.

552
00:39:45,514 --> 00:39:48,016
[SPEAKER_02]: And karma points you turn around and use to buy gear.

553
00:39:48,536 --> 00:39:54,862
[SPEAKER_02]: So I gotta say, I love that they've really challenged themselves to think outside the box and not make

554
00:39:55,362 --> 00:40:09,134
[SPEAKER_02]: a clone of the successful formula but as MMO fans what do we think MMOs ought to offer and it really does feel like in that regard Guild Wars 2 is taking MMOs to the next level I really think that

555
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:15,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's giving a lot of... I think, you know, I don't want to turn it into a Guild Wars 2 versus WoW thing.

556
00:40:16,366 --> 00:40:17,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I love WoW.

557
00:40:17,127 --> 00:40:19,769
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say, oh, Guild Wars 2 is going to kick its ass, whatever.

558
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:25,034
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I totally disagree with people that are like, you know, oh, WoW's dead.

559
00:40:25,574 --> 00:40:26,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, WoW is so dead.

560
00:40:26,775 --> 00:40:30,779
[SPEAKER_02]: The panda people is stupid and it's a little kid and Guild Wars is going to kill it.

561
00:40:30,799 --> 00:40:33,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been saying every game's going to kill WoW.

562
00:40:33,441 --> 00:40:34,562
[SPEAKER_02]: WoW will continue to exist.

563
00:40:34,982 --> 00:40:37,985
[SPEAKER_02]: But I got to say, Guild Wars 2 just really brings...

564
00:40:38,525 --> 00:40:54,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Something else to the table with that And one other little thing about Guild Wars 2 that I love They brought Vista points into the game Which I remember from a racing game called Fuel From a couple years ago You remember that game Fuel?

565
00:40:54,413 --> 00:41:00,276
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember how there'd be places on the map you would drive to That it's just a really gorgeous view And you got points for that?

566
00:41:00,596 --> 00:41:05,599
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think Assassin's Creed does something like this too At least somebody was joking with me And I haven't played that series a lot

567
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:30,579
[SPEAKER_02]: but basically you go to these points on the map and you might have to interact with the environment a little like you'll have to find the little mushrooms you have to jump up to get to the top of the building and then once you get up there there'll be a little book and you press the button and all of a sudden you'll go to a cutscene where the camera will do this gorgeous pan and show you everything around you and then 60 XP for finding the vista point and it's marked on your map and I just I thought that was so awesome like it's something else to do that's not

568
00:41:31,775 --> 00:41:33,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Grinding Dungeon or whatever.

569
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,159
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just neat.

570
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,423
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot about Guild Wars 2 that's just different.

571
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:46,193
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds like they could have it like, you know, there's people that kind of challenge themselves to play like a pacifist that you could probably level up...

572
00:41:47,074 --> 00:41:48,455
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get enough XP.

573
00:41:48,615 --> 00:41:58,923
[SPEAKER_02]: However, yeah, the passive... Because you could go to these areas where they're like... Because to help all the people, you can collect kumquats or whatever and turn them in.

574
00:41:59,003 --> 00:42:01,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can collect things and turn them in, usually.

575
00:42:01,745 --> 00:42:04,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think a pacifist... And you get XP from gathering, too.

576
00:42:05,027 --> 00:42:08,449
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think a pacifist could do very well in Guild Wars 2, to be honest.

577
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:11,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I honestly haven't played the game enough.

578
00:42:11,732 --> 00:42:14,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't played it past level 10, so I can't give you a full, full review.

579
00:42:14,914 --> 00:42:15,194
[SPEAKER_02]: But I...

580
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:28,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Despite some of my minor bitches about what the traditional free-to-play mechanic is doing to the game, despite my minor bitches there, I really love some of the stuff they are trying to do.

581
00:42:29,078 --> 00:42:31,098
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple other quick things I want to say about Guild Wars 2.

582
00:42:31,138 --> 00:42:33,679
[SPEAKER_02]: We will move on with the show, but this is the new game.

583
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:36,340
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are going to be talking about this game, trust me.

584
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:38,701
[SPEAKER_02]: PVP

585
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,786
[SPEAKER_02]: But you get to have your same character.

586
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:09,072
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you design your character, you get to pick your favorite colors on the garb and all that stuff.

587
00:43:09,473 --> 00:43:15,039
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like you still have a sense of character, but it's like a completely separate copy of that character in PvP.

588
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,383
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you never want to touch PvP ever ever, you don't have to.

589
00:43:18,444 --> 00:43:19,405
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a separate little thing.

590
00:43:20,886 --> 00:43:46,799
[SPEAKER_02]: and character designs great because they kind of do a little bit of the Mass Effect thing with it where you pick like did your character in their vision see a snow leopard a stag or a you know and you make those types of decisions that ultimately affect your story like my I think my character saw a white stag and that has been a big part of the story I've been playing so far so they have definitely taken some Bioware it's the people designing this game clearly love the

591
00:43:47,279 --> 00:43:50,762
[SPEAKER_02]: All these different types of video games and have now made the video game they want to be playing.

592
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:55,426
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the most part, it's like 98% successful from what I've seen so far.

593
00:43:55,586 --> 00:43:58,248
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd play if I had the $60 to afford it.

594
00:43:58,569 --> 00:43:59,129
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the problem.

595
00:43:59,209 --> 00:44:00,430
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dropping the money up front.

596
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:01,311
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's an investment.

597
00:44:01,371 --> 00:44:04,654
[SPEAKER_05]: But... I mean, whereas, you know, I've already got WoW.

598
00:44:04,674 --> 00:44:06,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm already in the blood pact.

599
00:44:06,195 --> 00:44:06,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, sure.

600
00:44:07,336 --> 00:44:14,718
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's the other thing I like about Guild Wars, is that once you buy it, you know, if I don't go back to it ever, it'll be there six months now, 12 months from now.

601
00:44:15,878 --> 00:44:16,698
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds kind of cool.

602
00:44:16,918 --> 00:44:19,378
[SPEAKER_02]: One other thing I'll say about this, the guild system's pretty awesome.

603
00:44:19,959 --> 00:44:22,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and then I'm going to give you one more negative that ties into this.

604
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:24,079
[SPEAKER_02]: So the guild system's pretty awesome.

605
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:31,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you form your little guild, every little thing that you do during the day kind of contributes points to the guild's total, and you can use those points to buy perks.

606
00:44:32,401 --> 00:44:41,610
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like what they were going to do with World of Warcraft's guild leveling system, but they actually did it where the guild master can elect what guild perks you're going to build.

607
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:47,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want the guild to have an XP bonus or a money bonus or what is it that you want?

608
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:50,639
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can use the resources to build those, which is pretty cool.

609
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the place I'm going to knock it a little bit is that...

610
00:44:54,583 --> 00:44:55,663
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually a big one.

611
00:44:55,683 --> 00:44:57,884
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad I thought of this because I got to knock the game for this.

612
00:44:58,624 --> 00:45:00,084
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an issue.

613
00:45:01,245 --> 00:45:03,205
[SPEAKER_02]: They did this whole three-day launch thing, right?

614
00:45:03,585 --> 00:45:06,346
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of people that aren't really going to be in the game until Tuesday.

615
00:45:06,786 --> 00:45:08,447
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the servers are already full.

616
00:45:09,187 --> 00:45:13,408
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't get to pick one server for each character.

617
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:16,589
[SPEAKER_02]: You pick one server for all of your characters.

618
00:45:17,529 --> 00:45:34,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there's a system in the game where I guess you can have people from other servers, kind of like in a real ID kind of way, they can guest in your game, and you can still kind of party cross-server, and there is a lot you can do cross-server, but the one thing you can't do cross-server is guild.

619
00:45:35,353 --> 00:46:00,141
[SPEAKER_02]: the server I'm on filled up in like a day so if people want to try to get on that server it's full so what if I have friends like Jamie say who haven't bought the game yet and then they're going to try and get on my server it's going to be too bad it's full I kind of think that's bullshit that she can't join my guild because that filled up because all the early people hog the space they need to have a system where she can still get into that server

620
00:46:01,181 --> 00:46:08,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, to be fair, I understand that they are doing some type of open transfer for seven days.

621
00:46:08,649 --> 00:46:16,657
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to allow you to switch worlds however much you want for seven days so that people can kind of settle down and find a home and get off the populated servers and all that stuff.

622
00:46:17,218 --> 00:46:19,500
[SPEAKER_02]: However, they're going to charge for that later on.

623
00:46:20,201 --> 00:46:22,484
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still think it's kind of bullshit.

624
00:46:23,064 --> 00:46:44,358
[SPEAKER_02]: like there needs to be a way if I have a friend on the server remember how Final Fantasy 11 did the world passes I thought that was a good way to do it if the server's populated make it expensive to bring somebody on the server but still make it possible so that part sucks and needs to be rethought a little bit otherwise I'm really cool with Guild Wars 2

625
00:46:46,498 --> 00:46:48,999
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've talked 20 minutes about Guild Wars 2, but it's a big game.

626
00:46:49,399 --> 00:46:49,759
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

627
00:46:49,779 --> 00:46:51,440
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my gaming week, finally.

628
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:54,781
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about housekeeping.

629
00:46:55,201 --> 00:47:03,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter.com slash OLR, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, and I didn't really clear this with Loki before the show, but I don't think he's going to care.

630
00:47:03,683 --> 00:47:07,164
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not doing a show next week for Labor Day.

631
00:47:07,384 --> 00:47:12,305
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's because, again, DragonCon, PAX, you're all on vacation.

632
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:13,225
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

633
00:47:13,446 --> 00:47:14,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Just enjoy the long weekend.

634
00:47:14,946 --> 00:47:23,968
[SPEAKER_02]: We will try to have something special that does play live on the feed like a Best Of or an oldie moldie classic episode or something for those few of you that will still be there on Sunday night.

635
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:25,909
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

636
00:47:25,989 --> 00:47:30,170
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have an opportunity to go out and get a rest and vacation a little bit, enjoy it.

637
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:34,833
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that would also be, we have to remember, not every country is getting a three-day weekend.

638
00:47:34,853 --> 00:47:38,816
[SPEAKER_02]: That's mostly an America holiday, not really celebrated other places.

639
00:47:38,936 --> 00:47:45,842
[SPEAKER_02]: However, please understand, we do want to take the rare opportunity to go have a three-day weekend and take a road trip if we want, or what have you.

640
00:47:46,702 --> 00:47:49,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm toying with the idea of taking a little quick road trip for the weekend.

641
00:47:49,945 --> 00:47:50,265
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

642
00:47:50,786 --> 00:47:51,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would be fun.

643
00:47:52,307 --> 00:47:55,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, sitting on my big butt and playing video games all day long would be great, too.

644
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Civ V, Ubermatch, yeah.

645
00:47:57,915 --> 00:48:03,318
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think it's kind of weird that school is starting this week and then there's Labor Day.

646
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:08,361
[SPEAKER_05]: So like two days of magazine class and then no day of magazine class.

647
00:48:08,541 --> 00:48:09,942
[SPEAKER_02]: School year has been like that for forever.

648
00:48:11,463 --> 00:48:17,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's get into some gaming news and talk about what is going on in the gaming world.

649
00:48:17,107 --> 00:48:22,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I better cue the Debbie Downer horns because it doesn't start off pretty, does it, Loki?

650
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope, layoffs.

651
00:48:24,381 --> 00:48:25,882
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more and more layoffs.

652
00:48:26,082 --> 00:48:29,524
[SPEAKER_08]: So PopCap, they were hit with layoffs internationally.

653
00:48:30,264 --> 00:48:45,913
[SPEAKER_08]: And at least they kind of... The way they did it, at least they were talking about what happens in the industry and they tried to kind of make it... They didn't kind of hide it from the public, I guess.

654
00:48:48,034 --> 00:48:49,175
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically, they have...

655
00:48:50,916 --> 00:48:52,739
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

656
00:49:07,376 --> 00:49:14,037
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess they made a statement and I just think it's kind of interesting the way they did it.

657
00:49:14,778 --> 00:49:18,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, you know, 12 years ago we founded PopCap.

658
00:49:18,898 --> 00:49:26,440
[SPEAKER_08]: We never imagined the games we'd make, the vast number of people who'd play those games or the success that followed and so on and so forth.

659
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:35,502
[SPEAKER_08]: But this morning we informed our employees of a reorganization in our studios that will include a reduction in force in North America operations.

660
00:49:35,942 --> 00:49:36,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

661
00:49:53,559 --> 00:50:04,622
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking to our Dublin team about the future of that office and whether we can find a path to improve our profitability in Europe without having to close the operation.

662
00:50:04,662 --> 00:50:12,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Today's news is something you expect periodically from companies in a fast-changing industry, but it sucks if you're one of those people losing his or her jobs.

663
00:50:12,164 --> 00:50:14,725
[SPEAKER_08]: These people are our friends and we don't like doing this.

664
00:50:14,985 --> 00:50:17,106
[SPEAKER_08]: So at least they're being very personable about it.

665
00:50:19,407 --> 00:50:20,807
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's the way you do it right there.

666
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:27,684
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I think the other pink elephant in the room, and allow me to echo the- Pink elephant?

667
00:50:27,864 --> 00:50:29,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, pink elephant that stands out?

668
00:50:30,346 --> 00:50:32,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that when you just drink a lot, you see pink elephants?

669
00:50:33,189 --> 00:50:36,872
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I've always heard the pink elephant in the room is the obvious thing or whatever.

670
00:50:36,972 --> 00:50:38,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, you're derailing me.

671
00:50:38,653 --> 00:50:45,159
[SPEAKER_02]: The pink elephant in the room in this, and allow me to echo the rest of the internet in this, is I don't understand-

672
00:50:47,353 --> 00:50:48,254
[SPEAKER_02]: why PopCap?

673
00:50:49,676 --> 00:50:50,537
[SPEAKER_02]: why did this happen?

674
00:50:51,859 --> 00:50:53,381
[SPEAKER_02]: is PopCap struggling?

675
00:50:54,302 --> 00:51:05,496
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought out of all the gaming companies out there PopCap was doing a lot of things right and granted your whole memo and everything you're talking about there is an example of some of the things they do right

676
00:51:06,593 --> 00:51:10,898
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of us had a great fear when EA bought them, something like this would happen.

677
00:51:11,078 --> 00:51:14,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Here they go into why.

678
00:51:15,082 --> 00:51:20,708
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically a little context on why we're making cuts in some areas and why we're investing and expanding in others.

679
00:51:20,868 --> 00:51:25,132
[SPEAKER_08]: In past years, we've seen a dramatic change in the way people play and pay for games.

680
00:51:25,532 --> 00:51:28,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Free-to-play social mobile games have exploded in popularity.

681
00:51:28,936 --> 00:51:29,757
[SPEAKER_08]: That happened fast.

682
00:51:30,117 --> 00:51:41,615
[SPEAKER_08]: surprisingly so the change in consumer taste requires us to reorganize our business and invest in new types of games on new platforms it's a completely different world from where we started that's why

683
00:51:45,247 --> 00:52:05,568
[SPEAKER_02]: I still does not make sense still does not make sense and granted PopCap wasn't putting out a lot of games maybe unfortunately there was just too much that was in development that was costing them too much money like too much in development not enough out on the table but still like how fucking huge was Plants vs. Zombies bejeweled bejeweled

684
00:52:06,266 --> 00:52:09,227
[SPEAKER_02]: But Jeweled like changed the industry in some ways.

685
00:52:09,767 --> 00:52:12,389
[SPEAKER_02]: But Jeweled was like one of the first Facebook games.

686
00:52:12,889 --> 00:52:13,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Peggle.

687
00:52:13,469 --> 00:52:14,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Period.

688
00:52:14,229 --> 00:52:14,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Peggle.

689
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:16,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody knows what kind of crack Peggle is.

690
00:52:17,391 --> 00:52:18,431
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand.

691
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:23,013
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it when game companies, you know, as much as this pained me.

692
00:52:23,533 --> 00:52:52,822
[SPEAKER_02]: when Bizarre Creations closed I understood that Blur was not very well received and that the Geometry Wars games were kind of losing steam and all that and that they weren't doing the PGR games anymore I kind of saw the economics in that I don't get it here despite everything that they're saying there I can't help as a fan and somebody who thought this company was doing very well before EA bought them I can't help but think despite what they're saying despite all this something's up

693
00:52:53,402 --> 00:53:04,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, maybe because they are bought by EA and owned by EA that the investors thought, hey, there's too much overhead on this company and so we need to cut back in order to make it more profitable.

694
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:06,492
[SPEAKER_02]: So EA just jacked all the franchise.

695
00:53:06,532 --> 00:53:12,836
[SPEAKER_02]: The EA just snatched Bejeweled, snatched Plants vs. Zombies, and then that's it.

696
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:15,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, they're saying, though, that that's not the case.

697
00:53:15,939 --> 00:53:18,781
[SPEAKER_08]: They said if we didn't have EA behind us, the cuts would have been worse.

698
00:53:19,761 --> 00:53:21,783
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know.

699
00:53:23,365 --> 00:53:25,987
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't really know what to do until I saw a financial report.

700
00:53:27,268 --> 00:53:27,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly.

701
00:53:28,728 --> 00:53:29,609
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just weird.

702
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:37,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe because everything is free-to-play, like for example, Bejeweled Blitz and stuff like that on Facebook, that no one's actually buying the games anymore.

703
00:53:38,634 --> 00:53:39,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that's why.

704
00:53:40,655 --> 00:53:45,778
[SPEAKER_02]: You think there's not enough people buying those power-ups and the things that substantiate the free-to-play model?

705
00:53:47,947 --> 00:53:48,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe not.

706
00:53:48,608 --> 00:53:49,028
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

707
00:53:49,308 --> 00:54:00,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe because of PopCap's style of they've always been pretty good about not shoving that shit down your throat like Zynga games do that maybe, unfortunately, being nice isn't profitable.

708
00:54:01,865 --> 00:54:03,467
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that it was a lack of that.

709
00:54:03,507 --> 00:54:06,629
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that they had very innovative ways of getting the games out there.

710
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:14,915
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a special version of Peggle that teamed with Valve that came out.

711
00:54:16,997 --> 00:54:22,701
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a special Peggle that had Portal stuff in there and Team Fortress and everything, and it was free.

712
00:54:23,182 --> 00:54:27,285
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was a good, it's like, if you liked this, here's the full game, here's the whole thing.

713
00:54:28,546 --> 00:54:42,106
[SPEAKER_05]: The Plants vs. Zombies stuff in WoW The Peggle add-on Which I played a lot of the Peggle add-on And really wish it was still available I mean, they really did look into Getting it out there in different ways And I think that

714
00:54:44,152 --> 00:54:48,294
[SPEAKER_05]: If they had been able to keep that up, then maybe this wouldn't happen, but I'm not sure.

715
00:54:48,594 --> 00:54:51,536
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I really don't know what to say until I see a financial report.

716
00:54:51,996 --> 00:54:59,220
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Could it be that people are finally getting tired of playing casual games?

717
00:55:00,872 --> 00:55:01,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah.

718
00:55:01,913 --> 00:55:03,655
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, yeah, I, no.

719
00:55:04,536 --> 00:55:05,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing.

720
00:55:05,296 --> 00:55:09,060
[SPEAKER_02]: If you mean casual games to mean Facebook games, maybe.

721
00:55:10,321 --> 00:55:18,769
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what's gonna happen to Facebook games is what happened in the video game crash of 84, which is there's just so much shit

722
00:55:19,389 --> 00:55:20,590
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

723
00:55:47,026 --> 00:55:52,850
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's somebody that really gave the public what they wanted, it could all come tumbling down for Facebook pretty soon.

724
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:55,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on a social networking thing that doesn't have the stupid games on it.

725
00:55:56,612 --> 00:55:58,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I always liked the way Google Plus did it.

726
00:55:58,273 --> 00:56:00,274
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just another tab somewhere else.

727
00:56:00,294 --> 00:56:06,618
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, to be perfectly honest, I'm actually thinking about going back to using Google Plus because of just how ridiculous Facebook has gotten.

728
00:56:07,498 --> 00:56:08,479
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't play the games.

729
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:11,381
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of people that are worried about system security.

730
00:56:11,561 --> 00:56:15,383
[SPEAKER_05]: So they, like I have done, have blocked every single game request that's come through.

731
00:56:15,543 --> 00:56:17,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is the thing that pisses me off about Facebook.

732
00:56:18,004 --> 00:56:19,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally pisses me off.

733
00:56:19,624 --> 00:56:25,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how many times I have turned off location statuses on my post.

734
00:56:25,226 --> 00:56:28,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want all my posts posting where my location is.

735
00:56:29,347 --> 00:56:34,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I use an app called Foursquare when I specifically want to disclose that.

736
00:56:35,249 --> 00:56:36,350
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate being tagged.

737
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:36,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't...

738
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:39,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Check into my house and all that stuff.

739
00:56:39,552 --> 00:56:40,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do that.

740
00:56:40,794 --> 00:56:46,959
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want my post to be tagged with my work address or my home or whatever it is.

741
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:50,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet that shit keeps turning itself back on.

742
00:56:50,183 --> 00:56:53,306
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had to do it on a Facebook post I made an hour before the show.

743
00:56:53,846 --> 00:56:54,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

744
00:57:09,309 --> 00:57:10,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I like this picture.

745
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:11,852
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, I don't care if you like that picture.

746
00:57:11,892 --> 00:57:13,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Or I'm commenting on someone.

747
00:57:13,073 --> 00:57:13,974
[SPEAKER_05]: And it pops back up a second later?

748
00:57:13,994 --> 00:57:14,815
[SPEAKER_08]: And it keeps popping back.

749
00:57:14,895 --> 00:57:16,256
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it keeps popping back up.

750
00:57:16,276 --> 00:57:16,857
[SPEAKER_08]: You click it.

751
00:57:17,438 --> 00:57:18,759
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to unsubscribe from it.

752
00:57:18,879 --> 00:57:20,241
[SPEAKER_08]: And it will hide that post.

753
00:57:20,781 --> 00:57:21,762
[SPEAKER_08]: But it will still be there.

754
00:57:21,802 --> 00:57:23,104
[SPEAKER_08]: And it will still keep coming back.

755
00:57:23,244 --> 00:57:24,505
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's no way to get rid of it.

756
00:57:24,525 --> 00:57:25,026
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to stop.

757
00:57:25,586 --> 00:57:32,033
[SPEAKER_08]: For people that keep having that stuff pop up, and I'm just tired of seeing their posts, I actually have to unsubscribe from them.

758
00:57:32,053 --> 00:57:32,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

759
00:57:32,193 --> 00:57:34,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do we keep using Facebook?

760
00:57:34,455 --> 00:57:38,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sitting here bitching yet I'll still use it to make some stupid post this evening.

761
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:38,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

762
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I need instant gratification.

763
00:57:41,623 --> 00:57:42,504
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even that.

764
00:57:43,024 --> 00:57:43,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do we need that?

765
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:45,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do we need that right now in our society?

766
00:57:46,528 --> 00:57:47,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do we need it?

767
00:57:47,469 --> 00:57:51,631
[SPEAKER_05]: The only reason that I stick, I keep up with Facebook is just to piss off my mother.

768
00:57:52,471 --> 00:57:55,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, to keep up with my friends and family in Alabama.

769
00:57:56,353 --> 00:58:00,535
[SPEAKER_05]: To keep up with, you know, my friends in other countries.

770
00:58:00,555 --> 00:58:02,656
[SPEAKER_05]: To keep up with my friends across America.

771
00:58:02,696 --> 00:58:07,979
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, because only like three people anymore still use AIM, which I still use to keep up with people.

772
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:15,083
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I've found old friends that I used to chat with back when I had AOL for real, you know, back in the day.

773
00:58:15,143 --> 00:58:19,546
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my friends just found me through DeviantArt, and we're on Facebook now.

774
00:58:19,907 --> 00:58:31,254
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, I use it to keep up with people, but other than that, I mean, like, I get so irritated that people just use it for a sympathy grab, you know what I mean?

775
00:58:31,634 --> 00:58:34,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, hi, look where I am and you're not.

776
00:58:34,396 --> 00:58:35,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care where you are.

777
00:58:36,117 --> 00:58:37,418
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need to know when you go to bed.

778
00:58:38,839 --> 00:58:51,502
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's just this whole... I think it really is a modern phenomenon that everyone wants a little bit of... I hate to use it in this respect, but everyone wants their own little piece of celebrity, you know what I mean?

779
00:58:52,203 --> 00:58:54,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Where they want people to care about what they're doing.

780
00:58:54,203 --> 00:58:56,584
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that whole Andy Warhol thing, the 15 minutes of fame.

781
00:58:56,624 --> 00:58:57,944
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all of that coming to light.

782
00:58:58,304 --> 00:59:00,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Andy Warhol predicted things better than the Mayans.

783
00:59:02,236 --> 00:59:05,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, he was a fairly interesting person.

784
00:59:05,844 --> 00:59:06,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, he was.

785
00:59:06,546 --> 00:59:07,768
[SPEAKER_05]: He was an OCD collector.

786
00:59:07,909 --> 00:59:08,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

787
00:59:08,951 --> 00:59:10,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, my teacher got to meet him.

788
00:59:10,815 --> 00:59:12,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did he do a painting of soup cans?

789
00:59:13,594 --> 00:59:14,554
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my teachers got to meet him.

790
00:59:14,675 --> 00:59:14,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah?

791
00:59:15,095 --> 00:59:16,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, back then.

792
00:59:16,655 --> 00:59:18,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, how did we get from PopCap to this?

793
00:59:18,776 --> 00:59:19,096
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

794
00:59:19,116 --> 00:59:20,236
[SPEAKER_02]: You're the one who changed it to Andy Warhol.

795
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:22,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I find this, I do find this topic fascinating.

796
00:59:22,937 --> 00:59:24,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me read some chat comments real quick.

797
00:59:24,798 --> 00:59:27,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Those participating with the show at live.vognetwork.com.

798
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:34,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Locopoco says, I use it, talking about Facebook, because all my family and friends use it and that's all I can use to keep up with them.

799
00:59:35,041 --> 00:59:35,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

800
00:59:35,903 --> 00:59:39,612
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not saying that at you because I bet everybody would answer the question the same way.

801
00:59:39,672 --> 00:59:41,115
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm even asking myself this.

802
00:59:41,476 --> 00:59:43,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not just pick up the phone and call somebody?

803
00:59:44,803 --> 01:00:12,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I call my mother text message then I'm okay with that I have nothing to talk to them about that's why I post like things on there not like hey I did this today it's like hey look at this cool movie trailer exactly frisbee in our chat room why does Facebook have to be the only way to keep in touch with people and lately all I do it now is just for you know reblogging political shit and you know it helps me with the kitten you know

804
01:00:15,563 --> 01:00:18,004
[SPEAKER_02]: He gotta love DJ Morpheus from Understation Live.

805
01:00:18,345 --> 01:00:19,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Just made a Facebook post.

806
01:00:19,766 --> 01:00:21,887
[SPEAKER_02]: I was told to reload Facebook, so that's why I did it.

807
01:00:22,007 --> 01:00:23,868
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I hate being tagged in a location.

808
01:00:23,888 --> 01:00:24,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you were tagged.

809
01:00:24,929 --> 01:00:26,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie hates to be tagged, so I'm tagging.

810
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:28,851
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't mind being tagged in a picture.

811
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:30,132
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate location tags.

812
01:00:30,952 --> 01:00:33,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I don't like being tagged in pictures sometimes.

813
01:00:34,035 --> 01:00:38,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Not necessarily pictures, but the ones that are like, here's a calendar of all these birthdays.

814
01:00:38,178 --> 01:00:39,579
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to tag everybody.

815
01:00:39,919 --> 01:00:42,841
[SPEAKER_05]: For the record, I can't hide that, Travis, just saying.

816
01:00:43,382 --> 01:00:52,229
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate the picture tagging too, but at the same time, earlier today, Clover Nikon, one of our listeners, made this awesome 3D VOG art rendering.

817
01:00:52,269 --> 01:00:55,471
[SPEAKER_02]: He tagged me in that, and I was okay with that.

818
01:00:55,571 --> 01:00:57,353
[SPEAKER_02]: At least that's relevant to my interest.

819
01:00:57,693 --> 01:01:00,355
[SPEAKER_02]: I may not be in that picture, but it's a VOG picture, and I want to see it.

820
01:01:01,536 --> 01:01:04,098
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't give a crap about that.

821
01:01:04,158 --> 01:01:05,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate location posts.

822
01:01:06,019 --> 01:01:08,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to make a resolution.

823
01:01:10,342 --> 01:01:13,745
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been talking a lot about Labor Day and what we want to do over the Labor Day weekend.

824
01:01:14,305 --> 01:01:20,189
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am going to resolve to not touch social networking Labor Day weekend.

825
01:01:20,329 --> 01:01:22,291
[SPEAKER_02]: No Facebook, no Google+, no Twitter.

826
01:01:23,167 --> 01:01:24,348
[SPEAKER_05]: You know where I live these days?

827
01:01:24,909 --> 01:01:25,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Tumblr.

828
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:26,871
[SPEAKER_02]: None of that either.

829
01:01:27,071 --> 01:01:27,692
[SPEAKER_02]: None of that for me.

830
01:01:27,712 --> 01:01:28,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, have fun.

831
01:01:28,252 --> 01:01:29,313
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be on Tumblr.

832
01:01:30,514 --> 01:01:31,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Why won't you do it?

833
01:01:31,715 --> 01:01:32,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I love Tumblr.

834
01:01:32,796 --> 01:01:33,657
[SPEAKER_05]: I can give up Facebook.

835
01:01:33,677 --> 01:01:34,278
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't give a crap.

836
01:01:34,298 --> 01:01:39,002
[SPEAKER_05]: But I love Tumblr because I actually get news articles on Tumblr.

837
01:01:39,102 --> 01:01:42,946
[SPEAKER_05]: I use Tumblr as my blog for my fitness thing.

838
01:01:42,986 --> 01:01:46,829
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, if anyone wants to follow my fitness blog, it's called Dieting Can Bite Me.

839
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:48,070
[SPEAKER_05]: All one word.

840
01:01:49,131 --> 01:01:49,532
[SPEAKER_05]: at Tumblr.

841
01:01:50,233 --> 01:01:54,157
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, I use that for, I use it for art blogging.

842
01:01:54,758 --> 01:01:58,422
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually use that for real blogging stuff and for getting my thoughts out there.

843
01:01:58,442 --> 01:02:01,205
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sort of my live journal replacement for right now.

844
01:02:01,883 --> 01:02:09,768
[SPEAKER_02]: AlanAlchemy in our chatroom says, Well, the issue with Facebook is that it managed to get everyone's 55-year-old aunts and shit on it, which really is unprecedented.

845
01:02:09,828 --> 01:02:13,970
[SPEAKER_02]: And that audience does not give a shit about moving on to the next great thing like the rest of it.

846
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:16,171
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a good point.

847
01:02:16,832 --> 01:02:18,813
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one reason why Facebook took off is that it got...

848
01:02:19,113 --> 01:02:19,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody on it.

849
01:02:20,114 --> 01:02:23,696
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's ads, ads, ads, ads.

850
01:02:24,777 --> 01:02:25,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Alan, Alchemy continues.

851
01:02:25,878 --> 01:02:32,742
[SPEAKER_02]: So the problem is that if you're in the same situation of keeping track of your family, re-Facebook, there is no reason to ever believe they'll move on to something else.

852
01:02:33,022 --> 01:02:37,645
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if you move on to the next thing, you'll have to keep your Facebook, so it's always going to be a little bit relevant.

853
01:02:37,866 --> 01:02:39,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Then let's move off.

854
01:02:39,987 --> 01:02:40,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go back to LiveJournal.

855
01:02:41,388 --> 01:02:44,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's some selected likes that they want me to like.

856
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:48,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Wreck-It Ralph, Cuddling, Five Finger Death Punch, and Act of Valor.

857
01:02:49,554 --> 01:02:49,734
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

858
01:02:49,894 --> 01:02:52,256
[SPEAKER_02]: All that liking stuff is is marketing stuff.

859
01:02:52,316 --> 01:02:52,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

860
01:02:53,137 --> 01:02:57,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had to go back and unlike things because I realize it's ironic.

861
01:02:57,461 --> 01:03:13,156
[SPEAKER_02]: We tell you to go like Orange Lounge Radio and VOG Network, but guys, that's the double-edged sword about Facebook is that it's still a great way to promote my shit when I don't have the million dollars to spend on magazine ads and TV ads and the other stuff the big boys get to do.

862
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:15,558
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yes, I do realize it's ironic.

863
01:03:15,598 --> 01:03:24,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Here I am bitching about Facebook, yet I say go like Orange Launch Radio on Facebook because it still is a good way to remind you guys the show is here and to listen and all that stuff.

864
01:03:26,206 --> 01:03:28,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm going to stick to it.

865
01:03:28,168 --> 01:03:31,771
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to make my actions match my words.

866
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:35,594
[SPEAKER_02]: I am stepping off Facebook for one weekend.

867
01:03:35,654 --> 01:03:36,735
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even that big of a deal.

868
01:03:36,935 --> 01:03:37,575
[SPEAKER_02]: One weekend.

869
01:03:38,576 --> 01:03:40,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Is anybody out there going to try it too?

870
01:03:40,278 --> 01:03:41,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just going to be me?

871
01:03:41,799 --> 01:03:43,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you really all that attached?

872
01:03:45,959 --> 01:03:46,779
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we'll find out

873
01:04:08,067 --> 01:04:08,907
[SPEAKER_02]: in Sacramento.

874
01:04:08,947 --> 01:04:10,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's fine.

875
01:04:10,028 --> 01:04:11,549
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't like it when he gives my address.

876
01:04:11,669 --> 01:04:12,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving on.

877
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:14,870
[SPEAKER_02]: More bad news.

878
01:04:16,091 --> 01:04:18,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I don't want people to know when I'm having lunch at Wiener Works.

879
01:04:23,974 --> 01:04:25,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Only when I'm having dessert.

880
01:04:26,555 --> 01:04:28,036
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I got rid of Foursquare.

881
01:04:28,076 --> 01:04:29,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't give a shit anymore.

882
01:04:30,310 --> 01:04:51,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care if people know where I am I don't necessarily want people to know where I am and I don't care where you are I swear this is the last thing on social networking the reason why I like Foursquare is I actually like the search function to see what restaurants my friends have been to and if they left tips if they enjoyed it or not I have found it to be way more useful than Yelp in that regard I usually just ask people

883
01:04:52,297 --> 01:04:53,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Yelp Reviews

884
01:05:14,601 --> 01:05:16,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Tex Wasabi's.

885
01:05:16,402 --> 01:05:19,764
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that one guy from Food Network's restaurant.

886
01:05:19,804 --> 01:05:20,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Guy Fieri.

887
01:05:20,444 --> 01:05:20,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you.

888
01:05:21,184 --> 01:05:22,885
[SPEAKER_02]: That guy with the horrible hair.

889
01:05:23,025 --> 01:05:23,826
[SPEAKER_02]: It's his restaurant.

890
01:05:23,846 --> 01:05:24,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been there.

891
01:05:24,526 --> 01:05:26,487
[SPEAKER_02]: And I loved it, actually.

892
01:05:26,587 --> 01:05:26,987
[SPEAKER_02]: I went there.

893
01:05:27,007 --> 01:05:28,708
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was really... I fucking loved it.

894
01:05:28,728 --> 01:05:30,489
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard it was really expensive.

895
01:05:31,189 --> 01:05:32,010
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit pricey.

896
01:05:32,050 --> 01:05:33,750
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like Ruth Chris expensive.

897
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:36,391
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Red Lobster prices.

898
01:05:37,212 --> 01:05:38,392
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not so bad.

899
01:05:38,692 --> 01:05:40,693
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sushi and barbecue.

900
01:05:42,854 --> 01:05:44,475
[SPEAKER_02]: You think it's the weirdest thing in the world?

901
01:05:44,535 --> 01:05:46,556
[SPEAKER_02]: I shit you not, it's fucking amazing.

902
01:05:46,576 --> 01:05:52,198
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to go to Johnny Garlic's, but there's none around here, I don't think.

903
01:05:52,298 --> 01:05:53,039
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's one in Roseville.

904
01:05:53,059 --> 01:05:53,939
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you talking about?

905
01:05:54,359 --> 01:05:55,680
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not around here.

906
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:56,180
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

907
01:05:58,021 --> 01:05:58,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

908
01:06:00,403 --> 01:06:01,343
[SPEAKER_02]: This is more bad news.

909
01:06:03,545 --> 01:06:04,365
[SPEAKER_02]: This just sucks.

910
01:06:04,625 --> 01:06:05,886
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what else to say about this.

911
01:06:06,326 --> 01:06:08,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony Liverpool has been closed.

912
01:06:08,908 --> 01:06:11,550
[SPEAKER_02]: You know them because they brought you Wipeout 2048.

913
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:16,033
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're like me, you remember this studio when they were called Psygnosis.

914
01:06:16,886 --> 01:06:17,826
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember Psygnosis?

915
01:06:18,127 --> 01:06:18,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Lemmings.

916
01:06:18,647 --> 01:06:19,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Lemmings.

917
01:06:20,027 --> 01:06:26,831
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that game was like PC gaming's golden child for years and years.

918
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:28,611
[SPEAKER_02]: They became Sony Liverpool.

919
01:06:28,892 --> 01:06:31,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Shadow of the Beast was another game they made, and of course the Wipeout games.

920
01:06:33,153 --> 01:06:33,794
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened?

921
01:06:35,274 --> 01:06:38,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess Wipeout on the Vita didn't live up to expectations.

922
01:06:38,216 --> 01:06:39,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that's Wipeout's fault.

923
01:06:39,977 --> 01:06:42,658
[SPEAKER_02]: That was probably one of the better games to get on the Vita.

924
01:06:44,758 --> 01:06:54,408
[SPEAKER_02]: This is another one I'm looking at going, is it just because Wipeout isn't making waves the way that LittleBigPlanet is?

925
01:06:54,428 --> 01:06:55,289
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know.

926
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:58,332
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, Psygnosis has put out some good shit over the years.

927
01:06:59,293 --> 01:06:59,974
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just weird.

928
01:07:03,157 --> 01:07:04,038
[SPEAKER_02]: What else can I say?

929
01:07:05,031 --> 01:07:05,671
[SPEAKER_08]: That sucks!

930
01:07:05,971 --> 01:07:15,216
[SPEAKER_08]: A little known fact about Psygnosis, they received top billing for creating the face-off games featured in Nickelodeon's 1992 television show, Nick Arcade.

931
01:07:15,736 --> 01:07:18,238
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, they created the face-off games in Nick Arcade.

932
01:07:18,298 --> 01:07:19,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Get the fuck out.

933
01:07:19,218 --> 01:07:19,778
[SPEAKER_08]: That was them?

934
01:07:20,199 --> 01:07:23,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Post Haste, Jet Jocks, and Battle of the Bands.

935
01:07:28,423 --> 01:07:34,746
[SPEAKER_02]: The 12-year-old boy in me who is playing Lemmings on his 486 PC is having a cry right now.

936
01:07:37,603 --> 01:07:58,145
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't get it poor Rob poor me poor all of us we all lose with this news this week the only thing we can hope these guys form new stuff you know see this would have been another game that would have been good from them that they could have remade and it would have been really sweet Colony Wars was another game that they worked on when they were at Sony

937
01:07:59,082 --> 01:08:00,823
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear all this is just putting me in a bad mood.

938
01:08:01,403 --> 01:08:01,864
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

939
01:08:02,664 --> 01:08:06,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I hope they can rise up and start something new.

940
01:08:06,707 --> 01:08:09,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I remember PopCap had that iOS studio.

941
01:08:09,548 --> 01:08:11,029
[SPEAKER_05]: No one's gonna do anything new.

942
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:13,971
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no money in anything new.

943
01:08:14,491 --> 01:08:18,733
[SPEAKER_05]: People want the same recycled crap and companies don't like to take risks.

944
01:08:19,054 --> 01:08:19,654
[SPEAKER_05]: End of story.

945
01:08:19,774 --> 01:08:28,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you find it a bit ironic that one of the launch games for this whole Sony mobile thing or whatever their platform is Lemmings?

946
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:31,681
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just salt in the wound right there.

947
01:08:32,102 --> 01:08:35,725
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, well, but that's just because what's new hasn't been thought of yet.

948
01:08:36,386 --> 01:08:38,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook at one time didn't exist.

949
01:08:38,267 --> 01:08:38,788
[SPEAKER_02]: It was new.

950
01:08:38,968 --> 01:08:41,770
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was still based off of a pre-existing concept.

951
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:44,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Social networking is not new.

952
01:08:44,352 --> 01:08:48,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, video games aren't new, but there's still lots of ideas that haven't been discovered yet.

953
01:08:48,176 --> 01:08:49,957
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we had pen pals back in the day.

954
01:08:51,158 --> 01:08:53,801
[SPEAKER_05]: This is updated pen palling, pretty much.

955
01:08:54,601 --> 01:08:54,862
[SPEAKER_05]: You know...

956
01:08:55,582 --> 01:09:01,945
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, concepts can evolve, but I really don't think that there's much new to be had anymore.

957
01:09:02,586 --> 01:09:04,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone copies everybody these days.

958
01:09:04,927 --> 01:09:09,189
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's, with all due respect, I think that's just a jaded perspective on where our industry's at.

959
01:09:09,229 --> 01:09:11,130
[SPEAKER_02]: We feel that way because that's all we're getting.

960
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:12,531
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting sequels.

961
01:09:12,591 --> 01:09:14,312
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting all this same old shit.

962
01:09:14,352 --> 01:09:16,553
[SPEAKER_05]: The people that are doing new things are being ignored.

963
01:09:17,713 --> 01:09:19,714
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree, that sucks.

964
01:09:20,194 --> 01:09:21,874
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to pay attention to the good ideas.

965
01:09:21,894 --> 01:09:26,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's why, and I've told a couple people this, I'm actually going to be writing a book and I'm going to self-publish.

966
01:09:27,696 --> 01:09:35,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you notice that all the books, and I hate to use these as examples because they really are just awful fan fiction, but like that Fifty Shades of Shit.

967
01:09:36,878 --> 01:09:40,239
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some pretty bad writing that gets published and people eat it up.

968
01:09:40,499 --> 01:09:43,200
[SPEAKER_05]: But the thing is, is that that's someone who...

969
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:54,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of these other books that came out that have been rejected by major publishers, they've self-published and have since turned into pretty big money-making schemes.

970
01:09:54,543 --> 01:10:00,965
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a girl that writes episodic vampire stories on Facebook for 99 cents a copy, and she's a millionaire now.

971
01:10:01,585 --> 01:10:06,186
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, a million bucks isn't that much anymore, relatively, as it used to be.

972
01:10:06,747 --> 01:10:07,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't mind having that.

973
01:10:08,007 --> 01:10:20,316
[SPEAKER_05]: But a college student, you know, putting up her own little stories on Amazon Selling them, you know, at, I think she'd get like a 10% profit off of it Or some really small margin of profit Yeah, but what's the trick?

974
01:10:20,356 --> 01:10:21,537
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you make people pay for it?

975
01:10:21,577 --> 01:10:27,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if we charge 99 cents an episode of Orange Lounge Radio Let's not kid ourselves

976
01:10:28,222 --> 01:10:33,026
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing that I'm saying is that I think that's why the Kickstarter thing is actually really taking off.

977
01:10:34,087 --> 01:10:37,089
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to do back with that self-publishing, self-actualizing.

978
01:10:37,449 --> 01:10:43,775
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to the people instead of using some formula that companies think works.

979
01:10:44,755 --> 01:10:47,998
[SPEAKER_05]: They're putting, say, hey, show me you're interested with your money.

980
01:10:48,959 --> 01:10:52,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Except 5% of it won't actually go to the idea at all.

981
01:10:52,742 --> 01:10:54,063
[SPEAKER_05]: But the Kickstarter idea is new.

982
01:10:55,343 --> 01:10:56,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Relatively new.

983
01:10:56,744 --> 01:11:00,306
[SPEAKER_05]: And they've made a business off of it, so that's something there.

984
01:11:01,267 --> 01:11:13,213
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically, I think, a lot of people taking their own ideas into their own hands, not letting someone else corrupt their idea, and seeing how far they can make it go based on the will of the people.

985
01:11:16,073 --> 01:11:16,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck this game.

986
01:11:16,754 --> 01:11:17,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck this game.

987
01:11:27,358 --> 01:11:30,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy XIV is being pulled off the shelves.

988
01:11:31,219 --> 01:11:32,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Aw, no more Final Fantasy XIV.

989
01:11:33,459 --> 01:11:36,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Squeenix said, take it off your shelves.

990
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:36,520
[SPEAKER_05]: You know why?

991
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:40,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they don't want it to get in the way of a Realm Reborn.

992
01:11:42,802 --> 01:11:55,945
[SPEAKER_05]: They're basically saying that those who are registering their copy of Final Fantasy XIV will have full access to a 30-day free trial period prior to the servers shutting down in preparation for the alpha and beta tests of a Realm Reborn.

993
01:11:56,565 --> 01:12:11,453
[SPEAKER_08]: so they're wanting to just to not have those old copies go out there anymore they want people to to focus on the new what happens if they don't like use those free like if like I bought the game and I knew that they're gonna shut the servers down and

994
01:12:11,789 --> 01:12:13,411
[SPEAKER_02]: The servers aren't shutting down.

995
01:12:13,751 --> 01:12:15,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be confused.

996
01:12:15,693 --> 01:12:16,854
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just pulling it off shelves.

997
01:12:17,334 --> 01:12:18,635
[SPEAKER_05]: They're shutting down the servers.

998
01:12:19,676 --> 01:12:19,916
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

999
01:12:20,857 --> 01:12:21,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I had not heard that.

1000
01:12:22,859 --> 01:12:24,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly what I read off here from their thing.

1001
01:12:25,301 --> 01:12:29,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Prior to the servers shutting down to prepare for the alpha and beta tests.

1002
01:12:30,226 --> 01:12:31,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shit.

1003
01:12:32,008 --> 01:12:33,589
[SPEAKER_08]: So, like, why would I want to, you know,

1004
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:35,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1005
01:12:35,654 --> 01:12:39,698
[SPEAKER_08]: If I had 30 days, wouldn't I want to save that for when it starts?

1006
01:12:39,758 --> 01:12:41,740
[SPEAKER_02]: When I originally saw this, that update wasn't there.

1007
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:42,340
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why.

1008
01:12:43,241 --> 01:12:43,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1009
01:12:44,974 --> 01:12:53,501
[SPEAKER_05]: In anticipation of the upcoming Alpha and Beta test for Final Fantasy XIV or Realm Reborn, Square Enix, in coordination with our retail partners, has decided to discontinue sales of the current version of Final Fantasy XIV.

1010
01:13:09,153 --> 01:13:09,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1011
01:13:25,191 --> 01:13:25,812
[SPEAKER_02]: That's real.

1012
01:13:26,112 --> 01:13:29,895
[SPEAKER_02]: See, in my mind, I was like, oh, they'll do kind of like what World of Warcraft does.

1013
01:13:29,915 --> 01:13:32,657
[SPEAKER_02]: You have your test servers that run one copy of the game.

1014
01:13:33,277 --> 01:13:45,227
[SPEAKER_02]: That's archaic and dumb, but I mean, not that anybody's really gonna... There'll be hundreds of people that weep over Final Fantasy XIV servers being shut down, but I mean... When it vanishes, though, it is a clean break from the old.

1015
01:13:45,734 --> 01:13:49,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's unprecedented.

1016
01:13:50,336 --> 01:13:54,317
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's going to kick him in the ass.

1017
01:13:54,417 --> 01:14:06,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Square is literally trying to erase your memory of that game so that when Realm Reborn comes out, it's treated like a brand new game, a brand new launch, like the old one didn't ever happen.

1018
01:14:06,881 --> 01:14:10,282
[SPEAKER_02]: That's crazy.

1019
01:14:11,742 --> 01:14:13,563
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that it's going to come back to kick him, though.

1020
01:14:15,003 --> 01:14:17,451
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's going to come back and I think it's really going to hurt him.

1021
01:14:20,953 --> 01:14:21,434
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1022
01:14:21,554 --> 01:14:22,414
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give it this.

1023
01:14:23,175 --> 01:14:26,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XIV sucked.

1024
01:14:26,257 --> 01:14:28,178
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried it two or three times.

1025
01:14:28,359 --> 01:14:29,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I really tried to like it.

1026
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:31,401
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not a good MMO.

1027
01:14:32,381 --> 01:14:34,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Harry Monkey Balls is what sucked.

1028
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:45,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Having played WoW, having played Guild Wars, having played Knights of the Old Republic, having played just about everything that's come to the table, Final Fantasy XIV sucked.

1029
01:14:46,992 --> 01:14:47,133
[SPEAKER_02]: I just...

1030
01:14:53,714 --> 01:14:57,257
[SPEAKER_05]: And Eleven made me cry with frustration and everything I saw made me like it better.

1031
01:14:57,798 --> 01:15:03,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, but I don't think it's necessarily going to... I applaud them for taking risks.

1032
01:15:04,604 --> 01:15:06,886
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it will necessarily be a failure.

1033
01:15:07,426 --> 01:15:15,994
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think if you're hedging your bets on sales of the console version of the game, that's dangerous because console MMOs haven't been super, super well done.

1034
01:15:16,154 --> 01:15:18,976
[SPEAKER_02]: So... With the exception of Final Fantasy XI.

1035
01:15:19,016 --> 01:15:19,076
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1036
01:15:20,597 --> 01:15:25,740
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope they also consider the relaunch on the PC as well.

1037
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:28,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Fascinating.

1038
01:15:28,401 --> 01:15:32,143
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the more crap they do with this, the less I'm interested in it.

1039
01:15:32,243 --> 01:15:32,883
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not worth it.

1040
01:15:32,923 --> 01:15:34,064
[SPEAKER_05]: There's bigger and better out there.

1041
01:15:34,084 --> 01:15:36,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's move on with some more news.

1042
01:15:38,837 --> 01:15:54,162
[SPEAKER_08]: EA is hoping to avoid a whole... It's kind of funny that they're actually acknowledging it now, but they're trying to put a lot of resources in preventing another FIFA hack going on with FIFA 13.

1043
01:15:54,622 --> 01:15:58,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, they made a lot of money off the Ultimate Team DLC.

1044
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:00,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1045
01:16:15,974 --> 01:16:17,794
[SPEAKER_08]: They said we've learned a lot from the experience.

1046
01:16:17,834 --> 01:16:20,135
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of companies are suffering from this right now.

1047
01:16:20,215 --> 01:16:23,957
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of sophisticated hacking happening in the gaming industry.

1048
01:16:24,837 --> 01:16:27,379
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a continuous battle.

1049
01:16:27,719 --> 01:16:31,861
[SPEAKER_08]: We take it very seriously and we put a lot of resources on it.

1050
01:16:32,061 --> 01:16:36,323
[SPEAKER_08]: We're learning from the FIFA example last year and it's been incorporated into this year.

1051
01:16:36,443 --> 01:16:38,323
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some incremental and additional things.

1052
01:16:38,383 --> 01:16:42,285
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to get too detailed because I don't want to tip our hand.

1053
01:16:42,465 --> 01:16:44,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Rest assured we'll take it very seriously.

1054
01:16:45,615 --> 01:16:53,380
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, I still don't see how that's going to happen considering that you're selling the same stuff on Madden now and you're still doing the FIFA thing.

1055
01:16:53,981 --> 01:17:05,288
[SPEAKER_08]: So as long as you keep making it profitable for people to steal those accounts and actually be able to sell stuff for real money, then people are going to keep hacking those accounts to try to make money off of them.

1056
01:17:05,628 --> 01:17:14,995
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this whole thing gets a nice hearty kiss my ass from EA because, I mean, granted, okay, it's nice that you're like acknowledging something's going on now.

1057
01:17:16,215 --> 01:17:25,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that you're trying to sell the new copy of your game, screw you for not having said that this was a problem before.

1058
01:17:26,002 --> 01:17:33,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're just casually saying, oh yes, we've learned from the past, but the new one's going to be bigger and better.

1059
01:17:34,047 --> 01:17:35,027
[SPEAKER_02]: You are using...

1060
01:17:35,968 --> 01:17:40,711
[SPEAKER_02]: People who had their money stolen as an excuse to plug your new game.

1061
01:17:40,791 --> 01:17:42,211
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it feels like to me, honestly.

1062
01:17:42,311 --> 01:17:44,473
[SPEAKER_02]: As somebody who was FIFA hacked for all this.

1063
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:48,655
[SPEAKER_02]: So did they learn by adding... Some people frown on the use of the term hacking.

1064
01:17:48,815 --> 01:17:51,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever the fuck it was, money was stolen and...

1065
01:17:52,897 --> 01:17:56,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Social engineering is still a form of hacking, I guess.

1066
01:17:57,558 --> 01:18:01,299
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're going to add more stuff to their marketplace so that there's more things for people to buy?

1067
01:18:01,319 --> 01:18:02,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what they've learned?

1068
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:08,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, we've learned that we can get a lot of money from people getting their accounts stolen.

1069
01:18:08,641 --> 01:18:11,502
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're just going to add more things that they can buy.

1070
01:18:11,562 --> 01:18:12,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe some stuff for $500 instead.

1071
01:18:12,702 --> 01:18:13,022
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1072
01:18:16,264 --> 01:18:17,885
[SPEAKER_02]: How about you don't sell stuff for real money?

1073
01:18:34,847 --> 01:18:42,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the reality is where we're at in this industry now, I just don't think that's possible anymore.

1074
01:18:42,591 --> 01:18:43,851
[SPEAKER_08]: We're past that point.

1075
01:18:43,872 --> 01:18:48,154
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's stupid, though, that they have a $60 game that they're doing all these microtransactions on.

1076
01:18:49,054 --> 01:18:54,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think it's ridiculous, too, but unfortunately people are buying them, so it's working.

1077
01:18:55,643 --> 01:18:59,245
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to hunt these people out and off them.

1078
01:18:59,485 --> 01:18:59,805
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1079
01:19:00,405 --> 01:19:02,246
[SPEAKER_02]: We shouldn't tell people what to spend their money on.

1080
01:19:02,286 --> 01:19:05,408
[SPEAKER_02]: If people legitimately are doing this.

1081
01:19:05,468 --> 01:19:10,830
[SPEAKER_02]: The other problem I have is that probably 80% of that was all from stolen money.

1082
01:19:11,550 --> 01:19:15,452
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, besides that, people can spend their money however they want.

1083
01:19:15,992 --> 01:19:23,676
[SPEAKER_02]: If they want to buy $60 for the game and then pay all this money for the expansions, let them spend their money on it if that's what makes them happy.

1084
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:25,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Vote with your wallet.

1085
01:19:27,902 --> 01:19:29,264
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't like it, don't buy it.

1086
01:19:29,304 --> 01:19:32,506
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem is, my wallet was stolen and then used to vote.

1087
01:19:32,787 --> 01:19:33,507
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a problem.

1088
01:19:34,628 --> 01:19:35,569
[SPEAKER_02]: That's voter fraud.

1089
01:19:36,149 --> 01:19:37,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's not our problem.

1090
01:19:37,551 --> 01:19:38,431
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not our issue.

1091
01:19:40,073 --> 01:19:43,616
[SPEAKER_02]: A year later, oh, we've taken steps to try and make sure that won't happen again.

1092
01:19:43,636 --> 01:19:45,297
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was never our issue in the first place.

1093
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:52,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Why would you need to take steps if there was not an issue with your, if it was all Microsoft?

1094
01:19:52,403 --> 01:19:53,364
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd love to know.

1095
01:19:56,311 --> 01:20:09,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on Boy, DarkSakura, you're right The news tonight just makes us There's so much to get angry about this week Let's close the show and go get Pinkberry I thought you were having a healthy day It's yogurt

1096
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:16,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me, you'd want to get that delicious new chocolate hazelnut, which isn't the best yogurt for you.

1097
01:20:16,642 --> 01:20:20,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, Ubisoft made an interesting statement this week.

1098
01:20:20,945 --> 01:20:31,770
[SPEAKER_02]: The CEO of Ubisoft, and I can't even say this name, Yves Guillemot, Guillemot, Guillemot, Guillemot, Guillemot, Guillemot, Guillemot, isn't the T usually silent?

1099
01:20:33,191 --> 01:20:40,881
[SPEAKER_02]: came out and said that PC retail games have a gigantic rate of piracy.

1100
01:20:41,441 --> 01:20:44,645
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was talking to games industry at Gamescom.

1101
01:20:45,566 --> 01:20:51,454
[SPEAKER_02]: He said that only about 5% to 7% of freemium players buy content because...

1102
01:20:52,094 --> 01:20:58,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the retail PC product, they have a, quote, 93 to 95% piracy rate.

1103
01:20:58,438 --> 01:21:02,080
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's basically saying retail PC games, 93 to 95% piracy rate.

1104
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:10,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other comments, quote, we also take content which we've developed in the past, graphics, et cetera, and we can make cheaper games and improve them over time.

1105
01:21:10,885 --> 01:21:11,886
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1106
01:21:34,921 --> 01:21:58,686
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if you're looking at just the US and Britain and Japan and the rest of the UK where Ubisoft or wherever in the world they have a presence where they sell games maybe that number seems high but I mean piracy is fucking rampant in other parts of the world I'm sure there's copies of these games easily available in the most populous country in the world China

1107
01:22:00,546 --> 01:22:10,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there's tons of free copies of these games roaming around in China so when you throw in the worldwide perspective into the mix I could actually believe the 93-95% piracy rate

1108
01:22:14,727 --> 01:22:17,588
[SPEAKER_02]: But some people are still successful off that model.

1109
01:22:17,969 --> 01:22:18,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1110
01:22:19,009 --> 01:22:20,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not excusing it.

1111
01:22:20,390 --> 01:22:21,691
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying it's okay.

1112
01:22:22,231 --> 01:22:22,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying.

1113
01:22:23,091 --> 01:22:24,312
[SPEAKER_05]: And numbers can lie.

1114
01:22:24,452 --> 01:22:25,753
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to manipulate them.

1115
01:22:25,973 --> 01:22:29,815
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like piracy is anything new or like it's never happened before.

1116
01:22:30,975 --> 01:22:32,736
[SPEAKER_02]: We've never had successful PC games.

1117
01:22:32,956 --> 01:22:35,918
[SPEAKER_05]: But before I believe any of those numbers, I'd have to see where the polls are.

1118
01:22:36,238 --> 01:22:38,559
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, where it really is.

1119
01:22:38,699 --> 01:22:43,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't trust anything, numbers based on markets that wasn't made for.

1120
01:22:44,110 --> 01:22:46,692
[SPEAKER_02]: You're having a very I want to see the receipts kind of night.

1121
01:22:46,853 --> 01:22:47,153
[SPEAKER_05]: I am.

1122
01:22:47,173 --> 01:22:48,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know I'm like that anyway.

1123
01:22:50,236 --> 01:22:51,156
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like that anyway.

1124
01:22:51,837 --> 01:22:52,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what do you think of that number?

1125
01:22:53,018 --> 01:22:54,960
[SPEAKER_02]: 93 to 95% piracy rate.

1126
01:22:55,981 --> 01:22:56,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Seems a little high.

1127
01:22:56,782 --> 01:22:58,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1128
01:22:59,364 --> 01:23:00,045
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't buy it.

1129
01:23:00,565 --> 01:23:05,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Frisbee in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says 85% of statistics are made up on the spot.

1130
01:23:06,488 --> 01:23:08,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially in this industry, brother.

1131
01:23:08,269 --> 01:23:08,589
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1132
01:23:09,470 --> 01:23:20,657
[SPEAKER_02]: One other note about Ubisoft, which is interesting because Ubisoft previously came out and said the game I Am Alive was never going to come out on the PC, basically because there was no other version.

1133
01:23:21,278 --> 01:23:31,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, creative director Stanislaw Metra came out and said about I Am Alive, quote, we've heard loud and clear that PC gamers are bitching about there being no version for them.

1134
01:23:35,217 --> 01:23:35,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1135
01:23:36,578 --> 01:23:42,142
[SPEAKER_02]: But are these people just making noise because there's no version or because it's a game they actually want to play?

1136
01:23:42,482 --> 01:23:43,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Would they buy it if we made it?

1137
01:23:44,263 --> 01:23:51,348
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard because there's so much piracy and so few people are paying for PC games that we have to precisely weigh it up against the cost of making it.

1138
01:23:51,708 --> 01:23:55,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps it will only take 12 guys three months to port the game to PC.

1139
01:23:55,590 --> 01:23:57,892
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a massive cost, but it's still a cost.

1140
01:23:58,292 --> 01:24:01,414
[SPEAKER_02]: If only 50,000 people buy the game, then it's not worth it.

1141
01:24:03,035 --> 01:24:03,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Only 50,000?

1142
01:24:04,811 --> 01:24:09,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have to say, to his credit, he does make a point.

1143
01:24:10,773 --> 01:24:20,257
[SPEAKER_02]: If it takes 12 guys three months to port the game, then using fractions, that would also be three guys 12 months or three annual salaries.

1144
01:24:20,757 --> 01:24:23,579
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's say these guys make, I don't know, 75K a year.

1145
01:24:23,999 --> 01:24:27,500
[SPEAKER_02]: So to just pay those three guys is going to cost $225,000.

1146
01:24:29,961 --> 01:24:34,843
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's not even counting the cost to print the game, to market the game, to sell, you know, and all that stuff.

1147
01:24:35,023 --> 01:24:37,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Make it all download content so you don't have to pay for materials.

1148
01:24:39,685 --> 01:24:39,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1149
01:24:42,086 --> 01:24:44,527
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's some people that would be like, oh, but I don't want to pay.

1150
01:24:44,547 --> 01:24:45,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Viral marketing.

1151
01:24:45,087 --> 01:24:49,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to do, I don't download games because I have to have the tangible copy.

1152
01:24:49,789 --> 01:24:50,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they lose out.

1153
01:24:50,549 --> 01:24:53,850
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're, wait a minute, you're a collector in all this shit.

1154
01:24:53,930 --> 01:24:56,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Why, you, I, hold on.

1155
01:24:56,752 --> 01:24:57,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I collect old shit, Rob.

1156
01:24:57,892 --> 01:24:58,012
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1157
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:01,262
[SPEAKER_05]: I collect old things.

1158
01:25:14,975 --> 01:25:35,438
[SPEAKER_02]: and I would have done the download copy if it had been the same so let's make believe I use Steam Rob let's make believe la la la that the next Xbox and the next Playstation and just pulling shit out of my ass the Wii U all go digital only digital download only that's not a problem

1159
01:25:36,027 --> 01:25:36,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really.

1160
01:25:37,188 --> 01:25:41,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I'm going to say this is going into a little bit of my home stuff.

1161
01:25:41,611 --> 01:25:42,671
[SPEAKER_05]: We're thinking about downsizing.

1162
01:25:44,152 --> 01:25:50,956
[SPEAKER_05]: We have shelves that are taken up with DVDs and with our current game collection.

1163
01:25:51,557 --> 01:25:53,618
[SPEAKER_05]: We have buckets of the old stuff.

1164
01:25:54,138 --> 01:25:55,139
[SPEAKER_05]: The old stuff, that's fine.

1165
01:25:55,639 --> 01:25:56,440
[SPEAKER_05]: But anything new...

1166
01:25:57,941 --> 01:26:00,804
[SPEAKER_05]: I really wouldn't mind having it as a digital copy.

1167
01:26:01,165 --> 01:26:04,668
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, as long as I've got the software, the hardware to play it on, then I wouldn't mind.

1168
01:26:05,549 --> 01:26:12,837
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's less waste, less, it's green, Rob, it's green.

1169
01:26:14,139 --> 01:26:14,519
[SPEAKER_02]: It's green.

1170
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:16,381
[SPEAKER_02]: You hippie.

1171
01:26:16,741 --> 01:26:17,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1172
01:26:18,323 --> 01:26:19,985
[SPEAKER_02]: One more news story and then the release dates.

1173
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:26,269
[SPEAKER_05]: So how about some persona?

1174
01:26:27,089 --> 01:26:31,550
[SPEAKER_05]: There is going to be Persona 4, the solid gold premium edition.

1175
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:45,113
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's going to be only 10,000 copies produced, but it will have a Hori hardcover pouch, a face cover, stickers, and Vita skins, along with eight matching wallpapers.

1176
01:26:45,233 --> 01:26:45,713
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's going to be $70.

1177
01:26:45,753 --> 01:26:45,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1178
01:26:47,553 --> 01:26:52,896
[SPEAKER_05]: and the first run copies, just to let people know, had just the skins and wallpapers and it was $40.

1179
01:26:55,678 --> 01:26:59,941
[SPEAKER_05]: So for people who are Persona fans, also just to let you know, only in Japan.

1180
01:27:00,261 --> 01:27:01,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Of which there are a few.

1181
01:27:01,282 --> 01:27:02,062
[SPEAKER_02]: That won't stop.

1182
01:27:02,082 --> 01:27:04,083
[SPEAKER_02]: That won't stop many people, I know.

1183
01:27:04,103 --> 01:27:04,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the Premium Edition?

1184
01:27:04,924 --> 01:27:05,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no.

1185
01:27:05,964 --> 01:27:10,727
[SPEAKER_05]: The bonus stuff that came out with the Solid Gold Edition are the same ones that came out in Japan.

1191
01:27:26,334 --> 01:27:29,516
[SPEAKER_02]: That shows you how rabid the fans are that they've already sold it out.

1192
01:27:31,437 --> 01:27:33,539
[SPEAKER_02]: I know people that are really, really, really into this game.

[SPEAKER_05]: There's no Europe that is not coming out, though.

1246

[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Sony has patented something to shove advertisements down our throat.

1247
01:31:43,507 --> 01:31:44,447
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called a TV.

1248
01:31:44,728 --> 01:31:52,955
[SPEAKER_08]: No, actually, it's called interactive TV ads, which basically allow you... And I've actually kind of seen this on some other websites.

1249
01:31:52,995 --> 01:31:53,536
[SPEAKER_08]: For example...

1250
01:31:55,617 --> 01:32:02,163
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the interactive bits about it, like a McDonald's ad or something like that, and you have to say McDonald's to end commercial.

1251
01:32:02,604 --> 01:32:05,466
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you say McDonald's, then the commercial ends, that type of thing.

1252
01:32:06,567 --> 01:32:09,770
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a website, as I talked about a lot, of Freddie Wong.

1253
01:32:09,890 --> 01:32:12,052
[SPEAKER_08]: They do videos and stuff like that.

1254
01:32:12,072 --> 01:32:12,852
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a YouTube channel.

1255
01:32:12,872 --> 01:32:16,856
[SPEAKER_08]: But they have their own website called Rocket Jump, and their video player that they have on there has ads.

1256
01:32:17,356 --> 01:32:19,859
[SPEAKER_08]: But to skip the ads, you have to type a word in.

1257
01:32:20,559 --> 01:32:28,486
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can watch the ad or you can type, you know, Ford Focus and it'll stop the ad.

1258
01:32:28,907 --> 01:32:34,492
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of like, okay, this way the advertiser knows this person saw the ad.

1259
01:32:34,532 --> 01:32:36,273
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just like clicking on skip.

1260
01:32:36,374 --> 01:32:40,637
[SPEAKER_08]: They know what the product is and they're aware of what you're trying to do.

1261
01:32:41,078 --> 01:32:43,620
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of cool.

1262
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:44,221
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean...

1263
01:32:45,882 --> 01:32:57,442
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't know what sort of things and games are going to require advertisements or commercials where I actually have to say something in order to have them go away, but...

1264
01:32:59,045 --> 01:32:59,665
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1265
01:33:26,633 --> 01:33:28,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't want to get into it.

1266
01:33:28,675 --> 01:33:33,900
[SPEAKER_02]: To be fair, the Viagra was not made to do that.

1267
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:38,444
[SPEAKER_02]: It was made for heart problems, but it just happened to have this side effect.

1268
01:33:40,005 --> 01:33:40,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, how's your heart?

1269
01:33:40,946 --> 01:33:41,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Boner!

1270
01:33:42,408 --> 01:33:45,611
[SPEAKER_02]: That happens in the pharmaceutical industry a lot of times.

1271
01:33:45,631 --> 01:33:52,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the medication I was taking for my chronic fatigue syndrome is actually what they all prescribe for narcolepsy.

1272
01:33:52,819 --> 01:33:57,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't it kind of ironic, though, that they tell you that you shouldn't use Viagra if you have heart problems?

1273
01:33:57,981 --> 01:34:01,062
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like... Well, because it was for a certain type of heart condition.

1274
01:34:01,122 --> 01:34:01,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a doctor.

1275
01:34:01,782 --> 01:34:04,403
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to try to explain it, but... Anyhow.

1276
01:34:05,163 --> 01:34:10,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Some folks in chat says... Hitstun says, Adblock Plus is made for invasive ads like this.

1277
01:34:11,425 --> 01:34:14,526
[SPEAKER_02]: And RDGSinge says, Thank God for ad and flash blockers.

1278
01:34:15,046 --> 01:34:23,112
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true in browsers, but when you're talking about being built in the consoles, I'm assuming this is going to be streaming stuff, like I'm watching ad-supported things.

1279
01:34:23,292 --> 01:34:23,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1280
01:34:23,932 --> 01:34:25,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, I mean, it's ad-supported.

1281
01:34:25,813 --> 01:34:28,315
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like if I'm watching TV, and it's free.

1282
01:34:28,355 --> 01:34:29,076
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're on Hulu.

1283
01:34:29,236 --> 01:34:37,341
[SPEAKER_02]: If Sony's about to do something like the Kinect, where they're putting a microphone in your living room, because think about it, Microsoft could incorporate this into the Kinect right now.

1284
01:34:37,361 --> 01:34:42,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you imagine if the Kinect would interrupt you, for example, like you're talking about...

1285
01:34:42,765 --> 01:34:45,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, I wish I... Where do you want to eat tonight?

1286
01:34:46,427 --> 01:34:49,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey guys, were you talking about eating somewhere?

1287
01:34:49,128 --> 01:34:50,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, that's terrible.

1288
01:34:50,969 --> 01:34:55,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you imagine we're sitting here doing the show and Jamie's like, Rob, let's just end the show and go to Pinkberry.

1289
01:34:55,571 --> 01:35:00,773
[SPEAKER_02]: And then suddenly up on the TV it all, did you know Pinkberry's latest flavor is chocolate hazelnut?

1290
01:35:00,933 --> 01:35:03,996
[SPEAKER_08]: We laugh about that now, but that is the future.

1291
01:35:04,016 --> 01:35:06,618
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no.

1292
01:35:06,718 --> 01:35:08,479
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to put our foot down.

1293
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:12,243
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole Big Brother is watching you 1984.

1294
01:35:12,403 --> 01:35:13,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to be in that?

1295
01:35:13,684 --> 01:35:14,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the thing, though.

1296
01:35:14,544 --> 01:35:15,886
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's targeted advertising.

1297
01:35:15,906 --> 01:35:16,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Unplug it.

1298
01:35:16,426 --> 01:35:17,447
[SPEAKER_08]: That's targeted advertising.

1299
01:35:17,547 --> 01:35:25,434
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to know about Pinkberry versus you want to know about natural male enhancement or you want to know about... I don't need natural male enhancement.

1300
01:35:25,634 --> 01:35:27,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I have natural male enhancement.

1301
01:35:30,890 --> 01:35:33,592
[SPEAKER_08]: What's not natural about, you know, naked boobies?

1302
01:35:33,652 --> 01:35:35,333
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's natural male enhancement.

1303
01:35:35,353 --> 01:35:36,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Or whatever, turns you on.

1304
01:35:37,675 --> 01:35:38,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I like boobies, but, you know.

1305
01:35:43,099 --> 01:35:46,221
[SPEAKER_08]: They should have a strip club named Natural Male Enhancement.

1306
01:35:46,381 --> 01:35:47,562
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be pretty awesome.

1307
01:35:50,899 --> 01:36:00,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, um, rdgsinge in chat says, I did that trick to block MS ad servers from pushing ads on my Xbox system, but every now and then they get through.

1308
01:36:00,163 --> 01:36:01,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Would be nice to know what to update.

1309
01:36:02,004 --> 01:36:09,627
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but we have ads on vognetwork.com and, you know, it isn't free to produce this stuff.

1310
01:36:10,207 --> 01:36:20,471
[SPEAKER_02]: We pay for a lot of this shit out of pocket because it's our hobby and it's, you know, what we like to do, but I just would really appreciate it if you like the shows at vognetwork.com.

1311
01:36:20,811 --> 01:36:44,391
[SPEAKER_02]: just put it on the whitelist for fuck's sake like we really tried to design things to not be invasive because we know you know like you guys we don't want to be invasive but you know when you block them all you're blocking the little guys too click an ad every once in a while once in a while visit the site help us out you can click the ad and then close the page all right moving on

1312
01:36:45,717 --> 01:37:13,960
[SPEAKER_02]: technically I think encouraging people to do that is like a violation of the whatever don't be suspicious when you do it alright they know that's what's going on moving on one more thing maybe this is a little more exciting let's end this ranty and depressing and sad segment of Orange Lounge Radio well we're about to be off for a week with something a little better and that is that Harmonix is apparently looking for a combat designer what

1313
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:17,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking everybody's kung fu fighting.

1314
01:37:39,100 --> 01:38:04,849
[SPEAKER_02]: or or you know when you're a jet you know you're a jet you know it's capoeira game who knows anything's possible uh in addition to finishing development on rock band blitz and dance central 3 harmonix is actively developing multiple new ips on next generation hardware we're looking for the best and most experienced devs out there to join us so obviously speculate away what the hell could this be um you know a lot of people making up their own ideas but

1315
01:38:04,969 --> 01:38:05,529
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1316
01:38:32,409 --> 01:38:33,389
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll believe it when I see it.

1317
01:38:35,070 --> 01:38:36,450
[SPEAKER_05]: I am the queen of JTB.

1318
01:38:36,590 --> 01:38:37,450
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to see the receipts.

1319
01:38:37,710 --> 01:38:41,671
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think it's ironic that a music game company is working on an action game.

1320
01:38:42,151 --> 01:38:42,712
[SPEAKER_08]: That could be cool.

1321
01:38:42,892 --> 01:38:46,132
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw in chat says, maybe Harmonix is working on a Battle of the Bands game.

1322
01:38:46,412 --> 01:38:49,813
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in a band and you actually have to battle each other by hitting each other with musical instruments.

1323
01:38:49,833 --> 01:38:52,834
[SPEAKER_08]: That's been done on the Wii and it was terrible.

1324
01:38:53,014 --> 01:38:56,455
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was called Battle of the Bands and they literally had it where you

1325
01:38:57,075 --> 01:38:59,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Your band equipment would turn into a minigun.

1326
01:38:59,676 --> 01:39:01,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiger Claw is going to get taken to court.

1327
01:39:02,396 --> 01:39:04,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Sued for $1.2 billion.

1328
01:39:04,196 --> 01:39:06,977
[SPEAKER_02]: It's terrible.

1329
01:39:07,297 --> 01:39:08,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Battle of the bands on the Wii.

1330
01:39:10,177 --> 01:39:13,998
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to have battles right away, Yakuza 5 will have dance battles.

1331
01:39:14,278 --> 01:39:19,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know, don't we just love minigame dancing in every fucking game?

1332
01:39:19,459 --> 01:39:24,500
[SPEAKER_02]: So Yakuza 5 will have... Well, granted, Yakuza has a lot of shit going on.

1333
01:39:24,580 --> 01:39:24,760
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1334
01:39:26,241 --> 01:39:29,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe this isn't completely out of character for the Yakuza series, but whatever.

1335
01:39:29,784 --> 01:39:31,886
[SPEAKER_02]: They are doing dance battles.

1336
01:39:32,127 --> 01:39:36,852
[SPEAKER_02]: And Yakuza 5, one of the subplots is about the adopted daughter of Kazuma Kiryu.

1337
01:39:36,952 --> 01:39:37,833
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Haruka.

1338
01:39:38,213 --> 01:39:39,955
[SPEAKER_02]: She's trying to become an idol.

1339
01:39:40,976 --> 01:39:42,297
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll do these dance battles.

1340
01:39:42,377 --> 01:39:43,358
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little rhythm game.

1341
01:39:43,418 --> 01:39:47,322
[SPEAKER_02]: I could explain more about it, but whatever.

1342
01:39:48,203 --> 01:39:52,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hope that Harmonix isn't working on a step-up revolution game.

1343
01:39:53,066 --> 01:39:53,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hope.

1344
01:39:53,547 --> 01:39:58,270
[SPEAKER_05]: She wants to be a pop idol so that her song will be featured in the newest anime put out by Gainax.

1345
01:39:58,930 --> 01:39:59,531
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not really.

1346
01:39:59,831 --> 01:40:00,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't wait.

1347
01:40:02,733 --> 01:40:05,194
[SPEAKER_08]: They have karaoke and sleeping dogs.

1348
01:40:05,755 --> 01:40:09,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's travel to a time when we didn't get so fucking mad about everything.

1349
01:40:09,737 --> 01:40:10,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Except this game.

1350
01:40:10,458 --> 01:40:11,699
[SPEAKER_05]: We got really mad at one of the bosses.

1351
01:40:13,170 --> 01:40:14,291
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1352
01:40:32,341 --> 01:40:37,443
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're super depressed about all these studios closing, why not play some of the greats from the past?

1353
01:40:37,984 --> 01:40:44,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, if you're depressed, pretend you're a ninja and slice shit to death and blow shit up with ninja bombs.

1354
01:40:44,546 --> 01:40:45,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Go into denial.

1355
01:40:45,447 --> 01:40:46,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, go into denial.

1356
01:40:47,448 --> 01:40:55,091
[SPEAKER_05]: The game of the week is called Shadow of the Ninja, or as it was known in Japan, Yaminoshigote... Okay, I'm going to mispronounce this.

1357
01:40:55,171 --> 01:40:56,452
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Yaminoshigote...

1358
01:40:57,472 --> 01:41:19,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Shigotonin Kage which is Dark Professional Shadow that's actually a cooler name so basically it's a futuristic ninja themed side scroll arcade action type game and I am trying to get the audio up but remember when Natsume didn't do Harvest Moon no actually I don't this was a game by Natsume

1359
01:41:21,888 --> 01:41:24,751
[SPEAKER_05]: It came out in Japan in 1990 and came out in North America in 1991.

1360
01:41:26,112 --> 01:41:30,956
[SPEAKER_05]: The PAL version was published by Taito under the name Blue Shadow, which is actually a pretty cool name.

1361
01:41:32,417 --> 01:41:33,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, because he's blue.

1362
01:41:33,598 --> 01:41:40,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, but also there was this big thing in the 80s and early 90s in England where you couldn't, say, have ninja in the title.

1363
01:41:41,824 --> 01:41:45,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, for example, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles.

1364
01:41:46,408 --> 01:41:47,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, did you know that?

1365
01:41:47,849 --> 01:41:48,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I did know that.

1366
01:41:48,389 --> 01:41:48,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1367
01:41:48,590 --> 01:41:48,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

1368
01:41:49,266 --> 01:42:04,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Natsume also did a Game Boy version of this, however, it actually got picked up by Tecmo and they tried to make it into a Ninja Gaiden game called Ninja Gaiden Shadow, which is sort of half Shadow of the Ninja and half Ninja Gaiden and 100% kind of crap.

1369
01:42:06,494 --> 01:42:06,574
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1370
01:42:22,094 --> 01:42:24,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, actually, in Hindi it means eagle.

1371
01:42:25,078 --> 01:42:26,080
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned that from doing yoga.

1372
01:42:27,642 --> 01:42:36,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Has taken over the USA and made a big stronghold in the middle of the nation's, quote, largest city.

1373
01:42:37,435 --> 01:42:44,620
[SPEAKER_05]: So these two ninja, Hayate and Kaede, have to go infiltrate the stronghold and kill him to death!

1374
01:42:46,661 --> 01:42:54,105
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is up to two players simultaneous, or you can pick one or the other, which is, like I said, Hayate or Kaede.

1375
01:42:55,046 --> 01:43:01,430
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can... There's actually no difference between who you play, really.

1376
01:43:02,410 --> 01:43:03,711
[SPEAKER_05]: But they just look differently.

1377
01:43:04,592 --> 01:43:04,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1378
01:43:07,259 --> 01:43:17,269
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, you, uh, basically you can run, you can crouch, you can climb ladders, you can actually, um, hang from certain areas overhead.

1379
01:43:17,690 --> 01:43:20,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Including a lot of the moving platforms, you can do that too.

1380
01:43:20,052 --> 01:43:25,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and you actually can get, uh, you can build up your weapon over time too.

1381
01:43:26,558 --> 01:43:27,859
[SPEAKER_05]: They have special attacks.

1382
01:43:28,419 --> 01:43:34,703
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them is a thunderstorm that will just damage all the on-screen enemies, but it takes half your life to do it.

1383
01:43:34,883 --> 01:43:37,725
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually is quite possible to play this whole game without using any of that.

1384
01:43:38,665 --> 01:43:40,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Your default weapon is katana.

1385
01:43:40,607 --> 01:43:42,568
[SPEAKER_05]: However, you can also get kusarigama.

1386
01:43:43,528 --> 01:43:50,973
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a longer range, but the katana will actually get a full screen range once it's fully powered up, and everyone really likes it better.

1387
01:43:51,933 --> 01:43:54,335
[SPEAKER_05]: You also can get some limited use items.

1388
01:43:54,355 --> 01:44:01,759
[SPEAKER_05]: You get shuriken or what my husband calls the ninja bomb, which is just some sort of hand grenade.

1389
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:11,124
[SPEAKER_05]: And then once you use up your number of those, you actually go back to either using the katana or the kusarigama.

1390
01:44:12,084 --> 01:44:14,505
[SPEAKER_05]: For anyone who doesn't know what that is, it's a hook on a rope.

1391
01:44:14,866 --> 01:44:15,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1392
01:44:15,066 --> 01:44:15,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1393
01:44:16,790 --> 01:44:20,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it has five levels, um, totaling 16 stages.

1394
01:44:20,892 --> 01:44:23,753
[SPEAKER_05]: The first four are in three stages, the final one is in two.

1395
01:44:24,653 --> 01:44:38,359
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, you have your bosses, you have your mini-bosses, and, uh, you, um, when you beat a boss it explodes, but the explosion heals you, and you can, that way you can carry over life into the next level.

1396
01:44:39,279 --> 01:44:46,861
[SPEAKER_05]: if your game will actually be over if you lose all of your energy and you only have five continues.

1397
01:44:47,721 --> 01:44:52,362
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have two players in the game, your continues are shared, so I hope you're playing with someone who doesn't suck.

1398
01:44:53,202 --> 01:45:01,304
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, the game was really awesome when it came out, and, I mean, just sit and watch a playthrough of this, or play it yourself if you've got it.

1399
01:45:02,164 --> 01:45:06,245
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got neat effects, great animation for a NES game.

1400
01:45:06,305 --> 01:45:08,466
[SPEAKER_05]: The music, Bob, turn up some music if you don't mind.

1401
01:45:16,844 --> 01:45:18,165
[SPEAKER_05]: The music is really good.

1402
01:45:19,306 --> 01:45:24,290
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's totally worth... It has an old Mega Man feel to it a little bit.

1403
01:45:24,430 --> 01:45:24,831
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit.

1404
01:45:25,031 --> 01:45:25,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, a little bit.

1405
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:31,997
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, there are actually these little enemies that slide across the floor slowly, but when you're on the floor, they move faster.

1406
01:45:32,837 --> 01:45:34,799
[SPEAKER_05]: It totally made me think of some Mega Man 2 enemies.

1407
01:45:34,919 --> 01:45:36,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me go to part one here.

1408
01:45:36,981 --> 01:45:38,842
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to scroll past the intro.

1409
01:45:39,022 --> 01:45:41,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to get the first level music.

1410
01:45:45,014 --> 01:45:46,022
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess they're waiting for Stage 1-2

1411
01:45:57,044 --> 01:46:03,447
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really neat game, and on top of that, you can find it really inexpensive in a used game store.

1412
01:46:03,967 --> 01:46:06,508
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a game that I think everyone should have in their collection.

1413
01:46:06,628 --> 01:46:10,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the American box art is stupendously hokey looking.

1414
01:46:10,449 --> 01:46:16,612
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, ooh, action game with a couple of ninja who look, you know, amazingly white.

1415
01:46:17,872 --> 01:46:27,237
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but it really is a very, very good game and I totally recommend everyone, you know, shell out the five to ten bucks it is at your local used video game store.

1416
01:46:28,177 --> 01:46:29,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Shadow of the Ninja, get it.

1417
01:46:31,438 --> 01:46:35,420
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is, a classic game of the week, Shadow of the Ninja on the NES.

1418
01:46:38,842 --> 01:46:45,685
[SPEAKER_02]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com, use the passphrase element.

1419
01:46:46,539 --> 01:46:48,861
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're going to take a break, but don't go anywhere, guys.

1420
01:46:48,881 --> 01:46:56,165
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio after a quick break where, yes, we'll talk a little bit about that Nintendo Power thing I'm sure you've all heard about.

1421
01:46:56,266 --> 01:46:57,486
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk a little bit about that.

1422
01:46:57,967 --> 01:47:00,468
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to talk about some changes to Diablo 3.

1423
01:47:01,249 --> 01:47:14,958
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk all about that and more, including your emails, your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR, and your phone calls coming up a little later, including one phone call from someone who has something to say about Wii U, who actually has touched one and played one.

1424
01:47:14,978 --> 01:47:16,119
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got something to say.

1425
01:47:16,719 --> 01:47:18,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing to say!

1426
01:47:18,401 --> 01:47:19,002
[SPEAKER_08]: I miss that show.

1427
01:47:19,022 --> 01:47:24,748
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, if you want to know my favorite TV show of all time, of all time, ever, and it's on Netflix.

1428
01:47:25,448 --> 01:47:26,169
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on Netflix?

1429
01:47:26,249 --> 01:47:26,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

1430
01:47:27,130 --> 01:47:28,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Strangers with Candy.

1431
01:47:29,072 --> 01:47:30,854
[SPEAKER_02]: The most amazing 30 episodes.

1432
01:47:31,715 --> 01:47:35,098
[SPEAKER_02]: A 30-minute episode is what when it's cut out the commercials?

1433
01:47:35,118 --> 01:47:35,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Like 23 minutes?

1434
01:47:35,519 --> 01:47:35,699
[SPEAKER_02]: 22, yeah.

1435
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:37,500
[SPEAKER_02]: So put it together.

1436
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Most amazing 600 minutes of your life.

1437
01:47:39,861 --> 01:47:41,242
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you should do Labor Day weekend.

1438
01:47:41,282 --> 01:47:43,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it a point to watch every episode of Strangers with Candy.

1439
01:47:43,623 --> 01:47:47,245
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the greatest sitcom I have ever seen in my life.

1440
01:47:47,265 --> 01:47:53,108
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even really a sitcom, but it's... Look, Stephen Colbert was in it before he had that Colbert rapport.

1441
01:47:53,648 --> 01:47:56,770
[SPEAKER_02]: And he is my absolute inspiration as an educator.

1442
01:47:58,871 --> 01:48:00,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's your permission slip, Mr. Knoblet?

1443
01:48:01,012 --> 01:48:02,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut your dirty little mouth!

1444
01:48:05,456 --> 01:48:12,445
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking amazing now I'm going to be thinking about that as we go to break we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this

1445
01:48:18,238 --> 01:48:26,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this last episode for the month of August.

1446
01:48:26,941 --> 01:48:28,422
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we won't be here next week.

1447
01:48:28,442 --> 01:48:29,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a great Labor Day, those of you in the States.

1448
01:48:29,962 --> 01:48:32,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Those of you not in the States, have a great weekend, whatever it is you do.

1449
01:48:33,343 --> 01:48:43,567
[SPEAKER_02]: But sadly, we won't be here live next weekend as we enjoy the three-day weekend and catch up on some games that we've been needing to catch up on or Marathon Strangers of Candy, one of the two.

1450
01:48:44,267 --> 01:48:47,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's get into some rapid fire news.

1451
01:48:47,369 --> 01:48:53,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Some quick news stories for you guys before we get to the Facebook and Google question of the week, or the Fugle question of the week.

1452
01:48:53,914 --> 01:48:54,554
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, Loki.

1453
01:48:54,934 --> 01:48:57,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft wants to let you know that the Kinect has dropped in price to $109.99.

1454
01:48:59,217 --> 01:49:03,020
[SPEAKER_08]: That's $40 cheaper than it was when it first came out.

1455
01:49:05,041 --> 01:49:06,182
[SPEAKER_08]: The game's being better, though?

1456
01:49:07,285 --> 01:49:08,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1457
01:49:27,867 --> 01:49:28,608
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably under $10.

1458
01:49:30,209 --> 01:49:28,608
$6.71.

1459
01:49:30,549 --> 01:49:32,350
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't beat that.

1460
01:49:32,670 --> 01:49:42,635
[SPEAKER_08]: If you pledge $6.71, not only will you get the games that they were offering, which were Field Runners, Bit.Trip Beat, Space Chem, and Uplink.

1461
01:49:42,795 --> 01:49:49,759
[SPEAKER_08]: You would have previously unlocked Spirits, but you also now will unlock World of Goo, Osmos, Anomaly, and Edge.

1462
01:49:50,859 --> 01:50:15,898
[SPEAKER_08]: all those games available for Android and for PC they're multi-platform so you get the Steam codes as well as the DRM free downloads for all that stuff actually I should correct myself to get the Steam codes you have to pay over a dollar so obviously if you're paying over the average you would get the Steam codes but check them out sounds awesome

1463
01:50:17,603 --> 01:50:26,930
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, last but not least, that wonderful Scott Pilgrim online multiplayer DLC that was also going to unlock an additional character and whatnot.

1464
01:50:27,790 --> 01:50:29,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it got delayed to the fall.

1465
01:50:30,472 --> 01:50:31,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Womp womp.

1466
01:50:31,813 --> 01:50:36,056
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why, but that's unfortunate.

1467
01:50:36,276 --> 01:50:40,299
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess the PlayStation Network version will also release during that time frame as well.

1468
01:50:42,881 --> 01:50:44,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving on with some other stories.

1469
01:50:44,662 --> 01:50:44,963
[SPEAKER_02]: So,

1470
01:50:47,330 --> 01:50:51,093
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I could, but my internet is slowing down and I don't have the skills.

1471
01:50:51,113 --> 01:50:52,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I was running into.

1472
01:50:53,134 --> 01:50:54,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Something's up with our web.

1473
01:50:54,255 --> 01:50:56,857
[SPEAKER_02]: We suddenly just lost our web.

1474
01:50:57,097 --> 01:50:58,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine just plain hasn't worked today.

1475
01:50:58,918 --> 01:51:02,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what's going on, but awkward pause.

1476
01:51:03,061 --> 01:51:03,361
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1477
01:51:04,322 --> 01:51:07,164
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if, oh shit, I wonder if we just had a stream hiccup because of that.

1478
01:51:08,598 --> 01:51:09,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me look.

1479
01:51:10,279 --> 01:51:11,120
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're still connected.

1480
01:51:12,160 --> 01:51:14,982
[SPEAKER_02]: The joys and pains of doing live radio.

1481
01:51:15,002 --> 01:51:15,363
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.

1482
01:51:15,383 --> 01:51:16,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a few things here for you guys.

1483
01:51:16,523 --> 01:51:16,764
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1484
01:51:17,664 --> 01:51:18,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Mashihiro Sakurai.

1485
01:51:18,905 --> 01:51:21,727
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that name because he's the director of Super Smash Brothers.

1486
01:51:22,167 --> 01:51:32,234
[SPEAKER_02]: He mentioned at the CEDEC developer conference in this past week that the Smash Brothers game on Wii U and 3DS will have new and exciting moves for existing characters.

1487
01:51:32,694 --> 01:51:35,697
[SPEAKER_02]: He also mentioned there will be, of course, a bunch of new characters.

1488
01:51:36,537 --> 01:51:43,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Now will come the epically long tease of which characters will be there and which characters won't be there and so on and so on.

1489
01:51:44,064 --> 01:51:47,267
[SPEAKER_02]: But it sounds like they are going to expand the moveset a little bit.

1490
01:51:47,287 --> 01:51:51,451
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering if that means there's going to be more than two buttons from here on out for Smash Bros.

1491
01:51:51,471 --> 01:51:52,172
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be interesting.

1492
01:51:52,831 --> 01:51:53,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Speculate away!

1493
01:51:54,593 --> 01:51:56,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Because lots of people already are.

1494
01:51:56,995 --> 01:51:58,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Still button mash brothers, I bet.

1495
01:51:59,797 --> 01:52:01,418
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to piss some people off.

1496
01:52:02,339 --> 01:52:10,706
[SPEAKER_02]: This is coming from a former 3D modeler that worked at Rare on games like Donkey Kong 64, Jet Force Gemini, and so forth.

1497
01:52:11,066 --> 01:52:11,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently...

1498
01:52:12,367 --> 01:52:18,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Rare did want to do a new Killer Instinct game, but Microsoft was more interested in broadening the Xbox user base.

1499
01:52:18,970 --> 01:52:23,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Quote, the same game every Rare fan wants to see, and that's Killer Instinct 3.

1500
01:52:23,192 --> 01:52:30,095
[SPEAKER_02]: We all wanted to make Killer Instinct 3, but Microsoft was more interested in broadening their demographic than making another fighting game.

1501
01:52:30,395 --> 01:52:31,476
[SPEAKER_02]: So it never got made.

1502
01:52:31,656 --> 01:52:32,877
[SPEAKER_02]: I doubt it never will.

1503
01:52:33,797 --> 01:52:35,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft, FU!

1504
01:52:53,557 --> 01:52:53,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

1505
01:52:54,438 --> 01:52:54,939
[SPEAKER_02]: No, sir.

1506
01:52:55,139 --> 01:52:57,261
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an iOS port of the game.

1507
01:52:57,281 --> 01:52:58,702
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming out next week.

1508
01:52:59,162 --> 01:53:00,724
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe the price on it is $20.

1509
01:53:00,964 --> 01:53:05,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Square Enix likes to charge more money for their games than 99 cents.

1510
01:53:06,129 --> 01:53:12,114
[SPEAKER_02]: To be fair, they don't shove the free-to-play model down your throat, make you buy power-ups and all that.

1511
01:53:12,174 --> 01:53:15,137
[SPEAKER_02]: So at least for your $20, you're getting a well-rounded game.

1512
01:53:15,157 --> 01:53:15,877
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gotta say...

1513
01:53:17,158 --> 01:53:45,702
[SPEAKER_02]: some of their iPad games and such look great like their Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy 2 ports that they did on the original iPhone kind of before there was iPad looked great on the iPhone so you know I'm sure the game will look really good but I don't know again the lack of tactile controls I think is what frustrates a lot of people like we don't really want to see games like The World Ends With You get ported to iOS because touch controls kind of suck on a lot of these games at least I know that's what frustrates me

1514
01:53:46,687 --> 01:53:53,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and then $20 is still pretty expensive for anything that's on, you know, iOS.

1515
01:53:54,450 --> 01:53:59,271
[SPEAKER_08]: I think for that reason, because it's, you know, you're kind of gimping the game a little bit.

1516
01:53:59,291 --> 01:54:00,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not everything's $0.99.

1517
01:54:00,552 --> 01:54:12,316
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just looking at iPad apps today, and some of the better-selling iPad apps are the official Apple, you know, versions of, what is it, Keynote is like their PowerPoint-type thing, is one of their top sellers.

1518
01:54:12,416 --> 01:54:12,536
[SPEAKER_02]: It's $9.99.

1519
01:54:13,836 --> 01:54:15,037
[SPEAKER_02]: GarageBand does very well.

1520
01:54:15,057 --> 01:54:15,397
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a $5 app.

1521
01:54:17,057 --> 01:54:22,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but $5.99 versus $20 is still a bit much.

1522
01:54:22,359 --> 01:54:25,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, but how much did it cost on the DS?

1523
01:54:27,481 --> 01:54:28,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably closer to $35.

1524
01:54:28,221 --> 01:54:29,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Technically, it was free.

1525
01:54:30,742 --> 01:54:33,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's been out for a while now.

1526
01:54:33,603 --> 01:54:37,204
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you can buy it on the DS for probably less than $20.

1527
01:54:38,305 --> 01:54:39,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that I'd agree with, yes.

1528
01:54:39,965 --> 01:54:44,587
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's my issue with that is it's been out for a while.

1529
01:54:44,907 --> 01:54:47,949
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they can put it at $20, but it doesn't mean everyone's going to buy it for that.

1530
01:54:48,049 --> 01:54:53,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, look, I'm going to admit, and this might ruffle some feathers or whatever, but I actually didn't play this game on DS.

1531
01:54:53,893 --> 01:54:54,333
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't either.

1532
01:54:54,413 --> 01:54:55,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't get around to it.

1533
01:54:56,275 --> 01:54:57,896
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have time to play every single game.

1534
01:54:58,396 --> 01:55:08,263
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if I would necessarily go out of my way to check it out on iOS, but I know there are some fans of this game and are really hoping it will result in a sequel.

1535
01:55:08,323 --> 01:55:11,305
[SPEAKER_02]: It does make me think, oh, I need to go back and try the one on DS.

1536
01:55:11,765 --> 01:55:12,846
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.

1537
01:55:14,947 --> 01:55:17,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Shima Panic in our chatroom says, the world ends with you.

1538
01:55:17,711 --> 01:55:19,413
[SPEAKER_02]: DS was $40 at launch.

1539
01:55:19,854 --> 01:55:20,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1540
01:55:22,116 --> 01:55:20,174
$40.

1541
01:55:22,237 --> 01:55:24,900
[SPEAKER_02]: I think mine's actually still in my DS.

1542
01:55:24,980 --> 01:55:26,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes $20 not seem so bad.

1543
01:55:28,124 --> 01:55:28,425
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1544
01:55:29,246 --> 01:55:29,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

1545
01:55:29,846 --> 01:55:30,247
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

1546
01:55:31,326 --> 01:55:36,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, XSEED put out an announcement that Ragnarok Odyssey is going to have two editions to choose from.

1547
01:55:37,410 --> 01:55:48,798
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one is a standard that's only the game, and then the mercenary edition that comes with the soundtrack, a mercenary guide that's sort of an art book and strategy guide, and monster cards, ten random ones.

1548
01:55:48,878 --> 01:55:56,244
[SPEAKER_05]: The standard edition is $40, and the mercenary edition is $50, so it depends on how much money you want to spend for stuff that'll collect dust later.

1549
01:55:56,844 --> 01:56:21,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't know And for fans of Dance Central, there is a song list out for Dance Central 3 Nine new songs actually have come out There's Afrojack featuring Eva Simmons, Take Over Control Alexandra Stan, Mr. Saxo Beat Half the shit I haven't heard of I know that song, it's a total gay bar song I don't know how else to phrase it

1550
01:56:22,433 --> 01:56:26,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Ciara featuring Missy Elliott, One Two Step, Cupid with Cupid Shuffle, Daft Punk around the world.

1551
01:56:26,994 --> 01:56:27,675
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Daft Punk.

1552
01:56:28,515 --> 01:56:31,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Dev featuring the, what band is going to call themselves the Cataracts?

1553
01:56:32,576 --> 01:56:33,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I'm an eye disease.

1554
01:56:34,837 --> 01:56:35,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Bass down low.

1555
01:56:36,457 --> 01:56:40,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Ener featuring Natasha, I guess is how it's supposed to be.

1556
01:56:40,559 --> 01:56:45,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Calabria 2008, Martin Selvig featuring Dragonette, Hello.

1557
01:56:45,980 --> 01:56:46,661
[SPEAKER_05]: That song's cute.

1558
01:56:46,701 --> 01:56:47,141
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that song.

1559
01:56:47,161 --> 01:56:47,561
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that song.

1560
01:56:48,101 --> 01:57:08,084
[SPEAKER_05]: The Tramps, Disco Inferno I fucking love Disco Inferno because I was a little kid with my Saturday Night Fever soundtracks freaking dancing on my bed to Disco Inferno any song that has burn baby burn in the lyrics totally down for it around the world's gonna be awesome yep

1561
01:57:09,435 --> 01:57:16,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and last but never least, there is a survival game coming up by... Can I read a comment from Stan in our chat room?

1562
01:57:17,105 --> 01:57:19,088
[SPEAKER_02]: What band would call themselves Anthrax?

1563
01:57:21,170 --> 01:57:24,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no one ever accused metal bands of having much in the way of intelligence.

1564
01:57:26,217 --> 01:57:27,198
[SPEAKER_05]: They're probably on heroin.

1565
01:57:31,252 --> 01:57:32,113
[SPEAKER_02]: True statement.

1566
01:57:32,693 --> 01:57:33,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Allegedly.

1567
01:57:33,274 --> 01:57:34,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Anthrax, actually.

1568
01:57:35,556 --> 01:57:36,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Who doesn't like Anthrax?

1569
01:57:36,616 --> 01:57:39,399
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have to be in a certain mood for Anthrax.

1570
01:57:39,799 --> 01:57:40,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Anthrax is just fun.

1571
01:57:41,140 --> 01:57:42,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1572
01:57:43,782 --> 01:57:55,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, the developer Clay Entertainment that did Shank is doing a survival game called Don't Starve that has a closed beta available to those who pre-order the game for a whopping $7.

1573
01:57:57,133 --> 01:57:59,495
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear the closed beta is in Africa.

1574
01:58:00,544 --> 01:58:05,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Africa because that's a game that they play all the time don't starve

1575
01:58:07,356 --> 01:58:16,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, it's going to be $15 when it comes to Steam, so you're pretty much getting it for 77% off if you order it ahead of time.

1576
01:58:16,983 --> 01:58:20,986
[SPEAKER_05]: The demo is on the official site, so you can give it a try for free.

1577
01:58:21,406 --> 01:58:27,590
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about a gentleman scientist who has to go to the wilderness world of a demon, and he just doesn't starve.

1578
01:58:27,870 --> 01:58:30,893
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like Tokyo Jungle with Minecraft.

1579
01:58:30,913 --> 01:58:31,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Minecraft.

1580
01:58:33,402 --> 01:58:33,762
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.

1581
01:58:34,603 --> 01:58:35,824
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to buy it seven bucks.

1582
01:58:35,844 --> 01:58:36,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

1583
01:58:36,804 --> 01:58:37,805
[SPEAKER_05]: I can afford that.

1584
01:58:38,586 --> 01:58:39,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds cool.

1585
01:58:39,446 --> 01:58:39,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1586
01:58:40,467 --> 01:58:40,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it?

1587
01:58:41,868 --> 01:58:42,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Indeed.

1588
01:58:42,629 --> 01:58:43,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to break things?

1589
01:58:43,649 --> 01:58:45,010
[SPEAKER_02]: It's done.

1590
01:58:48,252 --> 01:58:48,533
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1591
01:58:48,593 --> 01:58:51,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's travel to the Fugle question of the week.

1592
01:58:51,295 --> 01:58:52,495
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the Fugle question of the week?

1593
01:58:52,976 --> 01:58:54,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook and Google Plus.

1594
01:58:54,917 --> 01:58:56,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Slam them together and you get Fugle.

1595
01:58:57,799 --> 01:59:00,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you removed the plus.

1596
01:59:06,144 --> 01:59:06,264
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1597
01:59:06,284 --> 01:59:06,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1598
01:59:29,048 --> 01:59:31,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is on Google Question of the Week.

1599
01:59:32,629 --> 01:59:36,210
[SPEAKER_02]: This is about the world ends with you getting announced for iOS to extremely missed reaction.

1600
01:59:36,631 --> 01:59:40,772
[SPEAKER_02]: What game would you actually like to see ported to mobile phones?

1601
01:59:40,972 --> 01:59:42,673
[SPEAKER_02]: iOS, Android, whatever your choice is.

1602
01:59:43,193 --> 01:59:47,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Or would you be perfectly happy if we never had another port of a classic game again?

1603
01:59:48,735 --> 01:59:51,376
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, we expect the listeners to give us a little bit of why.

1604
01:59:52,591 --> 01:59:55,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Panaxium said anything puzzle strategy or turn-based.

1605
01:59:55,992 --> 01:59:59,654
[SPEAKER_02]: The controls wouldn't suffer much, which is important for the smartphone transition.

1606
02:00:00,114 --> 02:00:03,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Those kinds of games would also be a lot easier to set aside with little notice.

1607
02:00:04,236 --> 02:00:05,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Revenge of the Titans would be a blast.

1608
02:00:07,498 --> 02:00:10,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Redertainment has a very get-off-my-lawn approach.

1609
02:00:11,161 --> 02:00:17,006
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened to the good old days when phones were phones, music players were music players, and gas cost under $2?

1610
02:00:19,868 --> 02:00:20,989
[SPEAKER_02]: That being said, Portal.

1611
02:00:22,190 --> 02:00:30,477
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to see the classic game Portal ported to mobiles just to see the spectacular ways that game would crash my phone and drain my battery like a vampire.

1612
02:00:30,977 --> 02:00:33,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yes, it is now a classic.

1613
02:00:33,599 --> 02:00:33,639
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1614
02:00:36,032 --> 02:00:37,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, 10 years from now.

1615
02:00:37,373 --> 02:00:39,015
[SPEAKER_05]: In 10 years, yeah, it'll be a classic.

1616
02:00:40,576 --> 02:00:44,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I shouldn't have said classic game in the question because I think Portal's a fine answer.

1617
02:00:44,659 --> 02:00:46,360
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, also Tetris.

1618
02:00:46,760 --> 02:00:49,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the version available now that required swiping.

1619
02:00:49,562 --> 02:00:54,006
[SPEAKER_02]: A version of Tetris with button-based controls that I can play on the go seems like a great idea to me.

1620
02:00:54,406 --> 02:00:58,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I remember the Tetris DS exists, but I want to play competitively and my Wi-Fi at home sucks.

1621
02:01:00,982 --> 02:01:05,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Jim replied saying I would love to see a port of Deja Vu utilizing the touch controls of course.

1622
02:01:06,623 --> 02:01:10,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember those old ass PC games like Shadow, was it Shadow Run?

1623
02:01:11,264 --> 02:01:12,684
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Shadow Run's the other game.

1624
02:01:12,764 --> 02:01:13,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Shadow Keep.

1625
02:01:14,524 --> 02:01:15,805
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the one that liked Loom, so.

1626
02:01:16,005 --> 02:01:16,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1627
02:01:16,685 --> 02:01:20,065
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I remember Deja Vu and then there was another one, The Uninvited or something like that.

1628
02:01:20,125 --> 02:01:24,586
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a whole trilogy of them that was on the NES and they were originally Mac games if I remember right.

1629
02:01:24,906 --> 02:01:25,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Shadow Gate.

1630
02:01:26,166 --> 02:01:26,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Shadow Gate.

1631
02:01:26,686 --> 02:01:28,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Shadow Gate was freaking hard.

1632
02:01:28,907 --> 02:01:29,287
[SPEAKER_02]: God.

1633
02:01:30,748 --> 02:01:57,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Shadowgate had an amazing soundtrack though oh my god I seriously have you ever done Shadowgate as the classic game of the week if not you really need to think about it I never really was a fan of Shadowgate to be honest I'm doing it a week you're gone then I'll do it I mean I know a lot of people like it can I play some epic music from Shadowgate real quick sure I just love the music in Shadowgate I like this music but then like the death music was really freaky

1634
02:02:00,649 --> 02:02:03,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, shit, I died.

1635
02:02:03,351 --> 02:02:09,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Harpsichord for Ness.

1636
02:02:09,496 --> 02:02:13,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to... Says Donkey Kong for iCade.

1637
02:02:14,159 --> 02:02:17,802
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the original April Fool's joke and it sold me on the iCade.

1638
02:02:18,222 --> 02:02:22,906
[SPEAKER_02]: If Nintendo ever released on iOS phones, it should start with their 80s arcade games.

1639
02:02:24,968 --> 02:02:25,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1640
02:02:26,249 --> 02:02:32,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft replied, despite me hating on the iOS port of The World Ends With You, I would really like to see Viva Pinata on mobile.

1641
02:02:32,954 --> 02:02:36,516
[SPEAKER_02]: The game is great to play for short amounts, and it will keep you really occupied playing it.

1642
02:02:36,877 --> 02:02:37,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1643
02:02:37,397 --> 02:02:41,200
[SPEAKER_02]: He takes an approach that's not about controls, but about the way we play games.

1644
02:02:41,780 --> 02:02:46,964
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe a game like Viva Pinata in short bursts is better suited for mobile phones.

1645
02:02:47,744 --> 02:02:49,766
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you feel about Animal Crossing on mobile phones?

1646
02:02:51,287 --> 02:02:52,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Monitoring my village.

1647
02:02:53,635 --> 02:02:55,536
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be crack That's a death joke Tiara

1648
02:03:20,723 --> 02:03:21,324
Hi Tiara!

1649
02:03:21,745 --> 02:03:24,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Geek-life.com Wonderful site, please visit it.

1650
02:03:25,190 --> 02:03:29,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiara from Geek-Life replies and says, this is Facebook now by the way,

1651
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:36,362
[SPEAKER_02]: They're already on every other type of console ever, so I'd love an iOS port of Final Fantasy 4 and Final Fantasy 6.

1652
02:03:37,302 --> 02:03:46,366
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the original Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy Tactics on my iPhone, and I love being able to play them when I'm on the subway or looking for something quiet to do while my hubby is working on law school stuff.

1653
02:03:46,766 --> 02:03:52,047
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great having old classics that I love at my fingertips without having to carry around anything larger than my phone.

1654
02:03:52,508 --> 02:03:59,490
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Tiara, you might already know this, but they did a really good port of Final Fantasy 3, the DS version that's on the iPhone.

1655
02:03:59,930 --> 02:04:00,711
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing that

1656
02:04:21,904 --> 02:04:23,865
[SPEAKER_02]: which I'm sure some people, not everybody's a fan of.

1657
02:04:24,185 --> 02:04:37,570
[SPEAKER_02]: And plus, I don't know, there was a lot I liked about the DS remake and there was a lot I just, it was just weird seeing the sprite-based game I used to love in the 3D environment was so weird.

1658
02:04:38,905 --> 02:04:42,108
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, I would love to see that opera scene from 6 redone.

1659
02:04:42,168 --> 02:04:42,448
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?

1660
02:04:42,788 --> 02:04:45,030
[SPEAKER_02]: There's things I'd like.

1661
02:04:46,271 --> 02:04:48,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Zether says, Time Crisis.

1662
02:04:48,593 --> 02:04:51,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Touch controls for a light gun game just sound right.

1663
02:04:51,355 --> 02:04:53,597
[SPEAKER_02]: That actually does sound like a really good idea.

1664
02:04:53,717 --> 02:04:54,518
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've already done that.

1665
02:04:55,390 --> 02:04:56,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they do Time Crisis?

1666
02:04:56,531 --> 02:04:57,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe they did.

1667
02:04:57,251 --> 02:04:58,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, maybe Zether needs to go check the store.

1668
02:04:58,832 --> 02:04:59,773
[SPEAKER_05]: How about Point Blank then?

1669
02:05:00,734 --> 02:05:02,054
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Point Blank?

1670
02:05:02,115 --> 02:05:03,716
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say Point Blank would be awesome.

1671
02:05:03,756 --> 02:05:04,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Great fucking suggestion.

1672
02:05:06,778 --> 02:05:14,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Nick M replies and says, I would love a port of the original Worms Armageddon, not a sequel because Team 7 has screwed up every Worms game since.

1673
02:05:14,583 --> 02:05:18,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I chose this game because the gameplay and fun factor would not be affected by touch controls.

1674
02:05:18,906 --> 02:05:19,366
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see that.

1675
02:05:19,866 --> 02:05:21,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there's Worms clones.

1676
02:05:21,087 --> 02:05:23,989
[SPEAKER_02]: There's got to be clones all over the marketplace already.

1677
02:05:26,511 --> 02:05:30,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Alan replied and said, troll answer, Steel Battalion.

1678
02:05:31,235 --> 02:05:32,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Serious answer.

1679
02:05:33,056 --> 02:05:37,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the Panzer Dragoon games would clean up nice and make great use of tilt controls.

1680
02:05:37,340 --> 02:05:38,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Res would be great too.

1681
02:05:38,901 --> 02:05:41,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Steer with tilt and drag finger for linking targets.

1682
02:05:41,763 --> 02:05:43,465
[SPEAKER_02]: That's surprisingly not a bad idea.

1683
02:05:43,885 --> 02:05:44,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job, Alan.

1684
02:05:45,872 --> 02:05:48,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt replied, Matt J replied on Facebook with a no.

1685
02:05:48,893 --> 02:05:49,993
[SPEAKER_02]: We're finally seeing some no's.

1686
02:06:07,757 --> 02:06:12,079
[SPEAKER_02]: which specific hardware in mind just don't translate well to the ever-changing mobile platforms.

1687
02:06:12,559 --> 02:06:14,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with what some have said.

1688
02:06:14,360 --> 02:06:15,701
[SPEAKER_02]: The World Ends With You is worth $20.

1689
02:06:16,801 --> 02:06:18,342
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth $20 on the DS.

1690
02:06:18,462 --> 02:06:20,423
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not worth $2 on iOS.

1691
02:06:20,783 --> 02:06:22,444
[SPEAKER_02]: It will not be as good of an experience.

1692
02:06:23,004 --> 02:06:24,805
[SPEAKER_02]: A good example is Grand Theft Auto 3.

1693
02:06:25,485 --> 02:06:26,626
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it for my iPad.

1694
02:06:26,706 --> 02:06:30,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I've yet to beat the very first mission for the horrible car controls just drive me nuts.

1695
02:06:31,128 --> 02:06:33,489
[SPEAKER_02]: I beat the same game years back on the PC.

1696
02:06:33,749 --> 02:06:34,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Loved it.

1697
02:06:34,389 --> 02:06:37,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just glad I only paid a buck for Grand Theft 3 Eios.

1698
02:06:38,158 --> 02:06:39,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they ever do Dragon's Lair?

1699
02:06:40,564 --> 02:06:40,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1700
02:06:41,025 --> 02:06:41,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they did.

1701
02:06:41,948 --> 02:06:43,572
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I was just thinking that one would be perfect.

1702
02:06:44,402 --> 02:06:48,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to quickly go through some of these other ones, just read kind of the game or whatever.

1703
02:06:49,525 --> 02:06:57,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Haseo Sumirogaro replied and said, no, in a nutshell, because IOS will fuck it up like they fuck up most games.

1704
02:06:58,331 --> 02:07:05,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Loco Poco replied saying, a mobile version of the adventure game, The Neverhood, point and click adventure games would be great ported.

1705
02:07:05,515 --> 02:07:09,077
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's not happy about the Square Enix World's Ends With You remake.

1706
02:07:10,038 --> 02:07:12,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Stan replied, a new chapter to the Space Channel 5 series.

1707
02:07:14,264 --> 02:07:15,846
[SPEAKER_02]: for iOS or for anything.

1708
02:07:17,448 --> 02:07:21,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Hitstun said Missile Command and Crystal Castles work great on multi-touch phones.

1709
02:07:21,853 --> 02:07:24,375
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they do have that in the Atari thing.

1710
02:07:24,415 --> 02:07:28,920
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he said, I think he knows that because he says they work great on multi-touch phones.

1711
02:07:28,940 --> 02:07:29,882
[SPEAKER_04]: What about Marble Madness?

1712
02:07:30,748 --> 02:07:31,789
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good idea too.

1713
02:07:32,510 --> 02:07:36,114
[SPEAKER_02]: He does say more faithful ports of classic trackball games.

1714
02:07:36,755 --> 02:07:37,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Marble Madness.

1715
02:07:37,595 --> 02:07:37,996
[SPEAKER_02]: There he is.

1716
02:07:38,076 --> 02:07:39,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Marble Madness, he says.

1717
02:07:39,337 --> 02:07:40,378
[SPEAKER_02]: An arcade perfect port.

1718
02:07:40,699 --> 02:07:42,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Capcom Bowling would be a natural too.

1719
02:07:43,322 --> 02:07:47,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we could get a port for the Japanese only Sega Sonic the Hedgehog.

1720
02:07:49,941 --> 02:07:51,842
[SPEAKER_05]: and lastly... There's a game called Manic Marble.

1721
02:07:52,122 --> 02:07:54,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly, I'm not sure what Clover Nikon means by this comment.

1722
02:07:54,604 --> 02:07:56,925
[SPEAKER_02]: LucasArts Outlaws First Person Shooter.

1723
02:07:57,185 --> 02:07:58,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that a game LucasArts did?

1724
02:07:58,326 --> 02:07:59,607
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the game Outlaws.

1725
02:07:59,767 --> 02:08:02,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a LucasArts game that I'm just not ringing a bell?

1726
02:08:02,328 --> 02:08:11,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when I think LucasArts, I think of the old strategy games like Loom and Indiana Jones and shit and Maniac Mansion and all that.

1727
02:08:12,114 --> 02:08:12,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking right now.

1728
02:08:13,655 --> 02:08:19,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I'm sure the chatterers at live.vognetwork.com will be happy to correct me in a minute.

1729
02:08:21,940 --> 02:08:22,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking right now.

1730
02:08:23,801 --> 02:08:24,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1731
02:08:26,063 --> 02:08:26,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Outlaws.

1732
02:08:26,603 --> 02:08:26,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1733
02:08:27,064 --> 02:08:28,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Shooter game for the Commodore 64.

1734
02:08:28,565 --> 02:08:29,826
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be damned.

1735
02:08:30,306 --> 02:08:32,227
[SPEAKER_02]: 1985 and 1997 there were different releases.

1736
02:08:32,888 --> 02:08:33,708
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the one.

1737
02:08:33,728 --> 02:08:35,650
[SPEAKER_02]: The 97 release must be the one he's talking about.

1738
02:08:36,110 --> 02:08:37,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it was LucasArts and the Jedi Engine.

1739
02:08:38,292 --> 02:08:39,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know this game at all.

1740
02:08:40,613 --> 02:08:41,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I want to look it up.

1741
02:08:41,914 --> 02:08:42,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it Jedi Outlaws?

1742
02:08:43,815 --> 02:08:43,976
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1743
02:08:44,236 --> 02:08:45,657
[SPEAKER_02]: It was done in that Jedi Engine.

1744
02:08:46,077 --> 02:08:46,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me look.

1745
02:08:46,357 --> 02:08:49,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I remember they had the first person shooter one that was from 1997 or whatever.

1746
02:08:49,740 --> 02:08:49,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

1747
02:08:52,421 --> 02:08:57,065
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking it up right now, except YouTube won't work, so I'll have to look later.

1748
02:08:59,508 --> 02:09:03,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anything quickly you guys would like to see on iOS or not?

1749
02:09:05,013 --> 02:09:05,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Second point blank.

1750
02:09:08,957 --> 02:09:10,238
[SPEAKER_05]: A real marble madness, I guess.

1751
02:09:10,771 --> 02:09:12,531
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like a Marble Madness sequel type of thing.

1752
02:09:13,592 --> 02:09:17,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe a better version of Silent Hill and Metal Gear Solid, those shooters.

1753
02:09:18,473 --> 02:09:22,394
[SPEAKER_02]: On iOS though, I can't see Silent Hill on iOS.

1754
02:09:22,454 --> 02:09:25,175
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a Silent Hill iPhone game and it was terrible.

1755
02:09:25,215 --> 02:09:27,956
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like the old Sega shooter games.

1756
02:09:28,176 --> 02:09:29,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Any of the Sega shooters would be pretty cool.

1757
02:09:30,016 --> 02:09:30,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Like...

1758
02:09:34,889 --> 02:09:47,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Gunblade Gunblade would be fucking awesome also any of the shooters any of their arcade stuff

1759
02:09:47,577 --> 02:09:49,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I knew the chatters wouldn't let me down.

1760
02:09:49,978 --> 02:09:52,680
[SPEAKER_02]: VXJSNXV says, Outlaws was quite fun indeed.

1761
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:56,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I bought it at some point and sucked at it a lot for some reason.

1762
02:09:57,142 --> 02:10:03,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Dungeon Buster says, Outlaws cutscenes had the same animated look that Full Throttles did, only stylized for a western adventure.

1763
02:10:05,086 --> 02:10:08,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Taiki in our chat reminds us there was Marble Madness 2.

1764
02:10:08,328 --> 02:10:09,449
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called Marble Man.

1765
02:10:09,689 --> 02:10:10,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Marble Man.

1766
02:10:10,609 --> 02:10:12,010
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that ever actually came out though.

1767
02:10:12,030 --> 02:10:13,091
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a prototype thing.

1768
02:10:13,131 --> 02:10:14,752
[SPEAKER_02]: One of those legendary games, right?

1769
02:10:16,052 --> 02:10:18,253
[SPEAKER_02]: S2100 Matt says, this sounds like a listless topic.

1770
02:10:19,374 --> 02:10:21,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe next time.

1771
02:10:21,435 --> 02:10:22,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get some more news out of the way.

1772
02:10:22,676 --> 02:10:22,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

1773
02:10:23,836 --> 02:10:29,759
[SPEAKER_08]: It's unfortunate, but Nintendo Power is coming to an end.

1774
02:10:30,240 --> 02:10:33,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Their last issue will be running in December.

1775
02:10:33,361 --> 02:10:38,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, they just have no plans on continuing any further than that.

1776
02:10:39,144 --> 02:10:39,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Before, they were...

1777
02:10:41,105 --> 02:10:48,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Running it through in-house stuff, but then it was forwarded to future publishing in 2007.

1778
02:10:54,811 --> 02:10:57,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Print media is just not as popular anymore as it used to be.

1779
02:10:58,733 --> 02:11:02,374
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, Nintendo is going to be getting their news out slightly differently.

1780
02:11:02,815 --> 02:11:04,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I just say this real quick about Nintendo Power, though?

1781
02:11:05,136 --> 02:11:07,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I saw a lot of the people on Twitter and Facebook were saying like,

1782
02:11:08,537 --> 02:11:09,958
[SPEAKER_02]: This makes me really sad.

1783
02:11:10,018 --> 02:11:11,998
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to love this magazine as a kid.

1784
02:11:12,058 --> 02:11:15,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when I had Nintendo Power and it's just kind of funny.

1785
02:11:16,580 --> 02:11:25,383
[SPEAKER_02]: And while it is sad in a way, I think you're really sad that you're getting older because nobody said, I'm really sad it's going away because I'm currently subscribed.

1786
02:11:26,543 --> 02:11:27,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody said that.

1787
02:11:28,244 --> 02:11:32,305
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people are just sad because it's a relic from their childhood.

1788
02:11:32,365 --> 02:11:33,185
[SPEAKER_02]: It's no longer there.

1789
02:11:33,265 --> 02:11:36,506
[SPEAKER_02]: But hello, they went bankrupt because nobody was still subscribed.

1790
02:11:36,806 --> 02:11:38,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody in here subscribed to Nintendo Power currently?

1791
02:11:39,127 --> 02:11:39,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

1792
02:11:40,388 --> 02:11:43,489
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's be real, it's changed hands over the years and so forth.

1793
02:11:43,509 --> 02:11:44,909
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no more Howard and Nestor.

1794
02:11:45,566 --> 02:11:45,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

1795
02:11:46,488 --> 02:11:49,534
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's tough for a print magazine to survive right now.

1796
02:11:50,196 --> 02:11:50,596
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tough.

1797
02:11:51,278 --> 02:11:52,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have loved for an e-book.

1798
02:11:52,300 --> 02:11:53,723
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes me so sad.

1799
02:11:53,803 --> 02:11:56,348
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just... Because that's like what I went to school for.

1800
02:11:56,368 --> 02:11:57,010
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but...

1801
02:11:58,383 --> 02:12:00,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to evolve into the digital format.

1802
02:12:01,004 --> 02:12:03,526
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Wii U tablet, you could have flipped through pages or something.

1803
02:12:03,546 --> 02:12:04,366
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have been awesome.

1804
02:12:05,587 --> 02:12:13,651
[SPEAKER_08]: So to get the word out about the Wii U release date and pricing, September 13th, they're going to be doing another press event.

1805
02:12:14,151 --> 02:12:15,191
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to be talking about it.

1806
02:12:15,291 --> 02:12:16,752
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be held in New York City.

1807
02:12:17,813 --> 02:12:22,275
[SPEAKER_08]: And the least that's assumed what they're going to be talking about is the Wii U pricing and release date.

1808
02:12:24,559 --> 02:12:27,001
[SPEAKER_08]: 249, 3349, and November 18th.

1809
02:12:29,823 --> 02:12:30,323
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see, Loki.

1810
02:12:30,343 --> 02:12:31,324
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just a guess.

1811
02:12:31,904 --> 02:12:33,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Allegedly.

1812
02:12:34,246 --> 02:12:37,368
[SPEAKER_08]: The titles that were released on the 20th now move to the 13th.

1813
02:12:37,408 --> 02:12:40,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we'll see.

1814
02:12:41,011 --> 02:12:41,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving on.

1815
02:12:42,031 --> 02:12:44,073
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember Adventure on the Atari 2600?

1816
02:12:45,033 --> 02:12:50,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the days of the Atari 2600 where we had games like Baseball, Basketball,

1817
02:12:51,798 --> 02:12:52,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Video Pinball

1818
02:13:11,269 --> 02:13:18,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, also, Adventure was just kind of a neat little game that, you know, a lot of games, like, you see things in Adventure that influence the Legend of Zelda, for real.

1819
02:13:18,791 --> 02:13:22,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, a lot of what comes to Legend of Zelda was in Adventure on the Atari 2600.

1820
02:13:23,152 --> 02:13:25,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, it has its fans.

1821
02:13:25,553 --> 02:13:29,614
[SPEAKER_02]: And more than 30 years later, we're looking at yet another sequel to Adventure.

1822
02:13:30,054 --> 02:13:36,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I believe there was a prototype some time ago of Adventure 2, but that's not part of the canon that we have now.

1823
02:13:36,856 --> 02:13:51,780
[SPEAKER_02]: What we do have is that in 2009, there was Evil Magician Returns, which was programmed by ByteKnight from the Atari Age forums, and he did this in 2009, and this is in reference to the unseen antagonist who stole and hid the chalice in the original game.

1824
02:13:51,820 --> 02:13:55,921
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't have the rights to call it Adventure 2, but he could call it Evil Magician.

1825
02:13:56,977 --> 02:13:58,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray, generic bad guy.

1826
02:13:58,558 --> 02:14:01,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now, Evil Magician returns too.

1827
02:14:02,879 --> 02:14:03,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah!

1828
02:14:04,020 --> 02:14:05,080
[SPEAKER_02]: He's back, bitch.

1829
02:14:06,641 --> 02:14:09,642
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to overcome both him and his apprentice.

1830
02:14:10,062 --> 02:14:12,103
[SPEAKER_02]: They are personally guarding the chalice.

1831
02:14:12,563 --> 02:14:17,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Keys, mazes, flickering grottos, and bats.

1832
02:14:19,472 --> 02:14:20,574
[SPEAKER_02]: and it has come out.

1833
02:14:20,674 --> 02:14:22,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is an adventure game.

1834
02:14:22,237 --> 02:14:25,863
[SPEAKER_02]: There has to be an Easter egg in there somewhere, so be on the lookout for that.

1835
02:14:26,243 --> 02:14:28,227
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I gotta say this.

1836
02:14:28,687 --> 02:14:31,853
[SPEAKER_02]: For an Atari 2600 game, the graphics are pretty sweet.

1837
02:14:35,134 --> 02:14:35,334
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura?

1838
02:15:03,695 --> 02:15:05,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Paragon System Mass Effect

1839
02:15:22,471 --> 02:15:27,275
[SPEAKER_05]: has 100 additional levels for you to push through once you meet the current level max.

1840
02:15:27,756 --> 02:15:35,523
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming in update 1.0.4 and basically all of your experience that you get after 60 will be put into your Paragon levels.

1841
02:15:35,963 --> 02:15:42,949
[SPEAKER_05]: So it gives you a boost in your core stats and an extra 3% boost in magic and gold find.

1842
02:15:45,330 --> 02:15:58,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, there is this, trying to find where exactly it was, the Nephilim Valor bonuses will also give a 15% boost in experience towards the Paragon levels per stack.

1843
02:15:59,593 --> 02:15:59,894
[SPEAKER_05]: So fun.

1844
02:16:01,078 --> 02:16:05,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that they made the end game more exciting by basically adding 100 levels.

1845
02:16:06,421 --> 02:16:06,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much.

1846
02:16:07,041 --> 02:16:09,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently there's some game balance things and other things they did too.

1847
02:16:09,843 --> 02:16:11,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we talked about this on Horde House a little bit.

1848
02:16:12,064 --> 02:16:15,706
[SPEAKER_02]: And Extifer has been playing a lot of Diablo lately because he's not really playing WoW right now.

1849
02:16:16,047 --> 02:16:18,748
[SPEAKER_02]: But him and his partner play a lot, a lot of Diablo.

1850
02:16:19,469 --> 02:16:22,090
[SPEAKER_02]: And he says it's great that the game balancing and everything is great.

1851
02:16:22,230 --> 02:16:24,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Me, I haven't touched Diablo since like the first month it came out.

1852
02:16:24,732 --> 02:16:24,852
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

1853
02:16:25,672 --> 02:16:31,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I need to take a second look after WoW and Guild Wars and all that other stuff.

1854
02:16:31,794 --> 02:16:32,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Free with Blood Pact.

1855
02:16:33,895 --> 02:16:35,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Which you can't sign up for anymore.

1856
02:16:36,576 --> 02:16:38,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a couple more news stories for you guys in the mailbag.

1857
02:16:39,097 --> 02:16:42,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is where the emails go.

1858
02:16:42,498 --> 02:16:43,479
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, some more stories.

1859
02:16:45,039 --> 02:16:45,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1860
02:16:46,580 --> 02:16:47,880
[SPEAKER_08]: This is kind of interesting.

1861
02:16:47,900 --> 02:16:54,783
[SPEAKER_08]: You remember that whole Peter Molyneux thing that they were doing on the iOS platform where it was basically this

1862
02:16:55,652 --> 02:16:58,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Curiosity was what the game was called.

1863
02:16:58,674 --> 02:17:08,480
[SPEAKER_08]: It was kind of controversial because you can buy in-game things to help you chip away at this cube faster, including one piece that's $50,000 or $5,000.

1864
02:17:09,060 --> 02:17:12,663
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyways, that game's been delayed to September.

1865
02:17:13,303 --> 02:17:17,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, because it's been delayed, I'm not sure if this is the reason, but

1866
02:17:18,626 --> 02:17:26,732
[SPEAKER_08]: They had to change their title because you may remember there was a certain program from NASA that landed a rover on Mars named Curiosity.

1867
02:17:29,113 --> 02:17:30,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that was kind of bad.

1868
02:17:30,574 --> 02:17:33,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that wasn't bad.

1869
02:17:33,296 --> 02:17:36,939
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it was bad for Curiosity because they couldn't use a name anymore.

1870
02:17:36,959 --> 02:17:39,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Bad for Peter Molyneux, but fuck him.

1871
02:17:39,160 --> 02:17:43,583
[SPEAKER_08]: So now it's not just Curiosity, it's Curiosity What's in the Cube.

1872
02:17:44,384 --> 02:17:46,285
[SPEAKER_08]: What's Inside the Cube is what it's called.

1873
02:17:46,305 --> 02:17:47,265
[SPEAKER_08]: What's in the box?

1874
02:17:49,167 --> 02:17:50,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me what's in the box!

1875
02:17:53,492 --> 02:17:54,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty much, yeah.

1876
02:17:55,034 --> 02:17:55,814
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't get seven.

1877
02:17:57,917 --> 02:17:59,178
[SPEAKER_08]: So they have that going on right now.

1878
02:17:59,498 --> 02:18:04,444
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta wonder though, when is the next Apple announcement for iOS 6?

1879
02:18:04,504 --> 02:18:06,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that supposed to be in September sometime?

1880
02:18:06,526 --> 02:18:08,268
[SPEAKER_02]: The iPhone 5 announcement is happening.

1881
02:18:08,368 --> 02:18:09,569
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1882
02:18:38,294 --> 02:18:40,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought they were able to fix that.

1883
02:18:40,276 --> 02:18:43,860
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought they patched it somewhere on the back end or something.

1884
02:18:43,920 --> 02:18:45,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Chiggers in our chat says, dick in a box.

1885
02:18:47,583 --> 02:18:49,826
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be fucking hilarious.

1886
02:18:50,066 --> 02:18:56,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Peter Molyneux would gain my ultimate respect if what's in the box, my dick.

1887
02:18:58,674 --> 02:18:59,816
[SPEAKER_02]: That would make headlines.

1888
02:19:05,197 --> 02:19:06,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel short-changed.

1889
02:19:06,798 --> 02:19:07,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving on.

1890
02:19:34,758 --> 02:19:37,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami is set to shake the industry.

1891
02:19:40,287 --> 02:19:42,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Goddammit, what is wrong with our web tonight?

1892
02:19:42,128 --> 02:19:42,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, nothing's working.

1893
02:19:42,768 --> 02:19:44,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I remember this story from earlier, though.

1894
02:19:45,130 --> 02:19:48,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami is... I forget who said it at an event.

1895
02:19:48,291 --> 02:19:49,412
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say it was Kojima.

1896
02:19:49,772 --> 02:19:58,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody involved with Kojima Productions because there's an announcement coming up for Metal Gear's 25th anniversary and they were quoted as saying... It was Ken Mondaza.

1897
02:19:58,177 --> 02:19:58,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1898
02:19:59,017 --> 02:20:00,138
[SPEAKER_02]: With Kojima Productions.

1899
02:20:00,178 --> 02:20:00,798
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only that, right?

1900
02:20:01,078 --> 02:20:08,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that was quoted in saying that the industry is going to get shaken up.

1901
02:20:08,522 --> 02:20:16,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they have a lot of things to look forward to next week, not just for fans, but I think the industry is going to be shook by what we're going to be able to present here.

1902
02:20:19,411 --> 02:20:21,893
[SPEAKER_02]: At least it's not a Frogger game.

1903
02:20:24,716 --> 02:20:25,476
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I know.

1904
02:20:25,577 --> 02:20:26,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I finally got it here.

1905
02:20:26,718 --> 02:20:27,118
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

1906
02:20:27,864 --> 02:20:28,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1907
02:20:28,424 --> 02:20:31,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, my internet's working just fine, but... I don't know.

1908
02:20:31,726 --> 02:20:34,127
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because I stream the show and all that off this computer, too.

1909
02:20:34,147 --> 02:20:42,090
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, we will find out what the shakedown is August 30th when this event, it's the 25th anniversary event, will take place there at Tokyo Midtown.

1910
02:20:44,648 --> 02:20:45,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, whatever.

1911
02:20:47,069 --> 02:20:47,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

1912
02:20:48,389 --> 02:20:50,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get to the mailbag.

1913
02:20:50,330 --> 02:20:51,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Every week you guys send us emails.

1914

[SPEAKER_05]: Sticky!

1917
02:21:00,074 --> 02:21:01,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless they're 80s metal bands.

1919
02:21:25,579 --> 02:21:32,361
[SPEAKER_05]: If you were stuck on a desert island with your sexy partner and could bring only one game to play, what's the sexiest game you can think of to bring?

1920
02:21:33,982 --> 02:21:35,503

[SPEAKER_05]: Choo-choo, motherfuckers.

1923
02:21:40,744 --> 02:21:45,346
[SPEAKER_05]: You wouldn't have any electricity on a deserted island?

1924
02:21:45,726 --> 02:21:48,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's make believe there's a bike that will power it.

1925
02:21:49,938 --> 02:21:58,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, if the professor from Gilligan's Island could get... It would be something on the internet so I would have net gaming and GPS.

1926
02:21:58,808 --> 02:22:03,113
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be something on my phone so I could turn on my where is my phone feature and people could find me that way.

1927
02:22:06,380 --> 02:22:07,281
[SPEAKER_02]: You're so not fun.

[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if it's with a bicycle, then it's gotta be Prop Cycle.

1931
02:22:12,764 --> 02:22:13,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I added the bicycle.

1932
02:22:13,925 --> 02:22:15,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Go back to the original question.

1933
02:22:15,546 --> 02:22:17,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Sexiest game to take to the desert island?

02:22:57,974 --> 02:22:58,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Too late.

[SPEAKER_05]: Hump master.

[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1947
02:23:08,174 --> 02:23:09,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Greetings, Orange Lounge Radio.

1948
02:23:09,775 --> 02:23:16,059
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a message from Mahaseo Sumiragawa regarding Final Fantasy and the rampant cases of disappearing acts.

1949
02:23:16,279 --> 02:23:17,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we... Oh, this is what we covered.

1950
02:23:18,161 --> 02:23:23,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so six years ago, Square Enix announced Final Fantasy Versus XIII as part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis.

1951
02:23:24,365 --> 02:23:28,408
[SPEAKER_05]: And since then, they put out a few trailers talking about the stories a bit.

1952
02:23:28,908 --> 02:23:31,190
[SPEAKER_05]: And six years later, there's nothing because it came out in Japan.

1953
02:23:31,210 --> 02:23:31,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1954
02:23:32,210 --> 02:23:36,593
[SPEAKER_05]: There hasn't even been present at E3, but that's not my point.

1955
02:23:37,414 --> 02:23:43,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, last November, Square announced that they were going to release Final Fantasy X again, and needless to say, I squeed my voice hoarse.

1956
02:23:44,198 --> 02:23:46,079
[SPEAKER_05]: After that, nothing, so this brings me to my point.

1957
02:23:46,139 --> 02:23:48,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this going to be a trend with Square?

1958
02:23:48,921 --> 02:23:53,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Announce the games that won't come out for years and years, and let's face it, look at what happened to Duke Nukem Forever.

1959
02:23:54,384 --> 02:23:55,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that game was crap.

1960
02:23:56,425 --> 02:24:02,029
[SPEAKER_05]: one last note to Lokis I'm aware you're smart with modding and computers, correct?

1961
02:24:02,290 --> 02:24:10,535
[SPEAKER_05]: okay, so two questions firstly my boyfriend's computer doesn't have the programs installed onto his computer, is there a way to fix that?

1962
02:24:10,756 --> 02:24:23,865
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't it says sorry for bad grammar but honestly the grammar is so bad that I can hardly make heads or tails of the lines doesn't have the programs installed I guess to mod?

1963
02:24:23,885 --> 02:24:23,945
[SPEAKER_05]: mod?

1964
02:24:24,588 --> 02:24:26,273
[SPEAKER_08]: and install the programs.

1965
02:24:26,554 --> 02:24:31,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do you recommend to go buy a new hard drive for a PS3 and what's the largest size you can get?

1966
02:24:32,794 --> 02:24:35,536
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember what it's called, Western Digital or something like that.

1967
02:24:57,815 --> 02:25:18,256
[SPEAKER_08]: just look online for hard drives that will fit I think you have to watch out when you get really big hard drive sizes the actual hard drive itself gets thicker and it might not fit in the actual bay that they have so you have to kind of watch what you can fit in there at least I know that's the case with the Xbox when you're modding that

1968
02:25:19,016 --> 02:25:22,778
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as modding, I'm assuming they're asking about modding the PS3 stuff.

1969
02:25:23,578 --> 02:25:24,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Just download the apps.

1970
02:25:24,879 --> 02:25:27,060
[SPEAKER_08]: You may have to check out some of the websites.

1971
02:25:27,720 --> 02:25:32,922
[SPEAKER_08]: There's dashhacks.com or .net or something.

1972
02:25:32,962 --> 02:25:34,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Dashhacks is the website.

1973
02:25:34,363 --> 02:25:42,146
[SPEAKER_08]: They have information about doing hacks on PlayStation 3, PSP, Vita, when there's that stuff available online.

1974
02:25:42,546 --> 02:25:43,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1975
02:26:02,463 --> 02:26:03,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so next email

1976
02:26:28,653 --> 02:26:31,155
[SPEAKER_05]: I am an air traffic controller, airport hero.

1977
02:26:55,168 --> 02:27:03,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Unlike games with similar names on iOS, such as Flight Control or Pocket Planes, this is a real puzzle game based on the very real intricacies of air traffic control.

1978
02:27:03,610 --> 02:27:16,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, you play the role of the five people in the ATC tower at the same time, telling pilots what routes to take coming into and out of the airport, giving permission to land and take off, giving taxing instructions, and confirming flight plans.

1979
02:27:17,534 --> 02:27:18,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1980
02:27:33,337 --> 02:27:34,157
[SPEAKER_05]: You Jerk You Jerk

1981
02:27:57,503 --> 02:28:25,827
[SPEAKER_05]: oh well you did say wish you were here at the end so I can't be too mean bring me back something Duffy and last email this says hello OLR after a long time I finally got to play Binary Domain I wish some interest I had some interest in it but I somehow never compelled to buy it thinking it would just be another shooter my girlfriend got it for me a couple days ago and I started playing and just could not stop this game is awesome I was told to sing it by the way

1982
02:28:27,677 --> 02:28:28,177
[SPEAKER_02]: And you did.

1983
02:28:28,377 --> 02:28:28,758
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did.

1984
02:28:29,878 --> 02:28:30,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, it's not perfect.

1985
02:28:30,918 --> 02:28:33,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Controls aren't always spot on and the voice recognition isn't very good.

1986
02:28:34,280 --> 02:28:39,802
[SPEAKER_05]: But the deep story, future Tokyo environment, graphics, voice acting, and sound make it a very good game.

1987
02:28:40,262 --> 02:28:46,505
[SPEAKER_05]: You can literally shoot robots to pieces and it isn't that same gritty and brown world you see in countless other games.

1988
02:28:47,005 --> 02:28:50,727
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the very first game that gave me goosebumps while playing the end sequence.

1989
02:28:51,427 --> 02:28:53,688
[SPEAKER_05]: That's saying a lot when I get emotional about a game.

1990
02:28:54,148 --> 02:28:56,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Sega should be deeply ashamed for not promoting this game more.

1991
02:28:56,889 --> 02:29:00,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Binary Domain, Vanquish Bayonetta are all games that deserve better.

1992
02:29:00,790 --> 02:29:03,371
[SPEAKER_05]: When you get the chance, buy this as it is very cheap.

1993
02:29:03,751 --> 02:29:05,171
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I have to say at this time.

1994
02:29:05,391 --> 02:29:08,752
[SPEAKER_05]: As always, thanks a lot for making an episode of OLR every week.

1995
02:29:09,072 --> 02:29:10,113
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are amazing.

1996
02:29:10,473 --> 02:29:13,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Yours truly, I'm just going to say first name, Fabrice from Belgium.

1997
02:29:14,674 --> 02:29:16,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, international emails.

1998
02:29:16,394 --> 02:29:17,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

1999
02:29:18,415 --> 02:29:19,235
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to go to Belgium.

2000
02:29:20,716 --> 02:29:21,896
[SPEAKER_05]: And not for the waffles, Loki.

2001
02:29:24,798 --> 02:29:27,139
[SPEAKER_02]: but you would have to have a waffle while you're there just to see.

2002
02:29:27,719 --> 02:29:29,579
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I would have to have chocolate.

2003
02:29:29,959 --> 02:29:31,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Chocolate and Trapeze Dale.

2004
02:29:31,440 --> 02:29:31,900
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

2005
02:29:31,960 --> 02:29:32,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying.

2006
02:29:32,700 --> 02:29:33,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Chimay.

2007
02:29:33,420 --> 02:29:35,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Chimay comes from Belgium and Chimay is fucking amazing.

2008
02:29:36,801 --> 02:29:42,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, it's time for us to get a little bit angsty here with the FUs of the week.

2009
02:29:44,043 --> 02:29:45,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's my angst music?

2010
02:30:01,039 --> 02:30:03,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I guess fuck you to concrete.

2011
02:30:03,960 --> 02:30:09,383
[SPEAKER_05]: And the person in the Toyota who didn't use their turn signal at all and then tried to stop in front of me?

2012
02:30:09,583 --> 02:30:10,483
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you're a dickface.

2013
02:30:11,704 --> 02:30:15,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and, uh, buh buh buh buh buh.

2014
02:30:16,229 --> 02:30:16,930
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't know.

2015
02:30:16,990 --> 02:30:21,414
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess me for changing my schedule to 7 in the morning.

2016
02:30:21,814 --> 02:30:28,140
[SPEAKER_05]: But at least I'm only out 30 minutes of sleep, and I don't have to deal with crap traffic in the morning.

2017
02:30:28,801 --> 02:30:31,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I really want a bagel, but no wheat.

2018
02:30:31,383 --> 02:30:32,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Wheat is bad for me.

2019
02:30:33,926 --> 02:30:35,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Bagels are so good, though.

2020
02:30:35,567 --> 02:30:35,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2021
02:30:35,828 --> 02:30:36,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Hush.

2022
02:30:36,829 --> 02:30:37,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

2023
02:30:38,537 --> 02:30:42,660
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess the only really Effie that I can think of would be the Effie 2.

2024
02:30:43,161 --> 02:30:50,327
[SPEAKER_08]: The person that was in front of me while I was coming into your apartment complex, they decided to park in front of the gate.

2025
02:30:50,748 --> 02:30:53,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Like they drove through the gate and then parked right there.

2026
02:30:54,011 --> 02:30:54,251
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like...

2027
02:30:54,691 --> 02:30:55,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you kidding me?

2028
02:30:55,811 --> 02:30:58,192
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's just sitting there, I honk, he looks at his mirror.

2029
02:30:58,972 --> 02:30:59,512
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

2030
02:31:00,513 --> 02:31:03,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I guess I'll pull forward a little bit.

2031
02:31:03,593 --> 02:31:06,834
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, dude, you're in the fucking middle of the goddamn entrance.

2032
02:31:06,874 --> 02:31:08,675
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like... Selfishly inconsiderate.

2033
02:31:08,695 --> 02:31:09,375
[SPEAKER_02]: What in the hell?

2034
02:31:09,495 --> 02:31:10,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Find a parking space.

2035
02:31:10,315 --> 02:31:13,016
[SPEAKER_05]: People have a sense of entitlement and don't think there's anybody else in the world.

2036
02:31:14,048 --> 02:31:16,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what's wrong with these people That's it

2037
02:31:28,323 --> 02:31:30,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily the stream is staying up and that's the most important thing.

2038
02:31:30,664 --> 02:31:32,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I just hope Skype will stay up as well.

2039
02:31:32,745 --> 02:31:33,926
[SPEAKER_05]: It was doing the same thing at my house.

2040
02:31:34,366 --> 02:31:43,752
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, I can't do, I'm really upset because somebody had a funny joke earlier when Jim Sally sent the email about what sexy games do you want to see on the sexy island.

2041
02:31:44,392 --> 02:31:51,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Tetsuya in chat said Miss Nude World 96, which was a perfect excuse for me to play the everybody move your body clip.

2042
02:31:51,616 --> 02:31:53,577
[SPEAKER_02]: But thanks to the web errors, I can't get the clip up.

2043
02:31:56,153 --> 02:32:00,760
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to the web for making me lose out on the funny hate.

2044
02:32:02,843 --> 02:32:04,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Two more news stories, then phone calls.

2045
02:32:05,127 --> 02:32:05,748
[SPEAKER_02]: First, Loki.

2046
02:32:05,788 --> 02:32:08,392
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm even turning off everything on my iPhone just to see if it helps.

2047
02:32:09,153 --> 02:32:12,135
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a few demakes we should talk about.

2048
02:32:12,435 --> 02:32:14,116
[SPEAKER_08]: The first being Borderlands.

2049
02:32:14,216 --> 02:32:22,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Borderlands actually was demade into a 16-bit top-down shooter game for your browser, so you can check it out.

2050
02:32:23,122 --> 02:32:29,065
[SPEAKER_08]: They call it The Borderlands, and you can check it... I love this website.

2051
02:32:29,325 --> 02:32:34,489
[SPEAKER_08]: You can check it at www.wubwub.eu slash demake.php.

2052
02:32:34,749 --> 02:32:36,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Wubwubwubwubwub.

2053
02:32:37,550 --> 02:33:05,661
[SPEAKER_08]: it's just awesome so that's pretty cool and then since we were talking about Atari 2600 earlier somebody has decided to demake the Super Mario Brothers for the Atari 2600 now or at least it's done in the Atari 2600 style and he's got I guess a demo with level warp pipes, yellow blocks and flagpoles and I guess 15 levels up to 4.4 that's what he's hoping to do

2054
02:33:06,221 --> 02:33:08,662
[SPEAKER_08]: and have a Koopa Kid at the end of each world as a boss.

2055
02:33:10,683 --> 02:33:11,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty cool.

2056
02:33:11,183 --> 02:33:15,905
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you want to check that out, IndieGames.com's got the link for that.

2057
02:33:16,305 --> 02:33:17,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Or I guess AtariAge.

2058
02:33:17,446 --> 02:33:20,047
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised it took that long for a Super Mario demake.

2059
02:33:20,087 --> 02:33:21,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Surely this isn't the first.

2060
02:33:21,388 --> 02:33:22,828
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the most recent one.

2061
02:33:23,008 --> 02:33:31,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, if you go to the AtariAge forums, there's a bin file for your emulators.

2062
02:33:32,972 --> 02:33:43,122
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, if you ever saw the movie The King of Kong, you did not see Hank Chien in that movie, even though he is now the official world record holder of Donkey Kong.

2063
02:33:43,222 --> 02:33:44,303
[SPEAKER_02]: He came after the movie.

2064
02:33:44,323 --> 02:33:47,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank God that wasn't one of the titles for the contest, man.

2065
02:33:47,106 --> 02:33:48,147
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole back and forth.

2066
02:33:48,207 --> 02:33:48,387
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2067
02:33:50,288 --> 02:33:56,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God it wasn't because Hank Chen would have won it again because guess what?

2068
02:33:56,430 --> 02:33:58,011
[SPEAKER_02]: He broke his own record.

2069
02:33:58,751 --> 02:34:01,812
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to appreciate a guy who will keep challenging himself.

2070
02:34:02,292 --> 02:34:06,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's none of this, you know, Steve Weeby and all this stuff going on here.

2071
02:34:06,213 --> 02:34:07,834
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just, he's challenging himself.

2072
02:34:08,574 --> 02:34:33,685
[SPEAKER_02]: so he beat his previous record of 1,110,100 points the new record 1,127,700 points that's the new score from Hank Chien if you haven't heard that name of course he was the Donkey Kong world record holder before after that whole movie mess and all that stuff I believe what is it by day he's a plastic surgeon isn't he and that's how he can afford all these machines

2073
02:34:35,106 --> 02:35:00,438
[SPEAKER_02]: or a machine you pay him for a new well I noticed in this picture he's posing next to a Donkey Kong machine and there's a moon patrol machine in the background too now I don't know if that's because he's like at an arcade like maybe some type of publicity event because I know fun spot he's got way too much smug on his face I don't necessarily think it's smug some people just take interesting pictures machines aren't that terribly expensive it's only a hundred bucks I mean I mean that for arcade game that's not bad

2074
02:35:01,470 --> 02:35:13,498
[SPEAKER_02]: TheKongOff2 is where they gather the best Donkey Kong players at one location for glorious live competition.

2075
02:35:14,779 --> 02:35:21,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that they're saying he's going to be in it, but there's obviously a lot of pressure for him to show up, which would be pretty cool.

2076
02:35:22,323 --> 02:35:26,406
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt in our chatroom at chat.orangelandry Live.vognetwork.com says,

2077
02:35:30,393 --> 02:35:34,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Look guys, it was nine years of one particular website.

2078
02:35:34,300 --> 02:35:35,042
[SPEAKER_02]: And Billy Mitchell?

2079
02:35:35,483 --> 02:35:36,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero fucks given about him.

2080
02:35:37,727 --> 02:35:38,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Or his damn hot sauce.

2081
02:35:40,051 --> 02:35:41,273
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear the hot sauce isn't bad.

2082
02:35:42,075 --> 02:35:42,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

2083
02:35:43,772 --> 02:35:47,433
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that takes us to the Skype part of the show.

2084
02:35:48,473 --> 02:35:56,754
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the part of the show where we're going to open up the Skype lines at 1-877-GAME-OLR and take your phone calls live on the program.

2085
02:35:56,774 --> 02:36:01,095
[SPEAKER_02]: We will get to the Twitter as well, twitter.com slash OLR in just a moment.

2086
02:36:01,135 --> 02:36:02,556
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, we're going to go to the phones.

2087
02:36:02,836 --> 02:36:04,576
[SPEAKER_02]: And, oh, we already have a call on the line.

2088
02:36:04,636 --> 02:36:05,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to it.

2089
02:36:05,456 --> 02:36:06,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio.

2090
02:36:06,396 --> 02:36:06,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2091
02:36:07,276 --> 02:36:07,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, guys.

2092
02:36:07,717 --> 02:36:08,077
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Jason.

2093
02:36:08,337 --> 02:36:08,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Jason.

2094
02:36:09,017 --> 02:36:09,297
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?

2095
02:36:09,337 --> 02:36:09,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

2096
02:36:10,481 --> 02:36:20,987
[SPEAKER_01]: So, as you so wonderfully alluded to earlier in the show, I was at the Wii U Consumer Experience here in Denver just yesterday.

2097
02:36:21,927 --> 02:36:35,895
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, I think my friend told me they've been in since Thursday, and since he went to E3, he had codes assigned to me and a friend up, and we all got to go out there and see the... I'm assuming they're all going to be launch titles or something that's going to happen within the first couple of months.

2098
02:36:37,695 --> 02:37:02,264
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's just really interesting because I was hearing obviously your cross with Bobby and you guys were really putting the Wii U down it's kind of astounding to me I understand in the fact that it's going to be a lot of the same thing and you have to get a whole new console just to be able to use the tablet even though everything else is going to be the same the controllers, the Wii Fit balance board and all that kind of stuff

2099
02:37:03,445 --> 02:37:04,846
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I don't know.

2100
02:37:04,886 --> 02:37:14,734
[SPEAKER_01]: That's speaking as a gamer myself, somebody who will pay the money to get something like this and not the common people that paid $200 to play Wii Sports forever.

2101
02:37:15,441 --> 02:37:17,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Jason, I'm more worried about the games.

2102
02:37:17,362 --> 02:37:23,885
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the console itself, but I see a lot of what was happening with the 3DS happening here.

2103
02:37:23,925 --> 02:37:29,168
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a lot of mediocre launch titles, and I don't think any really big standouts.

2104
02:37:30,108 --> 02:37:31,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's your chance to change my mind.

2105
02:37:31,949 --> 02:37:35,991
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you get your hands on that you are excited to drop money for a new console for?

2106
02:37:36,522 --> 02:37:38,403
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't really speak release dates.

2107
02:37:38,663 --> 02:37:43,525
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, as a matter of fact, when the event was wrapping up, they had this little quick little trivia session.

2108
02:37:43,545 --> 02:37:45,987
[SPEAKER_01]: They were giving out a bunch of silly little prizes.

2109
02:37:46,387 --> 02:37:48,228
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them was a trick question.

2110
02:37:48,328 --> 02:37:49,729
[SPEAKER_01]: When is the Wii U coming out?

2111
02:37:49,769 --> 02:37:55,932
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer was holidays, but there's otherwise no specific date, barring what Loki said earlier about the 13th.

2112
02:37:55,972 --> 02:37:57,893
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that the correct answer is November 18th.

2113
02:37:57,933 --> 02:37:58,553
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have got him.

2114
02:37:59,633 --> 02:38:01,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the people putting on this event wouldn't know that, though.

2115
02:38:02,015 --> 02:38:02,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2116
02:38:03,115 --> 02:38:06,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it wasn't NDA, it wasn't sales, it wasn't media.

2117
02:38:06,596 --> 02:38:10,638
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just, you know, bring your friends and let's play some really cool games.

2118
02:38:10,658 --> 02:38:11,478
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll show you some stuff.

2119
02:38:11,778 --> 02:38:12,599
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really fun.

2120
02:38:13,059 --> 02:38:23,303
[SPEAKER_01]: The boost that they set up, the things that I actually had, I didn't get my hands on everything, but they had setups for Nintendo Land, cycling through some of the mini arcade games.

2121
02:38:24,243 --> 02:38:26,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Game & Wario, Super Mario Bros.

2122
02:38:26,044 --> 02:38:36,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Wii U, Zombie U, Batman Arkham City, Pikmin 3, Just Dance 4, Wii Fit U, Rayman Legends, and then two non-finally named Project P100 and Sing.

2123
02:38:39,632 --> 02:38:41,794
[SPEAKER_01]: and they looked good.

2124
02:38:42,094 --> 02:38:49,039
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I really have to say about it on the surface is that these games looked spectacular.

2125
02:38:49,520 --> 02:38:52,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Super Mario Brothers exactly as it was on the Wii.

2126
02:38:52,682 --> 02:38:53,843
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that art style.

2127
02:38:53,943 --> 02:38:55,044
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the way it played.

2128
02:38:55,104 --> 02:38:58,826
[SPEAKER_01]: The tablet integration looks fun if you happen to have a second person to play with.

2129
02:38:59,907 --> 02:39:23,148
[SPEAKER_01]: but then Pikmin looked gorgeous and the new effects that they're they're not if they support 3D TV that's news to me but the fact that they were actually throwing things at the camera and what not and actually giving this serious spatial angle to it and not just a bird's eye corner view of it it just looked like it played marvelously well

2130
02:39:23,348 --> 02:39:26,890
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so it's the Nintendo stuff you love in HD.

2131
02:39:27,410 --> 02:39:30,111
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, did you get your hands on the games?

2132
02:39:30,151 --> 02:39:31,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you play any games?

2133
02:39:31,332 --> 02:39:32,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Which ones stood out for you?

2134
02:39:33,253 --> 02:39:35,074
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Super Mario Bros.

2135
02:39:35,114 --> 02:39:40,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Wii U. Super Mario Bros.

2136
02:39:40,637 --> 02:39:47,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Wii U, I played a couple of the games from Nintendo Land, and then I played, as far as I understand, pretty much a whole level of Rayman Legends.

2137
02:39:47,640 --> 02:39:48,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

2138
02:39:49,361 --> 02:39:59,244
[SPEAKER_01]: As I'm sure a lot of people know, Nintendo Land is mostly a series of minigames that are developed to really take advantage notably of the tablet but also give you a really good multiplayer experience.

2139
02:40:00,344 --> 02:40:11,947
[SPEAKER_01]: The very first thing I did was play Luigi's Ghost Mansion playing the flashlight tag where the ghost is playing on the tablet and is invisible for the large part and then the four players with Wiimotes

2140
02:40:12,347 --> 02:40:13,468
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

2141
02:40:38,485 --> 02:41:06,947
[SPEAKER_01]: but I just I can't really find the words for it other than the fact that it feels like it will be a more complete library than any other system launch that I've actually jumped into at the very start of it and then especially things like Zombie U and Batman Arkham City look absolutely stunning like I've played Mad World and yeah that's not supposed to be like the realistic graphics or anything but Arkham City and Zombie U looked absolutely fantastic this wasn't the...

2142
02:41:08,208 --> 02:41:10,553
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of curiosity, have you played Arkham City on 360 or PlayStation 3?

2143
02:41:10,594 --> 02:41:11,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, no.

2144
02:41:18,021 --> 02:41:25,783
[SPEAKER_02]: See, and that's where I have to admit, not that I question your opinion, but I go, well, it looks beautiful on the other systems too, and it's been out for a year.

2145
02:41:26,583 --> 02:41:41,447
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just about the graphics, but the fact that this is something that's going to be available at some point within the general launch window means that this is a big tier title that's going to be on Nintendo's system.

2146
02:41:41,467 --> 02:41:43,068
[SPEAKER_08]: That a lot of people already own.

2147
02:41:43,148 --> 02:41:44,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it came out last year.

2148
02:41:45,020 --> 02:41:45,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Also true.

2149
02:41:46,982 --> 02:41:48,123
[SPEAKER_01]: I absolutely will not deny that.

2150
02:41:48,163 --> 02:42:09,561
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I was saying at the start of the call, I think a lot of people are going to paint a very negative picture of the Wii U after it comes out because it's not going to have the runaway success that the first Wii did because all of the casuals, all of the people that otherwise have never owned a gaming system won't see the reason to buy this

2151
02:42:11,544 --> 02:42:27,202
[SPEAKER_01]: and so it won't sell it won't take off so ridiculously like the original Wii did but that's not a bad thing because this is Nintendo in my absolute opinion this is Nintendo making things better for gamers at large um

2152
02:42:27,762 --> 02:42:45,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Project P100 is a very Pikmin-esque action game, which is great because there's finally a second game with that low army control mechanism, and it's set in a much more technological scene that a lot of people would prefer, I'm sure.

2153
02:42:48,071 --> 02:42:52,574
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to admit, Jason, despite your enthusiasm, I'm not sure I'm completely sold.

2154
02:42:52,954 --> 02:43:03,559
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes down to the games issue, and it's really about what... To be fair, to Nintendo's credit, it's kind of the same mistake as the Vita, too.

2155
02:43:04,680 --> 02:43:11,103
[SPEAKER_02]: The Vita did come with a few kick-ass launch games, and there was certainly a lot to look forward to, but I don't know.

2156
02:43:11,723 --> 02:43:16,526
[SPEAKER_02]: What's been delivered on hasn't exactly matched the hype, and this is all about the games department.

2157
02:43:17,106 --> 02:43:46,606
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's kind of what I worry about with the Wii U as well because we haven't seen a lot past the launch window and you know there's not a lot to just really really get excited about because I played a lot of these Mass Effect 3 Arkham City on 360 and I'm not really interested in playing them again with tablet controls because it doesn't sound like it's going to change that much so I have to look to things like Nintendo Land and Pikmin 3 and New Super Mario Brothers Wii U and all this to pique my interest and it's just I'm not

2158
02:43:47,186 --> 02:43:56,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not as excited as, say, the hype behind the original Wii and how we felt about that Zelda game was a phenomenal launch.

2159
02:43:56,690 --> 02:44:01,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, has there ever been a better launch game for a console since the original Super Mario Bros.?

2160
02:44:02,752 --> 02:44:05,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly not one I've actually been there for.

2161
02:44:05,293 --> 02:44:06,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Than Zelda for the Wii?

2162
02:44:06,894 --> 02:44:11,376
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess I was just hoping for something of that magnitude and Nintendo Land ain't it.

2163
02:44:12,791 --> 02:44:21,279
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing that really sets this apart, one of the feelings that I did come away with is that true to Nintendo's spirit, this stuff works.

2164
02:44:21,739 --> 02:44:26,483
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the things that they were showcasing make it really compelling for local multiplayer.

2165
02:44:26,623 --> 02:44:38,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Knock Nintendo's online services all you want, I'd completely agree with it, but having that second player, or in some cases that fifth player, to be able to take over controls with the tablet

2166
02:44:38,994 --> 02:44:39,375
[SPEAKER_01]: and DarkSakura.

2167
02:44:54,572 --> 02:45:07,908
[SPEAKER_01]: The Wiimote, or actually in this case it was the Pro Controller, whatever they're going to call it for the Wii U. The standard controller user is controlling Rayman, throwing shots, jumping, all that kind of thing, jumping on obstacles, attacking.

2168
02:45:08,409 --> 02:45:09,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the tablet...

2169
02:45:09,870 --> 02:45:11,591
[SPEAKER_01]: is manipulating the environment.

2170
02:45:11,691 --> 02:45:13,693
[SPEAKER_01]: It's moving platforms around.

2171
02:45:13,733 --> 02:45:30,564
[SPEAKER_01]: They had the whole rotation demonstration where you're walking, your Rayman's running through a maze and the person holding the tablet has to orient the level by turning the entire device in order to allow them to jump to the next ring, land on solid grounds, land not on spikes.

2172
02:45:31,244 --> 02:45:40,192
[SPEAKER_01]: and the biggest thing that they showed off, as I said, was that with a second person, these games just got ridiculously more interesting.

2173
02:45:41,192 --> 02:45:45,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Zombie U had this Capture the Flag... Not Capture the Flag.

2174
02:45:47,557 --> 02:46:14,713
[SPEAKER_01]: the game mode where you have like three or five waypoints that you have to capture and defend and that kind of stuff and the player with the standard controller owned the TV and would attack zombies and was pretty much the one man army and then the person holding the tablet had like a real time strategy kind of interface where he could take hordes of zombies and send them to the particular waypoints and actually drill into this real time strategy that's

2175
02:46:15,493 --> 02:46:15,934
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura,

2176
02:46:31,693 --> 02:46:35,575
[SPEAKER_02]: To Nintendo's credit, that could be an ace in the hole on September 13th.

2177
02:46:35,956 --> 02:46:41,479
[SPEAKER_02]: We still don't know what Nintendo Network really is, despite the fact it's being branded on Nintendo cartridges.

2178
02:46:41,959 --> 02:46:46,882
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be coming, and I'd be okay with that if there's a huge unveil on September 13th.

2179
02:46:47,323 --> 02:46:51,986
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would wait on the online piece to be too critical about that until we have that event.

2180
02:46:52,246 --> 02:46:57,109
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we still don't hear about it at that event, then it ain't coming with the release of the Wii U, and now we should be concerned.

2181
02:46:59,210 --> 02:47:22,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Calls going a little long and that's okay Jason because we love you but I want to ask you one more question shaped off a chat comment we got here at live.vognetwork.com and ShadowNextGen in chat who's agreed with you in many ways and I saw it throughout Bobby's show tonight he kind of didn't he thought you know that what I was saying was kind of wrong and he's more supportive of the Wii U he sounds a lot like you and what you're saying

2182
02:47:22,865 --> 02:47:31,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And he says, what this says to me is more people need to get actual hands-on time with the Wii U. So let me ask you this, Jason.

2183
02:47:32,307 --> 02:47:35,288
[SPEAKER_02]: You've had hands-on time with the Wii U. I haven't.

2184
02:47:35,468 --> 02:47:36,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki hasn't.

2185
02:47:36,228 --> 02:47:37,288
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura hasn't.

2186
02:47:38,088 --> 02:47:42,730
[SPEAKER_02]: And you are clearly in love with this thing more so than us skeptics here.

2187
02:47:44,730 --> 02:47:49,051
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think you gain that we're missing having had hands-on time with the system?

2188
02:47:49,571 --> 02:48:04,080
[SPEAKER_01]: See, and that's a really funny question I'll try to summarize in the fact that me and Ryan don't play a lot of the same games, and I'm hoping she's going to be interested in the aspects that are opened up with the simultaneous multiplayer of standard controllers and the tablets.

2189
02:48:04,640 --> 02:48:05,902
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2190
02:48:22,162 --> 02:48:45,169
[SPEAKER_01]: that is killer and this is a fully fledged game that's not confined to a phone that has a limited amount of controls and you can do all sorts of media while giving the TV back to somebody else but for these Wii U optimized games where you have your hands on the tablet this is engaging somebody else at the same time usually in a completely distinct way you know what that also means?

2191
02:48:45,449 --> 02:48:51,431
[SPEAKER_01]: That means both people get to play the game in two in times completely different methods

2192
02:48:52,291 --> 02:48:59,674
[SPEAKER_01]: For all the replayability complaints that we complain about in modern gaming, this is two different ways to play the same game.

2193
02:49:00,834 --> 02:49:03,395
[SPEAKER_01]: That's ridiculously cool to me.

2194
02:49:03,975 --> 02:49:05,876
[SPEAKER_01]: I was sold on this system before I went to this event.

2195
02:49:05,956 --> 02:49:07,897
[SPEAKER_01]: I had my hands on it.

2196
02:49:09,337 --> 02:49:11,418
[SPEAKER_01]: I am 100% sold on this system now.

2197
02:49:12,179 --> 02:49:13,219
[SPEAKER_01]: I will absolutely say that.

2198
02:49:13,279 --> 02:49:15,380
[SPEAKER_02]: I am so with you up to a point, Jason.

2199
02:49:15,600 --> 02:49:18,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do want to love this system.

2200
02:49:19,081 --> 02:49:20,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll probably get one anyway.

2201
02:49:20,282 --> 02:49:20,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Who are we kidding?

2202
02:49:21,602 --> 02:49:22,842
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've said that since day one.

2203
02:49:22,922 --> 02:49:23,783
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your obligation for the show, right?

2204
02:49:23,803 --> 02:49:27,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm skeptical as all hell, but I'll still fucking buy one because I'm a consumer whore.

2205
02:49:30,545 --> 02:49:31,845
[SPEAKER_02]: God damn it, I lost my train of thought.

2206
02:49:31,865 --> 02:49:34,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you don't is where you don't agree.

2207
02:49:34,766 --> 02:49:35,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I found it.

2208
02:49:35,186 --> 02:49:35,646
[SPEAKER_02]: No, here it is.

2209
02:49:35,806 --> 02:49:36,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is.

2210
02:49:37,847 --> 02:49:40,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are the games that substantiate what you're saying?

2211
02:49:42,628 --> 02:49:44,289
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you brought this up before.

2212
02:49:44,789 --> 02:49:46,710
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember my list of games at the very start of the call?

2213
02:49:47,390 --> 02:49:47,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

2214
02:49:48,393 --> 02:49:53,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what the launch dates?

2215
02:49:53,539 --> 02:49:57,023
[SPEAKER_01]: What games will be launched in the holiday window?

2216
02:49:57,304 --> 02:49:59,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much everything that you named is in the holiday window.

2217
02:49:59,686 --> 02:50:01,709
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not enough to start a system?

2218
02:50:02,735 --> 02:50:31,596
[SPEAKER_02]: um yes I when you when half your list is stuff that's already been out with a new method that again now we go back to the phone the iOS conversation about games that weren't developed for that system don't know I mean yeah okay so I'll have this tablet interaction but these games weren't designed with the tablet thing in mind they're kind of trying to shoehorn that stuff in there which is fine whatever show off the system but I'm not that I am not excited about Arkham City with the pad I'm not a

2219
02:50:32,276 --> 02:50:35,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not excited about Mass Effect 3 with the touchpad.

2220
02:50:35,477 --> 02:50:36,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm not.

2221
02:50:36,978 --> 02:50:39,739
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's half the games right off the table.

2222
02:50:40,059 --> 02:50:41,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, my interest is piqued.

2223
02:50:41,280 --> 02:50:44,981
[SPEAKER_02]: My eyebrow is raised a little bit at things like Zombie U, Pikmin 3.

2224
02:50:46,342 --> 02:50:48,103
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of consider New Super Mario Bros.

2225
02:50:48,143 --> 02:50:48,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Wii at this point.

2226
02:50:49,263 --> 02:50:53,645
[SPEAKER_02]: It's half rehash, half a successful formula just being done again.

2227
02:50:54,225 --> 02:50:57,326
[SPEAKER_02]: But a couple games, no, it's really not enough.

2228
02:50:57,446 --> 02:50:57,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the 3DS.

2229
02:50:59,491 --> 02:51:00,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the 3DS.

2230
02:51:00,772 --> 02:51:02,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're making the exact same mistake.

2231
02:51:02,312 --> 02:51:02,752
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do.

2232
02:51:02,792 --> 02:51:03,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at the Vita launch.

2233
02:51:03,713 --> 02:51:08,675
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they had a ton of games that a lot of them were original, and that still didn't help the system.

2234
02:51:08,935 --> 02:51:10,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and SSJ100Matt, thank you.

2235
02:51:10,595 --> 02:51:11,836
[SPEAKER_02]: You fill in the gap here really well.

2236
02:51:12,216 --> 02:51:14,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know what's coming out after these launch window games.

2237
02:51:14,897 --> 02:51:16,958
[SPEAKER_02]: What is Nintendo going to do to warrant this investment?

2238
02:51:17,218 --> 02:51:19,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's what console games are, investments.

2239
02:51:19,739 --> 02:51:20,940
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

2240
02:51:36,932 --> 02:51:37,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Final thought?

2241
02:51:37,873 --> 02:51:38,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2242
02:51:38,553 --> 02:51:40,674
[SPEAKER_01]: You are going to love Sing.

2243
02:51:41,775 --> 02:51:46,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Provided the song list pans out and it's not more frickin' LMFAO.

2244
02:51:48,639 --> 02:51:53,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Provided the song list comes up with some really good gems, you are going to adore Sing.

2245
02:51:53,542 --> 02:51:55,063
[SPEAKER_01]: I can pretty much promise you that.

2246
02:51:56,044 --> 02:51:57,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Will it be all ABBA songs?

2247
02:51:57,505 --> 02:51:59,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Because otherwise Sing Star ABBA still has my heart.

2248
02:52:02,267 --> 02:52:07,448
[SPEAKER_01]: The only songs they had were Shoop Shoop, Party Rock Anthem, and Call Me Maybe.

2249
02:52:07,728 --> 02:52:09,849
[SPEAKER_01]: And they haven't really let on what else is going to be there.

2250
02:52:09,929 --> 02:52:10,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God.

2251
02:52:10,469 --> 02:52:11,989
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like my personal hell.

2252
02:52:12,389 --> 02:52:12,649
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

2253
02:52:13,249 --> 02:52:14,149
[SPEAKER_01]: Those, sure.

2254
02:52:14,189 --> 02:52:16,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, provided the song list is actually worth it.

2255
02:52:16,830 --> 02:52:18,130
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to hope it will.

2256
02:52:18,170 --> 02:52:20,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Sing is going to be spectacular for parties.

2257
02:52:20,711 --> 02:52:21,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Jason, I got to let you go.

2258
02:52:21,831 --> 02:52:24,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the chatters think you're a Nintendo salesperson in disguise.

2259
02:52:24,311 --> 02:52:25,551
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to let you go.

2260
02:52:25,972 --> 02:52:26,232
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2261
02:52:26,252 --> 02:52:26,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, guys.

2262
02:52:26,752 --> 02:52:27,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good week.

2263
02:52:27,372 --> 02:52:27,932
[SPEAKER_02]: You too, buddy.

2264
02:52:28,032 --> 02:52:28,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.

2265
02:52:29,732 --> 02:52:30,072
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2266
02:52:30,352 --> 02:52:31,373
[SPEAKER_02]: VXJ's next video.

2267
02:52:31,413 --> 02:52:33,353
[SPEAKER_02]: We let his call go on a little long, but that's all right.

2268
02:52:33,413 --> 02:52:34,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he was there.

2269
02:52:34,714 --> 02:52:35,534
[SPEAKER_02]: He got hands on.

2270
02:52:35,594 --> 02:52:36,254
[SPEAKER_02]: We're skeptics.

2271
02:52:36,414 --> 02:52:36,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatevs.

2272
02:52:37,774 --> 02:52:39,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do like one more call.

2273
02:52:39,375 --> 02:52:42,776
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2274
02:52:43,176 --> 02:52:46,777
[SPEAKER_02]: While we wait for those calls to come in, let me quickly see if I can do a Twitter topic here.

2275
02:52:48,598 --> 02:52:51,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiger Claw, oh, links us on Twitter.

2276
02:52:52,683 --> 02:52:57,710
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one that I read in the news that I forgot to mention on the show tonight, but it's important.

2277
02:52:58,271 --> 02:53:01,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Uncharted film has burned through yet another director.

2278
02:53:03,656 --> 02:53:04,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Epic Beatdown Otaku Style What?

2279
02:53:04,417 --> 02:53:04,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2280
02:53:34,224 --> 02:53:37,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, is it something you actually braved to try, or...?

2281
02:53:37,907 --> 02:53:44,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it's an anime equivalent of Double Dragon meets Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, the game.

2282
02:53:44,931 --> 02:53:45,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

2283
02:53:46,633 --> 02:53:52,156
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can check out their plans on studionasu.com, which I am posting in the chatroom right now.

2284
02:53:54,378 --> 02:54:01,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty much, from what I understand, you're at Otakon, and you're just pretty much beating up on the fanboys, more or less.

2285
02:54:04,361 --> 02:54:09,223
[SPEAKER_02]: And as somebody who goes to anime conventions quite frequently and all this stuff, how do you feel?

2286
02:54:10,304 --> 02:54:12,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I'm all for it.

2287
02:54:12,164 --> 02:54:15,746
[SPEAKER_07]: You talk to somebody at any given time who has a weapon on them trying to help somebody.

2288
02:54:16,066 --> 02:54:17,767
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta be able to laugh at yourself first.

2289
02:54:18,367 --> 02:54:20,068
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll put in the weapons as a can of deodorant.

2290
02:54:21,588 --> 02:54:30,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, one con actually put soap in their bags and people got pissed at that so they decided not to do it again, but that's besides the point.

2291
02:54:32,384 --> 02:54:37,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, did you just call to whore this con-going game, or what else is going on in your life, Ranma?

2292
02:54:37,708 --> 02:54:39,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's more or less it.

2293
02:54:39,289 --> 02:54:42,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, we've already discussed New Super Mario Bros.

2294
02:54:42,332 --> 02:54:44,133
[SPEAKER_07]: 2, so my two cents on that doesn't really count.

2295
02:54:44,774 --> 02:54:48,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what is your... No, of course, every gamer has a voice.

2296
02:54:48,637 --> 02:54:49,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Every gamer has a voice.

2297
02:54:49,818 --> 02:54:50,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Use that voice.

2298
02:54:50,518 --> 02:54:52,240
[SPEAKER_02]: You are Black Luigi, after all.

2299
02:54:52,340 --> 02:54:55,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know what Black Luigi thinks about Mario 2.

2300
02:54:56,023 --> 02:54:57,063
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important, dammit.

2301
02:54:58,124 --> 02:55:00,266
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a Luigi, number one gaming star.

2302
02:55:02,150 --> 02:55:06,732
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you think about New Super Mario Bros.

2303
02:55:07,032 --> 02:55:08,053
[SPEAKER_02]: 2 on the 3DS?

2304
02:55:08,793 --> 02:55:09,294
[SPEAKER_07]: It lacks.

2305
02:55:10,534 --> 02:55:11,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, sick burn.

2306
02:55:11,995 --> 02:55:12,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is that?

2307
02:55:13,096 --> 02:55:13,476
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

2308
02:55:14,136 --> 02:55:21,500
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how you play a game and you just look at it like it's just lacking, and you can't put your finger on what it is, but it's just lacking something?

2309
02:55:22,060 --> 02:55:27,523
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I like the fact they brought back the raccoon tail, so I'm thinking, oh yeah, Super Mario Bros.

2310
02:55:27,843 --> 02:55:27,523
3.

2311
02:55:28,123 --> 02:55:29,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma, is it originality?

2312
02:55:33,568 --> 02:55:34,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2313
02:55:35,950 --> 02:55:40,493
[SPEAKER_05]: It only has 85% of the feels.

2314
02:55:40,733 --> 02:55:44,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you listened to last week's show, Ranma, early on or whatever when I was talking about the game.

2315
02:55:44,176 --> 02:55:46,598
[SPEAKER_02]: I caught the podcast because I was out last week.

2316
02:55:47,578 --> 02:55:49,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Here was my whole thoughts on the game.

2317
02:55:49,860 --> 02:55:52,162
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty much a formulaic Mario game.

2318
02:55:52,662 --> 02:55:54,203
[SPEAKER_02]: But is that really such a bad thing?

2319
02:55:54,844 --> 02:55:55,765
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not at all.

2320
02:55:56,225 --> 02:55:59,168
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is what I think would have made the game better.

2321
02:55:59,709 --> 02:56:06,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, you remember in Super Mario 3, you could travel all over the map area to go to different levels.

2322
02:56:06,395 --> 02:56:11,980
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand you could do that in the new SMB2, but it's only part of the screen that it takes up.

2323
02:56:12,220 --> 02:56:15,883
[SPEAKER_07]: It would have been nicer if it was the full screen that allows you to travel from the different levels.

2324
02:56:17,074 --> 02:56:19,797
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand they brought back some of the music from SMB3.

2325
02:56:19,857 --> 02:56:27,944
[SPEAKER_07]: They could have brought back something like the classic matching card games or matching up the Mushroom and the Fireflower for one-ups and stuff like that.

2326
02:56:28,065 --> 02:56:31,208
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked the little giant glove that punched the one-ups.

2327
02:56:31,428 --> 02:56:32,909
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of cute, actually.

2328
02:56:33,209 --> 02:56:35,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, bring back Karibo's shoe.

2329
02:56:35,311 --> 02:56:37,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it was me.

2330
02:56:37,533 --> 02:56:40,456
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking it would be more like Super Mario Bros.

2331
02:56:40,476 --> 02:56:41,017
[SPEAKER_07]: 3, but better.

2332
02:56:43,920 --> 02:56:44,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know.

2333
02:56:44,600 --> 02:56:47,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I didn't dislike it by any means.

2334
02:56:47,503 --> 02:56:50,745
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I write my VOG review, it'll probably be on the positive end of things.

2335
02:56:50,845 --> 02:56:52,507
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just, you know, I don't know.

2336
02:56:52,547 --> 02:56:58,232
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just something I'm not as like, oh, my God, Irma Gerd about it as like previous Mario games.

2337
02:56:58,292 --> 02:57:04,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Ranma, do you have a like a was an R4 or anything like that for your DS?

2338
02:57:04,057 --> 02:57:04,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2339
02:57:04,795 --> 02:57:09,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and when you first mentioned a long time ago the new Super Mario Bros.

2340
02:57:09,358 --> 02:57:13,661
[SPEAKER_07]: 3 ROM hack, I went and downloaded it like 10 minutes after the podcast.

2341
02:57:14,061 --> 02:57:15,282
[SPEAKER_07]: That game is hard as fuck.

2342
02:57:15,502 --> 02:57:22,146
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm saying though, but I mean, it's pretty awesome that they did all these original levels plus the levels from Super Mario Bros.

2343
02:57:22,166 --> 02:57:27,750
[SPEAKER_08]: 3 and that took some effort versus rehashing the same old shit again.

2344
02:57:28,570 --> 02:57:29,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean...

2345
02:57:30,977 --> 02:57:35,360
[SPEAKER_07]: As I'm controlling the game, I'm not too fond of how they changed how you control Mario, but eh.

2346
02:57:37,021 --> 02:57:37,341
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2347
02:57:37,661 --> 02:57:39,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma, I've got to wrap up and let you go.

2348
02:57:39,022 --> 02:57:39,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Any final thoughts?

2349
02:57:43,164 --> 02:57:43,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no.

2350
02:57:44,565 --> 02:57:44,845
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2351
02:57:44,885 --> 02:57:45,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care, buddy.

2352
02:57:46,146 --> 02:57:46,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

2353
02:57:46,566 --> 02:57:46,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

2354
02:57:47,747 --> 02:57:48,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we can do one more call.

2355
02:57:48,768 --> 02:57:49,928
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen this one calling in.

2356
02:57:50,569 --> 02:57:51,489
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do one more call.

2357
02:57:51,809 --> 02:57:52,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

2358
02:57:52,650 --> 02:57:53,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2359
02:57:53,591 --> 02:57:53,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2360
02:57:54,557 --> 02:57:55,837
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Cody.

2361
02:57:56,298 --> 02:57:56,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Cody!

2362
02:57:56,998 --> 02:57:57,718
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, Cody?

2363
02:57:58,258 --> 02:57:58,799
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?

2364
02:57:59,439 --> 02:58:02,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually a first-time caller, long-time listener.

2365
02:58:02,620 --> 02:58:04,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, long-time listener, first-time caller.

2366
02:58:05,061 --> 02:58:07,482
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, I don't recognize this Skype picture.

2367
02:58:07,542 --> 02:58:08,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a very visual person.

2368
02:58:08,222 --> 02:58:09,082
[SPEAKER_05]: But I like bow ties.

2369
02:58:09,202 --> 02:58:10,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Bow ties are cool.

2370
02:58:10,043 --> 02:58:11,323
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very, very nice bow tie.

2371
02:58:11,343 --> 02:58:13,944
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks like, did you tie that bow tie yourself on your picture?

2372
02:58:14,364 --> 02:58:17,546
[SPEAKER_03]: That is actually, that is a Doctor Who brand bow tie.

2373
02:58:18,387 --> 02:58:19,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, see?

2374
02:58:19,288 --> 02:58:19,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.

2375
02:58:20,208 --> 02:58:21,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you also wear a fez?

2376
02:58:21,369 --> 02:58:24,431
[SPEAKER_02]: You will fit in well here at the Voice of Geeks Network.

2377
02:58:24,511 --> 02:58:25,172
[SPEAKER_02]: I do own one.

2378
02:58:25,472 --> 02:58:25,732
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2379
02:58:26,272 --> 02:58:27,153
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, Cody?

2380
02:58:28,014 --> 02:58:31,896
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to call, actually, first off, the whole Wii U thing, I'm kind of the same.

2381
02:58:33,257 --> 02:58:34,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on the fence about it as well.

2382
02:58:35,299 --> 02:58:40,823
[SPEAKER_03]: About the only thing I use my Wii for right now is Netflix and Skyward Sword.

2383
02:58:40,883 --> 02:58:42,103
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean...

2384
02:58:43,888 --> 02:59:02,502
[SPEAKER_03]: and I really I've seen a lot of stuff going on with it different networks talking about it and you know everybody's just has kind of the same same take on it you know they just they need to play it they need to play it and not a lot of people get to play it and I think that's what somebody said in the chat is that not a lot of people

2385
02:59:02,967 --> 02:59:06,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Get to play it, and they haven't had hands-on, so they don't know how it's going to work.

2386
02:59:06,308 --> 02:59:12,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, Shadow Next Gen and VXChaseXV both are in chat now kind of talking it up because they both are like, you guys need to play it.

2387
02:59:12,950 --> 02:59:14,791
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys need to do the hands-on experience.

2388
02:59:15,711 --> 02:59:26,275
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure as the announcements are made, as we get closer to launch day, we're going to start seeing those displays at Best Buys, Game Stops, yada, yada, so everybody can get their hands-on time.

2389
02:59:26,375 --> 02:59:28,736
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

2390
02:59:28,816 --> 02:59:29,256
[SPEAKER_02]: I still...

2391
02:59:30,216 --> 02:59:31,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm highly skeptical.

2392
02:59:31,778 --> 02:59:33,199
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a bad thing.

2393
02:59:33,219 --> 02:59:34,259
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a bad thing.

2394
02:59:34,880 --> 02:59:39,883
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't hate the Wii U. It's not a bad thing to question, especially after the 3DS launch.

2395
02:59:39,963 --> 02:59:41,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's a bad thing to be concerned.

2396
02:59:42,165 --> 02:59:43,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want the Wii U. Not at all.

2397
02:59:43,846 --> 02:59:44,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Not at all.

2398
02:59:46,188 --> 02:59:52,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I was excited about it, especially like you said, Zombie U. When I saw that, I was like, whoa, man, that looks like an amazing game.

2399
02:59:53,813 --> 02:59:56,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm scared that it's going to be kind of like the Vita.

2400
02:59:56,735 --> 02:59:58,817
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe Loki said something about...

2401
03:00:01,058 --> 03:00:06,740
[SPEAKER_03]: The Vita had this huge launch of original games and everything, and it still didn't help it.

2402
03:00:07,200 --> 03:00:11,442
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kind of think that that's the way that the Wii U is going to turn out.

2403
03:00:11,502 --> 03:00:12,042
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

2404
03:00:12,082 --> 03:00:14,363
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't seen it yet, and that's the thing.

2405
03:00:14,403 --> 03:00:15,224
[SPEAKER_03]: We just have to wait.

2406
03:00:15,884 --> 03:00:17,465
[SPEAKER_03]: And once we see it...

2407
03:00:18,445 --> 03:00:19,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we'll know.

2408
03:00:19,285 --> 03:00:21,426
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I'm just waiting.

2409
03:00:22,347 --> 03:00:22,587
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2410
03:00:22,607 --> 03:00:24,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you say you have something else you want to talk about tonight?

2411
03:00:24,287 --> 03:00:28,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you said that you got derailed by the way you talk, but was there something else on your mind?

2412
03:00:28,869 --> 03:00:30,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to throw that in there.

2413
03:00:30,550 --> 03:00:33,511
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I wanted to say, I actually, I'm an Oklahoman.

2414
03:00:33,531 --> 03:00:37,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you have a couple of Oklahoman callers, or listeners, actually.

2415
03:00:38,253 --> 03:00:43,695
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was going to say that, I don't know if you guys heard about the Gearbox Community Day.

2416
03:00:43,715 --> 03:00:45,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I have heard about that.

2417
03:00:45,936 --> 03:00:46,976
[SPEAKER_02]: I did hear about that, yeah.

2418
03:00:47,734 --> 03:00:49,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to go.

2419
03:00:49,595 --> 03:00:55,458
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to go, and I actually want to videotape as much as I can, if they'll allow it.

2420
03:00:56,379 --> 03:00:59,341
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm a big Borderlands whore.

2421
03:00:59,921 --> 03:01:08,126
[SPEAKER_03]: I play that game constantly, and I think it's because I love RPGs, and I love FPSs, but I suck at FPSs, and I'm good at RPGs.

2422
03:01:08,506 --> 03:01:12,008
[SPEAKER_03]: So it kind of mixes the two together, and I think that's why I like it so much.

2423
03:01:12,088 --> 03:01:12,448
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.

2424
03:01:12,881 --> 03:01:14,082
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you guys heard about that.

2425
03:01:15,243 --> 03:01:18,105
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like a really fun thing to go to.

2426
03:01:18,125 --> 03:01:20,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been to any kind of conventions or anything like that.

2427
03:01:22,087 --> 03:01:23,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty excited about that.

2428
03:01:23,368 --> 03:01:24,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are they having this?

2429
03:01:24,409 --> 03:01:25,449
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in Texas.

2430
03:01:26,490 --> 03:01:30,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Texas, Dallas.

2431
03:01:31,173 --> 03:01:32,594
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just Borderlands 2.

2432
03:01:32,994 --> 03:01:35,756
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also Aliens vs. Predators.

2433
03:01:35,936 --> 03:01:37,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it Aliens vs. Predators?

2434
03:01:37,377 --> 03:01:39,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, Aliens Colonial Marines.

2435
03:01:39,839 --> 03:01:40,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Colonial Marines.

2436
03:01:40,920 --> 03:01:41,220
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

2437
03:01:42,357 --> 03:02:00,588
[SPEAKER_03]: and then one more thing, I do know that Alan plays a lot, he's a big fan of Half-Life and I don't know if he's played this mod before and I really don't know how long this mod's been out but it's a Gary's mod and it's called Trouble in Terrorist Town

2438
03:02:02,335 --> 03:02:05,017
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't sound familiar to me, but he's listening.

2439
03:02:05,037 --> 03:02:06,438
[SPEAKER_02]: He's unfortunately not here in the house.

2440
03:02:06,618 --> 03:02:13,903
[SPEAKER_02]: He's at work tonight, so I can't ask him in person, but he's listening, so he might pop up and chat or whatever, but it doesn't sound familiar to me.

2441
03:02:14,583 --> 03:02:19,746
[SPEAKER_03]: If he hasn't played it, he needs to, because it is the... Oh my gosh, it's so fun.

2442
03:02:20,187 --> 03:02:28,792
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the most fun of Gary's mod that I've ever had, just with the funny things that happen in the mod, with all the randoms that get thrown in.

2443
03:02:29,133 --> 03:02:29,613
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have a

2444
03:02:30,542 --> 03:02:36,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to grill you like I did the Wii U lovers.

2445
03:02:36,664 --> 03:02:37,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

2446
03:02:37,125 --> 03:02:40,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it so damn amazing?

2447
03:02:41,066 --> 03:02:45,268
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really into a whole lot of multiplayer.

2448
03:02:45,688 --> 03:02:49,129
[SPEAKER_03]: When it comes to FPSs and stuff like that, I don't really like that a lot.

2449
03:02:49,957 --> 03:02:52,179
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it might be because I'm really bad at them.

2450
03:02:52,639 --> 03:02:55,301
[SPEAKER_03]: But this game, I don't know, it's really fun.

2451
03:02:55,321 --> 03:03:00,005
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has a lot to do with, you have to figure out who's the traitor in your group.

2452
03:03:00,325 --> 03:03:04,688
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a detective, a traitor, and then I think there's one more.

2453
03:03:04,908 --> 03:03:05,969
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even think of...

2454
03:03:06,369 --> 03:03:27,715
[SPEAKER_03]: is that like the wolf game or the mafia game you know those those games that are popular on web forums and conventions and all that that's what kind of what it sounds like to me yeah i mean it's sort of like that sort of yeah but um but i mean it's really fun see if he wants to check it out i mean it's it's i think it's a i'm pretty sure it's a free mod obviously uh but uh uh but uh yeah check it out i mean i i've

2455
03:03:28,553 --> 03:03:32,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Go on YouTube, look up all these different gameplays of it.

2456
03:03:32,115 --> 03:03:33,676
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just so hilarious.

2457
03:03:34,377 --> 03:03:35,697
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'll make them check it out.

2458
03:03:35,917 --> 03:03:36,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds great.

2459
03:03:37,078 --> 03:03:41,581
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, Cody, thanks so much for calling in to the show tonight.

2460
03:03:41,601 --> 03:03:42,261
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.

2461
03:03:42,441 --> 03:03:44,623
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, call in anytime.

2462
03:03:45,283 --> 03:03:54,808
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem, and you know, I was actually, I had a tweet last week telling you guys about a Borderlands 2 giveaway, and I don't know if I remember.

2463
03:03:54,968 --> 03:03:56,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that was you!

2464
03:03:56,089 --> 03:03:56,429
[SPEAKER_03]: It is me!

2465
03:03:56,469 --> 03:03:57,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was you!

2466
03:03:57,730 --> 03:03:58,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2467
03:03:58,810 --> 03:04:02,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I was an idiot and didn't link the freaking YouTube video.

2468
03:04:02,392 --> 03:04:03,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, plug away.

2469
03:04:05,775 --> 03:04:07,796
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have a small gaming channel on YouTube.

2470
03:04:07,836 --> 03:04:08,577
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not huge.

2471
03:04:09,098 --> 03:04:10,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get paid for it or anything like that.

2472
03:04:10,499 --> 03:04:12,561
[SPEAKER_03]: I just enjoy gaming and showing people my games.

2473
03:04:13,041 --> 03:04:14,002
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what we're doing here.

2474
03:04:14,182 --> 03:04:16,484
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the exact same thing we do here, except we're audio.

2475
03:04:18,932 --> 03:04:20,874
[SPEAKER_03]: And my channel is just funny commentary.

2476
03:04:21,654 --> 03:04:24,736
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I'm giving away a copy of Borderlands 2.

2477
03:04:24,957 --> 03:04:29,920
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's any platform out there that's going to be out.

2478
03:04:29,960 --> 03:04:33,943
[SPEAKER_03]: PC, PS3, 360, Steam, any of that.

2479
03:04:35,004 --> 03:04:35,825
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's...

2480
03:04:37,046 --> 03:04:40,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, my YouTube channel is linked in my Skype.

2481
03:04:41,592 --> 03:04:42,633
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can say it on here.

2482
03:04:42,693 --> 03:04:45,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you better say it because it'll take me too long to bring it up.

2483
03:04:45,397 --> 03:04:45,797
[SPEAKER_02]: So go ahead.

2484
03:04:46,318 --> 03:04:47,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Spell it or whatever.

2485
03:04:47,299 --> 03:04:53,007
[SPEAKER_03]: It's www.youtube.com backslash ctaylor1785

2486
03:04:55,740 --> 03:04:59,201
[SPEAKER_02]: SeeTaylor1785 SeeTaylor1785 You know, I gotta be honest, buddy.

2487
03:04:59,221 --> 03:05:04,302
[SPEAKER_02]: You wanna get some more hits on your YouTube channel, you're gonna have to come up with something really catchy.

2488
03:05:04,322 --> 03:05:12,045
[SPEAKER_03]: 1785's hard to remember, so... Well, it was kind of funny, because I came up with the YouTube channel a long time ago, but never did anything.

2489
03:05:12,385 --> 03:05:13,525
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now I can't change it.

2490
03:05:13,805 --> 03:05:16,026
[SPEAKER_03]: And now my channel's called Codeman Games.

2491
03:05:16,506 --> 03:05:17,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's good.

2492
03:05:17,826 --> 03:05:18,186
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.

2493
03:05:19,086 --> 03:05:22,667
[SPEAKER_02]: How about, like, Tailored Games or something silly?

2494
03:05:22,727 --> 03:05:23,108
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2495
03:05:23,468 --> 03:05:24,208
Yeah.

2496
03:05:24,928 --> 03:05:30,212
[SPEAKER_03]: But the video, if anybody's wanted, the video is called, I believe it's called That Robot Has a Temper.

2497
03:05:30,272 --> 03:05:34,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have a cell phone call with Claptrap and he's like cussing and all this different stuff.

2498
03:05:34,735 --> 03:05:35,396
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's pretty fun.

2499
03:05:35,876 --> 03:05:40,239
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, but just tell me, you know, if they want a free copy, you know, just send them on over.

2500
03:05:40,639 --> 03:05:41,080
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2501
03:05:41,440 --> 03:05:43,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Poor people who love Borderlands.

2502
03:05:44,102 --> 03:05:44,482
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm poor.

2503
03:05:46,030 --> 03:05:47,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a four month old.

2504
03:05:47,531 --> 03:05:49,852
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not that poor if you're giving away a copy of Borderlands 2.

2505
03:05:50,312 --> 03:05:51,173
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think that's great.

2506
03:05:52,213 --> 03:05:56,095
[SPEAKER_02]: I fully support the indie press in all forms, so go check that out everybody.

2507
03:05:56,575 --> 03:05:59,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, good luck with your YouTubes and we'll talk to you in a later week, okay?

2508
03:05:59,995 --> 03:06:00,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Rob.

2509
03:06:00,555 --> 03:06:01,335
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.

2510
03:06:01,395 --> 03:06:02,075
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.

2511
03:06:02,115 --> 03:06:02,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care, buddy.

2512
03:06:02,556 --> 03:06:03,396
[SPEAKER_02]: You too.

2513
03:06:03,716 --> 03:06:03,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

2514
03:06:27,270 --> 03:06:27,530
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2515
03:06:27,650 --> 03:06:28,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Platinum for me.

2516
03:06:29,811 --> 03:06:30,092
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2517
03:06:30,572 --> 03:06:31,512
[SPEAKER_05]: For the bow tie.

2518
03:06:31,532 --> 03:06:32,073
[SPEAKER_05]: For the bow tie.

2519
03:06:32,253 --> 03:06:32,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's true.

2520
03:06:32,833 --> 03:06:33,753
[SPEAKER_02]: The bow tie was pretty awesome.

2521
03:06:33,773 --> 03:06:33,974
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2522
03:06:34,254 --> 03:06:36,735
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to do it for the Skype calls tonight.

2523
03:06:36,875 --> 03:06:38,616
[SPEAKER_02]: If you didn't get through, don't be mad.

2524
03:06:39,416 --> 03:06:40,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Send tweets.

2525
03:06:40,277 --> 03:06:43,058
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Tiger Claw is like the only one that's been sending tweets this week.

2526
03:06:43,138 --> 03:06:45,600
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can either send tweets or you can send us an email.

2527
03:06:45,680 --> 03:06:47,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com.

2528
03:06:48,081 --> 03:06:50,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of Tiger Claw's tweets, I did want to get through these real quick.

2529
03:06:51,162 --> 03:06:53,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Uncharted and the director changeover.

2530
03:06:54,123 --> 03:06:56,123
[SPEAKER_02]: David O. Russell had been on there.

2531
03:06:56,183 --> 03:06:57,763
[SPEAKER_02]: He had made the movie I Heart Huckabees.

2532
03:06:58,064 --> 03:06:59,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he's not there anymore.

2533
03:06:59,304 --> 03:07:00,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Neil Berger left the project.

2534
03:07:01,284 --> 03:07:02,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is on the project now?

2535
03:07:03,785 --> 03:07:08,626
[SPEAKER_02]: The writers of National Treasure, Marianne and Cormac Wiberly.

2536
03:07:09,546 --> 03:07:10,927
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I hate Nicolas Cage.

2537
03:07:12,087 --> 03:07:15,450
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like I have no frame of reference because I refuse to see those movies.

2538
03:07:15,490 --> 03:07:15,851
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

2539
03:07:16,471 --> 03:07:18,152
[SPEAKER_05]: The only good thing he did was Raising Arizona.

2540
03:07:18,473 --> 03:07:21,095
[SPEAKER_02]: They seem topical enough.

2541
03:07:21,175 --> 03:07:21,555
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2542
03:07:22,136 --> 03:07:24,798
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I could see a movie like that leading to Uncharted.

2543
03:07:24,858 --> 03:07:25,979
[SPEAKER_02]: But all right.

2544
03:07:26,359 --> 03:07:27,200
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

2545
03:07:29,282 --> 03:07:29,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

2546
03:07:30,443 --> 03:07:36,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Neil Berger directed Limitless and he left and then he had replaced somebody else.

2547
03:07:37,188 --> 03:07:38,790
[SPEAKER_02]: So who's directing it now?

2548
03:07:40,356 --> 03:07:41,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of all the bad news we've had tonight...

2549
03:07:58,638 --> 03:08:00,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I like a little bit of good news.

2550
03:08:00,438 --> 03:08:02,059
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, Tigerclaw, for sending this.

2551
03:08:02,439 --> 03:08:05,740
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this is a good note to end on tonight, although Loki may have last-minute stories.

2552
03:08:06,080 --> 03:08:07,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, no, I want to end on this.

2553
03:08:07,260 --> 03:08:08,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, do you have any last-minute stories before I get to this?

2554
03:08:09,721 --> 03:08:12,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Eh, some MMOs stole a map from Counter-Strike.

2555
03:08:13,142 --> 03:08:14,062
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all we need to know.

2556
03:08:14,222 --> 03:08:14,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Big deal.

2557
03:08:15,442 --> 03:08:15,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2558
03:08:17,683 --> 03:08:18,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Here you go.

2559
03:08:18,304 --> 03:08:19,205
[SPEAKER_02]: A nice thing to end on.

2560
03:08:19,225 --> 03:08:19,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Tigerclaw.

2561
03:08:20,366 --> 03:08:27,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft is throwing an industry mixer for the folks from OnLive who are affected by the restructuring.

2562
03:08:28,473 --> 03:08:33,838
[SPEAKER_02]: They are scouting for Xbox-oriented positions for Mountain View, California and Redmond, Washington.

2563
03:08:34,378 --> 03:08:36,619
[SPEAKER_02]: A quote from Microsoft on the public invitation.

2564
03:08:36,959 --> 03:08:41,341
[SPEAKER_02]: We are eager to speak to individuals and teams affected by the on-live transition.

2565
03:08:41,721 --> 03:08:47,763
[SPEAKER_02]: We are looking to add key players who want to make a real impact in creating groundbreaking new products and services.

2566
03:08:48,583 --> 03:08:52,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to say, what a great way to answer Sony getting Gaikai.

2567
03:08:53,465 --> 03:08:56,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Just hire the old on-live employees for your company.

2568
03:08:56,426 --> 03:08:56,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds good.

2569
03:08:57,266 --> 03:08:58,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.

2570
03:08:58,347 --> 03:08:58,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.

2571
03:08:59,087 --> 03:09:00,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, DarkTest Studio sent in a late tweet here.

2572
03:09:01,880 --> 03:09:04,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I finished updating the wiki with recently found episodes.

2573
03:09:05,421 --> 03:09:07,702
[SPEAKER_02]: So Dark Tetsuya doing a wiki update.

2574
03:09:07,962 --> 03:09:09,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Dark Tetsuya.

2575
03:09:09,623 --> 03:09:11,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, fans, for updating that wiki.

2576
03:09:11,583 --> 03:09:12,364
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are amazing.

2577
03:09:12,444 --> 03:09:19,106
[SPEAKER_02]: OrangeLoungeRadio.wikia.com You guys make sure that I don't repeat games.

2578
03:09:20,427 --> 03:09:21,507
[SPEAKER_02]: You use it as a source.

2579
03:09:21,527 --> 03:09:22,707
[SPEAKER_02]: I use it all the time.

2580
03:09:22,767 --> 03:09:24,288
[SPEAKER_02]: It impacts what we do here on the show.

2581
03:09:24,625 --> 03:09:25,586
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, start us off tonight.

2582
03:09:25,606 --> 03:09:26,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to go to bed.

2583
03:09:26,346 --> 03:09:27,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

2584
03:09:27,146 --> 03:09:27,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2585
03:09:27,487 --> 03:09:28,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to wear this shirt to work.

2586
03:09:49,915 --> 03:09:50,416
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to.

2587
03:09:50,876 --> 03:09:51,516
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you should.

2588
03:09:52,197 --> 03:10:00,785
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is, because I neglected to say it at the start of Part B as I planned to, I do want to say rest in peace to Neil Armstrong.

2589
03:10:01,506 --> 03:10:05,609
[SPEAKER_02]: But what an amazing life to have actually gone to the moon.

2590
03:10:05,689 --> 03:10:07,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's something we all dream about as kids.

2591
03:10:07,831 --> 03:10:09,012
[SPEAKER_02]: And, like, he actually did it.

2592
03:10:09,132 --> 03:10:11,655
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yes, it's unfortunate that he passed.

2593
03:10:12,015 --> 03:10:13,697
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's not focus on the fact he died.

2594
03:10:14,017 --> 03:10:15,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's focus on the fact that, like...

2595
03:10:16,599 --> 03:10:20,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, he did something that all of us dream about, and I think that's just amazing.

2596
03:10:20,942 --> 03:10:22,783
[SPEAKER_02]: So, a tip of the hat to Neil Armstrong.

2597
03:10:23,884 --> 03:10:26,926
[SPEAKER_05]: That's gonna do it for... Well, that doesn't directly actually go with video games, too.

2598
03:10:28,367 --> 03:10:28,527
[SPEAKER_02]: How so?

2599
03:10:28,547 --> 03:10:28,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you mean that?

2600
03:10:28,948 --> 03:10:32,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Buzz Aldrin was the voice of the guy in the end of Mass Effect 3.

2601
03:10:32,230 --> 03:10:32,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, sure.

2602
03:10:33,371 --> 03:10:34,992
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they were all kind of... That's a tie.

2603
03:10:35,032 --> 03:10:36,673
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just trying to say.

2604
03:10:36,713 --> 03:10:38,334
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, that was pretty... And Phyllis Diller.

2605
03:10:39,135 --> 03:10:40,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, rest in peace, Phyllis Diller.

2606
03:10:40,716 --> 03:10:41,276
[SPEAKER_02]: She was so awesome.

2607
03:10:41,517 --> 03:10:43,758
[SPEAKER_02]: We've lost a lot of great people over the past couple weeks.

2608
03:10:43,878 --> 03:10:45,299
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy who was the Count.

2609
03:10:45,920 --> 03:10:46,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

2610
03:10:47,197 --> 03:10:48,518
[SPEAKER_05]: and Cry.

2611
03:10:48,678 --> 03:10:49,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Tragic, tragic.

2612
03:10:49,358 --> 03:10:51,059
[SPEAKER_05]: And the lady who was the astronaut.

2613
03:10:52,259 --> 03:10:53,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Sally Ride.

2614
03:10:53,200 --> 03:10:54,500
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a few weeks ago.

2615
03:10:54,540 --> 03:10:55,921
[SPEAKER_02]: We did mention that on the show.

2616
03:10:55,941 --> 03:10:57,081
[SPEAKER_02]: It may have been a week you weren't here.

2617
03:10:57,442 --> 03:10:58,482
[SPEAKER_05]: A bunch of people.

2618
03:10:58,662 --> 03:11:02,384
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very unfortunate.

2619
03:11:03,144 --> 03:11:03,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at accomplishments.

2620
03:11:04,104 --> 03:11:04,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Look ahead.

2621
03:11:05,365 --> 03:11:06,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Look ahead to two weeks.

2622
03:11:06,985 --> 03:11:09,106
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back with an all-new episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
