More unfortunate layoffs hit the industry

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
A company requests its game be pulled from store shelves

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And are 90% of PC game installs pirated copies?

For this August 26th, 2012

25

My name is Rob Roberts

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And I'll be joining you over the next few hours

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
To talk about what is going on with the game industry

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
With my friends

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Hi

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
How are you?

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I feel vaguely fit

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You feel fit?

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Vaguely

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You feel pretty and witty and...

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Hey

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Well I don't know, everyone a little gay

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That's good, it's good to feel healthy

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Cause I've had days where I feel healthy

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And I've had days where I feel fat

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You know, and sometimes a fat day is good too

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Once in a while, but healthy is a good feeling too

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Well it was just like

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
My intention is to walk a few days each week

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And I decided to go walking

46
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But I don't know if I've said it on the show before

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But I wear Vibram Five Fingers

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Which are like the toe shoes

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You wear the glove shoes

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
They're awesome

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You make your feet look like hands

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
They're creepy

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Well but it makes your feet walk how you're supposed to walk

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It makes you look like Spiderman

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Well it's how people are supposed to walk is the thing

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Is that our, not to go too deep into it

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But our modern tennis shoes

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Have changed the way people walk for the worse

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You know, that's where a lot of injuries come about

60
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And I'm really getting back to the barefoot walking thing

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Like hands, they're...

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Sorry, sorry for the echo

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And I really love them

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But it makes me think more and more that

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Humanity is not meant to walk on concrete

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Concrete is terrible, terrible, terrible stuff

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And so my feet did not hurt until I walked on concrete

68
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
When I walked on the grass, no more hurt

69
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But it was a good walk

70
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It was a good walk

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I got outside

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Outside

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Going outside is good

74
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Everybody should put down the controller or the keyboard

75
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And go outside once in a while

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
However

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What?

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I was listening to the Mass Effect soundtrack

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's how you can make your worlds collide

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
There you go

81
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Alright, by the way, I apologize

82
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
One of the perks about listening live to Orange Launch Radio

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Is that you can check into the show live

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The check-ins are now up

85
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I forgot to do that because I was sidetracked

86
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
During the pre-show

87
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And I literally sat down seconds before

88
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I picked up the microphone and went live

89
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So the check-ins are now up

90
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
There you go

91
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
For those of you listening on the podcast

92
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You can also check in

93
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Just listen for a little noise

94
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The little victory sound

95
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And then it'll tell you the passphrase

96
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It is somewhere in the show

97
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We have to make sure you're listening to it

98
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So it's somewhere different in the show every week

99
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Anyhow, also say hello to

100
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What?

101
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Damn it, that song is in my head now

102
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The song from An American Tail

103
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's somewhere out there

104
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Is that what the check-in noise sounds like?

105
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No, when you said somewhere

106
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I was like

107
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That song is stuck in my head

108
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I haven't thought of that song in years

109
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Damn it, Rob

110
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm sorry

111
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I don't know what to tell you

112
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I was gonna play this really quick here

113
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
If I can find it here

114
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't know if you've heard this, Darkstalker

115
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I know you don't listen really back to the podcast

116
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Because you're on it

117
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So you don't have to

118
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But this is a little noise

119
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Now, this is not the actual noise

120
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But this is it

121
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Isn't that kind of catchy, right?

122
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah

123
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Now that's gonna get stuck in your head right there

124
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That's a little Bobby Black Wolf original right there

125
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Um, it's like, I have an idea

126
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay

127
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's introduce Loki

128
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Techmaster Loki is here tonight too

129
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Hi

130
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
How are you doing, Loki?

131
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm full now

132
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You're full?

133
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah, because I

134
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Full of rage

135
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I know

136
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I bought one of the Memphis barbecue burgers over at Carl's Jr. Hardee's

137
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That is drenched in barbecue sauce

138
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I normally get the single

139
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And the single is normally enough

140
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I haven't eaten really today

141
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So I was like, okay, I'll go with the $6 burger

142
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I really should have just stuck with the single

143
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The single is enough

144
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But it's delicious

145
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And what makes it delicious is the fact that it combines

146
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Not only a cheeseburger, but pulled pork

147
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So you've got barbecued pulled pork

148
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And a cheeseburger with more barbecue sauce on it

149
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And onion rings

150
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's fantastic

151
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Delicious

152
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I like their Western burger

153
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Western bacon or whatever

154
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yeah, that's not really what I get

155
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But remember we just had this discussion about healthy days

156
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And fat days

157
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
If I have one of those, I'm definitely having a fat day

158
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Because they are not good for you

159
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
That's how I discovered it

160
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Because I normally don't go to Carl's Jr. that much

161
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Because it's further away from my work than normal

162
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The other fast food places

163
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So I was like, I'm tired of eating McDonald's or Burger King

164
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm just going to go to Carl's Jr. today

165
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And so I went there to get the Double Western

166
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And I saw that they had this burger

167
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm like, hey, I like pulled pork

168
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm going to get a single

169
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Because I'm not that hungry

170
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And it was delicious

171
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You know, I swear I don't have delusions or anything

172
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That our show is that big in the scope of things

173
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
We don't have a whole ton of ton of listeners

174
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Though we do love the family we have

175
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That comes participates with us live in the podcast

176
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But it would be great if somebody deemed our audience

177
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Large enough to get a food sponsorship

178
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
With as much as we talk up the different foods

179
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
We need to start censoring all the food titles

180
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
We're going to go get yogurt after the show at

181
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
No, instead what you do is

182
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Instead of doing the beep

183
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You add like a sound file that says nom

184
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So every time you talk about

185
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yeah, I totally had that burger at nom nom nom nom

186
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Get the little kitty nom nom nom

187
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yeah, but then you're talking about editing

188
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's why I like to do live radio

189
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Because it doesn't involve editing

190
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
If you haven't noticed

191
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I also like to do live radio

192
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Because we have the chat room

193
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
At live.vognetwork.com

194
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And Bobby, in reference to me playing the theme

195
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
A little bit before said

196
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Now people are going to think that the check-ins

197
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Are happening that early

198
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Well, gotcha

199
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I just want to make sure everybody was paying attention

200
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So like the people that just

201
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The people that are kind of just doing data entry

202
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
In the background and zoning out and all that

203
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Now that I have your attention

204
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Watermelons

205
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Anyway, let's see, also

206
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
What are the other comments in chat

207
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Oh, Tigerclaw said you can use that sound

208
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
When there's breaking news

209
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But then we can't jack the NBC breaking news theme

210
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Which is so epic

211
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It is epic

212
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You know, as much as people hate NBC

213
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
After the Olympics and all that crap

214
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You have to admit

215
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
NBC gets some epic fucking music

216
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
For their presentations

217
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Like, you know, the Olympic theme

218
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That shit is epic

219
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And I realize John Williams did that

220
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Not some NBC dude

221
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I played that in high school band

222
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And didn't you feel epic?

223
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
We can start stealing

224
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Especially since I played saxophone

225
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And got the little

226
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You know

227
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We can start stealing the Game of Thrones theme

228
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I mean, that's pretty epic too

229
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Or like, you know

230
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
No chair of swords allowed

231
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
But the theme's awesome, okay

232
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Separate from the whole

233
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
If you want awesome

234
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
We should just use the Xena theme

235
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yeah

236
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
No, that's if we want the show to have lesbian undertones

237
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I have no problem with this

238
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Maybe in a future week

239
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
How do you have lesbian undertones

240
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
When there's two men and a woman?

241
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm not sure how that works

242
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
She's double lesbian

243
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I like boobs too

244
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You'll have to like your own boobs though

245
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Unless we get some lady callers later

246
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Which is always a distinct possibility

247
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
When we take live calls from our

248
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Should I ask everyone about their boobs?

249
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Do you want to have booby chat tonight with the callers?

250
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
No, thank you

251
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't know if any of our women

252
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Would call in to do booby chat

253
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Well, Sil would totally do it

254
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
But the show's on too late for her

255
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Because she's on the other side of the pond

256
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And they're eight hours ahead of us

257
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
If you have to stay up anywhere in the UK

258
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Really, no matter where you're at

259
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Britain, Scotland, Ireland

260
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I know we have listeners in all those places

261
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And what time is the show live here?

262
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I miss our Swede

263
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
2 AM

264
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I miss our Swedes

265
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah, we had a couple folks in Sweden

266
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I did see, I don't know if you've looked at email

267
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But we do have an email from Belgium tonight

268
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I love Belgium!

269
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Me too

270
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I love waffles

271
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Such an ignorant statement

272
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
There is so much more to Belgium than just waffles

273
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
There is not, that is not an ignorant statement

274
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I love waffles, okay?

275
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It just reminded me

276
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
There's nothing, alright

277
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Belgium also has wonderful chocolate

278
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Alright, usually we do a kickoff topic at the start

279
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Beer

280
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Usually we do a kickoff topic at the start of the show

281
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I actually don't have a whole lot tonight

282
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Beer

283
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What?

284
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Beer

285
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It should be beer

286
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I want to ask this question

287
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
We have a long weekend next weekend

288
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And it's very likely we probably won't end up doing OLR next weekend

289
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
We'll have to talk about that during the break tonight

290
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But Bobby's not going to be here

291
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
DragonCon's going on next weekend

292
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Because a lot of the cool kids at VOG Network

293
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Like Travis and Brad from Pod Culture

294
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And some of the dudes from Critical Myth and all them

295
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
They're all going to DragonCon

296
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
In Atlanta

297
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That is going on

298
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Penny Arcade Expo is also going on at the same time

299
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And it's Labor Day weekend

300
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So I don't know, we may take the weekend off to

301
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You know, just chill

302
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And sit around and play video games

303
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And Pinkberry

304
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And I'm wondering

305
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And Pinkberry

306
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm wondering if there's any video games

307
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You really need to catch up on

308
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That if we have a three day weekend

309
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
To just sit in your underwear on the couch

310
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
With a giant

311
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
What is that, how did Grandpa describe it on Horde House

312
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The other show

313
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm sitting there in my boxers in my big thing of Pinkberry

314
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Just playing video games or whatever

315
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What video games do you need to be catching up on right now

316
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Because we're about to enter the holiday season

317
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And a shit ton of new games

318
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What games do you want to spend your Labor Day weekend

319
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Catching up on

320
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I propose to my husband of marathoning

321
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Super Mario World

322
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Super Mario World

323
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
However, I also just proposed to Becky

324
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Of marathoning Mass Effect 2 on Saturday

325
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You do that anyway

326
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
No, I play Mass Effect 3 for me

327
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Which means I have to finish it

328
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Before we finish Mass Effect 2 for her

329
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So that I can play through Mass Effect 3 while she watches

330
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You know what would be fun, actually you should try this

331
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Jamie is

332
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Marathoning ROM hacks for Mario Brothers

333
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That would be awesome

334
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I would scream so much

335
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Well not necessarily the ones that are insanely hard

336
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But just the new ones

337
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
They have some really good ROM hacks

338
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That and Link to the Past has some really good ROM hacks

339
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm like

340
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I kind of want to play those because it's different

341
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's like going into Link to the Past

342
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
For the first time again

343
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And it's kind of cool, that sounds really cool to me

344
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Except the whole thing is actually breaking out the systems

345
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And playing

346
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The other thing that we had, we actually just watched a whole

347
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Dan and I watched a whole play through of Vampire Killer on MSX

348
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Which came out after the Castlevania that we got on the NES

349
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But it sort of inspired me to want to actually play through Dracula X again

350
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It sort of sounded like a classic gaming weekend

351
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Sounds like fun

352
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Plus Mass Effect

353
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Maybe it would also be a fun weekend to go out to the flea markets around

354
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And try to find some more classic games

355
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Let's do it

356
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And then

357
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
If it's not 105

358
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And then

359
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
No and then

360
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And then

361
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
No and then

362
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Farmers Market

363
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
No and then

364
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Mexican Candy

365
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Loki got it

366
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Dude, where's my car?

367
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Loki

368
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What do you need to catch up on over the long weekend?

369
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Honestly, what I've been trying to do is stop doing modding stuff

370
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Because I have people that ask me for Grand Theft Auto mod stuff

371
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
They're like, I can't port my map mods over, can you do it for me?

372
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm like, so waste a whole fucking week doing that shit

373
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And it just gets so tiring

374
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Because I'm like, I don't want to do this

375
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
But yet for some stupid reason they keep saying yes, I'll do it for you

376
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So I'd like to just not do that and actually play games

377
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But at the same time, I don't really know what games I'd want to play

378
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I want to play Minecraft on 360 with other people

379
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But there's no one on

380
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
There's a way to burn an entire weekend

381
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Seriously, but there's nobody to play with

382
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
That's the thing

383
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Although I do have one of the people that's on my friends list

384
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
He keeps wanting to play, but it's always when I'm on break at work

385
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm like, dude, I can't play with you right now

386
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Because I'm going to have like five minutes and that's it

387
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Because I'll be on my 360 during break

388
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
But there's no one to play with

389
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I really wish that Minecraft on the 360

390
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Had an option to randomly connect you to a server

391
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
That has, okay, allow strangers to connect

392
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Or something like that

393
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Or have that option where I can allow strangers to connect to my server

394
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Granted, you run the risk of someone going through and griefing and stuff

395
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But you can always ban them

396
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And I would just kind of like that

397
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So I'd be able to play with random people

398
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And actually get a multiplayer game going

399
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's kind of boring with just one or two people

400
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Because we've been playing, we actually started yet another world

401
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And we actually picked the tutorial world this time

402
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Which is kind of fun

403
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Because it made it a little more interesting

404
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Because there's actual things built in, little hidden things to find

405
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And you can, you know, you didn't have to worry about right away

406
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Okay, I need to find stuff to make sticky pistons

407
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Oh, I'll just steal some out of the stuff that's already built

408
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Which is kind of cool

409
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Or hey, you know, I need to go find some diamonds

410
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So they can make some diamond armor and stuff

411
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Oh wait, I know where the hidden thing is

412
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Where there's some diamond stuff

413
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So that's kind of cool

414
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Or I'm gonna need some wood

415
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So I'm gonna just tear down this house instead of those already built

416
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And so that was kind of fun

417
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
For a little bit

418
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And then it got boring again

419
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And that's the problem

420
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's just, it's so far behind

421
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The PC version that it's kind of boring

422
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Whereas like I'm reading about like the cool PC stuff that they're adding now

423
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And like the kind of snapshots for each week

424
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And it sounds pretty awesome

425
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Like they're adding all this new stuff

426
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Like new monsters that look really fucking hard to kill

427
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I mean that would be really cool in the 360 version

428
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
But it's just not there

429
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So I guess I have to start playing the PC version since I bought it

430
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That would be kind of fun

431
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Maybe I should do that

432
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
But once again, I need people to play with

433
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And, you know, I don't want to play with random strangers

434
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Are you upset that I haven't been signing onto Xbox lately?

435
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Is that what this is all about?

436
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Well just everybody

437
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
No one is

438
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I mean like seriously, I can't

439
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I launch Minecraft almost every single day

440
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
There's no one on, ever

441
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
So

442
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That reminds me of WoW

443
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
But yeah, I mean like that

444
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
That's going to start picking up real soon though with the expansion

445
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I mean if I want to go

446
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm not really trying to get into any games right now

447
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Like any, start anything new

448
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Because Borderlands 2 is coming out

449
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And I know that's going to be, you know, big time drain right there

450
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That'll probably be the one game I play

451
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Until Call of Duty Black Ops 2 I think

452
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Let's go to some comments from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

453
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
SSJ100Matt says

454
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I know what Loki can do during the break

455
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Update the OLR PSP site

456
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
That's not going to happen

457
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But much like, so much like

458
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's time to start on the PSV

459
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
OLRPSV.com that doesn't exist yet

460
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But

461
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I don't want to do that

462
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I know

463
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
No one cares anymore

464
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
OLR3DS.com not happening

465
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
No

466
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
OLRWEU.com

467
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
See the problem is

468
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I mean now all these things have web browsers

469
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And hopefully they all support HTML5

470
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And so that's not even an issue anymore

471
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You can just go to our site

472
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
At vognetwork.com and

473
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Just listen

474
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Without having to, you know

475
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
One thing we do need to look into doing

476
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Though at some point is

477
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Remaking the OLR.com site

478
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Because now we kind of have

479
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
A lot of our forum resources

480
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And community resources are pouring in

481
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Trying to pool together with the other shows

482
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
To make vognetwork.com bigger

483
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
OLR.com was probably more about us

484
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And our history and our shows and so forth

485
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So it would be fun to have something for that

486
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You know

487
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It would, to me, I mean

488
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I think it would be kind of cool like how we

489
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Had on the all games

490
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
While back where it was just

491
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
A section of the website, it's like okay

492
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Here's the Orange Launch Radio section, like there's a section

493
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
For each show and just have it linked to that

494
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
And just, you know, make something cool there

495
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
On our own site, on VoG

496
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
So we don't have to like, because we have

497
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Forums already, you know, the forums

498
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And the Orange Launch site are kind of dead

499
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I mean we can just

500
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
They're technically supposed to be closed by now

501
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Because we're going to fold them into the VoG network

502
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
So that's what I'm saying, it's like

503
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Just kind of erase the site

504
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And just, because we were already kind of

505
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Doing everything that we were doing on that site

506
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Anyways, on VoG

507
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
So just kind of move it over

508
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
If you have ideas, we'd love to hear a mailbag

509
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
At orangelaungeradio.com

510
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And some of the folks in chat room were talking about apps

511
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And so forth

512
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I have to learn how to program

513
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
As soon as I learn how to make apps, I know somebody

514
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
That makes apps, but they have other priorities

515
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I almost

516
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Signed up for

517
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Another Kickstarter that had

518
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
A thing on how to make apps

519
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And it looked really cool, but I'm like

520
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Am I really going to sit here and do this?

521
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You're addicted to Kickstarter

522
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Alright, let me get some other answers here

523
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That one took us on a tangent

524
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
How about Locopoco, which I love that name

525
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Because it's like Locoroco's cousin

526
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Locopoco says, I need to catch up on

527
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Folklore, Resonance of Fate

528
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And Valkyria Chronicles, those are all excellent choices

529
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Valkyria Chronicles is one of my

530
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Personal ones too, we've had that on PS3

531
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I don't know how long, and I've yet to make a lot of progress

532
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
In that game, but it's really fun

533
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Tigerclaw says, in reality

534
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Sky just wants to go to Disneyland again

535
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
LOL, in regards to the week off

536
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
A, if I was going to Disneyland, I would not

537
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Do it on Labor Day weekend, because that would be a mad house

538
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
B, I was actually

539
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Supposed to be there tonight, I was originally

540
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Planning a trip that would have had

541
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Alan and I there, well we would have been driving

542
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Tonight, I would have not been at the show

543
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Tonight, been there Monday, Tuesday, but

544
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
We had to cancel that

545
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Rob, not and I, and me

546
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It's an object

547
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
No one Kern, alright

548
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Moving on

549
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Let's see, oh, and lastly

550
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
In reference to the mental image

551
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I put in all your heads earlier

552
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
VxjasonxV in our chat room says

553
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Oh, and now that underwear is involved

554
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Video live stream

555
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Y'all are perverts

556
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I would love to do a live stream

557
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Not of that, of the games

558
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's technology

559
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Well, I do want to do

560
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Live streaming stuff, I have

561
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
About two or three

562
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Capture cards, capture devices

563
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Set that crap up over here, we can do that

564
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's just, it's a little bit

565
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
More complicated, like I always watch

566
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
The playthroughs like

567
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Freddy Wong, they've been doing

568
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
They've been doing a land game

569
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
On PC, Minecraft, and it looks so much

570
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Fun, playing with other people

571
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's just like, okay, everybody gets one life

572
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And we're just gonna work together

573
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And we're gonna do this stuff and then they just kind of

574
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Film it and edit it together and it looks fun

575
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm like, I just want to do that

576
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I want to play with those people

577
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I did not, you got me sidetracked

578
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Though, because in reference to the

579
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Comment that Jason made, now that underwear

580
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Is involved, video live stream, I

581
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Had the chance to play my favorite Tyra Banks

582
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Clip that I haven't played on the show in years

583
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You know, that's gonna be my Labor Day

584
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Weekend right there, panty party

585
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You know, my wife, ever since

586
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
The passing of Whitney Houston has kind of

587
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Latched on to Tyra Banks instead

588
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I've noticed

589
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Kind of like

590
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Kind of observing the

591
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Train wreck that's happening, cause you know

592
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Whitney Houston, well she used to like

593
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Watching Whitney Houston's Facebook page

594
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Because there's a lot of stupid people that comment on there

595
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
But Tyra's page

596
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Tyra comments on

597
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Post a lot of really stupid things

598
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And it's funny

599
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I mean, this has absolutely nothing to do with

600
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Video games, but this is kind of a game

601
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
In itself, and it has to do with Facebook

602
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Which is, you know, big for gaming, right?

603
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
This is hilarious

604
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Go to various fast food

605
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And chain restaurants

606
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
And just go to the thing that lets you see

607
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
What everybody's posting on there

608
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And I'm not even talking like the controversial shit

609
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Like Chick-fil-A, like go on

610
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Facebook and look up like the Olive Gardens

611
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Page, Red Lobster

612
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Applebee's

613
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You will see some amazing

614
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Shit that people post on those

615
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Pages, everywhere from

616
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Complaints about a particular restaurant

617
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
To, you know, somebody

618
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Making a post like

619
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So-and-so just took me here to Applebee's

620
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
For my anniversary, I'm so excited

621
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
There's a picture of them smiling like

622
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Cause people don't understand privacy

623
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Controls

624
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
That just makes me think of a line from one of my favorite

625
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Comics, Henry Cho, who's not related

626
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
To Margaret Cho, although he is Korean

627
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Born in Tennessee

628
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Saying, talking about his

629
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Brother-in-law from Arab

630
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Alabama

631
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Good times

632
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
We just got a new Italian restaurant

633
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It ain't no Olive Garden

634
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I can't help but be reminded

635
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Of that 86 year old

636
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Lady or whatever that reviewed restaurants

637
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
For the local paper and she wrote that huge review

638
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
About the Olive Garden

639
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I don't know where that, she was like in Montana

640
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Or maybe Wisconsin, one of those northern states

641
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And was writing about the local Olive Garden

642
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
That shit was hilarious

643
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
With the buttery breadsticks

644
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Alright, alright, quickly

645
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
My weekend, my plans

646
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
For the weekend, I think it would be really fun

647
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
To do an epic Civ 5

648
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Match that goes all weekend

649
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Long, but I don't know if I can find

650
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Any other suckers that would buy into that

651
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And there's someone who plays on Xbox, but I don't think he plays online

652
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Yeah, but that's

653
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
The Xbox one is different, cause that's the Civ

654
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Revolution and those games can go a lot faster

655
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
You can do one of those in a night, but I'm talking like

656
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Civilization 5 epic mode

657
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Although that would, that game would take

658
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Like months to finish, but you could even

659
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Do just even a normal game

660
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Takes forever in Civilization 5

661
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
That would be fun

662
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
DayZ would be fun too, once, like

663
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I guess that's going back to games

664
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
That would be fun to do like a live stream of

665
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Actually, live streaming PC games might

666
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Well, that might be, it's still difficult

667
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
But yeah, DayZ would be fun

668
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Hey, oh my god, zombies

669
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Here we go

670
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Crazy person

671
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
The other game I really need to catch up on is

672
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Borderlands

673
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
But let's be real

674
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
There's so much happening on Tuesday between

675
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The official launch of Guild Wars 2

676
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
The patch in Warcraft

677
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Rock Band Blitz

678
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Mass Effect 3 DLC

679
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
There's no way I'm playing catch up over the weekend

680
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Cause I have to play everything that came out on Tuesday

681
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
That's the problem

682
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You don't really need to play through Borderlands 1 anyways

683
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Because they just kinda, all they have

684
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
The characters have cameos

685
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And that's about it, but

686
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I just wanna play it cause I was having fun with it

687
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And I just stopped because of my MMOs

688
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
And other games I was playing

689
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Oh yeah, Alan has it too

690
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
There you go

691
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Bobby's the one to play too

692
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
There we go, the foursome

693
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Alright, let's talk about our actual gaming weeks

694
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
The stuff we have been playing this week

695
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
More current stuff, yeah

696
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Can I say one more thing about the week in general

697
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Of course

698
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I did a good deed this weekend

699
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
We rescued a kitten from the dumpster

700
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Outside my synagogue

701
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Now, before people start crying

702
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
You found out nobody left the cat in the dumpster

703
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
He was feral

704
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Little faith in humanity restored

705
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Yeah, he was feral

706
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
He fell in looking for food

707
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I sat him in my lap, he clawed the crap out of me

708
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And then calmed down

709
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Got him some water, got him some food

710
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
A nice lady downtown

711
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
He was taken care of by a lady downtown

712
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And he's going to Animal Outreach

713
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
On Monday

714
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Where they're gonna get him shot

715
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Tested for leukemia

716
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Fixed and adopted out

717
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
So I just wanted to say for anyone who's asked

718
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
The kitty's story has a happy ending

719
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Yay, meow meow

720
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
His official name is Donut

721
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
They've called him Donut

722
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Instead of Batcat

723
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
That's a good name, I like Donut

724
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I'm just glad I don't have those cats in our backyard anymore

725
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
11 cats at one time

726
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
All I know is I got a text message from Dark Soccer

727
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
On Friday night, do you want a kitten?

728
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And I'm like, um

729
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
We have a tiny ass apartment and two cats already

730
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I would love

731
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
to, but no

732
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Yeah, Shermy would be too old for me to have a little feral kitten in the house

733
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
To tame

734
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
He's only six weeks old, so he's tammable

735
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Alright, before we get into our regular gaming weeks

736
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And what we have been playing

737
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I do want to talk to the chatters

738
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
WhatupG leaves a comment about Tuesday

739
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Saying Sky forgot the biggest

740
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
game release, Madden 13

741
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Although certainly I will acknowledge

742
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
That will be a huge game release

743
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And lots of people are going to be playing that over the Labor Day weekend

744
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
My household won't be one of them

745
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Cause we just, that's not really a series

746
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
We've ever gotten into

747
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I'm not a big football person

748
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
And if you're not a fan of that, and for whatever reason you just

749
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Don't download games off the Playstation

750
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
There's a Journey collector's edition coming out this week

751
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
On disc

752
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It's got the soundtrack, you get Journey

753
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Flower of Flow

754
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And also two

755
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Little quick games that they made

756
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And a month of Playstation Plus

757
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
That's a great deal if

758
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
You don't have any of those games

759
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Cause all three of those games are great

760
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Well, I don't even know if you could call

761
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Flow a game, but whatever

762
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It's alright

763
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
They're neat, but Journey is

764
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Amazing

765
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Contender for game of the year to be honest

766
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Alright, not that Journey

767
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
It's a Journey 2012 Journey

768
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
That might make it a little bit better if it had Journey music in there

769
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
But their music was pretty good

770
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Little mishmash, I'm sure somebody's done that on YouTube

771
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Journey set to Journey? I've seen it

772
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
But the music in Journey 2012

773
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Is legitimately really good

774
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Like, as much as I love Journey

775
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
1980's

776
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
You can't do that

777
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
To Journey 2012

778
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
The music in Journey 2012 is so flippin' good

779
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Can we get a Journey 2012

780
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
2 where it's basically

781
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
The premise of Revolution X

782
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
But with Journey

783
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Instead, you know

784
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Wouldn't that be kinda cool?

785
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Dude on the toilet at the beginning of the game

786
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
If Steve Perry was talking to any of the others

787
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Whatsoever, maybe

788
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Although, well, the guy they have now

789
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
The guy they have now, number one, is hot

790
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Number two, has really nice hair

791
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
And number three, can sing

792
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Don't get me wrong, he's really good

793
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
And he can sing, and yes, I have seen Journey live recently

794
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
When he was the front man, they were really good

795
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I know, but

796
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I mean, I don't know

797
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
There's something about, you can't put a Journey

798
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
80's sequel in arcades

799
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And not have Steve Perry involved

800
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I don't know, it just would feel weird

801
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Maybe it's Steve Perry being like

802
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
The bad guy

803
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
He's the super villain trying to get revenge on the band

804
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
It's like new Journey albums

805
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Quick, name a Journey single after

806
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
The 1980's

807
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Yep, yeah

808
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
That's what I thought, alright

809
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Anyhow, your gaming week

810
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
What have you been playing this week, Dark Soccer?

811
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Uh, WoW

812
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Mass Effect 2, Mass Effect 3

813
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Um, the Mass Effect thingy

814
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
On my phone, since I'm trying to get my rating back up

815
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Um, and

816
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Uh, yeah

817
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
That's really good

818
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Same old stuff for you

819
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
That's not bad, I mean, it's not like you're playing bad games

820
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
And watching a lot of playthroughs

821
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Okay

822
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Like, Dan and I had our big Castlevania fit

823
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
The other day

824
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
But you guys like to do that, you like to go on YouTube

825
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
And watch all the playthroughs, like that's something you guys do

826
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Dan likes to do that

827
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Every so often I'll just get invested and watch

828
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Do you ever do the live stuff?

829
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Do you guys ever go onto one of those sites like Ustream

830
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Or Twitch.tv or whatever other sites

831
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
There are and watch the live stream?

832
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Nah

833
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
But that's because you and the hubby are more classic gamers

834
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
More than anything, yeah

835
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I mean, I wouldn't mind doing like a

836
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Episodic playthrough of something

837
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
But, you know

838
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I like watching other people do it

839
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Except it kind of bugs me because, I mean, it is

840
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Truly what an almost perfect playthrough

841
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Looks like because they're usually, um

842
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Machine assisted, you know

843
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Tigerclaw wants to know if you're going to get the Mass Effect 3

844
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Leviathan DLC

845
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Fuck yes

846
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
As if that should surprise anybody whatsoever

847
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I am so excited, you guys

848
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
That's why I kind of don't want to beat my game yet

849
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
You finally set foot in multiplayer

850
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Not that long ago

851
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And I couldn't find anybody else on

852
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Because no one would let me know when they were playing

853
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
We need to make that happen again

854
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Well, for me, I have to change out my EXE

855
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Because I have a hacked EXE so I can play in god mode

856
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
But I saved my original file

857
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
So that I can switch out for multiplayer

858
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Tigerclaw, I just want to give a plug

859
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
There's a lot of classic games played on Twitch.tv

860
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
There are people doing speedruns on old Mario games

861
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
That's cool

862
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I just don't like to watch it live, I guess

863
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Unless it's for charity

864
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Okay, like Mario Marathon you're down with

865
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
That's understandable

866
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And even then I'm like, dude, you're still playing Sunshine, why?

867
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I like Sunshine

868
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Wait a minute, didn't you say Sunshine was a good game on last week's show?

869
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I like Sunshine, but it's kind of boring to watch it

870
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Like

871
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Even as much as I love Mario 64

872
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
It's kind of boring to watch it

873
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Understandable

874
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Alright, Loki, how about you?

875
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
How was your gaming week?

876
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
This week I played lots of Minecraft

877
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Mainly

878
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Little bit of Grand Theft Auto because I was

879
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Working on mods

880
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And stuff

881
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
But yeah

882
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Going back to Minecraft though

883
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
We started a new map

884
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
That's a tutorial level, which is kind of fun

885
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I had to start off on that

886
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And then played through a little bit of that

887
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And I actually went back last night

888
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
To my VoG map

889
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
And was working a little bit more in peaceful mode too

890
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I was finishing up some minecart stations

891
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
They make the little

892
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Bell

893
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Intro thing when they

894
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Stop and then it waits like

895
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Five seconds or so and then it makes that noise

896
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Again and then goes automatically

897
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Have you figured out what worlds you should be playing on

898
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
To get the awesome

899
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Stuff? Like, I'm sure people out there

900
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Post on forums like

901
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Oh, use this seed, it's the best or something like that

902
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
There's all sorts of seeds

903
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
For different things, but it

904
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Doesn't really matter

905
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
The only kind of unique thing there on some of the seeds

906
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
There are like

907
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Landscape I guess

908
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And then there's a few that have like the golden apples

909
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Hidden in there and chests and stuff

910
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
But it's just

911
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
That's pretty much it

912
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
If you restart your levels

913
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Or start new seeds now, there's clay

914
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Which I never used anyway

915
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
So it's not a big deal

916
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And then

917
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
You know, slimes, I guess slime farms

918
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Are kind of important now that they're sticky

919
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Pistons and that kind of thing

920
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
But I don't know

921
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I haven't really bothered to

922
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
You know, find those

923
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Usually I just try to find some interesting

924
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Looking

925
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Landscape and stuff

926
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
But even now it's just kind of

927
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
It's kind of boring going back to that stuff

928
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Just waiting for the next update

929
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
The adventure update I think is going to make it a lot more fun

930
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
But we'll have to see

931
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
So anyways, Minecraft stuff

932
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And then I actually played

933
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
A little bit of new stuff

934
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I played more Sleeping Dogs again

935
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
For some reason my save

936
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Like I had done a bunch of missions

937
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And my save just didn't save or something

938
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I must have forgotten the save

939
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Or it didn't auto save or whatever

940
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And so I'm having to redo a bunch of missions

941
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
So I did that

942
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Today and then

943
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
One new game I actually picked up

944
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I picked up

945
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
What was it? Scott Pilgrim vs. The World

946
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I don't know why they picked that up at launch

947
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
It was fucking amazing

948
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Yeah, I thought you had bought that at launch

949
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
So I finally got around to playing it

950
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
My only gripe about it

951
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And this is just kind of a weird thing

952
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Is that the stages are too long

953
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Like I'm trying to fit in

954
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Playing a stage with my friend at work

955
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And we tried our 15 minute breaks

956
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
There's just no way to beat the first stage in 15 minutes

957
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
So we tried during lunch

958
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Where we had an hour

959
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And it actually

960
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Got to the boss and that was about it

961
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
But we didn't get to beat it because we ran out of time

962
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
So the stages are a little long

963
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
In my game, since it's more like an arcade game

964
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
But

965
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
It's really awesome

966
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
The animation is amazing

967
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I love the way it looks and sounds

968
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
It's just a really fantastic game

969
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Really cool, recommend checking it out

970
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Kind of disappointed the stages are so long

971
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Because it does make it hard to play on break

972
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And then beyond that

973
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I think that's all I've played this week

974
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Yeah

975
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Alrighty

976
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Oh, how's your little con...

977
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I know this will be over by the time

978
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
The podcast hits, but for the live folks

979
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
That contest thing you're doing, how's that going?

980
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
As of right now I'm in the first place

981
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
And what that means is

982
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Assuming I win, which I'm probably going to

983
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Unless this one chick gets

984
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
A couple more retweets

985
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I'm going to have them

986
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Draw me a picture

987
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Of myself dressed as Tingle

988
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
That is going to be the closest you'll get

989
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
That's still pretty awesome

990
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
And she's a pretty awesome artist

991
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
So expect that

992
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
An OLR in-joke will finally

993
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Come to an end, although we all know

994
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It's not going to come to an end whatsoever

995
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
However, it will finally reach the next step

996
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Some resolution, yes

997
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
If you can get

998
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Because you don't want to just win

999
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
You want to win big

1000
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
And we want Footy's Kickstarter to do well

1001
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
It's really

1002
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I guess it's really

1003
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
About that

1004
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
That's really it

1005
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
They're doing okay

1006
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
But I'm kind of worried that they may not

1007
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Hit their goal

1008
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
They're just under $6,000

1009
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Of $10,000

1010
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
They've got 11 days left

1011
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Sometimes those last few days are the biggest

1012
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I think they can do it

1013
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
It looks like a pretty cool game

1014
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
They're not asking for too much

1015
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
If you want to check it out

1016
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It's Evilot

1017
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
It's E-V-I-L-O-T

1018
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
The game looks a little similar to

1019
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Zombies with

1020
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
What was that?

1021
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I'm trying to remember the original name of the game

1022
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
It was like, Hey Bad Man

1023
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Why?

1024
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
It was a game on PSP

1025
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
It was like where you play the villain basically

1026
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
So it looks cool

1027
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
It should be neat

1028
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Alright, Mike Gaming Week

1029
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Kind of like Dark Soccer

1030
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I played a lot of the same stuff that you're used to hearing me talk about

1031
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Like World of Warcraft

1032
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
And was continuing to play

1033
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Sound Shapes

1034
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I don't know why the name escaped me for a minute

1035
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I was playing more Sound Shapes

1036
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I was playing Mario 2 still

1037
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
However, there is one new game I spent

1038
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
A pretty good chunk of time playing

1039
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
It technically started on Friday

1040
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
It's Guild Wars 2

1041
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I have spent some time playing

1042
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I didn't get to play a lot a lot

1043
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Because I was in San Francisco this weekend

1044
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Hanging out with Grandpa from Horde House

1045
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
But on Friday night

1046
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And a little bit today

1047
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I'm at Guild Wars 2

1048
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I'm up to about level 10

1049
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
So I'm not sure I've really had

1050
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
A full amount of time to really flesh out

1051
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
What I think about this game

1052
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
A lot of the things that were bugging me about it

1053
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
At first, I'm easing up on a little bit

1054
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And it all has to do with

1055
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
You know, the Guild Wars 2 model

1056
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Because you know the pricing model is a lot different

1057
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
For Guild Wars 2

1058
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
You pay the one fee to get the game

1059
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
And then you never have to pay

1060
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Like a monthly fee or anything again

1061
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Like no monthly fee

1062
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
But now they're adding a little more of the free to play

1063
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Elements in it

1064
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Like you can go into the online shop

1065
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
And buy like sunglasses for your character

1066
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
You know, dumb little things

1067
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
But there are some

1068
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Like basically steroids

1069
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Performance enhancing things you can get

1070
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Like you know, short time XP bonuses

1071
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
And things like that you can kind of get in the shop

1072
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
With real money

1073
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
One of the things that started to irritate me

1074
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Is that I got a chest that dropped

1075
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And the key I needed to open it

1076
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Was something to buy in the store

1077
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
And I was like, oh that's bullshit

1078
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
That's such bullshit that you

1079
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
You know, I was going to rage because that's a Facebook game

1080
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
But then finally, I don't know if I got it as a quest reward

1081
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I think I got it as a quest reward around level 10

1082
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I did get one of those keys

1083
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
So it doesn't bug me nearly as much

1084
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
If you can get it in the game by doing a lot of grinding

1085
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
You know, either you're going to be free to play

1086
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Or you're going to be

1087
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
You know, not free to play

1088
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I still think Guild Wars 2

1089
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Despite that bitch

1090
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Is relatively minor bitch

1091
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I'm really impressed with a lot of what I've seen so far

1092
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Graphically, it's

1093
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
It's really nice

1094
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
It's a wonderfully presented game

1095
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
You know, there's always

1096
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
That temptation to compare MMOs

1097
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
To World of Warcraft, but this game

1098
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Doesn't really feel like World of Warcraft

1099
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And I think one big reason

1100
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
For that is they've managed

1101
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
To figure out a new way to do quests

1102
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
There are no yellow exclamation marks

1103
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Over people's heads

1104
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
And it's not like the Final Fantasy XI style

1105
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Questing either

1106
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Basically what happens is that

1107
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
You have this giant map

1108
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
And I gotta say

1109
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
There's a little thing I love about this game

1110
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
And that is when you go to the map

1111
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
The way the map appears is your camera

1112
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Actually pans down

1113
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
And does like

1114
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
It does a subtle transition to the actual map

1115
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
But it makes it look like

1116
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
You're on Google Maps

1117
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And then it zooms back in to show your character

1118
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
The way it does that transition

1119
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
It's one of those little things

1120
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
That really makes you go

1121
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
That's so cool

1122
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
And then Shane found out you could draw on the map

1123
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Like it's a Madden thing

1124
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
You could draw the plays on the map

1125
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Anyhow, questing

1126
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
So you go on the map and you'll find these little scouts

1127
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And the scouts will tell you these things

1128
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
So and so is in trouble and needs help

1129
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
This person is having to deal with this conflict

1130
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Going on right now and could use some help

1131
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
This person is near the cave and da da da

1132
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
So the scouts will tell you where these people are

1133
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
And then they draw the little hearts on your map

1134
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And you go over to the hearts

1135
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And then when you're in that general area

1136
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
The game will tell you either kill these things

1137
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Collect these things

1138
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
You know, kind of the general MMO stuff

1139
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
But you get to pick what you want to do

1140
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Do you want to kill? Do you want to collect? What do you want to do?

1141
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And as you do those, you start to gain

1142
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
It's like mini reputation grinds

1143
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Little mini reputation grinds

1144
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
They don't take you any more than like 30 minutes

1145
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
And then the person, the heart fills in

1146
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
And that person will start selling you gear and stuff

1147
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And you've basically completed the quest

1148
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And you get like gold and XP

1149
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And the typical things

1150
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Now generally in these areas as well

1151
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Somebody could start an event quest

1152
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And the event quest is like the public questing

1153
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Which a lot of MMOs besides WoW have in them

1154
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
And even WoW is getting it to some extent

1155
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
With the scenarios in Pandaria

1156
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
But like Warhammer

1157
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Was a game that did this very well

1158
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Was the whole public questing

1159
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And I gotta say with the Guild Wars launch going on

1160
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I mean it was crazy, like in the starter area

1161
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
It would be like so and so needs help

1162
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Eradicating the mosquitoes from the village

1163
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Because you know it's like a level 2 quest or whatever

1164
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And then suddenly like a big orange circle appears on your map

1165
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And all these mosquitoes are everywhere

1166
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
There's like 75 people everywhere

1167
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Killing mosquitoes and you just watch the bar go

1168
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And it like fills right up

1169
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And then you get a medal based on your contribution

1170
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
And the medal gives you experience, gold, and karma points

1171
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And karma points you turn around and use to buy gear

1172
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
So I gotta say

1173
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I love that they've really challenged themselves to think outside the box

1174
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And not make a clone of the successful formula

1175
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
But as MMO fans

1176
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
What do we think MMOs ought to offer?

1177
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And it really does feel like in that regard

1178
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Guild Wars 2 is taking MMOs to the next level

1179
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I really think that

1180
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I think it's giving a lot of

1181
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I don't want to turn into a Guild Wars 2 vs. WoW thing

1182
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I love WoW, I can't say

1183
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Oh Guild Wars 2 is going to kick its ass, whatever

1184
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
And I totally disagree with people that are like

1185
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Oh WoW is dead

1186
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Oh WoW is so dead

1187
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
The panda people is stupid

1188
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
It's a little kid and Guild Wars is going to kill it

1189
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I've been saying every game is going to kill WoW

1190
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
WoW will continue to exist

1191
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
But I gotta say Guild Wars 2

1192
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Really brings something else to the table with that

1193
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And one other little thing about Guild Wars 2

1194
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
That I love

1195
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
They brought vista points into the game

1196
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Which I remember from a racing game called Fuel

1197
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
From a couple years ago

1198
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
You remember that game Fuel?

1199
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
You remember how there would be places on the map

1200
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
You would drive to that it's just a really gorgeous view

1201
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
And you got points for that

1202
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
And I think Assassin's Creed does something like this too

1203
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
At least somebody was joking with me

1204
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
And I haven't played that series a lot

1205
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
But basically you go to these points on the map

1206
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And you might have to interact with the environment a little

1207
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Like you'll have to find the little mushrooms

1208
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
You have to jump up to get to the top of the building

1209
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
And then once you get up there they'll be a little book

1210
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And you press the button

1211
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
And all of a sudden you'll go to a cutscene

1212
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Where the camera will do this gorgeous pan

1213
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
And show you everything around you

1214
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
And then 60 XP for finding the vista point

1215
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And it's marked on your map

1216
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I thought that was so awesome

1217
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Like it's something else to do that's not

1218
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Grinding a dungeon or whatever

1219
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
It's just neat

1220
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
There's a lot about Guild Wars 2 that's just different

1221
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
It sounds like they could have it

1222
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Like you know there's people that kind of

1223
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Challenge themselves to play like a pacifist

1224
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
That you could probably level up

1225
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
You don't get enough XP

1226
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
However, yeah the passive

1227
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Because you could go to these areas where they're like

1228
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Because to help all the people

1229
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
You can

1230
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Collect kumquats or whatever

1231
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
And turn them in or you can collect things

1232
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
And turn them in usually

1233
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I think a pacifist, and you get XP from gathering too

1234
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
So I think a pacifist could do very well

1235
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
In Guild Wars 2

1236
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
To be honest

1237
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Although I honestly haven't played the game enough

1238
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I haven't played it past level 10

1239
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
So I can't give you like a full full review

1240
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
But I, despite some of my minor bitches

1241
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
About what the free to play

1242
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Traditional free to play mechanic is doing

1243
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
To the game

1244
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Despite my minor bitches there

1245
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I really love some of the stuff they are trying to do

1246
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
A couple other quick things

1247
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I want to say about Guild Wars 2

1248
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
We will move on with the show

1249
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
But this is the new game

1250
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
A lot of people are going to be talking about this game

1251
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
PvP

1252
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
If you elect to do PvP

1253
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Which you don't have to do

1254
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
But you go into your character and you hit the PvP button

1255
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
And you basically get transported

1256
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
To a whole new PvP world

1257
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Where your character is suddenly max level

1258
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
And you're automatically a template

1259
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
And you can pick whatever skills

1260
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And your PvP gear is separate

1261
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
You separated the PvP game

1262
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
From the PvE game

1263
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
But you get to have your same character

1264
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
And when you design your character

1265
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
You get to pick your favorite colors on the garb

1266
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And all that stuff

1267
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
So it's like you still have a sense of character

1268
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
But it's like a completely separate copy

1269
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Of that character in PvP

1270
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
And if you never want to touch PvP ever ever

1271
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
You don't have to, it's like a separate little thing

1272
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
And character design is great

1273
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Because they kind of do a little bit of the mass effect

1274
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Thing with it

1275
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Where you pick like

1276
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Did your character in their vision

1277
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
See a snow leopard, a stag

1278
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
And you make those types of decisions

1279
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
That ultimately affect your story

1280
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I think my character saw a white stag

1281
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
And that has been a big part of the story

1282
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I've been playing so far

1283
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
So they have definitely taken some Bioware

1284
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
The people designing this game

1285
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Clearly love

1286
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
All these different types of video games

1287
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
And have now made the video game they want to be playing

1288
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
And for the most part it's like 98% successful

1289
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
From what I've seen so far

1290
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I'd play if I had the 60 bucks to afford it

1291
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
That's the problem is dropping the money up front

1292
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
You know it's an investment

1293
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I mean whereas you know

1294
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I've already got wow I'm already in the blood pact

1295
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Sure sure

1296
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
But that's the other thing I like about Guild Wars is that once you buy it

1297
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
You know if I don't go back to it ever

1298
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
It'll be there 6 months now

1299
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
12 months from now

1300
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
One other thing I'll say about this

1301
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
The guild system is pretty awesome

1302
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Oh and then I'm going to give you one more negative

1303
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
So the guild system is pretty awesome

1304
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Once you form your little guild

1305
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Every little thing that you do during the day

1306
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Kind of contributes points to the guild's total

1307
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
And you can use those points to buy perks

1308
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
So it's kind of like what they were

1309
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Going to do with World of Warcraft's

1310
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Guild leveling system

1311
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
But they actually did it where the guild master can elect

1312
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
What guild perks you're going to build

1313
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
You know do you want the guild to have an XP bonus

1314
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Or a money bonus

1315
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Or what is it that you want

1316
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
And you can like use the resources to build those

1317
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Which is pretty cool

1318
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Now the place I'm going to knock it a little bit is that

1319
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
This is actually a big one

1320
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I'm glad I thought of this because I got to knock the game for this

1321
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
It's an issue

1322
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
They did this whole 3 day launch thing right

1323
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
So there's a lot of people that aren't really going to be in the game until Tuesday

1324
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
And some of the servers are already full

1325
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
And you don't get to pick

1326
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
One server for each character

1327
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
You pick one server

1328
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
For all of your characters

1329
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Now there's a system in the game

1330
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Where I guess you can have

1331
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
People from other servers

1332
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Kind of like in a real ID

1333
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Kind of way they can guest in your game

1334
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
And you can still kind of party

1335
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Cross server and there is a lot

1336
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
You can do cross server

1337
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
But the one thing you can't do cross server is guild

1338
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
The server I'm on

1339
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Filled up in like a day

1340
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
So if people want to try to get on that server

1341
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
It's full

1342
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
So what if I have friends like Jamie say

1343
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Who haven't bought the game yet

1344
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
And then they're going to try and get on my server

1345
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
It's going to be too bad, it's full

1346
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I kind of think that's bullshit

1347
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
That she can't join my guild because that filled up

1348
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Because all the early people have the space

1349
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
They need to have a system

1350
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Where she can still get into that server

1351
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Now

1352
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
To be fair

1353
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I understand that they are doing some type of

1354
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Open transfer for 7 days

1355
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
They're going to allow you to switch worlds

1356
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
However much you want for 7 days

1357
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
So that people can kind of settle down

1358
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Find a home and get off the populated servers

1359
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
And all that stuff

1360
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
However they're going to charge for that later on

1361
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
And I still think it's kind of bullshit

1362
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Like there needs to be a way

1363
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
If I have a friend on the server

1364
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Remember how Final Fantasy 11 did the world passes

1365
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I thought that was a good way to do it

1366
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
If the server is populated make it expensive

1367
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
To bring somebody on the server

1368
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
But still make it possible

1369
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
So that part

1370
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Sucks and needs to be rethought

1371
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
A little bit

1372
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
But otherwise

1373
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I'm really cool with Guild Wars 2

1374
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
So I've talked 20 minutes about Guild Wars 2

1375
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
But it's a big game

1376
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
So there you go that's my gaming week

1377
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Finally

1378
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So let's talk about housekeeping

1379
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Twitter.com slash olr

1380
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Facebook.com slash orange lounge radio

1381
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
And I didn't really clear this with Loki

1382
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Before the show but I don't think he's going to care

1383
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
We're not doing a show next week

1384
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
For Labor Day

1385
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
And it's because

1386
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
PAX you're all on vacation

1387
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
You know what just enjoy

1388
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
The long weekend we will try to have something

1389
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Special that does play live on the feed

1390
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Like a best of or an oldie moldy

1391
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Classic episode or something for those

1392
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Few of you that will still be there on Sunday night

1393
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
But if you know what

1394
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
If you have an opportunity to go out and get a

1395
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Rest and vacation a little bit enjoy

1396
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
It I guess that would also be

1397
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
We have to remember not every country is

1398
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Getting a three day weekend that's mostly an America

1399
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Holiday not really celebrated

1400
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Other places however please understand

1401
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
We do want to take the rare opportunity

1402
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
To go have a three day weekend and you know

1403
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Take a road trip if we want or what have you

1404
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I'm toying with the idea of taking a little

1405
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Quick road trip for the weekend

1406
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
We'll see I think it will be fun

1407
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Of course sitting on my big butt and playing video games

1408
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
All day long will be great too

1409
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Civ 5 uber match yeah

1410
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I just think it's kind of weird that like school

1411
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Is starting this week

1412
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
And then there's Labor Day

1413
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
So like two days of magazine class

1414
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
No day of magazine class

1415
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
School year has been like that for forever

1416
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
So alright

1417
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Alright let's get into some gaming news

1418
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
And talk about what is going on

1419
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
In the gaming world and unfortunately

1420
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I better cue the Debbie Downer horns

1421
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Cause it doesn't start off pretty

1422
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Does it Loki? No layoffs

1423
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
It's more and more layoffs

1424
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
So PopCap they were hit

1425
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
With layoffs internationally

1426
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
And at least so they kind of

1427
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
The way they did it

1428
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
At least they were talking about

1429
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
What happens in the industry

1430
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
And they try to like kind of make it

1431
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
You know

1432
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
They didn't kind of hide it

1433
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
From the public I guess

1434
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
And so basically

1435
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
They have

1436
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Shrunk down I guess

1437
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Shanghai's studio

1438
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Also in Seattle they let

1439
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
50 people go

1440
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And Dublin was shut down

1441
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
So you know

1442
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Quite a bit of layoffs

1443
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
They said that you know

1444
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I guess

1445
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
They made a statement

1446
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
And I

1447
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Just think it's kind of interesting the way they did it

1448
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
You know basically you know

1449
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
You know 12 years ago

1450
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
We founded PopCap we never imagined the games

1451
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
We'd made the vast number of people

1452
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
You know who'd play those games

1453
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Or the success that followed and so on and so forth

1454
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
And then you know

1455
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
This morning we informed our employees

1456
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Of a reorganization in our studios

1457
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
That will include a reduction in force

1458
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
In North America operations

1459
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Mostly our headquarters here in Seattle

1460
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
And an exploratory

1461
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Consultation to evaluate

1462
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
The future of our PopCap office

1463
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
In Dublin

1464
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Ireland

1465
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
And now in English reduction in force

1466
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Means that some people are losing their jobs

1467
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Exploratory consultation means

1468
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
We're taking our Dublin team

1469
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
About the future of that

1470
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Or talking to our Dublin team about the future of that office

1471
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
And whether we can find a path to improve

1472
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Our profitability in Europe without having to

1473
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Close operations. Today's news is something

1474
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
You expect periodically from companies

1475
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
In a fast changing industry but it sucks

1476
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
If you're one of those people losing his or her jobs

1477
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
These people are our friends

1478
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
And we don't like doing this

1479
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
So at least they're being very personable about it

1480
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
And just like you know

1481
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I think that's the way you do it right there

1482
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
However I think

1483
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
There's another pink elephant in the room

1484
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
And allow me to echo the

1485
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Pink elephant? Yeah

1486
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Pink elephant that stands out

1487
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Isn't that when you just drink a lot?

1488
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
You see pink elephants?

1489
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
No I've always heard the pink elephant in the room

1490
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Is the obvious thing or whatever

1491
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Anyway you're derailing me

1492
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
The pink elephant in the room in this

1493
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
And allow me to echo the rest of the internet

1494
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
In this is

1495
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I don't understand

1496
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Why PopCap?

1497
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Is PopCap struggling?

1498
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I thought out of all the

1499
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Gaming companies out there

1500
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
PopCap was doing a lot of things right

1501
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
And granted your whole memo

1502
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
And everything you're talking about there is

1503
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
An example of some of the things they do right

1504
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
A lot of us had a great fear

1505
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
When EA bought them

1506
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Something like this would happen

1507
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
They go into why

1508
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
And basically

1509
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
A little context on why we're making cuts

1510
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
In some areas and why we're investing and expanding

1511
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
In others, in past years

1512
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
We've seen dramatic change in the way people play

1513
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
And pay for games

1514
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Free to play, social and mobile games have

1515
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Exploded in popularity, that happened fast

1516
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Surprisingly so

1517
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
The change in consumer taste requires

1518
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Us to reorganize our business and

1519
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Invest in new types of games on new

1520
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Platforms, it's a completely different world

1521
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
From where we started, that's why

1522
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I still

1523
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Does not make sense

1524
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
And granted PopCap

1525
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Wasn't putting out a lot of games

1526
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Maybe unfortunately there was

1527
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Just too much that was in development

1528
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
That was costing them too much money

1529
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Too much in development, not enough out on the table

1530
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
But still, how fucking huge

1531
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Was Plants vs. Zombies

1532
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
But Jeweled

1533
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
But Jeweled changed

1534
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
The industry in some ways

1535
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
But Jeweled was one of the first Facebook

1536
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Games, period

1537
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Everybody knows what kind of

1538
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Jackpagle is

1539
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I don't understand

1540
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I get it when game companies

1541
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
As much as this pained me

1542
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
When Bizarre Creations closed

1543
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I understood that Blur

1544
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Was not very well received

1545
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
And that the Geometry Wars games were kind of

1546
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Losing steam and all that

1547
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
And that they weren't doing the PGR games anymore

1548
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I kind of saw the economics in that

1549
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I don't get it here

1550
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Despite everything that they're saying there

1551
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I can't help as a fan

1552
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
That this company was doing very well

1553
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Before EA bought them

1554
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I can't help but think

1555
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Despite what they're saying

1556
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Something's up

1557
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Well maybe

1558
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Because they are bought by EA

1559
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
The investors thought

1560
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Hey, there's too much overhead on this company

1561
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
And so we need to cut back

1562
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
In order to make it more profitable

1563
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
So EA just jacked all the franchise

1564
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
EA just snatched Jeweled

1565
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Snatched Plants vs. Zombies

1566
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Worked for Zynga

1567
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Of course they're seeing though that that's not the case

1568
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
They said if we didn't have EA behind us

1569
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
The cuts would have been worse

1570
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
So, I don't know

1571
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I'd have to

1572
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I wouldn't really know what to do until I saw a financial report

1573
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Honestly

1574
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
It's just weird

1575
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Maybe because everything is free to play

1576
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Like for example in Jeweled Blitz

1577
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
And stuff like that on Facebook

1578
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
That no one's actually buying the games anymore

1579
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Maybe that's why

1580
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
You think of not enough people buying

1581
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Those power ups and the things that

1582
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Maybe

1583
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Substantiate the free to play model

1584
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Maybe not

1585
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Maybe because of PopCap's style

1586
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
They've always been pretty good about not shoving that shit

1587
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Down your throat like Zynga Games do

1588
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
That maybe

1589
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Unfortunately being nice isn't profitable

1590
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Maybe

1591
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I don't think that it was a lack of that

1592
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I thought that they had very innovative ways of getting

1593
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
The games out there

1594
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
I've got a

1595
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Special version of PEGL that teamed with Valve

1596
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
That came out

1597
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
When they were doing

1598
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
It was like a special PEGL

1599
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
That had Portal stuff in there

1600
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
And Team Fortress and everything

1601
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
And it was free

1602
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
It's like if you liked this, here's the full game

1603
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Here's the whole thing

1604
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
The Plants vs. Zombies stuff in WoW

1605
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
The PEGL add-on

1606
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Which I played a lot of the PEGL add-on

1607
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
And really wish it was still available

1608
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
They really did look into

1609
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Getting it out there in different ways

1610
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
And I think that

1611
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
If they had been able to keep that up

1612
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Then maybe this wouldn't happen

1613
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
But I'm not sure

1614
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I really don't know what to say

1615
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Until I see a financial report

1616
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Tigerclaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says

1617
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Could it be that people are finally

1618
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Getting tired of playing

1619
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Casual games?

1620
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Nah

1621
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
No

1622
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Here's the thing

1623
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
If you mean casual games to mean Facebook games

1624
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Maybe

1625
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I think what's going to happen to Facebook games

1626
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Is what happened in the video game crash of 84

1627
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Which is there's just so much shit

1628
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
In the market

1629
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
And a lot of commercialized shit

1630
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
And money grabbing shit that isn't worth it

1631
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
There's just so much shit out there

1632
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
It's going to crack

1633
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
And people aren't feeling all that great about Facebook

1634
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
These days anyway

1635
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I feel like

1636
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
The other shoe is going to drop on Facebook

1637
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Any day now

1638
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
If there could actually be a competitor that could come in

1639
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I realize Google Plus is out there

1640
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
But Google

1641
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Kind of just couldn't do it for whatever reason

1642
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
If there's somebody

1643
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
That really gave the public what they wanted

1644
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
It could all come tumbling down for Facebook

1645
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Pretty soon

1646
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I'm on a social networking thing that doesn't have the stupid games on it

1647
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Well I always liked the way Google Plus did it

1648
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
It was just another tab somewhere else

1649
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I mean to be perfectly honest I'm actually thinking about

1650
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Going back to using Google Plus

1651
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Because of just how ridiculous Facebook has gotten

1652
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
But I don't play the games

1653
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
There's a lot of people that are worried about

1654
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
System security

1655
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
So they, like I have done, have blocked

1656
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Every single game request that's come through

1657
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Well this is the thing that pisses me off about Facebook

1658
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Literally pisses me off

1659
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
I don't know how many times

1660
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I have turned off

1661
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Location statuses on my post

1662
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I don't want all my posts posting

1663
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Where my location is

1664
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I use an app called Foursquare

1665
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
When I specifically want to disclose that

1666
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I hate being tagged

1667
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I don't check into my house

1668
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
And all that stuff

1669
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I don't do that

1670
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
So I don't want my post to be tagged

1671
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
With my work address or my home

1672
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Or whatever it is

1673
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Yet that shit keeps turning itself back on

1674
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I just had to do it on a Facebook post

1675
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I made an hour before the show

1676
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
And that shit is driving me bonkers

1677
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
The site's broken, remember I've talked about this a few weeks ago

1678
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
And it's still broken

1679
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
It's been broken for over a month now

1680
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Where you can unsubscribe

1681
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
From somebody's

1682
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Comments and likes

1683
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Basically you just don't want to see one

1684
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Okay I like this picture

1685
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I don't care if you like that picture

1686
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
And it keeps popping back

1687
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
No it keeps popping back up

1688
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I want to unsubscribe from it

1689
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
And it will hide that post

1690
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
But it will still be there

1691
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I have to stop

1692
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
For people that keep having that stuff pop up

1693
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
And I'm just tired of seeing their post

1694
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I actually have to unsubscribe from them

1695
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Why do we keep using Facebook?

1696
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I'm sitting here bitching

1697
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Yet I'll still use it to make some stupid posts this evening

1698
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Why? Because I need instant gratification

1699
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Not that people are on Google

1700
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
It's not even that

1701
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Why do we need that right now in our society?

1702
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Why do we need it?

1703
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
The only reason I keep up with Facebook

1704
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Is just to piss off my mother

1705
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
To keep up with my friends and family

1706
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
In Alabama

1707
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
To keep up with my friends

1708
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
In other countries

1709
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
To keep up with my friends across America

1710
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Because only three people

1711
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Anymore still use AIM

1712
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Which I still use to keep up with people

1713
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I've found old friends

1714
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
That I used to chat with

1715
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Back when I had AOL for real

1716
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Back in the day

1717
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
One of my friends just found me through DeviantArt

1718
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
And we're on Facebook now

1719
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I mean, I use it to keep up with people

1720
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
But other than that

1721
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I mean, like

1722
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
I get so irritated that

1723
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
People just use it for a

1724
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Sympathy grab, you know what I mean?

1725
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Or, hi, look where I am and you're not

1726
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I don't care where you are

1727
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I don't need to know when you go to bed

1728
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I think it's just this whole

1729
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I think it really is a modern phenomenon

1730
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
That everyone wants a little bit of

1731
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I hate to use it

1732
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
In this respect, but everyone wants their own little

1733
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Piece of celebrity, you know what I mean?

1734
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Where they want people to care about what they're doing

1735
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
It's that whole Andy Warhol thing

1736
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
The 15 minutes of fame, it's all of that coming to light

1737
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Andy Warhol predicted things better than the Mayans

1738
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Well, he was a fairly

1739
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Interesting person

1740
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Yes he was He was an OCD collector

1741
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Yeah, yeah Anyway

1742
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
My teacher got to meet him Why did he do a painting of soup cans?

1743
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
One of my teachers got to meet him

1744
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Oh yeah? Yeah, back then

1745
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Anyhow, how did we get from PopCap to this?

1746
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
You're the one who changed it to Andy Warhol

1747
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I do find this topic fascinating

1748
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Let me read some chat comments real quick

1749
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Those participating with the show at live.vognetwork.com

1750
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Locopoco says

1751
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I use it, talking about Facebook

1752
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Cause all my family and friends use it

1753
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
And that's all I can use to keep up with them

1754
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Why?

1755
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
And I'm not saying that at you

1756
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Because I bet everybody would answer the question the same way

1757
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
And I'm even asking myself this

1758
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Why not just pick up the phone and call somebody?

1759
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I'd

1760
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I'd pretty much

1761
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
I'd call my mother

1762
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
I have nothing to talk to them about

1763
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
That's why I post

1764
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Things on there

1765
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Not like, hey I did this today

1766
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
It's like, hey look at this cool movie trailer

1767
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Frisbee in our chat room

1768
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Why does Facebook have to be the only way

1769
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
To keep in touch with people?

1770
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
And lately all I do now is just for

1771
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Reblogging political shit

1772
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
It helped me with the kitten

1773
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
You know?

1774
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
You gotta love

1775
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
DJ Morpheus from Understation Live

1776
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Just made a Facebook post

1777
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I was told to reload Facebook, so that's why I did it

1778
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
No, I hate being tagged in a location

1779
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Where you were tagged. Jamie hates to be tagged

1780
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
So I'm tagging her. I don't mind being tagged

1781
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
In a picture, I hate location tags

1782
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Actually I don't like being tagged

1783
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
In a picture sometimes, like the ones

1784
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Not necessarily pictures, but like the ones that are like

1785
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Here's a calendar of all these birthdays

1786
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
I'm gonna tag everybody

1787
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
For the record, I can't hide that

1788
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Travis, just saying

1789
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I hate the picture tagging too, but

1790
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
At the same time, like earlier today

1791
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Clover Nykon, one of our listeners

1792
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Made this awesome 3D vog art rendering

1793
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
And he tagged me in that

1794
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
And I was okay with that

1795
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
At least that's relevant to my interest

1796
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I may not be in that picture, but it's a vog picture

1797
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
And I want to see it, so that's alright

1798
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I don't give a crap about that

1799
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I hate location posts

1800
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
I am going to

1801
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
resolution

1802
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
We've been talking a lot about Labor Day

1803
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
And what we want to do over the Labor Day weekend

1804
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
And I am going to resolve

1805
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
To not touch social networking

1806
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Labor Day weekend

1807
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
No Facebook, no Google Plus, no Twitter

1808
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
You know where I live these days?

1809
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Tumblr

1810
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
None of that either, none of that for me

1811
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Have fun, I'm gonna be on Tumblr

1812
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Why won't you do it?

1813
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Because I love Tumblr, I can give up Facebook

1814
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
I don't give a crap, but I love Tumblr because

1815
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I actually get news articles

1816
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
On Tumblr, I use Tumblr as my

1817
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Blog for my

1818
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Fitness thing, and actually if anyone wants to follow

1819
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
My fitness blog, it's called Dieting Can

1820
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Bite Me, all one word

1821
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
At Tumblr

1822
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
But I mean, I use that for

1823
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I use it for art blogging

1824
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
I actually use that for real

1825
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Blogging stuff, and for getting my thoughts

1826
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Out there, it's sort of my

1827
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Live general replacement for right now

1828
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Alan Alchemy in our chat room says, well the issue of Facebook

1829
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Is that it managed to get everyone's like

1830
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
55 year old aunts and shit on it

1831
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Which really is unprecedented

1832
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
And that audience does not give a shit about moving

1833
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
On to the next great thing like the rest of it

1834
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
It's kind of a good point

1835
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Is that that's one reason why Facebook took off

1836
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Is that it got everybody on it

1837
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,000
And now it's ads, ads, ads, ads

1838
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Alan Alchemy continues

1839
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
So the problem is that if you're in the same situation

1840
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Of keeping track of your family, re-Facebook

1841
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
There is no reason to ever believe they'll move on

1842
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
To something else, so even if you move on

1843
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
To the next thing, you'll have to keep your Facebook

1844
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
So it's always going to be a little bit relevant

1845
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Then let's move off

1846
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Let's go back to Live Journal

1847
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Here's some selected likes that they want me to like

1848
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Wreck-It Ralph, Cuddling,

1849
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Five Finger Death Punch, and Act of Valor

1850
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
What?

1851
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
All that liking stuff is, is marketing

1852
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Exactly, I've had to go back

1853
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
And unlike things because

1854
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
I realize it's ironic, we tell you to go like

1855
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Orange Lounge Radio and Vogue Network

1856
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
But guys, that's

1857
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
I mean, and that's the double-edged sword about Facebook

1858
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Is that it's still a great way to promote

1859
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
My shit, when I don't have the million dollars

1860
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
To spend on magazine ads and

1861
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
You know, TV ads and the other stuff

1862
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
The big boys get to do

1863
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
So yes, I do realize it's ironic

1864
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Here I am bitching about Facebook, yet

1865
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I say, go like Orange Lounge Radio on Facebook

1866
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Because it still is a good way to remind you guys

1867
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
The show is here, and to listen

1868
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
And all that stuff

1869
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Well, I'm going to stick to it

1870
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I'm going to put

1871
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Make my actions match my words

1872
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I am stepping off Facebook

1873
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
For one weekend, it's not even

1874
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
That big of a deal, one weekend

1875
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Is anybody out there going to try it too?

1876
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Is it just going to be me?

1877
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Are you really all that attached?

1878
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I guess we'll find out

1879
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Where were we? We were talking about PopCap

1880
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
I'm sure the PopCap employees don't

1881
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Really appreciate that it became a Facebook rant

1882
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
But whatever

1883
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Travis tagged you with

1884
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Your location

1885
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Yeah, but he did it for my fan page

1886
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
So keep pouring that out

1887
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
That's fine

1888
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
In Sacramento, well that's fine

1889
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I just don't like it when he gives my address

1890
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Alright, moving on

1891
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
More bad news

1892
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Sometimes I don't want people to know

1893
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
When I'm having lunch at Wiener Works

1894
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Only when I'm having dessert

1895
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
That's why I got rid of Foursquare

1896
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I really don't give a shit anymore

1897
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I don't care if people know where I am

1898
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I don't necessarily want people to know where I am

1899
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
And I don't care where you are

1900
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I actually, okay

1901
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I swear this is the last thing on social networking

1902
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
The reason why I like Foursquare

1903
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Is I actually like the search function

1904
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
To see what restaurants my friends have been to

1905
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
And if they left tips, if they enjoyed it or not

1906
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I have found it to be way more useful

1907
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Than Yelp and that

1908
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I usually just ask people

1909
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Yelp reviews are a lot of

1910
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Well, but like, okay

1911
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Literally one night, Alan and I were out shopping

1912
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
We were at Bed Bath and Beyond or something

1913
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Getting the coffee stuff

1914
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Because they sell a lot of the coffee cups there

1915
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
And we were like, alright let's go somewhere for dinner

1916
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Where should we go? I don't know

1917
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Let's go somewhere new

1918
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
And I pulled up Foursquare and I'm like

1919
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Alright, let me see what restaurants are coming up

1920
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
That my friends have been to recently

1921
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Oh, Tex Wasabi's

1922
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
That's that one guy

1923
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
From Food Network's restaurant

1924
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Yeah, thank you

1925
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
That guy with the horrible hair

1926
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
It's his restaurant and I've never been there

1927
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
And I loved it actually

1928
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I thought it was really expensive

1929
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Yeah, it's a little bit

1930
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
It's not like Ruth Chris expensive

1931
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
It's like Red Lobster prices

1932
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
That's not so bad

1933
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
It's sushi and barbecue

1934
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
And I

1935
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
You think it's the weirdest thing in the world

1936
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I shit you not, it's fucking amazing

1937
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Not to endorse

1938
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Johnny Garlic's

1939
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
But there's none around here I don't think

1940
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
No, there's one in Roseville

1941
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
What are you talking about?

1942
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Alright

1943
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Let's move on

1944
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
This is more bad news

1945
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
This just sucks

1946
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
I don't know what else to say about this

1947
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Sony Liverpool has been closed

1948
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
You know them because they brought you

1949
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Wipeout 2048

1950
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
If you're like me you remember this studio

1951
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
When they were called Psygnosis

1952
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
You remember Psygnosis?

1953
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Lemmings

1954
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
I mean that game

1955
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Was like PC gaming

1956
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Golden Child

1957
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
For years and years

1958
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
They became Sony Liverpool

1959
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Shadow of the Beast was another game they made

1960
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
And of course the Wipeout games

1961
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
What happened?

1962
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I guess Wipeout on the Vita didn't live up to expectations

1963
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I don't think that's Wipeout's fault

1964
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
That was probably one of the better games

1965
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
To get on the Vita

1966
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
This is another one I'm looking at

1967
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Going

1968
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Is it just because Wipeout

1969
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Isn't making waves

1970
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
The way that LittleBigPlanet

1971
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Is? I mean I don't know

1972
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
But I mean Psygnosis has put out some good shit

1973
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Over the years

1974
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
It's just weird

1975
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
What else can I say?

1976
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
That sucks

1977
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
A little known fact about Psygnosis

1978
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
They received top billing for creating

1979
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
The faceoff games

1980
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Featured in Nickelodeon's 1992 television show

1981
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Nick Arcade

1982
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
That's right they created the faceoff games in Nick Arcade

1983
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Get the fuck out that was them?

1984
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Yeah Posthaste, Jet Jocks

1985
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
And Battle of the Bands

1986
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
A little piece of

1987
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
The 12 year old boy in me

1988
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Who is playing Lemmings on his

1989
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
486 PC is having a cry

1990
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Right now

1991
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I don't get it

1992
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Poor Rob

1993
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Poor me, poor all of us

1994
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
We all lose with this news

1995
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
This week, the only thing we can hope

1996
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
These guys form new stuff

1997
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
You know see this would have been another game

1998
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
That would have been good from them

1999
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
That they could have remade and it would have been really sweet

2000
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Colony Wars was another game that they worked on

2001
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
When they were Sony

2002
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
I swear all this is just putting me in a bad mood

2003
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I'm sorry

2004
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Well I hope they can

2005
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Rise up and start

2006
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Something new, I mean I remember PopCap had

2007
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
That iOS studio

2008
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
No one's gonna do anything new

2009
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
There's no money in anything new

2010
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
People want the same recycled

2011
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Crap and companies don't like to

2012
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Take risks, end of story

2013
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Do you find it a bit ironic that they're

2014
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
One of the launch games for you know

2015
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
This whole Sony mobile thing or whatever

2016
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Their platform is Lemmings

2017
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
That's just salt in the wound right there

2018
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
But I mean well

2019
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
That's just because what's new hasn't been thought of yet

2020
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Facebook at one time didn't exist

2021
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
It was new

2022
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
But it was still based off of a pre-existing concept

2023
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Social networking is not new

2024
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Well video games aren't new

2025
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
But there's still lots of ideas that haven't been discovered yet

2026
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
You know we had pen pals back in the day

2027
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
This is updated pen palling pretty much

2028
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
You know

2029
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Concepts can evolve

2030
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
But I really don't think that there's

2031
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Much new to be had anymore

2032
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Everyone copies everybody

2033
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I think that's with all due respect

2034
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I think that's just a jaded perspective

2035
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
On where our industry is at

2036
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
We feel that way because that's all we're getting

2037
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
We're getting sequels, we're getting all this same old shit

2038
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
The people that are doing new things are being ignored

2039
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
And I agree

2040
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
That sucks

2041
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
We need to pay attention to the good ideas

2042
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
And I've told a couple people this

2043
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
I'm actually gonna be writing a book and I'm gonna self publish

2044
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Because

2045
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
You notice that all the books

2046
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
And I hate to use these as examples

2047
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Because they really are just awful fan fiction

2048
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
But like that 50 Shades of Shit

2049
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
There's some pretty bad writing that gets published

2050
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
And people eat it up

2051
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
But the thing is

2052
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
That that's someone who

2053
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
You know some of these other books that came out

2054
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
That have been rejected

2055
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
By major publishers

2056
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
They've self published and have since turned into

2057
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Pretty big money making schemes

2058
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
There's a girl that writes episodic

2059
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Vampire stories on Facebook

2060
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
For 99 cents a copy

2061
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
And she's a millionaire now

2062
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
A million bucks isn't that much anymore

2063
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Relatively

2064
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I wouldn't mind having that

2065
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
But a college student putting up

2066
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Her own little stories on Amazon

2067
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Selling them

2068
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I think she'd get like a

2069
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
10% profit off of it

2070
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Or some really small margin of profit

2071
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
What's the trick? How do you make people pay for it?

2072
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
If we charge 99 cents an episode

2073
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Of Orange Lounge Radio

2074
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Let's not kid ourselves

2075
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
The thing that I'm saying is

2076
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
That I think that's why the Kickstarter thing is actually

2077
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Really taking off

2078
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
It has to do back with that self publishing

2079
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Self actualizing

2080
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
They're going to the people instead of using

2081
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Some formula

2082
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
That companies think works

2083
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
They're putting

2084
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Say hey, show me you're interested with your money

2085
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I mean

2086
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Except 5% of it won't actually go to the idea

2087
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
At all

2088
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
But the Kickstarter idea is new

2089
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Relatively new

2090
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
And they made a business off of it

2091
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
So that's something there

2092
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
It's basically I think a lot of people

2093
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Taking their own ideas

2094
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Into their own hands

2095
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Not letting someone else corrupt their idea

2096
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
And seeing how far they can make it go

2097
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Based on the will of the people

2098
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Alright

2099
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I'm sorry I didn't mean to go off on that

2100
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
That's alright

2101
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
That's funny news though

2102
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
It's been an hour and we've done two downer stories

2103
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Fuck this game

2104
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Fuck this game

2105
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Final Fantasy XIV

2106
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
It's being pulled off the shelves

2107
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Aw no more Final Fantasy XIV

2108
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Squeenix said take it off your shelves

2109
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
You know why?

2110
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Because they don't want it to get in the way of a

2111
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Realm Reborn

2112
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
They're basically saying

2113
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
That those who are registering

2114
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Their copy of Final Fantasy XIV

2115
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Will have full access to a 30 day

2116
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Free trial period prior to the servers shutting

2117
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Down in preparation for the

2118
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Alpha and Beta test of a Realm Reborn

2119
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
So they're wanting to just

2120
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Not have those old copies go out there anymore

2121
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
They want people to focus

2122
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
On the new

2123
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
What happens if they don't

2124
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Use those free, like if I bought

2125
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
The game and I knew that they're gonna

2126
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Shut the servers down

2127
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
The servers aren't shutting down

2128
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Don't be confused

2129
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
They're just pulling it off shelves

2130
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
They're shutting down the servers

2131
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
What? I had not heard that

2132
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Exactly what I read off here

2133
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
From their own thing

2134
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Prior to the servers shutting down

2135
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
To prepare for the Alpha and Beta tests

2136
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Oh shit

2137
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
So like why would I want to

2138
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Wow

2139
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
If I had 30 days

2140
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Wouldn't I want to save that for when it starts

2141
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
When I originally saw this, that update wasn't there

2142
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
That's why

2143
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Basically the update

2144
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Is a confirmation that

2145
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
The original story came out from

2146
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
People posting about, hey we got this

2147
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Note in our store, we have to take it down

2148
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
I'll read the

2149
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Actual statement, okay

2150
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
In anticipation of the upcoming Alpha and Beta test

2151
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
For Final Fantasy XIV, a Realm Reborn

2152
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Square Enix, in coordination

2153
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
With our retail partners, has decided

2154
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
To discontinue sales of the current version of Final Fantasy XIV

2155
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
This move was done

2156
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
To help ensure that new customers who register

2157
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Their copy of Final Fantasy XIV

2158
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Will have full access to the 30 day

2159
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Free trial period prior to the

2160
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Servers shutting down to prepare for the Alpha

2161
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
And Beta tests of Final Fantasy XIV

2162
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
A Realm Reborn

2163
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Wow

2164
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
See, in my mind I was like

2165
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Oh, they'll do kind of like what World of Warcraft does

2166
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
You have your test servers that run one

2167
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Copy of the game

2168
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
That's archaic and dumb

2169
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Not that anybody's really gonna

2170
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
There'll be hundreds of people that weep over

2171
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Final Fantasy XIV servers being shut down

2172
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
But, I mean

2173
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
When it vanishes to that though, it is a clean break from the old

2174
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Yeah, that's

2175
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
That's unprecedented

2176
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
I think it's gonna kick it

2177
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
I think it's gonna

2178
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Kick him in the ass

2179
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Square is literally trying to erase your memory

2180
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Of that game

2181
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
So that when Realm Reborn comes out

2182
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
It's treated like a brand new game

2183
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
A brand new launch

2184
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Like the old one didn't ever happen

2185
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
That's crazy

2186
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
I think

2187
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
That it's gonna come back to kick him though

2188
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
I think it's gonna come back

2189
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
And I think it's really gonna hurt him

2190
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I'd

2191
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
It's a, you know what, I'm gonna give it this

2192
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Final Fantasy XIV

2193
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Sucked

2194
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
I tried it two or three times

2195
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
I really tried to like it

2196
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
It was not a good MMO

2197
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Harry Monkey Balls is what it sucked

2198
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
I'm just, having played WoW

2199
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Having played Guild Wars

2200
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Night's the Old Republic

2201
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Having played just about everything that's come to the

2202
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Table

2203
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Final Fantasy XIV sucked

2204
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
XI was still a better experience

2205
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
For the month I went back to XI

2206
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
I just

2207
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Yeah

2208
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
And XI made me cry with frustration

2209
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
And everything I saw made me like it better

2210
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Oh, but I don't think it's necessarily

2211
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Going to, you know

2212
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I applaud them for taking risks

2213
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
I don't know if it will necessarily

2214
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Be a failure

2215
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
But I think if you're hedging your bets on sales of the

2216
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Console version of the game, that's dangerous

2217
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Because console MMOs

2218
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Haven't been super super well done

2219
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
So

2220
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
With the exception of Final Fantasy XI

2221
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
So I hope they also

2222
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Consider the relaunch on the PC as well

2223
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
I'm

2224
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Fascinating

2225
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
You know what, it's like the more crap they do

2226
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
With this, the less I'm interested in it

2227
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
It's not worth it, there's bigger and better out there

2228
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Alright, let's move on with some more news

2229
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
So EA is hoping

2230
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
To avoid a whole

2231
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
It's kind of funny that they're actually

2232
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Acknowledging it now, but they're trying

2233
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
To put a lot

2234
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Of resources in preventing another

2235
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
FIFA hack going on

2236
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
With FIFA 13

2237
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
And basically

2238
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
They made a lot of money off the Ultimate Team DLC

2239
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
A 69%

2240
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Increase from the same period last year

2241
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
And of course people suspect

2242
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Hmm, that might be because people were hacking

2243
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Accounts to steal

2244
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
People's live information

2245
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
And buy

2246
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
FIFA stuff so they could resell those characters

2247
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
They said

2248
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
We've learned a lot from the experience

2249
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
A lot of companies are suffering from this right now

2250
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
There's a lot of sophisticated hacking

2251
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Or hacking happening in the gaming industry

2252
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
And it's a continuous battle

2253
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
And we've

2254
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
We take it very seriously

2255
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
And we put a lot of resources on it

2256
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
We're learning from the FIFA example last year

2257
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
And it's been incorporated into this year

2258
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
And there's some incremental and additional

2259
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Things, I don't want to get too detailed

2260
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Because I want to tip our hand

2261
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
But rest assured we'll take it very seriously

2262
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I'm sorry

2263
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I still don't see how that's going to happen

2264
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Considering that you're selling the same stuff

2265
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
On Madden now

2266
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
And you're still doing the FIFA thing

2267
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
So as long as you keep making

2268
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
It profitable for people to steal those

2269
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Accounts and actually be able to sell

2270
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Stuff for real money

2271
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Then people are going to keep hacking those accounts

2272
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
To try to make money off of them

2273
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
This whole thing gets a nice hearty kiss my ass

2274
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
From EA because

2275
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
I mean, granted, okay

2276
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
It's nice that you're like acknowledging something's

2277
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Going on now

2278
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Now that you're trying to sell the new copy

2279
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Of your game

2280
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
You know, like, screw you for not

2281
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Having said that this was a problem

2282
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Before

2283
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Now you're just casually

2284
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Saying, oh yes, well we've learned from the past

2285
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
And da da da da da

2286
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
But the new one's going to be bigger and better

2287
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
You are using

2288
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
People who had their money stolen

2289
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
As an excuse to plug

2290
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Your new game, that's what it feels like to me

2291
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Honestly, as somebody who was FIFA hacked

2292
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
For all this

2293
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Some people frown on the use of the term

2294
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Hacking, whatever the fuck it was

2295
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Money was stolen and

2296
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Social engineering is still

2297
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
A form of hacking, I guess

2298
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
So they're going to add

2299
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
More stuff to their marketplace so that

2300
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
There's more things for people to buy

2301
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Is that what they've learned?

2302
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Hey, we've learned that we can get a lot of money

2303
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
From people getting their accounts stolen

2304
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
So we're just going to

2305
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Add more things that they can buy

2306
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Maybe some stuff for $500 instead

2307
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
I don't know

2308
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
How about putting some restrictions down

2309
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Like Blizzard does on some of the digital

2310
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Purchases when they're suspect

2311
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
They don't go through for a few days

2312
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
So that people have an easier time getting the money back

2313
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Or doing the back charges and all this stuff

2314
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
For the suspect things

2315
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
How about a little more about the security side

2316
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Of things and all that

2317
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Well

2318
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
The reality is

2319
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Where we're at in this industry now

2320
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
I just don't think that's possible

2321
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Anymore

2322
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
I think it's stupid though that they have a $60 game

2323
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
That they're doing all these microtransactions on

2324
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
I think it's ridiculous too

2325
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
But unfortunately people are buying them

2326
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
So

2327
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
It's working

2328
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
We need to hunt these people out

2329
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
If people

2330
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
We shouldn't tell people what to spend their money on

2331
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
If people

2332
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Legitimately are doing this

2333
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
The other problem I have is that

2334
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Probably 80% of that was all from stolen money

2335
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
But

2336
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Besides that

2337
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
People can spend their money however they want

2338
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
If they want to buy $60

2339
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
For the game and then pay all this money

2340
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
For the expansions

2341
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Let them spend their money on it if that's what makes them happy

2342
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Vote with your wallet

2343
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
If you don't like it

2344
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Don't buy it

2345
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
But the problem is

2346
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
My wallet was stolen and then used to vote

2347
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
That's a problem

2348
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Oh it's not our problem

2349
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
It's not our issue

2350
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
A year later

2351
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Oh we've taken steps to try and make sure that won't happen again

2352
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
It's never our issue in the first place

2353
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Why would you need to take steps if there was not an issue with your

2354
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
If it was all Microsoft

2355
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
So I'd love to know

2356
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Moving on

2357
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Boy

2358
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Dark Soccer you're right

2359
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
The news tonight just makes us

2360
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
There's so much to get angry about this week

2361
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Let's close the show and go get Pinkberry

2362
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
I thought you were having a healthy day

2363
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
It's yogurt

2364
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Trust me

2365
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
You'd want to get that delicious new chocolate

2366
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Hazelnut which isn't the best yogurt for you

2367
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Anyway

2368
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Ubisoft made an interesting statement this week

2369
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
The CEO of Ubisoft

2370
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
And I can't even say this name

2371
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Yves

2372
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Guillemot

2373
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Guillemot

2374
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Isn't the T usually silent

2375
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Came out and said

2376
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
That PC retail games

2377
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Have a

2378
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Gigantic rate of piracy

2379
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
And this was

2380
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Talking to games industry

2381
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
At gamescom

2382
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
He said that

2383
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Only about 5-7%

2384
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Of freemium players buy content

2385
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Because

2386
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Like the retail PC product

2387
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
They have a quote

2388
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
93-95% piracy rate

2389
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
So he's basically saying retail PC games

2390
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
93-95% piracy rate

2391
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Some other comments quote

2392
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
We also take content which we've

2393
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Developed in the past graphics etc

2394
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
And we can make cheaper games and improve them over time

2395
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
What's very important is that we

2396
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Change the content and make it a better fit

2397
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
To the customer as time goes on

2398
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
But still throwing that statistic out there

2399
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
93-95%

2400
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Piracy rate

2401
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
That sounds really high

2402
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
To a lot of people

2403
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Well

2404
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
I'm not so sure

2405
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
I think there might actually be some truth to that number

2406
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
You know why I think there's truth to that number?

2407
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
I think if you're looking at

2408
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Just the US

2409
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
And Britain and Japan

2410
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
And the rest of the UK

2411
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Where Ubisoft or wherever in the world

2412
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
They have a presence where they sell games

2413
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Maybe that number seems high

2414
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
But I mean

2415
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Piracy is fucking rampant in other parts

2416
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Of the world

2417
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
I'm sure there's copies of these games

2418
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Easily available in the most populous

2419
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Country in the world

2420
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
China! I'm sure there's tons of free copies

2421
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Of these games roaming around in China

2422
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
But when you throw in the worldwide

2423
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Perspective into the mix

2424
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
I could actually believe

2425
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
The 93-95% piracy rate

2426
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
But

2427
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Some people are still

2428
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Successful off that model

2429
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
I'm not excusing it

2430
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
I'm not saying it's okay

2431
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
I'm just saying

2432
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Numbers can lie, you have to manipulate them

2433
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
It's not like piracy is anything new

2434
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Or like it's never happened before

2435
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
We've never had successful PC games

2436
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
But before I believe any of those numbers

2437
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
I'd have to see where the polls are

2438
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
I mean where

2439
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
I wouldn't trust

2440
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Anything

2441
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Numbers based on markets that wasn't made for

2442
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
You're having a very I want to see the receipts

2443
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Kind of night

2444
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
I am, well you know I'm like that anyway

2445
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
I'm like that anyway

2446
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Loki what do you think of that number

2447
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
93-95% piracy rate

2448
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Seems a little high

2449
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
I don't know

2450
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Frisbee in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

2451
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Says 85% of statistics

2452
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Are made up on the spot

2453
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Especially in this industry brother

2454
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Alright one other note

2455
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
About Ubisoft which is interesting

2456
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Because Ubisoft previously

2457
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Came out and said the game I Am Alive was never

2458
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Going to come out on the PC basically

2459
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Because there was no

2460
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Other version

2461
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Creative director Stanislaw Metra

2462
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Came out and said about I Am Alive

2463
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Quote we've heard loud and clear

2464
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
That PC gamers are bitching about

2465
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
There being no version for them

2466
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Wow

2467
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
But are these people

2468
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Just making noise because there's no version

2469
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Or because it's a game they actually want to play

2470
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Would they buy it if we made it

2471
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
It's hard because there's so much piracy

2472
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
And so few people are paying for PC games

2473
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
That we have to precisely weigh it up

2474
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Against the cost of making it

2475
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Perhaps it will only take 12 guys 3 months

2476
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
To port the game to PC

2477
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
It's a massive cost but it's still a cost

2478
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
If only 50,000 people buy the game

2479
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Then it's not worth it

2480
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Only 50,000?

2481
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Well to

2482
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
I have to say to his credit

2483
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
He does make a point

2484
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
If it takes 12 guys

2485
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
3 months to port the game

2486
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Then using fractions

2487
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
That would also be 3 guys 12 months

2488
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Or 3 annual salaries

2489
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
And let's say these guys make

2490
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
I don't know 75k a year

2491
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
So to just pay those 3 guys

2492
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Is going to cost

2493
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
225,000 dollars

2494
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
And that's not even counting the cost to print the game

2495
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
To market the game

2496
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
To sell and all that stuff

2497
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Make it all download content you don't have to pay for materials

2498
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
I don't know

2499
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
But there's some people

2500
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
That would be like

2501
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Viral marketing

2502
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
I don't download games

2503
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Because I have to have the tangible copy

2504
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Then they lose out

2505
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
You're a collector and all this shit

2506
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Why?

2507
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Hold on

2508
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
I collect old shit Rob

2509
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
I collect old things

2510
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
I don't know it just doesn't make sense

2511
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
This doesn't make sense coming from you

2512
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
It really doesn't

2513
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
My first 2 copies of Mass Effect were all download

2514
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
The only reason I paid for a fiscal copy for 3

2515
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Was because I got them to price match

2516
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
And I would have

2517
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
I would have done the download copy if it had been the same

2518
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
So

2519
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Let's make believe

2520
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I use Steam Rob

2521
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Let's make believe la la la

2522
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
That the next Xbox and the next Playstation

2523
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
And just making

2524
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Pulling shit out of my ass

2525
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
The Wii U all go digital only

2526
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Digital download only

2527
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
That's not a problem?

2528
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Not really

2529
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Honestly I'm going to say this is going into a little bit of my home stuff

2530
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
We're thinking about downsizing

2531
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
We have

2532
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Shelves that are taken up with DVDs

2533
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
And with you know

2534
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Our current game collection

2535
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
We have buckets of the old stuff

2536
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
And the old stuff that's fine

2537
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
But anything new

2538
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
I really wouldn't mind having it

2539
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
As a digital copy

2540
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
I mean as long as I've got the software

2541
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
The hardware to play it on then I wouldn't mind

2542
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
You know it

2543
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
It's less waste

2544
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Less um

2545
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
It's green Rob it's green

2546
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
It's green

2547
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
I'm a hippie

2548
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
One more news story and then the release dates

2549
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000

Some persona

2552
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000

2559
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
A face cover

2560
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Stickers and Vita skins

2561
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000

2563
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
And the first run copies

2564
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Just to let people know

2565
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Had just the skins and wallpapers and it was 40 bucks

2566
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
So

2567
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000

That won't stop many people I know

2572
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
The bonus stuff that came out

2573
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
With the solid gold edition

2574
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Are the same ones that came out in Japan

2575
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000

Well yeah it's only 10,000 being made

2582
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000

They've already sold it out

2584
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000

01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Really really into this game

2586
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000

01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
We've got Ratchet and Clank

2616
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Collection which is the HD

2617
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Mix of the first

2618
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000

01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
And

2623
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
That's it

2624
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Alright let's travel to Japan

2625
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000

2626
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000

01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
On August 30th

2628
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
That's not like a dirt fighting thing

2629
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Dirt of course is the racing series

2630
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
So Codemasters is putting that out in Japan on the 30th

2631
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
It pops the line from 2K games

2632
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Those are both on the Xbox 360 in Japan

2633
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
On the PlayStation 3

2634
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000

2635
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000

2636
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
But you also can get

2637
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Aqua Pazza Aqua Plus Dream

2638
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Match in regular and limited edition

01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000

Over there

2645
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
What game is that? What's Sengoku Basara?

2646
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
It's Samurai Warriors

2647
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
No it's not Samurai Warriors

2648
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
It's their Dynasty Warriors clone

2649
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Looks like it

2650
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
No Sengoku Basara it's over here

2651
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
It's a Capcom game

2652
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Somebody in the chat will shout it out in a minute

2653
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
I can't remember

2654
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
It's on the tip of my tongue

2655
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Devil

2656
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Not Devil Kings

2657
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Is that Devil Kings? No it's not Devil Kings

2658
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Well look it up

2659
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000

2660
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Shadows of the Damned gets a price reduction from EA

2661
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
This week as well

2662
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Moving on

2663
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000

2668
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000

01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Dynasty Warriors clone says AkumaJP

2674
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
That's basically what it is

2675
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Thank you

2676
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
That's why I love having a live chat room

2677
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000

2686
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
And that's the big release on the Playstation Vita

2687
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000

Alright just a couple more

2704
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
news stories for you guys and then the classic

2705
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
game of the week

2706
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
But first, Loki

2707
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Well we were talking about Facebook and how they

2708
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
want to shove advertisements down our throat

2709
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Well Sony has patented something to shove

2710
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
advertisements down our throat

2711
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
It's called a TV, no actually it's called

2712
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Interactive TV Ads

2713
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Which basically allow you

2714
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
And I've actually kind of seen this

2715
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
On some other websites, for example

2716
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
One of the

2717
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
interactive bits about it

2718
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Like a McDonald's ad or something like that

2719
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
You have to say McDonald's to end commercial

2720
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
And if you say McDonald's

2721
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Then the commercial ends, that type of thing

2722
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
There's a website, as I talked

2723
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
About a lot of Freddie Long

2724
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
They do videos and stuff like that

2725
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
They have a YouTube channel, but they have their own website

2726
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Called RocketJump and their video player that they have

2727
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
On there has ads, but to skip

2728
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
The ads, you have to type a word in

2729
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
So you can

2730
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Watch the ad or you can type

2731
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Ford Focus

2732
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
And it'll stop the ad

2733
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
So it's kind of like

2734
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Okay, this way the

2735
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Advertiser knows this person saw

2736
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
The ad and it's not just like clicking on skip

2737
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
They know what the product is

2738
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
And they're aware of

2739
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
What you're trying to do

2740
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
That's kind of cool

2741
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
I mean

2742
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
I just don't know what sort of

2743
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Things and games

2744
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Are going to require advertisements

2745
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Or commercials where I actually have to

2746
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Say something in order to

2747
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Have them go away, but

2748
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
At least they have a way

2749
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
For them to go away, I mean because if I could do that

2750
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
On TV, it's like

2751
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
You know, tampon commercial!

2752
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
It's like, go

2753
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Go away!

2754
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
No!

2755
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Um

2756
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Yeah, I wish I could do the same thing

2757
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
With male enhancement

2758
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Commercials

2759
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Big penis!

2760
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
They have a pill to give a guy a boner, but no cure for breast cancer

2761
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Just saying

2762
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Well

2763
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
I don't want to get into it, to be fair

2764
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
The Viagra was not

2765
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Made to do that

2766
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
It was made for heart problems

2767
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
But it just happened to have this side effect

2768
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Oh, how's your heart?

2769
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Boner!

2770
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
That happens in the pharmaceutical industry

2771
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
A lot of times

2772
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Well, the medication I was taking for

2773
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
My chronic fatigue syndrome

2774
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Is actually what they all

2775
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Prescribe for narcolepsy

2776
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Isn't it kind of ironic though that they tell you that you shouldn't use Viagra

2777
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
If you have heart problems?

2778
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
You know, it's like

2779
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Well, because it was for a certain type of heart condition

2780
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
I'm not a doctor, I'm not going to try to explain it

2781
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Anyhow

2782
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Some folks in chat says

2783
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Hitstun says adblock plus is made for

2784
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Invasive ads like this

2785
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
D Singe says thank god for ad and flash blockers

2786
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
That's true in browsers

2787
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
But when you're talking about being built in the

2788
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Consoles, and you're assuming

2789
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
This is going to be like streaming stuff

2790
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Like I'm watching ad supported things

2791
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Which, I mean, it's ad supported

2792
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
It's like if I'm watching TV

2793
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
And it's free, if you're on Hulu

2794
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
If Sony's about to do something like the Kinect

2795
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Where they're putting a microphone in your living room

2796
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
You know, because think about it

2797
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Microsoft's going to incorporate this into the Kinect right now

2798
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Can you imagine if the Kinect would

2799
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Interrupt you, for example, like you're talking about

2800
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Man, I wish I

2801
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Where do you want to eat tonight?

2802
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Hey guys, were you talking

2803
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
About eating somewhere?

2804
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Oh my god, that's terrible, can you imagine

2805
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
We're sitting here doing the show and Jamie's like

2806
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Rob, let's just end the show and go to Pinkberry

2807
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
And then suddenly up on the TV and all

2808
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Did you know Pinkberry's latest flavor is chocolate

2809
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Hazelnut

2810
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
We laugh about that now, but that is the future

2811
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
No, no, no

2812
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
No, we have to put our foot

2813
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Down, there's like

2814
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
The whole big brother is watching you

2815
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Here's the thing though

2816
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
But that's targeted advertising

2817
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
That's targeted advertising

2818
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
You want to know about Pinkberry versus like

2819
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
You want to know about natural male enhancement

2820
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Or you want to know about

2821
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
I don't need natural male enhancement

2822
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
I have natural male enhancement

2823
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
What's not natural about

2824
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
You know, naked boobies

2825
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
That's natural male enhancement

2826
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Her turns you on

2827
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Although I like boobies, but you know

2828
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
They should have a strip club

2829
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Named natural male enhancement

2830
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
That would be pretty awesome

2831
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Alright

2832
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
R.D.G. Singe in chat says

2833
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
I did that trick to block MS ad servers

2834
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
From pushing ads on my Xbox system

2835
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
But every now and then they get through

2836
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Would be nice to know what to update

2837
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
You know

2838
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
We have ads on vognetwork.com

2839
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
And you know

2840
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
It isn't free to produce this stuff

2841
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
We pay for a lot of this shit out of pocket

2842
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Because it's our hobby

2843
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
And it's what we like to do

2844
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
But I just would really appreciate it

2845
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
If you like the shows at vognetwork.com

2846
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Just put it on the whitelist

2847
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
For fuck's sake

2848
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
We really tried to design things

2849
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
To not be invasive

2850
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Because we know like you guys

2851
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
We don't want to be invasive

2852
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
You're blocking the little guys too

2853
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Click an ad every once in a while

2854
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Visit the site

2855
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Help us out

2856
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
You can click the ad and then close the page

2857
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Alright

2858
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Moving on

2859
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Technically I think encouraging people to do that

2860
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Is like a violation of the whatever

2861
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Don't be suspicious when you do it

2862
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
They know that's what's going on

2863
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Moving on

2864
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
One more thing

2865
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Maybe this is a little more exciting

2866
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
This is a ranty and depressing

2867
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
And sad segment of

2868
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Orange Lounge Radio

2869
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Well we're about to be off for a week

2870
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
With something a little better

2871
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
That is that Harmonix is apparently looking for

2872
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
A combat designer

2873
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
What?

2874
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Harmonix of course makes rock band

2875
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Dance central

2876
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Yes apparently they've put up a job listing

2877
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
And you can find it on Gamasutra

2878
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
That is looking for a quote real time single player

2879
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Combat experience for a brand new

2880
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
IP on next generation hardware

2881
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Bummer it's a brand new IP

2882
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Because I was thinking the next Dance Central might

2883
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Have like, you got served

2884
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
I was thinking everybody's kung fu fighting

2885
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Or you know

2886
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
When you're a jet you know you're a jet

2887
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
You know what it's capoeira game

2888
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Who knows

2889
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Anything's possible

2890
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
In addition to finishing development

2891
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
On rock band Blitz and Dance Central 3

2892
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Harmonix is actively developing multiple new IPs

2893
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
On next generation hardware

2894
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
And looking for the best and most experienced devs

2895
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Out there to join us

2896
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
So obviously speculate away

2897
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
What the hell could this be

2898
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
You know a lot of people making up their own ideas

2899
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
But I guess it's exciting at least they confirm

2900
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
We're working on a brand new IP

2901
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Is at least something I pull out of that

2902
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
So yay new ideas right Dark Sakura

2903
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Possibly it's Harmonix

2904
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
But it's real time

2905
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Single player combat

2906
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
It's gonna be another fucking strategy game

2907
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
But it's I don't

2908
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Harmonix down as a company that would do

2909
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Quote another fucking strategy game

2910
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
You know what I mean

2911
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Like Harmonix has a pretty good record of being innovative

2912
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
I'll believe it when I see it

2913
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
I am the queen of jade today

2914
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
I wanna see the receipts

2915
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
I just think it's ironic that a music game company

2916
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Is working on an action game

2917
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
That could be cool Tigerclaw in chat says

2918
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Maybe Harmonix is working on a battle of the bands game

2919
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
You're in a band and you actually have to battle each other

2920
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
By hitting each other with musical instruments

2921
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
That's been done on the Wii

2922
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
It's terrible and it was called battle of the bands

2923
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
And they literally had it where

2924
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Your band equipment would turn into a mini gun

2925
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Tigerclaw is gonna get taken to court

2926
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Sued for 1.2 billion dollars

2927
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
It's terrible

2928
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Battle of the bands on the Wii

2929
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
If you wanna have battles right away

2930
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Yakuza 5 will have dance battles

2931
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Cause you know

2932
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Don't we just love minigame dancing

2933
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
In every fucking game

2934
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
So Yakuza 5

2935
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Will have

2936
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Well granted Yakuza has a lot of shit going on

2937
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
So

2938
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Maybe this isn't completely out of character

2939
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
For the Yakuza series

2940
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
But whatever they are doing

2941
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Dance battles

2942
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
And Yakuza 5

2943
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
One of the subplots is about the adopted daughter

2944
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Of Kazuma Kiryu

2945
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
It's Haruka

2946
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
She's trying to become an idol

2947
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
So you'll do these dance battles

2948
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
It's a little rhythm game

2949
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
I could explain more about it

2950
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Let's hope that Harmonics isn't working on

2951
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
A step up revolution

2952
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Game cause

2953
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
She wants to be a pop idol so that her song will be featured

2954
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
In the newest anime put out by Gainax

2955
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Not really

2956
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Can't wait

2957
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
They have karaoke

2958
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
And sleeping dogs

2959
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Let's travel to a time when we didn't get so fucking mad

2960
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
About everything

2961
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Except this game, he got really mad at one of the bosses

2962
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
I got mad when

2963
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Nintendo Power arrived late

2964
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Which by the way

2965
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
More on that in part B

2966
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
But first up

2967
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
The classic game of the week

2968
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Where Dark Sakura is going to

2969
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Go into the gaming vault

2970
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Find a game that she thinks

2971
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Hey

2972
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
If you're super depressed about all these studios closing

2973
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Why not play some of the greats from the past

2974
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Yeah if you're depressed

2975
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Pretend you're a ninja

2976
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
And slice shit to death

2977
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
And blow shit up with ninja bombs

2978
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Go into denial

2979
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Yeah go into denial

2980
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
The game of the week is called Shadow of the Ninja

2981
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Or as it was known in Japan

2982
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Yami no Shigo

2983
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Okay I'm going to mispronounce this

2984
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
It's Yami no Shigotonin Kage

2985
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Which is

2986
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Dark Professional Shadow

2987
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
That's actually a cooler name

2988
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
So basically it's a futuristic

2989
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Ninja themed side scroll

2990
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Arcade action type game

2991
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
And I am trying to get the

2992
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Audio up but um

2993
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Remember when Natsume didn't do Harvest Moon?

2994
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
No actually I don't

2995
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
This was a game by Natsume

2996
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Um

2997
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
It came out in Japan in 1990

2998
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
And came out in North America in 1991

2999
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
The PAL version was published by Taito

3000
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Under the name Blue Shadow

3001
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Which is actually a pretty cool name

3002
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Oh cause he's blue

3003
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Well yeah but also there was this big thing

3004
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
In the 80's and early 90's in

3005
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
England where you couldn't

3006
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Have Ninja in the title

3007
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Like for example Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

3008
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Was Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles

3009
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Rob did you know that?

3010
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
I did know that

3011
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Well Natsume also did a Game Boy version

3012
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Of this however

3013
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
It actually got picked up by

3014
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Tecmo and they tried to make it into

3015
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
A Ninja Gaiden game called Ninja Gaiden

3016
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Shadow which is sort of half Shadow

3017
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Of the Ninja and half Ninja Gaiden

3018
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
And 100% kind of crap

3019
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Maybe about 85% crap

3020
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
So

3021
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Basically the story of the game is that

3022
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
In 2029

3023
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
The evil dictator

3024
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Emperor Garuda

3025
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Which means eagle by the way did you know that?

3026
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
What?

3027
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Well it actually

3028
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
In Hindi it means eagle

3029
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
I learned that from doing yoga

3030
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Has taken over the USA

3031
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
And made a

3032
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
A big

3033
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Stronghold in the middle of the nations

3034
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Largest city

3035
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
So these two Ninja Hayate and Kaede

3036
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Have to go

3037
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Infiltrate the Stronghold and kill him

3038
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
To death

3039
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
So it is

3040
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Up to two players simultaneous

3041
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Or you can pick one or the other

3042
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Like I said Hayate or Kaede

3043
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
And

3044
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
You can

3045
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
There's actually no difference

3046
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Between who you play really

3047
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
But they just look differently

3048
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Um

3049
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
And uh

3050
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
You uh

3051
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Basically you can run

3052
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
You can crouch, you can climb ladders

3053
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
You can actually hang from

3054
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Certain areas overhead

3055
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Including a lot of the moving platforms you can do that too

3056
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Um

3057
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
And you actually can get

3058
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
You can build up your weapon over time too

3059
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
They have special attacks

3060
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
One of them is a thunderstorm

3061
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
That will just damage all the on screen enemies

3062
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
But it takes half your life to do it

3063
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
It actually is quite possible to play this whole game

3064
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Without using any of that

3065
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Um your default weapon is katana

3066
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Um however you can also get um

3067
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Kusarigama

3068
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
It has a longer range but the um

3069
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Katana will actually get a full screen range

3070
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Once it's fully powered up and

3071
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Everyone really likes it better

3072
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
You also can get some limited use items

3073
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
You get shuriken or um

3074
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
What my husband calls the ninja bomb

3075
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Which is

3076
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Just some sort of hand grenade

3077
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Um

3078
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
And then once you use up your

3079
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
You know number of those

3080
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
You actually go back to either using the um

3081
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Katana or the Kusarigama

3082
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
For anyone who doesn't know what that is

3083
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
It's a hook on a rope

3084
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Um it has five levels

3085
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Um totaling 16 stages

3086
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
The first four are in three stages

3087
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
The final one is in two

3088
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
And uh you have your bosses

3089
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
You have your mini bosses

3090
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
And uh

3091
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
You um when you beat a boss

3092
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
It explodes but the explosion heals you

3093
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
And you can

3094
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
That way you can carry over life into the next level

3095
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
If your um

3096
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Your game uh

3097
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Your game will actually be over if you lose

3098
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
All of your energy and you only have

3099
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Five continues um

3100
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
If you have two players in the game your continues are shared

3101
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
So I hope you play with someone who doesn't suck

3102
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
But I mean the game was

3103
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Really awesome when it came out

3104
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
And I mean just

3105
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Sit and watch a play through of this

3106
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Or play it yourself if you've got it

3107
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
It's got neat effects

3108
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Great animation for a NES game

3109
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
The music, Bob Trump's the music if you don't mind

3110
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
The music is really good

3111
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
And it's totally

3112
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Worth everyone's attention

3113
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
It has an old Mega Man feel to it a little bit

3114
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
A little bit

3115
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
In fact there are actually these little enemies

3116
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
That you know slide across the floor

3117
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Slowly but when you're on the floor they move faster

3118
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
You know it totally made me think of some Mega Man 2 enemies

3119
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Let me um go to part

3120
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
One here of the little series here

3121
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Just to um

3122
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Get like the first level music

3123
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
I guess they're waiting for

3124
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Here's one two

3125
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
It's pretty cool

3126
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
It's a really neat game

3127
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
And on top of that you can find it really inexpensive

3128
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
In a used game store

3129
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
It's a game that I think everyone should have in their collection

3130
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Yeah the American box art

3131
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Is stupendously hokey looking

3132
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
It's like ooh action game

3133
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
With a couple of

3134
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Ninja who look you know uh

3135
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Amazingly white

3136
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
So but it really is a very

3137
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Very good game and I totally recommend

3138
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Everyone you know shell out the

3139
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Five to ten bucks it is at your

3140
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000

01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
I miss that show By the way that

3166
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
If you want to know my favorite TV show of all time

3167
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Of all time ever and it's on

3168
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Netflix It's on Netflix?

3169
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Oh yeah Strangers with Candy

3170
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
The most amazing

3171
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
30 episodes 30

3172
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
30 minute episodes what when it's

3173
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Cut out the commercials like 23 minutes

3174
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
So put it together most amazing

3175
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
600 minutes of your life

3176
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
That's what you should do Labor Day weekend make it a point

3177
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
To watch every episode of Strangers with Candy

3178
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Because it's the greatest sitcom

3179
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
I've ever seen in my life it's not even really a

3180
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Sitcom but it's

3181
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Look Steven Colbert's in it before he had

3182
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
That Colbert rapport and he's

3183
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
He is my absolute inspiration as an

3184
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Educator

3185
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Where's your permission slip Mr.

3186
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000

3187
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000

Fucking amazing

3189
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000

3190
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000

3191
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000

Alright let's get into some rapid

3207
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Fire news some quick

3208
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
News stories for you guys before we get to

3209
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
The Facebook and Google question of the week

3210
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Or the FUGL question of the week

3211
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
First off Loki Microsoft wants to let you know

3212
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
That the Kinect has dropped in price to

3213
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
$109.99 that's $40

3214
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Cheaper than it was

3215
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
When it first came out

3216
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
The games being better though

3217
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Maybe not so much

3218
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
But hey

3219
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
That's pretty inexpensive

3220
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
So check it out

3221
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
If you want to connect I guess

3222
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
The Humble Bundle for

3223
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Android they've added some new stuff to it

3224
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
If you pledge over the average

3225
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Price which

3226
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Right now I have no idea what the price is

3227
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Because I did not look

3228
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
But it's probably under $10

3229
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
6.71 you can't beat that

3230
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
If you pledge $6.71

3231
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Not only will you get the games

3232
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
That they were offering which were Field Runners

3233
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Bit.Trip Beat

3234
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Space Chem and Uplink

3235
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
And you would have previously unlocked

3236
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Spirits but you also will now

3237
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Unlock World of Goo, Osmose

3238
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Anomaly and Edge

3239
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
So all those games available

3240
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
For Android and for PC

3241
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
They're multi platform so you get the

3242
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Steam codes as well as the

3243
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
DRM free downloads

3244
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
For all that stuff

3245
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Actually I should

3246
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Correct myself

3247
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
To get the Steam codes you have to pay another

3248
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
You have to pay over $1 so

3249
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Obviously if you're paying over the average

3250
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
You would get the Steam codes

3251
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Check them out! Sounds awesome

3252
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
And then

3253
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Last but not least

3254
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
That wonderful Scott Pilgrim online

3255
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Multiplayer DLC that was also

3256
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Gonna unlock an additional character

3257
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
And what not

3258
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Yeah it got delayed to the fall

3259
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Womp womp

3260
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
I don't know why but

3261
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
That's unfortunate

3262
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
And I guess the Playstation Network version

3263
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Will also release during that time frame as well

3264
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Alright moving on with some other

3265
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Stories

3266
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
I wish I could

3267
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
But my internet is slowing down

3268
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
And I don't have to slow down

3269
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Something's up with our web

3270
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
We suddenly just lost our web

3271
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Mine just plain hasn't worked today

3272
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
I don't know what's going on

3273
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
But um

3274
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Awkward pause

3275
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
I wonder if we just had a stream

3276
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Hiccup because of that

3277
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Let me look

3278
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
No we're still connected

3279
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
The joys and pains

3280
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Of doing live radio that's alright I have a few things

3281
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Here for you guys

3282
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Mashihiro Sakurai you know that name because he's the

3283
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Director of Super Smash Brothers

3284
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
He mentioned at the CEDEC

3285
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
Developer conference in this past week

3286
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
That the Smash Brothers game on Wii U

3287
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
And 3DS will have new and exciting

3288
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Moves for existing characters

3289
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
He also mentioned there will be

3290
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Of course a bunch of new characters

3291
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Now will come the epically

3292
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Long tease of which characters

3293
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Will be there and which characters

3294
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Won't be there and so on and so on

3295
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
But uh sounds like they are gonna

3296
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Expand the move set a little bit I'm wondering if that

3297
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Means there's gonna be more than two buttons from here

3298
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
On out for Smash Brothers that could be interesting

3299
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Speculate away

3300
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Because lots of people already

3301
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Are still button Mash Brothers

3302
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
I bet um this

3303
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Is gonna piss some people off

3304
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
This is coming from

3305
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
A former 3D modeler that worked

3306
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
At Rare on games like Donkey Kong 64

3307
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Jet Force Gemini

3308
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
And so forth apparently

3309
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Rare did want to do a new Killer

3310
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Instinct game but Microsoft

3311
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Was more interested in broadening the Xbox

3312
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
User base quote the same

3313
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Game every Rare fan wants to see and that's

3314
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Killer Instinct 3 we all wanted to

3315
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Make Killer Instinct 3 but Microsoft

3316
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Was more interested in broadening their demographic

3317
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Than making another fighting game

3318
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
So it never got made I doubt

3319
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
It never will

3320
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Microsoft F you

3321
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Alright this last story isn't loading

3322
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
For me but I remember it pretty well

3323
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Anyway cause this is another story that made a lot of people

3324
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Say F you

3325
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
That is that they are making

3326
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Remember that whole countdown they were doing

3327
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
For The World Ends With You

3328
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
And a lot of people were like oh yay it's gonna be a

3329
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Sequel yay

3330
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Nope no sir it's an

3331
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
IOS port of the game is coming out

3332
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Next week and I believe the

3333
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Price on it is $20

3334
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Square Enix likes to

3335
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Charge more money for their games than 99 cents

3336
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
To be fair they don't shove

3337
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
The free to play model down

3338
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Your throat make you buy power ups and all that

3339
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
So at least for your 20 bucks

3340
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
You're getting a well rounded game and I gotta say

3341
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Some of their iPad

3342
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
Games and such look great like their

3343
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy 2 ports

3344
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
That they did on the original iPhone kind of before there was

3345
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
iPad looked great on the iPhone

3346
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
So you know

3347
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
I'm sure the game will look really good

3348
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
But I don't know

3349
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Again the lack of tactile controls

3350
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
I think is what frustrates a lot of people

3351
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Like we don't really want to see

3352
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Games like The World Ends With You get ported

3353
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
To IOS because touch

3354
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Controls kind of suck on a lot of these games

3355
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
At least I know that's what frustrates me

3356
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Yeah and then um

3357
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
20 bucks is still pretty expensive

3358
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
For anything that's on

3359
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
You know IOS

3360
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
I think for that reason because it's you know

3361
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
You're kind of

3362
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Gimping the game a little bit

3363
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Not everything is 99 cents I was just looking at iPad

3364
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Apps today and some of the better selling

3365
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
iPad apps are the official Apple

3366
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
You know versions of

3367
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
What is it Keynote is like their PowerPoint

3368
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Type thing is one of their top sellers

3369
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
It's $9.99

3370
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
GarageBand does very well, it's a $5 app

3371
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
So there's you know

3372
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
$5 and $9.99 versus $20

3373
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Is still a bit much

3374
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Well

3375
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
But how much did it cost on the DS?

3376
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Probably closer to

3377
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
$35

3378
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Technically it was free

3379
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Well it's been out for a while now

3380
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
I mean you can buy on the DS for

3381
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Probably less than 20 bucks

3382
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Now that I'd agree with yes

3383
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
So that's my issue

3384
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
With that is if you know it's been

3385
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Out for a while I mean they can put it at 20 bucks

3386
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
But it doesn't mean everyone's gonna buy it for that

3387
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Well look I'm gonna admit and this might like

3388
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Ruffle some feathers or whatever but

3389
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
I actually didn't play this game on DS

3390
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
I just didn't get around to it you know

3391
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
We don't have time to play every single game

3392
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
So um

3393
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
I don't know if I would necessarily go out of my way

3394
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
To check it out on IOS

3395
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
But I know there are some fans of this game

3396
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
And are really hoping it will result in a sequel

3397
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
It does make me think oh I need to go back

3398
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
And try the one on DS so

3399
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
We'll see and um

3400
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Shima panic in our chat room

3401
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Says the world ends with you DS

3402
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Was $40 at launch

3403
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Thank you

3404
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
$40 so I think mine's actually

3405
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Still in my DS makes 20 not seem so bad

3406
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Alright uh let's move on

3407
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Dark Sakura

3408
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Well um XSeed put out an announcement

3409
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
That Ragnarok Odyssey is gonna have two

3410
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Editions to choose from

3411
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
The first one is a standard that's only the game

3412
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
And then the mercenary edition that comes with the soundtrack

3413
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
A mercenary guide that's sort of

3414
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
An art book and strategy guide

3415
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
And monster cards um

3416
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
10 random ones the standard edition is

3417
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
$40 and the mercenary edition is

3418
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
$50 so depends on how much money

3419
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
You wanna spend for stuff that'll collect dust later

3420
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Don't know

3421
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
And for fans of DS

3422
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
There is a song list out for

3423
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000

Half the shit I haven't heard of

3430

I know that song

3431
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
It's a total gay bar

3432
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
song I don't know how else to phrase it

3433
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Sierra featuring Missy Elliott

3434

Based down low

3440
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Inna featuring Natasha

3441
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
I guess is how it's supposed to be

3442
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Calabria 2008

3443
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000

With my Saturday Night Fever soundtracks

3450
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Freaking dancing on my bed to Disco Inferno

3451
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Any song that has

3452
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Burn Baby Burn in the lyrics

3453
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Totally down for it

3454
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Around the World

3455
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
is gonna be awesome

3456
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Oh and last but

3457
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
never least

3458
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
There is a survival game coming up by

3459
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Can I read a comment from Stan

3460
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
in our chat room? What band would call themselves

3461
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Anthrax?

3462
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Well no one ever accused

3463
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
metal bands of having much in the way of intelligence

3464
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
They're probably

3465
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
on heroin

3466
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
True statement

3467
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Allegedly

3468
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
I like Anthrax actually

3469
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Who doesn't like Anthrax

3470
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
But you have to be in a certain mood

3471
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
for Anthrax

3472
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Anthrax is just fun, anyway

3473
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Anyway

3474
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
The developer

3475
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Clay Entertainment that did Shank

3476
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Is doing a survival game called Don't

3477
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Starve that has a closed beta

3478
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
available to those who pre-order the game

3479
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
for a whopping $7

3480
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
I hear the closed beta

3481
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
is in Africa

3482
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Africa?

3483
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Because that's a game that they play all the time

3484
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Don't Starve

3485
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Anyway

3486
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
It's gonna be $15 when it comes

3487
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
to Steam so you're pretty much getting it for

3488
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
77% off if you

3489
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
order it ahead of time

3490
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
The demo is on the official

3491
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
site so you can give it a try

3492
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
for free. It's about a

3493
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
gentleman scientist who has to go to the

3494
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
wilderness world of a demon

3495
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
and he just doesn't starve

3496
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
So it's like Tokyo Jungle with

3497
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Minecraft

3498
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
I guess

3499
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
I'm gonna buy it $7 why not

3500
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
I can afford that

3501
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Sounds cool

3502
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Is that it?

3503
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Indeed. You don't have to break things

3504
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
It's done

3505
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Alright

3506
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Let's travel to the

3507
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
FUGL question of the week

3508
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
What is the FUGL question of the week?

3509
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Facebook and Google Plus

3510
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
Slam them together and you get FUGL

3511
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Which I know is ironic considering the first

3512
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
half of our show but look

3513
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
We've never been one to turn away

3514
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
ways to participate with our listeners

3515
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
and this is just one other way to participate with listeners

3516
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
But I'm gonna start with Google Plus

3517
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Here's the question

3518
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
Actually we got more

3519
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
answers on Google Plus than we usually do

3520
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
I know look I had to scroll

3521
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
to see them all

3522
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Here it is on

3523
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
FUGL question of the week

3524
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
This is about the world ends with you

3525
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
getting announced for iOS to extremely missed reaction

3526
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
What game would you actually

3527
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
like to see ported to mobile

3528
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
phones, iOS, Android, whatever

3529
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
your choice is or would you

3530
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
be perfectly happy if we never had another

3531
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
port of a classic game again

3532
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
And of course we expect the listeners

3533
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
to give us a little bit of why

3534
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Canaxium said anything

3535
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
puzzle strategy or turn based

3536
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
The controls wouldn't suffer much which is important

3537
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
for the smartphone transition

3538
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Those kinds of games would also be a lot easier

3539
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
to set aside with little notice

3540
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Revenge of the Titans would be a blast

3541
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Redertainment

3542
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
has a very get off my

3543
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
lawn approach. What happened to the good

3544
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
old days when phones were phones

3545
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
music players were music players and gas

3546
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
cost under $2

3547
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
That being said, Portal

3548
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
I would like to see the classic game Portal

3549
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
ported to mobiles just to see

3550
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
the spectacular ways that game would crash

3551
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
my phone and drain my battery like a

3552
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
vampire. Classic? Well, yes

3553
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
it is now a classic

3554
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
No

3555
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Ok, 10 years from now

3556
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
In 10 years, yeah, it'll be a classic

3557
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Alright, maybe I shouldn't have said classic

3558
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
game in the question because I think Portal

3559
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
is a fine answer. But anyway, also

3560
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Tetris, not the version available

3561
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
now that required swiping. A version

3562
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
of Tetris with button based controls that I can

3563
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
play on the go seems like a great idea to me

3564
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Yes, I remember the Tetris DS exists

3565
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
but I want to play competitively and my

3566
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Wi-Fi at home sucks

3567
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Jim replied saying

3568
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
I would love to see a port of Deja Vu

3569
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
utilizing the touch controls of course

3570
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Remember those old ass PC

3571
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
games like Shadow, was it

3572
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Shadowrun? No, Shadowrun is the other game

3573
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Shadowkeep

3574
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
I'm the one that likes Loom, so

3575
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
No, I remember, but Deja Vu

3576
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
and then there was another one, The Uninvited or something like that

3577
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
there was a whole trilogy of them that was on

3578
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
the NES and they were originally Mac games

3579
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
if I remember right. Shadowgate

3580
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Shadowgate was freaking hard

3581
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
God

3582
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
Shadowgate had an amazing

3583
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
soundtrack though, oh my god

3584
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
I seriously, have you ever done Shadowgate as the classic game of the week

3585
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
if not, you really need to think about it. I never really was

3586
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
a fan of Shadowgate to be honest

3587
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
I'm doing it a week you're gone then

3588
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
I'll do it, I mean

3589
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
I know a lot of people like it

3590
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Can I play some epic music from Shadowgate real quick? Sure

3591
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
I just love the music of Shadowgate

3592
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
I like this music

3593
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
But then like, the death music

3594
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
was really freaky

3595
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Like, shit

3596
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
I died

3597
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Harpsichord furnace

3598
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Anyhow

3599
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Moving on

3600
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
to Rababababa

3601
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Says Donkey Kong for iCade

3602
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
It was the original April Fools joke

3603
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
and it sold me on the iCade

3604
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
If Nintendo ever released on

3605
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
iOS phones, it should start with their

3606
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
80s arcade games

3607
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Let's see

3608
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
ActDeft replied, despite me hating

3609
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
on the iOS port of The World Ends With You

3610
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
I would really like to see Viva Pinata

3611
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
on mobile. The game is great to play

3612
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
for short amounts and it will keep you really occupied

3613
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
playing it. Interesting, he takes an approach

3614
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
that's not about controls, but about the way

3615
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
we play games

3616
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
And maybe a game like Viva Pinata in short

3617
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
bursts is better suited for

3618
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
mobile phones

3619
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
How would you feel about Animal Crossing on mobile phones?

3620
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Monitoring my village

3621
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
That would be crack

3622
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
It would be, wouldn't it?

3623
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
So

3624
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Alright, let's see

3625
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Oh, I'm just looking at our chat room

3626
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Dungeon Buster agrees, Shadowgate rocked

3627
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Chigurh said, we have a copy of Shadowgate

3628
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
It was awesome

3629
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Hitstun says, it's a sad

3630
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
thing that your frugal questions have come to

3631
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
an end here

3632
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
That's a death joke

3633
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Alright, moving on

3634
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Tiara, hi Tiara

3635
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Geek-Life.com, wonderful site

3636
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Please visit it. Tiara from Geek-Life

3637
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
replies and says

3638
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
This is Facebook now, by the way

3639
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
They're already on every other

3640
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
type of console ever, so I'd love an

3641
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
iOS port of Final Fantasy 4 and Final

3642
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
Fantasy 6. I have the original

3643
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy Tactics on

3644
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
my iPhone, and I love being able to play

3645
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
them when I'm on the subway or looking for something

3646
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
quiet to do while my hubby is working on law school

3647
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
stuff. It's great having old classics

3648
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
that I love at my fingertips without

3649
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
having to carry around anything larger than my phone

3650
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
You know, Tiara, they did, you might

3651
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
already know this, but they did a really good port of Final

3652
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Fantasy 3, the DS version

3653
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
that's on the iPhone

3654
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
I've been playing that. It's a pretty decent port

3655
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
all things considered

3656
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
So they did a DS

3657
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Final Fantasy 4

3658
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
So a lot of us are actually kind of waiting

3659
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
like, when would that come over

3660
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Final Fantasy 3 style to the iPhone

3661
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
That would be kind of neat to see. I thought they already did that

3662
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Well, they did that for the DS4

3663
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
They did 4 for the DS, but they didn't port that

3664
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
to the iOS yet, you know

3665
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
Which I'm sure some people, not everybody's a fan of

3666
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
And plus, I don't know, like

3667
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
There was a lot I liked about the DS

3668
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
remake, and there was a lot I just

3669
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
I didn't, just, it was just

3670
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
weird seeing the sprite

3671
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
based game I used to love in the 3D

3672
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
environment was so weird

3673
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
But then again, I would love

3674
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
to see that opera scene from 6 redone

3675
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
You know, there's

3676
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
things I'd like

3677
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Zethurb says, Time Crisis

3678
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
Touch controls for a light gun game

3679
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
just sound right. That actually

3680
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
does sound like a really good idea

3681
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
I've already done that

3682
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Did they do Time Crisis? I believe they did

3683
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Oh, well, maybe Zethurb needs to go check the store

3684
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
How about Point Blank then?

3685
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
How about Point Blank? I was gonna say Point Blank would be awesome

3686
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
Great fucking suggestion

3687
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Nick M. replies and says

3688
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
I would love a port of the original

3689
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Worms Armageddon, not a sequel because

3690
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Team 7 has screwed up every Worms game since

3691
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
I chose this game because the gameplay

3692
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
and fun factor would not be affected by

3693
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
touch controls. I could see that

3694
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
I'm sure there's Worms clones, there's gotta be

3695
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Worms all over the marketplace already

3696
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
Um

3697
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
Allen replied and said

3698
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Troll answer. Steel battalion

3699
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Serious answer

3700
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
I think the Panzer Dragoon

3701
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
games would clean up nice and make great

3702
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
use of tilt controls. Res would be great

3703
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
too. Steer with tilt and drag

3704
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
finger for linking targets. That's

3705
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
surprisingly not a bad idea

3706
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
Good job, Allen

3707
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Matt replied, Matt J. replied on Facebook

3708
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
with a no. We're finally seeing some no's

3709
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
I personally feel we should

3710
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
not port various titles to mobile platforms

3711
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
These platforms are not designed

3712
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
with these games in mind. Virtual

3713
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
controls simply do not work

3714
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
most of the time. My favorite iOS

3715
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
titles have been built from the ground up for mobile

3716
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
platforms. Games which were designed

3717
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
with physical controls in mind, which

3718
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
specific hardware in mind just don't translate

3719
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
well to the ever changing mobile platforms

3720
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
I agree with what some have said

3721
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
The World Ends With You is worth $20

3722
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
It's worth $20 on the DS

3723
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
It's not worth $2 on iOS

3724
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
It will not be as good of an experience

3725
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
A good example is

3726
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Grand Theft Auto 3. I got it from my

3727
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
iPad. I've yet to beat the very first mission

3728
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
for the horrible car controls just drive

3729
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
me nuts. I beat the same game

3730
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
years back on the PC. Loved it

3731
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
I'm just glad I only paid a buck for

3732
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Grand Theft Auto 3 iOS

3733
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
Did they ever do Dragon's Lair?

3734
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
Yes. I'm sure they did

3735
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
I was just thinking that one would be perfect

3736
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
I'm gonna quickly go through some of these other ones

3737
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
I'll just read kind of the game

3738
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
or whatever

no

3741
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
in a nutshell because IOS will fuck it up

3742
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
like they fuck up most games

3743

Locopoco replied saying

3744
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
a mobile version of the adventure game

3745
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
The Neverhood point and click adventure games

3746
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
would be great ported and he's not

3747
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
happy about the Square Enix

3748
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
World Ends With You remake

3749
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
Stan replied a new chapter to the Space Channel

3751

Hitstun said

3753
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Missile Command and Crystal Castles

3754
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
work great on multi-touch phones

3755
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
You know they do have that in the Atari

3756
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
thing. I think he said

3757
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
I think he knows that because he says they work great

3758
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
on multi-touch phones. What about Marble Madness?

3759
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
That's a good idea too

3760
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
He does say more faithful ports

3761
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
of classic trackball games

3762
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Marble Madness. There he is

3763
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Marble Madness he says. An arcade perfect port

3764
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
Capcom Bowling would be a

3765
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
natural too. Maybe we could get

3766
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
a port for the Japanese only

3767
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
Sega Sonic the Hedgehog

3768
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
There's a game called Manic Marble

3769
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
Lastly I'm not sure what Clover Nikon means by

3770
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
this comment. LucasArts Outlaws

3771
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
first person shooter. Was that a game? LucasArts

3772
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
I don't know the game Outlaws. Is that a

3773
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
LucasArts game that I'm just not ringing a bell?

3774
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
Because I think LucasArts I think of the

3775
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
old strategy games

3776
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
like Loom

3777
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
and Indiana Jones and shit

3778
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
and Maniac Mansion and all that

3779
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
I'm looking right now

3780
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
Of course I'm sure the chatters at live.vognetwork.com

3781
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
will be happy

3782
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
to correct me in a minute

3783
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
I'm looking right now

3784
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
Let's see

3785
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Outlaws yeah shooter game for the Commodore 64

3786
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
I'll be damned

3787
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
1985 and 1997 there were different releases

3788
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
That's not the one

3789
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
The 1997 release must be the one he's talking about

3790
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Yes it was LucasArts and the Jedi Engine

3791
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
I didn't know this game at all

3792
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Now I want to look it up

3793
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
Was it Jedi Outlaws?

3794
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
No it was done in that Jedi Engine

3795
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Let me look

3796
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
The first person shooter one that was from 1997

3797
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
or whatever

3798
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
I'm looking it up right now

3799
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
except YouTube won't work

3800
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
so I'll have to look later

3801
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Alright

3802
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
anything quickly you guys would like to

3803
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
see on iOS or not

3804
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Second point blank

3805
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
Yeah

3806
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
A real Marble Madness I guess

3807
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
I'd like a Marble Madness sequel

3808
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
type of thing

3809
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Maybe a better version of Silent Hill

3810
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
and Metal Gear Solid those shooters

3811
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
On iOS though

3812
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
I can't see Silent Hill on iOS

3813
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
They had a Silent Hill

3814
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
iPhone game and it was terrible

3815
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
It was like the old Sega shooter games

3816
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Any of the Sega shooters would be pretty cool

3817
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Like um

3818
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Uh

3819
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
I'm trying to think of what I was thinking here

3820
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Gunblade

3821
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Gunblade would be fucking awesome

3822
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Also

3823
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Yeah it was any of the shooters

3824
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
Any of their

3825
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
arcade stuff

3826
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Alright I knew the chatters wouldn't let me down

3827
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
VxJsonXV says Outlaws was quite fun indeed

3828
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
I think I bought it at some point

3829
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
and sucked at it a lot for some reason

3830
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
Dungeon Buster says

3831
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Outlaws cutscenes had the same animated look

3832
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
that Full Throttles did only stylized

3833
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
for a western adventure

3834
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Um

3835
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Tykey in our chat reminds us there was Marble Madness

3836
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
too it was called Marble Man

3837
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Marble Man I don't think that ever actually came out

3838
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
though it's like a prototype thing one of those like

3839
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
legendary games right

3840
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Alright S2 under Matt says this sounds like a listless

3841
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
topic alright maybe

3842
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Maybe next time maybe next time

3843
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Alright let's get some more news out of the way Loki

3844
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Alright so um

3845
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
It's unfortunate but

3846
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Nintendo Power is coming to an end

3847
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
their last issue will be running in December

3848
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
and unfortunately

3849
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
they just have no plans

3850
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
on continuing it any further than that

3851
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
and you know before you know they were

3852
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
you know running it

3853
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
through in house stuff

3854
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
but then it was

3855
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
forwarded to future publishing in

3856
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
2007 and

3857
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
that's that

3858
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
just I guess

3859
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
not print media is just not

3860
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
as popular anymore as it used to be

3861
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
um and then of course Nintendo is

3862
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
going to be getting their news out slightly

3863
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
differently can I just say this real quick

3864
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
about Nintendo Power though because like I saw a lot

3865
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
of the people on Twitter and Facebook were saying like

3866
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
oh this makes me really sad

3867
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
I used to love this magazine as a kid

3868
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
and oh I remember when I had

3869
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
Nintendo Power and it's just kind of funny like I

3870
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
you know and while it is sad in a way

3871
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
I think you're really sad that you're getting older

3872
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
because nobody said

3873
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
oh I'm really sad it's going away because

3874
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
I'm currently subscribed

3875
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
nobody said that

3876
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
like I think a lot of people are just sad

3877
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
because it's a relic from their childhood

3878
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
it's no longer there but

3879
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
hello they went bankrupt because nobody was still

3880
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
subscribed anybody in here subscribed to

3881
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
Nintendo Power currently? Nope

3882
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
and let's be real it's changed

3883
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
hands over the years and so forth and there is no

3884
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
more Howard and Nestor

3885
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
it's just it's tough for a

3886
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
print magazine to survive right now

3887
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
it's tough I would have loved for an ebook

3888
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
that makes me so sad

3889
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
because that's like what I went to school

3890
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
for

3891
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
got to evolve into the digital format

3892
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
wouldn't it have been great on the Wii U tablet

3893
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
you could have flipped through pages or something

3894
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
it would have been awesome

3895
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
so to get the word out about the Wii U

3896
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
release date and pricing September

3897
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
13th they're going to be doing another

3898
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
press event

3899
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
they're going to be talking about it it's going to be held in

3900
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
New York City and

3901
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
at least that's assumed what they're going to be talking about

3902
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
is Wii U pricing and release

3903
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
date

3904
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
$249 for $349

3905
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
and November 18th

3906
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
we'll see

3907
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
that's just a guess

3908
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
allegedly

3909
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
the titles that were released on the 20th

3910
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
now move to the 13th

3911
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
alright we'll see

3912
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
alright moving on

3913
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
you remember Adventure on the Atari 2600

3914
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
I mean back in the days

3915
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
of the Atari 2600 where we had games like

3916
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
baseball

3917
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
basketball

3918
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
video pinball

3919
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
we had Adventure and a lot of people remember

3920
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
Adventure because it was the very first game to have an Easter egg

3921
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
or at least a prominent Easter egg

3922
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
which had the hidden designer's name

3923
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
in it because if you want to go way back

3924
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
go back to a time where designers

3925
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
would not get credit for games and sometimes it would leave

3926
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
them a little frustrated so you could find

3927
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
that in Adventure well also

3928
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Adventure was just kind of a neat little game that

3929
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
a lot of games like you see things in

3930
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Adventure that influence the Legend of Zelda

3931
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
for real like a lot of what comes

3932
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Legend of Zelda was in Adventure on the

3933
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
Atari 2600 and therefore it has

3934
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
its fans and

3935
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
more than 30 years later we're looking at

3936
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
yet another sequel to Adventure

3937
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
now I believe there was a prototype some time

3938
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
ago of Adventure 2 but that's not

3939
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
part of the canon that we have

3940
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
now what we do have is

3941
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
that in 2009 there was Evil Magician

3942
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Returns which was

3943
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
programmed by Bite Knight from the

3944
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Atari Age forums and he did this in

3945
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
2009 and this is in reference to

3946
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
the unseen antagonist who

3947
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
stole and hid the chalice in the original game

3948
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
he didn't have the rights to call it

3949
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
Adventure 2 but he could call it Evil Magician

3950
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
hooray generic bad guy

3951
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
well now Evil Magician

3952
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Returns 2

3953
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
ahhhh

3954
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
he's back bitch

3955
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
you have to overcome both

3956
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
him and his apprentice

3957
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
they are personally guarding the chalice

3958
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
keys, mages

3959
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
mazes, flickering

3960
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
grottos and bats

3961
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
and it has

3962
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
come out yes it is an adventure

3963
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
game there has to be an easter egg in there

3964
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
somewhere so be on the lookout for that

3965
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
you know I gotta say this

3966
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
for an Atari 2600

3967
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
game the graphics are pretty sweet

3968
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
I know you're looking at this

3969
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
picture of the game and laughing at me but

3970
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
hello remember what the original

3971
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
adventure looked like like this is a step up

3972
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
I love that people are still

3973
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
programming for the Atari 2600

3974
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
of course

3975
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
ROMs allow them to make the

3976
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
games however big they want

3977
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
I don't think this is actually getting printed on

3978
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
a cartridge no but

3979
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
it's just neat that there's still all that

3980
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
love for the Atari 2600

3981
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
so there you go

3982
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
Dark Sakura?

3983
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
well for those who are still

3984
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
playing Diablo 3 and I know that there are

3985
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
da da da

3986
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
there is

3987
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
going to be new upgrade levels

3988
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
for all of those who have reached your level cap

3989
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
it's called the

3990
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Paragon system which has nothing to do

3991
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
with Mass Effect

3992
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
has 100 additional levels

3993
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
for you to push through once you meet

3994
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
the current level max

3995
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
it's coming in update 1.0.4

3996
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
and basically all of your

3997
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
experience that you get after 60

3998
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
will be put into your Paragon levels

3999
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
so it gives you a boost in your core stats

4000
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
and

4001
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
an extra 3% boost

4002
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
in magic and gold find

4003
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
also

4004
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
there is this

4005
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
trying to find

4006
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
where exactly it was

4007
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
the Nephilim Valor bonuses

4008
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
will also give a 15% boost

4009
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
in experience towards the Paragon levels per stack

4010
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
so fun

4011
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
I love that they

4012
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
made the end game more exciting by basically

4013
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
adding 100 levels

4014
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:07,000
pretty much

4015
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
apparently there is some game balance things and other things

4016
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
they did too, like we talked about this on

4017
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:12,000
Horde House a little bit

4018
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
and Extifer has been playing a lot of Diablo

4019
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
lately because he's not really playing WoW right now

4020
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
but him and his partner play a lot

4021
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
of Diablo and he says

4022
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
it's great that the game balancing and everything is great

4023
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
me, I haven't touched Diablo since like the first

4024
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
month it came out but maybe

4025
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
I need to take a second look after

4026
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
WoW and Guild Wars

4027
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
and all that other stuff

4028
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
free with blood packed

4029
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
which you can't sign up for anymore

4030
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
just a couple more news stories for you guys

4031
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
in the mailbag

4032
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
mailbag at orangesloungeradio.com is where the emails

4033
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
go but first some more stories

4034
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
alright

4035
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
now this is kind of interesting

4036
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
you remember that whole

4037
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Peter Molyneaux thing that they were doing

4038
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
on the iOS platform where it was

4039
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
basically this

4040
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
curiosity is what the game is called

4041
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
and it was kind of controversial

4042
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
because you can buy

4043
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
in-game things to help you

4044
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
chip away at this cube faster including

4045
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
one piece that's $50,000

4046
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
or $5,000

4047
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
so anyways that game's been delayed

4048
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
to September and

4049
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
also because it's been delayed

4050
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
I'm not sure if this is the reason but

4051
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
they had to change their title because

4052
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
you may remember there was a certain

4053
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
program from NASA that landed

4054
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
a rover on Mars named

4055
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Curiosity and

4056
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
yeah that was kind of

4057
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
bad so now it's

4058
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
that wasn't bad

4059
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
no it was bad for Curiosity because

4060
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:37,000
they couldn't use the name

4061
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
bad for Peter Molyneaux but fuck him

4062
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
so now it's not just Curiosity

4063
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
it's Curiosity what's in the

4064
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
cube or what's inside the cube

4065
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
is what it's called

4066
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
WHAT'S IN THE BOX

4067
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
TELL ME WHAT'S IN THE BOX

4068
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
anyone?

4069
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
pretty much yeah

4070
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
you don't get seven

4071
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
so they have that going on right now

4072
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
I gotta wonder though

4073
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
when is the next Apple announcement

4074
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
for iOS 6 isn't that supposed to be

4075
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
in September sometime?

4076
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
the iPhone 5 announcement is heavily rumored

4077
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
for September 12 which is just

4078
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
a few weeks away really

4079
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
and I'm assuming that's probably when we're gonna see iOS 6

4080
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
oh absolutely yeah

4081
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
iOS 6 was the one that had that patch in it

4082
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
or they're supposed to be patching that loophole right now

4083
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
where you can get free DLC

4084
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
probably they wouldn't want to

4085
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
release that game that has

4086
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
$5,000 or $50,000 DLC

4087
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
when there's a loophole to get that for free

4088
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
wouldn't you think?

4089
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
that might kind of skew the way the game's played

4090
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
just the thought

4091
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
I thought they were able to

4092
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
fix that I thought they patched it

4093
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
somewhere on the back end

4094
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
Chiggers in our chat says

4095
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
dick in a box

4096
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
that would be fucking hilarious

4097
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
actually Peter Molyneaux

4098
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
would gain my ultimate

4099
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
respect if what's in the box

4100
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
my dick

4101
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
that would

4102
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
make headlines

4103
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
I mean you'd have

4104
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
to have a real egotistical person

4105
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
to pull a stunt like that

4106
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
you could do it

4107
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
how would you feel Dark

4108
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
Sakura if you opened the box

4109
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
because you were curious and

4110
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
it's his dick

4111
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
I'm just getting blinked at

4112
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
I feel short changed

4113
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
alright moving on

4114
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Konami is set to shake the industry

4115
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
god damn it

4116
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
what is wrong with our web tonight?

4117
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
alright I remember this story from earlier though

4118
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
Konami is

4119
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
I forget who said it in an event

4120
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
I want to say it was Kojima

4121
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
somebody involved with Kojima Productions

4122
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
because there's an announcement coming up

4123
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
from Metal Gear's 25th anniversary

4124
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
and they were quoted in saying

4125
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
Ken Mandaza

4126
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
with Kojima Productions

4127
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
that was quoted in saying

4128
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
that the industry

4129
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
is going to get shaken up

4130
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
yeah they have a lot of things to look forward to

4131
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
next week not just for fans

4132
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
but I think the industry is going to be shook

4133
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
they're going to be able to present here

4134
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
at least it's not a Frogger game

4135
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
that's all I know

4136
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
oh I finally got it here

4137
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
I was going to say my internet is working just fine

4138
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
I don't know

4139
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
it's because I streamed the show and all that off this computer too

4140
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
but anyway we will find out what the shakedown is

4141
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
August 30th

4142
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
when this event

4143
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:45,000
is placed there at Tokyo Midtown

4144
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
alright whatever

4145
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
moving on

4146
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
let's get to the mailbag

4147
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000

02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
mailbag at orangelaungerator.com

4149
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
DarkSakura dives into the mailbag head first

4152
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000

02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000

4208
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
answer too late

4209
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
power pad games

4210
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000

4211
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000

um no it'd be custer's revenge

4213
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
ok greetings orange

4214
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
knowledge radio this is a message from

4215
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
hasseo sumi ragawa

4216
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
regarding final fantasy and their rampant cases

4217
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
of disappearing acts yeah we oh this is

4218
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
what we covered ok so six years

4219
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
ago square enix announced final fantasy

4220
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
versus 13 as part of the fabula

4221
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
nova crystallis and since then

4222
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
they put out a few trailers

4223
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
talking about the stories a bit

4224
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
and six years later there's nothing because it came out in japan

4225
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
um there hasn't even

4226
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
been present at e3

4227
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
but that's not my point

4228
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
now last november square announced that they were

4229
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
going to release final fantasy 10 again and needless to

4230
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
say I squeed my voice horse

4231
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
um after that nothing so this

4232
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
brings me to my point is there going to be

4233
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
is this going to be a trend with square

4234
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
announce the games that won't come out for years and years and let's

4235
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
face it look at what happened to duke nukem

4236
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
forever oh that game was

4237
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
crap um one last note

4238
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
to lookies I'm aware you're

4239
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
smart with modding and

4240
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
computers correct okay so

4241
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
two questions firstly

4242
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
um my boyfriend's computer

4243
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
doesn't have the programs installed onto his computer

4244
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
is there a way to fix that I don't

4245
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
it says

4246
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
sorry for bad grammar but honestly the grammar

4247
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
is so bad that I can hardly make heads or

4248
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
tails of the lines

4249
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
doesn't have the programs

4250
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
installed I

4251
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
guess to mod then

4252
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
install the programs where do you

4253
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
recommend to go buy a new

4254
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
hard drive for a ps3 and what's the larger size

4255
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
you can get uh

4256
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
ps3 can fit any hard drive that you can

4257
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
fit in the bay that's in there it's two and a half

4258
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
um inch

4259
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
sata drives laptop sata

4260
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
drive so you can put

4261
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
whatever I think I put a 500

4262
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
gigabyte one in mine and

4263
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
it was a

4264
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
scorpio

4265
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
blue I think

4266
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
or something like that I don't remember what it's called

4267
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
western digital or something like that

4268
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
um just look online for

4269
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
uh hard drives that'll fit

4270
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
I think you have to watch out when you get

4271
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
really big hard drive sizes

4272
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
the actual hard drive itself gets

4273
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
thicker and it might not fit in the actual

4274
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
um bay that they have

4275
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
so you have to kind of watch what you can fit in there

4276
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
uh at least I know that's the case with

4277
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
um with the xbox

4278
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
when you're modding that

4279
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
as far as modding like I'm assuming they're asking

4280
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
about modding the ps3 stuff

4281
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
um just download the apps

4282
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
you may have to check out some of the websites

4283
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
like there's uh

4284
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
dashhax.com

4285
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
or dot net or something

4286
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
dashhax is the website they have

4287
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
information about doing hacks

4288
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
on playstation 3

4289
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
psp vita when there's

4290
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
that stuff available you know pretty much

4291
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
any consoles and ios

4292
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
and phones and that kind of stuff so

4293
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
that'd be kind of a good source for finding some of

4294
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
the tools to flash a custom

4295
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
uh

4296
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
firmware or what not

4297
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
to your playstation 3

4298
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
at least that's how I did it when I did mine

4299
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
then I flashed it back to stock because I just wasn't

4300
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
using

4301
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
you know I wasn't pirating games or anything on that

4302
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
cause you know games are fucking

4303
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
huge cause they're blu ray games so it's

4304
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
just I had nothing I really wanted

4305
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
to even I would want to even

4306
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
pirate so um I just buy games

4307
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
now but um

4308
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
so yeah so there's that

4309
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
just look online

4310
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000

that's from um hasayasumiragawa

4315
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
so um hello guys

4316
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
and girl and darksacro okay

4317
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
I just wanted to talk a little bit about

4318
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
my favorite portable game of the past generation which you

4319
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
briefly mentioned in the past

4320
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
two weeks releases I am of course

4321
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
talking about bokuakoku

4322
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
kansai kansai kan

4323
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
for psp which is

4324
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
um I am an air traffic

4325
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
controller airport hero um

4326
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
unlike games with similar names on

4327
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
aya such as flight controller pocket planes

4328
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
this is a real puzzle game based on the very

4329
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
real intricacies of air traffic control

4330
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
basically you play the role

4331
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
of the five people in the atc tower

4332
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
at the same time telling pilots what

4333
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
routes to take um

4334
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
coming into and out of the airport giving

4335
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
permission to land and take off giving

4336
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
taxing instructions and confirming flight plans

4337
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
as the stages get harder more

4338
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
and more plans arrive in your airspace more plans

4339
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
prepare to take off you have to juggle up to

4340
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
ten different pilots vying for your attention

4341
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
with only five radio channels

4342
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
take too long and the pilots get stressed push buttons

4343
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
without thinking and you'll cause a crash

4344
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
it's hectic, frantic, and utterly gripping

4345
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
um he's got a video up

4346
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
um of what it's like so

4347
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
uh I'm not gonna go too far into that

4348
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
it says the 3ds version um came out

4349
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
last week is pretty similar but with cuter graphics

4350
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
and I would urge anyone who enjoys

4351
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
time management puzzle games to look into this

4352
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
as you read this I

4353
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
will likely be in Disneyland Paris

4354
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
watching new Disney dreams nighttime spectacular

4355
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
wish you were here

4356
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
and that's uh from pikaruno

4357
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
oh well you did say wish you were here at the end

4358
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
so I can't be too mean bring me back something duffy

4359
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
and last email

4360
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
uh

4361
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
this uh

4362
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
this is hello olr after a long time

4363
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
I finally got to play binary domain

4364
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
I wish some interest

4365
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
I had some interest in it but I somehow never

4366
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
compelled to buy it thinking it would just

4367
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
be another shooter my girlfriend got it for me

4368
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
a couple days ago and I started playing

4369
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
and just could not stop this game

4370
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
is awesome I was told

4371
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
to sing it by the way

4372
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
and you did and I did

4373
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
sure it's not perfect

4374
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
controls aren't always spot on and the voice recognition

4375
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
isn't very good but the deep story

4376
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
future Tokyo environment graphics

4377
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
voice acting and sound make it

4378
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
a very good game you can literally

4379
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
shoot robots to pieces and it isn't that

4380
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
same gritty and brown

4381
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
world you see in countless other games

4382
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
this is the very first game that gave

4383
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
me goosebumps while playing the end sequence

4384
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
that's saying a lot when I get emotional

4385
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
about a game Sega should be deeply

4386
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
ashamed for not promoting this game more

4387
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
binary domain vanquished bayonetta are all

4388
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
games that deserve better when you

4389
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
get the chance buy this as it is very

4390
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
cheap that's all I have to say at this time

4391
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
as always thanks a lot for

4392
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
making an episode of OLR every week

4393
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000

music

4417
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
music

4418
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
music

4419
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000

02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
who didn't use their turn signal at

4422
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
all and then tried to stop

4423
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000

02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
I really don't know I guess

4427
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
me for changing

4428
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
my schedule to seven in

4429
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
the morning but at least I'm only

4430
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
out 30 minutes of sleep and

4431
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
I don't have to deal with

4432
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
crap traffic in the morning also

4433
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
I really want a bagel but no

4434
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000

4435
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000

4436
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000

4437
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000

02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000

4449
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000

02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000

just like selfishly inconsiderate what in the

4453
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
hell find a parking space

4454
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
entitlement and don't think there's anybody else in the world

4455
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
it's like I don't know what's wrong with these people

4456
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
that's it

4457
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
my view of the week goes to the web and on this

4458
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
computer right now I don't get what the hell's going on but like

4459
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
everything is like timing out I'm

4460
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
the same to me yeah I'm having to like run shit off

4461
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
my iPad right now I don't know it's

4462
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
weird I don't know luckily the stream

4463
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
is staying up and that's the most important thing I just hope

4464
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
Skype will stay up as well it's doing

4465
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
the same thing at my house but like

4466
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
I can't do I'm

4467
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
really upset because somebody had a funny joke

4468
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
earlier when Jim Sally sent the email about

4469
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
what sexy games do you want to see on the

4470
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
sexy island dark Tetsuya

4471
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
in chat said miss nude world 96

4472
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
which was a perfect excuse for me

4473
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
to play that everybody move your body

4474
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
clip but thanks to the web errors I can't

4475
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
get the clip up

4476
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
F you to the web

4477
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
for making me lose out on the funny

4478
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
hate

4479
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
two more

4480
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
news stories then phone calls

4481
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
first Loki I'm even turning off everything on my

4482
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
iPhone just to see if it helps

4483
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
so there's a few demakes

4484
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
we should talk about the first being

4485
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
Borderlands Borderlands actually

4486
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
was demade into a 16

4487
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
bit top down shooter game

4488
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
for your browser

4489
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
so you can check it out it's

4490
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
they call it the border lands

4491
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
and you

4492
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
can check it I love this website

4493
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
you can check it at

4494
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
www.wubwub.eu

4495
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
slash demake.php

4496
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
wub wub wub wub wub

4497
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
amazing

4498
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
so that's pretty cool and then

4499
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
since we were talking about Atari 2600

4500
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
earlier somebody has decided

4501
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
to demake the Super Mario Brothers

4502
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
for the Atari 2600

4503
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
now or at least

4504
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
it's done in the Atari 2600

4505
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
style and he's got

4506
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
I guess a demo with

4507
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
level warp pipes

4508
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
yellow blocks and flag poles

4509
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
and I guess 15 levels

4510
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
up to 4-4 is what he's

4511
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
hoping to do and have a Koopa Kid

4512
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
at the end of each world as a boss

4513
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
pretty cool

4514
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
and if you want to check that out

4515
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
indiegames.com has got

4516
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
the link for that

4517
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
I'm surprised it took that long

4518
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
for a Super Mario demake surely this isn't

4519
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
the first it's just the most recent one

4520
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
yeah we go to the Atari age forums

4521
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
there's a

4522
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
bin file for

4523
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
your

4524
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
emulators

4525
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
alright well if you ever saw the movie The King of

4526
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
Kong you did not

4527
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
see Hank Chien in that movie

4528
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
even though he is now the official

4529
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
world record holder of Donkey Kong

4530
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
he came after the movie

4531
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
thank god that wasn't one of the titles for the contest man

4532
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
the whole back and forth what?

4533
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
the Ready Player One contest

4534
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
oh yeah right

4535
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
thank god it wasn't because

4536
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
Hank Chien would have won it again because guess what

4537
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
he broke his own record

4538
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
so you got to appreciate a guy who will keep

4539
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
challenging himself

4540
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
like there's none of this you know

4541
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
Steve Weeby and all this stuff going on here

4542
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
he's challenging himself

4543
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
so he beat his previous record

4544
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
1,110,100 points

4545
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
the new record

4546
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
1,127,700 points

4547
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
that's the new

4548
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
score from Hank Chien

4549
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
if you haven't heard that name of course

4550
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
he was the Donkey Kong world record holder before

4551
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
after that whole movie mess and all that stuff

4552
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
I believe

4553
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
what is it by day he's a plastic surgeon isn't he?

4554
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
and that's how he can afford

4555
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
all these machines

4556
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
you pay him for a new

4557
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
well I noticed in this picture he's posing next

4558
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
to a Donkey Kong machine and there's a moon patrol

4559
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
machine in the background too

4560
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
now I don't know if that's because he's at an arcade

4561
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
like maybe some type of publicity event

4562
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
cause I know Fun Spot

4563
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
he's got way too much smug on his face

4564
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
eh I don't necessarily think it's smug

4565
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
some people just take interesting pictures

4566
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
those machines aren't that terribly expensive

4567
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
he could be a nice guy

4568
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
for an arcade game that's not bad

4569
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
yeah the Kong Off 2

4570
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
that's what they call a Kong Off

4571
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
sounds like something dirty

4572
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
but anyway the Kong Off 2

4573
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
is where they gather the best Donkey Kong players

4574
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
at one location for glorious live

4575
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
competition

4576
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
not that they're saying he's gonna be in it

4577
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
but there's obviously a lot of pressure

4578
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
for him to show up which would be pretty cool

4579
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
so

4580
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
SSJ100Matt in our chat room

4581
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000

4582
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
not that one

4583
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
live.vognetwork.com says

4584
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
look guys it was 9 years of one particular website

4585
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
SSJ100Matt says and Billy Mitchell

4586
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
zero fucks given about him

4587
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
or his damn hot sauce

4588
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
I hear the hot sauce isn't bad

4589
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
just saying

4590
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
alright that takes us to

4591
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
the skype part of the show

4592
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
that's the part of the show

4593
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
where we're gonna open up the skype lines

4594
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000

and take your phone calls

4596

live on the program

4597
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
we will get to the twitter as well

4598
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
twitter.com slash olr in just a moment

4599
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
but first we're gonna go to the phones and

4600
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
oh we already have a call on the line let's go to it

4601
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
hi you're on Orange Lodge Radio who's this

4602
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
hey guys it's Jason

4603
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
hey Jason what's up

4604
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
so as you so wonderfully

4605
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
alluded to earlier in the show

4606
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
I was at

4607
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
the Wii U consumer experience

4608
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
here in Denver just yesterday

4609
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
apparently I think my friend

4610
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
told me they've been in since Thursday

4611
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
and since he went to E3 he had codes

4612
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
assigned me and a friend up and we all

4613
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
got to go out there and see the

4614
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
I'm assuming they're all gonna be

4615
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
launch titles or something that's gonna happen

4616
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
within the first couple of months

4617
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
and it's just really interesting

4618
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
cause I was hearing obviously you're cross with Bobby

4619
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
and you guys were really

4620
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
putting the Wii U down

4621
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
it's kind of astounding

4622
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
to me

4623
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
I understand in the fact that it's

4624
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
gonna be a lot of the same thing

4625
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
and you have to get a whole new console

4626
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
just to be able to use the tablet even

4627
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
though everything else is gonna be the same

4628
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
controllers, the Wii Fit balance

4629
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
board and all that kind of stuff

4630
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
but I don't know

4631
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
that speaking as a gamer myself

4632
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
somebody who will pay the money to get something

4633
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
like this and not the common

4634
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
people that paid 200 bucks to play

4635
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
Wii Sports forever

4636
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
Jason I'm more worried about the games

4637
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
it's not the console myself

4638
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
or the console itself

4639
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
but I see a lot of what was happening with the 3DS

4640
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
happening here, you have a lot of mediocre

4641
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
launch titles and I

4642
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
don't think any really big standouts

4643
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
here's your chance to change

4644
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
my mind, what did you get your hands on

4645
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
that you are excited to drop money

4646
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
for a new console for?

4647
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
They didn't really speak release dates

4648
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
and actually as a matter of fact when the event was wrapping up

4649
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
they had this little quick little

4650
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
trivia session, they were giving out a bunch of

4651
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
silly little prizes and one of them

4652
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
was a trick question, when is the Wii U

4653
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
coming out, the answer was holidays

4654
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
but there's otherwise no specific

4655
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
date barring what Loki

4656
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
said earlier about the 13th

4657
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
you know that the correct answer is November 18th, I would have got him

4658
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
even the people putting on this event

4659
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
wouldn't know that though

4660
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
yeah it wasn't NDA'd

4661
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
it wasn't sales, it wasn't media

4662
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
this is just bring your friends

4663
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
and let's play some really cool games

4664
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
we'll show you some stuff, and it was really fun

4665
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
the boost that they set up, the things that I actually

4666
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
had, I didn't get my hands on everything

4667
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
but they had setups

4668
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
for Nintendo Land cycling

4669
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
through some of the mini arcade games

4670
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
Game and Wario

4671
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
Super Mario Brothers Wii U, Zombie U

4672
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
Batman Arkham City, Pikmin 3

4673
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
Just Dance 4, Wii Fit

4674
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
U, Rayman Legends

4675
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
and then two non-finally

4676
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
named Project P100

4677
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
and Sing

4678
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
and they

4679
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
looked good, that's all I really

4680
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
have to say about it

4681
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
on the surface is that these games

4682
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
looked spectacular

4683
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
Super Mario Brothers, exactly

4684
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
as it was on the Wii, I love

4685
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
that art style, I love the way it played

4686
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
the tablet integration looks fun if you happen

4687
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
to have a second person to play

4688
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
with, but then Pikmin

4689
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
looked gorgeous and the new effects

4690
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
that they're

4691
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
they're not, if they support 3D

4692
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
TV that's news to me, but the fact that they

4693
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
were actually throwing things

4694
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
at the camera and whatnot and actually

4695
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
given this serious

4696
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
spatial angle to it and not just

4697
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
you know, a bird's eye corner

4698
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
view of it, it just

4699
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
looks like it played marvelously well

4700
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
Alright, so it's the Nintendo

4701
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
stuff you love in HD

4702
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
but again, did you

4703
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
get your hands on the games? Did you play any games?

4704
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
Which ones stood out for you?

4705
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
I played Super Mario Brothers

4706
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
Wii U

4707
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
Super Mario Brothers Wii U

4708
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
I played a couple of the games from Nintendo Land

4709
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
and then I played

4710
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
as far as I understand, pretty much a whole level of

4711
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
Game and Legends

4712
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
As I'm sure a lot of people know, Nintendo Land

4713
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
is mostly a series of

4714
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
mini-games that are developed to really take

4715
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
advantage notably of the tablet

4716
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
but also give you a really good multiplayer experience

4717
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
The very first

4718
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
thing I did was play Luigi's Ghost

4719
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
Mansion playing the flashlight tag

4720
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
where the ghost is playing on the

4721
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
tablet and is invisible for the large

4722
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
part and then the four players

4723
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
with Wiimotes have to move

4724
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
around, have to move around the

4725
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
mansion, the maze trying to find the ghost

4726
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
and reviving players that go down

4727
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
anything else like that

4728
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
These games

4729
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
I could not say that these games

4730
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
were not complete and ready for retail

4731
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
release

4732
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
It was a two hour

4733
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
event, tops, and we

4734
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
were playing in increments

4735
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
of like ten minutes at best

4736
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
usually much shorter than that

4737
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
I can't

4738
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
really find the words for it other than the fact that

4739
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
it feels like it will be a more complete

4740
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
library than any other

4741
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
system launch that I've actually

4742
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
jumped into at the very start of it

4743
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
and then especially things like

4744
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
Zombiou and Batman Arkham City look

4745
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
absolutely stunning

4746
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
I've played Mad World

4747
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
and yeah, that's not supposed to be the

4748
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
realistic graphics or anything

4749
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
but Arkham City and Zombiou looked

4750
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
absolutely fantastic, this wasn't

4751
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
the thin arm red

4752
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
steel or any other nonsense like that

4753
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
Out of curiosity, have you played

4754
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
Arkham City on 360 or

4755
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
PlayStation 3? Unfortunately,

4756
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
no. See, that's

4757
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
where I have to admit, not that

4758
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
I question your opinion, but I go, well

4759
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
it looks beautiful on the other systems too, and it's

4760
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
been out for a year

4761
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
And it's not just about the graphics, but the fact that this is something

4762
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
that's going to be available at some

4763
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
point within the launch

4764
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
within the general launch window

4765
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
means that this is a

4766
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
big tier title

4767
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
that's going to be on Nintendo's system

4768
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
that a lot of people already own

4769
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
because it came out last year

4770
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
also true

4771
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
I absolutely will not deny that, and like I was saying

4772
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
at the start of the call, I think

4773
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
that a lot of people

4774
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
are going to paint a very negative

4775
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
picture of the Wii U after it comes

4776
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
out because it's not going to have

4777
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
the runaway success that the first Wii did

4778
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
because all of the

4779
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
casuals, all of the people that

4780
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
otherwise have never owned a gaming system

4781
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
won't see the reason to

4782
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
buy this, maybe

4783
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
and so it'll, it

4784
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
won't sell, it won't take

4785
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
off so ridiculously like the original Wii

4786
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
did, but that's not a bad

4787
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
thing because this is, this

4788
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
is Nintendo, in my

4789
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
absolute opinion, this is Nintendo making things

4790
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
better for gamers at large

4791
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
Project P100 is

4792
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
a very Pikmin-esque

4793
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
action game, which

4794
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
is great because there's finally a

4795
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
second game with that low army

4796
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
control mechanism

4797
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
and it's set in a very, in a much

4798
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
more technological, like in a

4799
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
scene that a lot of people would prefer, I'm sure

4800
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
I just, I have to

4801
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
admit, Jason, despite your enthusiasm

4802
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
I'm not sure I'm completely sold, and it

4803
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
comes down to the games issue, and it's

4804
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
really about what

4805
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
I just, it's not,

4806
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
and to be fair, to Nintendo's credit

4807
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
it's kind of the same mistake as the Vita

4808
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
too, is that the Vita

4809
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
did come with a few kick-ass launch

4810
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
games, and there was certainly a lot to look forward

4811
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
to, but I don't know

4812
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
what's been delivered on hasn't

4813
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
exactly matched the hype, and

4814
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
this is all about the games department

4815
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
and it's kind of what I worry about with the

4816
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
Wii U as well, because we haven't seen a lot

4817
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
past the launch window, and you know

4818
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
there's not a lot to just

4819
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
really, really get excited about

4820
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
because I played a lot of these

4821
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
Mass Effect 3, Arkham City on

4822
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
360, and I'm not really

4823
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
interested in playing them again with tablet controls

4824
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
because it doesn't sound like it's going to change that much

4825
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
so I have to look to things like

4826
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
Nintendo Land, and Pikmin 3

4827
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
and New Super Mario Brothers Wii U

4828
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
and all this to pique my

4829
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
interest, and it's just, I'm not

4830
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
I'm not as excited as

4831
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
say, the hype behind the

4832
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
original Wii, and how we felt

4833
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
about that Zelda game, was a

4834
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
phenomenal launch, I mean

4835
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
has there ever been a better

4836
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
launch game for a console since the original

4837
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
Super Mario Brothers?

4838
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
Certainly not one I've actually been there for

4839
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
Than Zelda for the Wii?

4840
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
I mean I guess I was just hoping for something of that

4841
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
magnitude, and Nintendo Land

4842
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
ain't it!

4843
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
The thing that really sets this apart

4844
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
one of the feelings that I did come away with

4845
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
is that, you know

4846
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
true to Nintendo's spirit, this stuff

4847
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
works, a lot of the things that they were showcasing

4848
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
make it really compelling

4849
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
for local multiplayer, you know

4850
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
knock Nintendo's online services

4851
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
all you want, I completely agree with it

4852
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
but having that

4853
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
second player, or in some cases

4854
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
that fifth player, to be able to take over

4855
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
controls with the tablet

4856
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
is actually immensely fun, the fact that

4857
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
me and

4858
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
one of my two friends that were there with me

4859
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
were planning on who wants to do

4860
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
which function of the game, just

4861
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
added a really different element

4862
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
for example, Rayman Legends

4863
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
the Wiimote

4864
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
or actually in this case it was the

4865
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
pro controller, whatever they're

4866
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
going to call it for the Wii U

4867
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
the standard controller user is controlling

4868
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
Rayman, throwing shots

4869
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
jumping, all that kind of thing, jumping on

4870
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
obstacles, attacking, where the tablet

4871
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
is manipulating the

4872
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
environment, it's moving platforms

4873
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
around, they had the whole rotation

4874
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
demonstration where you're walking

4875
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
Rayman's running through a maze, and the

4876
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
person holding the tablet has to orient

4877
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
the level by turning the

4878
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
entire device in order to

4879
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
allow them to jump to the next

4880
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
ring, land on solid grounds

4881
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
lands not on spikes

4882
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
and the biggest thing that

4883
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
they showed off, as I said

4884
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
was that with a second person

4885
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
these games just got

4886
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
ridiculously more interesting

4887
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
Zombie, you had this

4888
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
capture the flag

4889
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
not capture the flag

4890
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
the game mode where you have like three

4891
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
or five waypoints that you have to

4892
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
capture and defend and that kind of stuff

4893
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
and the player

4894
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
with the standard controller

4895
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
owned the TV

4896
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
and would attack

4897
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
Zombies and was pretty much the one man army

4898
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
and then the person holding the tablet

4899
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
had like a real time strategy

4900
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
kind of interface where he could take

4901
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
hordes of Zombies and send them to the

4902
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
particular waypoints and actually drill

4903
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
into this real time strategy that's

4904
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
not really been seen at the

4905
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
same time like that

4906
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
with a lot of the stuff though

4907
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
all these games are reliant on

4908
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
you having about four or five

4909
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
people in your living room

4910
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
it's all local multiplayer

4911
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
where's my online multiplayer for

4912
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
to Nintendo's credit

4913
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
that could be an ace in the hole on September

4914
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
13th, we still don't know what

4915
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
Nintendo Network really is

4916
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
despite the fact it's being branded on Nintendo

4917
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
cartridges, that could be

4918
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
coming and I'd be okay with that if there's

4919
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
a huge unveil on September 13th

4920
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
so I would wait on the online

4921
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
piece to be too critical about that until

4922
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
we have that event, but if we still don't

4923
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
hear about it at that event, that it ain't coming

4924
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
with the release of the Wii U and now we should be concerned

4925
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
but let me ask this

4926
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
this call's going a little long and that's okay Jason

4927
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
because we love you, but I want to ask

4928
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
I want to ask you one more question shaped off

4929
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
a chat comment we got here at live.vognetwork.com

4930
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
and ShadowNextGen

4931
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
in chat who's agreed with you

4932
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
in many ways and I saw it throughout Bobby's show

4933
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
tonight, he kind of didn't

4934
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
he thought

4935
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
what I was saying was kind of wrong and he's

4936
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
more supportive of the Wii U, he sounds a lot like

4937
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
you and what you're saying and

4938
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
he says, what this says to

4939
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
me is more people need to get

4940
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
actual hands on time with

4941
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
the Wii U, so let me

4942
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
ask you this Jason, you've had hands

4943
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
on time with the Wii U, I haven't

4944
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,000
Loki hasn't, Dark Sakura hasn't

4945
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
what do you think, and you

4946
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
you are clearly in love with this

4947
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
thing more so than us skeptics here

4948
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
what do you

4949
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
think you gain that we're missing

4950
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
having had hands on time with the system

4951
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
see and that's

4952
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
that's a really funny question I'll try to

4953
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
summarize in the fact that I

4954
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
me and Ryan don't play a lot of the same

4955
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
games and I'm hoping she's going to be

4956
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
interested in the aspects that are opened up

4957
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
with this simultaneous multiplayer of standard

4958
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
controllers and the tablets, but that

4959
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
that is absolutely like Nintendo's

4960
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
biggest deal that they're trying to

4961
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
push here is that this is going to be great

4962
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
for families of at least

4963
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
two gamers because

4964
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
in their whole demos you know they

4965
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
can play a standard game reserved

4966
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
solely to the tablet and give the TV

4967
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
back to someone else, that is

4968
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
killer, and this is a fully fledged

4969
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
game that's not confined to

4970
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
a phone that has a limited amount of

4971
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
controls and you can do

4972
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
all sorts of media while giving the TV

4973
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
back to somebody else, but for

4974
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
these Wii U optimized games where you

4975
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
have your hands on the tablet, this is

4976
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
engaging somebody else at

4977
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
the same time, usually in a completely

4978
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
distinct way, you know what that also means?

4979
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
That means both people

4980
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
get to play the game in two in times

4981
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
completely different methods.

4982
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
I mean for all the replayability

4983
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
complaints and what

4984
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
we complain about in modern gaming, this

4985
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
is two different ways to play the same

4986
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
game. That's

4987
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,000
ridiculously cool

4988
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
to me. I was sold on the system before

4989
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
I went to this event, I touched, I

4990
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
had my hands on it,

4991
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
I am 100% sold on the system

4992
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
now. I will absolutely say

4993
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
that. I am like so with you up to a point

4994
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
Jason because I do really want, no I really

4995
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
do want to love this system and I want to,

4996
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
I'll probably get one anyway, who are we kidding?

4997
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
I mean I've said that since day one.

4998
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
I'm skeptical as all hell

4999
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
but I'll still fucking buy one because I'm a

5000
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
consumer of horror.

5001
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
God damn it, I lost

5002
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
my train of thought.

5003
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
Where you don't, this is where you don't agree.

5004
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
No here it is, here it is.

5005
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
Where are the games

5006
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
that substantiate what you're saying?

5007
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
I know you

5008
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
brought this up before, which of these, do you

5009
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
remember my list of games at the very start of the call?

5010
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
Yes. Do you

5011
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
know what the launch dates,

5012
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
what the launch, oh Jesus.

5013
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
What games will be launched

5014
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
in the holiday window?

5015
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
Pretty much everything that you named is in the

5016
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
holiday window. And that's not enough to

5017
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
start a system?

5018
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
Yes.

5019
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
When half

5020
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
your list is stuff that's already

5021
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
been out with a new method that

5022
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
again, now we go back to the phone

5023
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
conversation about

5024
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
games that weren't developed for that system.

5025
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
Don't know, I mean, yeah, okay

5026
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
so we'll have this tablet interaction, but these games

5027
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
weren't designed with the tablet thing in mind.

5028
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
They're kind of trying to shoehorn that

5029
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
stuff in there, which is fine, whatever, show off

5030
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
the system, but I'm not that, I am not

5031
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
excited about Arkham City with the pad.

5032
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
I'm not, I am not excited

5033
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
about Mass Effect 3 with the touchpad.

5034
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
Sorry, I'm not.

5035
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
So, you know, that's half the games right

5036
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
off the table. Now my interest is

5037
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
peaked, my eyebrow is raised a little bit at things

5038
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
like Zombie U, Peekman

5039
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
3, I kind of consider

5040
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
New Star Mario Brothers Wii at this point.

5041
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
It's half rehash, half

5042
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
a successful formula just being

5043
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
done again. But

5044
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
a couple games, no, it's really not

5045
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
enough. Look at the 3DS.

5046
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
Look at the 3DS, I think

5047
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
they're making the exact same mistake, I really do.

5048
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
Look at the Vita launch, I mean, they had a ton of games

5049
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,000
that a lot of them were original

5050
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
and that still didn't help the system.

5051
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
Yeah, and SSJ100, Matt, thank you, you fill in the

5052
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
gap here really well. I want to know what's coming

5053
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
out after these launch window games.

5054
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
What is Nintendo going to do to warrant this investment

5055
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
because that's what console games are, investments.

5056
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
I think that is what Nintendo

5057
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
really has to show us September 13th

5058
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
if they want to woo some of the skeptics over

5059
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
because I'll tell you, they come out and they show

5060
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
off that 3D Zelda game or they

5061
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
whip out F-Zero or

5062
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
a Metroid Prime type of thing that's in that

5063
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
HD experience, I'm totally

5064
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
on board.

5065
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
Final thought? Yes. You are going

5066
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
to love Sing.

5067
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
Provided the song list pans

5068
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
out and it's not more

5069
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
freaking LMFAO

5070
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
We'll see.

5071
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
Provided the song list comes up with some really good gems

5072
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
you are going to adore

5073
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
Sing. I can pretty much promise you that.

5074
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
Will it be all ABBA

5075
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
songs? Because otherwise Sing Star ABBA

5076
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
still has my heart.

5077
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
The only songs they had

5078
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
were Shoop Shoop

5079
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
Party Rock Anthem and Call

5080
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
Me Maybe and they haven't really let on

5081
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
what else is going to be there. Oh god, that's like

5082
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000
my personal hell.

5083
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
Those sure, like I said, provided

5084
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
the song list is actually worth it and I

5085
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
have to hope that we'll sing is going to be

5086
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
spectacular for parties. Jason,

5087
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
I got to let you go. Some of the chatters think you're a

5088
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
Nintendo sales person in disguise.

5089
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
I got to let you go. Alright. Thanks guys.

5090
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:29,000
Have a good week. You too, buddy. Take care.

5091
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:31,000
Alright. VX Jason

5092
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
XV. We let his call go on a little long, but that's

5093
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
alright. I mean, he was there. He got

5094
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
hands on. We're skeptics. Whatevs.

5095
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
Let's do like one more

5096
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000
call. 1877 Game OLR or

5097
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

5098
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,000
While we wait for those calls to come in, let me

5099
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,000
quickly see if I can do a Twitter topic here.

5100
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
Tiger Claw

5101
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
links us on Twitter.

5102
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:53,000
This is one

5103
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
that I read in the news that

5104
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:57,000
forgot to mention on the show tonight,

5105
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:59,000
but it's important. Uncharted

5106
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,000
film has burned through yet another

5107
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
director.

5108
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
I'll have to read more on this after another

5109
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
call because the phone's lighting up. Hi, you're on

5110
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? Holy crap

5111
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000
it's Ranma and I get the ass into the Skype

5112
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
chats. That's sweet. What's up,

5113
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
Ranma? Not too much.

5114
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,000
You guys are talking about

5115
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
Kickstarter and stuff like that, so I've come

5116
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
across something that's quite interesting.

5117
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
Well, when I was at

5118
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
Otacon last month, I was in the game room

5119
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
and they had this game called

5120
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
Epic Beatdown

5121
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
Otaku Style.

5122
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
What? Yes.

5123
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Okay,

5124
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
is it something you actually brave to try

5125
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
or... Yes, it's

5126
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:41,000
an anime equivalent of

5127
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,000
Double Dragon meets Scott Pilgrim vs.

5128
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
the World, the game.

5129
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
Wow. And you can

5130
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
check out their plans on

5131
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
StudioNasu.com, which I am posting

5132
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
in the chat room right now.

5133
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
It pretty much,

5134
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:57,000
from what I understand,

5135
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
you're at Otacon and you're just

5136
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,000
pretty much beating up on the fanboys,

5137
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
more or less.

5138
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,000
And as

5139
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
somebody who goes to anime conventions

5140
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
quite frequently and all this stuff, how do you

5141
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
feel? Hey,

5142
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
I'm all for it. You talk to somebody

5143
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
at any given time who has a weapon on and

5144
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
you're trying to help somebody. You gotta be able to laugh

5145
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:19,000
at yourself first. I'll put a weapon

5146
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:21,000
as a can of deodorant.

5147
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,000
Well, one con

5148
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
actually put

5149
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
soap in their bags

5150
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
and people got pissed at that so they decided

5151
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
not to do it again, but that's besides the point.

5152
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
Alright.

5153
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
Did you just call to whore this con

5154
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
going game or what else is going on in your life,

5155
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
Rama? Yeah, that's more or less

5156
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
it. Well, you know, that and we've already discussed

5157
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
New Super Mario Brothers 2, so my two

5158
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
cents on that doesn't really count. Well, what

5159
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
is your, no, of course, every

5160
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:49,000
gamer has a voice. Every gamer

5161
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:51,000
has a voice. Use that voice. You are

5162
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
Black Luigi after all. I want to know what

5163
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
Black Luigi thinks

5164
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,000
about Mario 2. It's important, dammit.

5165
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:59,000
I'm a Luigi, number

5166
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,000
one gaming star.

5167
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
So what do you think about Mario

5168
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:05,000
2 on, excuse

5169
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
me, New Super Mario Brothers 2

5170
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:09,000
on the 3DS? It

5171
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:11,000
lacks. Ooh,

5172
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
sick burn. Why is that?

5173
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:15,000
I don't know. It's, you know how you play

5174
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
a game and you just look at it like it's just

5175
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
lacking and you can't put your

5176
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
finger on what it is, but it's just lacking

5177
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,000
something. I mean, I like

5178
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
the fact they brought back the raccoon tail,

5179
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
so I'm thinking, oh yeah, Super Mario

5180
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,000
Brothers 3. Rama, is it

5181
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
originality?

5182
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
Mmm.

5183
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:35,000
You say it lacks? Yeah, I don't know.

5184
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,000
I mean. It only has 85%

5185
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
of the feels. Yes.

5186
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
I don't know

5187
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
if you listened to last week's show, Rama, early on

5188
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
or whatever when I was talking about the game. Well, yeah, I caught the podcast

5189
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,000
because I was out last week. But I'm just

5190
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
okay, here was my whole thoughts on the game is that

5191
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:51,000
like, it's pretty much a formulaic

5192
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:53,000
Mario game, but is that

5193
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,000
really such a bad thing? No,

5194
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
not at all, but this

5195
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
is what I think would have made the game better.

5196
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
Now, you remember in Super Mario

5197
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:03,000
3, you could travel all

5198
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:05,000
over the map area

5199
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:07,000
to go to different levels. I understand you could

5200
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:09,000
do that in the new SMB2,

5201
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,000
but it's only like part of the

5202
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:13,000
screen that it takes up. It would be nicer if

5203
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:15,000
it was the full screen that allows you to travel

5204
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
from the different levels.

5205
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:19,000
I understand that they brought back some of the

5206
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:21,000
music from SMB3. They

5207
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:23,000
could have brought back some of the classic matching

5208
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:25,000
card games or matching

5209
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:27,000
up the mushroom, the fire flower for 1-Ups

5210
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
and stuff like that. I like the little

5211
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:31,000
giant glove that punched the 1-Ups.

5212
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:33,000
That was kind of cute, actually.

5213
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:35,000
Yeah, bring back Kribo

5214
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,000
2. Maybe

5215
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
I was thinking it would be more

5216
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,000
like Super Mario Bros 3, but better.

5217
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
Well, I don't know.

5218
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:47,000
I didn't dislike it by any means,

5219
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
and when I write my VOG review, it'll

5220
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
probably be on the positive end of things, but

5221
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,000
it's just, you know, I don't know. There's just something

5222
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:55,000
I'm not as like, oh my god!

5223
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
Ermahgerd about it as

5224
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
previous Mario games. Hey, Ranma.

5225
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:01,000
Do you have a

5226
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
R4 or anything

5227
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,000
like that for your DS?

5228
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
Yes, and when you first mentioned a long

5229
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
time ago the new Super Mario Bros 3

5230
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
ROM hack, I went and downloaded it

5231
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,000
like 10 minutes after the

5232
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000
podcast. That game is hard as fuck.

5233
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
That's what I'm saying, though, but I mean,

5234
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
it's pretty awesome. They did all

5235
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
these original levels plus the levels from

5236
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000
Super Mario Bros 3, and

5237
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
that took some effort versus

5238
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
rehashing the same old

5239
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,000
shit again. Yeah.

5240
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:31,000
I mean, as

5241
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
I'm controlling the game, I'm not too fond of how they

5242
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:35,000
changed how you control Mario, but

5243
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
eh.

5244
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
Alright. Ranma, I gotta wrap up, let you go.

5245
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000
Any final thoughts?

5246
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
Erm...

5247
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
Actually, no. Alright, take

5248
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
care, buddy. Alright, later. Bye.

5249
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
I guess we can do one more call. I've seen

5250
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,000
this one calling in. We'll do one

5251
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
more call. Here we go. Hi, you're on

5252
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,000
Orange is Orange Radio. Who's this? This is

5253
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,000
Cody. Cody!

5254
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:59,000
What's up, Cody? What's up?

5255
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:01,000
I'm actually a first time

5256
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
caller. Long time listener.

5257
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,000
Long time listener, first time.

5258
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
I was gonna say, I don't recognize this Skype

5259
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:09,000
picture. I'm a very visual person. But I like bow ties.

5260
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:11,000
Bow ties are cool. It's a very, very nice

5261
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:13,000
bow tie. That looks like, did you tie that bow tie

5262
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:15,000
yourself on your picture? That is actually,

5263
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:17,000
that is a Doctor Who brand

5264
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:19,000
bow tie. Oh ho ho. See?

5265
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
Very nice. Do you also wear a fez?

5266
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:23,000
You will fit in well here at the Voice of Geeks

5267
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:25,000
Network. I do own one.

5268
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:27,000
Alright. What's up, Cody?

5269
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:29,000
I wanted to call, actually,

5270
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:31,000
first off, the whole Wii U thing.

5271
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:33,000
I'm kind of the same. I'm

5272
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:35,000
on the fence about it as well.

5273
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:37,000
About the only thing I use

5274
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:39,000
my Wii for right now

5275
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:41,000
is Netflix and Skyward Sword.

5276
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:43,000
So, I mean,

5277
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:45,000
and I really, I've

5278
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:47,000
seen a lot of stuff going on

5279
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:49,000
with it. Different networks talking

5280
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:51,000
about it and, you know, everybody's just, has

5281
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:53,000
kind of the same, same

5282
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:55,000
take on it, you know? They just,

5283
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:57,000
they need to play it. They need

5284
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:59,000
to play it and not a lot of people get to play

5285
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:01,000
it and I think that's what somebody said in the chat

5286
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:03,000
is that not a lot of people get

5287
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:05,000
to play it and they haven't had hands on so

5288
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:07,000
they don't know how it's going to work. Well, it's, yeah,

5289
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:09,000
it's Shadow Next Gen and VXJ

5290
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:11,000
both are in chat now kind of talking it up

5291
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:13,000
because they both are like, you guys need to play it,

5292
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:15,000
you guys need to do the hands on experience, but

5293
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:17,000
and I'm sure as

5294
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:19,000
the, you know, announcements are made

5295
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:21,000
as we get closer to launch day, we're going to start

5296
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:23,000
seeing those displays at Best Buys,

5297
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:25,000
Game Stops, yada yada, so everybody can

5298
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:27,000
get their hands on time, but

5299
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:29,000
I don't know, I still

5300
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:31,000
am highly skeptical.

5301
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:33,000
But that's not a bad thing.

5302
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:35,000
It's not a bad thing. I don't

5303
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:37,000
hate the Wii U. It's not a bad thing to

5304
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:39,000
question, especially after the

5305
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:41,000
3DS launch. I don't think it's a bad thing to

5306
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:43,000
be concerned. I don't want the Wii U to be.

5307
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:45,000
Not at all. Not at all. And I,

5308
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:47,000
you know, and I'm so, I

5309
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:49,000
was excited about it, you know, especially like you said,

5310
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:51,000
Zombie U, when I saw that I was like, whoa, man

5311
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:53,000
that looks like an amazing game. And you know,

5312
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:55,000
I just, I'm scared that it's

5313
02:59:55,000 --> 02:59:57,000
going to be kind of like the Vita, and I believe

5314
02:59:57,000 --> 02:59:59,000
Loki said something about, you know,

5315
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:01,000
it's

5316
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:03,000
the Vita, you know, had this huge

5317
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:05,000
launch of original games and

5318
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:07,000
everything, and it still didn't help it.

5319
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:09,000
And I think, I

5320
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:11,000
kind of think that that's the way that the Wii U is going to

5321
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:13,000
turn out, but you know what, we haven't seen it yet,

5322
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:15,000
and that's the thing, is you know, we just have to wait.

5323
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:17,000
And once we

5324
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:19,000
see it, then we'll know.

5325
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:21,000
So I, you know, I'm just

5326
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:23,000
waiting.

5327
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:25,000
Alright, did you say you have something else you want to talk about tonight?

5328
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:27,000
Because you said that you got derailed by the Wii U talk,

5329
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:29,000
but was there something else on your mind?

5330
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:31,000
I just wanted to throw that in there. Also, no, I wanted to

5331
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:33,000
say, I actually, I'm an

5332
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:35,000
Oklahoman, I think you have a couple Oklahoman

5333
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:37,000
callers, or listeners

5334
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:39,000
actually, and

5335
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:41,000
I was going to say that, I don't know if you guys

5336
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:43,000
heard about the Gearbox Community

5337
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:45,000
Day?

5338
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:47,000
Yeah, I have heard about that. I did hear about that, yeah.

5339
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:49,000
I'm actually, I'm trying to

5340
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:51,000
go, I want to go, and I

5341
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:53,000
want to bring, I actually want to

5342
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:55,000
videotape as much as I can, if they'll

5343
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:57,000
allow it. But,

5344
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:59,000
I'm a big Borderlands

5345
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:01,000
whore, I mean, like, I play that game

5346
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:03,000
like, constantly, and I think it's

5347
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:05,000
because I love RPGs, and I love

5348
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:07,000
FPSs, but I suck at FPSs

5349
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:09,000
and I'm good at RPGs, so it kind of

5350
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:11,000
mixes the two together, and so I think

5351
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:13,000
that's why I like it so much. But, I didn't

5352
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:15,000
know if you guys heard about that, and

5353
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:17,000
I mean, it just looks like a really fun

5354
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:19,000
thing to go to. I've never been to any

5355
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:21,000
kind of conventions or anything like that, so

5356
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:23,000
I'm pretty excited about that.

5357
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:25,000
Where are they having this? In

5358
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:27,000
Texas.

5359
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:29,000
Dallas, yeah.

5360
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:31,000
So, they're doing,

5361
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:33,000
it's not just Borderlands 2, it's

5362
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:35,000
also Aliens vs.

5363
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:37,000
Predator, was it Aliens vs. Predator?

5364
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:39,000
I'm sorry, Aliens colonial

5365
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:41,000
marines. Yeah, colonial marines.

5366
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:43,000
And then one more

5367
03:01:43,000 --> 03:01:45,000
thing, I do know that Allen

5368
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:47,000
plays a lot, he's a big

5369
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:49,000
fan of Half-Life,

5370
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:51,000
and

5371
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:53,000
I don't know if he's played this

5372
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:55,000
mod before, and I really don't know how long this

5373
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:57,000
mod's been out, but it's a Garry's mod,

5374
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:59,000
and it's called, oh,

5375
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:01,000
Trouble in Terrorist Town?

5376
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:03,000
That doesn't

5377
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:05,000
sound familiar to me, but he's listening,

5378
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:07,000
he's unfortunately not here in the house, he's

5379
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:09,000
at work tonight, so I can't ask him in

5380
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:11,000
person, but he's listening, so he might

5381
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:13,000
pop up in chat or whatever, but it

5382
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:15,000
doesn't sound familiar to me. If he

5383
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:17,000
hasn't played it, he needs to, because it is

5384
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:19,000
the, oh my gosh,

5385
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:21,000
it's so fun. It's the

5386
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:23,000
most fun of Garry's mod

5387
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:25,000
that I've ever had, just with

5388
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:27,000
the funny things that happen in the mod, with all

5389
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:29,000
the randoms that get thrown in, you know,

5390
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:31,000
if you don't have a group of people

5391
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:33,000
that go on.

5392
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:35,000
It's just so fun. I'm gonna grill you like

5393
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:37,000
I did the Wii U lovers. Why?

5394
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:39,000
Why is it so damn amazing?

5395
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:41,000
I, you know, I don't,

5396
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:43,000
I'm not really into a whole lot of multiplayer,

5397
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:45,000
and I think it, when it

5398
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:47,000
happens, when it comes to like FPS's

5399
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:49,000
and stuff like that, I don't really like that a lot.

5400
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:51,000
I don't know, it might be because I

5401
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:53,000
just am really bad at them, but this game

5402
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:55,000
kind of, I don't know, it's just, it's really

5403
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:57,000
fun, and it has a lot to do with, you have

5404
03:02:57,000 --> 03:02:59,000
to figure out who's the traitor

5405
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:01,000
in your group, and you have to, like, there's

5406
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:03,000
a detective, a traitor, and then I think

5407
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:05,000
there's, there's one more, I

5408
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:07,000
can't even think of. Is that like

5409
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:09,000
the wolf game, or the mafia game,

5410
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:11,000
you know, those games that are popular on

5411
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:13,000
web forums and conventions and all that?

5412
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:15,000
That's kind of what it sounds like to me.

5413
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:17,000
Yeah, I mean, it's sort of like

5414
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:19,000
that. Sort of. Yeah,

5415
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:21,000
but, I mean, it's really fun. See if he wants

5416
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:23,000
to check it out. I mean, it's, I think it's a, I'm

5417
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:25,000
pretty sure it's a free mod, obviously, but

5418
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:27,000
but, yeah, check it out.

5419
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:29,000
I mean, I've, go on YouTube,

5420
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:31,000
look up all these different, you

5421
03:03:31,000 --> 03:03:33,000
know, gameplays of it, and it's just so, so

5422
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:35,000
hilarious, so. Alright, I'll make

5423
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:37,000
him check it out. Sounds great.

5424
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:39,000
Alright, well, Codeman, thanks, or excuse me, Cody,

5425
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:41,000
thanks so much for calling into

5426
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:43,000
the show tonight. I appreciate it, and

5427
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:45,000
yeah, you call in any time.

5428
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:47,000
No problem, and, you know, I was

5429
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:49,000
actually, I had a tweet last week

5430
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:51,000
telling

5431
03:03:51,000 --> 03:03:53,000
you guys about a Borderlands 2

5432
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:55,000
giveaway, and I don't know if I remember. Oh, that was you!

5433
03:03:55,000 --> 03:03:57,000
It is me! Yeah, it was you!

5434
03:03:57,000 --> 03:03:59,000
Okay. I was an

5435
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:01,000
idiot and didn't link the freaking

5436
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:03,000
YouTube video. Alright, plug

5437
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:05,000
away. Oh, um,

5438
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:07,000
I actually, I have a small gaming

5439
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:09,000
channel on YouTube. It's not huge.

5440
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:11,000
I don't get paid for it or anything like that. I just enjoy

5441
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:13,000
gaming and showing people my games.

5442
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:15,000
Hey, it's what we're doing here. It's the exact same thing

5443
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:17,000
we do here, except we're audio.

5444
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:19,000
Oh, yes.

5445
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:21,000
And my channel is just funny commentary,

5446
03:04:21,000 --> 03:04:23,000
but, yeah, I'm giving away

5447
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:25,000
a copy of Borderlands 2.

5448
03:04:25,000 --> 03:04:27,000
I mean, it's any platform

5449
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:29,000
out there that's,

5450
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:31,000
you know, gonna be out PC, PS3,

5451
03:04:31,000 --> 03:04:33,000
360, Steam, any

5452
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:35,000
of that, so, um,

5453
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:37,000
but, yeah, it's, um,

5454
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:39,000
actually, my YouTube channel is

5455
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:41,000
linked in my Skype, if you wanna,

5456
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:43,000
but I can say it on here, if you want.

5457
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:45,000
Yeah, you better say it, because it'll take me too long

5458
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:47,000
to bring it up, so go ahead. Spell it or whatever.

5459
03:04:47,000 --> 03:04:49,000
Um, it's, it's, uh,

5460
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:51,000
www.youtube.com

5461
03:04:51,000 --> 03:04:55,000
backslash ctaylor1785

5462
03:04:55,000 --> 03:04:57,000
ctaylor1785.

5463
03:04:57,000 --> 03:04:59,000
You know, I gotta be honest,

5464
03:04:59,000 --> 03:05:01,000
buddy, you wanna get some more hits on your YouTube channel,

5465
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:03,000
you're gonna have to come up with something really catchy.

5466
03:05:03,000 --> 03:05:05,000
1785 is hard to remember,

5467
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:07,000
so, we'll see.

5468
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:09,000
Well, it was kind of funny, because I

5469
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:11,000
came up with the YouTube channel a long time ago,

5470
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:13,000
but never did anything, and so now I can't

5471
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:15,000
change it, and now my channel's

5472
03:05:15,000 --> 03:05:17,000
called Codeman Games.

5473
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:19,000
Okay, that's good. That's good.

5474
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:21,000
Or I was gonna say, like, how about, like,

5475
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:23,000
Tailored Games or something silly, I don't know.

5476
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:25,000
But the video,

5477
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:27,000
if anybody's wanted, the video is

5478
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:29,000
called, um, I believe it's called

5479
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:31,000
That Robot Has a Temper. I actually have a cell

5480
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:33,000
phone call with Claptrap, and he's, like,

5481
03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:35,000
cussing and all this different stuff, so it's

5482
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:37,000
pretty fun. And, uh, yeah, but just

5483
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:39,000
tell me, you know, if they want a free copy, you know,

5484
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:41,000
just send them on over. Alright.

5485
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:43,000
Poor people who love

5486
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:45,000
Borderlands. Hey, I'm poor.

5487
03:05:45,000 --> 03:05:47,000
I got a four month old.

5488
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:49,000
You're not that poor if you're giving away a copy

5489
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:51,000
of Borderlands 2. No, I think that's great.

5490
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:53,000
I, I, uh, I,

5491
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:55,000
I fully support the indie press in all forms,

5492
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:57,000
so go check that out, everybody. Alright, good luck

5493
03:05:57,000 --> 03:05:59,000
with your YouTubes, and we'll talk to you in a later week,

5494
03:05:59,000 --> 03:06:01,000
okay? Alright, thank you, Rob. I appreciate it.

5495
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:03,000
No problem. Take care, buddy.

5496
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:05,000
You too. Bye.

5497
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:07,000
Alright, that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight. That was a good

5498
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:09,000
guy. I love the long time listener

5499
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:11,000
first time callers, and he handled that very well.

5500
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:13,000
He didn't, he didn't freeze up.

5501
03:06:13,000 --> 03:06:15,000
Sometimes people, when they're new, like, hello, hello,

5502
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:17,000
am I on? Hello? Hello? Echo? What? Hello?

5503
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:19,000
He was... Very good, uh, phone presence.

5504
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:21,000
Yes. You get a, I don't,

5505
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:23,000
I don't know if we could give a gold star for that,

5506
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:25,000
but you would definitely get, like, a silver star.

5507
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:27,000
Alright.

5508
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:29,000
Platinum for me.

5509
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:31,000
Alright, uh, that's gonna do it.

5510
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:33,000
For the bow tie, for the bow tie. Yeah, that's true.

5511
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:35,000
The bow tie was pretty awesome. Alright, that's gonna do it

5512
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:37,000
for the, uh, Skype calls tonight.

5513
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:39,000
If you didn't get through, don't be mad.

5514
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:41,000
Send tweets. You know, TigerClaw's

5515
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:43,000
like the only one that's been sending tweets this week,

5516
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:45,000
so you can either send tweets, or, you can send us

5517
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:47,000
an email. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

5518
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:49,000
Speaking of TigerClaw's tweets,

5519
03:06:49,000 --> 03:06:51,000
I did want to get through these real quick.

5520
03:06:51,000 --> 03:06:53,000
Uncharted and The Director Changeover.

5521
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:55,000
Uh, David O. Russell

5522
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:57,000
had been on there. He had made the movie

5523
03:06:57,000 --> 03:06:59,000
I Heart Huckabees. Well, he's not there anymore.

5524
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:01,000
Neil Berger left the project.

5525
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:03,000
Uh, who is on the project now?

5526
03:07:03,000 --> 03:07:05,000
The, the writers of

5527
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:07,000
National Treasure,

5528
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:09,000
Marianne and Cormac Wiberly.

5529
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:11,000
God, I hate Nicolas Cage.

5530
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:13,000
It's like, I have no frame

5531
03:07:13,000 --> 03:07:15,000
of reference, cause I refuse to see those movies.

5532
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:17,000
You know what? The only good thing

5533
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:19,000
he did was raising Arizona. They seem

5534
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:21,000
topical enough.

5535
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:23,000
I don't know. I guess I could see

5536
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:25,000
a movie like that leading to Uncharted, but

5537
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:27,000
alright. So, there you go.

5538
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:29,000
Um,

5539
03:07:29,000 --> 03:07:31,000
let's see. Oh, Neil Berger

5540
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:33,000
directed Limitless,

5541
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:35,000
and he left, and then he

5542
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:37,000
he had replaced somebody else.

5543
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:39,000
So, who's directing it now?

5544
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:41,000
I don't think they have a

5545
03:07:41,000 --> 03:07:43,000
director right now. I'm looking right now.

5546
03:07:43,000 --> 03:07:45,000
It's not gonna happen. Who knows?

5547
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:47,000
They may still make one.

5548
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:49,000
Nope, they just say

5549
03:07:49,000 --> 03:07:51,000
somebody left. Alright. Uh,

5550
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:53,000
one more. Oh, I like this. This is

5551
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:55,000
nice. Out

5552
03:07:55,000 --> 03:07:57,000
of all the bad news we've had

5553
03:07:57,000 --> 03:07:59,000
tonight, I like

5554
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:01,000
a little bit of good news. So, thank you,

5555
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:03,000
Tigerclaw, for sending this. And I think this is

5556
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:05,000
a good note to end on tonight, although Loki

5557
03:08:05,000 --> 03:08:07,000
may have last minute stories. Actually, no, I want to end on

5558
03:08:07,000 --> 03:08:09,000
this. Loki, do you have any last minute stories before I get to this?

5559
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:11,000
Eh, some, some MMOs

5560
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:13,000
stole a map from Counter-Strike.

5561
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:15,000
That's all we need to know. Big deal.

5562
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:17,000
Alright.

5563
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:19,000
Here you go. A nice thing to end on.

5564
03:08:19,000 --> 03:08:21,000
Thank you, Tigerclaw. Microsoft

5565
03:08:21,000 --> 03:08:23,000
is throwing an industry mixer

5566
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:25,000
for the folks from OnLive

5567
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:27,000
who are affected by the restructuring.

5568
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:29,000
Uh, they are scouting

5569
03:08:29,000 --> 03:08:31,000
for Xbox-oriented positions

5570
03:08:31,000 --> 03:08:33,000
for Mountain View, California, and

5571
03:08:33,000 --> 03:08:35,000
Redmond, Washington. A quote from

5572
03:08:35,000 --> 03:08:37,000
Microsoft on the public invitation,

5573
03:08:37,000 --> 03:08:39,000
We are eager to speak to individuals and teams

5574
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:41,000
affected by the OnLive transition.

5575
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:43,000
We are looking to add key

5576
03:08:43,000 --> 03:08:45,000
players who want to make a real impact

5577
03:08:45,000 --> 03:08:47,000
in creating groundbreaking new products

5578
03:08:47,000 --> 03:08:49,000
and services. I gotta

5579
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:51,000
say, what a great way to answer

5580
03:08:51,000 --> 03:08:53,000
Sony getting Gaikai.

5581
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:55,000
Just hire the old OnLive employees

5582
03:08:55,000 --> 03:08:57,000
for your company. Sounds good.

5583
03:08:57,000 --> 03:08:59,000
Amazing. Amazing.

5584
03:08:59,000 --> 03:09:01,000
Oh, Dark Tetsuya sending a late tweet here.

5585
03:09:01,000 --> 03:09:03,000
I finished updating the wiki

5586
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:05,000
with recently found episodes.

5587
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:07,000
So, Dark Tetsuya doing a wiki

5588
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:09,000
update. Thank you, Dark Tetsuya.

5589
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:11,000
Thank you, fans, for updating

5590
03:09:11,000 --> 03:09:13,000
that wiki. You guys are amazing.

5591
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:15,000
orangeloungeradio.wikia

5592
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:17,000
W-I-K-I-A dot com.

5593
03:09:17,000 --> 03:09:19,000
You guys make sure that I don't repeat games.

5594
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:21,000
You use it as a source.

5595
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:23,000
I use it all the time.

5596
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:25,000
It impacts what we do here on the show.

5597
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:27,000
Alright, I see you guys are packing up. I know you gotta

5598
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:29,000
get out. We all got work tomorrow. We've gone

5599
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:31,000
long tonight. But thank you guys for staying up

5600
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:33,000
late with us. We really appreciate it. We can't

5601
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:35,000
end the show, however, until we get to the final thoughts.

5602
03:09:35,000 --> 03:09:37,000
So, let's do some final thoughts.

5603
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:39,000
Um, Dark Sakura, start us off

5604
03:09:39,000 --> 03:09:41,000
tonight. I don't want to go to bed.

5605
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:43,000
Uh, Loki,

5606
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:45,000
your final thoughts tonight? Um,

5607
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:47,000
I don't know.

5608
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:49,000
I want to wear this shirt to work.

5609
03:09:49,000 --> 03:09:51,000
I'm going to. Alright,

5610
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:53,000
you should. Um, my final thought

5611
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:55,000
is, because I neglected to say

5612
03:09:55,000 --> 03:09:57,000
it at the start of part B, as

5613
03:09:57,000 --> 03:09:59,000
I plan to, I do want to say

5614
03:09:59,000 --> 03:10:01,000
rest in peace to Neil Armstrong.

5615
03:10:01,000 --> 03:10:03,000
Um, but what an amazing

5616
03:10:03,000 --> 03:10:05,000
life to have actually gone

5617
03:10:05,000 --> 03:10:07,000
to the moon. I mean, that's something we all dream about

5618
03:10:07,000 --> 03:10:09,000
as kids. And, like, he actually did it.

5619
03:10:09,000 --> 03:10:11,000
So, yes, it's unfortunate that

5620
03:10:11,000 --> 03:10:13,000
he passed, but let's not focus on the

5621
03:10:13,000 --> 03:10:15,000
fact he died. Let's focus on the fact

5622
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:17,000
that, like, like

5623
03:10:17,000 --> 03:10:19,000
he did something that all of us dream about.

5624
03:10:19,000 --> 03:10:21,000
And I think that's just amazing.

5625
03:10:21,000 --> 03:10:23,000
So, a tip of the hat to Neil Armstrong.

5626
03:10:23,000 --> 03:10:25,000
That's going to do it for. Well, that doesn't

5627
03:10:25,000 --> 03:10:27,000
directly actually go with video games, too.

5628
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:29,000
How so? Do you know that?

5629
03:10:29,000 --> 03:10:31,000
Because Buzz Aldrin was the voice of the guy in the end

5630
03:10:31,000 --> 03:10:33,000
of Mass Effect 3. Sure, sure.

5631
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:35,000
You know, they were all kind of. That's a tie.

5632
03:10:35,000 --> 03:10:37,000
I'm just trying to say. But, yeah,

5633
03:10:37,000 --> 03:10:39,000
that was pretty. And Phyllis Diller.

5634
03:10:39,000 --> 03:10:41,000
Yeah, rest in peace Phyllis Diller.

5635
03:10:41,000 --> 03:10:43,000
She was so awesome. We've lost a lot of great people

5636
03:10:43,000 --> 03:10:45,000
over the past couple of weeks. It's really sad. And the guy who was the

5637
03:10:45,000 --> 03:10:47,000
Count. Mm-hmm.

5638
03:10:47,000 --> 03:10:49,000
And Cry. Yeah. Tragic, tragic.

5639
03:10:49,000 --> 03:10:51,000
And the lady who was the astronaut.

5640
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:53,000
Sally Ride. Yeah.

5641
03:10:53,000 --> 03:10:55,000
That was a few weeks ago. We didn't

5642
03:10:55,000 --> 03:10:57,000
mention it on the show. It may have been a week you weren't here,

5643
03:10:57,000 --> 03:10:59,000
but. That means just, like, a bunch of people just.

5644
03:10:59,000 --> 03:11:01,000
Yeah. It's very unfortunate. Very unfortunate.

5645
03:11:01,000 --> 03:11:03,000
But, um, you know,

5646
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:05,000
look at accomplishments. Look ahead.

5647
03:11:05,000 --> 03:11:07,000
Look ahead to two weeks.

5648
03:11:07,000 --> 03:11:09,000
We'll be back with an all new episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5649
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:11,000

5651
03:11:13,000 --> 03:11:15,000
catching up on video games.
