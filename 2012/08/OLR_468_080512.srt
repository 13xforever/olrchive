1
00:00:14,092 --> 00:00:18,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, August 5th, 2012, another MMO is set to go free to play.

2
00:00:19,198 --> 00:00:22,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone decides to take Zynga to court over an allegedly copied game.

3
00:00:23,263 --> 00:00:26,267
[SPEAKER_01]: And has the Wii U detailed launch lineup been revealed?

4
00:00:31,846 --> 00:00:38,071
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:44,956
[SPEAKER_14]: It is Orange Lounge Radio with this episode number 468 for August the 5th of 2012.

6
00:00:46,357 --> 00:00:53,682
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you with my co-hosts over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that good stuff.

7
00:00:54,062 --> 00:00:54,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Here they are.

8
00:00:54,683 --> 00:00:57,505
[SPEAKER_14]: Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:58,485 --> 00:00:58,986
[SPEAKER_14]: How are you doing?

10
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:00,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of in pain.

11
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:24,320
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's Bank of America, but I'm not going to say anything else.

12
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:28,122
[SPEAKER_14]: But maybe a silver lining to it all, at least I hope.

13
00:01:28,442 --> 00:01:28,702
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope.

14
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:29,782
[SPEAKER_14]: We're all pulling for you.

15
00:01:29,902 --> 00:01:30,502
[SPEAKER_14]: Something will come up.

16
00:01:31,003 --> 00:01:31,323
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

17
00:01:31,543 --> 00:01:34,404
[SPEAKER_14]: If you listen to Bobby Blackwolf's show, let me just plug real quick.

18
00:01:34,564 --> 00:01:36,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I could work for Zynga and get sued.

19
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:48,373
[SPEAKER_14]: Listen to us live at the Voice of Geeks Network and participate at live.vognetwork.com where we do tape Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

20
00:01:48,433 --> 00:01:52,255
[SPEAKER_14]: And as we learned on Bobby Blackwolf tonight, you never know who might recruit you.

21
00:01:52,555 --> 00:01:54,497
[SPEAKER_14]: So tune into that.

22
00:01:54,517 --> 00:01:55,117
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

23
00:01:55,697 --> 00:01:57,038
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I could work for evil.

24
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,420
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, moving on.

25
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,262
[SPEAKER_15]: Say hello to evil tech master Loki.

26
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I could if they pay well.

27
00:02:03,503 --> 00:02:04,884
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care what they do.

28
00:02:05,264 --> 00:02:06,144
[SPEAKER_02]: We slaughter kittens.

29
00:02:06,345 --> 00:02:06,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

30
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:09,607
[SPEAKER_14]: Do I hear $100 for your soul?

31
00:02:09,727 --> 00:02:09,607
$100, $100, $200.

32
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:12,949
[SPEAKER_14]: How you doing, TechmasterLoki?

33
00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:15,731
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they'd be virtual kittens, but it's not real kittens.

34
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:16,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop.

35
00:02:16,912 --> 00:02:17,253
[SPEAKER_02]: That's wrong.

36
00:02:18,533 --> 00:02:18,794
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?

37
00:02:18,814 --> 00:02:19,154
[SPEAKER_02]: What's new?

38
00:02:19,774 --> 00:02:20,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing fine.

39
00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:20,715
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah?

40
00:02:21,476 --> 00:02:22,817
[SPEAKER_14]: What was this project thingy?

41
00:02:22,837 --> 00:02:25,258
[SPEAKER_14]: You were showing me pictures of a project thingy you've been working on.

42
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:27,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it was just brief.

43
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,883
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to make something for Josh's birthday party because he had a Mario-themed birthday party, but...

44
00:02:33,263 --> 00:02:36,025
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this to match his Mario-themed bedroom and so forth?

45
00:02:36,145 --> 00:02:36,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's just this year.

46
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:43,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Because last year was pork-themed, so... We decided that... I love that you threw a baby a pork-themed wedding.

47
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:44,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Wedding?

48
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:45,810
[SPEAKER_14]: Birthday.

49
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:46,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Gee, Rob.

50
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,871
[SPEAKER_02]: One step at a time, okay?

51
00:02:48,311 --> 00:02:48,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

52
00:02:51,813 --> 00:02:53,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe later on down the line.

53
00:02:55,095 --> 00:02:56,255
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be down.

54
00:02:57,356 --> 00:03:00,838
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, he had a Mario birthday party.

55
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:02,141
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

56
00:03:02,241 --> 00:03:02,621
[SPEAKER_14]: That was fun.

57
00:03:02,661 --> 00:03:06,542
[SPEAKER_14]: So you made like a little paper mache, or no, that was more like a paper craft.

58
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:07,302
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a paper craft.

59
00:03:07,322 --> 00:03:08,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Paper craft.

60
00:03:08,163 --> 00:03:08,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Koopa.

61
00:03:08,343 --> 00:03:09,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Like origami or something.

62
00:03:09,763 --> 00:03:13,784
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's pretty much full size.

63
00:03:13,824 --> 00:03:14,804
[SPEAKER_02]: It's over two feet tall.

64
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:21,686
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing is I didn't finish it because I neglected to look at the paper craft model that closely.

65
00:03:21,726 --> 00:03:29,348
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently the way they have things connect together are impossible in reality because they just kind of phase through each other.

66
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:35,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that might work in a computer game, but it's not going to work when you have to glue stuff to other things.

67
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:39,313
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, okay, I have to cut a hole here, I guess, in order to get this to work.

68
00:03:39,673 --> 00:03:45,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I managed to get two of the pieces together before the show, like his leg in the shoe.

69
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:49,477
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a pain in the ass.

70
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,519
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to take a long time.

71
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,562
[SPEAKER_14]: You're the one that wanted to start arts and crafts.

72
00:03:53,742 --> 00:03:55,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, but it's pretty much done.

73
00:03:56,246 --> 00:03:57,727
[SPEAKER_14]: The pictures look good.

74
00:03:57,767 --> 00:03:59,590
[SPEAKER_14]: We should try to get those up at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

75
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,472
[SPEAKER_14]: But anyhow, let's also introduce, we have a special guest tonight.

76
00:04:03,512 --> 00:04:12,477
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's a big night at the Voice of Geeks Network, and I'll explain why in just a little bit, but a big night made bigger by the return of a favorite guest to OLR.

77
00:04:12,557 --> 00:04:14,238
[SPEAKER_14]: He hasn't been here in some time.

78
00:04:14,738 --> 00:04:20,821
[SPEAKER_14]: The last time I remember you being here was the Marathon show, maybe one show after that, but you definitely haven't been here since the VOG switchover and all that.

79
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,102
[SPEAKER_14]: Say hello to Arcadian42 is back.

80
00:04:24,423 --> 00:04:25,044
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's favorite?

81
00:04:27,245 --> 00:04:28,406
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a while.

82
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:29,867
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, probably last year.

83
00:04:30,288 --> 00:04:30,568
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

84
00:04:30,588 --> 00:04:31,829
[SPEAKER_14]: So welcome back.

85
00:04:31,969 --> 00:04:33,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's earlier this year, actually.

86
00:04:33,631 --> 00:04:33,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

87
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:36,433
[SPEAKER_14]: But it was in the old place.

88
00:04:36,933 --> 00:04:43,318
[SPEAKER_14]: So welcome to the smaller condensed studio at Casa de Rob and Alan.

89
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:47,522
[SPEAKER_10]: So you fit a little bit better here with the open environment rather than a little room.

90
00:04:47,802 --> 00:04:48,182
[SPEAKER_14]: That's true.

91
00:04:48,242 --> 00:04:48,622
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know what?

92
00:04:48,682 --> 00:04:49,763
[SPEAKER_14]: Sometimes it works pretty good.

93
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:54,085
[SPEAKER_14]: Like last week when we had the whole PlayStation Home thing going on, you know, it was going on on the TV over there.

94
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,466
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's like, you know, we got we got a nice open space.

95
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:58,987
[SPEAKER_14]: And once in a while, a cat might come through and try to lick your feet.

96
00:04:59,127 --> 00:04:59,587
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll see.

97
00:05:00,308 --> 00:05:01,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Not likely.

98
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:02,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

99
00:05:02,549 --> 00:05:05,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Marco might walk by, stick his tail in the air and then run off.

100
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,931
[SPEAKER_14]: Not bloody likely.

101
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:15,233
[SPEAKER_14]: So, if folks haven't heard you on the show before, let's try to tell the listeners a little bit about what you're all about.

102
00:05:15,953 --> 00:05:17,374
[SPEAKER_14]: You're a huge Sega fan.

103
00:05:17,414 --> 00:05:18,554
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember that about you, right?

104
00:05:18,574 --> 00:05:19,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Something like that.

105
00:05:19,874 --> 00:05:21,855
[SPEAKER_10]: I played a lot of Sega games when I was growing up.

106
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:26,776
[SPEAKER_10]: I had Genesis and Saturn.

107
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:30,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, I have a bunch of Japanese Saturn games, though.

108
00:05:30,737 --> 00:05:31,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

109
00:05:50,234 --> 00:06:02,466
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you also do a lot of traveling, like following you on Facebook and everything.

110
00:06:02,526 --> 00:06:07,130
[SPEAKER_14]: You love to go on the, or at least it seems like, reading your Facebook, you love to go on these kind of like just adventures.

111
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:11,614
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, I'm going to get in the car and drive to Yellowstone.

112
00:06:11,714 --> 00:06:12,135
[SPEAKER_14]: See you later.

113
00:06:12,815 --> 00:06:14,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, pretty much.

114
00:06:15,077 --> 00:06:17,298
[SPEAKER_10]: I've done a big road trip the last two or three years.

115
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:22,522
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't done too many small road trips other than going to Yosemite a bunch just for hiking.

116
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,183
[SPEAKER_14]: You climbed Half Dome this year, right?

117
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:24,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

118
00:06:24,703 --> 00:06:25,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Congrats.

119
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,084
[SPEAKER_10]: I did that four years ago.

120
00:06:26,404 --> 00:06:32,788
[SPEAKER_14]: And you didn't get killed, which is a thing that unfortunately has a bit of a reputation for these days.

121
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:34,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you only get killed if you're stupid.

122
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Allegedly.

123
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,091
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe they should change it to Half Darwin.

124
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:39,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Allegedly.

125
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:44,953
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's only been one person who's died on a dry day.

126
00:06:46,313 --> 00:06:50,334
[SPEAKER_10]: They might have had a little bit to drink.

127
00:06:50,454 --> 00:06:54,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Most everything at the time was when it was stormy or wet or there was a thunderstorm or something around.

128
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:59,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone got close like two months ago.

129
00:06:59,216 --> 00:07:00,377
[SPEAKER_10]: We almost fell off the side.

130
00:07:02,477 --> 00:07:08,301
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you like to kind of sometimes go to expos and conventions and things too because you're kind of like the norm of these things.

131
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:09,822
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, you know, remember Cheers?

132
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:13,845
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's kind of like, you know, I'll be at California Extreme and then all of a sudden, oh, Bradley's through the door.

133
00:07:14,205 --> 00:07:15,886
[SPEAKER_14]: Bradley is here.

134
00:07:16,466 --> 00:07:17,787
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you go to California Extreme this year?

135
00:07:17,807 --> 00:07:18,308
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, yes, I did.

136
00:07:18,448 --> 00:07:19,488
[SPEAKER_14]: I just knew you did.

137
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:20,049
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was so...

138
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,051
[SPEAKER_14]: I was irritated I couldn't go.

139
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:26,073
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, granted, you know, I have to pick my priorities.

140
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:30,156
[SPEAKER_14]: Do I want to do screening movie thingies or do I want to do California Extreme?

141
00:07:30,256 --> 00:07:31,337
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you run into Dan?

142
00:07:31,437 --> 00:07:34,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I ran into him once.

143
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,402
[SPEAKER_10]: I was playing Kung Fu Master and he stopped by and said hi.

144
00:07:38,662 --> 00:07:39,203
[SPEAKER_14]: So how was it?

145
00:07:39,243 --> 00:07:40,744
[SPEAKER_14]: Since we couldn't review it, none of us went.

146
00:07:40,804 --> 00:07:41,985
[SPEAKER_14]: How was California Extreme this year?

147
00:07:42,145 --> 00:07:42,726
[SPEAKER_10]: That was pretty good.

148
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:45,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much similar as usual.

149
00:07:45,288 --> 00:07:48,070
[SPEAKER_10]: A bunch of games here and there and everywhere.

150
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Can't remember if there's anything super special there.

151
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,597
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a bunch of new pinballs, but I didn't get to play them.

152
00:07:56,197 --> 00:07:58,459
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if they're new, but at least newer ones.

153
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,201
[SPEAKER_14]: Did they have the Tron pinball?

154
00:08:00,281 --> 00:08:01,602
[SPEAKER_14]: I have yet to play that still.

155
00:08:01,642 --> 00:08:02,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan's friend owns one.

156
00:08:03,303 --> 00:08:04,604
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to visit Dan's friend.

157
00:08:04,624 --> 00:08:05,505
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the special editions.

158
00:08:05,805 --> 00:08:07,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Can't remember if I saw one or not.

159
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:07,987
[SPEAKER_10]: It might have been there.

160
00:08:08,007 --> 00:08:09,949
[SPEAKER_10]: I just didn't get a chance to play it.

161
00:08:10,327 --> 00:08:11,508
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

162
00:08:33,004 --> 00:08:49,914
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's just, yeah, it's just all these arcade owners, private owners mostly that own old arcade games and they just convene on a convention center or a hotel ballroom and it's just all these games you pay 40, 50 bucks and it's just free to play the whole weekend, all these old games.

163
00:08:49,934 --> 00:08:52,275
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's really an emphasis on classic games.

164
00:08:52,295 --> 00:08:56,737
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've got to play so much stuff that you just don't get to play anywhere anymore.

165
00:08:56,818 --> 00:09:01,100
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I played Journey the last time I was there and some pinball games.

166
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,882
[SPEAKER_14]: Once in a while they have a couple new things here and there, but it's mostly about classic.

167
00:09:05,283 --> 00:09:11,327
[SPEAKER_14]: But I've got to say, Neil, a friend of mine, he sent me a video from California Extreme.

168
00:09:11,427 --> 00:09:12,888
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess, like, I don't know what it was.

169
00:09:12,908 --> 00:09:15,690
[SPEAKER_14]: It was one of those, like, animatronic bands they had.

170
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:22,354
[SPEAKER_14]: He sent me a very scary video of the animatronic band singing Total Eclipse of the Heart or something.

171
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:23,555
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, what is this?

172
00:09:23,755 --> 00:09:25,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I went by there just, like, once.

173
00:09:25,756 --> 00:09:30,239
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of just passed by and went, saw it for, like, 10 seconds and went on to something else.

174
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

175
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:33,921
[SPEAKER_02]: As awesome as what it is.

176
00:09:54,113 --> 00:10:10,974

[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, DDRDollarBill is like, what?

179
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:17,140
[SPEAKER_14]: Robotron?

180
00:10:18,061 --> 00:10:19,702
[SPEAKER_14]: What's Robotron?

181
00:10:19,882 --> 00:10:20,703
[SPEAKER_14]: No, Robotron.

182
00:10:21,264 --> 00:10:23,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they do have it on Xbox Live Arcade.

183
00:10:25,087 --> 00:10:26,909
[SPEAKER_14]: It was one of the first Xbox Live Arcade titles.

184
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:27,309
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it.

185
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:27,730
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

186
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,073
[SPEAKER_14]: Robotron was a rejected 2DX character, just saying.

187
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:33,355
[SPEAKER_14]: Little inside joke there for the music game fans.

188
00:10:34,264 --> 00:10:34,924
[SPEAKER_14]: I played it in band.

189
00:10:58,339 --> 00:10:58,759
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you really?

190
00:10:58,939 --> 00:10:59,800
[SPEAKER_05]: London 2012!

191
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:05,985
[SPEAKER_05]: That one in the, was it 92 theme?

192
00:11:06,825 --> 00:11:07,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Play that too.

193
00:11:08,386 --> 00:11:13,590
[SPEAKER_14]: The Olympic event on a 12-hour tape delay, live from London.

194
00:11:14,331 --> 00:11:15,972
[SPEAKER_14]: Just change the AM to PM.

195
00:11:16,772 --> 00:11:25,499
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyhow, I don't actually really want to talk about the Olympics itself, but I want to talk about, because you know, you can probably go to any other website on the internet and read something about Michael Phelps.

196
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:30,303
[SPEAKER_14]: But what I really want to talk about is I want to talk about a story that's circulating the internet.

197
00:11:30,383 --> 00:11:33,586
[SPEAKER_14]: And when I'm talking circulating the internet, I don't mean just like on the video game blogs.

198
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:37,190
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean this is on CNN.com in their tech section right now.

199
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,512
[SPEAKER_14]: So on CNN, they're running a story right now.

200
00:11:39,812 --> 00:11:42,475
[SPEAKER_14]: Should pro gamers be considered athletes?

201
00:11:43,175 --> 00:11:45,217
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that's a good question I want to ask you guys tonight.

202
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:47,179
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you're starting off with a bang.

203
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:47,840
[SPEAKER_14]: No, why not?

204
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Why should pro gamers not be considered athletes?

205
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:51,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's a video game.

206
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,421
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't really require any physical prowess to be good at it.

207
00:11:54,701 --> 00:12:01,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe some good hand-eye coordination, but the Olympics are traditionally a test of physical skill.

208
00:12:02,424 --> 00:12:03,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe DDR?

209
00:12:04,064 --> 00:12:08,326
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but it should be something purely physical.

210
00:12:08,946 --> 00:12:12,867
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, let me read some of the quotes from this article before I get too much more feedback.

211
00:12:12,887 --> 00:12:16,229
[SPEAKER_14]: And I definitely want your feedback in our chat room as well, live.vognetwork.com.

212
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:21,831
[SPEAKER_14]: And the article talks about StarCraft II and one of the big players in South Korea, Marine King.

213
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:27,613
[SPEAKER_14]: And he got kind of a bit of a reputation because he practiced 20 hours a day sometimes.

214
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:30,774
[SPEAKER_14]: And that got him called a gaming addict.

215
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:49,173
[SPEAKER_14]: but according to and CNN basically compiled some comments and according to one commenter on the CNN website one person said would you claim that Phelps is addicted to swimming so why did they want to say this guy was addicted to gaming because he trained 20 hours a week would you say that Michael Phelps is addicted to swimming no he's addicted to pot

216
00:12:52,156 --> 00:12:56,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone who can smoke weed and then win 21 gold medals, you win.

217
00:12:56,722 --> 00:12:57,243
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

218
00:12:58,024 --> 00:12:59,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying that's bad.

219
00:12:59,526 --> 00:13:01,108
[SPEAKER_14]: Didn't slow him down any.

220
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:05,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Not that I personally endorse it, but it is kind of funny.

221
00:13:06,115 --> 00:13:08,619
[SPEAKER_14]: It does set that whole argument back a little bit, doesn't it?

222
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:09,039
[SPEAKER_14]: But anyway.

223
00:13:10,946 --> 00:13:14,928
[SPEAKER_14]: Some folks say Marine King represents dedication, skill, perseverance.

224
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:16,468
[SPEAKER_14]: He's one of the best in the world.

225
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:20,710
[SPEAKER_14]: The skill required to be a pro gamer.

226
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:28,072
[SPEAKER_14]: The original article that the folks had commented on, it didn't distinguish the difference between game addiction and professional gaming or even gaming as a hobby.

227
00:13:28,472 --> 00:13:35,395
[SPEAKER_14]: I do not believe the article shows the amount of skill needed to be one of the best in the world or how truly big professional gaming has become.

228
00:13:36,235 --> 00:13:38,977
[SPEAKER_14]: on physicality being an important part of athletics.

229
00:13:39,038 --> 00:13:40,739
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, these comments from CNN.com.

230
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:42,540
[SPEAKER_14]: I wouldn't call them athletes.

231
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:46,504
[SPEAKER_14]: The one common denominator with all Olympians is the physicality involved.

232
00:13:46,904 --> 00:13:49,646
[SPEAKER_14]: Even the word athlete refers to physical activity.

233
00:13:50,027 --> 00:13:54,711
[SPEAKER_14]: I have no issues with video gaming, but the Olympics just seems to be the wrong venue.

234
00:13:54,811 --> 00:13:55,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

235
00:13:55,431 --> 00:13:58,073
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what venue that the Olympics needs?

236
00:13:58,814 --> 00:13:59,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck this video game playing.

237
00:13:59,855 --> 00:14:01,376
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about fucking laser tag.

238
00:14:01,777 --> 00:14:02,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Laser tag!

239
00:14:03,798 --> 00:14:04,919
[SPEAKER_02]: That is physical.

240
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,120
[SPEAKER_02]: That is awesome.

241
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,000
[SPEAKER_02]: That is what we need.

242
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,121
[SPEAKER_05]: But then they could just do paintball.

243
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,022
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be fine with paintball.

244
00:14:10,462 --> 00:14:11,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd settle for paintball.

245
00:14:13,264 --> 00:14:14,885
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as they have to be active.

246
00:14:14,925 --> 00:14:20,489
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I want some crazy Hunger Games-ish thing where if they don't move, then they explode.

247
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:22,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that I'm not working, I think I should be a professional paintballer.

248
00:14:25,892 --> 00:14:27,073
[SPEAKER_05]: What about that for a career change, Rob?

249
00:14:28,674 --> 00:14:29,174
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

250
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:30,535
[SPEAKER_14]: Now's the time to try new things.

251
00:14:30,735 --> 00:14:31,596
[SPEAKER_14]: Find what you really love.

252
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:33,889
[SPEAKER_14]: I sure do love shooting people.

253
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:34,910
[SPEAKER_14]: You could design guns.

254
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,111
[SPEAKER_14]: You like design and you like guns.

255
00:14:37,131 --> 00:14:37,832
[SPEAKER_14]: You should design guns.

256
00:14:37,852 --> 00:14:39,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to design a new gun.

257
00:14:39,553 --> 00:14:41,114
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

258
00:14:41,274 --> 00:14:44,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, your thoughts.

259
00:14:44,357 --> 00:14:47,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Should video games, StarCraft II be an Olympic sport?

260
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:47,599
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

261
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:48,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Why not?

262
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they don't do anything.

263
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:53,103
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, not saying they don't physically do anything.

264
00:14:54,044 --> 00:14:58,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving a mouse is not exercise or is not athletic in any way.

265
00:14:58,767 --> 00:14:59,107
[SPEAKER_02]: So, no.

266
00:14:59,448 --> 00:14:59,868
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

267
00:14:59,888 --> 00:15:00,949
[SPEAKER_02]: That does not belong.

268
00:15:01,718 --> 00:15:03,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody in chat just said a comment.

269
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Cyber Olympics or something like that.

270
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:09,804
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're going to create something that sort of way, then yeah, sure, why not.

271
00:15:10,505 --> 00:15:12,266
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody in chat just said a comment.

272
00:15:12,326 --> 00:15:12,947
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree with 100%.

273
00:15:14,228 --> 00:15:15,449
[SPEAKER_14]: Bradley, I'll check in with you.

274
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,070
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think?

275
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,612
[SPEAKER_14]: Do video games deserve to be in the Olympics or no?

276
00:15:20,012 --> 00:15:20,433
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

277
00:15:22,174 --> 00:15:23,575
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not only athletic or anything.

278
00:15:24,376 --> 00:15:25,597
[SPEAKER_10]: They could do a spectator.

279
00:15:25,617 --> 00:15:28,359
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a spectator, but what do you call that?

280
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:28,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh...

281
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:31,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Exhibition.

282
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Exhibition sort of thing.

283
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they did something like that.

284
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:35,062
[SPEAKER_10]: I can do exhibitions.

285
00:15:35,962 --> 00:15:37,483
[SPEAKER_14]: Not that type of exhibition.

286
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:44,367
[SPEAKER_10]: But they did like, I know they were talking about the last time that London had Olympics, they had like an Olympic poetry competition.

287
00:15:45,087 --> 00:15:45,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Olympic poetry?

288
00:15:45,647 --> 00:15:46,668
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait a minute.

289
00:15:47,728 --> 00:15:49,149
[SPEAKER_14]: Is pole dancing an Olympic sport?

290
00:15:49,169 --> 00:15:49,990
[SPEAKER_14]: Because that's physical.

291
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,331
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, what, Loki?

292
00:15:54,452 --> 00:15:55,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm liking this.

293
00:15:55,112 --> 00:15:57,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you know what used to be an Olympic sport?

294
00:15:57,794 --> 00:15:58,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Solo synchronized swimming.

295
00:15:58,955 --> 00:15:59,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on, hold on.

296
00:15:59,955 --> 00:16:00,355
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura.

297
00:16:00,415 --> 00:16:00,475
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

298
00:16:00,495 --> 00:16:00,915
[SPEAKER_14]: Why not?

299
00:16:00,935 --> 00:16:01,776
[SPEAKER_14]: Because strippers.

300
00:16:22,734 --> 00:16:24,014
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, should pole dancing be an elite sport?

301
00:16:24,034 --> 00:16:25,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, and you know why?

302
00:16:25,114 --> 00:16:27,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's not necessarily for strippers.

303
00:16:27,535 --> 00:16:30,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I understand that that is what they do.

304
00:16:30,295 --> 00:16:35,296
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, it's basically like the gymnastics routines and stuff that they do, but just on a pole.

305
00:16:35,316 --> 00:16:36,876
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll include it in gymnastics.

306
00:16:37,336 --> 00:16:42,837
[SPEAKER_02]: But it does require physical strength, and there's a bit of... The ability to spread your legs.

307
00:16:43,678 --> 00:16:43,898
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

308
00:16:45,698 --> 00:16:51,899
[SPEAKER_14]: As someone who took a pole dancing class, it is not just about spreading your legs, all right?

309
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:54,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think it should be included under gymnastics.

310
00:16:56,563 --> 00:16:56,983
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.

311
00:16:57,023 --> 00:16:57,904
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be under there.

312
00:16:57,924 --> 00:17:10,715
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because if you can have this stupid gymnastics event where you're prancing around with giant ribbons, then I should be able to, you know... They should have somebody that's, you know, prancing around on a pole.

313
00:17:10,855 --> 00:17:11,936
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, if... Look...

314
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:17,049
[SPEAKER_14]: There's like a ball dance or something where the chicks come out and play with balls.

315
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:17,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Ribbons.

316
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,391
[SPEAKER_14]: Balls and ribbons.

317
00:17:19,411 --> 00:17:21,534
[SPEAKER_14]: They have one at the ball too.

318
00:17:21,994 --> 00:17:23,556
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like a rhythm ball.

319
00:17:24,197 --> 00:17:24,918
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like Zumba.

320
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:27,641
[SPEAKER_14]: Bradley, pole dancing?

321
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:28,722
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes or no in the Olympics?

322
00:17:29,543 --> 00:17:31,105
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder how they're going to go judging on that.

323
00:17:34,171 --> 00:17:34,791
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, let's see.

324
00:17:34,871 --> 00:17:37,073
[SPEAKER_14]: The lady from Russia had the most erect nipples.

325
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:38,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one.

326
00:17:38,694 --> 00:17:40,895
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, to get it out of the gutter here a little bit.

327
00:17:41,675 --> 00:17:43,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Free running would be kind of cool.

328
00:17:45,361 --> 00:17:46,602
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the X Games stuff.

329
00:17:46,622 --> 00:17:49,903
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you put a motorcycle in there and you can't really go wrong.

330
00:17:50,324 --> 00:17:58,308
[SPEAKER_02]: If we just combine the Olympics and the X Games together, maybe that would be kind of like a gymnastics event for the X Games would be like strippers.

331
00:17:58,508 --> 00:18:02,870
[SPEAKER_14]: The problem is pole dancing has that stigma attached to it and it's not classy enough for the Olympics.

332
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,371
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why it would not, you know.

333
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:07,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure pole dancing can be done very classily.

334
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:08,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Classily.

335
00:18:08,372 --> 00:18:08,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Classic.

336
00:18:09,153 --> 00:18:09,673
[SPEAKER_05]: What's a good word?

337
00:18:10,433 --> 00:18:11,154
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be done with class.

338
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:11,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Not trashy.

339
00:18:11,614 --> 00:18:12,114
[SPEAKER_05]: With class.

340
00:18:12,254 --> 00:18:12,675
[SPEAKER_05]: With class.

341
00:18:12,695 --> 00:18:12,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Of it class.

342
00:18:12,955 --> 00:18:13,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Of it class.

343
00:18:16,232 --> 00:18:43,529
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not a stripper, I'm a dancer If you're dancing at Cheetah, that is not dancing TigerClaw in the chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says Would love to see games like Super Street Fighter 4 or Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom at the Olympics Those fighting games are super competitive So some disagree with what we're saying Now here's what I agree with This was the statement I agree with 110% which is why the video games aren't going to be in the Olympics Fifth dream

344
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:44,829
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

345
00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:03,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, they can do chess boxing.

346
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the way I play it.

347
00:19:05,662 --> 00:19:06,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Bitch table!

348
00:19:08,245 --> 00:19:09,146
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to be on the chess team.

349
00:19:09,186 --> 00:19:10,467
[SPEAKER_15]: Table flipping emoticon.

350
00:19:10,868 --> 00:19:12,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it could be chess boxing.

351
00:19:12,449 --> 00:19:14,471
[SPEAKER_10]: That actually is something that people actually do.

352
00:19:15,593 --> 00:19:16,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, is that like beatboxing?

353
00:19:17,094 --> 00:19:21,799
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something they like to play some chess and then they box and then go back and do some more chess.

354
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,261
[SPEAKER_10]: It's battle chess.

355
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:24,842
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like that biathlon or...

356
00:19:26,864 --> 00:19:29,727
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the biathlon for... I don't even know what that would be.

357
00:19:29,987 --> 00:19:30,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Chess and boxing?

358
00:19:31,749 --> 00:19:36,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Sophisticated and not sophisticated gaming.

359
00:19:36,354 --> 00:19:37,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

360
00:19:37,074 --> 00:19:39,056
[SPEAKER_14]: Blackwolf says full contact chess.

361
00:19:39,377 --> 00:19:40,978
[SPEAKER_14]: Actdeft says extreme chess.

362
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,142
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm gonna take that time clock and shove it up your ass.

363
00:19:44,602 --> 00:19:53,170
[SPEAKER_14]: What about, what about, um... There was an old Saturday Night Live sketch from, like, the 70s with the guy coaching the chess team, and it was all, Ponderick 4!

364
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:53,770
[SPEAKER_14]: Ponderick 4!

365
00:19:54,411 --> 00:19:54,911
[SPEAKER_14]: No!

366
00:19:55,672 --> 00:19:56,513
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, like, really funny.

367
00:19:56,633 --> 00:20:03,158
[SPEAKER_02]: What about, like, uh... I don't know, um... Some sort of, like, CGing or something like that.

368
00:20:03,178 --> 00:20:06,902
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, let's just start taking stuff from, like, American Gladiators or something.

369
00:20:07,222 --> 00:20:08,843
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, where we have, like, you know...

370
00:20:09,944 --> 00:20:26,855
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of, you know, they have, you know Fucking Siren and Zap and, you know, Nitro Those were my Olympians back in the day Okay Here we go Here we go The Olympics, I think, should stay to mostly traditional sports Curling should not be an Olympic sport, sorry

371
00:20:27,615 --> 00:20:28,616
[SPEAKER_05]: However... Get out.

372
00:20:30,077 --> 00:20:31,698
[SPEAKER_14]: Curling is like the only thing I'll watch.

373
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:35,621
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like professional cleaning as an Olympic sport.

374
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,562
[SPEAKER_14]: My mother would love curling.

375
00:20:37,882 --> 00:20:39,363
[SPEAKER_14]: It is exactly what she does.

376
00:20:39,624 --> 00:20:42,546
[SPEAKER_14]: The puck travels down and you follow in front of it with a broom.

377
00:20:42,606 --> 00:20:44,387
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like air hockey on the large scale.

378
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:46,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't we have Olympic air hockey?

379
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:48,770
[SPEAKER_05]: That I would vote for.

380
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:49,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Olympic air hockey.

381
00:20:51,212 --> 00:20:52,132
[SPEAKER_05]: We have ping pong

382
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:30,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, but I think that, you know, going back to stuff like the X Games and all the alternative sport things, I think they need to stay in their own kind of venue for the people who are more willing to watch that sort of activity and make pole dancing part of the gymnastic section.

383
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,420
[SPEAKER_02]: What about water skiing?

384
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't they have like water skiing or something like that?

385
00:21:33,381 --> 00:21:34,102
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

386
00:21:34,582 --> 00:21:35,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know what you could do with it.

387
00:21:35,763 --> 00:21:36,683
[SPEAKER_02]: They have like rowing.

388
00:21:36,743 --> 00:21:38,024
[SPEAKER_14]: There are events on the water.

389
00:21:38,324 --> 00:21:44,147
[SPEAKER_05]: There used to be, I think, water ski jumps back in... Are you saying water sports is an Olympic competition?

390
00:21:44,947 --> 00:21:48,949
[SPEAKER_05]: I think back in the day, but like I said, tug-of-war used to be an Olympic sport.

391
00:21:49,949 --> 00:21:51,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Solo synchronized swimming, Rob.

392
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:55,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Solo synchronized swimming was an Olympic sport.

393
00:21:55,592 --> 00:21:56,793
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to synchronize to?

394
00:21:56,893 --> 00:21:59,054
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's synchronizing to the music, but you know.

395
00:21:59,554 --> 00:22:00,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with Ranma.

396
00:22:00,314 --> 00:22:01,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything goes rhythm gymnastics.

397
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:26,729
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you have all the diving competitions, but they dive into a ball bin, you know, like a giant ball bin.

398
00:22:26,749 --> 00:22:31,174
[SPEAKER_14]: You just want to put on the pomp and circumstance gown and get up there in front of everybody.

399
00:22:31,214 --> 00:22:33,156
[SPEAKER_14]: May the odds be ever in your favor.

400
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Not even.

401
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,320
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to be the Queen of England of these games.

402
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:36,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck that.

403
00:22:36,901 --> 00:22:37,722
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be the goddamn queen.

404
00:22:37,742 --> 00:22:39,384
[SPEAKER_05]: She looks like she has diarrhea the whole time.

405
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,883
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the goddamn chairman of the Iron Chef in Japan.

406
00:22:44,043 --> 00:22:44,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck this American Iron Chef.

407
00:22:45,004 --> 00:22:46,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone needs to give old Liz a suppository.

408
00:22:47,525 --> 00:22:48,586
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, look.

409
00:22:48,626 --> 00:22:50,527
[SPEAKER_14]: That's her heart for that James Bond thing.

410
00:22:50,587 --> 00:22:51,128
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, right?

411
00:22:51,188 --> 00:22:52,309
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what else used to be a sport?

412
00:22:52,389 --> 00:22:52,629
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

413
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:53,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Distance diving.

414
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:58,253
[SPEAKER_05]: As in who could dive the longest distance before having to come up for Eric's...

415
00:22:58,673 --> 00:22:59,815
[SPEAKER_14]: I like Stan in chat.

416
00:22:59,835 --> 00:23:01,978
[SPEAKER_14]: 100 meter streaking.

417
00:23:02,378 --> 00:23:02,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Here.

418
00:23:02,979 --> 00:23:04,621
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody in London participated in that.

419
00:23:04,641 --> 00:23:04,881
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

420
00:23:05,622 --> 00:23:08,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Takashi's Castle and Ninja Warrior.

421
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:12,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are two perfectly acceptable events in my guess.

422
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,473
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

423
00:23:13,533 --> 00:23:13,953
[SPEAKER_14]: Look, look.

424
00:23:13,973 --> 00:23:15,896
[SPEAKER_14]: We got to move on from this topic and actually get to video games.

425
00:23:16,136 --> 00:23:20,339
[SPEAKER_14]: I do want to say, I love the comment, and I'm sorry I forgot who said it because it scrolled on by long ago.

426
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,661
[SPEAKER_14]: What about a separate competition for video games?

427
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:25,983
[SPEAKER_14]: Where is the true video game Olympics?

428
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:29,205
[SPEAKER_14]: Could we ever see a video game Olympics in our day?

429
00:23:29,705 --> 00:23:32,287
[SPEAKER_14]: Or, I mean, is it kind of already here with eSports?

430
00:23:33,508 --> 00:23:35,329
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the MLG garbage.

431
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:41,033
[SPEAKER_14]: The views and opinions expressed on this program do not necessarily reflect those.

432
00:23:41,113 --> 00:23:44,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I just don't like the whole MLG as like a

433
00:23:46,607 --> 00:23:46,927
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

434
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:49,169
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little weird.

435
00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:51,250
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm cool with MLG.

436
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,231
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have a beef with them.

437
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:56,233
[SPEAKER_14]: I want something with the pomp and circumstance of the Olympics.

438
00:23:56,413 --> 00:24:01,957
[SPEAKER_14]: I do want Queen Elizabeth out there going, you know, scowling at everything and judging other countries.

439
00:24:02,677 --> 00:24:03,798
[SPEAKER_14]: I want that for video games.

440
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:06,479
[SPEAKER_03]: I've decided that this country is the best.

441
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:07,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck all of you.

442
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck off.

443
00:24:08,521 --> 00:24:08,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck off.

444
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:10,482
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, even if she won't show up, get...

445
00:24:13,404 --> 00:24:15,585
[SPEAKER_14]: Who are the two that just got married?

446
00:24:15,765 --> 00:24:17,826
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm such an ignorant American right now.

447
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:20,488
[SPEAKER_14]: What, Kate and... Kate and William.

448
00:24:21,008 --> 00:24:23,209
[SPEAKER_14]: Get Kate and William out there, if nothing else.

449
00:24:23,349 --> 00:24:25,751
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, because video games are a younger generation.

450
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,332
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how I always remember them?

451
00:24:27,772 --> 00:24:31,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the little boy and witches, his mice were Kate and William.

452
00:24:33,089 --> 00:24:33,609
[SPEAKER_15]: You have issues.

453
00:24:33,629 --> 00:24:34,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Or were they William and Mary?

454
00:24:35,491 --> 00:24:36,531
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they were Kate and... Anyway.

455
00:24:36,632 --> 00:24:37,972
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about disc wars.

456
00:24:38,053 --> 00:24:39,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't we have disc wars?

457
00:24:39,594 --> 00:24:41,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Disc golf should be an official sport.

458
00:24:41,335 --> 00:24:44,457
[SPEAKER_14]: You smoke a lot of pot and then try to hit the ball.

459
00:24:44,857 --> 00:24:47,499
[SPEAKER_14]: Tigerclaw in our chatroom says they have the world cyber games.

460
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:52,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I have to quote Actdeft here because I have to do the voice from the queen.

461
00:24:53,103 --> 00:24:54,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Bunch of wankers!

462
00:24:54,664 --> 00:24:55,205
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, look.

463
00:24:55,485 --> 00:24:56,105
[SPEAKER_14]: We gotta move on.

464
00:24:56,225 --> 00:24:57,606
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't even done announcements.

465
00:24:57,646 --> 00:24:59,828
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a huge show coming up after Orange Monterey.

466
00:24:59,848 --> 00:25:01,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I should do the whole show in a rotten accent.

467
00:25:01,849 --> 00:25:02,410
[SPEAKER_14]: No, you shouldn't.

468
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,381
[SPEAKER_14]: That's my queen voice.

469
00:25:05,661 --> 00:25:12,284
[SPEAKER_14]: Somewhere, Peker Uno and Syl and other British listeners of this program are like crying at our accents.

470
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:14,925
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because I sound like What's-His-Face from Monty Python when I do it.

471
00:25:17,586 --> 00:25:21,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Every time you talk in a British accent, God throws a crumpet at a kitten.

472
00:25:22,748 --> 00:25:24,168
[SPEAKER_05]: If it was my cat, she wouldn't move.

473
00:25:24,188 --> 00:25:25,229
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

474
00:25:25,569 --> 00:25:26,709
[SPEAKER_05]: She'd be like, what the hell?

475
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:28,910
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving on.

476
00:25:30,235 --> 00:25:34,581
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the video games we've been playing this week.

477
00:25:35,121 --> 00:25:36,283
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll start with you, DarkSakura.

478
00:25:36,323 --> 00:25:37,284
[SPEAKER_14]: What have you been playing this week?

479
00:25:37,845 --> 00:25:39,647
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing lots of Mass Effect.

480
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:41,029
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not going to do it.

481
00:25:41,674 --> 00:25:43,095
[SPEAKER_05]: I played a crap ton of Mass Effect.

482
00:25:43,295 --> 00:25:56,299
[SPEAKER_05]: And being laid off, I had Pity Day, where I did nothing but look at Garrus fan art, read bad fan fiction, read some good fan fiction, played more Mass Effect, and we did a raid in WoW.

483
00:25:56,659 --> 00:25:58,420
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually raided.

484
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,000
[SPEAKER_05]: It happened.

485
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:03,561
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I had to go to bed early because of work that I don't have anymore.

486
00:26:03,661 --> 00:26:04,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn it, I could have finished the raid.

487
00:26:06,497 --> 00:26:08,579
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the thing that sucks most in retrospect.

488
00:26:08,659 --> 00:26:10,140
[SPEAKER_14]: I could have finished that damn raid.

489
00:26:10,501 --> 00:26:13,963
[SPEAKER_05]: I could have stayed for the whole damn thing, but no.

490
00:26:15,265 --> 00:26:19,668
[SPEAKER_05]: And Dan and I decided to watch some gameplay throughs on some stuff.

491
00:26:19,748 --> 00:26:22,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we've got the CDX hooked up.

492
00:26:22,871 --> 00:26:25,613
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so tempted to play through...

493
00:26:28,236 --> 00:26:33,702
[SPEAKER_05]: and put in Robo Alust and play through that again because it's one of my favorite shooters.

494
00:26:34,603 --> 00:26:35,684
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an awesome game.

495
00:26:36,324 --> 00:26:39,247
[SPEAKER_05]: We did watch several playthroughs of full motion video games.

496
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:45,594
[SPEAKER_05]: We watched Dragon's Lair and Space Ace all the way through.

497
00:26:47,128 --> 00:26:48,229
[SPEAKER_14]: Space Ace, Did You Know, Star Fox, R-Wing

498
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:10,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Pizza

499
00:27:36,587 --> 00:27:38,228
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, let's go to Bradley.

500
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:39,630
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll let our guests go next.

501
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:42,312
[SPEAKER_14]: Bradley, what kind of stuff have you been playing in the past week or so?

502
00:27:42,632 --> 00:27:44,514
[SPEAKER_10]: The main thing I've been playing is Assassin's Creed.

503
00:27:44,534 --> 00:27:46,476
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been sitting up on my shelf for a long time.

504
00:27:46,496 --> 00:27:47,637
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, I want to go play that.

505
00:27:48,818 --> 00:27:54,082
[SPEAKER_14]: That's one of two series I get the most emails about, why aren't you playing this series?

506
00:27:54,122 --> 00:27:56,624
[SPEAKER_14]: And the other is Borderlands, which I finally did start playing.

507
00:27:56,985 --> 00:27:59,527
[SPEAKER_14]: So I've got to get into that at some point.

508
00:27:59,547 --> 00:27:59,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

509
00:27:59,847 --> 00:28:09,330
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people kind of get bored with it, at least the first one, just because there's a lot of things you have to do several times, like you have to climb all these towers to get to the top.

510
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:13,712
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of things are kind of repetitive, but I'm fine with that.

511
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:22,515
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of the big stuff, the acting is pretty good, and actually getting up above the city and looking down is kind of fun.

512
00:28:23,496 --> 00:28:24,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Like your Batman?

513
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

514
00:28:49,043 --> 00:29:03,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Usually there's like a bunch of people there and you have to wait for them to get to a secluded area but I killed all the guards that were there and then just once you activate that thing you just beat them up right where you started so it makes that little thing a little bit easier to do.

515
00:29:04,438 --> 00:29:08,342
[SPEAKER_14]: Now are you playing these games to kind of set up for the third one that's coming out that's getting a lot of hype?

516
00:29:09,924 --> 00:29:12,965
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not really worried about that at the moment just because I don't have loads of time to play.

517
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:20,330
[SPEAKER_10]: I might probably get to two sometime, but just something I wanted to clear for my backlog because I have hundreds of games on the backlog.

518
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:24,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Another game played was

519
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:29,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Tetris Axis, which is more Tetris, and various different Tetris modes.

520
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:33,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Just the bad thing about it is that they don't let you use the circle pad to control.

521
00:29:33,997 --> 00:29:39,760
[SPEAKER_10]: I also played Mole Mania, just the first level of that.

522
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,623
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a classic sort of game that's on the 3DS.

523
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:48,365
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a classic hard puzzle game sort of thing.

524
00:29:48,485 --> 00:29:49,566
[SPEAKER_10]: I just played the first part of that.

525
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:54,555
[SPEAKER_10]: and also the other game I got to play was Rhythm Thief, which is a pretty good game.

526
00:29:56,178 --> 00:30:01,248
[SPEAKER_10]: So far I've gone through the first two chapters and all the rhythm games so far have been distinct.

527
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:06,854
[SPEAKER_14]: I played the demo of that on 3DS and I thought it was cool.

528
00:30:06,934 --> 00:30:08,675
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything seemed to be kind of different.

529
00:30:08,755 --> 00:30:09,836
[SPEAKER_14]: I liked that.

530
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:16,683
[SPEAKER_14]: It kind of was a throwback a little bit to me to Space Channel 5.

531
00:30:16,763 --> 00:30:21,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of like that zaniness off the wall uniqueness, but kind of like a different play style, which was cool.

532
00:30:22,816 --> 00:30:23,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's pretty cool.

533
00:30:24,837 --> 00:30:25,657
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been good so far.

534
00:30:26,978 --> 00:30:33,461
[SPEAKER_10]: The one silly thing about it is that the dog that follows them around is called Fondue.

535
00:30:34,862 --> 00:30:38,204
[SPEAKER_10]: And they have all these opportunities to make cheese jokes, and they do.

536
00:30:38,224 --> 00:30:39,244
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Lord.

537
00:30:40,985 --> 00:30:41,445
[SPEAKER_14]: That's cool.

538
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,967
[SPEAKER_14]: That's definitely an old school Sega title right there, I think.

539
00:30:44,628 --> 00:30:45,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and that's about it.

540
00:30:46,088 --> 00:30:48,750
[SPEAKER_10]: And also I've played a little bit of Spelunky.

541
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:53,113
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been playing that the past few weeks and still haven't beaten the game and I've died about 800 times.

542
00:30:53,954 --> 00:30:58,857
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one of those games that I get really frustrated at at certain times.

543
00:30:58,877 --> 00:31:00,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Just dying left and right.

544
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, fuck you, fuck you.

545
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:07,163
[SPEAKER_14]: I heard the soundtrack's really good to that because I saw something about the soundtrack is out.

546
00:31:07,223 --> 00:31:09,704
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a pay what you want thing, but as long as you pay at least $7.

547
00:31:11,165 --> 00:31:11,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's pretty good.

548
00:31:11,806 --> 00:31:17,169
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I've heard that the XBLA version is different from the original, like the PC version.

549
00:31:17,189 --> 00:31:18,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

550
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,372
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think people might like the PC version.

551
00:31:20,392 --> 00:31:21,612
[SPEAKER_10]: That might be from the PC version.

552
00:31:21,853 --> 00:31:23,554
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think people like the PC version better.

553
00:31:24,314 --> 00:31:25,795
[SPEAKER_10]: But I haven't heard the PC.

554
00:31:25,815 --> 00:31:27,777
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't tried that one yet, though, on the PC.

555
00:31:29,013 --> 00:31:29,313
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

556
00:31:30,453 --> 00:31:36,855
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, if that's it, before I go to Loki, because Loki I know has a big week we got to get into, I'm going to go next because mine's actually really quick.

557
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:41,297
[SPEAKER_14]: As far as new games go, there's really only one new game I got to try this week.

558
00:31:41,637 --> 00:31:42,897
[SPEAKER_14]: Played a lot of the same old stuff.

559
00:31:42,937 --> 00:31:45,998
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I played World of Warcraft, played some Mass Effect multiplayer and all that good stuff.

560
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:50,960
[SPEAKER_14]: One new game I tried over the weekend because it's having a free weekend is a new MMO called The Secret World.

561
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:58,521
[SPEAKER_14]: It's an MMO, obviously, and it's set a little more in the modern-day world.

562
00:31:58,581 --> 00:32:08,644
[SPEAKER_14]: It's more of a modern-day MMO with the whole zombie element to it and cyberpunk kind of a twist on it.

563
00:32:09,484 --> 00:32:10,104
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's kind of cool.

564
00:32:10,144 --> 00:32:19,766
[SPEAKER_14]: It's one of the first MMOs I've played in a very long time where I didn't sit there going, oh, this is a lot like WoW, or oh, I'm looking for the WoW influence, or oh, I see that they took this from WoW.

565
00:32:20,186 --> 00:32:25,769
[SPEAKER_14]: And keep in mind, I usually kind of have that eye because I have been playing World of Warcraft for so long and, you know, have the podcast and everything.

566
00:32:26,089 --> 00:32:28,090
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how I approach a lot of games, or MMOs.

567
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:31,011
[SPEAKER_14]: But Secret World really didn't remind me of WoW at all.

568
00:32:31,091 --> 00:32:38,935
[SPEAKER_14]: The combat was really fast-paced, which, you know, another friend of mine was playing it and it kind of irritated him, but I kind of liked the combat.

569
00:32:39,455 --> 00:32:42,697
[SPEAKER_14]: I also liked that there was no leveling.

570
00:32:43,237 --> 00:32:44,037
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

571
00:33:02,182 --> 00:33:15,433
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I mean, that was kind of fun to play, and the different environment leads way to a different set of quests and all that, and a different type of story, and yeah, I gotta say, I was feeling it, but I'm gonna tell you what I'm not feeling.

572
00:33:16,514 --> 00:33:17,114
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the price.

573
00:33:17,615 --> 00:33:20,597
[SPEAKER_14]: Because if I wanna play Beyond this weekend, I'm gonna have to pay $50 for the game.

574
00:33:21,738 --> 00:33:22,459
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

575
00:33:51,821 --> 00:34:13,152
[SPEAKER_14]: Which I understand, yes, World of Warcraft sells those mounts and those pets I've never bought one that wasn't for charity But those things also don't give you an edge in the game And I was a little put off by that And honestly, I think it's happening to every other MMO As we're going to get into later this week I think it's just a matter of time before Secret World goes free to play Or gets a price reduction So you know what?

576
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:14,473
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just going to wait until then

577
00:34:15,316 --> 00:34:20,059
[SPEAKER_14]: I did enjoy what I played of it, but if it's going to go the way of every other MMO, sorry.

578
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:29,004
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that that might give me some stink eye from developers and things like that, but I didn't love it enough to just jump on board and support it.

579
00:34:29,445 --> 00:34:30,985
[SPEAKER_14]: That's where I was with it.

580
00:34:31,446 --> 00:34:36,109
[SPEAKER_14]: And SSJ100Matt in chat says, yeah, but Rob, didn't Blizzard sell useless mounts?

581
00:34:36,189 --> 00:34:36,869
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct, they do.

582
00:34:37,289 --> 00:34:37,990
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't like it.

583
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,851
[SPEAKER_14]: I gotta admit, I don't like that they do that.

584
00:34:41,311 --> 00:34:42,232
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't buy those mounts.

585
00:34:42,252 --> 00:34:45,653
[SPEAKER_14]: I think $25 or whatever they charge for a mount, I think it's ridiculous.

586
00:34:47,354 --> 00:34:53,217
[SPEAKER_14]: However, once in a while Blizzard will put out a $10 pet where it all goes to charity or something like that.

587
00:34:53,697 --> 00:34:54,437
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm okay with that.

588
00:34:54,477 --> 00:34:55,258
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a lot different.

589
00:34:56,178 --> 00:35:01,420
[SPEAKER_14]: Those I have bought, but I've never bought a mount for the $25 or whatever.

590
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,561
[SPEAKER_14]: I just think that's a little silly.

591
00:35:03,221 --> 00:35:08,343
[SPEAKER_14]: and I also think they charge way too much for the server transfers and WoW has other pricing issues too.

592
00:35:08,623 --> 00:35:21,027
[SPEAKER_14]: The cost to enter the game right now between buying the Battle Chest, Wrath of the Lich King, Cataclysm and soon Pandaria, it's ridiculous and that's why WoW is losing subscribers but I'll get into that a little later in the show.

593
00:35:21,747 --> 00:35:36,658
[SPEAKER_14]: for now that's it for my gaming week Loki, Loki, Loki, Loki alright, so I read Twitter and I listen to this show so I know you took the day off work on Wednesday, right?

594
00:35:36,979 --> 00:35:38,540
[SPEAKER_14]: so you could stay up Tuesday night

595
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,381
[SPEAKER_14]: and DarkSakura.com.

596
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

597
00:36:24,756 --> 00:36:36,884
[SPEAKER_02]: So immediately I was greeted with, you know, the next page and they're talking about how, you know, how, you know, the third gate contest and basically, you know, here it was.

598
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:40,387
[SPEAKER_02]: So Ready Player One Easter Egg Hunt, the third gate.

599
00:36:40,447 --> 00:36:47,932
[SPEAKER_02]: To complete the third challenge in the RP1 Easter Egg Contest, you must, and this is where I was like, what?

600
00:36:48,552 --> 00:36:53,576
[SPEAKER_02]: You must set a new world record high score on one of the following classic video games.

601
00:36:55,077 --> 00:37:01,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Robotron 2084, Joust, Black Tiger, and Tempest.

602
00:37:02,863 --> 00:37:10,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, since then, they've added Joust on the Atari 2600 and Pac-Man, but all the rest are arcade versions.

603
00:37:11,189 --> 00:37:12,771
[SPEAKER_02]: So, basically...

604
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,280
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

605
00:37:29,608 --> 00:37:30,408
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

606
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:18,725
[SPEAKER_02]: and then of course it goes into a little bit detail what you need to do basically this is tied in with Twin Galaxies you have to follow their submission rules and stuff and I haven't really played around with Twin Galaxies that much because I kind of roll my eyes every time I hear about Twin Galaxies but their submissions are ridiculous basically you have to so here's the challenge number one

607
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:23,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Pick a game that you're going to somehow get the world record to.

608
00:38:23,991 --> 00:38:26,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, even before that, find an arcade.

609
00:38:28,353 --> 00:38:34,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, find an arcade that has classic games because classic games don't bring in money to arcades anymore so they don't have them anymore.

610
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:59,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Number three, find an arcade with a classic game that happens to be nearby because there's not a lot of them that's also willing to allow you to stay there for long hours and open up their arcade machine and film the inside of their arcade machine as well as you playing the game without any sort of interruptions from little kids or something jumping in the way, knocking over your camera equipment and all that other stuff.

611
00:39:00,906 --> 00:39:01,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's even before...

612
00:39:03,673 --> 00:39:04,033
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

613
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:32,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just... Here's my disappointment.

614
00:39:32,583 --> 00:39:41,629
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that, you know, he's basically saying, okay, well, this is the type of competition stuff that was in Ready Player One The Vote.

615
00:39:41,669 --> 00:39:44,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, let's back up for a second.

616
00:39:44,431 --> 00:39:47,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, the first gate was an Atari 2600 game.

617
00:39:48,033 --> 00:39:51,355
[SPEAKER_02]: An original Atari 2600 game they made specifically for this gate.

618
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:59,101
[SPEAKER_02]: That was cool, because it tied in with the game, and it was challenging, but it wasn't like, oh, my God, this is impossible to beat.

619
00:40:00,101 --> 00:40:04,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, and granted, these are all supposed to be increasing in challenge each time.

620
00:40:04,223 --> 00:40:05,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two was not a challenge at all.

621
00:40:05,604 --> 00:40:06,604
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a Facebook game.

622
00:40:06,664 --> 00:40:11,666
[SPEAKER_02]: The only challenge was my patience in playing a Facebook game that was basically pay to win.

623
00:40:11,886 --> 00:40:14,127
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to point something out, though, between that first and second gate.

624
00:40:14,187 --> 00:40:16,589
[SPEAKER_14]: That first gate, you have the classic.

625
00:40:16,629 --> 00:40:17,449
[SPEAKER_14]: You have the old.

626
00:40:17,509 --> 00:40:19,710
[SPEAKER_14]: You have the history of video games right there.

627
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:26,373
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, granted, it's not like Space War or something like that, but for all practical purposes, Atari 2600 is about as far back as most our gaming memories go.

628
00:40:26,773 --> 00:40:29,555
[SPEAKER_14]: and then for the second gate you had the most modern thing.

629
00:40:29,595 --> 00:40:32,897
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, love it or hate it, Facebook is gaming right now.

630
00:40:32,937 --> 00:40:43,584
[SPEAKER_02]: The only reason that it was tied in with it because it was Richard Garriott, the guy that was behind Ultima, a pretty classic series.

631
00:40:43,945 --> 00:40:53,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, I would have thought the Ultima MMO that they're beta testing or something like that would have been better fit for this, but whatever.

632
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook game where you collect vintage stuff.

633
00:40:57,074 --> 00:40:58,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine, but it was annoying.

634
00:40:59,096 --> 00:41:00,097
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't difficult though.

635
00:41:00,177 --> 00:41:04,322
[SPEAKER_02]: There was absolutely no skill involved in it at all other than click, click, click.

636
00:41:05,243 --> 00:41:06,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, crap, I ran out of energy.

637
00:41:07,186 --> 00:41:08,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta wait for more energy.

638
00:41:08,607 --> 00:41:09,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Click, click, click.

639
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:09,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, crap.

640
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:10,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I don't want to wait anymore.

641
00:41:10,917 --> 00:41:11,798
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to pay for more energy.

642
00:41:11,878 --> 00:41:13,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's really the only skill that was involved there.

643
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:17,181
[SPEAKER_02]: To, oh, hey, by the way, you got to set a fucking world record.

644
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:19,282
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's a little like, woof.

645
00:41:19,582 --> 00:41:21,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what the hell kind of a difficulty curve is that?

646
00:41:22,463 --> 00:41:23,744
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's a little ridiculous.

647
00:41:24,304 --> 00:41:36,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, to be fair, you know, like I said, this sort of kind of ties in with, you know, the book and, you know, how, well, you know, the main character in the book, he played a perfect game of Pac-Man and stuff like that.

648
00:41:37,511 --> 00:41:39,032
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, oh, cool, you know.

649
00:41:39,392 --> 00:41:58,167
[SPEAKER_02]: but you have to understand in the book these people were this guy leaves his fortune of billions of dollars billions of dollars and these people have to find these Easter eggs to get this vast amount of fortune so they become experts in everything 80s including playing arcade games

650
00:41:59,147 --> 00:42:00,107
[SPEAKER_02]: All of their free time.

651
00:42:00,348 --> 00:42:02,708
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're talking people just playing games.

652
00:42:03,048 --> 00:42:12,111
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason that that main character goes in the first place to an arcade museum and plays that Pac-Man machine is because he likes playing Pac-Man.

653
00:42:12,131 --> 00:42:18,312
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not because, oh shit, I gotta play this Pac-Man machine perfectly so I can get this whatever to open another gate.

654
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:20,193
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't even have anything to do with the other gate.

655
00:42:20,753 --> 00:42:22,914
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just because he enjoys playing these games.

656
00:42:22,974 --> 00:42:23,074
[SPEAKER_02]: But

657
00:42:24,054 --> 00:42:34,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, forcing people to play these arcade games and get world record, you're not targeting your audience of people that enjoy 80s stuff and read your book and like the book.

658
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,162
[SPEAKER_02]: You're targeting people that play arcade games hardcore, and that's it.

659
00:42:39,085 --> 00:42:45,172
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, let me... Since it's only a three-hour show, Loki, let me throw some tough questions at you.

660
00:42:46,073 --> 00:42:48,696
[SPEAKER_14]: Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

661
00:42:49,196 --> 00:42:51,779
[SPEAKER_14]: The guy apparently doesn't want to make it easy for someone to get his car.

662
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,321
[SPEAKER_14]: You knew it wasn't going to be easy.

663
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:56,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think it was going to be easy, but I thought it was going to be a little bit more original.

664
00:42:56,745 --> 00:42:56,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Like,

665
00:42:57,285 --> 00:43:05,972
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, let's get the guy that created, you know, fucking, I want to be the guy to create some new custom game that ties in with the series and it's fucking hard.

666
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:06,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mind that.

667
00:43:07,033 --> 00:43:12,518
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have been fair because it would have been something unique that, oh, this is challenging, but I just have to be skilled enough to do it.

668
00:43:12,698 --> 00:43:14,460
[SPEAKER_14]: The thing that, you know, and I got to say it,

669
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,502
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

670
00:43:31,201 --> 00:43:33,642
[SPEAKER_14]: is not something everybody can accomplish.

671
00:43:33,742 --> 00:43:35,242
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of an uneven playing field.

672
00:43:35,382 --> 00:43:36,762
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not even talking about gaming skill.

673
00:43:37,163 --> 00:43:46,045
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just talking about access to these games because, yeah, to find an original machine, there's only so many arcades in the nation that even have something like that.

674
00:43:46,145 --> 00:43:50,686
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you're like, you might be the most hardcore gaming fan in the world and you live in Montana.

675
00:43:51,066 --> 00:43:51,786
[SPEAKER_14]: You're fucked.

676
00:43:52,086 --> 00:43:52,847
[SPEAKER_14]: Not necessarily.

677
00:43:53,387 --> 00:43:56,568
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I don't know of any big classic gaming arcades in Montana.

678
00:43:56,628 --> 00:43:57,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Excuse me if I'm wrong.

679
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:01,169
[SPEAKER_14]: but you're going to have to find an independent game collector.

680
00:44:01,509 --> 00:44:06,410
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to have to be like John Jacobson from Video Game Outsiders who has the arcade in his basement.

681
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:07,710
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to know somebody like that.

682
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:08,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Not necessarily.

683
00:44:09,591 --> 00:44:21,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Any of those places will rent out classic games to pizza parlors, to mom and pop places, to restaurants in general, skating rinks.

684
00:44:23,014 --> 00:44:27,635
[SPEAKER_05]: The skating rink I went to in Dothan, Alabama since I was a little kid had the same damn frogger there

685
00:44:29,261 --> 00:44:34,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Even when I went as an adult, the same Frogger I played since it was brand fucking new.

686
00:44:35,187 --> 00:44:36,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying, you can find them.

687
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:51,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm not saying it's impossible, but it's not like, you know, hey, any of these challenges where it's, okay, here's the ROM or here's the game that you can play in a flash, you know, in the browser, and everybody has access to it.

688
00:44:51,061 --> 00:44:54,064
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like, okay, find arcade game and play it.

689
00:44:54,244 --> 00:44:55,065
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know...

690
00:44:57,626 --> 00:45:00,429
[SPEAKER_02]: He keeps adding more stuff to this.

691
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:06,355
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's supposed to be adding more games each week.

692
00:45:06,756 --> 00:45:08,958
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the thing too that I also don't like.

693
00:45:08,978 --> 00:45:11,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Because these rules keep getting fucking tweaked every time.

694
00:45:11,781 --> 00:45:14,403
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what shows me it wasn't thought out.

695
00:45:14,704 --> 00:45:19,368
[SPEAKER_14]: Because they're having to consistently tweak the rules because they're realizing, oh fuck, we did make this impossible.

696
00:45:20,489 --> 00:45:21,330
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's my other question for you.

697
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:26,613
[SPEAKER_14]: It seems like there's some good sportsmanship and camaraderie amongst all the people who have gone far in this competition, right?

698
00:45:26,653 --> 00:45:28,434
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, you guys are all talking to each other and stuff?

699
00:45:28,494 --> 00:45:29,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people, yeah.

700
00:45:29,074 --> 00:45:29,274
[SPEAKER_14]: Sort of?

701
00:45:29,594 --> 00:45:32,536
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, what's been the reaction overall?

702
00:45:32,636 --> 00:45:33,997
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, is everybody pissed like you?

703
00:45:34,137 --> 00:45:37,079
[SPEAKER_14]: Or are there some people that are like, alright, now this is a contest.

704
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,923
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some people that are kind of like kiss asses like that.

705
00:45:41,684 --> 00:45:42,805
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my opinion at least.

706
00:45:43,266 --> 00:45:48,292
[SPEAKER_02]: That are like, well, I think this is a perfect contest, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

707
00:45:48,372 --> 00:45:50,515
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, I'll read some examples.

708
00:45:50,555 --> 00:45:55,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Like one of the posts or whatever on Planet Lotus, which is one of the websites that's kind of dedicated to all this stuff.

709
00:45:56,682 --> 00:45:56,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

710
00:45:57,923 --> 00:46:22,545
[SPEAKER_02]: and I laughed when I saw it because it was is basically the thread topic was you've got to be kidding me and then you know the post seriously and then you know the next ones well nobody's gonna beat it tonight haha man I live in it I live in the country it's gonna be tough finding an actual working arcade I bet collector has these um arcades are gonna be bombarded and um what was it uh

711
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:24,959
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

712
00:46:40,078 --> 00:46:47,144
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what's to say they're not going to go, oh hey, I'm just going to play these really fucking easy games and cool, I got a DeLorean now too.

713
00:46:47,164 --> 00:46:49,066
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to see Billy Mitchell with a DeLorean.

714
00:46:49,246 --> 00:46:49,747
[SPEAKER_05]: End of story.

715
00:46:49,787 --> 00:46:51,488
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's exactly what's going to end up happening.

716
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:58,594
[SPEAKER_14]: I think one of the existing record holders is going to get wind of this if they haven't already and it's just going to motivate them to break their existing record and it's over.

717
00:46:58,614 --> 00:47:00,496
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it's that guy that plays with his feet though.

718
00:47:00,596 --> 00:47:01,096
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be awesome.

719
00:47:02,369 --> 00:47:03,849
[SPEAKER_02]: But, see, that's fucking lame.

720
00:47:03,969 --> 00:47:08,751
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's the other thing, too, is they've also, like I said, they keep adding and changing the rules.

721
00:47:09,251 --> 00:47:17,233
[SPEAKER_02]: They put in a thing now, well, if the third gate's not completed by October 1st, you know, check back to this page.

722
00:47:17,273 --> 00:47:19,994
[SPEAKER_02]: We may have a fourth gate, or we may just end the contest.

723
00:47:20,634 --> 00:47:21,154
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like...

724
00:47:22,927 --> 00:47:23,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

725
00:47:23,347 --> 00:47:24,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you're going to do this crap?

726
00:47:26,409 --> 00:47:29,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the problem, though, and I'm trying to make this short, but here's the problem.

727
00:47:29,711 --> 00:47:31,532
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm torn because I don't want to quit.

728
00:47:31,832 --> 00:47:33,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to quit now.

729
00:47:33,954 --> 00:47:40,197
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, I don't want to invest in the stuff that I need to in order to complete it.

730
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:42,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, I have an arcade machine at home.

731
00:47:42,839 --> 00:47:45,901
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a main cabinet, but it's an arcade machine.

732
00:47:45,961 --> 00:47:47,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I pop that computer out of there.

733
00:47:47,962 --> 00:47:48,823
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a JAMMA cabinet.

734
00:47:48,843 --> 00:47:50,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I can pop any JAMMA game in there.

735
00:47:51,323 --> 00:48:20,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to play Black Tiger there was a whole bunch of drama behind that too because there's a conspiracy that the Black Tiger machine that the guy used to complete the world record was somehow not necessarily modified maybe he didn't know it was modified but that it was a hybrid machine meaning it had some of the chips from Black Tiger and it had some of the chips from Black Dragon which is the Japanese version of the game and the Japanese version scores differently than the US version

736
00:48:20,974 --> 00:48:21,875
[SPEAKER_02]: which may have caused that.

737
00:48:21,995 --> 00:48:31,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, Twin Galaxies approved it and said, no, it's legit, but they're doing it off of video.

738
00:48:32,022 --> 00:48:35,024
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not legit, are they really going to go back and go, oh, we made a mistake?

739
00:48:35,264 --> 00:48:35,764
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

740
00:48:35,824 --> 00:48:37,305
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that they're going to at this point.

741
00:48:38,126 --> 00:48:39,087
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

742
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:54,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool, that you're into arcade games.

743
00:48:54,704 --> 00:48:55,264
[SPEAKER_15]: Where does he live?

744
00:48:56,044 --> 00:48:56,844
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no fucking clue.

745
00:48:56,985 --> 00:48:57,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I understand.

746
00:48:57,545 --> 00:48:58,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Go play at his house.

747
00:48:58,665 --> 00:49:05,588
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I'm actually thinking about buying a Black Tiger arcade board.

748
00:49:05,608 --> 00:49:06,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

749
00:49:06,688 --> 00:49:06,908
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

750
00:49:09,329 --> 00:49:15,870
[SPEAKER_02]: See, the thing is, though, is I don't want to... Black Tiger, though, like I said, the high score on it is millions... You are being such a boy right now.

751
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:20,111
[SPEAKER_14]: You are being such a boy right now where you do not want to give up on this.

752
00:49:20,171 --> 00:49:23,332
[SPEAKER_14]: You are just... I know I'm not going to stop and ask for directions.

753
00:49:24,272 --> 00:49:25,652
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to beat this, damn it.

754
00:49:27,393 --> 00:49:33,434
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you're going to get cut off at the knees by one of these guys that already holds the world record and you're going to be three times as pissed as you are tonight.

755
00:49:33,674 --> 00:49:34,134
[SPEAKER_14]: I know.

756
00:49:34,714 --> 00:49:36,535
[SPEAKER_14]: I've known you for ten plus years.

757
00:49:36,575 --> 00:49:37,755
[SPEAKER_14]: That's exactly what's going to happen.

758
00:49:38,928 --> 00:49:39,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I understand that.

759
00:49:39,788 --> 00:49:40,449
[SPEAKER_02]: That's possible.

760
00:49:40,569 --> 00:49:42,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, and then, of course, the Pac-Man world record.

761
00:49:42,049 --> 00:49:43,590
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to beat the time.

762
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:45,191
[SPEAKER_14]: We're already 50 minutes in.

763
00:49:45,391 --> 00:49:47,692
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got to bring this to a close, but I have to ask this, okay?

764
00:49:48,592 --> 00:49:51,574
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have a show following us tonight, so we can't have a marathon show tonight.

765
00:49:51,674 --> 00:49:52,654
[SPEAKER_14]: But I've got to ask this.

766
00:49:53,254 --> 00:49:53,915
[SPEAKER_14]: Twitter drama.

767
00:49:54,275 --> 00:50:04,479
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I've got to say, Loki, you were a little bit ranny pants on Twitter, and you went so far to say, fuck you, Ernie Klein, which did strike me as a little bit angry 12-year-old.

768
00:50:04,599 --> 00:50:05,680
[SPEAKER_14]: But, okay, you're mad.

769
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:06,140
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever.

770
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:06,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever.

771
00:50:07,761 --> 00:50:08,702
[SPEAKER_14]: What's going on on Twitter?

772
00:50:08,962 --> 00:50:11,004
[SPEAKER_14]: You get angry and he follows you?

773
00:50:11,804 --> 00:50:12,525
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, yeah.

774
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,187
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

775
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:22,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tweeted him before because he did a video talking about his DeLorean that he's given up.

776
00:50:23,192 --> 00:50:25,514
[SPEAKER_02]: And he misquoted himself.

777
00:50:25,574 --> 00:50:26,655
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, oh yeah, it's got 249,000 miles.

778
00:50:26,675 --> 00:50:26,915
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like...

779
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:30,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

780
00:50:44,801 --> 00:50:48,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, you've put fucking 6,000 miles on it in like a few months.

781
00:50:49,284 --> 00:50:49,765
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's the thing.

782
00:50:49,885 --> 00:50:54,408
[SPEAKER_14]: And Bobby and Chad are saying, is the Black Tiger arcade board cheaper than a tricked out DeLorean?

783
00:50:54,829 --> 00:50:56,530
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys don't understand, Loki.

784
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:59,772
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't matter at this point because now it's a thing.

785
00:51:00,293 --> 00:51:01,534
[SPEAKER_14]: It's become a thing.

786
00:51:01,954 --> 00:51:03,495
[SPEAKER_14]: And now it doesn't matter anymore, folks.

787
00:51:03,615 --> 00:51:06,097
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't matter if the value of that board is greater.

788
00:51:06,638 --> 00:51:07,258
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a thing.

789
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:10,040
[SPEAKER_14]: Am I right, Loki?

790
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:10,361
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a thing.

791
00:51:10,381 --> 00:51:10,841
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a thing.

792
00:51:12,182 --> 00:51:12,982
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to win.

793
00:51:13,643 --> 00:51:13,923
[SPEAKER_14]: See?

794
00:51:17,505 --> 00:51:18,585
[SPEAKER_14]: That's exactly it.

795
00:51:20,466 --> 00:51:24,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Personally, I would want to try Robotron, but finding a Williams machine is like near impossible.

796
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:37,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so... Other things, I played Minecraft, I played Call of Duty, and... Oh, I did play Black Tiger a little bit, because that's what I did that night when I got pissed off.

797
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,061
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, fuck this shit.

798
00:51:39,161 --> 00:51:43,623
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to boot up my cabinet and play Black Tiger a little bit, because I haven't really played that.

799
00:51:43,963 --> 00:51:44,964
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the other thing, too.

800
00:51:45,024 --> 00:51:47,685
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to grade this world record, I think a lot of these people will do it.

801
00:51:47,865 --> 00:51:49,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't just say, I just want to hold the world record.

802
00:51:50,386 --> 00:51:51,647
[SPEAKER_02]: They enjoy playing that game.

803
00:51:51,887 --> 00:51:53,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't enjoy playing Black Tiger.

804
00:51:54,068 --> 00:51:54,248
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

805
00:51:55,444 --> 00:51:55,744
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

806
00:51:55,824 --> 00:51:56,765
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what they add.

807
00:51:56,885 --> 00:51:57,325
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

808
00:51:57,345 --> 00:52:01,427
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not really... I don't think... All of them are going to be breaking world records, so I don't think anyone's going to do it.

809
00:52:01,467 --> 00:52:12,373
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest, he said so far, he has four... Because one of the first things you have to do is you take a picture of the machine that you're going to attempt the thing on, and you send them also your pictures that you took for the first two gates.

810
00:52:12,993 --> 00:52:25,159
[SPEAKER_02]: He's had... There's almost 1,200 people that passed the first gate, 725 that passed the second gate, five that have emailed him a picture for the third gate so far that even say they're attempting...

811
00:52:25,424 --> 00:52:27,925
[SPEAKER_14]: GameGuru says just buy the damn DeLorean.

812
00:52:28,106 --> 00:52:28,346
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope.

813
00:52:28,706 --> 00:52:29,366
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, buddy.

814
00:52:29,586 --> 00:52:30,227
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a thing.

815
00:52:30,827 --> 00:52:31,548
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what you're missing.

816
00:52:31,948 --> 00:52:33,769
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not about the DeLorean anymore.

817
00:52:34,029 --> 00:52:34,890
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the problem.

818
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:37,211
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a manual DeLorean.

819
00:52:37,331 --> 00:52:41,013
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a manual car that sucks gas.

820
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:42,274
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't even drive a manual.

821
00:52:42,314 --> 00:52:43,335
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't drive a manual.

822
00:52:43,355 --> 00:52:43,695
[SPEAKER_02]: God damn you.

823
00:52:43,715 --> 00:52:47,917
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks gas, and it can only be repaired in Southern California.

824
00:52:49,338 --> 00:52:51,359
[SPEAKER_14]: But you still want it.

825
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:52,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

826
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:52,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

827
00:52:54,929 --> 00:52:58,711
[SPEAKER_05]: That's gotta be the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life.

828
00:52:59,051 --> 00:52:59,611
[SPEAKER_14]: It is him.

829
00:53:01,452 --> 00:53:02,773
[SPEAKER_14]: You are... Buy one!

830
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:04,553
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll spend less money.

831
00:53:05,274 --> 00:53:05,774
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I won't.

832
00:53:05,934 --> 00:53:08,715
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, how long have you known this man?

833
00:53:09,075 --> 00:53:10,016
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not gonna get it.

834
00:53:10,076 --> 00:53:11,076
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not the answer.

835
00:53:11,216 --> 00:53:12,037
[SPEAKER_04]: No one's gonna win it.

836
00:53:12,237 --> 00:53:14,638
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to give away my DeLorean anyway, man.

837
00:53:16,047 --> 00:53:17,689
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we're talking in circles.

838
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,052
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?

839
00:53:21,093 --> 00:53:22,675
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to win so I can punch him in the face.

840
00:53:25,418 --> 00:53:26,440
[SPEAKER_14]: You are so mature.

841
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:32,327
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for exuding the maturity that hosts of this show should have all over the internet.

842
00:53:32,347 --> 00:53:33,388
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck you, Ernie Klein.

843
00:53:33,868 --> 00:53:34,689
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you're following me?

844
00:53:34,769 --> 00:53:35,070
[SPEAKER_14]: Shit.

845
00:53:37,785 --> 00:53:39,185
[SPEAKER_14]: Actdeft is right, it's time for an intervention

846
00:54:02,902 --> 00:54:04,944
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like I'm walking on sunshine.

847
00:54:05,225 --> 00:54:07,567
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just frustrating, okay?

848
00:54:07,807 --> 00:54:09,929
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like I've put this much effort into it so far.

849
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:13,954
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to quit right now, even though it's ridiculous.

850
00:54:14,894 --> 00:54:15,735
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ridiculous.

851
00:54:16,376 --> 00:54:22,502
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, playing a 2600 game, playing a Facebook game, world record!

852
00:54:22,803 --> 00:54:25,185
[SPEAKER_05]: We got passed by something cooler than a DeLorean last night.

853
00:54:27,099 --> 00:54:30,483
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

854
00:54:47,541 --> 00:54:49,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Fencer because it has fucking swords in it.

855
00:54:49,862 --> 00:54:51,223
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes perfect sense.

856
00:54:51,523 --> 00:54:53,644
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to really narrow down your fan base.

857
00:54:53,664 --> 00:54:54,645
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to bring the one ring.

858
00:54:54,865 --> 00:54:58,807
[SPEAKER_14]: And Loki will be the chick from South Korea that's sitting on the platform crying.

859
00:55:01,543 --> 00:55:02,423
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how this ends.

860
00:55:02,623 --> 00:55:04,945
[SPEAKER_02]: I am almost considering... Let me put it this way.

861
00:55:04,965 --> 00:55:06,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not putting much effort into this right now.

862
00:55:08,447 --> 00:55:24,417
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not buying a Black Tiger arcade board right now, but I'm just saying I will play it casually, and if I see that, okay, look, I figured out something that no one else has figured out on it, and I can get a high score that can beat the world record, then sure, yes, I will do all that and film all that stuff.

863
00:55:24,437 --> 00:55:25,218
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time...

864
00:55:27,179 --> 00:55:29,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I just don't have the time.

865
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:31,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the time to do this.

866
00:55:34,283 --> 00:55:39,286
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, you just played 67 hours of joust in an attempt to win a used car.

867
00:55:39,366 --> 00:55:40,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's another thing.

868
00:55:40,887 --> 00:55:41,268
[SPEAKER_14]: 67 hours!

869
00:55:41,508 --> 00:55:43,169
[SPEAKER_14]: Who the fuck's gonna do that?

870
00:55:43,949 --> 00:55:48,592
[SPEAKER_14]: You just played 67 hours of joust in an attempt to win a used car.

871
00:55:48,692 --> 00:55:49,553
[SPEAKER_14]: How do you feel?

872
00:55:49,573 --> 00:55:51,574
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm walking on sunshine.

873
00:55:54,508 --> 00:55:54,789
[SPEAKER_02]: 67 hours?

874
00:55:54,909 --> 00:55:57,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's how long it takes for Joust.

875
00:55:58,451 --> 00:55:58,651
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

876
00:56:01,813 --> 00:56:04,334
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, it's a historical night here at VOG Network.

877
00:56:05,235 --> 00:56:07,777
[SPEAKER_14]: www.vognetwork.com The Voice.

878
00:56:08,157 --> 00:56:16,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Twin Galaxies wanted to remind everybody that if you do break the world record before September 5th, you get to be in the Guinness Book this year of gaming.

879
00:56:17,242 --> 00:56:20,144
[SPEAKER_14]: Speaking of Twin Galaxies, let's talk about space.

880
00:56:20,304 --> 00:56:21,105
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I talk about space?

881
00:56:21,325 --> 00:56:21,785
[SPEAKER_14]: Talking about space.

882
00:56:21,865 --> 00:56:22,366
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, space.

883
00:56:22,426 --> 00:56:22,746
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm in space.

884
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:24,527
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you the best at space?

885
00:56:24,667 --> 00:56:24,867
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

886
00:56:25,327 --> 00:56:28,028
[SPEAKER_14]: No, Travis Donovan tonight at VOG Network is the best at space.

887
00:56:28,328 --> 00:56:34,051
[SPEAKER_14]: He is going to be hosting live after our program tonight, the Mars Curiosity Landing Special.

888
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:40,274
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, for those that don't know, the thing they shot in space, like how long ago was that?

889
00:56:40,294 --> 00:56:42,195
[SPEAKER_14]: It was probably almost like seven years ago at this point.

890
00:56:42,235 --> 00:56:43,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Nine, nine, nine, nine, nine.

891
00:56:44,316 --> 00:56:44,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

892
00:56:44,556 --> 00:56:45,176
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it was that day?

893
00:56:46,852 --> 00:56:47,012
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

894
00:56:47,992 --> 00:56:48,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Portal reference.

895
00:56:49,413 --> 00:56:50,113
[SPEAKER_14]: You have issues.

896
00:56:50,173 --> 00:56:50,413
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

897
00:56:50,834 --> 00:56:55,015
[SPEAKER_14]: So they shot this guy into space, and it's landing on Mars tonight.

898
00:56:55,075 --> 00:56:58,096
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's happening late at night, like 1.30 a.m.

899
00:56:58,176 --> 00:56:59,757
[SPEAKER_14]: in the morning Eastern Coast time.

900
00:57:00,057 --> 00:57:02,418
[SPEAKER_14]: But Travis Donovan, he loves his NASA.

901
00:57:02,658 --> 00:57:03,958
[SPEAKER_14]: He loves his space program.

902
00:57:04,178 --> 00:57:04,899
[SPEAKER_14]: And God bless him.

903
00:57:04,939 --> 00:57:12,001
[SPEAKER_14]: He's going to stay up late tonight to talk about what this all means and go over the live landing with all of you guys.

904
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:13,742
[SPEAKER_14]: And kind of, I mean, for some people...

905
00:57:14,102 --> 00:57:15,844
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

906
00:57:36,381 --> 00:57:39,043
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what he plans to do as far as archive and all that stuff.

907
00:57:39,384 --> 00:57:39,884
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm hoping.

908
00:57:39,944 --> 00:57:45,069
[SPEAKER_14]: Just stay tuned to VOGnetwork.com if you can't listen live tonight and there will be something later on.

909
00:57:45,369 --> 00:57:48,471
[SPEAKER_14]: But if you do participate live tonight, there's special loot in it for you.

910
00:57:48,952 --> 00:57:49,732
[SPEAKER_14]: So check that out.

911
00:57:49,973 --> 00:57:52,975
[SPEAKER_14]: The Mars Curiosity starts at 10 p.m.

912
00:57:53,075 --> 00:57:54,576
[SPEAKER_14]: Pacific, 1 a.m.

913
00:57:54,697 --> 00:57:55,818
[SPEAKER_14]: Eastern thereabouts.

914
00:57:55,938 --> 00:58:01,082
[SPEAKER_14]: He's probably just going to take over when we go off air tonight, which at the rate we're going will be around 1 a.m.

915
00:58:01,162 --> 00:58:01,903
[SPEAKER_14]: Eastern time.

916
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:03,844
[SPEAKER_05]: How about we just continue?

917
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:05,844
[SPEAKER_14]: How about we get into some gaming news?

918
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:09,385
[SPEAKER_14]: Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio, Twitter.com slash OLR.

919
00:58:09,706 --> 00:58:12,166
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations, Critical Myth, on your 200th episode.

920
00:58:12,987 --> 00:58:15,187
[SPEAKER_14]: That is also something that's going on at VOG Network this week.

921
00:58:15,307 --> 00:58:15,948
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll make you a logo.

922
00:58:17,908 --> 00:58:19,529
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't go with the papyrus thing right now.

923
00:58:19,869 --> 00:58:22,330
[SPEAKER_14]: Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 4 p.m.

924
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:23,730
[SPEAKER_14]: Pacific, 7 p.m.

925
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:24,170
[SPEAKER_14]: Eastern.

926
00:58:24,491 --> 00:58:26,691
[SPEAKER_14]: Dark Sakura will make you a new logo as a present.

927
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:28,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I will make you a new logo for free.

928
00:58:30,582 --> 00:58:30,782
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

929
00:58:31,903 --> 00:58:33,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Papyrus is the devil.

930
00:58:33,584 --> 00:58:34,944
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop.

931
00:58:34,964 --> 00:58:35,985
[SPEAKER_14]: Be respectful of everybody.

932
00:58:36,005 --> 00:58:38,967
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm respectful, but Papyrus... You're being generous.

933
00:58:39,247 --> 00:58:39,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm being generous.

934
00:58:40,107 --> 00:58:41,328
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm saving you from yourself.

935
00:58:41,348 --> 00:58:42,248
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to understand, this is 2012.

936
00:58:42,288 --> 00:58:45,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Papyrus is the new Comic Sans.

937
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:45,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

938
00:58:47,651 --> 00:58:48,271
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't matter.

939
00:58:48,311 --> 00:58:49,192
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not about that.

940
00:58:49,252 --> 00:58:54,393
[SPEAKER_14]: It's about the in-depth, and I mean in-depth, television critiques that they do every week.

941
00:58:54,413 --> 00:58:56,014
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're very mindful about spoilers.

942
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,334
[SPEAKER_14]: They're very good about all of that.

943
00:58:57,754 --> 00:58:58,374
[SPEAKER_14]: So check it out.

944
00:58:59,055 --> 00:59:00,495
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't even know what they have planned.

945
00:59:00,535 --> 00:59:03,156
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently there's a special guest coming on for the 200th episode.

946
00:59:03,496 --> 00:59:04,236
[SPEAKER_14]: That's going to be awesome.

947
00:59:04,276 --> 00:59:07,998
[SPEAKER_14]: That starts tomorrow night at VOG Network, Monday, 4 o'clock Pacific, 7 o'clock Eastern.

948
00:59:08,358 --> 00:59:12,499
[SPEAKER_14]: Congrats, you guys, on your 200th episode, even if Jamie would like to question your font choices.

949
00:59:13,482 --> 00:59:13,882
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

950
00:59:14,743 --> 00:59:15,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations to them.

951
00:59:18,246 --> 00:59:21,789
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, Papyrus is like crack cocaine.

952
00:59:22,089 --> 00:59:22,669
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, it's fine.

953
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:25,472
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it may look pretty, but it's really bad for you.

954
00:59:25,632 --> 00:59:28,734
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm gonna make an Orange Lounge radio logo in Comic Sans and see how that goes over.

955
00:59:28,754 --> 00:59:30,456
[SPEAKER_05]: You do that, and I will judge you forever.

956
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:32,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, gaming news!

957
00:59:33,478 --> 00:59:34,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeez!

958
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:35,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

959
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:37,622
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Star Wars The Elder Republic's going free-to-play.

960
00:59:38,682 --> 00:59:39,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, well...

961
00:59:41,124 --> 00:59:44,546
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll transition to a hybrid free-to-play, is what they're calling it.

962
00:59:45,066 --> 00:59:50,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, they're going to allow a major portion of the game to be free, including the first 50 levels in all eight classes.

963
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:55,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, there's going to be restrictions and microtransactions to go with that.

964
00:59:56,273 --> 01:00:01,657
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do subscribe to the game, you will be given currency each month called cartel coins.

965
01:00:01,697 --> 01:00:04,738
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy customized gear and other items.

966
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:10,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, you'll get other special rewards if you're a different subscriber.

967
01:00:11,262 --> 01:00:16,946
[SPEAKER_02]: They basically said that they want to give people flexibility.

968
01:00:16,986 --> 01:00:20,248
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to do a subscription, you can do that.

969
01:00:20,368 --> 01:00:23,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, you can not.

970
01:00:24,731 --> 01:00:29,975
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, apparently, the numbers have been dipping a little bit.

971
01:00:31,176 --> 01:00:32,657
[SPEAKER_02]: The people who actually subscribe to it.

972
01:00:33,037 --> 01:00:34,598
[SPEAKER_02]: They've sold 2 million copies.

973
01:00:34,818 --> 01:00:39,001
[SPEAKER_02]: However, right now, there's only less than a million people actually playing.

974
01:00:40,706 --> 01:00:42,867
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's not very good.

975
01:00:42,887 --> 01:00:45,349
[SPEAKER_14]: There's tons of people playing for it who aren't paying for it.

976
01:00:45,489 --> 01:00:48,091
[SPEAKER_14]: Or are they doing that whole free... Isn't it already free to play?

977
01:00:48,131 --> 01:00:49,211
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you say playing for it?

978
01:00:49,432 --> 01:00:49,692
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever.

979
01:00:50,152 --> 01:00:50,973
[SPEAKER_14]: Free to play to level 15 or 20?

980
01:00:51,073 --> 01:00:51,713
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's below 20.

981
01:00:51,753 --> 01:00:52,133
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that.

982
01:00:52,173 --> 01:00:52,794
[SPEAKER_02]: It's either 10 or 15.

983
01:00:58,457 --> 01:01:03,581
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think free-to-play will definitely help their numbers, so that's kind of cool.

984
01:01:03,761 --> 01:01:11,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I just think that a lot of people maybe didn't like the game, and so they just stopped playing.

985
01:01:11,146 --> 01:01:12,447
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not necessarily that they're so painful.

986
01:01:12,467 --> 01:01:13,067
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not Mass Effect.

987
01:01:13,968 --> 01:01:16,889
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's a really good single player game.

988
01:01:17,349 --> 01:01:21,571
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think there was enough cutting edge content for the multiplayer was the problem.

989
01:01:22,191 --> 01:01:29,273
[SPEAKER_14]: And for me, PvP ran really sluggish and I have a pretty high end computer so it made it a lot less fun to play.

990
01:01:29,393 --> 01:01:34,295
[SPEAKER_14]: I liked a lot of ideas in the game and the storytelling was done really well.

991
01:01:35,035 --> 01:01:40,182
[SPEAKER_14]: But I just think it was a game that had about three months worth of content.

992
01:01:40,603 --> 01:01:42,365
[SPEAKER_14]: That's about how long it lasted, unfortunately.

993
01:01:42,926 --> 01:01:46,911
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a tough, highly competitive marketplace right now.

994
01:01:48,513 --> 01:01:51,457
[SPEAKER_14]: I think people give too much credit to the fact that it's Star Wars.

995
01:01:52,337 --> 01:02:20,254
[SPEAKER_14]: it doesn't matter folks that's what gets that's what will draw people in for that first taste that and the fact that it's Bioware and that Knights of the Old Republic has a good history behind it that's what draws people in but it ain't gonna make people stay and I think people put way too much stock into this just because it's Star Wars it's not like everything Star Wars related has always been golden cough cough Christmas special cough cough prequels right true

996
01:02:22,583 --> 01:02:24,304
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, yeah, Star Wars is a great movie.

997
01:02:24,364 --> 01:02:28,066
[SPEAKER_14]: The original Disney trilogy.

998
01:02:28,246 --> 01:02:28,566
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

999
01:02:29,726 --> 01:02:32,268
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to piggyback on this real quick before I go into the next story.

1000
01:02:32,348 --> 01:02:33,528
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you hear about World of Warcraft?

1001
01:02:33,728 --> 01:02:36,029
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's not like things are all roses over there either.

1002
01:02:36,049 --> 01:02:37,570
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard that their numbers are dropping too.

1003
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:40,912
[SPEAKER_14]: Their numbers dropped to 9.1 million as reported at the...

1004
01:02:42,012 --> 01:02:42,753
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, boo-hoo.

1005
01:02:42,853 --> 01:02:43,953
[SPEAKER_14]: Expectations this week.

1006
01:02:44,334 --> 01:02:59,883
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, for a game that had 12 million subscribers, that is supposedly at the pinnacle shining MMO, a 25% loss, which is what that essentially equates to gradually over the past year, that is something that makes investors go, oh, really?

1007
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:00,964
[SPEAKER_14]: The game is kind of expensive.

1008
01:03:00,984 --> 01:03:02,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait till Pandaria, then.

1009
01:03:02,865 --> 01:03:19,999
[SPEAKER_14]: the biggest problem with World of Warcraft and I've said this until I am blue in the face on a horde house and Blizzard Activision pulled your head out of your ass on this I swear to god this is what's holding the game back and I don't know why they can't see it the cost to enter the game is too big

1010
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:47,937
[SPEAKER_14]: every other game consolidates the expansions into the original game at some point Warcraft has done it once with what's going on a fifth expansion that's unacceptable it's not working I realize they put the expansions on sale once in a great while I'm sorry if that sale is not sitting on the target shelf you're not going to draw in new players it is time for them to consolidate Wrath of the Lich King and Cataclysm into the original battle chest sell it for $19.99 or you will never

1011
01:03:50,399 --> 01:03:51,459
[SPEAKER_14]: Get more subscribers.

1012
01:03:51,499 --> 01:03:54,180
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happens if you don't have those expansions?

1013
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you just not get the play?

1014
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:56,300
[SPEAKER_14]: You play to level 65.

1015
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:59,181
[SPEAKER_14]: You play to level 70.

1016
01:03:59,481 --> 01:04:01,201
[SPEAKER_14]: Because Burning Crusade is included now.

1017
01:04:01,261 --> 01:04:01,982
[SPEAKER_14]: They finally did that.

1018
01:04:02,002 --> 01:04:03,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, when I started Burning Crusade wasn't.

1019
01:04:04,002 --> 01:04:05,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, when I went back, Burning Crusade wasn't.

1020
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:07,083
[SPEAKER_14]: No, that was more of a recent change.

1021
01:04:07,103 --> 01:04:07,763
[SPEAKER_14]: I bought them all.

1022
01:04:08,423 --> 01:04:10,423
[SPEAKER_14]: But, I mean, it sucks that you had to do that.

1023
01:04:10,623 --> 01:04:13,364
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, it takes a special kind of crazy to do that.

1024
01:04:13,604 --> 01:04:17,756
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I've found places that sold everything for less than retail.

1025
01:04:18,859 --> 01:04:20,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Not much less than retail, but less than retail.

1026
01:04:21,346 --> 01:04:21,907
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you fries.

1027
01:04:23,342 --> 01:04:28,887
[SPEAKER_14]: But still, I mean, you know, if they really want to attract new subscribers, $19.99 for the game.

1028
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:34,793
[SPEAKER_14]: But for some reason, sell $19.99 for the base game and then charge for the Mists of Pandaria expansion or whatever.

1029
01:04:34,873 --> 01:04:38,716
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, the reason why it's not working is people want to play with their friends.

1030
01:04:39,077 --> 01:04:42,660
[SPEAKER_14]: And they have this whole recruit a friend program that will get you to level 80 real quick.

1031
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:46,543
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't get to level 80 without buying at least the first expansion.

1032
01:04:47,124 --> 01:04:47,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello?

1033
01:04:48,605 --> 01:05:13,006
[SPEAKER_14]: there's a total logic fail going on here and they need to fix it so Ragenator in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says well 9 million plus subscribers is still respectable it is that's why this isn't quite the doom and gloom I mean show me another MMO that's anywhere close to that that's not called lineage let me rephrase show me one in the states that's anywhere near close to that level of hysteria that World of Warcraft is

1034
01:05:16,076 --> 01:05:18,778
[SPEAKER_14]: Panaxium in our chatroom says, I was going to play with a friend.

1035
01:05:19,078 --> 01:05:20,499
[SPEAKER_14]: He saw all he had to buy.

1036
01:05:20,679 --> 01:05:21,780
[SPEAKER_14]: We played something else.

1037
01:05:23,241 --> 01:05:24,702
[SPEAKER_14]: My point exactly.

1038
01:05:25,122 --> 01:05:25,663
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly.

1039
01:05:25,703 --> 01:05:27,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's what I did.

1040
01:05:27,684 --> 01:05:29,986
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, and you know this.

1041
01:05:30,366 --> 01:05:34,729
[SPEAKER_05]: I had already had Burning Crusade like early on because I did play it back in the day.

1042
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:42,215
[SPEAKER_05]: But I played all the way up until I hit level 70 and then that night I went out and got Wrath of the Lich King.

1043
01:05:43,886 --> 01:06:04,857
[SPEAKER_14]: and all you were doing with these expansions was paying to level you don't even I mean that's what Blizzard doesn't get nobody is running the old raids anymore hello except us well because we're doing them because they're fun it's a little different and you're doing them with over leveled characters which is really fun because I like you know overkill

1044
01:06:05,959 --> 01:06:35,366
[SPEAKER_05]: but I mean you know I did my I actually got 1 to 85 pretty much by myself except for saying hey Rob help me kill this guy well it's nice that you can solo so much of the content you know yeah there is a lot of it that you can solo and you can go in and go back and do other quests low level quests and get more of the story which is what I was doing for the longest time alright I don't want to turn this into the Warcraft podcast but I will close with this comment from our chat room live.vognetwork.com I wouldn't want to compete with Horde House

1045
01:06:35,946 --> 01:06:38,968
[SPEAKER_14]: SSJ100 Matt says, Blizzard needs a rude awakening.

1046
01:06:39,068 --> 01:06:44,312
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Diablo 3 was the start, but they won't change their tactics without getting hit in the pocketbooks.

1047
01:06:44,833 --> 01:06:50,797
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree with you with 90% of that statement that I would change the word Blizzard to Activision.

1048
01:06:51,277 --> 01:06:52,618
[SPEAKER_14]: And now I agree with that statement.

1049
01:06:52,958 --> 01:06:53,399
[SPEAKER_14]: Think about it.

1050
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:56,921
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything started going downhill when?

1051
01:06:58,282 --> 01:06:58,723
[SPEAKER_14]: Think about it.

1052
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:02,344
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, moving on with other gaming news.

1053
01:07:02,424 --> 01:07:05,505
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully this won't be downhill for Nintendo because that could be bad.

1054
01:07:05,645 --> 01:07:14,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Nintendo needs the Wii U to be successful this holiday season and we may have some of the details thanks to an apparent GameStop leak.

1055
01:07:17,074 --> 01:07:17,855
[SPEAKER_14]: See, here's the thing.

1056
01:07:17,995 --> 01:07:18,755
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm reporting this.

1057
01:07:18,915 --> 01:07:19,976
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't write the news.

1058
01:07:20,396 --> 01:07:26,038
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm reporting this, bringing it up for discussion because it's circulating all the blogs out there.

1059
01:07:26,378 --> 01:07:28,379
[SPEAKER_14]: I kind of don't think this is news, personally.

1060
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:30,300
[SPEAKER_14]: But I want to get your thought.

1061
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:31,781
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, here's the deal.

1062
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:38,645
[SPEAKER_14]: GameStop apparently got marketing materials for the Wii U that talk about what games are going to come out when.

1063
01:07:38,885 --> 01:07:42,908
[SPEAKER_14]: And it outlines all of the different publishers and when the games are coming out.

1064
01:07:43,348 --> 01:07:46,130
[SPEAKER_14]: And for example, the first party stuff from Nintendo.

1065
01:07:46,631 --> 01:07:48,672
[SPEAKER_14]: Lego City Undercover, holiday.

1066
01:07:49,012 --> 01:07:49,993
[SPEAKER_14]: New Super Mario Bros.

1067
01:07:50,133 --> 01:07:50,913
[SPEAKER_14]: U, holiday.

1068
01:07:51,214 --> 01:07:53,175
[SPEAKER_14]: Ninja Gaiden 3 Razor's Edge, holiday.

1069
01:07:53,415 --> 01:07:54,636
[SPEAKER_14]: Nintendo Land, holiday.

1070
01:07:54,916 --> 01:07:55,957
[SPEAKER_14]: Sing, holiday.

1071
01:07:56,457 --> 01:08:08,920
[SPEAKER_14]: Wii U, Panorama View, I didn't even know about that one, Holiday, Game and Wario, Launch Window, Pikmin 3, Launch Window, Project P100, Launch Window, and Wii Fit U, Launch Window.

1072
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:09,920
[SPEAKER_14]: What's that tell us?

1073
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:10,900
[SPEAKER_14]: Not a lot.

1074
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:12,620
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't tell us dates.

1075
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:18,461
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't tell us which of those games will be available on the actual day and which ones are closer to December 25th.

1076
01:08:18,802 --> 01:08:25,103
[SPEAKER_14]: But I mean, it's not like there's going to be that much time between the time this system releases and Christmas anyway.

1077
01:08:25,523 --> 01:08:25,723
[SPEAKER_14]: So

1078
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:33,012
[SPEAKER_14]: And I kind of was like, I thought we already knew if you listen to the way they delivered that keynote.

1079
01:08:33,452 --> 01:08:38,659
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought we already knew Pikmin 3 will be out the same day as the Wii U. We know that.

1080
01:08:40,487 --> 01:08:43,909
[SPEAKER_14]: WeFitU, I think we had a good feeling was going to hit that same day too.

1081
01:08:44,010 --> 01:08:45,791
[SPEAKER_14]: And we kind of knew Super Mario Bros.

1082
01:08:45,851 --> 01:08:46,571
[SPEAKER_04]: U. WeFitU where?

1083
01:08:47,012 --> 01:08:47,232
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

1084
01:08:47,492 --> 01:08:48,253
[SPEAKER_04]: WeFitU where?

1085
01:08:48,553 --> 01:08:49,193
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what it's called.

1086
01:08:49,513 --> 01:08:50,474
[SPEAKER_14]: And New Super Mario Bros.

1087
01:08:50,614 --> 01:08:51,975
[SPEAKER_14]: U was coming out after that.

1088
01:08:52,155 --> 01:08:53,576
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe Reggie said all that.

1089
01:08:53,856 --> 01:09:00,421
[SPEAKER_14]: The only surprise of this whole thing, Nintendo Land is marked Holiday.

1090
01:09:00,581 --> 01:09:05,245
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the only thing that surprised me because I think Nintendo Land, I thought, was going to be like a pack-in game.

1091
01:09:05,845 --> 01:09:06,706
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to hear something funny?

1092
01:09:06,746 --> 01:09:07,146
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, what?

1093
01:09:08,639 --> 01:09:17,488
[SPEAKER_02]: That list was released on June 6th during E3 by Nintendo.

1094
01:09:18,008 --> 01:09:19,770
[SPEAKER_14]: So these things have changed.

1095
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:23,393
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that list is exactly what they released.

1096
01:09:24,174 --> 01:09:25,195
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no news here.

1097
01:09:25,395 --> 01:09:28,518
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all the announced titles.

1098
01:09:31,274 --> 01:09:35,256
[SPEAKER_14]: but yet everybody's GameStop just leaked the entire Wii U lineup.

1099
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:40,918
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they didn't because Nintendo already leaked their fucking lineup a long time ago.

1100
01:09:40,999 --> 01:09:47,942
[SPEAKER_02]: I can link everybody to the wonderful, you know, because I knew I recognized that list and yep, it's exact.

1101
01:09:49,122 --> 01:09:51,403
[SPEAKER_14]: August 2nd, all over the interwebs.

1102
01:09:51,963 --> 01:09:52,524
[SPEAKER_14]: Check that out.

1103
01:09:53,164 --> 01:09:53,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1104
01:09:54,942 --> 01:10:04,419
[SPEAKER_14]: Only, only I shouldn't say only in this industry because this shit happens all the time but only in this industry can two month old news be made news all over again.

1105
01:10:05,518 --> 01:10:05,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

1106
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:17,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let me go back and tell you about things that aren't on the list because, you know, that's always fun since, you know, we, we, you know.

1107
01:10:17,708 --> 01:10:19,450
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's get you while you're in a mood tonight.

1108
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:22,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying, you know, we talked about this a few weeks and here's the other thing too.

1109
01:10:24,854 --> 01:10:29,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, there's some publishers that aren't on here like Disney Interactive because there's certain titles they...

1110
01:10:29,338 --> 01:10:35,824
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't announced yet that our Wii U titles that are coming, but they haven't officially announced it yet.

1111
01:10:36,624 --> 01:10:38,266
[SPEAKER_14]: Was that because they're 2013 at this point?

1112
01:10:38,486 --> 01:10:38,586
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1113
01:10:41,388 --> 01:10:43,951
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how we know when we, that's how I think I know.

1114
01:10:43,971 --> 01:10:45,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Wreck-It Ralph's going to be Wii U, isn't it?

1115
01:10:45,972 --> 01:10:46,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

1116
01:10:46,453 --> 01:10:46,533
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1117
01:10:47,782 --> 01:11:07,037
[SPEAKER_02]: EpicMinky2 is oh yeah I remember that and then of course you know also this list is not accurate too because they you know they just talked about Madden 13 and also FIFA 13 are going to be launch titles that are going to be on the Wii U so like this is all this right here I can tell you right now just looking at it

1118
01:11:08,238 --> 01:11:14,222
[SPEAKER_02]: If I were to guess, I would say that this is a merchandising manual from Nintendo.

1119
01:11:16,504 --> 01:11:20,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people that may be privy to kind of stuff like that.

1120
01:11:21,408 --> 01:11:30,374
[SPEAKER_02]: But that would be my guess where this leak came from because I think that they deliver this stuff to these stores that kind of informs them of the lineup and what kind of stuff that they can look forward to.

1121
01:11:30,954 --> 01:11:59,793
[SPEAKER_02]: and they also give them bullet points to talk to with their customers about that stuff it's basically to inform the people that work there about the titles that are coming out and stuff all things Nintendo because if you look at this they have Nintendo DSi product information Nintendo DS product information Nintendo 3DS product information connectivity and policies warnings and disclaimers so it's from Nintendo but it's just the stuff that was all the announced titles from E3

1122
01:12:00,592 --> 01:12:05,215
[SPEAKER_14]: Actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says the internet has really low memory spans.

1123
01:12:05,296 --> 01:12:06,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Ain't that the truth?

1124
01:12:07,257 --> 01:12:14,702
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, it's cool that certain websites can run with it because GameStop posted it.

1125
01:12:14,722 --> 01:12:15,503
[SPEAKER_02]: It must be legit.

1126
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:17,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's move on with some more news.

1127
01:12:17,605 --> 01:12:18,125
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura.

1128
01:12:19,915 --> 01:12:21,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I have some news.

1129
01:12:21,697 --> 01:12:22,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what?

1130
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:26,602
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about stuff we already know about, but I'm going to talk about it because it's fucking hilarious.

1131
01:12:27,923 --> 01:12:31,126
[SPEAKER_05]: EA is suing Zynga.

1132
01:12:33,048 --> 01:12:38,293
[SPEAKER_05]: They filed a lawsuit against Zynga saying that The Ville is a blatant ripoff of The Sims Social.

1133
01:12:39,394 --> 01:12:50,602
[SPEAKER_05]: and it was filed on August 3rd, 2012 saying that they willfully and intentionally quote, copied and misappropriated the original and distinctive expressive elements of the SimSocial in the violation of U.S.

1134
01:12:50,622 --> 01:12:51,262
[SPEAKER_05]: copyright laws.

1135
01:12:52,443 --> 01:12:56,766
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically it's like, you know, I'm going to paraphrase as I understand it.

1136
01:12:57,946 --> 01:13:03,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Zynga's gotten away with a lot of shit against a bunch of people who really can't pay to go against them.

1137
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:04,671
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got money.

1138
01:13:05,111 --> 01:13:05,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do it.

1139
01:13:06,352 --> 01:13:06,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Bitches.

1140
01:13:11,109 --> 01:13:12,311
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the plaintiff.

1141
01:13:14,233 --> 01:13:22,784
[SPEAKER_14]: EA claims that the defendant willfully and rootfully copied all of the assets from their popular game, The Sims Social.

1142
01:13:24,554 --> 01:13:25,294
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna add this.

1143
01:13:25,654 --> 01:13:26,755
[SPEAKER_14]: They're suing for $4,000.

1144
01:13:26,815 --> 01:13:32,717
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a quote that's by the EA Maxis label manager, Lucy Bradshaw.

1145
01:13:33,417 --> 01:13:34,557
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a case of principle.

1146
01:13:34,617 --> 01:13:43,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Maxis isn't the first studio to claim that Zynga copied its creative product, but we are the studio that has the financial and corporate resources to stand up and do something about it.

1147
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:47,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Infringing on a developer's copyright is not an acceptable practice in game development.

1148
01:13:47,422 --> 01:13:50,683
[SPEAKER_05]: By calling Zynga out on this illegal practice, in other words, calling them on their shit,

1149
01:13:52,044 --> 01:13:58,108
[SPEAKER_05]: We hope to have a secondary effect of protecting the rights of other creative studios who don't have the resources to protect themselves.

1150
01:13:59,813 --> 01:14:00,273
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1151
01:14:00,593 --> 01:14:01,654
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's fucking hilarious.

1152
01:14:01,674 --> 01:14:08,656
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that even if there is an offer of a settlement, I don't think that EA should take it.

1153
01:14:08,876 --> 01:14:10,917
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they should nail their asses to the fucking wall.

1154
01:14:10,977 --> 01:14:13,977
[SPEAKER_14]: This is so fucking weird what's happening with this.

1155
01:14:14,017 --> 01:14:14,678
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, for real.

1156
01:14:14,718 --> 01:14:15,198
[SPEAKER_14]: Think about it.

1157
01:14:15,698 --> 01:14:17,178
[SPEAKER_14]: Suddenly we're all Team EA.

1158
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:23,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Which, weren't they just named the most evil company in America thanks to the internet not that long ago?

1159
01:14:23,721 --> 01:14:24,501
[SPEAKER_14]: Yet suddenly here we are.

1160
01:14:24,521 --> 01:14:25,301
[SPEAKER_14]: We're all Team EA.

1161
01:14:25,321 --> 01:14:27,062
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just trying to redeem themselves, okay?

1162
01:14:27,182 --> 01:14:27,562
[SPEAKER_14]: And like...

1163
01:14:28,622 --> 01:14:30,783
[SPEAKER_14]: EA, hold on, hold on, this is where it gets better.

1164
01:14:31,843 --> 01:14:34,784
[SPEAKER_14]: EA is championing for the little guy.

1165
01:14:36,824 --> 01:14:41,566
[SPEAKER_14]: They're sticking up for Nimblebit and all these other, the Bingo Blitz creators and all this.

1166
01:14:42,026 --> 01:14:43,046
[SPEAKER_14]: What the fuck?

1167
01:14:43,706 --> 01:14:44,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's my thing on it.

1168
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:50,348
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, I mean, at least they're not Chick-fil-A.

1169
01:14:50,368 --> 01:14:50,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1170
01:14:54,850 --> 01:14:58,432
[SPEAKER_05]: So, they're not serving up Mass Effect with a side of hate.

1171
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:07,819
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I was hoping we could go all night without that coming up, but if it had to come up, alright.

1172
01:15:08,859 --> 01:15:10,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, back to the original point.

1173
01:15:12,302 --> 01:15:15,984
[SPEAKER_05]: They've done things that we disagree with, but overall, they've put out quality products, right?

1174
01:15:17,625 --> 01:15:23,269
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you're nodding, so if everyone can hear the rattling in Rob's head, then you'll know he's nodding.

1175
01:15:25,665 --> 01:15:27,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, you're kind of bobblehead-y tonight.

1176
01:15:28,448 --> 01:15:36,015
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, you can... I'm not saying that we're completely team EA.

1177
01:15:36,736 --> 01:15:39,559
[SPEAKER_05]: And I honestly do look at part of this as a PR stunt.

1178
01:15:40,259 --> 01:15:42,502
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, here's our perfect opportunity.

1179
01:15:42,962 --> 01:15:44,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Zynga's been taking all this money.

1180
01:15:44,504 --> 01:15:48,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's our opportunity to put them down and get some good PR out of the deal.

1181
01:15:49,168 --> 01:16:16,911
[SPEAKER_05]: and you know what if I was running a company I'd do the same shit I'd be like hey opportunity let's knock on the door but this is something that honestly a lot of good will come from as long as they stay pretty you know steady in their pursuit and nails didn't get to the wall I think they have to keep going until it's completely just until they're torn apart and then maybe nimble bit will get some money

1182
01:16:19,775 --> 01:16:20,035
[SPEAKER_05]: The end.

1183
01:16:20,615 --> 01:16:21,055
[SPEAKER_15]: The end.

1184
01:16:22,396 --> 01:16:22,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1185
01:16:22,596 --> 01:16:23,216
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

1186
01:16:23,716 --> 01:16:27,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to go back real quick to talk about that last story we were talking about.

1187
01:16:27,177 --> 01:16:29,458
[SPEAKER_02]: I completely forgot about Activision.

1188
01:16:29,798 --> 01:16:31,979
[SPEAKER_02]: That was another thing that's on this list.

1189
01:16:32,019 --> 01:16:33,179
[SPEAKER_02]: None of the Activision titles are.

1190
01:16:33,499 --> 01:16:41,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Skylanders Giants, Call of Duty Black Ops 2, Transformers Prime, there's a Cabela's Expedition.

1191
01:16:41,202 --> 01:16:41,622
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, right.

1192
01:16:41,662 --> 01:16:42,262
[SPEAKER_14]: We get it.

1193
01:16:42,322 --> 01:16:43,403
[SPEAKER_14]: It was full of crap.

1194
01:16:43,443 --> 01:16:44,643
[SPEAKER_14]: That story on the internet.

1195
01:16:45,383 --> 01:16:46,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wanted to add that.

1196
01:16:47,064 --> 01:16:47,784
[SPEAKER_02]: My Nintendo news.

1197
01:16:48,084 --> 01:16:53,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, going back to the current story, if you look at the comparisons, it really is side-by-side.

1198
01:16:53,630 --> 01:16:58,155
[SPEAKER_05]: They took a lot of the material from SimSocial.

1199
01:16:58,195 --> 01:17:02,740
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the hilarious part was the one that flip-flopped where the lawyer got the damn screen wrong.

1200
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:28,679
[SPEAKER_14]: but I mean when they're I mean there's some pretty damning evidence in there I mean I know this is all allegedly and we're not supposed to talk about it like it's already a done deal but let's be real we're all gamers we've saw through this shit a long time ago yeah and I gotta hand it to the lawyers they're breaking it down the fucking number of pixels in the doorway is the same between the two games when you look at that you're like I the smacketh down has been broughten

1201
01:17:28,979 --> 01:17:37,343
[SPEAKER_02]: If you rearrange the furniture in this room to look like the other room, you overlap the fridge, and they're the same fridge!

1202
01:17:40,945 --> 01:17:42,966
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sitting there with my big tub of popcorn.

1203
01:17:43,026 --> 01:17:44,967
[SPEAKER_14]: I want this to play out in the people's court.

1204
01:17:45,067 --> 01:17:46,627
[SPEAKER_14]: I want this to be televised.

1205
01:17:46,667 --> 01:17:48,308
[SPEAKER_14]: We will Wapner on them.

1206
01:17:48,748 --> 01:17:51,650
[SPEAKER_14]: Get Wapner out of retirement to preside over this.

1207
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:54,491
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that this shit is pretty much...

1208
01:17:56,312 --> 01:18:00,134
[SPEAKER_02]: We want you to take this game and change it enough so we don't get sued.

1209
01:18:02,636 --> 01:18:03,056
[SPEAKER_02]: In the groove.

1210
01:18:03,776 --> 01:18:11,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Look, Zynga is really going to need a moment of how are we going to survive as a company?

1211
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:15,143
[SPEAKER_14]: Because they're being kicked in the balls left and right right now.

1212
01:18:15,363 --> 01:18:17,304
[SPEAKER_14]: People are selling their stock.

1213
01:18:18,103 --> 01:18:26,228
[SPEAKER_14]: But I mean, we've all talked about we know good people that work for Zynga and I don't want people to think just because we think Zynga is evil means all the people that work there are evil.

1214
01:18:26,248 --> 01:18:26,869
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not the case.

1215
01:18:26,929 --> 01:18:28,650
[SPEAKER_14]: People just do whatever job they have to do to get by.

1216
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:34,814
[SPEAKER_14]: But clearly management needs to go another direction and some higher ups need to get sacked.

1217
01:18:35,174 --> 01:18:44,140
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not to say that they can't pull themselves out of this because let's look at another company that was kind of and it's still kind of famous of ripping off other companies.

1218
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:45,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Gameloft.

1219
01:18:45,981 --> 01:18:47,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Gameloft does a lot of like

1220
01:18:47,702 --> 01:18:52,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, that looks awfully close to Halo, or hey, that looks just like Call of Duty.

1221
01:18:52,545 --> 01:18:53,205
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

1222
01:18:53,625 --> 01:18:54,165
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not.

1223
01:18:54,666 --> 01:19:01,549
[SPEAKER_02]: They aren't literally... I mean, it's ripping off of a genre, I guess, or like a type of game, but they're actually good games.

1224
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:07,673
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the weird thing, although they aren't... One might argue that Dungeon Master Online is actually better than Diablo 3.

1225
01:19:10,837 --> 01:19:13,358
[SPEAKER_14]: At least one of those games can be played offline.

1226
01:19:13,778 --> 01:19:21,900
[SPEAKER_02]: If they can focus on making good games, because they are capable of making games, it's just come up with your own fucking ideas for once.

1227
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:23,741
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of independent guys out there.

1228
01:19:24,181 --> 01:19:29,242
[SPEAKER_02]: You bought some of them because maybe you couldn't figure out how to copy their game without it going.

1229
01:19:29,622 --> 01:19:30,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1230
01:19:42,714 --> 01:19:43,515
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, let's move on.

1231
01:19:43,535 --> 01:19:45,738
[SPEAKER_14]: We're running long tonight, so let's pick up the pace a little bit.

1232
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:46,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki.

1233
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:47,380
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1234
01:19:48,121 --> 01:19:51,486
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk a little bit about the UK.

1235
01:19:51,786 --> 01:19:53,969
[SPEAKER_02]: They've adopted the Peggy rating system.

1236
01:19:54,110 --> 01:19:54,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray.

1237
01:19:54,710 --> 01:19:55,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for them.

1238
01:19:55,472 --> 01:19:56,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray for uniformity.

1239
01:19:56,413 --> 01:19:58,275
[SPEAKER_05]: They were already duplicating it, weren't they?

1240
01:19:58,556 --> 01:19:59,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Doing double ratings?

1241
01:19:59,557 --> 01:20:00,418
[SPEAKER_02]: They were doing something.

1242
01:20:18,997 --> 01:20:35,280
[SPEAKER_02]: and then also now UK retailer workers can face prosecution for selling games with a PEGI rating of higher than the customer, obviously 12, 16 or 18 to underage customers with a maximum sentence of six years.

1243
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:38,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's pretty ridiculous.

1244
01:20:39,881 --> 01:20:43,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Six years for selling a game to a minor?

1245
01:20:44,922 --> 01:20:47,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially like a teen game, that just seems a little harsh.

1246
01:20:48,419 --> 01:20:56,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think it's more just trying to... Well, see, you know what my problem is with the rating systems is that it's discouraging parents from doing their damn job.

1247
01:20:57,722 --> 01:20:58,242
[SPEAKER_05]: End of story.

1248
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:05,585
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think that the ratings should be there to inform the parent, and then the parent should do their damn job.

1249
01:21:05,985 --> 01:21:06,165
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1250
01:21:06,685 --> 01:21:06,805
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1251
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:12,663
[SPEAKER_14]: This is kind of like that California law come to life, right?

1252
01:21:12,723 --> 01:21:16,365
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't this the whole thing that the Supreme Court overturned not that long ago is now happening?

1253
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:20,148
[SPEAKER_14]: Am I reading this right, or am I misunderstanding something?

1254
01:21:20,168 --> 01:21:37,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yes and no, but see, their thing was, it wasn't tied to, I don't know if it was tied to the M-rated stuff, but I don't know if that law, I don't know the UK laws too well, if they do something similar to the movies, the movies that are rated by the BBFC.

1255
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:43,603
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's mature or something and you sell it to a minor, if they get the same type of infraction.

1256
01:21:44,563 --> 01:21:53,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if they're going to put that in place on games, I think it should be uniform across all platforms of media if you're going to do something that drastic.

1257
01:21:53,468 --> 01:22:06,256
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's still kind of drastic, but if that's the route they're going to go, as long as it's equal across all the different media platforms, then okay, I guess.

1258
01:22:08,993 --> 01:22:13,896
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll be interesting to see how this pans out and what possible future legal challenges await, yes?

1259
01:22:13,916 --> 01:22:18,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Because that's what always inevitably ends up happening is legal challenges.

1260
01:22:18,638 --> 01:22:19,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Fun, fun.

1261
01:22:20,359 --> 01:22:29,904
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know anybody who will sue over this unless they somehow get roped into playing this without agreeing to be a willing participant in this.

1262
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:34,187
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is a case of some kids with a lot of free time on their hands.

1263
01:22:34,267 --> 01:22:35,087
[SPEAKER_14]: Not that that's bad.

1264
01:22:35,167 --> 01:22:37,289
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just the interesting things that are created.

1265
01:22:37,949 --> 01:22:40,431
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a Sega Genesis modification.

1266
01:22:40,951 --> 01:22:42,472
[SPEAKER_14]: It's called Genesap.

1267
01:22:43,112 --> 01:22:43,893
[SPEAKER_14]: It has a motto.

1268
01:22:44,233 --> 01:22:45,594
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it would be Genesap.

1269
01:22:45,634 --> 01:22:46,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Genesap?

1270
01:22:46,175 --> 01:22:47,435
[SPEAKER_14]: It's G-E-N-E.

1271
01:22:47,575 --> 01:22:47,876
[SPEAKER_14]: Gene.

1272
01:22:48,236 --> 01:22:49,617
[SPEAKER_14]: Genesap would be Gene.

1273
01:22:49,817 --> 01:22:50,377
[SPEAKER_14]: Genesap?

1274
01:22:50,858 --> 01:22:51,478
[SPEAKER_14]: Like Genesis?

1275
01:22:51,678 --> 01:22:52,959
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, look.

1276
01:22:53,019 --> 01:22:53,840
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Genesap.

1277
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:54,740
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, I'll go with that.

1278
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:55,301
[SPEAKER_14]: Genesap.

1279
01:22:55,421 --> 01:22:56,702
[SPEAKER_14]: No pity for bad players.

1280
01:22:57,182 --> 01:22:57,662
[SPEAKER_14]: What is it?

1281
01:22:57,822 --> 01:22:59,744
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a dog shock collar.

1282
01:23:00,624 --> 01:23:09,368
[SPEAKER_14]: That will zap you, whoever's wearing it, when they screw up or take damage in certain Genesis games that have been modded.

1283
01:23:10,209 --> 01:23:13,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I guess they do say it's Genesis, so it's Genazap.

1284
01:23:13,710 --> 01:23:15,071
[SPEAKER_14]: Not GeneZap, my bad.

1285
01:23:15,531 --> 01:23:17,132
[SPEAKER_15]: Looked like GeneCo.

1286
01:23:17,352 --> 01:23:19,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Their genes may be zapped by...

1287
01:23:20,296 --> 01:23:21,056
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1288
01:23:37,501 --> 01:23:47,084
[SPEAKER_14]: Where, let's see, it says go to 4 minutes 10 seconds in where Sonic falls into a spike pit and there will be a stream of bleeped out French cursing.

1289
01:23:47,244 --> 01:23:48,204
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, that sounds good to me.

1290
01:23:48,304 --> 01:23:50,245
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's fast forward to that part in the video.

1291
01:23:50,265 --> 01:23:54,186
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go to 4 minutes.

1292
01:23:55,126 --> 01:23:57,446
[SPEAKER_14]: It's in French, but you can hear Sonic in the background.

1293
01:23:57,486 --> 01:23:57,867
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we go.

1294
01:24:12,817 --> 01:24:16,183
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad to see that the kids in other countries are just as dumb as the ones here.

1295
01:24:19,193 --> 01:24:22,235
[SPEAKER_15]: That's really what it boils down to, isn't it?

1296
01:24:52,810 --> 01:24:55,832
[SPEAKER_14]: Clover Nikon says, sounds like an add-on for Jackass the Game.

1297
01:24:55,852 --> 01:25:11,041
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's really weird that I kept getting shocked when I was playing Bomberman Act Zero, but for some reason... It felt like I was getting kicked in the balls repeatedly, but it was just when I thought about the $60 I spent on Bomberman Act Zero.

1298
01:25:12,923 --> 01:25:15,444
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, one more story from DarkSakura and then the release dates.

1299
01:25:15,564 --> 01:25:16,105
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura.

1300
01:25:16,841 --> 01:25:19,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, how about some good news for E3?

1301
01:25:20,443 --> 01:25:22,465
[SPEAKER_05]: They've confirmed they're staying in Los Angeles until 2015.

1302
01:25:22,585 --> 01:25:25,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, they're like, bitches, this is our town.

1303
01:25:25,907 --> 01:25:26,988
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not building shit.

1304
01:25:27,008 --> 01:25:33,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because the city was going to tear down, what was it, the South Hall?

1305
01:25:34,933 --> 01:25:35,914
[SPEAKER_05]: I think West.

1306
01:25:36,054 --> 01:25:36,474
[SPEAKER_05]: West Hall.

1307
01:25:37,014 --> 01:25:39,436
[SPEAKER_05]: And build like a coliseum or some shit.

1308
01:25:40,036 --> 01:25:43,799
[SPEAKER_14]: But instead they're like... They're going to build a stadium for a football team they don't have yet.

1309
01:25:43,979 --> 01:25:45,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, like I said.

1310
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:46,841
[SPEAKER_14]: Weren't they building it on the roof or something?

1311
01:25:46,862 --> 01:25:48,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, some shit.

1312
01:25:51,065 --> 01:25:59,752
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, basically they're saying that they've generated $40 million for Los Angeles in three days when they do the show.

1313
01:26:00,013 --> 01:26:05,617
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're basically bringing in enough revenue that the city can't really afford to fuck with them.

1314
01:26:06,318 --> 01:26:08,580
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to be there for another three years.

1315
01:26:10,034 --> 01:26:11,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Three more years.

1316
01:26:11,775 --> 01:26:12,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

1317
01:26:13,036 --> 01:26:14,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Three more years.

1318
01:26:14,177 --> 01:26:17,760
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I have a comment.

1319
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:18,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Three more years.

1320
01:26:18,881 --> 01:26:19,882
[SPEAKER_14]: I ran to the kitchen, but I have a comment.

1321
01:26:20,642 --> 01:26:21,283
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm stealing a chip.

1322
01:26:21,383 --> 01:26:30,089
[SPEAKER_14]: I seem to remember something else about this story about how they've also worked out that the nearby vendors will no longer jack up their prices during the week of E3.

1323
01:26:30,170 --> 01:26:31,290
[SPEAKER_14]: And here's my big question.

1324
01:26:31,551 --> 01:26:32,752
[SPEAKER_14]: Does that include parking?

1325
01:26:32,852 --> 01:26:33,332
[SPEAKER_14]: It should.

1326
01:26:33,352 --> 01:26:37,055
[SPEAKER_05]: How many blocks away did we have to park the last time?

1327
01:26:38,117 --> 01:26:38,998
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1328
01:27:08,404 --> 01:27:15,411
[SPEAKER_14]: Because the year that E4ALL happened and, you know, LA lost that money, it was a little kick in the butt.

1329
01:27:16,212 --> 01:27:16,672
[SPEAKER_04]: It really was.

1330
01:27:16,692 --> 01:27:17,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they learned.

1331
01:27:17,713 --> 01:27:24,320
[SPEAKER_14]: And one could argue they may be building that new stadium to bid for, I've heard rumors LA is supposed to be bidding for another Olympic Games.

1332
01:27:25,921 --> 01:27:26,602
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a mistake.

1333
01:27:27,042 --> 01:27:30,546
[SPEAKER_05]: That ends up putting such an economic cripple on the town that hosts it.

1334
01:27:32,515 --> 01:27:33,175
[SPEAKER_14]: It depends.

1335
01:27:33,255 --> 01:27:36,997
[SPEAKER_14]: If you look historically, when LA did it, it actually didn't.

1336
01:27:37,597 --> 01:27:44,640
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how, I'm sure Bobby could answer how it worked for Atlanta, but I think when LA did it, it was fine.

1337
01:27:44,820 --> 01:27:46,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Seoul was plunged into debt.

1338
01:27:47,361 --> 01:27:48,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Beijing was plunged into debt.

1339
01:27:50,062 --> 01:27:54,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost anywhere that's hosted it has been plunged into debt afterwards with just the fallout from what's going on afterwards.

1340
01:27:55,324 --> 01:27:56,104
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's the Olympics.

1341
01:27:57,256 --> 01:28:00,918
[SPEAKER_05]: And not to mention that they have to kick out residents to build whatever facilities are there.

1342
01:28:00,978 --> 01:28:03,619
[SPEAKER_05]: The one in Greece still wasn't finished while the games were going on.

1343
01:28:04,540 --> 01:28:04,980
[SPEAKER_05]: What you saying?

1344
01:28:05,981 --> 01:28:06,761
[SPEAKER_14]: Bobby clarifies.

1345
01:28:07,081 --> 01:28:08,562
[SPEAKER_14]: Atlanta didn't lose money at all in the games.

1346
01:28:10,703 --> 01:28:12,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, but it was commercialized all to hell.

1347
01:28:12,744 --> 01:28:12,904
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1348
01:28:13,645 --> 01:28:18,928
[SPEAKER_14]: When I went to Vancouver in 2006, the Olympic Games were being shoved down my throat.

1349
01:28:19,898 --> 01:28:20,698
[SPEAKER_14]: Not that it's a bad thing.

1350
01:28:20,798 --> 01:28:21,438
[SPEAKER_14]: Olympics are fun.

1351
01:28:21,638 --> 01:28:23,519
[SPEAKER_14]: I prefer the Winter Olympics, personally.

1352
01:28:24,439 --> 01:28:27,920
[SPEAKER_14]: But anyway, let's not talk about things that are going to be happening in the year 2020.

1353
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:33,802
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's talk about next week and video games that are coming out to your nearby stores.

1354
01:28:33,902 --> 01:28:34,862
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll start with the U.S., Loki.

1355
01:28:35,082 --> 01:28:40,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I hope you like games that feature Persona characters fighting each other because that's all that's coming out this week.

1356
01:28:40,884 --> 01:28:44,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Persona 4 Arena on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

1357
01:28:44,265 --> 01:28:45,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, it's not region-free.

1358
01:28:47,926 --> 01:28:48,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Not region-free.

1359
01:28:49,588 --> 01:28:50,709
[SPEAKER_14]: Sniper Elite V2 Sniper Elite V2 Sniper Elite V2

1360
01:29:15,826 --> 01:29:17,546
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow, there's nothing on the 3DS.

1361
01:29:17,827 --> 01:29:18,867
[SPEAKER_14]: That kind of surprises me.

1362
01:29:19,487 --> 01:29:22,248
[SPEAKER_14]: There ain't anything listed until the 23rd on the 3DS.

1363
01:29:22,308 --> 01:29:23,128
[SPEAKER_14]: What a slow period.

1364
01:29:23,148 --> 01:29:24,228
[SPEAKER_05]: What holiday is going on?

1365
01:29:25,468 --> 01:29:25,889
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1366
01:29:26,249 --> 01:29:28,249
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me look at the Vita real quick, see if there's anything big there.

1367
01:29:28,709 --> 01:29:29,589
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a couple games there.

1368
01:29:29,729 --> 01:29:35,851
[SPEAKER_14]: There's Ginsei Shogi, Kayutendo Tofu Rajin comes out this week, as well as...

1369
01:29:36,491 --> 01:29:38,052
[SPEAKER_14]: Orga Rhythm comes out.

1370
01:29:38,112 --> 01:29:41,334
[SPEAKER_14]: I wonder if that's the same thing as the Sound Shapes game that's coming out here on the Vita.

1371
01:29:41,374 --> 01:29:42,415
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't that this week, by the way?

1372
01:29:42,555 --> 01:29:43,135
[SPEAKER_14]: You might have missed that.

1373
01:29:43,155 --> 01:29:45,597
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Sound Shapes is out this week on the Vita.

1374
01:29:45,757 --> 01:29:46,818
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a digital only release.

1375
01:29:47,298 --> 01:29:48,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Ooh, that could be.

1376
01:29:48,859 --> 01:29:49,119
[SPEAKER_14]: It is.

1377
01:29:49,499 --> 01:29:51,460
[SPEAKER_14]: No, this title actually looks a little different.

1378
01:29:51,881 --> 01:29:54,542
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually not a rhythm game, even though it's in the... Or maybe it is.

1379
01:29:55,443 --> 01:29:55,663
[SPEAKER_14]: It is.

1380
01:29:56,243 --> 01:29:57,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Sound Shapes is.

1381
01:29:57,104 --> 01:29:58,305
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks like Pikmin to me.

1382
01:29:58,725 --> 01:30:03,268
[SPEAKER_14]: No, this game, this Orga Rhythm looks like a... It's an action game, they're calling it.

1383
01:30:03,948 --> 01:30:05,573
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, hit a button when the queue falls.

1384
01:30:05,693 --> 01:30:06,355
[SPEAKER_14]: Hmm, interesting.

1385
01:30:06,916 --> 01:30:09,824
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it is kind of a music game, but it looks like music infused with Pikmin.

1386
01:30:10,165 --> 01:30:10,867
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of looks interesting.

1387
01:30:12,455 --> 01:30:12,916
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

1388
01:30:13,816 --> 01:30:16,899
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, AkumaJP in the chat room, next week is Obon Holiday.

1389
01:30:16,919 --> 01:30:18,120
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope I said that right.

1390
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:18,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one?

1391
01:30:19,021 --> 01:30:19,321
[SPEAKER_14]: Obon.

1392
01:30:19,681 --> 01:30:19,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

1393
01:30:20,622 --> 01:30:23,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought there was a holiday coming up around this time of year.

1394
01:30:23,625 --> 01:30:24,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.

1395
01:30:24,065 --> 01:30:25,386
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it could just be for the holiday.

1396
01:30:26,027 --> 01:30:26,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Could be.

1397
01:30:26,948 --> 01:30:29,410
[SPEAKER_05]: So, in the UK, there's a few releases.

1398
01:30:29,570 --> 01:30:31,392
[SPEAKER_05]: On the 7th is Unmechanical.

1399
01:30:32,312 --> 01:30:34,434
[SPEAKER_05]: On the 8th is Hero Academy and Hybrid.

1400
01:30:35,375 --> 01:30:36,356
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it.

1401
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:37,862
[SPEAKER_05]: But a few things.

1402
01:30:38,042 --> 01:30:38,302
[SPEAKER_05]: A few.

1403
01:30:38,503 --> 01:30:38,743
[SPEAKER_05]: A few.

1404
01:30:39,003 --> 01:30:39,483
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a few.

1405
01:30:39,963 --> 01:30:40,243
[SPEAKER_05]: A bit.

1406
01:30:40,303 --> 01:30:40,663
[SPEAKER_05]: A bit.

1407
01:30:41,284 --> 01:30:44,405
[SPEAKER_14]: A few more stories and then the classic game of the week is coming at you.

1408
01:30:44,445 --> 01:30:45,285
[SPEAKER_14]: But first, Loki.

1409
01:30:46,425 --> 01:30:46,726
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1410
01:30:48,006 --> 01:30:49,847
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Minecraft.

1411
01:30:50,247 --> 01:30:51,447
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some interesting things with that.

1412
01:30:51,507 --> 01:30:55,369
[SPEAKER_02]: First, starting off, 1.31's update has come out.

1413
01:30:56,269 --> 01:31:06,393
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you can get with that, of course, now they've merged single players and multiplayer so they have a unified mode.

1414
01:31:06,913 --> 01:31:35,096
[SPEAKER_02]: and then also they've added a few things including a chest for or the ender chest as well as writable books and you can trade now they've added tripwires which sounds awesome large biomes world type also some cocoa beans to the jungles emeralds and emerald blocks and emerald ore and

1415
01:31:37,031 --> 01:31:42,276
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess a bonus chest option, which allows people to have some stuff starting off.

1416
01:31:43,177 --> 01:31:47,061
[SPEAKER_02]: So you spawn with a chest with a few basic tools nearby, which is kind of cool.

1417
01:31:47,982 --> 01:31:51,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, let's see...

1418
01:31:53,103 --> 01:32:21,410
[SPEAKER_02]: just some other bug fixes like mobs being able to clip through walls stuff like that so that's kind of cool and then to go along with that Minecon 2012 has been announced and it's going to be going to Disneyland Paris in November I want to go to Minecon Disneyland Paris November 24th and 25th I found something for you in Japantown by the way

1419
01:32:24,471 --> 01:32:25,332
[SPEAKER_05]: A Minecraft mask.

1420
01:32:27,216 --> 01:32:28,759
[SPEAKER_05]: A big foam mask of the dude.

1421
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:30,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Steve.

1422
01:32:30,963 --> 01:32:31,343
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.

1423
01:32:31,444 --> 01:32:32,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Creeper.

1424
01:32:32,265 --> 01:32:35,251
[SPEAKER_05]: They had Creeper masks too and the pickaxe.

1425
01:32:35,571 --> 01:32:35,832
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.

1426
01:32:36,954 --> 01:32:37,294
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1427
01:32:37,695 --> 01:32:42,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I doubt you found any memorabilia for this game because it's several years old, but it's coming back.

1428
01:32:42,819 --> 01:32:43,479
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you remember?

1429
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:44,941
[SPEAKER_14]: Imagine 1994.

1430
01:32:46,422 --> 01:32:47,863
[SPEAKER_14]: And remember Wolfenstein 3D?

1431
01:32:48,704 --> 01:32:53,307
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, there was a game that came out not long after Wolfenstein 3D called Rise of the Triad.

1432
01:32:54,188 --> 01:32:56,530
[SPEAKER_14]: Rise of the Triad is coming back, y'all.

1433
01:32:56,590 --> 01:32:58,431
[SPEAKER_14]: It's coming on Unreal Engine 3.

1434
01:32:59,412 --> 01:33:02,414
[SPEAKER_14]: Apogee Software announced this at QuakeCon over the weekend.

1435
01:33:03,155 --> 01:33:09,559
[SPEAKER_14]: This was in rumor status earlier in the week, but literally earlier today it was confirmed and a trailer is out right now.

1436
01:33:10,019 --> 01:33:17,385
[SPEAKER_14]: The developer is Interceptor Software and the original Rise of the Triad level designer, Joe Siegler, is one of the members.

1437
01:33:17,925 --> 01:33:18,485
[SPEAKER_14]: Pretty awesome.

1438
01:33:18,525 --> 01:33:22,108
[SPEAKER_14]: Single player, of course, online multiplayer and a level editor.

1439
01:33:22,528 --> 01:33:23,429
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks pretty awesome.

1440
01:33:23,820 --> 01:33:26,081
[SPEAKER_14]: Via Steamworks you'll be able to share stuff.

1441
01:33:26,622 --> 01:33:27,722
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, sounds pretty cool.

1442
01:33:28,183 --> 01:33:32,465
[SPEAKER_14]: So all of the crazy weapons and dog mode.

1443
01:33:34,587 --> 01:33:36,648
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is definitely for the fans.

1444
01:33:36,668 --> 01:33:40,390
[SPEAKER_02]: The gameplay and it looked pretty awesome because I wasn't really a fan of Rise of the Triad.

1445
01:33:40,430 --> 01:33:42,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I played it a few times, the shareware game.

1446
01:33:42,712 --> 01:33:46,834
[SPEAKER_02]: But it looks pretty cool because it's kind of like a hybrid between like...

1447
01:33:48,255 --> 01:33:55,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a Wolfenstein or Duke Nukem, but fast like the Unreal games, Unreal Tournament stuff.

1448
01:33:55,837 --> 01:34:01,658
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looked kind of cool, like a lot of the fast gameplay and just with that kind of setting.

1449
01:34:02,238 --> 01:34:02,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I could dig that.

1450
01:34:03,258 --> 01:34:05,039
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of folks in our chat room are getting excited.

1451
01:34:05,079 --> 01:34:06,319
[SPEAKER_14]: DDR Dollar Bill, yes!

1452
01:34:06,439 --> 01:34:09,880
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a bit disappointed that there's not a console version.

1453
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:11,760
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only PC right now.

1454
01:34:13,015 --> 01:34:15,818
[SPEAKER_14]: Eh, if they're doing all the Steamworks and all that, I can see it.

1455
01:34:15,918 --> 01:34:20,203
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I realized PlayStation was supposed to do the Steam integration, but only one game has done it.

1456
01:34:20,763 --> 01:34:21,424
[SPEAKER_14]: So, hmm.

1457
01:34:23,593 --> 01:34:23,953
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1458
01:34:24,373 --> 01:34:27,175
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, let's go back to a time maybe perhaps even before 1994.

1459
01:34:28,155 --> 01:34:30,816
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, I have no idea when this week's game came out.

1460
01:34:31,497 --> 01:34:34,978
[SPEAKER_14]: But DarkSakura will clarify that for us right now.

1461
01:34:35,659 --> 01:34:36,599
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little older than that.

1462
01:34:36,859 --> 01:34:37,460
[SPEAKER_14]: A little older than that.

1463
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:37,800
[SPEAKER_14]: A little newer.

1464
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:38,380
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, a little newer.

1465
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:38,840
[SPEAKER_14]: A little newer.

1466
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:39,120
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1467
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:48,265
[SPEAKER_14]: Every week, DarkSakura likes to jump into the classic gaming vault and find a classic video game that she thinks, hey, you little brats, play this game or suffer my wrath.

1468
01:34:49,085 --> 01:34:52,546
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1469
01:34:52,966 --> 01:34:57,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Donpachi, which is awesome and very hard.

1470
01:34:58,407 --> 01:35:03,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Donpachi is one of the... Actually, play the screen.

1471
01:35:04,608 --> 01:35:06,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Play the opening screen, because I can never say it quite right.

1472
01:35:06,909 --> 01:35:07,789
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the way the guy says it.

1473
01:35:07,849 --> 01:35:08,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my bad.

1474
01:35:08,349 --> 01:35:08,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

1475
01:35:09,429 --> 01:35:10,450
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after that, you can fast forward.

1476
01:35:10,730 --> 01:35:10,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1477
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:14,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Presented by Kate.

1478
01:35:15,651 --> 01:35:16,211
[SPEAKER_04]: If that helps.

1479
01:35:16,231 --> 01:35:16,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Little voiceovers.

1480
01:35:27,441 --> 01:35:29,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because I can never say it like that.

1481
01:35:29,483 --> 01:35:30,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't punch!

1482
01:35:31,224 --> 01:35:35,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, it's made by Cave and published by Atlas in 1995.

1483
01:35:36,028 --> 01:35:41,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, for anyone who knows the term Cave Shooter, this pretty much started it.

1484
01:35:41,913 --> 01:35:47,717
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the first game that was developed by Cave and the second on their first generation arcade hardware.

1485
01:35:47,737 --> 01:35:48,978
[SPEAKER_05]: The first was Power Instinct 2.

1486
01:35:50,079 --> 01:35:56,485
[SPEAKER_05]: The title means Leader B. But it's also an onomatopoeia as in the sound of firing guns.

1487
01:35:57,386 --> 01:36:02,215
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is, like I said, one of the first bullet hell games.

1488
01:36:03,769 --> 01:36:15,792
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, you play as a pilot whose mission is to just survive an eight years long training mission so that you can become one of the Dompachi Squadron.

1489
01:36:17,212 --> 01:36:22,674
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, you're progressing through their training period.

1490
01:36:22,754 --> 01:36:23,954
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have two modes of fire.

1491
01:36:23,994 --> 01:36:31,056
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a shot fire one, but holding it down, you have a concentrated vertical beam, but it slows down your ship like a whole freaking lot.

1492
01:36:32,117 --> 01:36:33,999
[SPEAKER_05]: You have three different kinds of aircraft.

1493
01:36:34,539 --> 01:36:38,423
[SPEAKER_05]: You have Type A, which is the red one that has a narrow stream of shots.

1494
01:36:38,944 --> 01:36:40,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Type B, which is green.

1495
01:36:40,786 --> 01:36:48,254
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a helicopter that has main guns forward and then side guns that rotate 90 degrees from forward when you're moving horizontally.

1496
01:36:48,294 --> 01:36:54,300
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Type C, which is the blue or black one that has a wide three-way spread shot, which honestly, Type C is my favorite.

1497
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:55,781
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1498
01:37:16,475 --> 01:37:21,539
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've got five different areas, and you can loop them if you complete them.

1499
01:37:21,619 --> 01:37:29,586
[SPEAKER_05]: The second loop has the same areas, the same patterns, but it's a denser bullet, so basically it really does turn into the bullet hell.

1500
01:37:30,627 --> 01:37:39,934
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you get the final boss in the second loop, you have a secret area where you meet the big boss of the game, the Hachi, which is a bee.

1501
01:37:42,316 --> 01:37:45,478
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, other than that though, it's pretty much a shooter.

1502
01:37:45,498 --> 01:37:55,065
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get your power increases, you can get your bomb increases, and MP, you can pick it up after you've continued so it returns all of your powers to full strength.

1503
01:37:57,028 --> 01:37:58,349
[SPEAKER_05]: www.DarkSakura.com

1504
01:38:21,847 --> 01:38:22,848
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, your leftovers.

1505
01:38:23,348 --> 01:38:24,429
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's pretty much it.

1506
01:38:24,509 --> 01:38:31,794
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this was the game that started the whole bullet hell series of games.

1507
01:38:31,934 --> 01:38:37,518
[SPEAKER_05]: And it did have a sequel, Dodonpach, which is out on iPhone.

1508
01:38:37,958 --> 01:38:38,779
[SPEAKER_05]: You can play it on the iPhone.

1509
01:38:40,925 --> 01:38:42,866
[SPEAKER_05]: But it probably sucks, let's be real.

1510
01:38:42,886 --> 01:38:43,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know.

1511
01:38:43,686 --> 01:38:50,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Espagabaluda, which I can never say right, did perform very well.

1512
01:38:51,249 --> 01:38:54,731
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually planned on buying the Domepachi Revolution, wasn't it called?

1513
01:38:54,811 --> 01:38:56,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Resurrection or whatever the crap.

1514
01:38:57,852 --> 01:39:01,693
[SPEAKER_05]: The game Domepachi is out on Saturn and it is a game that's on my list to buy.

1515
01:39:03,274 --> 01:39:04,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome freaking game.

1516
01:39:04,795 --> 01:39:06,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1517
01:39:06,715 --> 01:39:07,176
[SPEAKER_14]: Domepachi!

1518
01:39:07,636 --> 01:39:08,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Domepachi!

1519
01:39:10,365 --> 01:39:14,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Bullet Hell, Vertical Love See, you're not even getting into the Bullet Hell part of it.

1520
01:39:14,506 --> 01:39:15,467
[SPEAKER_05]: This is still like the first fucking level.

1521
01:39:15,487 --> 01:39:16,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, this looks easy.

1522
01:39:16,827 --> 01:39:19,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I can make it through the first two levels of Donpachi, no problem.

1523
01:39:19,988 --> 01:39:22,189
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me forward later in the video here, see what happens.

1524
01:39:22,269 --> 01:39:24,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there you're getting a little bit more into the Bullet Hell.

1525
01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:24,630
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1526
01:39:24,670 --> 01:39:27,751
[SPEAKER_05]: But the second playthrough, uh-uh, no, I can't do it.

1527
01:39:28,831 --> 01:39:32,052
[SPEAKER_05]: And I ended up getting kind of dizzy playing Bullet Hell games.

1528
01:39:32,092 --> 01:39:33,733
[SPEAKER_05]: See, that's where you get into it.

1529
01:39:34,033 --> 01:39:39,656
[SPEAKER_14]: I am not good at bullet hell games I'm just going to go ahead and say this But I love them She doesn't dodge bullets, she shoots them

1530
01:40:01,761 --> 01:40:06,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's kind of why I like Ikaruga, because you can absorb the ones.

1531
01:40:06,387 --> 01:40:08,490
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes it a little bit easier to get through the mass.

1532
01:40:09,150 --> 01:40:12,675
[SPEAKER_05]: But I freaking played the crap out of Espaluda on my phone.

1533
01:40:12,995 --> 01:40:13,696
[SPEAKER_05]: So, just saying.

1534
01:40:14,157 --> 01:40:15,599
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1535
01:40:16,448 --> 01:40:17,709
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to take a break, kids.

1536
01:40:18,109 --> 01:40:19,430
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't go anywhere when we come back.

1537
01:40:19,550 --> 01:40:32,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Rapid Fire News, the Fugle Question of the Week, your calls, your emails, and some more news, including a Steam decision that may prove to be not too popular, but seems to be popular with a lot of game makers and game publishers right now.

1538
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:36,722
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be back after a quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1539
01:40:36,783 --> 01:40:37,243
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't go anywhere.

1540
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:52,722
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, episode 468 in progress, August the 5th of 2012, live at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

1541
01:40:53,162 --> 01:40:55,063
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, Loki, what was this you were bringing up during the break?

1542
01:40:55,523 --> 01:40:57,343
[SPEAKER_14]: You were going to tell it on air anyway, so go ahead.

1543
01:40:58,204 --> 01:41:02,925
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to send Ernest Cline a message on Twitter because...

1544
01:41:04,225 --> 01:41:14,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the world record for Black Tiger is only possible on this machine at... What do they call it?

1545
01:41:14,989 --> 01:41:16,770
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Fun Spot.

1546
01:41:18,311 --> 01:41:20,492
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the one that the world record was accomplished on.

1547
01:41:20,552 --> 01:41:23,173
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the huge classic game arcade.

1548
01:41:23,193 --> 01:41:24,693
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one that's in the movies and all that shit.

1549
01:41:24,713 --> 01:41:25,674
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a huge arcade.

1550
01:41:26,934 --> 01:41:29,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Their people have already beat it on the actual machine.

1551
01:41:29,835 --> 01:41:32,316
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that they haven't been verified by Twin Galaxies.

1552
01:41:33,957 --> 01:41:34,538
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1553
01:41:58,119 --> 01:42:02,023
[SPEAKER_02]: And though for sure it's all in English, I just figured I'd push it higher at this fun spot.

1554
01:42:02,304 --> 01:42:06,288
[SPEAKER_02]: This morning, I think I scored 2.7 million.

1555
01:42:06,308 --> 01:42:07,128
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my highest.

1556
01:42:08,710 --> 01:42:12,834
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, it's impossible to hit that score unless you go to fun spot.

1557
01:42:13,335 --> 01:42:15,837
[SPEAKER_02]: So fuck that shit, is what I gotta say.

1558
01:42:16,858 --> 01:42:37,682
[SPEAKER_02]: and just because Twin Galaxies doesn't want to cop up to the fact that oh hey, we didn't really investigate this board and just because the guy that refed that shit fucking doesn't know anything about Black Tiger and maybe isn't aware of the fact that you can grind your score up by running through the game really fast and at the end you're basically taking out zombies that keep respawning and that's how you get your score up.

1559
01:42:37,742 --> 01:42:45,464
[SPEAKER_02]: That is well known in the community that plays Black Tiger even for me who doesn't know anything about Black Tiger but oh, just all of a sudden got into the community about it.

1560
01:42:46,244 --> 01:42:49,126
[SPEAKER_02]: So that needs to be pointed out so that they can fix this shit.

1561
01:42:49,667 --> 01:42:54,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I would like to legitimately have a high score in that game, but I can't if the game is fucking modded.

1562
01:42:58,393 --> 01:42:59,554
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the plaintiff.

1563
01:43:01,996 --> 01:43:04,958
[SPEAKER_14]: He goes by Loki on a podcast that nobody listens to.

1564
01:43:05,359 --> 01:43:10,522
[SPEAKER_14]: He claims that the defendants, a bunch of fucking fucktards who don't know how to run a contest...

1565
01:43:11,601 --> 01:43:12,443
[SPEAKER_14]: We're negligent.

1566
01:43:13,686 --> 01:43:15,691
[SPEAKER_14]: He's suing for a 12-pack of Diet Pepsi.

1567
01:43:18,743 --> 01:43:19,363
[SPEAKER_02]: It's legit.

1568
01:43:19,404 --> 01:43:24,647
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy that beat the score is familiar with Black Tiger, and that's how he said it scored.

1569
01:43:24,987 --> 01:43:28,450
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't understand why Twin Galaxies can go and claim.

1570
01:43:29,090 --> 01:43:30,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Go investigate it then.

1571
01:43:30,271 --> 01:43:36,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Go have someone play that game because obviously someone's very easily able to beat that high score.

1572
01:43:36,615 --> 01:43:40,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Have them play the game and watch how it scores or have them verify.

1573
01:43:40,678 --> 01:43:41,679
[SPEAKER_14]: I am so over this.

1574
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:47,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just like, we don't check the machine, but they did it to Steve Wiebe's machine on film.

1575
01:43:48,046 --> 01:43:52,151
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that you guys are over this, but you're not over the fucking Chick-fil-A shit.

1576
01:43:52,311 --> 01:43:52,832
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1577
01:43:53,052 --> 01:43:55,335
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean Chick-fil-A show?

1578
01:43:55,595 --> 01:43:56,736
[SPEAKER_14]: Please, please don't.

1579
01:43:58,879 --> 01:44:01,081
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I am over it, so let's not go there.

1580
01:44:02,103 --> 01:44:02,363
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

1581
01:44:06,998 --> 01:44:10,782
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, I need to filet this episode over to Lounge Radio.

1582
01:44:11,142 --> 01:44:15,267
[SPEAKER_05]: I did see the best ever take on that for marketing purpose.

1583
01:44:15,667 --> 01:44:16,949
[SPEAKER_05]: The chick on chick filet.

1584
01:44:18,230 --> 01:44:19,392
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a double chicken breast.

1585
01:44:19,592 --> 01:44:20,112
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, look.

1586
01:44:20,493 --> 01:44:22,115
[SPEAKER_14]: We're gonna get into rapid fire news.

1587
01:44:22,515 --> 01:44:23,876
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey Bradley, how you doing?

1588
01:44:23,916 --> 01:44:27,078
[SPEAKER_14]: Our special guest here in the studio on this historic night.

1589
01:44:27,118 --> 01:44:27,918
[SPEAKER_14]: How you hanging in there?

1590
01:44:28,078 --> 01:44:28,478
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm alright.

1591
01:44:28,558 --> 01:44:30,560
[SPEAKER_14]: I apologize for Loki's behavior tonight.

1592
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:36,823
[SPEAKER_14]: And the constant barrage of references on things we come to Sunday nights at Orange Launch Radio to escape from.

1593
01:44:37,123 --> 01:44:38,984
[SPEAKER_14]: What are you playing on your 3DS over there?

1594
01:44:39,204 --> 01:44:40,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Playing Mole Mania right now.

1595
01:44:40,945 --> 01:44:41,146
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1596
01:44:41,506 --> 01:44:42,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Mole Mania?

1597
01:44:42,106 --> 01:44:42,626
[SPEAKER_14]: Mole Mania.

1598
01:44:42,766 --> 01:44:44,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I thought you said Mall Mania at first.

1599
01:44:44,407 --> 01:44:45,668
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, what the hell game is that?

1600
01:44:45,708 --> 01:44:46,529
[SPEAKER_14]: Why are you playing it?

1601
01:44:49,731 --> 01:44:50,031
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1602
01:44:51,272 --> 01:44:51,772
[SPEAKER_14]: How is it?

1603
01:44:52,613 --> 01:44:52,994
[SPEAKER_14]: How's the game?

1604
01:44:53,014 --> 01:44:55,256
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that an old school Game Boy game or like a new 3DS game?

1605
01:44:55,396 --> 01:44:56,717
[SPEAKER_14]: It's an old school Game Boy game.

1606
01:44:57,017 --> 01:44:58,318
[SPEAKER_10]: It's on a virtual console.

1607
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:02,122
[SPEAKER_14]: What other virtual console games you own on that thing over there?

1608
01:45:03,103 --> 01:45:07,247
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the only thing I have is Dragon Crystal, which is a Game Gear game.

1609
01:45:07,907 --> 01:45:08,188
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

1610
01:45:08,908 --> 01:45:11,871
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course the other like Ambassador games, stuff like that, but.

1611
01:45:12,273 --> 01:45:13,154
[SPEAKER_14]: As quickly as possible!

1612
01:45:13,214 --> 01:45:13,334
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki!

1613
01:45:41,363 --> 01:45:42,144
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll wait for the mic there.

1614
01:45:43,544 --> 01:45:47,587
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, let's talk a little bit about NBA 2K13.

1615
01:45:47,967 --> 01:45:56,813
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently now, I don't even know why this is a thing, but apparently Jay-Z is going to be executive producing the game.

1616
01:45:57,293 --> 01:46:01,336
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that changes your opinion on whether you should buy that game or not, but...

1617
01:46:03,052 --> 01:46:09,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so he's going to have, I guess he's doing some of the, picking up the soundtrack maybe?

1618
01:46:11,284 --> 01:46:19,015
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a bunch of his songs in there, and looks like a lot of other hip-hop artists in there as well.

1619
01:46:19,420 --> 01:46:22,022
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, actually, I think it's kind of a clever move.

1620
01:46:22,102 --> 01:46:37,512
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, I know some of y'all might be skeptical about it, but it's star power, and it's a big star with a lot of power, and I think for those two worlds to kind of collide, the music world and the gaming world, I think there's definitely a lot of people that are going to

1621
01:46:38,172 --> 01:46:43,035
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to turn their head a little closer at NBA 2K13 because of Jay-Z's involvement.

1622
01:46:43,336 --> 01:46:46,218
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's stories like this.

1623
01:46:47,058 --> 01:46:48,419
[SPEAKER_14]: Would we talk about this otherwise?

1624
01:46:48,499 --> 01:46:49,059
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably not.

1625
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:53,602
[SPEAKER_14]: It's that whole thing that's probably good for him being on board.

1626
01:46:53,622 --> 01:46:56,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Props to them for including Daft Punk around the world.

1627
01:46:56,084 --> 01:46:56,725
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cool.

1628
01:46:57,365 --> 01:46:59,426
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a Justice song in there.

1629
01:47:01,188 --> 01:47:04,350
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm pretty sure Jay-Z's married to Beyonce, for heaven's sake.

1630
01:47:04,390 --> 01:47:07,612
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I'm pretty sure he's pretty diverse with his music likes.

1631
01:47:09,013 --> 01:47:13,417
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess they were a little disappointed about all the characters being leaked out.

1632
01:47:31,702 --> 01:47:35,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Chan Park of Superbot Entertainment said that was unexpected and unintended.

1633
01:47:37,448 --> 01:47:38,009
[SPEAKER_02]: No shit.

1634
01:47:41,152 --> 01:47:44,855
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, apparently they're going to make some more official character announcements.

1635
01:47:44,875 --> 01:47:50,922
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll probably include it in those ones that they've already leaked out August 15th during Gamescom.

1636
01:47:51,923 --> 01:47:52,763
[SPEAKER_02]: And last but not least...

1637
01:47:53,524 --> 01:47:54,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1638
01:48:24,803 --> 01:48:28,086
[SPEAKER_02]: The religion, I guess, is called Kiflam.

1639
01:48:30,508 --> 01:48:30,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Neat.

1640
01:48:31,509 --> 01:48:33,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, EpsilonProgram.com.

1641
01:48:33,711 --> 01:48:37,394
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go check it out, and they've got some stuff there.

1642
01:48:40,629 --> 01:48:41,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you getting excited?

1643
01:48:41,490 --> 01:48:42,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you getting hyped?

1644
01:48:42,351 --> 01:48:43,752
[SPEAKER_02]: All this Grand Theft Auto V stuff?

1645
01:48:43,812 --> 01:48:45,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's not really much Grand Theft Auto V stuff right now.

1646
01:48:45,835 --> 01:48:59,870
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, they had the whole financial conference thing that they were talking about all the different games and how they were doing and everything, and Grand Theft Auto V wasn't even really mentioned too much, so...

1647
01:49:00,571 --> 01:49:03,095
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of neat that they're going to have some stuff.

1648
01:49:03,355 --> 01:49:05,439
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping that we get some out of Gamescom.

1649
01:49:05,459 --> 01:49:11,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to see something, but I'm guessing that this game is probably not coming until at least April of next year.

1650
01:49:13,811 --> 01:49:20,517
[SPEAKER_14]: Stan in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, if anyone gets a beta code for All-Stars Battle Royale and you don't want it, I'd be happy to take it off your hands.

1651
01:49:22,018 --> 01:49:25,761
[SPEAKER_14]: Ratchet Tag speculating on the JZ NBA 2K13.

1652
01:49:25,821 --> 01:49:27,002
[SPEAKER_14]: Blue Ivy will be in it.

1653
01:49:27,803 --> 01:49:28,684
[SPEAKER_14]: No way, Jose.

1654
01:49:29,124 --> 01:49:32,186
[SPEAKER_14]: That baby's going to be like Michael Jackson's kids back when they were young.

1655
01:49:34,068 --> 01:49:37,971
[SPEAKER_14]: They had to go out and wear the face coverings so that the media couldn't get pictures.

1656
01:49:38,792 --> 01:49:39,512
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what will happen.

1657
01:49:40,842 --> 01:49:44,144
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, moving on to some other rapid fire news.

1658
01:49:44,284 --> 01:49:47,606
[SPEAKER_14]: Doom 3 is getting a re-release as we've already talked about before.

1659
01:49:47,686 --> 01:49:49,206
[SPEAKER_14]: Doom 3 BFG edition.

1660
01:49:49,587 --> 01:49:50,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Some news coming out of QuakeCon.

1661
01:49:51,228 --> 01:49:55,430
[SPEAKER_14]: There is going to be an extra Lost mission that will be in the HD remaster.

1662
01:49:55,550 --> 01:49:59,272
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't know what the Lost mission entails, but not too surprising.

1663
01:49:59,412 --> 01:50:03,294
[SPEAKER_14]: Usually these types of remasters and remakes get some type of extra bonus thing.

1664
01:50:03,594 --> 01:50:06,836
[SPEAKER_14]: So something that was originally on the cutting room floor makes a lot of sense.

1665
01:50:07,416 --> 01:50:12,443
[SPEAKER_14]: So it comes out this October if you missed Doom 3 the first time around or you'll want to play it again.

1666
01:50:13,932 --> 01:50:19,896
[SPEAKER_14]: One game I can't understand why people play again and again, but it's like torture.

1667
01:50:20,377 --> 01:50:24,119
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the type of game that I would have expected Loki would have to beat to win a DeLorean.

1668
01:50:24,139 --> 01:50:25,200
[SPEAKER_14]: You ever played QWOP?

1669
01:50:26,341 --> 01:50:27,181
[SPEAKER_14]: I've played QWOP.

1670
01:50:27,201 --> 01:50:32,104
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been dying to download this because I really want to shoot some pigeons.

1671
01:50:32,165 --> 01:50:32,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, actually, yeah.

1672
01:50:33,385 --> 01:50:34,646
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not QWOP.

1673
01:50:34,706 --> 01:50:35,547
[SPEAKER_14]: I call it QWOP.

1674
01:50:35,707 --> 01:50:35,847
[SPEAKER_14]: QWOP.

1675
01:50:35,867 --> 01:50:36,047
[SPEAKER_14]: QWOP.

1676
01:50:36,648 --> 01:50:36,928
[SPEAKER_14]: QWOP.

1677
01:50:38,969 --> 01:50:39,849
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

1678
01:50:57,837 --> 01:51:00,119
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, what, how, god, how the hell do you describe it?

1679
01:51:00,179 --> 01:51:06,224
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like a running simulation, but, like, remember, like, Track and Field by Konami back in the 80s in the arcade?

1680
01:51:06,584 --> 01:51:10,027
[SPEAKER_14]: Running was simulated by hitting the buttons as fast as you can, like, right?

1681
01:51:10,087 --> 01:51:13,030
[SPEAKER_14]: And on the old school NES games and the power pad, run as fast as you can.

1682
01:51:13,410 --> 01:51:15,432
[SPEAKER_14]: Q-Op is actually about, like...

1683
01:51:16,152 --> 01:51:23,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Ben the Knee, Ben the Ankle, and it's four buttons to control it, but it's all like super physics and stuff.

1684
01:51:23,617 --> 01:51:30,162
[SPEAKER_14]: So now there is Klopp, and it is by the maker of Klopp and Gurp and whatever other games they've come out with.

1685
01:51:30,542 --> 01:51:42,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Klopp is a four-legged unicorn that you use H, J, K, and L to control the unicorn, and in this one, good luck getting up hills.

1686
01:51:42,951 --> 01:51:43,071
Yeah.

1687
01:51:46,735 --> 01:51:49,016
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the game Loki should have had to play.

1688
01:51:50,798 --> 01:51:53,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried playing Klopp and I kept laughing.

1689
01:51:53,539 --> 01:51:54,020
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.

1690
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:56,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never played it.

1691
01:51:56,201 --> 01:51:57,042
[SPEAKER_02]: You haven't played Klopp?

1692
01:51:57,722 --> 01:51:59,263
[SPEAKER_14]: God, I'm worried where this is going.

1693
01:51:59,283 --> 01:51:59,904
[SPEAKER_14]: I've never played it.

1694
01:52:00,644 --> 01:52:05,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Klopp, you control each foot of the horse.

1695
01:52:05,728 --> 01:52:14,314
[SPEAKER_02]: If you happen to use the front feet, you unlock lame horse mode where the back feet get broken and you have to crawl with the front feet.

1696
01:52:15,626 --> 01:52:16,926
[SPEAKER_15]: This sounds ridiculous.

1697
01:52:17,046 --> 01:52:21,787
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's like this weird Justin Bieber looking character that keeps making fun of you when you die.

1698
01:52:22,367 --> 01:52:24,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Or not even necessarily die, but you like... That's just rude.

1699
01:52:24,868 --> 01:52:26,708
[SPEAKER_02]: You slowly tip over backwards.

1700
01:52:26,728 --> 01:52:27,449
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of funny.

1701
01:52:27,549 --> 01:52:28,289
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just rude.

1702
01:52:28,329 --> 01:52:29,989
[SPEAKER_14]: Justin Bieber comes out and makes fun of you?

1703
01:52:30,049 --> 01:52:32,790
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it looks like Zac Efron or Justin Bieber.

1704
01:52:32,890 --> 01:52:34,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just weird.

1705
01:52:35,510 --> 01:52:38,271
[SPEAKER_14]: Ratchet Tag in our chatroom says, Unicorns make everything better.

1706
01:52:38,931 --> 01:52:39,531
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly.

1707
01:52:39,571 --> 01:52:41,091
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's exactly what this game is all about.

1708
01:52:41,111 --> 01:52:41,972
[SPEAKER_14]: Does it fart rainbows?

1709
01:52:42,412 --> 01:52:42,772
[SPEAKER_14]: It might.

1710
01:52:43,992 --> 01:52:45,552
[SPEAKER_05]: I only want a unicorn that farts rainbows.

1711
01:52:46,393 --> 01:52:54,615
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, maybe you can find the rainbow farting special item in the World of Warcraft arcade cabinet that is apparently on its way out in China.

1712
01:52:55,355 --> 01:53:01,956
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a China Digital Entertainment Expo going on right now, and apparently there is a World of Warcraft arcade machine on its way.

1713
01:53:03,677 --> 01:53:06,377
[SPEAKER_14]: League of Legends, Starcraft 2, and some other stuff as well.

1714
01:53:06,417 --> 01:53:09,438
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, they show pictures of people playing it in an arcade-style machine.

1715
01:53:09,918 --> 01:53:18,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Now don't think, like, I'm not talking like it's a special arcade release of the game, but you gotta remember the arcades in Asia, still very much a thriving community.

1716
01:53:18,625 --> 01:53:23,669
[SPEAKER_14]: Things like cyber cafes and things that never took off here do much better in these other countries.

1717
01:53:23,709 --> 01:53:26,091
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's really about the kind of the community and getting together.

1718
01:53:26,192 --> 01:53:30,275
[SPEAKER_14]: So the fact that they're putting these games in arcade style cabinets, really not a surprise at all.

1719
01:53:30,815 --> 01:53:33,177
[SPEAKER_14]: Especially if you look at Counter-Strike Neo.

1720
01:53:33,237 --> 01:53:33,678
[SPEAKER_14]: Look at that.

1721
01:53:33,998 --> 01:53:35,219
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a very pretty machine.

1722
01:53:35,259 --> 01:53:37,501
[SPEAKER_14]: All these little sit-down cabinets, people playing Counter-Strike.

1723
01:53:38,301 --> 01:53:38,462
[SPEAKER_14]: So...

1724
01:53:39,242 --> 01:53:43,004
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting, but not something you're going to see over here anytime soon, I'm sure of that.

1725
01:53:43,965 --> 01:53:45,926
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, are we able to get those stories going?

1726
01:53:46,046 --> 01:53:46,266
[SPEAKER_14]: Cool.

1727
01:53:46,806 --> 01:53:47,086
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up?

1728
01:53:47,526 --> 01:53:54,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, how about first off, Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed has bonus edition with an Outrun track and Metal Sonic.

1729
01:53:56,591 --> 01:53:59,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, and it has an in-game emoticon sticker pack.

1730
01:53:59,192 --> 01:54:00,913
[SPEAKER_14]: But will it have Magical Sound Shower?

1731
01:54:01,253 --> 01:54:02,514
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care because it has the Opa Opa.

1732
01:54:05,231 --> 01:54:06,712
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, Rocksmith.

1733
01:54:07,472 --> 01:54:13,255
[SPEAKER_05]: It's getting a base mode on August 14th, looks like.

1734
01:54:14,055 --> 01:54:21,498
[SPEAKER_05]: So it will have bassists that can improve their skills with two-finger plucking, slapping, and popping.

1735
01:54:21,598 --> 01:54:23,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds very dirty.

1736
01:54:23,959 --> 01:54:27,841
[SPEAKER_05]: But it also has bass technique challenges, tutorial videos, and minigames.

1737
01:54:28,682 --> 01:54:29,962
[SPEAKER_05]: So lots of bass stuff.

1738
01:54:30,582 --> 01:54:31,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Because bass is awesome.

1739
01:54:33,847 --> 01:54:54,921
[SPEAKER_05]: I am partial to the base and then how about this for QuakeCon Steam's having a sale Bethesda games are cheap it's the QuakeCon bundle that's going to have 20 games and again I'm reading this off of a British site so 300 pounds worth for 70 pounds for the lot of it

1740
01:54:56,002 --> 01:54:57,483
[SPEAKER_05]: And today is Elder Scrolls Day.

1741
01:54:59,564 --> 01:55:10,952
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, of course, as of Sunday, where you can get the Elder Scrolls collection for 47% off, Morrowind for 66% off, and Oblivion for 66% off.

1742
01:55:11,432 --> 01:55:14,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Skyrim will be 50% off, so this is your chance to get it on the cheap.

1743
01:55:16,576 --> 01:55:20,979
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also going to be a QuakeCon sale happening in the App Store.

1744
01:55:22,720 --> 01:55:23,080
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

1745
01:55:24,201 --> 01:55:24,421
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.

1746
01:55:25,182 --> 01:55:26,203
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, let's move on.

1747
01:55:26,343 --> 01:55:29,726
[SPEAKER_14]: And every week we do a segment here called the Fugle Question of the Week.

1748
01:55:31,388 --> 01:55:34,390
[SPEAKER_14]: Take Facebook, take Google, put it together, you get Fugle.

1749
01:55:36,852 --> 01:55:47,082
[SPEAKER_14]: And we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities every week and read some of the answers here on the show and to poll our folks in studios as well as to their thoughts on this question.

1750
01:55:47,122 --> 01:55:48,483
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll start with Google Plus tonight.

1751
01:55:48,543 --> 01:55:49,203
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's the question.

1752
01:55:50,399 --> 01:55:52,381
[SPEAKER_14]: An article on VOG earlier this week.

1753
01:55:52,481 --> 01:55:54,242
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope you all are reading the articles at VOG.

1754
01:55:54,402 --> 01:55:57,505
[SPEAKER_14]: I know we haven't been publishing a lot, but we've been trying to get some stuff out there.

1755
01:55:57,545 --> 01:55:59,326
[SPEAKER_14]: And there was a good one this week from Alan.

1756
01:56:00,627 --> 01:56:02,048
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not just saying that because he lives here.

1757
01:56:02,909 --> 01:56:08,053
[SPEAKER_14]: But he wrote a good article about Minecraft and kind of what made him really like the game the third try.

1758
01:56:08,614 --> 01:56:11,236
[SPEAKER_14]: The first time he played Minecraft, he was like, what the hell is this shit?

1759
01:56:11,576 --> 01:56:15,578
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, the second time a little more, third time finally fell in love with it.

1760
01:56:15,978 --> 01:56:26,163
[SPEAKER_14]: So our question to the Fugles this week is, has there ever been a game that you really didn't like the first time you played it, only to come back a second or third or fourth time and fall in love with it?

1761
01:56:26,543 --> 01:56:29,024
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think caused the change in your opinion?

1762
01:56:29,945 --> 01:56:34,227
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm sure some of us here in studio can think of games like this, but what is the game?

1763
01:56:34,767 --> 01:56:35,728
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll get around here in a minute.

1764
01:56:36,008 --> 01:56:37,849
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, let's start with Panaxiom on Google+.

1765
01:56:38,349 --> 01:56:40,370
[SPEAKER_14]: For me, it was the Civilization franchise.

1766
01:56:41,070 --> 01:56:46,713
[SPEAKER_14]: I just couldn't get into it, but then I started downloading all the awesome mods for Civ 4, and that changed everything.

1767
01:56:47,034 --> 01:56:48,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Fantasy World, yes please.

1768
01:56:48,534 --> 01:56:50,556
[SPEAKER_14]: Sci-fi colonization, hell yeah.

1769
01:56:50,876 --> 01:56:51,556
[SPEAKER_14]: So, mods.

1770
01:56:52,717 --> 01:56:56,439
[SPEAKER_14]: Redertainment says, yes, in fact I'll be playing it when this show airs.

1771
01:56:56,519 --> 01:56:57,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Dragon Age Origins.

1772
01:56:58,280 --> 01:56:58,881
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura.com

1773
01:57:13,917 --> 01:57:15,158
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

1774
01:57:15,218 --> 01:57:18,341
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw a movie in the theater and it's one of my favorite movies.

1775
01:57:18,381 --> 01:57:19,262
[SPEAKER_14]: This was a couple years ago.

1776
01:57:19,883 --> 01:57:20,403
[SPEAKER_14]: Stardust.

1777
01:57:20,423 --> 01:57:21,164
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you ever see that movie?

1778
01:57:21,204 --> 01:57:22,265
[SPEAKER_14]: I love that movie.

1779
01:57:22,305 --> 01:57:22,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Love.

1780
01:57:23,166 --> 01:57:23,906
[SPEAKER_14]: It's so good.

1781
01:57:23,926 --> 01:57:25,568
[SPEAKER_14]: I have it on HD DVD.

1782
01:57:25,688 --> 01:57:26,449
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, me too.

1783
01:57:26,809 --> 01:57:27,309
[SPEAKER_14]: And Blu-ray.

1784
01:57:27,570 --> 01:57:29,011
[SPEAKER_14]: It's based on a Neil Gaiman novel.

1785
01:57:29,171 --> 01:57:31,814
[SPEAKER_14]: And I thought the movie turned out great.

1786
01:57:31,874 --> 01:57:33,835
[SPEAKER_14]: Michelle Pfeiffer is great and all that.

1787
01:57:34,276 --> 01:57:39,441
[SPEAKER_14]: But when I came home from watching the movie, I suddenly wanted to play Elder Scrolls Oblivion.

1788
01:57:40,856 --> 01:57:42,096
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, it's kind of weird.

1789
01:57:42,537 --> 01:57:44,977
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's the same type of thing that Red Entertainment's talking about.

1790
01:57:45,258 --> 01:57:47,538
[SPEAKER_14]: Watching Game of Thrones made them want to play Dragon Age Origins.

1791
01:57:47,598 --> 01:57:48,199
[SPEAKER_14]: Chair of Swords.

1792
01:57:48,219 --> 01:57:56,721
[SPEAKER_05]: It's this weird kind of... For the record, reading Tolkien is torture.

1793
01:57:57,022 --> 01:57:58,182
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to take patience.

1794
01:57:59,082 --> 01:58:02,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Good stories as long as you get past the descriptions of the countryside.

1795
01:58:03,244 --> 01:58:03,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying.

1796
01:58:04,404 --> 01:58:06,685
[SPEAKER_14]: How about that whole Hobbit going into three movies?

1797
01:58:07,668 --> 01:58:08,408
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited.

1798
01:58:09,649 --> 01:58:11,971
[SPEAKER_05]: I read The Hobbit when I was a kid and I freaking love that book.

1799
01:58:11,991 --> 01:58:13,371
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess they have enough to fill it with.

1800
01:58:13,431 --> 01:58:13,631
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1801
01:58:14,072 --> 01:58:14,352
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah?

1802
01:58:14,692 --> 01:58:14,892
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1803
01:58:14,932 --> 01:58:15,092
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1804
01:58:16,473 --> 01:58:17,594
[SPEAKER_02]: That's three movies I don't have to see.

1805
01:58:19,557 --> 01:58:20,658
[SPEAKER_14]: I like the original Lord of the Rings.

1806
01:58:20,718 --> 01:58:21,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's go to Facebook.

1807
01:58:21,739 --> 01:58:23,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I love the whole original 20 ending.

1808
01:58:23,480 --> 01:58:24,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Princess Bride.

1809
01:58:24,561 --> 01:58:25,062
[SPEAKER_14]: There's something.

1810
01:58:25,162 --> 01:58:25,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go to Facebook.

1811
01:58:25,962 --> 01:58:26,543
[SPEAKER_14]: This might surprise you.

1812
01:58:26,583 --> 01:58:30,006
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, games you didn't fall in love with until second or third time you played it.

1813
01:58:30,506 --> 01:58:30,966
[SPEAKER_14]: Shane.

1814
01:58:31,026 --> 01:58:31,727
[SPEAKER_14]: Y'all know Shane.

1815
01:58:32,187 --> 01:58:33,448
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be in chat.

1816
01:58:33,729 --> 01:58:35,350
[SPEAKER_14]: I think he's rating or something tonight.

1817
01:58:35,650 --> 01:58:36,691
[SPEAKER_14]: This answer might surprise you.

1818
01:58:36,991 --> 01:58:37,552
[SPEAKER_14]: Mass Effect.

1819
01:58:37,972 --> 01:58:38,493
[SPEAKER_14]: No joke.

1820
01:58:39,153 --> 01:58:43,716
[SPEAKER_14]: Way back when the first game was on Xbox 360, I gave it a go because of all the things people were saying.

1821
01:58:44,016 --> 01:58:46,558
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't make it past Eden Prime before I decided it was dumb.

1822
01:58:47,018 --> 01:58:51,962
[SPEAKER_14]: Years later, I got a free copy of 2 on PC for buying Dragon Age 2, so I gave it a go and thought it was pretty eh.

1823
01:58:52,402 --> 01:58:56,344
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't even get much farther than the opening escape from the Cerberus base before I just quit caring.

1824
01:58:56,885 --> 01:59:01,588
[SPEAKER_14]: A short time later, I picked up the first game because I figured I should have the collection on PC for some reason.

1825
01:59:01,928 --> 01:59:04,290
[SPEAKER_14]: I made it past Eden Prime this time, but again, didn't care.

1826
01:59:04,890 --> 01:59:07,794
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the trailers for Mass Effect 3 came out and I thought it looked so cool.

1827
01:59:08,114 --> 01:59:10,897
[SPEAKER_14]: I forced myself to get in the first game and something just clicked.

1828
01:59:11,258 --> 01:59:13,120
[SPEAKER_14]: It was amazing and I couldn't stop playing.

1829
01:59:13,460 --> 01:59:15,623
[SPEAKER_14]: And then things made much more sense in 2.

1830
01:59:16,003 --> 01:59:16,904
[SPEAKER_14]: It was fantastic.

1831
01:59:17,244 --> 01:59:19,447
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's how I came to love the greatest game series ever.

1832
01:59:19,707 --> 01:59:20,548
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Mass Effect.

1833
01:59:22,210 --> 01:59:22,611
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

1834
01:59:23,011 --> 01:59:24,052
[SPEAKER_14]: Osfer replied and said...

1835
01:59:24,933 --> 01:59:25,294
[SPEAKER_14]: Going to Mary.

1836
01:59:42,154 --> 01:59:44,215
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay for second chances and wow

1837
02:00:09,463 --> 02:00:29,344
[SPEAKER_14]: Cody T replies it would probably have to be the Call of Duty games I tried to play them a long time ago and never really understood why people thought they were so fun until I had a child and didn't get as much time to play video games and those games multiplayer wise are easy to pick up and play for 5 or 10 minutes and another is Borderlands for the same reason I'm not that good at FPS games lol

1838
02:00:30,405 --> 02:00:31,266
[SPEAKER_14]: Ragenator says,

1839
02:00:53,185 --> 02:00:53,545
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

1840
02:00:53,745 --> 02:00:54,786
[SPEAKER_14]: Degenerate Johnny says,

1841
02:01:21,454 --> 02:01:22,315
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

1842
02:01:40,183 --> 02:01:40,423
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura.

1843
02:01:40,463 --> 02:01:40,523
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

1844
02:01:56,817 --> 02:01:57,338
[SPEAKER_14]: Easy for you.

1845
02:01:57,358 --> 02:01:57,798
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1846
02:01:57,898 --> 02:02:04,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, moving off of WoW, because honestly it was really until they tweaked the gameplay to where I liked it.

1847
02:02:05,003 --> 02:02:08,945
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually going to add Mass Effect on the list because I'd watched Dan play through it at first.

1848
02:02:09,386 --> 02:02:10,586
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, oh, this is kind of boring.

1849
02:02:10,606 --> 02:02:11,767
[SPEAKER_05]: First person shooters make me sick.

1850
02:02:11,827 --> 02:02:12,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1851
02:02:13,488 --> 02:02:21,413
[SPEAKER_05]: and honestly, I had a hard time getting into it on Xbox until I started playing on PC and then, boom, all the way through the game, all the way through the second one, all the way through the third one.

1852
02:02:21,773 --> 02:02:23,434
[SPEAKER_05]: I beat all three games in the span of a month.

1853
02:02:24,074 --> 02:02:24,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying.

1854
02:02:25,455 --> 02:02:26,796
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm still playing Mass Effect 3 again.

1855
02:02:27,917 --> 02:02:28,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki?

1856
02:02:29,518 --> 02:02:30,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Call of Duty Modern Warfare.

1857
02:02:32,239 --> 02:02:33,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't like it the first time I played it.

1858
02:02:33,540 --> 02:02:34,300
[SPEAKER_14]: What clicked for you?

1859
02:02:34,701 --> 02:02:35,021
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1860
02:02:37,296 --> 02:03:04,814
[SPEAKER_14]: something uh for me most of mine have already been said believe it or not World of Warcraft the first time I played it I left for a while didn't end up coming back till Burning Crusade and then that's when I fell in love with it um Mass Effect is a big one because I played that and you know passed off my review of it sometime excuse me some time ago and then just came back and loved it and I don't even know what clicked I think I just I played from the beginning instead of in the middle and that made a huge difference yeah

1861
02:03:05,638 --> 02:03:06,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, you know what I have to say?

1862
02:03:07,220 --> 02:03:07,561
[SPEAKER_14]: Geras.

1863
02:03:09,203 --> 02:03:10,625
[SPEAKER_14]: Minecraft is another big one.

1864
02:03:10,946 --> 02:03:16,314
[SPEAKER_14]: If I have to name one that hasn't been named yet, maybe you'll come sometime.

1865
02:03:16,354 --> 02:03:18,517
[SPEAKER_04]: I've tried Minecraft and I really do not care for it.

1866
02:03:18,617 --> 02:03:19,038
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see.

1867
02:03:20,159 --> 02:03:21,481
[SPEAKER_14]: I would say Halo.

1868
02:03:22,382 --> 02:03:41,716
[SPEAKER_14]: Halo I didn't like the first time I played it because like first person shooter controller but it was the first time I did an LAN local area network because remember the first Halo wasn't on Xbox Live it wasn't around yet when I played that first Halo in a local area network oh it was awesome so awesome Bradley anything that comes to mind for you

1869
02:03:42,524 --> 02:03:45,425
[SPEAKER_10]: There's nothing I can say that's all the way.

1870
02:03:45,485 --> 02:03:47,106
[SPEAKER_10]: I hated it to have loved it.

1871
02:03:47,206 --> 02:03:48,907
[SPEAKER_10]: But there was one game I played.

1872
02:03:49,107 --> 02:03:51,868
[SPEAKER_10]: I started the game Adam Zombie Smasher.

1873
02:03:51,908 --> 02:03:55,009
[SPEAKER_10]: I played a demo of it at PAX last year.

1874
02:03:55,629 --> 02:03:59,291
[SPEAKER_10]: And there was a guy there that kind of threw you in, and I didn't know how to play it.

1875
02:03:59,371 --> 02:04:01,732
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I said, I don't feel like playing this game.

1876
02:04:02,232 --> 02:04:04,493
[SPEAKER_10]: But it came up in one of the Humble bundles, and I tried to play it.

1877
02:04:04,993 --> 02:04:07,814
[SPEAKER_10]: And it starts you off from just doing one thing rather than several things.

1878
02:04:07,914 --> 02:04:09,575
[SPEAKER_10]: So I basically...

1879
02:04:10,356 --> 02:04:14,326
[SPEAKER_10]: Got into it for a little while when I played it there and went through and beat the game.

1880
02:04:14,968 --> 02:04:18,717
[SPEAKER_10]: That was one that came with I don't care to actually like the game pretty well.

1881
02:04:20,566 --> 02:04:21,407
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, very cool.

1882
02:04:22,067 --> 02:04:22,468
[SPEAKER_14]: Very cool.

1883
02:04:22,488 --> 02:04:27,211
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, thank you guys again for answering on Facebook and Google, and of course, those of y'all here in studio.

1884
02:04:29,353 --> 02:04:36,059
[SPEAKER_14]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com, use the passphrase SUGAR.

1885
02:04:36,879 --> 02:04:38,421
[SPEAKER_14]: We will continue on with some news.

1886
02:04:38,521 --> 02:04:44,886
[SPEAKER_14]: We do have the Mailbag, FUs of the Week, and Twitter topics, Skype line, all those ways to interact coming right up.

1887
02:04:44,926 --> 02:04:46,187
[SPEAKER_14]: But first, more news.

1888
02:04:46,447 --> 02:04:46,707
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki.

1889
02:04:47,788 --> 02:04:53,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so let's talk a little bit about Steam.

1890
02:04:54,377 --> 02:04:59,023
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know I purchased a few things on the Steam sale during the summer here.

1891
02:05:00,244 --> 02:05:03,448
[SPEAKER_02]: I did also happen to see the update to the...

1892
02:05:05,888 --> 02:05:07,829
[SPEAKER_02]: The terms of service that they have.

1893
02:05:08,629 --> 02:05:17,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they have you agree to a Steam subscriber agreement that basically bars you from filing a class action lawsuit.

1894
02:05:20,332 --> 02:05:22,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of similar to what we saw with Sony and Microsoft.

1895
02:05:23,933 --> 02:05:43,403
[SPEAKER_02]: and of course you know they said we've considered this change very carefully it's clear to us in some situations class actions have the real benefit to the consumer in far too many cases however class actions don't provide any real benefit to users and instead impose unnecessary expense and delay and are often designed to benefit the class action lawyers who craft and litigate these claims

1896
02:05:45,322 --> 02:06:14,334
[SPEAKER_14]: you know I gotta say at least it was a very honest as far as corporate can be a very honest letter which you know we kind of Valve's been pretty good about communicating with their community they really have you know especially through some of the other you know like when they were hacked and all that they were pretty transparent with all that and that it's happening here too I don't know how I feel about this I mean obviously this is the trend in the gaming industry I gotta admit there's still a part of me that wonders if that can really hold up in court

1897
02:06:15,354 --> 02:06:18,939
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand they're doing it to cover their butts but can it really hold up in court?

1898
02:06:18,999 --> 02:06:19,940
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it's been tested yet.

1899
02:06:19,960 --> 02:06:24,165
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still file a lawsuit against them but you just can't do it as a group.

1900
02:06:25,481 --> 02:06:29,624
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, but I'm just saying, does that necessarily stop it?

1901
02:06:30,265 --> 02:06:34,788
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, do they have the power to put that in agreement and force you to agree to that?

1902
02:06:35,128 --> 02:06:37,350
[SPEAKER_14]: You're waiving your right to sue us a group?

1903
02:06:37,851 --> 02:06:40,513
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm surprised that hasn't been tested yet, and I think it will be.

1904
02:06:40,533 --> 02:06:46,577
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think it's going to be a little bit difficult with them, too, because you bought all these games.

1905
02:06:46,898 --> 02:06:47,838
[SPEAKER_02]: They give you no warning.

1906
02:06:48,459 --> 02:06:52,362
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess it would be in the end-user license agreement that, oh, you can change this at any time.

1907
02:06:52,862 --> 02:06:56,104
[SPEAKER_02]: All of a sudden, no, I can't use these games unless I agree to this.

1908
02:06:56,645 --> 02:06:59,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think that a judge would see that as unreasonable.

1909
02:07:01,688 --> 02:07:11,855
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't expect to just all of a sudden cut off the service that this user has paid for because you just put this clause in place that they don't want to agree to all of a sudden.

1910
02:07:12,235 --> 02:07:13,817
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of ridiculous.

1911
02:07:13,837 --> 02:07:14,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1912
02:07:15,104 --> 02:07:20,525
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess there's that part of me that says, why do we let corporations dictate what rights we do and don't have?

1913
02:07:20,605 --> 02:07:25,187
[SPEAKER_14]: And I totally understand the viewpoint of, well, then don't agree to it or whatever.

1914
02:07:25,267 --> 02:07:32,848
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, didn't somebody say – maybe I saw it on Reddit or something or saw it somewhere where somebody was like, well, what happens if I don't agree to it?

1915
02:07:32,888 --> 02:07:34,369
[SPEAKER_14]: Do I get to access my games anymore?

1916
02:07:34,389 --> 02:07:35,589
[SPEAKER_14]: And the answer was essentially no.

1917
02:07:36,729 --> 02:07:40,290
[SPEAKER_14]: So would that hold up in court?

1918
02:07:40,450 --> 02:07:41,230
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not so sure.

1919
02:07:42,931 --> 02:07:43,831
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess maybe I'm just –

1920
02:07:45,205 --> 02:07:47,167
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, trying to root for the little guy or whatever.

1921
02:08:03,723 --> 02:08:04,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1922
02:08:19,093 --> 02:08:25,676
[SPEAKER_02]: So that I don't really understand if that's the case, but like something that they force you to read every time you play the game or something like that.

1923
02:08:25,976 --> 02:08:26,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, maybe.

1924
02:08:27,077 --> 02:08:28,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know how it works.

1925
02:08:28,578 --> 02:08:33,100
[SPEAKER_14]: GameGuru in chat, good point from GameGuru at live.vognetwork.com, says it has been tested.

1926
02:08:33,140 --> 02:08:38,863
[SPEAKER_14]: The Supreme Court ruled for them, hence why everyone's added no class action lawsuits clauses.

1927
02:08:39,940 --> 02:09:08,273
[SPEAKER_14]: that's right I think it was an AT&T thing if I remember right I totally understand that but I just think if something bad enough happens it's really going to put this to the test and maybe that particular scenario wasn't the right scenario I totally understand why they want to block all this frivolous lawsuit crap and there are a lot of very frivolous class action lawsuits I get that but if something really bad happens I don't know maybe there's that tinfoil hat part of me that wonders why does Valve feel the need to do this

1928
02:09:09,847 --> 02:09:11,047
[SPEAKER_14]: What news is about to come out?

1929
02:09:12,728 --> 02:09:16,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's the whole lawsuit that was in Europe.

1930
02:09:17,149 --> 02:09:17,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps.

1931
02:09:17,889 --> 02:09:20,609
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole, you know, use games thing.

1932
02:09:20,669 --> 02:09:23,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they're just trying to prevent something like that happening over here.

1933
02:09:23,350 --> 02:09:23,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1934
02:09:24,370 --> 02:09:24,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting thought.

1935
02:09:26,191 --> 02:09:29,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did you make me buy so many cheap games during the summer sale?

1936
02:09:29,771 --> 02:09:32,712
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to sue you because I'm irresponsible.

1937
02:09:34,218 --> 02:09:36,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we'll see what develops with this as we move on.

1938
02:09:36,360 --> 02:09:43,686
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, most people are pretty forgiving of Steam, but certainly there's going to be a few people like that guy who tried to get around it.

1939
02:09:43,746 --> 02:09:45,527
[SPEAKER_14]: Was there a postcard clause or any of that?

1940
02:09:45,547 --> 02:09:46,168
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think there was.

1941
02:09:48,232 --> 02:09:49,113
[SPEAKER_14]: EASports Season Ticket Free DLC

1942
02:10:08,892 --> 02:10:14,333
[SPEAKER_14]: You get free packs of cards for Madden, FIFA, and NHL Ultimate Team Modes.

1943
02:10:14,793 --> 02:10:17,134
[SPEAKER_14]: Do the sports games work like Mass Effect 3?

1944
02:10:17,754 --> 02:10:24,596
[SPEAKER_14]: Where you open up the boxes and get cards and they are like... Like in Mass Effect 3, it's weapons and team members and stuff.

1945
02:10:24,676 --> 02:10:25,116
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that?

1946
02:10:25,256 --> 02:10:25,456
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1947
02:10:25,736 --> 02:10:26,796
[SPEAKER_14]: Because that's another EA game.

1948
02:10:26,856 --> 02:10:26,996
[SPEAKER_14]: No?

1949
02:10:28,096 --> 02:10:28,676
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to be honest.

1950
02:10:28,696 --> 02:10:29,417
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't play these games.

1951
02:10:29,457 --> 02:10:31,297
[SPEAKER_14]: So what is this card thing in Madden?

1952
02:10:31,977 --> 02:10:35,718
[SPEAKER_02]: The card thing in Madden is for... Remember how there was the whole FIFA hacks?

1953
02:10:35,738 --> 02:10:35,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1954
02:10:36,379 --> 02:10:37,885
[SPEAKER_02]: They have that, the ultimate team thing?

1955
02:10:37,905 --> 02:10:38,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1956
02:10:39,049 --> 02:10:40,113
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the Madden version of it.

1957
02:10:40,253 --> 02:10:41,297
[SPEAKER_14]: What do those cards get you?

1958
02:10:41,730 --> 02:10:42,310
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

1959
02:11:10,146 --> 02:11:20,651
[SPEAKER_02]: A few days before they would come out, you would get a digital version that you would play, and then you'd go purchase the real game on the release day, and then that digital version would stop working.

1960
02:11:21,831 --> 02:11:29,175
[SPEAKER_14]: Other things the season ticket had done in the past, early access to full titles that got deleted when the games were actually released.

1961
02:11:29,915 --> 02:11:30,275
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting.

1962
02:11:31,115 --> 02:11:33,957
[SPEAKER_14]: And it used to be discounts on premium content, but now it's...

1963
02:11:34,777 --> 02:11:35,317
[SPEAKER_14]: A little different.

1964
02:11:35,378 --> 02:11:41,161
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying, though, that the only way you'd actually be able to pay for it is if you bought all of the DLC.

1965
02:11:41,881 --> 02:11:43,302
[SPEAKER_14]: Which I'm sure they'd love to have you do.

1966
02:11:44,763 --> 02:11:46,804
[SPEAKER_14]: SJ100Matt says, Rob, yep, you are correct.

1967
02:11:46,864 --> 02:11:48,585
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the same thing in the NHL games now.

1968
02:11:49,045 --> 02:11:56,350
[SPEAKER_14]: BlackWolf says, you can use real money to buy new cards, but there was an in-game auction house that uses the point system that you get for playing Ultimate Team.

1969
02:11:57,070 --> 02:12:02,073
[SPEAKER_14]: Live.VogNetwork.com And Monty Boggs, great comment, hard to call it free if it costs $30. $30.

1970
02:12:04,074 --> 02:12:26,973
[SPEAKER_14]: that is true it's like PlayStation Plus but I see I like PlayStation Plus I think PlayStation Plus that whole thing's really come a long way and it's got a lot of value I gotta say it's interesting interesting we'll see how many people sign up for it I'm sure there's enough if they're continuing into a second year from the first year meanwhile some more news stories for you guys DarkSakura

1971
02:12:27,364 --> 02:12:27,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1972
02:12:28,105 --> 02:12:37,370
[SPEAKER_05]: In other news, we actually have some Mass Effect goodies about the Wii U, which is kind of eye-rolly every time I think of the Wii U, but I'll go ahead.

1973
02:12:38,531 --> 02:12:45,796
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to basically have touchscreen controls so that you can see a map of your immediate areas where your squad mates are and where the enemies are highlighted.

1974
02:12:46,716 --> 02:13:13,082
[SPEAKER_05]: you have four powers and abilities that are on each side of the gamepad screen so you can just select one without having to go to your quick menu although honestly my quick menu is my friend I'm like pause hold this pause basically it was also at the EA Summer Showcase where they had the first viewing of Mass Effect 3 on Wii U but the graphics are pretty much going to be the same as how they were on the PS3 and Xbox 360 version

1975
02:13:14,242 --> 02:13:15,123
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1976
02:13:32,085 --> 02:13:34,427
[SPEAKER_14]: That's good to know, because we wanted to know how that was going to work.

1977
02:13:34,527 --> 02:13:36,789
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, how are they going to catch the Nintendo fans up?

1978
02:13:37,349 --> 02:13:39,031
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this is the thing that makes me happy.

1979
02:13:39,631 --> 02:13:40,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Mass Effect 3 Leviathan.

1980
02:13:41,052 --> 02:13:44,075
[SPEAKER_05]: There's Reaper DLC that's going to come out.

1981
02:13:44,355 --> 02:13:46,157
[SPEAKER_05]: You get to shoot Reapers in the face.

1982
02:13:47,077 --> 02:13:48,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm looking forward to shooting a Reaper in the face.

1983
02:13:49,639 --> 02:13:52,041
[SPEAKER_14]: It's about time for some single-player DLC, too.

1984
02:13:52,101 --> 02:13:56,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, I realize the whole extended cut set everything back, but I've been foaming at the mouth for DLC.

1985
02:13:56,685 --> 02:13:58,166
[SPEAKER_14]: It's almost been six months since the game came out.

1986
02:13:58,186 --> 02:13:59,988
[SPEAKER_05]: But they were saying that it's supposed to also affect the ending.

1987
02:14:01,511 --> 02:14:02,251
[SPEAKER_14]: I can see that.

1988
02:14:02,391 --> 02:14:04,091
[SPEAKER_14]: Like maybe an extra little cutaway or something.

1989
02:14:04,172 --> 02:14:07,392
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it's going to be like a five second cutaway or something.

1990
02:14:07,752 --> 02:14:08,792
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it'll be anything major.

1991
02:14:08,812 --> 02:14:12,113
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just trying to see when the release date for that one was.

1992
02:14:12,233 --> 02:14:14,353
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had seen it before and completely missed it.

1993
02:14:15,474 --> 02:14:18,754
[SPEAKER_05]: But in fact, I'm double checking.

1994
02:14:19,114 --> 02:14:24,215
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's what I really want to know about the Reaper ending or this Leviathan based ending without spoiling too much.

1995
02:14:24,655 --> 02:14:27,916
[SPEAKER_14]: Will you still cry when Edie dot dot dot

1996
02:14:29,384 --> 02:14:30,627
[SPEAKER_05]: I cried so much.

1997
02:14:30,907 --> 02:14:35,796
[SPEAKER_05]: But I more cried over Garrus, because keep in mind... Keep in mind, I started with the extended cut.

1998
02:14:36,946 --> 02:14:37,506
[SPEAKER_05]: When I played it.

1999
02:14:37,967 --> 02:14:40,909
[SPEAKER_05]: And the whole little goodbye part on the Normandy.

2000
02:14:43,691 --> 02:14:45,853
[SPEAKER_14]: I just, like, I'm not going to spoil anything.

2001
02:14:45,913 --> 02:14:47,014
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's not, I will say this.

2002
02:14:47,094 --> 02:14:48,675
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not talking about dies.

2003
02:14:48,735 --> 02:14:50,417
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, I know a lot of people are like, oh, great, Rob.

2004
02:14:50,457 --> 02:14:50,877
[SPEAKER_14]: It's dies.

2005
02:14:50,937 --> 02:14:51,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope, that's not it.

2006
02:14:52,198 --> 02:14:54,059
[SPEAKER_14]: If you've beaten the game, you know what I'm talking about.

2007
02:14:54,260 --> 02:14:58,863
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the particular endings, there's a moment when Edie and dot, dot, dot.

2008
02:14:59,143 --> 02:14:59,824
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's like, oh.

2009
02:15:03,126 --> 02:15:03,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2010
02:15:04,067 --> 02:15:05,048
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a little bit of a klempt.

2011
02:15:06,024 --> 02:15:16,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they said on here also that they actually said there were some things leaked in the script that actually link it to the extended cut.

2012
02:15:19,400 --> 02:15:19,740
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2013
02:15:20,061 --> 02:15:20,301
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki.

2014
02:15:20,321 --> 02:15:20,401
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki.

2015
02:15:22,099 --> 02:15:24,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Patents Connect Patents

2016
02:15:37,501 --> 02:15:44,590
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of weird, too, because this patent basically allows taking Kinect, I guess, into mobile cameras.

2017
02:15:45,091 --> 02:15:51,899
[SPEAKER_02]: So allowing you to use your phone or something like that to basically scan people into...

2018
02:15:53,593 --> 02:15:54,094
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura,

2019
02:16:15,657 --> 02:16:34,393
[SPEAKER_02]: and they said the visual mapping isn't enough the camera relies on motion sensor like an accelerometer to better judge its position as it's moved around and that's interesting does this mean the next Windows phone is going to have Kinect built in for no particular reason but maybe to take like a 3D picture of my face

2020
02:16:35,450 --> 02:16:35,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

2021
02:16:36,210 --> 02:16:44,314
[SPEAKER_02]: They also filed another patent that basically uses the Kinect for, I guess, directing movies.

2022
02:16:44,354 --> 02:16:49,836
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use your hands to gesture to do different movie editing stuff.

2023
02:16:50,957 --> 02:16:59,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I guess, the depth camera both generates the model environment and also creates 3D props out of real objects, so augmented reality stuff.

2024
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:03,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion capture and, I guess...

2025
02:17:06,158 --> 02:17:08,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing other augmented reality stuff.

2026
02:17:09,119 --> 02:17:12,901
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of neat.

2027
02:17:13,482 --> 02:17:13,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

2028
02:17:15,142 --> 02:17:19,544
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a lot of people have been trying to do video stuff with a lot of augmented reality stuff.

2029
02:17:20,165 --> 02:17:31,270
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would kind of tie in with the supposedly leaked plan or their timeline or whatever that they were planning on doing in the next system with all that crazy Kinect stuff.

2030
02:17:34,740 --> 02:17:45,468
[SPEAKER_14]: DJ Morpheus in our chatroom says, I would love to have the ability to have my in-game character look like me via image capture.

2031
02:17:45,788 --> 02:17:49,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't they have that on the 3DS, and doesn't it not work very well?

2032
02:17:50,691 --> 02:17:52,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, pretty much.

2033
02:17:52,873 --> 02:17:57,576
[SPEAKER_14]: But the 3DS, remember, it has that front camera, but the front's not 3D, only the back.

2034
02:17:57,816 --> 02:18:00,097
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, there's three cameras in the 3DS, if you think about it.

2035
02:18:00,198 --> 02:18:02,019
[SPEAKER_14]: One in the front, two in the back for 3D images.

2036
02:18:02,459 --> 02:18:03,640
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a little, you know.

2037
02:18:05,330 --> 02:18:16,205
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyhow, speaking of Nintendo and patents, I don't know if you guys remember this, but Copper Innovations Group filed a lawsuit against Nintendo.

2038
02:18:16,225 --> 02:18:17,627
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a patent lawsuit back in 2008.

2039
02:18:19,915 --> 02:18:21,436
[SPEAKER_14]: and it's just now over.

2040
02:18:21,917 --> 02:18:34,827
[SPEAKER_14]: To remind you, because you probably forgot, Copper Innovations Group claimed that the Wiimote and the Wii console infringed on a 1996 patent for quote, handheld computer input apparatus and method.

2041
02:18:36,729 --> 02:18:37,770
[SPEAKER_14]: This looks like a mouse.

2042
02:18:38,110 --> 02:18:39,532
[SPEAKER_14]: You look at the little figures, whatever.

2043
02:18:39,632 --> 02:18:42,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, Pittsburgh U.S.

2044
02:18:42,234 --> 02:18:49,481
[SPEAKER_14]: District Court basically found it in Nintendo's favor, halting the need for a jury trial.

2045
02:18:50,422 --> 02:18:54,887
[SPEAKER_14]: Nintendo, of course, is pleased with the decision and thanks their legal team and so forth.

2046
02:18:54,947 --> 02:18:58,750
[SPEAKER_14]: I think most of us saw this as a patent troll type of thing.

2047
02:19:00,182 --> 02:19:01,643
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of these type of lawsuits.

2048
02:19:01,703 --> 02:19:05,125
[SPEAKER_14]: That took four years to resolve and it hadn't even gone to jury yet.

2049
02:19:05,225 --> 02:19:07,027
[SPEAKER_14]: It actually got cut off before it went to jury.

2050
02:19:07,087 --> 02:19:10,269
[SPEAKER_14]: The judge basically said, nah, nah.

2051
02:19:12,210 --> 02:19:12,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Amazing.

2052
02:19:13,791 --> 02:19:16,213
[SPEAKER_14]: The legal system in this country is so interesting.

2053
02:19:18,754 --> 02:19:22,937
[SPEAKER_14]: I know I'm not a lawyer, but that doesn't stop everybody on the internet from pretending to be one.

2054
02:19:24,598 --> 02:19:25,979
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's get to the mailbag.

2055
02:19:26,480 --> 02:19:26,920
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, joy.

2056
02:19:26,940 --> 02:19:27,620
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, joy.

2057
02:19:29,833 --> 02:19:32,094
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see what homemade lawyers we have.

2058
02:19:32,114 --> 02:19:32,494
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, boy.

2059
02:19:33,294 --> 02:19:35,775
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what is wrong with my talking ability lately.

2060
02:19:36,175 --> 02:19:36,455
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2061
02:19:36,575 --> 02:19:37,575
[SPEAKER_05]: You are speaking English good.

2062
02:19:38,236 --> 02:19:38,716
[SPEAKER_14]: Clearly.

2063
02:19:38,736 --> 02:19:39,336
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2064
02:19:39,396 --> 02:19:40,196
[SPEAKER_14]: Slow down, Rob.

2065
02:19:40,276 --> 02:19:40,536
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2066
02:19:41,057 --> 02:19:44,858
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to go to the mailbag and see what homemade lawyers we have in the email bag this week.

2067
02:19:44,918 --> 02:19:48,859
[SPEAKER_14]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to email the show.

2068
02:19:49,341 --> 02:19:57,885
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to start with one from Steven W. Home does get a bad rep from how it used to be back in the day to what it is currently going down with its updates.

2069
02:19:58,225 --> 02:20:04,628
[SPEAKER_05]: With the recent updates and fixes, they have pushed out some really good content and finally fixed the glitch that allowed users freezing others.

2070
02:20:05,228 --> 02:20:06,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Does Home still have its issues?

2071
02:20:06,709 --> 02:20:11,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Why, yes it does, but it does what comes when software is still in beta.

2072
02:20:11,991 --> 02:20:13,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, this is very run-on sentency.

2073
02:20:14,152 --> 02:20:16,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Home is constantly evolving, and with evolution comes bugs.

2074
02:20:17,373 --> 02:20:24,134
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look past those bugs and look at the community, the atmosphere surrounding it, and all of the events slash games within Home, you see how epic it is.

2075
02:20:24,834 --> 02:20:28,996
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, Home gets a bad rep, but it has a lot of good inside of it.

2076
02:20:29,536 --> 02:20:30,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Who does it?

2077
02:20:30,096 --> 02:20:30,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it like a pinata?

2078
02:20:31,696 --> 02:20:34,717
[SPEAKER_05]: So everyone should hop on and check it out, even if it's for a few moments.

2079
02:20:35,977 --> 02:20:37,598
[SPEAKER_05]: If I beat it with a stick, will candy come out?

2080
02:20:38,378 --> 02:20:38,418
No.

2081
02:20:38,838 --> 02:20:39,359
[SPEAKER_14]: Possibly.

2082
02:20:39,779 --> 02:20:41,500
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody won a $20 gift card last week.

2083
02:20:42,361 --> 02:20:43,382
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, that had nothing.

2084
02:20:43,642 --> 02:20:45,063
[SPEAKER_14]: That was not Sony sanction.

2085
02:20:45,163 --> 02:20:48,105
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a generous fan helping another generous fan out.

2086
02:20:48,506 --> 02:20:49,887
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm glad to see... Good.

2087
02:20:50,207 --> 02:20:55,071
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad some people followed through because I don't know if you remember, but during... Hey, it's not time for the FUs yet.

2088
02:20:55,111 --> 02:20:55,411
[SPEAKER_14]: Be quiet.

2089
02:20:55,851 --> 02:20:59,134
[SPEAKER_14]: During last week's show, I actually asked all those guys in PlayStation Home.

2090
02:20:59,194 --> 02:21:00,795
[SPEAKER_14]: I said, does your network get a bad rap?

2091
02:21:01,115 --> 02:21:02,096
[SPEAKER_14]: Does home get a bad rap?

2092
02:21:02,717 --> 02:21:04,898
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm glad somebody followed through with that.

2093
02:21:04,958 --> 02:21:05,799
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for replying.

2094
02:21:06,331 --> 02:21:06,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2095
02:21:07,413 --> 02:21:08,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, moving forward.

2096
02:21:09,157 --> 02:21:09,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

2097
02:21:09,698 --> 02:21:10,901
[SPEAKER_05]: This is from Nasty Canesta.

2098
02:21:12,854 --> 02:21:13,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, OLR.

2099
02:21:13,575 --> 02:21:16,076
[SPEAKER_14]: One of my favorite nicknames, by the way, that emails the show.

2100
02:21:16,277 --> 02:21:17,778
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I think about the card game Canasta.

2101
02:21:17,798 --> 02:21:18,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

2102
02:21:18,158 --> 02:21:18,958
[SPEAKER_05]: I think of old people.

2103
02:21:19,039 --> 02:21:21,921
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like strip Canasta or something.

2104
02:21:21,941 --> 02:21:22,901
[SPEAKER_14]: It's time to get nasty.

2105
02:21:23,642 --> 02:21:29,987
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if you covered this before, but you might be interested in a teaser for an upcoming PC first-person horror game called Among the Sleep.

2106
02:21:30,447 --> 02:21:32,548
[SPEAKER_05]: The protagonist for Among the Sleep is a two-year-old.

2107
02:21:33,209 --> 02:21:39,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Aside from the utter helplessness you have to deal with playing as this poor toddler, imagine if you also had to struggle with the baby's current developmental stage.

2108
02:21:40,214 --> 02:21:46,183
[SPEAKER_05]: How could the game screw with you if this kid didn't grasp the concept of object permanence yet?

2109
02:21:46,463 --> 02:21:46,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Scary!

2110
02:21:47,344 --> 02:21:47,605
[SPEAKER_05]: P.S.

2111
02:21:47,745 --> 02:21:48,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Garris?

2112
02:21:49,467 --> 02:21:51,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think a two-year-old understands object permanence better.

2113
02:21:54,516 --> 02:21:55,777
[SPEAKER_14]: says the parent of a two-year-old.

2114
02:21:55,797 --> 02:22:03,160
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually peeked in the mailbag earlier and I watched the little trailer for this thing and it looks creepy as hell.

2115
02:22:03,880 --> 02:22:07,622
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's a weird concept for a game to me.

2116
02:22:08,122 --> 02:22:10,463
[SPEAKER_14]: When you do things about children, that's always a little creepy.

2117
02:22:10,763 --> 02:22:12,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'd like to stay away from that.

2118
02:22:12,303 --> 02:22:14,844
[SPEAKER_14]: At least the child doesn't get eaten by a grue or something.

2119
02:22:14,904 --> 02:22:18,866
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just, you know, it was a scary looking game, I gotta say.

2120
02:22:20,226 --> 02:22:21,527
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like amnesia level scary.

2121
02:22:23,171 --> 02:22:25,933
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2122
02:22:44,085 --> 02:23:07,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Armadillo which I don't think came out in the US and then Panic Restaurant which actually that is the US release and I went to find because I only remembered like half of the name because it was something Gourmet World it was One Paku Koku no Gourmet World and it came out in 1992 and was published by Taito where you play as a guy named Cookie who looks like Chef Boyardee

2123
02:23:08,556 --> 02:23:10,557
[SPEAKER_14]: Not to be confused with the announcer from You Don't Know Jack.

2124
02:23:10,838 --> 02:23:19,103
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of those games that had one of those classic things of mistranslation of a name because the bad guy in the game was called O'Durf.

2125
02:23:20,384 --> 02:23:21,845
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was French to Japanese.

2126
02:23:22,245 --> 02:23:25,888
[SPEAKER_05]: So when it came to translating it from Japanese to English, they called him O'Duff.

2127
02:23:27,089 --> 02:23:27,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Ha ha!

2128
02:23:30,348 --> 02:23:31,028
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2129
02:23:46,737 --> 02:24:03,663
[SPEAKER_05]: it was a neat little game and it was by Sakura and then Armadillo was sort of like Super Mario 3 where you had like a map that you could move from world to world I know of all three of those games so yeah good job dude you can send me your copy of Armadillo if you want I'll play the fuck out of it

2130
02:24:05,223 --> 02:24:09,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so, uh, this is let me know your opinion and happy podcasting.

2131
02:24:09,926 --> 02:24:11,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Banana Prince is pretty, pretty fun.

2132
02:24:12,587 --> 02:24:13,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Armadillo is pretty fun.

2133
02:24:14,528 --> 02:24:18,030
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually did not play Panic Restaurant, but I've seen it.

2134
02:24:18,810 --> 02:24:21,872
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen, I know someone who had Panic Restaurant when I was younger.

2135
02:24:22,072 --> 02:24:24,273
[SPEAKER_05]: So just saying, I didn't get into it.

2136
02:24:25,720 --> 02:24:27,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, moving forward, shall I?

2137
02:24:28,422 --> 02:24:29,923
[SPEAKER_05]: This comes from Clover Nikon.

2138
02:24:30,904 --> 02:24:34,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi guys and gal, just writing in to say that I am loving the show and loving the VOG Network.

2139
02:24:35,347 --> 02:24:38,669
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not been on the VOG site as much as I would like to due to my two jobs.

2140
02:24:39,529 --> 02:24:48,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, today, August 6th, is my one year wedding anniversary and unfortunately my beautiful wife Lisa has to work so I'm spending my morning here with my friends at the VOG Network while I do CG renders.

2141
02:24:49,317 --> 02:24:52,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, Lisa is playing Fable 2 Star Wars Connect and will soon play Mass Effect 2.

2142
02:24:52,904 --> 02:24:55,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Hope everyone has a great evening and keep up the great radio.

2143
02:24:56,110 --> 02:24:56,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Sent from my iPhone.

2144
02:24:58,555 --> 02:24:59,698
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, happy anniversary.

2145
02:25:00,475 --> 02:25:01,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay, anniversaries are great.

2146
02:25:01,335 --> 02:25:06,777
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry to hear that, you know, somebody's having to work during it, but, you know, you've got to make the money.

2147
02:25:07,397 --> 02:25:08,038
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how it works.

2148
02:25:08,198 --> 02:25:08,458
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2149
02:25:08,958 --> 02:25:09,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Next email.

2150
02:25:09,658 --> 02:25:10,178
[SPEAKER_05]: We have two more.

2151
02:25:10,358 --> 02:25:10,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, wait, wait.

2152
02:25:10,739 --> 02:25:13,880
[SPEAKER_14]: I was trying to find something for that last email here.

2153
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:14,780
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on, hold on.

2154
02:25:15,160 --> 02:25:16,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Better not be Happy Wedding.

2155
02:25:16,721 --> 02:25:18,201
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no, no.

2156
02:25:18,581 --> 02:25:21,142
[SPEAKER_14]: We already did Happy Wedding a couple weeks ago for Tiara and Dan.

2157
02:25:21,902 --> 02:25:23,503
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the other song.

2158
02:25:37,458 --> 02:25:38,799
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember Parapara Paradise?

2159
02:25:39,099 --> 02:25:39,599
[SPEAKER_14]: Paradise?

2160
02:25:40,420 --> 02:25:42,761
[SPEAKER_14]: Dave, Domino, and Virginelle anniversary.

2161
02:25:43,481 --> 02:25:45,903
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

2162
02:25:46,323 --> 02:25:47,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy anniversary.

2163
02:25:47,824 --> 02:25:49,885
[SPEAKER_05]: I've just started my tour in the Mass Effect universe.

2164
02:25:50,285 --> 02:25:53,547
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say that I have owned both 1 and 2 on Steam for at least 2 years now.

2165
02:25:53,747 --> 02:25:54,407
[SPEAKER_05]: I am hooked.

2166
02:25:55,068 --> 02:25:57,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Played through the first one in about 22 hours.

2167
02:25:57,149 --> 02:25:58,170
[SPEAKER_05]: I am absolutely in love.

2168
02:25:58,890 --> 02:25:59,870
[SPEAKER_05]: This game is epic.

2169
02:25:59,991 --> 02:26:05,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly had chills from the first 2 minutes when 5 year later, spoiler alert, Shepard crawled out from the wreckage.

2170
02:26:06,534 --> 02:26:21,967
[SPEAKER_05]: some things happen in my game that make me sit in my office during the day and question my decisions when one of my favorite characters was shot and killed I wanted so badly to reload my game and make different choices yet I didn't you totally could have

2171
02:26:22,347 --> 02:26:38,059
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah I continued on letting the decisions I had made played out for the rest of the story my question is which choice based games such as KOTOR, Mass Effect, Heavy Rain, Fable do you go with your gut feeling and let the story play out as it will or try to change it in the way that you want it

2172
02:26:40,260 --> 02:26:55,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Mass Effect I played I've actually played the second one the exact damn same way I played the last one my last playthrough on Mass Effect 3 the only thing that I changed was I killed Caden and played with Ashley using my save file editor just so I could see what Ashley was like in Mass Effect 3

2173
02:26:56,065 --> 02:27:02,448
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to admit, Mass Effect was really the first game where I didn't feel this need to do everything perfect.

2174
02:27:02,748 --> 02:27:12,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Because usually when I play RPGs, I'm kind of that anal retentive, search every corner, talk to every person in the town, explore every story, do every side quest.

2175
02:27:12,732 --> 02:27:18,595
[SPEAKER_14]: And there comes a point when you're playing these Bioware games where you just have to realize you can't do that.

2176
02:27:19,055 --> 02:27:20,155
[SPEAKER_14]: You cannot do it.

2177
02:27:20,236 --> 02:27:22,516
[SPEAKER_14]: It is not possible without playing the game 500 times.

2178
02:27:23,817 --> 02:27:37,073
[SPEAKER_14]: so Mass Effect was really one of the first games to kind of like get and I realize this is very recent but it's it's a different way of thinking for me so and it's not been easy so that's my long-winded answer

2179
02:27:39,324 --> 02:27:55,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I also did play Dragon Age 2, and I really liked it, but it was like, when I started romancing What's-Her-Name that was voiced by Eve Miles, I was like, oh my god, she's annoying, oh my god, she's annoying, so I started going after Fenris.

2180
02:27:56,207 --> 02:27:58,188
[SPEAKER_05]: because I was like, ooh, he's kind of broody.

2181
02:27:58,568 --> 02:27:59,308
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd go for Fenris.

2182
02:28:01,749 --> 02:28:04,370
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't really play the Fable games because I really didn't like them that much.

2183
02:28:04,710 --> 02:28:06,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan played the crap out of them.

2184
02:28:06,511 --> 02:28:07,691
[SPEAKER_05]: I started on Fable 2.

2185
02:28:08,151 --> 02:28:12,013
[SPEAKER_14]: I liked Fable, but I never finished any of them, which is weird because I own them all.

2186
02:28:13,915 --> 02:28:37,889
[SPEAKER_05]: um my favorite choice ever was how to bitch slap the bitch slap fight in Final Fantasy 7 just saying and those you know choose your the the little mud games or choosing who you would date in Final Fantasy 7 yeah trying to get the Barrett date fuck no it was always Tifa and I did not use that bitch Aerith more than I had to because she was a hoebag fuck her and now she's tell us how you really feel

2187
02:28:39,695 --> 02:28:40,915
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have my save file.

2188
02:28:41,456 --> 02:28:41,856
[SPEAKER_14]: I know.

2189
02:28:41,876 --> 02:28:44,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Where I can kill her as much as I want to.

2190
02:28:44,976 --> 02:28:46,337
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Jenova fight, which is fun.

2191
02:28:46,717 --> 02:28:49,458
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like the most fun fight in the damn game is that Jenova fight.

2192
02:28:50,478 --> 02:28:52,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm so giddy from her being dead.

2193
02:28:52,278 --> 02:28:53,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you just like the music.

2194
02:28:54,099 --> 02:28:57,480
[SPEAKER_05]: I really love the freaking... No.

2195
02:28:57,640 --> 02:28:58,640
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the Jenova music.

2196
02:29:00,080 --> 02:29:03,563
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate the Earth music because I hate everything about the bitch.

2197
02:29:03,803 --> 02:29:07,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, also completely off topic, but I've ordered Sound Shapes.

2198
02:29:07,785 --> 02:29:10,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Any of you guys played demos or have any thoughts about it?

2199
02:29:10,627 --> 02:29:12,548
[SPEAKER_05]: I really needed something fresh on my Vita.

2200
02:29:12,648 --> 02:29:15,050
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got an inch of dust and shame on it at the moment.

2201
02:29:15,590 --> 02:29:16,631
[SPEAKER_14]: Dust and shame.

2202
02:29:17,091 --> 02:29:17,531
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.

2203
02:29:17,551 --> 02:29:18,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep up the great work, Travis.

2204
02:29:20,593 --> 02:29:21,013
[SPEAKER_14]: I like that.

2205
02:29:21,093 --> 02:29:21,754
[SPEAKER_14]: Dust and shame.

2206
02:29:22,579 --> 02:29:28,704
[SPEAKER_14]: I have not personally played Sound Shapes, but Shane, who's a friend of mine, will not shut up about how great it is.

2207
02:29:29,004 --> 02:29:29,645
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, is he in chat?

2208
02:29:29,725 --> 02:29:32,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe he'll call in later because apparently it's great.

2209
02:29:33,007 --> 02:29:35,269
[SPEAKER_14]: And he says he's getting it launch day.

2210
02:29:35,749 --> 02:29:39,171
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know much about it, but Shane sure talks it up.

2211
02:29:39,892 --> 02:29:40,933
[SPEAKER_14]: It makes me kind of want it.

2212
02:29:40,973 --> 02:29:41,753
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope there's a demo.

2213
02:29:43,334 --> 02:29:44,195
[SPEAKER_14]: There's Shane in chat.

2214
02:29:44,275 --> 02:29:45,256
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Sound Shapes.

2215
02:29:46,337 --> 02:29:46,717
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

2216
02:29:47,992 --> 02:29:48,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Last email?

2217
02:29:48,773 --> 02:29:49,513
[SPEAKER_14]: One more, alright.

2218
02:29:50,013 --> 02:29:51,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, why not?

2219
02:29:52,774 --> 02:29:55,095
[SPEAKER_05]: This is labeled bad rep.

2220
02:29:56,355 --> 02:30:02,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Not all, but some clubs and especially fans slash mafias are a bad rep on home.

2221
02:30:03,018 --> 02:30:06,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than that, home is a great place to have fun and to get away.

2222
02:30:07,179 --> 02:30:11,701
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, even though this has nothing to do with this, who's the porn star?

2223
02:30:11,821 --> 02:30:12,561
[SPEAKER_05]: It could have been me.

2224
02:30:13,962 --> 02:30:14,922
[SPEAKER_05]: That's from Skull King.

2225
02:30:15,222 --> 02:30:16,324
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to say Marissa's in chat.

2226
02:30:25,396 --> 02:30:26,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Marissa, can I say?

2227
02:30:27,038 --> 02:30:27,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell me if I can say.

2228
02:30:28,259 --> 02:30:29,960
[SPEAKER_05]: It starts with a G. All right.

2229
02:30:29,980 --> 02:30:30,921
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why you get a letter.

2230
02:30:31,502 --> 02:30:34,785
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a G. It starts with a G. Like OG.

2231
02:30:34,905 --> 02:30:36,586
[SPEAKER_14]: G would have wasted time I spent on Google.

2232
02:30:36,947 --> 02:30:37,247
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2233
02:30:37,427 --> 02:30:38,208
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that it for emails?

2234
02:30:38,348 --> 02:30:38,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2235
02:30:39,109 --> 02:30:43,052
[SPEAKER_14]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for next week.

2236
02:30:43,373 --> 02:30:44,434
[SPEAKER_14]: That was two home emails.

2237
02:30:44,594 --> 02:30:44,934
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2238
02:30:45,314 --> 02:30:46,275
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, kind emailers.

2239
02:30:47,276 --> 02:30:57,089
[SPEAKER_14]: all of you that emailed from Mass Effect to Sound Shapes to PlayStation Home appreciate it let's get to the FUs of the week the part of the show where we get ranty why?

2240
02:30:57,109 --> 02:30:58,551
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know

2241
02:31:16,178 --> 02:31:16,558
[SPEAKER_05]: FU.

2242
02:31:18,259 --> 02:31:18,979
[SPEAKER_05]: So losing my job.

2243
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:21,400
[SPEAKER_05]: I really fucking liked that place.

2244
02:31:22,281 --> 02:31:23,521
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked everyone I worked with.

2245
02:31:23,922 --> 02:31:25,102
[SPEAKER_05]: I loved my cubicle.

2246
02:31:26,083 --> 02:31:29,424
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked my Mass Effect wallpaper on my dual monitors.

2247
02:31:30,845 --> 02:31:34,586
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm really going to miss the people I worked with and I'm going to miss all the reps I worked with.

2248
02:31:35,447 --> 02:31:36,987
[SPEAKER_05]: They were some awesome people.

2249
02:31:37,508 --> 02:31:37,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying.

2250
02:31:41,055 --> 02:31:42,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I have to tell you what my FU is.

2251
02:31:43,376 --> 02:31:46,936
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this whole debacle with this stupid Black Tiger score and stuff.

2252
02:31:48,717 --> 02:32:00,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, there was literally a forum thread on Twin Galaxies from the people that beat the fucking high score that actually set the goddamn world record that said, hey, the machine doesn't score right.

2253
02:32:00,879 --> 02:32:02,580
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet they're not willing to do anything about it.

2254
02:32:02,640 --> 02:32:03,920
[SPEAKER_02]: So fuck that shit, you know.

2255
02:32:05,980 --> 02:32:07,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Way to go, Twin Galaxies.

2256
02:32:07,261 --> 02:32:08,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Some integrity you got there.

2257
02:32:10,919 --> 02:32:13,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, I don't have a lot to complain about.

2258
02:32:13,321 --> 02:32:14,542
[SPEAKER_14]: Things are going pretty well for me.

2259
02:32:14,802 --> 02:32:19,705
[SPEAKER_14]: F you to the lack of motivation I have to exercise, because I really need to get that done.

2260
02:32:20,325 --> 02:32:26,830
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to join a gym or something, but I just know my lack of motivation too well.

2261
02:32:27,478 --> 02:32:27,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Bradley.

2262
02:32:28,499 --> 02:32:29,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, fuck you to my bee-hurting.

2263
02:32:30,159 --> 02:32:34,862
[SPEAKER_10]: At least I'm done with my hiking season for the most part.

2264
02:32:34,902 --> 02:32:39,584
[SPEAKER_10]: Except for since I'm on later, just hopefully I won't hurt more later then.

2265
02:32:39,684 --> 02:32:47,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, and also fuck you to getting tired in the middle of the day after your lunch.

2266
02:32:47,127 --> 02:32:50,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, uh, get all the work done.

2267
02:32:50,529 --> 02:32:50,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Work.

2268
02:32:50,689 --> 02:32:51,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Work's not that exciting.

2269
02:32:53,110 --> 02:32:53,931
[SPEAKER_10]: That makes arguing harder.

2270
02:32:55,774 --> 02:32:58,115
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, there it is, EFU's The Week.

2271
02:33:02,737 --> 02:33:03,218
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving on.

2272
02:33:05,299 --> 02:33:06,739
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's do a couple more news stories.

2273
02:33:07,680 --> 02:33:10,521
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we're going to get into Twitter topics, if we have any.

2274
02:33:10,821 --> 02:33:12,562
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't really make a lot of calls for them, but we'll see.

2275
02:33:12,902 --> 02:33:13,963
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the Skype line.

2276
02:33:14,463 --> 02:33:15,464
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the end of the show.

2277
02:33:16,184 --> 02:33:18,165
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the Mars Curiosity Landing special.

2278
02:33:18,965 --> 02:33:19,066
[SPEAKER_14]: Sweet.

2279
02:33:19,086 --> 02:33:19,946
[SPEAKER_14]: What are you pointing at?

2280
02:33:22,421 --> 02:33:23,522
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, what is this?

2281
02:33:23,562 --> 02:33:23,963
[SPEAKER_14]: What is this?

2282
02:33:24,363 --> 02:33:25,264
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's discuss.

2283
02:33:26,165 --> 02:33:26,906
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's discuss this.

2284
02:33:27,667 --> 02:33:35,695
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a bag of stuff from Swag's kind of stuff from the last packs that I have sitting around on my table and I'm not going to do anything with it.

2285
02:33:35,755 --> 02:33:38,338
[SPEAKER_10]: So I thought I'd bring it over here so you could give it away.

2286
02:33:39,059 --> 02:33:39,920
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2287

[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2289
02:34:22,729 --> 02:34:23,989
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe some codes in here.

2290
02:34:24,009 --> 02:34:25,129
[SPEAKER_14]: Why not just dump the bag out?

2291
02:34:25,570 --> 02:34:27,850
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I don't want to do that because then I have to put it all back in the bag.

2292
02:34:28,511 --> 02:34:28,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Lazy?

2293
02:34:29,931 --> 02:34:30,671
[SPEAKER_14]: Some stickers.

2294
02:34:31,632 --> 02:34:32,412
[SPEAKER_14]: Some sort of thing.

2295
02:34:32,432 --> 02:34:33,332
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that a tattoo?

2296
02:34:33,613 --> 02:34:34,173
[SPEAKER_14]: What is this?

2297
02:34:35,453 --> 02:34:36,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Air Mac.

2298
02:34:36,254 --> 02:34:37,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it's like a business card.

2299
02:34:37,134 --> 02:34:37,834
[SPEAKER_14]: A little QR code.

2300
02:34:38,074 --> 02:34:38,774
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, cool.

2301
02:34:38,874 --> 02:34:39,115
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

2302
02:34:39,135 --> 02:34:42,216
[SPEAKER_10]: There's like one thing that I got at the harmonics panel.

2303
02:34:42,456 --> 02:34:43,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Grab that thing.

2304
02:34:43,316 --> 02:34:43,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

2305
02:34:43,696 --> 02:34:44,857
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a chain sort of thing.

2306
02:34:46,824 --> 02:34:47,245
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh-huh.

2307
02:34:48,507 --> 02:34:49,950
[SPEAKER_14]: Holy crap, this thing's heavy.

2308
02:34:51,192 --> 02:34:52,254
[SPEAKER_14]: What the hell is this?

2309
02:34:53,251 --> 02:34:55,073
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a weird Dance Central chain thing.

2310
02:34:55,673 --> 02:34:59,717
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, that's like... You can wear the chain like they wear in Dance Central.

2311
02:35:00,918 --> 02:35:02,919
[SPEAKER_14]: That is fucking hilarious.

2312
02:35:03,119 --> 02:35:03,680
[SPEAKER_14]: I love that.

2313
02:35:04,020 --> 02:35:07,844
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so how do... Yeah, unfortunately, I can only stay there, pan off like 10 minutes.

2314
02:35:07,944 --> 02:35:10,246
[SPEAKER_14]: How are we going to give away this bag of crap this week?

2315
02:35:10,406 --> 02:35:11,807
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to think of something.

2316
02:35:11,887 --> 02:35:12,207
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2317
02:35:14,569 --> 02:35:17,932
[SPEAKER_14]: How about we make a forum post and...

2318
02:35:19,053 --> 02:35:34,229
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll make a forum post after the show because I want something the podcasties can participate in too I want the live listeners and the podcasties to have a chance at it so we'll say we're going to do a forum post and we'll do something about if you're not going to PAX this year

2319
02:35:35,532 --> 02:35:37,194
[SPEAKER_14]: What are you going to do instead or something?

2320
02:35:37,214 --> 02:35:37,515
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

2321
02:35:37,535 --> 02:35:48,468
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll come up with something and we'll have a question and we'll pick one random answer on the forums and give away Bradley's bag of crap from PAX and you won't even have to pay shipping.

2322
02:35:48,508 --> 02:35:50,711
[SPEAKER_14]: Shipping will be covered by OLR because we're generous and kind.

2323
02:35:51,291 --> 02:35:51,672
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

2324
02:35:54,844 --> 02:36:02,209
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm looking in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com DJ Morpheus says, F you to not hearing Bradley.

2325
02:36:02,529 --> 02:36:04,250
[SPEAKER_14]: He's just a quiet guy.

2326
02:36:04,290 --> 02:36:05,471
[SPEAKER_14]: He's just soft-spoken.

2327
02:36:05,911 --> 02:36:08,953
[SPEAKER_14]: He's not as loud and obnoxious as the other rest of us.

2328
02:36:09,754 --> 02:36:10,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, DarkSakura?

2329
02:36:11,315 --> 02:36:11,595
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2330
02:36:12,176 --> 02:36:12,596
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly.

2331
02:36:12,616 --> 02:36:13,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me?

2332
02:36:14,617 --> 02:36:15,278
[SPEAKER_03]: You did not.

2333
02:36:16,278 --> 02:36:17,019
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yes, I did.

2334
02:36:19,361 --> 02:36:19,741
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2335
02:36:20,623 --> 02:36:21,064
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, girl.

2336
02:36:21,524 --> 02:36:21,725
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

2337
02:36:23,067 --> 02:36:25,570
[SPEAKER_14]: DJ Morpheus says, is it a bag of shit?

2338
02:36:26,011 --> 02:36:26,432
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of.

2339
02:36:28,074 --> 02:36:29,997
[SPEAKER_14]: But, dude, Dance Central chain.

2340
02:36:31,720 --> 02:36:32,040
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2341
02:36:33,915 --> 02:36:36,597
[SPEAKER_14]: Monty Boggs says, I didn't even know VOG had a forum.

2342
02:36:36,717 --> 02:36:37,138
[SPEAKER_14]: I fail.

2343
02:36:37,498 --> 02:36:39,159
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the point of the contest.

2344
02:36:39,180 --> 02:36:39,920
[SPEAKER_14]: See what I'm doing?

2345
02:36:39,960 --> 02:36:41,561
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm driving traffic to the forums.

2346
02:36:41,682 --> 02:36:42,122
[SPEAKER_14]: Get it?

2347
02:36:42,562 --> 02:36:42,903
[SPEAKER_14]: Get it?

2348
02:36:42,963 --> 02:36:44,444
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe we'll throw in another prize or two.

2349
02:36:44,504 --> 02:36:44,764
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2350
02:36:45,124 --> 02:36:50,549
[SPEAKER_14]: So win Bradley's bag of shit from PAX featuring Dance Central Chains and Whoopie Cushions.

2351
02:36:51,730 --> 02:36:55,393
[SPEAKER_14]: Enter on the forums after the podcast goes up tonight, live listeners.

2352
02:36:55,573 --> 02:36:57,655
[SPEAKER_14]: Keep an eye out on the forums at vognetwork.com.

2353
02:36:58,260 --> 02:37:00,421
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, let us move on.

2354
02:37:01,002 --> 02:37:03,143
[SPEAKER_14]: Some folks in chat talking about E3 swag.

2355
02:37:03,323 --> 02:37:03,803
[SPEAKER_14]: Not anymore.

2356
02:37:04,824 --> 02:37:07,525
[SPEAKER_14]: E3 swag, that was E3 circa like 2003.

2357
02:37:08,826 --> 02:37:10,847
[SPEAKER_14]: Now it's all go on our website.

2358
02:37:10,907 --> 02:37:13,069
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's a business card with a link to our website.

2359
02:37:13,349 --> 02:37:15,950
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's a QR code to scan to get on our mailing list.

2360
02:37:16,210 --> 02:37:17,611
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't really give away stuff anymore.

2361
02:37:18,592 --> 02:37:21,453
[SPEAKER_14]: When the economy got tight, those are the first things to go.

2362
02:37:22,074 --> 02:37:22,674
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry to say.

2363
02:37:24,055 --> 02:37:25,156
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Loki, news stories.

2364
02:37:25,976 --> 02:37:31,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, it's been a show where we haven't mentioned the Ouya yet, so let's mention the Ouya.

2365
02:37:32,060 --> 02:37:32,601
[SPEAKER_14]: God damn it.

2366
02:37:33,621 --> 02:37:34,042
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all right.

2367
02:37:34,142 --> 02:37:35,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, there's good stuff.

2368
02:37:35,442 --> 02:37:36,963
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Ouya, they've got a few things.

2369
02:37:37,044 --> 02:37:41,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, they're kicking starters running through, I believe, this week.

2370
02:37:41,186 --> 02:37:42,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it ends this week.

2371
02:37:42,687 --> 02:37:47,891
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've added a few things, including you can get a special edition console if you pledge $140.

2372
02:37:48,291 --> 02:37:53,014
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's slightly darker metal.

2373
02:37:53,414 --> 02:37:55,416
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of like it, but I'm not going to pledge any extra money.

2374
02:37:57,777 --> 02:38:01,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Shadowrun Online has been confirmed to be getting Ouya support.

2375
02:38:02,180 --> 02:38:05,101
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming that's, of course, if they hit their Kickstarter goal.

2376
02:38:06,963 --> 02:38:13,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy 3 is going to be one of the launch titles for the Ouya, which is kind of interesting.

2377
02:38:13,767 --> 02:38:18,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, that was just recently released on Android, but they will be doing a version for the Ouya.

2378
02:38:20,030 --> 02:38:40,107
[SPEAKER_02]: um kind of neat and then um also iHeartRadio has been confirmed as one of the apps on there and then there's a game called Offensive Combat that's getting a port to um oh yeah as well that's um kind of like a Call of Duty type of game first person shooter so neat

2379
02:38:42,452 --> 02:38:43,933
[SPEAKER_14]: Neat indeed, I guess.

2380
02:38:45,014 --> 02:38:47,256
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm still waiting for the OUYA to hit the shelves, that's all.

2381
02:38:47,336 --> 02:38:49,158
[SPEAKER_14]: But their Kickstarter's doing very well.

2382
02:38:49,818 --> 02:38:53,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and they've got some of the people backing it.

2383
02:38:53,281 --> 02:38:54,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Square Enix is kind of interesting.

2384
02:38:54,803 --> 02:38:57,585
[SPEAKER_14]: Now it's all about, will it come out on time?

2385
02:38:58,046 --> 02:39:00,368
[SPEAKER_14]: The countdown is beginning.

2386
02:39:01,128 --> 02:39:04,191
[SPEAKER_14]: Because now aren't they offering limited edition colors and...

2387
02:39:04,983 --> 02:39:12,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's more expensive because it's going to be a limited run, and so because they're producing less units, it's going to cost a little bit more.

2388
02:39:15,157 --> 02:39:38,983
[SPEAKER_14]: all right one more news story for you guys tonight and then the skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on skype orange lounge radio opening right after this story and this is one of those wow i uh i'm not sure i believe this is happening but it's happening a new game coming out for the wii note that's not wii u it's the wii and it's happening on september 14th

2389
02:39:40,797 --> 02:39:47,959
[SPEAKER_14]: Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals Sing and Dance coming out on the Wii I think I know who's putting this out too September 14th who?

2390
02:39:48,619 --> 02:40:08,185
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's oh god now I'm gonna forget it's not City Interactive O Games Oxygen Games is the one putting this out because they had well they had a game called Everyone's Sing and Dance and I believe that they picked up licensing now for this if I already guessed

2391
02:40:10,385 --> 02:40:10,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

2392
02:40:11,106 --> 02:40:26,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in kind of a similar story, you know how they have that Marvel Avengers game that's coming out that kind of looks a little similar to that Ubisoft fighting game that they have, like another superhero game?

2393
02:40:26,897 --> 02:40:35,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's actually the sequel to that because it was just going to be Power Up Heroes 2, but then they got the Marvel licensing, so they skinned it.

2394
02:40:35,043 --> 02:40:37,405
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, I want to talk about Andrew Lloyd Webber, though.

2395
02:40:37,545 --> 02:40:40,247
[SPEAKER_14]: This game is coming out September 14th.

2396
02:40:40,547 --> 02:40:42,989
[SPEAKER_14]: 32 classic hits from 13 musicals.

2397
02:40:43,429 --> 02:40:55,177
[SPEAKER_14]: You can sing and dance to Don't Cry For Me, Argentina from Evita, Superstar from Jesus Christ Superstar, and All I Ask of You from The Phantom of the Opera.

2398
02:40:55,898 --> 02:40:55,978
Man.

2399
02:40:58,502 --> 02:40:59,703
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure that's in there too.

2400
02:41:00,003 --> 02:41:01,144
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's my question.

2401
02:41:01,164 --> 02:41:03,026
[SPEAKER_14]: The game is called sing and dance.

2402
02:41:03,866 --> 02:41:06,188
[SPEAKER_14]: How the fuck do you dance to any of those songs?

2403
02:41:06,248 --> 02:41:10,572
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen Cats and all she does is shuffle across the stage and pose a lot.

2404
02:41:10,732 --> 02:41:13,434
[SPEAKER_14]: Or I think of Madonna in Don't Cry For Me Argentina.

2405
02:41:13,474 --> 02:41:13,954
[SPEAKER_14]: What did she do?

2406
02:41:13,994 --> 02:41:15,876
[SPEAKER_14]: She was in the balcony with her hands.

2407
02:41:16,236 --> 02:41:19,539
[SPEAKER_14]: Or you take the Wiimote with your hands and point to the subjects.

2408
02:41:20,580 --> 02:41:24,123
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't cry for me Argentina.

2409
02:41:24,143 --> 02:41:25,704
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, good lord.

2410
02:41:28,908 --> 02:41:38,256
[SPEAKER_02]: I still kind of want to buy it and have Loki play it on the show it would be interesting to do a whole segment of drunk people performing the musicals

2411
02:41:41,112 --> 02:41:46,776
[SPEAKER_14]: Poor Andrew Lloyd Webber because he doesn't know about how bastardized his musical songs are about to become.

2412
02:41:47,317 --> 02:41:48,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the Phantom of the Opera.

2413
02:41:49,198 --> 02:41:50,359
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great musical.

2414
02:41:50,439 --> 02:41:51,540
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it a few times.

2415
02:41:51,580 --> 02:41:52,781
[SPEAKER_14]: The sensitive side of Loki.

2416
02:41:52,801 --> 02:41:55,403
[SPEAKER_14]: Have you seen the movie that came out a couple years ago?

2417
02:41:55,663 --> 02:41:56,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I did see the movie.

2418
02:41:56,643 --> 02:41:57,664
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to the theaters to see that.

2419
02:41:57,684 --> 02:41:58,385
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't bad, huh?

2420
02:41:58,725 --> 02:42:00,726
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked it.

2421
02:42:01,147 --> 02:42:02,528
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great opera.

2422
02:42:03,208 --> 02:42:05,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen Wicked was good.

2423
02:42:06,070 --> 02:42:09,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I even got dragged to A Light in the Piazza which is

2424
02:42:11,101 --> 02:42:12,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Spamalot Tim Curry King Arthur

2425
02:42:35,819 --> 02:42:55,428
[SPEAKER_14]: Tim Korean, anything, awesome I was given very bad news Oh, Black Wolf's got a good point, Book of Mormon I'm sure is one you might enjoy Avenue Q is great too But one bit of sad news I got this week, thanks to SSJ100 Matt, you jerk Sister Act is closing on Broadway at the end of this month Really?

2426
02:42:55,488 --> 02:42:56,189
[SPEAKER_14]: You're surprised?

2427
02:42:57,630 --> 02:42:58,150
[SPEAKER_14]: A little bit.

2428
02:42:58,451 --> 02:42:59,372
[SPEAKER_14]: Didn't it win Tony's?

2429
02:43:00,052 --> 02:43:00,953
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to tour, though.

2430
02:43:01,033 --> 02:43:01,614
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to tour.

2431
02:43:01,654 --> 02:43:08,341
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to say a little prayer that Sister Act will end up in San Francisco.

2432
02:43:08,882 --> 02:43:09,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Sacramento.

2433
02:43:09,622 --> 02:43:10,243
[SPEAKER_14]: How can it not?

2434
02:43:10,764 --> 02:43:11,344
[SPEAKER_14]: You never know.

2435
02:43:11,404 --> 02:43:11,805
[SPEAKER_14]: It might.

2436
02:43:12,445 --> 02:43:13,507
[SPEAKER_14]: We got the Lion King.

2437
02:43:14,728 --> 02:43:15,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now we have that.

2438
02:43:16,350 --> 02:43:18,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only do we have that now, but they have the kind of...

2439
02:43:19,401 --> 02:43:22,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Off, Off, Off, Off, Off Broadway stuff now.

2440
02:43:22,283 --> 02:43:27,006
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have, like, you know, the three stages, which is in our, like, Folsom.

2441
02:43:27,026 --> 02:43:29,488
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got Davis and stuff like that.

2442
02:43:29,568 --> 02:43:30,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like Music Circus.

2443
02:43:31,329 --> 02:43:31,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of.

2444
02:43:31,930 --> 02:43:33,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but they do, I mean, they do, like, Wicked and stuff.

2445
02:43:34,011 --> 02:43:34,852
[SPEAKER_14]: A Family Friend.

2446
02:43:35,652 --> 02:43:39,676
[SPEAKER_14]: A family friend, their little girl was in Little Orphan Annie, and I think that was the last musical I went to see.

2447
02:43:39,736 --> 02:43:41,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they did The Lion King.

2448
02:43:41,197 --> 02:43:47,843
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't know, you know, is that the same Lion King, or are we seeing, like, high school production of The Lion King?

2449
02:43:47,883 --> 02:43:52,006
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Tigerclaw in chat says, but the costumes for The Lion King musical are crappy, though.

2450
02:43:52,106 --> 02:43:54,749
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, you and I clearly didn't see the same production.

2451
02:43:55,149 --> 02:44:01,775
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, you must have seen community theater Lion King, because the costumes and the puppetry and all, that's what it's all about.

2452
02:44:01,895 --> 02:44:03,236
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, if you don't have good costumes...

2453
02:44:03,516 --> 02:44:04,317
[SPEAKER_14]: The Lion King is screwed.

2454
02:44:04,357 --> 02:44:05,758
[SPEAKER_02]: What about Evil Dead the musical?

2455
02:44:05,859 --> 02:44:06,760
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awesome too.

2456
02:44:06,940 --> 02:44:07,600
[SPEAKER_02]: That exists.

2457
02:44:07,741 --> 02:44:08,021
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

2458
02:44:08,041 --> 02:44:10,624
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why I did it in San Jose.

2459
02:44:10,644 --> 02:44:16,610
[SPEAKER_14]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio if you want to give us a call right now or Loki and I can just sit here and talk about musicals.

2460
02:44:16,670 --> 02:44:17,051
[SPEAKER_14]: It's cool.

2461
02:44:18,632 --> 02:44:21,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, do you have any other last minute stories before we...

2462
02:44:22,792 --> 02:44:26,294
[SPEAKER_02]: There was some stuff about... There was another Kickstarter project that's going on.

2463
02:44:26,314 --> 02:44:26,754
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.

2464
02:44:26,774 --> 02:44:29,495
[SPEAKER_02]: It's for the heads-up display.

2465
02:44:29,515 --> 02:44:34,457
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a virtual reality display that's being backed by id Software and stuff like that.

2466
02:44:34,537 --> 02:44:35,637
[SPEAKER_02]: So that might be something cool.

2467
02:44:35,657 --> 02:44:35,837
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold up.

2468
02:44:35,877 --> 02:44:40,659
[SPEAKER_14]: I never realized your picture was on the ErnestKlein.com website.

2469
02:44:40,739 --> 02:44:41,099
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, it is.

2470
02:44:41,119 --> 02:44:42,700
[SPEAKER_14]: But somebody linked it in chat.

2471
02:44:43,080 --> 02:44:45,181
[SPEAKER_14]: And my favorite is that your face...

2472
02:44:45,521 --> 02:44:46,301
[SPEAKER_14]: You're so fucking mad.

2473
02:44:46,341 --> 02:44:49,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I was so pissed off at that fucking thing.

2474
02:44:49,162 --> 02:44:51,003
[SPEAKER_02]: I purposefully looked angry at that.

2475
02:44:51,023 --> 02:44:52,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Texas, for linking that.

2476
02:44:52,203 --> 02:44:52,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

2477
02:44:52,603 --> 02:44:55,144
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another one on there that I looked tired because I was playing.

2478
02:44:55,304 --> 02:44:59,066
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one for the Atari 2600 game from Gate 1.

2479
02:44:59,126 --> 02:45:01,746
[SPEAKER_02]: I was number 159, so you can look up the picture for that, too.

2480
02:45:01,766 --> 02:45:03,227
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, we've got a million calls coming in.

2481
02:45:03,267 --> 02:45:04,087
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to get some calls.

2482
02:45:04,147 --> 02:45:05,168
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2483
02:45:05,188 --> 02:45:05,608
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

2484
02:45:06,588 --> 02:45:07,508
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, hi, it's Panaxium.

2485
02:45:07,688 --> 02:45:08,829
[SPEAKER_14]: Panaxium, what's up?

2486
02:45:09,969 --> 02:45:11,610
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, hey, I actually finally got through.

2487
02:45:11,650 --> 02:45:12,751
[SPEAKER_14]: How about that?

2488
02:45:12,831 --> 02:45:14,032
[SPEAKER_14]: Long-time listener, first-time caller?

2489
02:45:14,993 --> 02:45:15,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, actually.

2490
02:45:15,534 --> 02:45:16,234
[SPEAKER_14]: My favorite.

2491
02:45:16,534 --> 02:45:17,555
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, welcome to the show.

2492
02:45:18,396 --> 02:45:18,916
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, thank you.

2493
02:45:19,017 --> 02:45:21,018
[SPEAKER_14]: And I love your little Skype icon.

2494
02:45:22,219 --> 02:45:24,261
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the best squirrel in the universe.

2495
02:45:25,762 --> 02:45:27,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that like the epic Iron Man squirrel?

2496
02:45:27,343 --> 02:45:31,667
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish it was a video show sometime so you all could see that because that's cracking my shit up.

2497
02:45:31,727 --> 02:45:34,629
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, Panaxian, to what do we owe this phone call tonight?

2498
02:45:34,649 --> 02:45:35,090
[SPEAKER_14]: What's on your mind?

2499
02:45:36,011 --> 02:45:41,358
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, actually, I just got done playing a game recently that I think is awesome, and I don't know if you guys have covered it before.

2500
02:45:42,660 --> 02:45:45,764
[SPEAKER_13]: It is Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet.

2501
02:45:47,170 --> 02:45:48,011
[SPEAKER_02]: I've wanted to play it.

2502
02:45:48,431 --> 02:45:50,992
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought it, and I don't think I've played it yet.

2503
02:45:51,272 --> 02:45:51,832
[SPEAKER_14]: I bought it.

2504
02:45:51,972 --> 02:46:04,637
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't finished it yet, but it was one of the closest, like, Super Metroid-esque games I've played in a very long time that actually kind of, like, took me back to how good, like, outside of, like, Castlevania, right?

2505
02:46:05,077 --> 02:46:08,799
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, took me back to how freaking good Super Metroid was.

2506
02:46:08,899 --> 02:46:10,500
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, it really kind of took me back to that.

2507
02:46:10,520 --> 02:46:12,600
[SPEAKER_14]: But then I got to admit, I don't know if you know this.

2508
02:46:12,780 --> 02:46:13,861
[SPEAKER_14]: Where are you from, Panaxium?

2509
02:46:14,819 --> 02:46:15,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Colorado.

2510
02:46:15,460 --> 02:46:16,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Colorado.

2511
02:46:16,020 --> 02:46:17,461
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have Del Taco in Colorado?

2512
02:46:18,161 --> 02:46:18,401
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2513
02:46:18,601 --> 02:46:18,821
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2514
02:46:19,102 --> 02:46:22,764
[SPEAKER_14]: Del Taco did an insanely twisted Shadow Planet promotion.

2515
02:46:23,124 --> 02:46:24,685
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was like, what?

2516
02:46:25,565 --> 02:46:26,326
[SPEAKER_14]: No way, really?

2517
02:46:26,886 --> 02:46:27,366
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2518
02:46:27,867 --> 02:46:32,509
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like, buy a taco, get an insanely twisted Shadow Planet cup.

2519
02:46:32,570 --> 02:46:33,170
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was like...

2520
02:46:34,531 --> 02:46:35,552
[SPEAKER_14]: I have never heard of this.

2521
02:46:35,572 --> 02:46:37,455
[SPEAKER_14]: So Call of Duty was unavailable, huh?

2522
02:46:37,795 --> 02:46:37,975
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2523
02:46:38,236 --> 02:46:43,702
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not there anymore, but it was like six months after the game had come out.

2524
02:46:43,822 --> 02:46:45,424
[SPEAKER_14]: It was so fucking random.

2525
02:46:45,985 --> 02:46:46,926
[SPEAKER_14]: Google it or something.

2526
02:46:46,986 --> 02:46:47,426
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

2527
02:46:48,027 --> 02:46:48,768
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really weird.

2528
02:46:49,849 --> 02:46:52,993
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, I was just calling because I thought that game was just amazing.

2529
02:46:53,073 --> 02:46:54,435
[SPEAKER_13]: I loved the art style of it.

2530
02:46:55,759 --> 02:47:14,308
[SPEAKER_13]: and uh just the gameplay just kind of like you said it took me back and I was like wow they just don't make games like this anymore well I guess they do because it's out so did they ever do the DLC for that I heard there was supposed to be DLC coming out but I don't remember reading about it uh I don't know actually huh yeah Loki yeah DLC came out for it oh did it yeah oh good

2531
02:47:15,573 --> 02:47:18,834
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it has some multiplayer stuff, but I actually got a chance to try it.

2532
02:47:18,854 --> 02:47:20,274
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's on Steam too, maybe.

2533
02:47:20,494 --> 02:47:21,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Or they have a PC version.

2534
02:47:21,994 --> 02:47:23,274
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, there's like a PC version now.

2535
02:47:23,314 --> 02:47:25,915
[SPEAKER_14]: The original one was on Xbox Live Arcade, but that's awesome.

2536
02:47:26,435 --> 02:47:29,835
[SPEAKER_14]: So yes, yes, I am familiar with Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, and it's a good pick.

2537
02:47:31,296 --> 02:47:32,036
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, definitely.

2538
02:47:33,616 --> 02:47:34,836
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything else on your mind tonight, buddy?

2539
02:47:35,536 --> 02:47:41,777
[SPEAKER_13]: No, just wanted to pop in and say hi, because I've been meaning to call in to you guys for quite a while, and I just never get around to it.

2540
02:47:41,958 --> 02:47:42,998
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a wonderful voice.

2541
02:47:43,138 --> 02:47:43,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hi.

2542
02:47:43,518 --> 02:47:44,198
[SPEAKER_05]: You should do radio.

2543
02:47:47,383 --> 02:47:47,743
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2544
02:47:49,104 --> 02:47:49,865
[SPEAKER_14]: You're welcome.

2545
02:47:49,885 --> 02:47:52,807
[SPEAKER_14]: You just made him blush a little bit, DarkSakura.

2546
02:47:53,427 --> 02:47:54,948
[SPEAKER_14]: She hasn't talked to the callers often.

2547
02:47:54,988 --> 02:47:55,869
[SPEAKER_14]: She's a little stuck up.

2548
02:47:56,289 --> 02:47:57,049
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not.

2549
02:47:57,490 --> 02:47:58,050
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just kidding.

2550
02:47:58,070 --> 02:47:59,271
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm judging you a lot right now.

2551
02:48:00,552 --> 02:48:00,852
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2552
02:48:01,252 --> 02:48:04,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Y'all can't see it on the radio, but I'm giving Rob the look of judgment.

2553
02:48:04,995 --> 02:48:06,356
[SPEAKER_14]: Should I get the people's court theme up again?

2554
02:48:06,916 --> 02:48:07,116
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2555
02:48:07,617 --> 02:48:08,017
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, boy.

2556
02:48:08,857 --> 02:48:12,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Panaxium, thanks so much for the call, and glad we can make you blush.

2557
02:48:13,360 --> 02:48:14,461
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'm honored.

2558
02:48:14,721 --> 02:48:15,001
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2559
02:48:15,142 --> 02:48:15,762
[SPEAKER_13]: Take care, buddy.

2560
02:48:16,482 --> 02:48:16,743
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye.

2561
02:48:16,963 --> 02:48:17,203
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye.

2562
02:48:20,270 --> 02:48:22,812
[SPEAKER_14]: You gonna flirt with all the callers tonight?

2563
02:48:22,932 --> 02:48:24,553
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not flirting with the callers.

2564
02:48:24,973 --> 02:48:30,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, I compliment people on things that deserve complimenting and he's got a very nice voice, just saying.

2565
02:48:31,077 --> 02:48:32,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Not Garrus level.

2566
02:48:33,959 --> 02:48:36,900
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, well thank you for bringing us back down.

2567
02:48:36,920 --> 02:48:39,082
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you're not Garrus, but you're alright.

2568
02:48:39,122 --> 02:48:40,703
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, that's an amazing voice actor.

2569
02:48:40,783 --> 02:48:41,724
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go to another call.

2570
02:48:41,784 --> 02:48:42,884
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2571
02:48:42,904 --> 02:48:43,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

2572
02:48:44,525 --> 02:48:44,845
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up?

2573
02:48:44,886 --> 02:48:45,546
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Travis, guys.

2574
02:48:45,586 --> 02:48:46,126
[SPEAKER_14]: How y'all doing?

2575
02:48:46,226 --> 02:48:46,767
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, Travis.

2576
02:48:46,787 --> 02:48:47,327
[SPEAKER_14]: How you doing?

2577
02:48:47,367 --> 02:48:48,628
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, you're not Travis Donovan.

2578
02:48:49,545 --> 02:48:54,489
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm Travis that just emailed about Mass Effect and all my other... I like you.

2579
02:48:56,430 --> 02:49:00,033
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you what, DarkSakura... That's not flirting!

2580
02:49:00,413 --> 02:49:01,114
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you just say?

2581
02:49:01,134 --> 02:49:01,774
[SPEAKER_04]: You said, I like you.

2582
02:49:01,794 --> 02:49:03,395
[SPEAKER_08]: That game is absolutely phenomenal.

2583
02:49:03,435 --> 02:49:10,641
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I started it probably twice or three times on my Xbox 360, and I never wanted to play it because I just could not get into it.

2584
02:49:10,661 --> 02:49:13,943
[SPEAKER_08]: And y'all were just talking about games that you play once and you're just like, I can't do it.

2585
02:49:15,144 --> 02:49:19,208
[SPEAKER_08]: and I just played it on my PC and I absolutely love it.

2586
02:49:19,469 --> 02:49:20,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, unbelievable.

2587
02:49:20,950 --> 02:49:21,491
[SPEAKER_14]: Have you gotten it?

2588
02:49:21,631 --> 02:49:23,813
[SPEAKER_14]: I got chills right now talking about it.

2589
02:49:23,913 --> 02:49:24,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you cheat like I do?

2590
02:49:26,916 --> 02:49:27,257
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that?

2591
02:49:27,337 --> 02:49:28,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you cheat like I do?

2592
02:49:30,200 --> 02:49:30,580
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you mean?

2593
02:49:30,620 --> 02:49:30,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Console.

2594
02:49:30,900 --> 02:49:31,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Console.

2595
02:49:32,830 --> 02:49:33,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Godmode.

2596
02:49:34,071 --> 02:49:35,212
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm playing on the PC right now.

2597
02:49:35,432 --> 02:49:37,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, so am I. And I am fully cheating.

2598
02:49:37,414 --> 02:49:41,657
[SPEAKER_14]: You can do this hacks thing where you can like hack the game for Godmode and all that stuff.

2599
02:49:41,697 --> 02:49:44,139
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of like the, you know, the old school shooters where you could be invincible.

2600
02:49:44,700 --> 02:49:45,981
[SPEAKER_14]: IDDQD and all that stuff.

2601
02:49:46,861 --> 02:49:48,143
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not doing anything like that.

2602
02:49:48,183 --> 02:49:55,929
[SPEAKER_08]: I just played it through and like I said, I was just going with my gut feeling on everything that I said and I was actually a complete asshole in the game and the whole like

2603
02:49:56,451 --> 02:49:58,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, what do you want to do with the council at the end?

2604
02:49:58,753 --> 02:49:59,934
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, yeah, screw them.

2605
02:50:00,034 --> 02:50:00,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Kill them!

2606
02:50:01,174 --> 02:50:02,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.

2607
02:50:02,755 --> 02:50:03,696
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just after Sovereign.

2608
02:50:06,182 --> 02:50:07,563
[SPEAKER_08]: I got two other things about it, though.

2609
02:50:08,564 --> 02:50:09,744
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys were just talking about musicals.

2610
02:50:09,764 --> 02:50:13,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Has anybody or have any of y'all seen Video Games Live?

2611
02:50:13,526 --> 02:50:14,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's coming.

2612
02:50:14,147 --> 02:50:14,767
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in Florida.

2613
02:50:15,247 --> 02:50:16,608
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's coming to St.

2614
02:50:16,648 --> 02:50:16,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Pete.

2615
02:50:17,048 --> 02:50:18,649
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm so excited to see it.

2616
02:50:19,009 --> 02:50:20,590
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a long time ago.

2617
02:50:20,730 --> 02:50:29,195
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe Dark Tetsuya, who is like the OLR historian, will know the episode number.

2618
02:50:29,275 --> 02:50:33,438
[SPEAKER_14]: But we actually had Tommy Tallarico on the show for like an Uber interview, like 45 minutes long.

2619
02:50:34,198 --> 02:50:35,639
[SPEAKER_14]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2620
02:51:00,020 --> 02:51:24,834
[SPEAKER_08]: other than camp well I need another 45 minutes to get into that but let's just say in our adult lives yes so this is funny anyway sorry no that's really cool because I mean I've been wanting to see it for years and I've got a Spotify account and I listen to like the albums on there and I'm just so stoked that it's coming back to Florida again I can't wait to see it but my other question was

2621
02:51:26,004 --> 02:51:32,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you guys heard about the game, or it's a mod for Arma 2, it's called DayZ?

2622
02:51:32,213 --> 02:51:32,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2623
02:51:33,435 --> 02:51:36,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Has anybody gotten into that, or what is it all about?

2624
02:51:36,360 --> 02:51:40,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm a huge Walking Dead fan, and it reminds me so much of Walking Dead, it's ridiculous.

2625
02:51:41,245 --> 02:52:09,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't really gotten a chance to play it yet because I'm still trying to figure out how Arma controls to my Xbox 360 controller I've gotten close but it gets complicated but apparently it's very just it drops you down you have you know you have to go find resources and you know there's random groups of people walking around doing weird things like kidnapping people and you know of course you fight zombies but it's more about the crazies that are out there too which are all real people

2626
02:52:10,907 --> 02:52:37,729
[SPEAKER_14]: and that's what I've heard and I'm trying to like I guess wrap my head around the point of the game because it seems like the point is just to keep your character alive as long as possible which seems kind of creative pretty much yeah and by the way according to Misty the other OLR historian how dare I how dare I give that crown to only one person because Misty just came in and snatched that crown by saying episode 285 was the Tommy Tallarico interview thank you Misty

2627
02:52:38,581 --> 02:52:40,843
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll have to try to look it up then.

2628
02:52:40,863 --> 02:52:46,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but right now I'm playing through Rage, which everybody has told me to play through, and it's good.

2629
02:52:46,527 --> 02:52:49,089
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it's kind of like a Lanier fallout in a sense.

2630
02:52:49,449 --> 02:52:52,751
[SPEAKER_14]: Now's a good time for that with QuakeCon in the air and all that stuff.

2631
02:52:52,791 --> 02:52:53,852
[SPEAKER_14]: It was just on Steam this weekend.

2632
02:52:53,872 --> 02:52:54,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, of course.

2633
02:52:54,553 --> 02:52:57,755
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a Steam nut, so I picked it up on Steam for like $10 the other day.

2634
02:52:57,775 --> 02:52:58,736
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was like, yeah, why not?

2635
02:52:59,016 --> 02:53:09,486
[SPEAKER_14]: Quickly, before I let you go, because I do have to get more calls, but quickly, since you said you're a steam nut, how do you feel about the new end-user license agreement and the waiving your right to a class action lawsuit?

2636
02:53:10,527 --> 02:53:11,988
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I don't mind.

2637
02:53:12,208 --> 02:53:18,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, they've been so good to me over the years, and I've had an account forever, so it's just like I really don't care.

2638
02:53:20,031 --> 02:53:20,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair enough.

2639
02:53:20,511 --> 02:53:21,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Send me a message in chat, by the way.

2640
02:53:21,612 --> 02:53:24,553
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not a too happy type person, so I mean, it's just like, yeah, whatever.

2641
02:53:25,033 --> 02:53:25,874
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cool with me.

2642
02:53:26,214 --> 02:53:26,514
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2643
02:53:26,694 --> 02:53:29,376
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, DarkSakura, what's this all about?

2644
02:53:29,416 --> 02:53:31,056
[SPEAKER_14]: You want a private message from the caller.

2645
02:53:31,076 --> 02:53:32,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because I was going to show him my femship.

2646
02:53:33,378 --> 02:53:33,658
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.

2647
02:53:33,738 --> 02:53:34,018
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2648
02:53:34,038 --> 02:53:35,959
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why I like playing on PC.

2649
02:53:36,019 --> 02:53:38,120
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura wants to take this conversation offline.

2650
02:53:40,841 --> 02:53:41,081
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2651
02:53:41,101 --> 02:53:41,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Take care, buddy.

2652
02:53:41,602 --> 02:53:42,142
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for calling.

2653
02:53:42,890 --> 02:53:44,071
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, bye-bye.

2654
02:54:09,662 --> 02:54:11,445
[SPEAKER_14]: Freaking Sound Shapes is fantastic.

2655
02:54:11,465 --> 02:54:11,945
[SPEAKER_14]: Tell me more!

2656
02:54:11,985 --> 02:54:13,207
[SPEAKER_14]: Why is it fantastic?

2657
02:54:14,409 --> 02:54:22,220
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a music game that is like a cross between a crappy, boring platformer and LittleBigPlanet.

2658
02:54:23,390 --> 02:54:25,131
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2659
02:54:47,148 --> 02:54:48,890
[SPEAKER_14]: I do like those creation games.

2660
02:54:49,410 --> 02:54:50,031
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you know yet?

2661
02:54:50,151 --> 02:54:52,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it easy to share the stages?

2662
02:54:53,013 --> 02:54:55,635
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it easy like LittleBigPlanet?

2663
02:54:56,897 --> 02:54:57,757
[SPEAKER_12]: That I'm not sure.

2664
02:54:58,098 --> 02:54:58,938
[SPEAKER_12]: I would hope so.

2665
02:55:00,700 --> 02:55:03,222
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I want to make a million levels.

2666
02:55:03,702 --> 02:55:07,326
[SPEAKER_14]: DJ Morpheus in our chatroom says, It shapes with sounds!

2667
02:55:07,686 --> 02:55:08,527
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly!

2668
02:55:09,187 --> 02:55:09,928
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly!

2669
02:55:09,948 --> 02:55:10,088
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly!

2670
02:55:11,961 --> 02:55:23,893
[SPEAKER_12]: It's got a charm to it, though, that makes me feel like I'm playing one of those really retro-style games, kind of like VVVVV or something like that.

2671
02:55:24,213 --> 02:55:26,616
[SPEAKER_14]: You're naming all these games I love.

2672
02:55:27,196 --> 02:55:29,518
[SPEAKER_12]: You're doing that on purpose to try and get me to be a fan.

2673
02:55:30,359 --> 02:55:31,640
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not hard.

2674
02:55:31,881 --> 02:55:32,601
[SPEAKER_12]: I've played it...

2675
02:55:33,442 --> 02:55:35,003
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's download only, so good luck with that.

2676
02:55:52,926 --> 02:55:57,208
[SPEAKER_02]: or isn't Sound Shapes on the PlayStation 3 too?

2677
02:55:57,228 --> 02:55:58,368
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was also PS3.

2678
02:55:58,468 --> 02:55:58,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh really?

2679
02:55:58,808 --> 02:56:02,589
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you can get a discount apparently if you're a PSN and you pre-order it.

2680
02:56:03,770 --> 02:56:04,690
[SPEAKER_12]: A PSN Plus member.

2681
02:56:05,230 --> 02:56:06,290
[SPEAKER_12]: I am a PSN Plus member.

2682
02:56:06,691 --> 02:56:09,351
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, so am I. Holy shit!

2683
02:56:10,252 --> 02:56:15,613
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a $20 PlayStation Network card that I got today so I'm going to pre-order it tonight.

2684
02:56:15,633 --> 02:56:17,854
[SPEAKER_14]: How did you get a $20 PlayStation card today?

2685
02:56:18,274 --> 02:56:20,775
[SPEAKER_14]: You ended work a couple days ago.

2686
02:56:22,806 --> 02:56:24,526
[SPEAKER_12]: Those, I didn't get discounts on those.

2687
02:56:25,187 --> 02:56:29,447
[SPEAKER_12]: So, no, I cancelled a pre-order and put that towards Guild Wars and this.

2688
02:56:32,348 --> 02:56:33,108
[SPEAKER_12]: I gotcha.

2689
02:56:33,388 --> 02:56:41,710
[SPEAKER_14]: So, no, no, I'm sorry, I'm searching Amazon right now to see if it is something that's retail or if it's download only, but it looks like nothing's coming up on Amazon, so.

2690
02:56:41,950 --> 02:56:44,690
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, Best Buy's website had it and it said it came out May 31st, 2012.

2691
02:56:44,790 --> 02:56:46,051
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, that's not right.

2692
02:56:46,071 --> 02:56:46,751
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not right.

2693
02:56:49,900 --> 02:56:51,221
[SPEAKER_12]: but I'm excited for it.

2694
02:56:51,642 --> 02:56:52,983
[SPEAKER_12]: You need to watch that video though.

2695
02:56:53,083 --> 02:57:03,512
[SPEAKER_12]: So now there's going to be Luminous and Sound Shapes and then DJ Max is coming out which had new videos out this week too and it's like I can't handle all the amazing music games on my Vita.

2696
02:57:03,672 --> 02:57:04,633
[SPEAKER_12]: It's too good.

2697
02:57:05,033 --> 02:57:05,874
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, fair enough.

2698
02:57:06,174 --> 02:57:07,155
[SPEAKER_12]: Anything else before I let you go?

2699
02:57:08,381 --> 02:57:12,182
[SPEAKER_12]: More people need to call in about Mass Effect because it's fantastic.

2700
02:57:12,462 --> 02:57:14,083
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, we'll try our luck with one more call.

2701
02:57:14,743 --> 02:57:15,083
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

2702
02:57:16,024 --> 02:57:22,706
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, how much did you smile or laugh when that last guy called in just to talk about how now we've passed it on.

2703
02:57:22,766 --> 02:57:24,266
[SPEAKER_14]: We got him hooked on Mass Effect.

2704
02:57:24,806 --> 02:57:27,447
[SPEAKER_12]: That needs to happen more often.

2705
02:57:27,607 --> 02:57:31,748
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't listen to the show earlier because I was playing other stuff.

2706
02:57:32,329 --> 02:57:32,549
[SPEAKER_12]: But...

2707
02:57:33,749 --> 02:57:39,933
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw that I wasn't the only person on your question of the week that said Mass Effect, so I was kind of proud.

2708
02:57:40,633 --> 02:57:41,354
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, take care, buddy.

2709
02:57:41,654 --> 02:57:42,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Gotta let you go.

2710
02:57:42,815 --> 02:57:43,095
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye.

2711
02:57:43,815 --> 02:57:46,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's try to get a couple more calls.

2712
02:57:46,177 --> 02:57:47,197
[SPEAKER_14]: We're getting slammed tonight.

2713
02:57:47,217 --> 02:57:48,118
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

2714
02:57:48,138 --> 02:57:48,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

2715
02:57:50,959 --> 02:57:51,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, this is X-Link.

2716
02:57:51,800 --> 02:57:52,620
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, X-Link.

2717
02:57:52,640 --> 02:57:53,481
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?

2718
02:57:53,581 --> 02:57:54,401
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, doing good.

2719
02:57:54,802 --> 02:57:57,483
[SPEAKER_00]: Wicked and Rent for musicals for me.

2720
02:57:57,603 --> 02:58:00,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were my two favorite to have soundtracks to, so...

2721
02:58:03,297 --> 02:58:17,848
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, the reason I was calling it tonight was because I've been playing the last few days and of course some of our other friends have too was the Kingdom Hearts 3D Dream Drop Distance or 3DDDD as I like to shorten it to call it.

2722
02:58:18,749 --> 02:58:19,749
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a really great game.

2723
02:58:19,930 --> 02:58:20,810
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed it.

2724
02:58:20,930 --> 02:58:22,271
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a lot, a lot of fun.

2725
02:58:22,431 --> 02:58:24,353
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really short but it's really fun though.

2726
02:58:26,354 --> 02:58:32,399
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really taking a lot of the old stuff and tying it back in and making it so when 3 comes out at least it'll

2727
02:58:33,004 --> 02:58:35,126
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring the storyline up to Data Part 3.

2728
02:58:40,290 --> 02:58:41,231
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you get to Tron World?

2729
02:58:42,252 --> 02:58:42,732
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I did.

2730
02:58:43,232 --> 02:58:43,833
[SPEAKER_14]: How was that?

2731
02:58:44,874 --> 02:58:45,814
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a lot of fun.

2732
02:58:46,415 --> 02:58:47,276
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed it.

2733
02:58:47,456 --> 02:58:58,725
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very unique in its own way, so I really did enjoy a lot of it and how they're splitting the storyline up between Riku and Sora, so...

2734
02:59:01,723 --> 02:59:01,843
[SPEAKER_14]: Mm-hmm

2735
02:59:23,317 --> 02:59:26,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's because of the different ways it branched out.

2736
02:59:26,861 --> 02:59:38,031
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you had, of course, you had Kingdom Heart 1, you had Kingdom Heart 2, you had the, you had Recoded, you had Chain of Memory, which Chain of Memory was practically between 1 and 2.

2737
02:59:38,892 --> 02:59:42,135
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they branched out, like, these little storylines.

2738
02:59:42,256 --> 02:59:46,600
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, with this one, at least, they're starting to take all the games and saying, okay...

2739
02:59:47,355 --> 03:00:05,446
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the story line between the games in case you didn't see like Burp by Sleep was a prequel to everything and of course so it's pretty much was all over the place but like I said before I like it how they sat down with the game so far and they're pretty much going through and tying everything together going okay this is the reason why this has happened and

2740
03:00:05,911 --> 03:00:10,415
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the reason why that one happened the way it did, and this is the reason why this one happened the way it did.

2741
03:00:10,455 --> 03:00:16,319
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of, they're taking all the pieces, tying it all together, and getting ready for that big finale at the end, hopefully.

2742
03:00:16,499 --> 03:00:18,461
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I hope to hell it is Kingdom Hearts 3.

2743
03:00:18,521 --> 03:00:30,290
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my fingers and toes crossed for Tokyo Game Show announcement, but then again, we still have to get through 13 versus... Well, they did say they are making 3, which is really good, and it's just as to when, who only knows.

2744
03:00:30,330 --> 03:00:35,554
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I told you before, I really hope when they do, they take their time, they make sure they end it, you know, they...

2745
03:00:36,280 --> 03:00:40,543
[SPEAKER_00]: They tie everything together and they end it in a way so we can go, okay, that was kind of cool.

2746
03:00:40,563 --> 03:00:42,225
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like with the whole Mass Effect.

2747
03:00:42,565 --> 03:00:49,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there one of them secret endings that gives you the extra scene that maybe it's too soon to know, but that kind of gives the big kingdom?

2748
03:00:49,490 --> 03:00:50,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there is.

2749
03:00:50,231 --> 03:00:50,771
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that.

2750
03:00:50,791 --> 03:00:52,913
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't know what it is exactly yet.

2751
03:00:52,953 --> 03:00:54,274
[SPEAKER_00]: But I hear it does tie in.

2752
03:00:54,314 --> 03:00:56,055
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to tie into that three.

2753
03:00:56,756 --> 03:00:57,076
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2754
03:00:57,416 --> 03:01:01,499
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, before I let you go, I just got to let you know, Rent, I wasn't such a fan of Rent.

2755
03:01:02,520 --> 03:01:02,840
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?

2756
03:01:03,040 --> 03:01:03,421
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I know.

2757
03:01:03,441 --> 03:01:05,042
[SPEAKER_14]: I know a lot of people are into it, but not me.

2758
03:01:07,115 --> 03:01:08,175
[SPEAKER_14]: Some people are, some people aren't.

2759
03:01:08,295 --> 03:01:09,656
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody has their own, you know.

2760
03:01:10,516 --> 03:01:10,816
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2761
03:01:11,436 --> 03:01:13,437
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll get hate mail for that.

2762
03:01:13,477 --> 03:01:13,777
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't worry.

2763
03:01:14,017 --> 03:01:14,217
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2764
03:01:14,257 --> 03:01:14,737
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care, buddy.

2765
03:01:14,757 --> 03:01:15,357
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta let you go.

2766
03:01:15,957 --> 03:01:16,377
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, man.

2767
03:01:16,397 --> 03:01:16,677
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

2768
03:01:16,737 --> 03:01:17,178
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.

2769
03:01:17,278 --> 03:01:17,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.

2770
03:01:18,638 --> 03:01:21,599
[SPEAKER_14]: One of my friends growing up was turned into a total rent head.

2771
03:01:21,799 --> 03:01:24,319
[SPEAKER_14]: And then when I told her later, you know, I saw rent and I wasn't such a fan.

2772
03:01:24,339 --> 03:01:25,539
[SPEAKER_14]: She's like, Shun.

2773
03:01:26,460 --> 03:01:27,000
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, what?

2774
03:01:27,320 --> 03:01:27,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Opinions.

2775
03:01:28,060 --> 03:01:28,600
[SPEAKER_14]: People have them.

2776
03:01:29,100 --> 03:01:29,360
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2777
03:01:29,780 --> 03:01:30,541
[SPEAKER_14]: One more call.

2778
03:01:30,601 --> 03:01:31,521
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2779
03:01:31,541 --> 03:01:31,821
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

2780
03:01:32,501 --> 03:01:36,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, hey, hey, from the Brooklyn studios, it's DJ Ranma S. How you doing?

2781
03:01:37,125 --> 03:01:38,246
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm doing good, how about you?

2782
03:01:38,586 --> 03:01:39,427
[SPEAKER_14]: Disappointed.

2783
03:01:39,667 --> 03:01:45,892
[SPEAKER_14]: Sister Act was going to be my reason to come back to New York City, and now it's gone at the end of the month, and there's no way I can afford to get there this month.

2784
03:01:46,192 --> 03:01:47,213
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, well, well, stop.

2785
03:01:47,654 --> 03:01:51,777
[SPEAKER_11]: Sister Act is your reason to come to New York when there's a bunch of us here that love you?

2786
03:01:53,098 --> 03:01:54,439
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought you, I thought it was cool.

2787
03:01:54,699 --> 03:01:57,221
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought, I thought, oh, you're wrong.

2788
03:01:57,482 --> 03:02:00,264
[SPEAKER_14]: Rama, Rama, Rama, Raven Simone.

2789
03:02:04,404 --> 03:02:30,618
[SPEAKER_14]: scene better sorry anyway actually and I will say this too DragonCon was the other thing I was really trying to get to happen but unfortunately it's not going to happen I can't do DragonCon I was hoping with the Southwest sale I could make it work but there's other priorities that's okay PAX East 2013 we got to get the Club VOG suite going

2790
03:02:32,116 --> 03:02:33,117
[SPEAKER_14]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2791
03:02:50,575 --> 03:02:52,957
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Gabe Newell is talking out of his ass.

2792
03:02:54,539 --> 03:02:56,140
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is the whole Windows 8 thing, right?

2793
03:02:56,781 --> 03:02:57,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2794
03:02:57,682 --> 03:02:58,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it is.

2795
03:02:58,322 --> 03:03:02,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I have been running Windows 8 on one of my machines here and at work.

2796
03:03:04,788 --> 03:03:10,834
[SPEAKER_11]: All you have to do is turn off the new Metro user interface and you have the desktop back.

2797
03:03:11,054 --> 03:03:11,514
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

2798
03:03:11,754 --> 03:03:12,655
[SPEAKER_11]: You mean to tell me...

2799
03:03:13,632 --> 03:03:18,054
[SPEAKER_11]: This portly man couldn't figure out how to push a button to flip it over to that?

2800
03:03:18,194 --> 03:03:19,054
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, really?

2801
03:03:19,394 --> 03:03:23,716
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's also complaining about Microsoft is having their own Windows Store.

2802
03:03:23,796 --> 03:03:26,116
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, look, Apple has the App Store.

2803
03:03:27,437 --> 03:03:29,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Linux distros have their own different stores.

2804
03:03:30,118 --> 03:03:31,799
[SPEAKER_11]: It's open competition.

2805
03:03:31,859 --> 03:03:32,799
[SPEAKER_11]: It's fair gaming.

2806
03:03:33,059 --> 03:03:35,220
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, everybody has a choice.

2807
03:03:35,440 --> 03:03:36,920
[SPEAKER_11]: He just needs to roll with the punches.

2808
03:03:37,160 --> 03:03:39,801
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're saying deal with it, sunglasses falling.

2809
03:03:40,602 --> 03:03:41,122
[SPEAKER_14]: Damn right.

2810
03:03:43,476 --> 03:03:44,037
[SPEAKER_14]: You're damn right.

2811
03:03:44,317 --> 03:03:45,818
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, Ranma, I got to let you go.

2812
03:03:45,998 --> 03:03:46,979
[SPEAKER_14]: We got to wrap up the show.

2813
03:03:47,440 --> 03:03:48,040
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all good.

2814
03:03:48,060 --> 03:03:49,221
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all I need to say.

2815
03:03:49,261 --> 03:03:50,182
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to plug your show?

2816
03:03:51,443 --> 03:03:52,344
[SPEAKER_11]: Anime Jam Session.

2817
03:03:52,384 --> 03:03:57,849
[SPEAKER_11]: This week will be our Otakon 2012 Con Report, and it's going to be quite a good one.

2818
03:03:58,434 --> 03:03:58,834
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

2819
03:04:00,014 --> 03:04:00,515
[SPEAKER_14]: Stay tuned.

2820
03:04:00,535 --> 03:04:01,335
[SPEAKER_14]: Tuesday's on VOG.

2821
03:04:01,355 --> 03:04:02,295
[SPEAKER_14]: When are you guys going live?

2822
03:04:02,315 --> 03:04:04,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that still happening?

2823
03:04:04,415 --> 03:04:08,977
[SPEAKER_11]: I gotta do some upgrades on my machines and I gotta do a run of tests then we'll go live.

2824
03:04:08,997 --> 03:04:15,318
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm hoping by the end of September because there's a lot of stuff I'm working on coming down the pipe and you know.

2825
03:04:15,578 --> 03:04:16,278
[SPEAKER_14]: Make it happen.

2826
03:04:16,338 --> 03:04:17,919
[SPEAKER_14]: Crack whip.

2827
03:04:17,959 --> 03:04:18,519
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm hustling.

2828
03:04:18,579 --> 03:04:18,899
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

2829
03:04:20,059 --> 03:04:20,419
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

2830
03:04:20,979 --> 03:04:21,419
[SPEAKER_14]: Take care, buddy.

2831
03:04:21,800 --> 03:04:22,060
[SPEAKER_14]: You too.

2832
03:04:22,080 --> 03:04:22,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Stay fabulous.

2833
03:04:23,120 --> 03:04:23,360
[SPEAKER_14]: Always.

2834
03:04:25,618 --> 03:04:27,139
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2835
03:04:27,179 --> 03:04:39,383
[SPEAKER_14]: Super sorry if you didn't get through, but you can always leave us a voicemail or you can send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com or join us in chat, get your thoughts out there or send us a tweet.

2836
03:04:39,503 --> 03:04:41,204
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to try and read some tweets right now.

2837
03:04:41,244 --> 03:04:42,164
[SPEAKER_14]: What do I do with my iPad?

2838
03:04:42,584 --> 03:04:47,226
[SPEAKER_14]: While I get my iPad, let me check in with Loki and see if there's any last minute stories from Loki.

2839
03:04:50,998 --> 03:04:56,784
[SPEAKER_02]: This whole lawsuit between Guitar Hero or I should say Activision and Gwen Stefani is still going on.

2840
03:04:57,745 --> 03:04:58,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what's the latest on that?

2841
03:05:00,567 --> 03:05:01,808
[SPEAKER_02]: They still want to sue them.

2842
03:05:02,069 --> 03:05:05,171
[SPEAKER_14]: The latest is No Doubt has a new single out.

2843
03:05:05,211 --> 03:05:05,752
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not bad.

2844
03:05:07,854 --> 03:05:11,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so apparently they are, I guess...

2845
03:05:14,309 --> 03:05:16,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're still wanting to file a lawsuit.

2846
03:05:18,411 --> 03:05:26,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, ideally they would like Activision to apologize and promise to never mistreat artists in the manner that they have been mistreated, no doubt, and countless others.

2847
03:05:32,596 --> 03:05:32,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2848
03:05:34,177 --> 03:05:38,699
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like I don't care anymore because Guitar Hero, it's not coming out anymore.

2849
03:05:40,632 --> 03:05:42,032
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2850
03:06:00,194 --> 03:06:02,176
[SPEAKER_14]: And I do remember reading about this.

2851
03:06:02,616 --> 03:06:05,198
[SPEAKER_14]: The World of Warcraft movie, apparently it's still happening.

2852
03:06:05,299 --> 03:06:08,361
[SPEAKER_14]: Sam Raimi's not involved anymore, but there is a new scribe.

2853
03:06:09,182 --> 03:06:12,725
[SPEAKER_14]: Charles Leavitt is the new scribe of the World of Warcraft movie.

2854
03:06:13,145 --> 03:06:15,768
[SPEAKER_14]: That is the dude who wrote The Seventh Son.

2855
03:06:16,768 --> 03:06:17,689
[SPEAKER_14]: What else did he do?

2856
03:06:18,250 --> 03:06:20,552
[SPEAKER_14]: Blood Diamond... Wait, hold on.

2857
03:06:20,612 --> 03:06:21,032
[SPEAKER_14]: What is this?

2858
03:06:21,072 --> 03:06:21,613
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait a minute.

2859
03:06:22,353 --> 03:06:23,914
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, yeah, he did do the latest script.

2860
03:06:24,474 --> 03:06:27,315
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so The Seventh Son is the latest movie that's coming out.

2861
03:06:27,355 --> 03:06:28,576
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I read these live.

2862
03:06:28,736 --> 03:06:31,057
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't read this article in advance before it was tweeted to me.

2863
03:06:33,158 --> 03:06:37,740
[SPEAKER_14]: Warner Brothers is putting out that Seventh Son pick on October 18, 2013.

2864
03:06:37,921 --> 03:06:41,802
[SPEAKER_14]: Other movies he's written, Blood Diamond, The Mighty, and K-Pax.

2865
03:06:42,283 --> 03:06:45,084
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't seen any of those movies, but Blood Diamond was Oscar nominated, right?

2866
03:06:45,104 --> 03:06:47,745
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it was Oscar nominated for performance, not for script.

2867
03:06:47,785 --> 03:06:49,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't K-Pax the one with Kevin Spacey?

2868
03:06:49,881 --> 03:06:51,542
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I did see that one.

2869
03:06:52,182 --> 03:06:52,522
[SPEAKER_14]: How was it?

2870
03:06:52,862 --> 03:06:53,382
[SPEAKER_14]: Was it well written?

2871
03:06:53,622 --> 03:06:54,142
[SPEAKER_14]: It was alright.

2872
03:06:54,202 --> 03:06:55,163
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think it was well written.

2873
03:06:56,023 --> 03:06:57,543
[SPEAKER_14]: So we don't know any details outside of that.

2874
03:06:57,824 --> 03:07:01,625
[SPEAKER_14]: However, they do say Legendary also has the Mass Effect film in development.

2875
03:07:01,785 --> 03:07:02,645
[SPEAKER_14]: That is still a thing.

2876
03:07:03,105 --> 03:07:04,586
[SPEAKER_14]: And that has been kind of reaffirmed.

2877
03:07:04,646 --> 03:07:04,906
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

2878
03:07:05,106 --> 03:07:05,906
[SPEAKER_14]: The Mass Effect film.

2879
03:07:06,206 --> 03:07:06,626
[SPEAKER_14]: No way!

2880
03:07:06,786 --> 03:07:07,787
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, they're doing a Mass Effect film.

2881
03:07:08,067 --> 03:07:09,587
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just talking about this earlier.

2882
03:07:09,727 --> 03:07:14,669
[SPEAKER_14]: It's supposed to be based off the first game, but I'm... It needs to be Chick Shepard.

2883
03:07:16,371 --> 03:07:40,541
[SPEAKER_14]: you know what everybody's saying it's going to be Dude Shepard and I don't know if they made that announcement officially but I play a Dude Shepard in Mass Effect but for real I actually totally agree with you I think the only way they're going to make the fans all of them happy is to do Fem Shep in the movie and I think it would be totally acceptable but at that point it's all about the casting if they don't cast the right person as Fem Shep and I don't know who it could be

2884
03:07:41,892 --> 03:07:43,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Kim Kardashian No, no, and more no

2885
03:07:55,919 --> 03:08:00,141
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, I got to pull this one up on the computer because Tigerclaw sent us another link, but it's to a video.

2886
03:08:00,481 --> 03:08:02,002
[SPEAKER_14]: And it did kind of crack me up.

2887
03:08:02,042 --> 03:08:03,142
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually saw this earlier.

2888
03:08:03,182 --> 03:08:05,403
[SPEAKER_14]: I think he or somebody else posted it on Facebook.

2889
03:08:07,124 --> 03:08:14,307
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's a guy getting a question wrong on who wants to be a millionaire that you think everybody would know.

2890
03:08:14,687 --> 03:08:15,027
[SPEAKER_14]: Here it is.

2891
03:08:15,347 --> 03:08:16,788
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, apologies.

2892
03:08:17,108 --> 03:08:19,189
[SPEAKER_14]: This is somebody shooting at their TV.

2893
03:08:19,589 --> 03:08:20,669
[SPEAKER_14]: So he's going for the $7,000 question.

2894
03:08:26,021 --> 03:08:27,482
[SPEAKER_09]: So everybody here knows that one, right?

2895
03:08:27,522 --> 03:08:28,603
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the Konami code.

2896
03:08:28,663 --> 03:08:30,625
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the Capcom code?

2897
03:08:30,645 --> 03:08:32,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's one of the answers.

2898
03:08:32,146 --> 03:08:34,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let me see if she reads them here.

2899
03:08:49,212 --> 03:08:59,037
[SPEAKER_14]: Bandai Code, Capcom Code, Konami Code Seriously, if you're going to do a YouTube shooting at your television, stop doing the dishes in the background.

2900
03:08:59,077 --> 03:08:59,657
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets in the way.

2901
03:08:59,677 --> 03:09:02,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they literally do A, B, C?

2902
03:09:03,219 --> 03:09:11,923
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can't figure out which... A was Atari Code, B was Bandai Code, C was Capcom Code, D was Konami Code.

2903
03:09:12,063 --> 03:09:13,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Gee, which one stands out?

2904
03:09:13,824 --> 03:09:14,985
[SPEAKER_14]: Derp Derp Code, well...

2905
03:09:22,812 --> 03:09:28,516
[SPEAKER_09]: so he used his lifeline called jump the question which essentially allows him to skip it

2906
03:09:30,370 --> 03:09:30,790
[SPEAKER_14]: There it was.

2907
03:09:30,850 --> 03:09:31,871
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, Konami Code on TV.

2908
03:09:31,891 --> 03:09:33,833
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the Jump the Question lifeline now.

2909
03:09:33,933 --> 03:09:35,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I haven't watched that in a long time.

2910
03:09:37,195 --> 03:09:38,876
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, they got rid of the hot seat.

2911
03:09:39,116 --> 03:09:39,957
[SPEAKER_14]: It's standing now.

2912
03:09:39,977 --> 03:09:41,298
[SPEAKER_14]: The game's all played standing.

2913
03:09:41,638 --> 03:09:42,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, who wants to be a millionaire?

2914
03:09:42,579 --> 03:09:43,459
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like a totally different show.

2915
03:09:43,479 --> 03:09:44,540
[SPEAKER_14]: But Meredith Vieira's still there.

2916
03:09:45,481 --> 03:09:46,802
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the only thing she hosts now.

2917
03:09:47,362 --> 03:09:48,523
[SPEAKER_14]: So, anyway.

2918
03:09:51,184 --> 03:10:18,374
[SPEAKER_14]: one more tweet from Osfer sent us a tweet hi guys I'd listen live but I'm going on Space Mountain instead he's at Disney World right now you butt so Osfer you know you're a great guy I like you but fuck you love OLR that's gonna do it for tweets that's gonna do it for phone calls that does it for last minute stories

2919
03:10:19,312 --> 03:10:21,554
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, and that does it for the show.

2920
03:10:22,275 --> 03:10:25,938
[SPEAKER_14]: But not before we get around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2921
03:10:26,318 --> 03:10:35,666

[SPEAKER_14]: No.

[SPEAKER_14]: I got a yay.

2945
03:12:03,744 --> 03:12:08,009
[SPEAKER_14]: And naming your WoW characters after Mass Effect characters, it's the hip thing to do.

2946
03:12:08,029 --> 03:12:12,373
[SPEAKER_05]: That means that I need to make Shakarian.

2947
03:12:13,094 --> 03:12:15,697
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, and DarkSakura, is that your final thought or do you have another one for us?

[SPEAKER_14]: We will be back next week to do it all again.

2952
03:12:22,558 --> 03:12:24,359
[SPEAKER_14]: I hear we have a special guest again next week.

2953
03:12:24,399 --> 03:12:26,281
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I can say Jason's gonna be back next week.

2954
03:12:26,341 --> 03:12:28,422
[SPEAKER_14]: He hasn't been here in a couple months so we're gonna have him back.

2955
03:12:28,782 --> 03:12:29,483
[SPEAKER_14]: Looking forward to it.

2956
03:12:29,823 --> 03:12:30,504
[SPEAKER_14]: More news.

2957
03:12:30,944 --> 03:12:33,486
[SPEAKER_14]: Really curious to see what develops on Twitter with Loki.

2958
03:12:34,726 --> 03:12:35,667
[SPEAKER_14]: and Ernest Cline.

2959
03:12:36,048 --> 03:12:37,909
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm very excited to see what becomes of that.

2960
03:12:38,250 --> 03:12:40,311
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe this whole nightmare will be over in a week's time.

2961
03:12:40,371 --> 03:12:41,472
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody will break that score.

2962
03:12:41,573 --> 03:12:47,478
[SPEAKER_02]: All they have to do is just drop that game off the list of eligible games and we'll be all good.

2963
03:12:47,498 --> 03:12:52,042
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be just ridiculously hard challenge instead of ridiculously unfair hard challenge.

2964
03:12:52,321 --> 03:12:58,503
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, if you're listening live at the VOG Network, please stay tuned for the Mars Curiosity Landing Special.

[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, science reality.

2968
03:13:05,905 --> 03:13:06,765
[SPEAKER_05]: You said science fiction.

2969
03:13:06,805 --> 03:13:07,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Science non-fiction.

2970
03:13:08,225 --> 03:13:09,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Science non-fiction.

2971
03:13:09,926 --> 03:13:10,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Science stuff.

2972
03:13:11,186 --> 03:13:11,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Bill and I would be proud.
