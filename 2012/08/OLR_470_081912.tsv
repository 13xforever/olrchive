0	20960	Tonight, August 19th, 2012, we run down the news from Gamescom, the 3DS XL is released,
20960	31680	and the Neo Geo console is set to be released all over again.
31680	35320	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
35320	37400	where every gamer has a voice.
37400	43220	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, for this
43220	49820	August 19th, 2012, with the 470th episode of our program.
49820	53480	My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about everything
53480	57200	going on in the world of gaming, and then some, with my co-hosts.
57200	59760	First off, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
59760	60760	Hi.
60760	61760	How are you ma'am?
61760	62760	I'm sore.
62760	63760	Sore?
63760	64760	Yes.
64760	66960	What have you been doing that's made you sore?
66960	67960	Well, hey!
67960	69880	What kind of girl do you think I am?
69880	71080	A DDR playing girl?
71080	72080	Yes, actually.
72080	73080	Oh, okay.
73080	74480	We'll touch on that in a minute.
74480	75480	Alright, fair enough.
75480	76680	Say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.
76680	77680	Hi.
77680	78680	How are you doing, Loki?
78680	79680	Doing good.
79680	84400	What food won the, for those that play the home game of betting on what you bring in
84400	86400	for food every week, what won this week?
86400	90440	The Double Western at Carl's Jr., or Hardee's on the East Coast.
90440	91440	There you go.
91440	95760	Alright, oh, of course, the always present fourth guest on our show is you guys at our
95760	101520	chat room, live.vognetwork.com, and we'll be reading some of the comments from our chat
101520	105320	room throughout the night, so be sure to get in there so you can participate with us.
105320	108080	Just the three of us in studio, this is the first show in a little while, it seems like,
108080	109080	with no guests.
109080	110080	It's a little lonely.
110080	113040	It's a little lonely and sad in here tonight, and I don't know how we're going to top last
113040	114040	week's episode.
114040	117420	That was a pretty good episode, so we'll try though.
117420	119920	We'll bring our best C game tonight.
119920	121160	No, you know what?
121160	122960	We actually have some awesome things tonight that are-
122960	126320	We could point a webcam at my boobs or something, I don't know.
126320	128880	Oh, the webcam's in the other, no, you took the webcam, didn't you?
128880	130820	I did take it, and it works.
130820	133880	You confiscated it, so no booby cam tonight.
133880	134880	No booby cam.
134880	137960	Well, it's so unfortunate that your Dell million doesn't have a webcam built into it.
137960	138960	Oh, wait, it does.
138960	139960	That's true.
139960	140960	I do have my iPad.
140960	141960	No.
141960	143360	And the Ustream app on the iPad.
143360	149080	And I've made sure that the webcam stuff is disabled on my laptop, because I deleted all
149080	151400	the Windows shit and have the Linux shit, so.
151400	155640	All right, in all seriousness, we have some fun stuff going on tonight.
155640	161000	We have a soundtrack preview going on tonight, which is pretty cool, from the Darksiders
161000	162000	to Soundtrack.
162000	165920	And this is going to be both for the podcast listeners and the live listeners, thanks to
165920	170920	Something Music, S-U-M, Thing, but I'll talk more about that later on, but there's all
170920	175640	sorts of information on where you can get the soundtrack at our website, vognetwork.com.
175640	180720	Of course, the Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com is the website where we tape our show live
180720	186040	for you kids every Sunday night at 6 p.m. Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after our
186040	191040	pal Bobby Black Wolf with his show, The Bobby Black Wolf Show, at 5 Pacific, 8 Eastern,
191040	192040	every Sunday.
192040	195360	And lots of other great shows at the Voice of Geeks Network as well.
195360	199760	Not just gaming shows, but shows about TV talk, like Critical Myth, and they do some
199760	204280	movies as well, British Invaders, kind of a similar thing, but with a very British twist.
204280	208440	Pod Culture is awesome, and Pod Culture's got something special tomorrow.
208440	211960	They're back with an all-new episode, they've been off for a couple weeks, but they are
211960	218000	talking to somebody who's publishing a series of books, and I'm not sure if I'm supposed
218000	222120	to give, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to say this, so a little preview, they're actually
222120	227640	doing a giveaway, so be sure to tune in and check that out at Pod Culture.
227640	228640	Lots of other great shows too.
228640	234240	Anime Jam Session, Girls Gone Wild, Hoard House, Hoard House is okay, but the rest of
234240	235240	the shows are great.
235240	240640	All right, let's see, we usually start off the show talking about our gaming weeks, but
240640	244880	we usually have a kick-off topic, and I thought I'd bring up something that's a little bit
244880	245880	recurring.
245880	246880	Crack!
246880	249560	What was the first time we talked about crack on the show?
249560	250560	No, no.
250560	252240	Two drugs, kids, drugs are bad.
252240	257200	So okay, y'all know we have a little bit of a history with Kickstarter, and kind of like
257200	261440	talking about that site, and we're not always a fan of a lot of the things we see on Kickstarter,
261440	265240	or at least I should say, I'm not always a fan of a lot of the stuff I see on Kickstarter.
265240	268600	Dark Soccer has not always been a fan of the stuff she sees on Kickstarter.
268600	272040	Loki has contributed way too many Kickstarters.
272040	273800	It wasn't that many.
273800	274800	How many?
274800	275800	How many?
275800	276800	How many's not that many?
276800	279800	It's at least five, right?
279800	280800	Six.
280800	281800	See?
281800	282800	Seven, I'm sorry.
282800	285520	All right, well here's the point.
285520	287440	I donated to a Kickstarter this week.
287440	290440	I actually finally joined the website.
290440	292720	I signed up for Kickstarter.
292720	294760	It was to expand the Mantis website.
294760	295760	No, no.
295760	296760	Heck no.
296760	298760	Oh, make that nine.
298760	299760	Sorry.
299760	300760	Nine Kickstarters?
300760	301760	Suddenly, this week...
301760	304800	You know, you can just take that money and give it to me, and I'll put it to better use.
304800	307760	This week from maybe five to nine?
307760	309200	Well, there was some I forgot.
309200	312880	I forgot, you know, I forgot about those playing cards.
312880	313880	And they're awesome.
313880	314880	They are.
314880	315880	Dan was like, wow, that's cool.
315880	319040	I forgot about the Megran thing, which I'm still waiting on.
319040	323240	There's apparently the comic coming too, but you know, it's still coming, and then Shadowrun
323240	324240	Returns.
324240	325240	Shadowrun Returns would be awesome.
325240	326800	Can't wait for that.
326800	331920	But yeah, so I actually donated to a Kickstarter this week.
331920	340560	I even went so far as to donate $180 to this Kickstarter, $180 to this Kickstarter.
340560	345000	Cue dramatic chipmunk or prairie dog.
345000	352160	There's nothing like a meme from five years ago to lighten the mood.
352160	359580	I gave 180 bucks to the GamerCon Kickstarter, the G-A-Y GamerCon Kickstarter.
359580	364840	I think it's a great idea, and I can totally see where being a startup event, they really
364840	369480	need the money to be able to reserve the venue and do something big, and it's been great
369480	370600	promotion for them.
370600	374240	And you know, as somebody who's a gamer myself, it's something I want to support.
374240	378860	So Alan kind of made it known that he wouldn't mind going, and I wouldn't mind going.
378860	382080	So if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do it big.
382080	383820	I don't do anything half-assed.
383820	387840	So I threw down for VIP passes for both Alan and I, which sent me back 180 bucks.
387840	389780	So yeah, there you go.
389780	390780	I donated to a Kickstarter.
390780	393360	You going to judge me, anybody?
393360	394600	Dark Soccer, you want to judge me?
394600	398300	I'm totally not judging you, but that means I can start my Kickstarters to support me
398300	400000	while I write a book.
400000	403320	I'll give you 50 cents.
403320	404320	What will that get me?
404320	406320	It'll get you a fart.
406320	411320	No, but I know there's a lot of people that are like, why does there have to be a GamerCon?
411320	416240	Does that mean there's going to be a StraightmerCon, and you know, just kind of all this.
416240	419200	Well Straightmer doesn't have the same ring to it, whereas gamer sounds like-
419200	422600	Heterocon or whatever it is.
422600	423600	It's not that-
423600	427660	If I can get the boobies in there, that'd be kind of cool.
427660	428660	Here's the thing-
428660	429660	I bet there is a BoobCon.
429660	430660	I'm going to look for it.
430660	431660	Here's the thing.
431660	436720	Okay, BoobCon is every other gaming convention, and there'll probably be some BoobCon at GamerCon.
436720	438280	Let's not forget the lesbians.
438280	440560	There is a BoobCon.
440560	441560	I think that's-
441560	444100	Oh, it's a Facebook utility.
444100	450940	The whole thing is, is that, you know, I like the idea of having this event and to bring
450940	454120	gay gamers together, because I've met a lot of really cool people.
454120	458720	One of my really good friends I met at a gay gamer event in the Bay Area, and we're friends
458720	459720	to this day.
459720	463720	My friend Spike, who is one of the co-hosts on the Game Buoy, we met at like one of those
463720	469280	gay gamer parties, and you know, it's not that straight people are forbidden from coming.
469280	474320	In fact, I'm sure DarkSakura is going to pre-order as soon as she's got them, as soon as she
474320	477520	has her Kickstarter funded, she's going to pre-order a ticket to GamerCon, right?
477520	478520	I'd go.
478520	479520	Yeah.
479520	482340	I don't know that I'd be able to afford, you know, $90 tickets.
482340	485400	You're not going to be shunned because you have boobies, and you're not going to be shunned-
485400	490160	I'll just wear a shirt that says HAG.
490160	497800	But here's the other thing, is that, you know, obviously, I don't know how far I want to
497800	504040	go with this controversial topic or whatever, but in the gaming culture, you know, a lot
504040	510600	of times gay guys and ladies have to put up with all this garbage we hear on Xbox Live
510600	515980	and, you know, FAG, FAG, FAG, and it's not like we're alone, there's a lot of like racist
515980	520020	stuff that happens, there's a lot of like really, really bad things that happen on Xbox
520020	521020	Live.
521020	522020	Why do you think I only play with you guys?
522020	526800	And everything negative usually has some type of connotation to like, oh so-and-so's a fag,
526800	527800	ugh.
527800	530840	It's because the people that play on Xbox Live, and actually just a lot of people that
530840	535600	play games nowadays online, are very unintelligent and young.
535600	539320	I know that for a fact from the modding community, that I talk to these people directly, and
539320	544360	it's like, can you guys compose an actual sentence without sounding stup- or like, seriously,
544360	549000	can you compose a sentence that actually makes sense, that doesn't have like any sort of
549000	551880	complete misspellings of everything?
551880	556360	But here's, here's the other part that I think a lot of people ignore.
556360	561680	And that is that, as a gay guy, there's a lot of judgment that happens in gay culture
561680	562680	as well.
562680	566560	I know, that might be shocking to you, but sometimes as a gay gamer, I don't wanna s-
566560	570960	I don't wanna sound like, oh poor me, or I've had a tragic life, no, I've had a great life.
570960	577280	But I have faced sometimes, you know, in the gay culture even, people like, oh, you s-
577280	579160	play video games all day?
579160	582040	You mean you don't like, you don't like to, uh-
582040	583040	Accessorize?
583040	587840	You don't like to go to concerts, or you don't listen to such and such artists, or you don't
587840	591480	read such and such blogs, or you know, a lot of those types of things.
591480	592480	Shun!
592480	593480	Exactly!
593480	597480	I ha- I, I know this might be a thing I'm not supposed to say, but it's true.
597480	600080	I have faced some of that in the gay culture.
600080	603500	So it's tough sometimes, because you don't feel like you fit in column A, you don't feel
603500	608960	like you fit in column B. So, I think there- it's, it's really awesome that there's a lot
608960	613460	of people raising their voice, thanks to, you know, the internet, that feel like they
613460	618160	kind of don't fit in these columns, and having a convention to just celebrate.
618160	619160	We're here!
619160	623560	And it, there's- I don't, I don't think the, the con exists to make a statement, or the
623560	627280	con exists to, uh, further the cause, or whatever.
627280	631440	I think the con exists to have fun, and that's what I plan to do.
631440	635560	I'm just gonna have, I'm gonna have a gay old time, and gay isn't happy.
635560	636560	I'm gonna have a gay old time.
636560	639400	It's gonna be a good time.
639400	644560	Well, I mean, the only other equivalent is YowieCon, really.
644560	645560	And YowieCon exists.
645560	649840	And that's more for girls.
649840	653960	I think GamerCon is just for, for anybody that just wants to have fun.
653960	656280	Sounds- In a supportive environment.
656280	657280	Great.
657280	659680	And besides that, you were talking about columns?
659680	660680	Fuck columns.
660680	661680	That game was shit.
661680	662680	No.
662680	663680	No, no, no.
663680	669240	I, I think that the moment we can move past labels and pointing fingers is why, you know,
669240	675080	when anyone says, well, I have this, or I am this, I'm like, um, you look like you're
675080	677440	a human being to me.
677440	678440	Act like it?
678440	679440	Mm-hmm.
679440	680440	So, yeah.
680440	681440	So.
681440	682440	Anyhow.
682440	683440	I mean, this is what I'm just talki- oh, sorry.
683440	684440	No, go ahead.
684440	685880	I was gonna go to some chat comments, but go ahead.
685880	689080	This is what I was talking about, about people that can't fucking complete sentences.
689080	692640	Okay, this is the guy that I'm talking to right now, I'm working on some Grand Theft
692640	694920	Auto mods, okay?
694920	698560	Did you, you know, just let her you get it to work, okay, that makes sense.
698560	700120	How about this one?
700120	702360	Should we take thing away?
702360	711760	Um, okay, just let me know, because trying to get it by today, um, okay, that is fine,
711760	715040	what do you thi- what do you think it is?
715040	720120	And just let me know when you get it to work.
720120	721520	Oh my fucking god.
721520	723640	How is Babbie formed?
723640	729040	It's like, seriously, it, ugh.
729040	733200	Let me go to some comments from our chat room at, uh, live.vognetwork.com, where we have
733200	735680	plenty of folks in chat participating live with us tonight.
735680	738660	JV Mon wants to know, where is GamerCon anyway?
738660	742280	They haven't picked a venue yet, it's gonna be in San Francisco, they've said that much,
742280	745080	but we don't know what venue, I mean, that could be a lot of different places, that could
745080	748360	be a hotel, they could do it at the Hilton, they could do it at the Moscone Center if
748360	752400	they get enough money, I don't know where they're gonna have it yet, um, so, more to
752400	756920	come on that, but it will be in San Francisco somewhere, uh, Acidic Vamp- which is another
756920	761320	reason why I wanted to go, is that, you know, San Francisco's only a two-hour drive for
761320	764600	me, I could drive in and out every day if I wanted to, but I have some friends in the
764600	768960	city, like Grandpa from Hoard House I could stay with if I wanted to, um, Acidic Vampire
768960	774240	in chat says, to find more gamers, because- G-A-Y-mers, because it's like a needle in
774240	775680	a haystack sometimes.
775680	781200	Uh, Raginator says, sadly enough, when someone proclaims that they're a gamer to someone,
781200	785280	the other person immediately pictures a fat, balding, middle-aged slob eating Cheetos in
785280	787800	their mom's basement and never goes outside.
787800	790480	Hey, I like Cheetos, just for the record.
790480	791480	Ew!
791480	794160	But ex- but no, I mean, exactly the point, is that, you know, there's kind of these,
794160	798280	like, stereotypes, and it- it's throughout all of our cultures, so.
798280	801000	And speaking of Cheetos, you know what's wrong with Cheetos?
801000	802320	Is they have those giant Cheetos.
802320	808160	I mean, really, the Chee- the cheese powder to whatever else Cheetos are made out of ratio
808160	811760	is just fucked up by that, I mean.
811760	814440	So Loki, any chance that you would go to gamercon?
814440	817880	Probably not, because I'm not really allowed to travel right now, you know.
817880	819800	So- But what if you told- what if you told the
819800	822080	wife it was a gay gamer convention?
822080	823400	She'd laugh, she would get a kick out of that.
823400	827200	Yeah, she'd probably laugh at that, because- We should- we should try to get a panel, I
827200	828200	would love that.
828200	830520	Would she let you go if we had a panel?
830520	831520	Perhaps, yeah.
831520	832520	I think we should.
832520	833520	Totally get us a panel.
833520	835320	We'll see what we can do, I don't know.
835320	837320	And free tickets.
837320	839600	Alright, moving on.
839600	842380	Let's talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week, and how
842380	843380	was your gaming week?
843380	845120	Dark soccer, you hinted at this a minute ago?
845120	847260	I played the ditter.
847260	849040	My leg- okay, this is what happened.
849040	850040	Alright.
850040	852000	That's dance dance revolution for the uninformed.
852000	853000	Yes.
853000	857920	I, um, was working at this place, and everyone knows I got laid off, but, you know, it was
857920	861640	very, uh, it was an amicable break-up, amicable break-up.
861640	866960	Um, I still got to go to the company picnic, which was at Goffland, on like some corporate
866960	867960	picnic day.
867960	872200	So, yeah, there were still a bunch of annoying teenagers, but it was okay.
872200	876480	Um, but, you got one of those little bracelets that let you get go-karts and a laser tag,
876480	881840	which I didn't do either, um, and get in the water park, which I didn't do either.
881840	887000	Um, but, uh, we just went in and had a good time, but, um, while we were waiting for lunch
887000	891200	to be served, I went inside to go play some DDR, because we also got 20 credits on one
891200	892200	of those little cards.
892200	898320	Um, well, there were already three credits in the DDR, so I'm like, I'll play them all.
898320	900240	It was on four songs.
900240	904480	So I played 12 songs back to back and decided that I'm going to finish out with Superstar,
904480	909080	because I- dammit, I'm not old, I can still do it, although I did fail Cowgirl, which
909080	911400	is very sad, because that used to be, like, one of my best ones.
911400	912400	Bang badoo bang.
912400	913400	I know.
913400	916600	But, and I made it through that, and by the time I got done, I felt like I needed to throw
916600	922680	up, because I was hot, and I hadn't done anything strenuous like that in a while.
922680	927760	And that's the point where you realized, I was in my DDR Prime 10 years ago.
927760	933200	When I weighed 30 pounds more than I do now, which is sad.
933200	938120	So anyway, I was- I went and had a good time at lunch, and I felt better once I ate something,
938120	943440	and, you know, had a good time, and my BFF Forever's Becky was there with the boy and
943440	944440	her hubby.
944440	945440	Hi, they're listening.
945440	946440	Hi, Ro.
946440	947440	Hi, Ro.
947440	951920	And it was, you know, we had a really good time, and Dan and I played copious amounts
951920	954920	of Tank Tank Tank, and there's this other game, too, that I-
954920	957200	Are you guys going to pick that up on Wii U?
957200	958200	Is it coming out?
958200	959200	Yeah, Tank Tank Tank's going to be one of the launch games for Wii U.
959200	962640	I don't know that we're getting a Wii U, but I fucking want that game, so maybe we will.
962640	965120	Okay, I'm trying to find the name of this game.
965120	971640	Okay, it's a Sega game called Let's Go Island, Lost on the Island of Tropics, and it's a
971640	975760	shooter game where you're on a- Oh, I saw that, yeah.
975760	980020	Yeah, where you're on a boat, and it's one of those quirky little Sega games, of course
980020	987600	I loved it immediately, and you play as this girl and the tour guide, and all of a sudden
987600	990880	terrorists are on your boat, and they're shooting sharks and everything, and then they get eaten
990880	993520	by the sharks, and then you're underwater being drug along by the-
993520	995760	You're on a boat, and you're fighting terrorists and sharks?
995760	997320	This game has everything.
997320	998320	It's great.
998320	1004040	When you finish each, the boss of the first level is this huge manga squid, and you also
1004040	1007160	have to jerk your controller in a certain way to get past these little cut scenes.
1007160	1009940	It's pretty cute, but-
1009940	1015640	That sounds all sorts of like, how was that game called?
1015640	1018800	Yeah, well, I totally interrupted that.
1018800	1021360	It's one of their gun shooting games that was really awesome that I loved that was on
1021360	1023120	the Wii, and also in the arcade.
1023120	1025120	Freaking Sega, of course.
1025120	1033600	Anyway, so when you finish the level, though, it does a compatibility meter to see how compatible
1033600	1040200	you are, and Dan and I were 60%, but it's also funny when you shoot the same things,
1040200	1044640	it gives you this twin bonus, and you get little hearts and everything flowing out of
1044640	1049360	it, but I died at the second stage, and so Dan continued, and he made it a little bit
1049360	1056640	further, and then when you get less than 10% compatibility, it says you wouldn't sit next
1056640	1057640	to him on the bus.
1057640	1059520	I was like, wow, that's kind of cold.
1059520	1065320	And then I played more DDR, and Dan played with me, and he's like, I forgot how to play.
1065320	1066960	I never, ever saw Dan play DDR.
1066960	1068720	Dan used to play my Dreamcast one with me.
1068720	1069720	Fun.
1069720	1072720	He could, the hardest he could do was Dynamite Rave.
1072720	1075240	Dan was one of those guys who didn't want to admit he played DDR.
1075240	1080480	But the hardest thing that he could do was Dynamite Rave Easy.
1080480	1084640	So I picked that as the last one, because he wanted to play all the old stuff, except
1084640	1087000	for Burning Heat, which, you know, Gradius.
1087000	1091920	So we played all the fun stuff, and I kept him alive, and it was just really, we had
1091920	1097400	a good time, but by the time I got out of the car after we got home, my legs had started
1097400	1098400	to cramp up.
1098400	1101400	I was like, wow, how much jumping and running was I doing?
1101400	1103440	So I was like, I'm out of practice.
1103440	1106060	So we actually discussed this.
1106060	1110640	We're going to hook back up our JPS2 and start playing our DDR games again, because I've
1110640	1116280	got those dance pads that I got at the thrift store that were like three for six bucks,
1116280	1117840	and like one of them didn't work.
1117840	1119100	The other two did.
1119100	1121840	So we're going to start playing DDR getting home.
1121840	1122840	Good luck.
1122840	1123840	Thanks.
1123840	1124840	It's all part of the plan.
1124840	1129140	Now, I got to say, when I went to Golf Land a couple weeks ago, I was, I was depressed.
1129140	1133620	Everything was, everything was broken, too many people, hot, gross, not fun.
1133620	1135400	It was clean, shiny, and extra air conditioned.
1135400	1138440	The only thing I got a kick out of was the gigantic Tetris game.
1138440	1139440	I love that.
1139440	1142360	You can play the giant balls.
1142360	1149840	I also played more games, more games, because I'm still playing through Mass Effect 2 for
1149840	1157320	Becky with a Para Themshep and Garrus, totally Garrus.
1157320	1161760	I'm still playing through Mass Effect 3, which I'm still at the same part that I am, and
1161760	1164880	every time I load it up, I just get depressed and turn it back off, and I want to play more
1164880	1165880	multiplayer next week.
1165880	1166880	Does it involve Mordin?
1166880	1167880	No.
1167880	1168880	Oh, okay.
1168880	1170880	No, um, um, um, I already passed that.
1170880	1171880	I'm on Thessia.
1171880	1172880	Oh, okay.
1172880	1173880	Oh yeah.
1173880	1174880	That part.
1174880	1175880	But this time I'm taking Javok with me and not Garrus.
1175880	1179960	Garrus gets to stay home and not be depressed.
1179960	1181200	How considerate of you.
1181200	1186720	I'm very, very considerate of Turians and their sensitive natures.
1186720	1190280	Um, I have my fourth 85 in WoW.
1190280	1191280	Addict.
1191280	1192280	Dealer.
1192280	1193280	How many do you have?
1193280	1194920	I got my fifth this week.
1194920	1197040	Well, I got my four in last time.
1197040	1199480	I now have two druids at 85.
1199480	1206760	I'm on my way to my second druid, but so now that means I have, uh, in order, Arissa, the
1206760	1213220	mage, Rebecca Black, the paladin, Garrus, the shadow priest, and Sakurina.
1213220	1219840	So next in line is probably going to be, um, uh, the troll, a city vampire in our chat
1219840	1221720	room reminds us Leviathan is coming.
1221720	1222720	The DLC for mass.
1222720	1225520	I know someone's excited.
1225520	1226520	Yeah.
1226520	1227520	Yeah.
1227520	1228520	I can't wait to check it out.
1228520	1231720	It's just, why does this all have to hit the same day?
1231720	1236280	Leviathan Guild Wars two and the big wow patch all hit the same day.
1236280	1238040	I think that probably 10 bucks.
1238040	1241040	I think the Vita patch is that day too.
1241040	1242040	I don't know.
1242040	1243040	We have a story on it later.
1243040	1245520	I'm not playing Guild Wars.
1245520	1248560	I want to check it out, but I, at least there's no monthly fee.
1248560	1250960	I know Guild Wars and one of those things I can kind of look at anytime.
1250960	1251960	Yeah.
1251960	1257000	But I mean, I've still got a, I'm probably, to be honest, not going to get, um, the well
1257000	1262240	thing right away, except, um, if I ever get paid for one of my projects, maybe I'll buy
1262240	1265760	it, you know, as a treat to myself.
1265760	1269880	It's just like while I still got other, other tunes to work on, like what's the point, you
1269880	1270880	know?
1270880	1271880	Yeah.
1271880	1275000	The thing that I'm excited about for a while is that I know this isn't courthouse, but
1275000	1280600	I'm excited that, um, all of the races are going to be available, like from the get go
1280600	1281600	for everybody.
1281600	1282600	Yeah.
1282600	1283600	That was, uh, yeah.
1283600	1284600	And that's not in our news role tonight.
1284600	1286820	Cause I was going to save that for courthouse, which is fine.
1286820	1293520	But yeah, the, the big news about, uh, anybody can play any race except don't expect to play
1293520	1295520	a Panda next Tuesday.
1295520	1297560	Pandas will unlock with Pandaria.
1297560	1302480	However, you don't have to have Mr. Pandaria to roll a Panda, but you will need to go past
1302480	1303480	level 85.
1303480	1304480	Yeah.
1304480	1310560	So, but I mean, it's still, I'm probably, cause I mean, I did temp work.
1310560	1315440	I have enough to buy the game and I'm sure I'll probably get it cause I'm still paying
1315440	1319760	for the shit till March, uh, tiger claw in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says
1319760	1322520	speaking of wow, I saw that Mr. Pandaria trailer.
1322520	1326240	The first thing that came on my mind after watching it, a bad-ass version of Kung Fu
1326240	1327240	Panda.
1327240	1330840	The trailer was released this week out of games com, the new world of Warcraft trailer.
1330840	1332280	It looked great.
1332280	1336340	The, the CGI was beautiful and you know, with all this talk about a world of Warcraft movie
1336340	1340760	and all this, it's like, just do that for 90 minutes would be great.
1340760	1344600	Although I have to say overall, I was a little disappointed in the trailer.
1344600	1350120	The reason why is that I would hope that the cinematic trailer for it would show like a
1350120	1351680	little bit of everything.
1351680	1356160	And there's so much beauty in this expansion in the realm of Pandaria and some of these
1356160	1357160	new five mans.
1357160	1358600	They don't really show any of that.
1358600	1362020	Like I wanted to see a rendered version of the temple, the Jade serpent and some of that
1362020	1363020	gorgeous stuff.
1363020	1367880	Well, I've just been looking at, um, at, uh, data dumps.
1367880	1373260	So for some of the, the internal stuff, you know, basically people just doing run throughs
1373260	1375940	of the empty temples and the dungeons and everything.
1375940	1376940	So this looks pretty neat.
1376940	1377940	Nice.
1377940	1378940	All right.
1378940	1380680	Before we turn into an episode of Horde House, let's let you finish up.
1380680	1381680	We'll move on to Loki.
1381680	1385640	Well, um, I'm also very pissed off at all the people nudging me on words with friends
1385640	1387240	and I'm about ready to delete it.
1387240	1388240	Yeah.
1388240	1389240	I'm getting that with song pop.
1389240	1390240	I'm kind of over song pop now.
1390240	1393720	Like it was fun for two weeks, but now, now I've moved on to another game.
1393720	1397360	I, and I can't help it and I'm glad I didn't pay for the game and I'm not paying for any
1397360	1401160	of it, but I still like draw something.
1401160	1404160	And the only reason I'm still playing is because I haven't paid for it and I'm not looking
1404160	1405160	at any ads.
1405160	1407380	So I'm all cool.
1407380	1410240	I have drawn some perverted shit in that game.
1410240	1411800	All right.
1411800	1412800	Loki.
1412800	1414640	Um, let's see.
1414640	1422240	I played Call of Duty, modern warfare three, a little bit of that and Minecraft, a whole
1422240	1426000	lot of Minecraft, um, getting bored with it again.
1426000	1430080	It's just like, I think the problem is I don't have a lot of people to play with and that's
1430080	1433920	really odd considering there's like so many people that bought the game, but, um, none
1433920	1438560	of my friends seem to be playing games that, you know, we can join in or whatever.
1438560	1442440	So I'm playing with my coworker and we're just like the map that we're on, we've kind
1442440	1443440	of explored everything.
1443440	1445500	I got to the point where I'm like, okay, fuck it.
1445500	1449360	I'm going to go ahead and start duping again because there's still a way you can do stuff.
1449360	1454840	So I duped a bunch of dynamite and just create a hole and I was like, wow, create a crater
1454840	1455840	board still.
1455840	1458840	It's like, may I interject one thing?
1458840	1459840	Yeah.
1459840	1462000	I saw one thing that made me love Minecraft.
1462000	1466200	It was this video that someone did and lined up explosives, everything that says I love
1466200	1472000	and when it exploded it said, but that's so mature.
1472000	1473360	I love it.
1473360	1474360	I love that.
1474360	1477440	That might be cause you know, dark soccer, if you've been listening to previous episodes,
1477440	1481000	she's not very, she kind of frowns on Minecraft, but I love that.
1481000	1485720	I love, butts may have cracked the door open a little bit to dark soccer getting on the
1485720	1486720	right crap.
1486720	1487720	It cracked the door.
1487720	1495680	I'm not saying it made me like the game, but it made me laugh like my ass off, like and
1495680	1500200	that and seeing people making giant pigs and like goombas and Mario and shit.
1500200	1501200	That was pretty funny.
1501200	1504760	You do realize I have a giant pig in my map that I have made.
1504760	1507680	I was talking about your giant pig.
1507680	1512600	Anyways, moving on.
1512600	1516120	I did happen to see like, for example, like something that was more structured to be kind
1516120	1521640	of fun, like with other people, I watched a kind of a, one of those, we play things
1521640	1526360	it was with the, machinima, I think they do that.
1526360	1532600	And it was a bunch of people playing, it's like a, like a survival type game where they
1532600	1534920	had to go out the store and survive.
1534920	1539920	They had three torches, a wooden sword, and a couple pork chops.
1539920	1544960	And just like, okay, last man standing, whoever gets back, you know, the last person to live
1544960	1547680	has to get back to the, you know, the safe house.
1547680	1551500	And then, you know, we'll score a point and it's the first person in the seven.
1551500	1553040	And that was really hilarious.
1553040	1554600	Like the Minecraft hunger games.
1554600	1555600	Certainly.
1555600	1556600	They have that.
1556600	1557600	They have that too.
1557600	1559720	But this is like, it was sort of like that.
1559720	1560720	But that looked like fun.
1560720	1564880	See, more of the structured stuff with like a lot of people, sounds like a lot of fun
1564880	1565880	with Minecraft.
1565880	1570160	In fact, when we first started playing, when it was like you, me and Bobby and then like
1570160	1572980	other people joining in, that was fun.
1572980	1578680	But now when it's just like myself and no one comes in, you know, to these worlds and
1578680	1580960	stuff, it just gets pretty boring.
1580960	1582240	I don't know.
1582240	1585780	I think that's why I kind of turned away from Minecraft in the first time.
1585780	1589560	I kind of checked it out.
1589560	1596440	Ironically though, I did also check out another Minecraft-esque game because it was cheap
1596440	1599740	and it was featured in an article I read.
1599740	1602200	It was Castle Builder Z.
1602200	1606040	And Castle Builder Z is on the Xbox Live Indie Games.
1606040	1608280	It is only a dollar.
1608280	1610080	Eighty Microsoft points.
1610080	1614300	So worth checking out for that kind of amount of money.
1614300	1620400	It's like Minecraft with your avatars, with really crappy looking graphics, I mean even
1620400	1622000	like crappier than...
1622000	1626440	I was like, Minecraft isn't exactly known for its, you know, graphical finesse.
1626440	1628600	It's like, you know, they made their own textures.
1628600	1632120	It looks like a bad texture pack on Minecraft.
1632120	1636960	But you have guns and you can craft weapons and stuff like that.
1636960	1639080	And it's zombies.
1639080	1641840	Would guns make you more interested in Minecraft?
1641840	1643600	Maybe.
1643600	1644600	And there's zombies.
1644600	1648500	Yeah, I understand there's zombies normally in Minecraft, but these aren't the zombies
1648500	1650160	that are in the regular Minecraft.
1650160	1654360	These are like, I'm gonna run at you at full speed and jump in the air and try to kill
1654360	1657680	you zombies.
1657680	1660320	And there's a dragon that tries to kill you as well.
1660320	1664880	It pretty much the whole game is like, very, very...
1664880	1665880	It's not...
1665880	1666880	I don't know.
1666880	1667880	It's kinda scary.
1667880	1672640	The sound that they have in there kinda sounds like one of those Halloween tapes or CDs and
1672640	1675320	stuff with all the Halloween spooky sounds.
1675320	1676320	But that's pretty much it.
1676320	1684240	And it's just like, I ended up barricading myself into a cave or something because the
1684240	1689880	first time out I was like, okay crap, you know, this looks like night all the time.
1689880	1694880	I mean, when it's daytime it's gloomy and lightning outside and when it's nighttime
1694880	1698800	it's dark but there's tons of shit running at you.
1698800	1703400	And so the first time I made the mistake of, oh, I forgot to get wood.
1703400	1704400	Crap.
1704400	1706200	You know, so I'm like waiting in there.
1706200	1710120	I'm like, okay, I better go outside and go try to punch a tree real quick and get some
1710120	1711120	wood.
1711120	1712120	Go punch a tree.
1712120	1713120	Only in Minecraft.
1713120	1716960	So I did that and then all of a sudden I get bum-rushed by a bunch of fucking zombies.
1716960	1720860	Or like, I don't even know, they were just something that was snarling and sounding like
1720860	1725280	a tiger or something but it looked like some sort of monster thing that ran at me.
1725280	1728960	And so I started firing a pistol at it and I didn't really do anything because I got
1728960	1731640	rushed from a few other sides at the same time.
1731640	1735000	And then it's like, okay, that was plain non-normal.
1735000	1739220	And then when you respawn it kind of respawned me close to where I was and immediately all
1739220	1743000	those mobsters, all the monsters that were right there just like crushed at me and I
1743000	1744000	died again.
1744000	1747480	I was like, crap, okay, so I got to do this differently.
1747480	1751280	Anyways, so I finally got it to where I'm like in a cave now and I've mined some stuff
1751280	1755800	and you start building weapons because you don't really have a whole lot you can build
1755800	1760440	in it because it is kind of a knockoff of Minecraft but you don't have like beds, you
1760440	1762160	can't sleep or anything.
1762160	1765760	And then there's, it always sounds like there's monsters trying to dig their way into your
1765760	1770400	tunnel and sometimes they somehow manage to get in there and I think on higher difficulties
1770400	1773320	they can dig through the tunnel and get to you.
1773320	1774320	Yeah.
1774320	1776440	Yeah, it's like, it's fucking creepy.
1776440	1781880	And they're like really silent too until they get up, like I was digging into the wall and
1781880	1785380	all of a sudden, like I noticed my screen turned red and there's a fucking skeleton
1785380	1786380	behind me.
1786380	1789400	It's just like, it's loud everywhere else but then I would have cried and throw out
1789400	1790980	the controller.
1790980	1793960	It's pretty, I think it'd be kind of interesting to check it out.
1793960	1798560	But yeah, 80 Microsoft points, I mean, it's a buck, come on and just try it.
1798560	1802760	If you want to try it, you know, if you play Minecraft, it's kind of fun, you know, you'll
1802760	1804880	get a dollar's worth of entertainment out of it.
1804880	1807900	And in general, don't forget about indie games.
1807900	1809160	Don't forget about Xbox indie game.
1809160	1810560	There's a lot of fun stuff on there.
1810560	1811560	It's not bad.
1811560	1815000	I mean, Castle Miner was one of those series, it was one of like two or three series that
1815000	1820880	were on indie games that were kind of mimicking Minecraft for a long time before Minecraft
1820880	1823520	came out and they still do and they still sell all right.
1823520	1831220	But they're fun in their own right and it's four player co-op and you can play, you know,
1831220	1832320	online and stuff like that.
1832320	1836640	So it's worth it for like, I mean, come on, you probably have 80 Microsoft points sitting
1836640	1840600	in your account that's just leftover from rock band purchases or something like that.
1840600	1841760	So definitely worth checking out.
1841760	1844860	I mean, there's tons of indie games on there that we're checking out, but that it was kind
1844860	1845860	of fun.
1845860	1846860	All right.
1846860	1849600	Well, if you're done with your gaming week, I'll do mine real quick.
1849600	1850720	Not a lot of new stuff this week.
1850720	1854800	A lot of the stuff from last week, like sound shapes and World of Warcraft and so forth.
1854800	1856960	But I did play two new games.
1856960	1858280	One of them's a little herpy derpy.
1858280	1859640	I'll talk about this real quick.
1859640	1860640	It's an iOS game.
1860640	1862480	I've been playing it mostly on my iPad.
1862480	1867460	It's called Puzzle Craft, which might make you think it's Minecraft, but like puzzle,
1867460	1868460	but it's not.
1868460	1869720	It's actually nothing like that.
1869720	1872240	It's one of those free to, well, no, it's not even free to play.
1872240	1873340	It's 99 cents.
1873340	1877600	But then of course they charge you for all these upgrades in the game, like extra coins
1877600	1878600	and stuff.
1878600	1880280	You don't really have to do it.
1880280	1885360	The crux of the game is that you're building this town and you get all the materials to
1885360	1892920	either get food or get materials to build things in your town in this whole little match
1892920	1896880	game where you, like they call it match three in the description, but it's not bejeweled
1896880	1897880	at all.
1897880	1902940	It's like trace the consecutive line of like all the little pieces of grain in the puzzle.
1902940	1907120	Like try to trace it and then they all disappear and new stuff falls and kind of goes like
1907120	1908120	that over and over.
1908120	1912200	And it's one of those things that's just like so stupid that I'm playing this, but it's
1912200	1913200	addicting.
1913200	1916520	It's just cute and you have this little town of villagers and some of them wear chicken
1916520	1917520	outfits.
1917520	1918520	It's really cute.
1918520	1919520	So whatever.
1919520	1920520	There's that.
1920520	1923640	The other game I've been playing a little bit, just a little bit because it just came
1923640	1927880	out today is New Super Mario Brothers 2 on the 3DS.
1927880	1929800	I did pick that up today.
1929800	1932800	It just came out today, so I haven't had a lot of time to play it, so I can't give it
1932800	1933800	a full review.
1933800	1937040	I'll post something more in depth on vognetwork.com later this week.
1937040	1938040	Plug plug.
1938040	1942160	But how similar is it to New Super Mario Brothers?
1942160	1946800	It's pretty much the same damn game, but is that such a bad thing?
1946800	1952200	Well no, but at the same time it kind of feels a little bit like they didn't put a lot of
1952200	1955080	effort into it if it's pretty similar.
1955080	1957160	Well I mean there are some new stuff.
1957160	1962080	I mean especially with this I kind of think the whole like Mario's after coins.
1962080	1965920	I think it's it's a little bit corny, but some of the power-ups are neat.
1965920	1968600	Like I love the one that turns you into giant, although I guess that was in the previous
1968600	1971640	games too, but I was like ooh giant Mario.
1971640	1975920	And then you know the ones that have the gold coins where you can kick and it leaves like
1975920	1980960	a trail of coins and the fireball that makes all the blocks turn into coins.
1980960	1982600	It was kind of neat.
1982600	1986600	Really where the game shines, as it usually does, is level design.
1986600	1991120	I've played a lot of really well designed levels.
1991120	1996600	Halfway into world one you can, if you find it in the fortress, there's a, I'll give you
1996600	1997600	a hint.
1997600	2002000	You don't want a spoiler, mute your thing for 30 seconds, but here's a hint.
2002000	2006440	In the very first fortress there's a room that you go in with these green blocks that
2006440	2007720	spin around.
2007720	2010680	Look for an exit in that room that's not the main exit.
2010680	2011840	I'll give you that hint.
2011840	2016440	And you'll find yourself in the world mushroom world or whatever, which is kind of like I
2016440	2018200	guess like the secret world.
2018200	2022360	And the stages get a little harder, but like one of them was like really neat design because
2022360	2028080	the way the blocks were, you had to figure out like how you could fall through the blocks
2028080	2030160	to get all the coins.
2030160	2033240	It's kind of hard for me to explain without like showing you a visual, but just like the
2033240	2038240	way the blocks were, it looked like one solid block, but it's got all these lines in it.
2038240	2040600	So you had to, I don't know.
2040600	2042880	3D doesn't really add anything to the game, but that's okay.
2042880	2046680	I'm totally okay with 3DS games not whoring the crap out of 3D.
2046680	2052000	If you want the 3D stuff, go play Mario 3D Land, which you know did it very well.
2052000	2055880	But yeah, I liked it so far.
2055880	2061400	You know, I'll probably play it to completion and it's got some interesting street pass
2061400	2066760	things where you can play a sequence of three random stages and try to get as many coins
2066760	2067920	as possible.
2067920	2071520	And then you street pass to somebody else and you get their records, so you can try
2071520	2075240	to play the same three stages they did, even though it was randomized.
2075240	2079200	So it's kind of like, I don't know, kind of has that Mario Kart-esque competitive element,
2079200	2081960	which wasn't in any other Mario game so far.
2081960	2082960	So that is something new.
2082960	2083960	I'll give it that.
2083960	2085600	Kind of a little different.
2085600	2087200	I will get into this in the show a little later.
2087200	2092060	They're promising the DLC will be worth it, essentially.
2092060	2096360	So I'm curious about that, because again, level design is where these games tend to
2096360	2097360	shine.
2097360	2102280	Well, this is all they really need to do since the engine was done a few times.
2102280	2103280	Yeah.
2103280	2105260	I mean, I'll be honest in that regard.
2105260	2109820	If I'm going to razz the game, it's that it's really the first Mario game I've played in
2109820	2115640	a long time where I go, this really isn't original, which I know is weird because Mario
2115640	2117600	games are essentially all the same mechanic.
2117600	2118600	But think about it.
2118600	2120880	You know, in the original Super Mario Bros. and then there's Mario Brothers 2.
2120880	2122680	It's like, holy shit, this is totally different.
2122680	2125760	And then Mario Brothers 3 kind of went back more towards the first one.
2125760	2128400	But you know, Mario, if it ain't fixed, don't break it.
2128400	2130440	Mario World was like completely modes.
2130440	2131440	Yeah.
2131440	2132440	Yoshi and all this.
2132440	2133440	Then Mario 64.
2133440	2134440	Oh my God.
2134440	2135440	3D.
2135440	2136440	Mario Galaxy.
2136440	2137440	Oh my God.
2137440	2138440	The planets and everything is just different.
2138440	2140760	It's like the first one in a long time I've played where I'm like, yeah, okay.
2140760	2145320	It's pretty much the same thing as the last game with some coin grabbing elements.
2145320	2147720	That's the one bad thing I could really say about it.
2147720	2149280	Otherwise it's a Mario game.
2149280	2153260	Like what Super Mario Brothers game has been bad.
2153260	2154680	I'm not talking about spinoff game.
2154680	2158100	I'm not talking about like Mario is missing and all these like spinoff games.
2158100	2161560	What core Mario Brothers game has been bad?
2161560	2162560	Just straight up bad.
2162560	2165480	I don't even think Mario Sunshine you could say was a bad game.
2165480	2167480	I still think Mario Sunshine was great.
2167480	2168480	Mario Sunshine.
2168480	2174480	I mean, yes, it's a formula, but it's a solid fucking formula.
2174480	2176440	Go with it.
2176440	2177440	There you go.
2177440	2182440	I should go to the chat room, live.vognetwork.com.
2182440	2183440	Let's see.
2183440	2186480	Shayna Linko's in chat saying, I'm at a bit over 30K coins so far.
2186480	2188000	It gives me incentive to keep playing.
2188000	2191960	Yeah, the back of the box says something about getting a million coins and I guess you get
2191960	2192960	something special.
2192960	2193960	I don't know.
2193960	2197040	It's probably just all the levels backwards or something.
2197040	2199320	StartUpG says the raccoon power up is back.
2199320	2200460	That is true.
2200460	2205780	It's not Tanooki Mario anymore like it was in the Wii one or the last, no, the Mario
2205780	2206780	3D Land at the doogie.
2206780	2210940	It's just straight up raccoon Mario, just like you remember it in Mario three.
2210940	2215800	In fact, there's a lot here that's just like you remember it in Mario three.
2215800	2217880	Like you go to world two.
2217880	2219040	It's a desert world.
2219040	2220040	What a shock.
2220040	2222800	It's kind of a lot of the same formula.
2222800	2227560	Well it is the third new Super Mario Brothers game, so maybe it's new Super Mario Brothers.
2227560	2228560	Maybe it's not that new.
2228560	2232240	They should just call it well polished Mario Brothers.
2232240	2236360	Isn't that a little something, you know, it's like really you couldn't have come up with
2236360	2242100	a better name for the series other than, yeah, it's a new Super Mario Brothers game.
2242100	2243600	Interesting point from Dark Tetsuya.
2243600	2248800	Ironically, Mario two's original version, meaning the Japanese version, lost levels
2248800	2250080	here, right?
2250080	2252560	Wasn't too different from Super Mario Brothers one.
2252560	2256720	Just the level layouts and some of the little things they added cranked up the difficulty.
2256720	2258080	That's a great comparison.
2258080	2263400	You know, lost levels or Mario two in Japan really wasn't that different from Mario one.
2263400	2266640	Different graphics, a little different mechanic with Luigi's jumping.
2266640	2270600	Well, and Mario two that we got wasn't even a Mario game originally.
2270600	2271600	Right.
2271600	2272600	But I'm not talking about that.
2272600	2274840	I'm not talking about the whole, that whole thing I'm talking about.
2274840	2275840	Yeah.
2275840	2277560	Where they say, Oh, how innovative, how different.
2277560	2278840	It wasn't even a Mario game.
2278840	2279840	True, true.
2279840	2283640	But I mean, go back to the loss levels or Japanese two and one.
2283640	2286380	That's a very, I mean, I don't think loss levels is a bad game.
2286380	2289320	It's a really, it's a challenging asshole game.
2289320	2290580	It is.
2290580	2293400	And there's some asshole stages in this that I've played so far when you get into those
2293400	2294400	special worlds.
2294400	2297120	So let's see.
2297120	2304060	Tiger claw says the next version would be new, new Super Mario Brothers.
2304060	2307320	Very new Mario Brothers 2015.
2307320	2312480	Well, you know, what's funny here could be a band themed one because new Super Mario
2312480	2314720	Brothers, you too, you know, Oh yeah.
2314720	2315720	What up?
2315720	2316720	G reminds us.
2316720	2317720	Mario two had the poison mushrooms.
2317720	2318720	That was a little different too.
2318720	2319720	Okay.
2319720	2322840	But here's, here's the one tiny concern I have.
2322840	2326920	If I'm already looking at this game going, all right, it's cool, but it's not very, it's
2326920	2327920	not that original.
2327920	2332340	It's not as original as Nintendo wants you to think it is, but what's going to happen
2332340	2337020	when that Wii U Mario game comes out because these games are not coming out with a lot
2337020	2338680	of time apart between them.
2338680	2341720	What's that Wii U Mario going to bring to the table?
2341720	2343960	Isn't that going to be the same damn thing again?
2343960	2344960	It's the same thing.
2344960	2349200	But now with the gimmick that, Hey, look, a fifth person, because I don't know about
2349200	2352640	you, but I always have about five people in my living room wanting to play the Wii.
2352640	2354800	Oh wait, no one wants to play the Wii.
2354800	2355800	Okay.
2355800	2360280	So five people supposedly in this room playing the Wii U and one person is gonna be like,
2360280	2361880	Hey, I'm moving the platforms.
2361880	2366080	Look, I'm, I'm, I'm like, you know, I'm contributing.
2366080	2368920	It's like almost like that dumb person that you have in your room.
2368920	2370800	Well, it's like, you know what?
2370800	2372940	Billy's not going to play the game because he's too stupid.
2372940	2374000	He's going to keep dying.
2374000	2379480	So we're going to let him move the platforms up and down because that's all he can handle.
2379480	2382000	So five people to play this to its full potential.
2382000	2383000	Yes.
2383000	2384720	This game is going to sell like crazy in Utah.
2384720	2386640	Go figure.
2386640	2393900	So it's just, I, if someone even made it, I had to laugh because there was a comment.
2393900	2398800	It was a developer actually, uh, for those get trying stuff on the Wii U.
2398800	2403880	And they were saying, all Nintendo is trying to do is sell a, uh, TV size DS.
2403880	2406680	I'm like, we've been, he's like, why isn't anybody in the games pressing?
2406680	2409600	And they're like, we've been fucking saying that for months.
2409600	2413020	That's all the Wii U is going to be is just a giant DS.
2413020	2419640	He's all, you know, basically the D or the Wii U game pad works well at a demo kiosk.
2419640	2423140	But when you actually back it away from the TV, then you have to constantly look down
2423140	2425520	at your controller and stuff like that too.
2425520	2427400	It just doesn't really flow well.
2427400	2429700	Uh, alpha Kananagram in our chat room says sky.
2429700	2432920	It's going to bring in H fucking D. Okay.
2432920	2437120	I can respect that and all like I'm, you know, Mario and HD will be fine and all, but let's
2437120	2438120	be real.
2438120	2441120	New Super Mario Brothers is not the game I want to see in HD.
2441120	2444560	F fucking zero is the game I want to see in HD.
2444560	2445560	Hello.
2445560	2448840	Or even a new like 3d Mario game would be pretty awesome.
2448840	2449840	That would be awesome.
2449840	2450840	Yeah.
2450840	2452360	I'm like, that's, it's not exactly the greatest starting point.
2452360	2459120	Can you imagine a Metroid prime in HD imagine like a super Mario world esque game in 3d
2459120	2463040	like kind of like Zelda ish, you know, big adventure type game.
2463040	2464640	That would be fucking awesome.
2464640	2466120	Not new Super Mario Brothers.
2466120	2467120	You.
2467120	2468120	All right.
2468120	2469520	Last comment from chat and then we're going to move on with the show.
2469520	2473120	Tiger claw says, but by the way, new Super Mario Brothers two, does it take advantage
2473120	2474160	of the 3d?
2474160	2475960	How does the 3d look on a 2d plane?
2475960	2480000	I think I said this a little bit before, but it doesn't really use the 3d a lot.
2480000	2482280	I mean, it's pretty much the backgrounds on one layer.
2482280	2487320	I mean, there, there are some subtle effects, but, but that's okay.
2487320	2488960	I want to, I want to point this out.
2488960	2492760	Not every 3ds game has to whore the 3d like crazy.
2492760	2495000	I think this is a good thing.
2495000	2497920	It's the 3d is subtle and is not a game changer.
2497920	2501860	If you want a game that whores the 3d, but does it very, very, very well, go play the
2501860	2508120	Mario 3d land, because that was an original Mario game, despite the fact that certainly
2508120	2513160	it has a lot in common with Mario 64 and all that because the 3d brought some awesome elements
2513160	2514160	into it.
2514160	2519560	That game felt very original, despite the fact it was a formula at the end of the day.
2519560	2524960	So go figure maybe, maybe sitting next to Mario 3d land.
2524960	2527600	This game feels a little bit like a step backwards.
2527600	2528600	I don't know.
2528600	2529600	That sounds like a very harsh thing to say.
2529600	2534120	It makes it sound like I don't like gamers, but you know, cause three land was actually
2534120	2538520	pretty innovative and it was a pretty awesome game.
2538520	2539520	I don't know.
2539520	2543160	New Super Mario Bros, the first one was a pretty awesome game, but it's just, you've
2543160	2549920	done it now three times and you're going to do it again one more time and you haven't
2549920	2553160	really changed it up that much.
2553160	2557600	I mean, it's basically like, cause even before it was like, Hey, look, we created this tech
2557600	2562120	demo of the, the Miis running around in like this New Super Mario Brothers thing.
2562120	2564080	And that's, that was the Wii U tech demo.
2564080	2568680	And I'm like, that's just New Super Mario Brothers, but they have, you know, it was
2568680	2569800	just a tech demo.
2569800	2570800	And then guess what they did?
2570800	2572760	Cause they did this with all their fucking tech demos.
2572760	2574120	They turned it into a game.
2574120	2577640	It's like, Oh my fucking God, you didn't do anything.
2577640	2583280	You just, you just have four, you have four people running around in this game, just like
2583280	2584680	you can on the Wii version.
2584680	2588480	Oh, but there's a fifth person that can do shit for some reason.
2588480	2592120	I'll probably still get a Wii U.
2592120	2594480	I got problems.
2594480	2595600	I got problems.
2595600	2596880	Don't get it at launch.
2596880	2598000	We'll see.
2598000	2599320	We'll see.
2599320	2601080	There's nothing coming.
2601080	2602080	There's nothing.
2602080	2605920	Despite everything I'm saying, despite I look, I'm just going to admit it.
2605920	2608920	Despite everything I'm saying here and now about originality and all that.
2608920	2613720	The first time I play that New Super Mario Brothers Wii U or whatever in HD, I'm going
2613720	2616440	to be like, Oh, I want it.
2616440	2619280	And I'll have it cause I want it.
2619280	2622560	I'm not planning, I'm not planning on buying one.
2622560	2624040	I don't, I don't need that system.
2624040	2625240	I don't play the Wii enough.
2625240	2628000	I'm no.
2628000	2630800	All right, let's move on with some gaming news.
2630800	2637360	Oh wait, housekeeping, uh, visit us at twitter.com slash O L R or on Facebook, facebook.com
2637360	2638840	slash orange lounge radio.
2638840	2643800	And of course visit our network that we are affiliated, affiliated with and tape live
2643800	2648940	at the voice of geeks network or vog network.com I wrote a review of sound shapes so you can
2648940	2649940	check out.
2649940	2650940	That's there.
2650940	2653800	And there's some other, a book review went up last week of Stargate by a, the guy from
2653800	2656640	critical myth and lots of good stuff on the site.
2656640	2657640	So check that out.
2657640	2661960	Vogue network.com let's get into some gaming news.
2661960	2665640	Loki just, I guess tons of Sony shit coming out of games com.
2665640	2669120	Well there's like 20 stories and I'm like, you know what?
2669120	2670120	This is do them all.
2670120	2671120	Let's do them all.
2671120	2672120	Here you go.
2672120	2673120	All kind of tied to each other.
2673120	2674520	Well it's some non Sony stuff real quick.
2674520	2678080	Um, there was a game that Capcom kind of brought out of nowhere.
2678080	2682080	They're calling it kind of the, um, you know, the game of games com.
2682080	2685080	It was remember me, which was kind of cool.
2685080	2688000	It had a little bit of like you hack into people's memories.
2688000	2692920	Um, I always think of that fucking terrible movie with Robert Pattinson that had that
2692920	2693920	twist ending.
2693920	2696480	You remember that it was called remember me?
2696480	2698940	No cause I never saw it.
2698940	2700160	So I don't remember it.
2700160	2701160	It's terrible.
2701160	2702480	The twist ending is terrible too.
2702480	2703480	Yeah.
2703480	2705280	So it was like the watchdogs of game con.
2705280	2706280	It looked pretty awesome.
2706280	2707280	Okay.
2707280	2711120	So it's nice to see there's going to be some of these really big games coming out next
2711120	2712120	year.
2712120	2713120	That are original.
2713120	2714120	Our original.
2714120	2715120	Yes.
2715120	2716120	Exactly.
2716120	2719840	But Sony, Sony was kind of shocking cause they had a press conference during games con
2719840	2724960	and they actually had like a lot of new IPs that they brought out.
2724960	2728400	Um, just like, wow, you know, this is amazing.
2728400	2734820	So one of the games that they showed off was a puppeteer and puppeteer, um, I guess is
2734820	2741560	coming from Sony on or I guess, uh, yeah, Sony online entertainment and it's a new platformer
2741560	2750840	from a Sony Japan studios and it's very, it reminded me of, um, like clockwork night.
2750840	2755140	If you remember that from the Sega Saturn, at least that's what it reminded me of.
2755140	2760220	But it was very unique looking game, like kind of a platformer with this like puppet
2760220	2764440	looking animation, two different things, but it was pretty cool.
2764440	2765760	So they have that come out.
2765760	2771000	Um, another game they had was rain, which kind of reminded me a little bit of limbo.
2771000	2776360	Um, or even that one game, a loss in shadow that came out from Konami.
2776360	2780840	It's basically a PlayStation network game that's going to be coming out that features
2780840	2786520	these invisible, like an invisible boy who, um, can only be seen in rain.
2786520	2792800	Um, so you're wandering around this environment and stuff and solving puzzles based on, uh,
2792800	2797160	you know, this kind of invisible character, which is a kind of neat.
2797160	2801040	And then I don't know what I should think about this one, but until dawn, it's going
2801040	2805400	to be a teen horror movie style game that utilizes the move.
2805400	2807440	That actually sounds kind of awesome.
2807440	2811680	I hope, I hope this is night trap bad.
2811680	2812680	That would be awesome.
2812680	2817800	I think, I think the industry needs a good team, like the annoying parts of night trap,
2817800	2819120	like the watching the monitors.
2819120	2820120	Yeah.
2820120	2822520	The industry needs a game like night trap again.
2822520	2823520	Let's be real.
2823520	2824520	Time to resurrect.
2824520	2825520	Dana Plato.
2825520	2831640	Apparently you play as seven, um, different teenagers facing unspecified horrors in the
2831640	2837360	woods, you know, cause that's pretty much every horror movie, um, at least recently.
2837360	2843360	And then, um, one other thing they showed off wonder book again, and I've got to say
2843360	2847240	this presentation of wonder book was way better than the one that they did at E3.
2847240	2851140	It was shorter and they showed some new stuff, including not only are they going to have
2851140	2855720	the whole, you know, uh, book of spells thing, which looked okay in the new trailer, but
2855720	2861000	they have this new, um, they got a licensing with BBC's walking with dinosaurs, which looks
2861000	2862520	pretty awesome.
2862520	2868640	And digs night crawler, which is kind of a noir fairy tale type game.
2868640	2874440	You play this worm who's a detective solving fairy tale crimes, kind of sounds almost like
2874440	2875440	it could be a book.
2875440	2879700	You know, I think it might even be a book series, but, um, those will be coming out
2879700	2880700	later on.
2880700	2884840	Uh, I think right now wonder book is launching with books of spells and that's it.
2884840	2885840	Wait.
2885840	2889440	So does this mean you have, you have come full circle, full circle and you are a fan
2889440	2890440	of wonder book now?
2890440	2891440	I'm not a fan of it.
2891440	2894860	No, but it looks, it looks interesting for people that might be into that stuff.
2894860	2900640	Like I was thinking for, uh, the accounts I deal with, like ideal library chain or you
2900640	2907880	know, the old libraries in the U S and obviously this type of stuff would be good for them
2907880	2909340	or people that sell books.
2909340	2912280	But no, for me personally, no.
2912280	2916120	You know, what's making a comeback though that ain't got sh or that wonder book ain't
2916120	2917480	got shit on.
2917480	2918480	You know what?
2918480	2919720	You know, what's making a huge comeback.
2919720	2922400	Brace yourself for it.
2922400	2928840	Fucking reading rainbow is back.
2928840	2929840	Seriously?
2929840	2930840	Yeah.
2930840	2934940	It's like, I think it's like an iOS type thing now.
2934940	2939320	Like they're making apps out of it where it's not like a show, but it's like, cause LeVar
2939320	2943440	Burton pimping books better how LeVar Burton associated with it.
2943440	2945480	Like, okay, here's the thing.
2945480	2950200	Imagine if wonder book instead had been called reading rainbow, we would all be losing our
2950200	2951200	shit over it.
2951200	2955280	All they had to do is get LeVar Burton out on stage going, it's the shit guys.
2955280	2964520	We would have been like, take my money, take it, take it of the intro to this show.
2964520	2967000	I love that old logo too.
2967000	2968960	It's so eighties and gorgeous.
2968960	2973020	The only thing that pissed me off about reading rainbow is that the books were always checked
2973020	2974160	out at the library.
2974160	2975320	You try to go find the books.
2975320	2976320	They were always gone.
2976320	2982340	No one in Alabama reads.
2982340	2988080	Some other cool stuff, um, before all that they were showing media molecules new game
2988080	2993300	and it's just fantastically and it's a game called tear away.
2993300	2997760	It's on the Vita and basically the whole world kind of looks like paper.
2997760	3001360	And so a lot of the stuff you can do in there, you can actually interact with the game.
3001360	3005360	So like you can push your finger up on the back of the touch panel and you'll actually
3005360	3011640	see your finger coming through the screen, which is kind of weird.
3011640	3015200	Um, you can literally finger your Vita.
3015200	3018960	You can literally finger your via, yes.
3018960	3024720	Um, but it's going to utilize the camera in different motion based stuff and it looks
3024720	3028120	fantastic cause it's meeting molecule.
3028120	3029120	I mean, come on.
3029120	3030120	I'm sorry.
3030120	3034920	I'm just so glad the Vita's finally found a use for that back touch pad.
3034920	3037720	Now you can watch your finger go up the Vita.
3037720	3038720	Yep.
3038720	3039720	Yep.
3039720	3040720	You can.
3040720	3044760	Uh, they showed off a kill zone mercenary, which is going to be a new first person shooter
3044760	3045760	on the Vita.
3045760	3047480	Uh, look kind of cool.
3047480	3053840	They also showed call of duty black ops declassified, which I was very interested in picking it
3053840	3060000	up until I realized that it's the guys that made the last resistance game, burning skies
3060000	3061320	and that game sucked.
3061320	3063960	So probably not going to pick up this call of duty game.
3063960	3066880	Can we go back to the fingering thing for a minute?
3066880	3071720	A sitting vampire in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says someone's going to put their Dick on
3071720	3072720	it.
3072720	3075960	So what would happen if you put something besides it?
3075960	3080720	Stances like someone hasn't already, what would happen if you put like something else
3080720	3081720	on the back touch?
3081720	3082720	Here's the thing.
3082720	3086920	I don't really understand how it works because they're going to have, it actually is an image
3086920	3087920	of your finger.
3087920	3088920	It like utilizes the camera.
3088920	3090000	Like it captures that.
3090000	3094320	So yes, you would see a penis coming up through the back of the screen.
3094320	3097000	If you were somehow, or would your penis turn into a finger?
3097000	3098000	I don't know.
3098000	3099000	All right.
3099000	3102200	Well, I'm assuming it's not, I'm, that's a really big finger.
3102200	3103200	I don't know.
3103200	3104200	For some people maybe really small.
3104200	3106200	Is that your thumb?
3106200	3110760	Cause there's no way for the camera to capture the image of your finger, you know, on that
3110760	3111760	back touch panel.
3111760	3117120	It just doesn't, it's out of the scope of the lens, but I don't know.
3117120	3122120	I mean, let's say have you capture your finger, but I think that yes, that is your finger
3122120	3125760	look like a sea cucumber.
3125760	3130240	This is one of the great mysteries.
3130240	3137820	What will happen when you put your Dick on the rear touch pad?
3137820	3140600	Find out on the next OLR.
3140600	3147840	You'll make it, you'll make a mess.
3147840	3150200	I don't want to have that trade in system.
3150200	3151200	Yeah.
3151200	3159000	I played a lot of tear away alone at night.
3159000	3160560	There's too much penis.
3160560	3166680	Speaking of, uh, into windows, I guess ratchet and clank full frontal assault is coming to
3166680	3173720	the Vita as well.
3173720	3178200	You did that on purpose.
3178200	3179920	Rob's red.
3179920	3182560	Um, full frontal assault.
3182560	3183560	Yeah.
3183560	3187400	Not only will it be a full frontal assault on the Vita, but also on your PS3 and it's
3187400	3190840	going to be one of these games that utilizes this brand new thing to be announced, which
3190840	3195940	is the PlayStation cross by, which is awesome.
3195940	3196940	Cross by.
3196940	3201120	Basically you purchase a game on the PS3, you get the Vita version for free.
3201120	3202120	Fuck.
3202120	3203120	Yeah.
3203120	3204120	That's the way you do it.
3204120	3205120	I like, this is a great trend.
3205120	3206120	That sound shape started.
3206120	3207120	Exactly.
3207120	3211000	Um, another game that's got feature that I hope though, because this was a good point
3211000	3214520	that came up when Bobby was talking about this earlier on his show, I want it to not
3214520	3215640	just be digital.
3215640	3218800	That's my concern is that that would only be the deal if you get it digitally.
3218800	3219800	It's going to be digital.
3219800	3222760	I thought, Oh, but I'm running out of room on the PS3 and then I'm going to buy a bigger
3222760	3228680	hardware memory card, that's, that's the trick is that those stinking Vita memory cards are
3228680	3229680	so expensive.
3229680	3233800	They're not that expensive, but did they come down to price finally when they released the,
3233800	3235240	the prices of those aren't that expensive.
3235240	3240220	I thought it was, no, um, uh, another game that's going to support that as well is going
3240220	3242080	to be PlayStation all stars.
3242080	3245160	JV Mon reminds us in chat play pinball arcade on the Vita.
3245160	3246160	Does that too?
3246160	3248160	I have it on my phone.
3248160	3249160	On my phone.
3249160	3251160	I don't need a Vita.
3251160	3255840	Um, also another, um, game that's going to support that little big planet.
3255840	3258280	The DLC is also cross platform.
3258280	3263120	So if you buy, you know, any DLC you have now for a little big planet one and two, we'll
3263120	3266540	work with a little big planet Vita and little big planet carding.
3266540	3267720	So that's kind of cool.
3267720	3268720	That's awesome.
3268720	3269720	Yeah.
3269720	3271420	A little big planet carding I hope is one of those games too.
3271420	3275200	I think it is one of the cross buying games, so that's pretty sweet.
3275200	3279920	And then, um, PlayStation plus coming to the Vita as well and they're upping the cloud
3279920	3282000	storage to one gigabyte.
3282000	3284120	So, um, that's pretty sweet.
3284120	3289120	Also announced that, um, I guess Europe is going to be getting Red Dead Redemption, um,
3289120	3290120	free in September.
3290120	3292000	So that's pretty sweet.
3292000	3295200	Um, and then also PlayStation mobile.
3295200	3298520	They talked a little bit about that and talked about some of the launch games and there was
3298520	3300640	a big old trailer on there.
3300640	3304920	And one of the things I saw, I remember was Lemmings and I'm like, Holy shit, Lemmings.
3304920	3306520	But uh, that's going to be one of the games.
3306520	3312800	Uh, also they mentioned that, uh, PlayStation mobile will be compatible with, uh, Sony Xperia
3312800	3315680	phones, uh, also Vitas.
3315680	3320600	And then they revealed that, uh, the ACES and Wiki pad tablets are going to be getting,
3320600	3322960	um, PlayStation mobile as well.
3322960	3326800	And they're going to be adding stuff or different devices to that as well.
3326800	3329680	So that's pretty cool.
3329680	3330680	That's everything.
3330680	3334200	That's a lot of news coming out of Gamescom, but that makes sense because Sony has a pretty
3334200	3335320	big presence in Europe.
3335320	3338400	They've always done pretty well there ever since the original PlayStation.
3338400	3339840	So it's kind of exciting.
3339840	3342640	And then I'm assuming there'll be even more Tokyo game show.
3342640	3343640	Right?
3343640	3346000	Uh, probably that's pretty cool.
3346000	3349960	I'm really excited about the whole Vita PlayStation three crossover.
3349960	3353560	I'm glad that I'm like, I'm glad that I'll be able to do something with my Vita cause
3353560	3358800	I haven't really, I'm telling you sound shapes, sound shapes is a great, they should be pushing
3358800	3359800	it more.
3359800	3363040	It's, it's a great holdover game until they get some more stuff.
3363040	3367760	I wonder if that final fantasy 10 remake is going to be, um, buy one, get both because
3367760	3370400	they were pimping it for both systems.
3370400	3372280	Well it's right now.
3372280	3374160	It's been first party that's been doing that.
3374160	3375160	Oh yeah.
3375160	3376160	Yeah.
3376160	3377160	Technically it's pretty cool.
3377160	3381320	I mean that might get me the, by the PS three version of black ops two, maybe if it was
3381320	3382320	like that.
3382320	3386560	Although, like I said, black ops class of declassified, the fact that it's being done
3386560	3391280	by the guys that the resistance brings guys and the trailer just didn't look that great.
3391280	3394240	I was just, uh, made me sad.
3394240	3395240	All right.
3395240	3402000	Well in case you haven't heard the 3ds XL did release today, the suggested retail price
3402000	3403000	$199.99.
3403000	3406120	Although there are some deals out there, like I know Fry's electronics was selling it today
3406120	3407120	for $179.99.
3407120	3411480	Uh, so, you know, look around on the internet and all that stuff to see where you can get
3411480	3412480	the best deal.
3412480	3417320	Sadly, we don't get the Pikachu version here, uh, but we do get the red version.
3417320	3419960	I think there's a red and a blue one that came out here.
3419960	3423480	And of course new super Mario brothers two also released today as I already talked about,
3423480	3426460	uh, it's kind of the kickoff game for that console.
3426460	3428440	So there you go with the 3ds XL.
3428440	3429440	Just a reminder.
3429440	3430440	It is out.
3430440	3432920	Get the red one, put a Charmander sticker on it.
3432920	3437360	My big like concern about getting one of these right now is that again, I think I mentioned
3437360	3440920	this last week, they'll just turn around and release like a really beautiful color.
3440920	3443920	Like that purple, that purple 3ds is so gorgeous.
3443920	3448080	Like I wish that had been the launch color that they would have never had to do another
3448080	3449080	color.
3449080	3450080	That'd be great.
3450080	3452200	So I'm, I'm curious about the XL.
3452200	3457600	I've heard it's a good system, but at the same time, like I, do I want to pay 200 bucks
3457600	3459160	for a new one when I already have one?
3459160	3460160	I know.
3460160	3461700	I don't think I can justify that really.
3461700	3463120	So we'll see.
3463120	3464120	But it's out.
3464120	3465120	Dark Sakura.
3465120	3469600	Well, we do have some news on the corporate front.
3469600	3472360	I'll say, I'll, I'll put it in those words.
3472360	3475160	Who remembers on live?
3475160	3480280	I remember their big booth at E3 and nobody, like nobody thought on live was going to work.
3480280	3483160	And then they showed up at E3 and they were like, this works.
3483160	3485960	And everybody's like, holy shit, it does work.
3485960	3491480	Well, um, right now they're actually, uh, there was something going around about a sort
3491480	3493640	of bankruptcy going on.
3493640	3497180	And honestly, this article is really hard to read because all the texts has crossed
3497180	3498920	over and the HTML is screwed up.
3498920	3501640	Well there was so much and there was so much back and forth on this this week.
3501640	3504680	Like nobody really has a clear understanding what's going on.
3504680	3505680	Totally.
3505680	3506680	The coding on this is awful.
3506680	3508340	Just saying.
3508340	3512840	So anyway, basically they were saying that there was an acquisition of their assets by
3512840	3515260	a company as a sale.
3515260	3518720	Instead it has to do with like, um, bankruptcy protection.
3518720	3524240	They have, I believe, been acquired, but in, in kind of a different deal.
3524240	3526080	Well, you know what's different about it.
3526080	3527080	They won't say who.
3527080	3528080	Yeah.
3528080	3529080	That's the big thing.
3529080	3530080	It's not weird.
3530080	3533600	It sounded to me that they created their, like their own company, like they created
3533600	3534600	another company.
3534600	3535600	I call this OnLive2.
3535600	3536600	Off Dead.
3536600	3537600	Off Dead.
3537600	3538600	Let her finish.
3538600	3539600	Let her finish.
3539600	3540600	Cause I want to get into this a little bit.
3540600	3542280	Well, here's what the, what the official quote is.
3542280	3546640	It's like, we can now confirm the assets of OnLive Incorporated have been acquired into
3546640	3551960	a newly formed company and is backed by substantial funding and will continue to operate the online
3551960	3556600	game and desktop service, blah, blah, blah, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
3556600	3564320	They are releasing the OnLive employees, um, and I think have put out a call to rehire
3564320	3568440	them with the new company, which I mean basically how this worked with the company that I worked
3568440	3574440	for before when we were sold is that, yeah, we were released from the previous corporation,
3574440	3580040	but we were hired quote by the new company as, and we know with all of our tenure and
3580040	3581520	everything intact.
3581520	3587400	So I think that what it's looking like is either they have fully released them or they
3587400	3590440	are sending the note out there that, yeah, we want you here.
3590440	3594920	We want to keep you around, you know, just maybe trying to get them to reapply through
3594920	3596440	different hiring channels or something.
3596440	3603560	I mean, maybe you want to bring them all and see, you know, if they're loyal to the product.
3603560	3604560	I don't know.
3604560	3606560	The whole thing is a little weird.
3606560	3608200	You know, it was very, like, this is super bizarre.
3608200	3609500	You should have seen this play out.
3609500	3613220	You should have seen this playing out on Twitter because like, you know, you know, at first
3613220	3615960	it was OnLive has completely shut down.
3615960	3616960	They're bankrupt.
3616960	3617960	They're gone.
3617960	3623560	You know, and the OnLive Twitter, they've yet to really say anything officially.
3623560	3626240	And it was at the point where, like, people were reporting, yeah, we drove down to the
3626240	3630180	OnLive offices and we see people are walking out of here with boxes and all this stuff.
3630180	3633560	So clearly the company's not going to hire some people back.
3633560	3638040	And I think everything's just in this big state of flux right now.
3638040	3643720	You know, and it's never good news when people lose their jobs in the gaming industry, and
3643720	3645920	this is always tough to talk about.
3645920	3654040	But I do have to ask the hard question, OnLive kind of, I mean, as a service, it was bringing
3654040	3657080	a lot of great things to the table, but the one thing that was really missing was like
3657080	3658080	games.
3658080	3662560	Like, a lot of the games that it launched with when launching is your first impression
3662560	3665620	were years old and kind of old news.
3665620	3667960	And sure, they tried to add to that.
3667960	3671080	And they did some cool things with the service, like the replays and some of that other stuff
3671080	3672080	they were doing.
3672080	3676720	And the desk, I'm sorry, the TV top systems and all that they were doing, they had some
3676720	3677720	great ideas.
3677720	3681480	But it's like, they just didn't have the games to back it up, and they didn't have the deals
3681480	3683160	to back it up like Steam did.
3683160	3687180	The coolest thing they had going for it were the hour-long demos that you didn't really
3687180	3688180	have to download anything.
3688180	3690080	You just did it through the cloud.
3690080	3695400	But it wasn't, like, they weren't really getting exclusives or, you know, it was tricky.
3695400	3696400	It was tricky.
3696400	3700360	And I can see where the company's hurting when they're, you know, I think the report
3700360	3704360	had come out that only several thousand people out of the millions that had signed up were
3704360	3706320	only ever on the service at any one time.
3706320	3707320	Yeah.
3707320	3709600	Sixteen hundred and they had eight thousand servers.
3709600	3714000	So that was a lot of unused servers that had to be maintained.
3714000	3721960	So I'm just really, I mean, they clearly, someone believes in the product.
3721960	3727600	I just want to look at Sony bought their biggest competitor, Gaikai, which was a very similar
3727600	3728600	sort of thing.
3728600	3732560	But Gaikai was kind of doing, they had the whole stuff in the browsers and they were
3732560	3736080	getting some deals where the demos were streamed to them like they were kind of trying to push
3736080	3737400	the envelope a little more.
3737400	3739720	And, you know, now Sony acquired them.
3739720	3740720	Yeah.
3740720	3744400	Here's the other thing that kind of sucks, too, is basically some of the people were
3744400	3748000	offered, you know, consulting arrangements also.
3748000	3752840	They said that, you know, they had they asked some of the employees to help smooth the transition
3752840	3754080	to the new startup.
3754080	3759000	And those people were offered stock options in the new company.
3759000	3765040	However, that's those stock are basically worthless unless the company at some point
3765040	3770960	becomes profitable and, you know, basically it's sold or goes public.
3770960	3780880	So you get an IOU, maybe we'll fulfill that money if if we are successful.
3780880	3784600	Well, best of luck to the folks that find themselves displaced this week with a whole
3784600	3785840	on live stuff.
3785840	3791120	I hope they're able to land work quickly somewhere else, as we usually feel in these types of
3791120	3792120	situations.
3792120	3793120	So.
3793120	3794120	All right.
3794120	3796120	Anyhow, if that's it.
3796120	3797120	Yeah.
3797120	3798120	Let's move on.
3798120	3803800	So speaking of other cloud services, GameStop, they have a cloud streaming service that's
3803800	3809080	going to be coming to PCs, tablets and Internet TVs.
3809080	3814320	Of course, you know, you may remember that they acquired Spawn Labs and Impulse last
3814320	3815320	year.
3815320	3821120	And basically it said based on consumer feedback, our success in selling mobile devices and
3821120	3828680	imminent launch of new consoles, we have decided to move our technology to PC based model.
3828680	3835560	And, you know, they're going to be only offering it to those devices not going to be coming
3835560	3840240	to any sort of game consoles in the future, probably because I would be willing to bet
3840240	3843920	that those other companies have their own streaming ideas in place.
3843920	3846360	Like we know Sony clearly Sony does.
3846360	3849760	So maybe Microsoft's kind of going that similar route.
3849760	3854060	So it's not that yes, we're not going to put our stuff on those consoles.
3854060	3859120	More like those console developers don't want us to put our stuff on their consoles.
3859120	3864180	So, you know, one of the first rumors I read was that Microsoft bought on live, which would
3864180	3867000	seem like, no, it's just that's not what happened.
3867000	3870460	You know, because sometimes Microsoft buys companies.
3870460	3875120	But I think in this case, they'll try to just reinvent it and make it better and put their
3875120	3876120	own name on it.
3876120	3877120	You know what I mean?
3877120	3878120	Yeah.
3878120	3881880	I don't think if it was like bought by Microsoft, they'd be more, you know, more open about
3881880	3882880	it.
3882880	3883880	Fair about it.
3883880	3884880	Yeah.
3884880	3885880	We're going to lay everybody off.
3885880	3886880	But that was one of the first early.
3886880	3889340	You know, you know how Twitter goes, people.
3889340	3892520	Everybody's everybody's a skeptic and everybody's an analyst.
3892520	3895840	So yeah.
3895840	3901640	So yeah, they're saying, you know, I guess GameStop had proposed a scenario before where
3901640	3904740	they were saying that users would need to own a retail copy of a particular game they
3904740	3906400	wish to stream from cloud.
3906400	3910480	Although now that's not necessarily going to be the case, because if it's not going
3910480	3914280	to tie into consoles, then what are they going to own?
3914280	3915620	So I don't know.
3915620	3916880	It's an interesting idea.
3916880	3921880	And I know how they're selling their own tablets and stuff, but it seems like it's such a crowded
3921880	3924080	market space out there.
3924080	3929040	I mean, I know you can trade in games for like these tablets and phones and stuff, but
3929040	3931280	why would I want to buy?
3931280	3933000	Why would I want to stream games from them?
3933000	3934000	That just doesn't.
3934000	3935000	I don't know.
3935000	3940000	It just doesn't seem appealing to me at all.
3940000	3944000	I like the idea of being able to like stream demos and things like that without having
3944000	3946440	to download like, like that whole secret world.
3946440	3949780	I talked about that a couple of weeks ago, this MMO that I tried out the secret world.
3949780	3953600	I had to download a 15 gig thing to try that just to figure out that, you know what, I
3953600	3954760	don't really have time for this right now.
3954760	3958480	It would have been a lot nicer if I could have just streamed it through something like
3958480	3961080	this and to make my opinion.
3961080	3963040	And there are other MMOs that allow you to do this.
3963040	3967120	I'm sorry to be so MMO centric, but you know, it's kind of what comes to mind is it's a
3967120	3971640	great, that's a great use for the streaming technology is, is the demos, of course.
3971640	3974760	Are you getting your full graphical potential of the game that way?
3974760	3977320	I don't know, but yeah, that's another thing.
3977320	3982560	And then also, you know, with some of these devices, um, you know, not everybody's upgraded
3982560	3986720	their wireless network, so you may be running wireless G and that's going to throttle you
3986720	3992360	a little bit and, um, or you know, you have to be connected to the wifi for the stuff
3992360	3993360	to work.
3993360	3999760	Uh, for most part, I just, I, my tablet has a weird tendency to cut in and out of the
3999760	4000760	wifi too.
4000760	4004840	Like I'll be connected to wifi and then like once every 15 minutes, it just drops for 15
4004840	4005840	seconds.
4005840	4006840	And that'll kill your game.
4006840	4011960	If I'm trying to stream gamings off that don't like dealing with GameStop is kind of where
4011960	4012960	it's at there.
4012960	4013960	Yeah, that's a good point.
4013960	4017640	They will find a way to take the shrink wrap off those digital downloads before I purchase
4017640	4018640	them.
4018640	4024020	I, I just know it's going to happen, but all right, well, this is a game that, uh, maybe
4024020	4028120	some of you will be streaming through a console later unconfirmed, but I don't know.
4028120	4029120	It's a big game.
4029120	4034040	Uh, Tekken tag tournament two, uh, you excited about this?
4034040	4038240	There's some more information that came out about this from game com, uh, games com, excuse
4038240	4043560	me, Tekken tag tournament two, it will support 3d so you can have, you know, 3d fighting
4043560	4046040	and kicking and all that 3d can be switched on or off.
4046040	4049560	The depth can be adjusted to whatever it is that you like on there.
4049560	4053840	There's also something called Tekken tunes where you can make your own custom soundtrack
4053840	4056860	by importing your own CDs or MP3s or whatever.
4056860	4061440	There's also fight lab, which is a way that beginners can learn the play mechanics.
4061440	4066280	There's a robot fighter named combat and you will practice your techniques on that in order
4066280	4067880	to get through the fight lab.
4067880	4071380	I also noticed there's like a design, a character mode, like they have a little kitty girl here
4071380	4075840	that's been made in the fighter mode, which seems to be a big thing in the Namco games
4075840	4076840	lately.
4076840	4077840	I like that's what soul caliber is all about.
4077840	4081880	Now I want the ability to make a Tekken three gin.
4081880	4085460	Um, yeah, so there you go.
4085460	4088480	Some of the new stuff coming in Tekken tag tournament two, I'm sure you're going to be
4088480	4089480	picking this up right there.
4089480	4095120	Well, if I have money now, I'm the one who's not working at this table.
4095120	4098400	Some moves, just, you know, some moves in this whole create a mode thing.
4098400	4101080	They have to be unlocked in the game.
4101080	4106920	So like if you want to, uh, get an, uh, if you want to get the Phoenix smash from Paul,
4106920	4109600	you have to get an S rank in order to get that.
4109600	4113920	So interesting or cheap or cheap.
4113920	4119240	So Tekken tag tournament two coming soon, dark soccer.
4119240	4121680	Well in other news, you know what?
4121680	4125980	I kind of want to play the sad trombone for this Rob, because this is how I feel looking
4125980	4126980	this over.
4126980	4132720	Oh, we can arrange that, but well, you know, and you're, you're, you're going to know why
4132720	4133720	I went at the moment.
4133720	4144840	I say the game, final fantasy 14, well, um, basically they're, uh, they have this thing
4144840	4150520	called a realm reborn, which is, uh, the relaunch of final fantasy 14.
4150520	4157280	Um, and, uh, there's an interview with, um, Naoki Yoshida, um, who is saying that losing
4157280	4162800	your fans trust is an easy thing to do and regaining it is very hard.
4162800	4167880	They, um, really think that they're going to be able to, uh, regain the fans trust by
4167880	4170140	rebuilding final fantasy 14.
4170140	4173760	And they want that to be where they launch it from, say, Hey, this is great.
4173760	4178060	What's 15 and 16 going to be like, well, first of all, I'm like, stop numbering them.
4178060	4179920	They won't be online MMOs.
4179920	4180920	Let's hope.
4180920	4185840	Um, he's quoted as saying over a long time, we'll try to regain their trust, but it is
4185840	4191440	something we as a company must put effort into long term, but they, they're admitting
4191440	4195000	that they're probably not going to get it back with just the one game.
4195000	4202080	So right now, um, a realm reborn is in, uh, alpha it's a beta testing is going to be going
4202080	4208440	on later in the year and the PlayStation three group will be invited to join in on the beta.
4208440	4212760	So, um, another thing that he pointed out is that in the entire history of the final
4212760	4218720	fantasy, uh, series, there has not been one that failed, which is why they're not giving
4218720	4219920	up on 14.
4219920	4225360	You know, there's a lot of people that respond to that by saying, what about 13, but 13 wasn't,
4225360	4229160	why would they wouldn't have made 13 two if 13 was a failure.
4229160	4233440	Some people just straight up didn't like 13, which, you know, I can get the reasons why
4233440	4234760	people weren't into 13.
4234760	4235960	I liked it an awful lot.
4235960	4238200	If you didn't like it, it doesn't mean something failed.
4238200	4239200	Exactly.
4239200	4240360	Very good point.
4240360	4241360	Very good point, internet.
4241360	4243400	It just means that you don't like it.
4243400	4246560	Other people do shut up, get over it, but don't take it.
4246560	4247560	This is okay.
4247560	4249000	I have to read a minute.
4249000	4253960	It pisses me off when I say I don't like something and someone else immediately says, Oh, well
4253960	4260680	I do, you're wrong or will I do as if I'm wrong or vice versa.
4260680	4266200	One person liking something or disliking something that you do not is not a personal reflection
4266200	4267200	on you.
4267200	4274600	Oh, person of very small willpower and self-worth, you know, end of rant.
4274600	4277560	But we can all agree final fantasy 14 was bad, right?
4277560	4278560	We can, we can all agree on that.
4278560	4279560	I didn't play it.
4279560	4280560	I actually can't tell you if it was bad or not.
4280560	4281560	It probably was.
4281560	4285560	I haven't played it, but from what I heard, I'm just trying to make a joke.
4285560	4287520	Obviously somebody's paying for it out there.
4287520	4288840	They wouldn't have any servers running.
4288840	4291800	I mean, I'm sure there's people that probably like it.
4291800	4294360	There are people who are like, I don't have anything else better to do.
4294360	4299200	I feel like our chat room at live.vognetwork.com has suddenly become a support group.
4299200	4302360	Break Man says some of us like Final Fantasy 13.
4302360	4304360	JV Mon says, I like 13.
4304360	4306200	Stan says, Hey, I liked 13.
4306200	4307280	I didn't like 12.
4307280	4308520	I liked what I played of it.
4308520	4309520	I just got a little bored.
4309520	4313000	Dungeon Buster says 13 was still commercially successful.
4313000	4316200	Kitsune says, I liked Final Fantasy 13 too.
4316200	4319760	Didn't like dash two as much just because of that ending.
4319760	4327280	But I mean, it's, it's the whole thing where it's like, I really don't know why people
4327280	4328280	do this.
4328280	4332040	I mean, it's probably a little shortsighted of me to say it's because someone has low
4332040	4337640	self esteem or thinks that everything that people are talking about is about them.
4337640	4340200	Maybe a little ego instead, who knows?
4340200	4345880	But just because someone doesn't like something that you do, don't take it as a personal offense
4345880	4346880	the other way around.
4346880	4349880	It has no reflection on you as a person.
4349880	4355960	Uh, JV Mon in chat says, I dislike Final Fantasy seven, but respect other people's opinions
4355960	4358080	who differ from my own.
4358080	4359440	A model citizen.
4359440	4360440	Yes.
4360440	4365560	Uh, RDG Singe says, I like Duke Nukem forever.
4365560	4368380	You were entitled to like it.
4368380	4369680	You were entitled to like it.
4369680	4374480	I personally think that it was, um, what's a good description?
4374480	4383280	A festering pile of shit, but, um, I love 10 and 10 too.
4383280	4384280	I'm sorry.
4384280	4387320	Breakman says, stop talking about my low self esteem.
4387320	4388320	How dare you?
4388320	4389380	Wait, what are we talking about?
4389380	4394240	It's just, I don't know what it is.
4394240	4399200	It's a big internet thing, definitely, but it's also a human thing for people to want
4399200	4403360	everyone to like the same things that they do or hate the same things that they do and
4403360	4409280	poopoo anybody else who doesn't think the way I do, dammit politics, which is a little
4409280	4413720	bit more important, but it's video games are the most important thing.
4413720	4416800	What are you talking about?
4416800	4423520	But it's at the same time as like, okay, fun, fun of fantasy 14.
4423520	4427300	They're looking at it as a failure fiscally.
4427300	4428560	It's probably a failure for them.
4428560	4431340	It's probably pulling in just enough money to keep a couple of servers up.
4431340	4432340	It is.
4432340	4435640	It is a little bit unprecedented when it, no matter what your personal opinion is on
4435640	4440000	14, if you think we're too hard on it or what it is, it is unprecedented for a game company
4440000	4443600	to come out and apologize for a game.
4443600	4444600	Yes.
4444600	4447360	And they are taking steps to fix it.
4447360	4451740	They clearly believe that there's something with that product that's worth salvaging.
4451740	4454880	And for all the people out there, like what brought me to this point, regardless in that
4454880	4460760	say 13 was a failure fiscally, financially, I'm sorry, that's what I mean.
4460760	4461760	Was it a failure?
4461760	4465900	No, it made them buckets of money.
4465900	4470880	Game guru in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, for example, I don't like F zero, but
4470880	4472480	I respect that it is a great game.
4472480	4473480	Just not a racing game.
4473480	4475880	I like, well, you are entitled to your wrong opinion.
4475880	4477480	Shut up.
4477480	4478480	Now go sit in the corner.
4478480	4479520	Well, here's me.
4479520	4482440	I don't like strategy games.
4482440	4484320	Couldn't sit through Warcraft to play it.
4484320	4486040	Love World of Warcraft.
4486040	4494480	It's just the third time, fourth, fourth, fourth because I played with each expansion
4494480	4495960	until I liked it.
4495960	4502360	Um, but I mean, I love the universe, hate the first series of games, you know, it's
4502360	4505280	just has to personal preference.
4505280	4509340	I notoriously can't stand Final Fantasy eight and it's not the story that bothers me.
4509340	4510340	It's fucking boring.
4510340	4511880	It's that fucking fighting system ruined.
4511880	4512880	I know.
4512880	4517760	Well, I love the story so much by the time I got to the third disc, bore for reals, but
4517760	4523600	the whole point is, is that take personal opinion out of the equation and look at it
4523600	4524600	for what it is.
4524600	4525820	How much money did it make?
4525820	4528240	How big of a player base does it have?
4528240	4530420	That determines in the terms.
4530420	4532280	That's what the stockholders are looking at.
4532280	4533280	Exactly.
4533280	4538400	That determines right there if something is a failure as a product or not.
4538400	4542080	Now for everyone who bought Final Fantasy 13 and hate it, they still got the money.
4542080	4543080	They, they like it.
4543080	4544080	Sorry.
4544080	4548320	They still got your money at one and the story, but when you've got an ongoing product that
4548320	4553200	people are going to play, play, pay a subscription for, that's a different story and for that
4553200	4555200	you have to deliver month after month.
4555200	4559140	All right, well let's travel around the world and check out what possibly controversial
4559140	4561320	new releases are coming out this week.
4561320	4563760	I don't really know if there's anything controversial, but we'll see.
4563760	4567800	Let's start in the U S Loki is going to be short.
4567800	4571720	There's fall of Cybertron, PS3 and 360.
4571720	4572720	That's it.
4572720	4573720	Dang.
4573720	4578180	Well, we did just have a system launch today and a big Nintendo game, so it's not technically
4578180	4579180	new system.
4579180	4583480	It's about as new as like, say, you know, new Super Mario brothers two.
4583480	4585780	There's some big PC games in a couple of weeks too.
4585780	4589520	So that's, that's, that's that.
4589520	4590520	All right.
4590520	4591520	Uh, let's go to Japan.
4591520	4596080	Uh, Japan's looking a little bit empty this week as well on the Xbox 360 there is the
4596080	4599320	Witcher two assassins of Kings enhanced edition.
4599320	4602740	I don't know what's enhanced about that, but that's on the 360 this week.
4602740	4606160	That's the only thing on the, um, 360 in Japan.
4606160	4609000	Otherwise on the PlayStation three, no more heroes.
4609000	4611560	Red zone edition gets the best treatments.
4611560	4613200	That means a price reduction.
4613200	4614360	Also I don't know what this is.
4614360	4615760	It's a, a hybrid disc.
4615760	4618000	I think this is a game and an anime.
4618000	4624160	It's Rene no Lagrange, Kamogawa days, and it's the game and the anime.
4624160	4625160	Yeah.
4625160	4626160	Cool.
4626160	4627600	And that's kind of something we see on the PlayStation three happened a little bit is
4627600	4631960	that you have the game slash movie or whatever it was a PlayStation network game in the movie.
4631960	4632960	Yeah.
4632960	4636200	So, uh, seeing that a little bit more and more, the VITA has got a little bit going
4636200	4637240	on this week in Japan.

4825560	4826920	anymore
4826920	4829560	all right just a couple new stories away
4829560	4832120	from the classic game of the week and
4832120	4833520	dark soccer picked an obscure one
4833520	4835600	tonight I think I think super obscure
4835600	4837640	plays a little bit here it's a good game
4837640	4839800	I just need another copy of it sometimes
4839800	4842560	it's about finding the hidden gems there
4842560	4843920	you go all right first though a couple
4843920	4846080	more stories for you guys Loki all right
4846080	4849520	so there was some announcements regarding
4849520	4853480	origin it's coming to Mac because you
4853480	4855600	know they have games on the Mac so of
4855600	4858120	course it would so of course Peter Moore
4858120	4859840	announced that you know during gamescom
4859840	4861800	it's going to be coming to a few
4861800	4864160	different platforms including smart TVs
4864160	4868560	the Mac Android and Facebook and they're
4868560	4871640	also going to be you know adding some
4871640	4873520	new features including free-to-play
4873520	4875960	gaming which is I think where the
4875960	4879080	Facebook and Android comes into play and
4879080	4885800	achievements hoorah hooray now you can
4885800	4887760	play broken games of Mass Effect 3 on
4887760	4889520	the Mac I guess it doesn't necessarily
4889520	4890960	mean the games are coming out on those
4890960	4893440	systems but origin will be there you
4893440	4896200	know origin cannot I this this boggles
4896200	4899080	my mind if Alan and I want to play our
4899080	4901480	two friends at the same house in the Bay
4901480	4904040	Area we can't do it origin can't handle
4904040	4906040	two people in one place versus two in
4906040	4908280	another place we can do two on one or
4908280	4910680	them two against what we can't do two
4910680	4912720	on two it is not possible in origin
4912720	4918000	setup really really I bet steam can
4918000	4920480	handle that it probably to be fair we
4920480	4922360	haven't tried but I don't see why it
4922360	4924640	wouldn't work I've played some I I've
4924640	4926880	never really had a game that failed
4926880	4928520	miserably playing it through steam like
4928520	4930840	I had a great sieve five match not that
4930840	4933480	long ago borderlands is through game spy
4933480	4935400	so that's a little different I don't I
4935400	4938360	wouldn't measure that so whatever all
4938360	4941560	right well speaking of underappreciated
4941560	4944920	classics the neo geo remember the neo
4944920	4946880	geo yeah I've looked at one the other
4946880	4948680	day you've got one in your house right
4948680	4951160	to actually those others are expensive
4951160	4952960	have a neo geo and a neo see you know
4952960	4955080	how Dan got his neo geo huh he traded a
4955080	4958360	Sega CD for it wow well you might have
4958360	4960000	to make room on the shelf for this it's
4960000	4963920	the neo geo X gold that's right it's a
4963920	4967080	new system is in now there were rumors
4967080	4968560	about this before that this is coming
4968560	4971200	but it is confirmed the neo geo X gold
4971200	4976880	is a thing it's a $200 thing hey neo
4976880	4978320	geos were never known for being cheap
4978320	4981040	right now the cool thing is though even
4981040	4982600	for being a $200 system it does come
4982600	4983840	with a bunch of pre-installed games
4983840	4986880	these games used to be like $200 apiece
4986880	4990280	if you remember such classics like art
4990280	4992840	of fighting to magician Lord metal slug
4992840	4995560	baseball stars to fatal fury and fatal
4995560	4998480	fury special king of fighters 95 samurai
4998480	5000640	showdown 2 king of the monsters all this
5000640	5002160	is built in so it's pretty those games
5002160	5003920	already there's a lot of I mean and I'm
5003920	5005560	only reading part of the list so there's
5005560	5007640	a good looks like about 20 games or so
5007640	5010400	that are installed I noticed though I
5010400	5012600	don't see bust a move on this list I
5012600	5014440	don't see or you know puzzle these
5014440	5016800	everyone to call these are all SNK games
5016800	5019080	that was tied oh good point good point
5019080	5022360	well anyhow there is also this I guess
5022360	5025680	here's the weird thing it is a handheld
5025680	5028240	so it's like it's a handheld system but
5028240	5031840	it's also I guess you can plug it into a
5031840	5034160	docking station and then it's a TV thing
5034160	5036760	too that's kind of cool I got to say
5036760	5038320	yeah it's a docking station that's a
5038320	5041680	video out that's pretty cool that my
5041680	5044800	dingoo does the same thing and was a
5044800	5049840	whole hell lot cheaper and yeah I I
5049840	5051600	think it's kind of cool but I don't
5051600	5053280	$200 is a steep price to pay for
5053280	5055720	nostalgia especially you can purchase
5055720	5058560	like one of those like 48 and 160 and
5058560	5063720	one neo geo used by the games on your
5063720	5066120	geo arcade carts and get super gun for
5066120	5068320	way fucking cheaper that I have a super
5068320	5070000	gun it's like an all-in-one card thing
5070000	5073560	that literally plugs into neo geo
5073560	5076240	controllers it's pinned out for that and
5076240	5081240	I have a 16 one cart so nope not gonna
5081240	5085600	buy yeah I don't know I this thing would
5085600	5087280	have to be really something special in
5087280	5088520	order to get me to buy I will say though
5088520	5091400	they the the little joystick they have
5091400	5093880	with it is like a mock replica those you
5093880	5095440	know those things are rock-solid those
5095440	5097120	controllers of the four buttons so it's
5097120	5099320	it's a nice controller I will say that
5099320	5103400	your love that I love them honestly
5103400	5105640	made playing all these games because
5105640	5107840	it's the arcade experience yeah I'll
5107840	5111920	give it that that's pretty cool to
5111920	5113600	register participation for this week's
5113600	5115680	episode of orange lounge radio on vog
5115680	5117840	network comm use the passphrase
5117840	5120800	milkshake all right let's take it let's
5120800	5123680	take a trip back down memory lane to a
5123680	5125560	time when the neo geo was you know more
5125560	5127240	relevant although I do I don't you did
5127240	5128840	not pick a neo geo game tonight did you
5128840	5131360	I did not oh well that's okay we're
5131360	5133560	gonna go down the archives of classic
5133560	5135080	gaming and dark soccer is going to jump
5135080	5136680	into the vault and find a game that she
5136680	5138880	thinks hey even though you might not be
5138880	5141040	able to find it you kids should play
5141040	5143560	this game right now dark soccer oh what
5143560	5145440	is the classic game of the week
5145440	5148360	troubleshooter anyone remember this
5148360	5155160	game no it came out on the Sega Genesis
5155160	5160520	it has awesome music play a little bit
5160520	5163680	you
5163680	5166680	assassination
5168920	5171680	anyway in Japan it was known as battle
5171680	5173560	mania and it's a scrolling shooter by
5173560	5178440	Victor hi that came out in 1992 and the
5178440	5180920	only reason I really I had I can say I
5180920	5182680	played this game is I had a friend who
5182680	5185240	had a copy so just we'll leave that there
5185240	5187840	because I didn't have a genesis when I
5187840	5192240	was in high school and the game is a real
5192240	5194440	basically just makes fun of itself the
5194440	5196600	whole time you play as a girl named
5196600	5198960	Madison who is a combat operative who
5198960	5200720	has to rescue a prince that has been
5200720	5203120	taken hostage and she goes around with
5203120	5208520	her partner crystal now basically you
5208520	5210760	play as Madison and Chris was kind of
5210760	5213560	attached to her but it's really way I
5213560	5216640	can describe their positioning and
5216640	5219400	crystal always points backwards but you
5219400	5222720	can flip her to point in the front and
5222720	5225120	she's invulnerable to enemy fire the
5225120	5228360	only one who has the hitbox is Madison
5228360	5231960	here playing as and crystal is only if
5231960	5235360	affected if Madison dies so basically
5235360	5237120	you have a special weapon that helps you
5237120	5239640	during combat and like I said you can
5239640	5241800	flip back and forth we can flip your
5241800	5243320	partner back and forth that you are
5243320	5247680	always facing to the right and you've
5247680	5249240	got different power-ups and it's funny
5249240	5252200	when when you get a power-up she goes
5252200	5255680	thank you like that and they make a
5255680	5256840	little noises when they get hurt and
5256840	5258680	everything a little bubble comes up this
5258680	5261920	is ouch it's so cute but it didn't
5261920	5264680	really have like a life system you
5264680	5266840	stocked at hit points by getting life up
5266840	5271520	icons and now it often had a sequel in
5271520	5275000	Japan called battle mania a diagonal now
5275000	5276920	we're going to move forward into what
5276920	5278800	makes this game special and I'm talking
5278800	5284000	more about battle mania is that it's
5284000	5289200	kind of slow-paced it has this sort of
5289200	5291120	like I said the weird play you know
5291120	5295040	playing style in it but basically Owen
5295040	5296400	in Japan they were called mania and
5296400	5300280	Maria sorry they basically go down and
5300280	5304880	shoot weird machines and it had some
5304880	5311480	really fun stuff thrown in like they had
5311480	5314880	an issue in the game now this was
5314880	5319280	because the group they were working with
5319280	5322520	which which was a studio Uchuu Tetsujin
5322520	5324920	which is also called studio space iron
5324920	5327960	man did not like that Victor Kai worked
5327960	5330560	with Super Famicom so they had an
5330560	5332520	interesting little easter egg through
5332520	5336120	into the game where if you press start
5336120	5338120	right and see on the second controller
5338120	5341000	the two heroines in the game will shoot
5341000	5343200	past the Sega logo and you will see
5343200	5345160	Madison jumping up and down on the Super
5345160	5349640	Famicom just bounce bounce bounce bounce
5349640	5356480	when the U.S. does what Nintendo yeah it's
5356480	5361680	not in the English version so uh so
5361680	5366640	basically as things went along this was
5366640	5368120	you know going into the sequel the
5368120	5372880	battle mania die angel it had mushrooms
5372880	5378920	come out that were part of the power-ups
5378920	5383760	and it had a fleet of well guys it looked
5383760	5386440	like Cape Mario that you had to shoot
5386440	5393080	down there was also just a bunch of
5393080	5394560	stuff that was going on with this it was
5394560	5398160	and there's a an official picture that
5398160	5402840	came out where it shows the girls
5402840	5407880	playing volleyball with a super with a
5407880	5412200	Super Famicom and a hammer and then in
5412200	5415200	the game say gaga you remember that one
5415200	5417200	right we have to basically you're trying
5417200	5420840	to save Sega from financial ruin well
5420840	5422320	they get helped in the end of the game
5422320	5423640	by a bunch of characters from their
5423640	5428760	games and outcome the two ladies from
5428760	5433040	battle mania so definitely the game
5433040	5436480	itself is definitely a big poop on
5436480	5439720	Nintendo but also it's just really fun I
5439720	5442560	mean it's a fun little shooter so this
5442560	5444160	is a game that I would love to have a
5444160	5446600	copy of either the u.s. one of the
5446600	5450960	Japanese one so I would just be giddy if
5450960	5454640	I had this game unfortunately I haven't
5454640	5457800	seen it since I was in high school

5847300	5848600	during the break there that was great
5848600	5852700	again that was the corruption from the

5854940	5856240	that was really cool hope you guys like
5856240	5858000	that too I liked it yeah it's nice and
5858000	5860560	some folks in chat there dungeon buster
5860560	5863160	says at live.vognetwork.com says I
5863160	5864600	thought Kidd did a great job in the
5864600	5866680	Darksiders to stuff there's a base theme
5866680	5868560	in this that runs in this one that runs
5868560	5870800	into other pieces so there you go so
5870800	5873160	alright we're going to get back into the
5873160	5875800	show with some rapid-fire news some
5875800	5878200	quick news stories here and we'll start
5878200	5881840	it off with Loki alright so the Vita is
5881840	5885280	getting some new firmware soon version
5885280	5888400	1.8 and this is kind of cool because one
5888400	5890600	of the complaints about the Vita before
5890600	5893520	were with the visually impaired having
5893520	5895960	trouble accessing stuff on the Vita
5895960	5898120	because there was no button controls on
5898120	5899600	the home screen well that's going to
5899600	5902020	change now that there will be button
5902020	5903640	controls on the home screen ability use
5903640	5905200	the directional pad and stuff to
5905200	5909520	navigate those screens and no longer we
5909520	5911640	have to use just the touchpad and then
5911640	5914280	also they're going to add I guess some
5914280	5916960	different options for video including
5916960	5920000	fast rewind fast forward and variable
5920000	5924400	speeds also you can import playlists
5924400	5926760	from PlayStation 3 or iTunes for playing
5926760	5929520	music and the web browser now supports
5929520	5931200	rear touch for scrolling and zooming
5931200	5936120	also I guess there's going to be a new
5936120	5939520	cross controller icon in the remote play
5939520	5942320	for the cross controller supporting
5942320	5948200	games and then other tweaks I'm sure so
5948200	5950080	that's pretty cool and then black ops
5950080	5952200	2 some more details came out during
5952200	5954280	gamescom which actually makes me pretty
5954280	5957320	excited about first things first they're
5957320	5960440	going to be adding some new customization
5960440	5962960	options as opposed to the way they've
5962960	5965120	kind of done things for the last god I
5965120	5966600	don't even know how many games as far as
5966600	5968360	custom classes go you basically get you
5968360	5970720	know primary weapon secondary weapon you
5970720	5973440	know your three perks and you know a
5973440	5975840	lethal grenade and support grenade and
5975840	5979680	stuff like that killstreaks now it's
5979680	5981760	going to basically be you get ten points
5981760	5983320	you get to spend those ten points
5983320	5985200	however you want so if you want to go in
5985200	5987800	and say fuck it I want to run into with
5987800	5989800	just a knife you can do that you can
5989800	5992040	have like five perks or hey I want to
5992040	5995240	have you know a ton of ammo and you know
5995240	5997120	no perks or I want to have this and that
5997120	5999000	you can change it however you want that's
5999000	6000480	kind of cool so that's something that
6000480	6002680	they're adding in there also league play
6002680	6005720	is going to be added in as well as the
6005720	6009720	option to do live streams of your
6009720	6011120	gameplay so you can have live streams
6011120	6014200	and you can also do shoutcasts of like
6014200	6016280	commentary so you can have commentary
6016280	6017680	going over the whole thing as well that's
6017680	6019440	built into the goddamn game that's
6019440	6021640	interesting yes some people harnessing
6021640	6023080	the types of things we see on like you
6023080	6024480	stream and twitch TV and all that
6024480	6026840	interesting yes so that's pretty cool and
6026840	6029280	then there's also a rumor that black ops
6029280	6031760	twos heading to the Wii U according to a
6031760	6036720	QA testers resume who was on LinkedIn I'm
6036720	6038000	just going to make it easy for you it's
6038000	6039320	not a fucking rumor it's coming on the
6039320	6041200	wheel I mean I've been seeing it for
6041200	6043560	weeks now so it is coming on the wheel I
6043560	6047960	know because I've seen the UPC and other
6047960	6051040	things but yes it duh I mean come on it's
6051040	6052600	gonna be a simple port of the other
6052600	6055160	games and you know Treyarch supports the
6055160	6057880	Wii so why not come out well speaking of
6057880	6060160	the Wii U spot pass is apparently going
6060160	6061840	to be a feature of the Wii U this again
6061840	6064360	really strikes me as a type of duh but
6064360	6065600	it is going around the internet this
6065600	6067200	week that I guess it's kind of the new
6067200	6069480	version of Wii Connect 24 which you know
6069480	6071520	remember that was a thing that your Wii
6071520	6073120	was always on but it's not really it's
6073120	6075560	not used as well as it could be spot
6075560	6077760	pass a little better on the DS so
6077760	6079200	hopefully they're gonna implement that
6079200	6080360	more and more through the Nintendo
6080360	6082680	platforms this is all coming from a
6082680	6084960	photo of a Wii U development kit that
6084960	6086280	the Wii U will have the spot pass
6086280	6088680	feature I mean come on of course and it
6088680	6091200	if they're smart they'll do a lot of the
6091200	6093520	stuff between the 3ds and the Wii U that
6093520	6095100	was happening between the DS and the Wii
6095100	6096520	with the demos and so of course they're
6096520	6098560	gonna have spot pass I mean it is a it
6098560	6103520	is a DS right now on the TV screen
6103520	6106280	essentially alright well other Nintendo
6106280	6108200	news Team Ninja I remember they made
6108200	6110720	Metroid other M which you know was kind
6110720	6112520	of met with mixed mixed reaction not
6112520	6113880	everybody was into it I thought it was
6113880	6115600	pretty I thought it was pretty good but
6115600	6117720	you know not nothing is yet to top Super
6117720	6119240	Metroid for me you know nothing's even
6119240	6120840	really come close honestly what about a
6120840	6125420	fusion um close but still doesn't top it
6125420	6127560	the closest thing I would say would be
6127560	6130240	the Metroid zero zero mission was
6130240	6131160	probably the close that's what I'm
6131160	6132040	thinking of how's on the Game Boy
6132040	6134880	Advance you were thinking of the other
6134880	6136920	Game Boy Advance one was Metroid fusion
6136920	6141120	ah anyway team ninjas yosuke hayashi
6141120	6143200	says that they are still close to
6143200	6144840	Nintendo and the designer Yoshio
6144840	6147000	Sakamoto apparently they are both
6147000	6148880	director they were both directors of
6148880	6151400	Metroid other M on the Wii and according
6151400	6154100	to Hayashi team ninja wants to work with
6154100	6156520	Nintendo on another Metroid title here's
6156520	6158920	a quote unfortunately Metroid is kind of
6158920	6161560	out of our meaning team ninjas league as
6161560	6163360	it's Nintendo's game but we're still in
6163360	6164920	close touch with so co-creator
6164920	6166840	Sakamoto-san so we want to do something
6166840	6168680	with him moving forward definitely it
6168680	6170200	really depends on what he wants to do
6170200	6172440	with the game first so you know kind of
6172440	6174800	like a peace offering there I mean but
6174800	6176520	again at the end of the day if Metroid
6176520	6177840	other M didn't sell which I don't
6177840	6179720	believe it did sell up to expectations I
6179720	6181560	don't know what the future is going to
6181560	6183400	hold for Metroid but I can't they
6183400	6184720	totally screwed up with Samus in that
6184720	6186720	game I I wouldn't believe though that
6186720	6188320	they would just let Metroid go away but
6188320	6189760	then again stranger things have happened
6189760	6193880	I hope not I hope not the full track
6193880	6196840	list for just dance for coming out on
6196840	6199920	October 9th on the Wii connect and
6199920	6202760	PlayStation move the full track listing

6205320	6208600	of the highlights mm-hmm last ketchup

6661160	6665840	rapid-fire news dark Sakura well um
6665840	6668760	we've got a fan project that's called
6668760	6672400	Megaman day in the limelight to sorry
6672400	6674640	there's apparently a sequel it's done by
6674640	6676000	the people that did mushroom kingdom
6676000	6677920	fusion it's a rearranged version of
6677920	6681960	Megaman 3 but instead of playing what
6681960	6684760	tiger class as searching for car alarm
6684760	6714680	dubstep I found this okay so anyway
6714680	6716560	you play through on the stages of Megaman
6716560	6718640	3 but you play as the robot masters for
6718640	6721920	Megaman 2 so it looks like it's pretty
6721920	6723440	fun and I think I'm going to be grabbing
6723440	6730280	this no thank you let's not fuck Rob the

6904240	6907680	mushroom Matt J says I always love the
6907680	6910040	grappling hook from Super Metroid and
6910040	6912520	later in Metroid Prime I felt like a
6912520	6914640	total badass swinging back and forth on
6914640	6917360	those hooks the space jump comes in as a
6917360	6919200	close second though mostly because the

7032920	7035560	has been my recent favorite the collector

7052320	7056080	you'll never use anything else there was
7056080	7061080	oh in the issue of Fornax um as far as
7061080	7064640	others that I really really like I like
7064640	7069040	the bells in Proteus that I like the
7069040	7071720	word blaster where I have no idea what
7071720	7073280	it's saying I can only read like some of
7073280	7075240	it but it's like I don't know what you're
7075240	7077840	saying but die I love I love the
7077840	7084160	Proteus power-ups a whole bunch and oh
7084160	7087160	yeah cotton where she gets the willow
7087160	7090160	she goes we know just I just like it
7090160	7093880	because that's all she says so Loki um
7093880	7097120	well there's a few I have some actually
7097120	7098680	from games I haven't played a couple
7098680	7100880	from red faction they had mr. toots which
7100880	7103560	was a unicorn that fired rainbows out of
7103560	7106200	its ass that amazing it was a weapon in
7106200	7108720	the game oh there was that showed up in
7108720	7111320	like videos online too right yeah they
7111320	7113160	did a viral video Freddie Wong I remember
7113160	7114240	you covering that yeah I was a Freddie
7114240	7116640	Wong thing yeah anyways then the ostrich
7116640	7119920	hammer from red faction also and then
7119920	7123000	for stuff that I actually have played
7123000	7126920	fuzzy from you know Super Mario World 2
7126920	7129280	that wasn't really a power-up but that's
7129280	7131160	actually a good answer I like that
7131160	7134720	memorable and then actually a sort of a
7134720	7139000	power-up from it was actually in a bunch
7139000	7141120	of Capcom games but like one I remember
7141120	7142880	is Captain Commando where you would hop
7142880	7145360	into like the mechs and like you know
7145360	7147600	punch and blow things up and catch
7147600	7150080	things on fire remember how all the old
7150080	7152320	Capcom games had that little symbol that
7152320	7153640	like showed up in every game that was
7153640	7155160	always like an uber power-up like it was
7155160	7156480	in every game I can't remember what was
7156480	7158200	called you remember that little symbol
7158200	7162640	like a little mm-hmm somebody I do
7162640	7164440	also they'll have to second the purple
7164440	7166000	laser and riding because it's always
7166000	7168280	what I use was a purple laser anything
7168280	7170480	else lucky that's it oh there's one more
7170480	7174240	I can add huh actually your your shield
7174240	7179000	thing in our type the added on option
7179000	7180200	that you could shoot either from your
7180200	7182760	butt or from the front that was always a
7182760	7185840	cool thing I'm gonna go super duper old
7185840	7187680	school I think one of the best power-ups
7187680	7189520	ever was the hammer in Donkey Kong
7189520	7193600	because the little song the little
7193600	7195040	animation of the hammer going up and
7195040	7197040	down was really funny to me so I always
7197040	7198400	love the hammer in the original Donkey
7198400	7201280	Kong and then the power brick in Mario
7201280	7203800	Brothers because I love I'm not talking
7203800	7205000	Super Mario Brothers but an old-school
7205000	7206720	Mario Brothers I loved that game I still
7206720	7209080	do it's one of my favorite like everyone
7209080	7211040	that's one of it yeah you just knock
7211040	7212680	everyone on their ass and it was it is
7212680	7214120	cool to the power bricks kind of come
7214120	7215720	back in the later Mario would be awesome
7215720	7217800	hmm is you know how we have Smash
7217800	7219680	Brothers guess Smash Brothers of old
7219680	7222280	retro arcade games like all that would
7222280	7223840	be those characters that would be very
7223840	7227400	cool I slightly old-school but like the
7227400	7228600	first thing that came to my mind
7228600	7232000	honestly the ripple gun from life force
7232000	7235000	yes that was the best one I love that
7235000	7236600	power-up like sometimes I even though
7236600	7238000	it wasn't that great of a gun like I
7238000	7239680	would get it just cuz it's cool I'm team
7239680	7241720	laser over here and exactly the laser
7241720	7243640	was the the more effective power-up at
7243640	7245880	the ripple was just cool and I really
7245880	7248440	think the best power-up like ever were
7248440	7250520	the options in the Gradius games in any
7250520	7252840	of those option yeah those are great
7252840	7254560	power-ups you have too much speed up
7254560	7256800	though and you'd be dead right um you
7256800	7258520	know well another one actually since I
7258520	7261080	mentioned our type is the I don't know
7261080	7262280	if it's called the ripple gun in our
7262280	7264480	type but it's like a dual red and blue
7264480	7267400	that forms this big swirl as it goes
7267400	7268920	across you've got or something yeah some
7268920	7270160	kind of wave gun but that's just thought
7270160	7272160	that one was pretty triggers in our
7272160	7273920	chat room says a street can I don't know
7273920	7275240	if that was the name of it that thing
7275240	7278240	I'm trying to think of where that's a
7278240	7280120	capcom thing that was in the like it
7280120	7282360	was in 1942 and it was in bionic commando
7282360	7286480	and which um one other one I would name
7286480	7288680	power-up that was awesome you know I'm
7288680	7290560	gonna go to Super Metroid right I'm
7290560	7292480	gonna say the very end of the game when
7292480	7294240	you have that laser that just blows
7294240	7295600	through everything like the rainbow
7295600	7296880	laser that just cuts through everything
7296880	7298440	there was just something really epic

7350200	7352800	pretty cool yeah even even in general
7352800	7356160	the hadoken kind of changed gaming in a
7356160	7357280	way like I don't know if you'd call that
7357280	7360040	a power-up so much as a power move but
7360040	7362280	think about it reuse fireball in
7362280	7365000	Street Fighter kind of changed gaming in
7365000	7367200	many ways I think it did I don't can I
7367200	7369480	don't can you really did I don't as it
7369480	7371040	in a games annoy me is it but that's all
7371040	7374640	you hear all game all right anyhow
7374640	7376040	that's it for frugal question of the
7376040	7378320	week let's move on with some more news
7378320	7380400	we'll get to the mailbag if use Twitter
7380400	7382160	topic Skype all that good stuff in just
7382160	7384840	a little bit but first Loki man valve is
7384840	7387560	getting into all sorts of crazy shit you
7387560	7388760	know first they're you know they have
7388760	7390480	their game service and then now they're
7390480	7392680	you know putting other software now
7392680	7397600	they're making documentaries yes valve
7397600	7400880	has documentaries that are coming out
7400880	7403400	now and the first one is based on an
7403400	7406520	upcoming defense of the agents or
7406520	7408840	ancients agents that'd be a whole
7408840	7412280	another game defense of the ancients
7412280	7415400	documentary and they're I guess
7415400	7417200	following people are trying to go pro
7417200	7418680	and win a million dollars in a
7418680	7420800	tournament it makes sense things are
7420800	7422320	going this way when that whole indie
7422320	7424360	game the movie did I'm assuming it did
7424360	7426280	fairly well on steam I saw people
7426280	7427920	talking about it and I would imagine
7427920	7430080	they did sort of have a documentary in
7430080	7434400	iPad form with the portal to the final
7434400	7436240	days oh yeah did it wasn't wasn't that
7436240	7438000	like a contracted thing though where
7438000	7440160	yeah because like Jeff Keeley put that
7440160	7441800	all together at least supervised it I'm
7441800	7443600	sure he didn't do it all himself but you
7443600	7445800	know supervised that whole thing where
7445800	7447240	yeah because they did they did the
7447240	7449200	portal but wasn't there one that was the
7449200	7452040	last days of all there was another game
7452040	7455400	that had one was it another valve game
7455400	7456800	actually didn't they do one for Mass
7456800	7459720	Effect 3 they did they did do last days
7459720	7461440	of Mass Effect 3 and last days of portal
7461440	7462760	and I there was one other I don't care I
7462760	7464440	just want to see an animated team
7464440	7466520	fortress 2 movie that would be fucking
7466520	7468880	amazing fans can make them now well I
7468880	7471280	didn't market them through steam it'd be
7471280	7474360	crazy I still want to see if let's see a
7474360	7476160	future-length animated movie because
7476160	7478120	their shit is pretty awesome well there
7478120	7480920	you got record Ralph coming I doubt team
7480920	7483440	fortress characters are in it but they
7483440	7487760	should be why not all right moving on to
7487760	7489440	Nintendo I reference this a little bit
7489440	7491560	earlier in the show but I wanted to go
7491560	7492720	into depth on this a little bit because
7492720	7494120	I'm sure Loki will have an opinion on
7494120	7496520	this Nintendo is promising that their
7496520	7499680	DLC will not leave users feel cheated
7499680	7502560	or deceived this is a crew according to
7502560	7504360	Satoru Iwata of course is Nintendo
7504360	7506040	present the president of Nintendo
7506040	7507600	because you know Nintendo is just now
7507600	7512120	getting into DLC what it's 2012 and DLC
7512120	7513600	has been prevalent since what about oh
7513600	7515280	six oh seven when well they're just now
7515280	7518160	getting an HD to some mean Nintendo is
7518160	7521320	finally getting into DLC and here's what
7521320	7523640	they said and one thing into excuse me
7523640	7525440	what he said and one thing Nintendo is
7525440	7527640	determined as a company policy what we
7527640	7529360	are not going to do is create a full
7529360	7531200	game and then say let's hold this back
7531200	7534160	for DLC that's not our plan we're
7534160	7535920	definitely not doing that it's an
7535920	7537600	extreme example but I think there are
7537600	7539240	examples of games where you get that
7539240	7541600	initial purchase the very core part of
7541600	7543440	the game and everything else around it
7543440	7545120	is all DLC that's all a matter of
7545120	7546920	opinion that's some subtle Capcom
7546920	7549120	shading that that's all that well that
7549120	7550760	is but that's also a matter of opinion
7550760	7552280	because Capcom I'm sure in their defense
7552280	7554420	would say that Street Fighter cross
7554420	7556040	Tekken was a full game and that these
7556040	7558160	additional characters are you know that
7558160	7559800	just that they're additional but the
7559800	7561200	rest of the internet called them out on
7561200	7563160	that bullshit yeah it's on it's on disk
7563160	7565320	it's paid unlock content and there's
7565320	7566880	even like there's one story I didn't
7566880	7569160	talk about it was sleeping dogs how they
7569160	7570600	oh yeah we have six months planned of
7570600	7573080	DLC it's all paid unlock stuff but to be
7573080	7575640	fair that is a game where you don't
7575640	7577160	really need that stuff it's just
7577160	7579320	costumes and I don't think there's any
7579320	7581280	additional missions or maybe but it's
7581280	7583200	mostly costumes one quick other
7583200	7585000	statement here so our goal is to create
7585000	7587040	DLC in such a way the consumers do not
7587040	7588720	feel they have been cheated or deceived
7588720	7590400	now I believe there are people out there
7590400	7593400	readers who have are worried about that
7593400	7594880	I think it's a weird translation there
7594880	7596640	and we just want to ensure them that we
7596640	7598640	have in mind and want them to know that
7598640	7601280	that's not what we are planning on doing
7601280	7604080	so Nintendo planning and doing are two
7604080	7607400	different things we're not sorry I'm
7607400	7611440	doing it but you know it well you know
7611440	7613200	it's not just a water that said this
7613200	7614960	because I remember distinctly in that
7614960	7616920	3ds little press conference thing not
7616920	7618320	the one for me three but the one that
7618320	7619680	came out a little later where they
7619680	7621120	spotlighted the games again it was like
7621120	7622560	a one of those Nintendo Direct things
7622560	7623880	that had Reggie and some of those guys
7623880	7627320	from Nintendo in it he specifically said
7627320	7630320	we're gonna have DLC for New Super Mario
7630320	7631520	Brothers 2 but I want to assure
7631520	7634960	everybody it's additional content we
7634960	7636800	have a finished game first I mean they
7636800	7638200	they really went out of their way to
7638200	7641840	stress it's not something like that
7641840	7643520	you're gonna have to have it is truly
7643520	7645200	something extra the designers are
7645200	7649760	working on we'll see what do you think
7649760	7652360	Nintendo DLC I don't really know what
7652360	7653560	the thing yeah cuz we haven't seen any
7653560	7656440	examples yet I just think that New Super
7656440	7657560	Mario Bros 2 is gonna be the first
7657560	7661480	example of first party DLC anyway I just
7661480	7663440	don't know if it's gonna I mean I would
7663440	7665840	be I was always hoping that like you
7665840	7668960	know excite truck you know hey all we
7668960	7670800	need is DLC with new levels that's it
7670800	7674680	just add new levels in I'll be happy of
7674680	7676080	course that never happened and then we
7676080	7678520	got a crappy sequel but you know the
7678520	7680240	Mario Kart same thing people with that
7680240	7682280	just add new level my problem with Mario
7682280	7684440	Kart and this has been the case with it
7684440	7686560	will be all old levels a lot of yes
7686560	7689280	seriously that's the thing is you've
7689280	7691280	released these old levels in every
7691280	7693320	single Mario Kart it was cool the first
7693320	7694560	time that you did it it's like hey
7694560	7696320	that's kind of neat you know this this
7696320	7699120	old Mario Kart levels in 3d now or it's
7699120	7701320	in like you know the polygons and stuff
7701320	7704200	now it's getting a little old it's it's
7704200	7707040	getting a little tiresome just maybe do
7707040	7708500	a Mario Kart game that didn't have the
7708500	7711440	old tracks in it just a thought maybe
7711440	7714080	instead of coming out with four circuits
7714080	7716480	you just don't have the retro search I
7716480	7718200	don't mind I don't mind the half half
7718200	7720120	new half returning stuff I don't mind it
7720120	7722040	but it's for me here it is it's all
7722040	7724340	about this the price is right it is all
7724340	7726760	about the cost because like what do you
7726760	7728400	think would be a fair price to charge
7728400	7731360	for let's say Nintendo were to put out
7731360	7733880	five new tracks like a new circuit of
7733880	7736120	five new tracks what would that be worth
7736120	7737920	to you as DLC what would you pay for
7737920	7739520	that depends what sir I mean if it's old
7739520	7741440	really say all new let's say it's all new
7741440	7745320	I'd say like five bucks really yeah I
7745320	7746960	wouldn't want to see it more than $2.99
7746960	7748960	maybe I'm just a few really good tracks
7748960	7750880	it just it would all depend on me you
7750880	7754480	know but or like Mario Mario 2 coin rush
7754480	7756440	levels three stages that I wouldn't buy
7756440	7758320	yeah I don't know I don't know like it's
7758320	7760640	really about the price is Nintendo gonna
7760640	7764620	get the price right I don't know we'll
7764620	7766760	see
7766760	7769080	chiggers in our chat room at live dog
7769080	7771040	network com says Mario Kart level editor
7771040	7773440	and share please but then they wouldn't
7773440	7774840	be able to charge you for DLC if they do
7774840	7777800	that they have a Mario Kart level editor
7777800	7780560	now on the Wii and there is some not
7780560	7782340	official though is it now but there's
7782340	7783840	some way you can do it with SD cards
7783840	7785280	where you can load custom tracks on
7785280	7788920	there same with the 3ds or not the 3ds
7788920	7791400	yeah was it New Super Mario Rose on the
7791400	7792700	Wii same thing with that you can do
7792700	7794700	custom levels in that somehow I should
7794700	7797120	say this though you know because some
7797120	7799240	people say well if Mario Kart added that
7799240	7800500	in then they wouldn't be able to sell
7800500	7802600	DLC not necessarily the case look at
7802600	7803860	something like little big planet does
7803860	7805600	this very well you know big planet does
7805600	7808560	great that reminds me there was a ROM
7808560	7810720	hack for New Super Mario Brothers on the
7810720	7812960	DS that was New Super Mario Bros 3 and
7812960	7814680	it had a lot of really cool levels and
7814680	7816560	stuff in it that would be kind of cool
7816560	7818040	to compare that to the New Super Mario
7818040	7823680	Brothers 2 now to see you know how you
7823680	7826720	know how better one is than the other
7826720	7828400	because I think that one had some really
7828400	7830560	unique ideas that they do with it I
7830560	7832920	don't know if we're gonna see that in a
7832920	7834480	level design you know I don't know if a
7834480	7835840	lot of those people are thinking that
7835840	7838160	far outside the box like some of the ROM
7838160	7841880	hackers do we shall see let's move on
7841880	7844440	for now Dark Sakura with some more news
7844440	7848580	well we do have something else from
7848580	7851920	valve well I'm sure you're familiar with
7851920	7854160	the perpetual testing initiative that
7854160	7856800	was the in-game portal to editor I play
7856800	7858000	a few other things someone's actually
7858000	7860720	even gone and tried to recreate the
7860720	7863360	entire first portal using nothing but at
7863360	7865160	least the puzzles and everything using
7865160	7868560	nothing but the in-game editor well now
7868560	7870880	they have a patch that's going to be an
7870880	7874320	update for that to let you do co-op that
7874320	7877240	the co-op test chambers and you also
7877240	7879400	have another option that's a quick play
7879400	7881520	feature so that you can see the top
7881520	7885400	rated user maps for each category it's
7885400	7887640	gonna like I said free and it's also
7887640	7891440	gonna come with a 75% off portal to
7891440	7893440	vouchers that you can share the game
7893440	7897640	with friend not bad huh no it's not bad
7897640	7901880	at all I love you steam I love you so I
7901880	7904700	can get a friend portal to whether they
7904700	7907960	want it or not they want it they want it
7907960	7909640	who wouldn't want portal to it's great I
7909640	7910920	would think everybody should have it by
7910920	7913560	now with all them steam sales I know
7913560	7917640	right so this is kind of shocking during
7917640	7921440	gamescom apparently some early builds of
7921440	7924280	the game divinity were stolen out of the
7924280	7926760	booth they literally picked up pcs and
7926760	7930200	ran out of the building and somehow not
7930200	7934960	didn't get caught how does that trend
7934960	7936880	because how does that even happen we've
7936880	7938280	heard about this happening at PAX and
7938280	7941040	everything it's like I could see I could
7941040	7942560	see it like if it was for whatever
7942560	7945760	reason on like a a disc or something you
7945760	7947200	know popping the disc out point in your
7947200	7948880	pocket and run out of the well something
7948880	7949920	like that happened at the last packs
7949920	7951480	didn't it do we do we report on that or
7951480	7953440	somebody had got it on like copied it to
7953440	7955600	a USB drive or something and ran yeah I
7955600	7958400	was it was I forget what game was but
7958400	7961800	yeah I do remember that hmm but anyways
7961800	7965160	so apparently the two games divinity
7965160	7967640	dragon commander and divinity original
7967640	7971400	sin have been stolen from Larry learning
7971400	7974960	studios and they've actually posted a
7974960	7978080	reward of $5,000 for anybody that can

8037480	8039720	guy got a PC with him I mean that that
8039720	8041680	seems a little suspicious to me game
8041680	8042960	grew in our chat room with the
8042960	8045080	inappropriate joke guest appearance by
8045080	8049320	Carmen San Diego yeah yeah when whomp
8049320	8053600	whomp all right let's move on one more

8055000	8057040	this is also out of Gamescom something a
8057040	8060280	little better than stolen things a little
8060280	8062680	seminar about how to pitch your indie
8062680	8064560	game to Sony oh excuse me this is not
8064560	8066160	excuse me this is not out of Gamescom
8066160	8069360	but close it's another Europe convention
8069360	8071320	I sound like such an ignorant American
8071320	8072960	right now my apologies it's game
8072960	8074960	developers conference Europe GDC Europe
8074960	8076800	also happened last week you may or not
8076800	8079720	have heard but yeah there was a seminar
8079720	8082440	by Pete Smith who is the Sony cross dev
8082440	8084880	director of product development talking
8084880	8087240	about basically what you should and you
8087240	8090000	shouldn't do when you pitch your indie
8090000	8092920	game he said quote I'm sick of sitting
8092920	8096240	through crap development pitches hmm
8096240	8100200	dark soccer let's play a game word let's
8100200	8101920	see if you can guess what would be some
8101920	8103760	of the do's and some of the don'ts if
8103760	8106280	you're gonna pitch your indie game what
8106280	8107640	are some of the do's and some of the
8107640	8111160	don'ts what would be your guess Loki if
8111160	8112320	you haven't spoiled this for yourself
8112320	8115000	already you can play too well no cheating
8115000	8117240	what to do when you're pitching it and
8117240	8118920	what not to do yeah what would you do to
8118920	8120480	pitch it and what what's what makes a
8120480	8121600	good pitch and what doesn't make a good
8121600	8123960	pitch well with a good pitch you want to
8123960	8125400	definitely have some presentation
8125400	8128360	materials like concept art something
8128360	8130560	that's gonna be solid you want to have
8130560	8132880	something well written out spelled
8132880	8137080	correctly ding ding ding we have have
8137080	8139640	assets this these include a one-page
8139640	8141640	overview screenshots or video all on a
8141640	8143240	USB stick for the publisher to keep
8143240	8145840	don't waste time or money on swag good
8145840	8150560	yeah I mean it's nice to have something
8150560	8152160	kind of neat to throw in it but no one's
8152160	8154040	gonna invest any money if they don't
8154040	8157320	have at least an appetizer instead of
8157320	8158680	the meat and potatoes you know they need
8158680	8162000	to see what the vision is need to have a
8162000	8164880	projection need to see you know have a
8164880	8166680	financial comparison to see if there's
8166680	8168840	other games of a similar genre what
8168840	8170520	they're making money with and how this
8170520	8172040	is going to compare to them you know
8172040	8174920	financial presentation what not to do is
8174920	8176280	just say oh I've got an idea for a game
8176280	8180600	we give me money not to harass them with
8180600	8183480	phone calls you send the first email you
8183480	8185520	send them the test product you send a
8185520	8189040	follow-up you wait for a response you
8189040	8190360	know those aren't neither one that's not
8190360	8192200	really on the list per se but I still
8192200	8193640	think that's good advice I don't think
8193640	8196600	that's necessarily wrong similar answers
8196600	8198480	are there Loki did you cheat I didn't
8198480	8200640	cheat all right what would you guess a
8200640	8207000	pitch features tits and ass I you know
8207000	8209040	what I will give that credit because on
8209040	8212960	the do not list is be boring so certainly
8212960	8215720	that is the opposite of boring be boring
8215720	8219600	is on the do not list I don't think that
8219600	8222520	they want it try to stay away from like
8222520	8225360	graphs and charts maybe I'll make more
8225360	8228240	just quick summaries of like here's
8228240	8230800	here's my story here's you know the
8230800	8232960	concept that type of thing again the
8232960	8235440	opposite is true so D need that on the
8235440	8237360	do list keep your visuals simple and
8237360	8241040	bold basically so yeah so any house on
8241040	8244280	the do list know what your game is be
8244280	8246920	able to pitch it in 30 seconds yeah keep
8246920	8248720	your visuals simple and bold you don't
8248720	8250480	have to you want it you want to show off
8250480	8253080	gameplay not graphics exactly you want
8253080	8257440	to be succinct research focus don't ask
8257440	8262280	them what a Vita is really if you're
8262280	8264040	gonna pitch to Sony don't ask them what
8264040	8266520	a Vita is really really I have something
8266520	8271240	for your Vita system I have a vital game
8271240	8273320	for the Vita well actually there's
8273320	8274680	something else that occurred to me and I
8274680	8276920	didn't look look at your screen that's
8276920	8279240	haven't seen anything sure you want to
8279240	8281160	make sure that the person making the
8281160	8283280	pitch knows how to speak in front of
8283280	8287600	people and then enunciate mm-hmm and has
8287600	8290400	presence practice your pitch and choose
8290400	8293560	the right person yeah or both there for
8293560	8295440	real huh practice your pitch and choose
8295440	8297360	the right person for the pitch someone
8297360	8299000	who can talk about the game to a room of
8299000	8301640	suits with ease exactly and who the
8301640	8303120	average person does not know corporate
8303120	8305360	speak sorry let's see also on the list
8305360	8308240	here be able to adapt because some games
8308240	8310760	often don't end up what their pitch
8310760	8314040	manage your expectations Sony isn't
8314040	8315680	gonna back a game unless it benefits them
8315680	8317720	as well as you so be prepared to
8317720	8320080	negotiate that IP I think that's a very
8320080	8322760	realistic answer there let's see I think
8322760	8323880	we hit on some of these other sell
8323880	8325840	yourself as a company and as individuals
8325840	8327280	I think that's very interesting because
8327280	8329400	they say that you have to be able to
8329400	8332280	work with the people not just the idea
8332280	8335480	very interesting they say media molecule
8335480	8337480	was a great example of this Sony wanted
8337480	8339360	to work with the people they followed
8339360	8340800	through media molecule probably brought
8340800	8342360	us one of the greatest Sony games ever
8342360	8346320	period little big planet show passion if
8346320	8351400	you don't care why will they hi I'm Ben
8351400	8353880	Stein and here's my game all right
8353880	8355240	lastly on the do not list then we'll
8355240	8358320	move on don't be boring don't bitch and
8358320	8360120	whine about other developers or
8360120	8362200	publishers I think that's great advice
8362200	8363920	don't burn your bridges and they just
8363920	8367040	say it's a small industry very true
8367040	8369320	don't spend the entire time on your
8369320	8371000	pitch because you want room for Q&A
8371000	8377760	don't bullshit I you know there's
8377760	8379680	already a million bullshit terms that
8379680	8381200	though the people have used to fool the
8381200	8384200	public like remember blast processing
8384200	8386440	yeah that's true yeah you know what all
8386440	8388600	that was that was the only thing the
8388600	8390040	Genesis did better than the Super
8390040	8394760	Nintendo just saying you know or like
8394760	8396440	look at these graphics blah blah blah no
8396440	8399440	substance you know that's bullshitting
8399440	8400520	right there you just show them pretty
8400520	8404160	like what was heavenly sword Jane enemy
8404160	8407720	crabs know it also has blast processing
8407720	8414720	hmm Chipotle all right here's the big
8414720	8416760	ones from the do not list these are
8416760	8419400	actually on the list and I Jamie you're
8419400	8421120	just gonna go like really they have to
8421120	8425840	tell people this really first Dave do do
8425840	8428160	not tell the publisher how to do their
8428160	8430760	job don't tell Sony why they're a bad
8430760	8438360	publisher don't be late yeah and don't
8438360	8440000	you ready for the last shut up tiger
8440000	8442240	claw mode 7 was awesome what you ready
8442240	8445480	for the last one don't be hungover
8445480	8450600	really there don't be hungover because a
8450600	8452480	lot of pitches are done at these types
8452480	8455820	of e3 GDC big events right after a big
8455820	8459160	parties don't come drunk the next day
8459160	8465200	really yep really food for thought they
8465200	8467560	suggest that you know you have the rest
8467560	8469080	of your life to drink so that if you
8469080	8471060	have a presentation the next day maybe
8471060	8472560	you just shouldn't party the night
8472560	8474480	before and not everyone has my mutant
8474480	8477080	power to never have a hangover just
8477080	8481960	saying a dungeon buster says wow those
8481960	8485360	had to be on a list I know right tiger
8485360	8487240	claw says by the way someone should

8620320	8623320	write would of should of its would have
8623320	8625400	out would have should have would have
8625400	8630600	the V actually is from half saying hi
8630600	8633240	okay hey all our people this is honey
8633240	8634720	but I knew honey badger was gonna email
8634720	8637080	cuz honey badger told me an email aka
8637080	8640080	blade 3 aka Sam call me whatever either
8640080	8641640	way I just wanted to tell a little story
8641640	8645000	about a funny experience with EA EA has
8645000	8647120	been distinguished as being the world's
8647120	8649280	shittiest company about two copies of
8649280	8651680	the same game via origin basically a
8651680	8653240	friend and I were looking for a way to
8653240	8655520	play mercenaries two together because it
8655520	8658520	was a cheap sale for it so I bought it
8658520	8660280	with my origin account for me and then
8660280	8663800	for him but wait origin does not have
8663800	8665600	the feature to let you gift a copy of a
8665600	8667520	game so I told my friend I would log in
8667520	8669540	as him and buy it for him and I did my
8669540	8671580	next move was contact EA to refund one
8671580	8673360	of the games and after all I never
8673360	8675540	access the download a game in any way
8675540	8677960	and so why would there be a problem
8677960	8680080	there so I pulled up EA live chat the
8680080	8683360	rep I spoke to knew about one sentence
8683360	8685880	of English so that was great I told the
8685880	8687920	rep I want an American customer support
8687920	8689200	number and he gave it to me of course I
8689200	8690480	had to wait till business hours to call
8690480	8692920	which I did and I told the American rep
8692920	8694600	about my problem and he gladly refunded
8694600	8696720	me no harm no foul we then had a
8696720	8698400	conversation in which he told me origin
8698400	8700400	and the entire EA digital game system is
8700400	8703120	a travesty and is complete garbage I
8703120	8704880	thought that says a lot when your own
8704880	8707360	employees tell customers that they agree
8707360	8709400	that their system is shit so that's all
8709400	8712480	I just thought I so that's all just
8712480	8713960	thought it was funny keep up the good
8713960	8717080	work Sam there's really truly only one
8717080	8725400	thing I can say about all of that what
8725400	8726880	I'm gonna say there's hostile employees
8726880	8729320	at every workplace so that's true this
8729320	8731800	company sucks I ain't working here
8731800	8735120	they're always the best because they'll
8735120	8736280	give you the most stuff because they
8736280	8739280	hate their job okay PS upon trying to
8739280	8742080	play to place Mercs 2 online we found
8742080	8743960	out EA no longer ran servers for the
8743960	8746840	game and did not release a dedicated
8746840	8749680	server for people to play overland PSS
8749680	8752240	what's even better is that the copy of
8752240	8754040	Mercs 2 I was refunded for still works
8754040	8757360	and I got my money revenge woo a winner
8757360	8760960	is you way to work this system okay
8760960	8763480	it's because you got the employee who
8763480	8766320	who checked out years ago this comes
8766320	8771040	from Sam another Sam hi Sam dark soccer
8771040	8772480	never ceases to bring up important
8772480	8773760	points why thank you because I know I'm
8773760	8776400	awesome dark soccer has me wondering if
8776400	8778120	the next PlayStation and Xbox will have
8778120	8779640	the same controllers as the current
8779640	8782080	systems or will they be redesigned what
8782080	8783840	do you all think I'll be redesigned
8783840	8785440	there there's always a some type of
8785440	8788560	redesign but think about this remember I
8788560	8790080	don't I mean I don't know the marine
8790080	8791840	controls is exactly what I was gonna say
8791840	8792840	I don't know how long Sam's been
8792840	8794560	following video game news but remember
8794560	8796280	when the PlayStation 3 was first revealed
8796280	8797960	they had that boomerang controller and
8797960	8799440	everything what's this uncomfortable
8799440	8801440	looking shit literally the internet all
8801440	8805000	in unison went lol what and so they went
8805000	8806840	back to a controller that kind of looked
8806840	8809000	like the DualShock 2 except they looked
8809000	8810920	exactly like the DualShock 2 but it had
8810920	8814200	six axis remember was the big six axis
8814200	8816120	because we can't put DualShock in it
8816120	8817720	anymore because the lawsuit although
8817720	8819200	that finally worked itself out and they
8819200	8820760	put it back in there but you don't need
8820760	8824600	rumble rumble was so last-gen and I need
8824600	8827880	rumble anybody rumble was so last-gen
8827880	8830800	Ridge Racers gonna use six axis so
8830800	8832760	here's the deal which is pile of crap
8832760	8835840	PlayStation 4 probably not gonna buck
8835840	8838200	the trend too much I mean I would think
8838200	8840200	maybe one thing they're gonna try to do
8840200	8842440	I don't I don't know why I'm just
8842440	8844320	putting my little light little tinfoil
8844320	8845880	hat I think it'll kind of look like a
8845880	8847240	ps3 controller but they're gonna try to
8847240	8849320	push that rear touch thing on those
8849320	8850600	controllers it's gonna be a little
8850600	8852800	ridiculous but that's just what I think
8852800	8854120	I can see that but I think the basic
8854120	8856760	design isn't gonna change Xbox will
8856760	8858680	change somewhat I think even the
8858680	8860400	controller the controller design changed
8860400	8863480	within that first as deep remember the
8863480	8866040	remember the first Xbox was gigantic
8866040	8867960	those gigantic Xbox controls and they
8867960	8870320	scaled them down and then the Xbox 360
8870320	8872440	controller was relatively similar enough
8872440	8875440	you know well and if now looking at
8875440	8876840	other systems I think Nintendo is gonna
8876840	8877800	have a different controller every
8877800	8879760	second time yeah I mean that that's the
8879760	8881520	one that is radically different every
8881520	8883400	time that never looked really much
8883400	8886560	difference was the well even when they
8886560	8887800	brought out the top loading nest they
8887800	8890360	had this nest style controller kind of
8890360	8892520	but there was still a basic paddle and
8892520	8895720	button layout you know now the ones that
8895720	8898880	I as far as logical redesigns have gone
8898880	8902800	as if you take the Sega systems gone for
8902800	8904200	the master system gone to the Genesis
8904200	8905360	gone to the six button Genesis
8905360	8907120	controller to the Saturn that had a
8907120	8910080	similar controller to the Genesis to the
8910080	8912080	dual analog controller which I was I
8912080	8914000	will stand on this to this day best
8914000	8916640	controller ever then the Dreamcast
8916640	8921320	carry the similar style to the the I
8921320	8923280	just said it the dual analog controller
8923280	8926040	because it made sense it was comfortable
8926040	8928040	it looks hard but it's super comfortable
8928040	8930320	10 to 64 what the fuck was Nintendo
8930320	8934520	thinking but I mean I think that using
8934520	8938040	the those examples I think that the
8938040	8941200	company's the the powers that be except
8941200	8943320	for Nintendo have learned their lesson
8943320	8946360	for making too many variables in you
8946360	8948640	know when it comes to controller
8948640	8950720	progression and are sticking with the
8950720	8954440	tried-and-true shape this I mean I may
8954440	8956760	not be the biggest Sony fan but I have
8956760	8958840	to say that the controller has always
8958840	8961120	had an ergonomically comfortable shape
8961120	8964520	I do find it easier to hold it than I do
8964520	8967360	an Xbox controller even though I tend to
8967360	8970400	like games better on Xbox the PlayStation
8970400	8971600	controller is easier to hold I think
8971600	8973560	they'll stick with it one thing to keep
8973560	8974920	in mind to free move on to the next
8974920	8978240	email is that keep in mind the next Xbox
8978240	8980560	is going to be very heavy on this whole
8980560	8982600	whatever the new Kinect is whatever this
8982600	8985040	advanced Kinect is Microsoft wants
8985040	8986920	Kinect to happen I mean I guess Kinect
8986920	8988280	already has happened but they want it to
8988280	8990120	be more than a fad they're gonna shove
8990120	8991920	this thing down your throat in the next
8991920	8995120	Xbox so even though yes there will be a
8995120	8996800	tangible controller there has to be for
8996800	8999080	the halo games expect that Microsoft
8999080	9000560	will make a big deal out of the whole
9000560	9003320	hands free now you can control it with
9003320	9005440	your fingers because it's so precise you
9005440	9007080	can just use your little finger better
9007080	9009080	be things you're gonna use little fingers
9009080	9011320	to point at things that's awesome expect
9011320	9013160	that play the controller as much as I
9013160	9017440	want to like that concept I think that
9017440	9020880	you're dealing with to the the bulk of
9020880	9024640	gamers at least that have the money to
9024640	9026600	afford any of this are going to be in our
9026600	9028640	age group people who have grown up with
9028640	9030240	a controller in their hand and they've
9030240	9031920	tried this before with like remember the
9031920	9035320	u-force oh that was crap or the
9035320	9037760	activator they've tried hands-free
9037760	9039880	controllers before and true the
9039880	9041520	technology wasn't what it is today I
9041520	9043840	mean definitely Kinect is I'd have to
9043840	9045840	say up at the best of it but the very
9045840	9047680	least with Nintendo and with the move
9047680	9049840	you've still got something tangible that
9049840	9051520	you can hold people like that tactile
9051520	9054880	experience and you remember that thing
9054880	9057120	that they were making for so you could
9057120	9058680	feel the textures of things and games
9058680	9060880	yeah how it was that thing was kind of
9060880	9062760	cool the haptic stuff yeah that was
9062760	9064840	pretty cool but I mean everybody said
9064840	9068320	it was going to be in the next iPad so
9068320	9071640	good okay now your iPad will touch you
9071640	9076320	oh baby no but the whole point like I
9076320	9079360	said oh you put your dick on it people
9079360	9082040	like a tactile experience I bet they do
9082040	9085720	that's what I'm talking about you guys
9085720	9090760	are children seriously but logically
9090760	9093400	take away the five-year-old laughing at
9093400	9095840	everything am I right would do you
9095840	9097400	prefer to have something in your hand
9097400	9100080	while you play or do you like waving
9100080	9101160	your hands in the air unless you're
9101160	9102880	playing para para the yeah it's
9102880	9104840	acceptable if I'm playing dance central
9104840	9106800	that's really the only game and and it's
9106800	9108800	clones those those dancing games are
9108800	9110000	really the only ones that have really
9110000	9111720	been a great experience dancing even the
9111720	9113840	fitness stuff if that actually works you
9113840	9115560	know mm-hmm yeah when the fitness games
9115560	9117600	work yeah yeah I'll agree with that same
9117600	9119080	thing same thing with the we you know
9119080	9121120	and all that but um like for I just
9121120	9122360	bitched about this last week of the week
9122360	9124640	before that Disneyland Connect I want to
9124640	9126400	pick up a controller and play it yeah
9126400	9129520	oh and especially when you're dealing
9129520	9132160	it's like they're trying to retrain an
9132160	9134640	entire generation of gamers they want
9134640	9137880	all the newer ones coming in to have a
9137880	9140080	different experience and we did where
9140080	9142120	I'm sorry we're the ones with the money
9142120	9144320	and there's nothing wrong with having a
9144320	9147360	controller you know now the only
9147360	9149200	advantage like I said I can see for
9149200	9150680	having some of this is like if someone's
9150680	9153080	got my you know horrific hand problems
9153080	9154880	but what did I do I stopped playing on
9154880	9156120	the consoles and started playing on my
9156120	9158680	PC well I think also that they want to
9158680	9159800	get rid of the controller because a lot
9159800	9162720	of elderly and older people think that
9162720	9164640	controllers are too confusing and so
9164640	9165920	it's like all you have to do is wave
9165920	9168200	your hands oh I can do that I wave my
9168200	9170160	hands at old random strangers all the
9170160	9173480	time so I'm totally used to this my hand
9173480	9175680	to get kids off my lawn I can use I can
9175680	9178720	use this as another kind of analogy here
9178720	9182080	I would I was in band and Rob you know
9182080	9183680	this you were in band what you play
9183680	9187440	clarinet yes okay well I put clarinet
9187440	9190880	too so hush but anyone who's a musician
9190880	9192000	also knows that when you play an
9192000	9194200	instrument it's not necessarily that
9194200	9195720	your brain learns it is that your
9195720	9199520	fingers learn what to do you know you
9199520	9201720	can I bet you anything that if I picked
9201720	9203040	up my saxophone I could still play
9203040	9205760	through any number of scales and not
9205760	9207720	think about it because my fingers have
9207720	9209320	been trained to do this my reflex is
9209320	9210960	trained the same goes with playing a
9210960	9213600	game after a while it's that your
9213600	9216360	fingers your thumbs become accustomed to
9216360	9218160	doing certain things you're not actively
9218160	9220160	thinking that you're doing it you just
9220160	9222240	make a decision and you do it you know
9222240	9226000	it's instinct it becomes was it motor
9226000	9227640	response isn't that what it's called
9227640	9230840	motor memory or something yeah and so I
9230840	9232640	think that's the other thing too is that
9232640	9236520	if you look at the people who are worse
9236520	9240320	with with being coordinated like actual
9240320	9242520	dancing and everything I can't dance for
9242520	9245600	crap but I can you know I can play a
9245600	9247720	game I can you are like a son of a bitch
9247720	9250440	exactly well exactly because that has to
9250440	9252480	do more with the same thing that's you
9252480	9255400	know it's a different type of your it's
9255400	9257400	and you have your hand eye coordination
9257400	9259000	going but you don't have something
9259000	9260880	that's going to be an abstract movement
9260880	9262720	as something that has attacked our
9262720	9264680	response so anyway
9264680	9268120	fair enough next email I forgot what I
9268120	9271280	was saying oh yeah hi olr just wanted to
9271280	9273040	type you a small email and let you know

9380400	9385040	going to be difficult for me to say but
9385040	9386480	I did say it on my facebook and got into
9386480	9388640	an argument with my mother of course I
9388640	9389760	can see anything on Facebook about
9389760	9391160	getting into argue with my mother fuck
9391160	9396680	that I would like to say a current fu to
9396680	9398640	the Republican Party and their choice of
9398640	9401720	who's running and his running mate I
9401720	9404640	don't think that I and I really am trying
9404640	9407080	not to be judgmental I mean okay I'm a
9407080	9408200	judgmental bitch anyway but it doesn't
9408200	9412600	matter but anyone who supports that
9412600	9416720	level of evil I don't know that I would
9416720	9418360	be able to look them in the eye so fuck
9418360	9422720	that level of evil and then

9460280	9462120	overdoing it at the gym Monday because
9462120	9464300	like I really hurt my leg by I guess I
9464300	9465760	didn't stretch good enough beforehand
9465760	9468640	or I did too much resistance and on the
9468640	9470440	bike because I do a lot of cardio and
9470440	9472200	yeah I was paying for it for like five
9472200	9473640	days I couldn't go back to the gym I
9473640	9475760	really wanted to go if I may hmm and
9475760	9477680	this is what has been drilled into my
9477680	9480480	head by all of I used to be really good
9480480	9483680	friends with one of my gym the ladies
9483680	9485840	that talk classes at my gym and you're
9485840	9487560	supposed to do a five-minute light warm
9487560	9490560	up then stretch then do your stuff oh I
9490560	9492840	didn't do that I mean I do I do the
9492840	9494600	light never stretch your muscles hold
9494600	9496840	just go right in there high resistance
9496840	9498840	obviously I tried to do the up down like
9498840	9500360	the little you know up and down like
9500360	9504080	type of thing but circuit style I guess
9504080	9506000	but I don't like circuit implies to me
9506000	9507840	you do five minutes on every machine I'm
9507840	9509680	not at that level yet you know I just I
9509680	9512360	it's if I can get my fat ass on a bike
9512360	9514520	and roll around on it for an hour that
9514520	9517160	is an accomplishment for me so but um
9517160	9520460	it's you never want to work out with
9520460	9523480	muscles that are cold you always want
9523480	9524880	like Dan you should just go sit in a
9524880	9526480	sauna before he did anything anything
9526480	9528120	but honestly you actually want to work
9528120	9530080	and then stretch and then work hmm
9530080	9532440	interesting yeah just learning something
9532440	9535200	we fit didn't tell me that or maybe it
9535200	9537840	didn't I wasn't like I said you know all
9537840	9539640	the time I used to spend working out so
9539640	9541080	all right just a couple more news
9541080	9542120	stories for you guys and then the
9542120	9545360	skype line at 1 8 7 7 game olr as well
9545360	9546840	as the Twitter topics have to get out my
9546840	9549080	iPad and see if there are any and any
9549080	9551520	last-minute stories Loki might have but
9551520	9553480	first two final stories for you guys
9553480	9556240	Loki all right so one of the games I
9556240	9557400	mentioned that played this week was
9557400	9562000	castle miner Z which is sold 900,000
9562000	9563680	copies and apparently is one of the
9563680	9565520	fastest-selling Xbox live indie games
9565520	9568000	not sure if it's the fastest selling one
9568000	9569920	but I know because I know I made a
9569920	9573440	zombie games in it all right look sorry
9573440	9575720	about that game with zombies in it sold
9575720	9578280	quite a bit and then I'm sure there's
9578280	9580480	been some other ones that have done
9580480	9582920	well as a part of the indie games
9582920	9584960	program but it's definitely one of the
9584960	9588000	most recent ones according to the
9588000	9592920	developer and then also I guess it is at
9592920	9595080	the top of the daily best-selling area
9595080	9597840	of xbox.com right now and it's only 80
9597840	9599240	microsoft points so if you want to check
9599240	9601120	it out I'm sure there's also a lot of
9601120	9603120	other good games for 80 microsoft points
9603120	9605840	on the indie games as well and another
9605840	9609760	unrelated news minecraft 7 million
9609760	9612240	copies sold on PC so that's pretty cool
9612240	9614880	so that genre of game seems to be doing
9614880	9618320	pretty well it just won't die the
9618320	9621720	phenomenon will not stop well something
9621720	9624160	that has stopped a guitar hero or at
9624160	9625800	least it's on ice for a little while and
9625800	9629200	now the lawsuits can begin they of
9629200	9631760	course started some time ago but uh you
9631760	9633320	know we talked about no doubts lawsuit
9633320	9634440	well they're not the only ones that are
9634440	9636120	suing Activision over the whole guitar
9636120	9638960	hero and band hero stuff axle rose
9638960	9645240	remember Guns N' Roses well axle rose had
9645240	9646960	a preliminary hearing about the guitar
9646960	9649320	hero 3 lawsuit apparently there is a
9649320	9652400	tentative court date in February 2013
9652400	9655200	axle rose is pissed about the game which
9655200	9658640	came out in late 2007 as a reminder and
9658640	9662000	it will finally go to court in 2013
9662000	9665320	apparently it unlawfully associated Guns
9665320	9669200	N' Roses music with slash who as you
9669200	9671680	know was formerly with good Guns N'
9671680	9674440	Roses and him and axle rose they don't
9674440	9677000	get along so axle rose was pissed about
9677000	9678360	that basically saying slash was
9678360	9680000	associated with these songs but they're
9680000	9684040	not his song so fuck all y'all right well
9684040	9686240	the judge during the preliminary hearing
9686240	9688920	wanted to toss out the claim of fraud
9688920	9691280	because the statute of limitations has
9691280	9696000	expired however let's see it came up
9696000	9698320	here quote the reason I did not file a
9698320	9700320	lawsuit because Activision through my
9700320	9702120	managers and representatives offered me
9702120	9704920	a separate video game and other business
9704920	9707160	proposals worth millions of dollars to
9707160	9709400	resolve and settle my claims relating to
9709400	9712680	guitar hero 3 from December 2007 through
9712680	9715280	November 2010 Activision was offering me
9715280	9717680	a Guns N' Roses dedicated video game a
9717680	9720080	game dedicated to music from the Chinese
9720080	9723160	democracy album and other proposals
9723160	9726280	interesting so the judge did dismiss the
9726280	9727680	claim of fraud but the breach of
9727680	9729560	contract it is moving forward for
9729560	9733240	February 1st 2013 so that's why it took
9733240	9734960	axle rose three years to file a lawsuit
9734960	9737240	because they were basically cock teasing
9737240	9738960	him about his own game or so he claims
9738960	9742080	allegedly all that good stuff but it
9742080	9743960	makes sense why they decided not to do
9743960	9746320	it because when guitar hero Van Halen
9746320	9748000	and band hero and all that kind of
9748000	9750520	oversaturated the market you know I
9750520	9752760	don't those artists centric video games
9752760	9754640	none of them really did very well the
9754640	9756920	only one that did marginally good was
9756920	9758800	the Beatles and when the Beatles can
9758800	9761360	only do marginally successful it's not
9761360	9763560	good enough you know the Green Day one
9763560	9765960	didn't do so hot Van Halen not so great
9765960	9767360	what was the other one there was one
9767360	9771120	more guitar hero italica allah oh god
9771120	9774960	that was not just not a good game so
9774960	9777680	raman our chat room says a dedicated
9777680	9779840	actual rose game and Aerosmith does it
9779840	9781880	come complete with heroin does it come
9781880	9783840	with shame and a bottle of vodka oh I
9783840	9789480	like his better welcome to unemployment
9789480	9793880	all right you know what what I need to
9793880	9795040	find something different for the fortune
9795040	9796480	cookie real quick it's the best thing
9796480	9798200	ever so hold on all right you do that

9815360	9817160	topics we don't have a lot of them but
9817160	9818960	we do have a couple of them SSJ 100 Matt
9818960	9820320	sent us a tweet and I think I already
9820320	9821800	know what this is without going to it
9821800	9823680	but he says it's a tweet that says this
9823680	9826480	is how China gets rid of outlawed arcade
9826480	9828960	machines or what they call gambling
9828960	9830600	machines and he sends us a link to a
9830600	9833320	story from arcade heroes calm yep I had
9833320	9835520	a feeling look at all these arcade
9835520	9837960	machines on fire they just set them on
9837960	9840920	fire burn it with fire burn it with fire
9840920	9844640	and there they go Loki do you have any
9844640	9847360	last-minute stories for us no I forgot
9847360	9849220	to mention it as part of my gaming week
9849220	9852400	I actually played mega zooks that's
9852400	9856640	right the old ZZT type game actually
9856640	9858640	booted that up I was like oh hey I'll
9858640	9860040	make something in this and then I
9860040	9863160	realized how out of practice and making
9863160	9866000	stuff with mega zooks I was so I said
9866000	9868120	that fuck it don't care anymore I
9868120	9869920	remember mega zooks that's awesome it
9869920	9872560	was awesome good times all right let's
9872560	9875600	go to some tweets from Tiger claw heavy
9875600	9877600	rain director tells game industry it's
9877600	9880440	time to grow up before I even get into
9880440	9881720	the article what do you guys think is it
9881720	9884160	time for the games industry to grow up
9884160	9887280	here's we mean by grow up here's here's
9887280	9889000	the one goes to one corner the other
9889000	9890600	goes to another corner here's the pole
9890600	9892920	here's the pole quote from gamasutra
9892920	9895040	which Tiger claw linked us to on Twitter
9895040	9897680	at twitter.com slash olr I mean how many
9897680	9899440	first-person shooters can you make
9899440	9901480	there's a moment where we need to grow
9901480	9904360	up and that's David cage who is the
9904360	9906320	director of beyond two souls you know
9906320	9909680	I'm sorry it sounds like he needs a grow
9909680	9911120	up because he's just it sounds like he's
9911120	9912800	whining that heavy rain didn't sell as
9912800	9914440	well you know what they're making games
9914440	9916480	that sell well hold on though because I
9916480	9918680	do agree with this you know that pole
9918680	9920440	quote is a little sensational but let's
9920440	9921800	get into the full quote here now I'm in
9921800	9924120	the article quote I think we should have
9924120	9926000	more courage in our industry and take
9926000	9928360	more risks because I think this is what
9928360	9929880	the industry needs now I mean how many
9929880	9931600	first-person shooters can you make how
9931600	9933440	many monsters alien zombies can you
9933440	9935300	killing games there's a moment where we
9935300	9937080	need to grow up we need to grow up I
9937080	9939440	think I often think the industry suffers
9939440	9941200	at the Peter Pan syndrome it's the fact
9941200	9942700	that we don't want to grow up so we stay
9942700	9944600	kids but there is a moment where you
9944600	9945960	need to grow up as an industry and you
9945960	9947320	cannot keep up with the Peter Pan
9947320	9949060	syndrome you need to grow and I think
9949060	9950840	this is the right time maybe I don't
9950840	9952120	agree so much with the second part of
9952120	9953640	that but the first part about they need
9953640	9955640	some different shit I kind of agree with
9955640	9959120	it like you know who isn't sick of sequel
9959120	9961920	sequel sequel sequel I mean granted I
9961920	9963880	guess in some ways we support it but I
9963880	9967320	do like a lot of the new ideas you know
9967320	9969480	if we did never experimented with new
9969480	9971560	ideas we wouldn't have recent hits like
9971560	9974120	Mass Effect or Little Big Planet or
9974120	9975520	which granted all spawn their own
9975520	9978720	sequels but you know good games even on
9978720	9981080	the indie side braid limbo Mass Effect
9981080	9982920	kind of turned into just a shooter with
9982920	9987860	this story but I'm just I think that the
9987860	9989320	reason why they're not taking risks
9989320	9990560	right now because whenever they seem to
9990560	9993320	try to take risks they end up not selling
9993320	9995760	well those games and you know some of
9995760	9997760	these companies are in trouble like THQ
9997760	9999900	for example they took a risk with you
9999900	10003560	know making that whole you know tablet
10003560	10005400	drawing pad thing because everyone's
10005400	10007880	like oh hey cool it's like you know like
10007880	10010240	Mario Paint and then no one bought it
10010240	10013000	and then you know they're they're out a
10013000	10014760	lot of money because that franchise
10014760	10017480	never took off or you know Tony Hawk
10017480	10019360	they made you know the stupid game with
10019360	10021520	the skateboard and that was taking risks
10021520	10023260	and no one bought it and then they did
10023260	10025480	you know DJ hero and that was kind of
10025480	10027160	taking risks as well in the music genre
10027160	10028240	and I thought it's a pretty cool game
10028240	10030520	but not that many people bought it so
10030520	10033080	this is what you get pretty ourselves
10033080	10035280	mad mad world there's another example of
10035280	10037040	a game that took risks on the Wii no one
10037040	10040240	bought it um conduit pretty awesome
10040240	10041960	first-person shooter game on the Wii no
10041960	10044000	one bought it so that's where your risk
10044000	10045920	come back left act Epton chat says I
10045920	10048400	bought Mario Paint well yeah you bought
10048400	10049720	Mario Paint but you didn't buy the
10049720	10052400	tablet that thq put out or the one that
10052400	10054800	Ubisoft put out I am I am woefully

10130280	10132520	officially over bimani everybody and
10132520	10134880	not really girls are going for today
10134880	10137960	only for that day I mean I might compete
10137960	10140480	next year if I'm more prepared but right
10140480	10143040	now it's like I didn't want to bother
10143040	10145440	this year because I said we already like
10145440	10147400	been dating for for a little over six
10147400	10150280	months now so it's like it makes sense
10150280	10152400	to just skip this this path and try the
10152400	10154960	next one mm-hmm there will definitely be
10154960	10156360	another Kings of the Coast next year
10156360	10158120	given the fact that it was like it was
10158120	10161640	packed last it was packed yesterday and
10161640	10163120	a lot of people entered I think they're
10163120	10165120	about they're almost wrapping up the
10165120	10167000	doubles tournament right now as we speak
10167000	10168640	what version of 2dx do they have out
10168640	10172200	there in Jersey link oh wow they have
10172200	10174440	out not far from me and Queens nice
10174440	10176360	that's not you know what though it's not
10176360	10177840	hard to pack eight on the break I seem
10177840	10179520	to remember it was kind of a small place
10179520	10180880	is it well because the arcade machines
10180880	10182360	took up a lot of room it would be hard
10182360	10184240	to pack that joint and I say the same
10184240	10186880	thing about SVGL what is similar I mean
10186880	10188520	it's it's not hard to pack that place
10188520	10190440	because there's not a lot of space
10190440	10194120	anyways speaking or let's digress a
10194120	10196240	little bit sure I'm gonna like post up a
10196240	10197600	link to an article that you probably
10197600	10200360	like already discussed in uh probably
10200360	10202800	earlier before I got on maybe about the
10202800	10205400	Assassin's Creed 3 director basically
10205400	10209960	chiding Japanese games and playing the
10209960	10211320	race card because they're basically
10211320	10214040	getting a free pass actually we didn't
10214040	10216080	bring this up earlier so I'm glad you
10216080	10217560	are go ahead and tell us a little bit
10217560	10219560	about this all right long story short
10219560	10221920	the director of the creative director of
10221920	10224240	Assassin's Creed 3 Alex Hutchinson he
10224240	10226560	basically went on a rant earlier last
10226560	10229800	earlier last weekend and in deriding why
10229800	10232320	like a certain like Japanese games are
10232320	10234680	getting like free passes like something
10234680	10238360	about me I saying stuff about like
10238360	10241280	Japanese just how many Japanese games
10241280	10243120	are released where the stories are
10243120	10245080	literally gibberish literally gibberish
10245080	10247160	there's no way you could write it with a
10247160	10249200	straight face and you're gonna say oh
10249200	10251520	really yeah let me let me let me read
10251520	10252760	this quote here and this is what you're
10252760	10254080	going off of here and this is in an
10254080	10257960	interview with CVG he said just think
10257960	10259200	about how many Japanese games are
10259200	10260300	released where their stories are
10260300	10262240	literally literally gibberish literally
10262240	10263640	gibberish there's no way you could write
10263640	10265000	it with a straight face and journalists
10265000	10267680	say oh it's brilliant then Gears of War
10267680	10269040	comes out and apparently it's the worst
10269040	10270640	written narrative in a game ever I'll
10270640	10272580	take Gears of War over Bayonetta every
10272580	10275240	any time it's patronizing to say oh
10275240	10277040	those Japanese stories they don't really
10277040	10279320	mean what they're doing I don't get why
10279320	10281920	critics didn't like Gears of War that's
10281920	10284240	news to me and I don't like better game
10284240	10285960	when he talks about the whole deal but
10285960	10288880	the real kicker is like the his first
10288880	10291320	response you want my real answer I think
10291320	10293760	there's a subtle racism in the business
10293760	10295120	especially on the journalist side where
10295120	10297120	Japanese developers are forgiven for
10297120	10298520	doing what they do I think it's
10298520	10301200	condescending to do this so he really
10301200	10303160	like goes off the bat he really like
10303160	10304800	goes through the juggler on the first on
10304800	10307040	the first sentence I just I think he's I
10307040	10308960	mean what about we just talked I'll tell
10308960	10310160	you what we did talk about earlier in
10310160	10312920	the show Final Fantasy you know the
10312920	10315480	Final Fantasy 13 did get hazed for a lot
10315480	10317240	of that stuff and being too linear in a
10317240	10319120	way and then of course 14 got right
10319120	10322400	through the damn coals so well 14 was an
10322400	10324240	abomination because it was poorly
10324240	10326840	executed and the fact that so many like
10326840	10329320	gaps and in the beginning and then to
10329320	10332000	the point where they had actually you
10332000	10333880	know the creative director and the
10333880	10335480	producers had to like hand in the
10335480	10339000	resignations it was just a cluster
10339000	10341360	whereas if you I mean if you look at
10341360	10343520	other American RPGs like Skyrim which
10343520	10344680	I'm actually going through right now
10344680	10347520	thank you steam sale of last month but
10347520	10350240	you see how how how verse that game is
10350240	10351920	like it's getting to the point where
10351920	10354640	I'm like putting at least two hours a
10354640	10357040	night right now just on Skyrim alone
10357040	10358840	because it's like so much so many things
10358840	10361280	to do you can level up your character if
10361280	10363160	you wanted to continue on the side on
10363160	10365480	the main quest do some side quests try
10365480	10367920	your luck in killing Giants and so it's
10367920	10370000	also but it's almost like a GTA but with
10370000	10373000	actual like goals towards like beefing
10373000	10376560	up your character stats and I think
10376560	10379360	what goes wrong with a with Japanese
10379360	10382040	games like Final Fantasy it only sticks
10382040	10383960	to I mean there is an open world there
10383960	10385920	is a concept of an open world but
10385920	10388000	everything is pretty much linear in the
10388000	10390080	sense that you have to do x mission y
10390080	10393040	mission side quests and obviously we did
10393040	10394760	the occasional grinding there's no like
10394760	10396840	there's no retribution where you could
10396840	10398840	attack freely any other type of enemy
10398840	10401280	because the combat system is so like
10401280	10404760	it's so rigid in the sense that you
10404760	10406400	randomly encounter enemies you have to
10406400	10409240	fight within within that realm of your
10409240	10412040	enemy versus your characters I mean I'm
10412040	10413880	going I'm using Final Fantasy 7 as a
10413880	10415560	frame of reference but you get the idea
10415560	10419200	that the way like but that's the like it
10419200	10421880	you know I'll do like Squeenix was just
10421880	10423760	thinking outside the box and applying
10423760	10425720	what they've already done best why can't
10425720	10427520	people just like what they like let's
10427520	10429360	just like what we like and leave people
10429360	10431720	alone well I mean I don't understand why
10431720	10433680	he's got it you know some people like
10433680	10436480	the Japanese stuff and let it be but I
10436480	10437600	don't think just because you like one
10437600	10439280	Japanese game means you love them all or
10439280	10441000	just because you love Jeff all Japanese
10441000	10442400	games there's gonna be a few you hate
10442400	10444520	you know I don't know just it's just way
10444520	10446240	too broad of a statement and I'm hoping
10446240	10448000	this is just media sensationalism here
10448000	10449720	that we're only perpetuating with this
10449720	10452320	call because I I would really just hope
10452320	10456600	that he's not that narrow-minded I don't
10456600	10459400	know so all right Zaku I gotta wrap up
10459400	10460800	let you go so we get more calls any
10460800	10462320	other thoughts here before I let you go

10624800	10628840	could get enough of it and it's so
10628840	10631200	simple like it's so like it was a little
10631200	10633600	bit they say it's just point-and-click
10633600	10635480	but there is a bit of a quick time to it
10635480	10637160	every now and again that you're gonna do
10637160	10639200	but it's like baby quick time you know
10639200	10640880	what I'm saying yeah like it's pretty
10640880	10642960	baby quick time which is exactly what I
10642960	10645120	need on a Sunday night when I've been
10645120	10658560	having salad it's not really so anyway

10697960	10699880	even started making a little theme music
10699880	10702360	and stuff man for the show I gave like I
10702360	10704400	gave Jim Sally a name for his show
10704400	10706760	because Jim Sally suggested he be the
10706760	10709000	opener for the opener like he could open
10709000	10711200	for Bobby which I don't consider Bobby an
10711200	10712920	opener I consider him a cohead liner but
10712920	10714660	since he calls himself an opener I'll go
10714660	10716580	with that Jim Sally said he could be the
10716580	10718160	opener for the opener but I said well
10718160	10719780	Jim I think you would be better as the
10719780	10721760	closer and you could be pillow talk with
10721760	10723760	Jim Sally like right as we go off the
10723760	10725340	air he could like read you all a bed
10725340	10728720	time story now go the fuck to sleep
10728720	10731240	you're listening to the night train with
10731240	10736480	Jim Sally like that the night train
10736480	10739160	that's good that's good all I'm saying
10739160	10740760	I'm just throwing it out there for you
10740760	10742760	for you Jim or for anybody out there in
10742760	10744040	the in the universe listening to this
10744040	10746400	show vog network we are very interested
10746400	10750300	in getting some movie podcast would be
10750300	10752960	great book podcast is like at the top of
10752960	10754920	my want list right now be it manga
10754920	10758240	comic or written book and bugging my
10758240	10761840	wife also wrote I I would love to see
10761840	10764360	like a role play bit like an old-school
10764360	10767400	tabletop gaming and it could be larping
10767400	10769800	Dungeons & Dragons and I love love love
10769800	10773440	so do this I love love love the idea of
10773440	10777160	a game that is podcast like somebody
10777160	10779040	who's not sure that would be difficult
10779040	10780600	somebody who's actually running a game
10780600	10782560	to be podcast it's done everyone at the
10782560	10785720	table would need a microphone now I get
10785720	10788600	some good food mics well that or and
10788600	10791960	you'd have to have the die cam you see
10791960	10793280	them rolling and see who's cheating at
10793280	10795280	the table oh and I didn't nudge that
10795280	10798640	that was I sneezed Jamie just rolled a
10798640	10802520	seven on the 20-sided die so this means
10802520	10804360	that she has failed her intelligence
10804360	10813760	check please which would be really sad given that you know if I failed an
10813760	10817840	intelligence check with a seven given that I know okay that's really giving it
10817840	10819840	away but but for real although I will say
10819840	10821840	this as much as I am teasing Jim Sally
10821840	10822940	with the idea of starting his own show
10822940	10824840	involved we do like to look for

10973520	10977360	tweet from tiger claw god I fucking hate

10979560	10982280	spot now has a free iPad app click OK to
10982280	10984480	get that fuck no one car I wanted your
10984480	10987560	app I would go download it the worst are
10987560	10989640	the ones with the gigantic splash screen
10989640	10991240	so obviously tiger claw linked me to a
10991240	10993160	game spot article oh but there's a call
10993160	10994400	coming in so you'll just have to wait
10994400	10996360	and see what it's about
10996360	10998300	hi you're on orange launch radio who's
10998300	11001560	this well hello there fine oler Ian's
11001560	11005040	it's stir luck I got called fine what's
11005040	11011000	up stir luck not too much I don't know
11011000	11014560	if you talked about the Vita firmware
11014560	11017560	update in part a I kind of missed a lot
11017560	11019480	of it briefly it let off our rapid-fire
11019480	11022200	news tonight but go ahead it was we talk
11022200	11023560	quickly about it so what do you want to
11023560	11026600	say about it um well it kind of makes me
11026600	11029480	want a Vita now what what a firmware
11029480	11031120	update makes you want a Vita what is it
11031120	11032360	about the firmware update that makes you
11032360	11034960	want it because they added a feature
11034960	11037160	that should have been in there from the
11037160	11041680	beginning which is use of the buttons in
11041680	11044640	the home screen which you would think
11044640	11046640	would have been in there by default but
11046640	11048880	I don't know what the hell so he was
11048880	11050760	thinking now something the listeners may
11050760	11052480	not remember about you from previous
11052480	11054080	phone calls to the show but you're blind
11054080	11056720	right yep so this is something that is
11056720	11059080	kind of important if you're trying to
11059080	11062760	navigate that was literally I was pretty
11062760	11064280	stoked for the Vita when I heard about
11064280	11066040	some of the games that were coming to it
11066040	11071160	especially like Mortal Kombat something
11071160	11074240	like sound shapes too is awesome you know
11074240	11076560	I think I think even being you know with
11076560	11078560	blind the way you kind of interact with
11078560	11080120	the sounds and the fact that the sounds
11080120	11081800	kind of drive the stage a little bit I
11081800	11084320	think you'd get a kick out of it um okay
11084320	11088280	to have um how prevalent is the
11088280	11089720	touchscreen and sound chips I don't
11089720	11091280	really done a lot of research into it or
11091280	11092800	is it all button-based you don't have to
11092800	11094480	use it at all if you want to design
11094480	11096360	stages you have to use it a little bit
11096360	11098840	but if you interesting when I have to
11098840	11100640	check that one out I think I think you
11100640	11102440	get a kick out of it I'm also a big fan
11102440	11105720	of the Riven rhythm heaven slash Tengoku
11105720	11112560	series on the GBA and DS and we most
11112560	11114600	recently those are pretty awesome do you
11114600	11117360	think that maybe Sony realized you know
11117360	11119440	oops we're not really being
11119440	11122080	accommodating all people I know some
11122080	11124760	people that did send letters to them
11124760	11128880	about it and not all of them being blind
11128880	11131200	I've heard even a lot of sighted people
11131200	11135160	bitching so it's it's not just a blind
11135160	11137280	thing it's a convenience thing also it is
11137280	11139480	true like sometimes you don't like you
11139480	11142000	don't need to be all touchy-feely with
11142000	11144120	the game system like sometimes it's it's
11144120	11146800	fine to let me put it this way I like my
11146800	11149000	buttons one of the bitches I had about
11149000	11151240	sound shapes on the Vita was that it
11151240	11154280	wasn't nearly as precise on the Vita in
11154280	11156600	in the design phase the game phase is
11156600	11158360	fine but the design phase isn't nearly
11158360	11159840	as precise on the Vita because you have
11159840	11161920	to use like that back touch panel to
11161920	11163920	like stretch things and you know put
11163920	11165720	them where you want and stuff and it
11165720	11167640	kind of stinks but when you play on the
11167640	11169760	PlayStation 3 you can use the controller
11169760	11172040	and you get that precision much more
11172040	11174480	with the analog sticks yeah yeah it's
11174480	11177040	much better so that was you know pretty
11177040	11180520	awesome a bitch of mine so yeah all
11180520	11182160	right well stir lock anything else you
11182160	11185000	want to share a listeners tonight um I
11185000	11187440	don't know I was just having random
11187440	11190760	thoughts actually I don't remember where
11190760	11193160	I found it now but Jim Sally was talking
11193160	11196440	about like D&D sessions and like podcast
11196440	11198320	worm I've seen that done before and it's
11198320	11200040	pretty awesome it is it is I would love
11200040	11202280	to get a show like that on that would be
11202280	11205160	funny though like doing the whole you
11205160	11207720	know World Series of Poker style
11207720	11210000	commentary like Dark Sakura has deployed
11210000	11213560	her 20-sided die she's currently
11213560	11218400	attempting her saving throw I was low
11218400	11222680	and she didn't quite make it I would
11222680	11224560	love it but you know we'll have to we'll
11224560	11225720	have to see what's out there because you
11225720	11227560	know as Bobby's emphasizing in chat we
11227560	11229220	are kind of looking for shows that are
11229220	11231640	already you know because we don't really
11231640	11233240	want to bring on show again it's all
11233240	11234680	about you know people might have an idea
11234680	11236320	and like oh I want to do this I want to
11236320	11238240	do this but then they don't realize how
11238240	11240400	hard it really is there's a lot of work
11240400	11243240	that goes into it is doing something I

11322120	11323760	think I got almost everybody was trying
11323760	11325360	to get through but if I missed you I may
11325360	11327200	not have seen it I'm very sorry send us
11327200	11329640	an email mailbag at orange lounge radio
11329640	11331880	calm let me get back real quick to that
11331880	11334120	tweet that I mentioned from Tiger claw
11334120	11336480	will close out with this tonight dice
11336480	11339560	the battlefield developer afraid to
11339560	11343040	release battlefield 3 mod tools they
11343040	11346840	said at GDC Europe that apparently the
11346840	11349120	studio was fearful of the implications
11349120	11352200	of releasing the mod tools let's see they
11352200	11354160	were quote and this is a quote from
11354160	11357360	Magnus Trudson who is the general
11357360	11361160	manager of dice said quote afraid of all
11361160	11363400	the things that can come with releasing
11363400	11366640	the code quote if we do mod support we
11366640	11368880	want to do it really really well we are
11368880	11372120	not ready to do this yet interesting I
11372120	11374520	guess oh and also that if the mods come
11374520	11377120	out they want console players in two I
11377120	11378800	think that part's kind of interesting as
11378800	11380120	well is that they don't want to just
11380120	11382560	just let it be for PC they want console
11382560	11384480	players to get in on the fun that's kind
11384480	11388720	of nice pretty cool all right I have a
11388720	11390840	couple I have a couple last-minute
11390840	11392720	tweets here so what the hell I'll read
11392720	11394840	them there's a couple tweets here from
11394840	11397680	ratchet 1785 on Twitter they literally
11397680	11399240	came in one minute ago so I'll go ahead
11399240	11401720	and read these ratchet 1785 asks are you
11401720	11404760	guys excited about Borderlands 2 first
11404760	11406360	live show by the way and this is the
11406360	11408080	best three-year listener well howdy
11408080	11410520	doody and get your button chat next time
11410520	11411600	if you're not already there I don't see
11411600	11414120	you there live dot vog network calm are
11414120	11415720	you guys excited about Borderlands 2 I
11415720	11419480	don't even have to ask Loki I I don't
11419480	11421040	know if excited is the right word but
11421040	11423280	I'm highly curious about Borderlands 2
11423280	11424840	because I liked what I played of
11424840	11427400	Borderlands 1 I really need to play more
11427400	11431520	of it so yeah I'm I will check it out
11431520	11433280	and I like some of the things they're
11433280	11435240	doing with it I don't like that whole
11435240	11436960	mess earlier this week about the whole
11436960	11438840	girlfriend mode and all that crap that
11438840	11440480	was going around but I'm just gonna
11440480	11443720	chalk a lot of that up to the media and
11443720	11445640	Twitter and the internet kind of
11445640	11447160	latching on to one thing and then
11447160	11449000	running with it and it's not going to
11449000	11450600	affect the quality of the game I think
11450600	11452400	at the end of the day the way that
11452400	11454200	they're doing like an easy mode tree
11454200	11456500	that sounds great to me that's not a
11456500	11458880	girlfriend mode that's a me mode and I
11458880	11459920	know there's a lot of people that feel
11459920	11461880	the same way you know I don't mind
11461880	11463800	playing that the games on on an easier
11463800	11465840	mode to get the story and the experience
11465840	11468200	I'm actually planning on playing through
11468200	11472520	Mass Effect 3 on insanity good luck in
11472520	11476520	God though a good well then that's no
11476520	11479840	fair no all right and lastly also tell
11479840	11481440	your listeners I'm giving away a copy of
11481440	11483520	Borderlands 2 on my gaming channel on
11483520	11486680	youtubes but then he didn't link it so
11486680	11487920	I'm gonna hope it's the same name
11487920	11491600	ratchet 1785 if it's not the same name I
11491600	11494120	guess tune in next week cuz that's gonna
11494120	11496280	do it for tweets tonight twitter.com
11496280	11500360	slash o LR and that's about gonna do it
11500360	11502440	for the show tonight but not until we go
11502440	11504040	around and get everybody's final
11504040	11506360	thought um Loki will start with you

11507480	11510680	stories right yeah I just don't care
