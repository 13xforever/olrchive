11129	12310	and Loki.
14072	24260	Tonight, August 19, 2012, we run down the news from Gamescom, the 3DS XL is released and the Neo Geo console is set to be released all over again.
31604	37346	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37406	49291	It is Orange Lounge Radio live at the Voice of Geeks Network, VOGnetwork.com for this August 19th, 2012 with the 470th episode of our program.
49791	50672	My name is Rob Roberts.
50692	56794	I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about everything going on in the world of gaming and then some with my co-hosts.
56994	59535	First off, say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
59735	60055	Hi.
60256	60816	How are you, ma'am?
61696	62977	I'm sore.
63377	63737	Sore?
64518	64778	Yes.
65218	66799	What have you been doing that's made you sore?
66959	69581	Well, hey, what kind of girl do you think I am?
69981	70982	A DDR playing girl?
71062	71742	Yes, actually.
71882	72883	Okay.
73383	74224	We'll touch on that in a minute.
74344	74964	All right, fair enough.
75284	76765	Say hello as well to Tech Master Loki.
77186	77346	Hi.
77586	78226	How are you doing, Loki?
78386	78766	Doing good.
79147	79467	Awesome.
79507	86091	So what food won the, for those that play the home game of betting on what you bring in for food every week, what won this week?
86400	87921	The Double Western at Carl's Jr.
88081	89362	or Hardee's on the East Coast.
90383	90824	There you go.
91404	91724	All right.
92545	99130	Of course, the always present fourth guest on our show is you guys at our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.
99170	102413	And we'll be reading some of the comments from our chat room throughout the night.
102753	104615	So be sure to get in there so you can participate with us.
105195	106416	Just the three of us in studio.
106436	108676	This is the first show in a little while, it seems like, with no guests.
109136	109837	It's a little lonely.
109857	111437	It's a little lonely and sad in here tonight.
111877	113638	And I don't know how we're going to top last week's episode.
113658	114598	That was a pretty good episode.
114878	116479	So we'll try, though.
117359	119340	We'll bring our best C game tonight.
120520	121121	No, you know what?
121141	126664	We actually have some awesome things tonight that are... We could point a webcam at my boobs or something, I don't know.
126684	128826	Oh, the webcam's in the other... No, you took the webcam, didn't you?
128846	129306	I did take it.
129586	130587	And it works.
130787	133909	You confiscated it, so no booby cam tonight.
133929	137892	Well, it's so unfortunate that your Dell Millie doesn't have a webcam built into it.
138012	138812	Oh, wait, it does!
138912	140773	That's true, I do have my iPad.
141274	141554	No.
141754	143095	And the Ustream app on the iPad.
143235	147298	And I've made sure that the webcam stuff is disabled on my laptop.
148178	150840	Because I deleted all the Windows shit and have the Linux shit.
151721	151941	All right.
151981	154863	In all seriousness, we have some fun stuff going on tonight.
155624	159987	We have a soundtrack preview going on tonight, which is pretty cool.
160247	162248	From the Darksiders 2 soundtrack.
162729	165291	And this is going to be both for the podcast listeners and the live listeners.
165631	168253	Thanks to Something Music, S-U-M thing.
168533	170074	But I'll talk more about that later on.
170134	174858	But there's all sorts of information on where you can get the soundtrack at our website, vognetwork.com.
175638	183805	Of course, the Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com is the website where we tape our show live for you kids every Sunday night at 6 p.m.
183845	191511	Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after our pal Bobby Blackwolf with his show, The Bobby Blackwolf Show, at 5 Pacific, 8 Eastern, every Sunday.
191831	194974	And lots of other great shows at the Voice of Geeks Network as well.
195254	199416	Not just gaming shows, but shows about TV talk, like Critical Myth.
199436	200617	They do some movies as well.
200897	203919	British Invaders, kind of a similar thing, but with a very British twist.
204219	206500	PodCulture is awesome.
206560	208341	And PodCulture's got something special tomorrow.
208361	209702	They're back with an all-new episode.
209722	210823	They've been off for a couple weeks.
211483	215425	But they are talking to somebody who's publishing a series of books.
216146	221269	And I'm not sure if I'm supposed to say this, so a little preview.
221649	223010	They're actually doing a giveaway.
223030	223290	Oop.
224650	227191	Be sure to tune in and check that out at PodCulture.
227511	228391	Lots of other great shows too.
228411	230332	Anime Jam Session, Girls Gone Wild, Horde House.
230952	231692	Horde House is okay.
233713	235833	But the rest of the shows are great.
236693	236993	Let's see.
237774	241875	We usually start off the show talking about our gaming weeks, but we usually have a kickoff topic.
243155	245395	And I thought I'd bring up something that's a little bit recurring.
245595	245936	Crack!
247256	249836	What was the first time we talked about crack on the show?
250397	251157	Don't do drugs, kids.
251177	251597	Drugs are bad.
252197	258560	So, okay, y'all know we have a little bit of a history with Kickstarter and kind of like talking about that site.
258640	261602	And we're not always a fan of a lot of the things we see on Kickstarter.
261642	264843	At least I should say, I'm not always a fan of a lot of the stuff I see on Kickstarter.
265124	268185	DarkSakura has not always been a fan of the stuff she sees on Kickstarter.
268565	271427	Loki has contributed way too many Kickstarters.
272087	272807	It wasn't that many.
273788	274188	How many?
274628	274989	How many?
275049	275909	How many is not that many?
275949	277790	It's at least five, right?
280009	280450	See?
281591	281851	See?
282091	282812	Seven, I'm sorry.
283012	284193	All right, well, here's the point.
285655	287317	I donated to a Kickstarter this week.
287597	289679	I actually finally joined the website.
290540	291821	I signed up for Kickstarter.
292722	294464	It was to expand the Mantis website.
294484	294785	I'm sorry.
294805	295665	No, no.
296426	297087	Heck no.
297667	298528	Oh, make that nine.
298748	299448	Sorry.
299528	300609	Nine Kickstarters?
301009	304431	Suddenly this week... You know, you can just take that money and give it to me and I'll put it to better use.
304692	307794	This week from maybe five to nine?
308054	309175	Well, there's some I forgot.
309255	311957	I forgot about those playing cards.
312537	314018	Those are awesome.
314178	315719	Dan was like, wow, that's cool.
315799	318881	I forgot about the Megaran thing, which I'm still waiting on.
318941	320642	There's apparently the comic coming too.
320802	323824	And then Shadowrun Returns.
324145	325425	Shadowrun Returns would be awesome.
325526	326046	Can't wait for that.
326606	331391	But yeah, so I actually donated to a Kickstarter this week.
332091	338337	I even went so far as to donate $180 to this Kickstarter.
338457	339858	$180 to this Kickstarter.
340379	342100	Cue dramatic chipmunk.
342741	343422	Or prairie dog.
343442	343722	Whatever.
347978	351019	There's nothing like a meme from five years ago to lighten the mood.
352239	355040	I gave $180 to the GamerCon Kickstarter.
355521	357721	The G-A-Y GamerCon Kickstarter.
359702	360742	I think it's a great idea.
360922	368625	And I can totally see where being a startup event, they really need the money to be able to reserve the venue and do something big.
368845	370446	And it's been great promotion for them.
370526	373847	And as somebody who's a gamer myself, it's something I want to support.
374207	377328	So Alan kind of made it known that he wouldn't mind going and
377848	378709	I wouldn't mind going.
380170	381871	If I'm going to do this, I'm going to do it big.
382211	383492	I don't do anything half-assed.
383772	386554	So I threw down for VIP passes for both Alan and I. It sent me back $180.
387795	389637	So yeah, there you go.
389897	391098	I donated to a Kickstarter.
391991	392271	DarkSakura.com
422491	427494	It's not that... If I can get the boobies in there, that'd be kind of cool.
427514	428034	Here's the thing.
428054	429035	I bet there is a boob con.
429055	429695	I'm going to look for it.
429815	430616	Here's the thing.
430816	436138	Okay, boob con is every other gaming convention, and there'll probably be some boob con at GamerCon.
436539	438120	Let's not forget the lesbians.
438220	439400	There is a boob con.
440621	442802	I think that's... Oh, it's a Facebook utility.
444083	445423	The whole thing is that...
448292	453994	I like the idea of having this event and to bring gay gamers together because I've met a lot of really cool people.
454074	459196	One of my really good friends I met at a gay gamer event in the Bay Area, and we're friends to this day.
459256	464638	My friend Spike, who is one of the co-hosts on Game Boy, we met at one of those gay gamer parties.
465258	469259	And it's not that straight people are forbidden from coming.
469619	473701	In fact, I'm sure Dark Sakura is going to pre-order as soon as she's got them.
474021	477522	As soon as she has her Kickstarter funded, she's going to pre-order a ticket to GamerCon, right?
477802	478082	I'd go.
478383	478583	Yeah.
478903	482247	I don't know that I'd be able to afford, you know, $90 tickets.
482267	485431	You're not going to be shunned because you have boobies and you're not going to be shunned.
485451	486813	I'll just wear a shirt that says hag.
490037	495724	But here's the other thing is that, you know, obviously...
496861	511409	I don't know how far I want to go with this like this controversial topic or whatever but in the gaming culture you know a lot of times gay guys and ladies have to put up with all this garbage we hear on Xbox Live and you know
512009	513511	Fag, fag, fag.
513772	514793	And it's not like we're alone.
514914	516716	There's a lot of racist stuff that happens.
516736	520342	There's a lot of really bad things that happen on Xbox Live.
520362	521704	Why do you think I only play with you guys?
521804	526691	And everything negative usually has some type of connotation to like, oh, so-and-so's a fag.
527560	535263	It's because the people that play on Xbox Live and actually just a lot of people that play games nowadays online are very unintelligent and young.
535723	543285	I know that for a fact from the modding community that I talk to these people directly and it's like, can you guys compose an actual sentence without sounding stupid?
543745	551228	Seriously, can you compose a sentence that actually makes sense that doesn't have any sort of complete misspellings of everything?
551823	552243	DarkSakura.com
574045	578951	In the gay culture, even, people are like, oh, you play video games all day?
579132	583077	You mean you don't like to... Accessorize?
583898	590767	You don't like to go to concerts, or you don't listen to such and such artist, or you don't read such and such blogs, or a lot of those types of things.
591588	592648	Exactly.
594069	597212	I know this might be a thing I'm not supposed to say, but it's true.
597612	599634	I have faced some of that in the gay culture.
600034	617188	So it's tough sometimes because you don't feel like you fit in column A. You don't feel like you fit in column B. So I think it's really awesome that there's a lot of people raising their voice thanks to the internet that feel like they kind of don't fit in these columns and having a convention to just celebrate
618072	618512	We're here.
618972	627216	I don't think the con exists to make a statement or the con exists to further the cause or whatever.
627336	629537	I think the con exists to have fun.
630097	631158	And that's what I plan to do.
631598	635240	I'm going to have a gay old time and gay isn't happy.
635600	636620	I'm going to have a gay old time.
637701	638501	It's going to be a good time.
640082	640502	Well, I mean...
642259	644600	The only other equivalent is YaoiCon, really.
645101	645661	And YaoiCon exists.
645721	646862	And that's more for girls.
649963	657468	I think GamerCon is just for anybody that just wants to have fun in a supportive environment.
657608	659489	And besides that, you were talking about Columns.
659569	660189	Fuck Columns.
660429	661150	That game was shit.
662498	662859	No, no, no.
663219	673634	But I think that the moment we can move past labels and pointing fingers is why, you know, when anyone says, well, I have this or I am this.
673714	676538	I'm like, you look like you're a human being to me.
677381	677762	Actlikeit
694740	697501	Did you, just letter you, get it to work?
697561	698521	Okay, that makes sense.
698881	699341	How about this one?
699961	701542	Should we take thing away?
703322	708644	Okay, just let me know because trying to get it by today.
709844	711365	Okay, that is fine.
711645	713665	What do you think it is?
714886	719867	And just let me know when you get it to work.
720587	721728	Oh my fucking god.
721768	722950	How is Babi formed?
723630	724771	It's like, seriously.
725632	725712	It...
729039	735765	Let me go to some comments from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com where we have plenty of folks in chat participating live with us tonight.
735825	738347	JV Mon wants to know, where is GamerCon anyway?
738688	739829	They haven't picked a venue yet.
739929	741090	It's going to be in San Francisco.
741150	743352	They've said that much, but we don't know what venue.
743372	744873	I mean, that could be a lot of different places.
744933	746094	That could be a hotel.
746154	746875	They could do it at the Hilton.
747115	749097	They could do it at the Moscone Center if they get enough money.
749537	751399	I don't know where they're going to have it yet.
751939	755042	So more to come on that, but it will be in San Francisco somewhere.
755722	756543	ACIDICVAMPIRE in chat says...
776140	787337	Ragenator says sadly enough when someone proclaims that they're a gamer to someone the other person immediately pictures a fat balding middle-aged slob eating Cheetos in their mom's basement and never goes outside
788598	790198	Hey, I like Cheetos, just for the record.
791439	797821	But no, I mean, exactly the point is that, you know, there's kind of these, like, stereotypes, and it's throughout all of our cultures.
798941	800701	Speaking of Cheetos, you know what's wrong with Cheetos?
800961	802382	Is they have those giant Cheetos.
802702	809924	I mean, really, the cheese powder to whatever else Cheetos are made out of ratio is just fucked up by that.
809944	810064	I mean...
811710	814011	So, Loki, any chance that you would go to GamerCon?
814231	816692	Probably not, because I'm not really allowed to travel right now.
818573	821955	But what if you told the wife it was a gay gamer convention?
822015	822475	She'd laugh.
822515	823275	She would get a kick out of that.
823295	827077	Yeah, she'd probably laugh at that, because... We should try to get a panel.
827157	827777	I would love that.
828578	829818	Would she let you go if we had a panel?
830038	831319	Perhaps, yeah.
831619	831959	Okay.
831999	832759	Totally get us a panel.
833400	834140	We'll see what we can do.
834220	834560	I don't know.
835261	835901	And free tickets.
838007	839228	All right, moving on.
839488	843312	Let's talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week, and how was your gaming week?
843392	845073	DarkSakura, you hinted at this a minute ago.
845093	845974	I played The Ditter.
847896	848776	Okay, this is what happened.
849437	851379	That's Dance Dance Revolution for the uninformed.
851439	851639	Yes.
852840	860146	I was working at this place, and everyone knows I got laid off, but it was an amicable breakup.
860306	860967	Amicable breakup.
862284	867506	I still got to go to the company picnic, which was at Golfland on some corporate picnic day.
868227	872788	So, yeah, there were still a bunch of annoying teenagers, but it was okay.
872948	877650	But you got one of those little bracelets that let you get go-karts and a laser tag, which I didn't do either.
879091	881712	And get in the water park, which I didn't do either.
881732	881792	But...
884733	885613	We just went in and had a good time.
885633	889374	But while we were waiting for lunch to be served, I went inside to go play some DDR.
889714	891794	Because we also got 20 credits on one of those little cards.
893255	895275	Well, there were already three credits in the DDR.
895295	897736	So I'm like, I'll play them all.
898296	899396	It was on four songs.
900216	904537	So I played 12 songs back to back and decided that I'm going to finish out with Superstar.
904557	906478	Because, damn it, I'm not old.
906538	907058	I can still do it.
907078	909678	Although I did fail Cowgirl, which is very sad.
909698	911099	Because that used to be one of my best ones.
911319	912239	Bang, ba-doo, bang.
912479	912759	I know.
913899	931174	and I've made it through that and by the time I got done I felt like I needed to throw up because I was hot and I hadn't done anything strenuous like that in a while and that's the point where you realized I was in my DDR prime 10 years ago when I weighed 30 pounds more than I do now which is sad
933155	939961	So anyway, I went and had a good time at lunch and I felt better once I ate something and had a good time.
939981	943904	And my BFF forever, Specky, was there with the boy and her hubby.
944324	945145	Hi, they're listening.
946326	946746	Hi, Ro.
947206	947567	Hi, Ro.
948047	952711	And we had a really good time and Dan and I played copious amounts of Tank Tank Tank.
953251	956313	And there's this other game too that I... Are you guys going to pick that up on Wii U?
957194	957895	Is it coming out?
958015	962417	Yeah, Tank Tank Tank is going to be one of the launch games for Wii U. I don't know if we're getting a Wii U, but I fucking want that game, so maybe we will.
963058	965439	Okay, I'm trying to find the name of this game.
965599	968261	Okay, it's a Sega game called Let's Go Island.
969122	970783	Lost on the Island of Tropics.
971463	973624	And it's a shooter game where you're on a...
974645	976226	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
997253	1009041	it's great and then like when you finish each like the last like the boss of the first level is this huge mungus squid and you also have to jerk your controller in a certain way to get past these little cut scenes it's pretty cute but um
1009810	1016457	That sounds all sorts of like... How was that game called?
1017118	1018359	Oh, well, they totally interrupted that.
1018719	1019901	It's one of their gun shooting games.
1019961	1020621	It was really awesome.
1020641	1022764	I love that it was on the Wii and also in the arcade.
1022844	1024125	Freaking Sega, of course.
1025166	1028670	Anyway, it... What was I saying?
1028710	1028910	Oh, yeah.
1029230	1032113	So when you finish the level, though, it does a compatibility meter.
1032734	1033955	to see how compatible you are.
1033975	1035315	And Dan and I were 60%.
1037456	1044679	But it's also funny when you shoot the same things, it gives you this like twin bonus and you get little hearts and everything flowing out of it.
1045140	1049622	But like I died at the second stage and so Dan continued and he made it a little bit further.
1050082	1057345	And then it's like when you get like less than 10% compatibility, it says you wouldn't sit next to him on the bus.
1058025	1059146	I was like, wow, that's kind of cold.
1059466	1065149	and then I played more DDR and Dan played with me and he's like, I forgot how to play.
1065429	1066990	I never ever saw Dan play DDR.
1067010	1068510	Dan used to play my Dreamcast one with me.
1068810	1068991	Fun.
1069031	1072692	He like, you know, he could, like the hardest he could do was like Dynamite Rave.
1072772	1075033	Dan was one of those guys who didn't want to admit he played DDR.
1075914	1076294	Yeah.
1076758	1077559	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1101336	1124703	so I was like I'm out of practice so we actually discussed this we're gonna hook back up our JPS2 and start playing our DDR games again because I've got those dance pads that I got at the thrift store that were like three for six bucks and like one of them didn't work the other two did so we're gonna start playing DDR again at home good luck thanks it's all part of the plan
1125595	1126355	I also played more games.
1143959	1166789	more more games alrighty because I'm still playing through Mass Effect Mass Effect 2 for Becky with a Para FemShep and Garrus totally Garrus I'm still playing through Mass Effect 3 which I'm still at the same part that I am and every time I load it up I just get depressed and turn it back off and I want to play more multiplayer next week does it involve Morden?
1167770	1172892	no oh okay no I'm I already passed that I'm not Thessia oh okay oh yeah that part
1173712	1175513	But this time I'm taking Javik with me and not Garrus.
1175533	1177294	Garrus gets to stay home and not be depressed.
1179896	1180777	How considerate of you.
1181337	1184419	I'm very, very considerate of Turians and their sensitive natures.
1186501	1189122	And I have my fourth 85 in WoW.
1190183	1190443	Addict.
1191424	1192464	Dealer, how many do you have?
1193045	1194586	I got my fifth this week.
1195747	1197108	I got my four in last time.
1197128	1198609	I now have two Druids at 85.
1199485	1202207	Leviathan is coming, the DLC for Mass Effect I know!
1202267	1203147	Someone's excited I am!
1227512	1228613	I can't wait to check it out.
1228913	1230675	Why does this all have to hit the same day?
1231135	1235298	Leviathan, Guild Wars 2, and the big WoW patch all hit the same day.
1235318	1236999	How much is Leviathan going to be?
1237159	1237419	Probably $10.
1238260	1241062	I think the Vita patch is that day too.
1241402	1242283	We have a story on it later.
1242343	1242843	Guess what?
1243244	1244284	I'm not playing Guild Wars.
1245605	1248547	I want to check it out, but at least there's no monthly fee.
1248567	1250929	I know Guild Wars is one of those things I can kind of look at any time.
1251320	1257745	Yeah, but I mean, I've still got a... I'm probably, to be honest, not going to get the WoW thing right away.
1258745	1263389	Except if I ever get paid for one of my projects, maybe I'll buy it, you know, as a treat to myself.
1265690	1269133	It's just like, while I've still got other tunes to work on, like, what's the point?
1269773	1270033	You know?
1270253	1270494	Yeah.
1271394	1278319	But the thing I'm excited about for WoW is that... I know this isn't Horde House, but I'm excited that all of the races are going to be available soon.
1280152	1281233	from the get-go for everybody.
1281913	1286435	Yeah, and that's not in our news roll tonight because I was going to save that for Horde House, which is fine.
1286775	1295078	But yeah, the big news about anybody can play any race except don't expect to play a panda next Tuesday.
1295219	1297500	Pandas will unlock with Pandaria.
1298020	1300561	However, you don't have to have Mr. Pandaria to roll a panda.
1300921	1302742	But you will need to go past level 85.
1303402	1307705	TigerClaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says...
1326658	1330480	Yeah, that trailer was released this week out of Gamescom, the new World of Warcraft trailer.
1330781	1331861	It looked great.
1332462	1333963	The CGI was beautiful.
1334203	1339646	And you know, with all this talk about a World of Warcraft movie and all this, it's like, just do that for 90 minutes.
1339706	1340226	It'll be great.
1340707	1342368	Although, I have to say, overall...
1342728	1344149	I was a little disappointed in the trailer.
1344529	1351234	The reason why is that I would hope that the cinematic trailer would show a little bit of everything.
1351595	1357039	And there's so much beauty in this expansion in the realm of Pandaria and some of these new five mans.
1357059	1358520	They don't really show any of that.
1358720	1363003	I wanted to see a rendered version of the Temple of the Jade Serpent and some of that gorgeous stuff.
1363585	1371508	I've just been looking at data dumps for some of the internal stuff.
1372028	1377570	Basically people just doing run-throughs of the empty temples and the empty dungeons and everything, so this looks pretty neat.
1378030	1380651	Before we turn into an episode of Horde House, let's let you finish up.
1380671	1381271	We'll move on to Loki.
1381789	1409124	well I'm also very pissed off at all the people nudging me on words with friends and I'm about ready to delete it yeah I'm getting that with song pop I'm kind of over song pop now like it was fun for two weeks but now now I've moved on to another game and I can't help it and I'm glad I didn't pay for the game and I'm not paying for any of it but I still like draw something and the only reason I'm still playing is because I haven't paid for it and I'm not looking at any ads so I'm all cool I've drawn some perverted shit in that game
1411050	1411931	All right, Loki.
1413792	1414172	Let's see.
1414792	1423838	I played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, a little bit of that, and Minecraft, a whole lot of Minecraft.
1424338	1425719	Getting bored with it again.
1426339	1432763	I think the problem is I don't have a lot of people to play with, and that's really odd considering there's so many people that bought the game.
1433844	1438728	None of my friends seem to be playing games that we can join in or whatever.
1438868	1443432	So I'm playing with my coworker and we're just like... The map that we're on, we've kind of explored everything.
1443452	1445554	I got to the point where I'm like, okay, fuck it.
1445574	1449337	I'm going to go ahead and start duping again because there's still a way you can dupe stuff.
1449357	1451259	So I duped a bunch of dynamite and just create a hole.
1452300	1454082	And then I was like, wow, create a crater.
1454882	1455703	Bored still.
1456023	1456384	It's like...
1457748	1458729	May I interject one thing?
1458949	1461390	Yeah I saw one thing that made me love Minecraft What?
1462011	1467794	It was this video that someone did and lined up explosives and everything that says I love and when it exploded it said but
1471189	1472450	That's so mature, I love it.
1473491	1486239	I love that that might be, because you know, DarkSakura, if you've been listening to previous episodes, she's not very, she kind of frowns on Minecraft, but I love that I Love Butts may have cracked the door open a little bit to DarkSakura getting on the Minecraft tour.
1486279	1486820	Cracked the door open.
1487060	1488601	It cracked the door open.
1489021	1493884	Well, I'm not saying it made me like the game, but it made me laugh like my ass off, like on my ass.
1495485	1500769	And that and seeing people making giant pigs and like Goombas and Mario and shit, that was pretty funny.
1501451	1505968	you do realize I have a giant pig in my map I was talking about your giant pig
1509406	1511026	Anyways, moving on.
1512707	1517228	I did happen to see, for example, something that was more structured to be kind of fun with other people.
1517548	1521469	I watched one of those Wii Play things.
1521749	1525770	It was with the Machinima, I think they do that.
1526190	1532052	And it was a bunch of people playing a survival type game where...
1532532	1533113	Thanks for watching!
1551388	1552708	And that was really hilarious.
1552728	1554549	This is like the Minecraft Hunger Games.
1554789	1555909	No, they have that.
1555949	1556729	They have that too.
1557570	1559270	But this is like, it was sort of like that.
1559690	1560630	But that looked like fun.
1560710	1563231	See, more of the structured stuff with like a lot of people.
1564071	1565831	Sounds like a lot of fun with Minecraft.
1566132	1571293	In fact, when we first started playing, it was like you, me and Bobby, and then like other people joining in.
1572193	1573314	Thanks for watching!
1589670	1598292	Ironically, though, I did also check out another Minecraft-esque game because it was cheap and it was featured in an article I read.
1599773	1605474	It was Castle Builder Z. Castle Builder Z is on the Xbox Live Indie Games.
1606034	1613636	It is only $1, 80 Microsoft points, so worth checking out for that kind of amount of money.
1614216	1619058	It's like Minecraft with your avatars, with really crappy looking graphics.
1619258	1625960	I mean, even crappier than... I was like, Minecraft isn't exactly known for its graphical finesse.
1626380	1628481	It's like they made their own textures.
1628601	1631022	It looks like a bad texture pack on Minecraft.
1632062	1635664	But you have guns, and you can craft weapons and stuff like that.
1636824	1638725	And it's zombies.
1639005	1641026	Would guns make you more interested in Minecraft?
1641846	1642226	Maybe.
1642246	1642346	Maybe.
1643534	1644715	And there's zombies.
1644795	1650038	Yeah, I understand there's zombies normally in Minecraft, but these aren't the zombies that are in the regular Minecraft.
1650078	1655562	These are like, I'm going to run at you at full speed and jump in the air and try to kill you zombies.
1657603	1659764	And there's a dragon that tries to kill you as well.
1660545	1661966	Pretty much the whole game is like...
1662666	1665968	Very, very... It's not... I don't know.
1665988	1666809	It's kind of scary.
1666869	1674655	I mean, the ambience, the sound that they have in there kind of sounds like one of those Halloween tapes or CDs and stuff with all the Halloween spooky sounds.
1675275	1676116	But that's pretty much it.
1676296	1676876	It's just like...
1678337	1689759	I ended up barricading myself into a cave or something because the first time out, I was like, okay, crap, this looks like night all the time.
1689979	1693660	I mean, when it's daytime, it's gloomy and lightning outside.
1693740	1697721	And when it's nighttime, it's dark, but there's tons of shit running at you.
1698661	1702702	And so the first time I made the mistake of, oh, I forgot to get wood.
1703602	1703942	Crap.
1704803	1706143	So I'm waiting in there.
1706183	1710165	I'm like, okay, I better go outside and go try to punch a tree real quick and get some wood.
1710545	1711545	Go punch a tree.
1711866	1712726	Only in Minecraft.
1712786	1717108	So I did that, and then all of a sudden I get bum-rushed by a bunch of fucking zombies.
1717128	1718448	I don't even know what they were.
1718468	1724891	Just something that was snarling and sounding like a tiger or something, but it looked like some sort of monster thing that ran at me.
1725371	1731154	So I started firing a pistol at it, and that didn't really do anything because I got rushed from a few other sides at the same time.
1731534	1732616	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1747454	1773008	Anyways, so I finally got it to where I'm like in a cave now and I've mined some stuff and you start building weapons because you don't really have a whole lot you can build in it because it is kind of a knockoff of Minecraft but you don't have like beds, you can't sleep or anything and then there's, it always sounds like there's monsters trying to dig their way into your tunnel and sometimes they somehow manage to get in there and I think on higher difficulties they can dig through the tunnel and get to you.
1773248	1774288	Thanks for watching!
1790913	1793994	It's pretty, I think it'd be kind of interesting to check it out.
1794014	1797155	But yeah, 80 Microsoft points, I mean, it's a buck, come on.
1797375	1798535	Just try it.
1798575	1801756	If you want to try it, if you play Minecraft, it's kind of fun.
1802697	1804777	You'll get a dollar's worth of entertainment out of it.
1804837	1806918	And in general, don't forget about indie games.
1807739	1809060	Don't forget about Xbox Indie Game.
1809080	1810362	There's a lot of fun stuff on there.
1810502	1810963	It's not bad.
1811003	1812925	I mean, Castle Miner was one of those series.
1812985	1821276	It was one of, like, two or three series that were on Indie Games that were kind of mimicking Minecraft for a long time before Minecraft came out.
1821316	1823559	And they still do, and they still sell all right, but...
1825161	1839773	They're fun in their own right, and it's four-player co-op, and you can play online and stuff like that, so it's worth it for like... I mean, come on, you probably have 80 Microsoft points sitting in your account that's just... Yeah, leftover from Rock Band purchases or something.
1839793	1841815	Yeah, or something like that, so definitely worth checking out.
1841835	1845177	I mean, there's tons of indie games on there that are worth checking out, but it was kind of fun.
1845477	1848540	All right, well, if you're done with your gaming week, I'll do mine real quick.
1849517	1850738	Not a lot of new stuff this week.
1850758	1854801	A lot of the stuff from last week, like Sound Shapes and World of Warcraft and so forth.
1854821	1856362	But I did play two new games.
1856942	1858263	One of them's a little herpy derpy.
1858303	1859564	I'll talk about this real quick.
1859604	1860564	It's an iOS game.
1860584	1862386	I've been playing it mostly on my iPad.
1862426	1868009	It's called Puzzle Craft, which might make you think it's Minecraft, but like puzzle, but it's not.
1868170	1869250	It's actually nothing like that.
1869671	1872172	It's one of those free to, well, no, it's not even free to play.
1872212	1873193	It's 99 cents.
1873293	1878116	But then of course they charge you for all these upgrades in the game, like extra coins and stuff.
1878136	1879137	You don't really have to do it.
1879697	1908124	um the crux of the game is that you're building this town and you get all the materials to either get food or get materials to build things in your town in this whole little match game where you like they call it match three in the description but it's not bejeweled at all it's like trace the consecutive line of like all the little pieces of grain in the puzzle like try to trace it and then they all disappear and new stuff falls and kind of goes like that over and over and
1908564	1912866	It's one of those things that's just like so stupid that I'm playing this, but it's addicting.
1912926	1913727	It's cute.
1913847	1916868	And you have this little town of villagers, and some of them wear chicken outfits.
1916948	1917549	It's really cute.
1917609	1918649	So whatever.
1919450	1919870	There's that.
1920390	1925953	The other game I've been playing a little bit, just a little bit because it just came out today, is New Super Mario Bros.
1926293	1927154	2 on the 3DS.
1927994	1929235	I did pick that up today.
1930135	1932196	Well, it just came out today, so I haven't had a lot of time to play it.
1932256	1933637	So I can't give it a full review yet.
1933977	1936942	I'll post something more in depth on VOGnetwork.com later this week.
1937022	1937503	Plug, plug.
1937523	1940087	But how similar is its new Super Mario Brothers?
1940929	1945516	Um, it's pretty much the same damn game, but is that such a bad thing?
1946678	1946919	Well...
1947794	1954740	No, but at the same time, it kind of feels a little bit like they didn't put a lot of effort into it, if it's pretty similar.
1954900	1957102	Well, I mean, there are some new stuff.
1957262	1958323	I mean, especially with this one.
1958603	1964028	I kind of think the whole, like, Mario's after coins, I think it's a little bit corny.
1964388	1965830	But some of the power-ups are neat.
1965870	1967651	Like, I love the one that turns you into giant.
1967671	1969173	Although, I guess that was in the previous games, too.
1969253	1970514	But I was like, ooh, giant Mario.
1971594	1989084	and then you know the ones that have the gold coins where you can kick and it leaves like a trail of coins and the fireball that makes all the blocks turn into coins it was kind of neat and it really where the game shines as it usually does is level design I've played a lot of really well designed levels
1990899	1992500	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2011758	2039150	and you'll find yourself in the world mushroom world or whatever which is kind of like I guess like the secret world and the stages get a little harder but like one of them was like really neat design because the way the blocks were you had to figure out like how you could fall through the blocks to get all the coins it's kind of hard for me to explain without like showing you a visual but just like the way the blocks were it looked like one solid block but it's got all these lines in it so you had to I don't know
2040590	2042712	3D doesn't really add anything to the game, but that's okay.
2042992	2046275	I'm totally okay with 3DS games not whoring the crap out of 3D.
2046675	2050839	If you want the 3D stuff, go play Mario 3D Land, which did it very well.
2051879	2053761	But yeah, I liked it so far.
2056763	2074818	I'll probably play it to completion and it's got some interesting street pass things where you can play a sequence of three random stages and try to get as many coins as possible and then you street pass to somebody else and you get their record so you can try to play the same three stages they did even though it was randomized.
2075198	2081503	So it's kind of like, I don't know, kind of has that Mario Kart-esque competitive element which wasn't in any other Mario game so far.
2081924	2082904	So that is something new.
2083205	2083765	I'll give it that.
2084125	2084826	Kind of a little different.
2085326	2087127	I will get into this in the show a little later.
2087167	2091671	They're promising the DLC will be worth it, essentially.
2092031	2096694	So I'm curious about that because, again, level design is where these games tend to shine.
2097935	2102238	Well, that's all they really need to do since the engine was done a few times.
2102538	2105220	Yeah, I mean, I'll be honest in that regard.
2105260	2113185	If I'm going to razz the game, it's that it's really the first Mario game I've played in a long time where I go, this really isn't original.
2113205	2113706	Yeah.
2114326	2139772	which I know is weird because Mario games are essentially all the same mechanic but think about it you know in the original Super Mario Bros and then there's Mario Bros 2 it's like holy shit this is totally different and then Mario Bros 3 kind of went back more towards the first one but you know if it ain't fixed don't break it Mario World was like completely Yoshi and all this then Mario 64 oh my god 3D Mario Galaxy oh my god the planets and everything is just different this is the first one in a long time I've played where I'm like
2140182	2140923	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2161460	2162281	Just straight up bad.
2162621	2165284	I don't even think Mario Sunshine, you could say, was a bad game.
2165845	2168848	I still think Mario Sunshine was great.
2168868	2169428	I love Mario Sunshine.
2170209	2173973	I mean, yes, it's a formula, but it's a solid fucking formula.
2174433	2174874	Go with it.
2176343	2176763	There you go.
2177944	2178964	I should go to the chat room.
2179604	2182585	Live.VogNetwork.com Let's see.
2182626	2186347	Shayna Link goes in chat saying, I'm at a bit over 30k coins so far.
2186447	2187948	It gives me incentive to keep playing.
2188268	2192790	Yeah, the back of the box says something about getting a million coins and I guess you get something special.
2192990	2193350	I don't know.
2193730	2195971	It's probably just all the levels backwards or something.
2196931	2199132	WhatUpG says the Raccoon power-up is back.
2199192	2199812	That is true.
2200352	2206673	It's not Tanooki Mario anymore like it was in the Wii one or the last... No, the Mario 3D Land of the Doogie.
2206713	2210494	It's just straight-up Raccoon Mario just like you remember it in Mario 3.
2210914	2214575	In fact, there's a lot here that's just like you remember it in Mario 3.
2215635	2217295	Like, you go to World 2.
2217775	2218876	It's a desert world.
2218936	2219596	What a shock.
2220476	2222657	It's kind of a lot of the same formula.
2222677	2224819	Well, it is the third new Super Mario Bros.
2224879	2227240	game, so maybe it's new Super Mario Bros.
2227440	2228581	Maybe it's not that new.
2228861	2232743	They should just call it Well-Polished Mario Bros.
2232763	2232743	2.
2232863	2234024	Isn't that a little something?
2234464	2240788	It's like, really, you couldn't have come up with a better name for the series other than, yeah, it's a new Super Mario Bros.
2240848	2241088	game.
2241849	2243229	Interesting point from Dark Tetsuya.
2243809	2251751	Ironically, Mario 2's original version, meaning the Japanese version, Lost Levels here, right, wasn't too different from Super Mario Bros.
2252131	2251751	1.
2252432	2256373	Just the level layouts and some of the little things they added cranked up the difficulty.
2256633	2257673	That's a great comparison.
2258073	2262774	You know, Lost Levels or Mario 2 in Japan really wasn't that different from Mario 1.
2263194	2266595	Different graphics, a little different mechanic with Luigi's jumping.
2266974	2270737	Well, and Mario 2 that we got wasn't even a Mario game originally.
2271177	2272358	Right, but I'm not talking about that.
2272398	2273940	I'm not talking about that whole thing.
2274060	2278523	But I mean, where they say, oh, how innovative, how different, it wasn't even a Mario game.
2278904	2279444	True, true.
2279744	2282927	But I mean, go back to the Lost Levels or Japanese 2 and 1.
2283527	2286090	That's a very... I mean, I don't think Lost Levels is a bad game.
2286330	2288391	It's a really... It's a challenging-ass Mario game.
2288411	2289092	It's an asshole game.
2289312	2289672	It is.
2290533	2294136	And there's some asshole stages in this that I've played so far when you get into those special worlds.
2294336	2294496	So...
2296741	2300190	Let's see, Tigerclaw says the next version would be New New Super Mario Bros.
2303846	2304607	Very new.
2305487	2306188	Mario Bros.
2306208	2306188	2015.
2306348	2312832	Well, it could be a band-themed one because new Super Mario Bros.
2313192	2313272	U2.
2313552	2316974	Oh yeah, WhatUpG reminds us Mario 2 had the poison mushrooms.
2317014	2317715	That was a little different too.
2317955	2321918	Okay, but here's the one tiny concern I have.
2322818	2327661	If I'm already looking at this game going, all right, it's cool, but it's not that original.
2327701	2329662	It's not as original as Nintendo wants you to think it is.
2330183	2330383	Hmm.
2330603	2334425	But what's going to happen when that Wii U Mario game comes out?
2334525	2338146	Because these games are not coming out with a lot of time apart between them.
2338527	2340888	What's that Wii U Mario going to bring to the table?
2341588	2343429	Isn't that going to be the same damn thing again?
2343889	2352413	It's the same thing, but now with the gimmick that, hey, look, a fifth person, because I don't know about you, but I always have about five people in my living room wanting to play the Wii.
2352973	2354514	Oh, wait, no one wants to play the Wii.
2354954	2360096	Okay, so five people supposedly in this room playing the Wii U, and one person is going to be like, hi!
2360316	2361938	I'm moving the platforms!
2363959	2365821	Look, I'm contributing!
2366001	2368884	It's almost like that dumb person that you have in your room.
2368964	2370145	It's like, you know what?
2370666	2372868	Billy's not going to play the game because he's too stupid.
2372908	2373929	He's going to keep dying.
2373969	2376471	So we're going to let him move the platforms up and down.
2377332	2378753	Because that's all he can handle.
2379474	2382056	So five people to play this to its full potential.
2382076	2384458	This game's going to sell like crazy in Utah.
2384698	2385139	Go figure.
2386605	2403855	So it's just, I, if someone even made, I had to laugh, because there was a comment, it was a developer, actually, that was trying stuff on the Wii U, and they were saying, all Nintendo's trying to do is sell a TV-sized DS.
2403915	2406876	I'm like, we've been, he's all, why isn't anybody in the games press saying that?
2406896	2409097	I'm like, we've been fucking saying that for months.
2409458	2411779	That's all the Wii U's gonna be is just a giant DS.
2412139	2413100	DS.
2413761	2424815	Basically, the Wii U gamepad works well at a demo kiosk, but when you actually back it away from the TV, then you have to constantly look down at your controller and stuff like that.
2425536	2427278	It just doesn't really flow well.
2427798	2434521	Alpha Kanatagram in our chatroom says, Sky, it's going to bring in H fucking D. Okay, I can respect that and all.
2435301	2437582	Mario and HD will be fine and all, but let's be real.
2438022	2440583	New Super Mario Brothers is not the game I want to see in HD.
2441163	2443985	F fucking Zero is the game I want to see in HD.
2444125	2444545	Hello?
2446285	2450107	or even a new 3D Mario game would be pretty awesome.
2450127	2452868	That's not exactly the greatest starting point.
2452928	2454608	Or a Metroid Prime in HD.
2454648	2458549	Can you imagine a Super Mario World-esque game in 3D?
2459270	2462551	Kind of like Zelda-ish big adventure type game?
2462871	2463991	That would be fucking awesome.
2464451	2465872	Not new Super Mario Bros.
2467052	2469435	All right, last comment from chat, and then we're going to move on with the show.
2469496	2470156	TigerClaw says,
2485436	2487558	But that's okay.
2487578	2488439	I want to point this out.
2488800	2492764	Not every 3DS game has to whore the 3D like crazy.
2492824	2495047	I think this is a good thing.
2495267	2497549	The 3D is subtle and is not a game changer.
2497890	2503936	If you want a game that whores the 3D but does it very, very, very well, go play the Mario 3D Land because that was...
2504657	2513625	An original Mario game, despite the fact that it certainly has a lot in common with Mario 64 and all that, because the 3D brought some awesome elements into it.
2513725	2518929	That game felt very original, despite the fact it was a formula at the end of the day.
2519530	2520391	So, go figure.
2521508	2527193	Maybe, maybe sitting next to Mario 3D Land, this game feels a little bit like a step backwards.
2527694	2528034	I don't know.
2528054	2529456	That sounds like a very harsh thing to say.
2529476	2530997	It makes it sound like I don't like the game or something.
2531017	2531938	No, I think it's about right.
2531978	2532418	But, you know.
2532879	2536382	Because 3D Land was actually pretty innovative and it was a pretty awesome game.
2537123	2537203	Um...
2538624	2552852	I don't know, New Super Mario Bros., the first one was a pretty awesome game, but it's just, you've done it now three times, and you're gonna do it again one more time, and you haven't really changed it up that much.
2553172	2561837	I mean, it's basically, like, because even before, it was like, hey, look, we created this tech demo of the Miis running around in, like, this New Super Mario Bros.
2561857	2564499	thing, and that was the Wii U tech demo, and I'm like...
2565439	2566919	That's just new Super Mario Bros.
2567099	2569540	But they have, you know, it was just a tech demo.
2569780	2570720	And then guess what they did?
2571000	2572780	Because they did this with all their fucking tech demos.
2572800	2574001	They turned it into a game.
2574721	2577541	It's like, oh my fucking god, you didn't do anything.
2577641	2584562	You just have four people running around in this game just like you can on the Wii version.
2585283	2588283	Oh, but there's a fifth person that can do shit for some reason.
2588603	2593224	I'll probably still get a Wii U. I got problems.
2594542	2595363	I got problems.
2595403	2596404	Don't get it at launch.
2596824	2597265	We'll see.
2597925	2598345	We'll see.
2599166	2601608	There's nothing coming... There's nothing.
2601648	2605232	Despite everything I'm saying, despite... Look, I'm just gonna admit it.
2605572	2611217	Despite everything I'm saying here and now about originality and all that, the first time I play that new Super Mario Bros.
2611918	2614140	Wii U or whatever in HD, I'm gonna be like...
2615060	2626137	I want it, and I'll have it, because I want it I'm not planning on buying one, I don't need that system, I don't play the Wii enough, I'm, no
2628012	2630674	All right, let's move on with some gaming news.
2630934	2631795	Oh, wait, housekeeping.
2632636	2638420	Visit us at twitter.com slash OLR or on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2638781	2646987	And, of course, visit our network that we are affiliated with and tape live at, the Voice of Geeks Network or vognetwork.com.
2647507	2649929	I wrote a review of Sound Shapes, so you can check out that's there.
2650029	2654453	And there's some other – a book review went up last week of Stargate by the guy from Critical Myths.
2655114	2656576	and lots of good stuff on the site.
2656616	2659421	So check that out, vognetwork.com.
2659922	2661124	Let's get into some gaming news.
2661725	2665592	Loki, just, I guess, tons of Sony shit coming out of Gamescom.
2665632	2666333	Well, there's tons of stuff.
2666353	2668356	You posted like 20 stories and I'm like, you know what?
2669059	2669839	Just do them all.
2669899	2670620	Let's do them all.
2671420	2672361	All kind of tied to each other.
2672641	2674902	Well, some non-Sony stuff real quick.
2675002	2677704	There was a game that Capcom kind of brought out of nowhere.
2678024	2682006	They're calling it kind of the game of Gamescom.
2682106	2685068	It was Remember Me, which was kind of cool.
2685108	2687869	It had a little bit of like you hack into people's memories.
2689090	2693813	I always think of that fucking terrible movie with Robert Pattinson that had that twist ending.
2694093	2694613	You remember that?
2694653	2695614	It was called Remember Me?
2722276	2723597	Puppeteer Sony Online Entertainment
2743857	2765348	and it's very it reminded me of um like Clockwork Knight if you remember that from the Sega Saturn at least that's what it reminded me of but it was a very unique looking game like kind of a platformer with this like puppet looking animation to different things but it's pretty cool so they have that come out
2766448	2770549	Another game they had was Rain, which kind of reminded me a little bit of Limbo.
2771749	2775910	Or even that one game, A Lost in Shadow, that came out from Konami.
2776310	2786153	It's basically a PlayStation Network game that's going to be coming out that features these invisible... Like an invisible boy who can only be seen in rain.
2787233	2791134	So you're wandering around this environment and stuff and solving puzzles based on...
2792774	2796797	and this kind of invisible character, which is kind of neat.
2797117	2805082	And then, I don't know what I should think about this one, but Until Dawn, it's going to be a teen horror movie style game that utilizes the move.
2805302	2807243	That actually sounds kind of awesome.
2807723	2810385	I hope this is Night Trap bad.
2811606	2812566	That would be awesome.
2813427	2819010	I think the industry needs a good game like... Except without the annoying parts of Night Trap, like watching the monitors.
2819110	2819811	Yeah, it needs...
2820031	2820532	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2837288	2839410	and then one other thing.
2839450	2847017	They showed off Wonder Book again and I've got to say this presentation of Wonder Book was way better than the one that they did at E3.
2847277	2861771	It was shorter and they showed some new stuff including not only are they going to have the whole Book of Spells thing which looked okay in the new trailer but they have this new they got a licensing with BBC's Walking with Dinosaurs which looks pretty awesome and
2862371	2868515	and Diggs Nightcrawler which is kind of a noir fairy tale type game.
2868615	2873559	You play this worm who's a detective solving fairy tale crimes kind of.
2873959	2875580	Sounds almost like it could be a book.
2875600	2880403	I think it might even be a book series but those will be coming out later on.
2880944	2884786	I think right now Wonder Book is launching with books of spells and that's it.
2884946	2890150	Wait, so does this mean you have come full circle and you are a fan of Wonder Book now?
2890230	2891130	I'm not a fan of it, no.
2892451	2920642	it looks interesting for people that might be into that stuff like I was thinking for the accounts I deal with like I deal with library chain or you know the old libraries in the US and obviously this type of stuff would be good for them or people that sell books but no for me personally no you know what's making a comeback though that ain't got or that Wonderbook ain't got shit on you know what you know what's making a huge comeback brace yourself for it
2925775	2926556	Hell yeah.
2926636	2931060	Fucking Reading Rainbow is back.
2931080	2932282	Seriously?
2932322	2935004	Yeah, I think it's like an iOS type thing now.
2935024	2940430	They're making apps out of it where it's not like a show, but it's like LeVar Burton pimping books.
2941310	2957166	Better how LeVar Burton associated with it Like, okay, here's the thing Imagine if Wonderbook instead had been called Reading Rainbow We would all be losing our shit over it All they had to do was get LeVar Burton out on stage going It's the shit, guys We would have been like, take my money!
2957626	2957927	Take it!
2958347	2958647	Take it!
2959928	2961070	I love the intro to this show
2964557	2965818	I love that old logo too.
2966959	2968281	It's so 80s and gorgeous.
2968921	2974006	The only thing that pissed me off about reading Rainbow is that the books were always checked out at the library.
2974127	2976049	You tried to go find the books, they were always gone.
2976069	2976949	Not at my library.
2977370	2981134	No one in Alabama reads.
2982275	2983616	Some other cool stuff.
2984537	2988421	Before all that, they were showing Media Molecule's new game and
2990282	2991342	It's just fantastic.
2991462	2992743	It's a game called Tearaway.
2993183	2994904	It's on the Vita.
2994984	2997345	Basically, the whole world looks like paper.
2997665	2999485	A lot of the stuff you can do in there.
2999826	3001626	You can actually interact with the game.
3001646	3004227	You can push your finger up on the back of the touch panel.
3004988	3009049	You'll actually see your finger coming through the screen, which is kind of weird.
3013311	3014871	You can literally finger your Vita.
3015151	3016612	You can literally finger your Vita.
3017907	3026474	Yes, but it's going to utilize the camera in different motion-based stuff, and it looks fantastic because it's medium molecule.
3026514	3027135	I mean, come on.
3029216	3029617	I'm sorry.
3029657	3033760	I'm just so glad the Vita's finally found a use for that back touchpad.
3034921	3037183	Now you can watch your finger go up the Vita.
3038244	3038384	Yep.
3039771	3040391	Yep, you can.
3041592	3045613	They showed off Killzone Mercenary, which is going to be a new first-person shooter on the Vita.
3046213	3046913	It looked kind of cool.
3047494	3061118	They also showed Call of Duty Black Ops Declassified, which I was very interested in picking it up until I realized that it's the guys that made the last Resistance game, Burning Skies, and that game sucked.
3061318	3063839	So probably not going to pick up this Call of Duty game.
3064275	3066096	Can we go back to the fingering thing for a minute?
3067036	3071979	A sitting vampire in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Someone's going to put their dick on it.
3072219	3075701	So what would happen if you put something besides it?
3076001	3077442	Stances like someone hasn't already.
3078302	3081604	What would happen if you put something else on the back touchpad?
3081624	3082124	Here's the thing.
3082744	3087487	I don't really understand how it works because they're going to have... It actually is an image of your finger.
3087507	3088807	It utilizes the camera.
3089027	3089928	It captures that.
3089968	3093930	So yes, you would see a penis coming up through the back of the screen.
3094290	3096591	If you were somehow... Or would your penis turn into a finger?
3097112	3097752	I don't know.
3099393	3102055	Well, I'm assuming it's not... That's a really big finger.
3102075	3104256	I don't know, for some people, maybe a really small finger.
3104276	3104956	Is that your thumb?
3105136	3111540	Don't you... Because there's no way for the camera to capture the image of your finger, you know, on that back touch panel.
3111600	3116963	It just doesn't... It's out of the scope of the lens, but... I don't know.
3117203	3121346	I mean, unless they have you capture your finger, but I think that... Yes.
3121406	3123307	Why does your finger look like a sea cucumber?
3125663	3127424	This is one of the great mysteries.
3130145	3132946	What will happen when you put your dick on the rear touchpad?
3137668	3140869	Find out on the next OLR.
3141469	3142210	You'll make a mess.
3147932	3149693	I don't want to have that trade-in system.
3151353	3152934	Yeah, I played a lot of Tearaway.
3154494	3159458	Alone at Night.
3159618	3160539	Moving on.
3160559	3171988	Speaking of innuendos, I guess, Ratchet & Clank Full Frontal Assault is coming to the Vita as well.
3173670	3174931	You did that on purpose.
3178273	3178914	Rob's red.
3181336	3182357	Full Frontal Assault.
3182898	3186900	Yeah, not only will it be a full frontal assault on the Vita, but also on your PS3.
3187220	3195685	And it's going to be one of these games that utilizes this brand new thing they announced, which is the PlayStation Cross Buy, which is awesome.
3195745	3200868	Cross Buy, basically, you purchase a game on the PS3, you get the Vita version for free.
3201708	3203009	Fuck yeah, that's the way you do it.
3203509	3205591	This is a great trend that SoundShape started.
3206611	3207092	Exactly.
3207892	3209273	Another game that's going to feature that?
3209313	3213336	I hope, though, because this was a good point that came up when Bobby was talking about this earlier on his show.
3213836	3215417	I want it to not just be digital.
3215517	3218739	That's my concern, is that that would only be the deal if you get it digitally.
3218779	3219900	It's going to be digital, I thought.
3219920	3221821	Oh, but I'm running out of room on the PS3.
3221901	3224743	Oh, you've got to buy a bigger memory card.
3224963	3229506	That's the trick, is that those stinking Vita memory cards are so expensive.
3229527	3230687	They're not that expensive.
3230867	3232108	But did they come down in price finally?
3232128	3235450	Well, when they released, the prices of those aren't that expensive.
3235510	3236091	I thought it was.
3236471	3236652	No.
3238234	3241880	Another game that's going to support that as well is going to be PlayStation All-Stars.
3242200	3244964	JV Mon reminds us in chat, play Pinball Arcade on the Vita.
3245145	3245605	Does that too?
3246507	3247428	I have it on my phone.
3248189	3248690	On my phone.
3248710	3249311	I don't need a Vita.
3251993	3255775	Also, another game that's going to support that, LittleBigPlanet.
3255835	3258196	The DLC is also cross-platform.
3258256	3265920	So if you buy any DLC you have now for LittleBigPlanet 1 and 2, we'll work with LittleBigPlanet Vita and LittleBigPlanet Carding.
3266520	3267401	So that's kind of cool.
3267661	3268101	That's awesome.
3268381	3269181	Yeah.
3269221	3271442	LittleBigPlanet Carding, I hope, is one of those games too.
3271502	3273423	I think it is one of the cross-buying games.
3273703	3274544	So that's pretty sweet.
3275124	3278950	and then PlayStation Plus coming to the Vita as well.
3279190	3281393	And they're upping the cloud storage to one gigabyte.
3281994	3283876	So that's pretty sweet.
3284017	3290045	Also announced that I guess Europe is going to be getting Red Dead Redemption free in September.
3290525	3291287	So that's pretty sweet.
3292887	3295188	and then also PlayStation Mobile.
3295208	3302829	They talked a little bit about that and talked about some of the launch games and there was a big old trailer on there and one of the things I saw I remember was Lemmings.
3302869	3304069	I'm like, holy shit, Lemmings!
3304850	3306250	But that's going to be one of the games.
3306930	3320233	Also, they mentioned that PlayStation Mobile will be compatible with Sony Xperia phones, also Vitas, and then they revealed that the Asus and Wikipad tablets are going to be getting...
3321953	3323055	and PlayStation Mobile as well.
3323075	3326498	They're going to be adding stuff or different devices to that as well.
3328300	3328901	That's pretty cool.
3329541	3330102	That's everything.
3330763	3332504	That's a lot of news coming out of Gamescom.
3332685	3335267	But that makes sense because Sony has a pretty big presence in Europe.
3335287	3338331	They've always done pretty well there ever since the original PlayStation.
3338371	3339492	So it's kind of exciting.
3339812	3342555	And then I'm assuming there'll be even more Tokyo Game Show, right?
3343236	3343656	Probably.
3343836	3344397	That's pretty cool.
3346098	3362579	I'm really excited about the whole Vita, Playstation 3 crossover I'm glad that I'll be able to do something with my Vita I'm telling you, Sound Shapes is a great They should be pushing it more It's a great holdover game until they get some more stuff
3363208	3391686	I wonder if that Final Fantasy X remake is going to be buy one get both because they were pimping it for both systems well it's right now it's been first party that's been doing that oh yeah yeah technically it's a that would be pretty cool I mean that might get me to buy the PS3 version of Black Ops 2 maybe if you know it was like that although like I said Black Ops declassified the fact that it's being done by the guys that did Resistance Burning Skies and the trailer just didn't look that great I was just
3392426	3394487	Uh, made me sad.
3412532	3414454	Get the red one, put a Charmander sticker on it.
3432908	3441573	My big concern about getting one of these right now is that, again, I think I mentioned this last week, they'll just turn around and release a really beautiful color like that purple.
3441673	3444014	That purple 3DS is so gorgeous.
3444054	3446656	I wish that had been the launch color.
3446676	3449357	They would have never had to do another color because that purple one is so great.
3450818	3452219	I'm curious about the XL.
3452259	3459163	I've heard it's a good system, but at the same time, do I want to pay $200 for a new one when I already have one?
3459503	3460964	I don't think I can justify that really.
3461664	3462205	So we'll see.
3463065	3463526	But it's out.
3464126	3464547	DarkSakura.
3465628	3469431	Well, we do have some news on the corporate front.
3469672	3471754	I'll put it in those words.
3472334	3473215	Who remembers OnLive?
3475277	3480181	I remember their big booth at E3, and nobody thought OnLive was going to work.
3480262	3482704	And then they showed up at E3, and they were like, this works.
3483104	3484906	And everybody's like, holy shit, it does work.
3486357	3493122	Well, right now, there was something going around about a sort of bankruptcy going on.
3493582	3498666	And honestly, this article is really hard to read because all the text is crossed over and the HTML is screwed up.
3498886	3501467	Well, there was so much back and forth on this this week.
3501848	3504590	Nobody really has a clear understanding of what's going on.
3504610	3506231	Literally, the coding on this is awful.
3507211	3507572	Just saying.
3508292	3514339	So anyway, basically they were saying that there was an acquisition of their assets by a company as a sale.
3514900	3518244	Instead, it has to do with bankruptcy protection.
3518724	3523830	They have, I believe, been acquired, but in kind of a different deal.
3524671	3525853	Well, you know what's different about it?
3526033	3526774	They won't say who.
3527054	3528375	Yeah, that's the big thing.
3528896	3529677	Isn't that weird?
3529797	3532981	It sounded to me that they created their own company.
3533101	3534242	Like they created another company.
3534262	3537706	We're going to call this On Live 2.
3538527	3539028	Let her finish.
3539108	3539488	Let her finish.
3539548	3540530	I want to get into this a little bit.
3540550	3540890	Well, here's what...
3541130	3555442	What the official quote is, like, we can now confirm the assets of OnLive Incorporated have been acquired into a newly formed company and is backed by substantial funding and will continue to operate the online game and desktop service, blah, blah, blah, etc., etc.
3556603	3565351	They are releasing the OnLive employees and I think have put out a call to rehire them with the new company.
3565951	3580724	which I mean basically how this worked with the company that I worked for before when we were sold is that yeah we were released from the previous corporation but we were hired quote by the new company as and we know with all of our tenure and everything intact
3581444	3603952	so I think that what it's looking like is either they have fully released them or they are sending the note out there that yeah we want you here we want to keep you around you know just maybe trying to get them to reapply through different hiring channels or something I mean maybe they want to bring them all and see you know if they're loyal to the product I don't know
3605046	3605427	Thanks for watching!
3620990	3623152	They've yet to really say anything officially.
3623492	3629757	And it was at the point where people were reporting, yeah, we drove down to the online offices and we see people are walking out of here with boxes and all this stuff.
3630118	3633420	So clearly the company's not going to hire some people back.
3633500	3636002	And I think everything's just in this big state of flux right now.
3637143	3643549	And it's never good news when people lose their jobs in the gaming industry.
3643569	3645130	And this is always tough to talk about.
3645650	3648633	But I do have to ask the hard question.
3650328	3657915	on live, kind of, I mean, as a service, it was bringing a lot of great things to the table, but the one thing that was really missing was, like, games.
3658796	3665402	Like, a lot of the games that it launched with, when launching is your first impression, were years old, and kind of old news.
3665563	3671568	And sure, they tried to add to that, and they did some cool things with the service, like the replays and some of that other stuff they were doing.
3671608	3671869	Like, they...
3672449	3676194	and the TV top systems and all that they were doing.
3676435	3680080	They had some great ideas, but it's like they just didn't have the games to back it up.
3680640	3682823	They didn't have the deals to back it up like Steam did.
3683164	3688091	The coolest thing they had going for it were the hour-long demos that you didn't really have to download anything.
3688111	3689413	You just did it through the cloud.
3690253	3694055	They weren't really getting exclusives.
3694555	3695335	It was tricky.
3696116	3698217	I can see where the company is hurting.
3699457	3706020	I think the report had come out that only several thousand people out of the millions that had signed up were only ever on the service at any one time.
3707020	3709842	1,600 and they had 8,000 servers.
3710002	3712963	That was a lot of unused servers that had to be maintained.
3715577	3721020	I'm just really... I mean, they clearly... Someone believes in the product.
3722020	3728343	I just want to... Well, look at... Sony bought their biggest competitor, Gaikai, which was a very similar sort of thing.
3728864	3735007	But Gaikai was kind of doing... They had the whole stuff in the browsers and they were getting some deals where the demos were streamed to them.
3735027	3737208	They were kind of trying to push the envelope a little more.
3737828	3739169	And now Sony acquired them.
3739609	3739769	Yeah.
3741001	3747625	Here's the other thing that kind of sucks, too, is basically some of the people were offered consulting arrangements.
3747685	3758490	Also, they said that they asked some of the employees to help smooth the transition to the new startup, and those people were offered stock options in the new company.
3758951	3770357	However, those stocks are basically worthless unless the company at some point becomes profitable and basically gets sold or goes public.
3770917	3780139	So, you get an IOU, maybe we'll fulfill that money if we, you know, are successful.
3780800	3785461	Well, best of luck to the folks that find themselves displaced this week with the whole on live stuff.
3785701	3791883	I hope they're able to land work quickly somewhere else as we usually feel in these types of situations.
3792643	3793223	So, all right.
3794423	3798244	Anyhow, if that's it, let's move on.
3798284	3807067	Speaking of other cloud services, GameStop, they have a cloud streaming service that's going to be coming to PCs, tablets, and internet TVs.
3809047	3814609	Of course, you may remember that they acquired Spawn Labs and Impulse last year.
3816329	3822211	Basically, it's based on consumer feedback, our success in selling mobile devices and imminent launch of new
3822791	3823753	Thank you for watching!
3837834	3843419	Probably because I would be willing to bet that those other companies have their own streaming ideas in place.
3843799	3844760	Like we know Sony does.
3844780	3846201	Clearly Sony does, right?
3846281	3849584	So maybe Microsoft's kind of going that similar route.
3849664	3853747	So it's not that, yes, we're not going to put our stuff on those consoles.
3853948	3858772	More like those console developers don't want us to put our stuff on their consoles.
3860553	3876288	you know one of the first rumors I read was that Microsoft bought OnLive which would seem like a no it's just that's not what happened you know because sometimes Microsoft buys companies but I think in this case they'll try to just reinvent it and make it better and put their own name on it you know what I mean
3876789	3881951	Yeah, I don't think... And if it was bought by Microsoft, they'd be more... More open about it.
3882051	3882932	Fair about it.
3883112	3884252	We're going to lay everybody off.
3884553	3887854	But that was one of the first early... You know how Twitter goes.
3889015	3891996	Everybody's a skeptic and everybody's an analyst.
3892936	3894057	Yeah.
3895760	3905886	So yeah, they're saying, I guess GameStop had proposed a scenario before where they were saying that users would need to own a retail copy of a particular game they wish to stream from cloud.
3906366	3913691	Although now that's not necessarily going to be the case because if it's not going to tie into consoles, then what are they going to own?
3914191	3915352	So, I don't know.
3915512	3919194	It's an interesting idea and I know how they're selling their own tablets and stuff, but
3920677	3923039	It seems like it's such a crowded market space out there.
3923059	3932867	I mean, I know you can trade in games for these tablets and phones and stuff, but why would I want to buy, why would I want to stream games from them?
3932927	3937110	That just doesn't, I don't know, it just doesn't seem appealing to me at all.
3940115	3946341	I like the idea of being able to stream demos and things like that without having to download... Like that whole Secret World.
3946501	3947622	I talked about that a couple weeks ago.
3947662	3949524	This MMO that I tried out, the Secret World.
3949825	3954810	I had to download a 15 gig thing to try that just to figure out that, you know what, I don't really have time for this right now.
3955030	3960736	It would have been a lot nicer if I could have just streamed it through something like this to make my opinion.
3961016	3962978	And there are other MMOs that allow you to do this.
3963058	3966321	I'm sorry to be so MMO-centric, but, you know, it's kind of what comes to mind.
3967421	3970164	That's a great use for the streaming technology is the demos.
3970584	3974607	Of course, are you getting your full graphical potential of the game that way?
3975088	3977250	I don't know, but... Yeah, that's another thing.
3977290	3987378	And then also, you know, with some of these devices, you know, not everybody's upgraded their wireless networks, so you may be running wireless G, and that's going to throttle you a little bit, and...
3989953	3994244	or, you know, you have to be connected to the Wi-Fi for this stuff to work for the most part.
3995407	3995708	I just...
3997485	4000567	My tablet has a weird tendency to cut in and out of the Wi-Fi too.
4000948	4004950	I'll be connected to Wi-Fi and then once every 15 minutes it just drops for 15 seconds.
4005431	4008253	And that'll kill your game if I'm trying to stream gamings off that.
4008273	4011315	I just don't like dealing with GameStop.
4011375	4012415	It's kind of where it's at.
4012435	4013316	Yeah, that's a good point.
4013836	4018039	They will find a way to take the shrink wrap off those digital downloads before I purchase them.
4018579	4019720	I just know it's going to happen.
4021461	4028668	Alright, well this is a game that maybe some of you will be streaming through a console later, unconfirmed, but I don't know, it's a big game.
4029549	4030790	Tekken Tag Tournament 2.
4032572	4033393	You excited about this?
4033974	4038438	There's some more information that came out about this from Gamescom.
4038478	4040320	Tekken Tag Tournament 2, it will support 3D.
4042061	4044542	So you can have 3D fighting and kicking and all that.
4044802	4045942	3D can be switched on or off.
4046042	4049084	The depth can be adjusted to whatever it is that you like on there.
4049464	4056346	There's also something called Tekken Tunes where you can make your own custom soundtrack by importing your own CDs or MP3s or whatever.
4056746	4060868	There's also Fight Lab which is a way that beginners can learn the play mechanics.
4061308	4067730	There's a robot fighter named Combot and you will practice your techniques on that in order to get through the Fight Lab.
4068130	4068550	DarkSakura.com
4089861	4090521	DarkSakura?
4119133	4119713	Final Fantasy XIV
4139426	4139967	Indeed.
4140927	4149834	Well, basically they have this thing called a Realm Reborn, which is the relaunch of Final Fantasy XIV.
4151735	4161923	And there's an interview with Naoki Yoshida who is saying that losing your fans' trust is an easy thing to do and regaining it is very hard.
4162763	4169506	They really think that they're going to be able to regain the fans' trust by rebuilding Final Fantasy XIV.
4170047	4171947	And they want that to be where they launch it from.
4171988	4173088	Say, hey, this is great.
4173628	4175329	What's XV and XVI going to be like?
4175549	4177070	Well, first of all, stop numbering them.
4177987	4180129	They won't be online MMOs, let's hope
4208351	4219067	So, another thing that he pointed out is that in the entire history of the Final Fantasy series, there has not been one that failed, which is why they're not giving up on 14th.
4220061	4223723	There's a lot of people that respond to that by saying, what about XIII?
4224403	4228065	But XIII wasn't, they wouldn't have made XIII too if XIII was a failure.
4229025	4234727	Some people just straight up didn't like XIII, which I can get the reasons why people weren't into XIII.
4234867	4235868	I liked it an awful lot.
4235968	4238049	If you didn't like it, it doesn't mean something failed.
4238209	4238889	Exactly.
4239029	4239810	Very good point.
4240170	4241210	Very good point, Internet.
4241230	4243151	It just means that you don't like it.
4243311	4244171	Other people do.
4244352	4244732	Shut up.
4244792	4245292	Get over it.
4245872	4248313	Don't take, this is, okay, I have to rant a minute.
4248953	4254936	It pisses me off when I say I don't like something and someone else immediately says, oh, well, I do, you're wrong.
4255496	4257217	Or, well, I do as if I'm wrong.
4257917	4258938	Or vice versa.
4260618	4271423	One person liking something or disliking something that you do not is not a personal reflection on you, oh, person of very small willpower and self-worth.
4272143	4273984	You know, end of rant.
4274520	4277585	But we can all agree Final Fantasy XIV was bad, right?
4277805	4278446	We can all agree on that.
4278466	4278947	I didn't play it.
4279027	4280390	I actually can't tell you if it was bad or not.
4280630	4281271	It probably was.
4281672	4285558	I haven't played it, but from what I heard... Oh, I'm just trying to make a joke.
4285638	4287421	Obviously somebody's paying for it out there.
4287461	4288663	They wouldn't have any servers running.
4288945	4291548	I mean, I'm sure there's people that probably like it.
4291708	4294352	There are people who are like, I don't have anything else better to do.
4294432	4298657	I feel like our chat room at live.vognetwork.com has suddenly become a support group.
4299197	4302121	Breakman says, some of us like Final Fantasy XIII.
4302441	4304283	Jvmon says, I like XIII.
4304344	4306206	Stan says, hey, I liked XIII.
4306246	4306686	I didn't like XII.
4307347	4309369	I liked what I played of it, I just got a little bored.
4309429	4312653	Dungeon Busters says XIII was still commercially successful.
4312953	4315576	Kitsune says, I liked Final Fantasy XIII too.
4316016	4319540	Didn't like Dash 2 as much, just because of that ending.
4319840	4321922	But I mean, it's the whole...
4322743	4325485	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4350730	4356915	JV Mon in chat says, I dislike Final Fantasy 7, but respect other people's opinions who differ from my own.
4357896	4358076	See?
4358156	4358957	A model citizen.
4359237	4359497	Yes.
4361059	4363801	RDG Singe says, I like Duke Nukem Forever.
4365502	4366823	You are entitled to like it.
4368385	4369525	You are entitled to like it.
4369966	4373829	I personally think that it was, what's a good description?
4374930	4376751	A festering pile of shit, but...
4381873	4383275	I love 10 and 10 too.
4383315	4383816	I'm sorry.
4385238	4387220	Brakeman says, stop talking about my low self-esteem.
4387281	4387721	How dare you?
4387761	4388602	Wait, what are we talking about?
4389323	4389664	It's just...
4392714	4393694	I don't know what it is.
4394175	4406579	It's a big internet thing, definitely, but it's also a human thing for people to want everyone to like the same things that they do or hate the same things that they do and poo-poo anybody else who doesn't think the way I do, damn it, politics.
4408920	4413742	Which is a little bit more important, but it's... Now, video games are the most important thing.
4413762	4414683	What are you talking about?
4416723	4420145	But it's at the same time as like, okay, Final Fantasy...
4421309	4424690	Final Fantasy XIV, they're looking at it as a failure.
4425690	4428491	Fiscally, it's probably a failure for them.
4428531	4431192	It's probably pulling in just enough money to keep a couple servers up.
4431312	4433212	It is a little bit unprecedented.
4434073	4442075	No matter what your personal opinion is on XIV, if you think we're too hard on it or what, it is unprecedented for a game company to come out and apologize for a game.
4442577	4442837	Yes.
4444438	4447279	And they are taking steps to fix it.
4447319	4450480	They clearly believe that there's something with that product that's worth salvaging.
4451440	4451600	Yes.
4451660	4460443	And for all the people out there, like, what brought me to this point, regardless, say 13 was a failure, fiscally, financially, I'm sorry, that's what I mean.
4460643	4461264	Was it a failure?
4461544	4461684	No.
4461864	4463865	It made them buckets of money.
4465768	4473592	GameGuru in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, for example, I don't like F-Zero, but I respect that it is a great game, just not a racing game I like.
4473632	4475473	Well, you are entitled to your wrong opinion.
4476113	4476693	Shut up.
4477454	4478334	Now go sit in the corner.
4478534	4479094	Well, here's me.
4479635	4480955	I don't like strategy games.
4482236	4483697	Couldn't sit through Warcraft to play it.
4484177	4485137	Love World of Warcraft.
4485978	4486918	The third time.
4489677	4489977	Fourth.
4490117	4490578	Fourth, Rob.
4490598	4490838	Fourth.
4490998	4491418	Oh, sorry.
4492059	4492679	Fourth time's the charm.
4492699	4495561	Because I played with each expansion until I liked it.
4496862	4498503	But, I mean, I love the universe.
4498523	4500484	I hate the first series of games.
4500964	4501264	You know?
4502285	4504987	It just has to... Personal preference...
4505427	4507468	I notoriously can't stand Final Fantasy VIII.
4507668	4511890	And it's not the story that bothers me, it's that fucking fighting system ruined.
4512010	4512390	I know.
4512690	4514591	I loved the story so much.
4514951	4517191	By the time I got to the third disc, four for reals.
4517612	4524254	But the whole point is that take personal opinion out of the equation and look at it for what it is.
4524354	4525535	How much money did it make?
4525775	4527335	How big of a player base does it have?
4528116	4531697	That determines in the terms... That's what the stockholders are looking at.
4531957	4532397	Exactly.
4532798	4537280	That determines right there if something is a failure as a product or not.
4538360	4541962	Now, for everyone who bought Final Fantasy XIII and hate it, they still got the money.
4542382	4542863	They like it.
4543143	4543423	Sorry.
4543623	4544544	They still got your money at one.
4545384	4545804	End of story.
4546685	4552348	But when you've got an ongoing product that people are going to pay a subscription for, that's a different story.
4552908	4554869	And for that you have to deliver month after month.
4555925	4560837	Alright, well let's travel around the world and check out what possibly controversial new releases are coming out this week.
4561398	4563302	I don't really know if there's anything controversial, but we'll see.
4563683	4564766	Let's start in the U.S., Loki.
4565509	4566249	This is going to be short.
4567190	4570251	Transformers, Fall of Cybertron, PS3 and 360.
4571571	4571871	That's it.
4572411	4572771	Dang.
4573052	4576573	Well, we did just have a system launch today in a big Nintendo game.
4576613	4578753	Well, it's not technically a new system.
4578793	4582295	It's about as new as, say, New Super Mario Bros.
4582315	4582295	2.
4582395	4585356	There's some big PC games in a couple weeks, too.
4585736	4588257	So, that's that.
4589497	4591599	All right, let's go to Japan.
4591919	4594521	Japan's looking a little bit empty this week as well.
4594621	4599165	On the Xbox 360, there is the Witcher 2 Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition.
4599405	4602147	I don't know what's enhanced about that, but that's on the 360 this week.
4602568	4605670	That's the only thing on the 360 in Japan.
4606111	4611515	Otherwise, on the PlayStation 3, No More Heroes Red Zone Edition gets the best treatments.
4611535	4612456	That means a price reduction.
4613016	4614237	Also, I don't know what this is.
4614297	4615779	It's a hybrid disc.
4615819	4617520	I think this is a game and an anime.
4617921	4624206	It's Rine no Lagrange, Kamogawa Days, and it's the game and the anime.
4625187	4629611	And that's kind of something we see on the PlayStation 3 happen a little bit is that you have the game slash movie or whatever.
4629631	4631533	Yeah, it's a PlayStation Network game and the movie.
4631693	4632193	DarkSakura.com
4659080	4666423	Why I don't have a Vita Maybe you'll have to get one for Hatsune Miku Project Diva F You're not a Project Diva fan?
4666463	4669865	I thought you were I am, but I don't have a Vita, so what does it matter?
4669965	4688173	Well you can get, in Japan, on the 30th, you can get a Vita Hatsune Miku Limited Edition Well I'll let the people who actually have jobs and money get one for me You should sell Etsy's to fund your Vita The fuck would I make on Etsy?
4691691	4693192	I'm selling my rage!
4693853	4700641	You get an mp3 of me going You can record people's voicemail messages.
4702443	4704245	Yeah, you could set up their voicemail messages.
4704265	4706127	Hi, this is DarkSakura, go away.
4706868	4707209	Beep!
4709707	4712008	Hi, this is DarkSakura from Orange Lounge Radio.
4712068	4715008	Chances are I don't like you or your friend, but leave a message anyway.
4715128	4715489	Bye.
4715769	4719670	That reminds me, I got to record a voicemail message for my Google.
4720090	4727732	I have my Google voice number that apparently Omaha Steaks likes calling daily to market me.
4728052	4729172	I forgot that I had set it up.
4729192	4730753	Did you buy steaks from them once or something?
4730773	4732433	Yes, I had a gift card that I won.
4732513	4738794	So I was like, okay, I got to make a number that they can call and I got to make an email address that they can email to.
4738854	4744215	So I gave them the email address I don't use and then I gave them that phone number.
4744335	4751577	So now I need to figure out how to forward that to, I don't know, the void.
4751597	4753317	Hi, this is Loki's voicemail.
4753397	4754258	Please leave a message.
4754298	4756278	Unless you're Omaha Steaks, then fuck off.
4757659	4758180	I like that.
4759583	4760585	I'll record it for you.
4762699	4764540	Unless you're trying to sell shit, then get lost.
4765321	4767943	Unless you're going to send me free steak, in which case you can send me free steak.
4768743	4770464	If it's not free, I don't fucking care.
4773346	4780451	On the Nintendo 3DS, Boku wa Koku Kansai-kan, Airport Hero 3D Honolulu.
4781112	4786395	I have no idea what Airport Hero is, but I imagine in my head it's a lot like the... What's that?
4786515	4788957	Pocket Planes on the iOS system.
4789497	4790158	Or on the iOS.
4790378	4791038	Yeah, something like that.
4791339	4792019	iPhone and all that.
4792099	4793601	All right, that's it for Japanese release dates.
4793801	4794922	How about the UK, DarkSakura?
4795803	4796724	A few things, a few.
4797565	4802671	We have on the 21st, Darksiders 2 and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure HD.
4803452	4805815	God, that series has been out in Japan for like, what, ever?
4806996	4808338	Since like, the mid-80s?
4809159	4810540	And we're just now getting stuff for it?
4810640	4810941	I'm just...
4811221	4812362	whatever.
4812662	4816065	22nd, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure HD on the PS3.
4816946	4825874	And on the 24th, Dark Souls for PC, Endless Space for PC, and Transformers Fall of Cybertron, which is all my friend has ever talked about and I don't care anymore.
4827910	4828250	Origins
4851730	4856152	It's coming to Mac, because they have games on the Mac, so of course it would.
4856713	4867418	So of course, Peter Moore announced that during Gamescom, it's going to be coming to a few different platforms, including smart TVs, the Mac, Android, and Facebook.
4868299	4879965	And they're also going to be adding some new features, including free-to-play gaming, which is, I think, where the Facebook and Android comes into play, and achievements.
4881641	4882362	Hurrah!
4884925	4885346	Hurray!
4885426	4888229	Now you can play broken games of Mass Effect 3 on the Mac.
4888730	4892374	Well, that doesn't necessarily mean the games are coming out on those systems, but Origin will be there.
4893413	4897056	You know, Origin cannot... This boggles my mind.
4897296	4902860	If Alan and I want to play our two friends at the same house in the Bay Area, we can't do it.
4903040	4906623	Origin can't handle two people in one place versus two in another place.
4906943	4910046	We can do two on one, or them two against one.
4910066	4911187	We can't do two on two.
4911527	4913048	It is not possible in Origin's setup.
4914082	4914402	Really?
4915583	4915883	Really?
4917264	4918645	I bet Steam can handle that.
4919786	4922968	To be fair, we haven't tried, but I don't see why it wouldn't work.
4923428	4928432	I've never really had a game that failed miserably playing it through Steam.
4928512	4931374	I had a great Civ V match not that long ago.
4932154	4934676	Borderlands is through GameSpy, so that's a little different.
4935436	4937658	I wouldn't measure that, so whatever.
4938328	4938568	All right.
4939608	4944289	Well, speaking of underappreciated classics, the Neo Geo.
4944349	4945570	Remember the Neo Geo?
4945890	4947150	Yeah, I've looked at one the other day.
4947670	4948710	You've got one in your house, right?
4948730	4949650	I have two, actually.
4949691	4951231	Those fuckers are expensive, too.
4951251	4952471	I have a Neo Geo and a Neo CD.
4952511	4953871	You know how Dan got his Neo Geo?
4954452	4956232	He traded a Sega CD for it.
4956852	4957132	Wow.
4957812	4959853	Well, you might have to make room on the shelf for this.
4959973	4962453	It's the Neo Geo X Gold.
4962873	4963434	That's right.
4963734	4965294	It's a new system.
4966174	4988574	and now there were rumors about this before that this was coming but it is confirmed the Neo Geo X Gold is a thing it's a $200 thing hey Neo Geos were never known for being cheap right now the cool thing is though even for being a $200 system it does come with a bunch of pre-installed games these games used to be like $200 a piece if you remember but
4989294	5000080	Such classics like Art of Fighting 2, Magician Lord, Metal Slug, Baseball Stars 2, Fatal Fury and Fatal Fury Special, King of Fighters 95, Samurai Showdown 2, King of the Monsters.
5000420	5001181	All this is built in.
5001201	5002541	I have four of those games already.
5002681	5005243	So there's a lot of, I mean, and I'm only reading part of the list.
5005283	5008504	So there's a good, looks like about 20 games or so that are installed.
5009845	5012527	I noticed though, I don't see Bust a Move on this list.
5012567	5013067	I don't see, or
5013948	5015150	Puzzle Bob or whatever you want to call it.
5015171	5016934	Well, these are all SNK games.
5017255	5018337	That was Taito.
5018417	5018818	Good point.
5018938	5019299	Good point.
5020000	5023086	Well, anyhow, there is also this... I guess here's the weird thing.
5024672	5034558	It is a handheld, so it's a handheld system, but it's also, I guess, you can plug it into a docking station, and then it's a TV thing, too?
5035499	5036900	That's kind of cool, I gotta say.
5037080	5038941	Yeah, it's a docking station that's a video out.
5039561	5040022	That's kind of cool.
5040042	5048187	Wow, that's pretty cool that my Dingu does the same thing, and was a whole hell of a lot cheaper, and yeah.
5049928	5053972	I think it's kind of cool, but $200 is a steep price to pay for nostalgia.
5054052	5067264	Seriously, you can purchase one of those 48-in-1, 60-in-1 Neo Geo arcade cards and get a Super Gun for way fucking cheaper than that.
5067544	5068585	I have a Super Gun.
5068685	5070047	It's like an all-in-one card thing.
5070768	5074613	That literally plugs into Neo Geo controllers.
5074694	5076096	It's pinned out for that.
5076496	5081504	And I have a 61 cart, so... Nope, not gonna buy it.
5083075	5083936	Yeah, I don't know.
5085177	5087999	This thing would have to be really something special in order to get me to buy it.
5088059	5094123	I will say, though, the little joystick they have with it is like a mock replica.
5094183	5096765	Those things are rock solid, those controllers with the four buttons.
5097365	5098466	It's a nice controller.
5098807	5099427	I will say that.
5100408	5100688	I love ours.
5100728	5101508	Your game doesn't have that.
5102609	5107073	I love them, honestly, playing all these games, because it's the arcade experience.
5107193	5108754	Yeah, I'll give it that.
5108834	5109414	That's pretty cool.
5111938	5118932	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com, use the passphrase milkshake.
5119329	5126093	Alright, let's take a trip back down memory lane to a time when the Neo Geo was, you know, more relevant.
5126213	5128895	Although, you did not pick a Neo Geo game tonight, did you?
5128955	5129515	I did not.
5129735	5130395	Oh, well, that's okay.
5131336	5142082	We are going to go down the archives of classic gaming and DarkSakura is going to jump into the vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, even though you might not be able to find it, you kids should play this game right now.
5142923	5145344	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
5145924	5146545	Troubleshooter.
5147745	5148666	Anyone remember this game?
5150387	5155250	It came out on the Sega Genesis.
5155811	5156992	It has awesome music.
5158173	5158993	Play a little bit of it here.
5159133	5160995	Assassination Cult.
5166915	5168697	This game is such a freaking parody, I love it.
5189855	5194978	The game is a real... It basically just makes fun of itself the whole time.
5195039	5201582	You play as a girl named Madison, who is a combat operative who has to rescue a prince that has been taken hostage.
5202143	5204584	And she goes around with her partner, Crystal.
5205525	5211929	Now, basically, you play as Madison, and Crystal's kind of attached to her butt...
5212809	5215070	It's the only way I can describe their positioning.
5215971	5222634	And Crystal always points backwards, but you can flip her to point in the front.
5222794	5225035	And she's invulnerable to enemy fire.
5225095	5229197	The only one who has the hitbox is Madison, who you're playing as.
5230417	5245110	and Crystal is only affected if Madison dies so basically you have a special weapon that helps you during combat and like I said you can flip back and forth you can flip your partner back and forth but you are always facing to the right
5246812	5248833	and you've got different power-ups.
5248873	5252977	And it's funny, when you get a power-up, she goes, Thank you!
5253297	5253717	Like that.
5254778	5257320	And they make little noises when they get hurt and everything.
5257340	5259301	A little bubble comes up and says, Ouch!
5259561	5260202	It's so cute.
5261443	5264065	But it didn't really have a life system.
5264645	5267447	You stocked up hit points by getting life-up icons.
5268588	5274012	Now, it had a sequel in Japan called Battlemania Daiginjo.
5274973	5281119	Now, we're going to move forward into what makes this game special, and I'm talking more about Battlemania.
5284042	5286384	It's kind of slow-paced.
5287445	5292209	It has this sort of, like I said, the weird playing style in it.
5293650	5297194	But basically, oh, and in Japan they were called Mania and Maria, sorry.
5297931	5316361	um they basically go down and shoot weird machines and um it had some really fun stuff thrown in like um uh they had an issue in the game now this was um because uh
5318380	5345652	the group they were working with which was Studio Uchu Tetsujin which is also called Studio Space Iron Man did not like that Victokai worked for Super Famicom so they had an interesting little easter egg thrown into the game where if you press start, right, and C on the second controller the two heroines in the game will shoot past the Sega logo and you will see Madison jumping up and down on the Super Famicom
5346773	5348356	Just bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce.
5348376	5352945	Sega does what Nintendo...
5356507	5358108	It's not in the English version.
5361652	5370460	So basically, as things went along, this was going into the sequel, the Battlemania Daigangel.
5371761	5375024	It had mushrooms come out that...
5377806	5386893	were part of the power-ups, and it had a fleet of, well, guys that looked like Kate Mario that you had to shoot down.
5389014	5394658	There was also just a bunch of stuff that was going on with this.
5395499	5405445	And there's an official picture that came out where it shows the girls playing volleyball
5406387	5409589	with a Super Famicom and a Hammer.
5411303	5413885	and then in the game Segagaga.
5414626	5415506	You remember that one, right?
5415526	5420150	Where you have to basically, you're trying to save Sega from financial ruin.
5420771	5430138	Well, they get helped in the end of the game by a bunch of characters from their games and out come the two ladies from Battlemania.
5432039	5437484	Definitely, the game itself is definitely a big poop on Nintendo.
5438402	5439723	But also, it's just really fun.
5439823	5441165	I mean, it's a fun little shooter.
5441986	5447311	So, this is a game that I would love to have a copy of, either the US one or the Japanese one.
5447991	5451695	So, I would just be giddy if I had this game.
5453196	5455939	Unfortunately, I haven't seen it since I was in high school.
5457280	5457921	But it was a fun game.
5458922	5462766	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Troubleshooter.
5464266	5467468	and that's going to do it for part A of Orange Lounge Radio.
5467968	5469189	But don't go anywhere, guys.
5469209	5486758	We're going to take a break and then when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, your Twitter questions at twitter.com slash OLR, the Fugle question of the week, some stuff going on with Valve, some stuff on the Wii U and your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com all after a quick break.
5486858	5487258	Right, Jamie?
5489182	5491083	Alright, something special for you guys tonight.
5491183	5494885	A rare music break for both the live and the podcast listeners.
5495265	5499347	This is a track from the Darksiders 2 soundtrack scored by Jesper Kidd.
5499747	5504789	Big thanks to Something Else Music Works, www.sumthing.com
5505189	5511571	or on Twitter at sumthingdigital for giving us the opportunity to play it for all our listeners this week.
5512032	5518914	If you dig it, check out the Darksiders 2 soundtrack in physical and digital form on Amazon and in digital form on iTunes.
5519234	5524056	So here it is, Jesper Kidd from the Darksiders 2 soundtrack with The Corruption.
5524356	5528598	You're participating with Orange Lounge Radio at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
5528618	5528598	... ...
5535651	5536513	Thanks for watching!
5577100	5578021	Thank you for watching!
5618846	5620488	Thanks for watching!
5788593	5789520	Thanks for watching!
5830766	5840694	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 4, excuse me, yeah, 470, I lost count for a minute there, for this August 19th, 2012.
5842015	5848720	And that was awesome, thanks again to Something Music for letting us play that during the break there, that was great.
5849540	5856606	Again, that was The Corruption from the Darksiders 2 soundtrack by Jesper Kidd, that was really cool, hoped you guys liked that too.
5856926	5857386	I liked it.
5857406	5857907	Yeah, it was nice.
5858227	5865633	And some folks in chat there, DungeonBuster says, at live.vognetwork.com says, I thought Kid did a great job on the Darksiders 2 stuff.
5865893	5869356	There's a base theme in this one that runs into other pieces.
5869736	5870197	So there you go.
5871558	5879564	All right, we're going to get back into the show with some rapid fire news, some quick news stories here, and we'll start it off with Loki.
5880325	5885329	All right, so the Vita is getting some new firmware soon, version 1.8.
5886870	5899104	and this is kind of cool because one of the complaints about the Vita before were with the visually impaired having trouble accessing stuff on the Vita because there was no button controls on the home screen.
5899144	5900045	Well, that's going to change.
5900225	5908474	Now that there will be button controls on the home screen, you'll be able to use the directional pad and stuff to navigate those screens and...
5909054	5909274	and so on.
5934508	5942857	I guess there's going to be a new cross controller icon in the remote play for the cross controller supporting games.
5944638	5946040	And then other tweaks, I'm sure.
5948177	5948377	Black Ops 2
5978778	5979919	Thanks for watching!
5999881	6001362	So that's something that they're adding in there.
6001843	6010250	Also, League Play is going to be added in as well as the option to do live streams of your gameplay.
6010270	6015013	So you can have live streams and you can also do shoutcasts of commentary.
6015033	6015434	So you can have
6015854	6043385	commentary going over the whole thing as well and that's built into the goddamn game that's interesting I guess some people harnessing the types of things we see on like Ustream and Twitch TV and all that interesting yeah so that's pretty cool and then there's also a rumor that Black Ops 2 is heading to the Wii U according to a QA tester's resume who was on LinkedIn I'm just gonna make it easy for you it's not a fucking rumor it's coming on the Wii U I mean I've been saying it for weeks now so it is coming on the Wii U
6044105	6048288	I know because I've seen the UPC and other things.
6048668	6050289	But yes, duh.
6050389	6050969	I mean, come on.
6051009	6056993	It's going to be a simple port of the other games, and Treyarch supports the Wii, so it's going to be coming out.
6057433	6069561	Well, speaking of the Wii U, SpotPass is apparently going to be a feature of the Wii U. This, again, really strikes me as a type of duh, but it is going around the internet this week that I guess it's kind of the new version of Wii Connect 24, which, you know,
6069861	6074542	Remember that was a thing that your Wii U was always on, but it's not used as well as it could be.
6075363	6081024	SpotPass, a little better on the DS, so hopefully they're going to implement that more and more through the Nintendo platforms.
6081664	6086726	This is all coming from a photo of a Wii U development kit that the Wii U will have the SpotPass feature.
6086806	6087966	I mean, come on, of course.
6088462	6089763	Team Ninja Metroid Other M
6109873	6112215	which, you know, was kind of met with mixed reaction.
6112435	6113415	Not everybody was into it.
6113495	6118419	I thought it was pretty good, but, you know, nothing has yet to top Super Metroid for me.
6118599	6120500	You know, nothing's even really come close, honestly.
6120560	6121741	What about Fusion?
6124222	6125443	Close, but still doesn't top it.
6126424	6130767	The closest thing I would say would be the Metroid Zero, Zero Mission, was probably the closest.
6130787	6131587	Is that the one I'm thinking of?
6131607	6132508	That was on the Game Boy Advance.
6134344	6156037	Team Ninja's Yosuke Hayashi says that they are still close to Nintendo and the designer Yoshio Sakamoto Apparently they were both directors of Metroid Other M on the Wii And according to Hayashi, Team Ninja wants to work with Nintendo on another Metroid title
6156397	6182864	here's a quote unfortunately Metroid is kind of out of our meaning Team Ninja's League as it's Nintendo's game but we're still in close touch with so co-creator Sakamoto-san so we want to do something with him moving forward definitely it really depends on what he wants to do with the game first so you know kind of like a a peace offering there I mean but again at the end of the day if Metroid Other M didn't sell which I don't believe it did sell up to expectations I don't know what the future is going to hold for Metroid but I can't
6183342	6184923	They totally screwed up with Samus in that game.
6207850	6210091	Las Ketchup with The Ketchup Song.
6210131	6211752	Remember that, Jen, from back in the day?
6212333	6212833	Oh, my God.
6212973	6213673	Well, that's current.
6215535	6217876	Justin Bieber featuring Nicki Minaj.
6218036	6219037	Beauty and a beat.
6219577	6221078	I didn't even know that that was a thing.
6221278	6223139	Now that I know it is a thing, it's a thing I'd like to not hear.
6223160	6224180	I didn't even know she had beauty.
6224300	6228723	I mean... She's the beat.
6228803	6230464	Justin Bieber, I guess, is beauty.
6230784	6231565	A beautiful lesbian.
6231645	6232145	All right.
6232526	6234427	Carly Rae Jepsen with Call Me Maybe.
6235646	6236767	Grandpa, you out there listening?
6238269	6238570	Let's see.
6238950	6239591	I love this.
6240132	6242174	Army of Lovers with Crucified.
6243720	6272224	I like that song YouTube that video immediately it is fucking amazing and I cannot stress how great it is over a radio show but you don't understand how awesome it is that that song is in this game until you YouTube the video seriously do it after OLR Army of Lovers Crucified it's in Just Dance 4 they definitely have an eclectic mix they really do they really do Rihanna with Disturbia something new let's see they might be Giants Istanbul
6272924	6273404	That's funny.
6273504	6274324	I was in DDR once.
6274924	6275585	I think it's Ultimix 3.
6276145	6277925	Elvis Presley with Jailhouse Rock.
6278665	6280906	Then Ricky Martin with Livin' La Vida Loco.
6281026	6281386	Of course.
6281406	6282106	Livin' La Vida Loco.
6282706	6285666	Selena Gomez in the scene with Love You Like a Love Song.
6286427	6287307	Moves Like Jagger.
6287507	6289347	You know, because every fucking game has to have moves like Jagger.
6290487	6292128	Alexandra Stan, Mr. Saxo Beat.
6292168	6292708	Remember that song?
6293788	6294288	Not really.
6294468	6295588	I like Marina and the Diamonds.
6295868	6297029	Oh no, it's going to be in there.
6297109	6298189	That's a very British...
6298709	6302281	I think there's a good... It's not just eclectic, but it's eclectic like multi-regional.
6302863	6303545	Like you get a lot of...
6304366	6305187	Do we get any J-pop?
6305207	6306567	Do we, do we, do we, do we?
6306628	6307828	Not that eclectic, unfortunately.
6307908	6308089	See?
6308129	6321557	But you do get the B-52s with Rock Lobster, Pink with So What, Halloween Thrills with The Time Warp, which I do believe would be a cover of the Rocky Horror Picture Show song, which is obviously all kinds of amazing.
6322498	6326121	Too Unlimited with Tribal Dance, as long as we're borrowing from DDR games, right?
6327181	6329623	Rihanna with Umbrella, Ella, Ella.
6330664	6333105	One Direction with What Makes You Beautiful, because, you know.
6333125	6333706	Hey, hey.
6335427	6337528	Will Smith with Wild Wild West.
6338729	6341510	Wow, that must have been a cheap license.
6342991	6344732	And here's my favorite.
6345813	6349075	Skillerex with Rock and Roll will take you to the mountain.
6349735	6351256	So now you get your dubstep song.
6351276	6353217	I've never heard that song, and I never plan on it.
6353958	6355819	No, do not poison my brain.
6355899	6356939	I am kind of curious.
6357540	6358981	With shitty dubstep.
6359241	6360041	I hate dubstep.
6360381	6361442	Not all dubstep's shitty.
6361562	6361942	Yes, it is.
6362162	6362983	Come on.
6365485	6366106	I will say this.
6366426	6372655	We were at brunch today, and this dubstep song, this obvious dubstep song was playing on the speaker.
6372675	6377742	It was like, and I was like, what in the fuck is this?
6378303	6380747	And Alan's all, oh, it's the hot new single by Car Alarm.
6383744	6384424	It's a car alarm.
6384705	6384825	Oh.
6386645	6388726	I wouldn't be surprised if there was a group called that, just saying.
6388966	6391206	I'm surprised they don't have a car alarm that's dubstep.
6392627	6398288	I know, I was like, can I put that in my car to scare away the... Okay, here we go, an OLR exclusive, everybody.
6399049	6401709	DarkSakura gets introduced to dubstep.
6401949	6402650	Here we go.
6402750	6404110	No, take your fingers out of your ear.
6404150	6406711	This is for science, DarkSakura, for science.
6406811	6407211	Here we go.
6421249	6423030	DarkSakura, I can't let too much of this play.
6423970	6426271	I can let a little bit of it play for the purposes of commentary.
6426511	6429172	But DarkSakura, thoughts on Rock and Roll Will Take You to the Mountain?
6429573	6430433	I'm going to quote Becky.
6431693	6433474	That sort of cruelty will not be tolerated.
6433494	6438976	I kind of like that song, actually.
6438996	6440257	I don't know.
6441277	6444278	Doesn't he use that same little, oh my god, riff in another song?
6444719	6445299	Oh, I'm sure he does.
6445319	6445639	I think he does.
6452872	6456233	I would rather listen to Sarah Brightman.
6457553	6458794	And you know how I feel about Sarah Brightman.
6458814	6460555	I love Sarah Brightman, though.
6461255	6464996	She knows how to bring the... I can't... Never mind.
6465056	6468438	I shouldn't say the word, but she knows how to bring it.
6469298	6470219	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6498872	6520947	BlackWolf says the dubstep song we have in rotation is okay, the Skyrim to the knee SSJ100Matt says that's pretty good That's how she was a sitting vampire actually said It always reminds me of downtown Julie Brown Speaking of dubstep, have you seen the new trailer for Borderlands 2?
6521627	6523068	It's fucking fantastic
6523689	6524510	Oh, is it all dubstep?
6524530	6525731	No, it's not all dubstep.
6526051	6530274	They reminded me of it because, you know, they had the first trailer they were making fun of the dubstep trailers.
6530854	6535478	And, you know, of course, they have, you know, Claptrap doing dubstep stuff.
6535878	6537740	But, no, the new trailer is fucking awesome.
6537800	6540822	It's got, you know, the villain basically at the end is like, come and get me.
6541362	6543984	It's like, yeah, I want to fucking kill that guy.
6544004	6547247	And does it have that same music, that wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop?
6547267	6548287	I don't know.
6548328	6551530	I don't remember it had that, but it's got some sort of electronica in there.
6553280	6554100	Exciting, exciting radio.
6554180	6554580	I don't care.
6554620	6555100	It's exciting for me.
6555120	6555581	Do they not have it?
6555621	6556521	Maybe this is it.
6556561	6557101	That looks live.
6557121	6558181	I want to know if you like this.
6558201	6559521	Let me try to feel this vibration.
6582738	6586940	Why is she spasming?
6588620	6590781	Or doing like some stupid interpretive dance?
6590801	6591701	I like that song.
6592061	6593382	I just don't like her voice.
6595763	6600985	And of course she's being all like Jesus-y with her hands up and being carried by her disciples.
6601005	6602565	I really don't care for her voice that much.
6603525	6605966	I mean, I thought that she was good in Repo.
6606086	6606627	That's about it.
6607547	6609107	Only because she rips her eyes out.
6609648	6610428	Well, yeah.
6615123	6617825	Tonight is like the Discover New Music on OLR night.
6617885	6618925	She rips her eyes out.
6618945	6624028	That'd be a good animated gif for something, like bad YouTube videos or something.
6625629	6627150	I'm surprised I haven't seen that gif on OLR.
6627190	6627630	No, they didn't.
6629731	6631492	I'd rather be blind.
6633093	6635675	Not to spoil Repo, the lunatic opera, but it's a great movie.
6636615	6640017	Well, it's freaking, my man is in it.
6641081	6642101	Anthony Stewart Head.
6642342	6642702	Yes.
6643962	6645463	He can be my uncle.
6645743	6648904	Because remember, I have my special family with Betty White as my grandmother.
6650205	6651405	George Takei is my gay daddy.
6653946	6655747	I haven't decided who my other gay daddy is.
6658268	6658648	All right.
6659389	6662490	Let's move on with more rapid fire news.
6663230	6664071	DarkSakura.
6665391	6672156	Well, we've got a fan project that's called Mega Man Day in the Limelight 2.
6672256	6673637	Sorry, it's apparently a sequel.
6674297	6676579	It's done by the people that did Mushroom Kingdom Fusion.
6676759	6680522	It's a rearranged version of Mega Man 3, but instead of playing what?
6682763	6686486	Tiger Claw says, searching for car alarm dubstep, I found this.
6687327	6687507	Now I...
6695820	6697481	Oh my god!
6697501	6700743	Oh my god!
6707447	6711770	You just made me drop my mic.
6712790	6713110	Okay.
6714411	6719154	So anyway, you play through the stages of Mega Man 3, but you play as the Robot Masters from Mega Man 2.
6720395	6723837	So it looks like it's pretty fun, and I think I'm going to be grabbing this.
6725916	6754985	Fuck Rob No thank you, let's not fuck Rob The hell you did to my poor brain It was the chatters, it was Tiger Claw, it's all Tiger Claw's fault Team Fortress 2, we have a new co-op mode on August 15th called Man-na-na-na-na-na-na-na with an extra N, versus Machine So it's six players against doppelgangers, so you have to fight the robot versions of them And you get incredible loot!
6758032	6759472	It's not as cool as VOG loot.
6760113	6760293	No.
6761393	6763693	And then, last but never least, Steam.
6764114	6767514	The big picture mode is going to launch in beta in September.
6767935	6770435	So you can basically play Steam on your TV.
6771596	6771776	Aww.
6772176	6773956	But not a Valve console.
6775016	6775216	Aww.
6775977	6776277	The end.
6777177	6777537	The end.
6777597	6780698	Alright, let's go to the Fugo question of the week.
6788195	6790680	Put Facebook and Google Plus together and you get Foogle.
6791782	6794607	We ask a question every week of our... It's like they'd be their bastard love child.
6797009	6801893	We go to our fan communities every week to ask a question and share some of the answers with you guys here on the show.
6802234	6803755	There was a lot of answers tonight.
6803815	6805777	I can't read them all, but it's a fun question.
6806457	6807298	Football question of the week.
6807538	6808719	I'm not just saying that because I wrote it.
6809340	6810280	New Super Mario Bros.
6810520	6815224	2 came out today and it features new Mario powers that allow you to turn lots of things into gold coins.
6815645	6817787	This has us thinking about power-ups.
6818247	6821129	What is your favorite power-up item from a video game?
6821730	6824012	Please provide your user... Oh, I don't have to read that part.
6824332	6827194	Alright, what is your favorite power-up item from a video game?
6827674	6829115	Let's start on Google+, shall we?
6829155	6835038	With Monster B. My favorite power-up is Adrenaline Pills from Unreal Tournament 2003-2004.
6835078	6837200	Would you read this post with your Count Chocula voice?
6837220	6837360	Sure.
6843383	6847205	My favorite power-up is Adrenaline Pills from Unreal Tournament 2003.
6847465	6849986	Sound more like The Count.
6850406	6850886	Close enough.
6851467	6853508	One, one close.
6853828	6855709	They're all the same.
6855729	6855709	2003, 2004.
6859150	6862251	Flaco Jones says the Spread Gum power-up from Contra.
6862732	6863172	Good pick.
6864393	6870981	Redertainment says, as I remember there's an accessory in Borderlands that allows you to make a sniper rifle that sets enemies on fire.
6871462	6875727	Seeing people flare up and run around from a great distance always put a smile on my face.
6877850	6879953	You and DarkSakura have some things in common, right?
6883546	6884687	Let's move over to Facebook.
6884707	6886128	There's a lot of answers on Facebook.
6886168	6888089	I'm not going to be able to read all these, but I'll read some of them.
6888830	6893273	Rob himself says the red shell in Mario Kart unless it's aimed at me.
6895234	6895654	Let's see.
6896915	6903639	Ben R says the mushroom in Mario Kart where you can just jam the item button as much as possible for a certain amount of seconds and keep boosting.
6903939	6904660	The golden mushroom.
6905989	6911653	Matt J says, I always loved the grappling hook from Super Metroid and later in Metroid Prime.
6912114	6915296	I felt like a total badass swinging back and forth on those hooks.
6915696	6920660	The space jump comes in as a close second though, mostly because of the animation looking cool.
6922001	6926344	Nick M says, the gravity gun from Half-Life 2 was amazing.
6926524	6927185	That's great.
6927865	6932028	Dark Tetsuya says, gotta give it to the purple tracer laser from Raiden 2.
6933669	6934330	That, yes.
6935915	6938916	Gamer Girl says, The Red Heart Potions from Legend of Zelda.
6939877	6942538	Wicked says, The P-Wing from Super Mario Bros.
6942898	6942538	3.
6943278	6945619	As much as I loved Kuriboh's shoe and the Hammer Bros.
6945659	6951101	suit, I don't think I've ever cleared World 8 without at least three P-Wings in the inventory.
6951481	6955363	Infinite flight is a necessity, especially during the fast-scrolling airship stage.
6956183	6958424	Ratchet Tag simply says, Falcon Punch.
6959622	6964185	Benny L says, adult magazine from the God Hand that replenishes your God Hand meter.
6965747	6966227	Let's see.
6967108	6977515	Picaruno says, the hammer in Super Smash Brothers, the combination of silly music, ridiculous damage, and sheer oh fuck factor from anyone unlucky enough to be hit by it makes me giggle every time.
6978296	6981679	Jim H says, monster potion from Zombies Ate My Neighbors.
6982039	6986762	You could punch holes in fences and hedges and walls and kill lumberjacks with ease.
6988664	6995268	Austin W says, in the Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask, I love the final mask in the game that turns you into fierce DD Link.
6995648	6998410	I'm still waiting for this character to make an appearance in the Smash games.
6998770	6999711	That and Wolf Link.
7000612	7003393	Dark Charger says, Heavy Barrel from Heavy Barrel Arcade.
7003754	7006796	In the game, you must collect and assemble all the pieces of the Heavy Barrel weapon.
7007636	7015822	And Haseo Sumirogarwa says, if I were to choose one, it would have to be the chainsaw you get from a torture kill on Bayonetta.
7016522	7017402	What are some good answers?
7017982	7019083	How about you guys in the studio?
7019183	7021203	Favorite power-up in a video game?
7021323	7021984	I have a few.
7022344	7022584	Okay.
7022664	7024144	I really do like Kuriboh's shoe.
7024424	7025925	I wanted to use it through the whole damn game.
7026085	7026345	Of course.
7026365	7026925	Hi, Mariko.
7027665	7028345	My kitty came out.
7029166	7030766	Alan's kitty, but my adopted kitty.
7031226	7034207	This has been my recent favorite.
7034647	7036288	The collector laser rifle.
7037228	7037468	DarkSakura,
7055766	7075797	there was um oh and the issue of Fornax um as far as others that I really really like um I like the bells in Parodius that I like the word blaster where I have no idea what it's saying I can only read like some of it but it's like I don't know what you're saying but die
7076858	7079899	I love the Proteus power-ups a whole bunch.
7084501	7087362	Oh yeah, Cotton, where she gets the willow.
7087902	7089603	She goes, Weedle!
7089703	7090943	I just like it because that's all she says.
7092584	7092804	Loki?
7094744	7095625	Well, there's a few.
7095945	7098048	I have some actually from games I haven't played.
7098508	7099690	A couple from Red Faction.
7099730	7104255	They had Mr. Toots, which was a unicorn that fired rainbows out of its ass.
7104735	7105236	Amazing.
7105436	7106617	It was a weapon in the game.
7107038	7110662	That showed up in videos online too, right?
7110973	7111894	Fuzzy from Super Mario World 2
7127606	7129828	That wasn't really a power-up, but that's a good answer.
7129848	7130769	That's a good answer.
7130809	7131209	I like that.
7131510	7132190	It's memorable.
7132430	7148244	And then, actually, sort of a power-up from... It was actually in a bunch of Capcom games, but one I remember was Captain Commando, where you would hop into the mechs and punch and blow things up and catch things on fire.
7149065	7154890	Remember how all the old Capcom games had that little symbol that, like, showed up in every game that was always, like, an uber power-up?
7154930	7155731	Like, it was in every game.
7155791	7156812	I can't remember what it was called.
7156832	7157173	Do you remember?
7157593	7158253	That little symbol?
7159194	7167262	Like a little... I do also, though, have to second the purple laser in Raiden because that's always what I use was the purple laser.
7168142	7168663	Anything else, Loki?
7168683	7168763	Okay.
7169212	7169572	That's it.
7169832	7171433	Oh, there's one more I can add, actually.
7172133	7183255	Your shield thing in R-Type, the added-on option that you could shoot either from your butt or from the front, that was always a cool thing.
7184595	7186376	I'm going to go super-duper old school.
7186716	7189677	I think one of the best power-ups ever was the hammer in Donkey Kong.
7190077	7190817	Because the little song...
7193352	7196194	The little animation of the hammer going up and down was really funny to me.
7196274	7198675	So I always loved the hammer in the original Donkey Kong.
7199175	7204438	And then the pow brick in Mario Brothers because I love... I'm not talking Super Mario Brothers.
7204458	7205578	I'm talking old school Mario Brothers.
7205638	7206459	I loved that game.
7206499	7206939	I still do.
7207800	7209921	That's one of my favorite... You knock everyone on their ass.
7209961	7212042	That's one of my... Yeah, you just knock everyone on their ass.
7212082	7214923	And it is cool that the pow bricks kind of come back in the later Mario games.
7214943	7215744	That would be awesome.
7216804	7219307	Smash Brothers of Old Retro Arcade Games Ripple Gun from Life Force
7232654	7234315	Yes, that was the best one.
7234435	7235636	I love that power-up.
7235696	7239178	Like, sometimes, even though it wasn't that great of a gun, like, I would get it just because it's cool.
7239198	7240699	I don't know, I'm Team Laser over here.
7240919	7241399	Exactly.
7241659	7244801	Laser was the more effective power-up, but the Ripple was just cool.
7245301	7251165	And I really think the best power-up, like, ever were the options in the Gradius games and any of those games.
7251185	7251305	Option.
7251565	7251965	Option.
7252306	7252446	Yeah.
7252466	7253486	Maybe those are great power-ups.
7253526	7255608	Or too much speed-up, though, and you'd be dead.
7255988	7256148	Right.
7256588	7267758	Um, you know, well, another one, actually, since I mentioned R-Type is the, um, I don't know if it's called the Ripple Gun in R-Type, but it's like a dual red and blue that forms this big, uh, swirl as it goes across.
7267778	7268679	Like a wave gun or something?
7268699	7271021	Yeah, some kind of wave gun, but I just thought that one was pretty.
7271421	7273603	Uh, Chiggers in our chatroom says a Suriken?
7273763	7276005	I don't know if that was the name of it, that thing I'm trying to think of.
7276926	7277186	Where...
7278036	7301083	that's that Capcom thing that was in the like it was in 1942 and it was in Bionic Commando and which um um one other one I would name power up that was awesome you know I'm gonna go to Super Metroid right I'm gonna say the very end of the game when you have that laser that just blows through everything like the rainbow laser that just cuts through everything there was just something really epic about that moment when you had that beam as you were fighting Mother Brain
7301603	7302164	That was awesome.
7302344	7304145	There is one other thing I know.
7304645	7308647	It's a game I've actually covered for Classic Game that's Star Parodia.
7309308	7311389	I love shooting things with hue cards.
7312290	7312710	Can't help it.
7313010	7314291	I love this answer in the chat room.
7314351	7317673	Dungeon Buster says, Michael Jackson turning into a robot in Moonwalker.
7318033	7319534	That was pretty awesome, actually.
7319934	7320775	All right.
7320975	7322076	Thank you, DarkTestSuya.
7322516	7324037	That's it.
7324077	7324717	Yasichi.
7325117	7325918	Shichi.
7325958	7326538	Yasichi.
7326558	7327059	Yasichi.
7327779	7328139	That's it.
7328219	7329040	That's what I'm trying to think of.
7329080	7329941	Thank you, DarkTest Studio.
7330001	7331142	You get a nickel.
7332163	7332883	It's made out of wood.
7332943	7333304	Enjoy.
7334685	7334945	Alright.
7335866	7338828	Big thanks to all you guys on Facebook and Google Plus to answer the question.
7338888	7339529	I'm so sorry.
7339549	7342691	I didn't read all the Facebook answers because there's like a lot.
7342732	7343112	There's over 20.
7343772	7344993	Oh, don't also forget though.
7345254	7346174	So go and read them.
7346354	7347676	I'm commanding you to go read everybody's answers.
7347696	7349117	Getting the Hadouken and Mega Man X.
7349980	7351541	Hadouken, Hadouken, Hadouken
7374011	7376212	Alright, anyhow, that's it for Fugle Question of the Week.
7376592	7378534	Let's move on with some more news.
7378574	7382636	We'll get to the mailbag, FUs, Twitter topics, Skype, all that good stuff in just a little bit.
7382716	7383917	But first, Loki.
7384237	7386838	Man, Valve is getting into all sorts of crazy shit.
7387759	7392101	First, they have their game service, and then now they're putting other software.
7392622	7395283	Now they're making documentaries.
7396144	7399505	Yes, Valve has documentaries that are...
7400606	7401807	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7419904	7425413	It makes sense things are going this way when that whole indie game, the movie, I'm assuming it did fairly well on Steam.
7425733	7426995	I saw people talking about it.
7428197	7434627	They did sort of have a documentary in iPad form with Portal 2, The Final Days.
7434967	7437850	Oh yeah, wasn't that like a contracted thing though?
7438030	7438290	Yeah.
7438411	7441714	Because like Jeff Keighley put that all together, or at least supervised it.
7441754	7445157	I'm sure he didn't do it all himself, but you know, supervised that whole thing.
7445638	7452725	Yeah, because they did the portal, but wasn't there one that was the last days of... There was another game that had one.
7452785	7453705	Was it another Valve game?
7455487	7457049	Actually, didn't they do one for Mass Effect 3?
7458171	7458611	They did.
7458952	7462294	They did do The Last Days of Mass Effect 3 and The Last Days of Portal.
7462334	7462755	I don't care.
7462775	7465677	I just want to see an animated Team Fortress 2 movie.
7465777	7467438	That would be fucking amazing.
7467478	7468659	Fans can make them now.
7468799	7469320	Oh, I understand that.
7469380	7470481	And then market them through Steam.
7471081	7471741	It'd be crazy.
7472482	7478186	I still want to see a... Let's see a future-length animated movie because their shit's pretty awesome.
7478206	7479367	You got Wreck-It Ralph coming.
7480428	7482390	I doubt Team Fortress characters are in it, but...
7483390	7484070	They should be.
7485571	7486031	Why not?
7486891	7488311	All right, moving on to Nintendo.
7488411	7494352	I referenced this a little bit earlier in the show, but I wanted to go into depth on this a little bit because I'm sure Loki will have an opinion on this.
7495052	7501073	Nintendo is promising that their DLC will not leave users feel cheated or deceived.
7501474	7508455	This is according to Satoru Iwata, who of course is the president of Nintendo, because you know Nintendo is just now getting into DLC.
7510356	7513499	It's 2012, and DLC's been prevalent since what, about 06, 07?
7514320	7521908	Well, they're just now getting the HD, too, so I mean... Nintendo's finally getting into DLC, and here's what they said.
7522328	7531958	And one thing Nintendo has determined as a company policy, what we are not going to do is create a full game and then say, let's hold this back for DLC.
7532799	7533760	That's all a matter of opinion
7551049	7558857	Capcom, I'm sure, in their defense, would say that Street Fighter X Tekken was a full game and that these additional characters are, you know, just that.
7558918	7559598	They're additional.
7559638	7561721	But the rest of the internet called them out on that bullshit.
7561741	7563382	But, yeah, it's on disc.
7563663	7564864	It's paid to unlock content.
7564924	7567447	And there's even, like, there's one story I didn't talk about.
7567547	7568708	It was Sleeping Dogs.
7568988	7571091	How they, oh, yeah, we have six months planned of DLC.
7571151	7572232	It's all paid to unlock stuff.
7572652	7576895	To be fair, that is a game where you don't really need that stuff.
7576975	7577935	It's just costumes.
7578796	7580096	I don't think there's any additional missions.
7580116	7582398	There may be, but it's mostly costumes.
7582818	7583919	One quick other statement here.
7584299	7588901	Our goal is to create DLC in such a way that consumers do not feel they have been cheated or deceived.
7589462	7593524	I believe there are people out there, readers, who are worried about that.
7593544	7594945	I think that's a weird translation there.
7595365	7600548	We just want to ensure them that we have in mind and want them to know that that's not what we are planning on doing.
7602153	7602813	So Nintendo?
7602953	7604774	Planning and doing are two different things.
7606555	7620860	We're not planning on doing it, but... Well, you know, it's not just Iwata that said this because I remember distinctly in that 3DS little press conference thing, not the one from E3, but the one that came out a little later where they spotlighted the games again.
7620880	7623961	It was like one of those Nintendo Direct things that had Reggie and some of those guys.
7624361	7625142	for Nintendo in it.
7626223	7630626	He specifically said, we're going to have DLC for New Super Mario Bros.
7630907	7634610	2, but I want to assure everybody it's additional content.
7634890	7636492	We have a finished game first.
7636512	7642977	I mean, they really went out of their way to stress it's not something that you're going to have to have.
7643037	7645780	It is truly something extra the designers are working on.
7646400	7647141	We'll see.
7649303	7650704	What do you think, Nintendo DLC?
7651704	7654527	I don't really know what the thing is yet because we haven't seen any examples yet.
7656129	7656990	New Super Mario Bros.
7657010	7659833	2 is going to be the first example of first-party DLC anyway.
7661034	7670145	I just don't know if it's going to... I mean, I would be... I was always hoping that, like, you know, Excite Truck, you know, hey, all we need is DLC with new levels.
7670465	7670865	That's it.
7670945	7673148	Just add new levels and I'll be happy.
7674718	7675258	Thanks for watching!
7696252	7701358	This old Mario Kart level is in 3D now, or it's in the polygons and stuff.
7701979	7703281	Now it's getting a little old.
7704142	7705383	It's getting a little tiresome.
7706725	7709288	Maybe do a Mario Kart game that didn't have the old tracks in it.
7710816	7711276	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7730350	7737277	Nintendo were to put out five new tracks, like a new circuit of five new tracks, what would that be worth to you as DLC?
7737498	7738218	What would you pay for that?
7738278	7738999	It depends on what circuit.
7739039	7740120	I mean, if it's old re-release stuff.
7740140	7740681	Let's say all new.
7740861	7741502	Let's say it's all new.
7743164	7744105	I'd say like five bucks.
7744405	7744685	Really?
7745026	7745186	Yeah.
7745466	7746487	I wouldn't want to see it more than $2.99.
7746527	7747408	Maybe I'm just a cheapskate.
7747428	7750471	I mean, if you have really good tracks, it would all depend.
7750531	7751032	I mean, you know.
7751885	7756367	or Mario 2 Coin Rush levels, three stages, back to back.
7756387	7757548	I wouldn't buy any of that.
7757608	7758168	I don't know.
7758228	7759549	It's really about the price.
7759949	7761569	Is Nintendo going to get the price right?
7762150	7762590	I don't know.
7764471	7764851	We'll see.
7767308	7794035	uh chiggers in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says mario kart level editor and share please but then they wouldn't be able to charge you for dlc if they do that they have a mario kart level editor now on the wii and there is some not official though is it no but there's some way you can do it with sd cards where you can load custom tracks on there same with um the 3ds or not the 3ds the uh uh was it new super mario rose on the wii same thing with that you can do custom levels in that somehow
7794443	7801147	I should say this, though, because some people say, well, if Mario Kart added that in, then they wouldn't be able to sell DLC.
7801467	7802387	Not necessarily the case.
7802428	7803648	Look at something like LittleBigPlanet.
7803668	7804749	It does this very well.
7804789	7806050	LittleBigPlanet does great DLC.
7806070	7806930	That reminds me.
7807030	7810272	There was a ROM hack for New Super Mario Bros.
7810512	7812433	on the DS that was New Super Mario Bros.
7812793	7815235	3, and it had a lot of really cool levels and stuff in it.
7815875	7818356	That would be kind of cool to compare that to New Super Mario Bros.
7818376	7818537	2 now.
7819737	7826778	Let's see how better one is than the other.
7826999	7830099	Because I think that one had some really unique ideas that they did with it.
7831599	7833720	I don't know if we're going to see that in the level design.
7834000	7838941	I don't know if a lot of those people are thinking that far outside the box like some of the ROM hackers do.
7839641	7840501	We shall see.
7841321	7842402	Let's move on for now.
7842442	7844442	DarkSakura with some more news.
7845310	7848931	Well, we do have something else from Valve.
7850351	7853571	Well, I'm sure you're familiar with the Perpetual Testing Initiative.
7854051	7856372	That was the in-game Portal 2 editor.
7856612	7857552	I played a few other things.
7857592	7867694	Someone's actually even gone and tried to recreate the entire first portal using nothing but, at least the puzzles and everything, using nothing but the in-game editor.
7868134	7873315	Well, now they have a patch that's going to be an update for that to let you do co-op...
7874955	7884123	Co-op Test Chambers and you also have another option that's a quick play feature so that you can see the top rated user maps for each category.
7885444	7893991	It's like I said free and it's also going to come with a 75% off Portal 2 voucher so that you can share the game with a friend.
7895412	7896013	Not bad, huh?
7897274	7897995	No, it's not bad at all.
7898095	7898815	I love you Steam.
7898875	7899416	I love you!
7901511	7905614	So I can get a friend Portal 2, whether they want it or not.
7906274	7906735	They want it.
7907615	7907996	They want it.
7908076	7909076	Who wouldn't want Portal 2?
7909136	7909577	It's great.
7909777	7911278	I would think everybody should have it by now.
7912138	7913459	With all them Steam sales and stuff.
7913479	7914000	I know, right?
7916075	7917176	So this is kind of shocking.
7917476	7924599	During Gamescom, apparently, some early builds of the game Divinity were stolen out of the booth.
7924919	7931942	They literally picked up PCs and ran out of the building and somehow didn't get caught.
7933837	7935178	This is a sick trend.
7935518	7936559	How does that even happen?
7936819	7938700	We've heard about this happening at PAX and everything.
7939020	7940661	It's chaos.
7940921	7950406	I could see if it was, for whatever reason, on a disc or something, popping the disc out, pointing it in your pocket, and running out of the... Well, something like that happened at the last PAX, didn't it?
7950446	7951407	Didn't we report on that?
7951487	7956009	Or somebody had copied it to a USB drive or something and ran out with it?
7956089	7959451	Yeah, it was... I forget what game it was, but yeah, I do remember that.
7961511	7988680	but anyways so apparently the two games Divinity Dragon Commander and Divinity Original Sin have been stolen from Larian Studios and they've actually posted a reward of $5,000 for anybody that can you know point fingers at who took them it was Breach was the game that was stolen at PAX oh I'm sorry yeah
7991314	7991974	It's just weird.
7992274	7992935	I'm surprised.
7994675	7999116	Apparently, they were using backup PCs, so there's no issues with actual code being sold.
7999316	8001017	Yeah, it only makes sense you can back up that stuff.
8001037	8003798	This is our only copy of the code that we have here.
8003818	8005338	Yeah, I wouldn't be too surprised.
8005398	8005998	Ah, shit.
8006058	8009979	But still, it's still shitty that they have to plan that.
8010180	8013701	Well, I mean, backing up code machines, but it's shitty if somebody stole it in the first place.
8014061	8014701	I mean, come on.
8014761	8016081	It's got to be on security cameras.
8016101	8018082	You're going to notice someone, you know,
8019434	8022975	GameGuru in our chatroom with the inappropriate joke Guest appearance by Carmen Sandiego
8048161	8048482	Where?
8048642	8048922	When?
8049202	8049843	Womp womp.
8051945	8053326	Alright, let's move on.
8053426	8055108	One more story before the mailbag for you guys.
8055128	8056349	This is also out of Gamescom.
8056729	8059111	Something a little better than stolen things.
8060032	8063695	A little seminar about how to pitch your indie game to Sony.
8063735	8067879	Oh, excuse me, this is not out of Gamescom, but close.
8067939	8069441	It's another Europe convention.
8070041	8071682	I sound like such an ignorant American right now.
8071722	8072282	My apologies.
8072702	8074262	It's Game Developers Conference Europe.
8074322	8076263	GDC Europe also happened last week.
8076383	8077183	You may or may not have heard.
8077583	8090447	But yeah, there was a seminar by Pete Smith who is the Sony CrossDev Director of Product Development talking about basically what you should and you shouldn't do when you pitch your indie game.
8091307	8095068	He said, quote, I'm sick of sitting through crap development pitches.
8095928	8096188	Hmm.
8096909	8098329	DarkSakura, let's play a game.
8100082	8103664	Let's see if you can guess what would be some of the do's and some of the don'ts.
8104044	8108085	If you're going to pitch your indie game, what are some of the do's and some of the don'ts?
8108125	8108886	What would be your guess?
8110847	8113248	Loki, if you haven't spoiled this for yourself already, you can play too.
8113928	8114508	But no cheating.
8115248	8117889	What to do when you're pitching it and what not to do?
8117969	8121811	Yeah, what would you do to pitch it and what makes a good pitch and what doesn't make a good pitch?
8122557	8145889	well with a good pitch you want to definitely have some presentation materials like concept art something that's going to be solid you want to have something well written out spelled correctly ding ding ding we have have assets these include a one page overview screenshots or video all on a USB stick for the publisher to keep don't waste time or money on swag good
8146317	8146637	Yeah.
8147678	8158163	I mean, it's nice to have something kind of neat to throw in it, but no one's going to invest any money if they don't have at least an appetizer instead of the meat and potatoes.
8158443	8161424	They need to see what the vision is.
8161444	8162745	They need to have a projection.
8162765	8172189	They need to have a financial comparison to see if there's other games of a similar genre, what they're making money with, and how this is going to compare to them.
8172389	8173710	Financial presentation.
8174310	8176334	What not to do is just say, oh, I've got an idea for a game.
8176374	8176955	Will you give me money?
8179599	8181321	Not to harass them with phone calls.
8181902	8183425	You send the first email.
8183465	8185188	You send them the test product.
8185228	8186109	You send a follow-up.
8186730	8187732	You wait for a response.
8189265	8193189	That's not really on the list per se, but I still think that's good advice.
8193289	8194870	I don't think that's necessarily wrong.
8195971	8196972	Similar answers are there.
8197012	8197753	Loki, did you cheat?
8198293	8198693	I didn't cheat.
8198793	8200395	All right, what would you guess?
8200495	8206660	Good pitch features tits and ass.
8206780	8207301	You know what?
8207421	8211424	I will give that credit because on the do not list is be boring.
8211905	8214527	So certainly that is the opposite of boring.
8215248	8216709	Be boring is on the do not list.
8218014	8224260	Um, I don't think that they want, it's, try to stay away from, like, graphs and charts, maybe?
8224420	8232128	I don't know, maybe more, just quick summaries of, like, here's my story, you know, here's, you know, the concept, that type of thing?
8232268	8234311	Again, the opposite is true.
8234451	8238475	So, DingDing, on the do list, keep your visuals simple and bold, basically.
8238855	8239015	So...
8239716	8267894	yeah so anyhow on the do list know what your game is be able to pitch it in 30 seconds yeah keep your visuals simple and bold you don't have to you want to you want to show off gameplay not graphics exactly you want to be succinct research fuck yes don't ask them what Evita is really if you're gonna pitch to Sony don't ask them what Evita is really really I have something for your Vita system
8269924	8272205	I have a vital game for the vita.
8272766	8276748	Well, actually, there's something else that occurred to me, and I didn't look at your screen.
8276768	8278089	I haven't seen anything.
8278129	8278489	Sure, sure.
8278909	8288114	You want to make sure that the person making the pitch knows how to speak in front of people, enunciate, and has a presence.
8288335	8291777	Practice your pitch and choose the right person for the pitch.
8291797	8292377	Is that on there for real?
8292597	8293857	Yeah, are both there for real.
8294498	8296738	Practice your pitch and choose the right person for the pitch.
8297099	8299719	Someone who can talk about the game to a room of suits with ease.
8300260	8300660	Exactly.
8301640	8303601	The average person does not know corporate speak.
8303661	8303921	Sorry.
8304401	8304701	Let's see.
8304801	8310463	Also on the list here, be able to adapt because some games often don't end up what they're pitched.
8311443	8313164	Manage your expectations.
8313524	8316485	Sony isn't going to back a game unless it benefits them as well as you.
8317005	8318706	So be prepared to negotiate that IP.
8319506	8348523	I think that's a very realistic answer there let's see I think we hit on some of these others sell yourself as a company and as individuals I think that's very interesting because they say that you have to be able to work with the people not just the idea very interesting they say Media Molecule was a great example of this Sony wanted to work with the people so they followed through Media Molecule probably brought us one of the greatest Sony games ever period little big planet show passion if you don't care why will they
8350202	8353503	Hi, I'm Ben Stein and here's my game.
8353743	8355584	Alright, lastly on the do not list and then we'll move on.
8355904	8356665	Don't be boring.
8357545	8360886	Don't bitch and whine about other developers or publishers.
8361307	8362367	I think that's great advice.
8362447	8365488	Don't burn your bridges and they just say it's a small industry.
8366129	8366709	Very true.
8367869	8371131	Don't spend the entire time on your pitch because you want room for Q&A.
8371571	8372771	Don't bullshit.
8377434	8381615	You know, there's already a million bullshit terms, though, that people have used to fool the public.
8382275	8384236	Like, remember blast processing?
8384836	8385896	Yeah, that's true, yeah.
8385956	8386957	You know what all that was?
8387457	8390537	That was the only thing that Genesis did better than the Super Nintendo.
8390737	8391358	Just saying.
8391978	8396299	You know, or, like, look at these graphics, blah, blah, blah.
8396379	8396939	No substance.
8397799	8399820	You know, that's bullshitting right there.
8399840	8401880	You just show them pretty... Like, what was Heavenly Sword?
8403701	8404541	Jane, Enemy, Crabs.
8405382	8407763	Knowit also has blast processing.
8408783	8409364	Chipotle.
8412665	8412965	All right.
8414106	8415946	Here's the big ones from the do not list.
8416386	8418367	These are actually on the list.
8418467	8420468	And Jamie, you're just going to go like, really?
8420728	8421869	They have to tell people this?
8421989	8422269	Really?
8423249	8428691	First, do not tell the publisher how to do their job.
8429452	8431413	Don't tell Sony why they're a bad publisher.
8433373	8434874	Don't be late.
8437971	8439491	and don't you ready for the last one?
8439511	8442933	shut up Tiger Claw, mode 7 was awesome you ready for the last one?
8443633	8446614	don't be hungover really?
8449035	8450156	don't be hungover really?
8450396	8460280	because a lot of pitches are done at these types of E3, GDC, big events right after big parties don't come drunk the next day really?
8461921	8462261	really?
8463422	8463962	food for thought
8465168	8473098	They suggest that you have the rest of your life to drink so that if you have a presentation the next day, maybe you just shouldn't party the night before.
8473219	8475742	And not everyone has my mutant power to never have a hangover.
8476903	8480388	Just saying.
8480448	8483011	Dungeon Buster says, wow, those had to be on a list.
8485225	8489107	TigerClaw says, by the way, someone should pitch the OLR the game.
8489507	8490707	It's already happening, remember?
8490747	8495689	We got an indie game coming to the marketplace, the Bungie Ferret Tossing, which I'm told is very soon.
8496009	8496549	It's happening soon.
8496589	8498630	I totally want to do a bumper.
8499971	8501131	Play our game, damn it.
8502512	8504192	Giovedeo wins with this comment.
8504972	8506333	And don't fuck it up.
8508157	8508377	Yes.
8508897	8511498	RuPaul's Drag Race references will always win.
8512879	8514620	I will purchase Dio Videa's product.
8515740	8516380	You win, ma'am.
8517020	8517361	All right.
8517841	8519381	Let's get to the mailbag.
8519461	8526084	Every week we collect your mails is at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
8526744	8527585	There's my mailbag music.
8529844	8537609	DarkSakura is going to put on her protective garb and dive into the mailbag headfirst and pull out some emails to reads for use.
8538509	8539090	DarkSakura.
8541311	8542892	I don't think your whistling is getting picked up by the mic.
8542912	8544673	No, it's not, but I felt like whistling anyway.
8545353	8546394	Hi, OLR.
8547074	8547375	Hi.
8547495	8549656	Hi, enthusiastic emailer.
8550497	8552378	I'm currently listening to episode 469 now live.
8552418	8552698	I'm sorry.
8552758	8552958	Sorry.
8557287	8562170	You wrote I and, but I think you meant and I. Heard Rob request emails for codes.
8562570	8566473	I'm so jealous of other live listeners because I cannot F and type fast enough.
8566793	8568514	Oh, did you not screen the emails?
8568534	8572276	Because we're going to have those emails that are like, give me loot because we have loot to give away.
8572296	8572957	No, I'm going to read it.
8573137	8573837	All right, that's fine.
8574297	8578740	If I get the code, I will find some way to get Loki to don the Tingle costume come hell or high water.
8580621	8581381	That's from Spazinator.
8581721	8584362	I'm not sure if I understand how that's going to happen.
8585342	8586722	I don't believe that that was ever part of the plan.
8586742	8587962	It'll be like Loki Saw.
8588122	8589283	Drugs or violence.
8589403	8591783	Saw off your leg or wear a tingle.
8591803	8592723	Live or die.
8593963	8595624	Live or die or tingle.
8595684	8596304	Make your choice.
8598224	8599684	I miss the Saw movies.
8599984	8600484	I don't.
8600805	8601385	Well, come on.
8601405	8602845	What do we have now?
8603005	8605185	Yearly paranormal activity movies?
8606285	8607646	Silent Hill Revelations.
8607886	8608466	I know!
8609906	8610487	Thank you very much.
8630560	8631300	Hi!
8631381	8631621	Okay.
8632021	8633422	Hey, OLR peoples, this is Honey Badger.
8633482	8636223	I knew Honey Badger was going to email because Honey Badger told me he was going to email.
8636864	8637284	A.K.A.
8637324	8638265	Blade 3, A.K.A.
8638325	8639125	Sam, call me whatever.
8640066	8643187	Either way, I just wanted to tell a little story about a funny experience with EA.
8644608	8647930	EA has been distinguished as being the world's shittiest company.
8648431	8650852	I bought two copies of the same game via Origin.
8651232	8657376	Basically, a friend and I were looking for a way to play Mercenaries 2 together because it was a cheap sale for it.
8658196	8660738	I bought it with my Origin account for me and then for him.
8661259	8665862	But wait, Origin does not have the feature to let you gift a copy of a game.
8666262	8668964	So I told my friend I would log in as him and buy it for him, and I did.
8669485	8678311	My next move was contact EA to refund one of the games, and after all, I never accessed the downloaded game in any way, so why would there be a problem there?
8678851	8679992	So I pulled up EA Live Chat.
8680012	8684776	The rep I spoke to knew about one sentence of English, so that was great.
8715299	8718941	There's really truly only one thing I can say about all of that.
8723023	8723783	There's more.
8723923	8728065	I was going to say there's hostile employees at every workplace.
8728545	8729126	That's true.
8729246	8730406	This company sucks.
8730606	8731347	I hate working here.
8732687	8733608	They're always the best.
8734841	8736963	Because they'll give you the most stuff because they hate their job.
8737883	8738844	A winner is you.
8758988	8769593	DarkSakura has me wondering if the next Playstation and Xbox will have the same controllers as the current systems or will they be redesigned?
8769613	8771274	What do you all think?
8783268	8784349	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8804079	8804840	Thanks for watching!
8821531	8823973	Rumble was so last gen.
8824133	8824953	Anybody need Rumble?
8825353	8825694	Anybody?
8826094	8827975	Rumble was so last gen.
8828315	8830317	Ridge Racer is going to use six axis.
8830757	8831637	So here's the deal.
8831817	8832978	Which is a pile of crap.
8833058	8836740	PlayStation 4, probably not going to buck the trend too much.
8836901	8840383	I mean, I would think maybe one thing they're going to try to do.
8841343	8842264	I don't know why.
8842284	8844705	I'm just putting my little tinfoil hat.
8845066	8848748	I think it'll kind of look like a PS3 controller, but they're going to try to push that rear touch thing.
8849128	8849989	on those controllers.
8850029	8853091	And it's going to be a little ridiculous, but that's just what I think might happen.
8853111	8855312	I can see that, but I think the basic design isn't going to change.
8856133	8858094	Xbox will change somewhat, I think.
8858274	8861836	Even the controller design changed within that first Xbox.
8861936	8863277	The D-pad.
8863717	8866099	Remember the first Xbox was gigantic?
8866439	8868781	Those gigantic Xbox controllers, and they scaled them down.
8869301	8872543	And then the Xbox 360 controller was relatively similar enough.
8872883	8878267	Now, looking at other systems, I think Nintendo's going to have a different controller every fucking time.
8878607	8881748	Yeah, I mean, that's the one that is radically different every time.
8881768	8890392	The only ones that never looked really much different was the... Well, even when they brought out the top-loading NES, they had this NES-style controller, kind of.
8891013	8893874	But there was still a basic paddle and button layout, you know.
8894574	8914791	Now, the ones that, as far as logical redesigns have gone, is if you take the Sega systems, gone from the Master System, gone to the Genesis, gone to the six-button Genesis controller, to the Saturn that had a similar controller to the Genesis, to the dual analog controller, which I will stand on this to this day, best controller ever.
8916313	8917475	Dreamcast, Dual Analog Controller
8931632	8952202	Um, but I mean, I think that using those examples, I think that the companies, the powers that be, except for Nintendo, have learned their lesson from making too many variables in, you know, when it comes to controller progression, and are sticking with the tried and true shape.
8953631	8961199	I may not be the biggest Sony fan, but I have to say that the controller has always had an ergonomically comfortable shape.
8961820	8966324	I do find it easier to hold it than I do an Xbox controller.
8966745	8971389	Even though I tend to like games better on Xbox, the PlayStation controller is easier to hold.
8971409	8972130	I think they'll stick with it.
8973190	9000689	one thing to keep in mind too before you move on to the next email is that keep in mind the next Xbox is going to be very heavy on this whole whatever the new Kinect is whatever this advanced Kinect is Microsoft wants Kinect to happen I mean I guess Kinect already has happened but they want it to be more than a fad they're going to shove this thing down your throat in the next Xbox so even though yes there will be a tangible controller there has to be for the Halo games expect that Microsoft will make a big deal out of the whole
9001269	9002211	Thanks for watching!
9016762	9027107	I think that you're dealing with two... The bulk of gamers, at least, that have the money to afford any of this are going to be in our age group.
9027728	9032370	People who have grown up with a controller in their hand and they've tried this before with, like, remember the U-Force?
9032650	9033390	Oh, that was crap.
9034311	9035932	Or the Activator.
9036812	9038733	They've tried hands-free controllers before.
9039474	9041555	And true, the technology wasn't what it is today.
9041595	9050260	I mean, definitely Kinect is, I'd have to say it, but the best of it, but at the very least with Nintendo and with the Move, you've still got something tangible that you can hold.
9050320	9052221	People like that tactile experience.
9053302	9058885	And do you remember that thing that they were making for, so you could feel the textures of things in games?
9059426	9059766	Yeah.
9059806	9061227	That thing was kind of cool.
9061287	9062227	The haptic stuff.
9062367	9063328	Yeah, that was pretty cool.
9063748	9064309	But I mean, it goes...
9068426	9069427	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
9089743	9093884	But logically, take away the five-year-old laughing at everything.
9094584	9095004	Am I right?
9095704	9101865	Do you prefer to have something in your hand while you play, or do you like waving your hands in the air, unless you're playing Parapara?
9102426	9104946	Yeah, it's acceptable if I'm playing Dance Central.
9105006	9107327	That's really the only game, and it's clones.
9108007	9111007	Those dancing games are really the only ones that have really been a great experience.
9111027	9114128	Dancing and even the fitness stuff, if that actually works, you know?
9114148	9114348	Mm-hmm.
9114668	9116010	Yeah, when the fitness games work.
9116210	9117372	Yeah, yeah, I'll agree with that.
9117512	9119495	Same thing with the Wii, you know, and all that.
9119795	9122699	But I just bitched about this last week or the week before.
9122739	9125823	That Disneyland Connect, I want to pick up a controller and play it.
9126324	9126564	Yeah.
9127405	9127505	Ugh.
9128368	9156424	and especially when you're dealing it's like they're trying to retrain an entire generation of gamers they want all the newer ones coming in to have a different experience than we did where I'm sorry we're the ones with the money and there's nothing wrong with having a controller you know now the only advantage like I said I can see for having something like this is like if someone's got my you know horrific hand problems but what did I do I started playing on the consoles and started playing on my PC
9157757	9166359	I think also that they want to get rid of the controller because a lot of elderly and older people think that controllers are too confusing and so it's like all you have to do is wave your hands.
9166699	9167540	Oh, I can do that.
9167920	9172221	I wave my hands at random strangers all the time so I'm totally used to this.
9172881	9175362	I wave my hand to get kids off my lawn.
9175382	9178763	I can use this as another kind of analogy here.
9179343	9183064	I was in band and Rob, you know this, you were in band.
9183384	9184184	What did you play clarinet at?
9185310	9186031	DarkSakura.com
9210049	9210689	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9234318	9246003	If you look at the people who are worse with being coordinated, like actual dancing and everything, I can't dance for crap, but I can play a game.
9246183	9247924	You can DDR like a son of a bitch.
9248144	9251925	Exactly, because that has to do more with the same thing.
9253786	9260892	It's a different type of... You have your hand-eye coordination going, but you don't have something that's going to be an abstract movement.
9260992	9263194	It has something that has a tactile response.
9263915	9264616	So, anyway.
9264936	9265356	Fair enough.
9266197	9266657	Next email.
9267638	9268579	I forgot what I was saying.
9268659	9268879	Oh, yeah.
9269780	9270441	Hi, OLR.
9270841	9277627	Just wanted to type you a small email and let you know the last week's show for... Wait for it.
9277867	9278468	69 was awesome.
9279268	9279669	Nice job.
9281064	9285187	Also wanted to say that Shane was right about sound shapes and Rob, your review was excellent.
9285967	9288649	It is truly a great game and a breath of fresh air for the Vita.
9289310	9291491	Loki, I know you are an FPS fan.
9291711	9294093	Are you going to get into CSGO?
9294673	9295073	What's that?
9295113	9297235	No, probably not going to get into Counter-Strike GO.
9297435	9297835	Thank you.
9298436	9299176	I was like, what's that?
9299196	9300297	He's like, I'm on the beta now.
9300377	9301197	Is that the free-to-play one?
9301638	9306441	Yeah, it's the free-to-play one, but I never really played Counter-Strike, so I don't know.
9307988	9309251	He says, I'm on the beta now.
9309372	9310054	It's pretty good.
9310214	9312159	Old school Counter-Strike with a new look.
9313303	9314887	Anywho, keep up the great work, Travis.
9315762	9316703	Well, thank you for the compliments.
9316883	9319025	I love getting emails where it's just nothing but compliments.
9319065	9323869	Really, first-person shooters have become my second-place genre of choice.
9325070	9325690	You like bugs.
9325951	9328253	I like sandbox games.
9328633	9334538	I do need to go back to playing more Sleeping Dogs because that's pretty awesome.
9334698	9339342	But really, this is just all killing time before Grand Theft Auto V comes out.
9339382	9340022	And then it's just...
9340823	9341764	That's all it's going to be.
9342104	9348527	That and also maybe a quick excursion to Defense Force on the Vita when that comes out at the end of September in Japan.
9349168	9349828	Can't wait.
9351029	9351329	All right.
9351369	9353690	Let's get a little bit angsty here with the FU.
9353710	9354571	That's it for the mailbag, right?
9355111	9355351	Yes.
9355691	9359193	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email in the future.
9359513	9360574	In the meantime, let's get angsty.
9375804	9377634	FU's of the week time, DarkSakura
9380103	9384066	This is going to be difficult for me to say.
9384987	9387348	But I did say it on my Facebook and got into an argument with my mother.
9388349	9390931	Of course, I can't say anything on Facebook without getting into an argument with my mother.
9390951	9392512	Fuck that.
9393993	9401799	I would like to say a current F you to the Republican Party and their choice of who's running and his running mate.
9402079	9405802	I don't think that I... And I really am trying not to be judgmental.
9406422	9408503	I mean, yeah, I'm a judgmental bitch anyway, but it doesn't matter.
9409724	9433656	but anyone who supports that level of evil I don't know that I would be able to look them in the eye so fuck that level of evil I'm done let's see I guess F you to I don't know be burnt out at work that's it
9435618	9436798	Thank you for watching!
9455843	9473460	and more importantly an F you to a real toll on my body F you to myself for overdoing it at the gym Monday because like I really hurt my leg by I guess I didn't stretch good enough beforehand or I did too much resistance and on the bike because I do a lot of cardio and yeah I was paying for it for like five days I couldn't go back to the gym
9473780	9474600	I really wanted to go.
9474780	9475180	If I may.
9475940	9484662	And this is what has been drilled into my head by all of... I used to be really good friends with one of my gym... the ladies that taught classes at my gym.
9485402	9490363	And you're supposed to do a five-minute light warm-up, then stretch, then do your stuff.
9490843	9491663	Oh, I didn't do that.
9492083	9494464	I do the light... Never stretch your muscles cold.
9494484	9497344	I don't just go right into high resistance, obviously.
9497384	9500905	I try to do the up and down, like the little up and down type of thing.
9501765	9503145	Circuit style.
9503763	9531449	I guess but I don't like circuit implies to me you do five minutes on every machine I'm not at that level yet you know I just I it's if I can get my fat ass on a bike and roll around on it for an hour that is an accomplishment for me so but um it's you never want to work out with muscles that are cold you always want like Dan used to just go sit in the sauna before he did anything anything but honestly you actually want to work and then stretch and then work interesting yeah just saying
9531889	9532649	Learning something.
9532970	9534150	Wii Fit didn't tell me that.
9534871	9536652	Or maybe it did and I wasn't paying attention.
9536712	9539453	Like I said, you know all the time I used to spend working out.
9540073	9546277	Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys and then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR as well as the Twitter topics.
9546297	9547918	I'm going to get out my iPad and see if there are any.
9548498	9551399	And any last minute stories Loki might have.
9551440	9553601	But first, two final stories for you guys.
9553641	9553861	Loki.
9554421	9583389	Alright, so one of the games I mentioned I played this week was Castle Miner Z which has sold 900,000 copies and apparently is one of the fastest selling Xbox Live indie games I'm not sure if it's the fastest selling one but I know because I know I made a zombie with games in it or I made a zombie game made a game with zombies in it sold quite a bit and then I'm sure there's been some other ones that have done well as part of the indie games program
9584249	9590432	It's definitely one of the most recent ones, according to the developer.
9591312	9596494	Also, I guess it is at the top of the daily best-selling area of Xbox.com right now.
9597454	9599495	It's only 80 Microsoft points, so if you want to check it out.
9600295	9604357	I'm sure there's also a lot of other good games for 80 Microsoft points on the indie games as well.
9605257	9606878	and other unrelated news.
9608298	9609439	Minecraft.
9609459	9611139	7 million copies sold on PC.
9611679	9612319	So that's pretty cool.
9613280	9615200	So that genre of game seems to be doing pretty well.
9617161	9618001	It just won't die.
9618222	9619382	The phenomenon will not stop.
9621257	9622117	Axl Rose Remember Guns N' Roses?
9643002	9648427	Axl Rose had a preliminary hearing about the Guitar Hero 3 lawsuit.
9648668	9651871	Apparently there is a tentative court date in February 2013.
9653192	9660058	Axl Rose is pissed about the game, which came out in late 2007 as a reminder, and it will finally go to court in 2013.
9662300	9682189	uh apparently it unlawfully associated Guns N' Roses music with Slash who as you know was formerly with Guns N' Roses and him and Axl Rose they don't get along so Axl Rose was pissed about that basically saying Slash was associated with these songs but they're not his songs so fuck all y'all right
9683959	9692021	Well, the judge during the preliminary hearing wanted to toss out the claim of fraud because the statute of limitations has expired.
9693021	9697002	However, let's see, it came up here, quote,
9710985	9722613	from December 2007 through November 2010, Activision was offering me a Guns N' Roses dedicated video game, a game dedicated to music from the Chinese Democracy album, and other proposals.
9723513	9724354	Interesting.
9724854	9730518	So the judge did dismiss the claim of fraud, but the breach of contract, it is moving forward for February 1st, 2013.
9732259	9740825	So that's why it took Axl Rose three years to file a lawsuit, because they were basically cock-teasing him about his own game, or so he claims, allegedly, all that good stuff.
9741886	9761845	But it makes sense why they decided not to do it Because when Guitar Hero Van Halen and Band Hero and all that kind of oversaturated the market You know, those artist-centric video games, none of them really did very well The only one that did marginally good was The Beatles And when The Beatles can only do marginally successful, it's not good enough
9762305	9763266	Welcome to Unemployment!
9790522	9790922	Alright.
9791082	9791603	You know what?
9792243	9792543	What?
9793584	9795705	I need to find something different for the fortune cookie real quick.
9795925	9797106	It's the best thing ever, so hold on.
9797526	9798307	Alright, you do that.
9798367	9799427	Send it to me in private message.
9799747	9800388	We'll switch it out.
9800828	9803589	Alright, Skype line's open, guys.
9803610	9806771	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9806811	9810133	Go ahead and give us a call if you want to talk about anything we've talked about in the news tonight.
9810573	9812014	Or maybe you have something new.
9812354	9813275	I don't know.
9814376	9815776	I'm going to do some quick Twitter topics.
9815796	9816637	We don't have a lot of them.
9817077	9841023	but we do have a couple of them SSJ100 Matt sent us a tweet and I think I already know what this is without going to it but he sends us a tweet that says this is how China gets rid of outlawed arcade machines or what they call gambling machines and he sends us a link to a story from arcadeheroes.com yep I had a feeling look at all these arcade machines on fire they just set them on fire burn it with fire burn it with fire
9843075	9843756	And there they go.
9844116	9845658	Loki, do you have any last-minute stories for us?
9846899	9851003	No, I forgot to mention that as part of my gaming week, I actually played Megazooks.
9852304	9854926	That's right, the old ZZT-type game.
9855567	9857709	I actually booted that up.
9857829	9859731	I was like, oh, hey, I'll make something in this.
9859791	9865176	And then I realized how out of practice in making stuff with Megazooks I was.
9865316	9866697	So I said, eh, fuck it.
9867498	9868119	Don't care anymore.
9868159	9869060	I remember Megazooks.
9869080	9869620	That's awesome.
9869941	9870541	It was awesome.
9870762	9871282	Good times.
9872183	9875386	All right, let's go to some tweets from Tigerclaw.
9875526	9878750	Heavy Rain Director tells game industry it's time to grow up.
9879751	9881532	Before I even get into the article, what do you guys think?
9881592	9883034	Is it time for the games industry to grow up?
9885234	9887037	We mean by grow up.
9887617	9889921	One goes to one corner, the other goes to another corner.
9890081	9896370	Here's the pull quote from Gamasutra, which Tigerclaw linked us to on Twitter at twitter.com.
9896971	9899575	I mean, how many first-person shooters can you make?
9899855	9905998	There's a moment where we need to grow up, and that's David Cage, who is the director of Beyond Two Souls.
9906118	9907398	You know, I'm sorry.
9908399	9913021	It sounds like he needs to grow up because it sounds like he's whining that Heavy Rain didn't sell as well.
9913341	9913681	You know what?
9913701	9915182	They're making games that sell well.
9915402	9918265	Hold on though, because I do agree with this.
9918305	9921467	That poll quote is a little sensational, but let's get into the full quote here.
9921507	9922188	Now I'm in the article.
9922268	9929354	Quote, I think we should have more courage in our industry and take more risks because I think this is what the industry needs now.
9929494	9931216	I mean, how many first-person shooters can you make?
9931556	9934118	How many monsters, aliens, zombies can you kill in games?
9934418	9936000	There's a moment where we need to grow up.
9936220	9936941	We need to grow up.
9937701	9940562	I often think the industry suffers of the Peter Pan syndrome.
9940823	9943244	It's the fact that we don't want to grow up, so we stay kids.
9943564	9947746	But there is a moment where you need to grow up as an industry, and you cannot keep up with the Peter Pan syndrome.
9948006	9949967	You need to grow, and I think this is the right time.
9950487	9957210	Maybe I don't agree so much with the second part of that, but the first part about they need some different shit, I kind of agree with it.
9957730	9960932	Who isn't sick of sequel, sequel, sequel, sequel?
9961312	9963253	I mean, granted, I guess in some ways we support it.
9963573	9966594	But I do like a lot of the new ideas.
9967134	9977576	You know, if we never experimented with new ideas, we wouldn't have recent hits like Mass Effect or Little Big Planet, which, granted, all spawn their own sequels, but, you know, good games.
9978296	9980397	Even on the indie side, Braid, Limbo.
9980457	9983858	Well, Mass Effect kind of turned into just a shooter with this story, but...
9985638	9994261	I'm just... I think that the reason why they're not taking risks right now, because whenever they seem to try to take risks, they end up not selling well, those games.
9994942	9998423	And, you know, some of these companies are in trouble, like THQ, for example.
9998723	10008667	They took a risk with, you know, making that whole, you know, tablet drawing pad thing, because everyone's like, oh, hey, cool, it's like, you know, like Mario Paint.
10008847	10010268	And then no one bought it.
10010568	10011048	And then...
10011308	10011508	Madworld
10034389	10036490	There's another example of a game that took risks on the Wii.
10036791	10037431	No one bought it.
10038232	10041634	Conduit, pretty awesome first-person shooter game on the Wii.
10041914	10042494	No one bought it.
10042875	10044696	So that's where your risks come in.
10045056	10046757	Actdeft in chat says, I bought Mario Paint.
10047898	10053461	Well, yeah, you bought Mario Paint, but you didn't buy the tablet that THQ put out or the one that Ubisoft put out.
10053702	10056383	I am woefully neglecting the Skype line over here.
10056423	10057124	Let me take some calls.
10057184	10058044	I just missed that one.
10058084	10058885	Let me take this one, though.
10058905	10060026	There's two calls lighting up right now.
10060346	10061266	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
10061286	10061607	Who's this?
10063257	10064678	Hey Zaku, what's on your mind, buddy?
10065678	10072581	Nothing much, just recovering from going out with my girlfriend today and everything.
10073101	10074381	And Kings of the Coast yesterday.
10074802	10075902	Recovering, huh?
10076902	10079923	Yeah, that is true.
10080003	10085445	I would have competed today, but since I have a relationship and everything, she comes first.
10085505	10087826	Wait a minute, wait a minute.
10087886	10089387	So there was a 2DX tournament today?
10090080	10092021	There was the Kings of the Coast that ate on the break.
10109972	10115776	That and watching Expendables 2 with her, which she actually enjoyed.
10116497	10122802	Even though she was kind of hesitant at first, she actually enjoyed watching old men shoot guns and kill people.
10123662	10124563	Well, she's a keeper.
10126084	10129326	I think that's amazing that finally it's done.
10129607	10132389	Zaku is now officially over Bomani, everybody.
10132869	10133089	Not really.
10133109	10134170	Girls and Guns did it.
10134190	10135031	It's only for today.
10135771	10136992	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10161747	10162728	A lot of people answered.
10162768	10167131	I think they're almost wrapping up the doubles tournament right now as we speak.
10167191	10169272	What version of 2DX do they have out there in Jersey?
10170193	10170593	Lincoln.
10171494	10173856	Same one they have out not far from me in Queens.
10174356	10174616	Nice.
10175737	10176157	You know what, though?
10176177	10177638	It's not hard to pack eight on the break.
10177678	10181761	I seem to remember it was kind of a small place because the arcade machines took up a lot of room.
10181881	10183382	It would be hard to pack that joint.
10183643	10186645	And I'd say the same thing about SVGL is similar.
10186725	10189547	I mean, it's not hard to pack that place because there's not a lot of space.
10191101	10194583	Anyways, let's digress a little bit.
10195024	10212695	I'm going to post up a link to an article that you probably already discussed probably earlier before I got on about the Assassin's Creed 3 director basically chiding Japanese games and to the point of playing the race card because they're basically getting a free pass.
10213016	10216438	Actually, we didn't bring this up earlier, so I'm glad you are.
10216618	10217979	Go ahead and tell us a little bit about this.
10218641	10235091	Alright, long story short, the creative director of Assassin's Creed 3, Alex Hutchinson, he basically went on a rant earlier last week in deriding why certain Japanese games are getting free passes, like something about...
10237006	10244310	Yeah, saying stuff about, like, just think how many Japanese games are released where the stories are literally gibberish.
10244410	10245190	Literally gibberish.
10245610	10250313	There's no way you could write it with a straight face and journalists say, oh, it's brilliant.
10250353	10255515	Yeah, let me read this quote here, and this is what you're going off of here, and this is in an interview with CVG.
10256396	10261578	He said, just think about how many Japanese games are released where their stories are literally gibberish.
10262019	10262719	Literally gibberish.
10262739	10266261	There's no way you could write it with a straight face and journalists say, oh, it's brilliant.
10266881	10270502	Then Gears of War comes out and apparently it's the worst written narrative in a game ever.
10270622	10273643	I'll take Gears of War over Bayonetta any time.
10274123	10278045	It's patronizing to say, oh, those Japanese stories, they don't really mean what they're doing.
10278465	10281766	I don't get why critics didn't like Gears of War.
10281826	10282706	That's news to me.
10282726	10284327	Bayonetta was a better game.
10285907	10289610	But the real kicker is his first response.
10290171	10291171	You want my real answer?
10291291	10297856	I think there's a subtle racism in the business, especially on the journalist side, where Japanese developers are forgiven for doing what they do.
10297876	10299717	I think it's condescending to do this.
10300538	10302540	So he really, like, goes off the bat.
10302560	10305483	He really, like, goes for the juggler on the first sentence.
10305603	10310487	I just... I think he's... I mean, what about... We just talked... I'll tell you what we did talk about earlier in the show.
10310928	10311828	Final Fantasy.
10312389	10317514	You know, Final Fantasy XIII did get hazed for a lot of that stuff and being too linear in a way.
10317554	10320196	And then, of course, XIV got right through the damn coals.
10320756	10321057	So...
10321437	10324982	Well, 14 was an abomination because it was poorly executed.
10325522	10338440	And the fact that so many gaffes in the beginning and then to the point where they had to actually, you know, the creative director and the producers had to hand in the resignations, it was just a cluster.
10339711	10366783	whereas if you look at other American RPGs like Skyrim which I'm actually going through right now thank you Steam sale of last month but you see how versed that game is it's getting to the point where I'm putting at least two hours a night right now just on Skyrim alone because it's so many things to do you can level up your character if you wanted to continue on the main quest do some side quests try your luck in killing giants
10367583	10368846	It was also buggy as shit.
10368866	10374557	It's almost like a GTA, but with actual goals towards beefing up your character stats.
10376101	10394269	and I think what goes wrong with Japanese games like Final Fantasy, it only sticks to, I mean, there is an open world, there is a concept of an open world, but everything is pretty much linear in the sense that you have to do X mission, Y mission, side quests, and obviously the occasional grinding.
10394289	10401392	There's no retribution where you can attack freely any other type of enemy, because the combat system is so rigid.
10403672	10410820	In the sense that you randomly encounter enemies, you have to fight within that realm of your enemy versus your characters.
10411681	10415665	I mean, I'm using Final Fantasy VII as a frame of reference, but you get the idea.
10416446	10425216	The way Bethesda outdid Squeenix was just thinking outside the box and applying what they've already done best.
10425356	10427136	Why can't people just like what they like?
10427436	10430037	Let's just like what we like and leave people alone.
10430377	10435938	I mean, I don't understand why he's gotta, you know, some people like the Japanese stuff and let it be.
10436398	10442920	But I don't think just because you like one Japanese game means you love them all or just because you love all Japanese games there's gonna be a few you hate, you know?
10443300	10450181	I don't know, it's just way too broad of a statement and I'm hoping this is just media sensationalism here that we're only perpetuating with this call.
10450561	10454322	Because I would really just hope that he's not that narrow-minded.
10456411	10457172	I guess so.
10457692	10457953	All right.
10458573	10460675	Zaku, I got to wrap up and let you go so we can get more calls.
10460855	10462437	Any other thoughts here before we let you go?
10463998	10464979	That was about it.
10465360	10465640	All right.
10465700	10467021	Have fun and be safe.
10467442	10468002	Be safe, Zaku.
10468022	10468483	Definitely.
10468643	10468903	All right.
10468943	10469103	Bye.
10471376	10488332	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call I'll probably have you guys take the next call because I need to go start dinner so 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio I think I missed a Twitter topic
10489113	10489573	Did you?
10489754	10495518	Yeah, there was one, because I was in the middle of one, but then there was a second one that Tigerclaw had sent that I wanted to get to.
10495598	10496578	Oh, never mind.
10496758	10497379	I have a reprieve.
10497759	10499961	So, DarkSakura, Loki, one of you can take this call.
10499981	10500261	You ready?
10500421	10500981	Here we go.
10502362	10502863	Hello!
10503143	10504944	This is Orange Lounge Radio.
10505104	10505585	What do you want?
10506225	10512309	Tiger, tiger, tiger, tiger, chew, chew, it's too sorry.
10512669	10514591	Tiger, I'm chewing for you.
10516363	10519005	Well, how are you this evening, Jim Sally?
10519505	10520225	I'm doing good.
10520265	10521906	I'm so glad you picked up the phone today.
10522407	10523748	Yeah, me too.
10524008	10525609	Should I use my phone operator voice?
10526548	10530989	Oh yeah, you do your phone operator voice and I'll do my annoying Portuguese mama voice.
10531029	10532790	We'll see if we can do some funny coffee here.
10533330	10534110	It's going to be good.
10534451	10535471	You do your voice, I'll do my voice.
10535491	10538952	See, now I'm laughing too hard to do the phone operator voice.
10539192	10540753	Hello, I call for the job.
10541993	10543874	I come to clean your stuff.
10545694	10547055	Just put your stuff in the corner.
10547875	10549875	My son come to your house today.
10549895	10552296	Put his underwear clean.
10553717	10554797	So what's up, otherwise?
10555911	10564015	I was calling to have a discussion about the new Walking Dead game that I downloaded on my iPad this weekend.
10565175	10566096	Walking Dead.
10566596	10567216	Walking Dead.
10567496	10570157	It's by Telltale and it's nice.
10570618	10571618	We like Telltale.
10572218	10572518	What?
10572718	10573979	We like Telltale.
10574639	10575400	I like them too, man.
10575420	10581442	Look, this is going to be a little bit of a spoiler review because I only played the first half hour of it anyway.
10581462	10583303	It's the first episode so spoilers are okay.
10583743	10584564	There was a scene.
10584984	10585284	Listen.
10585908	10589931	It was this scene where I was in a house and a zombie came after me.
10589951	10591532	A little zombie like babysitter shit.
10591892	10593894	And I kicked that zombie in the snatch.
10594334	10597836	And then the zombie fell down and I picked up the hammer.
10598377	10599578	Oh my god.
10600038	10602820	You schmuck the zombie in the face with the hammer.
10603160	10605822	And then Toto's like, hey, would you like to stop?
10606242	10606923	Or keep going?
10606943	10610145	And I was like, I'll keep smashing this thing in the face right now.
10611034	10612374	You smash it.
10612855	10613695	You smash it.
10614995	10616055	It looks so gross.
10616135	10618016	That's the kind of options gamers want.
10618656	10619836	Yet satisfied.
10620397	10622217	It was gross yet satisfied.
10622637	10623677	Would you like to see more?
10624758	10625438	We can oblige.
10625538	10625718	Oh, my God.
10625778	10626958	I couldn't get enough of it.
10628399	10629419	And it's so simple.
10630699	10631539	It was a little bit.
10632600	10637141	They say it's just point and click, but there is a bit of a quick time to it every now and again that you got to do.
10637608	10639769	But it's like baby quick time, you know what I'm saying?
10640009	10640209	Yeah.
10640249	10641710	Like, it's pretty baby quick time.
10642030	10644091	Which is exactly what I need on a Sunday night.
10644491	10647572	When I've been having salad.
10648012	10652014	It's not really salad.
10652074	10655656	It's green leaves that make you talk like this.
10658297	10658697	Anyway.
10659697	10660638	Anyway, hey.
10662659	10663139	I also...
10664322	10665923	Is Rob even around?
10665983	10666643	Is Rob leaving?
10666683	10668184	Rob was being domestic.
10668204	10669365	I just got back.
10669945	10670845	Hi, Jim Sally.
10671166	10672526	Hi, Rob Roberts.
10672566	10673367	How are you?
10673507	10674047	I'm good.
10674147	10675488	I'm being domestic right now.
10675568	10677789	So I had to walk away from the studio for a minute.
10677829	10678289	But what's up?
10678950	10680430	Listen, Rob.
10681411	10685853	I started shopping for microphones.
10689216	10691777	Are you setting up the Jim Sally Studios?
10692397	10693457	I think so, man.
10694157	10696978	I think it's time for pillow talk, man.
10697638	10701419	I even started making a little theme music and stuff, man, for the show.
10701619	10708180	I gave Jim Sally a name for his show because Jim Sally suggested he be the opener for the opener.
10708240	10711501	Like he could open for Bobby, which I don't consider Bobby an opener.
10711521	10712781	I consider him a co-headliner.
10712821	10714981	But since he calls himself an opener, I'll go with that.
10715302	10717402	Jim Sally said he could be the opener for the opener.
10717662	10718143	DarkSakura.com
10734138	10736620	I like that, the night train.
10736681	10737181	That's good.
10737241	10737762	That's good.
10738883	10740444	I'm just throwing it out there.
10740905	10748412	For you, Jim, or for anybody out there in the universe listening to this show, VOG Network, we are very interested in getting some movie
10749397	10750638	Podcast would be great.
10750798	10756600	Book podcast is like at the top of my want list right now, be it manga, comic, or written book.
10757241	10758641	Keep bugging my wife.
10758941	10765504	Also, I would love to see like a role play, like an old school tabletop gaming.
10765885	10769907	And it could be LARPing Dungeons and Dragons, and I love, love, love.
10769927	10770807	I would so do this.
10771127	10776111	I love, love, love the idea of a game that is podcast.
10776772	10779134	You know that would be difficult.
10779214	10781556	Somebody who's actually running a game to be podcast.
10782076	10784258	Everyone at the table would need a microphone.
10785319	10788502	Nah, you get some good boom mics.
10788562	10791024	And you'd have to have the die cam.
10791665	10793726	You see them rolling and see who's cheating at the table.
10794567	10795648	I didn't nudge that.
10795908	10796629	I sneezed.
10797372	10800859	Jamie just rolled a 7 on the 20-sided die.
10802142	10804707	This means that she has failed her intelligence check.
10807057	10809939	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10835833	10836654	That would be the problem.
10836934	10837755	So, anyhow.
10838135	10842359	Why don't you just leave the microphone on today when you leave and I'll come do some pillow talk.
10843460	10844301	I'm ready for it.
10844601	10845562	That I might be okay with.
10845702	10849305	I got a review of 21 Jump Street.
10852488	10855751	Here's a little review snippet that maybe you're going to hear about.
10856051	10857673	It has a lot of dick jokes in it.
10857693	10859374	A lot of good dick jokes in it.
10859694	10860375	You know what I'm saying?
10860680	10862481	Best use of comedic dick in 2010.
10862721	10871745	You know, for a show that would end up being on like after midnight on the East Coast on a Sunday night, Monday morning, anything goes, really.
10872365	10873065	Anything goes.
10873165	10873966	That's Jim Sally.
10874526	10875266	Anything goes.
10875286	10877627	We're not bitches and hoes.
10878628	10878888	All right.
10879548	10881609	Jim, anything else you want to share with us tonight before we let you go?
10884010	10889172	I would just like to say thank you for the encouragement and and
10889608	10892210	I'm going to try really hard to do stuff for you.
10892710	10893311	You're welcome.
10893631	10894031	Anytime.
10895032	10895532	Anytime, buddy.
10895832	10898735	Alright, take care and give baby a kiss for me.
10899675	10901336	I'm biting my pillow right now.
10903358	10903718	Careful.
10903978	10904519	Alright, bye.
10909127	10910048	Does he know what that means?
10912049	10915712	You used that word, but I don't think it means what you think it means.
10919114	10922897	Rob, if we did a tabletop gaming cast, it would have to be called Roll to Hit.
10924738	10925759	What was the comment in chat?
10925779	10927200	Chiggers says, call it Reroll.
10927580	10928000	I like that.
10928020	10928520	That's a good one.
10929401	10932463	Stan says, I want to see an anime show on VOG Network.
10933624	10936506	Ranma might want to let you know there is one on Tuesdays at 6.30 Pacific.
10941541	10942903	Answering listeners' demands.
10944045	10945908	I want to see an anime show on VOG Network.
10946028	10946329	Alright.
10946709	10947611	Tune in on Tuesday.
10947731	10948031	Done.
10949534	10951377	Technically, you don't see it.
10955273	10957035	Alright, is there any more calls going to come in?
10957375	10958356	Oh, hello.
10959096	10959497	Twitter.
10959877	10960478	I forgot Twitter.
10960978	10961519	Yeah, Rob.
10961559	10962299	Stop forgetting Twitter.
10962319	10963120	What the hell was that noise?
10963140	10963761	All that forgetting.
10963921	10964121	What?
10965182	10966023	That was a weird noise.
10966663	10966984	Alright.
10968425	10970086	Ranma in chat says, thank you.
10971147	10971788	You're welcome, BB.
10972702	10975825	Okay, one more tweet from Tiger Claw.
10976545	10977566	God, I fucking hate this.
10977586	10981670	When you go to mobile websites, GameSpot now has a free iPad app.
10981730	10982711	Click OK to get that.
10982831	10983111	Fuck off.
10983131	10983952	No one, Kerr.
10983972	10985734	If I wanted your app, I would go download it.
10986995	10989797	The worst are the ones with the gigantic splash screens.
10989877	10992179	So obviously, Tiger Claw linked me to a GameSpot article.
10992620	10995222	Oh, but there's a call coming in, so you'll just have to wait and see what it's about.
10997264	10998184	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10998204	10998525	Who's this?
10999312	11001793	Well, hello there, fine Olarians.
11001913	11002613	It's Sterlok.
11003394	11004354	I got called fine.
11004934	11005835	What's up, Sterlok?
11008155	11008676	Not too much.
11010796	11017859	I don't know if you talked about the Vita firmware update in Part A. I kind of missed a lot of it.
11017959	11023982	Briefly, it let off our rapid-fire news tonight, but we talked quickly about it, so what do you want to say about it?
11025062	11027283	Well, it kind of makes me want a Vita now.
11028237	11030761	A firmware update makes you want a Vita.
11030801	11032663	What is it about the firmware update that makes you want it?
11033424	11037930	Because they added a feature that should have been in there from the beginning.
11038351	11038832	Which is?
11040177	11049322	Use of the buttons in the home screen, which you would think would have been in there by default, but I don't know what the hell Sony was thinking.
11049582	11054585	Now, something the listeners may not remember about you from previous phone calls to the show, but you're blind, right?
11055045	11055225	Yep.
11055525	11059708	So this is something that is kind of important if you're trying to navigate.
11059728	11068873	That was literally, I was pretty stoked for the Vita when I heard about some of the games that were coming to it, especially like Mortal Kombat.
11070013	11073717	Um... Something like sound shapes, too, is awesome.
11074097	11082844	You know, I think even being, you know, with Blind, the way you kind of interact with the sounds and the fact that the sounds kind of drive the stage a little bit, I think you'd get a kick out of it.
11083265	11084826	Um... Okay, um...
11087441	11089583	How prevalent is the touchscreen in sound shapes?
11089623	11091445	I don't really do a lot of research into it.
11091565	11092366	Is it all button-based?
11092386	11093347	You don't have to use it at all.
11093687	11096470	If you want to design stages, you have to use it a little bit.
11097652	11098432	Interesting.
11098452	11099593	I'm going to have to check that one out.
11099954	11101175	I think you get a kick out of it.
11101676	11110024	I'm also a big fan of the Rhythm Heaven slash Tengoku series on the GBA and DS.
11111644	11113065	and the Wii most recently.
11113565	11114326	Those are pretty awesome.
11114486	11121010	Do you think that maybe Sony realized, you know, oops, we're not really being accommodating for all people?
11121610	11129014	I know some people that did send letters to them about it and not all of them being blind.
11129054	11132016	I've heard even a lot of sighted people bitching.
11133689	11134990	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11150603	11151903	It's pretty awesome.
11152023	11152163	Yeah.
11180475	11183228	Alright, well, Sterlok, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
11184233	11184313	Um...
11186188	11187729	DarkSakura has deployed her 20-sided die.
11187749	11188030	Laughter
11213047	11215849	She's currently attempting her saving throw.
11218450	11220572	Oh, and she didn't quite make it.
11222501	11225422	I would love it, but we'll have to see what's out there.
11225462	11236524	Because as Bobby's emphasizing in chat, we are kind of looking for shows that are already... Because we don't really want to bring on... Again, it's all about... People might have an idea and like, oh, I want to do this, I want to do this.
11236864	11239725	But then they don't realize how hard it really is to keep it going.
11239745	11243186	There's a lot of work that goes into doing something.
11243226	11243906	I mean, I do a...
11245362	11247784	I do a little shameless plug.
11247824	11249025	Why not?
11249766	11253388	I do a little show on Thursday afternoons.
11254149	11254469	Oh, sorry.
11254489	11255130	That's my Twitter.
11257392	11258833	Yes, I have Mario Sounds on my Twitter.
11259293	11259753	Giant nerd.
11259974	11261235	That's all right.
11262636	11263737	But yes, 3 to 5 Eastern.
11266943	11287415	On Thursdays I do a show on a station called Infinity Radio called Video Game Valhalla where I play two hours of video game music or stuff from the Angry Video Game Nerd or the Spoonie one, stuff like that.
11287695	11290577	Basically anything pertaining to video games.
11290697	11291357	I bet that's a good time.
11291377	11292278	You have a good announcer voice.
11292318	11292558	You do.
11292778	11293819	I'm not just saying that.
11293879	11295220	So I bet that's a good time.
11295300	11297001	And it's not up against any VOG programming.
11297061	11297541	So you're good.
11298402	11298882	Well, that's good.
11299923	11300143	All right.
11300363	11302164	Sterlok, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show.
11302184	11303165	But thanks so much for your call.
11303625	11303866	All right.
11303946	11304306	Good luck.
11304486	11305166	What was that again?
11305226	11305987	Video Game Valhalla?
11306227	11309829	Video Game Valhalla on Infinity Radio.
11309909	11310170	Sorry.
11310550	11310830	All right.
11311310	11311951	Check it out, folks.
11312291	11313032	Have a good one, Sterlok.
11313492	11313752	See ya.
11313972	11314192	Thanks.
11314312	11314552	Bye-bye.
11315433	11317054	Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
11317094	11318654	Thank you guys so much for calling in.
11318714	11322156	Sorry if you didn't get through, although I've got to admit, it was a little light on the calls tonight.
11322176	11324117	I think I got almost everybody who was trying to get through.
11324137	11326958	But if I missed you, I may not have seen it, I'm very sorry.
11327038	11330279	Send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
11330599	11334241	Let me get back real quick to that tweet that I mentioned from Tigerclaw.
11334261	11335381	We'll close out with this tonight.
11336341	11341804	Dice, the Battlefield developer, afraid to release Battlefield 3 mod tools.
11342984	11344705	They said at GDC Europe
11345925	11350507	That apparently the studio was fearful of the implications of releasing the mod tools.
11351027	11364093	Let's see, they were quote, and this is a quote from Magnus Trottersen, who is the general manager of DICE, said quote, "...afraid of all the things that can come with releasing the code."
11364793	11386484	quote if we do mod support we want to do it really really well we are not ready to do this yet interesting i guess oh and also that if the mods come out they want console players in too i think that part's kind of interesting as well is that they don't want to just just let it be for pc they want console players to get in on the fun that's kind of nice pretty cool
11387877	11392901	I have a couple last-minute tweets here, so what the hell, I'll read them.
11393401	11397323	There's a couple tweets here from Ratchet1785 on Twitter.
11397343	11400626	They literally came in one minute ago, so I'll go ahead and read these.
11400646	11403948	Ratchet1785 asks, Are you guys excited about Borderlands 2?
11404588	11406690	First live show, by the way, and this is the best.
11406750	11407650	Three-year listener.
11407710	11408771	Well, howdy-doody.
11409051	11411273	And get your butt in chat next time if you're not already there.
11411313	11411833	I don't see you there.
11411893	11415536	Live.VogNetwork.com Are you guys excited about Borderlands 2?
11415596	11415776	Yes.
11416416	11417517	I don't even have to ask Loki.
11417637	11417807	Thanks for watching!
11419328	11447908	I don't know if excited is the right word but I'm highly curious about Borderlands 2 because I liked what I played of Borderlands 1 I really need to play more of it so yeah I will check it out and I like some of the things they're doing with it I don't like that whole mess earlier this week about the whole girlfriend mode and all that crap that was going around but I'm just going to chalk a lot of that up to the media and Twitter and the internet kind of latching on to one thing and then running with it
11448428	11469792	and it's not going to affect the quality of the game I think at the end of the day the way that they're doing like an easy mode tree that sounds great to me that's not a girlfriend mode that's a me mode and I know there's a lot of people that feel the same way you know I don't mind playing the games on an easier mode to get the story and the experience I'm actually planning on playing through Mass Effect 3 on Insanity
11471209	11471649	Good luck!
11472510	11473271	In god mode.
11473711	11474191	Good luck?
11474331	11474892	Oh.
11475112	11476913	Well then, that's no fair.
11477333	11477494	No.
11477874	11484098	Alright, and lastly, also tell your listeners I'm giving away a copy of Borderlands 2 on my gaming channel on YouTubes.
11484659	11485559	But then he didn't link it.
11486620	11489142	So I'm gonna hope it's the same name, Ratchet1785.
11489202	11493145	If it's not the same name, I guess tune in next week.
11493626	11495267	because that's going to do it for tweets tonight.
11495587	11504753	Twitter.com slash OLR and that's about going to do it for the show tonight but not until we go around and get everybody's final thought.
11505593	11508015	Loki, we'll start with you because you said there's no last minute stories, right?
11508535	11509956	Eh, I just don't care.
11511533	11511933	Fair enough.
11512033	11513274	It's been a three-hour show tonight.
11513294	11513874	We can wrap up.
11514755	11520458	Loki, plus the podcast is even going to be a little longer because, thankfully, we have the Darksiders 2 song in there.
11520518	11522360	So I think we're good to wrap up.
11522560	11524561	Loki, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
11524681	11528943	I was just going to say retweet that thing that I tweeted about Evilot.
11529864	11535930	They're having a contest on their site, and whoever gets the most retweets gets a picture drawn by one of the artists.
11536130	11542716	And she does really kick-ass art, so I would like a picture because she does pixel art and it looks fucking awesome.
11542736	11543797	Oh, so you need a retweet.
11543957	11545599	Like, I need a retweet.
11545679	11548201	I retweeted, or I sent it out, and I can't...
11549386	11556508	I can't figure out how to, like, and I did it once, because obviously I copied it in the chat room, but I can't remember how I got the direct link to that tweet.
11556648	11564550	And I was like, you click on, if you go to your actual Twitter page, I think there's a way to see details, or detailed tweet or something like that.
11564570	11564911	Maybe, okay.
11564951	11571933	Well, anyways, it's on my Twitter, at LokiOLR, and just retweeted, you know, it's the one talking about Evil Eye.
11571973	11575374	It's done by FoodieMonster, or he's the animator on it.
11575394	11576794	I still would like to know where FoodieMonster went.
11577915	11578957	Where have you been, FootyMonster?
11579557	11579978	Come back to OLR.
11579998	11588889	It's probably busy, but seriously, you should go back and even... I mean, it looks like a pretty cool game, and they're under halfway there right now.
11588909	11589771	They're only looking for 10 grand.
11590336	11593138	I will retweet from the OLR account my personal account just for you.
11593298	11594399	I will appreciate that.
11594679	11595520	And the Horde House account.
11595840	11601324	If anybody else can do it, that'd be awesome because right now I'm the only one who retweets on there.
11601385	11605087	But I would like to, you know... I want a picture.
11605127	11605968	It looks awesome.
11606188	11606709	Seriously.
11606989	11607489	That's awesome.
11608030	11609491	And you should go back to the game because it's awesome.
11609531	11610952	I backed it, so check it out.
11611352	11612793	Good deal.
11613314	11614334	My final thought tonight.
11614394	11615735	My final thought tonight is...
11617907	11620087	Sleep, Soon, CZZ.
11620788	11621908	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
11622828	11629969	I was just peeking at Tumblr for a second, and someone posted a GIF of someone dying during an MRI.
11629989	11632730	Ah, why would you put that on the internets?
11633350	11633890	Gross.
11634270	11638531	Well, no, it's all just a scam, but it says that you're... I'll just read what it says.
11638591	11640552	This is someone dying while having an MRI scan.
11640572	11645453	Before you die, your brain releases tons and tons of endorphins that make you feel a range of emotions.
11646113	11646933	Tragically beautiful.
11649880	11652021	I can't help it.
11652041	11653902	Since I don't have the soundboard up.
11653962	11654943	Thanks, Debbie Downer.
11655763	11657444	But it means when you die, you die happy.
11658485	11659605	Okay.
11659745	11660306	I don't know.
11660546	11663688	Can't you tell a booby joke or something to end the show on a happy note?
11663728	11664428	They have blue feet.
11668016	11669337	More positive energy.
11669357	11670819	What did the boobie say to the tit?
11672601	11673002	Thank you.
11673462	11675585	What did the boobie say to the tit, DarkSakura?
11675725	11676045	Chirp.
11678989	11679469	They're birds.
11684093	11684733	Thank you very much.
11684854	11685774	Alright, that's going to do it.
11685994	11686334	Thank you.
